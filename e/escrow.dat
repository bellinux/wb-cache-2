5|$|In some states, {{there are}} Son of Sam laws prohibiting convicted criminals from {{publishing}} memoirs for profit. These laws were {{a response to}} offers to David Berkowitz to write memoirs about the murders he committed. The Supreme Court struck down a law of this type in New York {{as a violation of}} the First Amendment in the case Simon & Schuster v. Crime Victims Board (1991). That statute did not prohibit publication of a memoir by a convicted criminal. Instead, it provided that all profits from the book were to be put in <b>escrow</b> for a time. The interest from the <b>escrow</b> account was used to fund the New York State Crime Victims Board – an organization that pays the medical and related bills of victims of crime. Similar laws in other states remain unchallenged.|$|E

5|$|Aside from {{complaints}} {{regarding the}} high retail {{price for the}} three-record set, particularly in Britain – {{a result of the}} government's refusal to waive its tax surcharge – controversy soon surrounded the project's fundraising. Because the event had not been registered as a UNICEF benefit beforehand, and was therefore not granted tax-exempt status – the blame for which Harrison lay squarely at Klein's feet – most of the money generated was held in an Internal Revenue Service <b>escrow</b> account for ten years. In interview with Derek Taylor for his autobiography in the late 1970s, Harrison put this figure at somewhere between $8 million and $10 million. Before then, in early 1972, New York magazine reported that some of the proceeds remained unaccounted for and had found their way into Klein's accounts. Klein responded by suing the magazine for $150 million in damages, and although the suit was later withdrawn, the accusations attracted unwelcome scrutiny at a time when questions were also being asked about Klein's mismanagement of the Beatles' finances. That year, an estimated $2 million had gone to the refugees via UNICEF before the IRS audit of Apple got under way; finally, in 1981, $8.8 million was added to that total following the audit.|$|E

5|$|Due to the 1994–95 NHL lockout, Bure spent single-game stints with HC Spartak Moscow of the Russian Super League and EV Landshut of the Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL). He {{joined a}} team of Russian NHL players {{organized}} by Slava Fetisov that returned to Russia to play a five-game charity tour against local clubs. On the team, Bure reunited with former Central Red Army linemates Mogilny and Fedorov. When the NHL Players Association (NHLPA) and owners came to an agreement on January 12, 1995, NHL play was set to resume. However, there were unresolved contract issues, as Salcer claimed the Canucks promised they would pay Bure's full salary, despite the lockout, which cancelled {{nearly half of the}} 1994–95 season. Bure held out for four days as a result (the amount claimed to be owing was $1.7 million), before the two sides reached an agreement. The Canucks would put the disputed amount in <b>escrow</b> and would continue discussions. He soon reported to Vancouver and went on to tally 43 points in 44 games of the shortened season. In the 1995 playoffs, Bure set franchise records for most goals and points in a series with seven and 12 respectively in a seven-game series victory against the St. Louis Blues (Mikael Samuelsson tied Bure's goal-scoring record in 2010 against the Los Angeles Kings). The Canucks, however, failed to defend their Clarence Campbell Conference championship title, being swept by the Chicago Blackhawks in the second round. The Canucks' elimination in 1995 marked the last time Bure appeared in the post-season with the club. He finished with a career playoff total of 66 points with the Canucks, including 34 goals, which remained the highest club total until Linden tied the mark in 2007.|$|E

40|$|Generally, {{the goal}} of {{identification}} schemes is to provide security assurance against impersonation attacks. Identification schemes based on zero knowledge protocols have more advantages, for example, deniability, which enables the prover to deny an identification proof so that the verifier couldn’t persuade others that it is indeed the prover who identified itself to him. This kind of identifications is called ‘deniable identification’. However, in some applications we require {{the existence of a}} (trusted) party being able to find out an evidence that a party did identify itself to a verifier is required, in order to prevent parties from misbehavior. So in this case ‘undeniability’ is needed. To the best of our knowledge, an identification scheme that provides both deniability and undeniability does not exist in the literature. In this work we propose the notion of <b>escrowed</b> deniable identification schemes, which integrates both ‘escrowed deniability’ (undeniability) and ‘deniability’ properties. Intuitively, in the online communication, a verifier may sometimes need to provide an evidence of a conversation between himself and the prover, for instance, an evidence for the case of misuse of the prover’s privilege. We then provide an <b>escrowed</b> deniable identification scheme, and prove its security, i. e. impersonation, deniability and <b>escrowed</b> deniability, in the standard model based on some standard number theoretic assumptions...|$|R

In general, in connection with a residential mortgage there should be an established <b>escrow</b> or impound account for the payment of taxes, hazard insurance, and (if applicable) flood insurance, mortgage insurance, ground rents, and any other required periodic payments. Lender shall disclose to borrower at least three business days before closing the specifics of the amount required to be in the <b>escrow</b> account and the subsequent uses of the funds. If an <b>escrow,</b> impound, or trust account is not established, or the consumer chooses to close the account, the servicer shall provide a timely and clearly written disclosure to the consumer that advises the consumer of the responsibilities of the consumer and implications for the consumer {{in the absence of any}} such account.

40|$|Despite the {{inherent}} risk arising from separating buyers and sellers, networked online marketplaces are proliferating. We describe how online auction marketplaces {{take advantage of}} institutional structures to build buyer trust in auction sellers, mitigate risk, increase satisfaction, and promote transaction intentions. It is hypothesized, based on institutional trust (Zucker 1986), that buyer trust in auction sellers can be increased, beyond past experience with sellers, through structural assurances, such as buyer-driven certification, auction house <b>escrows,</b> and credit card guarantees. We examined buyer transaction intentions, mediated by trusting beliefs, risk reduction, and satisfaction. The model is tested with 274 buyers in Amazon’s online auction marketplace. The results support the hypotheses, highlighting the importance of institution-based trust in online networks. Implications are discussed.

40|$|Ajtai and Dwork [2] have {{recently}} introduced a probabilistic public-key encryption scheme which is secure {{under the assumption}} that a certain computational problem on lattices is hard on the worst-case.

In this paper, we demonstrate how (improved) Ajtai-Dwork cryptosystem can be abused. Using this kind of abuses, users can communicate secrets in a key <b>escrowed</b> AjtaiDwork cryptosystem without fearing that their secrets will be revealed later by reconstructing their <b>escrowed</b> private-keys. However, we will also show that users have to trust their implementers because unscrupulous implementers of Ajtai-Dwork cryptosystem can leak their private-keys without their awareness.
