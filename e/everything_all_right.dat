I got rid of <b>everything,</b> <b>all</b> <b>right,</b> but I didn't really sell a turnip. You see, those society women stormed my wagon, crawled over the wheels and crowded me off to respectable distance, say [...] When I got back the wagon was swept as clean as a good housewife's parlor, and there in a bushel basket was a quart of silver." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "This," [...] he said, [...] "will make <b>everything</b> <b>all</b> <b>right.</b> And I'll {{call again}} {{in a couple of}} hours' time. You won't forget the cook?" ...|$|E

6000|$|Hendricks pondered. A {{circle of}} claws waited quietly around him, gray-metal bodies {{on all sides}} of him. [...] "Is <b>everything</b> <b>all</b> <b>right</b> in the bunker? Nothing unusual has happened?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, in that direction." [...] Henry pointed {{with his}} hand. [...] "If you find <b>everything</b> <b>all</b> <b>right</b> you might bring father back to help--if he isn't afraid the Indians {{will arrive in}} the meantime." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I carried your valise, sir," [...] he said, [...] "to the lodge, and I {{took the}} liberty of {{strapping}} it to your handle-bar. You will find <b>everything</b> <b>all</b> <b>right,</b> sir, and the--other clothes will be properly attended to." ...|$|E

Caption: "Little "Spanky" MacFarland, who is featured in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Hal Roach, "Our Gang" comedies, decides {{the best thing to}} do is to sit up and wait for that Merry gentleman, himself, just to sort of see that <b>everything's</b> <b>all</b> <b>right.</b> ...|$|R
60|$|I {{could hardly}} believe that. When I had opened the office and swept it <b>everything</b> {{appeared}} <b>all</b> <b>right.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "And," [...] {{continued}} Jack, turning also to her father, [...] "you {{can keep}} the wagon and the whole gorge in sight from the trail all the way up. So {{you can see that}} <b>everything's</b> <b>all</b> <b>right.</b> Why, I saw YOU from the first." [...] He stopped awkwardly, and added, [...] "Come along; the sooner we're off the quicker the job's over." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I've got <b>everything</b> <b>all</b> <b>right,</b> I think," [...] said Percy. [...] "I didn't {{suppose it}} was {{necessary}} to wait for you, but you'd better {{take a look at it}} to see if you think it will travel without rubbing or damaging itself." ...|$|E
60|$|Seeing {{that the}} youth {{was not to}} be fooled with, Wakefield Smith tried to dicker again, getting himself badly twisted in his plea that he would make <b>everything</b> <b>all</b> <b>right.</b> Jerry would not trust him and forced him to walk along until the nearest corner was reached. Here he {{suddenly}} made a clutch at an electric-light pole and held fast.|$|E
60|$|She {{was feeling}} quite happy now. It had been tense while it had lasted, but <b>everything</b> was <b>all</b> <b>right</b> now.|$|R

If you say no, then it's {{all bets}} off, an' <b>everything</b> <b>all</b> <b>right,</b> an' I'll take to harness-washin' at the stable so as to buy a couple of plugs. Remember, they'll only be plugs, though. But don't look at me while you're makin' up your mind. Keep your lamps on the horses." ...|$|E
60|$|Nat didn't {{look when}} we put the witch pie in Jim's pan; and we put the three tin plates {{in the bottom of}} the pan under the vittles; and so Jim got <b>everything</b> <b>all</b> <b>right,</b> and as soon as he was by himself he busted into the pie and hid the rope ladder inside of his straw tick, and {{scratched}} some marks on a tin plate and throwed it out of the window-hole.|$|E

60|$|Again {{the weary}} and {{apparently}} interminable marching became a perfect nightmare of horrors to me. The more firmly fixed became {{the realization that}} the girl's friendship had meant so much to me, the more I came to miss it; and the more impregnable the barrier of silly pride. But I was very young and would not ask Ghak for the explanation which I was sure he could give, and that might have made <b>everything</b> <b>all</b> <b>right</b> again.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{were waiting}} for them," [...] {{explained}} a tall police officer to {{the two or three}} ladies who now gathered round him with a return of courage. [...] "They had the stuff in a hand-cart and were pushing it away. The chief caught them at the corner, and rang the patrol from there. You'll find <b>everything</b> <b>all</b> <b>right,</b> I think, ladies," [...] he added, as a burly assistant was seen carrying an armload of furs up the steps.|$|E
60|$|Mr Brandon {{considered}} {{all this}} as stuff and nonsense. He could {{not deny that}} his branch of the Brandons had certainly got a good deal out of Mrs Keswick's family. But here {{was a chance to}} make <b>everything</b> <b>all</b> <b>right</b> again, and he would be delighted to see Junius, a relative, although a distant one, come into possession of Midbranch. As for the old lady's opposition, that should not be considered at all, he thought. It was his opinion that her mind had been twisted by her bad temper, and nothing she could say could hurt anybody.|$|E

6000|$|... "If <b>everything</b> is <b>all</b> <b>right,</b> you won't be harmed," [...] he said. [...] "But it doesn't {{look right}} to me. You have no {{business}} here, for one thing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing NEW," [...] he replied. [...] "Only {{five years}} ago I was livin' over on the Bar at Heavy Tree Hill {{under the name of}} Steptoe, and folks here might {{recognize}} me. I was here when your particular friend, Jim Stacy, who only knew me as Steptoe, and doesn't know me as Horncastle, your HUSBAND,--for all he's bound up my property for you,--made his big strike with his two partners. I was in his cabin that very night, and drank his whiskey. Oh, I'm all right there! I left <b>everything</b> <b>all</b> <b>right</b> behind me--only it's just as well he doesn't know I'm Horncastle. And as the boy happened to be there with me"--He stopped, and looked at her significantly.|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{own opinion}} is," [...] she answered, [...] "that {{it is nearly}} well. Mother knew {{exactly what to do}} for it; she wrapped it in wet cloths and dry cloths, and this morning I {{scarcely}} think of it. But there is one thing I want to tell you before you meet father and mother--for they want to see you, I know. We talked a great deal about you last night. You may have thought it strange I told you about the peas, but I had to do it to explain why I could not ask you to stop. Now I {{want to tell you that}} this accident made <b>everything</b> <b>all</b> <b>right.</b> As soon as father and mother knew that I was hurt they forgot everything else, and neither of them remembered that there was such a thing as a pea-vine in the world. It really seems as if my tumble was a most lucky thing. And now you must come in. They will never forgive me if I let you go away without seeing them." ...|$|E
60|$|I suppose, madam, {{that you}} must {{sometimes}} have noticed {{one of the top}} candles of a chandelier, when the room gets hot, suddenly bending over and drooping and shedding tears of hot paraffine on the candles below, and perhaps on the table; and if you can remember what that overcome candle looked like, you will have an idea of what Miss Pondar looked like when she found out Lord Edward was a dog. I think that for one brief moment she hugged to her bosom the fond belief that I was intimate with the aristocracy, and that a noble lord, had he not departed this life, would have been the first to welcome me home, and that she--she herself--was in my service. But the drop was an awful one. I could see the throes of mortified disappointment in her back, as she leaned over a bed of pinks, pulling out young plants, I am afraid, as well as weeds. When I looked at her, I was sorry I let her know it was a dog I mourned. She has tried so hard to make <b>everything</b> <b>all</b> <b>right</b> while we have been here, that she might just as well have gone on thinking that it was a noble earl who died.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{where you}} make a mistake. We're all {{inclined}} to say that <b>everything</b> is <b>all</b> <b>right</b> as long we aren't ourselves hurt. I sometimes wonder if it is extinct--bullying." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Make up for what?" [...] As {{she said}} nothing, however, {{his desire for}} lucidity renewed itself. [...] "If <b>everything's</b> so <b>all</b> <b>right</b> {{what is there to}} make up for?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{want you}} to have an {{unnecessarily}} low opinion of me, my dear. I'm not {{one of those people who}} tell you that <b>everything's</b> <b>all</b> <b>right</b> because the rich have their troubles as well as the poor. A certain modicum of decency and comfort is obviously necessary to man before we can begin to do anything but pity him; but that doesn't make it any easier to know how you're going to insure him that modicum of decency and comfort, does it?" ...|$|R
