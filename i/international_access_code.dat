2500|$|Tijuana's telephonic system {{operates}} under {{area code}} 664, {{but it is}} not the same area code 664 which is part of the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) because Mexico is not one of the countries represented by the North American Numbering Plan Administration (NANPA) where the country code is 1. So to dial a phone number from San Diego to Tijuana will require the use of an <b>international</b> <b>access</b> <b>code</b> and Mexico's Country Code, 52, before dialing the area code and the number. [...] Likewise for anyone calling from Tijuana to the United States.|$|E

50|$|A dialer (American English) or dialler (British English) is an {{electronic}} device that {{is connected to}} a telephone line to monitor the dialed numbers and alter them to seamlessly provide services that otherwise require lengthy National or <b>International</b> <b>access</b> <b>codes</b> to be dialed. A dialer automatically inserts and modifies the numbers depending {{on the time of}} day, country or area code dialed, allowing the user to subscribe to the service providers who offer the best rates. For example, a dialer could be programmed to use one service provider for international calls and another for cellular calls. This process is known as prefix insertion or least cost routing. A line powered dialer does not need any external power but instead takes the power it needs from the telephone line.|$|R
5000|$|In the United States, Canada, {{and other}} {{countries}} or territories using the North American Numbering Plan (NANP), the <b>international</b> trunk <b>access</b> <b>code</b> is 1, {{which is also the}} country calling code. The same rule also applies {{in many parts of the}} NANP, including all areas of Canada that still have variable-length dial plan. This is not universal, as there are locations within the United States that allow long distance calls within the same area code to be dialed as seven digits. In Canada, the domestic trunk <b>code</b> (long distance <b>access</b> <b>code)</b> must also be dialed along with the area code for long distance calls even within the same area code. For example, to call a number in Regina in area code 306 (Regina and the rest of the province of Saskatchewan are also served by the overlay code 639): ...|$|R
40|$|<b>International</b> audienceRandom <b>access</b> <b>coding</b> is an {{information}} task {{that has been}} extensively studied and found many applications in quantum information. In this scenario, Alice receives an n-bit string x, and wishes to encode x into a quantum state ρ x, such that Bob, when receiving the state ρ x, can choose any bit i ∈ [n] and recover the input bit x i with high probability. Here we study a variant called parity-oblivious random <b>access</b> <b>codes,</b> where we impose the cryptographic property that Bob cannot infer any information about the parity of any subset of bits of the input, apart from the single bits x i. We provide the optimal quantum parity-oblivious random <b>access</b> <b>codes</b> and {{show that they are}} asymp-totically better than the optimal classical ones. For this, we relate such encodings to a non-local game and provide tight bounds for the success probability of the non-local game via semidefinite program-ming. We also extend the well-known quantum random <b>access</b> <b>codes</b> for encoding 2 or 3 classical bits into a single qubit. Our results provide a large non-contextuality inequality violation and resolve the main open problem in a work of Spekkens, Buzacott, Keehn, Toner, and Pryde (2009) ...|$|R

40|$|A {{well known}} {{cryptographic}} primitive is so called random <b>access</b> <b>code.</b> Namely, Alice {{is to send}} to Bob one of two bits, so that Bob has the choice which bit he wants to learn about. However at any time Alice should not learn Bob's choice, and Bob should learn only the bit of his choice. The task is impossible to accomplish by means of either classical or quantum communication. On the other hand, a concept of correlations stronger than quantum ones, exhibited by so called Popescu- Rohrlich box, was introduced and widely studied. In particular, {{it is known that}} Popescu-Rohrlich box enables simulation of the random <b>access</b> <b>code</b> with the support of one bit of communication. Here, we propose a quantum analogue of this phenomenon. Namely, we define an analogue of a random <b>access</b> <b>code,</b> where instead of classical bits, one encodes qubits. We provide a quantum non-signaling box that if supported with two classical bits, allows to simulate a quantum version of random <b>access</b> <b>code.</b> We point out that two bits are necessary. We also show that a quantum random <b>access</b> <b>code</b> cannot be fully quantum: when Bob inputs superposition of two choices, the output will be in a mixed state rather than in a superposition of required states...|$|R
