They captured most of Long's main supporters, rendering the organisation impotent. However, Tri managed to escape.|$|E

Watts arrived wearing jeans for the first interview, direct from the airplane from New York City. Lynch asked her to return the next day [...] "more glammed up". She was offered the part two weeks later. Lynch explained his selection of Watts, [...] "I saw someone that I felt had a tremendous talent, and I saw someone who had a beautiful soul, an intelligence—possibilities for a lot of different roles, so it was a beautiful full package."

500|$|Olga was disdainful of {{her cousin}} Princess Irina of Russia's husband Felix Yussupov, {{the man who}} {{eventually}} murdered Rasputin in December 1916. Yussupov had taken advantage of a law permitting men who were only sons to avoid military service.

[...] "Felix is a 'downright civilian', <b>dressed</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> brown, walked to and fro about the room, searching in some bookcases with magazines and virtually doing nothing; an utterly unpleasant impression he makes — a man idling in such times", Olga wrote to her father, Tsar Nicholas, on March 5, 1915 after paying a visit to the Yussupovs. She was also strongly patriotic. In July 1915, while discussing the wedding of an acquaintance with fellow nurses, Olga said she understood why the ancestry of the groom's German grandmother was being kept hidden.

500|$|Cragh's {{recovery}} {{began the}} day after his hanging, but it was some time– one witness said 15 days– before he was able to stand unaided. That he did not recover more quickly cast doubt on the validity of the miracle, as miracles were supposed to be immediate, but [...] "partial miracles" [...] could be explained by the [...] "lukewarm faith of those who had made the vow". Once sufficiently recovered, Cragh was summoned to appear at Swansea Castle, before Lord and Lady Briouze. The chaplain, William of Codineston, was also present. Cragh explained, [...] "with great fear and apprehension" [...] according to the chaplain, that as he was being taken to the gallows he prayed to Thomas de Cantilupe to save him. His fear resulted from his concern that he might be executed again, and he had good reason to be worried. Although those who survived were usually pardoned, it was not unknown for them to be hanged again. Between the time of his hanging and his appearance at the castle Cragh may have convinced himself that he had been saved by Cantilupe, or he may simply have decided that it would be prudent for him {{to go along with the}} story for his own safety. Cragh went on to claim that as he was hanging from the gallows a bishop <b>dressed</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> white appeared, and saved him either by supporting his feet or by replacing his tongue in his mouth.|$|E
