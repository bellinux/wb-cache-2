The persistence of errors creates intra-industry performance variation that is usually attributed to the competitive advantages of successful firms.

5|$|The House of Commons {{backed the}} {{proposals}} strongly, but {{the bill of}} supremacy met opposition in the House of Lords, particularly from the bishops. Elizabeth was fortunate that many bishoprics were vacant at the time, including the Archbishopric of Canterbury. This enabled supporters amongst peers to outvote the bishops and conservative peers. Nevertheless, Elizabeth was forced to accept the title of Supreme Governor of the Church of England rather than the more contentious title of Supreme Head, which many thought unacceptable {{for a woman to}} bear. The new Act of Supremacy became law on 8 May 1559. All public officials were to swear an oath of loyalty to the monarch as the supreme governor or risk disqualification from office; the heresy laws were repealed, to avoid a repeat of the persecution of dissenters practised by Mary. At the same time, a new Act of Uniformity was passed, which made attendance at church and the use of an adapted version of the 1552 Book of Common Prayer compulsory, though the penalties for recusancy, or <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>attend</b> and conform, were not extreme.|$|E

30|$|Although {{phenomena}} such as change {{blindness and}} inattentional blindness are robust, {{it is not}} entirely clear how these failures of visual awareness are related <b>to</b> <b>failures</b> <b>to</b> <b>attend</b> <b>to</b> visual information, to represent it, and to ultimately learn in visual environments. On some views, failures of visual awareness such as change blindness underestimate the true extent of otherwise rich visual representations. This might occur if people did represent the changing features but failed to compare them across views. In contrast, other approaches emphasize visual representations that are created only when they are functional. On this view, change blindness {{may be associated with}} poor representations of the changing properties. It is possible to compromise and propose that representational richness varies across contexts, but then it becomes important to detail relationships among attention, awareness, and learning in specific, but applicable, settings. We therefore assessed these relationships in an important visual setting: screen-captured instructional videos. In two experiments, we tested the degree to which attention (as measured by gaze) predicts change detection, and whether change detection is associated with visual representations and content learning. We observed that attention sometimes predicted change detection, and that change detection was associated with representations of attended objects. However, there was no relationship between change detection and learning.|$|R

50|$|Inattentional {{blindness}} {{is related}} to but distinct from other failures of visual awareness such as change blindness, repetition blindness, visual masking, and attentional blink. The key aspect of inattentional blindess which makes it distinct from other failures in awareness rests {{on the fact that}} the undetected stimulus is unexpected. It is the unexpected nature of said stimulus that differentiates inattentional blindness from failures of awareness such as attentional failures like the aforementioned attentional blink. It is critical to acknowledge that occurrences of inattentional blindness are attributed <b>to</b> the <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> consciously <b>attend</b> <b>to</b> an item in the visual field as opposed the absence of cognitive processing.|$|R

25|$|In the {{subsequent}} case of Chng Wei Meng v. Public Prosecutor (2002), the appellant was given, pursuant to section 42A of the Road Traffic Act ("RTA"), {{a written warning}} stating {{that he might be}} disqualified from driving if he failed to attend court for a traffic offence. An oral warning to the same effect was also given to the appellant. Before the appellant was arrested under section 43(4) of the RTA for driving while under disqualification, he was disqualified from driving after failing to attend court. The appellant appealed against his conviction, claiming inter alia {{that there had been a}} breach of natural justice because the written warning and the requirements of section 42A(1)(d) of the RTA were discrepant, since the section provided that he would be disqualified from driving for <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>attend</b> court. The appellant also submitted that he had not been served a disqualification notice. Chief Justice Yong Pung How dismissed the appeal. He stated that in order for the notice to be vitiated by non-compliance with section 42A, the non-compliance had to be fundamental, substantive and material in nature. However, this was not so on the facts of the case. In addition, to establish a breach of natural justice, the applicant had to prove that he had suffered substantial prejudice or injustice as a result of the non-compliance with section 42A since there is no such thing in law as a technical breach of natural justice. However, on the facts there had been little prejudice caused to the appellant since he had read the notice and knew the consequences of not attending court, but had promptly forgotten all about it.|$|E

40|$|Starting {{from the}} finding that {{simultaneous}} interpreters have an increased number of stutter-like disfluencies in their speech when working through noise, the thesis sets out to explore {{the relationship between the}} stutters of normal speakers under stress and pathological stuttering. Since the conditions under which pathological stuttering can be suppressed, and in particular the absence of auditory feedback, appear to involve distraction from auditory feedback, it is hypothesised that attention to auditory feedback is important in pathological stuttering. The thesis is designed to determine whether this is also true of the stutters of normal speakers under stress, particularly interpreters. The role of stress is discussed in terms of its effects on attention deployment. It is proposed that the known attention narrowing effect of stress or high arousal may be operating to direct attention intermittently to auditory feedback in all types of stuttering, including delayed auditory feedback stuttering. Experiment 1 investigates the effect of reducing, amplifying, and delaying auditory feedback, and of speech tasks requiring different patterns of attention deployment, on the occurrence of stutters. The known effects of delayed auditory feedback are found. Interpreting elicits more stutters than shadowing, and a significant relationship is found between stutters and <b>failures</b> <b>to</b> <b>attend</b> <b>to</b> simultaneous task input. Experiment 2 is designed to elicit stutters in normal speakers by inducing anxiety and fluctuations of attention, using electric shocks and a divided-attention speech task. Anxiety does not increase stutters, hut {{there is some evidence that}} it increases attention to auditory feedback. The divided-attention task succeeds in increasing stutters, and a control condition of masked auditory feedback reduces stutters. It is concluded that attention to auditory feedback plays a role in the stutters of normal speakers, but only when attention is divided or fluctuating, and that these findings are consistent with the view that pathological and normal stutters are related...|$|R

We explored how encoding time affects HP of faces by manipulating exposure duration of the study or test face in a sequential matching composite task. HP was observed for exposure as rapid as 50 ms, and was unaffected by whether exposure of the study or test face was limited. Holistic effects emerge as soon as performance is above chance, and are not larger at rapid exposure durations. Limiting exposure at study vs. test did have differential effects on response biases at the fastest exposure durations. These findings provide key constraints for understanding mechanisms of face recognition. These results are first to demonstrate that HP of faces emerges for very briefly presented faces, and that limited perceptual encoding time affects response biases and overall level of performance but not whether faces are processed holistically...|$|R
2500|$|Following {{the birth}} of the second Daniel, and {{possibly}} at earlier births, Katherine Chidley refused to undergo the Churching of women, a service prescribed in the Book of Common Prayer. She was not alone in this: the ceremony was suspect to Puritans, even of the fairly moderate kind. Particularly resented was the use of , with its striking spell-like verse 6, [...] "The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night." [...] Kathaerine, along with Judith Wright and five other women, was cited for refusing to be churched by the Peter Studley, the High Church incumbent of St Chad's, later in the year, during a canonical visitation under Thomas Morton, then Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield. Judith was the wife of George Wright, sometime bailiff of Shrewsbury, and the couple had son, Joshua, baptised on 25 April 1625: George Wright was one of the relatively small number accorded the title of Mr. in the register, showing that he was regarded as socially superior to artisans like Daniel Chidley. However, he was cited for allowing meetings to hear sermons and sing hymns in his home on Sunday evenings, and it is known that these were centred on Julines Herring, the town's public preacher, of whom the Wrights were key supporters. Studley deferred to Morton's judgement: [...] "whether Action of gathering together may be termed a conventicle we refer to your honorable court to judge and determine." [...] Katherine and her husband were also among twenty parishioners presented to the Consistory court for <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>attend</b> church. This may suggest that they had already sought to form a conventicle or separatist group. However, William Rowley, another former bailiff, was cited with them, although he was certainly not a separatist but a leader of the Puritan faction on the corporation and a close supporter of the Presbyterian Herring.|$|E

40|$|Background Public {{hospitals}} have experienced budget constraints but as demand for admissions {{has been growing}} at the same time, occupancy levels have been increasing. As emergency and urgent admissions are given priority, the effect has been not just longer waiting times and larger waiting lists for non-urgent admissions, but also frequent cancellations of elective surgery, thus adding to patients? waiting time. Consequently, {{there have been a}} number of attempts to reduce elective surgical waiting lists. The Auburn Elective Surgical Program (AESP) was a pilot program funded by the NSW Health Department, to improve elective surgery for patients in Western Sydney Area Health Service (WSAHS). The program commenced 19 th July 2001 and ended 15 th November 2001. Initially, the program targeted three specific surgical procedures, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, hernia repair, and haemorrhoidectomy, and was expanded to include thyroidectomy, ligation and stripping of varicose veins and endoscopy. The program sought to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of administrative and clinical aspects of elective surgery by: > Using spare operating theatre capacity at Auburn Hospital; > the use of a new booking and waiting list system, managed by a nurse co-ordinator, which offered suitable patients a definite date for surgery; > increasing surgical sessions by paying participating surgeons on a fee for service basis; > however, surgery could be performed by a surgeon other than their treating surgeon; > re-structuring elective surgical sessions to eliminate meal breaks; > planning post discharge care so that surgery could be performed on a day only basis. The Centre for Health Economics Research and Evaluation (CHERE) was commissioned to undertake an independent evaluation of the AESP. This study has examined the throughput, health outcomes, costs and patient satisfaction. Throughput data on the program were defined as time spent on the waiting list, number of <b>failures</b> <b>to</b> <b>attend</b> planned surgery, average length of stay, and number of surgical interventions. Health consequences were defined as complications, unplanned readmissions to hospital, wound infection after surgery, mortality, percentage of same day admissions and conversion rate to open cholecystectomy. Costs were estimated from a health service perspective. Patient acceptability was assessed by the proportion of eligible patients having their surgery under the AESP, and patient satisfaction by questionnaire.
