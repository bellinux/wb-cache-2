5|$|Habsburg {{was laid}} <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino {{shipyard}} in Trieste on 13 March 1899. She was launched on 9 September 1900, after which fitting-out work was conducted. The ship was finally finished by December 1902; she was commissioned into the Austro-Hungarian fleet on the 31st of that month. Árpád followed Habsburg three months later; she was laid <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the STT shipyard on 10 June 1899 and launched on 11 September 1901. She was commissioned into the fleet on 15 June 1903. Babenberg, the last ship of the three, was laid <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the STT dockyard on 19 January 1901.

5|$|Texas {{began its}} third {{possession}} with 7:58 {{remaining in the}} quarter. From the 28-yard line, running back Shon Mitchell gained 14 yards and a first <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the 42-yard line. Brown then completed a 26-yard pass to Adams, who earned a first <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the Tech 32-yard line. Now in Tech territory, Mitchell gained eight yards on a run {{to the left side}} of the field. On second down, Williams ran straight ahead for a first <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the Tech 17-yard line. Mitchell then advanced to the 12-yard line on a running play, but Brown threw an incomplete pass on second down. Facing a third down and needing five yards, Texas was stopped for a short gain, but Tech was called for an offsides penalty. The five yards negated the third-down stop and gave Texas a first <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the six-yard line of Virginia Tech. Two plays later, Brown completed a pass to tight end Pat Fitzgerald, who ran into the end zone for a touchdown. The subsequent extra point kick was good, and Texas took a 70 lead with 4:32 remaining in the first quarter.|$|E

5|$|The kick {{was stopped}} at the State five-yard line, and with 3:56 {{remaining}} in the first quarter, State was pinned deep in its half of the field. After a running play gained four yards, State earned a first <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the 11-yard line with a seven-yard pass. After the first down, Rix fumbled the ball, recovered it, and was sacked by the Tech defense at the State nine-yard line. Two long rushing plays made up the lost yardage, and State earned a first <b>down</b> <b>at</b> their 27-yard line. From there, Rix completed a 44-yard pass to Javon Walker for a first <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the Tech 29-yard line. In the final seconds of the quarter, Rix attempted a touchdown pass, but the ball fell incomplete. With one quarter elapsed, Virginia Tech led, 30.|$|E

5|$|Virginia Tech {{began the}} quarter with a first <b>down</b> <b>at</b> its 29-yard line. After Williams carried {{the ball for}} a four-yard gain, Taylor {{completed}} a 14-yard pass to Andre Smith for a first <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the Tech 47-yard line. Two plays gained only one yard, then Taylor completed a 46-yard throw to Coale for a first <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the Florida State 6-yard line. Three plays later, Taylor ran five yards into the end zone, finishing an 11-play, 82-yard drive that spanned two quarters. Tech increased its margin to 41–24, but as Virginia Tech attempted the extra point, Florida State's Nigel Bradham disrupted and blocked the kick. Bradham scooped up the loose ball and returned it {{the length of the}} field to the opposite end zone for an unusual defensive two-point conversion.|$|E

5|$|Cincinnati's offense {{took over}} at the spot of the {{interception}} and immediately began moving down the field. Pike completed three consecutive passes: a five-yard pass to Gilyard, a 10-yard throw to Goodman, then a 31-yard toss to Gilyard. After the long throw, Cincinnati had a first <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the Virginia Tech 26-yard line. The Bearcats continued their drive after an incomplete pass by Pike with an 18-yard completion to Goebel that gave the Bearcats a first <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the Virginia Tech eight-yard line. Two plays later, however, Cincinnati's drive {{came to an end}} when Virginia Tech defender Stephan Virgil intercepted a pass from Pike to a player in the end zone, denying the Bearcats a chance to score. Virgil was downed in the end zone for a touchback, and Virginia Tech's offense started at its 20-yard line after the turnover.|$|E

5|$|Florida State's kickoff was fielded {{inside the}} Virginia Tech five-yard line and {{returned}} to the Tech eight-yard line. Tech gained five yards on two running plays, then Noel completed a 15-yard pass to Davis for a first <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the Tech 28-yard line. Noel and Jones each carried the ball, together gaining enough for a first <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the Tech 39-yard line. A completed pass and a short run by Jones resulted in another first down, this time at the 50-yard line. Florida State committed a five-yard offsides penalty, but the Hokies were unable to gain a first down on the Seminoles' side of the field. Rather than attempt to convert another fourth down, the Hokies punted the ball.|$|E

5|$|Following Tennessee's post-touchdown kickoff {{and a short}} kick return, the Virginia Tech offense {{began at}} its 24-yard line. The first Tech play of the quarter, a run up the middle by Edmonds, {{resulted}} in a 17-yard gain and a first down. Dwayne Thomas followed Edmonds' run {{with one of his}} own, advancing the ball to the 50-yard line. He pushed into Tennessee territory on the next play, a five-yard run that gave the Hokies a first <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the Tennessee 45-yard line. DeShazo then ran nine yards, and Tech gained a first down on the next play. Inside the Tennessee 35-yard line, however, the Volunteers' defense stiffened. DeShazo passed for a seven-yard gain, but the Hokies were unable to gain a first down until DeShazo scrambled for a 13-yard gain on fourth down. The run kept the Tech drive alive as the Hokies now had a first <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the Tennessee 14-yard line. Tennessee forced another third-down play, but the Hokies gained a first <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the Tennessee three-yard line with a pass from DeShazo to Thomas. Four plays later, the Hokies scored their first points of the game as Thomas dove across the goal line on fourth down. The subsequent extra point was good, and the Hokies cut Tennessee's lead to 217 with 5:17 remaining in the first half.|$|E
5|$|Following Virginia Tech's kickoff and a touchback, Florida State's offense {{started work}} at its 20-yard line.
