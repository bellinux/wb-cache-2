40|$|This paper {{reports on}} two new {{technologies}} for producing attractive new finishes on anodized architectural aluminum, {{which are the}} subject of patents. The first of these represents a revolutionary approach to the production of a fine uniform finish on architectural extrusions, which reduces caustic soda consumption by up to 75 % and minimizes the problems associated with effluent treatment and sludge removal. As well as these advantages, the technique developed eliminates defects such as <b>die</b> <b>lines,</b> scratches, etc., thus improving yields and reducing operating costs. A second major development is {{the development of a new}} electrolytic coloring system by means of which grey, blue, green, red and purple can be obtained from the same electrocoloring bath. This multi-colour process modifies the barrier layer with a specially developed curren...|$|E

40|$|The {{surface quality}} of {{aluminium}} extrusion products can be hampered by undesired surface features like <b>die</b> <b>lines</b> and pickups. In particular {{the presence of}} pickups is considered as undesirable. Surface pickups appear as intermittent torn marks on the aluminium extrusion products, often terminated with a protruding lump rising above the surface up to hundreds of microns in height. Using a model calculating initiation, growth as well as detachment of the lumps on the die bearing surface, the surface quality of aluminium extrusion products can be predicted. The results of the model can be presented in terms of surface quality diagrams, where contour lines of the (normalized) calculated number of lumps are presented in terms of exit speed and extrudate surface temperature. These diagrams are unique for a certain combination of geometry of the extrudate and the aluminium alloy {{and can be used}} to optimise process conditions with respect to surface quality within a certain process window. In order to validate the model, the size and number of pickups on the surface of a labscale extruded strip of AA 6063 have been measured. The results of the model are being compared to the experiments and show good agreement. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications...|$|E
40|$|Extrusion is {{a process}} in which a billet of most {{commonly}} aluminium is pushed through a die aperture of a desired cross sectional shape to produce lengths of extrudate. The type of streaking being investigated is due to differing thermomechanical conditions created due to changing cross sectional thicknesses of an extrusion profile. These differing thermomechanical conditions then may cause possible issues of differing distributions of intermetallics or grain orientations. At the start of this research many possible reasons for streaking were presented in literature but no single mechanism identified as being the primary cause. Therefore it needed to be identified what the mechanism for causing streaking on the product being investigated was due to. In addition the evolution of streaking after different etch durations needed to be examined as this type of finding has not been reported in literature. The streaking observed therefore might not be the same for all levels of material removal. To conduct this research on streaking, samples were submitted to differing chemical etch durations which produced different levels of material removal. The chemical etch differs {{in and out of the}} streak region and the different durations thus allow possible different types of streaking to be observed at different levels of material removal. In addition to chemical etching an electro-etching experiment was conducted so that primarily the grain boundaries were etched out to examine if these features play an insignificant, minor or major role in the streaking phenomenon. In summary there are two features that are etched on the surface of an extrudate, these are grain boundary grooves and etch pits. It was established through a thorough investigation that etch pits are the primary factor for streaking to occur with the grain boundary grooves being an insignificant factor for the extrusion product examined. For the top surface layers a glossy streak appeared and as more material was removed two dull parallel bands and then a single dull band streak appeared. The dull streaking was due to more pitting in the streak region and the glossy streaking due to less pitting and less densely distributed <b>die</b> <b>lines.</b> Overall the streaking observed most commonly in the manufacturing environment is the dull gloss streaks which occur after a longer etch duration and larger volume of surface material removal. Therefore the streaking phenomenon is mainly a subsurface issue but only to a small depth. Therefore if abrasive blasting in conjunction with a short etch duration is used the issue of streaking created by etching can be resolved...|$|E
40|$|Extrusion is a {{continuous}} solid state deformation process which {{is widely used}} in the aluminium industry. The demand for aluminium extrudates are growing and extruders are pressurized to extrude products {{as fast as possible}} without lowering the quality of the product. Important extrusion parameters and conditions are exit temperature, extrusion speed and alloy composition. It is widely accepted in extrusion industry that extrusion surface defects increase when the extrusion speed and exit temperature are increased for a constant alloy. One of the major surface defects is the so-called die pick-up and it is presently uncertain if increase with extrusion speed (from a low 25 m/min) would result in an increase of the number of die pick-up defect. Die pick-up appears like a scratch mark or comet {{on the surface of the}} extrudate which damages the appearance. Previous research suggests that second phase particles, eutectic reactions (555 °C - 600 °C), extrusion process conditions and die conditions may influence the cause of die pick-up. However the influencing factors for die pick-up are not well established. The research started by determining the lowest melting temperature for AA 6060 alloy as this temperature limit the highest temperature above which incipient melting starts. This temperature corresponds to the eutectic melting temperature for AA 6060 alloy. Eutectic melting was only detected above 610 °C and therefore the exit temperature could be increased to a maximum of 610 °C. For an AA 6 xxx alloy system the lowest melting temperature is 555 °C if Mg 2 Si and excess silicon were present. However as Mg 2 Si may have fully dissolved into the solid solution, no reaction can take place. A preliminary investigation was conducted to study the characteristics of the newly installed extrusion control and monitoring system. Through this study the relationship between the set extrusion speed and the actual extrusion speed was established. It was found that the actual extrusion speed was lower than the set extrusion speed and was further complicated by the capacity limit of the extrusion pressure. Exit temperature measurements were accurate, however it was measured about 1 m away from the die exit. Experiments were carried out to estimate the exit temperature drop and hence the exit temperature measurements were corrected accordingly. Thus, the aim of the present research was to establish the relationship between die pick-up and extrusion conditions (extrusion speed, exit temperature and die condition) and to propose the likely formation mechanism for die pick-up. In this research AA 6060 alloy was used and was extruded at 25 m/min, 30 m/min, 35 m/min, 40 m/min and 45 m/min. The exit temperature was found to increases from 542 °C to 567 °C. Three types of die pick-up was identified which were named as normal pick-up, die line pick-up and lump pick-up. Normal pick-up occurred regardless of the extrusion speed and exit temperature; however the amount of normal pick-up did not increase when the extrusion speed was increased. Die line pick-up occurred when the extrusion speed was 45 m/min and appeared only on the <b>die</b> <b>lines.</b> Lump pick-up is not significant since it was very rare. AA 6060 (0. 4 %Mg and 0. 5 %Si) alloy has about 0. 27 % excess silicon and therefore at 555 °C, Mg 2 Si particles react with aluminium and excess silicon to form liquid. However normal pick-up and die line pick-up still occurred at temperatures lower and higher than 555 °C and therefore it confirms that eutectic reactions do not influence formation of pick-up. Therefore die pick-up is most likely to be caused due to a mechanical process rather than a metallurgical process...|$|E
