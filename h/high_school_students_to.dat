5|$|For {{more than}} 10 years, THSRC {{has been devoted}} to the {{preservation}} of the pheasant-tailed jacana, a type of bird that is considered endangered in Taiwan. With NT$50 million invested, the first artificial habitat recovery project was completed in collaboration with the local government, country development organizations and non-profit organizations. The pheasant-tailed jacana population in Tainan, Taiwan, which at one point numbered less than 50, has increased to over 300. In 2007, the recovery habitat was officially renamed “Pheasant-tailed Jacana Eco-Educational Nature Park” and since then, it has opened to the public. To educate students in matters concerning environmental protection, every year THSRC arranges for elementary and junior <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> visit Pheasant-tailed Jacana Eco-Educational Nature Park(台南官田—水雉生態教育園區), where they are able to learn about the beauty of Taiwan’s natural habitats.|$|E

Port Charlotte's unit is a member of NJROTC Area Seven, and is known for service to its community.|$|E
5|$|Several {{recent studies}} have shown that adding seductive details does not have a {{significant}} impact on learner outcomes. Park et al. (2011) looked at cognitive load theory to explain these controversial results. The experiment asked <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> learn about biology using a multimedia environment (one with seductive details and one without). The experiment also varied the cognitive load for the students. The results showed that students performed significantly higher when seductive details were present in a low cognitive load environment as compared with all other conditions. Another study by Park et al. (2015) showed that while seductive details were detrimental to learning in high cognitive load text conditions, seductive details actually improved motivation and learning outcomes in narration conditions where the cognitive load was low. This means that slideshows or webcasts with well-prepared narration that use motivating bits of information increase learner motivation.|$|E
