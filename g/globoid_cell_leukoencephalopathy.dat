40|$|<b>Globoid</b> <b>cell</b> leukodystrophy, or Krabbe’s disease, is {{a severe}} {{disorder}} {{of the central}} and peripheral nervous system caused {{by the absence of}} galactocerebrosidase (GALC) activity. Herein, we describe the clinical, neuropathological, histochemical, and immunohistological features observed in rhesus macaques affected with Krabbe’s disease. Clinical signs included pronounced muscle tremors of head and limbs, difficulty ambulating, ataxia, hypermetria, proprioceptive deficits, and respiratory abnormalities. Histopathologically, all animals presented with evidence of demyelination in the peripheral and central nervous systems and accumulation of mononuclear and multinuclear <b>globoid</b> <b>cells</b> in the cerebral and cerebellar white matter associated with severe gliosis. Using immunohistochemistry and multi-label confocal microscopy, it was determined that <b>globoid</b> <b>cells</b> were CD 68 +, HAM 56 +, LN 5 +, CD 163 +, IBA- 1 +, and Glut- 5 +, suggesting that both peripheral blood-derived monocytes/macrophages and resident parenchymal microglia gave rise to <b>globoid</b> <b>cells.</b> Interestingly, many of the <b>globoid</b> <b>cells</b> and parenchymal microglia with a more ameboid morphology expressed HLA-DR, indicating immune activation. Increased expression of iNOS, TNF-α, and IL- 1 β were observed in the affected white matter, colocalizing with <b>globoid</b> <b>cells,</b> activated microglia, and astrocytes. Cytokine mRNA levels revealed markedly increased gene expression of CCL 2 in the brain of affected macaques. CCL 2 -expressing cells were detected throughout the affected white matter, colocalizing with GFAP+ cells and astrocytes. Collectively, these data suggest that dysregulation of monocyte/macrophage/microglia and up-regulation of certain cytokines may contribute to the pathogenesis of Krabbe’s disease...|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{dissertation}} was {{to examine}} the pathogenic potential of microglia in <b>globoid</b> <b>cell</b> leukodystrophy (GLD). We determined that psychosine, the pathogenic lipid toxin that accumulates in GLD, induced microglial transformation to <b>globoid</b> <b>cells</b> in vitro. Psychosine also induced matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) - 3 in cultured glia. This mirrored the elevated expression of MMP- 3 in the central nervous system (CNS) of twitcher mice, a murine model of GLD. Pharmacological inhibition or genetic ablation of MMP- 3 blocked psychosine-induced <b>globoid</b> <b>cell</b> formation in vitro. These findings indicate that MMP- 3 mediated psychosine-induced <b>globoid</b> <b>cell</b> formation. These findings were the first to relate the putative functions of MMPs in the CNS pathogenesis of a leukodystrophy. We next determined the effects of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in GLD pathology. We determined that tenascin-c (TnC), an ECM molecule, was aberrantly expressed in the brain of murine and human GLD. We determined that TnC enhances both psychosine-induced MMP- 3 expression and globoid cel...|$|R
40|$|<b>Globoid</b> <b>cell</b> {{leukodystrophy}} (Krabbe disease) is {{a neurological}} disorder of infants caused by genetic deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme β-galactosylceramidase leading to accumulation of the neurotoxic metabolite 1 -β-d-galactosylsphingosine (psychosine) {{in the central}} nervous system. Angiogenesis plays {{a pivotal role in}} the physiology and pathology of the brain. Here, we demonstrate that psychosine has anti-angiogenic properties by causing the disassembling of endothelial cell actin structures at micromolar concentrations as found in the brain of patients with <b>globoid</b> <b>cell</b> leukodystrophy. Accordingly, significant alterations of microvascular endothelium were observed in the post-natal brain of twitcher mice, an authentic model of <b>globoid</b> <b>cell</b> leukodystrophy. Also, twitcher endothelium showed a progressively reduced capacity to respond to pro-angiogenic factors, defect that was corrected after transduction with a lentiviral vector harbouring the murine β-galactosylceramidase complementary DNA. Finally, RNA interference-mediated β-galactosylceramidase gene silencing causes psychosine accumulation in human endothelial cells and hampers their mitogenic and motogenic response to vascular endothelial growth factor. Accordingly, significant alterations were observed in human microvasculature from brain biopsy of a <b>globoid</b> <b>cell</b> leukodystrophy case. Together these data demonstrate that β-galactosylceramidase deficiency induces significant alterations in endothelial neovascular responses that may contribute to central nervous system and systemic damages that occur in <b>globoid</b> <b>cell</b> leukodystrophy...|$|R

40|$|<b>Globoid</b> <b>cell</b> {{leukodystrophy}} is a lysosomal {{storage disease}} {{characterized by the}} loss of galactocerebrosidase. Galactocerebrosidase loss leads to the accumulation of psychosine and subsequent oligodendrocyte cell death, demyelination, macrophage recruitment, and astroglial activation and proliferation. To date, no studies have elucidated the mechanism of glial cell activation and cytokine and chemokine up-regulation and release. We explored a novel explanation {{for the development of the}} pathological changes in the early stages of <b>globoid</b> <b>cell</b> leukodystrophy associated with toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 up-regulation in the hindbrain and cerebellum as a response to dying oligodendrocytes. TLR 2 up-regulation on microglia/macrophages coincided with morphological changes consistent with activation at 2 and 3 weeks of age. TLR 2 up-regulation on activated microglia/macrophages resulted in astrocyte activation and marked up-regulation of cytokines/chemokines. Because oligodendrocyte cell death is an important feature of <b>globoid</b> <b>cell</b> leukodystrophy, we tested the ability of TLR 2 reporter cells to respond to oligodendrocyte cell death. These reporter cells responded in vitro to medium conditioned by psychosine-treated oligodendrocytes, indicating the likelihood that oligodendrocytes release a TLR 2 ligand during apoptosis. TLRs are a member of the innate immune system and initiate immune and inflammatory events; therefore, the identification of TLR 2 as a potential driver in the activation of central nervous system glial activity in <b>globoid</b> <b>cell</b> leukodystrophy may provide important insight into its pathogenesis...|$|R

40|$|<b>Globoid</b> <b>cell</b> {{leukodystrophy}} (GLD) or Krabbe disease, is a fatal {{demyelinating disease}} attributed to mutations in the galactocerebrosidase (GALC) gene. Loss of function mutations in GALC result in accumulation of the glycolipid intermediate, galactosylsphingosine (psychosine). Due to the cytotoxicity of psychosine, {{it has been}} hypothesized that accumulated psychosine underlie the pathophysiology of GLD. However, the cellular mechanisms of GLD pathophysiology remain unclear. <b>Globoid</b> <b>cells,</b> multinucleated microglia/macrophages in {{the central nervous system}} (CNS), are a defining characteristic of GLD. Here we report that exposure of primary glial cultures to psychosine induces the expression and the production of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) - 3 that mediated a morphological transformation of microglia into a multinucleated <b>globoid</b> <b>cell</b> type. Additionally, psychosine-induced <b>globoid</b> <b>cell</b> formation from microglia was prevented by either genetic ablation or chemical inhibition of MMP- 3. These effects are microglia-specific as peripheral macrophages exposed to psychosine did not become activated or express increased levels of MMP- 3. In the brain from twitcher mice, a murine model of human GLD, elevated MMP- 3 expression relative to wild-type littermates was contemporaneous with disease onset and further increased with disease progression. Further, bone marrow transplantation (BMT), currently the only therapeutically beneficial treatment for GLD, did not mitigate the elevated expression of MMP- 3 in twitcher mice. Hence, elevated expression of MMP- 3 in GLD may promote microglial responses to psychosine that may represent an important pathophysiological process in this disease and its treatment...|$|R
40|$|Summary: We report {{imaging and}} gross {{pathologic}} find-ings from two cases of Krabbe disease {{in which there}} was marked enlargement of the intracranial optic nerves. Nu-merous <b>globoid</b> <b>cells</b> were observed in the optic nerves at autopsy in one case.

Krabbe’s disease (<b>globoid</b> <b>cell</b> leukodystrophy) is a disorder of lysosomal function that results in ac-cumulation of galactocerebroside and psychosine in macrophages and is associated with demyelination and dysmyelination of cerebral white matter. Pre-viously described imaging findings with Krabbe’s disease include foci of increased attenuation on CT scans early in the disease, patchy foci of abnormal signal in the white matter on MR images, and white matter volume loss later in the disease.

40|$|<b>Globoid</b> <b>cell</b> {{leukodystrophy}} (Krabbe’s disease) {{is one of}} {{the classic}} genetic leukodystrophies first described by Krabbe in 1916. 1 It is inherited as an autosomal recessive disorder. Typically, it is an early-onset, rapidly progressive, and invari-ably fatal disease of infants characterized by nearly exclu-sive manifestations of white-matter involvement. However, patients with more slowly progressive juvenile and adult forms are being uncovered with increasing frequency. Rapid and complete loss of myelin and the oligodendrocytes, reac-tive astrocytic gliosis, and infiltration of the unique “globoid cells ” are the pathologic hallmarks of the disease. 2 In 1970, genetic deficiency of galactosylceramidase was identified as the underlying cause of human and canine <b>globoid</b> <b>cell</b> leukodystrophy. 3, 4 It was also demonstrated early that there was no overt accumulation of galactosylceramide in the brain of patients with Krabbe’s disease, 5 in contrast to an equivalent disease, metachromatic leukodystrophy, in which abnormal sulfatide accumulation had been well established since the first report by Jatzkewitz. 6 There were other obser-vations in <b>globoid</b> <b>cell</b> leukodystrophy that provided a puz-zling contrast in regard to those with metachromatic leukodystrophy, even though the two diseases are meta-bolically closely related.

5000|$|Like MLD, Krabbe {{disease is}} {{another type of}} {{leukodystrophy}} with autosomal recessive inheritance that {{is the result of}} a lysosomal storage disorder. It is due to a deletion in exon 16 of the GALC gene that causes a frameshift mutation leading to a premature stop codon. The GALC gene, found on chromosome 14 at position 31 (14q31), codes for the enzyme beta-galactocerebrosidase (GALC). GALC is a lysosomal enzyme responsible for the catabolism of galactolipids, especially psychosine, that are heavily distributed throughout the brain. A deficiency in GALC thus causes a buildup of these fatty acids known as “globoid” macrophages that destroy oligodendrocytes, thereby inhibiting myelin formation. [...] Because of the presence of these <b>globoid</b> <b>cells,</b> clustered near white matter, Krabbe Disease often goes by the name <b>Globoid</b> <b>Cell</b> Leukodystrophy. Furthermore, new research has shown that Krabbe Disease and <b>Globoid</b> <b>Cell</b> Leukodystrophy may be distinct disease entities due to the secretion of inflammatory mediators by natural killer cells in some cases. This research has shown that Natural Killer cells have receptors (TDAG8) for certain glycosphingolipids that build up in an individual with leukodystrophy, again due to insufficient GALC levels, and when bound, target the Natural Killer cells for destruction thereby preventing their cytotoxic effects. These sphingolipids have been identified as galactosyl sphingosine and glycosyl sphingosine and are not present in unaffected individuals.|$|R

40|$|Although {{a number}} of {{cellular}} components of cytokinesis have been identified, {{little is known about}} the detailed mechanisms underlying this process. Here, we report that the lipid metabolite psychosine (galactosylsphingosine), derived from galactosylceramide, induced formation of multinuclear cells from a variety of nonadherent and adherent cells due to inhibition of cytokinesis. When psychosine was added to the human myelomonocyte cell line U 937, which was the most sensitive among the cell lines tested, cleavage furrow formed either incompletely or almost completely. However, abnormal contractile movement was detected in which the cellular contents of one of the hemispheres of the contracting cell were transferred into its counterpart. Finally, the cleavage furrow disappeared and cytokinesis was reversed. Psychosine treatment also induced giant clots of actin filaments in the cells that probably consisted of small vacuoles with filamentous structures, suggesting that psychosine affected actin reorganization.
