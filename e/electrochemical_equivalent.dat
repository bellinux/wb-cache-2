Utilizing a UV-filtered Xe lamp, various perylene diimides and indanthrones have been observed to preferentially oxidize water to evolve O 2 in alkaline IO 3 -/I-solution, while phthalocyanine and quinacridones reduced water to evolve H 2. Voltammetric study of Ir, Pt, and Ni co-catalyst materials provided a means of comparing their ability to use the iodine species as electron donors and acceptors. Iodate reduction on Ir appeared to be much faster than iodide oxidation, possibly explaining why Ir is a better co-catalyst for O 2 evolution under these conditions.

Novel synthetic MLPA probes were designed to include a unique barcode sequence in each amplified gene. Capture probes complementary to each of the barcode sequences were immobilized on each electrode of a low-cost electrode microarray manufactured on standard printed circuit board (PCB) substrates. The functionalised electrodes were exposed to the single-stranded MLPA products and following hybridization, a horseradish peroxidase (HRP) -labelled DNA secondary probe complementary to the amplified strand completed the genocomplex, which was electrochemically detected following substrate addition. The electrode arrays fabricated using PCB technology exhibited an excellent <b>electrochemical</b> performance, <b>equivalent</b> to planar photolithographically-fabricated gold electrodes, but at a vastly reduced cost (&gt; 50 times lower per array).

In order to calculate the current efficiency of the alloy deposition process, it is necessary to know the mass of the alloy expected to be deposited per Faraday of electricity when no other electrode reaction than the alloy deposition occurs at the electrode surface.

The entire biochipi. e., working, reference, and counter electrodeswas constructed based on the screen-printing technique and exhibits eight working electrodes that could be individually addressed and grafted through a simple electrochemical procedure. Screen-printed electrode networks were functionalized electrochemically with 1 -ethyl- 3 -(3 dimethylaminopropyl) carbodidiimide according to a simple procedure. Single-stranded DNA with a C 6 −NH 2 linker at the 5 ‘-end was then covalently bound to the surface to act as probe for the direct, nonlabeled, detection of complementary strands in a conductive liquid medium. In the present system, the study was focused on a particular codon (273) localized in the exon 8 of the p 53 gene (20 mer, TTGAGGTGCATGTTTGTGCC). The integrity of the immobilized probes and its ability to capture target sequences was monitored through chemiluminescent detection following the hybridization of a peroxidase-labeled target.

40|$|Within {{the scope}} of the {{documented}} research project the focus was on investigating the modification of carbon fibers by electropolymerization and impregnation of carbon fiber rovings by means of aqueous polymer powder dispersions. Bringing to bear the outstanding mechanical characteristics of carbon fibers in composite materials requires a purposeful modification of the fiber surfaces adapted to the respective matrix material. Based on the natural conductivity of carbon fibers the method of electropolymerization offers itself. Among the variety of possibilities of electrochemical deposition of polymers, oxidative anodic polymerization of monomers, which leads to intrinsically conductive polymers, was selected. The formation of these polymers occurs in a step-by-step reaction analog to polycondensation. In the process, at least two <b>electrochemical</b> oxidation <b>equivalents</b> are required for each step of growth, with the polymers being deposited as conducting polymeric radical cations containing anions dispersed from the conducting salt used in the electrolytic bath. The investigation of deposited polymers was made by means of gravimetry, electrochemistry and scanning electron microscopy. Polyphenylene sulfide (PPS) was used as matrix material. Handling of this subject involved the problem whether it would not be appropriate to substitute powder impregnation for melt impregnation during the impregnation of rovings.

Site 2 was examined by utilizing succinate as electron donor and ferricyanide as electron acceptor from mitochondrial cytochrome c; the directly measured H+/ 2 e- ratio was close to 4. Energy-conserving site 3 was isolated for study with ferrocyanide or ascorbate plus tetramethylphenylenediamine as electron donors to cytochrome c and with oxygen as electron acceptor.

40|$|The acetylcholine-activated {{channel of}} chick myotube was studied using the patch-clamp method. Single channel current amplitudes were {{measured}} between - 300 and + 250 mV in solutions containing the permeant ions Cs+ and guanidine (G+). G+ has a relative permeability, PG/PCs, of 1. 6, but carries {{no more than}} half the current that Cs+ does, with an <b>equivalent</b> <b>electrochemical</b> driving force. Experiments using G+ revealed an asymmetry of the acetylcholine-activated channel, with G+ being more effective at reducing Cs+ currents when added to the outside than when added to the inside. The block caused by outside, but not inside, G+ was evident for both inward and outward currents. The block caused by outside G+ was voltage dependent, first increasing and then being partially relieved when the driving force was made more negative. Experiments with mixtures of Cs+ and G+ revealed anomalously low magnitudes for reversal potentials, relative to predictions based on the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation. These findings are consistent with a two-well, three-barrier Eyring rate model for ion flow, and demonstrate that a highly permeant ion, guanidine, can block asymmetrically by acting from within the voltage field of the acetylcholine-activated channel...|$|R
40|$|The {{glutamine}} transporter SN 1 {{has recently}} been identified {{as one of the}} major glutamine transporters in hepatocytes and brain astrocytes. It appears to be the molecular correlate of system N amino acid transport. Two different transport mechanisms have been proposed for this transporter. These are an electroneutral mechanism, in which glutamine uptake is coupled to an exchange of 1 Na+ and 1 H+, or an electrogenic mechanism coupled to the exchange of 2 Na+ against 1 H+. This study was performed to solve these discrepancies and to investigate the reversibility of the transporter. When SN 1 was expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, glutamine uptake was accompanied by a cotransport of 2 – 3 Na+ ions as determined by 22 Na+ fluxes. However, {{at the same time a}} rapid release of intracellular Na+ was observed indicating an active exchange of Na+ ions. The driving force of the proton <b>electrochemical</b> gradient was <b>equivalent</b> to that of the sodium electrochemical gradient. Acidification of the extracellular medium caused the transporter to run in reverse and to release glutamine. Determination of accumulation ratios at different driving forces were in agreement with an electroneutral 1 Na+-glutamine cotransport- 1 H+ antiport. Inward currents that were observed during glutamine uptake were much smaller than expected for a stoichiometric cotransport of charges. A slippage mode in the transporter mechanism and pH-regulated endogenous oocyte cation channels are likely to contribute to the observed currents...|$|R

T., which {{speaks volumes}} and has far {{reaching}} potentials and challenges for, innovative research, patents and, {{incorporation of the}} damascene process into the thin film labs. Upon eventual integration into the classroom environment further designed experiments, process improvement and senior design projects, electroplating will eventually replace the existing aluminum metal layers with copper for the advanced 1. 0 μm and O. 5 μm CMOS process currently used in the R. I. T. integrated circuit processing student run factory. From a ground zero approach with safety issues in mind the ramping up of this new tool had to be installed, a comprehensive manual rewritten, copper sulfate and sulfuric acid electrolyte chemicals added, then characterized and tested to determine its unique capabilities and deposition rates. The experiment used for gathering data incorporated the use of Faraday’s Law which states: “the amount of product formed is directly proportional to the charge passed” and “the mass of product formed {{is proportional to the}} <b>electrochemical</b> <b>equivalent</b> weight of the product. ” Following in these footsteps for the theoretical values the ampere-minutes were varied and mass calculated and then compared against the actual mass values by measuring the mass of the wafer before and after plating.

40|$|In this paper, the {{performance}} of Al-air batteries based on pure Al, Al– 0. 1 wt%Ga, Al– 0. 1 wt%In and Al– 0. 1 wt%Sn anodes in 1 M KOH solutions was investigated by galvanostatic discharge test. The electrochemical characteristics of the anodes were investigated by means of hydrogen collection, tafel polarization, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results reveal that compared with pure Al in 1 M KOH, Al– 0. 1 wt%In or Al– 0. 1 wt%Sn exhibits a lower self-corrosion rate and higher electrochemical activity because indium or tin with a high hydrogen evolution overpotential deposits on the aluminum surface. The Al– 0. 1 wt%Ga alloy is not an ideal anode of alkaline Al-air battery because the severe self-corrosion. The results of galvanostatic discharge at a current density from 1 to 40 mA cm− 2 indicate that the Al-air batteries based on both Al– 0. 1 wt%In and Al– 0. 1 wt%Sn anodes in 1 M KOH show excellent discharge performance and high anodic efficiencies. © 2015 The Electrochemical Society.

The model described caters for problems which can be represented geometrically in two dimensions; it is iterative in nature and uses the approximate cos 0 method to initiate the procedure. Subsequent iterations employ one of three formulations developed for correcting the tool profile to obtain workpiece equilibrium.

40|$|International audienceA {{theory is}} {{proposed}} for the dynamics of metal uptake by a spherical microorganism whose peripheral structure consists of a charged bioactive surface surrounded by a soft (ion-permeable) charged layer. The formalism explicitly considers the concomitant steady-state conductive diffusion transport of metals from bulk medium to the bioactive surface and the kinetics of intracellular metal internalisation described by a Michaelis-Menten mechanism. The spatial distribution of metals at the microorganism/solution interphase is derived from an explicit solution of the Nernst-Planck equation with differentiated metal diffusion coefficients {{inside and outside the}} microorganism soft surface layer. The metal concentration profile involves the interphasial electrostatic potential distribution governed by the Poisson-Boltzmann equation accounting for the dielectric permittivity gradient across the soft layer/solution interface. The resulting metal uptake flux is rationalized in terms of dimensionless metal-biosurface affinity and the ratio between limiting uptake flux and limiting conductive diffusion flux. Both parameters depend on background electrolyte concentration, microorganism soft surface composition and geometry via their connection to a Boltzmann surface term and a factor expressing the electrostatically-driven retardation or acceleration of metal diffusion. Illustrations demonstrate how metal transport dynamics impacts biouptake depending on electrolyte concentration and on the key bio-physico-chemical properties of the biointerphase. The mathematical framework is then applied to practical situations where a swarm of charged microorganisms deplete metals under steady-state transport conditions. Several depletion kinetic regimes are evaluated as a function of medium salinity and microorganism electrostatic features. Expressions of their characteristic timescales are derived and analogies with <b>equivalent</b> <b>electrochemical</b> circuits are formulated...|$|R

40|$|Crevice {{corrosion}} {{is currently}} mostly studied using {{either one of}} two techniques depending on the information desired. The first method involves two multicrevice formers or washers fastened {{on both sides of}} a sample plate. This technique provides exposure information regarding the severity of crevice corrosion (depth, position, frequency of attack) but delivers little or no electrochemical information. The second method involves the potentiodynamic or potentiostatic study of an uncreviced sample in a model crevice solution or under a crevice former in aggressive solution where crevice corrosion may initiate and propagate and global current is recorded. However, crevice corrosion initiation and propagation behavior is highly dependent on exact position in the crevice over time. The distance from the crevice mouth will affect the solution composition, the pH, the ohmic potential drop and the true potential in the crevice. Coupled multi-electrode arrays (MEA) were used to study crevice corrosion in order to take in account spatial and temporal evolution of electrochemistry simultaneously. Scaling laws were used to rescale the crevice geometry while keeping the corrosion <b>electrochemical</b> properties <b>equivalent</b> to that of a natural crevice at a smaller length scale. one of the advantages was {{to be able to use}} commercial alloys available as wires electrode and, in the case of MEA, to spread the crevice corrosion over many individual electrodes so each one of them will have a near homogeneous electrochemical behavior. The initial step was to obtain anodic polarization curves for the relevant material in acid chloride solution which simulated the crevice electrolyte. using the software Crevicer{trademark}, the potential distribution inside the crevice as a function of the distance from the crevice mouth was determined for various crevice gaps and applied potentials, assuming constant chemistry throughout the crevice. The crevice corrosion initiation location x{sub crit} is the position where the potential drops to E{sub Flade}. Figure 1 illustrates the resulting x{sub crit} vs. G scaling laws for 316 Stainless Steel in 1 M HCl at 50 C. The coupled multi-wire array is composed of one hundred identical 316 Stainless Steel wires in a five by twenty formation inserted in a groove of a 316 Stainless Steel rod such that the ends of the wires are flush mounted with the rod. The 100 wires are coupled electrically through in-line zero resistance ammeters. The diameter of the wires (250 {micro}m) was chosen so that x{sub crit} (critical initiation distance from the crevice mouth) and the expected zone of crevice corrosion (predicted from the scaling law) would be larger than the radius of a single wire. The array created a flush mounted planar electrode with the surface/volume ratio obtained in planar crevices. The observation of the current evolution as a function of position inside and outside the crevice as function of time was made possible as illustrated in Figure 2 in 0. 6 M NaCl at 50 C...|$|R
