5|$|The best-known {{feature of}} the Church of Christ Pantocrator is the rich and {{colourful}} decoration of its exterior walls. The most lavishly decorated part {{of the church is}} the east side with the apse, and as a whole all sides of the church exhibit different ornamentation. Interchanging strips of three or four rows of bricks and carved stones, which create an optical pattern, are the most basic type of decoration used. Rows of blind arches, four-leaved floral motifs, triangular ornaments, circular turquoise ceramics and brick swastika friezes run along the east wall. Ousterhout likens the appearance of the church's superimposed arcades to an aqueduct; an earlier <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> configuration can be observed in the Cappadocian church of Çanlı Kilise near Aksaray, Turkey. The inclusion of swastikas in the decoration is considered unusual and curious to tourists. It is explained by the medieval use of the swastika {{as a symbol of the}} Sun.|$|E

In the subsequent rebuilding, 145 Main Street was redone in the Renaissance Revival style, with bracketed cornices and pediments and stone trim.

25|$|Like {{most of the}} city's other {{neighborhoods that}} grew during this period, the new housing of the South End {{took the form of}} {{attached}} rowhouses. Unlike the other neighborhoods, the construction of those houses was largely paid for by those who intended to live in them, instead of by developers building large groups of speculative housing. Foley's Row, the timber frame Greek Revival group at 159–169 Franklin Street, which was almost completely developed by 1850, is a rare <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> type within the district. Since residents worked and shopped near their houses, the neighborhood was pedestrian-friendly, with narrow streets and small-scale buildings. Along with its bending and non-parallel streets, this has led to it being described as having a European feel.|$|E
25|$|The main {{building}} {{was constructed in}} 1916, designed by the architectural firm of Arnold & Abbot. It, and the adjacent caretakers residence are in the Spanish Mission style and probably the earliest <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> style in the country. Following {{the completion of the}} {{main building}}, three smaller buildings were constructed in the same style; The Library block to the north, the Gymnasium to the south and a toilet block adjoining the main building. In the 1950s, a large Science block was constructed to the south of the main block in a modern style with metal windows. Further to the South again is a concrete Block from the early 1970s raised on Pilotis to give access to the upper playing fields. Between it and the 1920 Gymnasium is a large Gymnasium which was constructed in the mid 1970s and opened by the Prime Minister Robert Muldoon.|$|E
25|$|It {{seems that}} {{on the level of}} the organ, the leaf may be the {{ancestor}} of the flower, or at least some floral organs. When we mutate some crucial genes involved in flower development, we end up with a cluster of leaf-like structures. Thus, sometime in history, the developmental program leading to formation of a leaf must have been altered to generate a flower. There probably also exists an overall robust framework within which the floral diversity has been generated. An <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> is a gene called LEAFY (LFY), which is involved in flower development in Arabidopsis thaliana. The homologs of this gene are found in angiosperms as diverse as tomato, snapdragon, pea, maize and even gymnosperms. Expression of Arabidopsis thaliana LFY in distant plants like poplar and citrus also results in flower-production in these plants. The LFY gene regulates the expression of some gene belonging to the MADS-box family. These genes, in turn, act as direct controllers of flower development.|$|E

500|$|Many historians, notably Hugh Trevor-Roper, have {{suggested}} that the witch trials of the 16th and 17th centuries were a consequence of the religious struggles of the period, with both the Catholic and Protestant Churches determined to stamp out what they regarded as heresy. The trial of the Samlesbury witches is perhaps one clear <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> trend; it has been described as [...] "largely a piece of anti-Catholic propaganda", and even as a show-trial, to demonstrate that Lancashire, considered at that time to be a wild and lawless region, was being purged not only of witches but also of [...] "popish plotters" [...] (i.e. recusant Catholics).|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weeklys Alanna Nash {{also gave}} the album {{positive}} feedback, viewing the album to have [...] "enough boiling rhythms and brooding melodies {{to reflect the}} anger and disillusionment {{of the middle class}} in the '90s", calling the track [...] "She Thinks His Name Was John" [...] to be the best <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> idea. The song was eventually spawned as a single and was considered controversial for its storyline, which described a woman who contracts AIDS from a one-night stand. Due to its subject matter, the song garnered less of a response from radio and peaked at No. 15. Read My Mind became another major seller for McEntire and her label, selling three million copies by 1995 and certifying at 3× Multi-Platinum from the RIAA.|$|E
500|$|The CCU {{proposal}} {{recommended that}} {{the text of the}} definitions of all the base units be either refined or rewritten changing the emphasis from explicit-unit to explicit-constant type definitions. Explicit-unit type definitions define a unit in terms of a specific <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> unit—for example in 1324 Edward II defined the inch as being the length of three barleycorns and since 1889 the kilogram has been defined as being the mass of the International Prototype Kilogram. In explicit-constant definitions, a constant of nature is given a specified value and the definition of the unit emerges as a consequence. For example, in 1983, the speed of light was defined to be exactly [...] metres per second and, since the second had been independently defined, the length of the metre could thus be derived.|$|E

500|$|Twentieth century critics tend {{to range}} in {{opinions}} on the play. F. Homes Dudden argues that [...] "The dialogue is smart; the plot, though insufficiently compact, is fairly ingenious; the characters [...] are conventional comic types [...] It deserved what in fact it achieved—a qualified success." [...] Robert Hume believes that [...] "The play is not, in truth, very good", that [...] "Fielding offers three minimally intertwined love plots", and that the narrative is [...] "clumsy". However, Rivero believes that this characterisation is [...] "unjust" [...] and that the play deserves more merit. The play, as Rivero argues, [...] "evinces what critics have identified as the quintessence of Fielding's art: its clear moral purpose, its conspicuous moral tone." [...] Thomas Lockwood argues that the play [...] "has been noticed mainly as it was Fielding's first play, or else as the <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> imitation of Congrevean form which supposedly marked his beginning in dramatic authorship. Beyond these impressions of the play, {{there is no real}} tradition of critical discussion." [...] Pagliaro, one of Fielding's biographers, simply states that [...] "By the standards of the day, the play neither failed nor succeeded, running four nights as it did." ...|$|E

500|$|Betjeman characterised Heber's {{style as}} {{consciously}} literary, with careful choices of adjectives and vivid figures of speech: [...] "poetic imagery was {{as important as}} didactic truth". A more recent analysis by J. R. Watson draws attention to Heber's tendency to deliver what he terms [...] "a rather obvious sermon", and to his mixing of powerful description with [...] "a rather trite moralism". A handful of Heber's hymns have survived into popular use into the 21st century. One whose popularity has waned is the missionary hymn [...] "From Greenland's Icy Mountains", written in 1819 {{as part of a}} country-wide campaign on behalf of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel (SPG). Watson describes this as [...] "a conspicuous <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> fervent belief to convert the world to Christianity which led Heber and others to lay down their lives in the mission field", and while widely sung until {{the second half of the}} 20th century, it was for instance omitted from the 1982 revision of the Episcopal Church hymnal. Betjeman felt that in the modern world, the words of this hymn seem patronising and insensitive to other beliefs, with references to [...] "...every prospect pleases and only man is vile", and to [...] "the heathen in his blindness [...] down to wood and stone". These phrases and the assumptions behind them offended Gandhi, who drew attention to them in a speech to the YMCA in Calcutta (Kolkata) in 1925: [...] "My own experience in my travels throughout India has been to the contrary ... is not vile. He is as much a seeker after truth as you and I are, possibly more so". Other Heber texts remain popular, and the Dictionary of North American Hymnology noted that most of his hymns remain in use.|$|E
500|$|In the October–December 1994 {{issue of}} the EPB's {{official}} newspaper, El Machete, the organization criticized the initiative of the Rosselló administration to amend the Constitution of Puerto Rico to eliminate the absolute right to bail, considering that it directly targeted the lower class. The group also questioned the reasons behind the governor's interest in changing {{the composition of the}} Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, questioning if it was due to an ideological majority that opposed statehood. After citing their perception that the millionaire campaign was [...] "full of personal insults and lies", blaming Romero Barceló for this. The EPB considered this a political move to guarantee a strategic position for the statehood movement, ultimately citing it as a [...] "struggle between the wealthy" [...] and arguing that the defeat of the initiative was a display of rejection towards political parties by the public. In a separate section, the EPB discussed the commonwealth, labeling it as a [...] "liberal status" [...] that was more reminiscent of neocolonialism than historical colonialism and citing the Jayuya uprising as [...] "a beacon that illuminates" [...] their goals, citing that it taught the independence movement both positive approaches and mistakes to avoid. Recognizing that continuing to act despite the end of the socialist bloc changed how they are perceived, the organization argued that the territorial status only led to [...] "more crime, more corruption and more abuse of power", that it affected the lower classes and prevented a resolution to the status quo, urging its membership to take the <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> uprising to focus its offensive on the [...] "many weak flanks" [...] of the commonwealth.
