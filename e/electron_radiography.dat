The {{requirement of the}} angle and position correction on the target from imaging system can be approximately realized by fine tuning the quadrupoles used in the achromat. The imaging system is designed by fully considering the limitation from the laboratory and beam diagnostics devices space. Two kinds of imaging system are designed and both show a good performance of imaging by beam trajectory simulation. The details of the beam optical requirement and optimization design are presented here.

40|$|We studied four {{patients}} with {{acute renal failure}} associated with nontraumatic rhabdomyolysis to evaluate the presence and progression of calcium deposits in damaged muscle tissue. Conventional and <b>electron</b> <b>radiography</b> and technetium- 99 m diphosphonate (TcDP) scans were done during the oliguric phase of acute renal failure and repeated after renal function returned to normal. Three patients showed deposits of calcium by conventional radiography and all by <b>electron</b> <b>radiography</b> and TcDP during the oliguric period. When the patients recovered renal function and muscle injuries healed, calcium deposits disappeared. The results show that calcium deposits in damaged muscle occur during the oliguric phase of acute renal failure due to rhabdomyolysis and the calcification disappears with recovery of renal failure; and TcDP scans are the most sensitive method of detecting calcium deposits in these patients. S E V E R E HYPOCALCEMIA is usually seen during the oli-guric phase of acute renal failure associated with non-traumatic rhabdomyolysis, and hypercalcemia may occur in 20 % to 25 % of such patients during the diuretic phase (1 - 7). These disturbances in serum calcium concentration {{have been attributed to}} calcium deposits in damaged muscles during oliguria and remobilization of calcium from muscles to extracellular space during polyuria (1, 2). Meroney and colleagues (8) have shown in experimen-tal animals that calcium is deposited in damaged muscles and the magnitude of calcium deposits is markedly in-creased with uremia. Data on calcium deposits in dam-aged muscles of {{patients with}} nontraumatic rhabdomyo-lysis and acute renal failure are limited. To our knowl-edge, three patients with radiologic evidence of calcium deposits in damaged muscles have been reported (3, 9, 10). We have studied four patients with nontraumatic rhab-domyolysis and acute renal failure to evaluate calcium deposits in damaged muscles. We used three tech-niques—regular and <b>electron</b> <b>radiography</b> and techneti-um- 99 m diphosphonate (TcDP) scan—for this purpose...|$|E
40|$|Transient {{electric}} fields, {{which are}} an important but hardly explored parameter of laser plasmas, can now be diagnosed experimentally with combined ultrafast temporal resolution and field sensitivity, using femtosecond to picosecond electron or proton pulses as probes. However, poor spatial resolution poses great challenges to simultaneously recording both the global and local field features. Here, we present a direct 3 D measurement of a transient electric field by time-resolved <b>electron</b> schlieren <b>radiography</b> with simultaneous 80 -Êm spatial and 3. 7 -ps temporal resolutions, analyzed using an Abel inversion algorithm. The electric field here is built up {{at the front of}} an aluminum foil irradiated with a femtosecond laser pulse at 1. 9 × 1012 W/cm 2, where electrons are emitted at a speed of 4 × 106 m/s, resulting in a unique gpeak. valleyh transient electric field map with the field strength up to 105 V/m. Furthermore, time-resolved schlieren radiography with charged particle pulses should enable the mapping of various fast-evolving field structures including those found in plasma-based particle accelerators...|$|R
40|$|The {{morphology}} {{and functional}} occlusion of the cheekteeth of 57 dugongs Dugong dugon {{of both sexes}} were examined using reflected light and scanning <b>electron</b> microscopy, <b>radiography,</b> hardness testing and skull manipulation. The functional morphology of the horny oral pads was also described. Mouthparts and body size allometry was examined for ontogenetic and gender-related trends. We found that the worn erupted cheekteeth of the dugong are simple flat pegs composed of soft degenerative dentine. During occlusion, the mandible moves in a mainly antero-lingual direction, {{with the possibility of}} mandibular retraction in some individuals. Anterior parts of the cheektooth row may become non-functional as a dugong ages. As a function of body size, dugong cheekteeth are extremely small compared with those of other mammalian herbivores, and with other hindgut fermenters in particular. The morphology, small size and occlusal variability of the cheekteeth suggest that there has not been strong selective pressure acting to maintain an effective dentition. In contrast, great development of the horny pads and associated skull parameters and their lower size variability suggest that the horny pads may have assumed the major role in food comminution...|$|R

The precipitation hardening material type DIN 1. 4542 is a {{martensitic stainless steel}} containing approximately 3. 3 wt. % Cu and is strengthened by the precipitation of copper in the martensite matrix. Hydrogen assisted cracks generated in the heat-affected zone (HAZ) of solution treated and welded samples have been investigated.

40|$|We {{report on}} the {{development}} of radiation and electron sources based on laser-plasma acceleration for biomedical and nuclear applications, using both the table top TW laser at ILIL and the 220 TW FLAME laser system at LNF. We use the ILIL laser to produce wakefield electrons in a self-focusing dominated regime in a mm scale gas-jet to generate large, uniform beams of MeV electrons for <b>electron</b> <b>radiography</b> and radiobiology applications. This acceleration regime is described in detail and key parameters are given to establish reproducible and reliable operation of this source.

40|$|Using a {{high energy}} {{electron}} beam for the imaging of high density matter with both high spatial-temporal and areal density resolution under extreme states of temperature and pressure {{is one of}} the critical challenges in high energy density physics. When a charged particle beam passes through an opaque target, the beam will be scattered with a distribution that depends on the thickness of the material. By collecting the scattered beam either near or off axis, so-called bright field or dark field images can be obtained. Here we report on an <b>electron</b> <b>radiography</b> experiment using 45 MeV electrons from an S-band photo-injector, where scattered electrons, after interacting with a sample, are collected and imaged by a quadrupole imaging system. We achieved a few micrometers (about 4 micrometers) spatial resolution and about 10 micrometers thickness resolution for a silicon target of 300 - 600 micron thickness. With addition of dark field images that are captured by selecting electrons with large scattering angle, we show that more useful information in determining external details such as outlines, boundaries and defects can be obtained.

40|$|International audienceIn laser-plasma-based accelerators, {{an intense}} laser pulse drives a large {{electric}} field (the wakefield) which accelerates particles to high energies in distances much shorter than in conventional accelerators. These high acceleration gradients, {{of a few}} hundreds of gigavolts per metre, hold the promise of compact high-energy particle accelerators. Recently, several experiments have shown that laser-plasma accelerators can produce high-quality electron beams, with quasi-monoenergetic energy distributions at the 100 MeV level. However, these beams {{do not have the}} stability and reproducibility that are required for applications. This is because the mechanism responsible for injecting electrons into the wakefield is based on highly nonlinear phenomena, and is therefore hard to control. Here we demonstrate that the injection and subsequent acceleration of electrons can be controlled by using a second laser pulse. The collision of the two laser pulses provides a pre-acceleration stage which provokes the injection of electrons into the wakefield. The experimental results show that the electron beams obtained in this manner are collimated (5 mrad divergence), monoenergetic (with energy spread < 10 per cent), tuneable (between 15 and 250 MeV) and, most importantly, stable. In addition, the experimental observations are compatible with electron bunch durations shorter than 10 fs. We anticipate that this stable and compact electron source will have a strong impact on applications requiring short bunches, such as the femtolysis of water, or high stability, such as radiotherapy with high-energy <b>electrons</b> or <b>radiography</b> for materials science...|$|R
40|$|Background: Magnesium alloys are {{recommended}} {{as a potential}} material for osteosynthesis. It is known that storage-induced property modifications can occur in materials like aluminum. Thus {{the aim of this}} study was to analyze the influence of storage durations of up to 48 weeks on the biomechanical, structural, and degradation properties of the degradable magnesium alloy LAE 442. Methods: Extruded implants (n= 104; Ø 2. 5 mm× 25 mm) were investigated after storage periods of 0, 12, 24, and 48 weeks in three different sub-studies: (I) immediately after the respective storage duration and after an additional (II) 56 days of in vitro corrosion in simulated body fluid (SFB), and (III) 48 weeks in vivo corrosion in a rabbit model, respectively. In addition, the influence of a T 5 -heat treatment (206 °C for 15 h in an argon atmosphere) was tested (n= 26; 0 week of storage). Evaluation was performed by three-point bending, scanning <b>electron</b> microscopy, <b>radiography,</b> μ-computed tomography, evaluation of the mean grain size, and contrast analysis of precipitations (such as aluminum or lithium). Results: The heat treatment induced a significant reduction in initial stability, and enhanced the corrosion resistance. In vivo experiments showed a good biocompatibility for all implants. During the storage of up to 48 weeks, no significant changes occurred in the implant properties. Conclusions: LAE 442 implants can be safely used after up to 48 weeks of storage. DFG/SFB/ 59...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{continuing}} development of powerful laser systems has permitted {{to extend the}} interaction of laser beams with matter far into the relativistic domain in which extremely high electric and magnetic fields are generated. Thanks to these tremendous fields, that only plasma can support and sustain, new and compact approaches for producing energetic particle beams have been recently achieved. The incredible progress of these laser–plasma accelerators has allowed physicists to produce high quality beams of energetic radiation and particles. These beams have interesting properties such as shortness, brightness and spatial quality, and could lend themselves to applications in many fields, including medicine (radiotherapy, proton therapy, imaging), radiation biology (short-time-scale), chemistry (radiolysis), physics and material science (<b>radiography,</b> <b>electron</b> and photon diffraction), security (material inspection), and of course accelerator science. Stimulated by the advent of compact and powerful lasers, with moderate costs and high repetition rate, this research field has witnessed considerable growth {{in the past few}} years, and the promises of laser–plasma accelerators are in tremendous progress. The recent years in particular have seen spectacular progress in the acceleration of electrons and of ions, both in terms of energy and in terms of quality of the beams...|$|R
40|$|Today, {{cardiovascular}} diseases (CVDs) {{are the leading}} cause of death worldwide. Atherosclerosis, the thickening of the artery wall due to accumulating lipids, is one of the major causes. Generally assumed to be a disease of modern life-style related factors (smoking, obesity, hypertension), its history and epidemiology in the past are virtually unknown. Research on mummies from various geographic locations, time periods and socioeconomic backgrounds has revealed conclusive, albeit scant, evidence that atherosclerosis also affected past human populations. Little is known about the morphology of calcified atherosclerotic plaques that may be associated with human skeletal remains. Therefore, direct evidence of atherosclerosis from skeletal remains is largely absent. This paper presents five possible examples of calcified blood vessels which may represent atherosclerosis recovered from burials at Amara West, Sudan (1300 – 800 BC) and reviews other potential causes of arterial calcification. Calcifications were recovered from the chest area of three middle-adult individuals as well as from the abdominal area and alongside the femur of two more. Based on morphology, anatomical location, scanning <b>electron</b> microscopy and <b>radiography,</b> they are probably calcified arterial plaques. These findings are unique in the bioarchaeological record and indicate that people have experienced atherosclerosis for at least 3000 years...|$|R

40|$|High {{altitude}} (HA) -induced {{pulmonary hypertension}} {{may be due}} to a free radical-mediated reduction in pulmonary nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability. We hypothesised that the increase in pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) at HA would be associated with a net transpulmonary output of free radicals and corresponding loss of bioactive NO metabolites. Twenty-six mountaineers provided central venous and radial arterial samples at low altitude (LA) and following active ascent to 4559 m (HA). PASP was determined by Doppler echocardiography, pulmonary blood flow by inert gas re-breathing, and vasoactive exchange via the Fick principle. Acute mountain sickness (AMS) and high-altitude pulmonary oedema (HAPE) were diagnosed using clinical questionnaires and chest <b>radiography.</b> <b>Electron</b> paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, ozone-based chemiluminescence and ELISA were employed for plasma detection of the ascorbate free radical (A(·-)), NO metabolites and 3 -nitrotyrosine (3 -NT). Fourteen subjects were diagnosed with AMS and three of four HAPE-susceptible subjects developed HAPE. Ascent decreased the arterio-central venous concentration difference (a-cv(D)) resulting in a net transpulmonary loss of ascorbate, α-tocopherol and bioactive NO metabolites (P < 0. 05 vs. LA). This was accompanied by an increased a-cv(D) and net output of A(·-) and lipid hydroperoxides (P < 0. 05 vs. sea level, SL) that correlated against the rise in PASP (r = 0. 56 - 0. 62, P < 0. 05) and arterial 3 -NT (r = 0. 48 - 0. 63, P < 0. 05) that was more pronounced in HAPE. These findings suggest that increased PASP and vascular resistance observed at HA are associated with a free radical-mediated reduction in pulmonary NO bioavailability.
