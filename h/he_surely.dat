25|$|In the pre-dawn {{hours of}} 9 November 1913, the Isaac M. Scott, loaded with a cargo of coal worth $22,000 bound for Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States left Port Huron, Cleveland, Ohio, United States {{for the last}} time. She {{was one of several}} big freighters that passed out of the St. Clair River into Lake Huron and {{straight}} into the path of the deadliest storm in the Great Lakes history. Captain A. McArthur had been master of the Isaac M. Scott since her maiden voyage back in 1909 and sailed with 27 other men on the Isaac M. Scotts last voyage. Had he known how ugly the weather was about to become <b>he</b> <b>surely</b> would have never left port.|$|E
25|$|The erasures were {{sporadic}} and haphazard, {{with only}} the more visible and accessible images of Hatshepsut being removed; had it been more complete, we would not now have so many images of Hatshepsut. Thutmose III may have died before these changes were finished {{and it may be}} that he never intended a total obliteration of her memory. In fact, we have no evidence to support the assumption that Thutmose hated or resented Hatshepsut during her lifetime. Had that been true, as head of the army, in a position given to him by Hatshepsut (who was clearly not worried about her co-regent's loyalty), <b>he</b> <b>surely</b> could have led a successful coup, but he made no attempt to challenge her authority during her reign and, her accomplishments and images remained featured on all of the public buildings she built for twenty years after her death.|$|E
25|$|He was {{ten years}} old when his {{grandfather}} died and his mother ascended to the throne. His childhood and youth were lived quietly, as he was a mere infante in the shadow of his elder brother José, Prince of Brazil and 14th Duke of Braganza, the heir-apparent to the throne. Folklore has John as a rather uncultured youth, but according to Jorge Pedreira e Costa, he received as rigorous an education as José did. Still, a French ambassador of the time painted him in unfavorable colors, seeing him as hesitant and dim. The record of this period of his life is too vague for historians to form any definitive picture. Little is known of the substance of his education. <b>He</b> <b>surely</b> received instruction in religion, law, French, and etiquette, and would presumably have learned history through reading the works of Duarte Nunes de Leão and João de Barros.|$|E

25|$|If {{you accept}} that James Moore {{believed}} he won the first bicycle race, then, as <b>he</b> <b>surely</b> cannot have forgotten that his race was at least scheduled to be {{the second of the}} day at St Cloud, there must have been either something different about the first race – e.g. it was not exclusively for pedal machines – or the order of the events was changed so that his race took place first. My hypothesis assumes the former proposition, and is only partly reliant on whether the rules stated that the front wheels of the velocipedes in the second race were to be precisely 1 metre diameter as stated in your article. My main argument, however, is that the word velocipede was used generically to include all types of machine including even hobby-horses for which it was originally coined. They would surely have had wheels of less than one metre diameter.|$|E
25|$|While Eliot was in Europe, he {{was again}} {{presented}} {{with the opportunity to}} enter the world of active business. The Merrimack Company, one of the largest textile mills in the United States, tendered him an invitation to become its superintendent. In spite of the urgings of his friends and the attractiveness of what for the time was the enormous salary of $5000 (plus a good house, rent free), Eliot, after giving considerable thought to the offer, turned it down. One of his biographers speculated that <b>he</b> <b>surely</b> realized by this time that he had a strong taste for organizing and administration. This post would have given it scope. He must have felt, even if dimly, that if science interested him, it was not because he was first and last a lover of her laws and generalizations, not only because the clarity and precision of science was congenial, but because science answered the questions of practical men and conferred knowledge and power upon those who would perform the labors of their generation.|$|E
500|$|Excited at the prospect, Åkerfeldt agreed without {{consulting}} his bandmates or record label. While his bandmates {{liked the idea}} of recording two separate albums, Åkerfeldt had to convince the label: [...] "I had to lie somewhat... saying that we could do this recording very soon, it won't cost more than a regular single album." [...] With most of the material written, the band rehearsed just once before entering Nacksving Studios in 2002, and again with producer Steven Wilson in Studio Fredman. Under pressure to complete both albums simultaneously, Åkerfeldt said the recording process was [...] "the toughest test of our history." [...] After recording basic tracks, the band moved production to England to first mix the heavy album, Deliverance, with Andy Sneap at Backstage Studios. [...] "Deliverance was so poorly recorded, without any organisation whatsoever," [...] Åkerfeldt claimed, that Sneap [...] "is credited as a 'saviour' in the sleeve, as <b>he</b> <b>surely</b> saved much of the recording." ...|$|E

500|$|Writing for The Washington Post, Allison Stewart {{opined that}} the track {{describes}} an eccentric night of romance, beginning with [...] "a body full of liquor with a cocaine kicker" [...] {{and ending with}} [...] "you and me/Making love like gorillas". She concluded, [...] "for all its awfulness" [...] the song is the [...] "image shifter Mars needs". Idolator's Emily Tan commented [...] "the libidinous lyrics are disguised with epic guitars and Phil Collins-esque heavy drum combinations...strong enough to soundtrack a scene in a drama series". Jason Lipshutz of Billboard magazine similarly felt that the [...] "drums and keyboards are nicely overwhelming, but the overall concept floats {{too far away to}} make a dent on the listener". Day Hyman of Spin thought that the lyrics on the album [...] "desperately needed kick in the pants" [...] mainly noticed on [...] "Gorilla". He also drew comparisons on the [...] "Prince-channeling" [...] vibe. On the critical side, Amy Dawson of Metro described it as a [...] "Phil Collins-esque low point" [...] in the album, [...] "in which the button-eyed singer makes plans to go at it {{in the same way as}} said giant ape, all over a Phil Collins-esque synth/percussion combo backing… but by the time the jungle noises kick in, you think <b>he</b> <b>surely</b> must be in on the joke." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{reaction}} to News Knight has been mixed. Some {{have been critical}} of McDonald's own performances, claiming that he is a newsreader and therefore should not do comedy.

2500|$|Thus {{the work}} of Maimonides, {{notwithstanding}} the sharp attacks upon it, soon won general recognition as an authority of the first importance for ritual decisions. According to several authorities ("Yad Mal'akhi" [...] rule 26, pg 186), a decision may not be rendered in opposition to a view of Maimonides, even though the latter apparently militated against {{the sense of a}} Talmudic passage, for in such cases the presumption was that the words of the Talmud were incorrectly interpreted. Likewise: [...] "One must follow Maimonides even when the latter opposed his teachers, since <b>he</b> <b>surely</b> knew their views, and if he decided against them he must have disapproved their interpretation".|$|E
2500|$|In 1876 Dmitry Merezhkovsky joined {{an elite}} grammar school, the St. Petersburg Third Classic Gymnasium. Years spent there he {{described}} later by one word, [...] "murderous", remembering just one teacher as a decent person – [...] "Kessler the Latinist; well-meaning <b>he</b> <b>surely</b> never was, {{but at least}} had a kindly look." [...] At thirteen Dmitry started writing poetry, rather in the vein of Pushkin's [...] "Bakhchisarai Fountain" [...] as he later remembered. He became fascinated with the works of Molière {{to such an extent}} as to form a Molière Circle in the Gymnasium. The group had nothing political on its agenda, but still made the secret police interested. All of its members were summoned one by one to the Third Department's headquarters by the Politzeisky Bridge to be questioned. It is believed that only Sergey Merezhkovsky's efforts prevented his son from being expelled from the school.|$|E
2500|$|On June 5, 2007, Libby {{was sentenced}} to 30 months in prison, a fine of US$250,000, and two years of {{probation}} (supervised release) after the expiration of his prison term. According to The Washington Post, Judge Walton expressed his belief that the trial did not prove Libby knew that Plame worked in an undercover capacity when he disclosed her identity to several reporters. He added, however, that [...] "anybody at that high-level position had a unique and special obligation before they said anything about anything associated with a national security agency ... make every conceivable effort" [...] to verify their status before releasing information about them. Walton stated [...] "While {{there is no evidence}} that Mr. Libby knew what the situation was, <b>he</b> <b>surely</b> did not take any efforts to find out,...I think public officials need to know if they are going to step over the line, there are going to be consequences.... causes people to think our government does not work for them." ...|$|E

5000|$|According to Ahmadiyya belief, God {{has promised}} in the Qur'an {{to appoint a}} {{successor}} among the righteous. In this respect, verse 56 (55 if the Basmallah isn't counted) of Surah Al-Nur says: [...] Allah had promised to those among you who believe and do good works that <b>He</b> will <b>surely</b> make them Successors in the earth, as He made Successors from among those who were before them; and that <b>He</b> will <b>surely</b> establish for them their religion which He has chosen for them; and that <b>He</b> will <b>surely</b> give them in exchange security and peace after their fear: They will worship Me, {{and they will not}} associate anything with Me.

2500|$|Maimonides {{intended}} to provide a complete statement of the Oral Law, so {{that a person who}} mastered first the Written Torah and then the Mishneh Torah would be in no need of any other book. [...] Contemporary reaction was mixed, with strong and immediate opposition focusing on the absence of sources and the belief that the work appeared to be {{intended to}} supersede study of the Talmud. [...] Maimonides responded to these criticisms, and the Mishneh Torah endures as an influential work in Jewish religious thought. [...] According to several authorities, a decision may not be rendered in opposition to a view of Maimonides, even where he apparently militated against the sense of a Talmudic passage, for in such cases the presumption was that the words of the Talmud were incorrectly interpreted.

2500|$|Macdonnell’s men next {{made off}} with the colony’s cattle. Colonists Duncan McNaughton, Alexander Mclean and John McLeod, riding near Frog Plain, {{observed}} the stolen cattle. They attempted to drive {{them back to the}} colony and were themselves driven off by several shots from Macdonnel’s men. One John Early’s gun misfired and he apologized stating <b>he</b> <b>surely</b> would have killed McNaughton, as his gun was loaded with two balls. The Métis now took matters into their own hands. Parties of Métis paraded in front of the Red River settlement day and night singing war songs to intimidate the settlers. Some settlers were abducted and their houses were dismantled or burned. Settlers continually deserted, often taking away arms and ammunition belonging to the colony. The Nor’Westers erected another battery with one piece opposite Fort Douglas. A breastwork was thrown up around it partially made from wood taken from dismantled houses. Duncan Cameron dispatched parties of armed men along various roads to capture any wandering settlers. In June, NWC forces attacked the colony no less than 4 times, often firing at the dwelling houses from hidden positions. In every case the colonists returned fire. Four colonists and Baymen were wounded by enemy fire and John Warren was nearly killed when his wall gun bursts. Eventually, the Métis entered the Red River colony and occupied several houses including that of John Pritchard which they set up as their headquarters. Several colonists were evicted and their houses burned. After the last attack on June 11 which lasted half an hour, the colonists met with Governor Macdonell and suggested that he surrender himself to end the violence. On June 15, the Nor’Westers attacked the Red River colony in force, taking a number of prisoners and throwing up a rampart with cannon around the grain store. They also let the colonists horses loose to trample their crops. The next day, the NWC’s Alexander Mackenzie and Simon Frazer arrived from Fort William and wrote to Governor Macdonell that if he surrendered himself the colony would be left in peace. Governor Miles Macdonell subsequently surrendered himself and made a verbal agreement with the NWC for the following terms: ...|$|E
