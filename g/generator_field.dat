25|$|As the {{throttle}} is moved to higher power notches, the fuel rate {{to the prime}} mover will increase, resulting in a corresponding increase in RPM and horsepower output. At the same time, main <b>generator</b> <b>field</b> excitation will be proportionally increased to absorb the higher power. This will translate into increased electrical output to the traction motors, with a corresponding increase in tractive force.

5000|$|Since an {{armature}} {{is wound}} with coils of wire, {{a magnetic field}} is {{set up in the}} armature whenever a current flows in the coils. This field is at right angles to the <b>generator</b> <b>field,</b> and is called cross magnetization of the armature. The effect of the armature field is to distort the <b>generator</b> <b>field</b> and shift the neutral plane. The neutral plane is the position where the armature windings are moving parallel to the magnetic flux lines, that is why an axis lying in this plane is called as magnetic neutral axis (MNA). This effect is known as armature reaction and is proportional to the current flowing in the armature coils.|$|E
50|$|The {{speed of}} a DC motor is {{controlled}} by varying the voltage fed to the <b>generator</b> <b>field</b> windings, Vgf, which varies the output voltage of the generator. The varied output voltage will change the voltage of the motor, since they are connected directly through the armature. Consequently, changing the Vgf will control {{the speed of the}} motor. The picture on the right shows the Ward Leonard control system, with the Vgf feeding the generator and Vmf feeding the motor.|$|E
50|$|An {{amplidyne}} is an {{electromechanical amplifier}} invented prior to World War II by Ernst Alexanderson. It {{consists of an}} electric motor driving a DC generator. The signal to be amplified {{is applied to the}} <b>generator's</b> <b>field</b> winding, and its output voltage is an amplified copy of the field current. The amplidyne is used in industry in high power servo and control systems, to amplify low power control signals to control powerful electric motors, for example. It is now mostly obsolete.|$|R
5000|$|When the {{throttle}} {{is in the}} idle position, the prime mover will be receiving minimal fuel, causing it to idle at low RPM. In addition, the traction motors will not {{be connected to the}} main generator and the <b>generator's</b> <b>field</b> windings will not be excited (energized) — the generator will not produce electricity with no excitation. Therefore, the locomotive will be in [...] "neutral". Conceptually, this is the same as placing an automobile's transmission into neutral while the engine is running.|$|R

USE: Device for converting kinetic energy into electrical energy, used in vibration-decoupled bearing (claimed).

50|$|A Ward Leonard drive can {{be viewed}} as a {{high-power}} amplifier in the multi-kilowatt range, built from rotating electrical machinery. Where the 'prime mover' is electrical, a Ward Leonard drive unit consists of a motor and generator with shafts coupled together. The prime mover, which turns at a constant speed, may be AC or DC powered. The generator is a DC generator, with field windings and armature windings. The input to the amplifier is applied to the field windings, and the higher power output comes from the armature windings. (See Excitation (magnetic)#Amplifier principle for how a generator can act as an amplifier.) The amplifier output is usually connected to a second motor, which moves the load, such as an elevator. With this arrangement, small changes in current applied to the input, and thus the <b>generator</b> <b>field,</b> result in large changes in the output, allowing smooth speed control.|$|E
50|$|To {{provide a}} black start, some power {{stations}} have small diesel generators, normally called the black start diesel generator (BSDG), {{which can be}} used to start larger generators (of several megawatts capacity), which in turn can be used to start the main power station generators. Generating plants using steam turbines require station service power of up to 10% of their capacity for boiler feedwater pumps, boiler forced-draft combustion air blowers, and for fuel preparation. It is uneconomical to provide such a large standby capacity at each station, so black-start power must be provided over designated tie lines from another station. Often hydroelectric power plants are designated as the black-start sources to restore network interconnections. A hydroelectric station needs very little initial power to start (just enough to open the intake gates and provide excitation current to the <b>generator</b> <b>field</b> coils), and can put a large block of power on line very quickly to allow start-up of fossil-fuel or nuclear stations. Certain types of combustion turbine can be configured for black start, providing another option in places without suitable hydroelectric plants.|$|E

The <b>Field</b> <b>Generator</b> constantly transmits trigger signals within its transmission range. When a tag, the patient wears, receives the trigger signal from a <b>Field</b> <b>Generator,</b> it responds to a Reader with the ID of the <b>Field</b> <b>Generator.</b> Based on the <b>Field</b> <b>Generator</b> IDs that a tag responds, {{the location of}} the patient associated with the tag can be approximately estimated.
