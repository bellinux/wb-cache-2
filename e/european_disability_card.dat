40|$|There are {{altogether}} two aims of {{the practical}} part of this thesis. The primary aim was {{to find out what}} are the opinions, personal experience and satisfaction of those who obtain social benefits and use the ZTP (severe health <b>disability)</b> <b>cards.</b> The second aim was to discover which social services are used most often by those who carry a card. These aims were achieved {{on the basis of the}} research question which was whether the degree of the card is sufficient for its owners and also by means of ten questions that were given to various respondents during semi-structured interview. As for the most convenient form, I chose qualitative research for this thesis. The technique of the above mentioned semi-structured interview was applied deliberately and the research population consisted of five respondents who own the TP (health <b>disability)</b> <b>card,</b> ZTP (severe health <b>disability)</b> <b>card</b> or ZTP/P (severe health disability requiring special care) card. The respondents were three women and two men. Nobody of the addressed refused to give the interview. The conversations took place from December 2016 until the first half of February 2017. After finishing the research it is obvious that claim to the severe health <b>disability</b> <b>card</b> has any person from the age of 1 year, regardless of gender. Most of the respondents are satisfied with their kind of card which emerges from the owning of the highest degree of the ZTP/P (severe health disability requiring special care) card. Nevertheless, it has turned out that persons with a health disability do not take advantage of these cards in its entirety which I reckon is due to insufficient information, regarding the possibilities of its use...|$|R

40|$|The Motor Group of the European Council was {{commissioned}} {{in the autumn}} of 1997 to prepare a proposal for a new European Bus and Coach Directive. In the beginning, most of the Member States did not have the accessibility requirements as their main concern; still a smaller network with actors from the National delegations from Britain, Germany and Sweden would influence the other National delegations in the Council group to finally agree to retain the requirement of accessibility of the Directive. Within the EU decision process, the <b>European</b> <b>Disability</b> movement acted as a strong player during the whole negotiation process using the proposal to a new Bus and Coach Directive as a tool to influence key actors to go towards a Directive with a strong approach for accessibility. Policy Transfer and Policy Transfer Network are used as analytical tools to understand and structure the transfer of the question of accessibility during the negotiation process. Actors understanding how the bureaucratic process works within the EU decision system have a chance to contributing for the changes in the directions they wishes for within a range of policy areas.
