25|$|In recent times, justices tend to {{strategically}} {{plan their}} decisions {{to leave the}} bench with personal, institutional, ideological, partisan and sometimes even political factors playing a role.

Finally, especially in recent decades, many justices have timed their departure to coincide with a philosophically compatible president holding office, {{to ensure that a}} like-minded successor would be appointed.|$|E

25|$|Along {{with the}} split between {{northern}} and southern Vietnam in geographical territory came the divergence in their distinctive choices <b>for</b> <b>institutional</b> political structure.

During this period, due to this structural difference, the north and south revealed different patterns in their economic activities, the long-term effect of which still persist up to today. Citizens that have previously lived in the bureaucratic state {{are more likely to have}} higher household consumption and get more engaged in civic activities; and the state itself tends to have stronger fiscal capacity for taxation inherited from the previous institution.|$|E

25|$|Citi Capital Advisors (CCA), {{formerly}} Citi Alternative Investments, was a Citi Hedge {{fund that}} offers various investment strategies across multiple asset classes, ranging from market strategies to infrastructure and private equity investing <b>for</b> <b>institutional</b> and high-net-worth investors. Due to US regulations {{as part of}} the Volcker rule to limit bank ownership in hedge funds to no more than 3%, Citi spun off its hedge fund unit with its managers owning {{a significant part of the}} new company. The spin-off of CCA created Napier Park Global Capital, a $6.8 billion hedge fund with more than 100 employees in New York and London. The new company will be managed by Jim O’Brien and Jonathan Dorfman, who would serve as co-CEOs and were former Citi executives managing CCA. Citigroup will continue to retain a sizable minority position in the new firm, but will slowly withdraw its capital over time by the July 2014 deadline stipulated by the Volcker Rule.|$|E

25|$|According to Christina Romer, {{the money}} supply growth caused by huge {{international}} gold inflows was a crucial source of {{the recovery of the}} United States economy, and that the economy showed little sign of self-correction. The gold inflows were partly due to devaluation of the U.S. dollar and partly due to deterioration of the political situation in Europe. In their book, A Monetary History of the United States, Milton Friedman and Anna J. Schwartz also attributed the recovery to monetary factors, and contended that it was much slowed by poor management of money by the Federal Reserve System. Former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke agreed that monetary factors played important roles both in the worldwide economic decline and eventual recovery. Bernanke also saw a strong role <b>for</b> <b>institutional</b> factors, particularly the rebuilding and restructuring of the financial system, and pointed out that the Depression should be examined in an international perspective.|$|E
25|$|Both Gardner Hall (1930), {{originally}} {{named the}} Fowler Memorial Administration Building after Charles J. Fowler, {{and the original}} Floyd W. Nease Library (1953), now the Bower-Grimshaw Center <b>for</b> <b>Institutional</b> Advancement, were designed by Wesley Angell. Gardner Hall was designed in the Classical or Colonial Revival mode. Gardner is brick, three stories on a high granite basement, and capped by a parapet balustraded in the center. Corners are articulated with brick quoins. The fenestration is symmetric with double sash windows at regular intervals, trimmed in white, topped with flared brick lintels and a white keystone. It also features a two-story balustraded Doric portico of fluted cast stone columns. The portico is the backdrop for commencement ceremonies. The main entrance, {{at the end of}} wide stairs, is pilastered and topped with a bracketed entablature, which frames an arched glass opening. The side elevations have projecting stair towers, which indicate the site of a central hall running the length of the building. Originally rectangular in form, the 1953 addition of the then-Nease Library in the rear gave it a T-configuration.|$|E
