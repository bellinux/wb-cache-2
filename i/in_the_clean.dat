5|$|Darwin's theory {{followed}} {{from his}} understanding that coral polyps thrive <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>clean</b> seas of the tropics {{where the water}} is agitated, but can only live within a limited depth of water, starting just below low tide. Where {{the level of the}} underlying land stays the same, the corals grow around the coast to form what he called fringing reefs, and can eventually grow out from the shore to become a barrier reef. Where the land is rising, fringing reefs can grow around the coast, but coral raised above sea level dies and becomes white limestone. If the land subsides slowly, the fringing reefs keep pace by growing upwards on a base of dead coral, and form a barrier reef enclosing a lagoon between the reef and the land. A barrier reef can encircle an island, and once the island sinks below sea level a roughly circular atoll of growing coral continues {{to keep up with the}} sea level, forming a central lagoon. Should the land subside too quickly or sea level rise too fast, the coral dies as it is below its habitable depth.|$|E

30|$|Consistent with Delorme et al. [25], we {{find that}} {{extended}} Infomax performs best, both <b>in</b> terms of <b>the</b> dipolarity score proposed in Delorme et al. [25] {{and in terms of}} our ERD peak score. However, the ERD peak score, which heuristically quantifies an oscillatory phenomenon <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cleaned</b> data, is not as sensitive as the dipolarity measure, which is computed on the source signals. This is to be expected, since the source signals are an intermediate step within the artifact reduction, and differences on this intermediate level may not necessarily translate into strong differences <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cleaned</b> data. Indeed, observed ERD differences between the methods are rather small, which suggests that the choice of the decomposition method may often not result in strong differences in data quality.|$|R
