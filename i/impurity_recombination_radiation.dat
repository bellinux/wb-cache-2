40|$|A {{substantial}} {{fraction of}} all ionizing photons originate from radiative recombinations. However, in radiative transfer calculations this <b>recombination</b> <b>radiation</b> is often {{assumed to be}} absorbed 'on-the-spot' because for most methods the computational cost associated with the inclusion of gas elements as sources is prohibitive. We present a new, CPU and memory efficient implementation for the transport of ionizing <b>recombination</b> <b>radiation</b> in the TRAPHIC radiative transfer scheme. TRAPHIC solves the radiative transfer equation by tracing photon packets {{at the speed of}} light and in a photon-conserving manner in spatially adaptive smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations. Our new implementation uses existing features of the TRAPHIC scheme to add <b>recombination</b> <b>radiation</b> at no additional cost in the limit in which the fraction of the simulation box filled with radiation approaches 1. We test the implementation by simulating an HII region in photoionization equilibrium and comparing to reference solutions presented in the literature, finding excellent agreement. We apply our implementation to discuss the evolution of the HII region to equilibrium. We show that the widely used case A and B approximations yield accurate ionization profiles only near the source and near the ionization front, respectively. We also discuss the impact of <b>recombination</b> <b>radiation</b> on the geometry of shadows behind optically thick absorbers. We demonstrate that the shadow region may be completely ionized by the diffuse <b>recombination</b> <b>radiation</b> field and discuss the important role of heating by <b>recombination</b> <b>radiation</b> in the shadow region.

40|$|Interband {{excitation}} of GaAs with {{circularly polarised}} light produces a spin-polarised population of photoexcited carriers. The equilibrium degree of spin polarisation under cw excitation {{depends on the}} balance of spin relaxation and recombination rates, and can be monitored directly through the degree of polarisation of <b>recombination</b> <b>radiation.</b> We have measured the polarisation at 2 K of <b>recombination</b> <b>radiation</b> following band edge excitation {{for a variety of}} GaAs/AlGaAs quantum well samples of carrier content ranging from ≈ 10 ^ 8 cm - 2 up to ≈ 2 × 10 ^ 11 cm - 2 in which values of recombination time have been measured, and have thereby determined the spin relaxation times. Two remarkable results emerge; (i) the spin relaxation time increases from 30 ps to > 8 ns as the carrier concentration is increased; and (ii) for degenerate n-type quantum wells the <b>recombination</b> <b>radiation</b> is close to 100 % circularly polarised, there being strong evidence for a long spin memory in the electron Fermi sea.

The spectra show K shell emission lines from hydrogen- and helium-like ions of magnesium, silicon, sulfur, and iron as well as a K-alpha fluorescence emission feature from near-neutral iron. The helium-like n= 2 -> 1 triplet of silicon is fully resolved and the analogous triplet of iron is partially resolved. The helium-like triplet component flux ratios outside of eclipse are consistent with emission from recombination and subsequent cascades (<b>recombination</b> <b>radiation)</b> from a photoionized plasma. In eclipse, however, the w (resonance) lines of silicon and iron are stronger than that expected for <b>recombination</b> <b>radiation,</b> and are consistent with emission from a collisionally ionized plasma. The triplet line flux ratios at both phases can be explained more naturally, however, as emission from a photoionized plasma if the effects of resonant line scattering are included in addition to <b>recombination</b> <b>radiation.</b> We show that the emissivity due to resonant scattering depends sensitively on the line optical depth and, in the case of winds in X-ray binaries, this allows constraints on the wind velocity even when Doppler shifts cannot be resolved.

The latter effect modifies the shape and amplitude of the <b>recombination</b> <b>radiation</b> and CosmoSpec improves significantly over previous treatments of it. Utilizing effective multilevel atom and conductance approaches, one calculation takes only ~ 15 seconds on a standard laptop as opposed to days for previous computations.

40|$|The {{appearance}} of the first luminous sources in the Universe {{marks the beginning of}} the epoch of reionisation. The cosmic reionisation of hydrogen has been the last major phase transition {{in the evolution of the}} Universe, turning cool neutral gas into the hot, ionised plasma we observe today. Up to now, direct observations of reionisation have been impossible, most of our current knowledge therefore stems from numerical studies. However, even with current computing facilities the modelling of the reionisation epoch presents some serious challenges. Radiative transfer is perhaps the biggest challenge, due to the high dimensionality and non-locality of the problem. In this thesis the latest improvements of the SimpleX method, that was designed to overcome some of the problems related to radiative transfer, are presented. We have used this method to study the escape fraction of ionising photons from galaxies. Our results show that high-redshift dwarf galaxies can be important contributors to cosmic reionisation. In addition, we have studied the effect of the inclusion of diffuse <b>recombination</b> <b>radiation</b> in reionisation simulations on large scales, which has been neglected by recent studies. We show that diffuse <b>recombination</b> <b>radiation</b> does not have a significant influence on the reionisation process. Promotor: V. IckeWith summary in Dutc...|$|R

40|$|We use {{a set of}} cosmological {{simulations}} {{combined with}} radiative transfer calculations to investigate the distribution of neutral hydrogen in the post-reionization Universe. We assess the contributions from the metagalactic ionizing background, collisional ionization and diffuse <b>recombination</b> <b>radiation</b> to the total ionization rate at redshifts z= 0 - 5. We find that the densities above which hydrogen self-shielding becomes important are consistent with analytic calculations and previous work. However, because of diffuse <b>recombination</b> <b>radiation,</b> whose intensity peaks at the same density, the transition between highly ionized and self-shielded regions is smoother than what is usually assumed. We provide fitting functions to the simulated photoionization rate {{as a function of}} density and show that post-processing simulations with the fitted rates yields results that are in excellent agreement with the original radiative transfer calculations. The predicted neutral hydrogen column density distributions agree very well with the observations. In particular, the simulations reproduce the remarkable lack of evolution in the column density distribution of Lyman limit and weak damped Lyα systems below z = 3. The evolution of the low column density end is affected by the increasing importance of collisional ionization with decreasing redshift. On the other hand, the simulations predict the abundance of strong damped Lyα systems to broadly track the cosmic star formation rate density.

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{three-dimensional}} radiative transfer (RT) code, RADAMESH, {{based on a}} ray-tracing, photon-conserving and adaptive (in space and time) scheme. RADAMESH uses a novel Monte Carlo approach to sample the radiation field within the computational domain on a "cell-by-cell" basis. Thanks to this algorithm, the computational efforts are now focused where actually needed, i. e. within the Ionization-fronts (I-fronts). This results in an increased accuracy level and, at the same time, a huge gain in computational speed {{with respect to a}} "classical" Monte Carlo RT, especially when combined with an Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) scheme. Among several new features, RADAMESH is able to adaptively refine the computational mesh in correspondence of the I-fronts, allowing to fully resolve them within large, cosmological boxes. We follow the propagation of ionizing radiation from an arbitrary number of sources and from the <b>recombination</b> <b>radiation</b> produced by H and He. The chemical state of six species (HI, HII, HeI, HeII, HeIII, e) and gas temperatures are computed with a time-dependent, non-equilibrium chemistry solver. We present several validating tests of the code, including the standard tests from the RT Code Comparison Project and a new set of tests aimed at substantiating the new characteristics of RADAMESH. Using our AMR scheme, we show that properly resolving the I-front of a bright quasar during Reionization produces a large increase of the predicted gas temperature within the whole HII region. Also, we discuss how H and He <b>recombination</b> <b>radiation</b> is able to substantially change the ionization state of both species (for the classical Stroemgren sphere test) with respect to the widely used "on-the-spot" approximation.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that <b>recombination</b> <b>radiation</b> of {{primordial}} hydrogen-helium plasma leads to the distortions of the planckian spectrum shape of the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB). We discuss the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect with taking into account primordial <b>recombination</b> <b>radiation</b> (PRR). Since in the thermal SZ effect the redistribution of the photons depends on the derivatives of the spectrum, the value of relative correction to SZ effect due to PRR significantly higher than relative corrections due to PRR in the initial spectrum. Calculations of corrections to the thermal SZ effect due to PRR show that depending on the cluster parameters: 1) in the range of frequencies ν = 0. 3 - 700 GHz where the cosmic microwave background (CMB) dominates and spectrum is very close to the planckian one the relative corrections due to PRR have an order of 10 ^- 9 - 10 ^- 6 of "pure" SZ effect (i. e. SZ effect for pure planckian spectrum). The difference of intensities of PRR coming from different directions (through intracluster and near intercluster medium) reaches values up to 22 mJy/ster at ν≃ 337 GHz (maximum in considered range). 2) In the range of frequencies ν = 700 - 5000 GHz where cosmic infrared background (CIB) becomes significant or even dominates the relative corrections due to PRR can reach 10 ^- 8 - 10 ^- 5 of "pure" SZ effect. Corresponding intensity difference reaches values up to 25 mJy/ster (at ν≃ 1700 GHz). In addition we suggest a modification of the method of electron gas temperature determination using corrections of the SZ effect due to PRR. Such modification allows one to simplify the determination of the cluster electron gas temperature in comparison with known methods. Comment: 20 pages, 9 figure...|$|R
