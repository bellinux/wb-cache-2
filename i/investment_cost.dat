5|$|From January 1995, the {{frequency}} between Steinkjer and Melhus was increased slightly. On 26 September 1995, {{the train station}} in Trondheim reopened as a renovated station that serves both buses, coaches and trains. The <b>investment</b> <b>cost</b> NOK50 million. In 1997, NSB stated that the Trøndelag Commuter Rail was unprofitable and threatened to terminate it, along {{with an array of}} other services, if funding was not increased. The same year, 750,000 people traveled with the commuter rail. The 20% increase that year was in part due to the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 1997 being held in Trondheim, and was the service in the country with the largest growth.|$|E
5|$|The entire {{project cost}} NOK1,814 million. The costs were {{distributed}} to NOK476 million for the Bømlafjord Tunnel, NOK433 million for the Stord Bridge, NOK336 million for the Bømla Bridge, NOK46 million for the Spissøy Bridge, NOK36 million for the Digernes Tunnel, NOK325 million for roadways and NOK172 for administration and common costs. The <b>investment</b> <b>cost</b> was split between state grants and NOK1,036 million in debt {{taken up by the}} toll company. When the project was passed by Parliament it had a budget of NOK1,260 million. The Office of the Auditor General of Norway criticized the Western Norway Public Roads Administration in 2001 for a total cost overrun of NOK900 million in three projects, the Triangle Link, the Lærdal Tunnel and parts of National Road 555. The majority of the cost overruns were tied to the Triangle Link. As a consequence, Minister of Transport Torild Skogsholm stated that future large road investments would have an external quality assurance before being presented to Parliament.|$|E

The 19 737-200s were gradually handed to their owners, while seven 737-400s and seventeen 737-500s were delivered until 1994. The <b>investment</b> <b>cost</b> NOK4.5 billion. By the end of 1993, the company had NOK3.4 billion in debt. On 1 June 1989, Erik G. Braathen, son of Bjørn G., took over as CEO {{at the age of}} 34. In 1992, Busy Bee filed for bankruptcy; the company's fleet of three Fokker 50s were transferred to the newly established Norwegian Air Shuttle, which started wet-leased operations along the West Coast for Braathens SAFE. As demand increased through the 1990s, the fleet was extended to six aircraft.|$|E

In the West Bank, the total <b>investment</b> <b>cost</b> of water projects from 1996 to 2002 amounted to about US$500 million, {{out of which}} 150 million were already spent on completed projects. The costs of ongoing projects were US$300 million, and the remaining US$50 million were committed to future projects. Out of {{the total cost of}} US$500 million, 200 million were invested in the water supply sector and 130 million in the wastewater sector. The remaining financial resources were spent in water conservation (80m), institutional and capacity building (30m), storm water, water resources and irrigation systems.|$|E

Four years later, {{the first part}} of the Iron Ore Line, from Malmberget to Luleå, was completed. In 1889, the mining company filed for bankruptcy, and the Government of Sweden bought the line for 8 million Swedish krona (SEK), half the <b>investment</b> <b>cost.</b> Construction of the Ore Line and Ofoten Line from Gällevare to Narvik started in 1898 and was completed in 1902. In 1915, the section from Kiruna to Riksgränsen (on the Norway–Sweden border) is electrified, and by 1923 the whole section from Narvik to Luleå is electrified. In 1940, the Port of Narvik was bombed, and all export for the remainder of World War II went via Luleå. In 1957, the Government of Sweden bought LKAB.|$|E

A bridge, Norddalsbron, was built along the Ofoten Line, extra long for military reasons, to be able to cut the line in case of war. In 1940, during the war, the bridge was blown up. However, because of lack of explosives, the demolition was not well done, and the bridge could be repaired by the Germans.|$|E
25|$|Ruter {{has stated}} that the {{estimated}} <b>investment</b> <b>cost</b> would be NOK10 billion, but that the tunnel would give high utility and {{would be one of}} the most economic investments they could make. There is no funding for a new tunnel in Oslo Package 3. By 2010, it was discovered that Oslo Package 3 was under-financed, and it is uncertain how much of the investment will be made by 2027. With the new tunnel being made a high priority by the city planners, this will either require additional grants from the municipality or the state, an increase in the toll fees, or the delay of investments in the program to a future Oslo Package 4. The left-wing parties have stated that they are willing to delay or abandon several road projects to allocate financing to a new tunnel, while the right-wing parties have stated that they are not willing to allow road projects to be undermined.|$|E
25|$|Many {{existing}} hydroelectric dams {{are fairly}} old (for example, the Hoover Dam {{was built in}} the 1930s), and their original design predated the newer intermittent power sources such as wind and solar by decades. A hydroelectric dam originally built to provide baseload power will have its generators sized according to the average flow of water into the reservoir. Uprating such a dam with additional generators increases its peak power output capacity, thereby increasing its capacity to operate as a virtual grid energy storage unit. The United States Bureau of Reclamation reports an <b>investment</b> <b>cost</b> of $69 per kilowatt capacity to uprate an existing dam, compared to more than $400 per kilowatt for oil-fired peaking generators. While an uprated hydroelectric dam does not directly store excess energy from other generating units, it behaves equivalently by accumulating its own fuel – incoming river water – during periods of high output from other generating units. Functioning as a virtual grid storage unit in this way, the uprated dam {{is one of the most}} efficient forms of energy storage, because it has no pumping losses to fill its reservoir, only increased losses to evaporation and leakage.|$|E

500|$|Overheating or over-using {{the frying}} oil leads to {{formation}} of rancid-tasting products of oxidation, polymerization, and other deleterious, unintended or even toxic compounds such as acrylamide (from starchy foods). [...] Recent research suggests fat deterioration may be worse when fat or oil is fried with food than when fat or oil is tested {{on its own}} in a laboratory. Deep-frying under vacuum helps to significantly reduce acrylamide formation, but this process is not widely used in the food industry due to the high <b>investment</b> <b>cost</b> involved.|$|E
500|$|On 12 December 1989, the {{committee}} sent an official offer to Hordaland Public Roads Administration whereby they, {{as a company}} under establishment, offered to fully finance the tunnel. The plans called for tolls of [...] for a car and an <b>investment</b> <b>cost</b> of NOK47 million. The plans were at first nearly discarded by the administration, as they felt {{it was impossible for}} a community of 400 people to finance such a large project without other grants. However, it became evident that the administration was spending NOK2 million per year on the ferry service, and as the ferry soon would have to be replaced, this would increase to NOK3 to 5 million per year. On 1 October 1990, the issue was considered by Hordaland Transport Board, which approved the plans. This was followed up by Hordaland County Council on 19 June 1991, which involved NOK27 million being financed by debt and NOK28 to 33 million being financed through reduced subsidies to the ferry.|$|E

2500|$|For example, when {{designing}} a paper mill, one can seek {{to decrease the}} amount of capital invested in a paper mill and {{enhance the quality of}} paper simultaneously. If the design of a paper mill is defined by large storage volumes and paper quality is defined by quality parameters, then the problem of optimal design of a paper mill can include objectives such as: i) minimization of expected variation of those quality parameter from their nominal values, ii) minimization of expected time of breaks and iii) minimization of <b>investment</b> <b>cost</b> of storage volumes. Here, maximum volume of towers are design variables. This example of optimal design of a paper mill is a simplification of the model used in. [...] Multi-objective design optimization have also been implemented in engineering systems - e.g. design of nano-CMOS semiconductors, design of solar-powered irrigation systems, optimization of sand mould systems, engine design, optimal sensor deployment and optimal controller design.|$|E

Major investments included a new facade, an {{enlargement of the}} concourse, improved lighting, a new scoreboard and an all-new all-weather running track. Ahead of the 2008 season the stadium underwent a reconfiguration, reducing its capacity to 59,537. For the nine seasons prior to 2010, the turf was replaced eight times, costing $50,000 per time. The natural grass turf was replaced with FieldTurf Duraspine Pro in May 2010, making the Eskimos the last CFL team to switch to artificial turf, and the last team to play on grass until the Toronto Argonauts began playing at BMO Field.
