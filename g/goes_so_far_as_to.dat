5|$|Vithoba's image {{replaces the}} {{traditional}} representation of Buddha, when depicted as the ninth avatar of Vishnu, in some temple sculptures and Hindu astrological almanacs in Maharashtra. In the 17th century, Maratha artists sculpted {{an image of}} Pandharpur's Vithoba in the Buddha's place on a panel showing Vishnu's avatars. This {{can be found in}} the Shivneri Caves. Stevenson <b>goes</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> call devotees of Vithoba (Vithal-bhaktas) Buddhist Vaishnavas (Bauddho-Vaishnavas), since they consider Vithoba to be the ninth—namely Buddha—avatar of Vishnu. Some of the poet-saints praised Vithoba as a form of Buddha. B. R. Ambedkar, an Indian political leader and Buddhist convert, suggested that the image of Vithoba at Pandharpur was in reality the image of the Buddha.|$|E

He ensures the complete subjugation of Nabradia and Dalmasca and exterminates their royal families in order to acquire their deifacted nethicite. He confronts Dalmasca's resistance movement with absolute ruthlessness, accepting no surrender. He even <b>goes</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> murder his own ailing father and frame the Imperial senators, {{to put an end to}} their scheming against himself and Larsa, and to level cities in nethicite testing experiments. Vayne's ultimate goal is to free humanity from the control of the Occurians, a race of god-like beings that have for centuries secretly meddled with the course of human history.|$|E

25|$|Story Telling-The protagonist, Anna Andrianovna, takes {{great pride}} in {{identifying}} herself as a storyteller and poet.

25|$|As a result, she retreats {{into her}} own mind and her own thinking. Her {{thoughts}} begin to stretch and go beyond what would be considered by the Puritans as safe or even Christian. She still sees her sin, but begins to look on it differently than the villagers ever have. She begins {{to believe that a}} person's earthly sins don't necessarily condemn them. She even <b>goes</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> tell Dimmesdale that their sin has been paid for by their daily penance and that their sin won't keep them from getting to heaven, however, the Puritans believed that such a sin surely condemns.|$|E
25|$|William Schaw was {{master of}} works to King James VI of Scotland, {{and was also}} the general warden of all the lodges of Scottish stonemasons. This meant {{he was in charge}} of the erection, repair and {{maintenance}} of all government buildings, and also the running of what was already a fraternity of masons, who ensured that all building work was undertaken by properly qualified persons, and also provided for their own sick and the widows of their members. Schaw formalised the working of the lodges in two sets of statutes, set down on 28 December 1598 and 1599. Many now see these as the beginnings of modern Freemasonry. Robert Cooper, the archivist and writer, <b>goes</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> call Schaw the Father of Freemasonry.|$|E

25|$|Estimates of {{the extent}} of his empire vary greatly. The Burmese and Thai chronicles report an empire which covered the present-day Burma and {{northern}} Thailand. The Thai chronicles assert that Anawrahta conquered the entire Menam valley, and received tribute from the Khmer king. One states that Anawrahta's armies invaded the Khmer kingdom and sacked the city of Angkor, and another one <b>goes</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> say that Anawrahta even visited Java to receive his tribute. However, Western historians (Harvey, Hall, et al) present a much smaller empire, consisted of the Irrawaddy valley and nearer periphery. His victory terracotta votive tablets (emblazoned with his name in Sanskrit) have been found along the Tenasserim coastline in the south, Katha in the north, Thazi in the east and Minbu in the west.|$|E
25|$|The book {{begins by}} {{tackling}} {{the origins of}} the solar system, using the nebular hypothesis to explain its formations entirely in terms of natural law. It explains the origins of life by spontaneous generation, citing some questionable experiments that claimed to spontaneously generate insects through electricity. It then appeals to geology to demonstrate a progression in the fossil record from simple to more complex organisms, finally culminating in man—with the Caucasian European unabashedly identified as the pinnacle of this process, just above the other races {{and the rest of the}} animal kingdom. It even <b>goes</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> connect man’s mental reasoning power with the rest of the animals as an advanced evolutionary step that can be traced backwards through the rest of the lower animals. In this sense, the evolutionary ideas offered in Vestiges aim at being complete and all-encompassing.|$|E

In order to prove Fergun's guilt, Sonea submits to a mental examination, or 'truthreading', by Administrator Lorlen, who, finding {{the memory of the}} black-robed magician, reveals the man to be Lord Akkarin, head of the guild, explaining that she saw him practising black magic which is forbidden in Kyralia.

25|$|Following {{the events}} of the Infinite Crisis, Luthor's history was again altered, re-introducing Lena as his sister. Unlike the Pre-Crisis version, Lena is well-aware of history with Lex, having grown up {{alongside}} him, with only an abusive father. Lex and Lena's mother is named Letitia and is presumed deceased. She has no empathic abilities, and is a paraplegic with a teenaged daughter, Lori, both of whom still live in Smallville. Unlike his pre-Crisis version, Lex has little love for his sister, having abandoned her with an unnamed aunt after their father dies of a heart attack. Lex even <b>goes</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> cure Lena's illness, and then immediately undoes the process, leaving her completely catatonic, solely {{in order to make a}} mocking point to Superboy and Superman.

Upon returning to Salem in January 2013, Chloe attempts to reestablish her relationship with Daniel, revealing to Daniel that Parker really is his son and that the earlier supposed DNA test results had been fake. Hoping she could get Daniel back, Chloe blackmails Jennifer into rejecting Daniel by threatening to keep Daniel from seeing Parker. Chloe <b>goes</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> have her mother Nancy prepare to take Parker to Brazil without telling Daniel, so Jennifer felt she had to publicly reject Daniel and leave the hospital to protect Daniel from losing access to his son while never revealing her true feelings.|$|E
