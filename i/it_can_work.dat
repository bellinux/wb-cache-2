5|$|The {{economy of}} Springfield is in decline, so Mayor Quimby listens to {{suggestions}} from citizens {{on how to}} improve it. Principal Skinner states that legalized gambling has helped rejuvenate run-down economies, and that <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>work</b> for Springfield as well. Everybody, even Marge, likes the idea. Mr. Burns and Mayor Quimby work together to build a casino, where Homer gets a job as a blackjack dealer. The casino is designed by Mr. Burns himself, as the proposals he received were not to his liking. While Marge waits for Homer's shift to end at the casino, she finds a quarter on the floor and uses it to play a slot machine. She wins and almost immediately becomes addicted to gambling. Meanwhile, since Bart is too young to gamble at Mr. Burns' Casino, he starts his own casino for his friends to play in his treehouse, and intercepts Robert Goulet to perform there. Mr. Burns also grows even richer, but in the process becomes a Howard Hughes-type hermit, developing a profound fear of microscopic germs, urinates in jars, and wears tissue boxes instead of shoes.|$|E

It illustrates the way he handled his problems, at first through philosophy, and later through the application of his emerging therapeutic skills and insights.

500|$|Bacon later {{stated that}} [...] "painting {{has nothing to}} do with {{colouring}} surfaces", and in general he was not preoccupied with detailing his backgrounds: [...] "When I feel that I have to some extent formed the image, I put the background in to see how it's going to work and then I go with the image itself." [...] He told David Sylvester that he intended his [...] "hard, flat, bright ground" [...] to juxtapose with the complexity of the central images, and noted that [...] "for this work, <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>work</b> more starkly if the background is very united and clear. I think that probably is why I have used a very clear background against which the image can articulate itself". Bacon usually applied paint to the background quickly, and with [...] "great energy"; however, he thought of it as a secondary element. He used its colour to establish tone, but in his mind the real work began when he came to paint the figures.|$|E
500|$|By [...] "All the Madame's Men", McCown-Levy {{felt that}} Agents of Hydra was [...] "the most {{consistently}} entertaining arc the series has ever done. The show has had higher highs, but never this constant {{a level of}} quality. I've argued several times of late that Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. has been getting steadily better each season, and even in a year that had strong arcs like Ghost Rider and LMD, this final storyline tops them all ... the show has essentially managed to create an alternate reality where <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>work</b> out longstanding issues and address unfinished character beats, all while smartly delivering action and thrills ... And insofar as this keeps working, it's managed to turn the TV equivalent of a fun B-movie into a superior television show." [...] Overall, Schwartz awarded the season an 8.8 out of 10, stating the season was [...] "the best [...] ever been, maturing as a show and learning the right lessons from what's come before." [...] She praised the pod format, saying it [...] "helped tighten the season {{and give it a}} stronger throughline" [...] and added that each new pod the season introduced was more successful than the previous, with the Agents of Hydra pod and Framework story arc possibly the strongest of the entire series. Schwartz also spoke fondly of the guest stars throughout the season, particularly Jansen, who she called [...] "the season's MVP" [...] and felt [...] "stole the show" [...] with Aida, who was [...] "the standout new character" [...] of the season. Some negatives on the season were the additional villains, Eli Morrow and the Superior (not [...] "a particularly standout villain", and never [...] "as imposing or terrifying as he should have been", respectively), and some of the early effects work, though she also praised [...] "the great CGI work" [...] with Ghost Rider. Den of Geeks Rob Leane also praised the pod format, saying it [...] "fixed the 22-episode problem". He felt the Ghost Rider pod had amazing visual effects, and was a [...] "natural" [...] length that other series may have stretched further. He also highlighted Wen's performance as LMD May in the LMD pod and the Agents of Hydra pod's Mack and Hope storyline, and praised the guest performances of Luna and Jansen (feeling that bringing the latter two together in the finale [...] "was the perfect way to wrap things up"). Leane called the season [...] "a master class in how Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D. can thrive going forward ... the writers keep throwing in more sci-fi concepts, the special effects team keep delivering, and the cast keep stepping up their game to keep up with it all." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{testing the}} over 5,000km Agni V missile, which {{went up to}} 600km into space during its {{parabolic}} trajectory, the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) now feels it can fashion deadly anti-satellite (ASAT) weapons in double-quick time. Agni V gives you the boosting capability and the 'kill vehicle', with advanced seekers, {{will be able to}} home into the target satellite, DRDO chief, VK Saraswat said. The defence ministry in 2010 had even drafted a 15-year [...] "Technology Perspective and Roadmap", which held development of ASAT weapons [...] "for electronic or physical destruction of satellites in both LEO (2,000-km altitude above earth's surface) and the higher geosynchronous orbit" [...] as a thrust area in its long-term integrated perspective plan under the management of DRDO. Consequently, defence scientists are focusing on [...] "space security" [...] to protect India's space assets from electronic or physical destruction.

Discussing the Deborah Warner RSC production at The Swan in 1987, which used an unedited text, Stanley Wells argues that Donald Sumpter's delivery of the speech [...] "became a deeply moving attempt to master the facts and thus to overcome the emotional shock of a previously unimagined horror. We had {{the sense of a}} suspension of time, as if the speech represented an articulation, necessarily extended in expression, of a sequence of thoughts and emotions, that might have taken no more than a second or two to flash through the character's mind, like a bad dream." [...] Also speaking of the Warner production and Sumpter's performance, Alan C. Dessen writes [...] "we observe Marcus, step-by-step, use his logic and Lavinia's reactions to work out what has happened, so that the spectators both see Lavinia directly and see through his eyes and images. In the process the horror of the situation is filtered through a human consciousness in a way difficult to describe but powerful to experience." ...|$|E

60|$|Bad {{criticism}} is mischievous enough, however; and I think that much {{if not most}} current criticism as practised among the English and Americans is bad, is falsely principled, and is conditioned in evil. It is falsely principled because it is unprincipled, or without principles; and it is conditioned in evil because it is almost wholly anonymous. At the best its opinions are not conclusions from certain easily verifiable principles, but are effects from the worship of certain models. They are in so far quite worthless, {{for it is the}} very nature of things that the original mind cannot conform to models; it has its norm within itself; <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>work</b> only in its own way, and by its self-given laws. Criticism does not inquire whether a work is true to life, but tacitly or explicitly compares it with models, and tests it by them. If literary art travelled by any such road as criticism would have it go, it would travel in a vicious circle, and would arrive only at the point of departure. Yet this is the course that criticism must always prescribe when it attempts to give laws. Being itself artificial, it cannot conceive of the original except as the abnormal. It must altogether reconceive its office before it can be of use to literature. It must reduce this to the business of observing, recording, and comparing; to analyzing the material before it, and then synthetizing its impressions. Even then, it is not too much to say that literature as an art could get on perfectly well without it. Just as many good novels, poems, plays, essays, sketches, would be written if there were no such thing as criticism in the literary world, and no more bad ones.|$|E
6000|$|It {{is absurd}} {{to suppose that}} {{anywhere}} to-day the nationalisms, the suspicions and hatreds, the cants and policies, and dead phrases that sway men represent the current intelligence of mankind.

But {{we have to get}} intelligences together, we have to canalize thought before <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>work</b> and produce its due effects. To that end, I suppose, there has been a vast amount of mental activity among us political [...] "negligibles." [...] For my own part I have thought of the idea of God as the banner of human unity and justice, and I have made some tentatives in that direction, but men, I perceive, have argued themselves mean and petty about religion. At the word [...] "God" [...] passions bristle. The word [...] "God" [...] does not unite men, it angers them. But I doubt if God cares greatly whether we call Him God or no. His service is the service of man. This double idea of the League of Free Nations, linked with the idea of democracy as universal justice, is free from the jealousy of the theologians and great enough for men to unite upon everywhere. I know how warily one must reckon with the spite of the priest, but surely these ideas may call upon the teachers of all the great world religions for their support. The world is full now of confused propaganda, propaganda of national ideas, of traditions of hate, of sentimental and degrading loyalties, of every sort of error that divides and tortures and slays mankind. All human institutions are made of propaganda, are sustained by propaganda and perish when it ceases; they must be continually explained and re-explained to the young and the negligent. And for this new world of democracy and the League of Free Nations to which all reasonable men are looking, there must needs be the greatest of all propagandas. For that cause every one must become a teacher and a missionary. [...] "Persuade to it and make the idea of it and the necessity for it plain," [...] that is the duty of every school teacher, every tutor, every religious teacher, every writer, every lecturer, every parent, every trusted friend throughout the world. For it, too, every one must become a student, must go on with the task of making vague intentions into definite intentions, of analyzing and destroying obstacles, of mastering the ten thousand difficulties of detail....|$|E
