500|$|In 1857 the {{regiment}} had been stationed in Meerut for three years, forming {{part of the}} Meerut Division under Major General William Hewitt. The East India Company planned to supply its locally recruited [...] "Native" [...] regiments with the Pattern 1853 Enfield rifle during that year, accompanied by {{a new type of}} ammunition that {{came in the form of}} a greased paper cartridge. The standard drill (or <b>formal</b> <b>procedure)</b> for loading this ammunition required the user to bite the paper cartridge to open it. Rumours began to circulate within the Bengal Presidency that the grease for the cartridges was made from a mix of lard from pigs and tallow from cows, and was therefore offensive to both Hindu and Muslim sepoy alike. These rumours reached Lieutenant Colonel George M. Carmichael-Smyth, in temporary command of {{the regiment}}, while he was on leave in Mussoorie. On his return to Meerut, Carmichael-Smyth received orders for the new drill, which applied to all weapons currently in use including those which did not take the new form of ammunition. Carmichael-Smyth modified the drill so that cartridges would be torn by hand, rather than biting.|$|E

2500|$|After World War II {{there were}} many changes made to amateur radio. Government {{regulation}} and licensing were put into effect. [...] Since a <b>formal</b> <b>procedure</b> was now established, many people joined the hobby. In response to this, several local hams founded the first radio club in Trinidad in 1951 {{as a means of}} self-regulation and coordination of amateur radio activities. [...] It was called the Amateur Radio Society of Trinidad and Tobago (ARSTT). [...] It functioned until 1959 when it became dormant. Another local club, the South Trinidad Amateur Radio Society (STARS) was formed at that time.|$|E
2500|$|If a force acts on a {{particle}} {{as it moves}} from [...] point A to point B, then, for each possible trajectory that the particle may take, {{it is possible to}} compute the total work done by the force along the path. [...] The principle of virtual work, which is the form of the principle of least action applied to these systems, states that the path actually followed by the particle is the one for which the difference between the work along this path and other nearby paths is zero (to first order). The <b>formal</b> <b>procedure</b> for computing the difference of functions evaluated on nearby paths is a generalization of the derivative known from differential calculus, and is termed the calculus of variations.|$|E

2500|$|Because of the 10-hour {{scheduled}} flight time, the flight required two complete flight crews, each consisting of one captain and one first officer. EgyptAir designated one crew as the [...] "active crew" [...] {{and the other}} as the [...] "cruise crew", sometimes {{also referred to as}} the [...] "relief crew". While there was no <b>formal</b> <b>procedure</b> specifying when each crew flew the aircraft, it was customary for the active crew to make the takeoff and fly the first four to five hours of the flight. The cruise crew then assumed control of the aircraft until about one to two hours before landing, at which point the active crew returned to the cockpit and assumed control of the aircraft. EgyptAir designated the captain of the active crew as the pilot-in-command or the commander of the flight.|$|E
2500|$|In 1992 the Government of India {{started the}} [...] "baby cradle scheme". This allows {{families}} anonymously {{to give their}} child up for adoption {{without having to go}} through the <b>formal</b> <b>procedure.</b> The scheme has been praised for possibly saving the lives of thousands of baby girls but also criticised by human rights groups, who say that the scheme encourages child abandonment and also reinforces the low status in which women are held. The scheme, which was piloted in Tamil Nadu, saw cradles placed outside state-operated health facilities. The Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu added another incentive, giving money to families that had more than one daughter. 136 baby girls were given for adoption during the first four years of the scheme. In 2000, 1,218 cases of female infanticide were reported, the scheme was deemed a failure and it was abandoned. It was reinstated in the following year.|$|E

The Royal Navy, always {{concerned about the}} possibility of mutiny, had a <b>formal</b> <b>procedure</b> for the removal of commanding officers for insanity. Admiral Dixon came on board Nancy, together with the chief and assistant surgeons from Montagu, and they examined Killwick. Then Dixon, the surgeons, D'Aranda, and Nancys Assistant Surgeon all signed a Survey, a document attesting to their willingness to swear under oath that they had impartially assessed Killwick and found him unfit to command. Killwick then was taken to Montagu. The next month Dixon sent Killwick aboard a merchant vessel bound for London, together with two marines from Nancy to take care of him. Dixon then confirmed D'Aranda as Nancys captain.|$|E

2500|$|The size {{distribution}} of {{gravel and sand}} particles are typically measured using sieve analysis. The <b>formal</b> <b>procedure</b> is described in ASTM D6913-04(2009). A stack of sieves with accurately dimensioned holes between a mesh of wires is used to separate the particles into size bins. A known volume of dried soil, with clods broken down to individual particles, is put {{into the top of}} a stack of sieves arranged from coarse to fine. The stack of sieves is shaken for a standard period of time so that the particles are sorted into size bins. This method works reasonably well for particles in the sand and gravel size range. [...] Fine particles tend to stick to each other, and hence the sieving process is not an effective method. If {{there are a lot of}} fines (silt and clay) present in the soil it may be necessary to run water through the sieves to wash the coarse particles and clods through.|$|E
2500|$|There is a widespread, {{though not}} universal, custom for a newly married wife {{to adopt the}} husband's family name. However, as Russia is not a common law country, any name change {{requires}} a <b>formal</b> <b>procedure</b> including an official application to the civil acts registrar. As the same registrar also records marriages, for the convenience sake it is often done during the marriage proceedings, as governed by the Federal Law #143-FZ [...] "On Civil State Acts", and the couple's marriage certificate has an option of having one common family name, or both spouses going by their original surname. However, the law is entirely gender neutral, and the couple may adopt either of their surnames (a husband adopting his wife's family name is an uncommon {{but by no means}} unheard-of practice, which is generally accepted and carries little to no social stigma), or even a completely different one. The law also recognizes the couple's right to use the combined family name, and for the either of the spouses to reclaim their original surname in the case the marriage is dissolved.|$|E
