Selectric Composer elements can be identified by a colored <b>index</b> <b>arrow</b> (the color is used to set a median character width on the machine) and an abbreviated series of letters and numbers identifying the font, size, and variation, for example [...] "UN-11-B" [...] for Univers 11-point bold (Adrian Frutiger had adapted his Univers font specifically for the Selectric Composer).|$|E
5000|$|The minimal {{instrumentation}} {{required is}} an airspeed indicator and a variometer. The pilot {{will use the}} polar curve information for the particular glider to derive the exact speeds to fly depending on the lift and sink conditions in which the glider is flying. This is commonly done using a speed to fly ring (known as a 'MacCready Ring') which is fitted around the aircraft's variometer. The ring is usually calibrated in either knots or meters per second and its markings {{are based on the}} aircraft's polar curve. [...] During the glide between thermals, the <b>index</b> <b>arrow</b> is set at the rate of climb expected in the next thermal. On the speed ring, the variometer needle points to the optimum speed to fly between thermals.|$|E
40|$|The <b>Arrow</b> <b>index</b> of a fuzzy choice {{function}} C is {{a measure}} of the degree to which C satisfies the Fuzzy Arrow Axiom, a fuzzy version of the classical Arrow Axiom. The main result of this paper shows that A(C) characterizes the degree to which C is full rational. We also obtain a method for computing A(C). The <b>Arrow</b> <b>index</b> allows to rank the fuzzy choice functions with respect to their rationality. Thus, if for solving a decision problem several fuzzy choice functions are proposed, by the <b>Arrow</b> <b>index</b> the most rational one will be chosen.

The meaning {{of economic development}} was effort had to done by government and planned in certainty time for changing and rising public walfare level. One of economix development aspects was economix grownth with only see 3 indicator factors were PDRB, Income percapita dan population growth. This research purposes were to know economic and bussinses indicator include index of coincident indicators, index of leading indicator, bussiness confidence index and consumer confidence index. The result research of the study indicate that PDRB and composit coincident index move together, but since 1998 : 4 condition changed where this both indexes move to far and not stabililymove, example 1991 : I, 2; 2000 : 3. 4 : 2001 : 1, 3 both <b>indexes</b> had different <b>arrow</b> and 1999 : 3. 4 : 2000 : 1, 2; 2 O 01 : 2. 4 both <b>indexes</b> had same <b>arrow.</b> This condition was becaused instabilityeconomy in economic crisis and political change in Indonesia.

The latter ARROWs are practically formed by a low index layer, embedded between higher index layers. Note that the refractive <b>indices</b> of these <b>ARROWs</b> are reversed, when comparing to usual waveguides. Light is confined by total internal reflection (TIR) {{on the inside of}} the higher index layers, but achieves a lot of modal overlap with the lower index central volume.|$|R

As depicted in Figure 3 b, the spectrum of the C-ZW nanorods in the wavelength range of 1, 250 to 1, 650 cm- 1, which is magnified from the dash box in Figure 3 a, exhibited obvious differences from the pure ZW nanorods. The peaks <b>indexed</b> by black <b>arrows</b> at approximately 1, 370 and 1, 580 cm- 1 are related to carbon, which are designated in terms of D and G bands. These peaks are in good correspondence with the Raman spectra of the amorphous carbon {{reported in the literature}} [16 – 18].|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{deals with}} the {{nonlinear}} observer-based synchronization problem for coupled chaotic systems. At the outset, complete synchronization conditions of coupled chaotic systems for known master and slave systems parameters, is provided. The active control law developed {{is based on the}} use of aggregation techniques for error dynamics stability study and the arrow form matrix for systems description. Then, by the design of an adequate nonlinear state observer, a new synchronization scheme is formulated for two identical chaotic systems. As a final point, the proposed observer-based synchronization between two nearly identical chaotic systems with unknown parameters is carried out. Numerical simulations are presented to assess the performance and the efficiency of the proposed contributions. <b>Index</b> Terms—Aggregation techniques, <b>Arrow</b> form matrix...|$|R
