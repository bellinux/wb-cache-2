40|$|Opioid {{use among}} problem drug {{users in the}} CR {{can be divided into}} several {{developmental}} periods, starting with the heroin epidemic after 1990 with the decline of methamphetamine use and followed by leakage of buprenorphine products to the black market. There <b>is</b> <b>currently</b> <b>a</b> <b>continuous</b> use of buprenorphine from the black market and an increase in use of opioid analgesics. The theoretical part of the work was concerned with the development of opioid use in the Czech Republic after 1990 and with the trends during the years from 1990 until the present. The practical part consisted of a cross-sectional study; a semi structured questionnaire was used to collect the data. The research sample was made of 68 clients who had previously used an opioid drug and visited the Prague contact centres Drop In, o. p. s. and Stage 5, Progressive, o. p. s. where the data were collected during December 2016 and February 2017. The data were analysed using descriptive statistics. The most used opioids in the last month were Subutex®, Suboxone® and heroin, to the lesser extent opium and fentanyl. Czech "braun", methadone, Vendal®, morphine and Addnok® were used only sporadically. Respondents had also experience with use of other opioids, such as Palladone®, Tramal®, Ravata® and codeine.

40|$|The SPanish Meteor Network (SPMN) <b>is</b> <b>currently</b> {{performing}} <b>a</b> <b>continuous</b> {{monitoring of}} meteor and fireball activity {{by means of}} 25 observing stations located in Spain. The analysis of events simultaneously imaged from, at least, two different locations provides information about meteoroids ablating in the atmosphere. In this way, atmospheric trajectories, radiant, orbital parameters and physicochemical parameters such as mass and tensile strength can be obtained [1, 2, 3]. Accurate orbital data are, for instance, of a paramount importance in order to infer information about the likely parent body of a given meteoroid stream [4]. Spectroscopic techniques provide also very valuable data about the chemical nature of these particles of interplanetary matter [5, 6, 7]. In this context, we present here the analysis of a doublestation sporadic fireball imaged from two of our stations on February 25, 2012 (Figure 1) ...|$|R
30|$|One of {{the main}} {{drawbacks}} of the current batch OS process is the downtime between the runs. Thus, we <b>are</b> <b>currently</b> developing <b>a</b> <b>continuous</b> mode process that combines batch OS with explosive decompression of the biomass, which we hope will decrease the residence time and open the cellulose structure to improve enzyme access (Seidel et al. 2017). Life cycle assessment studies comparing the various pretreatment processes (Prasad et al. 2016) have shown that OS has no significant {{negative impact on the}} environment compared to SE, although the CO 2 emission is higher due to the need to produce ethanol for the OS process (the ethanol can be distilled and recirculated, greatly reducing the net emission). Thus, OS appears to offer a promising method of pretreatment as the hydrolysate obtained is free from inhibitors, while simultaneously offering valorization of the hemicellulose and lignin stream. Retrofitting existing first-generation ethanol plants with the OS process to supply the sugar stream may help second-generation ethanol to become a commercial reality.|$|R

40|$|High-sensitivity CCD {{video cameras}} have been {{commonly}} {{used for the}} study of the activity of meteoroid streams. These provide useful data for the determination, for instance, of radiant, orbital and photometric parameters [1, 2, 3]. These devices can also be used to record emission spectra of meteoroids ablating in the Earth's atmosphere when holographic diffraction gratings are employed [3]. The SPMN <b>is</b> <b>currently</b> performing <b>a</b> <b>continuous</b> monitoring of meteor activity by means of 25 meteor observing stations in Spain. One important goal of our network is the study of the physico-chemical properties of meteoroids from multiple station data. These include radiant and orbital parameters, but also chemical information obtained from the emission spectra produced during the ablation of these particles of interplanetary matter in the atmosphere. This continuous monitoring can provide useful data to improve our knowledge about meteoroid streams and meteoroids of sporadic origin, and the mechanisms that deliver these materials to the Earth. With this aim, we analyze here a sporadic fireball recorded on December 28, 2011...|$|R
40|$|International audienceLeaching {{experiments}} {{of solid}} matrices (bitumen and cement pastes) have been first implemented {{to define the}} physicochemical conditions that microorganisms are likely to meet at the bitumen-concrete interface (see the paper of Bertron et al.). Of course, as might be suspected, the cement matrix imposes highly alkaline pH conditions (10 < pH < 11). The screening {{of a range of}} anaerobic denitrifying bacterial strains led us to select Halomonas desiderata as a model bacterium capable of catalyzing the reaction of nitrate reduction in these extreme conditions of pH. The denitrifying activity of Halomonas desiderata was quantified in batch bioreactor in the presence of solid matrices and / or leachate from bitumen and cement matrices. Denitrification was relatively fast in the presence of cement matrix (< 100 hours) and 2 to 3 times slower in the presence of bituminous matrix. Overall, the presence of solid cement promoted the kinetics of denitrification. The observation of solid surfaces {{at the end of the}} experiment revealed the presence of a biofilm of Halomonas desiderata on the cement paste surface. These attached bacteria showed a denitrifying activity comparable to planktonic bacterial culture. On the other side, no colonization of bitumen could be highlighted as either by SEM or epifluorescence microscopy. Now, we <b>are</b> <b>currently</b> developing <b>a</b> <b>continuous</b> experimental bioreactor which should allow us a more rational understanding of the bitumen-cement-microbe interactions...|$|R
40|$|Jumble is a byte code level {{mutation}} testing tool for Java which inter-operates with JUnit. It {{has been designed}} to operate in an industrial setting with large projects. Heuristics have been included to speed the checking of mutations, for example, noting which test fails for each mutation and running this first in subsequent mutation checks. Significant effort has been put into ensuring that it can test code which uses custom class loading and reflection. This requires careful attention to class path handling and co-existence with foreign class-loaders. Jumble <b>is</b> <b>currently</b> used on <b>a</b> <b>continuous</b> basis within <b>an</b> agile programming environment with approximately 3 70, 000 lines of Java code under source control.

40|$|Abstract. In-furrow {{chemical}} inputs, such as fungicides and insecticides, <b>are</b> <b>currently</b> applied as <b>a</b> <b>continuous</b> band at planting. Focusing these applications at the seed, and {{minimizing the}} chemical applied between seeds could reduce in-furrow inputs significantly. The University of Tennessee Sensors and Controls Laboratory {{has developed a}} seed-specific applicator to apply discrete bands of liquid chemical to individual seeds at planting. First, seeds are detected in the seed tube, then tracked {{from the point of}} detection to the point of chemical application, and finally sprayed with a variable length chemical band as the seed lands in the furrow. Accuracy of the prototype applicator has been evaluated under various field conditions using cottonseed. In 2002, the applicator was calibrated using a trial-and-error method; 55 to 98 % of planted seeds were adequately sprayed, depending on planter speed [3. 2, 6. 4, 9. 7 km/hr (2, 4, 6 mph) ] and spray band length [2. 5 to 6. 6 cm (1. 0 to 2. 6 in.) ]. The calibration process was automated in 2003, and similar results were observed. Assuming a seeding rate of 9. 8 sd/m (3 sd/ft), material savings of 35 - 75 % are expected (depending on band length) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{validity}} of traditional categorical personality disorder diagnoses <b>is</b> <b>currently</b> re-evaluated from <b>a</b> <b>continuous</b> perspective, and the evolving DSM-V classification may describe personality disorders dimensionally. The utility of dimensional personality assessment, however, is unclear in violent offenders with severe personality pathology. Methods The temperament structure of 114 alcoholic violent offenders with antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) {{was compared to}} 84 offenders without ASPD, and 170 healthy controls. Inclusion occurred during a court-ordered mental examination preceded by homicide, assault, battery, rape or arson. Participants underwent assessment of temperament with the Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire (TPQ) and were diagnosed with DSM-III-R criteria. Results The typical temperament profile in violent offender having ASPD comprised high novelty seeking, high harm avoidance, and low reward dependence. A 21 % minority scored low in trait harm avoidance. Results, including the polarized harm avoidance dimension, are in accordance with Cloninger's hypothesis of dimensional description of ASPD. The low harm avoidance offenders committed less impulsive violence than high harm avoidance offenders. High harm avoidance was associated with comorbid antisocial personality disorder and borderline personality disorder. Conclusion Results indicate that the DSM based ASPD diagnosis in alcoholic violent offenders associates with impulsiveness and high novelty seeking but comprises {{two different types of}} ASPD associated with distinct second-order traits that possibly explain differences in type of violent criminality. Low harm avoidance offenders have many traits in common with high scorers on the Hare Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R). Results link high harm avoidance with broad personality pathology and argue for the usefulness of self-report questionnaires in clinical praxis. </p...|$|R
40|$|Fuelled by a {{sharp decline}} in the cost of large-screen display hardware, we <b>are</b> <b>currently</b> {{witnessing}} <b>a</b> <b>continuous</b> {{increase in the number of}} public displays being deployed in locations, such as airports, railway stations and shopping malls. These commercial deployments range from single displays in shop windows, to hundreds of displays in airports and train stations. In parallel, public display systems have provided researchers with a rich topic for research in a range of disciplines, including HCI, CSCW and sociology. However, once deployed, public displays represent a publicly visible “face” of the corporation or entity behind the deployment and the introduction of experimental, research-led content is therefore often undesirable. With advertising being a driving factor behind the deployment of many displays, stake holders are also less likely to give up valuable “airtime” to experimentation. Researchers willing to overcome these issues by deploying their own hardware, e. g. in a lab or campus environment, discover that the software packages used to drive commercial displays are tailored towards the needs of commercial deployments and are unable to meet the requirements for experimentation and research. As a result, researchers using public displays as a vehicle for their investigations normally create small-scale, closed deployments in lab or office environments aimed at investigating specific research questions. Applications and content are usually hand-crafted to best support the investigations at hand, and deployments are rather short-lived. While other research communities, e. g. in the context of PlanetLab or the Grid, have identified the benefits of creating open, shared, medium or large-scale research infrastructures, a similar move has so far not taken place in the context of public display networks. This thesis aims to provide the foundations for the creation of medium-scale, long-lived public display networks for experimentation and research. The thesis presents a distributed systems infrastructure and API for providing experimenters with the means for creating and running interactive experiments on public display networks. Moreover, it introduces a computational model that provides key abstractions over the hardware and software entities present in a public display network. The provided API is split into two parts: a low-level API, enabling experimenters to directly control the life-cycle and visibility of experimental content on displays, and a high-level API and scheduling service for scheduling experiments based on constraints, such as time, location, and the presence of Bluetooth devices (e. g. mobile phones). The low-level API features transactional semantics that provide atomicity, consistency and visual isolation for orchestrating experiments involving multiple displays. The constraint-based scheduling interface of the high-level API builds on and complements the low-level API, and provides experimenters with an easy-to-use interface for running and displaying content. The software infrastructure presented in this thesis has been implemented and deployed as part of the e-Campus public display network at Lancaster University. The software infrastructure is used on a daily basis for scheduling a mixture of research-led experimental content and informa- tional content. We report on both a quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the system based on performance measurements and a study of longitudinal use.
