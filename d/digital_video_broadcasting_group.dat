It is highly probable that the new standard will be based on DVB-T 2 standard. While DVB-T 2 was already developed with portable receivers as one of the target user groups, there are still open issues which can be improved. In this paper authors, first, state requirements for optimal transmission of H. 264 /SVC services in mobile broadcasting scenario. Next, they analyze whether those requirements can be applied in DVB-T 2 system and what kind of modification would be needed...|$|R
40|$|The next {{generation}} consumer level interactive services require reliable and constant communication for both mobile and static users. The <b>Digital</b> <b>Video</b> <b>Broadcasting</b> (DVB) <b>group</b> has exploited the rapidly increasing satellite {{technology for the}} provision of interactive services and launched a standard called <b>Digital</b> <b>Video</b> Broadcast through Return Channel Satellite (DYB-RCS). DVB-RCS relies on DVB-Satellite (DVB-S) {{for the provision of}} forward channel. The Digital Signal processing (DSP) implemented in the satellite channel adapter block of these standards use powerful channel coding and modulation techniques. The investigation is concentrated towards the Forward Error Correction (FEC) of the satellite channel adapter block, which will help in determining, how the technology copes with the varying channel conditions and user requirements(1) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{decision}} of the FCC in the United States to select an all-digital HDTV system {{was a surprise to}} HDTV supporters in Europe and Japan. Both had adopted hybrid systems with both analog and digital features. Western Europe was quicker than Japan to move away from its previous arrangements. It dropped HD-MAC in June 1993 and moved on to create the <b>Digital</b> <b>Video</b> <b>Broadcasting</b> (DVB) <b>group</b> to support digital television. It also responded by increasing EU support for wide-screen standard definition television programming and manufacturing. In Japan, NHK and its allies strongly resisted the idea of abandoning MUSE Hi- Vision but some of the major consumer electronics manufacturers and the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT) wanted to speed up the transition to an all-digital HDTV system. NHK was able to delay adoption of all-digital HDTV approach until mid- 1997. In this article, I consider these two stories separately, and then try to explain the differences in the reactions of the two regions. broadcasting, digital television, high-definition television, Japan, new media, Western Europe,...|$|R

In this paper, the design of dual frequency M-ary position phase shift keying (MPPSK) system which is suitable for, respectively, performing both data transmission and range measurement is proposed. The approach is based on MPPSK modulation waveforms utilized in <b>digital</b> <b>video</b> <b>broadcasting.</b> In particular, requirements that allow for employing such signals for range measurements with high accuracy and high range are investigated. Also, the relationship between the frequency difference of dual frequency MPPSK system and range accuracy is discussed. Moreover, the selection of MPPSK modulation parameter for data rate and ranging is considered. In addition to theoretical considerations, the paper presents system simulations and measurement results of new systems, demonstrating the high spectral utilization of integrated broadcasting and ranging applications...|$|R
