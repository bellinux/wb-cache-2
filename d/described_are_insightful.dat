A review in the online science fiction magazine Tor.com compared Gifts to an old fairytale, stating that it had the [...] "power of something told and retold". Reviewers wrote that Le Guin's description of Orrec's blindness was [...] "fiercely real", and that her prose had a poetic or lyrical quality to it. The exploration of the consequences of power and the coming of age themes has <b>been</b> <b>described</b> as <b>insightful</b> and provocative, while the construction of the story, and the Orrec and Gry's gradual understanding of the consequences of their choices, were also praised.|$|R
