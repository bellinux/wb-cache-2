40|$|Goose {{haemorrhagic}} polyomavirus (GHPV) provoke haemorrhagic nephritis and enteritis {{of domestic}} geese. Outbreaks were detected in European countries and caused economic losses for <b>goose</b> <b>keepers.</b> Domestic ducks may be infected with GHPV without any signs typical for geese. The genomic organisation of some isolates was described but the gene functions and the pathomechanisms {{of the virus}} was not precisely defined. Here we describe the genome sequence and structure of GHPV of a goose from a Hungarian goose flock showing characteristics of the haemorrhagic nephritis and enteritis. The GHPV genome investigated {{in this study was}} 5252 bp long and was very similar (99 % nucleotide identity) to sequences deposited in the GenBank. All the whole GHPV genomes possess the same ORFs in length, including the VP 1, VP 2, VP 3, ORF-X, t and T tumour antigens. Amino acid changes are detected mainly in the putative ORF-X region. Data about the GHPV genome imply a conserved genomic structure among isolates from different countries. Genomic and epidemiological studies may help vaccine development efforts and identify potential heterologous reservoirs of GHPV...|$|R
5000|$|Local {{chapters}} {{are called}} [...] "Ponds". Each Pond has six officers: Most Loyal Gander. the president; Supervisor of the Flock, vice-president; Custodian of the Goslings, warden; Guardian of the Pond, door guard; Wielder of the <b>Goose</b> Quill, secretary; <b>Keeper</b> of the Golden Goose Egg, treasurer. Some Ponds are {{further split into}} Puddles, where there are multiple cities in each state or province, and at one time one Puddle even had a Pothole. A fledgling group was even started in Australia. Blue Goose is governed by the Grand Nest, with each Pond sending two delegates, and which then elects a group of officers, one each {{from each of the}} five regions.|$|R
