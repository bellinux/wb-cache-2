5|$|By 1812, {{advisers}} to Alexander suggested {{the possibility of}} an invasion of the French Empire and the recapture of Poland. On receipt of intelligence reports on Russia's war preparations, Napoleon expanded his Grande Armée to more than 450,000 men. <b>He</b> <b>ignored</b> repeated advice against an invasion of the Russian heartland and prepared for an offensive campaign; on 24 June 1812 the invasion commenced.|$|E
5|$|On January 17, 2013, Keef was sued by Washington, D.C.-based {{promotion}} company Team Major for $75,000 for {{a missed}} show. According to the firm, Keef {{was supposed to}} perform at the IndigO2 Arena in London on December 29, 2012 but never showed. Neither Keef nor his label has given any kind of response {{as to why he}} missed the date. <b>He</b> <b>ignored</b> the lawsuit and the court sided with Team Major, ordering Keef to pay $230,019 to Team Major by default.|$|E

When Lisa wakes up one morning to find the pony (named Princess) lying next to her, she gallops into her parents' bedroom telling Homer she loves him. While Homer is happy, Marge is upset <b>he</b> <b>ignored</b> her warning {{that they could not}} afford the pony.|$|E
5|$|Hooker was routed by Lee at the Battle of Chancellorsville in May, but {{continued}} to command his troops for some weeks. <b>He</b> <b>ignored</b> Lincoln's order to divide his troops, and possibly force Lee {{to do the same}} in Harper's Ferry, and tendered his resignation, which Lincoln accepted. He was replaced by George Meade, who followed Lee into Pennsylvania for the Gettysburg Campaign, which was a victory for the Union, though Lee's army avoided capture. At the same time, after initial setbacks, Grant laid siege to Vicksburg and the Union navy attained some success in Charleston harbor.|$|E
5|$|MacArthur gave {{immunity}} to Shiro Ishii {{and other members}} of the bacteriological research units in exchange for germ warfare data based on human experimentation. He also exempted the Emperor and all members of the imperial family implicated in war crimes, including Princes Chichibu, Asaka, Takeda, Higashikuni and Fushimi, from criminal prosecutions. MacArthur confirmed that the emperor's abdication would not be necessary. In doing so, <b>he</b> <b>ignored</b> the advice of many members of the imperial family and Japanese intellectuals who publicly called for the abdication of the Emperor and the implementation of a regency.|$|E

5|$|His {{basketball}} {{performance in}} high school was unimpressive. He came off the bench to average four points per game (ppg). His stepmother informed him that when he graduated high school he would be {{thrown out of the}} house. Chris had been able to leave home on a football scholarship and would later play in the National Football League, but Washington himself had nowhere to go. He trained for three hours a day {{toward the end of his}} senior season, and showed up uninvited at a playground game featuring top high school players from Washington and Pennsylvania, where he talked his way into the game. Tom Young, who had recently left his job as an assistant coach at Maryland University to become head coach at American University, saw him play there, and although Washington did not perform particularly well, Young was impressed by his hustle and how <b>he</b> <b>ignored</b> the poor treatment he received from the people who organized the game.|$|E
5|$|In 1795, Rebecca and {{he moved}} back to Kentucky, living in present Nicholas County on land owned by their son Daniel Morgan Boone. The next year, Boone applied to Isaac Shelby, the first {{governor}} of the new state of Kentucky, for a contract to widen the Wilderness Road into a wagon route, but the contract was awarded to someone else. Meanwhile, lawsuits over conflicting land claims continued {{to make their way}} through the Kentucky courts. Boone's remaining land claims were sold off to pay legal fees and taxes, but he no longer paid attention to the process. In 1798, a warrant was issued for Boone's arrest after <b>he</b> <b>ignored</b> a summons to testify in a court case, although the sheriff never found him. That same year, the Kentucky assembly named Boone County in his honor.|$|E
5|$|Koufax had {{his strong}} season despite an injured {{pitching}} hand. While batting in April, Koufax had been jammed by a pitch from Earl Francis. A numbness developed in Koufax's index finger {{on his left}} hand, and the finger became cold and white. Koufax was pitching better than ever, however, so <b>he</b> <b>ignored</b> the problem, hoping that the condition would clear up. By July, though, his entire hand was becoming numb and {{he was unable to}} complete some games. In a start in Cincinnati, his finger split open after one inning. A vascular specialist determined that Koufax had a crushed artery in his palm. Ten days of experimental medicine successfully reopened the artery. Koufax finally was able to pitch again in September, when the team was locked in a tight pennant race with the Giants. But after the long layoff, Koufax was ineffective in three appearances as the Giants caught the Dodgers {{at the end of the}} regular season, forcing a three-game playoff.|$|E

5|$|Lines {{had been}} {{hardening}} {{on the matter}} of slavery, and Democrats accused Harrison of being an abolitionist because of his membership, a half century earlier, in the Richmond Humane Society, an anti-slavery group; he had posted a mixed record on the issue while in Congress. On August 20, he gave a speech on the slave question at Carthage, Ohio, and stated that what occurred regarding slavery in a state was that state's business alone. <b>He</b> <b>ignored</b> the question of slavery in the District of Columbia and in the territories, both {{under the jurisdiction of the}} federal government. The general had pledged that his door would always be open to his old soldiers, but others came as well, and he hosted an unending series of guests. This was especially difficult for him on Sundays, when his wife forbade political discussion. The economy continued to be poor in 1840, a fact that the Whigs never ceased to press, arguing that Van Buren had done little, and that Harrison's inauguration was needed to put a stop to the hard times.|$|E
5|$|Madhoji Bhonsle, {{also known}} as Appa Saheb, {{consolidated}} his power in Nagpur after {{the murder of his}} cousin, the imbecile ruler Parsoji Bhonsle. He entered into a treaty with the British on 27 May 1816. <b>He</b> <b>ignored</b> the request of the British Resident Jenkins to refrain from contact with Baji Rao II. Jenkins asked Appa Saheb to disband his growing concentration of troops and come to the residency, which he also refused to do. Appa Saheb openly declared support for the Peshwa, who was already fighting the British near Pune. As it was now clear that a battle was in the offing, Jenkins asked for reinforcements from nearby British East India Company troops. He already had about 1,500 men under Lieutenant-Colonel Hopentoun Scott. Jenkins sent word for Colonel Adams to march to Nagpur with his troops. Like other Maratha leaders, Appa Shaeb employed Arabs in his army. They were typically involved in holding fortresses. While they were known to be among the bravest of troops, they were not amenable to discipline and order. The total strength of the Marathas was about 18,000.|$|E
5|$|Truman's unit {{joined in}} a massive {{prearranged}} assault barrage on September 26, 1918, {{at the opening of}} the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. They advanced with difficulty over pitted terrain to follow the infantry, and they set up an observation post west of Cheppy. On September 27, Truman saw through his binoculars an enemy artillery battery setting up across a river in a position allowing them to fire upon the neighboring 28th Division. Truman's orders limited him to targets facing the 35th Division, but <b>he</b> <b>ignored</b> this and patiently waited until the Germans had walked their horses well away from their guns, ensuring they could not relocate out of range of Truman's battery, and then he ordered his men to open fire. The enemy battery was destroyed. His actions were credited with saving the lives of 28th Division soldiers who otherwise would have come under fire from the Germans. Truman was given a dressing down by his regimental commander, Colonel Karl D. Klemm, but he was not court-martialed or otherwise punished.|$|E

5|$|He used a {{somewhat}} negative advertising campaign {{that seemed to}} have the intended initial effect of boosting him to serious contention. His 1988 campaign was based on the platform of supply-side economics and inner-city enterprise zones. In Bare Knuckles and Back Rooms: My Life in American Politics, campaign chairman Rollins described Kemp as a candidate with foibles. Kemp's campaign managers say he was unmanageable: <b>he</b> <b>ignored</b> timers on his speeches, refused to call contributors, and refused to practice for debates. A humbling Super Tuesday, in which his 39delegate total was fewer than eventual nominee and President Bush and both Dole and Pat Robertson, ended his campaign. After withdrawing from the race, he was still considered a contender for the Vice President nomination. In 1989, the Kemps switched their official residence from Hamburg, New York to Bethesda, Maryland, their residence {{at the time of his}} death. In 1994, Kemp's 1988 campaign reached a settlement with the Federal Election Commission by agreeing to pay $120,000 in civil penalties for 1988 campaign election law violations for, among other things, excessive contributions, improper direct corporate donations, press overbilling, exceeding spending limits in Iowa and New Hampshire, and failure to reimburse corporations for providing air transportation.|$|E
5|$|On 6 August 1915, Mackay was {{involved}} in the Battle of Lone Pine. When the attack began, Mackay went over the top at the head of an attack. <b>He</b> <b>ignored</b> the first Turkish trench, taking a direct line to his objective. Firing from the hip, he shot and killed several Turks in the trenches below. Mackay positioned himself at the junction of two trenches, shooting down more enemy troops. When no others appeared, he came to the belief that the trenches were in Australian hands and ran across the junction into a wide bay. The first man who attempted to follow was shot dead, as were the next two after him. The rest decided not to follow. Mackay took up a position on a fire step, a raised part of the trench floor which allows men to fire over the top. Three Turkish soldiers appeared in the trench. Mackay attempted to fire but his magazine was empty. He lunged at the Turks, grazing one and making all three run. Mackay then instructed his party to fortify the position with sandbags. As the barricade was built up, it became possible {{for the rest of the}} party to join Mackay. The post became the north eastern corner of the new Australian position at Lone Pine. It was in an exposed position and came under hand grenade attack from Turkish troops. Mackay was slightly injured in one such attack. When Lieutenant Jack Massie was sent to relieve Mackay during the night, Mackay refused to leave the post.|$|E
5|$|Zosimus {{provides}} the lengthiest {{account of the}} games (at Historia Nova 2.1–7), but does not mention Philip. The games had a starring role in Zosimus' scheme of Roman history. To him, the fortune of the empire was intimately related {{to the practice of}} the traditional civic rites. Any emperor who revived or supported those rites—Augustus, Claudius, Domitian, Septimius Severus—earns Zosimus' credit, while the emperor who ended them, Constantine I, earns his condemnation. All the misfortune of the 4th century can be directly attributed to Constantine's discontinuation of the old rites. In this context, Shahîd argues, Zosimus' silence on Philip's Christianity and Philip's involvement in the games makes sense. First, it would have given lie to his thesis on that the practice of the traditional rites guaranteed the fortunes of empire, since the period following the games was hardly a happy one (and this argument remains valid even if both Philip's Christianity and Zosimus' awareness of the tradition is denied). And second, it would have dulled his attack on Constantine by disentangling the potent alignment between imperial disaster, Christianity, and the traditional cult. The last emperor to celebrate the games was also the first emperor to embrace Christianity. The incongruity of this fact proved too much for the historian to handle, so <b>he</b> <b>ignored</b> it.|$|E

5|$|On December 23, Flood {{ordered an}} {{examination}} of Mary Celeste, which {{was carried out by}} John Austin, Surveyor of Shipping, with the assistance of a diver, Ricardo Portunato. Austin noted cuts {{on each side of the}} bow, caused, he thought, by a sharp instrument, and found possible traces of blood on the captain's sword. His report emphasized that the ship did not appear to have been struck by heavy weather, citing a phial of sewing machine oil found upright in its place. Austin did not acknowledge that the phial might have been replaced since the abandonment, nor did the court raise this point. Portunato's report on the hull concluded that the ship had not been involved in a collision or run aground. A further inspection by a group of Royal Naval captains endorsed Austin's opinion that the cuts on the bow had been caused deliberately. They also discovered stains on one of the ship's rails that might have been blood, together with a deep mark possibly caused by an axe. These findings strengthened Flood's suspicions that human wrongdoing rather than natural disaster lay behind the mystery. On January 22, 1873, he sent the reports to the Board of Trade in London, adding his own conclusion that the crew had got at the alcohol (<b>he</b> <b>ignored</b> its non-potability) and murdered the Briggs family and the ship's officers in a drunken frenzy. They had cut the bows to simulate a collision, then fled in the yawl to suffer an unknown fate. Flood thought that Morehouse and his men were hiding something, specifically that Mary Celeste had been abandoned in a more easterly location, and that the log had been doctored. He could not accept that Mary Celeste could have traveled so far while unmanned.|$|E
