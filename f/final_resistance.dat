5|$|Nobunaga granted Echizen to {{his general}} Shibata Katsuie, and in 1576 Katsuie's nephew Sakuma Morimasa {{penetrated}} deeper into Kaga, capturing Miyukizuka. In 1580, Morimasa destroyed the capital, Oyama Gobo. The same year, Ishiyama Hongan-ji surrendered. Despite {{the resistance of}} the Ikkō-Ikki being effectively suppressed, a few Kaga ikki fled the plains and entrenched themselves in the mountains at the fortified temples Torigoe and Futoge. Shibata Katsuie captured these strongholds in 1581, but the garrisons he established were over-run and the temples recaptured. Still in the year 1581, Katsuie and Sakuma Morimasa again recaptured the temples, killing all the Ikkō-ikki at the sites. Despite this, in 1582, resistance elements again recaptured Torigoe and Futoge. A third attack was mounted by Morimasa, and this time the <b>final</b> <b>resistance</b> elements were eliminated, ending the last vestiges of ikki rule in Kaga.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} 63 BC, Hybrida went to Etruria {{to assist}} the praetor, Quintus Metellus Celer, in {{preventing}} Catiline escaping through the Alps and into Gaul. Catiline, hoping that Hybrida might choose to help him, choose to engage him and his consular army rather than the forces under the praetor. Hybrida, however, had given command of the army to his legate, Marcus Petreius, having either suffered a bout of gout or pretending to have. Catiline put up his <b>final</b> <b>resistance</b> in Pistoria, Etruria with an army of 3000 men. Here, Petreius and his soldiers massacred the entire army, killed and beheaded Catiline, and then sent his head to Rome. Hybrida, having adhered to the agreement that he had with Cicero and the Senate, was granted the governorship of Macedonia {{at the end of}} his consulship.|$|E
25|$|The {{principal}} fighting {{occurred between}} the Bolshevik Red Army {{and the forces}} of the White Army. Many foreign armies warred against the Red Army, notably the Allied Forces, yet many volunteer foreigners fought in both sides of the Russian Civil War. Other nationalist and regional political groups also participated in the war, including the Ukrainian nationalist Green Army, the Ukrainian anarchist Black Army and Black Guards, and warlords such as Ungern von Sternberg. The most intense fighting took place from 1918 to 1920. Major military operations ended on 25 October 1922 when the Red Army occupied Vladivostok, previously held by the Provisional Priamur Government. The last enclave of the White Forces was the Ayano-Maysky District on the Pacific coast. The majority of the fighting ended in 1920 with the defeat of General Pyotr Wrangel in the Crimea, but a notable resistance in certain areas continued until 1923 (e.g., Kronstadt Uprising, Tambov Rebellion, Basmachi Revolt, and the <b>final</b> <b>resistance</b> of the White movement in the Far East).|$|E

500|$|The idea {{of using}} the sturdy Treasury Building as a refuge of last resort has some precedent. Immediately after the Battle of Fort Sumter in 1861, there was concern that an attack on Washington was imminent. General Winfield Scott had the {{building}} readied {{to be used as}} a [...] "last stand" [...] by the federal government in the event the capital city was overrun. The exterior of the building was ringed with sandbags and soldiers, and inside corridors and hallways leading to the underground vaults were barricaded [...] "floor to ceiling". In the event of an unstoppable assault against the capital, plans had been drawn up for surviving U.S. Army forces to fight from three centers of <b>final</b> <b>resistance</b> with the Treasury Building as the [...] "citadel" [...] of the third. Under the army's plans, troops assigned to defend the White House would fight a delaying action in President's Park to cover the evacuation of Abraham Lincoln into the Treasury vaults.|$|E
500|$|On Frohman's arrival, Ravenholm is {{depicted}} as a peaceful, bright, and cheerful place devoid of any Combine elements, but [...] "terrorized" [...] by Father Grigori. After adjusting, Gordon becomes accustomed to the town, but unintentionally discloses the town's location to Dr. Breen, who immediately orders his forces to [...] "bomb {{the shit out of}} them". The town is fired on with headcrabs, killing many and turning others into zombies. Frohman himself is attacked by a headcrab and turns into a zombie too, yet retains his free will; and after a while his headcrab dies of malnutrition, which is attributed to his lack of intelligence. With Father Grigori's help, Frohman escapes Ravenholm, now the zombie-infested nightmare seen when Freeman visits it in the game, and presses on to Nova Prospekt. After surviving several more hazards, he reaches the coast. Here, after passing the <b>final</b> <b>resistance</b> base and an Antlion-infested beach, Frohman encounters an Antlion Guard, which is killed by a Vortigaunt, an alien race helping the humans in the game. This allows Frohman to retrieve bugbait from the dead creature, with which he can control the Antlions.|$|E

6000|$|In her {{own room}} she {{unleashed}} the strange bonds on her feelings and suffered their recurrent surge and strife, until relief and calmness returned to her. Then came a flashing uplift of soul, a great and beautiful exaltation. Lenore felt {{that she had been}} gifted with incalculable power. She had pierced Dorn's fatalistic consciousness with the truth and glory of possible life, as opposed to the dark and evil morbidity of war. She saw for herself the wonderful and terrible stairs of sand which women had been climbing all the ages, and must climb on to the heights of solid rock, of equality, of salvation for the human race. She saw woman, the primitive, the female of the species, but she saw her also as the mother of the species, made to save as well as perpetuate, learning from the agony of child-birth and child-care the meaning of Him who said, [...] "Thou shalt not kill!" [...] Tremendous would be the <b>final</b> <b>resistance</b> of woman to the brutality of man. Women were to be the saviors of humanity. It seemed so simple and natural that it could not be otherwise. Lenore realized, with a singular conception of the splendor of its truth, that when most women had found themselves, their mission in life, as she had found hers, then would come an end to violence, to greed, to hate, to war, to the black and hideous imperfection of mankind.|$|E

40|$|A {{comparison}} {{program has}} been established concerning the simulation of the static behaviour of steel columns submitted to fire [I]. The stress strain relationships in steel are those recommended in EC 3, part 10 121. The five numerical codes used in this comparison are briefly described, namely CEFICOSS, DIANA, LENAS, SAFIR and SISMEF. A description of 8 tests is given: Lee's frame at ambient and at elevated temperatures, an eccentrically loaded column at ambient temperature, at uniform elevated temperature and under I S 0 heating and finally an axially loaded column in the same three cases (ambient, uniform and ISO).

40|$|Conductivity types (i. e., insulator, semiconductor, and conductor) can be tuned {{by varying}} {{the size of}} {{metallic}} nanoparticles. DNA origami, a molecular self-assembly technique, has promise to programmatically self-assemble nanoparticles (NPs) with nanometer precision. The work presented here demonstrates the programmatic self-assembly of AuNPs on DNA origami nanotubes (NTs). DNA origami NTs were also functionalized with positively charged Au clusters. DNA origami NTs, both bare and functionalized with Au, were electrically characterized using DC current-voltage (DC-IV) measurements. The measurements showed that bare, undecorated DNA NTs behaved as an insulator, whereas linear, ohmic conductivity was observed for Au enhanced Au decorated NTs. Resistances varied between 60 Ω to 8 MΩ after 15 minutes of electroless Au deposition. After SEM imaging, a decrease in resistances was recorded for several Au enhanced AuNP DNA NTs with <b>final</b> <b>resistances</b> ranging from ~ 48 Ω to ~ 170 Ω. DNA origami NTs were also conductive with linear, ohmic behavior and resistances in the MΩ range after 9 minutes of Au enhancement. These results show that by functionalizing the DNA origami NT with AuNPs or Au clusters and increasing {{the size of the}} Au, a conductive DNA origami NT could be fabricated. Au-functionalized DNA origami NTs with tunable conductivity may have a variety of electronic and optoelectronic device applications...|$|R
