In fact, Johnson quit amicably Girlschool in 1999, followed by Lamb in 2000. They were replaced by new lead guitarist Jackie 'Jax' Chambers and by Enid Williams, who finally rejoined the group after eighteen years. Johnson, who {{had been diagnosed with}} cancer, and Lamb remained anyway strictly associated with the other band members.|$|E
5|$|The {{extremely}} nested pseudonymity of {{this work}} adds a problem of interpretation. A and B are {{the authors of the}} work, Eremita is the editor. Kierkegaard's role <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> appears to be that he deliberately sought to disconnect himself from the points of view expressed in his works, although the absurdity of his pseudonyms' bizarre Latin names proves that he did not hope to thoroughly conceal his identity from the reader. Kierkegaard's Papers first edition VIII(2), B 81 - 89 explain this method in writing. On interpretation there is also much to be found in The Point of View of My Work as an Author.|$|E

Inspired by the success, Hsu Li-kong collaborated with Lee in their second film, The Wedding Banquet (1993), which won the Golden Bear at the 43rd Berlin International Film Festival and was nominated as the Best Foreign Language Film in both the Golden Globe and the Academy Awards. <b>In</b> <b>all,</b> <b>this</b> film collected eleven Taiwanese and international awards and made Lee a rising star.

25|$|All <b>in</b> <b>all,</b> <b>this</b> {{provided}} AAC with a {{total of}} 36 various E, F, G and H model F-82s. By 1952, attrition had claimed many of the Twin Mustangs which were assigned to the squadron. The occasional long-range reconnaissance flight over the Bering Sea was still flown, given that the range of the Twin Mustang was much greater than that of the F-94. The right seat of the aircraft was usually occupied by an experienced flight mechanic. With the long patrol flights with high-hour aircraft, pilots began having more and more mechanical problems that forced them to land on crude flight strips. The mechanic usually could repair the aircraft well enough to get airborne and head straight back to Ladd AFB.|$|E
25|$|The {{distribution}} of these European/Middle Eastern immigrants was not uniform across the country. Most newcomers {{settled in the}} coastal cities and the farmlands of Buenos Aires, Santa Fe, Córdoba and Entre Ríos. For example, the 1914 National Census showed that, of almost three million people −2,965,805 to be exact- living in the provinces of Buenos Aires and Santa Fe, 1,019,872 were European immigrants, and {{one and a half}} million more were children of European mothers; <b>in</b> <b>all,</b> <b>this</b> community comprised at least 84.9% of this region's population. The same dynamic was less evident in the rural areas of the northwestern provinces, however: immigrants (mostly of Syrian-Lebanese origin) represented a mere 2.6% (about 15,600) of a total rural population of 600,000 in Jujuy, Salta, Tucumán, Santiago del Estero and Catamarca.|$|E

25|$|In 1964 the Random House {{publishing}} {{company and the}} Kosmos {{publishing company}} started to publish the translated 43 original books. In 1979 the German publisher Europa started a radio drama based on those original 43 books. In 1993 Kosmos started to publish new written books by German authors which were and still are continued as radio dramas in Germany. All <b>in</b> <b>all,</b> <b>this</b> {{would result in a}} canon of 190 books (6 books per year, 3 during spring and 3 during autumn) and 183 radio dramas published as of September 2016. Because of a litigation between Europa and Kosmos which disallowed the use of the names Europa used, they published a 9 episode radio drama named DiE Dr3i between 2006 and 2007. DiE Dr3i were mostly identical to Die Drei ??? and they also used the same German voice-actors, but they had to change the names of the characters to the original English names. DiE Dr3i were stopped when the litigation ended and Die drei ??? started again.|$|E
