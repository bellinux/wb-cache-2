500|$|In debut {{footage of}} Street Fighter V, Mika is seen {{slapping}} her buttocks {{as part of}} her Critical Art attack. The decision not to show the animation in the North American version of the game was a subject of controversy, leading to a petition to restore it. According to producer Yoshinori Ono regarding not showing <b>her</b> <b>butt</b> slap, [...] "Those changes came up internally. We decided to remove that because we want the biggest possible number of people to play, and we don’t want to have something in the game that might make someone uncomfortable." [...] Some other shots, including the entrance animation for Cammy, were also replaced.|$|E

6000|$|For her {{conscience}} {{was really}} smitten. Of what use was she in the world? Major Campbell {{had talked to}} her often about her duties to this person and to that, of this same necessity of being useful; but she had escaped from the thought, {{as we have seen}} her, in laughing at poor little Scoutbush on the very same score. But why had not Major Campbell's sermons touched her heart as this one had? Who can tell? Who is there among us to whom an oft-heard truth has not become a tiresome and superfluous commonplace, till one day it has flashed before us utterly new, indubitable, not to be disobeyed, written in letters of fire across the whole vault of heaven? All one can say is, that her time was not come. Besides, she looked on Major Campbell as a being utterly superior to herself; and that very superiority, while it allowed her to be as familiar with him as she chose, excused her in her own eyes from opening to him her real heart. She could safely jest with him, let him pet her, play at being his daughter, while she felt that between him and her lay a gulf as wide as between earth and heaven; and that very notion comforted her in her naughtiness; for in that case, of course, his code of morals was not meant for her; and while she took his warnings (as many of them at least as she chose), she thought herself by no means bound to follow his examples. She all but worshipped him as her guardian angel: but she was not meant for an angel herself; so she could indulge freely in those little escapades and frivolities for which she was born, and then, whenever frightened, run for shelter under his wings. But to hear the same, and even loftier words, from the lips of the curate, whom she had made her toy, almost <b>her</b> <b>butt,</b> was to have them brought down unexpectedly and painfully to her own level. If this was his ideal, why ought it not to be hers? Was she not his equal, perhaps his superior? And so her very pride humbled her, as she said to herself,--"Then I ought to be useful. I can be;--will be!" ...|$|E

50|$|Her in-game {{model was}} {{different}} in the American version of the game, with her revealing leotard being modified to cover <b>her</b> legs and <b>butt.</b> <b>Her</b> appearance in the European version, and in the animated cutscenes and title cards of the American version remained unchanged.|$|R
6000|$|How {{did she do}} it? In {{the word}} [...] "missing" [...] there is a horrible depth of doubt and speculation. Did she go quickly from under the men's feet, or did she resist to the end, letting the sea batter her to pieces, start <b>her</b> <b>butts,</b> wrench <b>her</b> frame, load her with an {{increasing}} weight of salt water, and, dismasted, unmanageable, rolling heavily, her boats gone, her decks swept, had she wearied her men half to death with the unceasing labour at the pumps before she sank with them like a stone? ...|$|R

50|$|Sam {{then goes}} to Hope's room one last time. She thanks {{him for his}} help and kisses him. He then finds the scar on <b>her</b> <b>butt</b> - she was the mystery woman with the help and {{encouragement}} of Annie. She tells him her story of sadness. The night they first met, her friend Jesse picked her up. They {{have known each other}} since grade school and were best friends. But then he makes a move on her, forcing himself when she refuses. He says that guys don't want girls as friends, they only want girlfriends. She escapes through the sunroof, cutting <b>her</b> <b>butt</b> on a sharp metal piece. Sam and Hope get together. Annie consoles her and says she will help her find out if Sam is a true friend. The narration ends here.|$|E
6000|$|They lay in each other's {{arms and}} had no notion that they were observed. Yet two figures {{suddenly}} appeared among the trees above them. [...] "Here's shade," [...] began Hewet, when Rachel suddenly stopped dead. They saw {{a man and woman}} lying on the ground beneath them, rolling slightly this way and that as the embrace tightened and slackened. The man then sat upright and the woman, who now appeared to be Susan Warrington, lay back upon the ground, with her eyes shut and an absorbed look upon her face, as though she were not altogether conscious. Nor could you tell from her expression whether she was happy, or had suffered something. When Arthur again turned to <b>her,</b> <b>butting</b> <b>her</b> as a lamb butts a ewe, Hewet and Rachel retreated without a word. Hewet felt uncomfortably shy.|$|R

60|$|They {{dispersed}} {{laughing and}} followed by O'Moy's scowling eyes. It annoyed him that his wife's thoughtless conduct should render <b>her</b> the <b>butt</b> of such jests as these, and perhaps a subject for lewd gossip. He would speak to her about it later. Meanwhile the marshal had linked arms with him.|$|R
5000|$|In the song's prelude {{there is}} a {{conversation}} between two (presumably) thin, white valley girls.

She's just so ... black!", at which point Sir Mix-a-Lot begins rapping of his love for big-bottomed girls.|$|E

5000|$|Amy {{has several}} tattoos {{which do not}} appear to recur between episodes. One [...] "obscene tattoo" [...] (which appears blurred because its design {{requires}} a resolution unmatched by modern TVs) was shown to be on her upper left arm in [...] "A Fishful of Dollars"; and in [...] "Three Hundred Big Boys", she buys a talking tattoo of a devil, which resembles the trademark of hot rod artist Coop, on her right arm. In the same episode, three other tattoos are implied to be on <b>her</b> <b>butt,</b> one of which is a horse of some kind; the other two had the voices {{of a man and a}} woman. However, in [...] "Proposition Infinity" [...] she claims to have a tattoo of her mother on <b>her</b> <b>butt</b> and shows it to an inmate. None of these are ever seen or mentioned in any episode other than the ones they are first shown in, despite numerous occasions in which their locations are visible, apparently lacking said tattoos.|$|E

With <b>her</b> <b>butt</b> {{in front of his}} face, Akiyoshi is treated to [...] "certain advantages" [...] of the position. Perverted scenes at their best!! The boss did not question this matter, and continued observing the newbie's virility.|$|E

5000|$|Jim Nieto, {{the martial}} arts {{instructor}} who coached her before the Olympics, said it seemed fishy that she, after {{taking part in the}} Opening Ceremony, was reportedly injured so close to her fight date, because top competitors generally don't fight the day before their competition.
