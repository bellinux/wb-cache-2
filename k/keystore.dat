40|$|While PKI {{applications}} {{differ in}} how they use keys, all applications share one assumption: users have keypairs. In previous work, we established that desktop <b>keystores</b> are not safe places to store private keys, because the TCB is too large.

Since we would like to use desktops as PKI clients and cannot realistically expect to redesign the entire desktop, this paper presents a system that works within the confines of modern desktops to shrink the TCB needed for PKI applications. Our system (called Secure Hardware Enhanced MyProxy (SHEMP)) shrinks the TCB in space and allows the TCB's size to vary over time and over various application sensitivity levels, thus making desktops usable for PKI...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe {{analyze the}} {{security}} of Android <b>KeyStore,</b> a system service whose purpose is to shield users credentials and cryptographic keys. The <b>KeyStore</b> protects the integrity and the confidentiality of keys by using a particular encryption scheme. Our main results are twofold. First, we formally prove that the used encryption scheme does not provide integrity, which means that an attacker is able to undetectably modify the stored keys. Second, we exploit this flaw to de ne a forgery attack breaching the security guaranteed by the <b>KeyStore.</b> In particular, our attack allows a malicious application to make mobile apps to unwittingly perform secure protocols using weak keys. The threat is concrete: the attacker goes undetected while compromising {{the security of}} users. Our findings highlight an important fact: intuition often goes wrong when security is concerned. Unfortunately, system designers still tend to choose cryptographic schemes not for their proved security but for their apparent simplicity. We show, once again, {{that this is not}} a good choice, since it usually results in severe consequences for the whole underlying system...|$|E
40|$|In theory, PKI {{can provide}} a {{flexible}} and strong way to authenticate users in distributed information systems. In practice, much is being invested in realizing this vision via client-side SSL and various client <b>keystores.</b> However, whether this works depends on whether what the machines do with the private keys matches what the humans think they do: whether a server operator can conclude from an SSL request authenticated with a user’s private key that the user was aware of and approved that request. Exploring this vision, we demonstrate via a series of experiments that this assumption does not hold with standard desktop tools, even if the browser user does all the right things. A fundamental rethinking of the trust, usage, and storage model might result in more effective tools for achieving the PKI vision. ...|$|R
40|$|Cryptographic {{algorithms}} {{have already}} become a basic technique {{used in many}} application areas, like confidentiality and content protection. However, the big question of key management still remains unanswered. As a part of it, to efficiently use public key cryptography, we require a good local storage system to guarantee the confidentiality and availability of keys and certificates. In this paper, {{we take a look}} at local key and certificate storage in JDK 1. 3. We discuss the requirements for such systems, evaluate the standard JDK solution, <b>KeyStore,</b> and finally propose an improved solution that does not suffer from the many shortcomings of <b>KeyStore.</b> 1.

40|$|Abstract. In key-insulated cryptography, {{there are}} many private keys with {{different}} indexes and a single, fixed public key. When the trust model includes multiple Certification Authorities (CAs), {{it can be used}} to shorten the verification path and mitigate the damage caused by the compromise of a CA’s private key. Existing work requires that the total number of CAs be fixed and that a trusted <b>keystore</b> store all private keys. This paper presents a hierarchical key-insulated signature scheme, called HKI, which converts existing key-insulated methods to a hierarchical scheme. Our scheme allows the system to repeatedly generate a new private key for a new CA and also provides two important features, namely a shortened verification path and mitigated damage. By basing our approach on a general key-insulated scheme, we have made it possible to take advantage of any future improvements in computation complexity, key length, or robustness in current key-insulated methods. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The paper {{proposes a}} {{combined}} hardware/software approach for realizing high performance, intrusion- and faulttolerant services. The approach is demonstrated for (yet not limited to) an Attribute Authority server, {{which provides a}} compelling application due to its stringent performance and security requirements. The key element of the proposed architecture is an FPGA-based, parallel crypto-engine providing (1) optimally dimensioned RSA Processors for efficient execution of computationally intensive RSA signatures and (2) a <b>KeyStore</b> facility used as tamper-resistant storage for preserving secret keys. To achieve linear speed-up (with the number of RSA Processors) and deadlock-free execution in spite of resource-sharing and scheduling/synchronization issues, we have resorted {{to a number of}} performance enhancing techniques (e. g., use of different clock domains, optimal balance between internal and external parallelism) and have formally modeled and mechanically proved our crypto-engine with the Spin model checker. At the software level, the architecture combines active replication and threshold cryptography, but in contrast with previous work, the code of our replicas is multithreaded so it can efficiently use an attached parallel crypto-engine to compute an Attribute Authority partial signature (as required by threshold cryptography). Resulting replicated systems that exhibit nondeterministic behavior, which cannot be handled with conventional replication approaches. Our architecture is based on a Preemptive Deterministic Scheduling algorithm to govern scheduling of replica threads and guarantee strong replica consistency. I...|$|E
