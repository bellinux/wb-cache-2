50|$|This part of {{the route}} runs almost entirely along the <b>dismantled</b> <b>track</b> bed of the Hull and Hornsea Railway and {{is known as the}} Hornsea Rail Trail. The path takes a {{straight}} route over the flat Holderness plain and is 15 mi in length.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: The site of {{the former}} station in 2009. The station {{building}} and platforms occupied {{almost all of the}} area in {{the bottom half of the}} picture, and the route of the <b>dismantled</b> <b>tracks</b> can be seen heading towards the top right of the picture.|$|R

50|$|Located in {{the middle}} of town, the station is {{composed}} of a two-storey building, a wooden shed and a platform serving the first track. The second track has no platform and is rarely used. On the platform are located the rests of a rail, part of a <b>dismantled</b> <b>track</b> system used by freight wagons.|$|E
5000|$|The {{court found}} that Preseault’s 5th Amendment Rights, {{specifically}} his right of just compensation, had been violated since the land in question was surely his legal property. The easement had been abandoned by the railroad when it <b>dismantled</b> <b>track</b> and thus it never had {{the legal right to}} turn easement rights over to the ICC.|$|E
5000|$|Since December 2015, {{the trains}} of the Westerwald-Sieg-Bahn (RB 90) from Limburg/Altenkirchen via Au (Sieg) have {{continued}} via Betzdorf to Siegen/Kreuztal. For the RB 90 service towards Altenkirchen there are additional trains in the peak from Monday to Friday, which start at track 101, {{for which a}} new set of points was specially installed to allow trains to reverse on the track and run towards Au (Sieg). Moreover, the journeys on the Rothaar Railway (RB 93) via Kreuztal and Erndtebrück to Bad Berleburg now start in Betzdorf rather than Siegen, where they formerly started. Since 2012, various media have repeatedly reported that there were plans that the previously <b>dismantled</b> <b>track</b> 107 would be restored for route RB 93 towards Erndtebrück; it has been occupied by a pedestrian link between the commuter parking area and the station. Instead of the pedestrian crossing, the already existing pedestrian subway between tracks 106 and 113 is being extended to the parking area. The start of construction of the track was delayed by a year to October 2016 and the rehabilitation of tracks 105 and 106 was interrupted in December 2016 by poor weather. Track 107 is now due to go into operation [...] "in the spring" [...] of 2017. Construction of the subway is [...] "possible at any time" [...] and was due to be [...] "completed in February 2017".|$|E
50|$|The {{first new}} railway line will be {{recorded}} in March 1947 after the war; yet while the car hastily repaired, <b>dismantled</b> <b>tracks</b> {{and have been}} rebuilt, {{was already on the}} 7th. From Mahlsdorf it was a station further into the Brandenburg and Hoppegarten. Approximately one and a half years later, Strausberg also connected to the grid. The construction, however, was just as quickly realized, as already in the Adolf Hitler preparations had been made for this purpose.|$|R
50|$|The old station {{building}} {{is to be}} conserved as a KTMB Mini Museum for the Southern Region. As of October 2010, the old JB station had its platform 2 and its <b>tracks</b> <b>dismantled</b> with one <b>track</b> and platform remaining for the future mini museum exhibits.|$|R
50|$|Much of the <b>dismantled</b> <b>trackbed</b> {{is intact}} {{but only a}} few {{sections}} are public rights of way. The trackbed from Draycote (southwest of the former Dunchurch station) to Birdingbury has been surfaced by Sustrans as part of National Cycle Network Route 41. The long straight stretch of trackbed from the A423 across Marton Moor to the cutting near Hunningham is mostly clear of undergrowth and is regularly used by walkers; however, there is no legal right of way and this section can be very muddy in winter.|$|R

5000|$|On 7 January 1963 British Railways withdrew {{passenger}} services between Princes Risborough and Oxford, closed all intermediate stations including Tiddington, and <b>dismantled</b> the <b>track</b> between Thame and [...] Morris Cowley.|$|R
2500|$|Previously, {{there was}} a railway station in Hayfield, {{at the site of}} the current bus station, {{terminating}} the Hayfield branch line to New Mills; this was axed in 1970 by Richard Beeching to save public money, but with increasing car use and good road links with Manchester, Hayfield remains a magnet for those who enjoy outdoor pursuits. The <b>dismantled</b> <b>trackbed</b> of the railway line now forms a popular [...] linear recreational route, the Sett Valley Trail. The bus station is at the eastern end of it where many walkers and horse riders visit; there is a car park, toilet and tourist information centre.|$|R

50|$|Nistertal-Bad Marienberg station {{still has}} {{extensive}} railway facilities, which were formerly used for freight operations {{and have not}} been <b>dismantled.</b> Three <b>tracks</b> are available for passenger operations at a platform next to the station building and at an island platform.|$|R
50|$|The {{lower section}} between Hainichen and Roßwein, however, remains unused. In 2005, it was {{abandoned}} by Regio Infra Service Sachsen {{and the city}} of Hainichen decided to <b>dismantle</b> the <b>tracks</b> in order to build a cycle path on the route.|$|R
50|$|The <b>dismantled</b> <b>tracks</b> of the narrow-gauge railway towards Pritzwalk and Lindenberg {{were located}} {{north of the}} tracks of the main line. To {{the east of the}} present federal highway on the main line towards Lindenberg was the {{platform}} with a small entrance building, which is now (as of 2012) used as a local club. The facilities for freight and for changing locomotives were west of the highway next to the freight facilities of the main line. There was no track connection to the narrow-gauge tracks or to the line to Havelberg, which was also rebuilt to narrow gauge after the Second World War. Vehicles were transported by standard-gauge transfer wagons between the two parts of the station.|$|R
2500|$|On 31 August 2009 a few {{permanent}} {{changes to}} the line routes were applied. Because of renovations to Ostkreuz station, which includes <b>dismantling</b> <b>tracks</b> connecting the Stadtbahn and the Ringbahn, [...] (formerly ✈ Berlin-Schönefeld ↔ Spandau) cannot turn west at this station any more. The line thus follows the Ringbahn and then branches northwards past Schönhauser Allee, like [...] and , and terminates at Pankow. To compensate for the diminished throughput on the Stadtbahn, the [...] (formerly Erkner ↔ Ostbahnhof) was extended westwards to Spandau. Because of the progress achieved in the Ostkreuz renovation, the S3 now operates only between Ostkreuz and Erkner. As a replacement, the S5 now travels to Spandau and the S75 operates every 10 minutes between Westkreuz and Wartenberg.|$|R
50|$|In the mid 1990s Bensheim’s {{freight yard}} {{was closed and}} a few years later the <b>dismantling</b> of its <b>tracks</b> began.|$|R
50|$|In 1951, {{the line}} was to be <b>dismantled</b> to obtain <b>track</b> {{materials}} for repairs elsewhere, but this did not take place. Passenger traffic continued until 21 May 1966, when it {{was taken over by}} buses, and freight traffic until the decommissioning of the line on 26 September 1969. On 12 June 1970 {{the line was}} ordered to be <b>dismantled,</b> and the <b>tracks</b> as well as the steel superstructures of the bridges were lifted subsequently.|$|R
50|$|Deutsche Bahn {{offered in}} late 2011 {{to sell the}} grounds of the line in order to {{facilitate}} the construction of a bike path. The adjoining communities bought those sections of the line that lay on their territory. The <b>dismantling</b> of <b>tracks</b> and signalling equipment started in early 2012.|$|R

50|$|Some of {{the system}} still exists but is disconnected, {{overgrown}} or has been <b>dismantled</b> with the <b>track</b> bed taken over, rendering it unserviceable.|$|R
50|$|In 1874, {{a branch}} of the Midland Railway was built through {{the eastern part of the}} parish and Tonge and Breedon railway station was built at Tonge. In 1980 British Railways closed the line and later the <b>track</b> was <b>dismantled.</b> The <b>trackbed</b> through the parish is now part of National Cycle Route 6.|$|R
50|$|The {{agreements}} {{were signed}} in December 1987; however, continuing public outcry and legal challenges kept the railway operational for several months. On 20 June 1988, it was officially {{announced that the}} railway would cease operations as of 1 September 1988. Some freight trains still ran until late September, with the last scheduled run on 29 September 1988. The last scheduled passenger train ran on 30 September 1988, from Bishops Falls to Corner Brook. Following official abandonment, the railway operated salvage trains, <b>dismantling</b> <b>track</b> in remote locations; some salvage trains were still operating {{in the summer of}} 1990. Most of the track was removed and scrapped by November 1990. CN no longer has any operations in the Province of Newfoundland. In the fall of 1996 CN contracted out its intermodal trucking operation to Clarke Transport. Clarke Transport is now the local agent for CN.|$|R
5000|$|It {{was here}} that Vikzhel played its {{historic}} role. On August 27, {{in conjunction with the}} celebration of the revolution, the Petrograd Soviet issued an emergency appeal to soldiers, telegraph operators, and railway workers to come to the defense of the revolution, declaring that orders of the military high command were to be ignored and the movement of counterrevolutionary troops stymied. That same day Vikzhel established a special committee dedicated to the military emergency created by Kornilov. Vikzhel sent telegrams up and down the railway network, demanding the stoppage of [...] "suspicious telegrams" [...] and the rapid transmission of information about the size and destination of any troop movements by rail. Railway workers were directed to delay and halt the movement of troops by any means necessary, up to and including sidetracking, abandoning their posts, blocking the right of way, and <b>dismantling</b> <b>track.</b>|$|R
50|$|After the Second World War, {{operations}} {{ended on}} the narrow-gauge railway from Rathenow to Senzke and {{the section of}} the track near the station was <b>dismantled.</b> One <b>track</b> of the Lehrte railway was dismantled for reparations. With the division of Germany, the importance of traffic on the line from Berlin to the West Germany via Magdeburg fell.|$|R
50|$|On 2 June 1984, the {{passenger}} services were finally abandoned between Osnabrück and Dissen-Rothenfelde. Freight traffic continued on this section until 31 May 1991, {{but at the}} beginning of the 1990s Deutsche Bahn (DB) wanted to abandon freight traffic and to <b>dismantle</b> the <b>track</b> northwest of Dissen-Rothenfelde. This was prevented by a citizens' initiative called the Initiative Haller Willem.|$|R
50|$|On both {{of these}} {{conditions}} the court deliberated and made findings crucial to the case. One, they found that when the railroad <b>dismantled</b> the <b>track</b> in 1975, they had effectively abandoned their right of easement, regardless of having not filed an abandonment order. Therefore any easement pertaining {{to the use of}} this rail track became void.|$|R
5000|$|Today {{the line}} has been <b>dismantled,</b> and <b>trackbed</b> {{disrupted}} by the new A 9 motorway. In Bad Berneck the station (...) has been demolished and, on the old station yard the new B 303 road runs. East of Bad Berneck the trackbed is {{being used as a}} cycle path. The station building at the terminus in Bischofsgrün is still standing.|$|R
