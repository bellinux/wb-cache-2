60|$|With {{respect to}} birds {{in a state}} of nature, the first and most obvious {{supposition}} which will occur to everyone is that the female at the proper season accepts the first male whom she may encounter; but she has at least the opportunity for exerting a choice, as she is almost invariably pursued by many males. Audubon—and we must remember that he spent a long life in prowling about the forests of the United States and observing the birds—does not doubt that the female deliberately chooses her mate; thus, speaking of a woodpecker, he says the hen is followed by half-a-dozen gay suitors, who continue performing strange antics, “until a marked preference is shewn for one.” The female of the red-winged starling (Agelæus phœniceus) is likewise pursued by several males, “until, becoming fatigued, she alights, receives their addresses, and soon makes a choice.” He <b>describes</b> <b>also</b> <b>how</b> several male nightjars repeatedly plunge through the air with astonishing rapidity, suddenly turning, and thus making a singular noise; “but no sooner has the female made her choice, than the other males are driven away.” With one of the vultures (Cathartes aura) of the United States, parties of eight or ten or more males and females assemble on fallen logs, “exhibiting the strongest desire to please mutually,” and after many caresses, each male leads off his partner on the wing. Audubon likewise carefully observed the wild flocks of Canada geese (Anser Canadensis), and gives a graphic description of their love-antics; he says that the birds which had been previously mated “renewed their courtship as early as the month of January, while the others would be contending or coquetting for hours every day, until all seemed satisfied with the choice they had made, after which, although they remained together, any person could easily perceive that they were careful to keep in pairs. I have observed also that the older the birds, the shorter were the preliminaries of their courtship. The bachelors and old maids, whether in regret, or not caring to be disturbed by the bustle, quietly moved aside and lay down at some distance from the rest.”[166] Many similar statements with respect to other birds could be cited from this same observer.|$|E

40|$|This article {{proposes a}} {{balancing}} procedure for the deflation of input-output (I-O) tables {{from the viewpoint}} of users. This is a 'subjective' variant of the Weighted Least Squares (WLS) method, already known in the literature. It is argued that it is more flexible than other methods, and it is shown that SWLS subsumes the first-order approximation of RAS as a special case. Flexibility is due to the facts that (a) users can attach differential 'reliability' weights to first (unbalanced) estimates, depending on the confidence they have in the different parts of their pre-balancing work, (b) differently from RAS, one is not bound to take any row or column total as exogenously given, and (c) additional constraints can be added to it. The article <b>describes</b> <b>also</b> <b>how</b> SWLS was utilised to estimate a yearly (1959 - 2000) series of constant-price I-O tables for the Italian economy.

40|$|In the {{situation}} {{when there is}} tendency to move towards education for all people {{a large part of}} who cannot attend educational establishments the necessity of developing intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) becomes urgent. The paper proposes a conception of framework using the set of graphs which implementation in the tutoring (pedagogical) module of agent based ITS allow personalization of teaching and learning process for each individual learner. The personalization starts with defining of sequence of study courses build on individual study plan for the particular learner. This activity is supported by a AND – OR graph representing the structure of study programme. The next step is carried out using the graph that represents a structure of study course showing relationships between topics. The third graph is constructed by mapping each topic to the corresponding concept map which includes all taught concepts and their relationships. The fourth graph represents a concept and its relationships with all needed learning objects to acquire knowledge about the concept. The paper <b>describes</b> <b>also</b> <b>how</b> personalization of learning is supported by sequences of learning objects and usage of concept maps for knowledge self-assessment...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{a number of}} {{organizations}} have experimented control systems for monitoring the environmental parameters of complex buildings, {{with the goal of}} improving well-being and optimizing management costs. These solutions are often characterized by sophisticated and costly technologies that allow to monitor the situation even from remote desks and take proper actions whenever any parameter fails to comply with management constraints. Unfortunately in many cases the availability of these control infrastructures doesn’t allow people inhabiting buildings to gain awareness about the environmental parameters or the consumption issues related to these spaces. Eco-feedback techniques, which can lead to significant savings through the feedback given to users, can’t be properly applied. The control systems often lack functionalities for communicating with users and creating a social awareness related to energy consumption issues. This paper analyzes one of these systems, designed for a modern University campus, with the goal of understanding its points of strength and weaknesses. The paper <b>describes</b> <b>also</b> <b>how</b> the results of this analysis have been used for the design of a pilot eco-feedback system, that features a context- aware mobile app for creating a bi-directional communication between users and backend...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a service based mobile application that assists tourists traveling to a country. The application provides tourists with context-aware information adapted to their personalized requirements. Detecting the real {{needs of the}} tourist is based on context management which {{is a key element}} in our system – Murshid. Advice to tourists is proposed after sensing the context and a fine analysis of its ingredients. Murshid is designed as client-server architecture and it uses GPS based location to provide a visual aid using UAE map. Murshid is flexible, user-friendly, portable, and support dynamic information. The application offers a set of services to tourists through their mobile handsets, namely: special event notification, sightseeing, weather forecasting, currency exchange, language translation, and location bookmarking and sharing. Each of the services recommends tourism guidance according to the user’s context that is constantly changing since we are dealing with nomadic users. The application utilizes different context information to adapt its functionality according to the surrounding environment. This information can be spatial, temporal, or related to the environment. The context model includes the user location, the user profile, the current date, events related information, and user interaction. The paper presents the context model, the system architecture, the services implemented and offered, and an evaluation of the main functionalities of the system. It <b>describes</b> <b>also</b> <b>how</b> the context is managed in order to adapt the system functionality to the changes that may occur in order to react accordingly at the right time, at the right place and for the right person...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} a decentralized LQG measurement scheduling problem {{in which every}} measurement is costly, no communication between observers is permitted, and the observers' estimation errors are coupled quadratically. This setup, motivated by considerations from organization theory, models measurement scheduling problems in which cost, bandwidth, or security constraints necessitate that estimates be decentralized, although their errors are coupled. We show that, unlike the centralized case, in the decentralized case the problem of optimizing the time integral of the measurement cost and the quadratic estimation error is fundamentally stochastic, and we characterize the ε-optimal open-loop schedules as chattering solutions of a deterministic Lagrange optimal control problem. Using a numerical example, we <b>describe</b> <b>also</b> <b>how</b> this deterministic optimal control problem can be solved by nonlinear programming...|$|R

40|$|The essay {{analyses}} {{the changes}} {{of the nature of}} the employer following the great economic and social transformations that have been taking place since the end of the last century, as well as the answers given by the labour law to address them. It is first described the “internal” fragmentation of the enterprise through subcontracting and outsourcing, a process that has given a new importance to the issue of how to identify the employer; it is then examined the “external” fragmentation of the enterprise, due to the enlargement of the market to a transnational dimension, that has increasingly given the employer the power to choose the law which will rule the employment relation. The essay <b>describes</b> <b>also</b> <b>how</b> labour law has tackled the breaking down of employer’s contractual liability and the new immunities granted to employers in the exercise of his or her managerial powers and prerogatives as a consequence. The new legal protection techniques are of a relational kind, i. e. they govern relations where rights and duties of the parties are not entirely defined a priori and they do so by adopting functional criteria of allocation of employer’ liability among different economic entities and by striking the balance between different interests through the application of the general clauses and of the principles of equality and reasonableness. The result is a considerable flexibilitation of the legal rules and a higher level of uncertainty and unpredictability of the law, but at the same time the discovery of new functions of fundamental principle and rights...|$|E
30|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} two {{time of arrival}} estimators for ultra {{wideband}} signals based on the phase difference between the discrete Fourier transforms (DFT) of the transmitted and received signals. The first estimator {{is based on the}} slope of the unwrapped phase and the second one on the absolute unwrapped phase. We derive the statistics of the unwrapped phase. We show that slope-based estimation almost achieves asymptotically the baseband Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB), while the absolute-phase-based estimator achieves asymptotically the passband CRLB. We compare the proposed estimators to the time-domain maximum likelihood estimator (MLE). We show that the MLE achieves the CRLB faster than the DFT-based estimator, while the DFT-based estimator outperforms the MLE for low signal to noise ratios. We <b>describe</b> <b>also</b> <b>how</b> to use the proposed estimators in multipath UWB channels.|$|R
