Common topics include sports recaps, weather, financial reports, real <b>estate</b> <b>analysis,</b> and earnings reviews. StatSheet, an online platform covering college basketball, runs entirely on an automated program. The Associated Press began using automation to cover 10,000 minor baseball leagues games annually, using a program from Automated Insights and statistics from MLB Advanced Media. Outside of sports, the Associated Press also uses automation to produce stories on corporate earnings. In 2006, Thomson Reuters announced their switch to automation to generate financial news stories on its online news platform.

40|$|Risk and {{uncertainty}} are, {{to say the}} least, poorly considered by most individuals involved in real <b>estate</b> <b>analysis</b> - in both development and investment appraisal. Surveyors continue to express 'uncertainty' about the value (risk) of using relatively objective methods of analysis to account for these factors. These methods attempt to identify the risk elements more explicitly. Conventionally this is done by deriving probability distributions for the uncontrolled variables in the system. A suggested 'new' way of "being able to express our uncertainty or slight vagueness {{about some of the}} qualitative judgements and not entirely certain data required {{in the course of the}} problem [...] . " uses the application of fuzzy logic. This paper discusses and demonstrates the terminology and methodology of fuzzy analysis. In particular it attempts a comparison of the procedures with those used in 'conventional' risk analysis approaches and critically investigates whether a fuzzy approach offers an alternative to the use of probability based analysis for dealing with aspects of risk {{and uncertainty}} in real <b>estate</b> <b>analysis...</b>|$|E

40|$|Paper {{received}} in final form, January 2003] Summary. Real estate, encompassing housing, land and commercial property, {{is a key}} driver of the urban economy—in terms of economic development, the distribution of opportunities across space and through {{the evolution of the}} local built environment. Certain aspects of real estate research are not directly related to urban issues but, through finance and investment decisions, for instance, they do have a major bearing on our towns and cities. Thus, a Review Issue on urban real estate is timely and important. This paper both introduces and provides an assessment of the articles within this Review Issue. First, the paper sets the issue in its wider context. Secondly, it then pulls out the main themes from each contribution before elaborating on the cross-cutting themes that emerge from the collected papers taken together. The final main section outlines a forward-looking research agenda for real <b>estate</b> <b>analysis...</b>|$|E
40|$|Investments {{in direct}} real estate are {{inherently}} difficult to segment {{compared to other}} asset classes due to the complex and heterogeneous nature of the asset. The most common segmentation in real <b>estate</b> investment <b>analysis</b> relies on property sector and geographical region. In this paper, we compare the predictive power of existing industry classifications with {{a new type of}} segmentation using cluster analysis on a number of relevant property attributes including the equivalent yield and size of the property as well as information on lease terms, number of tenants and tenant concentration. The new segments are shown to be distinct and relatively stable over time. In a second stage of the analysis, we test whether the newly generated segments are able to better predict the resulting financial performance of the assets than the old dichotomous segments. Applying both discriminant and neural network analysis we find mixed evidence for this hypothesis. Overall, we conclude from our analysis that each of the two approaches to segmenting the market has its strengths and weaknesses so that both might be applied gainfully in real <b>estate</b> investment <b>analysis</b> and fund management. market segmentation, commercial real estate, financial performance measurement, cluster analysis, neural network analysis, risk diversification...|$|R

40|$|The {{physical}} adaptability {{of buildings}} {{is very important}} in today's fast-changing business environment. The actors who invest in long-term adaptability are positioned better to the changes during the life cycle of a building. This conceptual paper argues that the current dominating real <b>estate</b> (property) investment <b>analysis</b> theories do not accommodate enough building design-related information (i. e. physical asset characteristics), which results in long-term loss of competitiveness and unsustainable use of built environment resources. It is demonstrated that physical asset characteristics can create valuable real options that should be acknowledged in real <b>estate</b> investment <b>analysis</b> and management. The real estate investment literature has not so far been able to produce a widely accepted financial model for justifying life-cycle investments. A theory is proposed here {{that can be used to}} value life-cycle investments in buildings. This new theory combines of real options valuation, investment analysis and building component life-cycle design. These themes are used to formulate a conceptual framework for valuing life-cycle investments. The framework is intuitive and transparent, and it can be easily added to current spreadsheet investment analysis tools. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Fuzzy {{logic is}} a system for decisiopn making that is {{relatively}} new, particularly in terms of applications in the social sciences. While it has been studied and applied for some 20 years in the physical sciences, its applicability to the social sciences - and real <b>estate</b> <b>analysis,</b> in particular - has been recognized only recently. The goal of fuzzy logic is to enable analysts to quantify the imprecision inherent in estimates and evaluations. Derived from the classical set theory of mathematics, in which an observation either belongs or {{does not belong to}} a set, fuzzy logic employs fuzzy sets that allow membership in a set to vary from 0 to 1. This article describes the general nature of fuzzy logic and presents an example to illustrate a simple application to real estate. Finally, a conceptual framework for a more complex fuzzy system is developed...|$|E
40|$|Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) {{has become}} the {{backbone}} of finance as it gives {{better understanding of the}} best possible investment portfolio for financial assets. Since the idea was introduced by Harry Markowitz about five decades ago, the applicability of MPT to real <b>estate</b> <b>analysis</b> have been widely discussed by many real estate researchers with some pro and con outcomes. As MPT was developed through some “unrealistic ” assumptions, the results from previous studies could not give a decisive generalisation of real estate investment decisions. This paper presents the issues of the applicability and implication of employing MPT on real estate portfolio analysis. The discussion is merely looking into some previous empirical studies with mixture of findings. The new paradigm of real estate investment has been shifted from ‘tactical and operational ’ to ‘strategic and tactical ’ style of management. Therefore, MPT could give a sound analytical view of real estate portfolio analysis which may offer more opportunities for further research particularly in Malaysia...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{expected}} that the option valuation theory will play a much more {{significant role in the}} real <b>estate</b> <b>analysis.</b> However, potentially because of the need for understanding the advanced financial theories, the real options analysis has not been fully used in the real world. In order to attack this problem, it is highly desired to create a more practical and easily understandable calculation model for valuing flexibility. With the increasing computational power of today, an interesting approach to valuing flexibility arises from the field of engineering systems. This approach does not require the understanding of advanced financial theories, and aims to assess the value of flexibility built into the project design. Although the perspective of this approach may be slightly different from that of traditional real options valuation approach, this approach might be an alternative method as a simpler model for valuing flexibility. The comparative study of the economics-based approach and the engineering-base...|$|E

40|$|ISBN 1 - 903834 - 06 - 6 Do yields reflect {{property}} market fundamentals? Property yields {{are a significant}} input in property valuations, property development decisions and other functions in real <b>estate</b> <b>analysis</b> and consultancy. Trends in property yields are also a means to study investment behaviour and attitudes within the {{property market}}. The construction of models that track the historical variation in property yields improves {{our understanding of the}} determinants of yields and provides the basis for their forecasting. The usefulness of such research is of significance to real estate analysts and professionals. Current work in Europe has paid little attention to the empirical investigation of yield movements. A UK study by Tsolacos, Keogh and McGough (1998) modelled yields but the authors identified significant econometric difficulties compared with the modelling of rents and new construction. In other European countries the subject has not been researched but the major property consultancy companies do attempt yield analysis and modelling. The US literature has examined this issue in more detail. A number of studies have provided significant insight on the determination of yields and the relative importance of property and capital market factors (Sivitanidou and Sivitanides, 1999; Jud and Winkler, 1995) ...|$|E
40|$|Understanding Complex Urban Systems {{takes as}} its point of {{departure}} the insight that the challenges of global urbanization and the complexity of urban systems cannot be understood – let alone ‘managed’ – by sectoral and disciplinary approaches alone. But while there has recently been significant progress in broadening and refining the methodologies for the quantitative modeling of complex urban systems, in deepening the theoretical understanding of cities as complex systems, or in illuminating the implications for urban planning, {{there is still a}} lack of well-founded conceptual thinking on the methodological foundations and the strategies of modeling urban complexity across the disciplines.

40|$|It is {{perceived}} that Moore’s Law will prevail {{at least for}} the next decade, with continuous advancements of processing technologies for very-large-scale integrated (VLSI) circuits. Nano technology is driving VLSI circuits in a path of greater transistor integration, faster clock frequency, and lower operation voltage. This has imposed a new challenge for delivering highquality power to modern processors. Power management technology is critical for transferring the required high current in a highly efficient way, and accurately regulating the sub- 1 V voltage in very fast dynamic transient response conditions. Furthermore, the VRs are limited in a given area and the power density is important to save the precious real estate of the motherboard. Based on the power delivery path model, the analysis results show {{that as long as the}} bandwidth can reach around 350 kHz, the bulk capacitor of the VR can be completely eliminated, which means significant savings in cost and real <b>estate.</b> <b>Analysis</b> also indicates that 650 kHz bandwidth can reduce the number of the decoupling capacitor from 230 to 50 for future microprocessor case. Beyond 650 kHz, the reduction is not obvious any more due to the parasitic components along the power delivery path. Following the vision of high bandwidth, the VRs need to operate at much higher frequenc...|$|E
