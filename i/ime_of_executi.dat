40|$|In {{the budding}} yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, entry into meiosis and its {{successful}} completion depend on two positive regulators, Ime 1 and Ime 2.

We show that in vivo Ime 2 associates with Ime 1, that in vitro Ime 2 phosphorylates Ime 1, and that in living cells the stability <b>of</b> <b>Ime</b> 1 depends on Ime 2.

40|$|The IME 2 gene {{is one of}} the key {{regulators}} of {{the initiation}} of meiosis in budding yeast. This gene is repressed during mitosis through the repressive chromatin structure at the promoter, which is maintained by the Rpd 3 -Sin 3 histone deacetylase (HDAC) complex. IME 2 expression in meiosis requires Gcn 5 /histone acetyltransferase, the transcriptional activator Ime 1, and the chromatin remodeler RSC; however, the molecular basis <b>of</b> <b>IME</b> 2 activation had not been previously defined. We found that, during mitotic growth, a nucleosome masked the TATA element <b>of</b> <b>IME</b> 2, and this positioning depended on HDAC. This chromatin structure was remodeled at meiosis by RSC that was recruited to TATA by Ime 1. Stable tethering <b>of</b> <b>Ime</b> 1 to the promoter required the presence of Gcn 5. Interestingly, Ime 1 binding to the promoter was kept at low levels during the very early stages in meiosis, even when the levels <b>of</b> <b>Ime</b> 1 and histone H 3 acetylation at the promoter were at their highest, making a 4 - to 6 -h delay <b>of</b> the <b>IME</b> 2 expression from that <b>of</b> <b>IME</b> 1.

40|$|The {{transcriptional}} activator Ime 1 {{is a key}} regulator of meiosis and sporulation in budding yeast. Ime 1 {{is controlled}} at different levels by nutrients and cell-type signals. Previously, we have proposed that G 1 cyclins would transmit nutritional signals to the Ime 1 pathway by preventing the accumulation <b>of</b> <b>Ime</b> 1 within the nucleus. We show here that nutritional signals regulate the subcellular localization <b>of</b> <b>Ime</b> 1 through the TOR pathway. The inactivation of TOR with rapamycin promotes the nuclear accumulation and stabilization <b>of</b> <b>Ime</b> 1, with consequent induction of early meiotic genes. On the contrary, the activation of TOR by glutamine induces the relocalization <b>of</b> <b>Ime</b> 1 to the cytoplasm. Thus, TOR may sense optimal nitrogen- and carbon-limiting conditions to modulate Ime 1 function. Besides TOR, ammonia induces an independent mechanism that prevents the accumulation <b>of</b> <b>Ime</b> 1 in the nucleus. Both TOR and ammonia regulate Ime 1 localization {{in the absence of}} Cdk 1 activity and therefore use mechanisms different from those exerted by G 1 cyclins. Integration of independent mechanisms into a single early controlling step, such as the nuclear accumulation <b>of</b> <b>Ime</b> 1, may help explain why yeast cells execute the meiotic program only when the appropriate internal and external conditions are met together...|$|R

40|$|In {{the yeast}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae, meiosis and spore {{formation}} require the induction of sporulation-specific genes.

Upon nitrogen depletion a transient induction in the transcription <b>of</b> <b>IME</b> 1 is observed in MATa/MAT� diploids but not in MAT-insufficient strains. In this study we demonstrate that the transcription <b>of</b> <b>IME</b> 1 is controlled by an extremely unusual large 5 � region, over 2, 100 bp long.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{draws on}} the results of an ongoing {{research}} project centered on French secondary education (collèges, high schools) in three school districts (the académies of Paris, Nancy-Metz, and Lille). Our objective is to study current changes in the field of Information and Media Education (IME) in today’s digital world as related to ongoing curricular redesigns. Specifically, our aim is to identify the scope and the contents <b>of</b> <b>IME</b> in order to understand whether or not, in a changing and uncertain context, secondary schools seek to implement a coherent approach to IME, providing pupils with an info-documentary perspective and an interpretative framework for understanding the world. In our study special attention is paid {{to the role of the}} different actors involved in this education. In this paper we focus on school leaders and their assistants. Recent studies have concurred that one of the “critical ingredients” of strategic innovation in schools (Kouzes & Posner, 2007) and among library and information professionals (Rowley & Roberts, 2009) is effective leadership and good management. This issue of leadership seems, by comparison, still a peripheral subject in studies related to information and media education. In speaking about universities, Virkus (Virkus, 2015) points out that the focus is more on “how to secure management support within universities rather than how to demonstrate influential leadership in libraries”. However, recent studies highlight the key role played by leaders at various levels in the university and the significance of this role with regard to developing information literacy and building efficient teams. What can we say about IME in the French context? How do school leaders deal with this education? What is their vision <b>of</b> <b>IME</b> and how do they participate in its implementation?In terms of methodology and data gathering, we administered - via academic mailing lists in the three districts under study - a questionnaire composed of 17 closed and open-ended questions.

Results and Discussion From the amount of charge passed {{and the amount of}} borate found in the electrolyte the current effi-ciency was calculated. It was assumed that boron was oxidized to the plus three state. The method of analysis was unaffected by the occasional f laking of boron into the electrolyte. The results are given in Table I. The current efficiencies in each run were fair ly close to 100 %. With a given electrode the cur-rent increased sl ightly with t <b>ime</b> <b>of</b> anodization. It is suggested that this is due to an increase in the effective surface area with flaking. Photomicro-graphs of the surface before and after anodizat ion seem to confirm this. The anodic behavior of a boron in alkal ine solu-t ion differs marked ly from that of a luminum, tan-ta lum, and other valve metals when anodized under similar conditions. In the latter the ionic current efficiency at constant voltage decreases rapid ly with t <b>ime</b> <b>of</b> anodizat ion (5). This is at t r ibuted to the growth of a nonporous insoluble oxide film. If boron forms a duplex type of oxide s imi lar to that formed on a luminum when anodized in acidic solution then the theory proposed by Mott and Hoar (6) may be applicable. The duplex film consists of a th in compact oxide fol lowed by a porous open structure which is in contact with the electrolyte. Dur ing anodizat ion the thickness of the compact film remains constant whi le the pores get deeper. The porous film may dissolve readi ly in the case of boric oxide, and this could lead to a 100 % cur-rent efficiency as determined by the borate found in solution. The compact film may protect the un-polarized electrode from oxidat ion and still permit a field enhanced migrat ion of boron or oxide ions.

Here, the inclusion and design in <b>IMEs</b> <b>of</b> the cultural differences that need to be considered while designing and developing such environments (i. e. at stage 3 as well as 4) are focused on. Some examples of thought out and customized computerised cultural differences from an IME as well as some concrete examples from the Turkish context are given...|$|R

Voyager 2 data from 50 AU and 16 S heliolatitude show a gradual 100 km/s ncrease in solar wind velocity which reaches a plateau of 580 km/s for 75 days in late 1996. t We suggest that this plateau, from which solar rotation signatures are absent, represents the <b>ime</b> <b>of</b> solar minimum. We find that the current solar minimum closely resembles that of the e 1 1976 solar minimum; both are characterized by relatively thick streamer belts. During th 986 - 87 solar minimum the streamer belt was only half as thick (~ 8) as in 1976 and 1996. n This suggests a possible 22 year cycle in solar wind characteristics and we predict that at the ext solar minimum in about 2007 the streamer belt will again be very thin. Introduction The solar wind varies with heliomagnetic latitude; at low magnetic latitudes it is slow, cold, t a [...] ...|$|R
