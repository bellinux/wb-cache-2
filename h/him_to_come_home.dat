500|$|Although his {{appearance}} {{as a domestic}} pet is mostly a cover, Perry has nonetheless expressed care and devotion for the Flynn-Fletcher family.

He did this {{even though he knew}} that Candace saw that Perry was a secret agent talking to Agent E (Eagle) and to Major Monogram in a cracked egg.
