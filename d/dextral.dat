5|$|After {{aftershocks}} {{from the}} quake had concluded, examination took place, producing a focal {{solution to the}} small events. Movement of these shocks {{was similar to that}} of previous earthquakes around the Azores. For these earthquakes, scientists had determined that the conjugate nodal plane was responsible, seeing shearing on the right-lateral (<b>dextral)</b> side. All faulting in this area is strike-slip-oriented, and on a rather large scale. Because of this research, information now points towards Azores volcanism being controlled by earthquake movement.|$|E
5|$|The genus Amphidromus {{is unusual}} in that it {{includes}} species that have <b>dextral</b> shell-coiling and species that have sinistral shell-coiling. In addition, some species within this genus are particularly notable because their populations simultaneously include individuals with left-handed and right-handed shell-coiling. This is an extremely rare phenomenon, and very interesting to biologists. Studies focused on the soft anatomy of Amphidromus are scattered and fragmentary. Information on the internal anatomy is known only from a few species, and no larger, comparative morphological study has ever been carried out.|$|E
5|$|Pleuronectiformes (flatfish) are {{an order}} of ray-finned fish. The most obvious {{characteristic}} of the modern flatfish is their asymmetry, with both eyes {{on the same side}} of the head in the adult fish. In some families the eyes are always on the right side of the body (<b>dextral</b> or right-eyed flatfish) and in others they are always on the left (sinistral or left-eyed flatfish). The primitive spiny turbots include equal numbers of right- and left-eyed individuals, and are generally less asymmetrical than the other families. Other distinguishing features of the order are the presence of protrusible eyes, another adaptation to living on the seabed (benthos), and the extension of the dorsal fin onto the head.|$|E
40|$|Tree snails of the {{subgenus}} Amphidromus s. str. are unusual {{because of}} the chiral dimorphism that exists in many species, with clockwise (dextrally) and counter-clockwise (sinistrally) coiled individuals co-occurring in the same population. Given that mating in snails is normally impeded when the two partners have opposite coil, positive frequencydependent selection should prevent such dimorphism from persisting. We test the hypothesis that a strong population structure with little movement between tree-based demes may result in the fixation of coiling morphs at a very small spatial scale, but apparent dimorphism at all larger scales. To do so, we describe the spatial structure in a Malaysian population of A. inversus (Mu ller, 1774) with 36 % <b>dextrals.</b> We marked almost 700 juvenile and adult snails {{in a piece of}} forest consisting of 92 separate trees, and recorded dispersal and the proportions of <b>dextrals</b> and sinistrals in all trees over a 7 -day period. We observed frequent movement between trees (155 events), and found that no trees had snail populations with proportions of <b>dextrals</b> and sinistrals that were significantly different from random. Upon recapture 1 year later, almost two-thirds of the snails had moved away from their original tree. We conclude that population structure alone cannot stabilise the coil dimorphism in Amphidromus...|$|R
40|$|Research {{carried out}} in the last two decennia has shown that right brain damage could disturb the {{production}} and reception of suprasegmentals. <b>Dextrals</b> with right hemispheric lesions may find it difficult to intone speech and/or to discriminate between various intonations or accentuations. However, right brain damage does not invariably entail some kind of dysprosody. Detailed investigation of a righthanded male with right temporo-parietal excision failed to uncover any prosodic deficit. Moreover, critical review of the positive cases reported so far indicates that dysprosody, when it occurs following injury to the right hemisphere, results from a neuro-motor deficit or from disturbed auditory discrimination. As a consequence, it cannot be considered a specific language disturbance. Moreover, dysprosody may also result from damage to the left hemisphere in <b>dextrals.</b> Accordingly, there is little evidence to support a recent claim that the right hemisphere is dominant for affective prosody {{in much the same way}} as the left hemisphere is dominant for propositional speech. © 1985 The International Christian University Language Sciences Summer Institute.

40|$|This {{study focused}} on the {{developmental}} patterns of hand and foot dominance, and associated phenotypic asymmetries, such as mixed dominance and the correspondence between handedness and footedness among young children. Research indicates that for certain lateral traits, left-handers differ from right-handers: they are more mixed in their handedness and express an elevated rate of contralateral foot dominance for ball kicking. We sought to ascertain at which age level the direction and degree of handedness begins to stabilize; and whether footedness develops concurrently with handedness, and among left-handers, at which age do mixed and consistent phenotypes appear. There were 120 children (60 <b>dextrals</b> and 60 sinistrals) {{between the ages of}} three and eight, all assessed on 10 handedness and four footedness tasks. Results indicated that among both <b>dextrals</b> and sinistrals, the direction and degree of handedness was basically established by the age of three; in both groups handedness and footedness developed simultaneously at the same age, if not before. Among left-handers, groups of mixed and consistent phenotypes emerged at age three, and their differential frequency remained uniform at ages five and seven. It was concluded that the pattern of neuromotor dominance for primary manual tasks and for ball kicking was relatively invariante, probably lateralized prior to three-years of age.   Keywords: handedness; footedness; lateral development; young children...|$|R
5|$|The Mendocino Fault is seismically active with mostly {{small and}} {{moderate}} earthquakes, but the largest event that was unequivocally {{associated with the}} fault was the M6.9 earthquake on September 1, 1994, at 125.8 W longitude.

40|$|The mental {{representation}} of numbers along a line oriented {{left to right}} affects spatial cognition, facilitating responses in the ipsilateral hemispace (the spatial-numerical association of response codes [SNARC] effect). We investigated whether the number/space association {{is the result of}} an attentional shift or response selection. Previous research has often introduced covert left/right response cues by presenting targets to the left or the right. The present study avoided left/right cues by requiring forced choice upper/lower luminance discriminations to two mirror-reversed luminance gradients (the grayscale task). The grayscale stimuli were overlaid with strings of (1) low numbers, (2) high numbers, and (3) nonnumerical characters. In Experiment 1, 20 <b>dextrals</b> judged the number's magnitude and then indicated whether the upper/lower grayscale was darker. Results showed leftward and rightward attentional biases for low and high numbers, respectively. Demands to process numbers along a left/right line were made less explicit in Experiment 2 (N = 18 <b>dextrals),</b> using (1) a parity judgment and (2) arbitrary linguistic labels for top/bottom. Once again, a spatial congruency effect was observed. Because the response (up/down) was orthogonal to the dimension of interest (left/right), the effect of number cannot be attributed to late-stage response congruencies. This study required unspeeded responses to stimuli presented in free vision, whereas other experiments have used speeded responses. Understanding the time course of number-space effects may, therefore, be important to the debate associated with response selection. Journal Articleinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|The primary aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} factors affecting the assessment of the intensity of pain using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), such as hand preference, hand used, reading order and length of flankers. A second aim was to consider the assessment of the quality of recalled pain events of selfand others, taking into account memory and empathy for pain. A literature review revealed that intensity of pain is frequently measured in clinical and laboratory settings using a VAS. However, research into visual line bisection has found a tendency for healthy individuals to misbisect lines to the left of centre and this is termed pseudoneglect (Bowers and Heilman, 1980). A series of experiments on VAS bisection, trisection and quadrisection found that the mean signed errors for sinistrals and <b>dextrals</b> tended to be leftward and these errors were significantly more leftward when the left hand was used compared to the right. Marking of positions at the left end of the VAS found that mean signed errors were leftward and these were significant for <b>dextrals</b> with either hand, and sinistrals with the left hand. Mean signed errors for the right end of the VAS were only significant for <b>dextrals</b> with the right hand. When the longer flanker was at the left side ofthe VAS there were greater leftward deviations, which were significant with the right hand. There were greater leftward deviations when reading from the left when the longer flanker was to the right of the VAS. The implications for indicating mild, moderate and severe pain were discussed. Actively considering a pain experienced by self or another did not affect the direction of deviations however this significantly increased the absolute errors. Therefore considering pain could affect the ability ofa person to complete the VAS accurately. Cuing made a significant difference to recall a pain, as almost double the pain events were recalled when a cue was provided than when uncued. Recall ofintensity and quality of pain, indicated that the sensory aspect of pain was imagined fairly accurately, for common pains such as backache and arthritis. However the affective aspect was less likely to be imagined accurately. Intensity of another person's pain was over-estimated, and this was the case for health professionals, as well as for non-health professionals. The implications for the VAS were discussed as were cuing of pain events in light of current theories ofepisodic and autobiographical memory.

40|$|Strong {{leftward}} perceptual biases {{have been}} reported for {{the selection of the}} darker of two left/right mirror-reversed luminance gradients under free-viewing conditions. This study investigated the effect of unilateral hemispheric activation on this leftward bias in two groups of <b>dextrals</b> (N = 52 and N = 24). In Experiment 1, activation was manipulated by asking participants to tap with their left or right fingers along their midline. In Experiment 2, participants clenched their left or right hands in their respective hemispaces. Participants selected the stimulus that was darker on the left-hand side 73 % of the time. Despite manipulations of activation strength and hemispace, activation had no effect on the asymmetry. If activation was important, the leftward bias should have been enhanced when the left hand/right hemisphere was active and reduced (or reversed) when the right hand/left hemisphere was active. The contribution of left-to-right scanning biases to free-viewing perceptual asymmetries is discussed as an alternative. (C) 2001 Academic press...|$|R
40|$|Background —General {{conclusions}} concerning {{mechanisms of}} cerebral lateralization may {{be learned from}} the investiga- tion of functional brain organization in patients with anomalous lateralization. Case Description —The functional organization of language, attention, and motor performance was investigated in a 42 -year-old patient with crossed nonaphasia by means of functional MRI. The strongly right-handed man experienced a left middle cerebral artery infarction documented by MRI without exhibition of aphasia. However, the left hemispheric stroke was accompanied by visuospatial impairment, right-sided slight sensory and motor paresis, and right homonymous hemianopia. No history of familial sinistrality or prior neurological illness was present. Functional MR language mapping revealed strong right hemispheric activation in inferior frontal and superior temporal cortices. Finger tapping with the right hand recruited ipsilateral premotor and motor areas as well as supplementary motor cortex. A Stroop task, usually strongly associated with left-sided inferior frontal activation in <b>dextrals,</b> resulted in strong right hemispheric frontal activation. Conclusions —From our data there is clear evidence that different modalities, such as language perception and production, attention, and motor performance, are processed exclusively by 1 hemisphere when atypical cerebral dominance is present...|$|R
40|$|When {{judging the}} {{relative}} {{magnitude of the}} left and right sides of a stimulus, normal participants overestimate the leftward features (pseudoneglect). Although pseudoneglect and clinical neglect operate in opposite directions, the two phenomena may have a common cognitive and neural basis. For neglect, two strategies may be employed when inspecting horizontally aligned stimuli: (1) A global strategy where the stimuli are treated as a gestalt and asymmetries are detected or, (2) a comparison strategy where the qualities on {{the left and right}} sides of the stimuli are explicitly compared. To investigate the effect of these strategies on pseudoneglect, normal <b>dextrals</b> (n = 25 and 17) made two-alternative, forced-choice luminance discriminations between two mirror-reversed luminance gradients (greyscales). In an unseparated form, the stimuli are amenable to a global strategy. A comparison strategy was imposed by separating the stimuli into halves (Experiment 1) or quarters (Experiment 2). Despite the fact that the stimuli were equiluminant, participants predominantly chose the stimulus that was dark on the left as being darker overall in the unseparated condition. Response times were also faster for leftward responses. When the stimuli were separated into halves or quarters, the leftward bias was reduced, but not eliminated. The results demonstrate that both strategies contribute to pseudoneglect-though the global strategy may produce stronger pseudoneglect...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate cerebral asymmetries for the detection of brief temporal events in a group of 22 <b>dextrals</b> using psychophysical measures. Background: By combining electrophysiologic and psychophysical measures, it should be possible to demonstrate that the right ear advantage reported in previous studies is the result of a left hemisphere temporal processing advantage rather than a rightward attentional bias. Method: Bursts of white noise lasting 300 milliseconds were delivered unilaterally to the participants' ears. Half of the stimuli contained a gap lasting either 4 or 6 milliseconds. Participants indicated whether or not the noise burst contained a gap. Asymmetries in alpha and beta activity at left and right temporal lobe sites were measured during the task. Results: The psychophysical data confirmed previous reports of faster response times (RTs) and lower levels of error for the right ear (RE). There was no asymmetry in alpha activity between the left and right temporal lobes; however, there was a higher level of beta activity in the left temporal lobe. Conclusions: The electrophysiological data suggest that the perceptual asymmetry is not the result of a nonspecific rightward attentional bias but that of a left hemisphere specialization for the detection of brief temporal events. The relation between atypical temporal processing asymmetries and developmental learning disorders is discussed...|$|R

40|$|Acquiring {{information}} about our environment through touch is vital in everyday life. Yet very little literature exists about {{factors that may}} influence haptic or tactile processing. Recent neuroimaging studies have reported haptic laterality effects that parallel those reported in the visual literature. With {{the use of a}} haptic variant of the classical line bisection task, the present study aimed to determine the presence of laterality effects on a behavioural level. Specifically, three handedness groups including strong <b>dextrals,</b> strong sinistrals, and—the to-date largely neglected group of—mixed-handers were examined in their ability to accurately bisect stimuli constructed from corrugated board strips of various lengths. Stimulus factors known {{to play a role in}} visuospatial perception including stimulus location, the hand used for bisection, and direction of exploration were systematically varied through pseudo-randomisation. Similar to the visual domain, stimulus location and length as well as participants' handedness and the hand used for bisection exerted a significant influence on participants' estimate of the centre of haptically explored stimuli. However, these effects differed qualitatively from those described for the visual domain, and the factor direction of exploration did not exert any significant effect. This indicates that laterality effects reported on a neural level are sufficiently pronounced to result in measurable behavioural effects. The results, first, add to laterality effects reported for the visual and auditory domain, second, are in line with supramodal spatial processing and third, provide additional evidence to a conceptualisation of pseudoneglect and neglect as signs of hemispheric attentional asymmetries...|$|R

Continuous performance tests (CPTs) using visual stimuli {{are commonly used}} to assess subjects suffering from {{attention deficit hyperactivity disorder}} (ADHD). However, auditory CPTs are considered more useful than visual ones to evaluate classroom attentional problems. A previous study reported that there was a significant effect of handedness on students’ performance on a visual CPT. Here, we examined whether handedness would also affect CPT performance using only auditory stimuli. From an initial sample of 337 students, 11 matched pairs were selected. Repeated ANOVAs showed a significant effect of handedness on attentional performance that was exhibited even in the control group. Left-handers made more commission errors than right-handers. The results were interpreted considering that the association between ADHD and handedness reflects that consistent left-handers are less lateralized and have decreased interhemispheric connections. Auditory attentional data suggest that left-handers have problems in the impulsive/hyperactivity domain. In ADHD, clinical therapeutics and rehabilitation must take handedness into account because consistent sinistrals are more impulsive than <b>dextrals.</b> Keywords: attention, ADHD, consistent left-handers, auditory attention, continuous performance tes...|$|R

40|$|An {{exhaustive}} qualitative (vote-counting) {{review is}} conducted {{of the literature}} concerning visual and non-visual line bisection in neurologically normal subject populations. Although most of these studies report a leftward bisection error (i. e., pseudoneglect), considerable between-study variability and inconsistency characterize this literature. A meta-analysis of this same literature is performed in which the total quantitative data set, comprising 73 studies (or sub-studies) and 2191 subjects, is analyzed with respect to 26 performance factors. The meta-analytic results indicate a significant leftward bisection error in neurologically normal subjects, with an overall eect size of between ÿ 0. 37 and ÿ 0. 44 (depending on integration method), which is significantly modulated to varying degrees {{by a number of}} additional task or subject variables. For example, visual bisection tasks, midsagittal-pointing tasks and tactile bisection tasks all lead to leftward errors, while kinesthetic tasks result in rightward errors. Tachistoscopic forced-choice testing methods reveal much greater estimates of bisection error (eect size=ÿ 1. 32) than do manual method-of-adjustment procedures (eect size=ÿ 0. 40). Subject age significantly modulates line bisection performance such that older subjects err significantly rightward compared to younger subjects, and to veridical line midpoint. Male subjects make slightly larger leftward errors than do female subjects. Handedness has a small eect on bisection errors, with <b>dextrals</b> erring slightly further to the left than sinistral subjects.

We recorded EP and measured the time of a sensorimotor reaction in the following experimental paradigm. Its program provided automated presentation of a pair of acoustic signals, preliminary and imperative; the subject had to perform a motor reaction, pushing a button with the right thumb, with a minimum delay after the second stimulus. Visual feedback signals informed the subject about the successful or inadequate performance of the reaction (time of reaction was shorter than or exceeded a limit value).

In this study, a reliable and well-validated single staircase procedure was used to establish bilateral and unilateral detection thresholds for the cranial nerve I stimulant phenyl ethyl alcohol in 130 right- and 33 left-handed subjects. No differences in sensitivity between the left and right sides of the nose were observed in either group. Bilateral thresholds were lower, on average, than unilateral thresholds when the latter were categorized in terms of left and right nares. However, the bilateral thresholds did not differ significantly from those of the side of the nose with the lower threshold. Overall smell ability, as measured by the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test, did not interact with any of the test measures. These data imply that (i) the left and right sides of the nose do not systematically differ in detection threshold sensitivity for either <b>dextrals</b> or sinistrals and (ii) if central integration of leftright olfactory threshold sensitivity occurs, its effects do not exceed the function of the better side of the nose. Among the senses, the sense of smell is unique in that its inversely related to general olfactory ability).
