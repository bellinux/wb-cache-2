5|$|The Serre {{spectral}} sequence {{was used}} by Serre to prove some of the results mentioned previously. He used the fact that taking the loop space of a well behaved space shifts all the <b>homotopy</b> groups down by 1, so the nth <b>homotopy</b> group of a space X is the first <b>homotopy</b> group of its (n−1)-fold repeated loop space, which {{is equal to the}} first homology group of the (n−1)-fold loop space by the Hurewicz theorem. This reduces the calculation of <b>homotopy</b> groups of X to the calculation of homology groups of its repeated loop spaces. The Serre spectral sequence relates the homology of a space to that of its loop space, so can sometimes be used to calculate the homology of loop spaces. The Serre spectral sequence tends to have many non-zero differentials, which are hard to control, and too many ambiguities appear for higher <b>homotopy</b> groups. Consequently, it has been superseded by more powerful spectral sequences with fewer non-zero differentials, which give more information.|$|E
5|$|The {{first two}} rows of this table are straightforward. The <b>homotopy</b> groups πi(S0) of the 0-dimensional sphere are trivial for i > 0, because any base point {{preserving}} map from an i-sphere to a 0-sphere is a one-point mapping. Similarly, the <b>homotopy</b> groups πi(S1) of the 1-sphere are trivial for i > 1, because the universal covering space, R, which has the same higher <b>homotopy</b> groups, is contractible.|$|E

5|$|A {{continuous}} map between two topological spaces induces a group homomorphism between the associated <b>homotopy</b> groups. In particular, if the map is a continuous bijection (a homeomorphism), {{so that the}} two spaces have the same topology, then their i-th <b>homotopy</b> groups are isomorphic for all i. However, the real plane has exactly the same <b>homotopy</b> groups as a solitary point (as does a Euclidean space of any dimension), and the real plane with a point removed has the same groups as a circle, so groups alone are not enough to distinguish spaces. Although the loss of discrimination power is unfortunate, it can also make certain computations easier.|$|E

5|$|More generally, the i-th <b>homotopy</b> group, πi(X) {{begins with}} the pointed i-sphere (S'i,s), and {{otherwise}} follows the same procedure. The null homotopic class acts as {{the identity of the}} group addition, and for X equal to S'n (for positive n) — the <b>homotopy</b> groups of spheres — the groups are abelian and finitely generated.

5|$|The case i = n {{has also}} been noted already, and is an easy {{consequence}} of the Hurewicz theorem: this theorem links <b>homotopy</b> groups with homology groups, which are generally easier to calculate; in particular, it shows that for a simply-connected space X, the first nonzero <b>homotopy</b> group πk(X), with k > 0, is isomorphic to the first nonzero homology group H'k(X). For the n-sphere, this immediately implies that for n ge& 2, πn(S'n) = H'n(S'n) = Z.|$|E

40|$|Higher <b>homotopies</b> are {{nowadays}} {{playing a}} prominent role in mathematics as well as in certain branches of theoretical physics. The purpose of the talk is to recall some of the connections between {{the past and the present}} developments. Higher <b>homotopies</b> were iso-lated within algebraic topology at least as far back as the 1940 ’s. Prompted by the failure of the Alexander-Whitney multiplication of cocycles to be commutative, Steenrod devel-oped certain operations which measure this failure in a coherent manner. Dold and Lashof extended Milnor’s classifying space construction to associative H-spaces, and a careful ex-amination of this extension led Stasheff to the discovery of An-spaces and A∞-spaces as a notion which controls the failure of associativity in a coherent way so that the classifying space construction can still be pushed through. Algebraic versions of higher <b>homotopies</b> have, as we all know, led Kontsevich eventually to the proof of the formality conjecture. Homological perturbation theory (HPT), in a simple form first isolated by Eilenberg and Mac Lane in the early 1950 ’s, has nowadays become a standard tool to handle algebraic incarnations of higher <b>homotopies.</b> A basi...|$|R

5|$|All the {{interesting}} cases of <b>homotopy</b> groups of spheres involve mappings from a higher-dimensional sphere {{onto one of}} lower dimension. Unfortunately, the only example which can easily be visualized is not interesting: there are no nontrivial mappings from the ordinary sphere to the circle. Hence, π2(S1) = 0. This is because S1 has the real line as its universal cover which is contractible (it has the <b>homotopy</b> type of a point). In addition, because S2 is simply connected, by the lifting criterion, any map from S2 to S1 can be lifted to a map into the real line and the nullhomotopy descends to the downstairs space.|$|E
