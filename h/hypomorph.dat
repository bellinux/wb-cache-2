Mice harboring deficiencies in Fgf 8 or Fgf receptor 1 (Fgfr 1) suffer a significant loss of GnRH neurons, but their reproductive phenotypes have not been examined. This study examined if female mice hypomorphic for Fgf 8, Fgfr 1, or both (compound <b>hypomorphs)</b> exhibited altered parameters of pubertal onset, estrous cyclicity, and fertility. Further, we examined the number of kisspeptin (KP) -immunoreactive (ir) neurons in the anteroventral periventricular/periventricular nuclei (AVPV/PeV) of these mice to assess if changes in the KP system, which stimulates the GnRH system, could contribute to the reproductive phenotypes. Single <b>hypomorphs</b> (Fgfr 1 +/ or Fgf 8 +/) had normal timing for vaginal opening (VO) but delayed first estrus. However, after achieving the first estrus, they underwent normal expression of estrous cycles. In contrast, the compound <b>hypomorphs</b> underwent early VO and normal first estrus, but had disorganized estrous cycles that subsequent-ly reduced their fertility. KP immunohistochemistry on Postnatal Day 15, 30, and 60 transgenic female mice revealed that female compound <b>hypomorphs</b> had significantly more KP-ir neurons in the AVPV/PeV compared to their wild-type littermates, suggest-ing increased KP-ir neurons may drive early VO but could not maintain the cyclic changes in GnRH neuronal activity required for female fertility. Overall, these data suggest that Fgf signaling deficiencies differentially alter the parameters of female pubertal onset and cyclicity. Further, these deficiencies led to changes in the AVPV/PeV KP-ir neurons that may have contributed to the accelerated VO in the compound hypo-morphs. female infertility, gonadal function, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH/GnRH receptor), kisspepti...|$|R
40|$|Agouti is a paracrine-acting, {{transient}} antagonist of melanocortin 1 receptors that specifies the subapical band {{of yellow}} on otherwise black hairs of the wild-type coat. To better understand both agouti structure/function and the germline {{damage caused by}} chemicals and radiation, an allelic series of 25 recessive, homozygous-viable agouti mutations generated in specific-locus tests were characterized. Visual inspection of fur, augmented by quantifiable chemical analysis of hair melanins, suggested four phenotypic categories (mild, moderate, umbrous-like, severe) for the 18 <b>hypomorphs</b> and a single category for the 7 amorphs (null). Molecular analysis indicated protein-coding alterations in 8 <b>hypomorphs</b> and 6 amorphs, with mild-moderate phenotypes correlating with signal peptide or basic domain mutations, and more devastating phenotypes resulting from C-terminal lesions. Ten <b>hypomorphs</b> and one null demonstrated wild-type coding potential, suggesting that they contain mutations elsewhere in the > or = 125 -kb agouti locus that either reduce the level or alter the temporal/spatial distribution of agouti transcripts.

40|$|The {{function}} of the essential cohesin-related Smc 5 -Smc 6 complex has remained elusive, though hypomorphic mutants have defects late in recombination, in checkpoint maintenance, and in chromosome segregation. Recombination and checkpoints are not essential for viability, and Smc 5 -Smc 6 -null mutants die in lethal mitoses. This suggests that the chromosome segregation defects may {{be the source of}} lethality in irradiated Smc 5 -Smc 6 <b>hypomorphs.</b> We show that in smc 6 mutants, following DNA damage in interphase, chromosome arm segregation fails due to an aberrant persistence of cohesin, which is normally removed by the Separase-independent pathway. This postanaphase persistence of cohesin is not dependent on DNA damage, since the synthetic lethality of smc 6 <b>hypomorphs</b> with a topoisomerase II mutant, defective in mitotic chromosome structure, is also due to the retention of cohesin on undamaged chromosome arms. In both cases, Separase overexpression bypasses the defect and restores cell viability, showing that defective cohesin removal is a major determinant of the mitotic lethality of Smc 5 -Smc 6 mutant...|$|R
40|$|Recent work {{indicates}} that thyroid hormone receptor-associated protein 220 (TRAP 220), a subunit of the multiprotein TRAP coactivator complex, {{is essential for}} embryonic survival. We have generated TRAP 220 conditional null mice that are hypomorphic and express the gene at reduced levels. In contrast to TRAP 220 null mice, which die at embryonic d 11. 5 (E 11. 5), hypomorphic mice survive until E 13. 5. The reduced expression in <b>hypomorphs</b> results in hepatic necrosis, defects in hematopoiesis, and hypoplasia of the ventricular myocardium, similar to that observed in TRAP 220 null embryos at an earlier stage. The embryonic lethality of null embryos at E 11. 5 is due to placental insufficiency. Tetraploid aggregation assays partially rescues embryonic development until E 13. 5, when embryonic loss occurs due to hepatic necrosis coupled with poor myocardial development as observed in <b>hypomorphs.</b> These findings demonstrate that, for normal placental function, there is an absolute requirement for TRAP 220 in extraembryonic tissues at E 11. 5, with an additional requirement in embryonic tissues for hepatic and cardiovascular development thereafter...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTo {{understand}} {{the roles of}} secretory peptides in developmental signaling, we have studied Drosophila mutant for the gene peptidylglycine α-hydroxylating monooxygenase (PHM). PHM is the rate-limiting enzyme for C-terminal α-amidation, a specific and necessary modification of secretory peptides. In insects, more than 90 % of known or predicted neuropeptides are amidated. PHM mutants lack PHM protein and enzyme activity; most null animals die as late embryos with few morphological defects. Natural and synthetic PHM <b>hypomorphs</b> revealed phenotypes that resembled those of animals with mutations in genes of the ecdysone-inducible regulatory circuit. Animals bearing a strong hypomorphic allele contain no detectable PHM enzymatic activity or protein; ∼ 50 % hatch and initially display normal behavior, then die as young larvae, often while attempting to molt. PHM mutants were rescued with daily induction of a PHM transgene and complete rescue was seen with induction limited to the first 4 days after egg-laying. The rescued mutant adults produced progeny which survived to various stages up through metamorphosis (synthetic <b>hypomorphs)</b> and displayed prepupal and pupal phenotypes resembling those of ecdysone-response gene mutations. Examination of neuropeptide biosynthesis in PHM mutants revealed specific disruptions: Amidated peptides were largely absent in strong <b>hypomorphs,</b> but peptide precursors, a nonamidated neuropeptide, nonpeptide transmitters, and other peptide biosynthetic enzymes were readily detected. Mutant adults that were produced by a minimal rescue schedule had lowered PHM enzyme levels and reproducibly altered patterns of amidated neuropeptides in the CNS. These deficits were partially reversed within 24 h by a single PHM induction in the adult stage. These genetic results {{support the hypothesis that}} secretory peptide signaling is critical for transitions between developmental stages, without strongly affecting morphogenetic events within a stage. Further, they show that PHM is required for peptide α-amidating activity throughout the life of Drosophila. Finally, they define novel methods to study neural and endocrine peptide biosynthesis and functions in vivo...|$|R

B. burgdorferi induces expression of β 2 /CD 18 integrins, adhesion molecules that mediate the firm adhesion of leukocytes to the endothelium necessary for cellular extravasation during inflammation. The important role of β 2 /CD 18 integrins during extravasation suggests that these molecules {{play a role in}} the development of Lyme arthritis and carditis. The dependency of these inflammatory processes on the β 2 integrins was investigated in CD 18 <b>hypomorph</b> mice, which express low levels of CD 18. The results indicate that CD 18 deficiency did not abrogate development of Lyme arthritis or carditis. Moreover, it resulted in increased severity of Lyme carditis. B. burgdorferi-infected CD 18 <b>hypomorph</b> mice showed an increased macrophage infiltration of the heart, while they produced lower levels of borreliacidal anti-B. burgdorferi antibodies compared to wild-type mice. In accordance with these results, we demonstrate that dendritic cells from CD 18 <b>hypomorph</b> mice secrete higher levels of monocyte/macrophage chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP- 1 /CCL 2) in response to B. burgdorferi. Similarly, we show by real-time PCR that B. burgdorferi-infected hearts from CD 18 <b>hypomorph</b> mice express increased levels of MCP- 1 RNA compared to wild-type mice. Overall, our results indicate that β 2 integrin deficiency does not abrogate B. burgdorferi-induced inflammation; rather, it results in increased recruitment of macrophages into the B. burgdorferi-infected heart, likely due to the increased expression of MCP- 1 in this tissue. Thus, β 2 integrins may play a regulatory role in B. burgdorferi-induced inflammation beyond mediating adhesion of leukocytes to the endothelium...|$|E

Inflammation is associated with PAH and vascular remodeling, but whether allergic inflammation triggers vascular remodeling in individuals with BMPR 2 mutations is unknown. Our goal was to determine if chronic allergic inflammation would induce more severe vascular remodeling and PAH in mice with reduced BMPR-II signaling. Groups of Bmpr 2 <b>hypomorph</b> and wild-type (WT) Balb/c/Byj mice were exposed to house dust mite (HDM) allergen, intranasally for 7 or 20 weeks to generate a model of chronic inflammation. HDM exposure induced similar inflammatory cell counts in all groups compared to controls. Muscularization of pulmonary arterioles and arterial wall thickness were increased after 7 weeks HDM, more severe at 20 weeks, but similar in both groups. Right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) was measured by direct cardiac catheterization to assess PAH. RVSP was similarly increased in both HDM exposed groups after 20 weeks compared to controls, but not after 7 weeks. Airway hyperreactivity (AHR) to methacholine was also assessed and interestingly, at 20 weeks, was more severe in HDM exposed Bmpr 2 <b>hypomorph</b> mice versus WT. We conclude that chronic allergic inflammation caused PAH and while the severity was mild and similar between WT and Bmpr 2 <b>hypomorph</b> mice, AHR was enhanced with reduced BMPR-II signaling.

40|$|CD 18 <b>hypomorph</b> mice expressing reduced {{levels of}} the common β 2 {{integrin}} chain develop aggravated Lyme carditis, compared to that developed by wild-type (WT) mice, upon infection with the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi. The enhancement of Lyme carditis in these mice is characterized by increased macrophage infiltration, correlating with augmented expression of the monocyte/macrophage chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP- 1). The lack of CD 18 results in the deficiency of all β 2 integrins, i. e., CD 11 a/CD 18 (LFA- 1), CD 11 b/CD 18 (Mac- 1 /CR 3), CD 11 c/CD 18 (p 150, 95 /CR 4), and CD 11 d/CD 18. To determine {{the roles of the}} various β 2 integrins in controlling the development of aggravated Lyme carditis, disease induction was analyzed in CD 11 a−/−, CD 11 b−/−, and CD 11 c−/− mice. CD 11 a−/− and CD 11 c−/− mice, but not CD 11 b−/− mice, developed aggravated Lyme carditis after exposure to B. burgdorferi.

40|$|There is {{increasing}} evidence that non-coding macroRNAs are major elements for silencing imprinted genes, but their {{mechanism of action}} is poorly understood. Within the imprinted Gnas cluster on mouse chromosome 2, Nespas is a paternally expressed macroRNA that arises from an imprinting control region and runs antisense to Nesp, a paternally repressed protein coding transcript. Here we report a knock-in mouse allele that behaves as a Nespas <b>hypomorph.</b> The <b>hypomorph</b> mediates down-regulation of Nesp in cis through chromatin modification at the Nesp promoter but {{in the absence of}} somatic DNA methylation. Notably there is reduced demethylation of H 3 K 4 me 3, sufficient for down-regulation of Nesp, but insufficient for DNA methylation; in addition, there is depletion of the H 3 K 36 me 3 mark permissive for DNA methylation. We propose an order of events for the regulation of a somatic imprint on the wild-type allele whereby Nespas modulates demethylation of H 3 K 4 me 3 resulting in repression of Nesp followed by DNA methylation. This study demonstrates that a non-coding antisense transcript or its transcription is associated with silencing an overlapping proteincoding gene by a mechanism independent of DNA methylation.

In this study we aim to show that the schizophrenia susceptibility gene neuregulin 1 (Nrg 1) modulates the development of tolerance to cannabinoids in mice. Nrg 1 heterozygous (HET) and wild-type (WT) mice were treated daily for 15 d with the synthetic analogue of D 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol, CP 55, 940 (0. 4 mg/kg). We measured the impact of this exposure on locomotor activity, anxiety, prepulse inhibition (PPI), body temperature and FosB/DFosB immunohistochemistry. Tolerance to CP 55, 940 -induced hypothermia and locomotor suppression developed more rapidly in Nrg 1 HET mice than WT mice. Conversely in the light-dark test, while tolerance to the anxiogenic effect of CP 55, 940 developed in WT mice over days of testing, Nrg 1 <b>hypomorphs</b> maintained marked anxiety even after 15 d of treatment. Repeated cannabinoid exposure selectively increased FosB/DFosB expression in the lateral septum, ventral part (LSV) of Nrg 1 HET but not WT mice. On day 1 of exposure opposite effects of CP 55, 940 treatment were observed on PPI, i. e. it was facilitated in Nrg 1 <b>hypomorphs</b> and impaired in WT mice, despite the drug significantly impairing the acoustic startle reflex equally in both genotypes. These effects of CP 55, 940 on PPI were not maintained as both genotypes became tolerant to cannabinoid action with repeated exposure.

Although DNA damage and cell death can occur independently of p 53, p 53 -deficient cancer cells were much more sensitive to Plk 1 depletion than cancer cells with functional p 53. Next, the lentivirus-based RNAi approach was used to generate a series of Plk 1 hypomorphs.

In well-synchronized HeLa cells, a medium level of Plk 1 depletion caused a 2 -h delay of mitotic progression, and a high degree of Plk 1 depletion significantly delayed mitotic entry and completely blocked cells at mitosis. In striking contrast, normal hTERT-RPE 1 and MCF 10 A cells were much less sensitive to Plk 1 depletion than HeLa cells; no apparent cell proliferation defect or cell cycle arrest was observed after Plk 1 depletion in these cells.

40|$|The {{proto-oncogene}} Sno {{has been}} shown to be a negative regulator of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) signaling in vitro, using overexpression and artificial reporter systems. To examine Sno function in vivo, we made two targeted deletions at the Sno locus: a 5 ′ deletion, with reduced Sno protein (<b>hypomorph),</b> and an exon 1 deletion removing half the protein coding sequence, in which Sno protein is undetectable in homozygotes (null). Homozygous Sno <b>hypomorph</b> and null mutant mice are viable without gross developmental defects. We found that Sno mRNA is constitutively expressed in normal thymocytes and splenic T cells, with increased expression 1 h following T-cell receptor ligation. Although thymocyte and splenic T-cell populations appeared normal in mutant mice, T-cell proliferation in response to activating stimuli was defective in both mutant strains. This defect could be reversed by incubation with either anti-TGF-β antibodies or exogenous interleukin- 2 (IL- 2). Together, these findings suggest that Sno-dependent suppression of TGF-β signaling is required for upregulation of growth factor production and normal T-cell proliferation following receptor ligation. Indeed, both IL- 2 and IL- 4 levels are reduced in response to anti-CD 3 ɛ stimulation of mutant T cells, and transfected Sno activated an IL- 2 reporter system in non-T cells. Mutant mouse embryo fibroblasts also exhibited a reduced cell proliferation rate that could be reversed by administration of anti-TGF-β.

40|$|Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a {{neurodegenerative}} disease characterized by loss of motor neuron function. This disease can lead to paralysis and respiratory failure followed by death. TDP- 43, TAR DNA binding protein, is a major disease protein found in ALS patients. In patients with the disease, mutant TDP- 43 levels disrupt various cellular processes and create neurotoxicity in motor neurons as well as glia. TDP- 43 interacts with Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP) in cytoplasmic stress granules. FMRP has numerous molecular protein targets including futsch and profilin. Published data shows that loss of FMRP leads to increased futsch and profilin expression. Conversely, an increase in FMRP expression results in down regulation of Futsch and Profilin levels through translational regulation. In addition, there is also data to suggest that FMRP can regulate the expression of TDP- 43. This project {{was based on the}} hypothesis that disease causing TDP- 43 mutations associate with stress granules and recruit FMRP. This results in less FMRP being available to regulate its translational targets such as futsch and profiling and a subsequent increase in Futsch and Profilin protein levels. This working model predicts that reducing futsch and/or profilin levels will alleviate TDP- 43 toxicity. To test this model three main examinations were performed. The first involved characterizing the phenotype of futsch <b>hypomorphs</b> to determine their effect on TDP- 43 induced neurodegeneration. The second was to see how futsch and chickadee (Drosophila profilin) levels change with varying levels of FMRP.

We confirmed that Nlrp 5 mutant and wild-type females possess comparable ovarian germ pool and follicular recruitment rates. However, ovulated oocytes lacking Nlrp 5 have abnormal mitochondrial localization and increase...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{superoxide}} dismutase (SOD) family of enzymes regulate {{reactive oxygen species}} by scavenging superoxide. In Drosophila homologues {{of two of the}} mammalian SODs, the intracellular (Sod 1) and mitochondrial (Sod 2) SODs, have been studied extensively indicating a link between SOD and ageing. Recently the sequence of a third Sod gene, homologous to both mammalian (Sod 3) and C. elegans (Sod 4) extracellular Sod, was identified in Drosophila and is also predicted to locate extracellularly (Sod 3). We have cloned and sequenced this gene, identifying two gene products formed by alternative splicing. Here we report differential sex specific Sod 3 expression patterns along with validation of a Sod 3 <b>hypomorph</b> mutant. Furthermore, we indicate a functional role of Sod 3 in protecting against H 2 O 2 induced oxidative stress. <br/...|$|E
40|$|Green tea is {{a popular}} {{beverage}} believed to have many health benefits including reducing the risks of neurodegenerative disorders, cardiovascular disease, and some cancers. As such, {{it has been suggested}} as a candidate life-extending natural product. Rich in polyphenolic compounds known as catechins, green tea has been shown to increase the lifespan of various animal models including the fruit fly,Drosophila melanogaster. Despite this, inconsistencies in reported data have been cited. In this dissertation, green tea’s life extension mechanisms were explored in a standard laboratory Drosophila strain, w 1118. Green tea was found to increase male Drosophila lifespan by 19 %, but had no effect on female lifespan. Interestingly, this effect was associated with a reduction in male fly fertility. This is important as impairments in reproduction can modulate fruit fly lifespan. Moreover,green tea showed a modest protection against iron-induced oxidative stress, likely by its ability to bind iron. Since iron has been evidenced to play an essential role in male fly fertility, this dissertation explored the unique interplay of green tea on iron homeostasis, fertility and Drosophila lifespan. Processes that can modulate fly healthspan,such as development and reproduction, were evaluated. Green tea was found to delay larval development, reduce offspring sizes, and atrophied reproductive organs. From this it was suggested that green tea is toxic to Drosophila’s physiological processes. Green tea’s ability to chelate iron and modulate iron metabolism was evaluated using <b>hypomorph</b> mutants of iron-regulating proteins. Specifically, the lifespan and fertility of mitoferrin, a mitochondrial iron transporter, transferrin, an extracellular iron binding protein, and Malvolio, the fly homolog of the divalent-metal transporter- 1, were characterized. <b>Hypomorph</b> flies displayed increased lifespans and reduced fertility than normal flies. Interestingly, green tea could no longer increase the lifespan of mitoferrin and Malvolio flies but did rescue the reduced male fertility phenotype. This was associated with an up-regulation of mitoferrin and Malvolio expression. Combined, these results support the possibility that green tea increases male Drosophila lifespan in part by the modulation of iron homeostasis that is essential for male fly fertility...|$|E
40|$|KIF 14 is a {{microtubule}} motor protein whose elevated {{expression is}} associated with poor-prognosis breast cancer. Here we demonstrate KIF 14 accumulation in mitotic cells, where it associated with developing spindle poles and spindle microtubules. Cells at later stages of mitosis were characterized by the concentration of KIF 14 at the midbody. Time-lapse microscopy revealed that strong RNA interference (RNAi) -mediated silencing of KIF 14 induced cytokinesis failure, causing several rounds of endoreduplication and resulting in multinucleated cells. Additionally, less efficacious KIF 14 -specific short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) induced multiple phenotypes, all of which resulted in acute apoptosis. Our data demonstrate the ability of siRNA-mediated silencing to generate epiallelic <b>hypomorphs</b> associated with KIF 14 depletion. Furthermore, the link we observed between siRNA efficacy and phenotypic outcome indicates that distinct stages during cell cycle progression are disrupted by the differential modulation of KIF 14 expression...|$|R
40|$|VEGFA {{signaling}} {{is critical}} for endothelial and hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) specification. However, blood defects resulting from perturbation of the VEGFA pathway are always accompanied by impaired vascular/arterial development. Because HSCs derive from arterial cells, {{it is unclear whether}} VEGFA directly contributes to HSC specification. This is an important question for our understanding of how HSCs are formed and for developing their production in vitro. Through knockdown of the regulator ETO 2 in embryogenesis, we report a specific decrease in expression of medium/long Vegfa isoforms in somites. This leads to absence of Notch 1 expression and failure of HSC specification in the dorsal aorta (DA), independently of vessel formation and arterial specification. Vegfa <b>hypomorphs</b> and isoform-specific (medium/long) morphants not only recapitulate this phenotype but also demonstrate that VEGFA short isoform is sufficient for DA development. Therefore, sequential, isoform-specific VEGFA signaling successively induces the endothelial, arterial, and HSC programs in the DA...|$|R
40|$|SummaryTemperature {{compensation}} of circadian clocks is an unsolved problem with {{relevance to the}} general phenomenon of biological compensation. We identify casein kinase 2 (CK 2) as a key regulator of temperature {{compensation of}} the Neurospora clock by determining that two long-standing clock mutants, chrono and period- 3, displaying distinctive alterations in compensation encode the β 1 and α subunits of CK 2, respectively. Reducing the dose of these subunits, particularly β 1, significantly alters temperature compensation without altering the enzyme's Q 10.  By contrast, other kinases and phosphatases implicated in clock function do not play appreciable roles in temperature compensation. CK 2 exerts its effects on the clock by directly phosphorylating FREQUENCY (FRQ), and this phosphorylation is compromised in CK 2 <b>hypomorphs.</b> Finally, mutation of certain putative CK 2 phosphosites on FRQ, shown to be phosphorylated in vivo, predictably alters temperature compensation profiles effectively phenocopying CK 2 mutants...|$|R
