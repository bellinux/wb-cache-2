The quarter-sawn maple action parts are mounted on a metallic frame, which consists of seamless brass tubes with rosette-shaped contours, <b>force-fitted</b> with maple dowels and brass hangers. The surface of the white keys is made of polymer, but was earlier made of elephant ivory. Around the 1950s, Steinway switched from using elephant ivory, and some years later use of ivory for piano keys was outlawed.|$|E

40|$|High {{levels of}} {{automation}} in manufacturing industries are leading to data sets of increasing size and dimension. The challenge facing statisticians and field professionals {{is to develop}} methodology to help meet this demand. Functional data {{is one example of}} high-dimensional data characterized by observations recorded as a function of some continuous measure, such as time. An application considered in this thesis comes from the automotive industry. It involves a production process in which valve seats are <b>force-fitted</b> by a ram into cylinder heads of automobile engines. For each insertion, the force exerted by the ram is automatically recorded every fraction of a second for {{about two and a half}} seconds, generating a force profile. We can think of these profiles as individual functions of time summarized into collections of curves. The focus of this thesis is the analysis of functional process data such as the valve seat insertion example. A number of techniques are set forth. In the first part, two ways to model a single curve are considered: a b-spline fit via linear regression, and a nonlinear model based on differential equations. Each of these approaches is incorporated into a mixed effects model for multiple curves, and multivariate process monitoring techniques are applied to the predicted random effects in order to identify anomalous curves. In the second part, a Bayesian hierarchical model is used to cluster low-dimensional summaries of the curves into meaningful groups. The belief is that the clusters correspond to distinct types of processes (e. g. various types of “good” or “faulty” assembly). New observations can be assigned to one of these by calculating the probabilities of belonging to each cluster. Mahalanobis distances are used to identify new observations not belonging to any of the existing clusters. Synthetic and real data are used to validate the results...|$|E

The LIGA test mechanism studied in this paper is a ratchet drive mechanism consisting primarily of pawls, cams, and springs {{ranging in size from}} about one-half millimeter to tens of millimeters of various nickel alloys fabricated using the LIGA process. To assemble the test mechanism, subassemblies are made by inserting <b>force-fit</b> pins into stacks of piece-parts. These pins are cut from 170 μm wire and range from 500 to 1000 μm in length. Human insertion of these pins is extremely difficult due to their small size and tolerances required to perform the <b>force-fit</b> operation.

40|$|Integration of {{electronics}} into textiles needs two connection steps. On the one hand, the mechanical {{connection to a}} textile material {{and on the other}} hand, the electrical connection to integrated conductive structures. Both connections have to be reliable. In the last ten years different technologies were used for this task. Almost all of them need a temperature step either for melting or curing. This work presents an alternative method that can be applied at room temperature. It is simple, fast, and cost-efficient. The conducted experiments analyze the forcedependent contact resistance between three different conductors and metal strip lines of different widths. As a result conductive yarns need much higher contact forces to gain low and stable contact resistances. This is due to their particular configuration and thin peripheral conductive layers. Wider strip lines will enhance their contact resistances. Cross-section analyses of loaded yarns together with the measured data allow for these interpretations. A design of a <b>force-fit</b> interconnection as well as a prototype is presented. Two plates are clamped to a piece of fabric with integrated conductive yarn. The developing elastic force is directed to the contact members. A final thermal cycling test between − 40 °C and + 85 °C for 1000 hours confirms the applicability of <b>force-fit</b> interconnections for smart textiles...|$|R

40|$|<b>Force-fit</b> {{integration}} of piezoceramic fibers in micro-formed structures {{is a new}} approach for functionintegration in structural sheet metal parts. In a first step, a micro-structured surface is formed in a planarsemi-finished sheet metal part by micro-impact extrusion. Piezoceramic fibers are then assembled intothis micro-structured surface with a small assembly clearance. The fibers and the structured surface ofthe sheet metal are joined by a forming process. In the next step, the sheet metal with piezoceramicfibres within a locally micro-formed substructure is shaped by deep drawing into a 3 D-geometry. In thispaper, results of the micro-impact extrusion and the joining by forming experiments are presented. Fur-thermore, the design constraints for assembly and joining due to the dimensional and form deviations ofthe piezoceramic fibers are discussed. Results of a numerical study of micro-forming, joining by formingand the global loading during a deep drawing process step were in good agreement with the experimen-tal investigations.

50|$|It {{consists}} of inserting a thread through a layered dry fabric, using a needle that, after insertion, moves {{back along the}} same trajectory leaving a loop of the thread {{on the bottom of}} the structure. It is a technology developed for and used within the thermoset resin injection manufacturing route, however it is currently being debated whether also pre-pregs can be successfully tufted. Tufting is considered a more economical and flexible method compared to 3D weaving or 3D braiding to include z-fibres in laminated composites. It resembles stitching, but it is different in that tufting only requires access from one side of the preform. Depending on the equipment used, all shapes and forms may potentially be reinforced by tufting. The density of z-fibres inserted can vary according to the expected loading pattern. On the other hand, the increase of z-properties in the dry preform is comparably low because tufting comprises no <b>force-fit.</b> Consequently, before consolidation, tufted preforms are not easier to handle than unreinforced ones. In fact the loops can represent an added complexity for the resin infusion process as they can complicate the consolidation of the structure.|$|R

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of future automotive drive trains gains importance due to rising energy {{costs and the}} reduction of CO 2 emissions. Thermo-Electric Generators (TEG) are devices that convert heat directly into electric energy. The use of waste heat from automotive exhaust systems to generate electricity is explored in the automotive industry as means to reduce fuel consumption.

40|$|The form-locked, <b>force-fit</b> and {{materially}} bonded {{integration of}} temperature-sensitive actuators and sensors in complex metal parts or metallic monolithic structures {{is still a}} dissolved problem. On the one hand, embedded actuators and sensors require an optimum shape and material connection to optimally low loss coupling the desired measuring gradient (gradient force) to the sensor and to low loss coupling the actuating gradient (gradient force) into the structure where the actuator/sensor is embedded in. On the other hand, the actuators/sensors need to be materially bonded at interfaces with its surrounding structure with thermal protection from laser melting process. Such a strategy assumes that the actuator/sensor is coated by a thermal-shielding multi-material/multi-layer protection system preferably from ceramic and metallic material components. The integration interface between actuator/sensor system and surrounding structure is thereby designed {{in such a way}} that the main flow of energy is topically focused on this interface and distributed away from and around the actuator/sensor system. In this way, the total energy input into the temperature-sensitive actuator/sensor system is reduced. Also addressed are laser scanning patterns for less topical temperature load.

40|$|Wayne Booth {{and other}} rhetorical critics have {{developed}} methods for examining the rhetorical aspects of fiction. In this dissertation, I examine, specifically, {{the use of}} rhetorical violence in American fiction. It is my premise that authors use rhetorical violence and the irrationality of violence created mimetically to construct ironic metaphors that comment on the irrationality of the ideology behind the violence, pushing that ideology's maxims to its logical ends. The goal of rhetorical violence, therefore, is to create the conditions for a transfer of culpability so that the act becomes transitive-transferable-loosed from its moorings. Culpability, if indeed it reflects something intrinsically awry with an ideology, becomes {{the fault of the}} ideology-????????it becomes the perpetrator of illogic and the condemnatory force associated with the act of violence gets transferred to it. Hence, if the author has created an effective metaphor, when he or she flips the violent scene'????????s "????????value," the audience is willing to follow along. The violence remains a great evil, but the culpability for the act is shifted to a representative of the ideology in question-as-victimizer; nonetheless, that transfer can only occur inasmuch as the audience is willing to <b>force-fit</b> the incongruities of the metaphor. I examine this rhetorical phenomenon in the works of three modern American writers: Flannery O'Connor, Toni Morrison, and Chuck Palahniuk. I seek to examine the ideologies questioned in these works, the contradictory beliefs expressed by the authors, and to explicate primary episodes in the works of fiction wherein rhetorical violence functions in a rhetorical fashion to promulgate the author's ideology by emotionally jarring the reader loose from commonly-held ideological assumptions in three specific appeals: first, to negate one socially-held ideology in order to promote a conflicting one (Wise Blood); second, to elicit compassion for victimized characters representing social ills (Beloved); third, to call into question the validity of social institutions and practices (Fight Club) ...|$|R
40|$|My {{work with}} {{mathematical}} modeling and computer simulations {{began in earnest}} in 1987 when I signed on with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, better known as NASA. At the time I was developing computer simulations to support the design of carbon dioxide (CO 2) removal systems for the International Space Station (ISS) life support system. CO 2 is a human metabolic waste, produced {{at a rate of}} a kilogram per day per crewmember. CO 2 must be removed from the crew cabin, as it will quickly become detrimental to crew health. The systems used to remove CO 2 are typically based on sorption processes, which include complex interactions of heat transfer, mass transfer, and gas flow through porous media. At this time, there were no commercial options for solving a set of coupled mathematical models such as partial differential equations (PDEs); you either <b>force-fit</b> the physics into a thermal analysis package or wrote your own code, complete with discretization, meshing, and solution algorithms. Unfortunately, coding CO 2 removal processes from scratch did not allow an appropriate focus on the challenging yet crucial task of understanding and capturing the underlying physics via appropriate mathematical models. Configuration control was often simply ignored due to tight schedules, resulting in a code that would be quicker for a second party to rewrite than modify. In the early 2000 s, I decided to move CO 2 removal simulations to a platform with built-in meshing, solvers, and postprocessing capabilities, and that could solve user-defined multiphysics PDEs. The program chosen to meet these needs was COMSOL Multiphysics. Along with freeing the engineer to focus on the underlying physics, a degree of configuration control was automatically achieved via a consistent user interface, thus allowing COMSOL users to share computer models. My team has developed simulations that are already providing a valuable debugging capability for the ISS CO 2 removal system, and will provide guidance in upgrades to that system...|$|R
