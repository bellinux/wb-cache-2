It is noteworthy that BETA of France and NIST of the USA had introduced their respective methods in the 1990 s to assess the impacts of large-scale R&D projects such as the <b>European</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Programme</b> (Bach and Lambert 1992) and Measurement and Standards Laboratory Programme (Tassey 1999). These methods were subsequently adopted by other countries such as Japan {{in their study}} of techno-economic impact of large-scale R&D projects (Kondo 2012). While these methods have been useful for estimating the impact of R&D projects, their limitation on the timing and size of the impact studies has been highlighted as the projects selected for studies must have either completed or achieved some significant benefits. As the time elapsed between project start-up and project benefit realisation might range two to seven  years, based on past studies (Tassey 1999), BETA and NIST used these methods only for large-scale projects, while employing other forms of intermediate indicators, such as new companies started and product or process innovation for periodic and more pragmatic assessment of their innovation impact.|$|E

40|$|The European {{aerospace}} industry has an extensive experience of collaborative development. This {{began in the}} mid to late 1950 s with co-production of the US F- 104 and Hawk missile, as well as the NATO-sponsored Fiat G- 91 and Bregeut Atlantic. Collaboration came of age with the Franco-German Transall military transport, the Anglo-French Concorde and Jaguar fighter programmes launched in the early 1960 s. These were followed by the Airbus and Tornado, several missile and helicopter joint ventures and the beginnings of a <b>European</b> <b>space</b> <b>programme.</b> The initial experience of collaboration was neither easy nor harmonious, with national and corporate rivalries, disputes over work shares and project leadership, and problems stemming from fluctuating political support, providing a continuous backdrop to development. By the 1970 s, however, collaboration was accepted as a routine strategy for European aerospace programmes and some of the early problems had been eased by the experience of successfully working together. Practice, and some expensive lessons, had also led to the evolution of more efficient and equitable forms of managing international projects. In particular, the emergence of trans-national project-based consortia such as Panavia (Tornado) and Airbus Industrie, was viewed as a major advance in international programme management. In the case of civil programmes, the growth of industry-led rather than government-inspired collaboration was regarded as an even more significant improvement. Overall, the result of European collaboration up to the late 1980 s was to bind European firms in a network of agreements and joining projects, but which did not at the same time entail the surrender of national control over aerospace...|$|E
40|$|In November 2001, {{by means}} of a Resolution, the European Union officially {{launched}} 2 ̆ 7 Global Monitoring for the Environment and Security 2 ̆ 7 (GMES), the second <b>European</b> <b>space</b> <b>programme</b> (after Galileo) essentially driven by the Union. The Resolution inter alia calls for the European Commission to coordinate with the European Space Agency (ESA) the realisation of 2 ̆ 2 an operational and autonomous European capability for global monitoring for environment and security 2 ̆ 2 by 2008, crucially involving a satellite system. Relevant data which are to form part of such a capability may, in principle, come from a number of different sources: space-based data, airborne data, and in situ-generated data of different terrestrial origin. However, non-space data almost by definition are generated within one national state or other, which means that applicable law and regulation in principle differs—and sometimes hugely so—from state to state, whilst generally not having developed with any specific consideration for the types of data involved in GMES either. By contrast, outer space is an international area outside of any state 2 ̆ 7 s international individual jurisdiction, where operational paradigms of a principally international, even global character apply. This also has a profound impact on the legal issues closely connected to the generation of space-based data, as opposed to data generated in other modes where national sovereignty remains fully visible. Moreover, the space-part is clearly the most distinguishing factor of any GMES operation, in view also of the envisaged fundamental role of satellites, ESA and likely EUMETSAT in this context. For the purpose of GMES the establishment of a core entity provisionally labelled 2 ̆ 7 GMES Authority 2 ̆ 7 is envisaged. Legal basis, status, role and competencies of such a body are yet to be determined. The documents so far referring to such a GMES Authority generally discuss various types of bodies or organs that can be established under EC law. Thus, mention has been made of such options as a Joint Undertaking, an Executive Agency, a Community Agency, or a Joint Technology Initiative (JTI). A final important point, of a more background/political nature but so far left largely unattended (at least in public discourse) concerns the involvement of GMES in security issues, in the field of outer space where traditionally 2 ̆ 7 defence 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 security 2 ̆ 7 have never been very far away. Whilst 2 ̆ 7 security 2 ̆ 7 is broadly conceived so as to include civil security, involving not only terrorist threats but also the threats posed by natural or man-made disasters, it certainly also includes the more traditional security issues of a military and defence nature. GMES, whatever the 2 ̆ 7 GMES Authority 2 ̆ 7 will come to look like, will have the European Union for a father and ESA for a mother...|$|E
40|$|Within the <b>European</b> <b>space</b> <b>programme,</b> a new {{upper stage}} engine (Vinci) for the Ariane 5 {{launcher}} is being developed, and the Volvo Aero Corporation (VAC) is contributing with tur-bines for the fuel turbopumps. This MSc thesis investigates {{the possibility of}} designing the Turbine Exhaust Duct (TED) of the Vinci-engine in a carbon fibre composite material with adhesively attached titanium flanges. The focus of the project has been on stress analyses of the adhesive joints using Finite Element Methods (FEM), more specifically by using a cohe-sive zone material (CZM) to model the adhesive layer. Analysing adhesive joints is complex and {{an important part of}} the work has been to develop and concretise analysis methods for future use within VAC. To obtain the specialised material parameters needed for a CZM analysis, FE-models of ten-sile test specimens were analysed and the results compared to those of equivalent experimen-tal tensile tests. These parameters were then used when analysing the TED geometry with load cases specified to simulate the actual operation conditions of the Vinci engine. Both two-dimensional axisymmetric and fully three-dimensional models were analysed and, addition-ally, a study was performed to evaluate the effect of cryogenic temperatures on the strength of the joint. The results show that the applied thermal and structural loading causes local stress concentra-tions on the adhesive surface, but the stresses are not high enough to cause damage to the joint if a suitable joint design is used. Cryogenic temperatures (- 150 °C) caused a significant strength reduction in the tensile specimens, partially through altered adhesive properties, but no such severe effects were seen in the temperature-dependent FE-analyses of the TED. It should be pointed out however, that some uncertainties about the material parameters exist, since these were obtained in a rather unconventional way. There are also several other impor-tant questions, beside the strength of the adhesive joint, that need to be answered before a metal-composite TED can be realised. Volvo Aero deltar i utvecklingen av Vinci, en ny motor till det övre steget i den europeiska Ariane 5 -raketen. Detta examensarbete behandlar möjligheten att tillverka ett turbinutlopp (TED) till vätgasturbinen i Vinci-motorn i kompositmaterial med flänsar i titan för att på så sätt uppnå en viktbesparing gentemot den tidigare konstruktionen i gjuten Inconel 718. Fokus har legat på att analysera hållfastheten i de limfogar som är tänkta att sammanfoga huvudröret med flänsarna, genom analyser med finita elementmetoden (FEM). Ett viktigt syfte har även varit att, för Volvo Aeros räkning, samla praktiska erfarenheter angående numerisk analys av limfogar, särskilt med användning av kohesiva zon-element för att modellera limfogen. FEM-analyser har gjorts av provstavsmodeller, där resultaten sedan jämförts med experimen-tella dragprovsresultat för att ta fram lämpliga material- och modelleringsparametrar för ana-lys med kohesiva zonelement. Därefter tillämpades dessa parametrar i analyser av den verkli-ga TED-geometrin med relevanta lastfall framtagna för att simulera driftsförhållandena i Vin-ci-motorn. Lastfallsanalyser med både tvådimensionellt axisymmetriska och tredimensionella geometrimodeller genomfördes, liksom uppskattningar av limfogens styrka vid kryogena driftstemperaturer. Resultaten pekar entydigt mot att en limfog med en ändamålsenlig tvärsnittsgeometri skulle hålla för de angivna lasterna utan att ta skada. De spänningskoncentrationer som uppstår ger lokalt höga spänningar i limmet, men inte på nivåer som skulle kunna orsaka brott. Det finns dock en viss osäkerhet angående riktigheten i materialparametrarna då en något okonventio-nell metod användes för att ta fram dessa. Flera stora frågor finns fortfarande kvar att besvara innan en metall-komposit konstruktion kan realiseras, inte minst hur flödeskammarens kom-plicerade geometri skall kunna tillverkas i kompositmaterial...|$|E

System of Systems (SoS) {{engineering}} {{introduces a}} higher level of complexity compared to conventional systems engineering, for the number and geographical distribution of resources, and for interoperability and agreements issues, for example. In domains such as defence or Information Technology, architecting methodologies have been introduced to address engineering needs deriving from this increased level of complexity. From ongoing and future <b>European</b> <b>space</b> <b>programmes,</b> ESA has identified new engineering needs that cannot be addressed with existing methodologies. These needs concern the use of the methodology to support decision making, the representation of European regulation and policies, and the representation of space-specific domain concepts. In this paper, we introduce the <b>European</b> <b>Space</b> Agency Architectural Framework (ESA-AF), an architecting methodology that aims to address these new engineering needs by improving on existing architecting methodologies. In addition, ESA-AF introduces exploitation tools for userfriendly interactive visualisation of SoS architectural models and for textual reporting of model data, enabling non technical users to exploit these models. We also briefly present example applications of ESA-AF in support of SoS engineering activities for the Galileo navigation, the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES), and the Space Situational Awareness (SSA) programmes.
