25|$|<b>Downshifting</b> {{is similar}} to up-shifting but in reverse order, and is slower, at 600milliseconds, due to the engine's Electronic Control Unit, or ECU, needing to 'blip' the {{throttle}} so that the engine crankshaft speed can match the appropriate gear shaft speed. The car's computer senses the car slowing down, or more power required (during acceleration), and thus engages a lower gear on the shaft not in use, and then completes the downshift.|$|E

Based on the {{analysis}} of Dual clutch transmission (DCT) working principle, the shift kinetics model is established, and the power switching rule between two clutches during upshift and <b>downshift</b> is established by analyzing the torque transmission relationship of vehicle driveline system during shifting, then shift process is tested on actual vehicle with Matlab/Simulink software.

40|$|Rats {{received}} {{training in}} the consummatory successive negative contrast (cSNC) situation in which access to 32 % sucrose solution during ten daily trials {{is followed by a}} <b>downshift</b> to 4 % sucrose. Separate groups were exposed to the hot plate test for pain sensitivity immediately after either the first or the second <b>downshift</b> trial (Trials 11 and 12, respectively). Rats exhibited hypoalgesia after Trial 12 <b>downshift,</b> but not after Trial 11. These results suggest that cSNC induces the release of endogenous opioids that cause hypoalgesia, but only after some experience with the <b>downshifted</b> solution. This interpretation is supported by experiments demonstrating that opioid agonists reduce cSNC, whereas opioid antagonists enhance it...|$|R
25|$|In {{the second}} {{practice}} session, {{where it was}} difficult for teams to alter their car's race set-ups because of strong crosswinds, Hamilton set the fastest lap of the day at one minute and 39.085 seconds on super-soft compound tyres; Rosberg was three-thousands of a second slower in second and had the fastest time until Hamilton's lap. Both Mercedes cars had reliability concerns with Hamilton reporting another gearbox problem and his session ended early because of a minor hydraulic issue. Rosberg had an <b>downshifting</b> concern which he later attributed to hitting his clutch pedal after lifting his leg. Alonso was third-fastest, followed by Ricciardo, Massa (who locked his brakes lightly and later spun his car) and Kimi Räikkönen. Kvyat, Magnussen, Button and Hülkenberg followed in the top ten. Romain Grosjean and his teammate Pastor Maldonado both spun in their tight-handling Lotus cars and both drivers went off into the run-off area multiple times.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{studied the}} pH-dependence of {{ribosome}} catalyzed peptidyl transfer from fMet-tRNAfMet to the aa-tRNAs Phe-tRNAPhe, Ala-tRNAAla, Gly-tRNAGly, Pro-tRNAPro, Asn-tRNAAsn, and Ile-tRNAIle, selected {{to cover a}} large range of intrinsic pKa-values for the α-amino group of their amino acids. The peptidyl transfer rates were different at pH 7. 5 and displayed different pH-dependence, quantified as the pH-value, Graphic, at which the rate was half maximal. The Graphic-values were <b>downshifted</b> relative to the intrinsic pKa-value of aa-tRNAs in bulk solution. Gly-tRNAGly had the smallest <b>downshift,</b> while Ile-tRNAIle and Ala-tRNAAla had the largest <b>downshifts.</b> These <b>downshifts</b> correlate strongly with molecular dynamics (MD) estimates of the <b>downshifts</b> in pKa-values of these aa-tRNAs upon A-site binding.

50|$|In 1968, part-throttle <b>downshift</b> {{functionality}} {{was added}} to A-904 transmissions used with 6-cylinder engines.

This change was made to maintain acceptable in-town performance with taller final-drive ratios in the rear axle — 2.76:1 rear axle gears were being furnished in applications previously equipped with 2.93:1 or 3.23:1 gearsets.

40|$|Losing {{a job or}} {{significant}} other are examples of incentive loss that result in negative emotional reactions. The occurrence of negative life events is associated with increased drinking (Keyes, Hatzenbuehler, & Hasin, 2011). Further, certain genotypes {{are more likely to}} drink alcohol in response to stressful negative life events (Blomeyer et al., 2008; Covault et al., 2007). Shared genetic factors may contribute to alcohol drinking and emotional reactivity, but this relationship is not currently well understood. We used an incentive <b>downshift</b> paradigm to address whether emotional reactivity is elevated in mice predisposed to drink alcohol. We also investigated if ethanol drinking is influenced in High Alcohol Preferring mice that had been exposed to an incentive <b>downshift.</b> Incentive <b>downshift</b> procedures have been widely utilized to model emotional reactivity, and involve shifting a high reward group to a low reward and comparing the shifted group to a consistently rewarded control group. Here, we show that replicate lines of selectively bred High Alcohol Preferring mice exhibited larger successive negative contrast effects than their corresponding replicate Low Alcohol Preferring lines, providing strong evidence for a genetic association between alcohol drinking and susceptibility to the emotional effects of negative contrast. These mice can be used to study the shared neurological and genetic underpinnings of emotional reactivity and alcohol preference. Unexpectedly, an incentive <b>downshift</b> suppressed ethanol drinking immediately following an incentive <b>downshift.</b> This could be due to a specific effect of negative contrast on ethanol consumption or a suppressive effect on consummatory behavior in general. These data suggest that either alcohol intake does not provide the anticipated negative reinforcement, or that a single test was insufficient for animals to learn to drink following incentive <b>downshift.</b> However, the emotional intensity following incentive <b>downshift</b> provides initial evidence that this type of emotional reactivity may be a predisposing factor in alcoholism...|$|R

40|$|A <b>downshift</b> {{from a more}} {{preferred}} to a less preferred incentive leads to a transient rejection of the lower incentive. This phenomenon, known as successive negative contrast (SNC), {{has been reported in}} studies with mammals, but not with fish, amphibians, or reptiles, all showing gradual adjustments to the new incentive conditions. It is assumed that an understanding of the brain systems involved in the onset of SNC in mammals will suggest likely brain areas for a comparative analysis in non mammalian vertebrates. Studies reviewed in this article show that opioid receptors are normally engaged during SNC, participate in the detection of the incentive <b>downshift,</b> play a role in SNC onset (delta receptors), and modulate recovery from SNC (kappa receptors). However, opioid receptors {{do not seem to be}} involved in the consolidation of the <b>downshift</b> memory.

40|$|This paper {{contains}} {{an analysis of}} pulse shapes produced by a delta-function disturbance of the equilibrium state of a relativistic electron beam propagating through a constant-amplitude helical magnetic wiggler field. Pulse shapes are determined by using the rel-ativistic pinch-point techniques developed by Bers, Ram, and Francis. Two pulses are produced corresponding to a convective upshifted pulse (representing {{the production of the}} high-frequency radiation desired in a free electron laser) and a <b>downshifted</b> pulse. The <b>downshifted</b> instability may be convective or absolute, depending upon the beam density and momentum spread. Parameter regimes in which the <b>downshifted</b> instability is con-vective are investigated. It is found that momentum spreads sufficiently large to suppress the absolute instability reduce the growth rate of the upshifted pulse to negligible values. Pulse shapes computed by using the Raman and Compton approximations are compared with exact pulse shapes. It is found that the Raman approximation should be applied to the <b>downshifted</b> regime for most systems of practical interest. 1...|$|R
