25|$|For many {{patients}} with stage I cancer, adjuvant (preventative) therapy following surgery {{may not be}} appropriate and patients will undergo surveillance instead. The form this surveillance takes, e.g. the type and frequency of investigations and the length time it should continue, {{will depend on the}} type of cancer (non-seminoma or seminoma), but the aim is to avoid unnecessary treatments in the {{many patients}} who are cured by their surgery, and ensure that any relapses with metastases (secondary cancers) are detected early and cured. This approach ensures that chemotherapy and or radiotherapy is only given to the patients that need it. The number of patients ultimately cured is the same using surveillance as post-operative “adjuvant” treatments, but the patients <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> follow a prolonged series of visits and tests.|$|E

2500|$|Shortly {{before the}} {{findings}} of the inquiry into Wright's death were released in September 2010, Ulster Television News broadcast a report regarding the question of collusion. South Belfast UDA brigadier Jackie McDonald explained to Ulster Television's Live Tonight the UVF's mindset at the time Wright was threatened with execution by the CLMC in 1996, [...] "It was obvious he [...] was doing his own thing and going his own way. I think he had become such an embarrassment to the UVF that they had to send word to him {{to get out of the}} country – that's when the LVF was formed, that's when the breakaway group appeared." [...] When asked by the interviewer whether or not the CLMC had actually been prepared to carry out the death threat against Wright McDonald replied, [...] "You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> kill people if you tell them to do something and they don't do it – something of that magnitude. If you say they had to go and they don't go – the defiance alone, it doesn't leave many alternatives". McDonald expressed his personal belief that there had probably been no state collusion in Wright's death. Equally dismissive of the allegations of collusion, Willie Gallagher of the Republican Socialist Movement offered the suggestion that had the INLA not killed Wright, he would have been released from prison shortly afterwards. Once free, Wright would have continued to conduct and orchestrate his murder campaign against nationalists.|$|E
2500|$|May's public reticence {{during the}} {{referendum}} campaign resulted in tensions with David Cameron and his pro-EU team. Following the referendum and her election as party leader, May signalled {{that she would}} support full withdrawal from the EU and prioritise immigration controls over remaining within the single market, leading some to contrast this with her earlier remarks on the earlier economic arguments. She later {{went on to say}} before the 2017 UK general election that she would be willing to leave the EU without a deal, saying that [...] "no deal is better than a bad deal. We <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> walk out". The Lib Dem leader, Tim Farron, said it was [...] "disappointing that Theresa May lacked the political courage to warn the public as she did a bunch of bankers in private about the devastating economic effects of Brexit. More disappointing is that now she is supposedly in charge, she is blithely ignoring her own warnings and is prepared to inflict an act of monumental self-harm on the UK economy by pulling Britain out of the single market." [...] Phil Wilson for the 'Open Britain' group said, [...] "It's good to know that privately Theresa May thinks what many of us have been saying publicly for a long time, leaving the single market would be bad for businesses and for our economy. Now she is prime minister, Theresa May is in an unrivalled position to act on her previous concerns, starting by putting membership of the single market at the heart of her government's negotiating position." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bill Lawry won the toss {{and chose}} to bat {{on a good}} wicket, but became John Snow's 100th Test victim, caught by Alan Knott for 4 off an {{attempted}} hook. Keith Stackpole had been promoted from the middle order to open the innings as along with Lawry {{he was the only}} Australian who had any confidence against short-pitched bowling. He should have been run out for 18, Geoff Boycott throwing down the wicket at the bowler's end with Derek Underwood backing up. The batsman was given {{the benefit of the doubt}} by Lou Rowan, but the Australian newspapers carried photographs the next day showing that he had failed to ground his bat as he crossed the line. This formed a major point of controversy in the media and Rowan's decision was hyperbolically labelled [...] "one of the worst in cricket history". It probably cost England victory as Stackpole went on to make his highest Test score of 207, adding 151 with Ian Chappell (59) and 209 with Doug Walters (112). The new ball was taken in the afternoon, but had to be replaced after five overs due to complaints from Snow and Shuttleworth, though Keith Miller, Ray Lindwall, Bill O'Reilly and Jack Fingleton could find little wrong with it in the press box. Stackpole was told in the afternoon drinks break that he was nearing Bradman's record 187 against England at the Gabba and as a result dug himself in and failed to score for the last half hour of the day, leaving Australian 308/2. John Edrich met a spectator when fielding on the boundary who told him [...] "You're following in your cousin's footsteps you know. I was sitting here [...] and he spent all day chasing the ball along the same piece of grass. He didn't stop much either". A frustrated Snow forced a nervous Walters to dodge three bouncers in a row and was warned by the umpires for intimidation, not for the last time in the series. Stackpole crawled to 200 on the second day, hit Illingworth for six and gave what may have been a catch behind off Snow at 372/3. He was visibly wilting in the heat and gladly took the opportunity to walk with 207 against his name. Australia looked set to make a huge score, but soon after lunch Illingworth threw himself full length to take a spectacular catch at silly mid-on to dismiss Ian Redpath off Derek Underwood (3/101). Keith Dunstan noted that [...] "Underwood is inclined to wear a hole in the pitch by dropping the ball on the same spot...", but his first 236 balls had failed to take a wicket, now [...] "Deadly Derek" [...] took two wickets in four balls; dismissing Sheahan for a duck and Walters for 112 as 418/3 became 421/6. Snow (6/114) ran through the lower order – Jenner, Gleeson and Thomson all failed to score – and Australia were all out for 433. The loss of seven Australian wickets for 15 runs was their worst collapse since Alec Bedser took 14/99 and Australia fell from 237/3 to 249 all out at Trent Bridge in 1953. As commentator Ted Dexter put it 'People say cricket's slow. I always tell them, [...] "You just <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> wait a long time between the thrills"'.|$|E

We have been together so long, I really do know him, I DO know what he is. And I feel I must say it; I feel it would be perfectly DISASTROUS for you to marry him--for you even more than for him.' Hermione lapsed into bitter reverie. 'He is so uncertain, so unstable--he wearies, and then reacts. I couldn't TELL you what his re-actions are. I couldn't TELL you the agony of them. That which he affirms and loves one day--a little latter he turns on it in a fury of destruction. He is never constant, always this awful, dreadful reaction.
