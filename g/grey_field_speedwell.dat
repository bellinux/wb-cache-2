50|$|Veronica polita or Grey Field-speedwell is a {{herbaceous}} {{flowering plant}} {{species in the}} plantain family Plantaginaceae. It has hairy stems, is either prostrate or ascending, with dark green leaves that are one of petiolate, crenate, toothed, rounded, or oval. All flowers are small and bright blue. The plant has solitary axillary peduncles that are shorter or slightly longer than the leaves. It grows in many different continents of the world, including Europe, especially France, western Asia, northern Africa, and North America. Common names include enough chickweed, <b>field</b> <b>speedwell,</b> and yerba gallinera.|$|R

When compared to a <b>grey</b> <b>field</b> the savannah with a fractal dimension of 1. 4 though not statistically significant, yielded a trend toward restoration (t= 1. 737, p=. 091).

40|$|A {{range of}} weed species were grown in all {{combinations}} with four crop species (wheat, barley, bean and oilseed rape) {{under field conditions}} of 1990 - 91. The weeds were ranked {{on the basis of}} their competitive abilities. The degree to which competitive ability was specific to particular combination of crops and weed species was examined. Two indices-crop equivalent and aggressivity were compared to measure the competitive ability of the weeds. Based on aggressivity the ranking order of the weeds for their competitive abilities was, cleavers (Galium aparine L.) > wild oats (Avena fatua L.) > <b>field</b> <b>speedwell</b> (Veronica persica Poir.) > common chickweed (Stellaria media L.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The <b>grey</b> <b>field</b> slug Deroceras reticulatum {{has become}} a pest in no tillage {{sunflower}} (Helianthus annuus L.) and soybean (Glycine max L.) crops in the southeast of Buenos Aires province, Argentina. Ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) are {{an important component of}} the arthropod community in agricultural systems and have the potential to reduce pest populations. We tested the predation capacity of the carabid beetle Scarites anthracinus on Deroceras reticulatum individuals of different body mass (10, 20 and 30 mg) and on their eggs, in a controlled laboratory no-choice assay. We also tested its preference for juvenile slugs and the similarly-sized pillbugs (Armadillidium vulgare), under choice conditions. This beetle preyed upon both eggs and juvenile slugs, with the highest consumption rate on 20 mg body mass individuals. While preferring the pillbug during the first 24 h of the choice test, our results suggest that in field conditions, S. anthracinus might be a natural enemy of D. reticulatum, consuming slug eggs and juveniles of different body mass.
