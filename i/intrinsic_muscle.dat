25|$|Biofeedback {{therapy for}} facial synkinesis aims to {{increase}} the patient’s awareness of the facial muscle posture and movement. Facial muscles contain few to none <b>intrinsic</b> <b>muscle</b> sensory receptors (used for proprioceptive feedback) and additionally they do not span movable joints and so lack joint receptors (another source for proprioceptive feedback). Thus, biofeedback allows the patient to actively sense the motion of their muscles. The two common forms of biofeedback used are electromyographic feedback and mirror feedback. Electromyographic feedback includes visual EMG signals (coming from facial muscle sites displayed to the patient from a computer {{in the form of}} waveform traces) or auditory signals that indicate strength of muscle contraction. The subsequent role of the patient is to control the movement of undesired muscle during volitional movement by incorporating the information perceived through the EMG. While mirror feedback is a much more basic way of providing the patient feedback on muscle movement, studies have shown that both are very effective options for synkinesis/paresis reduction. Biofeedback is commonly coupled to facial retraining techniques to achieve maximal effectiveness.|$|E

5000|$|True flagellomeres are {{connected}} by membranous linkage that permits movement, though the flagellum of [...] "true" [...] insects {{does not have}} any <b>intrinsic</b> <b>muscles.</b> Some other Arthropoda do however have <b>intrinsic</b> <b>muscles</b> throughout the flagellum. Such groups include the Symphyla, Collembola and Diplura. In many true insects, especially the more primitive groups such as Thysanura and Blattodea, the flagellum partly or entirely consists of a flexibly connected string of small ring-shaped annuli. The annuli are not true flagellomeres, and in a given insect species the number of annuli generally is not as consistent as the number of flagellomeres in most species.|$|R

50|$|The {{muscles of}} the hand are the {{skeletal}} muscles responsible for {{the movement of the}} hand and fingers. The {{muscles of the}} hand can be subdivided into two groups: the extrinsic and <b>intrinsic</b> <b>muscle</b> groups. The extrinsic muscle groups are the long flexors and extensors. They are called extrinsic because the muscle belly is located on the forearm. The intrinsic group are the smaller muscles located within the hand itself. The muscles of the hand are innervated by the radial, median, and ulnar nerves from the brachial plexus.|$|E
50|$|In general, ulnar {{neuropathy}} {{will result}} in symptoms in a specific anatomic distribution, affecting the little finger, the ulnar half of the ring finger, {{as well as the}} <b>intrinsic</b> <b>muscles</b> of the hand.|$|R
50|$|A trough is then {{formed at}} the back of the tongue by the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>muscles</b> (XII). The trough obliterates against the hard palate from front to back, forcing the bolus to the back of the tongue.The <b>intrinsic</b> <b>muscles</b> of the tongue (XII) {{contract}} to make a trough (a longitudinal concave fold) {{at the back}} of the tongue. The tongue is then elevated to the roof of the mouth (by the mylohyoid (mylohyoid nerve—V3), genioglossus, styloglossus and hyoglossus (the rest XII)) such that the tongue slopes downwards posteriorly. The contraction of the genioglossus and styloglossus (both XII) also contributes to the formation of the central trough.|$|R
