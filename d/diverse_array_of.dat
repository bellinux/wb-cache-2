More than 44 ligands have been identified in the human genome. A significantly different set of chemokines, however, is found in the mouse genome, suggesting a rapid evolution of the chemokine system in mammalian genomes. Thus, there are lineage and even individual-specific differences in chemokine genes in mammals. Differences in the expression and function between even recently duplicated genes are also evident.

40|$|Abstract. Long-term {{hydrocarbon}} micro-seepages develop <b>diverse</b> <b>arrays</b> <b>of</b> {{chemical and}} mineralogical changes in rocks and soils. We called this change mineral alteration. Mapping this mineral alteration {{is thus a}} potential tool for hydrocarbon exploration.

The feature-oriented principal component selection (FPCS) and band ratio method collaborated together in extracting the abnormal area.

The aim of this study was to identify the changes in gene expression associated with the development of doxorubicin resistance in MCF 7 breast cancer cell line. The doxorubicin resistant MCF 7 cell line was developed by stepwise selection of MCF 7 cells and was tested using the MTT assay. The alterations in gene expression were examined using the real-time based PCR array. The findings showed an up-regulation of many phase I/II metabolizing genes, specifically, the CYP 1 A 1 and the CYP 1 A 2 that were up-regulated by 206 - and 96 -fold respectively. Drug efflux pump genes were also up-regulated profoundly. TOP 2 A was strongly down-regulated by 202 -fold. Many other changes were observed in genes crucial for cell cycle, apoptosis and DNA repair. The findings of this project imply that the development of doxorubicin resistance is a multi-factorial process...|$|R

This approach not only allows practical access to multipotent intermediates, but also enables systematic diversification of skeletal, stereochemical and functional group properties without structural simplification of naturally occurring alkaloids. Three distinct modes of [412] cyclizations and two types of redox-mediated annulations provided divergent access to five skeletally distinct scaffolds involving iboga-, aspidosperma-, andranginine- and ngouniensine-type skeletons and a non-natural variant within six to nine steps from tryptamine. The efficiency of our approach was demonstrated by successful total syntheses of (+/-) -vincadifformine, (+/-) -andranginine and (2) -catharanthine...|$|R

40|$|Abstract To {{evaluate}} {{the performance of}} microsatellites or simple sequence repeats (SSRs) for evolutionary stud-ies in Zea, 46 microsatellite loci originally derived from maize were applied to <b>diverse</b> <b>arrays</b> <b>of</b> populations that represent all the diploid species of Zea and 101 maize inbreds. Although null phenotypes and amplification {{of more than two}} alleles per plant were observed at modest rates, no practical obstacle was encountered for applying maize microsatellites to other Zea species. Sequencing of microsatellite alleles revealed complex patterns of muta-tion including frequent indels in the regions flanking mi-crosatellite repeats. In one case, all variation at a micro-satellite locus came from indels in the flanking region rather than in the repeat motif. Maize microsatellites show great variability within populations and provide a reliable means to measure intraspecific variation. Phylo-geographic relationships of Zea populations were suc-cessfully reconstructed with good resolution using a ge-netic distance based on the infinite allele model, indicat-ing that microsatellite loci are useful in evolutionary studies in Zea. Microsatellite loci show a principal divi-sion between tropical and temperate inbred lines, and group inbreds within these two broad germplasm groups {{in a manner that is}} largely consistent with their known pedigrees...|$|R
5|$|Two life-history {{features}} of amphibians are {{often cited as}} a reason why amphibians are good indicators of environmental health or 'canaries in the coal mine'. Like all amphibians, the long-toed salamander has both an aquatic and terrestrial life transition and semipermeable skin. Since they serve different ecological functions in the water {{than they do in}} land, the loss of one amphibian species is equivalent to the loss of two ecological species. The second notion is that amphibians, such as long-toed salamanders, are more susceptible to the absorption of pollutants because they naturally absorb water and oxygen through their skin. The validity of this special sensitivity to environmental pollutants, however, has been called into question. The problem is more complex, because not all amphibians are equally susceptible to environmental damage because there is such a <b>diverse</b> <b>array</b> <b>of</b> life histories among species.|$|E

40|$|Enzymes {{that can}} {{catalyze}} the macrocyclization of linear peptide substrates {{have long been}} sought {{for the production of}} libraries of structurally diverse scaffolds via combinatorial gene assembly as well as to afford rapid in vivo screening methods. Orbitides are plant ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides (RiPPs) of various sizes and topologies, several of which are shown to be biologically active. The diversity in size and sequence of orbitides suggests that the corresponding macrocyclases may be ideal catalysts for production of cyclic peptides. Here we present the biochemical characterization and crystal structures of the plant enzyme PCY 1 involved in orbitide macrocyclization. These studies demonstrate how the PCY 1 S 9 A protease fold has been adapted for transamidation, rather than hydrolysis, of acyl-enzyme intermediates to yield cyclic products. Notably, PCY 1 uses an unusual strategy in which the cleaved C-terminal follower peptide from the substrate stabilizes the enzyme in a productive conformation to facilitate macrocyclization of the N-terminal fragment. The broad substrate tolerance of PCY 1 can be exploited as a biotechnological tool to generate structurally <b>diverse</b> <b>arrays</b> <b>of</b> macrocycles, including those with nonproteinogenic elements.

We approached this issue by creating a mouse strain in which the coding sequence of green fluorescent protein (GFP) was inserted into the Aire locus in a manner allowing concomitant disruption of functional Aire protein expression. We found that Aire+ (i. e., GFP+) mTECs were the major cell types responsible {{for the expression of}} Aire-dependent TRA genes such as insulin 2 and salivary protein 1, whereas Aire-independent TRA genes such as C-reactive protein and glutamate decarboxylase 67 were expressed from both Aire+ and Aire− mTECs. Remarkably, absence of Aire from mTECs caused morphological changes together with altered distribution of mTECs committed to Aire expression. Furthermore, we found that the numbers of mTECs that express involucrin, a marker for terminal epidermal differentiation, were reduced in Aire-deficient mouse thymus, which was associated with nearly an absence of Hassall's corpuscle-like structures in the medulla. Our results suggest that Aire controls the differentiation program of mTECs, thereby organizing the global mTEC integrity that enables TRA expression from terminally differentiated mTECs in the thymic microenvironment...|$|R
