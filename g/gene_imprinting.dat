Though allele-specific regulation of <b>imprinted</b> <b>genes</b> has been studied for several individual genes in detail, {{little is known about}} their overall tissue-specific expression patterns and interspecies conservation of expression. Results We performed a computational analysis of microarray expression data of <b>imprinted</b> <b>genes</b> in human and mouse placentae and in a variety of adult tissues. For mouse, early embryonic stages were also included. The analysis reveals that <b>imprinted</b> <b>genes</b> are expressed in a broad spectrum of tissues for both species. Overall, the relative tissue-specific expression levels of orthologous <b>imprinted</b> <b>genes</b> in human and mouse are not highly correlated. However, in both species distinctive expression profiles are found in tissues of the endocrine pathways such as adrenal gland, pituitary, pancreas as well as placenta. In mouse, the placental and embryonic expression patterns of <b>imprinted</b> <b>genes</b> are highly similar. Transcription factor binding site (TFBS) prediction reveals correlation of tissue-specific expression patterns and the presence of distinct TFBS signatures in the upstream region of human <b>imprinted</b> <b>genes.</b> Conclusion <b>Imprinted</b> <b>genes</b> are broadly expressed pre- and postnatally and do not exhibit a distinct overall expression pattern when compared to non-imprinted genes. The relative expression of most orthologous gene pairs varies significantly between human and mouse suggesting rapid species-specific changes in gene regulation. Distinct expression profiles of <b>imprinted</b> <b>genes</b> are confined to certain human and mouse hormone producing tissues, and placentae. In contrast to the overall variability, distinct expression profiles and enriched TFBS signatures are found in human and mouse endocrine tissues and placentae.

40|$|Abstract Background In {{contrast}} {{to the majority of}} mammalian <b>genes,</b> <b>imprinted</b> <b>genes</b> are monoallelically expressed with the choice of the active allele depending on its parental origin. Due to their special inheritance patterns, maternally and paternally expressed genes might be under different evolutionary pressure. Here, we aimed at assessing the evolutionary history of <b>imprinted</b> <b>genes.</b> Results In this study, we investigated the conservation of <b>imprinted</b> <b>genes</b> in vertebrate genomes and their exposition to natural selection. In a genome-wide comparison, orthologs of <b>imprinted</b> <b>genes</b> show a stronger divergence on cDNA and protein level in mammals. This pattern is most pronounced for maternally expressed genes in rodents in comparison to their non-rodent orthologs. The divergence is not attributable to increased mutation of CpG positions. It is contrasted by strong conservation of paternally expressed genes in mouse and rat. Interestingly, we found that the early divergence of <b>imprinted</b> <b>genes</b> was accompanied by an unusually strict conservation of their paralogs. Conclusions The apparent degeneration of maternally expressed genes may reflect a relaxation of selective pressure due to counteracting effects on maternal and embryonic fitness. Functional redundancy provided by the presence of highly conserved (non-imprinted) paralogs may have facilitated the divergence. Moreover, intensification of imprinting in modern rodents seems to have shifted the evolutionary fate of <b>imprinted</b> <b>genes</b> towards strong purifying selection. </p...|$|R
40|$|Genomic {{imprinting}} {{is essential}} for normal placental and fetal growth. One theory to explain the evolution of imprinting is the kinship theory (KT), which predicts that genes that are paternally expressed will promote fetal growth, whereas maternally expressed genes will suppress growth. We investigated the expression of <b>imprinted</b> <b>genes</b> using microarray measurements of expression in term placentae. Correlations between birthweight and the expression levels of <b>imprinted</b> <b>genes</b> were more significant than for non-imprinted genes, but did not tend to be positive for paternally expressed genes and negative for maternally expressed <b>genes.</b>   <b>Imprinted</b> <b>genes</b> were more dysregulated in preeclampsia (a disorder associated with placental insufficiency) than randomly selected genes, and we observed an excess of patterns of dysregulation in preeclampsia that would be expected to reduce nutrient allocation to the fetus, given the predictions of the KT.  However, we {{found no evidence of}} coordinated regulation among these imprinted genes.

40|$|<b>Imprinted</b> <b>genes</b> {{have been}} {{extensively}} documented in eutherian mammals and exhibit significant interspecific variation, {{both in the}} suites of <b>genes</b> that are <b>imprinted</b> and in their regulation between tissues and developmental stages. Much less is known about imprinted loci in metatherian (marsupial) mammals, wherein studies have been limited to {{a small number of}} <b>genes</b> <b>imprinted</b> in eutherians. In this dissertation, I used ChIP-seq and RNA-seq approaches to conduct the first ab initio search for <b>imprinted</b> autosomal <b>genes</b> in fibroblasts, fetal brain, and placenta of a metatherian mammal, the gray short-tailed opossum, Monodelphis domestica, and the first chromosome-wide study of paternally imprinted metatherian X chromosome inactivation. Evidence from a few genes in diverse species suggests that metatherian X- chromosome inactivation is characterized by exclusive, but incomplete (leaky), repression of genes on the paternally derived X chromosome. Herein I show that the majority of opossum X-linked <b>genes</b> exhibit paternally <b>imprinted</b> expression with 100 % maternal-allele expression, whereas ~ 14 % of genes escape inactivation, exhibiting varying levels of biallelic expression. In addition, I have shown that transcriptionally opposing histone modifications correlate strongly with opossum XCI. However, the opossum did not show an association between X-linked gene expression and promoter DNA methylation. In generating the first genome-wide profile of histone modification states for a metatherian mammal, and coupling it with in-depth gene expression analyses, I identified the first set of <b>genes</b> <b>imprinted</b> in a metatherian that are not imprinted in eutherian mammals and described transcriptionally opposing histone modifications and differential DNA methylation at the promoters of a subset of these genes. My findings suggest that metatherians use multiple epigenetic mechanisms to mark <b>imprinted</b> <b>genes</b> and support the concept that lineage-specific selective forces can produce sets of <b>imprinted</b> <b>genes</b> that differ between metatherian and eutherian lines. Overall, these studies furnish a comprehensive catalog of parent-of-origin expression status for both autosomal and X-linked genes in a metatherian, Monodelphis domestica, and open new avenues for illuminating the mechanisms and evolution of <b>imprinted</b> <b>gene</b> regulation in mammals generally...|$|R
40|$|Differential {{expression}} of maternally and paternally inherited alleles {{of a gene}} {{is referred to as}} <b>gene</b> <b>imprinting,</b> a form of epigenetic gene regulation common to flowering plants and mammals.

Previously, we demonstrated that widespread DNA demethylation at remnants of transposable elements accompanies endosperm development and that a subset of these methylation changes are associated with <b>gene</b> <b>imprinting.</b> Here we assay imprinted gene expression genome-wide by performing high-throughput sequencing of RNA derived from seeds of reciprocal intraspecific crosses. We identify more than 200 loci that exhibit parent-of-origin effects on gene expression in the endosperm, including a large number of transcription factors, hormone biosynthesis and response genes, and genes that encode regulators of epigenetic information, such as methylcytosine binding proteins, histone methyltransferases, and chromatin remodelers. The majority of these genes are partially, rather than completely, imprinted, suggesting that gene dosage regulation is an important aspect of imprinted gene expression.

Specifically, encoding CD 4 proteins in the endogenous Cd 8 gene locus caused major histocompatibility complex class II-specific thymocytes to express Runx 3 during positive selection and to differentiate into CD 4 + cytotoxic-lineage T cells. Our findings further indicate that coreceptor <b>gene</b> <b>imprinting</b> derives from the dynamic regulation of specific cis Cd 8 gene enhancer elements by positive selection signals in the thymus.

40|$|Active DNA {{demethylation}} {{in plants}} occurs through base excision repair, beginning with removal of methylated cytosine by the ROS 1 /DME subfamily of 5 -methylcytosine DNA glycosylases.

We show that the ape 1 l/zdp double mutant displays embryonic lethality. Notably, the ape 1 l+/ 2 zdp 2 / 2 mutant shows a maternal-effect lethality phenotype.

In plants, imprinting {{occurs in the}} endosperm, which nourishes the embryo during seed development. We have profiled Arabidopsis DNA methylation genome-wide in the embryo and endosperm and found that large-scale methylation changes accompany endosperm development and endosperm-specific gene expression. Transposable element fragments are extensively demethylated in the endosperm. We discovered new imprinted genes by the identification of candidates associated with regions of reduced endosperm methylation and preferential expression in endosperm relative {{to other parts of}} the plant. These data suggest that imprinting in plants evolved from targeted methylation of transposable element insertions near genic regulatory elements followed by positive selection when the resulting expression change was advantageous...|$|E
30|$|Oxidative {{stress is}} an {{important}} mechanism in nanoparticle toxicity, which can trigger DNA damage, inflammation, protein denaturation, and lipid peroxidation [9]. These biological effects {{are influenced by the}} physiochemical properties of nanoparticles, including their size, surface area, shape, surface chemistry, functionalization, and solubility [10, 11]. There is growing evidence that clearly demonstrate exposure to nanoparticles may trigger epigenetic alterations in tissues and cells even at low, non-cytotoxic doses [12, 13]. Epigenetics is the study of heritable changes in gene function that do not involve changes in the DNA sequence including methylation of DNA, <b>gene</b> <b>imprinting,</b> histone modifications, and regulation by non-coding RNAs [14]. Such epigenetic alterations are associated with the development and progression of numerous pathological states and diseases [15]. Therefore, epigenetic effects are a crucial part of patient risk assessment screening at the cellular level.|$|E
40|$|Genomic {{imprinting}} is an epigenetic {{mechanism that}} results in monoallelic expression of genes depending on parent-of-origin of the allele. Although the conservation of genomic imprinting among mammalian species has been widely reported for many genes, there is accumulating evidence that some genes escape this conservation. Most known <b>imprinted</b> <b>genes</b> {{have been identified in}} the mouse and human, with few <b>imprinted</b> <b>genes</b> reported in cattle. Comparative analysis of genomic imprinting across mammalian species would provide a powerful tool for elucidating the mechanisms regulating the unique expression of <b>imprinted</b> <b>genes.</b> In this study we analyzed the <b>imprinting</b> of 22 <b>genes</b> in human, mouse, and cattle and found that in only 11 was imprinting conserved across the three species. In addition, we analyzed the occurrence of the sequence elements CpG islands, C + G content, tandem repeats, and retrotransposable elements in imprinted and in nonimprinted (control) cattle genes. We found that <b>imprinted</b> <b>genes</b> have a higher G + C content and more CpG islands and tandem repeats. Short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs) were notably fewer in number in <b>imprinted</b> cattle <b>genes</b> compared to control genes, which is in agreement with previous reports for human and mouse imprinted regions. Long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs) and long terminal repeats (LTRs) were found to be significantly underrepresented in <b>imprinted</b> <b>genes</b> compared to control genes, contrary to reports on human and mouse. Of considerable significance was the finding of highly conserved tandem repeats in nine of the <b>genes</b> <b>imprinted</b> in all three species...|$|R
40|$|Many <b>imprinted</b> <b>genes</b> are {{necessary}} for normal human development. Approximately 70 <b>imprinted</b> <b>genes</b> {{have been identified in}} humans. I developed a novel approach to identify candidate <b>imprinted</b> <b>genes</b> in humans using the premise that <b>imprinted</b> <b>genes</b> are often associated with nearby parent-of-origin-specific DNA differentially methylated regions (DMRs). I identified parent-of-origin-specific DMRs using sodium bisulfite-based DNA (CpG) methylation profiling of uniparental tissues, mature cystic ovarian teratoma (MCT) and androgenetic complete hydatidiform mole (AnCHM), and biparental tissues, blood and placenta. In support of this approach, the CpG methylation profiling led to the identification of parent-of-origin-specific differentially methylated CpG sites (DMCpGs) in known parent-of-origin-specific DMRs. I found new DMRs for known <b>imprinted</b> <b>genes</b> NAP 1 L 5 and ZNF 597. Most importantly, I discovered many new DMCpGs, which were associated with nearby genes, i. e., candidate <b>imprinted</b> <b>genes.</b> Allelic expression analyses of one candidate <b>imprinted</b> <b>gene,</b> AXL, suggested polymorphic imprinting of AXL in human blood. iii Acknowledgments I would like to acknowledge my supervisor, Dr. Rosanna Weksberg, for her guidance, encouragement, and patience.

40|$|Abstract- We use the {{self-organizing}} map (SOM) to detect novel <b>imprinted</b> <b>genes</b> in A. thaliana from microarray gene expression measurements in several interploidy and mutant A. thaliana crosses. In sexually reproducing organisms, the transcription of the maternally {{as well as}} the paternally inherited alleles of a gene is the rule. <b>Imprinted</b> <b>genes</b> are an exception to this rule. Their number is relatively small, but they are often involved in the regulation of growth, particularly seed growth in plants. Only five genes are known to be imprinted in A. thaliana, but given that many more are known in other species, A. thaliana likely harbors additional <b>imprinted</b> <b>genes.</b> The {{self-organizing map}} is a suitable tool for the identification of novel <b>imprinted</b> <b>genes.</b> The map projections of known <b>imprinted</b> <b>genes</b> yield sets of genes with similar expression profiles that are probable candidates for <b>imprinting.</b> Assuming a <b>gene</b> is <b>imprinted,</b> the its expression measurements across the different crosses are expected to follow a certain order. The number of deviations from this expected order provide a means to rank the SOM-generated candidates and thus, to prioritize their verification in the laboratory...|$|R
