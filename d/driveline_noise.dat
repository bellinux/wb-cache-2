The definitive version is available at: [URL] drivelines with manual transmissions are exposed to different dynamic engine torques under driving conditions. Engine torque can dramatically vary with throttle demand from coast to drive condition and, conversely, with throttle release from drive to coast. Abrupt application or release of throttle in slow moving traffic or rapid engagement of the clutch can be followed by an audible response, referred to in industry as the clonk noise. This paper presents a complete dynamic model of a vehicle driveline for the optimization of high-frequency torsional vibration by the distributed-lumped (hybrid) modelling technique (DLMT). The model used is first validated against experimental tests. Parameter sensitivity studies have been carried out using the model to identify the important components affecting clonk. Three key parameters have been chosen from the parameter study. To optimize these key factors, genetic algorithms (GAs) have been used in this multi-parameter optimization problem. The GAs show significant reduction in the <b>driveline</b> <b>noise,</b> vibration and harshness (NVH) ...|$|E
40|$|The “gear rattle” {{phenomenon}} {{is a research}} topic of great interest for the NVH (Noise, Vibration and Harshness) automotive sector, concerning <b>driveline</b> <b>noise</b> and vibrations coming from the manual gear boxes. It {{is due to the}} internal combustion engine variable torque producing impacts and rebounds, and consequently noise, between the teeth of the unloaded gear pairs of the gear box because of the unavoidable presence of backlashes. Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is used to decompose the angular relative motion signal and the wavelet decomposition details are adopted to analyze the dynamic behaviour of gears under rattle conditions. The DWT has been chosen because it is a particularly suitable instrument to recognize discontinuities, such as jumps or instantaneous changes in the slope of the signals, due to their localization in the time domain. Wavelet analysis allows to characterize an event by the localization, the kind, and the amplitude of the event. This technique enables, moreover, to define new indices for metrics of gear rattle especially useful in order to conduct comparisons among different operative conditions. Some examples of application of the proposed technique are reported in the paper. The theoretical investigations regard comparative analysis with respect to the amplitude and to the frequency of speed fluctuations and to the gears lubrication regime...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — in {{the present}} paper, main purpose is to improve {{passenger}} car pre damper clutch spring’s stiffness coefficient {{in order to gain}} more performance under dynamical and vibrational analysis in engine at idle working. So, to achieve this purpose, an angular velocity that is related to the engine idle working which estimated 850 rpm and completely sinusoidal as input to clutch system and output angular velocity of input shaft to gearbox is assumed as output of MSC. ADAMS software to analyze system with various parameters. For this order, results as angular velocity and acceleration versus time for input shaft to gearbox reported, which investigated in initial turbulences that was from initial impacts of engine start up process and so converge of engine vibrations observed. Furthermore, investigated pre damper spring’s stiffness constant as an efficient parameter in clutch operations, angular velocity and acceleration of gearbox input shaft’s feedback, one of the main effective parameters of <b>driveline’s</b> <b>noise</b> and vibration studied. Finally, results have been compared to establish best pre damper spring’s stiffness constant equal to 25 n/mm in mounted spring under real work and environmental conditions. Therefore, Sensitivity analysis is performed to validation of obtained results...|$|R
