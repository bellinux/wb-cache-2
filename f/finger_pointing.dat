He dons the rugged habit of the pioneer Dominican missionaries. His right hand is elevated in the preaching fashion, his index <b>finger</b> <b>pointing</b> to heavens. His left hand rests on his chest holding a book bearing the words Santo Evangélico on its cover. A skull cap covers his head, and a pectoral cross hangs from his neck, the symbols of Episcopal dignity.|$|E
25|$|Also {{at about}} this time, John C. Bennett {{reported}} that Smith had offered a cash reward {{to anyone who}} would assassinate Boggs, and that Smith had admitted to him that Rockwell had done the deed. He {{went on to say}} that Rockwell had made a veiled threat against Bennett's life if he publicized the story. Joseph Smith vehemently denied Bennett's account, speculating that Boggs — no longer governor, but campaigning for state senate — was attacked by an election opponent. Mormon writer Monte B. McLaws, in the Missouri Historical Review, supported Smith, averring that while there was no clear <b>finger</b> <b>pointing</b> to anyone, Governor Boggs was running for election against several violent men, all capable of the deed, and that there was no particular reason to suspect Rockwell of the crime. This opinion was not shared by Rockwell's most noted biographer, Harold Schindler. Whatever the case, the following year Rockwell was arrested, tried, and acquitted of the attempted murder (Bushman, p.468), although most of Boggs' contemporaries remained convinced of his guilt.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with the Sheffield University Paper in May 1965, Dylan explained the change that had occurred in his songwriting over the previous twelve months, noting [...] "The big difference is that the songs I was writing last year ... they were what I call one-dimensional songs, but my new songs I'm trying to make more three-dimensional, you know, there's more symbolism, they're written on more than one level." [...] In late 1965, Dylan commented on the writing of [...] "My Back Pages" [...] specifically during {{an interview}} with Margaret Steen for The Toronto Star: [...] "I was in my New York phase then, or at least, I was just coming out of it. I was still keeping the things that are really really real out of my songs, for fear they'd be misunderstood. Now I don't care if they are." [...] As Dylan stated to Nat Hentoff at the time that [...] "My Back Pages" [...] and the other songs on Another Side of Bob Dylan were written, [...] "There aren't any <b>finger</b> <b>pointing</b> songs ... Now {{a lot of people are}} doing <b>finger</b> <b>pointing</b> songs. [...] You know, pointing to all the things that are wrong. [...] Me, I don't want to write for people anymore. You know, be a spokesman." ...|$|E
25|$|The diagram to {{the left}} shows a BA-hand (flat hand) in six orientations. For the three {{vertical}} orientations on the left side, the hand is held {{in front of the}} signer, <b>fingers</b> <b>pointing</b> upward. All three glyphs can be rotated, like the hands of a clock, to show the <b>fingers</b> <b>pointing</b> at an angle, to the side, or downward. For the three horizontal orientations {{on the right side of}} the diagram, the hand is held outward, with the <b>fingers</b> <b>pointing</b> away from the signer, and presumably toward the viewer. They can also be rotated to show the <b>fingers</b> <b>pointing</b> to the side or toward the signer. Although an indefinite number of orientations can be represented this way, in practice only eight are used for each plane—that is, only multiples of 45° are found.|$|R

Schneier wrote, [...] "Almost no one looked beyond the <b>finger</b> <b>pointing</b> and jeering to discuss exactly why the Boston authorities overreacted so badly. They overreacted because the signs were weird." [...] Schneier characterized this {{as a form of}} [...] "Cover Your Ass" [...] security.|$|E

ISIL has also attempted to present a more [...] "rational argument" [...] {{in a series of}} videos hosted by the kidnapped journalist John Cantlie.

2500|$|This {{version has}} been {{somewhat}} controversial, as Mamet chose to film it as a realist piece: the scene takes place in an actual theatre, and the principals are dressed as a director and his assistant might look. “When the director (D) made his peremptory demands for light from his female assistant (A) he received it not for his cigar, as in the original, but {{in the form of}} torchlight for his script. This weakened the sense of gratuitous offensiveness hanging about the character. D., played by Pinter, received rather too much camera attention and a patient John Gielgud rather too little, above all at the final moment” when he raises his head in defiance. Some critics have argued that this interpretation takes away from the tyrannical theme of the play.Mamet also changes Beckett's stage [...] direction concerning the Protagonist's hands substituting a <b>finger</b> <b>pointing</b> for the hands joined.|$|E

Everyone holding his breath. I have always believed that Roose grew to his full height as a man in the purgatorial crisis of a penalty, drying off the clay around his feet, washing away the dross which entered his character with the gold...

Then came the signal; the ball travelled like a bolt from the foot of the penalty taking forward, and in the blink of an eyelid, revolution, a thump, and the ball landed in the heather and gorse of the Buarth." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{striking}} exterior {{design of}} A, which designer Starck had likened to being [...] "more {{like a fish}} than a building", polarized opinions from the outset. Jonathan Beckett, chief executive of London yacht brokers Burgess, was initially skeptical, but changed his mind after seeing the boat in person in the Caribbean: [...] "I have to say I was impressed. It's a very exciting boat to watch. It's simply unlike anything that's ever been done before." [...] David Pelly of Boat International was also enamoured, saying she was [...] "...the most extraordinary yacht launched in recent memory. It is stunning." [...] And writing about the world's biggest mega yachts in the New York Times in 2011, Nazanin Lankarini argued that A was [...] "even more desirable than her larger sisters by virtue of lines reminiscent of a nuclear submarine". A {{was one of the}} featured vessels in the 2011 edition of The Superyachts, where she was described as [...] "bold and eccentric."By contrast, Power & Motoryacht magazine columnist Diane Byrne opined that [...] "overall she does not float my boat (sorry, kids, couldn’t resist), but I do quite like the inverted bow design", while Donald Starkey, a British yacht designer, commented that A [...] "...is aggressive, like a giant <b>finger</b> <b>pointing</b> at you. It seems to {{have nothing to do with}} the whole idea of yachting, which is about cruising around at a leisurely pace, and enjoying your friends and the sea". Maritime commentator Peter Mello was even more scathing in his assessment, deriding her as [...] "one of the most hideous vessels ever to sail the seas". The Wall Street Journals Robert Frank was initially also an outspoken critic, calling A [...] "one of the ghastliest megayachts ever created" [...] and [...] "more like a cruiser for Darth Vader's navy than a family pleasure boat for the Mediterranean" [...] when she was launched. However, in a follow-up blog several months later, he confessed: [...] "I've gained a bit more respect for it. Technically, it's impressive: Because of her inverted bow, the boat barely makes a splash in the front when it's speeding along at 24knots. And it's different in a way few yachts are...So even though I still think it's a monster, A gets a tip of the hat for taking a risk and being different".|$|E
