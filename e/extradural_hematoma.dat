5000|$|A hematoma is a {{localized}} {{collection of}} blood that gathers outside the blood vessels in an area it does not belong. [...] Specifically a hematoma is tissue damage due to acceleration or deceleration from unrestricted movement, in which the result is shearing of the brain tissue. [...] Two types of hematomas occurring within the brain are: subdural and extradural hematomas, which are classified as a traumatic brain injury (TBI). When a direct {{blow to the head}} occurs, there is bruising to the brain and damage to the internal tissue and blood vessels. Additionally, the jarring of the brain against the skull causes hematomas. [...] Injuries commonly occur during contact sport such as boxing, football, basketball, motor cycling, scuba diving, mountaineering, hang gliding, skydiving, and horseback riding.

40|$|Background: Arachnoid cysts are {{congenital}} or developmental intra-arachnoidal CSF-filled lesions, which develop {{probably as}} a result of splitting or duplication of the arachnoid membrane. Most of them are asymptomatic and are detected as incidental findings on Computed Tomography or Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the head carried out for other reasons. Although complications such as intracystic, subdural, and <b>extradural</b> <b>hematomas</b> are well known after a trauma, spontaneous hemorrhage in an arachnoid cyst is a rare and serious complication with atypical imaging features on cross-sectional imaging and only less than ten cases are documented in the literature till date, with none of them in the suprasellar location. Case Report: A 40 -year-old female patient presented with history of headache since two months, which was sudden in onset, holocranial. Conclusions: Spontaneous intracystic hemorrhage is an uncommon and serious complication of arachnoid cysts, which can give rise to atypical features on imaging. Therefore familiarity with this rare complication is indeed essential...|$|R
30|$|The urgency for CT {{scanning}} {{is governed}} by the dynamic evolution of intracranial hemorrhage. <b>Extradural</b> <b>hematomas</b> require more than one hour to become space occupying. However, in the second hour they become space occupying and mortality increases with the increasing time interval between TBI and CT scan. Space-occupying subdural hemorrhage can appear anytime during the clinical course and can reach substantial size. The earlier they appear, the accompanying collateral damage to the brain and mortality increases. Since space-occupying subdural hematomas, which appear during the first hour, have a mortality of 88 % despite immediate operative treatment, only few patients profit from early diagnosis. From these observations it follows that a CT scan should be performed within the first hour after trauma. Since comatose patients cannot report additional injuries, multiple injuries must always be suspected. Bleeding into the major body cavities, thorax and abdomen should be identified or ruled out immediately. Therefore, comatose patients should always be admitted only to hospitals that offer competent neurosurgical care of intracranial injuries as well as care to injuries to abdomen, thorax, facial skull, and extremities.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Bilateral <b>extradural</b> <b>hematomas</b> {{have only}} rarely been {{reported}} in the literature. Even rarer are cases where the hematomas develop sequentially, one after removal of the other. Among 187 cases of operated epidural hematomas during past 4 years in our hospital, we found one case of sequentially developed bilateral epidural hematoma. Case Presentation An 18 -year-old conscious male worker was admitted to our hospital after a fall. After deterioration of his consciousness, an emergency brain CT scan showed a right temporoparietal epidural hematoma. The hematoma was evacuated, but the patient did not improve afterwards. Another CT scan showed contralateral epidural hematoma and the patient was reoperated. Postoperatively, the patient recovered completely. Conclusions This case underlines the need for monitoring after an operation for an epidural hematoma and the need for repeat brain CT scans if the patient does not recover quickly after removal of the hematoma, especially if the first CT scan has been done less than 6 hours after the trauma. Intraoperative brain swelling can be considered as a clue for the development of contralateral hematoma. </p...|$|R

50|$|Head {{injuries}} {{include both}} injuries {{to the brain}} and those {{to other parts of}} the head, such as the scalp and skull. Head injuries can be closed or open. A closed (non-missile) head injury is where the dura mater remains intact. The skull can be fractured, but not necessarily. A penetrating head injury occurs when an object pierces the skull and breaches the dura mater. Brain injuries may be diffuse, occurring over a wide area, or focal, located in a small, specific area. A head injury may cause skull fracture, which may or may not be associated with injury to the brain. Some patients may have linear or depressed skull fractures.If intracranial hemorrhage occurs, a hematoma within the skull can put pressure on the brain. Types of intracranial hemorrage include subdural, subarachnoid, <b>extradural,</b> and intraparenchymal <b>hematoma.</b> Craniotomy surgeries are used in these cases to lessen the pressure by draining off blood.|$|R

40|$|Intraparenchymal hemorrhages {{occur in}} a {{proportion}} of severe traumatic brain injury TBI patients, but the role of surgery in their treatment is unclear. This international multi-center, patient-randomized, parallel-group trial compared early surgery (hematoma evacuation within 12 h of randomization) with initial conservative treatment (subsequent evacuation allowed if deemed necessary). Patients were randomized using an independent randomization service within 48 h of TBI. Patients were eligible if they had {{no more than two}} intraparenchymal hemorrhages of 10 mL or more and did not have an <b>extradural</b> or subdural <b>hematoma</b> that required surgery. The primary outcome measure was the traditional dichotomous split of the Glasgow Outcome Scale obtained by postal questionnaires sent directly to patients at 6 months. The trial was halted early by the UK funding agency (NIHR HTA) for failure to recruit sufficient patients from the UK (trial regis-tration: ISRCTN 19321911). A total of 170 patients were randomized from 31 of 59 registered centers worldwide. Of 82 patients randomized to early surgery with complete follow-up, 30 (37 %) had an unfavorable outcome. Of 85 patients randomized to initial conservative treatment with complete follow-up, 40 (47 %) had an unfavorable outcome (odds ratio, 0. 65; 95 % confidence interval, CI 0. 35, 1. 21; p = 0. 17), with an absolute benefit of 10. 5 % (CI,- 4. 4 – 25. 3 %). There were significantly more deaths in the first 6 months in the initial conservative treatment group (33 % vs. 15 %; p = 0. 006). The 10. 5 % absolute benefit with early surgery was consistent with the initial power calculation. However, with the low sample size resulting from the premature termination, we cannot exclude the possibility that this could be a chance finding. A further trial is required urgently to assess whether this encouraging signal can be confirmed.
