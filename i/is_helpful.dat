5|$|All whales have a {{thick layer}} of blubber. In species that live near the poles, the blubber can be as thick as 11 inches. This blubber can help with {{buoyancy}} (which <b>is</b> <b>helpful</b> for a 100-ton whale), protection to some extent as predators {{would have a hard time}} getting through {{a thick layer}} of fat, and energy for fasting when migrating to the equator; the primary usage for blubber is insulation from the harsh climate. It can constitute as much as 50% of a whale's body weight. Calves are born with only a thin layer of blubber, but some species compensate for this with thick lanugos.|$|E

5|$|Although the inflorescences of Banksia aquilonia {{are similar}} to B.integrifolia, the leaves are marked in their differences—the midrib on the leaves' undersides is distinctively covered in short reddish-brown hairs and the leaves are spirally {{arranged}} on the branches rather than in whorls as in all B.integrifolia subspecies. It was these differences that George felt were distinctive enough {{for it to be}} separate it as a full species from B. integrifolia. The overall habit of a Banksia aquilonia tree resembles that of B.integrifolia, though is generally smaller. The southernmost populations of B.aquilonia are separated from the northernmost B.integrifolia occurrence by , hence location <b>is</b> <b>helpful</b> in identification.|$|E
5|$|Recommendation #6: The roles, responsibilities, and {{authorities}} of local, state, and tribal governments (with respect to facility siting {{and other aspects}} of nuclear waste disposal) must be an element of the negotiation between {{the federal government and the}} other affected units of government in establishing a disposal facility. In addition to legally-binding agreements, as discussed in Recommendation #4, all affected levels of government (local, state, tribal, etc.) must have, at a minimum, a meaningful consultative role in all other important decisions. Additionally, states and tribes should retain—or where appropriate, be delegated—direct authority over aspects of regulation, permitting, and operations where oversight below the federal level can be exercised effectively and in a way that <b>is</b> <b>helpful</b> in protecting the interests and gaining the confidence of affected communities and citizens.|$|E
5|$|Securely {{attached}} {{children are}} {{best able to}} explore when they have the knowledge of a secure base (their caregiver) to return to in times of need. When assistance is given, this bolsters the sense of security and also, assuming the parent's assistance <b>is</b> <b>helpful,</b> educates the child in {{how to cope with}} the same problem in the future. Therefore, secure attachment {{can be seen as the}} most adaptive attachment style. According to some psychological researchers, a child becomes securely attached when the parent is available and able to meet the needs of the child in a responsive and appropriate manner. At infancy and early childhood, if parents are caring and attentive towards their children, those children will be more prone to secure attachment.|$|E

5|$|The Gaussian {{integers}} {{are complex}} {{numbers of the}} form α=u+vi, where u and v are ordinary integers and i is the square root of negative one. By defining an analog of the Euclidean algorithm, Gaussian integers can {{be shown to be}} uniquely factorizable, by the argument above. This unique factorization <b>is</b> <b>helpful</b> in many applications, such as deriving all Pythagorean triples or proving Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares. In general, the Euclidean algorithm is convenient in such applications, but not essential; for example, the theorems can often be proven by other arguments.|$|E
5|$|The {{next most}} common use is {{as an aid}} for smoking cessation. Bupropion reduces the {{severity}} of nicotine cravings and withdrawal symptoms. Bupropion <b>is</b> <b>helpful</b> for smoking cessation in smokers with no history of depression; thus, the effectiveness of bupropion is not due to its antidepressant effect. A typical bupropion treatment course lasts up to twelve weeks, with people halting the use of tobacco about ten days into the course. Bupropion approximately doubles the chance of quitting smoking successfully. The effectiveness of bupropion is comparable to nicotine replacement therapy, but less effective than varenicline.|$|E
5|$|While the North and South {{magnetic}} poles are usually {{located near the}} geographic poles, they can wander widely over geological time scales, but sufficiently slowly for ordinary compasses to remain useful for navigation. However, at irregular intervals averaging several hundred thousand years, the Earth's field reverses and the North and South Magnetic Poles relatively abruptly switch places. These reversals of the geo{{magnetic poles}} leave a record in rocks that are of value to paleomagnetists in calculating geomagnetic fields in the past. Such information in turn <b>is</b> <b>helpful</b> in studying the motions of continents and ocean floors {{in the process of}} plate tectonics.|$|E

5|$|Another {{definition}} of the GCD <b>is</b> <b>helpful</b> in advanced mathematics, particularly ring theory. The greatest common divisor g of two nonzero numbers a and b is also their smallest positive integral linear combination, that is, the smallest positive number of the form ua+vb where u and v are integers. The set of all integral linear combinations of a and b is actually {{the same as the}} set of all multiples of g (mg, where m is an integer). In modern mathematical language, the ideal generated by a and b is the ideal generated byg alone (an ideal generated by a single element is called a principal ideal, and all ideals of the integers are principal ideals). Some properties of the GCD are in fact easier to see with this description, for instance the fact that any common divisor of a and b also divides the GCD (it divides both terms of ua+vb). The equivalence of this GCD definition with the other definitions is described below.|$|E
5|$|Males {{are also}} {{affected}} by societal expectations, such as notions about masculinity and sexual prowess. Men from some traditional backgrounds may feel performance pressure {{that emphasizes the}} ability to have erections and sexual intercourse. Men who have strong sexual desire but who {{are not able to}} perform sexually may be at increased risk for depression, particularly when they believe strongly in traditional masculine gender norms with sexual function as core to the male identity. Men who strongly believe in these traditional roles may feel sexually inadequate, unmanly, insecure, and less satisfied with life. Since sexual dysfunction has this negative impact on self-esteem, treatment of erectile dysfunction can have a psychological benefit even though it does not help with physical sensation. SCI may necessitate reappraisal and rejection of assumptions about gender norms and sexual function in order to adjust healthily to the disability: those who are able to change the way they think about gender roles may have better life satisfaction and outcomes with rehabilitation. Counseling <b>is</b> <b>helpful</b> in this reassessment process.|$|E
5|$|Neuroimaging <b>is</b> <b>helpful</b> but not {{flawless}} {{in detecting}} raised ICP. A more accurate {{way to measure}} ICP is to place a catheter into a ventricle of the brain, which has {{the added benefit of}} allowing cerebrospinal fluid to drain, releasing pressure in the skull. Treatment of raised ICP may be as simple as tilting the patient's bed and straightening the head to promote blood flow through the veins of the neck. Sedatives, analgesics and paralytic agents are often used. Hypertonic saline can improve ICP by reducing the amount of cerebral water (swelling), though it is used with caution to avoid electrolyte imbalances or heart failure. Mannitol, an osmotic diuretic, appears to be equally effective at reducing ICP. Some concerns; however, have been raised regarding some of the studies performed. Diuretics, drugs that increase urine output to reduce excessive fluid in the system, may be used to treat high intracranial pressures, but may cause hypovolemia (insufficient blood volume). Hyperventilation (larger and/or faster breaths) reduces carbon dioxide levels and causes blood vessels to constrict; this decreases blood flow to the brain and reduces ICP, but it potentially causes ischemia and is, therefore, used only in the short term. Administration of corticosteroids is associated with an increased risk of death, and so it is recommended that they not be given routinely.|$|E
