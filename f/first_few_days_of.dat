5|$|A new ergate {{spends the}} <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> its adult life {{caring for the}} queen and young. She then {{graduates}} to digging and other nest work, and later to defending the nest and foraging. These changes are sometimes fairly sudden, and define what are called temporal castes. An explanation for the sequence {{is suggested by the}} high casualties involved in foraging, making it an acceptable risk only for ants who are older and are likely to die soon of natural causes.|$|E
5|$|Painful {{cramping}} in the abdomen, back, or upper thighs {{is common}} during the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> menstruation. Severe uterine pain during menstruation {{is known as}} dysmenorrhea, and it is most common among adolescents and younger women (affecting about 67.2% of adolescent females). When menstruation begins, symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) such as breast tenderness and irritability generally decrease. Many sanitary products are marketed to women for use during their menstruation.|$|E

5|$|It is {{not known}} whether pterosaurs practiced any form of parental care, but their ability to fly {{as soon as they}} emerged from the egg and the {{numerous}} flaplings found in environments far from nests and alongside adults has led most researchers, including Christopher Bennett and David Unwin, to conclude that the young were dependent on their parents for {{a relatively short period of}} time, during a period of rapid growth while the wings grew long enough to fly, and then left the nest to fend for themselves, possibly within days of hatching. Alternatively, they may have used stored yolk products for nourishment during their <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> life, as in modern reptiles, rather than depend on parents for food.|$|E
5|$|The 32nd Infantry Division Triglavski was a Royal Yugoslav Army {{infantry}} formation raised {{prior to}} the German-led Axis invasion of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in April 1941. It formed part of the Yugoslav 7th Army, and was deployed southwest of Ljubljana in the Julian Alps, along the western border with Italy from Bičke north to Mount Blegoš. It was not heavily engaged during the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> the invasion, but from 9 April it withdrew steadily due to withdrawals on its flanks and {{in the face of}} the advancing German XLIX Mountain Corps. Encircled by the 14th Panzer Division linking up with Italian thrusts further west, it surrendered on 12 April.|$|E
60|$|The {{progress}} of the party was but slow for the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>days.</b> Some <b>of</b> the men were indisposed; Mr. Crooks, especially, was so unwell {{that he could not}} keep on his horse. A rude kind of litter was, therefore, prepared for him, consisting of two long poles, fixed, one on each side of two horses, with a matting between them, on which he reclined at full length, and was protected from the sun by a canopy of boughs.|$|R

The Indians had some disagreements among themselves concerning the disposition of the captives, which at times threatened to come to blows. A council held {{on the third day}} resolved these disagreements sufficiently that the trek could continue.|$|R
50|$|Five {{days were}} spent at Cape Town {{repairing}} Mystery and replenishing supplies. They had made such {{good time to}} Cape Town that the Royal Mail commissioned them to take post on to Australia. For the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> out <b>of</b> Cape Town the weather was bad, but Mystery was unscathed. Further gales were encountered on 18 and 23 February and 3 March. Cape Northumberland was sighted on 9 March and Mystery reached Melbourne on 14 March 1855 after a journey of 11800 nmi km. Mystery remained in Australia, where she {{was used as a}} pilot cutter. On 26 March 1869, she was wrecked in Keppel Bay, Rockhampton, Queensland. All crew were saved.|$|R
5|$|The besieging force outnumbered the JNA {{garrison}} in Varaždin, {{which was}} divided among several barracks, storage depots and other facilities, but the JNA possessed substantially greater firepower. The balance shifted {{in favour of}} the Croatian forces after smaller JNA posts were captured in the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> the siege, until only one barracks along with {{the headquarters of the}} JNA 32nd Corps remained under JNA control. At that point, the commander of the 32nd Corps, Major General Vladimir Trifunović, and the civilian authorities in Varaždin agreed that the remaining JNA forces in the city would surrender, but all those wishing to leave would be permitted to do so, leaving their weapons behind.|$|E
5|$|Although American {{units were}} usually able to {{replenish}} their numbers quickly, the replacements rarely had sufficient tactical training. Many junior officers were short on tactical and leadership abilities. Some tankers were shipped to Europe without {{having so much}} as driven a car before; some tank commanders were forced to teach their men how to load and fire their tank guns in the field prior to missions. The American replacement system, which focused on quantity over quality, ensured {{that the majority of}} fresh troops reaching the front lines were not properly trained for combat. It was not unusual for half of a unit's replacements to become casualties within the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> combat. These tremendous frontline losses required ever-more troops to be fed into the fighting; for instance, a freshly reinforced battalion of the US 28th Infantry Division was immediately thrown into direct assaults against Aachen to buttress the depleted US 1st Infantry Division during the final stages of the battle on 18–21 October.|$|E
5|$|Continuing {{search and}} rescue efforts for {{thirteen}} people who were listed as missing through May 7 were assisted by urban {{search and rescue}} dogs from across the country. Nearly 1,000 members of the Oklahoma National Guard were deployed throughout the affected region. The American Red Cross had set up ten mobile feeding stations by this time and stated that 30 more were en route. On May 8, a disaster recovery center was opened in Moore for individuals recovering from the tornadoes. According to the Army Corps of Engineers, roughly 500,000 cubic yards (382,277 cubic meters) of debris was left behind and would likely take weeks to clear. Within the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> the disaster declaration, relief funds began being sent to families who requested aid. By May 9, roughly $180,000 had been approved by FEMA for disaster housing assistance.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe January effect {{implies that}} small firms {{experience}} large returns in January and exceptionally large returns during the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> trading <b>days</b> <b>of</b> January. This paper examines the January effect {{pattern on the}} Romanian stock market. The observation period was divided into sub–periods: January 2003 – December 2007 (before crisis) and January 2008 – December 2010 (during crisis). We found that the January effect occurs before the financial crisis, but during the crisis the effect had been observed as being present only for the third portfolio (which contains the companies that have the smallest capitalization value). The observation of this effect can help the investors to establish a profitable investment strategy...|$|R

5|$|During June1966, low {{atmospheric}} pressure {{stretched across the}} western Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexicoa pattern that is conducive for tropical cyclogenesis. During the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> the month, a dissipating trough extended from the southeastern United States into the western Caribbean. A mid-level circulation developed along the trough near Cabo Gracias a Dios on June3. By the next day, the circulation had reached the surface, which marked {{the development of a}} tropical depression over eastern Nicaragua. On June 5, the depression crossed Honduras and emerged into the western Caribbean, moving north-northeastward through an area of warm sea surface temperatures. It had a good cyclonic circulation, convection, and moisture content, but most significantly, a passing trough to the north provided the depression with favorable outflow. On June 6, the depression rapidly intensified into Tropical Storm and later Hurricane Alma. This made it the earliest hurricane in the basin since Hurricane Able in 1951.|$|E
5|$|During the German-led Axis {{invasion}} of Yugoslavia in April 1941, Sava {{served with the}} 1st Monitor Division. Along with her fellow monitor , she laid mines in the Danube near the Romanian border during the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> the invasion. The two monitors fought off several attacks by the Luftwaffe, but were forced to withdraw to Belgrade. Due to high river levels and low bridges, navigation was difficult, and Sava was scuttled on 11 April. Some of her crew tried to escape cross-country towards the southern Adriatic coast, but all were captured prior to the Yugoslav surrender. The vessel was later raised by the navy of the Axis puppet state known as the Independent State of Croatia and continued to serve as Sava until the night of 8 September 1944 when she was again scuttled.|$|E

The two monitors fought off several attacks by the Luftwaffe, but were forced to withdraw to Belgrade. Due to high river levels and low bridges, the monitors' navigation was difficult, and they were scuttled by their crews on 11 April. Some of her crew may have been killed when a demolished bridge collapsed onto a tugboat after they abandoned ship. A number tried to escape cross-country towards the southern Adriatic coast, but most were obliged to surrender to the Germans at Sarajevo on 14 April.

5|$|Early on June17, the JTWC {{issued a}} second TCFA {{as the system}} {{continued}} to organize. By this time the system was nearly stationary and at 0600UTC, the JMA declared that the low had developed into a tropical depression. Several hours later, the JTWC designated the system as Tropical Depression 03W while the storm was situated about 705km (440mi) south-southwest of Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Little movement took place for the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> the storm's existence as weak steering currents were in place over the South China Sea. Following further development of the depression, the JTWC upgraded it to a tropical storm late on June17. At 0600UTC on June18, the JMA classified {{the system as a}} tropical storm and gave it the name Linfa. Limited poleward outflow hindered intensification for the remainder of June18. By this time, the storm began to increase in forward motion due to a strengthening subtropical ridge located east of Taiwan and a mid-latitude trough to the west.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> September 2002, an upper-level trough {{emerged in}} the Gulf of Mexico and stalled. Thunderstorms {{developed}} along the trough and concentrated around a weak low pressure system. Gradually, the trough and associated low pressure drifted south into the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico. A low pressure area in the northwest Gulf of Mexico became the dominant circulation and slowly developed persistent convection near the center. On September 5, a reconnaissance aircraft investigated the system. During the flight, a low-level center became evident and some deep convection persisted; as a result, it was classified as a tropical depression. Wind shear within the Gulf of Mexico was weak and remained favorable to tropical cyclone formation. A reconnaissance flight later that day discovered an ill-defined circulation which led to low confidence of {{the location of the}} center of circulation. However, enough convection persisted for the depression to be upgraded into Tropical Storm Fay that evening.|$|E
5|$|On 19 September, the ZNG {{clashed with}} the JNA {{garrison}} at the Logorište barracks in Karlovac, captured a communications facility at Platak near Rijeka an additional JNA barracks and a storage depot in Varaždin, restricting the JNA to the barracks housing headquarters of the JNA Varaždin Corps. By 20 September, when the JNA launched a campaign against the ZNG throughout Croatia, more than 60 JNA facilities in Croatiaincluding 15 barracks and 11 storage depotshad surrendered or were captured. The JNA barracks in Našice surrendered on 21 September. The JNA Varaždin Corps surrendered the next day, providing the ZNG with a major caché of weapons.

40|$|Background Neonatal {{respiratory}} distress is one {{the most}} common problems in the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> neonatal life. The present study intended to determine {{the frequency of the}} causes and outcomes of respiratory distress in neonates hospitalized in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in Hamadan city, Iran. Materials and Methods In this descriptive and cross-sectional study, all the neonates with respiratory distress (RD), who were hospitalized in the NICU of Be’sat Hospital in Hamedan city, Iran, during 2014 to 2015, entered the study. The required demographic information was extracted from patients’ dossiers. The collected data were analyzed using SPSS version 16. 0. Results The mean neonatal age upon admission, mean gestational age and mean birth weight were 5. 22 ± 7. 18 days, 36. 58 ± 3. 54 weeks and 2743. 9 ± 727. 9 grams, respectively. According to the results, intercostal retraction (75. 3 %), tachypnea (67. 7 %), and grunting (61. 3 %) were {{the most common}} symptoms of neonatal respiratory distress (NRD), while respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) (36. 6 %), pneumonia (30. 1 %), and transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) (% 14), were the most common causes of respiratory distress. Furthermore, about 19. 3 % of the neonates died of the disease. The results of logistic regression for the independent risk factors associated with RD outcomes showed that the death rate of neonates with RD had a significant correlation with respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation (odds ratio[OR]: 33. 49, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 6. 95 - 161. 38), and incidence of apnea (OR: 5. 87, 95 % CI: 1. 072 - 32. 167). Conclusion It was found that RDS is {{the most common cause of}} respiratory distress in the hospitalized neonates. Moreover, infant mortality rate increased due to respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation and occurrence of apnea...|$|R
5000|$|Feeding such a {{large group}} was {{essential}} to keeping the protest going. Initially some people could enter and leave the building. This {{made it possible for}} them to collect donations of money and food. Major outlets such as McDonald’s and Safeway contributed in the spirit of “helping the handicapped” until it became clear that protesters were engaging in civil disobedience. Within the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> members <b>of</b> the Black Panther Party arrived to volunteer to feed all of the occupiers, including Brad Lomax and Chuck Jackson. ”We support you because you're asking America to change, to treat you like human beings, like you belong,” one explained, “We always support people fighting for their rights."

5|$|The 2nd Army Group was not {{directly}} attacked during the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> the invasion, but events {{to the east}} and west of its deployment area resulted in successive orders to withdraw to the lines of the Drava and Danube then the Sava. On 10 April, the crumbling defences of the 4th Army on the left flank of the 1st Army Group had been penetrated by the German 8th Panzer Division, which then turned east and drove into the left flank of the 1st Army Group on the following day. By the end of that day, the Germans had effectively routed the 2nd Army Group. Remnants continued to fight along the line of the Sava until early on 14 April, but mass surrenders began that day {{with tens of thousands of}} Yugoslav soldiers being taken into captivity by the Germans during their drive on Sarajevo in the centre of the country. The Yugoslav High Command unconditionally surrendered in Belgrade effective at 12:00 on 18 April.|$|E
5|$|The Syrian Army, which {{consisted}} of 4,500 soldiers, had been mostly repelled in their offensive during the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> the war, gaining control over a small area along the Syrian border. As {{a result of the}} army's poor showing, Quwatli pressed defense minister Ahmad al-Sharabati to resign his post, which Sharabati did on 24 May. He then replaced chief of staff Abdullah Atfeh with Husni al-Zaim during that same period of the war. Following the war, Quwatli accused Zaim of military incompetence and his officers of profiteering. In turn, Zaim accused Quwatli of mismanagement during the conflict. The Syrian public did not spare Quwatli blame for the army's poor performance, causing his popularity, built on his nationalist reputation, to erode further. The Syrian press was also sharply critical of Quwatli and Prime Minister Mardam Bey, urging them to leave their positions. Mardam Bey resigned on 22 August 1948 and was replaced by Khalid al-Azm.|$|E
5|$|Channel 4 {{was also}} accused of showing too many studio {{segments}} during the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> the Games rather than live events, and for missing several notable events involving British athletes, including a swimming heat where Eleanor Simmonds {{set a new}} personal best and almost beat the world record, Sarah Storey winning her eleventh Paralympic medal, and Great Britain's opening wheelchair basketball game against Germany. Channel 4 noted that time was needed {{during the first few}} days to explain Paralympic events and the classification system to viewers, and that it was operating three additional channels' worth of live coverage throughout the Games. The broadcaster also stated that it had to make editorial decisions on which events to air during periods where a large number of events were in progress. The amount of live coverage was also affected by Olympic Broadcasting Services, who did not send cameras or provide official television coverage for sports such as cycling, the marathon, and shooting. Channel 4's news department did send its own cameramen to film the affected events for highlights, but was unable to broadcast them live.|$|E
