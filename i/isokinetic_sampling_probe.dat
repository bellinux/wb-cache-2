The present investigation has the objective to supplement the measurements performed by Yule et al., by considering the limiting case of a spray in a stagnant environment.

40|$|Gas-liquid flows {{are very}} common in {{industrial}} applications and many times involve three phases. Experiments are important as basis for development of 1 D flow models used for design of multiphase transport systems. The experiments are either used as direct closure relation or for model validation. Currently, {{there is a lack}} of three-phase flow data on droplet entrainment. This thesis is focused on two main topics: establish relevant experimental data of the droplet flux profiles, pressure gradient and flow characteristics of three-phase stratified and annular flows and to develop instrumentation suitable for three phase flow measurements. Experiments in three phase flows at high gas densities were conducted to obtain the magnitude and distribution of the droplet field flux and the effect of the water as a second liquid phase. This was studied by sampling the droplets using an <b>isokinetic</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>probe.</b> An automated probe system was designed and implemented successfully to reach this goal. The probe system is capable to conduct simultaneous measurements of the local droplet flux and gas velocity. Oil and water distribution inside the liquid layer in stratified-annular horizontal flow was studied using a two-energy traversing gamma densitometer and visual observations, using high speed video recordings of the flow. The experiments were performed at the Medium scale loop at SINTEF Multiphase Flow Laboratory using a high density gas at medium pressure conditions, oil and water. Based on the experimental results, an assessment of the effect of droplet flux distribution over the pipe cross section on the entrainment fraction calculation is discussed. Additionally, the current state of predicting models for liquid droplet concentration profiles is reviewed and new empirical correlations for the droplet concentration at the interface and the concentration decay are proposed. The effect on the pressure gradient changes due to liquid film at the wall, caused by droplet wetting, was studied on a second experimental setup. The setup was built at the NTNU Multiphase Flow Laboratory and consists of a vertical pipe to promote film symmetry. Twophase flow experiments using water and air and a viscous oil and air at atmospheric pressure were carried out. The results were compared with predictions of commercial flow simulators. In addition a new two-energy gamma densitometer is designed and built to obtain cross-sectional measurements of the phase fractions, capture transient flow conditions and for three-phase flow measurements (oil, water and gas) in acrylic pipes.

40|$|Airborne {{coal dust}} {{generated}} during mining can deposit and accumulate on mine surfaces, presenting a dust explosion hazard. When assessing dust hazard mitigation strategies for airborne dust reduction, sampling {{is done in}} high-velocity ventilation air, {{which is used to}} purge the mining face and gallery tunnel. In this environment, the sampler inlet velocity should be matched to the air stream velocity (<b>isokinetic</b> <b>sampling)</b> to prevent oversampling of coarse dust at low sampler-to-air velocity ratios. Low velocity ratios are often encountered when using low flow rate, personal sampling pumps commonly used in underground mines. In this study, with a goal of employing mine-ready equipment, a personal sampler was adapted for area sampling of coarse coal dust in high-velocity ventilation air. This was done by adapting an isokinetic nozzle to the inlet of an Institute of Occupational Medicine (Edinburgh, Scotland) sampling cassette (IOM). Collected dust masses were compared for the modified IOM <b>isokinetic</b> <b>sampler</b> (IOM-MOD), the IOM without the isokinetic nozzle, and a conventional dust sampling cassette without the cyclone on the inlet. All samplers were operated at a flow rate typical of personal sampling pumps: 2 L/min. To ensure differences between collected masses that could be attributed to sampler design and were not influenced by artifacts from dust concentration gradients, relatively uniform and repeatable dust concentrations were demonstrated in the sampling zone of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health experimental mine gallery. Consistent with isokinetic theory, greater differences between <b>isokinetic</b> and non-isokinetic <b>sampled</b> masses were found for larger dust volume-size distributions and higher ventilation air velocities. Since <b>isokinetic</b> <b>sampling</b> is conventionally used to determine total dust concentration, and <b>isokinetic</b> <b>sampling</b> made a difference in collected masses, the results suggest when sampling for coarse coal dust the IOM-MOD may improve airborne coarse dust assessments over "off-the-shelf" sampling cassettes.

Three related types of experiment have been carried in this context, namely studies of particle motion in an annulus geometry simulating drop motion in a ballooned fuel element, studies of single phase flow in a 3 × 3 tube bundle simulating a ballooned fuel element and studies of reflooding of a hot tube {{in which it was}} possible to photograph the region above the rewetting front using axial view photography. In the particle tracking studies, Particle Tracking Velocimetry (PTV) was used to determine typical particle tracks in an annulus test section in which the inner surface was ballooned to simulate the clad ballooning likely to occur during the reflood phase of an LB-LOCA. Excellent agreement was obtained between the measured particle tracks and ones calculated using the STAR-CD CFD code. The second set of experiments focussed on investigating the effect of pin ballooning on the vapour flow. An idealised, simulated PWR bundle containing a 3 × 3 rod arrangement with a central ballooned pin was designed and constructed and, using a novel <b>isokinetic</b> <b>probe</b> <b>sampling</b> technique, the axial deviation in mass flow of an outer sub-channel was measured. Again, good agreement was obtained between the flows measured and those calculated from the STAR-CD code. To further elucidate the rewetting process itself and the behaviour of the associated two-phase flow, an axial-viewing reflood (AVR) rig has been designed and constructed. Within this facility, experiments have been carried out to examine the thermal-hydraulic effects occurring during bottom-up reflooding of a single hot tube.

These criteria address the capability of the <b>sampling</b> <b>probe</b> to extract a sample that is representative of the effluent stream. The tests conducted by PNNL during July 2010 on the HFEF system are described in this report. The <b>sampling</b> <b>probe</b> location is approximately 20 feet {{from the base of the}} stack. The stack base is in the second floor of the HFEF, and has a building ventilation stream (limited potential radioactive effluent) as well as a process stream (potential radioactive effluent, but HEPA-filtered) that feeds into it. The tests conducted on the duct indicate that the process stream is insufficiently mixed with the building ventilation stream. As a result, the air <b>sampling</b> <b>probe</b> location does not meet the criteria of the N 13. 1 - 1999 standard.

Sampling particles directly from jet engines has been performed by different research groups in the U. S. and Europe.

PM is regulated by size, with PM 10, which {{is comprised of}} particles with aerodynamic equivalent diameters {{less than or equal}} to 10 ?m, being the main focus of this research. FRM PM 10 samplers exhibit sampling errors when sampling dusts with mass median diameters (MMDs) that are larger than the 10 ?m sampler cutpoint.

Controlled testing in a wind tunnel is needed to obtain a clearer understanding and quantification of the performance shifts of these samplers under varying aerosol concentrations, wind speeds and dust types. In this study, sampler performance was tested in a controlled environment wind tunnel meeting EPA requirements for particulate matter (PM) sampler evaluation. The samplers evaluated included two low-volume PM 10 and Total Suspended Particulate (TSP) pre-separators. The masses and particle size distributions (PSDs) obtained from the filters of tested samplers were compared to those of a collocated <b>isokinetic</b> <b>sampler.</b> Sampler performance was documented using two parameters: cut-point (d_ 50) and slope. The cut-point is the particle diameter corresponding to 50 % collection efficiency of the pre-separator while the slope is the ratio of particle sizes corresponding to cumulative collection efficiencies of 84. 1 % and 50 % (d_ 84. 1 /d_ 50) or 50 % and 15. 9 % (d_ 50 /d_ 15. 9) or the square root of 84. 1 % and 15. 9 % (d_ 84. 1 /d_ 15. 9). The test variables included three levels of wind speeds (2 -, 8 -, and 24 -km/h), five aerosol concentrations varying from 150 to 1, 500 mu g/m 3 and three aerosols with different PSDs (ultrafine Arizona Road Dust (ARD), fine ARD and cornstarch). No differences were detected between the performance of the flat and louvered FRM PM 10 samplers (a = 0. 05). The mean cut-point of both the PM 10 samplers was 12. 23 mu m while the mean slope was 2. 46. The mean cut-point and slope values were statistically different from the upper limit of EPA-specified performance criteria of 10. 5 mu m for the cut-point and 1. 6 for the slope. The PM 10 samplers over-sampled cornstarch but under-sampled ultrafine and fine ARD.

The sandwich method involves depositing a layer of matrix onto the surface of the probe and allowing it to dry. A drop of the sample followed by a drop of additional matrix is then applied to the layer of dried matrix and allowed to dry as well. Variations on the sandwich technique involve depositing the matrix on the surface and then depositing the sample directly on top of the matrix. A particularly useful method involves depositing the matrix solution {{on the surface of}} the <b>sample</b> <b>probe</b> in a solvent that will evaporate very rapidly, thus forming a very thin fine layer of matrix. The sample solution is then placed on top of the matrix layer and allowed to evaporate slowly, thus integrating the sample into the top layer of matrix as the sample solution evaporates. An addition concern when depositing the sample {{on the surface of the}} probe is the solubility of the sample in the matrix. If the sample is insoluble in the matrix, additional methods must be employed. A method used in this case involves mechanical grinding and mixing of solid sample and solid matrix crystals. Once blended well, this powder can be deposited on the surface of the <b>sample</b> <b>probe</b> in free powder form or as a pill. Another possible method is placing the sample on the surface of the probe and applying vaporized matrix to the <b>sample</b> <b>probe</b> to allow the matrix to condense around the sample.|$|R
40|$|A {{multi-port}} calibration xture for {{the cross}} calibration of aerosol point sensors has been developed. The system {{was designed for}} comparative calibrations of instruments using differing measurement methods such as optical particle counters, aerodynamic impactors, etc. Four <b>isokinetic</b> <b>sampling</b> ports are attached to a laminar ow plenum such that all four sampling ports sample identical aerosol concentrations under identical ow conditions. Correlation and correction factors are applied to each instrument creating a standard method. This standard method {{can be applied to}} inter-compare and calibrate aerosol sensing instrumentation and/or to characterize the microphysical properties of a test aerosol. The performance of this xture has been demonstrated with a TSI 3321 APS, a GRIMM 1. 109 and a MetOne OPC...|$|R
50|$|A {{sample is}} {{continuously}} {{extracted from the}} gas stream being monitored using a titanium probe, which is water-cooled to below 70 °C. The sample flow rate is automatically adjusted to ensure <b>isokinetic</b> <b>sampling</b> (the velocity of gas entering the sampling system {{is equal to the}} velocity of the gas in the system under test). The sample gas is drawn through a quartz wool pre-filter and then across a cartridge filled with resin, such as XAD 2. The sample gas is also cooled to below 5 °C to condense and remove water vapour. All system parameters are recorded digitally during sampling. The resin cartridge and the condensate are removed {{at the end of a}} monitoring period, and the contents are analysed to determine levels of dioxins and furans.|$|R
50|$|To {{ensure that}} the sample {{that is going to}} be {{extracted}} for analysis represents the process conditions exactly, it is important to choose the correct <b>sample</b> extraction <b>probe.</b> The validity of the analysis is largely dependent on the sample being truly representative. As the probe is going to be directly attached to the process pipe work, it may have to withstand severe conditions.For most applications, the <b>sample</b> <b>probe</b> is manufactured to the stringent codes applicable to high-pressure,high-temperature pipework.|$|R
40|$|An {{automated}} direct sample {{insertion device}} for inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry is described. Graphite cup <b>sample</b> <b>probes</b> can be mechanically {{inserted into the}} plasma, and the insertion sequence is completely under computer control via a stepper motor. Multichannel high-speed electronics {{have been developed for}} a direct-reading polychromator that allow the real-time digitization of the transient spectral signals from up to six channels simultaneously. A small robot arm is used to automate exchange of the graphite cup <b>sample</b> <b>probes.</b> Custom software has been developed for system control and signal processing. For volatile elements such as Zn and Cd, detection limits are in the pg range for a 10 μL solution sample. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|The {{multiphase}} {{combustion process}} of metallised solid fuel slabs {{has been investigated}} with a water cooled <b>sampling</b> <b>probe</b> system under ramjet relevant conditions concerning the air inlet temperature. The spatial distribution of concentrations of gaseous stable (intermediate) reaction products {{as well as the}} boronoxide content of the collected solid phase inside the combustor have been determined. The <b>sampling</b> <b>probe</b> system, the <b>sampling</b> procedure as well as the planar step combustor test facility are described. With the continuous monitoring of the pressure inside the tip of the probe the correct operating condition of the sampling system can be observed.

40|$|The HALO Submicrometer Aerosol Inlet (HASI) was {{specifically}} designed for HALO with the aim to provide up to 30 l/min sample air flow (divided over four forward facing sample lines) to aerosol instruments mounted inside the aircraft cabin. HASI samples the air {{on the top of}} the fuselage outside of the aircraft boundary layer. The air stream is aligned in the inlet and deaccelerated in three stages by roughly a factor of 40 using a front shroud, a main diffusor and smaller diffusers at the tips of four sample tubes which protrude into the deaccelerated air stream. In addition, there is a backward-facing sample tube installed for optional use. The design concept is to allow regulating the sample air flow in each of the four forward-facing sample lines to achieve <b>isokinetic</b> <b>sampling</b> conditions according to the actual speed of the aircraft. Pumps and bypass lines for regulation of the air flow are part of the Aerosol Measurement System (AMETYST) cabin rack on HALO operated by DLR. The geometric design of the inlet should prevent large cloud droplets and ice crystals from entering the sample lines directly. Judging from the first measurements of different instruments using HASI during the ML-CIRRUS and ACRIDICON-CHUVA missions with HALO, it appears that condensation particle counter (CPC) measurements of interstitial aerosol in liquid clouds are affected by artefacts while in ice clouds there is no indication of any measurement problem. Selected examples of other measurement results for initial experimental characterization of the inlet will be discussed. In order to achieve better <b>isokinetic</b> <b>sampling,</b> further numerical flow simulations of the final inlet design for different aircraft altitudes and speeds are required to establish a final regulation of the sample air flow in each of the four sample lines based on pressure and temperature sensors in the inlet and aircraft data...|$|R
