5|$|Zwingli again {{took the}} lead in the disputation. His {{opponent}} was the aforementioned canon, Konrad Hofmann, who had initially supported Zwingli's election. Also taking part was a group of young men demanding a much faster pace of reformation, who among other things pleaded for replacing infant baptism with adult baptism. This group was led by Conrad Grebel, one of the initiators of the Anabaptist movement. During the first three days of dispute, although the controversy of images and the mass were discussed, the arguments led {{to the question of whether}} the city council or the ecclesiastical government had the authority to decide on these issues. At this point, Konrad Schmid, a priest from Aargau and follower of Zwingli, made a pragmatic suggestion. As images were not yet considered to be valueless by everyone, he suggested that pastors preach on this subject under threat of punishment. He believed the opinions of the people would gradually change and the voluntary removal of images would follow. Hence, Schmid rejected the radicals and their iconoclasm, but supported Zwingli's position. In November the council passed ordinances in support of Schmid's motion. Zwingli wrote a booklet on the evangelical duties of a minister, Kurze, christliche Einleitung (Short Christian Introduction), and the council sent <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> clergy and the members of the Confederation.|$|E

500|$|From 2004 to 2007, Higgins' sexual {{orientation}} {{was the subject}} of media speculation based partly on interpretations of her lyrics and her interviews.

I think sexuality is a fluid thing and it's becoming increasingly more acceptable to admit that you're that way." [...] In November her Myspace page reported, [...] "I've been in relationships with both men and women so I guess I fall most easily under the category 'Bisexual'". She {{went on to say that}} she wanted future interviews to focus on her music rather than her sexuality. In a March 2008 interview with AfterEllen.com, Higgins said that her song [...] "Secret" [...] was written about an ex-girlfriend who was not comfortable, at first, about going public with their relationship; [...] "I was so head over heels in love with her I kind of wanted to shout <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> world, so it was just a song about keeping something under the covers ... keeping it away locked in a little room." ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{the charges}} against Hancock were dropped, many writers later {{described}} him as a smuggler. The accuracy of this characterization has been questioned. [...] "Hancock's guilt or innocence and the exact charges against him", wrote historian John W. Tyler in 1986, [...] "are still fiercely debated." [...] Historian Oliver Dickerson argued that Hancock {{was the victim of}} an essentially criminal racketeering scheme perpetrated by Governor Bernard and the customs officials. Dickerson believed that there is no reliable evidence that Hancock was guilty in the Liberty case, and {{that the purpose of the}} trials was to punish Hancock for political reasons and to plunder his property. Opposed to Dickerson's interpretation were Kinvin Wroth and Hiller Zobel, the editors of John Adams's legal papers, who argued that [...] "Hancock's innocence is open to question", and that the British officials acted legally, if unwisely. Lawyer and historian Bernard Knollenberg concluded that the customs officials had the right to seize Hancock's ship, but towing <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Romney had been illegal. Legal historian John Phillip Reid argued that the testimony of both sides was so politically partial that it is not possible to objectively reconstruct the incident.|$|E

2500|$|Atlantic rests under [...] {{of water}} near Long Point. That fall, diver John Green {{was hired by}} American Express to dive the wreck and {{retrieve}} Atlantic safe and money known {{to be in a}} cabin, but his attempts failed. In 1855, Green returned with the schooner Yorktown, located the safe, and moved <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> deck of Atlantic. But Green contracted a near-fatal case of the bends and was taken to a hospital; he was in recovery until the summer of 1856. When he returned to the wreck on 1 July he found the safe and money were gone. Another diver, Eliot Harrington, had found them both and hauled them to the surface. $36,700 was taken from Atlantic safe, at a time when a decent wage was a dollar a day. American Express went to court for the money; the ending settlement gave Harrington and the four others who worked with him a bit under $2000 each, with American Express taking the rest.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the fighting, the division was used as political bargaining chip (among other arguments) during a series of back and forth telegrams between Churchill and Prime Minister of Australia John Curtin, discussing the possibility of diverting Australian troops to Burma rather than being allowed to return home. On 20 February, Churchill sent a telegram in which, he stated [...] "...your message of January 23, in which you said that the evacuation of Singapore would be 'an inexcusable betrayal'. Agreeably with your point of view, we therefore put the 18th Division ... into Singapore instead of diverting them to Burma, and ordered them to fight <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> end. They were lost at Singapore and did not save it, whereas they could almost certainly have saved Rangoon. I take full responsibility with my colleagues on the Defence Committe for this decision; but you also bear a heavy share on account of your telegram." [...] Two days later, Curtin retorted [...] "In regard to your statement that the 18th Division was diverted from Burma to Singapore because of our message, it is pointed out that the date of the latter was January 23, whereas in your telegram of January 14 you informed me that one brigade of this division was due on January 13 and the remainder on January 27." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1929, {{the city}} opened its {{consolidated}} water works plant which replaced two separate plants {{that were on}} each side of the Saginaw river. This plant treated water brought in from the Saginaw river and piped <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> residents as well as corner pumps for people that did not have direct connections to the system. Currently, the City of Saginaw jointly owns with the City of Midland the Saginaw-Midland Municipal Water Supply Corporation. Incorporated in 1946, this water treatment system has supplied drinking and industrial water to both cities and many surrounding areas within the county. Due to brackish water in the aquifers below both cities, a [...] pipeline was constructed in 1948 to supply water from Lake Huron at White Stone Point, north of Au Gres to water treatment plants in Saginaw and Midland with a second pipe added by 1996. This system has played a role in the decline of the city. The City of Saginaw, in order to obtain new sources of revenue, sold water to areas outside of the city (especially to the Saginaw Charter Township). This caused numerous businesses inside the city to leave for the surrounding areas and development in the city to stagnate. The City of Midland, however, adopted a policy of [...] "No Annexation, No Water" [...] which has led to the growth of the city as well as the surrounding areas.|$|E

2500|$|The tractor used a , inline four-cylinder engine. The {{engine was}} similar to the Ford Model T engine in many respects. Like many engines of its day, it was multifuel-capable; it was usually tuned for {{gasoline}} or kerosene, but alcohol could also be burned. (Tractor vaporising oil [...] existed in 1920 but was not yet widely used. It entered broader use in the 1930s and 1940s.) Like many other multifuel machines, the Fordson started on gasoline from a small auxiliary tank (just a few quarts) and then switched over to the main fuel tank once warmed up sufficiently (no more than 5 minutes). To handle the kerosene (or, rarely, TVO), the intake system had a vaporizer downstream of the carburetor. The mixture coming from the carburetor was intentionally rich, and the vaporizer heated it and mixed it with more air to lean <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> final ratio before entering the intake manifold. The intake system also had a water-bath air cleaner to filter the dust out of the air inhaled by the engine (an invention that did not originate at Ford but that was still rather novel in 1917). Air cleaning is critical to engine lifespan, even for road vehicles and most especially for farming and construction vehicles (which work in environments where dirt is frequently stirred up into the air). The Fordson carburetor and air cleaner were designed by Holley. In later decades, the water bath would be replaced with an oil bath for better filtering performance.|$|E
2500|$|In 1919, the Italian {{state had}} brought {{in a series of}} liberal reforms in Libya that allowed {{education}} in Arabic and Berber and allowed for the possibility that the Libyans might become Italian citizens. Giuseppe Volpi, who had been appointed governor in 1921 was retained by Mussolini, and withdrew all of the measures offering equality to the Libyans. A policy of confiscating land from the Libyans to hand over to Italian colonists gave new vigor to Libyan resistance led by Omar Mukhtar, and during the ensuing [...] "Pacification of Libya", the Fascist regime waged a near-genocidal campaign designed to kill as many Libyans as possible. Well over half the population of Cyrenaica were confined to 15 concentration camps by 1931 while the Royal Italian Air Force staged chemical warfare attacks against the Bedouin. On 20 June 1930, Marshal Pietro Badoglio wrote to General Rodolfo Graziani: As for overall strategy, it is necessary to create a significant and clear separation between the controlled population and the rebel formations. I do not hide the significance and seriousness of this measure, which might be the ruin of the subdued population ... But now the course has been set, and we must carry <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> end, even if the entire population of Cyrenaica must perish. On 3 January 1933, Mussolini told the diplomat Baron Pompei Aloisi that the French in Tunisia had made an [...] "appalling blunder" [...] by permitting sex between the French and the Tunisians, which he predicted would lead to the French degenerating into a nation of [...] "half-castes", and to prevent the same thing happening to the Italians gave orders to Marshal Badolglio that miscegenation be made a crime in Libya.|$|E
