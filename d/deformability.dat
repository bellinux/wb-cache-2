25|$|The {{material}} properties of FRP or GRP bars differ markedly from steel, {{so there are}} differences in the design considerations. FRP or GRP bars have relatively higher tensile strength but lower stiffness, so that deflections are likely to be higher than for equivalent steel-reinforced units. Structures with internal FRP reinforcement typically have an elastic <b>deformability</b> comparable to the plastic <b>deformability</b> (ductility) of steel reinforced structures. Failure in either case is more likely to occur by compression of the concrete than by rupture of the reinforcement. Deflection is always a major design consideration for reinforced concrete. Deflection limits are set to ensure that crack widths in steel-reinforced concrete are controlled to prevent water, air or other aggressive substances reaching the steel and causing corrosion. For FRP-reinforced concrete, aesthetics and possibly water-tightness will be the limiting criteria for crack width control. FRP rods also have relatively lower compressive strengths than steel rebar, and accordingly require different design approaches for reinforced concrete columns.|$|E

2500|$|Certain {{regulatory}} measures {{are in place}} to minimize RBC storage lesion – including a maximum shelf life (currently 42 days), a maximum auto-hemolysis threshold (currently 1% in the US, 0.8% in Europe), and a minimum level of post-transfusion RBC survival in vivo (currently 75% after 24 hours). However, all of these criteria are applied in a universal manner that {{does not account for}} differences among units of product. For example, testing for the post-transfusion RBC survival in vivo is done on a sample of healthy volunteers, and then compliance is presumed for all RBC units based on universal (GMP) processing standards (of course, RBC survival by itself does not guarantee efficacy, but it is a necessary prerequisite for cell function, and hence serves as a regulatory proxy). Opinions vary as to the [...] "best" [...] way to determine transfusion efficacy in a patient in vivo.

Some <b>deformability</b> tests may be more physiologically-relevant than others for given applications. For example, perfusion is more sensitive to relatively small changes in <b>deformability</b> (compared to filterability), thus making it preferable for assessing RBC <b>deformability</b> in contexts where microcirculatory implications are of particular interest.

40|$|The inverse stellar {{structure}} problem {{determines the}} equation of state of the matter in stars from a knowledge of their macroscopic observables (e. g. their masses and radii). This problem was solved in a previous paper by constructing a spectral representation of {{the equation of}} state whose stellar models match a prescribed set of macroscopic observables. This paper improves and extends that work in two significant ways. (i) The method is made more robust by accounting for an unexpected feature of the enthalpy-based representations of the equations of state used in this work. After making the appropriate modifications, accurate initial guesses for the spectral parameters are no longer needed, so Monte Carlo techniques can now be used to ensure the best fit to the observables. (ii) The method is extended here to use masses and tidal <b>deformabilities</b> (which will be measured by gravitational wave observations of neutron-star mergers) as the macroscopic observables instead of masses and radii. The accuracy and reliability of this extended and more robust spectral method is evaluated in this paper using mock data for observables from stars based on 34 different theoretical models of the high-density neutron-star equation of state. In qualitative agreement with earlier work, these tests suggest the high-density part of the neutron-star equation of state could be determined at the few-percent accuracy level using high-quality measurements of the masses and radii (or masses and tidal <b>deformabilities)</b> of just two or three neutron stars...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} a simple holographic model for cold and dense deconfined QCD matter consisting of three quark flavors. Varying the single free parameter {{of the model}} and utilizing a Chiral Effective Theory equation of state (EoS) for nuclear matter, we find four different compact star solutions: traditional neutron stars, strange quark stars, {{as well as two}} non-standard solutions we refer to as hybrid stars of the second and third kind (HS 2 and HS 3). The HS 2 s are composed of a nuclear matter core and a crust made of stable strange quark matter, while the HS 3 s have both a quark mantle and a nuclear crust on top of a nuclear matter core. For all types of stars constructed, we determine not only their mass-radius relations, but also tidal <b>deformabilities,</b> Love numbers, as well as moments of inertia and the mass distribution. We find that there exists a range of parameter values in our model, for which the novel hybrid stars have properties in very good agreement with all existing bounds on the bulk properties of compact stars. In particular, the tidal <b>deformabilities</b> of these solutions are smaller than those of ordinary neutron stars of the same mass, implying that they provide an excellent fit to the recent gravitational wave data GW 170817 of LIGO and Virgo. The assumptions underlying the viability of the different star types, in particular those corresponding to absolutely stable quark matter, are finally discussed at some length.

We also show that these dark objects admit the $I$-Love-$Q$ universal relations, which link their moments of inertia, tidal <b>deformabilities,</b> and quadrupole moments.

Such materials are highly anisotropic and, because of lack of bracing, can present a large contrast between the shear and compression <b>deformabilities.</b> Moreover, when the thickness to length ratio of the frame elements is small, these elements can resonate in bending at low frequencies, when compressional waves propagate in the structure. The frame size being small compared to the wavelength of the compressional waves, the homogenization method of periodic discrete media is extended to situations with local resonance and it is applied to identify the macroscopic behavior at the leading order. In particular, the local resonance in bending leads to an effective mass different from the real mass and to the generalization of the Newtonian mechanics at the macroscopic scale. Consequently, compressional waves become dispersive and frequency bandgaps occur. The physical origin of these phenomena at the microscopic scale is also presented.
