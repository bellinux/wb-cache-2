50|$|The {{best example}} {{here is an}} analog radio tuning dial where one may make precise tuning {{movements}} both forwards and backwards. Specialized gear designs allow this. One of the more common designs splits the gear into two gears, each half {{the thickness of the}} original. One half of the gear is fixed to its shaft while {{the other half of the}} gear is allowed to turn on the shaft, but pre-loaded in rotation by small coil springs that rotate the free gear relative to the fixed gear. In this way, the spring tension rotates the free gear until all of the backlash in the system has been taken out; the teeth of the fixed <b>gear</b> <b>press</b> against one side of the teeth of the pinion while the teeth of the free <b>gear</b> <b>press</b> against the other side of the teeth on the pinion. Loads smaller than the force of the springs do not compress the springs and with no gaps between the teeth to be taken up, backlash is eliminated.|$|E

50|$|Vandercook & Sons was a {{manufacturer}} of proof presses, founded in 1909 by Robert Vandercook. They dominated the 20th century proof press industry by developing {{the first and the}} most widely used proof presses that did not rely on gravity for the force of their impression. As a result, Vandercook's <b>geared</b> <b>presses</b> were easier and more precise for an operator to use.|$|R
5000|$|When a UniTrol {{snowblower}} is running, {{the engine}} is always turning a drive platter. The act of engaging a <b>gear</b> <b>presses</b> a rubber-edged wheel against the flat steel surface of the spinning platter, which transfers power through 90 degrees to the drive axle and at a ratio inversely proportional to {{the distance from the}} center of the platter at which the wheel is engaged. A neutral [...] "gear" [...] is available by simply lifting the wheel from the surface of the platter, and a reverse gear is available by engaging the wheel at a symmetric point across the center of the platter.|$|R
50|$|<b>Geared</b> head drill <b>presses</b> are {{commonly}} found in tool rooms and other commercial environments where a heavy duty machine capable of production drilling and quick setup changes is required. In most cases, the spindle is machined to accept Morse taper tooling for greater flexibility. Larger <b>geared</b> head drill <b>presses</b> are frequently fitted with power feed on the quill mechanism, with an arrangement to disengage the feed when a certain drill depth has been achieved or {{in the event of}} excessive travel. Some gear-head drill presses have the ability to perform tapping operations without the need for an external tapping attachment. This feature is commonplace on larger <b>gear</b> head drill <b>presses.</b> A clutch mechanism drives the tap into the part under power and then backs it out of the threaded hole once the proper depth is reached. Coolant systems are also common on these machines to prolong tool life under production conditions.|$|R

40|$|Defining {{manufacturing}} tolerances {{is an important}} task for a process planner before starting production of a new product or introducing new processes. One of the more complex processes to handle is the heat treatment of <b>gears.</b> <b>Press</b> quenching is a heat treatment method where the gear is mechanically forced to keep or attain the desired geometry, with less geometrical distortions in comparison to oil bath quenching. The objective {{of this paper is}} to discover how design of experiments can be used to scrutinize press quenching of bevel gears. The first part of this investigation shows how different process parameter settings influence geometry of the bevel gear. Based on the results of the experiments, predictions and statistical simulations, the outcome of the press quenching process can be estimated. Estimations for the number of defect parts then form the basis for evaluating whether the proposed tolerances meet the quality requirements. The work is based on an industrial case where 55 bevel gear crown wheels for heavy trucks are carburized and then case hardened in a Gleason press quenching machine. QC 20130909 </p...|$|R

5000|$|Coining is a {{cold working}} process similar in other respects to forging, which takes place at {{elevated}} temperature; it uses {{a great deal of}} force to plastically deform a workpiece, so it conforms to a die. Coining can be done using a <b>gear</b> driven <b>press,</b> a mechanical press, or more commonly, a hydraulically actuated press. Coining typically requires higher tonnage presses than stamping, because the workpiece is plastically deformed and not actually cut, as in some other forms of stamping. The coining process is preferred when there is a high tonnage.|$|R
50|$|A <b>geared</b> head drill <b>press</b> is a {{drill press}} in which power {{transmission}} from the motor to the spindle is achieved solely through spur gearing inside the machine's head. No friction elements (e.g., belts) of any kind are used, which assures a positive drive at all times and minimizes maintenance requirements. Gear head drills are intended for metalworking applications where the drilling forces are higher and the desired speed (RPM) is lower than that used for woodworking.|$|R

5000|$|This type {{includes}} {{helical gear}} limited-slip differentials and clutch, cone (an alternative type of clutch) where the engagement {{force of the}} clutch {{is a function of}} the input torque applied to the differential (as the engine applies more torque the clutches grip harder and Trq d [...] decreases).Torque sensing LSDs respond to driveshaft torque, so that the more driveshaft input torque present, the harder the clutches, cones or <b>gears</b> are <b>pressed</b> together, and thus the more closely the drive wheels are coupled to each other. Some include spring loading to provide some small torque so that with little or no input torque (trailing throttle/gearbox in neutral/main clutch depressed) the drive wheels are minimally coupled. The amount of preload (hence static coupling) on the clutches or cones is affected by the general condition (wear) and by how tightly they are loaded.|$|R

40|$|When {{components}} such as bearings or <b>gears</b> are <b>pressed</b> onto a shaft, {{the resulting}} interference induces a pressure at the interface. The {{size of this}} pressure is important as many components fail because fatigue initiates from press-fit stress concentrations. The aim of the present work was to develop ultrasound {{as a tool for}} non-destructive determination of press-fit contact pressures. An interference fit interface behaves like a spring. If the pressure is high, there are few air gaps, so it is very stiff and allows transmission of an ultrasonic wave. If the pressure is low, then interface stiffness is lower and most ultrasound is reflected. A spring model was used to determine maps of contact stiffness from interference-fit ultrasonic reflection data. A calibration procedure was then used to determine the pressure. The interface contact pressure has been determined for a number of different press- and shrink-fit cases. The results show a central region of approximately uniform pressure with edge stress at the contact sides. The magnitude of the pressure in the central region agrees well with the elastic Lamé analysis. In the more severe press-fit cases, the surfaces scuffed which led to anomalies in the reflected ultrasound. These anomalies were associated with regions of surface damage at the interface. The average contact pressure in a shrink-fit and press-fit joint were similar. However, in the shrink-fit joint more uneven contact pressure was observed with regions of poor conformity. This could be because the action of pressing on a sleeve plastically smooths out long wavelength roughness, leading to a more conforming surface...|$|R
50|$|A {{substantial}} number of British buses built between about 1935 and 1960 had preselector transmission, particularly those built by Daimler and AEC, and some by Leyland. Some were mechanical, whereas the AEC RT type, universal in London at this period, had the gearbox air-operated (compressed air was also used for the brakes, windscreen wipers, etc.), which gave off a characteristic hiss when the change <b>gear</b> pedal was <b>pressed.</b> Typical operation of London buses was {{they had a very}} low first gear, only used on hills, so the driver when starting would select second gear, depress and release the change gear pedal to engage the transmission, and then select third ready for changing gear on the move, all this done while the bus was still stationary. On starting, just the accelerator pedal was <b>pressed,</b> the <b>gear</b> change to third made at about 15 mph by just pressing the left pedal, and that could well suffice to the next stop where the bus would be stopped in gear and the process repeated.|$|R
5000|$|A {{radial arm}} drill press {{is a large}} <b>geared</b> head drill <b>press</b> in which the head can be moved along an arm that radiates from the machine's column. As it is {{possible}} to swing the arm relative to the machine's base, a radial arm drill press is able to operate over a large area without having to reposition the workpiece. This saves considerable time because it is much faster to reposition the drill head than it is to unclamp, move, and then re-clamp the workpiece to the table. The size of work that can be handled may be considerable, as the arm can swing {{out of the way of}} the table, allowing an overhead crane or derrick to place a bulky workpiece on the table or base. A vise may be used with a radial arm drill press, but more often the workpiece is secured directly to the table or base, or is held in a fixture. Power spindle feed is nearly universal with these machines and coolant systems are common. Larger size machines often have power feed motors for elevating or moving the arm. The biggest radial arm drill presses are able to drill holes as large as four inches (101.6 millimeters) diameter in solid steel or cast iron. Radial arm drills are specified by the diameter of the column and the length of the arm. The length of the arm is usually the same as the maximum throat distance. The Radial Arm Drill pictured in this article is a 9-inch column x 3-foot arm. The maximum throat distance of this drill would be approximately 36", giving a swing of 72" [...] (6 feet)..|$|R
5000|$|Following the {{conclusion}} of Zurich's sophomore year, the Rutgers women's basketball team was drawn into a controversy not of their own doing. The shock-jock personality Don Imus used a slur against {{the women of the}} team just days after their loss in the NCAA Final Four championship game in April 2007. On April 10, 2007, the Rutgers women's basketball team held a press conference and Zurich was one of its spokespersons. Zurich spoke from the heart when she said:"Good morning, I am Heather Zurich; A sophomore and a proud member of the Rutgers women's basketball team. This week and last we should have been celebrating our accomplishments this past season; many of the media here, may not realize my team started the season 2-4, we were at the lowest of lows, Coach Stringer called us her worst defensive team ever; but we- the ten of us here- , prevailed, we fought, we persevered and most of all, we believed in ourselves. We won 22 of 25 games to finish the season, before falling to Tennessee in the national championship game[...]. We won the Big East championship along the way, the first ever and advanced to the NCAA Tournament. We know we shocked a lot of people along the way, but this team did not settle for just showing up- we reached what many only dream about - the NCAA title game. But all of our accomplishments were lost …. Our moment was taken away- Our moment to celebrate our success, our moment to realize how far we came on and off the court as young women; we were stripped of this moment by the degrading comments by Mr. Imus last Wednesday. What hurts the most about this situation is Mr. Imus knows not one of us personally; he doesn't know Mat is the funniest person you will ever meet; Kia is the big sister you never had but always wanted; and Piph would be an unbelievable lawyer someday. These are my teammates, my family. And we were insulted and yes, we are angry. Worst of all, my team and I did nothing to deserve Mr. Imus nor Mr. McGirk's deplorable comments. Our families are upset and with good reason; instead of enjoying our first day off in months to celebrate Easter with our families, this was the topic of conversation. We attend the eighth oldest institution of higher education in the country and not to mention, {{one of the most difficult}} academically. We ten are simply put --student-athletes. But instead of attending study hall this morning, I address you about something that should never have taken place.

The ten of us, love getting dressed up for banquets and I believe we present ourselves well - both on and off the court; even though Mr. Imus seemed to think differently.

40|$|Gear marking is a print {{defect in}} flexography. It {{appears as a}} uniformly spaced pattern of lateral {{alternating}} dark and light bands along the web length corresponding to the distance between gear teeth. A comprehensive definition characterizes gear marking as a regular pattern attributable to metal burrs, nicks, debris, or other flaws that lead to unsmooth movement somewhere in the mechanical system of the <b>press.</b> <b>Gear</b> marking {{can be caused by}} a multitude of different factors. In most cases, gear marking results from more than one phenomenon. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate some factors that were expected to contribute to both the causes and the severity of flexographic gear marking. The factors studied (independent variables) included plate hardness, and surface speed differential between the plate image area and the substrate when gear mark severity was the dependent variable of the study. The test target were designed and printed on the RIT 2 ̆ 7 s Mark Andy 4120 System narrow-web press. To study the effect of plate hardness, three plate types with different hardness, 40 Shore A, 50 Shore A, and 60 Shore A, were used. To study the effect of surface speed differential, two types of stickybacks, 0. 015 inch and 0. 020 inch, were used to create variations in surface speed differentials. Six pressruns were performed; the first three pressruns were of three plate hardness mounted on 0. 015 -inch stickybacks and the others were of three plate hardness mounted on 0. 020 -inch stickybacks. A group of thirty observers at the Rochester Institute of Technology were asked to participate in press sheet visual evaluation by ranking six sample press sheets in terms of gear mark severity. The Verity IA software was used to measure the horizontal bar defect indices on sample sheets of six pressruns for the quantitative analysis of gear mark severity. The results indicated that plate hardness and differential in surface speed affected the gear mark severity in flexography significantly. A lower plate hardness will produce more noticeable in gear marking than a higher one. A higher differential in surface speed will produce more noticeable in gear marking than a lower differential...|$|R
