This was achieved by analysing the relevance of these <b>factors</b> <b>in</b> three cases. It can be concluded that the pre-eminent role of science in food-related regulatory decisions is debatable. At a risk management level, other factors, such as cultural, social, or economic issues, are often more important than scientific advice in determining policy. There is a need for transparency at an international level as trade barriers are gradually being removed and these other factors arc becoming more apparent. Therefore it is important that all the <b>factors</b> implicated <b>in</b> the food safety policy-making process are recognized in a standard framework...|$|R
