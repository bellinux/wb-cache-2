5|$|There are 150 unique {{players on}} 18 teams, each with {{thematic}} personalities in appearance, play style, and profanity. Teams also vary in skill set, and attributes such as defense, speed, strength, and teamwork. Examples include the Sea Cats (fast all-female team with European accents), the Marines (who wear camouflaged garb and use military jargon), the Demons (high strength attribute with demonic language), and the Black Dragons (ninjas with high agility and combat skills). Teams battle in 32 arenas—one <b>half</b> <b>with</b> traditional, open-style stadiums, {{and the other}} <b>half</b> <b>with</b> environmental obstacles, such as the underground mines. Minor power-ups including health, credits, and skill augments for individual players regenerate regularly on the field.|$|E
