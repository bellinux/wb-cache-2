5000|$|The Lincoln 815 Air Coupler, {{introduced}} April 7, 1942, is {{the standard}} ⅜-inch (10 mm) air <b>hose</b> <b>coupler</b> used today in almost every industry. Before the inventor retired, Lincoln had sold more than 50,000,000 units. Rudy Schneller said of his invention, [...] "They haven't made a single change since the original. Can you imagine? We'd all be riding Model Ts." ...|$|E

50|$|The freight pilot curved inward {{a little}} way below {{the bottom of the}} nose before sloping out again, to give more {{clearance}} to the <b>coupler</b> and <b>hoses.</b> The <b>coupler</b> wasfixed and protruded through a rectangular opening in the pilot.|$|R
5000|$|Flex <b>Hose</b> Rotary <b>Coupler</b> (FHRC) weight approx. 900 lb × 1 unit each on S1 & P1 Truss. The FHRC {{provides}} {{the transfer of}} liquid ammonia across the Thermal Radiator Rotary Joint (TRRJ) between the P1 (FHRC SN1001) & S1 (FHRC SN1002) truss segments and the Heat Rejection System Radiators (HRSRs).|$|R
5000|$|Kounotori 2's Unpressurized Logistics Carrier (ULC) {{carried an}} EP (Exposed Pallet) with two US ORUs (Orbital Replacement Units) attached: an FHRC (Flex <b>Hose</b> Rotary <b>Coupler)</b> and CTC-4 (Cargo Transportation Container-4). Both the FHRC and CTC-4 were {{transferred}} from Kounotori 2's EP {{to the space}} station's ELC-4 using the ISS's manipulator [...] "Dextre".|$|R
5000|$|Heat Rejection - Ammonia {{passes from}} the ATA through a two way {{path of the}} Flex <b>Hose</b> Rotary <b>Coupler</b> (FHRC) where heat {{captured}} while passing through the Heat Exchangers is directed to be expelled through the Heat Rejection System Radiators (HRSRs). The radiators are rotated by the Thermal Rotary Radiator Joint (TRRJ) which continually rotates the radiator wing for optimum cooling.|$|R
50|$|EVA One (Duration 6 hours, 52 minutes) -- With {{astronaut}} Stephen G. Bowen, Stefanyshyn-Piper transferred {{an empty}} nitrogen tank assembly from ESP3 to the shuttle’s cargo bay, transferred a new flex <b>hose</b> rotary <b>coupler</b> to ESP3 for future use, removed an insulation cover on the Kibo External Facility berthing mechanism, began cleaning and lubrication of the starboard SARJ, and replacement of its 11 trundle bearing assemblies.|$|R
50|$|The {{automatic}} center buffer coupler of AAR tight {{lock type}} at the coach end has a support frame which provides an anti-climbing protection. The coupler can be opened {{from the side}} by a lever. The design allows the use of screw coupler instead of center buffer coupler. Therefore a fixing plate for buffers is also provided. The inter-vehicle coupler for the supply of the 750 V from the generator car is located below the under-frame. Due to the moving situation 4 brake hoses are to be used at the coach end which are brought to two <b>hoses</b> behind the <b>coupler.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The chief {{competitor}} of {{both these}} couplers, more popular among serious modellers, was the Magne-Matic, a magnetically released knuckle coupler developed by Keith and Dale Edwards, and manufactured by Kadee, a company they started. While they closely resemble miniature Janney couplers, they are somewhat different mechanically, with the knuckle pivoting {{from the center}} of the coupler head, rather than from the side. A steel pin, designed to resemble an air brake <b>hose,</b> allows the <b>couplers</b> to be released magnetically; the design of the coupler head prevents this from happening unless the train is stopped or reversed with a mated pair of couplers directly over an uncoupling magnet. An earlier, mechanically tripped version of the design had a straight pin extending down from the knuckle itself, which engaged a diamond-shaped mechanical [...] "ramp" [...] between the rails, which had to be raised above rail height when uncoupling was desired.|$|R
