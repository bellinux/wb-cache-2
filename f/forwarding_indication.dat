40|$|Dental luting cements are {{commonly}} used in dentistry for cementation of prosthetic restoration. Many previous studies focused on the measurement of the cell viability as the method of cytotoxicity evaluation during biocompatibility study for the material. In this study, the biocompatibility of various dental luting cements were evaluated using the new method of cytokine release measurement {{in order to better}} simulate inflammatory reactions in animal or clinical model using two different oral cells; immortalized human gingival fibroblast and immortalized human oral keratinocytes. Cells were exposed to extractions of various commercially available dental luting cements for different durations. Cytokines of IL- 1 α and IL- 8 were measured from the supernatants of the cells and the results were then compared to the conventional MTT viability test. The result from the conventional cell viability study showed a relatively simple and straight <b>forward</b> <b>indication</b> that only one of the dental luting cements tested in this study was cytotoxic with increasing duration of exposure for both cells. Meanwhile, the result from the cytokine measurement study was much more complex at the time point they were measured, type of cells used for the study and the type of cytokines measured, all of which influenced the interpretation of the results. Hence, the better understanding of the cytokine release would be required for the application in biocompatibility evaluation...|$|R
40|$|The {{template}} carbonization {{method was}} utilized {{for the production}} of mesoporous carbons using a Turkish natural zeolite as a template. The major carbon precursor used was furfuryl alcohol. Furfuryl alcohol was polymerized and carbonized between 700 °C and 1000 °C in the channels of the natural zeolite. The structure of the zeolite template and carbons were investigated by surface analysis techniques, scanning electron microscopy, 13 C NMR and FTIR spectrometry, and powder X-ray diffraction. At the micrometer level, the carbon material templated with the natural zeolite had the same morphology as the zeolite. The porous carbon samples contained 9199 % C and minor amounts of oxygen. While the surface area of the carbon produced without templation was only 18 m 2 /g, the surface area of the carbons produced within the template was found to be in the range of 400800 m 2 /g. Average pore diameter of the porous carbons was measured as ca. 510 nm, demonstrating presence of mesoporous framework in the carbons. The 13 C NMR and FTIR spectra revealed that the carbons produced in the carbonization range of 7001000 °C contained some hydrogen and oxygen containing functional groups. The XRD results put <b>forward</b> <b>indications</b> to the presence of turbostratic structures and preservation of the structural regularity of the zeolite over extended distances in the carbons...|$|R

Unlike in other I/O frameworks, errors will still be synchronized with respect {{to the rest of the}} output stream. Of course, the program may also issue diagnostics to its standard err channel, as a convenience. But we defer that as a task for pf. If there’s a fatal error it is usually reported by closing the channel with an error <b>indication,</b> and lf <b>forwards</b> that <b>indication</b> as well.|$|R

The rate based {{congestion control}} algorithm dynamically regulates transmission rate of source end system according to feedback {{information from the}} network. In this paper, we described two rate based congestion control algorithms, Explicit <b>Forward</b> Congestion <b>Indication</b> (EFCI) and Explicit Rate Indication Congestion Avoidance (ERICA) developed by ATM forum. From the simulation results, we can observe that, both have cell drop problem at intermediate switch in ATM network. We then propose an improvement to ERICA scheme to overcome this proble...|$|R
50|$|The {{major focus}} of the INCRA is {{overhauling}} existing metrics used to calculate credit ratings. According to the project’s supporters, current evaluations focus solely on macroeconomic indicators while ignoring important political and socioeconomic factors. In addition to considering macroeconomic factors, the INCRA would take into account a country’s commitment {{to the rule of}} law, transparency, social cohesion, future resources, strategic capacity, implementation ability, and adaptability when calculating ratings. While acknowledging that no evaluation system can perfectly predict and prevent crises, the Bertelsmann Foundation was arguing that incorporating these <b>forward</b> looking <b>indications</b> would reduce global vulnerability to future financial crises.|$|R
40|$|Traffic {{management}} and congestion control are key issues in ATM networks. Congestion control schemes promises effective traffic {{management and}} it uses feedback {{information from the}} network to specify the maximum rate at which each source can transmit cells in to the network. In this paper, we considered an Explicit <b>Forward</b> Congestion <b>Indication</b> (EFCI) Congestion scheme, developed by ATM forum for ATM networks. This scheme has cell drop problem at intermediate switch and allowed cell rate at source terminals oscillates from lower values to higher values and vice versa. An enhancement to EFCI scheme is proposed. The simulation results shows that enhanced EFCI scheme gives better results than basic EFCI scheme...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{performance}} of different rate-based congestion control schemes for ABR services over broadband satellite networks (BSNs) interworking with ATM/BISDNs. The explicit <b>forward</b> congestion <b>indication</b> (EFCI) and explicit rate (ER) schemes are considered on their own in single loop end-to-end control. It is shown that the long feedback delay over satellite leads to sluggish control and large buffer requirements. To improve performance, delay-based modifications to the EFCI and ER schemes, known as DBCI and DBER schemes, are proposed to dynamically adjust the rate adaptation parameters according to the feedback delay. Simulation {{results show that the}} proposed DBCI and DBER schemes effectively reduces buffer congestion and starvation, without significantly reducing link utilization and fairness in the system. 1...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the performances of}} the EFCI-based (Explicit <b>Forward</b> Congestion <b>Indication)</b> and ER-based (Explicit Rate) algorithms for the rate-based flow control of the ABR (Available Bit Rate) traffic in an ATM network. We {{consider the case of}} two switches in tandem. We present several definitions of bottleneck, and provide conditions that determine whether the first, the second or both queues are bottleneck. We show that it is not necessarily the queue with the slowest transmission rate that is "responsible" for a bottleneck. We derive analytic formulas for the maximum queue length. We compare our results to those obtained by approximating a network by a simpler one, containing only the bottleneck switch. We show that the maximum queue lengths under the approximating approach may largely underestimate the ones obtained in the real network...|$|R
40|$|A Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET) is a {{self-configuring}} infrastructure less {{network of}} mobile devices connected by wireless. These are {{a kind of}} wireless Ad hoc Networks that usually has a routable networking environment on top of a Link Layer Ad hoc Network. The routing approach in MANET includes mainly three categories viz., Reactive Protocols, Proactive Protocols and Hybrid Protocols. These traditional routing schemes are not pertinent to the so called Intermittently Connected Mobile Ad hoc Network (ICMANET). ICMANET is a form of Delay Tolerant Network, where there never exists a complete end – to – end path between two nodes wishing to communicate. The intermittent connectivity araise when network is sparse or highly mobile. Routing in such a spasmodic environment is arduous. In this paper, we put <b>forward</b> the <b>indication</b> of prevailing routing approaches for ICMANET with their benefits and detriments...|$|R
40|$|We study both {{correctness}} {{and performance}} of the source/destination protocol of the Available Bit Rate (ABR) service in Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networks. Although the basic source/destination protocol for congestion management is relatively simple, the protocol specification has to cope with several "real-world" cases such as failures and delayed/lost feedback which may introduce complexity. Rigorous proofs of the correct functioning of the protocol based on a formal specification is necessary. We use a formal Extended Finite State Machine (EFSM) model {{to show that the}} ABR source/destination protocol is free of live-locks, so that under all conditions both Resource Management (RM) and data cells will be transmitted. We also show that the network options of Explicit <b>Forward</b> Congestion <b>Indication</b> (EFCI) and Explicit Rate (ER) interoperate correctly. While ensuring the correct functioning of the protocol, it is essential that pathological situations do not result in abysmal perf [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Business {{organizations}} {{are similar to}} living organisms. They need to adapt and react to changes within their environment. Similar to biological systems, business organizations {{need to have a}} system of “sensors” or metrics that will provide the necessary signals to the entity to react in a timely fashion. Thus, metrics are essential not only for measuring how the entity did in the past, and is doing at the present but also to provide some <b>forward</b> looking <b>indications.</b> Monitoring businesses are essential for mere survival, especially in this fast changing environment of E-Business and global economy. Since businesses and business activities are being conducted in the E-Business environment, existing measurements and techniques do not apply for today’ environment. In this paper we adopt a holistic view of the E-Business segment of corporations and develop a new comprehensive set of measurements. The main {{purpose of this paper is}} to discuss a balanced scorecard approach for the electronic environment. We also develop a unique innovative approach for evaluating the level of companies’ digitization, and provide an illustrative example and a description of the benefits associated with our model...|$|R
40|$|This article {{investigates the}} {{representation}} in UK national newspaper articles between August 1987 and April 2006 {{of the possibility}} of abrupt climate change. It focuses primarily on representations {{of the possibility of}} a collapse in the Thermohaline Circulation (THC) and uses coverage of the possibility of a collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) as a counterpoint. The article draws on a content analysis of newspaper articles and interviews with journalists, scientists and politicians. The THC issue was found to have received over three times more coverage than the WAIS issue despite both 'collapses' being deemed as equally unlikely by the IPCC. It is shown that the representation of the THC issue as the 'Gulf Stream' has been central to its media popularisation, but also that this representation has caused adverse reactions from some within the scientific community. Over 80 per cent of newspaper articles covering the THC issue put <b>forward</b> no <b>indication</b> of the probability of collapse or contained contradictory probabilities. It is suggested that the relatively large amount of coverage given to the THC issue, the absence of accompanying probabilistic statements, and the use of sensationalist headlines have had a significant influence on public perceptions of the climate future for the UK...|$|R

40|$|We {{set out to}} {{determine}} the diagnostic value of computed tomographic (CT) scans {{in relation to the}} radiation dose, tumor incidence, and tumor mortality by radiation for hemodynamically stable pediatric patients with blunt abdominal injury. We focused on the changes in management because of new information obtained by CT. CT scans for suspected pediatric abdominal injury performed in our accident and emergency department were retrieved from the radiology registry and analyzed for: injury and hemodynamic parameters, changes in therapy, and radiological interventions. The dose length product (DLP) was used to calculate the effective dose (ED) and with the BEIR VII report we calculated the estimated induced lifetime tumor and mortality risk. Seventy-two patients underwent abdominal CT scanning for suspicion of abdominal injury and eight patients were excluded for hemodynamic instability, leaving 64 hemodynamically stable patients. Four patients died (6 %). On the remaining 60 patients, only one laparotomy was performed for suspicion of duodenal perforation. Only in three out of the 64 hemodynamically stable cases (5 %), a CT scan brought <b>forward</b> an <b>indication</b> for intervention or change in management. One patient was suspected of a duodenal perforation and underwent a laparotomy. A grade II hepatic laceration, but no duodenal, injury was found. Two patients underwent embolization of the splenic artery. One for an arterial blush caused by splenic laceration as was observed on the contrast enhanced-CT. Patient remained stable and during the angiogram the blush had disappeared. The second patient underwent (prophylactic) selective arterial embolization for having sustained a grade V splenic injury. The median radiation dosage was 11. 43 mSv (range 1. 19 - 23. 76 mSv) in our patients. The use of the BEIR VII methodology results in an estimated increase in the lifetime tumor incidence of 0. 17 % (range, 0. 05 - 0. 67 %) and an estimated increase in lifetime tumor incidence of 0. 08 % (0. 02 - 0. 28 %). The results of our data suggest that the use of CT scans can largely be avoided in hemodynamically stable children with blunt abdominal injury...|$|R
40|$|Social {{pressure}} for sustainability {{has become a}} significant factor in Australian business. Made popular by a variety of diverse social movements that employ various tactics, sustainability is increasingly being debated in boardrooms and work areas of both large and small businesses. In this research, sustainability issues are treated as a set of a wider range of obligatory and externally imposed (OEI) issues that are increasingly confronting contemporary business. Of interest to this research is how senior managers deal with sustainability issues. While some businesses excel in dealing with OEI issues, others prevaricate. This research focuses on those businesses that appear to excel in resolving sustainability issues to explore how senior managers deal with sustainability issues. Such understanding is essential for contemporary practising senior managers, as it provides guidance for management behaviour that will enable sustainability and other OEI issues to be dealt with. The author&# 039;s effort to understand how senior managers deal with sustainability issues has led to the first business context application of Harr&eacute;&# 039;s positioning theory. A social constructionist approach, positioning theory is concerned with ordinary conversations, and presumes that these are the building blocks of all other discursive phenomena. The resulting theory builds on positioning theory and provides a point of departure to conduct related research on other organizations that excel in dealing with OEI issues and those that prevaricate. With positioning theory it has been shown that, in dealing with sustainability issues, senior managers engage in a range of positioning of themselves and others. In doing so, power and knowledge have been considered in the light of Foucault&# 039;s unique and penetrating concepts. This has led to the proposed augmentation of positioning theory to include a concept of social flux, which is put <b>forward</b> as an <b>indication</b> of social order or culture. Through this development, it has shown how senior managers confront opposition and reinforce support to enable them to achieve and preserve sustainability objectives. In practical terms, senior managers alter four components of the social order to align the culture with the issues that need to be dealt with. These components - rights, duties, morals and actions - are parameters that senior managers tune or level when they deal with sustainability issues. When the social order is appropriately tuned or levelled, it is aligned with the issues that need to be dealt with. That alignment enables issues to be resolved in a way appropriate for the organization...|$|R
40|$|Cue: In Malawi, Non Governmental Organisations are {{partners}} with government in making efforts to uplift the livelihoods of the communities. In {{this age of}} the HIV pandemic, government resources are barely enough to go round all those who need them most in the health sector. It {{is for this reason}} that the Adventist Development and Relief Agency-ADRA- has come up with an innovative idea of introducing the growing of soya beans in some communities. The crop can be used as a cash crop and it is also a very rich legume in protein which is transforming the lives of malnourished children as well as the sick including those whose ailments are associated with HIV/AIDS. Let us join Patrick Mphaka as he visits one such community in Traditional Authority Kuntaja in Blantyre District. IN:		?I am walking along ?? OUT:		??I am Patrick Mphaka. (Song continues and fades out) ? DUR?N	 3 ? 15 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: And Patrick was reporting on a project being run by the Adventist Development and Relief Agency - ADRA. Transcript Mphaka	I am walking along a narrow path leading to a communal field which is 70 to 100 metres from the last house in the boundary of the village. From here I can see a group of people most of them leaning <b>forward,</b> perhaps an <b>indication</b> that they are picking the soya beans. And I am almost there now and I can see a well tended piece of land. It seems they also grew maize on this land because there are some left-over husks all around me. (Song) The women and few men around here have broken into singing, praising the development taking place around here, one of them being the introduction of soya beans which they are mentioning in their song, which they are claiming is improving the nutrition status of their malnourished children and home based patients. Chavula	My name is Mercy Chavula. I am the chairperson for the Orphan and Home Based Care Committee in our village. Today we came here to harvest our soya beans from the community garden. Mphaka	I am wondering, is it very beneficial to grow Soya beans here? Chavula	Initially we had no idea that the crop is this nutritious. We used to know that there is soya and we used to see it. But when this ADRA project started, they opened our eyes to the great potential of soya. We now extract milk from soya; can make cakes using its flour, and can also apply the flour into any other relish to make it more nutritious. We use soya to feed the under-nourished orphans and the sick. But of course, everybody else eats as well. There is a noticeable improvement in the health of children who used to be under-nourished, and the sick gain some appetite with soya beans. Mphaka	What is the future of soya beans with the phasing out of the ADRA project next year? Chavula	We are not very worried. I think we have been empowered enough to continue. We know how to prepare it nutritiously for food, and above all, we know how to grow it. We feel that very soon, we shall be growing it in larger quantities for sale as well. We have been made to understand that the price at the market is higher than other crops. Mphaka	(Song) As the harvesting of soya beans continues with prospects of increased acreage in future, so does the singing. A sign of celebration and satisfaction with the way the health of the community is being improved. From Blantyre, Malawi, I am Patrick Mphaka. (Song continues and fades out). End of track. Mercy Chavula of the Orphan and Home Based Care Committee in Kuntaja traditional authority, Blantyre, Malawi, explains the benefits of growing soya, a highly nutritious crop which is having a major impact on the health of children and the sick in her com...|$|R
