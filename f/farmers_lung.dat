40|$|<b>Farmers</b> <b>lung</b> {{disease is}} a common form of {{hypersensitivity}} pneumonitis (HP) and is characterized by inflammation and granuloma formation in the lung. Interferon-gamma {{is important for the}} expression of granulomatous diseases caused by infectious agents; however, the role this mediator in regulating expression of the granulomatous response to inhaled antigen is not known. To evaluate this, we compared the response to inhaled antigen of mice that do not express the gene coding for interferon-gamma (GKO) with that of their normal littermates (WT). GKO and WT mice on a BALB/c background were exposed to 150 microg of the thermophilic bacteria Saccharopolyspora rectivirgula or saline alone, for three consecutive days a week, for 3 wk. After exposure to antigen, WT mice developed a marked granulomatous inflammation associated with an increase in lung weight and numbers of cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL). Although GKO mice also exhibited an increase in lung weight and numbers of cells in BAL fluid, they developed minimal inflammation and no granulomas after a similar exposure to antigen. To further evaluate if the lack of a response to antigen in GKO mice was due to lack of IFN-gamma, we replaced this mediator via intraperitoneal injections. When given replacement IFN-gamma, the GKO mice developed granulomatous inflammation in the lung. These studies show that IFN-gamma is essential for the expression of hypersensitivity pneumonitis...|$|E

40|$|Actinomycetes {{have been}} used with {{enormous}} success in industrial processes; however, {{little is known about}} biofilm development by these filamentous microbes, and the presence of community development on insoluble cellulosic substrates such as cellulose. Cellulose is the most abundant biopolymer and renewable energy source on Earth, and its decomposition, which is carried out almost exclusively by microorganisms, is a key step in the cycling of carbon in the biosphere. It has long been known that cellulolytic bacteria may adhere to their insoluble substrate as it is degraded, although surprisingly little is known about microbial growth, colonization and community development on insoluble cellulosic substrates and non-nutritive surfaces. Previous investigations indicated that two Gram-positive cellulolytic soil bacteria, Cellulomonas uda, a facultative aerobe, and Clostridium phytofermentans, an obligate anaerobe, specifically adhered to nutritive surfaces forming a biofilm, but cells did not colonize non-nutritive surfaces. In this study is hypothesized that biofilm formation is a general strategy used by microbes in the degradation of insoluble substrates, and that it may serve as a means for microbes to secure a nutrient and persist in their environments. The objective {{of this study was to}} characterize biofilms produced by Thermobifida fusca, a Gram-positive cellulolytic actinomycete isolated from compost that rapidly degrades cellulose by means of a well-characterized extracellular cellulase system, and is a causative agent of <b>Farmers</b> <b>Lung,</b> the most common type of hypersensitivity pneumonitis. T. fusca was cultured with dialysis tubing as a nutritive surface for biofilm formation, and by using non-nutritive surfaces such as glass, plastic, metal and Teflon. ^ Dialysis tubing was colonized by T. fusca aleuriospores but not by mycelial pellets. Surface-attached growth, examined by confocal scanning laser and scanning electron microscopy revealed structures resembling biofilms with cells embedded in fibrous material suggestive of an exopolymeric (EPS) matrix. T. fusca cells possessed higher hydrophobicity than C. uda and C. phytofermentans cells implicating higher capacity to bind to surfaces. DNase 1 inhibited biofilm formation when assayed on microtiter plates suggesting a role for extracellular DNA in T. fusca biofilm formation. Concanavalin-A bound to the EPS material of biofilms and mycelial pellets, indicating alpha-linked D-mannosyl and/or alpha-linked D-glucosyl residues. The carbohydrate content of biofilms and mycelial pellets increased during growth. T. fusca biofilm formation is reduced when lack or excess of nutrients such as; iron, nitrogen and salt. Robust biofilms were developed between pHs 7 and 9, whereas minimum biofilms were produced at pH 3 and 11. Cellulose degradation rate and celE (endoglucanase E 5) expression was similar for T. fusca biofilms and mycelial pellets. Also, results of this study indicate that in the life cycle of this actinomycete, cellulose is specifically colonized by aleuriospores, which germinate and degrade cellulose, ultimately developing into biofilms encased in a carbohydrate-containing EPS matrix, a hallmark of biofilm production. ...|$|E

Only extracts from a Penicillium sp. and a Streptomyces sp. precipitated with a number of sera, when extracts from the 12 most commonly isolated fungi, from six thermophilic actinomycetes other than M. faeni and Thermoactinomyces vulgaris, and from two thermophilic bacteria were tested. There was no correlation between disease and seropositivity. All sera reacted to at least one of 60 carbol-saline and trichloracetic acid extracts from 30 samples of hay, grain and dust. Although sera from personnel on both FLD and non-FLD farms precipitated with 16 % and 19 % of these extracts respectively, reactivity to extracts from FLD farms was greater on average than to those from non-FLD farms. When tested by several serological methods against extracts of a type culture of M. faeni and by double diffusion against <b>farmer's</b> <b>lung</b> hay (FLH) and extracts of local isolates of M. faeni, 91 % of all clinical cases of <b>farmer's</b> <b>lung</b> were serologically positive but no one test was adequate for determining sensitisation. Fifty-four per cent of sera from FLD and also from non-FLD farms were positive in at least one test. Sixty-nine per cent of seropositive personnel on FLD farms were also symptomatic. The occurrence of symptoms apparently correlated with the higher concentrations of M. faeni encountered on FLD farms...|$|R
40|$|During {{investigations}} into <b>farmer's</b> <b>lung</b> disease it was noticed that Micropolyspora faeni (MF) was isolated and identified with ease, but difficulty was {{encountered in the}} identification of Thermoactinomyces vulgaris (TV), although an organism resembling TV was frequently isolated. Extracts prepared from the isolates resembling TV (called Thermoactinomyces vulgaris variant, TVV) when tested against the standard TV antiserum by double diffusion, did not produce any precipitin lines. When TVV extracts were tested against the serum of a patient from whom TVV had been isolated from the sputum, +++ precipitin lines were observed. With the TVV extracts the authors have demonstrated the existence of a serologically distinct strain of TV, and also {{that it would be a}} useful addition to the routine testing of antibodies to <b>farmer's</b> <b>lung</b> disease...|$|R

Chest {{symptoms}} and farmer's lung: a community survey. <b>Farmer's</b> <b>lung</b> {{is one of}} the commonest causes of extrinsic allergic alveolitis, but there have been few studies of representative samples of farmers. A survey was carried out in Devon among 91 farmers and their families in order to estimate the prevalence of respiratory {{symptoms and}} of positive precipitin reactions to thermophilic fungi. Answers to a questionnaire about respiratory symptoms and smoking habits revealed among the men a prevalence of symptoms comparable with that found in other surveys of agricultural populations in the United Kingdom but with a lower proportion of smokers. A positive answer to a question about attacks of breathlessness associated with fever or shivering appeared to differentiate people suffering from <b>farmer's</b> <b>lung.</b> Twenty-three per cent of the population had precipitins to Micropolyspora faeni and two of these individuals also had precipitins to other fungi. There were statistically significant differences in the proportions of positive precipitin tests found in smokers, ex-smokers, and non-smokers. Six known cases of <b>farmer's</b> <b>lung</b> were included in the sample and all had positive precipitins...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Surfactant protein A (SP-A) acts as {{an immune}} system {{modulator}} in the lungs and may therefore {{be involved in the}} pathogenesis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis. METHODS: The levels of SP-A in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid were measured in 20 subjects with acute <b>farmer's</b> <b>lung,</b> 16 asymptomatic dairy farmers, and 14 normal controls. Eight patients had a second evaluation after one month of treatment by either contact avoidance (n = 3) or oral prednisolone (20 or 25 mg/day, n = 5). Chest radiographs and lung function measurements were also obtained in all farmers, twice in those re-evaluated after treatment. RESULTS: Patients with acute <b>farmer's</b> <b>lung</b> had significantly higher levels of SP-A than asymptomatic farmers and normal controls (p = 0. 005) with mean (SE) values of 1. 43 (0. 29) micrograms/ml, 0. 62 (0. 09) microgram/ml, and 0. 68 (0. 11) microgram/ml, respectively. In eight subjects tested after one month of treatment the level of SP-A was unchanged although all were clinically improved. No correlations were seen between levels of SP-A in BAL fluid and numbers of BAL cells, lung function measurements, or chest radiographic scores. CONCLUSION: Although the level of SP-A is increased in the BAL fluid of patients with acute <b>farmer's</b> <b>lung,</b> it is not correlated with clinical abnormalities of this disease...|$|R

40|$|<b>Farmer's</b> <b>Lung</b> is a {{respiratory}} disease caused by inhalation of microspores that grow in warm, damp vegetable material. Although {{the disease has}} been widely recognized in many countries, there are only 11 case reports published in Canada. The incidence is likely significant in many rural areas of this country. Inhalation of the microspores produces an allergic reaction in the alveoli of the lung (Arthus Type III). The symptoms are usually dry cough, dyspnea, but little wheezing. Signs are fever, and crackling rales. Antibody precipitins to specific microspores are usually present. Chest X-rays may show miliary lesions and later pulmonary fibrosis. The acute attack is treated with steroids, and prevented by avoiding exposure to mouldy vegetable material.

40|$|The {{ability of}} several cell wall {{fractions}} of Micropolyspora faeni, a thermophilic actinomycete associated with <b>farmer's</b> <b>lung</b> disease, to activate complement is reported. Cell walls, obtained by mechanical disruption, were purified by enzyme treatment and chemical extractions. Fractions containing the most purified cell walls were most active in consuming complement, {{as measured by}} reduction of hemolytic complement levels of normal human serum. Cell wall fractions activated the alternative complement pathway, as shown by monitoring the conversion of C 3 proactivator (factor B) to C 3 activator (activated factor B) {{in the presence of}} specific cation chelators. Selective degradation of cell walls by lysozyme resulted in a decreased ability to consume complement and implicated peptidoglycan as the major complement-reactive component. The role of this nonspecific complement activation in relation to <b>farmer's</b> <b>lung</b> disease is discussed...|$|R
