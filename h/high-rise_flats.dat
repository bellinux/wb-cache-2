25|$|A {{large group}} of people fled or were chased into the car park of Rossville Flats. This area was like a courtyard, {{surrounded}} on three sides by <b>high-rise</b> <b>flats.</b> The soldiers opened fire, killing one civilian and wounding six others. This fatality, Jackie Duddy, was running alongside a priest, Father Edward Daly, {{when he was shot}} in the back.|$|E
25|$|The Second World War {{destroyed}} {{large parts}} of the city centre and during the Soviet occupation many new buildings were erected – notably the new Vanemuine Theater. The effects of the war are still witnessed by the relative abundance of parks and greenery in the historic centre. Typical Soviet-style neighbourhoods of blocks of <b>high-rise</b> <b>flats</b> were built between World War II and the restoration of Estonian independence in 1991, the largest such district being Annelinn.|$|E
25|$|UVF snipers {{continued}} to {{fire from the}} <b>high-rise</b> <b>flats</b> on the hill at Springmartin Road. About three hours after the shooting of Pedlow, a bullet fatally struck a 13-year-old Catholic girl, Martha Campbell, as she walked along Springhill Avenue. She was {{among a group of}} young girls and a witness said the firing must have been directed at himself and the girls, as nobody else was in the area at the time. Reliable loyalist sources say that the schoolgirl was shot by the UVF.|$|E
50|$|Templar House was a <b>high-rise</b> <b>flat</b> (apartment) {{building}} in the New Lodge neighbourhood of Belfast, Northern Ireland, notable for its controversial role as a British Army observation post during The Troubles in Northern Ireland. The post included high-technology observation devices such as electronic monitoring equipment, cameras, and night vision.|$|R
5000|$|Roald Dahl parodied {{the nursery}} rhyme {{in his poetry}} book Rhyme Stew (1989), where Mary {{responds}} to the narrator that she is unable to tell how her garden grows, since: [...] "I live with my brat in a <b>high-rise</b> <b>flat,</b> so {{how in the world}} should I know?!" ...|$|R
25|$|In 1976 a feature-length {{movie was}} released, written by Clement and La Frenais, which was {{directed}} by Michael Tuchner. By this time both lads had moved house (Bob and Thelma to their detached house, and Terry to a <b>high-rise</b> <b>flat).</b> Terry now has a Finnish girlfriend called Christina ("Chris"), played by Mary Tamm.|$|R
25|$|The first council {{houses were}} built in the Dimbles area of the city in the 1930s. The {{outbreak}} of World War II brought over 2,000 evacuees from industrialised areas. However, {{due to the lack of}} heavy industry in the city, Lichfield escaped lightly, although there were air raids in 1940 and 1941 and three Lichfeldians were killed. Just outside the city, Wellington Bombers flew out of Fradley Aerodrome, which was known as RAF Lichfield. After the war the council built many new houses in the 1960s, including some <b>high-rise</b> <b>flats,</b> while the late 1970s and early 1980s saw the construction of a large housing estate at Boley Park in the south-east of the city. The city's population tripled between 1951 and the late 1980s.|$|E
25|$|A third {{unrelated}} sniper attack, {{which resulted}} in the death of a British soldier, was carried out by the IRA in the New Lodge, North Belfast, on 3 August 1992. Two other soldiers were wounded by snipers in the New Lodge, which was suitable for sniper attacks {{because of the number of}} <b>high-rise</b> <b>flats</b> in the area, in November 1993 and January 1994. Two people were arrested and a loaded rifle recovered in the aftermath of the latter incident. On 30 December 1993 Guardsman Daniel Blinco became the last soldier killed by snipers in South Armagh before the first IRA ceasefire in 1994. His killing, along with the reaction of the MP of his constituency, was covered by the BBC´s Inside Ulster, which also showed Blinco's abandoned helmet and the hole made by the sniper's bullet on the wall of a pub.|$|E
500|$|The {{decline of}} the mining {{industry}} in the 1950s caused a severe economic slump in Brownhills, which continues to this day. The local authority has created a [...] "Townscape Masterplan" [...] for the regeneration of Brownhills, which involves increased leisure provision, {{the improvement of the}} town centre's shopping facilities, a new transport interchange incorporating Park and Ride facilities and cycle links to the town centre and the National Cycle Route, and the refurbishment of run-down properties. The plan also involves the potential construction of a bypass to relieve the heavily congested High Street. In addition to these developments, a grant of over £350,000 was obtained to fund {{the creation of a new}} [...] "mini town square", and the demolition of blocks of <b>high-rise</b> <b>flats</b> in the town has begun.|$|E

50|$|In {{his best}} known role, High Times, McCole portrays Rab, an {{unemployed}} stoner {{who lives with}} his best friend in a bleak <b>high-rise</b> <b>flat</b> in Glasgow. The series, which received the 2004 BAFTA Scotland Best Drama Award, also features McCole's older brother, Paul. McCole credits the realism of his role to growing up in similar surroundings in Glasgow's Castlemilk project.|$|R
2500|$|The {{policy of}} {{tenement}} demolition {{is now considered}} to have been short-sighted, wasteful and largely unsuccessful. Many of Glasgow's worst tenements were refurbished into desirable accommodation in the 1970s and 1980s and the policy of demolition is considered to have destroyed many fine examples of a [...] "universally admired architectural" [...] style. The Glasgow Housing Association took ownership of the housing stock from the city council on 7 March 2003, and has begun a £96million clearance and demolition programme to clear and demolish many of the <b>high-rise</b> <b>flats.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{violence}} {{began when}} a car bomb, planted by Ulster loyalists, exploded outside a crowded public house in the mainly Irish nationalist and Catholic district of Ballymurphy. UVF snipers then opened fire on the survivors from an abandoned <b>high-rise</b> <b>flat.</b> This began the worst fighting in Northern Ireland since the suspension of the Parliament of Northern Ireland and the imposition of direct rule from London. For {{the rest of the}} night and throughout the next day, local IRA units fought gun battles with both the UVF and British Army. Most of the fighting took place along the interface between the Catholic Ballymurphy and Ulster Protestant Springmartin housing estates, and the British Army base that sat between them.|$|R

50|$|The city's {{riverbank}} {{has been}} particularly transformed - from industrial dereliction caused by the decline of shipbuilding into to an entertainment and residential centrepiece. The banks of the Clyde have become a playground for property developers, with office blocks and <b>high-rise</b> luxury <b>flats</b> taking {{the place of the}} old shipyards, granaries, wharves and docks.|$|R
