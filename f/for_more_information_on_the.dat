Fascinated, Vandersteen searched <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> subject. He rediscovered Hergé with The Adventures of Tintin in Le Petit Vingtième, {{but also the}} realistic work of Hal Foster in Prince Valiant. But {{it took a few}} more years before this fascination translated into steady publication of his own comics. Meanwhile, his first published drawings appeared in Entre Nous, the internal magazine of L'Innovation.|$|E

25|$|The Source Book (van Heijenoort 1967), {{perhaps the}} most {{important}} book ever published on the history of logic and of the foundations of mathematics, is an anthology of translations. It begins with the first complete translation of Frege's 1879 Begriffsschrift, which is followed by 45 historically important short pieces on mathematical logic and axiomatic set theory, originally published between 1889 and 1931. The anthology ends with Gödel's landmark paper on the incompletability of Peano arithmetic. <b>For</b> <b>more</b> <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> period covered by this anthology, see Grattan-Guinness (2000).|$|E
25|$|The fossils {{found that}} {{date back to}} the Precambrian era lack {{distinct}} structures since there were no skeletal forms during this period. Skeletons did not arise until the Cambrian Era when oxygen levels increased. This is because skeletons require collagen, which uses Vitamin C as a cofactor, which requires oxygen. <b>For</b> <b>more</b> <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rise of oxygen see the section on oxygen. The majority of fossils from this Era come from either Mistaken Point on the East Coast of Canada or the Ediacara Hills in Southern Australia.|$|E

25|$|As a {{response}} to the spree killing, Australian State and Territory governments placed certain restrictions on semi-automatic centre-fire rifles, repeating shotguns (holding more than 5 shots) and high-capacity rifle magazines. In addition to this, limitations were also put into place on low-capacity repeating shotguns and rim-fire semi-automatic rifles. Though this resulted in stirring controversy, opposition to the new laws was overcome by media reporting of the massacre and mounting public opinion {{in the wake of the}} shootings (see Gun politics in Australia <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 1996 legislation).|$|E
25|$|Besek Mountain, {{like much}} of the Metacomet Ridge, is {{composed}} of basalt, also called traprock, a volcanic rock. The mountain formed {{near the end of}} the Triassic Period with the rifting apart of the North American continent from Africa and Eurasia. Lava welled up from the rift and solidified into sheets of strata hundreds of feet thick. Subsequent faulting and earthquake activity tilted the strata, creating the cliffs and ridgeline of Besek Mountain. Hot, dry upper slopes, cool, moist ravines, and mineral-rich ledges of basalt talus produce a combination of microclimate ecosystems on the mountain that support plant and animal species uncommon in greater Connecticut. Besek Mountain is also an important raptor migration path. (See Metacomet Ridge <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> geology and ecosystem of Besek Mountain).|$|E
