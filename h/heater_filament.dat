50|$|Valve preamplifiers use triodes or low-noise pentodes (EF86). Mains hum {{from the}} <b>heater</b> <b>filaments</b> is a {{potential}} problem in low-level valve stages. Modern amplifiers invariably run from the mains; as there is little need to minimise costs in expensive valve amplifiers, the heater supply is often rectified and even regulated to reduce hum to an absolute minimum.|$|R
5000|$|The British [...] "Radiac Survey Meter No. 2" [...] {{dates from}} 1953-1956, and {{required}} now-obsolete 15 and 30 volt high voltage batteries and a 1.5 volt standard cell, the latter used {{to power the}} valve <b>heater</b> <b>filaments</b> and meter illumination bulb). There was also a training unit, [...] which measured 0-300 mR/h, and ran on four 30 volt batteries plus one 1.5V cell for the filaments.

5000|$|Special [...] "octal" [...] {{connectors}} {{with either}} 8 or 11 pins, {{almost identical to}} octal relay sockets or tube sockets, were used to connect power supplies to some tube audio amplifiers, transmitters and tranceivers (especially in amateur radio models). Female sockets were installed on the power supply and male sockets (with exposed pins) on the radio equipment. Cable assemblies with mating connectors were also readily available. These connections transferred anode positive voltage (typically 600 VDC for Heathkit, 800 VDC for Collins), grid negative bias (-130 VDC), 6.3 and 12.6 VAC for <b>heaters</b> (<b>filaments),</b> and control functions (remote mains switching).|$|R
50|$|The {{most popular}} variant from the {{original}} 12BV7 was the 12BY7A. In this case, the A suffix is used to indicate a backwards-compatible revision to the original specification. Specifically, the <b>heater</b> <b>filament</b> had been redesigned to further protect it from the potentially damaging voltage spikes which were known to occur when the tube heater circuits were wired in series rather than parallel. All of the other design specifications, including warmup time, were identical to the 12BY7.|$|E
5000|$|Developed by the German {{physicist}} and chemist Walther Nernst in 1897 at Goettingen University, these lamps were {{about twice as}} efficient as carbon filament lamps and they emitted a more [...] "natural" [...] light (more similar in spectrum to daylight).The lamps were quite successfully marketed for a time, although they eventually lost out to the more-efficient tungsten filament incandescent light bulb.One disadvantage of the Nernst design was that the ceramic rod was not electrically conductive at room temperature so the lamps needed a separate <b>heater</b> <b>filament</b> to heat the ceramic hot enough to begin conducting electricity on its own.|$|E
5000|$|In 1925, Rogers Sr. {{invented the}} world's first {{alternating}} current (AC) <b>heater</b> <b>filament</b> cathode for a radio tube, which then enabled radios {{to be powered}} by ordinary transformer-coupled household electric current. This was a breakthrough in the technology and became {{a key factor in}} popularizing radio reception. After this invention radios became far more commonplace in the world. The All American Five {{is an example of a}} vacuum tube radio that utilized five tubes with heater filaments series-connected to produce a total AC voltage demand that matched the 120 volts AC supplied at the wall socket.

50|$|Modern CCD and CMOS-based sensors offer many {{advantages}} over their tube counterparts. These include {{a lack of}} image lag, high overall picture quality, high light sensitivity and dynamic range, a better signal-to-noise ratio and significantly higher reliability and ruggedness. Other advantages include {{the elimination of the}} respective high and low-voltage power supplies required for the electron beam and <b>heater</b> <b>filament,</b> elimination of the drive circuitry for the focusing coils, no warm-up time and a significantly lower overall power consumption. Despite these advantages, acceptance and incorporation of solid-state sensors into television and video cameras was not immediate. One reason was that early sensors were not able to beat tubes, in terms of resolution or performance, and initially were mostly relegated to consumer-grade video recording equipment.|$|E

The Naval Postgraduate School is joining in the Navy's Free Electron Laser effort by constructing a scaled-down version of the naval system [...] the NPS FEL. Our first research goal is to better understand the current thermionic cathode used in the NPS FEL system, the Eimac Y- 845. This thesis will explore the outgassing of these cathodes as well as chart <b>heater</b> <b>filament</b> voltage vs. temperature, an important factor for understanding the operational regime the cathode will be in (primarily photoemission, or thermionic, or both). Additionally, we aim to examine a new type of Cesium Reservoir Dispenser Photocathode currently being built by the University of Maryland. Dispenser photocathodes are a promising technology in that they may have much longer lifetimes than other types of high quantum efficiency photocathodes. The concern with this new style of cathode relates to cesium release into the photoinjector cavity. We aim to ascertain the rates of cesium emission that users may encounter when utilizing these cathodes. This data will help determine if operational cesium dispenser photocathodes have low enough cesium emission for in-gun testing and use. Outstanding ThesisUS Navy (USN) autho...|$|E

40|$|Here, we seek {{to control}} {{cellular}} development by devising a means through which cells can be subjected to a microheated environment in standard culture conditions. Numerous techniques have been devised for controlling cellular function and development via manipulation of surface environmental cues at the micro- and nanoscale. It is well understood that temperature {{plays a significant role}} in the rate of cellular activities, migratory behavior (thermotaxis), and in some cases, protein expression. Yet, the effects and possible utilization of micrometer-scale temperature fields in cell cultures have not been explored. Toward this end, two types of thermally isolated microheated substrates were designed and fabricated, one with standard backside etching beneath a dielectric film and another with a combination of surface and bulk micromachining and backside etching. The substrates were characterized with infrared microscopy, finite element modeling, scanning electron microscopy, stylus profilometry, and electrothermal calibrations. Neuron culture studies were conducted on these substrates to 1) examine the feasibility of using a microheated environment to achieve patterned cell growth and 2) selectively accelerate neural development on regions less than 100 $mu m$wide. Results show that attached neurons, grown on microheated regions set at 37 $~^circ C$, extended processes substantially faster than those incubated at 25 $~^circ C$on the same substrate. Further, unattached neurons were positioned precisely along the length of the <b>heater</b> <b>filament</b> (operating at 45 $~^circ C$) using free convection currents. These preliminary findings indicate that microheated substrates may be used to direct cellular development spatially in a practical manner. $hfillhbox[1414]...|$|E
2500|$|Batteries {{provided}} the voltages required by tubes in early radio sets. Three different voltages were generally required, using three different batteries {{designated as the}} A, B, and C battery. The [...] "A" [...] battery or LT (low-tension) battery {{provided the}} <b>filament</b> voltage. Tube <b>heaters</b> were designed for single, double or triple-cell lead-acid batteries, giving nominal heater voltages of 2 V, 4 V or 6 V. In portable radios, dry batteries were sometimes used with 1.5 or 1 V <b>heaters.</b> Reducing <b>filament</b> consumption improved {{the life span of}} batteries. By 1955 {{towards the end of the}} tube era, tubes using only 50 mA down to as little as 10 mA for the heaters had been developed.|$|R
50|$|Halogen <b>heaters</b> {{comprise}} tungsten <b>filaments</b> in sealed quartz envelopes, {{mounted in}} front of a metal reflector in a plastic case. They operate at a higher temperature than Nichrome wire heaters but not as high as incandescent light bulbs, radiating primarily in the infrared spectrum. They convert up to 86% of their input power to radiant energy, losing the remainder to conductive and convective heat. The halogen cycle reduces the darkening of the quartz envelope and lengthens the life of the filament.|$|R
5000|$|Second figure {{group is}} the number of useful {{elements}} (including the heater if this is separate from the cathode); in metal tubes the shell counts as one element. Internal shielding also counts, but base shielding does not. Electrodes connected together internally are counted as one element. There is an inconsistency in the way tapped <b>heaters</b> or <b>filaments</b> are counted. For example, the 12BH7 (double triode with separate cathodes) counts the centre tapped heater as one useful element, whereas the 12BY7 (pentode) counts the centre tapped heater as two useful elements. There are also inconsistencies in the way internal screens are treated. In the 6BX6 (pentode with g3 brought to its own pin), the screen around the assembly is not counted, whereas the 6BR7 (also a pentode with g3 brought to its own pin) has its similar screen included.|$|R
40|$|The surface {{conversion}} H-minus {{ion source}} employs two 60 mil tungsten filaments which are approximately 17 centimeters in length. These filaments are heated to approximately 2, 800 degrees centigrade by 95 [...] 100 amperes of DC heater current. The arc is struck at a 120 hertz rate, for 800 microseconds and is generally run at 30 amperes peak current. Although sputtering {{is considered a}} contributing factor in {{the demise of the}} filament, evaporation is of greater concern. If the peak arc current can be maintained with less average <b>heater</b> current, the <b>filament</b> evaporation rate for this arc current will diminish. In the vacuum of an ion source, the authors expect the filaments to retain much of their heat throughout a 1 millisecond (12 % duty) loss of heater current. A circuit to eliminate 100 ampere <b>heater</b> currents from <b>filaments</b> during the arc pulse was developed. The magnetic field due to the 100 ampere current tends to hold electrons to the filament, decreasing the arc current. By eliminating this magnetic field, the arc should be more efficient, allowing the filaments to run at a lower average heater current. This should extend the filament lifetime. The circuit development and preliminary filament results are discussed...|$|R
50|$|The tetrode {{functions}} {{in a similar}} way to the triode, from which it was developed. A current through the <b>heater</b> or <b>filament</b> heats the cathode, which causes it to emit electrons by thermionic emission. A positive voltage is applied between the plate and cathode, causing a flow of electrons from the cathode to plate through the two grids. A varying voltage applied to the control grid can control this current, causing variations in the plate current. With a resistive or other load in the plate circuit, the varying current will result in a varying voltage at the plate. With proper biasing, this voltage will be an amplified (but inverted) version of the AC voltage applied to the control grid, thus the tetrode can provide voltage gain. In the tetrode, the function of the other grid varies according to the type of tetrode; this is discussed below.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the other}} hand, the Hammond Novachord (1939) and other {{competitors}} selected [...] "subtractive synthesis" [...] design using various combinations of oscillators, filters, and possibly frequency dividers, {{to reduce the}} huge amount of oscillators which was the bottleneck on [...] "additive synthesis" [...] design. The heat generated by early models with vacuum tube tone generators and amplifiers led to the somewhat derogatory nickname [...] "toaster". Today's solid-state instruments do not suffer from this problem, nor do they require the several minutes that vacuum tube organs needed to bring the <b>filament</b> <b>heaters</b> up to temperature.|$|R
25|$|The heater's {{failure mode}} is {{typically}} a stress-related fracture of the tungsten wire or {{at a weld}} point and generally occurs after accruing many thermal (power on-off) cycles. Tungsten wire has a very low resistance when at room temperature. A negative temperature coefficient device, such as a thermistor, may be incorporated in the equipment's heater supply or a ramp-up circuit may be employed to allow the <b>heater</b> or <b>filaments</b> to reach operating temperature more gradually than if powered-up in a step-function. Low-cost radios had tubes with heaters connected in series, with a total voltage {{equal to that of}} the line (mains). Some receivers made before World War II had series-string heaters with total voltage less than that of the mains. Some had a resistance wire running the length of the power cord to drop the voltage to the tubes. Others had series resistors made like regular tubes; they were called ballast tubes.|$|R

5000|$|A {{superior}} solution, and {{one which}} allowed each cathode to [...] "float" [...] at a different voltage, {{was that of the}} indirectly heated cathode: a cylinder of oxide-coated nickel acted as electron-emitting cathode, and was electrically isolated from the filament inside it. Indirectly heated cathodes enable the cathode circuit to be separated from the <b>heater</b> circuit. The <b>filament,</b> no longer electrically connected to the tube's electrodes, became simply known as a [...] "heater", and could as well be powered by AC without any introduction of hum. In the 1930s indirectly heated cathode tubes became widespread in equipment using AC power. Directly heated cathode tubes continued to be widely used in battery-powered equipment as their filaments required considerably less power than the heaters required with indirectly heated cathodes.|$|R
40|$|In the {{campaign}} to achieve 2 kA of electron beam current, we have made several changes to the DARHT-II injector during 2006 - 2007. These changes resulted in {{a significant increase in}} the beam current, achieving the 2 kA milestone. Until recently (before 2007), the maximum beam current that was produced from the 6. 5 -inch diameter (612 M) cathode was about 1300 A when the cathode was operating at a maximum temperature of 1140 C. At this temperature level, the heat loss was dominated by radiation which is proportional to temperature to the fourth power. The maximum operating temperature was limited by the damage threshold of the potted filament and the capacity of the <b>filament</b> <b>heater</b> power supply, as well as the shortening of the cathode life time. There were also signs of overheating at other components in the cathode assembly. Thus it was clear that our approach to increase beam current could not be simply trying to run at a higher temperature and the preferred way was to operate with a cathode that has a lower work function. The dispenser cathode initially used was the type 612 M made by SpectraMat. According to the manufacturer's bulletin, this cathode should be able to produce more than 10 A/cm{sup 2 } of current density (corresponding to 2 kA of total beam current) at our operating conditions. Instead the measured emission (space charge limited) was 6 A/cm{sup 2 }. The result was similar even after we had revised the activation and handling procedures to adhere more closely to the recommend steps (taking longer time and nonstop to do the out-gassing). Vacuum was a major concern in considering the cathode's performance. Although the vacuum gauges at the injector vessel indicated 10 {sup - 8 } Torr, the actual vacuum condition near the cathode in the central region of the vessel, where there might be significant out-gassing from the heater region, was never determined. Poor vacuum at the surface of the cathode degraded the emission (by raising the work function value). We reexamined all the components in the cathode region and eliminated those parts that were suspected to be potential sources of contamination, e. g., feed-throughs with zinc coating. Finally, we considered a change in the cathode type, by using a different combination of impregnation and coating. Since the ETA-II accelerator at LLNL used a 12. 5 cm diameter 311 XW (barium oxide doped with scandium and coated with a osmium-tungsten thin film) cathode and emitted 2200 A of beam current (i. e. 18 A/cm{sup 2 }), it was reasonable to assume that DARHT can adopt this type of cathode to produce 2 kA (i. e., 10 A/cm{sup 2 }). However, it was later found that the 311 XW has a higher radiation heat loss than the 612 M and therefore resulted in a maximum operating temperature (as limited by filament damage) below that required to produce the high current. With the evidence provided by systematic emission tests using quarter-inch size cathodes, we confirmed that the 311 XM (doped with scandium and has a osmium-ruthenium (M) coating) had the best combination of low work function and low radiation heat loss. Subsequently a 6. 5 -inch diameter 311 XM cathode was installed in DARHT and 2 kA beam current was obtained on June 14, 2007. In testing the quarter-inch size cathode, we found that the beam current was sensitive to the partial pressure of various gases in the vacuum chamber. Furthermore, there was a hysteresis effect on the emission as a function of temperature. The phenomenon suggested that the work function of the cathode was dependent on the dynamic equilibrium between the diffusion of the impregnated material to the surface and the contamination rate from the surrounding gas. Water vapor was found to be the worst contaminant amongst the various gases that we have tested. Our data showed that the required vacuum for emitting at 10 A/cm{sup 2 } is in the low 10 {sup - 8 } Torr range...|$|R
