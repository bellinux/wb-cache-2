5|$|Because TAPS {{hoped to}} begin laying pipe by September 1969, {{substantial}} orders were placed for steel pipeline 48inches (122cm) in diameter. No American company manufactured pipe of that specification, so three Japanese companies—Sumitomo Metal Industries Ltd., Nippon Steel Corporation, and Nippon Kokan Kabushiki Kaisha—received a $100 million contract {{for more than}} 800 miles (1280km) of pipeline. At the same time, TAPS placed a $30 million order <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>of</b> the enormous pumps that {{would be needed to}} push the oil through the pipeline.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the end of}} 1976, Bowie's {{interest}} in the burgeoning German music scene, {{as well as his}} drug addiction, prompted him to move to West Berlin to clean up and revitalise his career. There he was often seen riding a bicycle between his apartment on Hauptstraße in Schöneberg and Hansa Tonstudio, the recording studio he used, located on Köthener Straße in Kreuzberg, near the Berlin Wall. While working with Brian Eno and sharing an apartment with Iggy Pop, he began to focus on minimalist, ambient music <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>of</b> three albums, co-produced with Tony Visconti, that became known as his Berlin Trilogy. During the same period, Iggy Pop, with Bowie as a co-writer and musician, completed his solo album debut The Idiot and its follow-up Lust for Life, touring the UK, Europe, and the US in March and April 1977.|$|E

On 22 February 1967, Sukarno announced he would resign from the presidency, and on 12 March, the MPRS session stripped him of his remaining power and named Suharto acting president. Sukarno was placed under house arrest in Bogor Palace; little more was heard from him, and he died in June 1970.

5|$|Following Acid's {{victory in}} Yokohama, {{the title was}} vacated <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>of</b> two times.

The second vacancy was the result of CZW stripping Chuck Taylor of the title on October 11, 2008. Ryan McBride became the new champion on December 13, 2008 at CZW's Cage Of Death 10: Ultraviolent Anniversary show by defeating Pinkie Sanchez, Carter Gray, Egotistico Fantastico, and Dan Paysan in a Ultraviolent Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match to win the vacant championship.|$|E
5|$|Four matches {{followed}} the MCC fixture before the First Test at Trent Bridge. McCool was rested <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>of</b> these against Lancashire at Manchester, a rain-affected draw that was Australia's first non-victory of the season.

He failed to maximise his promotion to No. 4, making only 17 as Australia scored 400 in their only innings. McCool did not get any more opportunities to push for selection, as he was rested from the next two matches against Hampshire and Sussex.

Franchitti became only the third driver in series history to lead the final lap of one season and the first lap of the next, having won the championship by winning the 2009 Firestone Indy 300 at Homestead-Miami Speedway. The top five remained the same until lap 15 when Dan Wheldon passed the De Ferran Luczo Dragon Racing car of Matos for fifth place. Hunter-Reay took second place from Tagliani into the final hairpin on lap 19, before Milka Duno brought out the second caution of the afternoon on lap 22 by nudging her Dale Coyne Racing car into the wall at turn four. The entire field except for Simona de Silvestro headed to pit road <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>of</b> two scheduled pit stops. De Silvestro became the first rookie driver since Graham Rahal in 2008 to lead at least one lap on début.|$|E
5|$|In 197879, Harvey’s {{appointments}} increased. Harvey {{stood in}} all of Queensland's five home Shield matches, {{as well as their}} match against the touring Englishmen. He stood in one List A match involving Queensland and was then rewarded with his international debut in the second ODI between Australia and England at the SCG, before presiding over the next ODI at the MCG. At the end of the season, Harvey was selected <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>of</b> his two Tests. The first, played by Australia against Pakistan at the MCG in March 1979 was dramatic. During the run-chase, the Australians were stunned by a spell of 7 wickets for 1 run by Sarfraz Nawaz, just when they looked like winning. Sarfraz ended with 9/86the other wicket was run outas Australia collapsed from 3/305 to 310 all out to lose by 71 runs. Harvey’s partner was Robin Bailhache.|$|E

He tied friend and teammate Éric Perrin for the NCAA scoring lead and the pair, along with goaltender Tim Thomas, led the Catamounts to the first ECAC hockey championship in school history. Named an all-star at the 1996 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament, St. Louis scored the winning goal in a 2–1 victory over Lake Superior State to reach the Final Four.

Tolkien's three-volume novel would be condensed into a single film. Bakshi arranged a meeting with Mike Medavoy, United Artists' head of production, who agreed to let Bakshi direct {{in exchange for the}} $3 million that had been spent on Boorman's screenplay. Down the hall from Medavoy was Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer president Dan Melnick, who interrupted a meeting with Peter Bogdanovich when he learned that Bakshi wanted to discuss acquiring the rights to The Lord of the Rings. Melnick agreed to pay United Artists $3 million, but was soon fired; the project was canceled by his replacement, Dick Shepherd. Bakshi contacted Saul Zaentz, who wrote a check to cover MGM's debt and agreed to fund the $8 million budget <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>of</b> what was initially planned as a series of three films, and later negotiated down to two. Before production began, Bakshi and Zaentz insisted that the Tolkien estate receive residuals from the film.|$|E
5|$|Pułaski resumed her Indian Ocean service {{when she}} left Durban on 21 January 1945, headed for Kilindini.

Headed to Akyab, Burma, she started the first of five India–Burma roundtrips through July. Over the next months, she shuttled between Rangoon, Calcutta (where she was docked on Victory over Japan Day), Chittagong, Madras, and Colombo, arriving at the latter port for the final time on 12 September. From Colombo she sailed into the Western Pacific for Singapore where she arrived <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>of</b> several visits on 14 September, two days after the Japanese garrison there surrendered. Through the end of 1945, Pułaski continued sailing between Singapore and India, making additional stops at Port Swettenham, Chittagong, Sourabaya, and Batavia.|$|E
5|$|The firefighters built bashings, {{walls of}} sandbags, turf and sand, {{approximately}} 18feet (5.5metres) deep and 17feet (5.2metres) {{up to the}} tunnel's roof to prevent smoke filling {{the rest of the}} workings and allow men to explore areas previously cut off. Within two days the temperatures dropped and the volume of smoke was reduced. Although the fire was contained, miners still faced several obstacles, including roof collapses and large pockets of trapped firedamp. The first collapse consisted of more than 100 tons of debris, while another fall was more than 300feet (91.5metres) long and 30 to 40feet (10–12metres) high. Clearing the falls and finding bodies was slow, and it took until 8 November <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>of</b> the 4 working districts to be explored and cleared of bodies. Many victims were unidentifiable—either the explosion, fire or subsequent decomposition had taken its toll—and many had to be identified by their personal effects, although some bodies remained unidentified.|$|E

5|$|A {{period of}} {{reorganisation}} and training followed as the battalion {{was prepared for}} the rigours of jungle warfare. The battalion concentrated at the Nagambie Road Camp in central Victoria initially, but in late September moved to Greta in New South Wales. In October, {{after a period of}} intense training, the 2/6th was moved to Brisbane from where, on 13 October 1942, they embarked on the Dutch merchant ship Bontekoe, bound for Milne Bay <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>of</b> their two campaigns there against the Japanese. After arriving at Milne Bay, where the 17th Brigade was held in reserve, on 19 October they remained there until January 1943, when the battalion embarked upon the MV Pulganbar and several smaller coastal vessels and moved to Port Moresby. From Moresby, they were airlifted to Wau on 14 January. During the battalion's time around Milne Bay, they had suffered heavily from malaria and over 300 men were in hospital at the time the battalion deployed to Wau; consequently, it was severely understrength by the time it went into battle. Nevertheless, throughout late January 1943, the battalion was heavily involved in the Battle of Wau, then afterwards took part in the advance on Salamaua, during which it fought several key actions, including the fighting around Lababia Ridge in late June, before supporting the landing at Nassau Bay and the Battle of Mubo in July and then taking part in the fighting around Mount Tambu and Komiatum Ridge in August. During the fighting the battalion sustained casualties of 59 dead and 133 wounded.|$|E
