2500|$|The {{efficiency}} of steam prime movers in converting the heat energy of fuel into mechanical work {{was a critical}} factor in the economic operation of steam central generating stations. [...] Early projects used reciprocating steam engines, operating at relatively low speeds. The introduction of the steam turbine fundamentally changed the economics of central station operations. Steam turbines could be made in larger ratings than reciprocating engines, and generally had higher efficiency. The speed of steam turbines did not fluctuate cyclically during each revolution; making parallel operation of AC generators feasible, and improved the stability of rotary converters for production of direct current for traction and industrial uses. [...] Steam turbines ran at higher speed than reciprocating engines, not being limited by the allowable speed of a piston in a cylinder. This made them more compatible with AC generators with only two or four poles; no [...] gearbox or belted speed <b>increaser</b> was needed between the engine and the generator. It was costly and ultimately impossible to provide a belt-drive between a low-speed engine and a high-speed generator in the very large ratings required for central station service.|$|E

This paper uses micro-level data to decompose consumer debt dynamics by separating the actions of consumer debt <b>increasers</b> and decreasers, and then further decomposing movements into percentage and size margins among the <b>increasers</b> and decreasers. We view such a decomposition as informative for macroeconomic models featuring a central role for consumer debt. Using this framework, we show that variations in borrowing activity among the <b>increasers</b> explain four times as much of the total variation in consumer debt as variations among the decreasers who are shedding debt, whether through paydowns or defaults. We also provide micro-level evidence of a sharp decline in the percentage of <b>increasers</b> during the financial crisis that is qualitatively consistent with a binding zero lower bound on nominal interest rates, and evidence of a cycle in the average size of debt changes among the <b>increasers</b> that is related to rising collateral values pre-crisis coupled with additional financial frictions after the crisis...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{increase}} in angiotensin II (Ang II) formation by selected antihypertensive drugs {{is said to}} exhibit neuroprotective properties, but this translation into improvement in clinical outcomes has been inconclusive. We undertook a study to investigate the relationship between types of antihypertensive drugs used prior to a stroke event and ischemic stroke severity. We hypothesized that use of antihypertensive drugs that increase Ang II formation (Ang II <b>increasers)</b> would reduce ischemic stroke severity when compared to antihypertensive drugs that suppress Ang II formation (Ang II suppressors). METHODS: From the Malaysian National Neurology Registry, we included hypertensive patients with first ischemic stroke who presented within 48 hours from ictus. Antihypertensive drugs were divided into Ang II <b>increasers</b> (angiotensin-I receptor blockers (ARBs), calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and diuretics) and Ang II suppressors (angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and beta blockers). We evaluated stroke severity during admission with the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). We performed a multivariable logistic regression with the score being dichotomized at 15. Scores of less than 15 were categorized as less severe stroke. RESULTS: A total of 710 patients were included. ACEIs was the most commonly prescribed antihypertensive drug in patients using Ang II suppressors (74 %) and CCBs, in patients prescribed with Ang II <b>increasers</b> at 77 %. There {{was no significant difference}} in the severity of ischemic stroke between patients who were using Ang II <b>increasers</b> in comparison to patients with Ang II suppressors (OR: 1. 32, 95 %CI: 0. 83 - 2. 10, p = 0. 24). CONCLUSION: In our study, we found that use of antihypertensive drugs that increase Ang II formation was not associated with less severe ischemic stroke as compared to use of antihypertensive drugs that suppress Ang II formation...|$|R

40|$|Depending {{on their}} {{response}} to grazing, grassland species can be categorized as grazing increasers or decreasers. Grazing by livestock includes several different activities that can impact species differently. Recent evidence suggest {{that one of these}} actions, dung deposition, can reduce the germinative performance of decreaser species, thus favouring increasers. The present study tested the hypothesis that decreased germinative success of decreaser species is caused by a greater activity of fungal pathogens under the influence of dung leachates. We performed a phytotron experiment analysing the germination and fungal infections of fourteen species from Mediterranean grasslands. Species were grouped into phylogenetically-related pairs, composed of an <b>increaser</b> and a decreaser species. Seeds of each species were germinated under four different treatments (control, dung leachate addition, fungicide addition and dung leachate and fungicide addition), and the differences in germination percentage, germination speed and infection rate between each <b>increaser</b> species and its decreaser counterpart were analysed. Decreaser species were more affected by mortality than <b>increaser</b> ones, and these differences were higher under the presence of dung leachates. The differences in germinative performance after excluding the effect of seed mortality did not differ between treatments, showing that the main mechanism by which dung leachates favour <b>increaser</b> species is through increased mortality of the seeds of decreaser species. Drastic reductions in the number of dead seeds in the treatments including fungicide addition further revealed that fungal pathogens are responsible for these differences between species with different grazing response. The different vulnerabilities of <b>increaser</b> and decreaser species to the increased activity of fungal pathogens under the presence of dung leachates seems the main reason behind the differential effect of these leachates on species with different grazing responseFinancial support was received from the Spanish MINECO (Project CGL 2014 - 53789 -R) and the Madrid Regional Government (Project REMEDINAL 3).

Earlier {{studies have reported}} inconsistent results, possibly because of their varying ability to adjust for confounding. The impact of longitudinal change in uric acid on renal outcome has not been assessed previously. We aimed to study the impact of change in serum uric acid (SUA) as well as baseline SUA {{on the development of}} RD. Methods: In a prospective cohort study, we assessed the associations between change in SUA during follow-up, baseline SUA and RD (defined as albumin-creatinine-ratio (ACR) ≥ 1. 13 mg albumin/mmol creatinine and/or eGFR < 60 ml/min/ 1. 73 m 2) in a large cohort from a general population participating in the Tromsø Study (n = 2637). Participants were stratified according to tertiles of change in SUA between baseline (1994 / 95) and follow-up 13 years later. (upper tertile: SUA increasing group, two lower tertiles: SUA non-increasing group). Logistic regression analysis was applied with RD and each component of RD after 7 and 13 years as the dependent variables. Adjustments were made for baseline eGFR, cardiovascular risk factors, and the use of antihypertensive drugs including diuretics. Results: After excluding participants with RD at baseline, SUA <b>increasers,</b> compared to SUA non-increasers, had a doubled risk of RD after 7 years (odds ratio 2. 00, (95 % CI 1. 45, 2. 75)). Odds ratio for RD in SUA <b>increasers</b> after 13 years was 2. 18 (95 % CI 1. 71, 2. 79).
