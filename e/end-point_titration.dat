40|$|Infectious {{pancreatic}} disease (IPN) and pancreas disease (PD) of salmon are viral diseases caused by Infectious Pancreatic Necrosis Virus (IPNV) (Birnaviridae) and Salmonid Alphavirus (SAV) (Togaviridae). Both IPNV- and SAV infections induce lesions in pancreas tissue/cells and are frequently detected {{from the same}} individual; hence {{it is possible that}} the viruses target the same cell types and therefore might interfere with each other during such infections.

40|$|There is {{increasing}} {{concern over the}} extent to which bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) prions have been transmitted to humans, {{as a result of the}} rising number of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) cases. Toward preventing new transmissions, diagnostic tests for prions in livestock have been developed using the conformation-dependent immunoassay (CDI), which simultaneously measures specific antibody binding to denatured and native forms of the prion protein (PrP). We employed high-affinity recombinant antibody fragments (recFab) reacting with residues 95 - 105 of bovine (Bo) PrP for detection and another recFab that recognizes residues 132 - 156 for capture in the CDI. We report that the CDI is capable of measuring the disease-causing PrP isoform (PrP(Sc)) in bovine brainstems with a sensitivity similar to that of <b>end-point</b> <b>titrations</b> in transgenic (Tg) mice expressing BoPrP. Prion titers were approximately 10 (7) ID(50) units per gram of bovine brainstem when measured in Tg(BoPrP) mice, a figure approximately 10 times greater than that determined by bioassay in cattle and approximately 10, 000 x greater than in wild-type mice. We also report substantial differences in BoPrP(Sc) levels in different areas of the obex region, where neuropathology has been consistently observed in cattle with BSE. The CDI was able to discriminate between PrP(Sc) from BSE-infected cattle and Tg(BoPrP) mice as well as from chronic wasting disease (CWD) -infected deer and elk.

40|$|Studies of mouse mammary {{tumor virus}} (MMTV) have been impeded {{by the lack}} of an in vitro {{infectivity}} assay. We have developed a rapid, quantitative in vitro assay for MMTV infectivity based on the detection of positively staining foci by immunoperoxidase. This assay and a 50 % <b>end-point</b> <b>titration</b> of MMTV infectivity gave identical virus titers. Infection of a rat hepatoma cell line, a feline kidney cell line, and a normal murine mammary gland cell line by virus from the mouse mammary tumor GR 3 A cell line was linear with respect to virus concentration. The infectious titers obtained in both homologous and heterologous cell lines were not significantly different, demonstrating a lack of host range specificity. Virus infectivity was inactivated by heating at 55 degrees C and by ultraviolet irradiation. Rabbit anti-MMTV serum neutralized the infectivity with a 50 % neutralization end point of 1 : 5000.

40|$|Infectious {{pancreatic}} necrosis virus (IPNV) is a naked virus of an uncomplicated structure. In {{the interior}} {{part of the}} virion, the two segments of double-stranded RNA are located together with the minor structural protein VP 1. This protein is detected in its free form as well as linked to the genome. A polymerase activity has been assigned for VP 1. The localisation of the viral protein VP 3 has also been proposed to be internal. We have shown that VP 3 is quantitatively associated with the entire viral genome and VP 3 /RNA cores are released from disintegrated virions and visualized as entangled filaments with an estimated diameter of 5. 0 - 6. 5 nm. The highly basic carboxy terminal end of polypeptide VP 3 may have a neutralizing effect on the RNA and facilitate the packaging of the genome into the capsid. VP 3 /RNA complexes were also shown {{to be released from}} infected cells during lysis, however, the nucleic acids of these components consist of incomplete RNA segments and are non-infectious. The lack of infectivity of these components was assessed by an improved TCID 50 <b>end-point</b> <b>titration</b> method evaluated by an immuno dot blot assay developed by us. The nucleoprotein core of IPNV is surrounded by a single-shelled capsid built by subunits of one protein, VP 2. Our studies, involving several different methods, have demonstrated that this is a glycoprotein. The fact that low quantities of carbohydrates actually are present on VP 2, may offer an interesting issue concerning future studies of the virus-receptor interactions and the questions of tropism. During the cycle of replication, we have also detected VP 2 in granulas in the perinuclear region; these granulas increase in size and are found as inclusion bodies at the end of multiplication, before the cellular cytoskeleton is disrupted. These inclusion bodies, most likely correspond to pseudocrystalline aggregates of assembled virions as revealed in the electron microscope. Our improved virus purification technique, using anion exchange chromatography, together with the <b>end-point</b> <b>titration</b> method, are valuable tools in the research of IPNV, and would offer some assistance in pursuing the future tasks. Also the fact that preparations of purified IPNV indeed will retain maximum infectivity levels upon freezing {{in the presence of a}} suitable cryoprotective agent is advantageous for all structural and biological studies...|$|E

Rabbit erythrocytes were superior as target cells over erythtocytes {{from a number of}} other animal species. The optimal conditions were as follows: an incubation temperature of 39 °C, an ionic strength of about 200 mM, and a magnesium concentration of 2. 5 mM. Incubation during 60 min was not sufficient for an <b>end-point</b> <b>titration.</b> Addition of 1 mg of zymosan A per test well, however, enhanced and accelerated the hemolytic activity of mouse serum via the alternative pathway resulting in a maximum value after 45 min.

In contrast to the normal alternative pathway assay the zymosan-potentiated test did, most probably, not involve natural antibodies. Cobra venom factor was more efficient in enhancing the sensitivity of the assay for the mouse alternative complement pathway than zymosan.

To verify that this phenomenon reflects increased sensitivity, we challenged Tgbov XV mice and conventional RIII mice with a BSE brain-stem homogenate of known infectivity titer in cattle. An <b>end-point</b> <b>titration</b> experiment in Tgbov XV mice revealed their superior sensitivity, which exceeded that of RIII mice by at least 10, 000 -fold and even that of cattle by ∼ 10 -fold.

These results provide further indication that the pathogenesis of BSE in cattle is fundamentally different from that in sheep and mice, due to an exclusive intraneuronal spread of infectivity from the gut to the central nervous system.

Recent suc-cesses in generating mammalian prions in vitro with bacterially expressed recombinant prion protein provide {{strong support for}} the hypothesis. However, whether the pathogenic properties of synthetically generated prion (rec-Prion) recapitulate those of naturally occur-ring prions remains unresolved.

40|$|Biosorption is a {{property}} of {{certain types of}} inactive, dead biomass to bind and concentrate heavy metals from even very dilute aqueous solutions. It {{may be used for}} purification of metal containing industrial waste effluents. The issues related to the biosorption process design and optimization were addressed by (1) equilibrium isotherm relationships, (2) biosorption process rate and (3) breakthrough time in a continuous-flow biosorption column. This work investigates these three aspects for the biosorption of the heavy metals uranium and cadmium on protonated Sargassum fluitans seaweed biomass. Biosorption uptakes of uranium and cadmium were evaluated by determining their isotherms at different solution pH values. It was established that the state of uranium in aqueous solution and ion exchange {{play an important role in}} the biosorption of uranium. A new equilibrium biosorption isotherm model based on ion exchange of uranium complex ion species was developed. The new model is capable of predicting the effect of proton as an exchanged species and of the metal speciation on the biosorption uptake for a equilibrium batch biosorption system. The <b>end-point</b> <b>titration</b> method was applied in the experimental determination of the biosorption uptake rates of uranium and cadmium at different pH levels. A one-dimensional intraparticle diffusion rate model reflected well the controlling step in the uranium and cadmium ion transport inside the biosorbent. The PDEs of this new model were solved numerically by the Galerkin Finite Element Method (GFEM). Biosorption of uranium was examined in a continuous-flow fixed-bed column at the feed pH 2. 5. The biomass binding capacity for the uranium before the breakthrough was as high as 105 mg/g biomass. The elution with diluted hydrochloric acid produced an overall uranium concentration factor of about 25 [...] 30. A mass transfer model based on the external and intraparticle diffusion was developed to describe the column sorption performance. The model equations were solved by the Orthogonal Collocation (OC) numerical method. The model-calculated breakthrough curves agreed well with the experimental ones, indicating the potential of the model for process design and optimization...|$|E
40|$|Investigators {{concerned}} with {{the study of the}} mechanism and stoichiometry of chemical reactions are constantly on the alert for new and more penetrating means of detecting and following the course of chemical reactions. In particular, the analytical chemist is interested in improved methods for equivalence-point detection in titri-metry. Since the relatively recent introduction of megacycle-frequency (“high frequency”) oscillator circuitsr- 5, their applicability has been described, e. g. for <b>end-point</b> indi-cation in <b>titration</b> in aqueous and nonaqueous solvents, analysis of binary systems, and measurement of reaction rates. While the megacycle-frequency titration curves may, in some cases, resemble conventional low-frequency, e. g. Iooo-cycle, conduc-tance curves, two important differences distinguish the former technique: (a) lack of contact between electrodes and test solution, and (6) the possibility of instrument response to solution conductance, solution dielectric constant, or both. The theory of the electronic circuitry involved in megacycle-frequency oscillometry...|$|R
2500|$|The {{traditional}} way {{to analyze the}} ascorbic acid content {{is the process of}} titration with an oxidizing agent, and several procedures have been developed, mainly relying on iodometry. Iodine is used {{in the presence of a}} starch indicator. Iodine is reduced by ascorbic acid, and, when all the ascorbic acid has reacted, the iodine is then in excess, forming a blue-black complex with the starch indicator. [...] This indicates the <b>end-point</b> of the <b>titration.</b> As an alternative, ascorbic acid can be treated with iodine in excess, followed by back titration with sodium thiosulfate using starch as an indicator. The preceding iodometric method has been revised to exploit reaction of ascorbic acid with iodate and iodide in acid solution. Electrolyzing the solution of potassium iodide produces iodine, which reacts with ascorbic acid. The end of process is determined by potentiometric titration in a manner similar to Karl Fischer titration. The amount of ascorbic acid can be calculated by Faraday's law.|$|R
40|$|Background: Monitoring of the {{allergen}} {{sensitivity of}} a patient is most important for optimal patient care and a basic prerequisite for immunomodulating treatment. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate how basophil allergen sensitivity can be applied in the monitoring of anti-immunoglobulin E (IgE) treatment. Methods: Basophils from timothy grass pollen allergic patients were, by flow cytometry, analysed for allergen threshold sensitivity (CD-sens) by measuring CD 63 up-regulation on CD 203 c-identified basophils. The results were compared with maximal percentage CD 63 up-regulation at one allergen dose (CD-max), skin prick test <b>end-point</b> allergen <b>titration,</b> (SPT-sens), nasal provocation titration tests (nasal provocation titre) and serum IgE and IgE antibody concentrations. Results: There was a significant correlation (r = 0. 50, P = 0. 01) between CD-sens and SPT-sens, CD-sens and the IgE antibody concentration in percentage of 'total IgE' (relative IgE antibody concentration) (r = 0. 72, P < 0. 001) as well as between CD-sens and nasal provocation titre (r = 0. 54, P < 0. 05) but, in contrast, CD-max did not correlate with any of the sensitization parameters, i. e. SPT-sens, nasal provocation titre, absolute and relative IgE antibody concentration or CD-sens. CD-sens could be used to monitor omalizumab treatment efficacy while, based on CD-max, four of seven symptom-free patients on omalizumab would have been classified as having ongoing allergy. Conclusions: CD-sens seems to be very useful for the determination {{of a patient}}'s allergen sensitivity and should be evaluated for the measurement and monitoring of anti-IgE treatment efficacy. CD-max, the conventional approach to basophil allergen challenge, which mirrors cell reactivity, gives incorrect information...|$|R
