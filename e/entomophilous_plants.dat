25|$|Many {{insects are}} pollinators, {{particularly}} bees, Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths), wasps, flies, ants and beetles. On the other hand, some plants are generalists, being pollinated by insects in several orders. Entomophilous plant species have frequently evolved mechanisms {{to make themselves}} more appealing to insects, e.g., brightly coloured or scented flowers, nectar, or appealing shapes and patterns. Pollen grains of <b>entomophilous</b> <b>plants</b> are generally larger than the fine pollens of anemophilous (wind-pollinated) plants, which has to be produced in much larger quantities because such a high proportion is wasted.

The hoary plantain is primarily wind pollinated, but is also visited by insects which pollinate it.

60|$|Finally, we {{have seen}} {{reason to believe that}} the higher plants are descended from {{extremely}} low forms which conjugated, and that the conjugating individuals differed somewhat from one another,--the one representing the male and the other the female--so that plants were aboriginally dioecious. At a very early period such lowly organised dioecious plants probably gave rise by budding to monoecious plants with the two sexes borne by the same individual; and by a still closer union of the sexes to hermaphrodite plants, which are now much the commonest form. (10/63. There is a considerable amount of evidence that all the higher animals are the descendants of hermaphrodites; and it is a curious problem whether such hermaphroditism may not have been the result of the conjugation of two slightly different individuals, which represented the two incipient sexes. On this view, the higher animals may now owe their bilateral structure, with all their organs double at an early embryonic period, to the fusion or conjugation of two primordial individuals.) As soon as plants became affixed to the ground, their pollen must have been carried by some means from flower to flower, at first almost certainly by the wind, then by pollen-devouring, and afterwards by nectar-seeking insects. During subsequent ages some few <b>entomophilous</b> <b>plants</b> have been again rendered anemophilous, and some hermaphrodite plants have had their sexes again separated; and we can vaguely see the advantages of such recurrent changes under certain conditions.|$|E
6000|$|The {{extraordinary}} {{quantity and}} lightness of the pollen of anemophilous plants {{are no doubt}} both necessary, as their pollen has generally to be carried to the stigmas of other and often distant flowers; for, as we shall soon see, most anemophilous plants have their sexes separated. The fertilisation of these plants is generally aided by the stigmas being of large size or plumose; {{and in the case}} of the Coniferae, by the naked ovules secreting a drop of fluid, as shown by Delpino. Although the number of anemophilous species is small, as the author just quoted remarks, the number of individuals is large in comparison with that of entomophilous species. This holds good especially in cold and temperate regions, where insects are not so numerous as under a warmer climate, and where consequently <b>entomophilous</b> <b>plants</b> are less favourably situated. We see this in our forests of Coniferae and other trees, such as oaks, beeches, birches, ashes, etc.; and in the Gramineae, Cyperaceae, and Juncaceae, which clothe our meadows and swamps; all these trees and plants being fertilised by the wind. As a large quantity of pollen is wasted by anemophilous plants, it is surprising that so many vigorous species of this kind abounding with individuals should still exist in any part of the world; for if they had been rendered entomophilous, their pollen would have been transported by the aid of the senses and appetites of insects with incomparably greater safety than by the wind. That such a conversion is possible can hardly be doubted, from the remarks lately made on the existence of intermediate forms; and apparently it has been effected in the group of willows, as we may infer from the nature of their nearest allies.

In the southern part of the region, fragmented semi-natural grasslands over exposed rock still persist and connectivity between them is assumed to be crucial for maintaining viable populations. We quantiﬁed overall connectivity of grassland patches in a sector of the Southern Pampa region, and investigated the degree to which landscape connectivity explains <b>entomophilous</b> <b>plant</b> species assemblages in a subset of patches. We characterized each of the 301 patches in the landscape by their degree of intra-patch and inter-patch connectivity based on graph theory,and considering threshold dispersal distances from 100 to 1000 m. We surveyed <b>entomophilous</b> <b>plant</b> species in 39 grassland patches and classiﬁed the species in three categories (annual herbs, perennial herbs and shrubs) considering their different growth form and longevity.

Although grassland patches were poorly connected at all threshold distances, some of them were found to be critical for global connectivity. Connectivity signiﬁcantly explained total, annual-biennial and shrub assemblages for all threshold dispersal distances (6 – 13 % of total variation). Variation in annual species assemblages was associated with intra-patch and inter-patch connectivity at short distance (100 m), while variation in shrub species assemblages was explained by intra-patch and inter-patch connectivity for distances between 100 m and 1000 m.

40|$|Abstract. Relatively {{little is}} known about the {{pollination}} biology or breeding systems of <b>entomophilous</b> <b>plant</b> species in salt-marsh habitats. In the present study, the pollination biology of the perennial halophyte Frankenia pauciflora DC. var. gunnii Summerh. (Frankeniaceae) was investigated in a salt marsh near Goolwa, South Australia. The flowering peak of this species occurs in summer and flowers are visited by a diverse array of insects in the Diptera, Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera. An experiment was performed to test for the presence of pollen limitation in the field. Flowers to which outcross pollen was added produced significantly more fruits and significantly more seeds per fruit than did unmanipulated control flowers. Average seed weight per fruit did not differ significantly between control and pollen-addition flowers. In glasshouse experiments,flowers towhich cross-pollenwas added produced significantlymore fruit than didflowers towhich self-pollen was added, suggesting the presence of a facultatively xenogamous breeding system...|$|R
40|$|Questions: In animal-mediated pollination, pollinators can be {{regarded}} as a limiting resource for which <b>entomophilous</b> <b>plant</b> species might interact to assure pollination, an event pivotal for their reproduction and population maintenance. At community level, spatially aggregated co-flowering species can thus be expected to exhibit suitable suites of traits to avoid competition and ensure pollination. We explored the problem by answering the following questions: (i) are co-flowering species specialized on different guilds of pollinators? (ii) do co-flowering pollinator-sharing species segregate spatially? (iii) do co-flowering pollinator-sharing species that diverge in anther position spatially aggregate more than those that converge in anther position? Study site: Euganean Hills (NE Italy). Methods: Plant composition, flowering phenology and interactions between each <b>entomophilous</b> <b>plant</b> species and pollinating insects were monitored every fifteen days in 40 permanent plots placed in an area of 16 ha. We quantified the degree of flowering synchrony, pollinator-sharing and spatial aggregation between each pair of entomophilous species. We then tested the relationship between the degree of co-flowering, pollinator-sharing and spatial aggregation, and between spatial aggregation and anther position. Results: Entomophilous species converged, at least partially in flowering time, and the phenological synchronization of flowering was significantly associated with the sharing of pollinator guilds. Coflowering pollinator-sharing species segregated spatially. Furthermore, co-flowering pollinatorsharing species that diverged in anther position aggregated more than those that converged in anther position. Conclusions: Reproductive traits that facilitate the coexistence of co-flowering species include specialization on different pollinator guilds and a phenological displacement of the flowering time. Furthermore, in circumstances of increased competition due to phenological synchronization, pollinator sharing and spatial aggregation, the chance of an effective pollination might depend on differences in anther position, resulting in a divergent pollen placement on pollinators’ body. One of the most interesting results we obtained is that the presence of one mechanism does not preclude the operation of others and each plant species can simultaneously exhibit different strategies. Although more studies are needed, our results can provide additional information about plant-plant interactions and add new insights into mechanisms allowing the coexistence of a high number of plant species into local communities...|$|R
40|$|The yield is {{a complex}} trait and {{indirect}} selection through correlated, less complex and easy measurement traits would be an advisable strategy to increase yield. To assess artichoke genetic variation for different agronomic traits, the phenotypic and genotypic correlation coefficients among these traits and the direct and indirect effects of these traits on the total yield, 10 halfsib families were used. Total yield recorded positive genotypic correlation with number of heads and the length, diameter and weight of heads. Number of head and their weight had direct positive contribution towards total yield per plant. Indirect effect of plant diameter and length and weight of head, on number of heads plant height, are shown. These results allow us to select materials with high yields by choosing those with a large diameter of plant and upper length of main head.

According to Bateman's principle, male fitness in <b>entomophilous</b> <b>plant</b> species should be limited by mating opportunity, which is influenced by the size or number of flowers. We determined male-specific fitness consequences of floral phenotype in andromonoecious Solanum carolinense, examined the relationship between male and female reproductive success within plants, and evaluated the distribution of functional gender among plants. A maximum likelihood-based paternity analysis, based on multilocus allozyme phenotypes of parents and offspring from four experimental plots, was used to determine male reproductive success and its relationship to floral phenotype. Male success was enhanced by an increase in the proportion of male flowers produced but not by an increase in total flower number, even though all flowers contain male parts. Larger flower size increased male success in only one plot. Male and female reproductive success were negatively correlated, and plants varied in functional gender from completely female to completely male. This gender specialization may occur because hermaphroditic and male flowers differ in their ability to contribute to male and female success. Although sex allocation theory predicts a positive relationship between the size or number of plant parts and reproductive success, this study indicates that aspects of floral morphology that affect gender specialization should also be considered.

This plant inhabits the high altitudinal sub-alpine zone, which {{is characterized by}} a harsh climate, low species diversity and a short growing season. Echium wildpretii is a monocarpic perennial, producing a 2 – 3 m column-shaped, red-flowered, nectar-rich inflorescence. Although these floral traits have previously been suggested as being typical of ornithophilous flowers, this is the first study reporting observations of native birds (Phylloscopus collybita and Serinus canarius) in addition to insects visiting the flowers for nectar. The purposes of this study were firstly to investigate levels of visitation by native birds, native insects, and introduced honey bees. Secondly, we studied the influence of floral display (plant height and number of flowers), nearest neighbours (distance and size) and local vegetation structure on visitation rate. Finally, we discuss the evolution of ornithophily in an otherwise <b>entomophilous</b> <b>plant</b> lineage. We found that the level of bird visitation was relatively high early in the flowering season, but decreased in mid/late season, while the opposite pattern was found for introduced honey bees. For native insects, the frequency of visits was similar in early and late season. Bird visits were correlated with floral display. In the early season, visitation rates of honey bees and the two most common native bee species were correlated with size of the plant or its nearest neighbours, consistent with preference patterns for larger resource patches. Since only insects visit the flowers of other species in the Echium clade, E. wildpretii appears to have evolved from a truly insect-pollinated lineage...|$|R

This study explores important information on biology, genetic resources, taxonomy, as well as morphological, biochemical and molecular markers {{in order to provide}} {{a better understanding of the}} genetic diversity of the onion (Allium cepa L.). The study has a particular focus on the plant as grown in Africa. The onion is a monocotyledonous, allogamous, and <b>entomophilous</b> <b>plant,</b> with a one-year production cycle for bulb production, and a two-year production cycle for seeds. The onion is one of the most significant vegetables in the world because of its use as both a food and a medicine. Literature. Twenty-eight morphological markers, linked to seed, leaf, flower and bulb traits, were identified as the most discriminant phenotypical criteria. Biochemical and molecular markers were also developed to characterize genetic variations between and within onion varieties. Previous studies examining West Africa onion varieties showed that only six enzyme systems are polymorphic. However, only twenty-four isozymes have been used to compare the onion to other Allium species. This low number of polymorphic biochemical markers makes it more difficult to determine the genetic diversity of onions. On the other hand, molecular markers at DNA level, such as RAPD, RFLP, AFLP, SSR, are very useful to analyze diversity at varietal and species level, using cultivated and spontaneous forms, and to analyze the level of introgression between the onion and the other species of the genus. Conclusions. Genetic diversity analysis showed an important variability between and within Africa onion landraces. It would be useful to combine in situ and ex situ conservation, using these genetic resources to improve the production and the appropriate use of African onion cultivars...|$|R
40|$|The way {{in which}} taxonomic {{diversity}} relates to functional diversity is important for understanding the mechanisms that sustain ecosystem function and services. We investigated how an explicit consideration of plant-pollinator interactions influences our view of plant diversity. We studied three plant species-rich communities located in different biodiversity hotspot regions: two soil-specific plant communities with Mediterranean-climate, sandy dolomite outcrops in Andalusia (Spain) and serpentine seeps in California (USA), and a third community in the sub-tropical dry scrublands in Yucatan (Mexico). Sampling at three spatial scales (region, site, plot) and rarefaction analyses were used to characterize and compare spatial and temporal variation of <b>entomophilous</b> <b>plant</b> diversity based on species presence (“static plant diversity”), flower display sizes along the season (“dynamic flower diversity”), and pollinator visitation (“interaction-effective diversity”). The studied communities differed in the static diversity of plants, with sub-tropical dry scrublands being less diverse than the two Mediterranean communities. Reduction of static diversity at local scale was stronger in the richest Mediterranean communities and, thus, static diversity was similar among regions when considering finer (site-level) spatial scales. In addition, the two Mediterranean communities displayed more seasonal variation, thus reducing differences in dynamic diversity among regions, i. e. when considering finer temporal scales. These results suggested that, at finer spatio-temporal scales expected to be relevant for interactions with pollinators, plant communities are not necessarily {{as diverse as the}} region where they occur. Accordingly, interaction-effective diversity based on pollinator visitation was in all cases lower than expected relative to the diversity of flowers. Thus, diversity of visited flowers does not perfectly track diversity of flowering species but instead reaches asymptotes at much lower values than expected in the richest communities. Regional species diversity may support the functionality of interactions at broader spatial and temporal scales than they actually occur. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

Still, only {{a few studies have}} been focused at a community level. Of particular interest are high mountain species, because of the high frequency of narrow endemics and their higher susceptibility to extinction due to the effects of climate change. In the present study we explored genome size variation and polyploidy incidence in the <b>entomophilous</b> <b>plant</b> communities of two distinct mountain ranges, the Sierra Nevada and Picos de Europa National Parks. For that, chromosome numbers and DNA ploidies were assessed through a review of the literature, and the genome size and incidence of polyploidy in 39 taxa from several key genera were estimated using flow cytometry. In this study, first genome size estimations are given for 32 taxa. The majority of the analyzed taxa presented very small to small genome sizes (2 C ≤ 7. 0 pg), with no differences being detected between genome size and geographic origin and distribution ranges. A low incidence of polyploid taxa was observed (23. 3 %), with polyploids being more common in Picos de Europa than in Sierra Nevada. Most taxa inferred as polyploids were high altitude plants, but no clear pattern between polyploidy incidence and endemic status was observed. The obtained results are discussed within the context of angiosperm’s genome size variation and of polyploidy incidence in alpine and arctic flora, contributing to the scientific knowledge of these natural communities of great biological importance.

40|$|Larger corollas {{increase}} the reproductive success of <b>entomophilous</b> <b>plants,</b> {{but are also}} associated with increased carbon and water costs, especially under hot and dry conditions. Minimizing floral carbon and water loss by reducing corolla size should be potentially advantageous for plants living in these environments. We quantify maintenance costs of corollas (water and carbon) in large-flowered rockroses (Cistus spp.) in a Mediterranean ecosystem. We performed field studies of two coflowering sympatric Cistus of contrasting corolla size to analyze water costs. Additionally, we used the larger-flowered species (C. ladanifer) to analyze the effects of intraspecific variation in corolla size on floral net carbon exchange and transpiration rates. We also assessed the mean daily percentage of plant water and carbon consumed by corollas by comparing with that of leaves {{at the time of}} flowering in C. ladanifer. Temperature and corolla area increased water maintenance costs, following an allometric relationship where transpiration rate per unit of area increased with corolla area. Larger flowers tended to heat less under strong irradiance than smaller ones in both species, especially in C. ladanifer, demonstrating a stronger transpirational cooling effect on larger flowers. In terms of carbon, temperature significantly affected net carbon exchange rates, which were not affected by corolla size. Daily water and carbon expenses of corolla were ca. 50 % of those of leaves on an organ surface area basis. Our results suggest that water and carbon maintenance costs of large flowers in the Mediterranean impose significant constraints to corolla size, ecophysiologically favoring smaller-flowered individuals in these ecosystems. © 2014 Geobotanisches Institut ETH, Stiftung Ruebel.

As species are distributed in more or less connected populations, they have evolved in a geographical mosaic of co-evolution were the outcome of the plant–pollinator interaction is likely to vary as a result of local adaptations. 2. Arum italicum and Arum maculatum are two species of Araceae which deceive their fly pollinators by mimicking the odour of their oviposition sites. Whereas A. italicum is known to be pollinated by flies belonging to different families (i. e. opportunist), A. maculatum relies on only two pollinating species of the family Psychodidae throughout its European repartition area (i. e. specialist). 3. The interannual and geographical variations of pollinators and pollinator-attractive odours were described in several populations of the two species over two consecutive years. Furthermore, local adaptation to pollinators was tested by transplanting inflorescence-bearing plants between two different sites and by recording the number and composition of the insect fauna trapped inside the inflorescences during anthesis as a measure of a fitness component. 4. Pollinators and pollinator-attractive odours of the two Arum species varied in time and space, but there was no clear odour structure between populations. When transplanted, inflorescences of both species trapped the same composition and number of insects as native inflorescences at a given site; this indicates that pollinator composition is highly dependent on the local availability of insects. 5. No pattern of local adaptation was found for these two species, but local pollination conditions were shown to strongly affect the degree of geographical variations of these interactions. The lack of a clear odour geographical structure might be due to high gene flow or to similar selective pressures exerted by pollinators, and the high interindividual odour variation may be linked to the deceptive strategy adopted by the two plant species...|$|E
40|$|We {{assessed}} bee {{diversity and}} abundance in a botanical {{garden in the}} city of Buenos Aires during two consecutive spring–summer periods. Every 15 days, we collected by hand-netting bee specimens seen foraging on flowers during five-minute censuses at every <b>entomophilous</b> herbaceous <b>plant.</b> A total of 66 bee species (Hymenoptera: Apoidea) were recorded. Richness and abundance of native, generalist, and above-ground nesting (cavities) species were higher than that of exotic, specialist, and below-ground (soil) nesting ones, respectively. Social bees were more abundant, while the richness of solitary species was higher than that of social bees. Cleptoparasitic species were represented by a high number of species, even though only a few individuals were captured. Our results suggest that the studied area is an important bee reservoir within the city. Fil: Mazzeo, Nadia Melisa. Universidad de Buenos Aires. Facultad de Agronomía.

40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{describes the}} effects of plant and insect diversity on pollination of wild plant species. As biodiversity is decreasing due to human activities, {{it is important to}} know {{the effects of}} lower species richness on ecosystem functioning. One such ecosystem function is pollination by insects. The main question of the thesis therefore is: Is a high biodiversity important for the pollination of <b>entomophilous</b> wild <b>plant</b> species in agricultural, fragmented landscapes? Both field surveys (descriptive analyses) and experiments (garden and field) were used. In the field surveys, the diversity of flowering plants and their flower visitors were measured with transects of road verges and ditch banks, situated in landscapes differing in agricultural land use. Furthermore, experiments with potted plants of a number of selected species were performed. The effects of land use on plant and insect diversity were analysed, and subsequently the effects of these diversities on flower visitation, insect behaviour, pollination and seed set. ...|$|R
25|$|The {{transfer}} of pollen grains {{to the female}} reproductive structure (pistil in angiosperms) is called pollination. This transfer can be mediated by the wind, {{in which case the}} plant is described as anemophilous (literally wind-loving). Anemophilous plants typically produce great quantities of very lightweight pollen grains, sometimes with air-sacs. Non-flowering seed plants (e.g. pine trees) are characteristically anemophilous. Anemophilous flowering plants generally have inconspicuous flowers. <b>Entomophilous</b> (literally insect-loving) <b>plants</b> produce pollen that is relatively heavy, sticky and protein-rich, for dispersal by insect pollinators attracted to their flowers. Many insects and some mites are specialized to feed on pollen, and are called palynivores.|$|R
