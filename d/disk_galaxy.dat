25|$|Lenticular {{galaxies are}} {{unique in that}} they have a visible disk {{component}} as well as a prominent bulge component. They have much higher bulge-to-disk ratios than typical spirals and do not have the canonical spiral arm structure of late-type galaxies, yet may exhibit a central bar. This bulge dominance {{can be seen in the}} axis ratio (i.e. the ratio between the observed minor and major axial of a <b>disk</b> <b>galaxy)</b> distribution of a lenticular galaxy sample. The distribution for lenticular galaxies rises steadily in the range 0.25 to 0.85 whereas the distribution for spirals is essentially flat in that same range. Larger axial ratios can be explained by observing face-on disk galaxies or by having a sample of spheroidal (bulge-dominated) galaxies. Imagine looking at two disk galaxies edge-on, one with a bulge and one without a bulge. The galaxy with a prominent bulge will have a larger edge-on axial ratio compared to the galaxy without a bulge based on the definition of axial ratio. Thus a sample of disk galaxies with prominent spheroidal components will have more galaxies at larger axial ratios. The fact that the lenticular galaxy distribution rises with increasing observed axial ratio implies that lenticulars are dominated by a central bulge component.|$|E

In addition, the lack of tidal interactions over a Hubble time serves to suppress the overall star-formation rate as no external trigger is available to help clump the gas.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} Tully catalog of nearby galaxies to {{investigate}} the local pancaking effect on the orientation of <b>disk</b> <b>galaxies.</b> We first select only those edge-on <b>disk</b> <b>galaxies</b> in the catalog whose axis-ratios are less than 0. 1 to measure their spin axes unambiguously. A local pancake {{at the location of}} each selected galaxy is found as a plane encompassing the two nearest neighbor disks. Then, we examine statistically the inclinations of the galaxy spin axes relative to the local pancake planes. It is detected that the Tully <b>disk</b> <b>galaxies</b> tend to be inclined onto the local pancake planes, and the average inclination angles decrease with the pancake scale. We also construct a theoretical model for the inclination of <b>disk</b> <b>galaxies</b> relative to the local pancakes in the frame of the linear tidal torque theory. The comparison of the theoretical prediction with the observational result demonstrates a good agreement. Finally, we conclude that it is a first detection of the local pancaking effect on the orientation of <b>disk</b> <b>galaxies,</b> which is consistent with the scenario that the gravitational tidal field promotes the formation of pancakes on small mass scale.

50|$|The Lambda-CDM {{model is}} a cosmological model that {{explains}} {{the formation of the}} universe after the Big Bang. It is a relatively simple model that predicts many properties observed in the universe, including the relative frequency of different galaxy types; however, it underestimates the number of thin disk galaxies in the universe. The reason is that these galaxy formation models predict a large number of mergers. If disk galaxies merge with another galaxy of comparable mass (at least 15 percent of its mass) the merger will likely destroy, or at a minimum greatly disrupt the disk, and the resulting galaxy is not expected to be a <b>disk</b> <b>galaxy</b> (see next section).

The recent discovery of AGN in bulgeless <b>disk</b> <b>galaxies</b> suggests that halo concentration or virial mass {{may be one of the}} determining factors in BH mass.

Larger axial ratios can be explained by observing face-on disk galaxies or by having a sample of spheroidal (bulge-dominated) galaxies. Imagine looking at two disk galaxies edge-on, one with a bulge and one without a bulge. The galaxy with a prominent bulge will have a larger edge-on axial ratio compared to the galaxy without a bulge based on the definition of axial ratio. Thus a sample of disk galaxies with prominent spheroidal components will have more galaxies at larger axial ratios.
