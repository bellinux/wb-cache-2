40|$|The {{hydraulic}} power unit is the power source of a hydraulic system, and also the source causing hydraulic system vibration and noise. In order to further reduce the vibration and noise level of hydraulic systems, this paper presents a low-noise <b>hydraulic</b> <b>station</b> design method based on modal analysis and Vibration Transfer Function(VTF) analysis. The finite element model of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>station</b> is established, the mode of the oil station solved and the modal superposition method used to optimize {{the structure of the}} station and the installation position of the hydraulic pump. The optimal structure of the station and the improved installation location of the pump are obtained. The VTF is used to optimize the structure of the oil tank, and the influence of the pump vibration on the station is further reduced. The test results for vibration and noise show that the design method is effective in significantly reducing the vibration and noise of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>station.</b> The vibration acceleration of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>station</b> is reduced by 5. 7 dB, and the air noise is reduced by 2 dB. In short, this paper provides a better way for reducing the vibration and noise of hydraulic systems...|$|E

40|$|The mining robot, {{which has}} a large size and weight, is easy to slip and sink during the mining process. For this problem, we propose <b>hydraulic</b> <b>station</b> {{suspension}} technology in this paper. By using the technology, the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>station</b> is separated from the mining robot and designed as an independent floating body, which is helpful for increasing the travelling capability of mining robot. The relative position between the floating body and mining robot {{can be obtained by}} UKF. Based on this, we study a coordinated control algorithm for the floating body and mining robot in this paper. The coordinate motion controller, whose convergence is proved by LaSalle&# 39;s invariance principle, is designed according to the potential energy function of the floating body and mining robot. The algorithm is tested by using MATLAB. The results show that the coordination control algorithm can maintain the relative positions between the floating body and mining robot and make them do coordinate motion, which can be free from the effect of ocean current...|$|E
