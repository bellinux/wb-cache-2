Further wells should thus be drilled in unconfined aquifers since these are more susceptible to seismic waves. The Eskisehir region lies in the transition zone between the Aegean extensional domain and the compressible northern Anatolian block. Limnigraphs, installed in 19 exploration wells in the Eskisehir region, recorded pre-seismic, co-seismic and post-seismic level changes during the earthquakes of 17 August Izmit (Mw= 7. 4) and 12 November Duzce (Mw= 7. 2) 1999 that occurred along the North Anatolian Fault Zone. The Izmit and Duzce earthquakes affected groundwater levels, especially in confined aquifers. The aquifer characteristics before and after the earthquakes were unchanged so the aquifer is elastic in its behaviour. Further detailed geo-mechanical investigation of the confined aquifer in the Eskisehir region may improve understanding of earthquake prediction.

40|$|As {{a result}} of the United Nations’ International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction (1990 - 2000), and recent high profile {{disaster}}s, disaster risk reduction has climbed high on the international political agenda. There has been a paradigm shift from reacting to disasters towards preparing for and mitigating effects of disasters. Among the measures that have been highlighted on the disaster risk reduction agenda are early warning systems. In a Swedish context, there are needs for early warnings for various flood risk types. Municipalities carry big responsibilities for managing flood risks, and early warnings have a potential to facilitate decision-making and ultimately reduce flood losses. The aim of this thesis is to describe how a variety of flood warning signals are used in the risk management process of Swedish municipalities, how they can contribute to the flood risk reducing process, and which factors influence the success of this. The thesis is based on two papers. Paper I is based on interviews with three respondents from Swedish municipalities that have invested in and established local early warning systems. The paper shows that the possible effects from a local early warning system are not only reduced flood losses but also potential spinoff, the occurrence of which is dependent on the well-being of the organisation and its risk management processes. Paper II is based on interviews with 23 respondents at 18 Swedish municipalities, who have responsibilities related to flood risk management, and one respondent who works at SMHI with <b>hydrological</b> <b>warning.</b> The paper shows that municipalities can use a variety of complementary flood warning signals to facilitate decision-making for a proactive flood response. This is however not systematically the case, and is dependent on available resources. The theoretical contribution of this thesis is a development of existing conceptual models of early warning systems with respect to risk management and system contexts, and the use of complementary warning signals. Following the United Nations’ International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction (1990 - 2000), and recent high profile disasters, disaster risk reduction has climbed high on the international political agenda. Among the measures that have been highlighted are early warning systems – for Swedish municipalities who are responsible for managing flood risks, early warnings have a potential to facilitate decision-making and ultimately reduce flood losses. This licentiate thesis, based on two articles, aims to describe how a variety of flood warning signals are used in the risk management process of Swedish municipalities, how they can contribute to the flood risk reducing process, and which factors influence the success of this. The articles show that the possible effects from a local early warning system are not only reduced flood losses but also potential spin-off benefits, the occurrence of which is dependent on factors such as organisational culture and the functioning of the wider risk management system, and that municipalities can use a variety of complementary flood warning signals to facilitate decision-making for a proactive flood response which, however, is not systematically the case as benefits are dependent on available resources...|$|E
40|$|The dreadful floods of 1999, 2002 and 2003 in South of France have alerted {{public opinion}} {{on the need for}} a more {{efficient}} and a further generalized national flood-forecasting system. This is why in 2003 Irstea and Meteo-France have implemented a new warning method for flash floods, including on small watersheds, using radar rainfall data in real-time: the AIGA method. This modelling method currently provides real-time information on the magnitude of floods, but doesn’t take into account the elements at risk surrounding the river streams. Its benefit for crisis management is therefore limited as it doesn’t give information on the actual flood risk. To improve the relevance of the AIGA method, this paper shows the benefits of the combination of <b>hydrological</b> <b>warnings</b> with an exposure index, to be able to assess the risk of flood-related damage in real time. To complete this aim, this work presents an innovative and easily reproducible method to evaluate exposure to floods over large areas with simple land-use data. For validation purpose, a damage database has been implemented to test the relevance of both AIGA warnings and exposure levels. A case study on the floods of the 3 rd October 2015 is presented to test the effectiveness of the combination of hazard and exposure to assess the risk of flood-related damage. This combination seems to give an accurate overview of the streams at risk, where the most important amount of damage has been observed after the flood...|$|R

40|$|Damage due to {{flooding}} {{has increase}} {{in many countries}} in the last years, and due to the global climate change, which is now recognized as a real threat, {{an increase in the}} occurrence of flooding events and especially of flash flooding events is likely to continue into the future. In those conditions and because building new flood defences structures for defending vulnerable areas has serious financial implications, the timely forecasting of floods is becoming more important for flood defence and in general for water management purposes. The complexity of natural systems and of hydrological processes that influence river levels evolutions make the traditional modelling approaches, based on mirroring natural processes with physically based equations very difficult. Despite {{the fact that in the}} last decades the Operational Hydrological Forecasting Systems were significantly developed, becoming more and more complex systems, ingesting and processing in real time a great amount of data from automated hydrometrical and meteorological stations networks and high resolution grided data from radars and satellites, together with the use of distributed <b>hydrological</b> models, the <b>warning</b> and forecasts improvements are not very significant, in many cases the performance of the new physically based distributed models bein...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} radar–rain gauge merging {{algorithms}} to precisely analyse convective precipitation patterns is of high interest for many applications, e. g. <b>hydrological</b> modelling, thunderstorm <b>warnings,</b> and, as a reference, to spatially validate {{numerical weather prediction}} models. However, due to drawbacks of methods like cross-validation and due to the limited availability of reference data sets on high temporal and spatial scales, an adequate validation is usually hardly possible, especially on an operational basis. The present study evaluates the skill of very high-resolution and frequently updated precipitation analyses (rapid-INCA) {{by means of a}} very dense weather station network (WegenerNet), operated in a limited domain of the southeastern parts of Austria (Styria). Based on case studies and a longer-term validation over the convective season 2011, a general underestimation of the rapid-INCA precipitation amounts is shown by both continuous and categorical verification measures, although the temporal and spatial variability of the errors is – by convective nature – high. The contribution of the rain gauge measurements to the analysis skill is crucial. However, the capability of the analyses to precisely assess the convective precipitation distribution predominantly depends on the representativeness of the stations under the prevalent convective condition...|$|R

40|$|Hydrological drought is {{characterized}} as a substantial reduction in the availability {{of water in the}} <b>hydrological</b> cycle. Early <b>warning</b> systems help the community by assisting the development of drought mitigation planning. This study evaluates streamflow thresholds that are easy to use in real-time conditions of managing droughts. The easy applicability of the Standardized Hydrological Drought Index (SHDI) across time and space makes it a useful index for monitoring and assessing hydrological drought conditions. Two stations in the Yarra Catchment in Victoria (Australia) are used to evaluate hydrological drought characteristics at various time scales (3, 6, 9 and 12 -month scales). The calculated SHDI threshold values are transformed into the mean monthly streamflow threshold values for each of the selected time scales. The longer 12 -month scale exhibits a higher threshold value as it includes both dry and wet periods. Results show that mean monthly threshold values decrease with changes in the drought severity classes. The decreasing trend is more in the shorter time scale than that of longer time scales. In the case of mild drought (0 ≥SHDI≥- 0. 99), the threshold values exhibit insignificant deviation from the 12 -month scale to other time scales. However, these values show considerable differences from 12 -month scale in other severity classes. Monthly threshold values at 12 -month time scale are 1. 2, 1. 9, 2. 7 and 4. 1 times larger than the values at 3 -month scale considering different drought severity classes for the Aldermans creek station. The findings from this study informs the selection of a suitable time scale for proper drought assessment which is needed to forecast drought conditions critical for the development of measures to mitigate impacts of severe droughts...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSince {{medium and}} {{long-term}} precipitation forecasts {{are still not}} reliable enough, rough estimates {{of the degree of}} the extremity of forthcoming flood events that might occur in the course of dangerous meteorological situations approaching a basin could be useful to decision-makers as additional information for flood warnings. One approach to answering such a problem is to use real-time data on the soil moisture conditions in a catchment in conjunction with estimates of the extremity of the future rainfall and experience with the basin's behaviour during historical floods. A scenario-based method is proposed for such a future flood risk estimation, based on an a priori evaluation of the extremity of hypothetical floods generated by combinations of synthetic extreme precipitation and previously observed antecedent pre-flood basin saturations. The Hron river basin, located in central Slovakia, was chosen as the pilot basin in the case study. A time series of the basin's average daily precipitation was derived using spatial interpolation techniques. A lumped HBV-type daily conceptual rainfall-runoff model was adopted for modelling runoff. Analysis of the relationship of the modelled historical pre-flood soil moisture and flood causing-precipitation revealed the independence of both quantities for rainfall durations lasting 1 to 5 days. The basin's average annual maximum 1 to 5 day precipitation depths were analysed statistically and synthetic extreme precipitation scenarios associated with rainfall depths with return periods of 5, 20, 50 and 100 years, durations of 1 to 5 days and temporal distribution of extreme rainfall observed in the past were set up for runoff simulation. Using event-based flood simulations, synthetic flood waves were generated for random combinations of the rainfall scenarios and historical pre-flood soil moisture conditions. The effect of any antecedent basin saturation on the extremity of floods was quantified empirically and critical values of the basin saturation leading to floods with a higher return period than the return period of precipitation were identified. A method for implementing such critical values into flood risk <b>warnings</b> in a <b>hydrological</b> forecasting and <b>warning</b> system in the basin was suggested...|$|R
40|$|Flood {{early warning}} systems provide a {{potentially}} highly effective flood risk reduction measure. The effectiveness of early warning, however, {{is affected by}} forecasting uncertainty: the impossibility of knowing, in advance, the exact future state of <b>hydrological</b> systems. Early <b>warning</b> systems benefit from estimation of predictive uncertainties, i. e. by providing probabilistic forecasts. The present dissertation describes research in estimating the value of probabilistic forecasts {{as well as in}} skill improvement of estimates of predictive uncertainty. A framework for estimating the value of flood forecasts, expressed in flood risk, is proposed in Chapter 2. The framework includes the benefits of damage reduction through early warning as well as the costs associated with forecasting uncertainty. The latter manifests itself through instances of missed floods and false alarms. Application of the framework to a case study to the White Cart basin - a small river in Scotland - shows that probabilistic forecasts have higher value than deterministic forecasts. It also allows for deciding on an optimal warning lead time, where the combined benefits of damage reduction (which increase with increasing lead time) and costs of forecasting uncertainty (that also increase with increasing lead time) are most beneficial. Three post-processing approaches are investigated. The first approach (Chapter 3) comprises the statistical post-processing of meteorological forecasts and subsequent use thereof in hydrological forecasting. The analysis shows that while the quality of meteorological forecasts can be improved, the improvements do not proportionally propagate {{to the quality of the}} hydrological streamflow forecasts. It is believed that this is due to the inability of post-processing techniques to fully maintain the spatio-temporal correlations. The second approach comprises an exploration of potential improvements to the application of Quantile Regression as described by Weerts et al., 2011. These include the application of an explicit requirement for non-crossing quantiles, the exploration of the benefit of deriving the statistical models in Gaussian space and the derivation of multiple statistical models on several sub-domains of the predictor. The results indicate that the non-crossing quantiles comprise an improvement and that the other two potential improvements do not actually result in observable increase in forecast skill, hence that the post-processor may be simplified for use in operation practice without losing skill. The third approach explores the benefits - in terms of forecast skill - of a lumped post-processing approach versus separately addressing meteorological and hydrological uncertainties. The latter approach was found to yield sharper forecasts, but at the expense of reliability. Combined, this resulted in very similar skill scores with the source-specific approach offering more scope for improvement. The combined findings indicate that probabilistic forecasts have value and that there is scope for additional increase thereof. This is elaborated on in the Synthesis in Chapter 6. Also, recommendations for additional research are given. This includes research pertaining to value and skill of hydrological forecasts as well as to the use of forecasts in forecast, decision and response systems.
