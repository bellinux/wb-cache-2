60|$|On {{one evening}} just at this time--at the time, that <b>is,</b> <b>with</b> <b>which</b> {{we have been}} lately concerned--three persons were sitting in this room {{over a cup of}} tea. There was a gentleman, middle-aged, but none the worse on that account, who has already been {{introduced}} in these pages as Father Bernard M'Carthy. He was the parish priest of Drumbarrow; and as his parish comprised a portion of the town of Kanturk, he lived, not exactly in the town, but within a mile of it. His sister had married Mr. O'Dwyer of South Main Street, and therefore he was quite at home in the little back parlour of Mick O'Dwyer's house in Kanturk. Indeed Father Bernard was a man who made himself at home in the houses of most of his parishioners,--and of some who were not his parishioners.|$|E
6000|$|There {{are those}} who {{denounce}} us openly to their friends, and yet whisper to us softly that Senator Douglas is the aptest instrument there <b>is</b> <b>with</b> <b>which</b> to effect that object. They wish us to infer all, {{from the fact that}} he now has a little quarrel with the present head of the dynasty, and that he has regularly voted with us on a single point, upon which he and we have never differed. They remind us that he is a great man, and that the largest of us are very small ones. Let this be granted. But [...] "a living dog is better than a dead lion." [...] Judge Douglas, if not a dead lion, for this work is at least a caged and toothless one. How can he oppose the advances of slavery? He don't care anything about it. His avowed mission is impressing the [...] "public heart" [...] to care nothing about it. A leading Douglas Democratic newspaper thinks Douglas's superior talent will be needed to resist the revival of the African slave trade. Does Douglas believe an effort to revive that trade is approaching? He has not said so. Does he really think so? But if it is, how can he resist it? For years he has labored to prove it a sacred right of white men to take negro slaves into the new Territories. Can he possibly show that it is less a sacred right to buy them where they can be bought cheapest? And unquestionably they can be bought cheaper in Africa than in Virginia. He has done all in his power to reduce the whole question of slavery to one of a mere right of property; and, as such, how can he oppose the foreign slave trade, how can he refuse that trade in that [...] "property" [...] shall be [...] "perfectly free,"--unless he does it as a protection to the home production? And as the home producers will probably not ask the protection, he will be wholly without a ground of opposition.|$|E

St Francis also used to be led with a cord around his neck as a penitential exercise, the cord being a detail added to many depictions of the episode from two Old Testament passages. These are : [...] "He was oppressed and afflicted, yet he did not open his mouth; he was led like a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before its shearers is silent, so he did not open his mouth" [...] and [...] "I had been like a gentle lamb led to the slaughter...", {{both of which were}} very frequently cited by medieval commentaries.

5000|$|Newton's {{cannonball}} was {{a thought}} experiment used {{to bridge the}} gap between Galileo's gravitational acceleration and Kepler's elliptical orbits. It appeared in Newton's 1728 book A Treatise of the System of the World. According to Galileo's concept of gravitation, a dropped stone falls with constant acceleration down towards the Earth. However, Newton explains that when a stone is thrown horizontally (meaning sideways or perpendicular to Earth's gravity) it follows a curved path. [...] "For a stone projected is by the pressure of its own weight forced out of the rectilinear path, which by the projection alone it should have pursued, and made to describe a curve line in the air; and through that crooked way is at last brought down to the ground. And the greater the velocity <b>is</b> <b>with</b> <b>which</b> it is projected, the farther it goes before it falls to the Earth." [...] Newton further reasons that if an object were [...] "projected in an horizontal direction from the top of a high mountain" [...] with sufficient velocity, [...] "it would reach at last quite beyond the circumference of the Earth, and return to the mountain from which it was projected." ...|$|E

The focus of this thesis lies in improvements for the treatment planning, which is a multi-criteria process. We have been constructing a new method to form the Pareto front for certain objectives. For a Pareto optimal plan one objective cannot be improved without worsening another objective. The main question <b>is</b> <b>with</b> <b>which</b> plan the patient should be treated. To compare treatments we have developed a new method to look at other optimal solutions on the Pareto front around a given solution. This is done by quickly using of the reference point method. The main advantage is that, when a clinical isn’t pleased enough with a certain objective in a given solution, it is possible the optimize that objective some more.
