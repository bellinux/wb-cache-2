40|$|Dengue is a {{mosquito}} borne infection {{that in recent}} decades {{has become a major}} international public health concern. WHO currently estimated that 50 million dengue infections occur worldwide every year. Also dengue hemorrhagic fever is a leading cause of serious illness and death among children in Asian countries including India. Hence we planned to conduct a study in paediatric population. The study was conducted in department of microbiology from August 2011 to October 2012. A total of ninety children presenting with fever for more than three days were included in the study. Blood samples were analysed <b>for</b> <b>hematologic</b> <b>parameters</b> such as platelet count, total leukocyte count, differential leukocyte count. Serological diagnosis of dengue was done by IgG and IgM ELISA. Out of 90 children screened, 41 (45. 5 %) were positive for dengue. Of which, 16 (39 %) had dengue and 25 (61 %) had dengue hemorrhagic fever. Thrombocytopenia (96 %), elevated aminotransferases (96 %), Abdominal pain (92 %), hepatomegaly (92 %) were the common clinical presentations among children with dengue. This study facilitates distinguished detection of DHF from dengue fever based on warning symptoms and hematologic parameters, which is essential for optimal management of patient. Current study strongly suggests that detection of liver enzymes (aminotransferases) elevation can be used as an important marker in children progressing to DHF...|$|E
40|$|Reasons for {{performing}} study: To compare different platelet rich plasma production systems {{with regard to}} the composition of the end-product. Hypothesis: There are differences in resulting platelet and leukocyte concentrations and other characteristics using different techniques. Material/methods: blood from six horses was used to produce PRP with five different techniques. The end-products were analyzed <b>for</b> <b>hematologic</b> <b>parameters,</b> such as platelet and leukocyte concentrations, and growth factor levels, namely PDGF-BB and TGF-ß 1. Results: All systems showed an increase in platelets and growth factors compared to the baseline, but the differences between the systems were significant. Platelets increased in a range from 1. 33 to 6. 72 times compared to whole blood, PDGF-BB had a mean baseline of 0. 44 ng/mL in plasma and showed mean concentrations ranged from 0. 85 to 5. 27 ng/mL and mean TGF-ß 1 concentration increased in a range from 0. 6 to 1. 70 ng/mL in comparison with a mean baseline of 0. 30 ng/mL. Leucocyte concentrations varied a lot between the systems, with a decrease in one system and a mean increase ranging from 1. 46 to 7. 58 times the baseline in the other systems. Conclusions and potential relevance: This study revealed some interesting differences in hematologic parameters between different systems to prepare PRP. It also showed that there a great differences in growth factor concentrations between the systems. Leukocytes and its contribution to or negative effects on the healing process remain unclear. The findings of this study show the characteristics of PRP using several techniques that are commercially available.

Chronic inflammation is proposed {{as the basic}} pathophysiology of {{metabolic syndrome}} (MetS). Aim of the study: To compare mean {{white blood cell count}} between perimenopausal and postmenopausal women with and without MetS and find the prevalence of MetS in this patient group. Material and methods: A total of 140 healthy perimenopausal and postmenopausal women were interviewed and underwent anthropometric measurements, biochemical investigations <b>for</b> MetS and <b>hematologic</b> <b>parameters.</b> MetS was defined according to the Joint Interim Statement 2009 criteria. The outcome measures were the <b>hematologic</b> <b>parameters</b> between women with and without MetS, correlation of <b>hematologic</b> <b>parameters</b> with MetS components and optimum cutoff for MetS prediction. Results: The mean age of participants was 50 years. 63. 6 % were perimenopausal and 36. 4 % were postmenopausal ones. The prevalence of MetS was 21. 4 % (95 % CI: 15. 0 - 27. 9). The women with MetS had a significantly higher level of white blood cell (WBC) counts (7, 466. 7 and 6, 514. 6; p = 0. 006) and total lymphocyte counts (2, 572. 0 and 2, 207. 7; p = 0. 003).

Recently, additional <b>hematologic</b> <b>parameters</b> have emerged as potential indicators of worse outcome in this patient group. In a cohort of cervical cancer patients treated with chemoradiotherapy (CRT) and brachytherapy, {{we report on the}} prognostic significance of <b>hematologic</b> <b>parameters</b> including anemia, leukocytosis, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and thrombocytosis, the effect of combining anemia with other <b>hematologic</b> <b>parameters,</b> and the effect of changes in hemoglobin levels during treatment. Materials and methods: Two-hundred fifty-seven cervical cancer patients were retrospectively identified from a single cancer institution’s database. <b>Hematologic</b> <b>parameters</b> were categorized as: anemia (hemoglobin ≤ 115  g/L), leukocytosis (white blood cell count > 10  ×  109 /L), thrombocytosis (platelets > 400  ×  109 /L), and NLR (ratio > 5). The association between clinical factors and <b>hematologic</b> <b>parameters</b> on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were assessed at 5  years. Results: At 5  years, both pre-treatment anemia (PFS: 60 % vs 34 %, p <  0. 0001; OS: 68 % vs 41 %, p <  0. 0001) and on-treatment anemia (PFS: 62 % vs 40 %, p <  0. 0001; OS: 70 % vs 48 %, p <  0. 0001) were significantly associated with worse survival. This adverse effect on 5 -year PFS and OS was increased in patients with both pre-treatment anemia and leukocytosis (PFS: 72 % vs 42 %, p <  0. 0001; OS: 68 % vs 37 %, p <  0. 0001) and pre-treatment anemia and elevated NLR (PFS: 61 % vs 30 %, p <  0. 0001; OS: 68 % vs 37 %, p <  0. 0001). Five-year PFS (50 % vs 31 %) and OS (60 % vs 36 %) was better in patients whose pre-treatment anemia improved to normal hemoglobin levels on treatment vs those patients who were anemic both pre- and on-treatment. Conclusion: Pre-treatment and on-treatment anemia were significant, independent predictors of worse PFS and OS.

In their very well-designed and presented study, Gunes et al. [1] tried to assess the potential relationship between <b>hematologic</b> <b>parameters</b> and testicular torsion (TT). They showed {{significant differences in the}} neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, and platelet count between TT patients and healthy controls. There was no predictive role of mean platelet volume (MPV) in the diagnosis of TT. They also reported significantly high sensitivity and specificity for the NLR in the prediction of TT diagnosis. In addition, the NLR was significantly correlated with the duration of symptoms in TT patients. Routine peripheral blood counts may be useful in the diagnosis and prognosis of many disorders such as TT. White blood cell (WBC) count is one such beneficial inflammatory biomarker in clinical experience. Even if the WBC count is in the normal range, <b>hematologic</b> <b>parameters,</b> especially subtypes of WBCs like the NLR, have been shown to play a predictive role in the prognosis of acute and chronic inflammatory processes.

We reviewed the clinical and laboratory features of patients with newly diagnosed myeloma bone disease and evaluated the prognostic significance of different X-ray image patterns in symptomatic MM patients. We retrospectively reviewed 260 patients with newly diagnosed MM. X-ray image patterns of patients were correlated with <b>hematologic</b> <b>parameters,</b> therapeutic reaction and patient survival. Patients with the X-ray imaging pattern of grade 2 – 4 had significantly higher marrow plasma cells levels, marrow CD 138 + D 38 + cell percentage, ECOG performance score, and serum IL- 6 level than grade 0 – 1. Univariate analysis demonstrated that skeletal lytic changes associated with rapid progression. There is a high incidence of myeloma bone disease (MBD) in patients of MM in China. Patients of extensive bone lesions have more severe alterations in <b>hematologic</b> <b>parameters</b> than do those without bone lesions and severe bone lesions is an important adverse prognostic factor associated with a short TTP...|$|R

40|$|Thalassemias are pathologies that {{derive from}} genetic defects of the globin genes. The most common defects among the {{population}} affect the genes {{that are involved in}} the synthesis of and β chains. The main aspects of these pathologies are well explained from a biochemical and genetic point of view. The diagnosis is fundamentally based on hematologic and genetic tests. A genetic analysis is particularly important to determine the carriers of α-thalassemia, whose identification by means of the <b>hematologic</b> <b>parameters</b> is more difficult in comparison with heterozygotes for β-thalassemia. This work investigates the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) for the classification of thalassemic pathologies using the <b>hematologic</b> <b>parameters</b> resulting from hemochromocytometric analysis only. Different combinations of ANNs are reported, which allow thalassemia carriers to be discriminated from normals with 94 % classification accuracy, 92 % sensitivity, and 95 % specificity. On the basis of these results, an automated system that allows real-time support for diagnoses is proposed. The automated system interfaces a hemochromo analyzer to a simple PC...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundStudies {{of workers}} exposed to benzene at average air {{concentrations}} below one part per million suggest that benzene, a known hematotoxin, causes hematopoietic damage even at low exposure levels. However, {{evidence of such}} effects outside of occupational settings and for other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is limited. ObjectiveTo investigate associations between ambient exposures to five VOCs, including benzene, and <b>hematologic</b> <b>parameters</b> among adult residents of the U. S. Gulf Coast. Materials and MethodsBlood concentrations of selected VOCs were measured {{in a sample of}} adult participants in the Gulf Long-term Follow-up Study (GuLF STUDY) during 2012 and 2013. Complete blood counts with differentials were also performed on a subset of participants (n= 406). We used these data together with detailed questionnaire data to estimate adjusted associations between blood BTEXS (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, o-xylene, m/p-xylene, and styrene) concentrations and <b>hematologic</b> <b>parameters</b> using generalized linear models. ResultsWe observed inverse associations between blood benzene concentrations and hemoglobin concentration and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, and a positive association with red cell distribution width among tobacco smoke-unexposed participants (n= 146). Among tobacco smoke-exposed participants (n= 247), we observed positive associations between blood VOC concentrations and several <b>hematologic</b> <b>parameters,</b> including increased white blood cell and platelet counts, suggestive of hematopoietic stimulation typically associated with tobacco smoke exposure. Most associations were stronger for benzene than for the other VOCs. ConclusionsOur results suggest that ambient exposure to BTEXS, particularly benzene, may be associated with hematologic effects, including decreased hemoglobin concentration, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, and increased red cell distribution width.

40|$|The South African clawed frogs Xenopus laevis and X. tropicalis {{are fully}} aquatic {{amphibians}} and well-established animal models. Because genetically engineered laboratory Xenopus {{are now being}} produced, the establishment of normal reference ranges for serum biochemical and <b>hematologic</b> <b>parameters</b> is essential <b>for</b> phenotyping and as a diagnostic aide. We determined normal reference ranges <b>for</b> <b>hematologic</b> values from 3 populations of X. laevis: wild-caught frogs (n = 43) and frogs from 2 commercial sources (A, n = 166; B, n = 109). For serum biochemistry, we determined normal reference ranges for frogs from source A and wild-caught frogs divided by sex and season. Significant differences across populations were found in WBC and RBC counts, hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, and mean corpuscular volume. Among serum biochemical analytes, {{significant differences were found}} for albumin:globulin ratio, anion gap, and concentrations of albumin, globulin, total protein, lipase, alanine transaminase, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase; creatine phosphokinase; indirect, direct, and total bilirubin; cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein lipase, carbon dioxide, glucose, lactacte dehydrogenase, calcium, chloride, and sodium. We hypothesize that these differences can be attributed to differences in water quality, habitat, ambient temperature, diet, sex, recent transport or shipment, and genetic background. However, testing that hypothesis {{is beyond the scope of}} the current study. In addition, clinical chemistry and hematologic reference range values Xenopus laevis are quite distinct from those for other species and are most consistent with the only values published for another fully aquatic amphibian, the Eastern hellbender (Cryptobranchus alleganiensis) ...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedWe {{sought to determine}} whether sex {{had a significant effect}} on the hematologic and serum chemistry analytes in adult sand rats (Psammomys obestls) maintained under normal laboratory conditions. According to the few data available for this species, we hypothesized that levels of hematologic and serum chemistry analytes would not differ significantly between clinically normal male and female sand rats. Data analysis revealed several significant differences in <b>hematologic</b> <b>parameters</b> between male and female sand rats but none for serum biochemistry analytes. The following <b>hematologic</b> <b>parameters</b> were greater in male than in female sand rats: RBC count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, red cell hemoglobin content, and percentage monocytes. Red cell distribution width, hemoglobin distribution width, mean platelet volume, and percentage lymphocytes were greater in female than in male sand rats. The sex of adult sand rats is a source of variation that must be considered in terms of clinical and research data. The data presented here likely will prove useful in the veterinary medical management of sand rat colonies and provide baseline hematologic and serum chemistry analyte information for researchers wishing to use this species...|$|R
40|$|In {{patients}} on hemodialysis, a metabolic block of the pentose phosphate shunt {{has been described}} that impairs the reduction of oxidized glutathione. The block results in lack of detoxication of the free hydroxyl radicals produced inside the red blood cell (RBC) and causes oxidative damage to the polyunsaturated fatty acids of the RBC membrane that results in formation of aldehydes. Malonyldialdehyde {{has been used as}} an index of the oxidative damage. In a study group of 13 {{patients on}} hemodialysis, the authors have tested whether administering reduced glutathione (GSH) at 1200 mg/day for 1 month could minimize oxidative damage to the RBC membranes and improve the <b>hematologic</b> <b>parameters.</b> Treatment with GSH was followed by significant improvement of hematocrit (P = 0. 008), hemoglobin (P = 0. 03), and RBC count (P = 0. 0037); however, oxidative damage to the membranes was increased (P = 0. 0004), which suggests that improvement of the <b>hematologic</b> <b>parameters</b> is not related to reduction of the oxidative damage. This is because oxidized glutathione, formed in the oxidative process, cannot be reduced back to GSH because of alteration of the pentose phosphate shunt...|$|R
40|$|We have {{explored}} biochemical and <b>hematologic</b> <b>parameters</b> that might indicate acute humoral xenograft rejection (AHXR) following pig organ transplantation in baboons. Baboons (n = 15) received an immunosuppressive regimen, and underwent a miniature swine or hDAF kidney (Group 1, n = 6) or heart (Group 2, n = 7) transplantation. Control baboons (Group 3, n = 2) received the immunosuppressive regimen without organ transplantation. Blood chemistry and <b>hematologic</b> <b>parameters</b> were measured daily. Baboon and porcine cytomegalovirus were monitored. In Groups 1 and 2, organ grafts survived {{for up to}} 29 days. A plasma fibrinogen of 600 U/L and aspartate transaminase of > 300 U/L, {{were associated with the}} development of AHXR in both heart and kidney grafts. In Group 1, a decrease in platelet count of > 150, 000 /microL within 3 days, or a count of 500 U/L was associated with graft failure. In Group 3, no abnormalities were observed. The possibility that porcine CMV {{may play a role in}} graft injury could not be excluded. Noninvasive parameters were identified that have predictive potential for AHXR. Monitoring of these might enable therapeutic intervention to reverse rejection...|$|R
