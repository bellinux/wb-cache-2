40|$|We propose in {{this paper}} a novel {{two-stage}} Projection Correction Modeling (PCM) framework for image reconstruction from (non-uniform) Fourier measurements. PCM consists of a projection stage (P-stage) motivated by the multi-scale Galerkin method and a correction stage (C-stage) with an <b>edge</b> <b>guided</b> regularity fusing together the advantages of total variation (TV) and total fractional variation (TFV). The P-stage allows for continuous modeling of the underlying image of interest. The given measurements are projected onto a space in which the image is well represented. We then enhance the reconstruction result at the C-stage that minimizes an energy functional consisting of a fidelity in the transformed domain and a novel <b>edge</b> <b>guided</b> regularity. We further develop efficient proximal algorithms to solve the corresponding optimization problem. Various numerical results in both 1 D signals and 2 D images have also been presented to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed two-stage method to other classical one-stage methods.

40|$|Image {{denoising}} {{is a well}} studied field, yet reducing {{noise from}} images is still a valid challenge. Recently proposed Block-matching and 3 D filtering (BM 3 D) is {{the current state of}} the art algorithm for denoising images corrupted by Additive White Gaussian noise (AWGN). Though BM 3 D outperforms all existing methods for AWGN denoising, still its performance decreases as the noise level increases in images, since it is harder to find proper match for reference blocks in the presence of highly corrupted pixel values. It also blurs sharp edges and textures. To overcome these problems we proposed an <b>edge</b> <b>guided</b> BM 3 D with selective pixel restoration. For higher noise levels it is possible to detect noisy pixels form its neighborhoods gray level statistics. We exploited this property to reduce noise as much as possible by applying a pre-filter. We also introduced an <b>edge</b> <b>guided</b> pixel restoration process in the hard-thresholding step of BM 3 D to restore the sharpness of edges and textures.

40|$|Compressive sensing (CS) reconstructs {{images from}} {{a small number of}} projections. We propose EdgeCS- <b>edge</b> <b>guided</b> CS reconstruction- to recover images of higher qualities from fewer {{measurements}} than the current state-of-the-art methods. Accurate edge information can significantly improve image recovery quality and speed, but such information is encoded in the CS measurements of an image. To take advantage of edge information in CS recovery, EdgeCS alternatively performs CS reconstruction and edge detection in a way that each benefits from the latest solution of the other. EdgeCS is fast and returns high-quality images. It exactly recovers the 256 × 256 Shepp-Logan phantom from merely 7 radial lines (or 3. 03 % k-space), which is impossible for most existing algorithms. It accurately reconstructs a 512 × 512 magnetic resonance image from 21 % noisy samples. Moreover, it is also able to reconstruct complex-valued images.

40|$|Demosaicking and zooming are {{important}} {{for the quality of}} digital images in resource-constrained single chip devices such as wireless camera phones and vision-based pocket devices. The color artifacts introduced in the demosaicking process can be magnified in the subsequent zooming process and vice versa. This paper presents a joint demosaicking-zooming scheme by exploiting the fact that red/green and blue/green color difference signals are much smoother than the original red, green and blue signals. The color difference signals are computed using the high spectral-spatial correlations in the color filter array (CFA) image. The computed color difference signals are used to recover the green channel, which is then enlarged using an <b>edge</b> <b>guided</b> zooming scheme. The enlarged red and blue channels are obtained by adding the correspondingly enlarged red/green and blue/green color difference images to the enlarged green channel. Experimental results show that the proposed joint demosaicking-zooming scheme performs well in both visual perception and PSNR measurement, suppressing many color artifacts arising from demosaicking as well as zippers and rings arising from zooming.

40|$|In this work, we {{consider}} the image super-resolution (SR) problem. The main challenge of image SR is to recover high-frequency details of a low-resolution (LR) image that are important for human perception. To address this essentially ill-posed problem, we introduce a Deep <b>Edge</b> <b>Guided</b> REcurrent rEsidual~(DEGREE) network to progressively recover the high-frequency details. Different from most of existing methods that aim at predicting high-resolution (HR) images directly, DEGREE investigates an alternative route to recover {{the difference between a}} pair of LR and HR images by recurrent residual learning. DEGREE further augments the SR process with edge-preserving capability, namely the LR image and its edge map can jointly infer the sharp edge details of the HR image during the recurrent recovery process. To speed up its training convergence rate, by-pass connections across multiple layers of DEGREE are constructed. In addition, we offer an understanding on DEGREE from the view-point of sub-band frequency decomposition on image signal and experimentally demonstrate how DEGREE can recover different frequency bands separately. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets clearly demonstrate the superiority of DEGREE over well-established baselines and DEGREE also provides new state-of-the-arts on these datasets...|$|R

In the treatment of the problem, eigenfunction expansion in terms of spherical vector wave functions is employed. A complete dyadic Green’s function for the spherical impedance boss {{at the edge}} is developed and through decomposing the dyadic Green’s function, it can be observed that the contribution of the scatterer is separated from the wedge. It is shown that the scattering is highly enhanced by the <b>edge</b> <b>guided</b> waves. For the general case of irregularly shaped scatterer the solution is extended using T-matrix method. The method is implemented by replacing free space Green’s function with the dyadic Green’s function of the PEC wedge. The solution is verified by applying it to the case of spherical scatterer and results are compared with the dyadic Green’s function solution. The T-matrix solution is generalized for the multiple scatterer case. Numerical results are obtained for two impedance scatterers at the edge and compared with the PEC case. Ghassemiparvin, BehnamM.

The main reason of this effect is due to not consideration of image edges & sharp details during enhancement process. On the other hand, the human visual system is more sensitive to edges and sharp details of image. In this paper we are proposing a method titled efficient contrast Enhancement using Kernel Padding and DWT with Image Fusion that Enhances the contrast of Images that has varying intensity distribution specially satellite images, preserve the brightness of images, sharpens the edges and remove the blurriness of images. Basically this is a pixel based <b>edge</b> <b>guided</b> image fusion technique. In this method LL sub band of Image DWT is processed by contrast enhancement section where based on image brightness level image is decomposed in different layers and then each layers intensity is stressed or compressed by generated intensity transformation function.

The HBT is characterized by implanted contacts and by an exalted spacer oxide on the emitter mesa <b>edges.</b> <b>Guides</b> are connected by means of a well-planarizing auxiliary polyimide layer. The entire chip is covered with passivating SiO_ 2. Two-layer metallization can be applied due to low-stepped individual sections. The relatively great base-collector capacity at the present stage of development is due to the existing simple mask technique as well as to preliminary base contacting in an additional contact zone. The low collector doping of 3 x 10 " 1 " 6 /cm" 3 which is selected for integrated circuits reduces the critical frequency of the individual transistor and adds to problems which result from e. g. line and valence band offsets. The maximum HBT transit frequency has been amounting to 40 GHz. Sputtered WSi_ 2 films on SiO_ 2 are used for implementation of integrated-circuit resistances.
