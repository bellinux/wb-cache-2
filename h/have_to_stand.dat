5|$|Gamble's men mounted {{determined}} {{resistance and}} delaying tactics from behind fence posts with rapid fire from their breech-loading carbines. It {{is a modern}} myth that they were armed with multi-shot repeating carbines. Nevertheless, {{they were able to}} fire two or three times faster than a muzzle-loaded carbine or rifle. Also, the breech-loading design meant that Union troops did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> to reload and could do so safely behind cover. This was a great advantage over the Confederates, who still had to stand to reload, thus providing an easier target. But this was so far a relatively bloodless affair. By 10:20 a.m., the Confederates had reached Herr Ridge and had pushed the Federal cavalrymen east to McPherson Ridge, when the vanguard of the I Corps finally arrived, the division of Maj. Gen. James S. Wadsworth. The troops were led personally by Gen. Reynolds, who conferred briefly with Buford and hurried back to bring more men forward.|$|E
5|$|The {{new party}} {{was a direct}} {{challenge}} to Kenyatta'a rule, and soon after its creation the Kenyan Parliament amended the constitution {{to ensure that the}} defectors—who had originally been elected on the KANU ticket—could not automatically retain their seats and would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> for re-election. This resulted in the election of June 1966. The Luo increasingly rallied around the KPU, which experienced localized violence that hindered its ability to campaign, although Kenyatta's government officially disavowed this violence. Of the 29 defectors, only 9 were re-elected on the KPU ticket; Odinga was among them, having retained his Central Nyanza seat with a high majority. Odinga was replaced as Vice President by Joseph Murumbi, who in turn would be replaced by Moi.|$|E
5|$|The three Britons {{were brought}} to trial on 6 April 1826. Lehuby, still in the Netherlands, was tried in absentia. The Crown prosecution's case was seriously {{hampered}} by his absence, particularly because many key documents were {{with him in the}} Netherlands. The prosecutor alleged a complex conspiracy between MacGregor, Lehuby and their associates to profit personally from a fraudulent land concession and loan prospectus. MacGregor's lawyer, a Frenchman called Merilhou, asserted that if anything untoward had occurred, the missing managing director should be held culpable; there was no proof of a conspiracy, he said, and MacGregor could have been himself defrauded by Lehuby. The prosecutor conceded that there was insufficient evidence to prove his case, complimented MacGregor for co-operating with the investigation fairly and openly, and withdrew the charges. The three judges confirmed the defendants' release—"a full and perfect acquittal", Hippisley would write—but days later the French authorities succeeded in having Lehuby extradited, and the three men learned they would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> trial again.|$|E

25|$|Police {{notebooks}} {{are carried}} {{in a variety of}} ways, and several pieces of equipment are available which police officers may use to hold their PNBs and other papers they need while on patrol. Police notebooks themselves also <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> up to harsh environments such as wind and rain, therefore the paper used is usually waterproof and untearable.|$|E
25|$|A seventh step {{could in}} {{principle}} be added, namely a big crisis in society which sparks off a revolution and overturns the existing capitalist system. In that case, {{it could be}} argued, the false masks are torn off, and people <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> up for what they really are, and what they really believe in. But that is a possibility which Marx did not comprehensively theorize in Das Kapital.|$|E

25|$|However, as Ebanks {{had already}} been {{declared}} elected, {{it was determined that}} the result would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> until overturned by an election petition, to be brought by the defeated Labour candidate. Birmingham City Council announced that they would not contest the petition, although Ebanks did so. The petition was presented to the High Court in July 2006 and accepted; the result was thus overturned. Labour's Catherine Grundy was declared the rightful winner and immediately took Ebanks's place on the council.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, Millennium Partners and Ritz-Carlton {{who built}} the Ritz-Carlton Hotel & Towers {{just around the corner}} from Saint Francis House, funded the {{construction}} of a large atrium in Saint Francis House so that the homeless would not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> in lines in the street waiting to get in. Saint Francis House had originally approached the developers to build the atrium out of an unused outdoor parking lot, so that homeless guests would not have to wait on the street in long lines.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason for}} the sad state of public transit is a very basic one - the transit systems just do not offer a service which will attract people away from their automobiles. Consequently, their {{patronage}} comes very largely from those who cannot drive, either because they are too young, too old, or because they are too poor to own and operate an automobile. Look {{at it from the}} standpoint of a commuter who lives in a suburb and is trying to get to work in the central business district (CBD). If he is going to go by transit, a typical scenario might be the following: he must first walk to the closest bus stop, let us say a five or ten minute walk, and then he may have to wait up to another ten minutes, possibly in inclement weather, for the bus to arrive. When it arrives, he may <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> unless he is lucky enough to find a seat. The bus will be caught up in street congestion and move slowly, and it will make many stops completely unrelated to his trip objective. The bus may then let him off at a terminal to a suburban train. Again he must wait, and, after boarding the train, again experience a number of stops {{on the way to the}} CBD, and possibly again he may <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> in the aisle. He will get off at the station most convenient to his destination and possibly have to transfer again onto a distribution system. It is no wonder that in those cities where ample inexpensive parking is available, most of those who can drive do drive.|$|E

25|$|When Laurence Olivier {{gave his}} {{acclaimed}} performance of Othello at the Royal National Theatre (UK) in 1964, {{he had developed}} a case of stage fright that was so profound {{that when he was}} alone onstage, Frank Finlay (who was playing Iago) would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> offstage where Olivier could see him to settle his nerves. This performance was recorded complete on LP, and filmed by popular demand in 1965 (according to a biography of Olivier, tickets for the stage production were notoriously hard to get). The film version still holds the record for the most Oscar nominations for acting ever given to a Shakespeare film — Olivier, Finlay, Maggie Smith (as Desdemona) and Joyce Redman (as Emilia, Iago's wife) were all nominated for Academy Awards.|$|E
25|$|Contact lenses {{are often}} {{categorized}} by their replacement schedule. Single use lenses (called 1-day or daily disposables) are discarded after one use. Because {{they do not}} <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> up to {{the wear and tear}} of repeated uses, these lenses can be made thinner and lighter, greatly improving their comfort. Lenses replaced frequently gather fewer deposits of allergens and germs, making these lenses preferable for patients with ocular allergies or for those who are prone to infection. Single-use lenses are also useful for people who wear contact lenses infrequently, or when losing a lens is likely or not easily replaced (such as when on vacation). They are also considered useful for children because cleaning or disinfecting is not needed, leading to improved compliance.|$|E
25|$|Ion Iliescu is {{mentioned}} in {{the report of the}} Council of Europe investigator into illegal activities of the CIA in Europe, Dick Marty. He is pointed out as {{one of the people who}} authorized or at least knew about and <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> accountable for torture prisons at Mihail Kogălniceanu airbase from 2003 to 2005. In April 2015, Iliescu confirmed that he had granted a CIA request for a site in Romania, but was not aware of the nature of the site, describing it as a small gesture of goodwill to an ally in advance of Romania's eventual accession to NATO. Iliescu further stated that had he known of the intended use of the site, he would certainly not have approved the request.|$|E

500|$|Conversely, The A.V. Club {{reviewer}} Myles McNutt {{gave the}} episode a C- rating and criticized the episode's lack of complexity.

[...] In a review for the subsequent episode, [...] "After Hours", however, McNutt acknowledged that, [...] "If I'm being honest with , last week's probably should have been above a 'C-,' but I went with my gut and <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> by that decision." ...|$|E
