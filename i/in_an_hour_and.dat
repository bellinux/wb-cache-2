5|$|Jake Gyllenhaal was {{the first}} to be cast in the film; after {{receiving}} the script, he read it <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> immediately contacted Ayer. Michael Peña was cast shortly after, following a string of auditions. He and Gyllenhaal did not bond immediately but gradually became close friends over the process of training and filming. Gyllenhaal and Peña undertook five months of intensive training under the guidance of FitzSimons to prepare for their roles—this included 12-hour ride-alongs with multiple Greater Los Angeles Area law enforcement agencies up to three times a week, as well as training in hand-to-hand combat, police tactics and weapons. On his first ride-along, Gyllenhaal witnessed a murder during a drug bust. Tactical training was also given to the other actors playing police officers, including David Harbour, America Ferrera, Cody Horn, and Frank Grillo.|$|E

25|$|He toured Australia {{twice and}} England once with New Zealand cricket {{teams in the}} period before New Zealand played Tests. In 1927, in a strong batting side, he was a success with 1,070 runs {{at an average of}} 31.47 in the {{first-class}} matches. In the first innings of the match against Marylebone Cricket Club he scored 107 <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> a half. Though he returned to New Zealand the following winter, in 1928 he was back in England where he spent two years playing occasional cricket before becoming qualified to play County Championship matches for Gloucestershire.|$|E
25|$|Bob Barber (48) was {{determined}} to attack the Australian bowling from the get go, but was outpaced by Geoff Boycott (51) as they made 88 <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> 98 for the first wicket. John Edrich (109), Ken Barrington (64), Colin Cowdrey (104), Mike Smith (41), Jim Parks (71) and Fred Titmus (56 not out) piled up 558 as England made their biggest total down under since their 636 in the Second Test in 1928–29. Titmus was hit {{on the back of}} the head by a bouncer from Alan Connolly, but continued to play and hit three quick boundaries. They batted the into the fourth day and the long suffering Garth McKenzie took 5/134 off 35.2 eight-ball overs, which if nothing else confirmed his reputation of taking wickets on good batting tracks.|$|E
25|$|Li next {{played at}} the Apia International, at which she made {{consecutive}} finals the two previous years, winning in 2011. She was pushed to the limit by Christina McHale but had little trouble with Ayumi Morita. She met young American Madison Keys in the quarterfinals who {{proved to be a}} tougher challenge, with Li prevailing in three tight sets to book a semifinal showdown with world No. 4 Agnieszka Radwańska. Li looked the winner {{in the early stages of}} the match, but somewhat faltered, producing a high number of unforced errors which handed Radwańska the first set. She saved four match points on Radwańska's serve in the ninth game of the second set and three on her own serve in the tenth game. However, eventually she succumbed to the pressure and a half-volley into the net sealed the win for Radwańska <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> 32 minutes, putting an end to Li Na's Sydney reign.|$|E

25|$|The {{tropical}} storm remnant of Hurricane Hazel caused 81 deaths in October 1954 due to flooding that swept homes along river banks into Lake Ontario. A sudden downburst during a strong thunderstorm {{was believed to}} have played a contributing factor in the Air France Flight 358 crash in August 2005 {{and just a few}} weeks later record-breaking intense rainfall, the worst since Hazel, deluged north-central sections of the city within a couple of hours resulting in record insurance claims. Some rain gauges recorded 175mm (7") of rain, over 100mm (4") in just one hour. Another large rainstorm with intense, record rainfall amounts struck a wide swath of the city during the afternoon rush hour on July 8, 2013 flooding city streets, subway tunnels, basements and knocking out power for over 2 million residents, stranding commuters, some having to be rescued from a submerged train. A daily rainfall record of 126.4mm (5") was set at Pearson Airport, most falling <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> a half. Flood insurance claims are likely to exceed the 2005 storm due to a wider area affected.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the great}} {{strengths}} of the team was its plentiful all-rounders, apart from Keith Miller, there was Ray Lindwall, Colin McCool, Ian Johnson and the wicketkeeper Don Tallon. Lindwall took to fast bowling after seeing Harold Larwood as a boy, but was a strong striker of the ball and a menace to parked cars in grade cricket. In the Third Test he hit exactly 100 off 90 balls with 14 fours and a six and added 154 <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> a half with Tallon, whose 92 off 108 balls with 10 fours was the highest score by an Australian wicketkeeper until Rod Marsh made 132 against New Zealand in 1973–74. Like Tallon Ian Johnson never quite batted as well as expected, but topped the averages in the 1954-55 Ashes series by making 116 runs (58.00). McCool made 95 in the First Test and 104 not out in the Third, {{when he came in}} at 188/5 and dominated the strike. He was a good player of spin with wristy cuts and vigorous hooks.|$|E
25|$|England's total {{could have}} been {{significantly}} higher with a bit more top-order application, especially given the high scoring rate. However, England's bowlers started well when Steve Harmison bowled a maiden over first up to Justin Langer, and Matthew Hayden holed out to Harmison's new-ball partner Matthew Hoggard for a golden duck – the first of Hayden's Test career. Then, Ricky Ponting and Justin Langer hit runs just as quickly as England had done, before the umpire's finger went up twice more before lunch; Ricky Ponting swept a shot off Ashley Giles to the opposing captain Vaughan for 61, and Damien Martyn was run out taking a single for 20. Langer and Michael Clarke continued after lunch in the same vein, hitting 76 runs <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> a half, {{but a couple of}} wickets within five overs took Australia to 208 for 5, needing 199 for the last five wickets for parity. The partnership between Langer and Gilchrist saw them to tea with no further loss, as Langer continued his four-hour unbeaten knock and went into the tea break on 72.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} of Mesopotamian clay tablets date from 1800 to 1600 BC, and cover topics which include fractions, algebra, quadratic and cubic equations, and {{the calculation of}} regular reciprocal pairs. The tablets also include multiplication tables and methods for solving linear and quadratic equations. The Babylonian tablet YBC 7289 gives an approximation of √2 accurate to five decimal places. Babylonian mathematics were written using a sexagesimal (base-60) numeral system. From this derives the modern day usage of 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour,</b> <b>and</b> 360 (60 x 6) degrees in a circle, {{as well as the}} use of minutes and seconds of arc to denote fractions of a degree. Babylonian advances in mathematics were facilitated by the fact that 60 has many divisors: the reciprocal of any integer which is a multiple of divisors of 60 has a finite expansion in base 60. (In decimal arithmetic, only reciprocals of multiples of 2 and 5 have finite decimal expansions.) Also, unlike the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans, the Babylonians had a true place-value system, where digits written in the left column represented larger values, much as in the decimal system. They lacked, however, an equivalent of the decimal point, and so the place value of a symbol often had to be inferred from the context.|$|E
25|$|Babylonian {{mathematics}} {{were written}} using a sexagesimal (base-60) numeral system. From this derives the modern day usage of 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour,</b> <b>and</b> 360 (60 x 6) degrees in a circle, {{as well as}} the use of seconds and minutes of arc to denote fractions of a degree. It is likely the sexagesimal system was chosen because 60 can be evenly divided by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20 and 30. Also, unlike the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans, the Babylonians had a true place-value system, where digits written in the left column represented larger values, much as in the decimal system. The power of the Babylonian notational system lay in that it could be used to represent fractions as easily as whole numbers; thus multiplying two numbers that contained fractions was no different than multiplying integers, similar to our modern notation. The notational system of the Babylonians was the best of any civilization until the Renaissance, and its power allowed it to achieve remarkable computation accuracy and power; for example, the Babylonian tablet YBC 7289 gives an approximation of √2 accurate to five decimal places. The Babylonians lacked, however, an equivalent of the decimal point, and so the place value of a symbol often had to be inferred from the context. By the Seleucid period, the Babylonians had developed a zero symbol as a placeholder for empty positions; however it was only used for intermediate positions. This zero sign does not appear in terminal positions, thus the Babylonians came close but did not develop a true place value system.|$|E
25|$|Federer next {{played at}} his {{eleventh}} ATP World Tour Finals, {{where he was}} the two-time defending champion. He was drawn into Group B, which included David Ferrer of Spain, Juan Martín del Potro of Argentina, and Janko Tipsarević of Serbia. He first faced Tipsarević, and dropped only eight points on serve en route to defeating him in straight sets <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> nine minutes. With his win over Tipsarević, Federer recorded his fortieth ATP World Tour Finals win, surpassing Ivan Lendl's record of ATP World Tour Finals win. Federer then played Ferrer, and beat him in a tight second-set tiebreak after Federer clinched the first set on a break of Ferrer's serve. Federer's win marked his fourteenth consecutive win over Ferrer and also qualified him for the semifinals. Federer played del Potro to wrap up the round robin, and found himself one set down after del Potro clinched a first-set tiebreak. Federer broke del Potro early in the second set, and held the lead to level the match at one set all. However, del Potro responded by breaking him early in the third set, and Federer's unforced errors ultimately cost him the game and the match. Federer's loss meant that his streak of 12 matches won at the ATP World Tour Finals was broken. Even with the loss, Federer finished first in the group, and advanced to the semifinals, where he faced Andy Murray, who he had last played at the Shanghai Rolex Masters. Murray started out strong, breaking Federer in {{the first game of the}} set, but Federer recovered by breaking Murray later in the set. The first set eventually went to a tiebreak, and Federer found himself with two set points, converting the second to take a one-set lead. Federer then flew through the second set, breaking Murray twice en route to winning the match in just over an hour and a half. With his win, Federer advanced to his eighth final, where he played Novak Djokovic. Federer held an early lead in the first set, but Djokovic managed to level the set and ended up pulling out to a one-set lead after winning a very tight first-set tiebreak. In the second set, Djokovic was able to convert a decisive break point on Federer's serve late in the set and he subsequently served out the match to win his second end of season Championship. The loss denied Federer a chance to tie Ivan Lendl's record of three consecutive ATP World Tour Finals titles. Federer's loss also cost him a chance at tying John McEnroe's record of 77 career titles won.|$|E
