5|$|Anxiety <b>disorder</b> <b>and</b> major {{depressive}} disorder are {{the most}} common conditions seen at the same time; comorbidity of these in persons with AS is estimated at 65%. Reports have associated AS with medical conditions such as aminoaciduria and ligamentous laxity, but these have been case reports or small studies and no factors have been associated with AS across studies. One study of males with AS found an increased rate of epilepsy and a high rate (51%) of nonverbal learning disorder. AS is associated with tics, Tourette syndrome, and bipolar <b>disorder,</b> <b>and</b> the repetitive behaviors of AS have many similarities with the symptoms of obsessive–compulsive <b>disorder</b> <b>and</b> obsessive–compulsive personality disorder. However many of these studies are based on clinical samples or lack standardized measures; nonetheless, comorbid conditions are relatively common.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{physical}} and mental illnesses and the pharmaceutical substances used to treat them can increase risk of obesity. Medical illnesses that increase obesity risk include several rare genetic syndromes (listed above) {{as well as some}} congenital or acquired conditions: hypothyroidism, Cushing's syndrome, growth hormone deficiency, and the eating disorders: binge eating <b>disorder</b> <b>and</b> night eating syndrome. However, obesity is not regarded as a psychiatric <b>disorder,</b> <b>and</b> therefore is not listed in the DSM-IVR as a psychiatric illness. The risk of overweight and obesity is higher in patients with psychiatric disorders than in persons without psychiatric disorders.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} study attempt {{has been made to}} {{investigate}} the extent of alexithymia in patients with schizophrenia spectrum <b>disorders,</b> non-psychotic <b>disorders</b> <b>and</b> normal people.

In all groups, males had more problems in describing feelings and externally-oriented thinking.
