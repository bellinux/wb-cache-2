Class I major {{histocompatibility}} (MHC) antigens {{are expressed}} by virtually all mammalian cells, yet {{their levels of}} expression and behavior on the cell surface vary in a cell-specific fashion. A panel of lymphoid (both B and T) and nonlymphoid cell lines was used to study the kinetics of internalization of the H- 2 L <b>d</b> <b>class</b> I MHC in different cell types. These studies revealed that endocytosis of H- 2 L J occurs by both constitutive and PMA-regulated pathways in lymphoid cells, but only by a PMA-refractory pathway in the nonlymphoid cells tested.

40|$|Legacy soil maps {{typically}} {{consist of}} a tessellation of polygon soil map unit delineations where the map units {{consist of a}} defined assemblage of <b>soil</b> <b>classes</b> assumed to exist in more-or-less fixed proportions. There are several limitations {{in this kind of}} mapping approach that relate to the original intent of the soil survey, the effect of mapping scale, and the nature of soil polygon boundaries. Yet perhaps a more fundamental limitation is {{the fact that most of}} the time, the <b>soil</b> <b>classes</b> that comprise the soil map units are not mapped individually: in effect their spatial distributions are unknown beyond the qualitative indications given in the accompanying soil map unit report. Spatial disaggregation of soil map units attempts to map the spatial distribution of the individual <b>soil</b> <b>classes</b> that comprise a legacy soil map. We developed an approach called "Disaggregation and Harmonisation of Soil Map Units Through Resampled Classification Trees" (DSMART). DSMART samples the polygons of a legacy soil map and uses classification trees to generate a number of realisations of the potential <b>soil</b> <b>class</b> distribution. The realisations are then used to estimate the probability of occurrence of the individual <b>soil</b> <b>classes.</b> These estimates are mapped as raster grids, which can overcome some of the limitations of mapping scale and polygon boundaries inherent in the original legacy soil map. We demonstrate the DSMART approach on a legacy soil map from the former Dalrymple Shire in central Queensland, Australia. We mapped the estimated probability of occurrence of the 71 <b>soil</b> <b>classes</b> in the legacy soil map, as well as the most probable <b>soil</b> <b>class,</b> second-most-probable <b>soil</b> <b>class</b> and the degree of confusion between them as determined by a confusion index.

The surface and subsurface horizons of 44 profiles were sampled in different regions of the State and different cover crops to determine field capacity, permanent wilting point, available water content, particle size, and organic matter content.

It may be concluded that water retention is greater in silty or clayey soils and that the organic matter content is higher, especially in Humic Cambisols, Nitisols and Ferralsol developed from igneous or sedimentary rocks. Water availability is greater in loam-textured soils, with high organic matter content, especially in soils of humic character. It is lower in the sandy texture class, especially in Arenosols formed from recent alluvial deposits or in gravelly soils derived from granite. The greater water availability in the surface horizons, with more organic matter than in the subsurface layers, illustrates the importance of organic matter for water retention and availability...|$|R
