50|$|Also at Neubrücke, on a 44-hectare lot, the United States Army set up its 98th General Hospital in 1952. The {{emergency}} and reserve hospital had at its <b>disposal</b> 1,000 <b>beds</b> and various medical departments for, among others, surgery, dentistry, orthopaedics, radiology, rehabilitation and ophthalmology. A complete hospital train was kept {{standing by at}} all times. In 1994, the hospital was closed.|$|R
40|$|The Ashumet Valley area of Falmouth, Massachusetts {{has been}} one of the areas most {{affected}} by activities on the Massachusetts Military Reservation. As a result of many years wastewater disposal on the reservation, there is now a plume originating from the wastewater <b>disposal</b> <b>beds</b> (known as the sewage treatment plant, or STP plume) that contains high levels of dissolved solids, chloride, sodium, boron, detergents, and various forms of nitrogen and phosphorus. Currently, the STP Plume extends more than 17, 000 feet from the wastewater treatment plant. This study focuses on the health of Ashumet Pond in Falmouth and Mashpee, Massachusetts. As a result of the interception of phosphorus contaminated groundwater by Ashumet Pond, the pond has seen a large influx of phosphorous in recent years. Be-cause phosphorous is the limiting nutrient for biological production in the pond, any in-creased phosphorous loading in the pond could cause an increase of the productivity in the pond. If this productivity becomes too great, eutrophication can occur. Based on steady-state predictions such as the Vollenweider equation, Ashumet Pond is estimated t...|$|R

This side began play in the green and white still worn by VfL today; local youth trainer Bernd Elberskirch had ten green jerseys at his <b>disposal</b> and white <b>bed</b> sheets donated by the public were sewn together by local women to make shorts.|$|R
40|$|Sandia National Laboratories, has {{developed}} a methodology for performance assessment of deep geologic disposal of high-level nuclear waste. The applicability of this performance assessment methodology has been demonstrated for <b>disposal</b> in <b>bedded</b> salt and basalt; it has since been modified for assessment of repositories in unsaturated, fractured tuff. Changes to the methodology are primarily {{in the form of}} new or modified ground water flow and radionuclide transport codes. A new computer code, DCM 3 D, has been developed to model three-dimensional ground-water flow in unsaturated, fractured rock using a dual-continuum approach. The NEFTRAN 2 code has been developed to efficiently model radionuclide transport in time-dependent velocity fields, has the ability to use externally calculated pore velocities and saturations, and includes the effect of saturation dependent retardation factors. In order to use these codes together in performance-assessment-type analyses, code-coupler programs were developed to translate DCM 3 D output into NEFTRAN 2 input. Other portions of the performance assessment methodology were evaluated as part of modifying the methodology for tuff. The scenario methodology developed under the bedded salt program has been applied to tuff. An investigation of the applicability of uncertainty and sensitivity analysis techniques to non-linear models indicate that Monte Carlo simulation remains the most robust technique for these analyses. No changes have been recommended for the dose and health effects models, nor the biosphere transport models. 52 refs., 1 fig...|$|R
40|$|Monitoring of {{geologic}} sequestration {{projects will}} require the measurement of many different parameters and processes at many different locations at the surface and in the subsurface. The greatest need for technology development is for monitoring of processes in the subsurface in the region between wells. The approach to fitting this need is to build upon decades of experience in use of geophysics in {{the oil and gas}} industry. These methods can be optimized for CO 2 monitoring, and customized and extended {{in order to meet the}} need for cost-effective methods applicable to saline <b>disposal</b> sites, coal <b>bed</b> methane sites, as well as oil and gas reservoir sequestration sites. The strategy for development of cost-effective methods follows a three step iterative process of sensitivity analysis using numerical and experimental techniques, field testing at a range of scale in different formations, and analysis and integration of complimentary types of data...|$|R
40|$|Both {{utilization}} and <b>disposal</b> of fluidized <b>bed</b> combustion (FBC) waste {{are complicated}} by its chemical and mineralogical composition. It has a quite high content of CaO and CaSO 4 responsible for exothermal and expansive phenomena upon hydration; furthermore, {{due to the}} low combustion temperature, it contains a coal ash having {{a limited amount of}} glass phase and therefore a poor pozzolanic activity. In this paper it is assessed the suitability of FBC waste as raw feed component for the manufacture of calcium sulfoaluminate cements which can be utilized {{for a wide range of}} applications. Mixtures containing FBC wastes derived from both laboratory and industrial plants were synthesized into an electric oven in the temperature range 1000 °- 1300 °C. Depending on the proportioning of the constituents of the raw feed as well as on the synthesis conditions, burning products having as main components the desired hydraulic phases were obtained...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Musculoskeletal {{disorders}} (MSDs) are {{a common}} reason for health problems and sick leave in many professions. A work arena where MSDs have not been sufficiently studied is stable work. Here many heavy and repetitive work tasks are performed manually with old-fashioned working tools. OBJECTIVE: The {{aim of this study}} was to use an analytical approach to identify, evaluate and grade ergonomic problems in physical work performed during daily activities in horse stables and relate these to MSDs among the workers and to the design of the tools. METHODS: Three common work tasks were studied to identify, evaluate and grade ergonomic problems; mucking out, sweeping and bedding replacement. Used methods were Hierarchical Task Analysis, Heuristic Evaluation and Rapid Entire Body Assessment. RESULTS: Several high-risk operations were found in mucking out boxes and <b>disposal</b> of <b>bedding</b> material. The problems consisted of awkward working postures such as a twisted and bent back, arms in an elevated position, wrists in extreme joint positions and handling of heavy loads. CONCLUSIONS: By using an analytical approach it is possible to identify presumptive ergonomic problems without extensive empirical research. In most high-risk operations, long-shafted tools or a wheelbarrow were used, which emphasize a need to develop tools with better ergonomic design to improve the working situation. The limitation is that the ergonomics problems found are not finally validated. The results show where deeper empirical research is needed, both regarding how MSDs occur and how tools and environment contribute to physical problems...|$|R
60|$|Our way {{lay over}} an almost level plain {{for about a}} mile. A portion of it was {{somewhat}} rough, so that {{when we reached the}} low house to which we were bound, we were all very glad indeed to get there. The house belonged to the two men, who owned a small ranch here. One of them was married, and his wife immediately set herself to work to attend to our needs. Her home was small, its rooms few, and her larder very plain in quality; but everything she had was placed at our <b>disposal.</b> Her own <b>bed</b> was given to the elder Dusante lady, who took immediate possession of it; and after a quickly prepared but plentiful meal of fried pork, corn-bread, and coffee, the rest of us stretched ourselves out to rest wherever we could find a place. Before lying down, however, I had, at Ruth's earnest solicitation, engaged one of the men to ride to the railroad-station to inquire about Mr. Enderton, and to inform him of our safety. By taking a route which ran parallel with the mountain-chain, but at some distance from it, the station, the man said, could be reached without encountering snow.|$|R
30|$|During the study, it was {{observed}} that the water quality of River Ganga was good at most of the locations in Rishikesh town. The upper segment of Ganga had good quality of water to be used for drinking with minimal treatment but after disinfection. Even the concentration of heavy metals was either non-detectable or within the safe limits. The middle and lower segments had higher levels of pollutants, especially the TDS, organic matter, and MPN. Such areas may be dedicated for organized outdoor bathing for tourists and pilgrims. Night soil <b>disposal</b> in river <b>bed</b> and wastewater discharge through open channels need immediate attention to control MPN and organic load. MPN was found to be a critical parameter which needs regular monitoring and measures to control. Addition of phosphate from wastewater channels is of concern since it may lead to eutrophication particularly in {{the time of year when}} the flow is lean. The channels may be intercepted and diverted to sewage treatment plants. The water {{was observed}} to be of good to excellent quality throughout with respect to its use in irrigation for a long period of time. In industrial application, the water will not result in scale formation but may result in corrosion of pipes used for transporting the water. Such water may be used in different industrial processes with minimal pretreatment.|$|R
40|$|Recenty, {{polyethylene}} pots(PP) {{present a}} significant environmental issue for waste <b>disposal.</b> To develop <b>bedding</b> plant production system without PP, properties of compacted medium hardened by heat fusion polyester fiber were investigated. Effects of irrigation methods {{on the growth}} of vegetative propagated petunia grown in medium without PP were investigated. The effect of medium type was not as significant as the difference in water loss per pot. Water loss per pot of medium without PP was about two times greater than medium held in PP. No compacted medium disintegrated easily without root-ball formation, and in 20 days after cutting about half of non-compacted medium had disintegrated. Compacted medium did not disintegrate before rooting. Medium type did not significantly affect rooting rates, plant heights, leaf numbers and fresh weights when transplanted to medium. Also, cell or pot medium type did not significantly affect plant heights, flower numbers, leaf numbers and fresh weights. Non-compacted medium without PP easily disintegrated with overhead irrigation. Subirrigation and much overhead irrigation had similar effect on growth when planted in containers. However, less overhead irrigation had significantly lower growth. Moreover, in less overhead irrigation, non-compacted medium without PP had remarkably lower growth than compacted medium without PP. In, conclusions, compacted medium without PP {{did not affect the}} growth of bedding plants whenever water and nutrient regime was well regulated. Compacted pot medium was easy to transplant since it did not disintegrate. Therefore, it was considered practical and feasible to use compacted medium without PP for bedding plant production...|$|R
40|$|In this PhD (doctoral) {{thesis is}} made models of rocky massif in real {{condition}} which defines {{the conditions for}} their application and assessment {{of the degree of}} stability. Based on modern methods of research and analysis for calculating the degree of stability, there is done a research models that would be useful for the calculation of stability. The research was conducted at three locations in eastern Macedonia, village Shashavarlija, children resort - Plackovica and one part of the Skopje valley. The observations were performed with an interval of two years and is conducted a method of geoelelectrical sounding. Measurements are performed multiple times on the same section, in order to define the sliding plane, depending on the weather. From the data obtained from geoelectric sounding it can be concluded that the specific electrical resistance of rock masses is fall at a time of increased precipitation of rainfall, especially in dry periods of the year occur relatively high values of the specific resistance, especially in the surface layer. This appearance is normal to expect. The analysis of the specific electrical resistance in the researched section clearly indicates that the sliding plane of the rock masses is characterized by reduced specific resistance in relation to the surrounding rock mass, especially in extremely wet condition. In these conditions, it comes to the intense activation of the process of sliding rock masses. The results are consistent with the basic theoretical assumptions, ie the zone with increased amounts of water has a lower value of the intensity of the specific electrical resistance, although it is the same type of geological environment. The results of these studies indicate that the geoelectric methods can provide useful information in researching the sliding plane of rock mass. This models can be applied in surface mines, in preparation of slopes of working trenches and cuts, in the construction of roads, in determining the stability of the slope of the natural slopes, slopes of river <b>beds,</b> <b>disposal,</b> landfill and other geotechnical structures. Key words: rock massive, sliding plane, specific resistance, geoelectric, stability, deformations, methods for determining stability, factor of stability, landslides...|$|R
