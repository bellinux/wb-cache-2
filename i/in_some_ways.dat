5|$|Thomas Aquinas {{argued that}} {{statements}} about God are analogous to human experience. An analogous term is partly univocal (has only one meaning) and partly equivocal (has {{more than one}} potential meaning) because an analogy is <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>ways</b> the same and <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>ways</b> different from the subject. He proposed that those godly qualities which resemble human qualities are described analogously, with reference to human terms; for example, when God is described as good, {{it does not mean}} that God is good in human terms, but that human goodness is used as a reference to describe God's goodness.|$|E

5|$|At first Catherine {{kept the}} nine-year-old king, who cried at his coronation, close to her, and slept in his chamber. She presided over his council, decided policy, and {{controlled}} state business and patronage. However, {{she was never}} {{in a position to}} control the country as a whole, which was on the brink of civil war. In many parts of France the rule of nobles held sway rather than that of the crown. The challenges Catherine faced were complex and <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>ways</b> difficult for her to comprehend as a foreigner.|$|E

5|$|Between 1893 and 1904, Italy {{laid down}} eight battleships; the later {{two classes of}} ship were remarkably fast, though the Regina Margherita class was poorly {{protected}} and the Regina Elena class lightly armed. <b>In</b> <b>some</b> <b>ways,</b> these ships presaged {{the concept of the}} battlecruiser. The Austro-Hungarian Empire also saw a naval renaissance during the 1890s, though of the nine pre-dreadnought battleships ordered only the three of the Habsburg class arrived before Dreadnought herself made them obsolete.|$|E
5|$|Epiacum is <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>ways</b> {{a typical}} Roman fort: inside the wall are {{straight}} roads which cross, a headquarters building (the Praetorium), the commandant's house, {{a set of}} barrack blocks for the cohort of auxiliary soldiers, and granaries to store food. Also as usual, there is a bath house and a temple (dedicated by the auxiliaries to the Emperor Caracalla) outside the wall. There is an altar to Mithras and another, as already mentioned, to Hercules.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>some</b> <b>ways</b> {{the run-up}} to Plataea resembled that at the Battle of Marathon; there was a {{prolonged}} stalemate in which neither side risked attacking the other. The reasons for this stalemate were primarily tactical, and similar to the situation at Marathon; the Greek hoplites {{did not want to}} risk being outflanked by the Persian cavalry and the lightly armed Persian infantry could not hope to assault well-defended positions.|$|E

5|$|More loosely, Syntax by Hans Eduard Meier {{is similar}} <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>ways.</b> Released in 1968 and praised by Tschichold, it was {{intended}} to be a more dynamic, handwriting-influenced sans-serif form. Its italic is, however, more of an oblique than Gill's. Hypatia Sans, designed by Thomas Phinney and released by Adobe, was intended to be a more characterful humanist sans design. Many other fonts are influenced by Gill Sans to some extent.|$|E
5|$|Nahuatl {{does not}} have {{grammatical}} case but uses what is sometimes called a relational noun to describe spatial (and other) relations. These morphemes cannot appear alone but must occur after a noun or a possessive prefix. They are also often called postpositions or locative suffixes. <b>In</b> <b>some</b> <b>ways</b> these locative constructions resemble and {{can be thought of}} as locative case constructions. Most modern dialects have incorporated prepositions from Spanish that are competing with or that have completely replaced relational nouns.|$|E
5|$|Regardless of {{the type}} of {{metabolic}} process they employ, the majority of bacteria are able to take in raw materials only in the form of relatively small molecules, which enter the cell by diffusion or through molecular channels in cell membranes. The Planctomycetes are the exception (as they are in possessing membranes around their nuclear material). It has recently been shown that Gemmata obscuriglobus is able to take in large molecules via a process that <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>ways</b> resembles endocytosis, the process used by eukaryotic cells to engulf external items.|$|E

5|$|The {{chemical}} {{behavior of}} ytterbium {{is similar to}} that of the rest of the lanthanides. Most ytterbium compounds are found in the +3 oxidation state, and its salts in this oxidation state are nearly colorless. Like europium, samarium, and thulium, the trihalides of ytterbium can be reduced to the dihalides by hydrogen, zinc dust, or by the addition of metallic ytterbium. The +2 oxidation state occurs only in solid compounds and reacts <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>ways</b> similarly to the alkaline earth metal compounds; for example, ytterbium(II) oxide (YbO) shows the same structure as calcium oxide (CaO).|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} and {{an adaptation of}} Washington Irving's story of Rip Van Winkle. The stage adaptation was well-known and the adaptation would be compared to Joseph Jefferson's portrayal on the stage. The writer of the scenario is unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. The adaptation differs from the original <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>ways,</b> including that Winkle's cantankerous wife has remarried instead of died.|$|E

5|$|There {{has been}} some {{evidence}} that prior to this charter, the royal heralds had already <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>ways</b> behaved like a corporation as early as 1420. Nevertheless, the charter is the earliest surviving document to affirm the chapter as a corporate body of heralds. The charter outlines {{the constitution of the}} officers, their hierarchy, the privileges conferred upon them and their jurisdiction over all heraldic matters in the Kingdom of England.|$|E
5|$|Three of Europe's major {{languages}} are official in Switzerland. Swiss culture is characterised by diversity, which {{is reflected in}} a wide range of traditional customs. A region may be <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>ways</b> strongly culturally connected to the neighbouring country that shares its language, the country itself being rooted in western European culture. The linguistically isolated Romansh culture in Graubünden in eastern Switzerland constitutes an exception, it survives only in the upper valleys of the Rhine and the Inn and strives to maintain its rare linguistic tradition.|$|E
5|$|After {{these talks}} with Rudd, Lobengula called an indaba (conference) of over 100 izinDuna {{to present the}} {{proposed}} concession terms to them and gauge their sympathies. It {{soon became clear that}} opinion was split: most of the younger izinDuna were opposed to the idea of any concession whatsoever, while the king himself and many of his older izinDuna were open to considering Rudd's bid. The idea of a mining monopoly in the hands of Rudd's powerful backers was attractive to the Matabele <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>ways,</b> as it would end the incessant propositioning for concessions by small-time prospectors, {{but there was also a}} case for allowing competition to continue, so that the rival miners would have to compete for Lobengula's favour.|$|E

5|$|Bahá'í teachings are <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>ways</b> {{similar to}} other monotheistic faiths: God is {{considered}} single and all-powerful. However, Bahá'u'lláh taught that religion is orderly and progressively revealed by one God through Manifestations of God who are the founders of major world religions throughout history; Buddha, Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad being the most recent in the period before the Báb and Bahá'u'lláh. As such, Bahá'ís regard the major religions as fundamentally unified in purpose, though varied in social practices and interpretations. There is a similar emphasis on the unity of all people, openly rejecting notions of racism and nationalism. At the heart of Bahá'í teachings {{is the goal of}} a unified world order that ensures the prosperity of all nations, races, creeds, and classes.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, {{his team}} at NIMH {{admitted}} {{a patient with}} depression who had observed seasonal changes within himself and thought previous research regarding melatonin release at night {{may be able to}} help him. Rosenthal and his colleagues treated the patient with bright lights, which helped to successfully manage the depression. They conducted a formal follow-up study to confirm the success. The results were published in 1984, officially describing SAD and pioneering light therapy as an effective treatment method. The research on SAD and light therapy is inconclusive and <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>ways</b> controversial, as not all researchers agree with Rosenthal's conclusions on the effect of light therapy and at what time of day the light should be administered.|$|E
5|$|Le Père Goriot is also {{recognized}} as a bildungsroman, wherein a naive young person matures while learning {{the ways of the}} world. Rastignac is tutored by Vautrin, Madame de Beauséant, Goriot, and others about the truth of Parisian society and the coldly dispassionate and brutally realistic strategies required for social success. As an everyman, he is initially repulsed by the gruesome realities beneath society's gilded surfaces; eventually, however, he embraces them. Setting aside his original goal of mastering the law, he pursues money and women as instruments for social climbing. <b>In</b> <b>some</b> <b>ways</b> this mirrors Balzac's own social education, reflecting the distaste he acquired for the law after studying it for three years.|$|E
