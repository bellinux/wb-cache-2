5|$|On October18, a {{short-lived}} tropical cyclone existed {{east of the}} Ryukyu Islands. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>moving</b> northeastward and was last noted on the next day. A tropical storm was first observed on October21 and moved westward through the Philippines over the succeeding days. It crossed the South China Sea and dissipated over east-central Vietnam on October26. Concurrently, a tropical cyclone was noted on October24 northeast of the Philippines. It curved northwestward and later turned to the northeast, and was last noted on October29 east of Okinawa.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave emerged off {{the western}} coast of Africa on June 12, and eventually developed into Tropical Depression One {{in the southeastern}} Gulf of Mexico. Operationally, the National Hurricane Center designated this system as Tropical Depression Two, which led to confusion because of Subtropical Storm One in April, and then another Tropical Depression Two in July. Outflow from Hurricane Celia in the Pacific Ocean and a trough in the Gulf of Mexico generated wind shear on the depression, which prevented it from intensifying into a tropical storm. The depression curved north-northeastward and eventually made landfall in near Tampa, Florida on June 26 around 1500UTC. As <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>moving</b> ashore, the National Hurricane Center noted that the depression was too poorly organized to locate the center of circulation, and discontinued advisories on the system.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Keli {{struck the}} islands of Tuvalu on June 12 and 13, with {{extensive}} damage reported throughout the Islands with trees uprooted by wind and waves. On Nivalakita, all buildings except for the church were flattened; an estimated cost to rebuild all of the houses as they were before the cyclone hit was estimated at A$ (US$), while {{it was estimated that}} the cost of rebuilding the houses with an improved, cyclone-resistant design would be about A$ (US$). The whole of Tepuka Savilivili was left uninhabitable, as coconut trees and other vegetation were swept away with no more than an area of jagged coral left behind. In Fiji, strong winds and rough seas were reported from the cyclone as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>moving</b> to the north of Fiji, and while the cyclone was weakening it dropped 3.76inches (95.5mm) of rain on American Samoa.|$|E
40|$|Although special {{relativity}} limits the actual velocity of a particle to $c$, {{the velocity of}} light, the observed velocity need {{not be the same}} as the actual velocity as the observer is only aware of the position of a particle at the time in the past when it emits the detected signal. We consider the apparent speed and acceleration of a particle in two cases, one when the particle <b>is</b> <b>moving</b> with a constant speed and the other when <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>moving</b> with a constant acceleration. One curious feature of our results is that in both cases, if the actual velocity of the particle approaches $c$, then the apparent velocity approaches infinity when <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>moving</b> toward the observer and $c/ 2 $ when <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>moving</b> away from the observer.

5|$|Routine {{observations}} {{were taken by}} the team on October 21, 2003, using the 1.2m Samuel Oschin Schmidt telescope at Palomar Observatory, California, but the image of Eris was not discovered at that point due to its very slow motion across the sky: The team's automatic image-searching software excluded all objects moving at less than 1.5arcseconds per hour {{to reduce the number}} of false positives returned. When Sedna was discovered, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>moving</b> at 1.75arcsec/h, and in light of that the team reanalyzed their old data with a lower limit on the angular motion, sorting through the previously excluded images by eye. In January 2005, the re-analysis revealed Eris's slow motion against the background stars.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{originally}} {{going to be}} made in 1975 as part of a series of four films, but shooting was abandoned after two days, only to be revisited by Rivette 27 years later. It premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2003 and had a cinema release in France, Belgium and the UK. It was shown in competition at the San Sebastian International Film Festival and was nominated for the Prix Louis-Delluc. Some critics found the film tedious, long, and pretentious, while others maintained that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>moving,</b> intelligent, and among Rivette's best work. The film was frequently compared to other supernatural thrillers, among them Vertigo (1958), The Sixth Sense (1999), and The Others (2001).|$|E
5|$|The {{system that}} would {{eventually}} develop into a tropical storm was first noted by a ship north-northwest of Veracruz on September 23. It was recognized as a tropical storm on September 27 while was located above the Bay of Campeche, and moved northeastward, and slowly accelerated as it intensified. By September 28, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>moving</b> east-northeastward at 24 mph (38 km/h), and simultaneously attained its peak intensity of 50 mph (85 km/h). At this point, it remained just offshore the Florida panhandle, and moved inland shortly thereafter on September 29. It plowed through northern Florida and southeastern Georgia while maintaining its intensity and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone {{off the coast of}} North Carolina on September 29. The remnants of the storm merged with a cold front the following day while situated south of New York.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{was first}} observed near Cape Verde on September16. On September21, the Hurricane Hunters observed a circulation, which indicated a tropical depression had formed {{east of the}} northern Leeward Islands. It moved to the west-northwest, becoming Tropical Storm Helene on September23. The next day Helene became a hurricane, aided by an anticyclone aloft. It moved around a large ridge, bringing its center toward the southeastern United States. As the hurricane approached the Carolinas, the hurricane rapidly intensified as the eye became visible on radar, and Helene reached peak winds of 150mph (240km/h) {{on the morning of}} September27. An approaching trough turned the hurricane to the northeast, and Helene came within 10mi (15km) of the coast of North Carolina. It slowly weakened, {{and at the same time}} its size expanded. On September29, Helene became extratropical as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>moving</b> over Newfoundland. The remnants continued to the northeast, later turning to the southeast and dissipating on October4 just west of Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|On July1, the JTWC {{downgraded}} Tingting to {{a tropical}} storm. At 1200UTC the following day, the JMA downgraded the storm to a severe tropical storm as winds decreased below 120km/h (75mph 10-minute winds). Convection {{associated with the}} storm began to diminish as Tingting began to undergo an extratropical transition. Although the storm maintained its intensity as a severe tropical storm, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>moving</b> into increasingly unfavorable conditions and weakening was anticipated. As Tingting tracked towards the northeast into the mid-latitude westerlies, it completed its extratropical transition on July4. After becoming an extratropical cyclone, Tingting accelerated towards the north before abruptly stalling near the Kamchatka Peninsula. On July6, the extratropical remnants of Tingting were absorbed by a developing {{area of low pressure}} located to the south of the former typhoon. However, the JMA continued to monitor Tingting as a separate system as it executed a counter-clockwise loop though July10 before heading towards the international date line. The storm was last reported on July13 to the west Aleutian Islands.|$|E
5|$|On September 16, 2007, due {{in large}} part to the {{participation}} of PlayStation 3 consoles, the Folding@home project officially attained a sustained performance level higher than one native petaFLOPS, becoming the first computing system of any kind to do so. Top500's fastest supercomputer at the time was BlueGene/L, at 0.280 petaFLOPS. The following year, on May 7, 2008, the project attained a sustained performance level higher than two native petaFLOPS, followed by the three and four native petaFLOPS milestones on August 20 and September 28, 2008 respectively. On February 18, 2009, Folding@home achieved five native petaFLOPS, and was the first computing project to meet these five levels. In comparison, November 2008's fastest supercomputer was IBM's Roadrunner at 1.105 petaFLOPS. On November 10, 2011, Folding@home's performance exceeded six native petaFLOPS with the equivalent of nearly eight x86 petaFLOPS. In mid-May 2013, Folding@home attained over seven native petaFLOPS, with the equivalent of 14.87 x86 petaFLOPS. It then reached eight native petaFLOPS on June 21, followed by nine on September 9 of that year, with 17.9 x86 petaFLOPS. On May 11, 2016 Folding@home announced that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>moving</b> towards reaching the 100 x86 petaFLOPS mark.|$|E

5|$|While <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>moving</b> {{little over}} the south-central Caribbean, Omar brought {{prolonged}} tropical storm conditions to the ABC Islands. Sustained winds to near gale force battered the islands, although peak gusts to 58mph (92km/h) {{were confined to}} Bonaire. In 24 hours, a maximum precipitation total of 4.0 in (102mm) was recorded on Aruba, while 1.7 in (43mm) and 1.5 in (41mm) of rain fell in Curaçao and Bonaire, respectively. The high winds damaged roofs on all three islands, and rough seas caused beach erosion and significant damage to coastal facilities. Some rain damage also occurred, with significant flooding reported {{in some parts of}} Aruba. In the SSS Islands (Saba, St. Eustatius, and Sint Maarten) strong winds from Omar, gusting up to 76mph (122km/h), and high waves caused significant damage and coastal flooding. On Sint Maarten, rainfall from the storm totaled to 5.4in (139.4mm). Damage in Sint Maarten was mainly limited to beach erosion and scattered power outages.|$|E
