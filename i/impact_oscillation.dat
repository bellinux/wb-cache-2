40|$|Abstract In this paper, a new S-shaped {{piezoelectric}} PZT cantilever is microfabricated for scavenging {{vibration energy}} at low frequencies (0 Hz) and low accelerations (. 4 g). The maximum voltage and normalized power are 42 mV and 0. 31 lW g- 2, respectively, at input accelera-tion of 0. 06 g. For acceleration above 0. 06 g, the vibration of PZT cantilever changes from a linear oscillation to a nonlinear <b>impact</b> <b>oscillation</b> {{due to the}} displacement con-straint introduced by a mechanical stopper. Based on the-oretical modeling and experimental results, the frequency broadening effect of the PZT cantilever is studied with varying stop distances and input accelerations. The oper-ation bandwidth of the piezoelectric PZT cantilever is able to extend from 3. 4 to 11. 1 Hz as the stop distance reduces from 1. 7 to 0. 7 mm for an acceleration of 0. 3 g, {{at the expense of}} the voltage and normalized power at resonance decreasing from 40 to 16 mV and from 17. 8 to 2. 8 nW g- 2, respectively. ...|$|E

40|$|An impact {{oscillator}} is a periodically driven {{system that}} hits a wall when its amplitude exceeds a critical value. We study <b>impact</b> <b>oscillations</b> where collisions with the wall are with near-zero velocity (grazing impacts). A characteristic feature of grazing impact dynamics is a geometrically converging series of transitions from a nonimpacting period- 1 orbit to period-M orbits that impact once per period with M= 1. 2, [...] In an experiment we explore the dynamics {{in the vicinity}} of these period-adding transitions. The experiment is a mechanical impact oscillator with a precisely controlled driving strength. Although the excitation of many high-order harmonics in the experiment appeared unavoidable, we characterize it with only three parameters. Despite the simplicity of this description, good agreement with numerical simulations of an impacting harmonic oscillator was found. Grazing impact dynamics can be described by mappings that have a square-root singularity. We evaluate several mappings, both for instantaneous impacts and for impacts that involve soft collisions with a yielding wall. As the square-root singularity appears persistent in the reduction of the dynamics to mappings, and because impact dynamics appears insensitive to experimental nonidealities, the characteristic bifurcation scenario should be observed in a wide class of experimental system...|$|R

The scale of the effect these oscillations have on Doppler velocity measurements is smaller than that produced by stellar activity, but is most significant for giant and subgiant stars, and at short integration times (i. e. less than a few minutes). Such short observation times tend to be used only for very bright stars. However, since it is these very same stars that tend to be targeted for the highest precision observations, as planet searches probe to lower and lower planet masses, oscillation noise for these stars can be significant and needs to be accounted for in observing strategies.

40|$|The {{vibratory}} {{dynamics of}} the grinding process performed by a robot arm is studied in this thesis. The robotic grinding process under development at Hydro-Québec’s research institute (IREQ) for maintenance operations on hydropower equipment is a high material removal rate task used for profiling large parts and complex geometries. The profiling application is unlike conventional grinding in which, {{a thin layer of}} material is removed as a finishing procedure. One major hurdle for this technology is the significant vibrations inherent to the process. However, the maneuverability that the robot brings into the operations makes it, sometimes, the only practical solution for machining in hard-to-reach areas. The main features of the robotic tool holder which affect its vibratory dynamics, i. e. the robot’s high compliance and its configuration-dependent dynamics are studied. The objective is to investigate vibrations and instability based upon appropriate understandings of the instantaneous {{dynamics of the}} material removal process performed by the articulated multi-body robot arm. Since vibrational instability in material removal is caused by the interactions between the dynamics of the cutting process and the tool holder’s structural dynamics, two lines of research are conducted accordingly. An experimental investigation substantiated by numerical simulations is carried out on the steady vibratory dynamics of the process. Due to the compliance of the robot arm, material removal is found governed by vibro-impacts, occurring mainly at the spindle’s rotational frequency, between the cutter and the workpiece. The “impact-cutting” behavior is characterized through angular analysis of the cyclic <b>impacting</b> <b>oscillations.</b> The measured instantaneous rotational frequency of the spindle during robotic grinding is mapped into a representation suited for monitoring the dynamic evolutions in the impacting regime. The “impact-cutting map” was also used to validate a plausible hypothesis for uniform disk wear when exhibiting an impact-cutting operation. The measured drop in the instantaneous angular speed, as a transient which is excited impulsively by the cutting impacts, was found well correlated to grinding power. The practical significance of this latter result is considered as to integrate the real-time measurement of the speed drop and the number of impacts per spindle revolutions into the robot control strategy in order to improve the metal removal estimation. In a following step, an impact-cutting model for metal removal was used to estimate the grinding power required for a grinding task performed by the robot. Constant coefficients of the model were first identified experimentally. Robotic grinding tests were performed while setting the target grinding power in the control strategy based upon the impact-cutting model. It was demonstrated that a uniform cut with a target rate of metal removal and a target cutting depth can be achieved in presence of stabilized <b>impacting</b> <b>oscillations.</b> The waviness amplitude on the finished surface is found to be much smaller than the amplitude of vibro <b>impact</b> <b>oscillations.</b> The knowledge about vibro-impact oscillations present in the process helps improving the strategy of controlled material removal rate employed in the robot control strategy. The iterative procedure of grinding/profile scanning to reach the desired tolerance level on the surface can be improved based upon the estimation of the material removal rate by the impact-cutting model. The limit of stable impact cutting due to regenerative chatter was investigated next. The investigation resulted into understanding that the high compliance of the robot arm locates the problem of robotic grinding regenerative chatter on the far upper right of the first lobe on the stability chart. In this region, the limit of stable operation is defined by very large gain values. This is different from traditional machining which is located inside the “lobes zone” on the stability lobes diagram. The cyclic impacting dynamics of material removal is invoked to investigate instability in this region. The limit of stable operation is identified from numerical simulations of impact-cutting. The boundary is found to be very close to the margin predicted using the traditional approach for regenerative chatter analysis. It is concluded that the large gain is typical for robotic grinding. The impacting dynamics of material removal due to robot compliance must be considered to understand such large gain values, never occurring in conventional grinding. Experiments are performed to substantiate the new understanding regarding the problem of regenerative chatter in robotic grinding. A second line of research was focused on the robotic tool holder’s structural dynamics. The goal was to provide a modeling tool for an investigation of the effect of robot’s configuration-dependent dynamics on vibrations and instability in the process. A 6 -DOF multi-body dynamic model was developed for the robot manipulator. Experimental modal analysis on the robot structure was used to validate the mode shapes and natural frequencies predicted by the model. A discussion is provided about how the developed modeling tool can serve an investigation of mode-coupling chatter in robotic machining. The study of vibrations and instability in this thesis contribute into understanding the vibratory dynamics that govern the robotic grinding process. Further development of the robotized technology for precision profiling of industrial parts relies on such understanding bases...|$|R

40|$|This study {{deals with}} impact {{interaction}} of ships with one-sided ice barrier during roll dynamics. An analytical model of ship roll motion interacting with ice is developed based on Zhuravlev and Ivanov non-smooth coordinate transformations. These transformations {{have the advantage}} of converting the vibro-impact oscillator into an oscillator without barriers such that the corresponding equation of motion does not contain any impact term. Such approaches, however, account for the energy loss at impact times in different ways. The present work, in particular, brings to the attention the fact that the impact dynamics may have qualitatively different response characteristics to different dissipation models. The difference between localized and distributed equivalent damping approaches is discussed. Extensive numerical simulations are carried out for all initial conditions covered by the ship grazing orbit for different values of excitation amplitude and frequency of external wave roll moment. The basins of attraction of safe operation are obtained and reveal the coexistence of different response regimes such as nonimpact periodic <b>oscillations,</b> modulation <b>impact</b> motion, period added <b>impact</b> <b>oscillations,</b> chaotic <b>impact</b> motion and rollover dynamics.

However, deviation becomes significant as the angle increases. This deviation is mainly attributed to the uncertainty of the coefficient of restitution, which is found to depend on the velocity of impact in addition to the geometry and material properties of the model and barrier...|$|R

30|$|To {{estimate}} the modal properties of a system, mode-meter algorithms are constantly processing PMU data and estimating frequency, damping ratio {{and shape of}} a mode from ambient data. Forced oscillations impose a challenge on mode estimation algorithms [5, 47]. To {{estimate the}} mode accurately, {{it is important to}} study the <b>impact</b> of forced <b>oscillations</b> on mode estimation. Studying both simulation data and real-time PMU data, authors in [48], pointed out that damping estimate can be comprised when forced oscillations exist. Vanfretti et al. showed that the <b>impact</b> of forced <b>oscillation</b> on damping estimate depends on its location with respect to an inter-area mode [49]. It has been shown that estimated damping ratio decreases when a forced oscillation is superimposed on the inter-area mode. However, estimated damping ratios increase when forced oscillations are close to the inter-area mode. Myers et al. showed that existence of forced oscillations can have a slight impact on mode-shape estimation only when forced oscillation frequency is close to system mode frequency [9]. Forced oscillations with frequencies far away from system mode frequencies have no noticeable impact on mode-shape estimation. In addition, Sidorov discusses the online detection of inter-area oscillations in the power systems in [52].|$|R
