During Ulf's period {{as a guest}} judge on Idol 2009, he and Jonas first met Clara Hagman, who was later recruited {{as a member of}} the new Ace of Base line-up. Jenny stated that the new line-up would not be called Ace of Base, while Jonas remarked that they would [...] "reform how they write the band name".

When this {{came to the}} fans' attention, Jonas and Jenny independently stated that this new group would not be called Ace of Base, but would use another name. This alternative line-up later presented a slightly changed name: [...] "Ace.of.Base", but this was mainly a <b>graphical</b> <b>adjustment</b> used {{on the cover of}} their releases only. In an interview for Swedish TV Ulf stated: [...] "We're still called Ace of Base. The dots are more for styling and the logo." [...] Jenny has stated several times that she has never left the band and on the contrary declared that all four original members are still band members and own the brand Ace of Base, by agreement with her brother Jonas and by legal documents.|$|E

Leading up {{to the release of}} Hotline Miami, Devolver Digital opened a phone line in Miami, Florida to enable people to call and leave voice {{messages}} of their own. Some time after the official release of the game in late October 2012, a trailer was created using these recordings.

5|$|Due {{to earlier}} {{recurring}} issues with mistranslations related to news updates, the team {{decided not to}} implement forums in the original release, instead hearing player feedback through fan sites and unofficial forums. Also because of mistranslation fears, dedicated teams {{in each of the}} game's release regions would gather feedback and transmit it to the development team. The game's first closed Alpha test began on March 11, 2010. It was available only to veteran players from XI. During alpha testing, the team used player feedback to find out key problems with the game, such as limitations on <b>graphical</b> <b>adjustments</b> making the game run at a slow frame rate. The open Beta test was originally scheduled to begin on August 31, but was indefinitely postponed due to the discovery of critical bugs in the game. The Beta test eventually went live on September 2, running until the game's release later that month. It was later stated that more time should have been given to fixing bugs during the Beta period. The game released on September 30, 2010, six months prior to the PS3 version's projected release date of March 2011. A Collector's Edition was released on September 22, allowing owners to log into the game from that date. The Collector's Edition, which was decorated by artwork from Amano and Yoshida, came with bonus items including a DVD featuring a behind-the-scenes documentary, a security token, a case for the game's box, and a decorated tumbler. The game was released with text in Japanese, English, French and German, while the spoken dialogue in cutscenes was English in all versions.|$|R
500|$|Rebirth {{was officially}} {{announced}} in April 2004, {{a week after}} the game's title and existence had been leaked to the public early after a story from Jump magazine was made available a week early due to being mistakenly being shipped early. In July, Namco announced that people who pre-ordered Tales of Symphonia for the PlayStation 2 would receive a bonus disc featuring footage from an early build of Tales of Rebirth, upon purchasing Symphonia in September. [...] The same footage, along with a playable build of the game was present at the Tokyo Game Show in the same month. The game was released on the PlayStation 2 on December 16, 2004. In July 2004, IGN reported that Tales of Rebirth was a likely candidate for an English localization in North America due to the high reception and sales of Tales of Symphonia in North America for the Nintendo GameCube. The PlayStation Portable port of the game, which featured <b>graphical</b> <b>adjustments</b> for the platform's widescreen, was announced in July 2007. The port was made following the port of Destiny 2. As with those games, transplanting the 2D graphics onto the PSP and maintaining the experience of the original caused some difficulties. Conversely, they found the memory capacity of the PSP compared to the PS2 a good thing. Yoshizumi felt that {{the fact that it was}} a port rather than a remake divided the development team. The port also included extra minor story scenes and a viewing gallery for concept art. Neither the original nor the port of Rebirth have received an English localization, making it one of three mainline Tales titles not have come to the west.|$|R
