500|$|The Leigth <b>Feight</b> {{took place}} on 14 August 1839. The chartists had called for a strike {{at a time when}} there was social unrest over the high levels of {{unemployment}} and [...] high cost of living. A mob of at least 2,000 gathered in Leigh. About 400–500 workers from Chowbent threatened to burn down Hayes Mill. A detachment of troops from Haydock was called out and special constables sworn in by the local magistrate. The Riot Act was read by Squire Thomas Withington of Culcheth Hall and for a while the mob dispersed but reassembled later. Many were injured in the fighting that took place and arrests were made. Those arrested were severely punished, while others ensured that radicalism continued in Leigh, leading eventually to electoral reform and universal suffrage.|$|E
6000|$|The old man drew {{himself up}} to the full {{advantage}} of his uncommon height, and in despite of his dress, which indeed had more of the pilgrim than the ordinary beggar, looked from height, manner, and emphasis of voice and gesture, rather like a grey palmer or eremite preacher, the ghostly counsellor {{of the young men}} who were around him, than the object of their charity. His speech, indeed, was as homely as his habit, but as bold and unceremonious as his erect and dignified demeanour. [...] "What are ye come here for, young men?" [...] he said, addressing himself to the surprised audience; [...] "are ye come amongst the most lovely works of God to break his laws? Have ye left the works of man, the houses and the cities that are but clay and dust, like those that built them--and are ye come here among the peaceful hills, and by the quiet waters, that will last whiles aught earthly shall endure, to destroy each other's lives, that will have but an unco short time, by the course of nature, to make up a lang account at the close o't? O sirs! hae ye brothers, sisters, fathers, that hae tended ye, and mothers that hae travailed for ye, friends that hae ca'd ye like a piece o' their ain heart? and is this the way ye tak to make them childless and brotherless and friendless? Ohon! it's an ill <b>feight</b> whar he that wins has the warst o't. Think on't, bairns. I'm a puir man--but I'm an auld man too--and what my poverty takes awa frae the weight o' my counsel, grey hairs and a truthfu' heart should add it twenty times. Gang hame, gang hame, like gude lads--the French will be ower to harry us ane o' thae days, and ye'll hae feighting eneugh, and maybe auld Edie will hirple out himsell if he can get a feal-dyke to lay his gun ower, and may live to tell you whilk o' ye does the best where there's a good cause afore ye." ...|$|E

50|$|A recreational-type android {{that was}} {{intended}} as a friend for <b>Feight</b> and used to be a helper/source of entertainment among her family. He is now her boyfriend, but whether or not he understands love is unknown. He has a very innocent, friendly and helpful personality. His positive nature makes him trustful of the good qualities in others, rather than dwelling over their faults. These traits are what endear him to <b>Feight.</b> Because he's young, he can be hyperactive at times and rather naive. He is the only android member of the Ampersand division of P.A.C.E.R.|$|E
5000|$|Crawford, {{affiliated}} with the Ku Klux Klan, had allegedly contacted an Albany synagogue and a Jewish organization, and asked for their assistance with technology {{that could be used}} against Israel's enemies. Crawford also plotted to kill President Obama with the device. The undercover agents rendered the weapon inoperable to eliminate potential danger to the public.

50|$|The Earle of Southerland {{his host}} converyning spedelie, went on forward to pursue Clangun, {{according}} to promise. Bot meitting first, by chance, with Wm. Macky (the brother of Houcheon Macky), acompanied with divers of his cuntriemen of Strathnaver, who had even then taken and careid away James Mack-Rory his cattel out of Corrikean Loch in the Diri-Meanigh (James Mack-Rory being then the Earle of Southerland's depender), they rescued {{and brought back}} the booty and cattell. They chased William Macky and the Strathnaver men all that day, and killed one of the principalls of the Clangun in Strathnaver, called Angus-Roy, with sundrie others of William Macky his company. This wes called Claw-tom-Richi, (that is, {{the day of the}} hather bush). About the evening, they followed them, in hote chace, even to the merches and bounds of Catteynes, wher the Clangun had assembled, heiring that the inhabitants of Catteynes wer gathered together, and wer up in armes, and had taken up ther cattell.In this meantyme, William Macky, with the Strathnaver men, joyned with the Clangun, (whom they met in the hilles by chance); they promised to die and live together, and to participat of eithers fortunes, good or bad. Heirvpon, they perceave the Earle of Catteynes his host in sight of them, which wes conducted by Henrie Sinclair, the Laird of Dun his brother. Then they goe to consultation among themselves whether they suld <b>feight</b> against the Catteynes men, fresh and in breath, attending them, or turn aganest the Southerland men, who were wearied with ther labor the day preceiding. William Macky his opinion wes to invade the Southerland men, alreadie tyred with feighting. Bot the Clangun did choyse rather to hazard against the Catteynes men, which they did, without fear or delay, being far inferior in number. Yit they had in mynd, that nothing wes befor them bot enemies, the deip and bottomles ocean behind them; no place of retrait; no suretie bot valor and victory; so haveing the advantage of the hill, the set upon the enemy with a resolute courage. The Catteynes men came short with ther first flight of arrowes; by the contrarie, the Clangun spared ther shot until they came hard to the enemy, which then they bestowed among them with great advantage. In end, by the speciall help and assistance of the Almightie God, (in whose hands are the hearts of men, and the events of things) the Clangun overthrew the Catteynes men at Aldgown, upon the borders of Catteynes, the yeir of God 1586, and killed seaven score of ther most resolute men, with ther captane, Henrie Sincler, cousin to the Earle of Catteynes, and uncle to Houcheon and William Mckay. The Catteynes host had been all destroyed, had not the darknes of the night favored their flight, withholding the victors from the following chase. William Macky wes sore for the slaughter of his uncle Henry Sinclair, whom he knew not to be their till he was slain; bot afterward in the chase William Macky spared no man. The Southerland men knowing nothing of Clangun, had lost the sight of the Strathnaver men whilst they had them in chase amongst those hills, immediatlie befor this skirmish at Ald-gowne, and so had retired into ther owne countrey to repose themselves with the booty they had recovered; wherby they understood nothing of this skirmish until it wes finished.This disaster justlie befell the Earle of Catteynes, becaus, that since this overthrow, he hath oppinlie confessed to divers men, that it wes never his intention to pursue the Clangun at that tyme; bot his purpose and policie wes, that they might be hotely and eagerlie pursued, and then he wold releive them from that imminent danger, therby to mak them the more beholding to him and his posteritie in all tyme cumming. Bot the Almightie God did measure him rightlie, and turned his fraud and subtile policie to his own shame, and the destruction of divers of his cuntriemen. Presntlie after the skirmish at Ald-Gowne, the Earle of Catteynes (being careid with a spriite of revenge and furie against the Clangun), hanged John Mack-ean-Mack-rob, chiftane of the Clangun, in Catteynes, whom he had keiped and deteyned in captivity a good whyle, haveing, befor this tyme, trained him into Girngo to speak with him.Houcheon Macky wes then in Catteynes with Earle George, whose father sister he had mareid. But the inhabitants of Catteynes understanding that his brother, William Macky, wes with the Clangun at the conflict of Ald-Gown, they sought for Houcheon to slay him; wherupon he wes forced, in all hast, to flie secreitlie into Strathnaver, therby to eschew their present furie. Thus thie fell out some variance betuen the inhabitants of Catteynes and Strathnaver for assisting the Clangun; so that, in a maner, as soon as the Southerland men had neir ended ther troubles with Catteynes, and drew to some setleing for a short space, the Strathnaver men, assisted by the Clangun, (as iff ordained to revenge the Southerland men's wrongs one upon another), began to assault the Sinclairs, and the inhabitants of Catteynes, with the lyk afflictions, which I doe ommit to relate particularlie, as apperteyning litle to my subject.|$|E

To that end some relevant definitions on logistics are given and the working procedure of the SAST-project is described. Five driving forces explaining the fast-changing logistic scene are given. Also five critical issues which came out of the SAST-report are summarized. From this a number of conclusions are drawn concerning European policy in general and the science and technology policy more specifically. The focus of this article is on the transport aspect of logistics...|$|E
