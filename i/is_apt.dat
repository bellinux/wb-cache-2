He evidently strives {{to be fair to}} friends and foes alike, but appears sometimes to fail to see that after all he is much like many others in this respect. Possessed of a fine intellect, and extremely fond of the game, he <b>is</b> <b>apt</b> to lose sight of all other considerations, people and business alike. Chess is his very life and soul, the one thing for which he lives.|$|E
5|$|The Antarctic scallop {{can swim}} rather slowly by {{opening and closing}} its valves. It {{advances}} in this way with {{the rim of the}} shell to the front. It can detect the movement of nearby objects with its rudimentary eyes and, in order to escape predators, can move much more swiftly umbones first, by clapping its valves shut. A remotely controlled camera stationed on the sea bed <b>is</b> <b>apt</b> to find that all the scallops that were originally in its field of view have moved off to other locations.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{territory}} has a cool, dry climate, although areas in the south have more moisture, with most rain falling between June and September.

25|$|He is {{essentially}} a satirist without any stable point of view from which to aim his satire. He <b>is</b> <b>apt</b> to turn his back on what he has been sniping at to demolish what he has just been defending. He is contemptuous of everybody except the opportunist and the unscrupulous little woman who, {{at some point in}} every picture, labels the hero a poor sap. That the invariable fairy godfather of each picture is not only expressive of his own cold-blooded cynicism but of typical Hollywood fantasy {{is an example of how}} this works. Another phase of his attack is shrouding in slapstick the fact that the godfather pays off not for perseverance or honesty or ability but merely from capriciousness.|$|E
25|$|The subtitle, A Novel {{without a}} Hero, <b>is</b> <b>apt</b> because the {{characters}} are all flawed {{to a greater or}} lesser degree; even the most sympathetic have weaknesses, for example Captain Dobbin, who is prone to vanity and melancholy. The human weaknesses Thackeray illustrates are mostly to do with greed, idleness, and snobbery, and the scheming, deceit and hypocrisy which mask them. None of {{the characters are}} wholly evil, although Becky's manipulative, amoral tendencies make her come pretty close. However, even Becky, who is amoral and cunning, is thrown on her own resources by poverty and its stigma. (She is the orphaned daughter of a poor artist and an opera dancer.) Thackeray's tendency to highlight faults in all of his characters displays his desire for a greater level of realism in his fiction compared to the rather unlikely or idealised people in many contemporary novels.|$|E

It was given this status on 30 January 1968 and has been listed because it is regarded as [...] "a good example of a simple 19th-century rural church". Cadw (the Welsh Government body responsible for the built heritage of Wales and the inclusion of Welsh buildings on the statutory lists) states that it is [...] "coherently designed in an early Gothic style which <b>is</b> <b>apt</b> for its scale".|$|E

500|$|Stanley's {{achievements}} in office were mixed. He established various specialist departments to manage output in numerous industries and reorganised {{the structure of}} the Board. However, despite previous successes with unions, his negotiations were ineffective. Writing to Leader of the House of Commons and future Prime Minister Bonar Law in January 1919, Lloyd George described Stanley as having [...] "all the glibness of Runciman and that <b>is</b> <b>apt</b> to take in innocent persons like you and me... Stanley, to put it quite bluntly, is a funk, and {{there is no room for}} funks in the modern world."

In the past, occasional government references to speech that it considered 'out-of-bounds' were understood to be implicit threats to invoke the ISA." [...] The Singapore Government itself has regularly raised the need to prevent national security threats from materializing as a justification for preventive detention. However, there have been suggestions that the criminal law <b>is</b> <b>apt</b> for dealing with this matter as well.

40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} three supplements to a design lingua franca [1]: extensions, enclaves, and exotic ideas (EEE). The goal of EEE {{is to be}} able to decide upon novel suggestions for improving the established design conceptualization of an application.

And exotic ideas might be valuable but <b>are</b> <b>apt</b> to lead to complexity, being as they are, additions to the existing conceptualization. The simplicity of EEE allows designers and non-designers (e. g. stakeholders, business analysts, managers, etc.) to communicate design ideas in a more neutral and productive way...|$|R

500|$|The {{constitutional}} {{position of}} Sophie, Anne's mother, became difficult after Frederick's death in 1588, {{when she found}} herself in a power struggle with the Rigsraad for control of King Christian. As a matchmaker, however, Sophie proved more diligent than Frederick and, overcoming sticking points on the amount of the dowry and the status of Orkney, she sealed the agreement by July 1589. Anne herself seems to have been thrilled with the match. On 28 July 1589, the English spy Thomas Fowler reported that Anne was [...] "so far in love with the King's Majesty as it were death to her to have it broken off and hath made good proof divers ways of her affection which his Majestie <b>is</b> <b>apt</b> in no way to requite." [...] Fowler's insinuation, that James preferred men to women, would have been hidden from the fourteen-year-old Anne, who devotedly embroidered shirts for her fiancé while three hundred tailors worked on her wedding dress.|$|E
500|$|Mark Coleman from Rolling Stone {{described}} [...] "Back in Business" [...] as a [...] "nagging headache". It {{contains a}} [...] "slow-verse-fast-chorus" [...] sequence. According to Rooksby, [...] "the chorus bursts into life, with Madonna clearly relishing the lyrics about good guys finishing last... the coldness of her delivery <b>is</b> <b>apt</b> for the topic." [...] Her vocals {{are accompanied by}} muted trumpet sounds and a saxophone solo. [...] "More" [...] is the second Sondheim number where Madonna recites the materialistic-themed lyrics with irony, over a bouncy two-beat with tap-dancing during an instrumental break. The track consists of syncopated chord structure, tempo changes and lyrical rhymes. The arrangement switches between slow and fast tempo, requiring proper enunciation by Madonna. The final Sondheim song, [...] "What Can You Lose", is the duet with Patinkin. It is a torch song where Patinkin supplies the male voice while Madonna sings during the second verse with strings and harmonics.|$|E
500|$|Seekers has {{received}} generally positive reviews. Publishers Weekly praised the suspenseful {{ending of the}} first book and thought readers would find great interest in the bears' struggle to survive. Booklist found {{the plot of the}} first book to have an [...] "interesting balance of cute anthropomorphic characterization and realistic attention to bear behaviors." [...] School Library Journal wrote [...] "from the first page, this story is exciting and refreshing" [...] and [...] "he plot is fast paced, and the author <b>is</b> <b>apt</b> at creating and sustaining the adrenaline-charged mood of these youngsters on their own." [...] Kirkus Review found that [...] "Hunter creates a richly sensuous world filled with cruelty, beauty, tenderness, savagery and just enough underlying legendary background to add mystery." [...] However, the reviewer also felt that too much detail went into developing the characters and setting and there was very little plot. In a review for the second and third books, Horn Book Review felt that readers might experience some confusion about the mountain, but they would still enjoy the fantasy adventure and the descriptions of the animals.|$|E

500|$|The {{film was}} {{received}} conflicting reviews by both The Moving Picture World and The New York Dramatic Mirror. The reviewer for the World said, [...] "This well known story is rendered into a motion picture {{in a way}} that will please the most exacting. ... The picture proves that a good rendering of even an old story is attractive. The audience apparently delights in the character of John Halifax. He is quite as good on the curtain as he is in the book, and there he has always been a favorite. The different parts are played to perfection. The character of the daughter and the ill son are both faithfully reproduced and seem to live before the audience." [...] The Mirror reviewer The film is not as well acted as Thanhouser pictures usually are. The strict character of the old Quaker is insufficiently expressed and <b>is</b> <b>apt</b> to leave the audience to guess why John is ordered out, and the strike scene is far from impressive. The mob to a man wave their sticks incessantly, instead of portraying intense rage as should have been done." [...] Bowers noted that the Mirror was not a neutral party in respect to the works of the Independent producers.|$|E
500|$|The English {{tradition}} of semi-opera, to which The Fairy-Queen belongs, demanded {{that most of}} the music within the play be introduced through the agency of supernatural beings, the exception being pastoral or drunken characters. All the masques in The Fairy-Queen are presented by Titania or Oberon. Originally Act I contained no music, but due to the work's enormous success it was revived in 1693, when Purcell added the scene of the Drunken Poet and two further songs later on in the work; [...] "Ye gentle spirits of the air" [...] and [...] "The Plaint". As noted above, each masque is subtly related to the action in the play during that particular act in a metaphorical way. In this manner we have Night and Sleep in Act II, which <b>is</b> <b>apt</b> as that act of the play consists of Oberon's plans to use the power of the [...] "love-in-idleness" [...] flower to confuse various loves, and it is therefore appropriate for the allegorical figures of Secrecy, Mystery et al. to [...] usher in a night of enchantment. The masque for Bottom in Act III includes metamorphoses, songs of both real and feigned love, and beings who are not what they seem. The Reconciliation masque between Oberon and Titania at the end of Act IV prefigures the final masque. The scene changes to a Garden of Fountains, denoting King William's hobby, just after Oberon says [...] "bless these Lovers' Nuptial Day". The Four Seasons tell us that the marriage here celebrated is a good one all year round and [...] "All Salute the rising Sun"/...The Birthday of King Oberon". The kings of England were traditionally likened to the sun (Oberon = William. Significantly, William and Mary were married on his birthday, 4 November.). The Chinese scene in the final masque is in homage to Queen Mary's famous collection of china. The garden shown above it and the exotic animals bring King William back into the picture and Hymen's song in praise of their marriage, plus the stage direction bringing (Mary's) china vases containing (William's) orange trees {{to the front of the}} stage complete the symbolism.|$|E
