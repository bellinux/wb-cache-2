40|$|The {{nucleotide}} {{sequence of the}} entire transforming early region of <b>E</b> 1 <b>b</b> of the highly oncogenic adenovirus type 12 (Ad 12) DNA has been determined. The total sequence (3860 base pairs) encompasses the entire transforming early region E 1 of Ad 12 DNA. From the sequence for the <b>E</b> 1 <b>b</b> region of Ad 12, and the transcription map of the <b>E</b> 1 <b>b</b> region (1, 2, 3, and this paper) the structure and gene organization of the early region <b>E</b> 1 <b>b</b> of Ad 12 DNA were analyzed and {{compared with those of}} the <b>E</b> 1 <b>b</b> region in the non-oncogenic Ad 5 DNA (4, 5). Most of the sequences in the <b>E</b> 1 <b>b</b> region of Ad 12 was highly homologous to that of Ad 5. It is predicted that the Ad 12 region <b>E</b> 1 <b>b</b> codes for polypeptides of 53. 9, 19. 1, and 8. 9 kd. This situation is identical with that of the Ad 5 region <b>E</b> 1 <b>b</b> which codes for polypeptides of 54. 9, 20. 6, and 8. 3 kd.

40|$|The <b>E</b> 1 <b>B</b> 55 k gene in {{adenovirus}} type 5 was {{studied by}} generating recombinant viruses {{in which the}} <b>E</b> 1 <b>B</b> 55 k gene was N-terminally tagged with either a cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) tag or a tandem affinity purification (TAP) tag. By infecting cells with the recombinant adenovirus expressing CFP tagged <b>E</b> 1 <b>B</b> 55 k, localisation of the <b>E</b> 1 <b>B</b> 55 k protein during infection could be studied. Generation of the recombinant viruses expressing TAP tagged <b>E</b> 1 <b>B</b> 55 k would allow purification of the <b>E</b> 1 <b>B</b> 55 k protein and any cellular or viral proteins that interacted with <b>E</b> 1 <b>B</b> 55 k. By infecting different cell types and harvesting at set time points during infection, the proteins interacting with <b>E</b> 1 <b>B</b> 55 k at different time points during infection could be identified. The <b>E</b> 1 <b>B</b> 55 k protein is modified by small ubiquitin modifying protein 1 (SUMO- 1) at lysine residue 104 within the SUMO consensus sequence, and sumoylation can be abolished by mutating the lysine residue to an arginine (Endter et al, 2001). Therefore in order to study the effect of SUMOylation of <b>E</b> 1 <b>B</b> 55 k, on adenovirus infection, CFP and TAP tagged recombinant viruses in which the <b>E</b> 1 <b>B</b> 55 k protein was mutated to contain an unmodificable arginine at postion 104 were also generated. Stable cell lines expressing TAP tagged wild type <b>E</b> 1 <b>B</b> 55 k, and <b>E</b> 1 <b>B</b> 55 k in which lysine residue 104 had been mutated to an arginine were also generated as an alternative method to study the interacting proteins of <b>E</b> 1 <b>B</b> 55 k. Four different isoforms of SUMO have been identified, named SUMO 1 - 4. Stable cell lines expressing SUMO- 2 were infected with wild type adenovirus type 5 and harvested at set time points {{in order to determine}} if any adenoviral proteins were modified by SUMO- 2...|$|R
5|$|George Ledyard Stebbins Jr. (January 6, 1906 – January 19, 2000) was an American {{botanist}} and geneticist who {{is widely}} {{regarded as one of the}} leading evolutionary biologists of the 20th century. Stebbins received his Ph.D. in botany from Harvard University in 1931. He went on to the University of California, Berkeley, where his work with <b>E.</b> <b>B.</b> Babcock on the genetic evolution of plant species, and his association with a group of evolutionary biologists known as the Bay Area Biosystematists, led him to develop a comprehensive synthesis of plant evolution incorporating genetics.|$|E
5|$|He was {{admitted}} into the Colegio Nacional de La Plata in 1936. After {{graduating from high}} school, he {{was admitted}} to the School of Medicine at the National University of La Plata. During his third year, he began his medical residency at the Hospital Policlínico San Martín, a medical center that received the most complicated cases from much of Buenos Aires province. This residency brought him into contact with patients for the first time. He attended procedures carried out by professors José María Mainetti and Federico <b>E.</b> <b>B.</b> Christmann, from whom he learned the simplicity and standardization that he would later apply to cardiovascular surgery, one of his many great contributions to cardiovascular operating techniques.

40|$|SummaryThe dehydrogenase/decarboxylase (<b>E</b> 1 <b>b)</b> {{component}} of the 4 MD human branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex (BCKDC) is a thiamin diphosphate (ThDP) -dependent enzyme. We have determined the crystal structures of <b>E</b> 1 <b>b</b> with ThDP bound intermediates after decarboxylation of α-ketoacids. We show that a key tyrosine residue in the <b>E</b> 1 <b>b</b> active site functions as a conformational switch to reduce the reactivity of the ThDP cofactor through interactions with its thiazolium ring. The intermediates do not assume the often-postulated enamine state, but likely a carbanion state. The carbanion presumably facilitates the second E 1 b-catalyzed reaction, involving the transfer of an acyl moiety from the intermediate to a lipoic acid prosthetic group in the transacylase (<b>E</b> 2 <b>b)</b> {{component of}} the BCKDC. The tyrosine switch further remodels an <b>E</b> 1 <b>b</b> loop region to promote <b>E</b> 1 <b>b</b> binding to <b>E</b> 2 <b>b.</b> Our results illustrate the versatility of the tyrosine switch in coordinating the catalytic events in <b>E</b> 1 <b>b</b> by modulating the reactivity of reaction intermediates...|$|R

5|$|Passport to Pimlico {{explores the}} spirit and unity of wartime London in a post-war context and offers an {{examination}} of the English character. Like other of the Ealing comedies, the film pits a small group of British against a series of changes to the status quo from an external agent. The story was an original concept by the screenwriter T. <b>E.</b> <b>B.</b> Clarke. He was inspired by an incident during the Second World War, when the maternity ward of Ottawa Civic Hospital was temporarily declared extraterritorial by the Canadian government so that when Princess Juliana of the Netherlands gave birth, the baby was born on Dutch territory, and would not lose her right to the throne.|$|E
5|$|Speciation {{requires}} {{a degree of}} reproductive isolation—that is, a reduction in gene flow. However, it is intrinsic {{to the concept of}} a species that hybrids are selected against, opposing the evolution of reproductive isolation, a problem that was recognised by Darwin. The problem does not occur in allopatric speciation with geographically separated populations, which can diverge with different sets of mutations. <b>E.</b> <b>B.</b> Poulton realized in 1903 that reproductive isolation could evolve through divergence, if each lineage acquired a different, incompatible allele of the same gene. Selection against the heterozygote would then directly create reproductive isolation, leading to the Bateson–Dobzhansky–Muller model, further elaborated by H. Allen Orr and Sergey Gavrilets. With reinforcement, however, natural selection can favor an increase in pre-zygotic isolation, influencing the process of speciation directly.|$|E
5|$|The Audubon Naturalist Society also {{actively}} opposed such spraying programs, and recruited Carson to {{help make}} public the government's exact spraying practices and the related research.

By 1958, Carson had arranged a book deal, with plans to co-write with Newsweek science journalist Edwin Diamond. However, when The New Yorker commissioned a long and well-paid article on the topic from Carson, she began considering writing more than simply the introduction and conclusion as planned; soon it was a solo project. (Diamond would later write one of the harshest critiques of Silent Spring).|$|E

5|$|In 1935, Stebbins {{was offered}} a {{genetics}} research position at the University of California, Berkeley working with geneticist <b>E.</b> <b>B.</b> Babcock. Babcock needed assistance with a large Rockefeller-funded project characterizing the genetics and evolutionary processes of plants from the genus Crepis and was interested in developing Crepis into a model plant, to enable genetic investigations similar to those possible in the model insect Drosophila melanogaster. Like the genera that Stebbins had previously studied, Crepis commonly hybridized, displayed polyploidy (chromosome doubling), and could make seed without fertilization (a process known as apomixis). The collaboration between Babcock and Stebbins produced numerous papers and two monographs. The first monograph, published in 1937, resulted in splitting off the Asiatic Crepis species into the genus Youngia. The second, published in 1938, was titled The American Species of Crepis: their interrelationships and distribution as affected by polyploidy and apomixis.|$|E
