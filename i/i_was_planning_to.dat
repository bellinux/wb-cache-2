He was one of six Indian players to receive bans, four of which were suspended bans. The unprecedented severity of the bans precipitated an international cricketing, political and administrative crisis, with the Indian cricket establishment threatening to call off the tour unless Mike Denness was removed as match referee from the third test match. ICC backed Mike Denness and the South African board backed the Indian cricket establishment and did not allow Mike Denness to enter the stadium {{on the first day of}} the third test match. ICC declared that the match was 'unofficial' and 'friendly five day match' and the series was officially declared as a 2 match series and South Africa as 1–0 winners. The subsequent England tour to India was placed in jeopardy when India picked Sehwag in the Test squad. Subsequent to this development, ICC issued a warning that any match with Sehwag in the cricket team will not be considered an [...] "official" [...] Test match until Sehwag had served his one match ban. After negotiations with ECB and ICC and in general interest of cricket, Sehwag was dropped from the team for the first Test against England.

He fought terribly against this, but there was nothing for him to do but agree, and so now we are engaged on approbation, as it were. This is a great relief to me in various ways, because I feel as if I were safely anchored, and not drifting about whichever way the wind blows, while other people are sailing where they want to; and yet, whenever I please, I can loosen my anchor, and spread my sails, and skim away over the beautiful sea." ...|$|E

50|$|As {{the threat}} of war between Arbogast and Eugenius and Theodosius I became more imminent, Arbogast and Eugenius moved their {{collective}} force towards the defenses of the Julian Alps, where they made camp in Milan and were joined by Nicomachus Flavianus, who had consulted the Pagan entrails and proclaimed a future victory for the Pagan cause under the names of Eugenius and Arbogastes. Hoping to use the Julian Alps to their advantage, Arbogast and Eugenius planned to use them as the location for their series of ambushes that would, in theory, lead to the encirclement of Theodosius I and his troops. As this was being planned by his enemies, Theodosius I set off from Constantinople for war in the middle of May, reaching Adrianople on June 20, 394 AD. However, upon arriving at Sirmium, Theodosius I took time to reinforce his troops, causing a delay in the expected arrival time of Theodosius, something Arbogast and Eugenius had been counting on for their ambush tactics. Because of the delay, Arbogast thought as though Theodosius <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>planning</b> <b>to</b> out flank them by use of an amphibious assault to their south that would have come from behind the heavily defended Adriatic coast. In thinking this, Arbogast dispatched a substantial portion of his forces to the south, which proved to be a costly maneuver by Arbogast.|$|E
50|$|Also in the 1990s, Halley {{started to}} produce {{site-specific}} installations for museums, galleries, and public spaces that would {{interact with the}} surrounding architecture. His installations mix imagery and media such as painting, fiberglass relief sculpture, wall-size flowcharts, and digitally generated wallpaper. Halley created his first site-specific installation at the Dallas Museum of Art; this installation included paintings, silkscreen prints, wallpaper, and murals of flow charts and other images. The flow charts had entered Halley’s lexicon around 1994 as both elements of paintings and as independent works; they are “readymade models from textbooks and manuals and other such sources of hierarchies or processes of various kinds, from business hierarchies and divisions of labor to psychological and sociological theories of human relationships and behavior to commodity-production processes.” Describing his new approach, specifically the implementation of flow charts on the walls, Halley said: When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>planning</b> <b>to</b> include them charts in my Dallas show some people {{said that it would}} be too didactic to put a flow chart next to a painting to show the connections between them. But I use flow charts that are as opaque as possible; in other words there is no specific information. In fact, they make no sense without their captions.
