5|$|After {{the special}} session of Congress had adjourned, Sherman {{returned}} home to Mansfield. He spoke on behalf of Ohio Governor Charles Foster's <b>effort</b> <b>for</b> a second term and went to Kenyon College with ex-President Hayes, where he received an honorary degree. Sherman looked forward to staying with his wife at home {{for an extended period}} {{for the first time in}} years, when news arrived that Garfield had been shot in Washington. The assassin, Charles J. Guiteau, was a deranged office-seeker who believed that Garfield's successor would appoint him to a patronage job. After lingering for several months, Garfield died, and Arthur became president. After completing a long-planned visit to Yellowstone National Park and other Western sites with his brother William, Sherman returned to a second special session of Congress in October 1881.|$|E
5|$|Australia's openers Morris and Barnes {{successfully}} {{negotiated the}} new ball by Edrich and Bedser to reach stumps with 17 without loss after 15 minutes. Ideal batting conditions greeted {{the players on}} the second day. Barnes and Morris took the score to 73 before Laker removed Morris. Bradman came in and the score progressed to 121 before Barnes was caught by wicket-keeper Evans with a one-handed diving <b>effort</b> <b>for</b> 62. Miller was then dismissed for a duck by Laker.|$|E
5|$|By 1976, a twinjet layout, {{similar to}} the one which had debuted on the Airbus A300, became the {{baseline}} configuration. The decision to use two engines reflected increased industry confidence in the reliability and economics of new-generation jet powerplants. While airline requirements for new wide-body aircraft remained ambiguous, the 7X7 was generally focused on mid-size, high-density markets. As such, it was intended to transport large numbers of passengers between major cities. Advancements in civil aerospace technology, including high-bypass-ratio turbofan engines, new flight deck systems, aerodynamic improvements, and lighter construction materials were to be applied to the 7X7. Many of these features were also included in a parallel development <b>effort</b> <b>for</b> a new mid-size narrow-body airliner, code-named 7N7, which would become the 757. Work on both proposals proceeded through the airline industry upturn in the late 1970s.|$|E

5|$|During World War II, Havelock {{moved away}} from the socialist organisations he had been {{associated}} with, and in 1944 was elected founding president of the Ontario Classical Association. One of the association's first activities was organising a relief <b>effort</b> <b>for</b> Greece, which had just been liberated from Nazi control. Havelock continued to write about politics, however, and his political and academic work came together in his ideas about education; he argued for the necessity of an understanding of rhetoric for the resistance to corporate persuasiveness.|$|E
5|$|In Albany, New York, a disk jockey named Bryan Jackson helped {{organize}} a relief <b>effort</b> <b>for</b> the Texas town {{of the same}} name, with sponsorship from radio station WOKO and a local supermarket chain. After raising six tons of emergency aid and $1,000 from area residents, a C-130 airplane was loaded with the provisions, but the plane was continuously grounded due to calls saying that Albany, Texas was not a disaster area and did not need the relief. After what was described by U.S. Senator Samuel S. Stratton as almost a comedy of errors, the flight {{was funded by the}} Defense Department and was able to take off. In addition, a sheriff dispatch in the Texas town mentioned that aid was possibly being sent from several other towns with the same name as well as from other Texas towns like Abilene.|$|E
5|$|In the Aegean Sea, Greece has {{allocated}} a {{large area}} {{for the preservation of}} the Mediterranean monk seal and its habitat. The Greek Alonissos Marine Park, that extends around the Northern Sporades islands, is the main action ground of the Greek MOm organisation. MOm is greatly involved in raising awareness in the general public, fundraising for the helping of the monk seal preservation cause, in Greece and wherever needed. Greece is currently investigating the possibility of declaring another monk seal breeding site as a national park, and also has integrated some sites in the NATURA 2000 protection scheme. The legislation in Greece is very strict towards seal hunting, and in general, the public is very much aware and supportive of the <b>effort</b> <b>for</b> the preservation of the Mediterranean monk seal.|$|E

5|$|In the playoffs, Cleveland {{swept the}} Pistons and the Atlanta Hawks {{to earn a}} matchup with the Orlando Magic in the Conference Finals. In Game 1 of the series, James scored 49 points on 66 percent {{shooting}} in a losing <b>effort</b> <b>for</b> the Cavaliers. In Game 2, he hit a game-winner to tie the series at 1–1. Cleveland would lose the series in six games, and following the loss in Game 6, James immediately left the floor without shaking hands with his opponents, which was an act that many media members viewed as unsportsmanlike. For the series, he averaged 38.5 points, 8.3 rebounds, and 8 assists per game, finishing the postseason with a career playoff-high 35.3 points per game.|$|E
5|$|In their ninth {{game of the}} season, the Tar Heels lost to No. 2 Florida State, 203. The {{loss was}} the sole losing <b>effort</b> <b>for</b> the Tar Heels in the 1997 season, and came {{at the hands of}} the {{eventual}} Atlantic Coast champion Seminoles. During the game, the Tar Heels also lost their then-starting quarterback, Oscar Davenport, to a broken ankle. North Carolina recovered from the loss to win its final two games: 1710 against Clemson, and 5014 over Duke. Despite having only one loss, the Tar Heels were denied a chance to participate in a Bowl Alliance game and instead accepted a bid to the 1998 Gator Bowl.|$|E
5|$|Noether {{planned to}} return to Moscow, an <b>effort</b> <b>for</b> which she {{received}} support from Alexandrov. After she left Germany in 1933 he tried to help her gain a chair at Moscow State University through the Soviet Education Ministry. Although this effort proved unsuccessful, they corresponded frequently during the 1930s, and in 1935 she made plans {{for a return to}} the Soviet Union. Meanwhile, her brother Fritz accepted a position at the Research Institute for Mathematics and Mechanics in Tomsk, in the Siberian Federal District of Russia, after losing his job in Germany, and was subsequently executed during the Great Purge.|$|E

5|$|On 25 February the PAVN deluged {{the base}} with {{artillery}} fire and then launched a conventional armored/infantry assault. Smoke, dust and haze precluded observation by an American forward air control (FAC) aircraft, which was flying above 4,000 feet to avoid anti-aircraft fire. When a U.S. Air Force F-4 Phantom jet {{was shot down}} in the area, the FAC left {{the area of the}} battle to direct a rescue <b>effort</b> <b>for</b> the downed aircraft crew, sealing the fate of the base. PAVN troops and tanks then overran the position, capturing the ARVN brigade commander in the process. FSB 31 was secured by the PAVN at an estimated cost of 250 killed, and 11 PT-76 and T-54 tanks destroyed. The Airborne had suffered 155 killed and over 100 captured.|$|E
5|$|Pyrosomes are colonial tunicates {{and each}} zooid has {{a pair of}} {{luminescent}} organs {{on either side of}} the inlet siphon. When stimulated by light, these turn on and off, causing rhythmic flashing. No neural pathway runs between the zooids, but each responds to the light produced by other individuals, and even to light from other nearby colonies. Communication by light emission between the zooids enables coordination of colony <b>effort,</b> <b>for</b> example in swimming where each zooid provides part of the propulsive force.|$|E
5|$|The LSA aims {{to advance}} the {{scientific}} study of language and accomplishes this goal through advocacy efforts. The Society, recognizing its growing role in advocacy, established a Secretariat in Washington, DC in 1969 to better liaise between its membership and the government. Around that same time, the LSA began working with other professional organizations to meet and exchange research as part of the Consortium of Social Science Associations (COSSA). During the Reagan administration after cuts to social science funding in 1981, the LSA and 9 other professional organizations founded COSSA as an advocacy <b>effort</b> <b>for</b> the funding of social science research.|$|E

5|$|The Luftwaffe command {{understood}} that their support would be {{crucial for the}} success of Operation Citadel, but problems with supply shortfalls hampered their preparations. Partisan activity, particularly behind Army Group Center, slowed the rate of re-supply and cut short the Luftwaffe's ability to build up essential stockpiles of petrol, oil, lubricants, engines, munitions, and, unlike Red Army units there were no reserves of aircraft {{that could be used to}} replace damaged aircraft over the course of the operation. Fuel was the most significant limiting factor. To help build up supplies for the support of Citadel, the Luftwaffe greatly curtailed its operations during the last week of June. Despite this conservation of resources, the Luftwaffe did not have the resources to sustain an intensive air <b>effort</b> <b>for</b> more than a few days after the operation began.|$|E
5|$|To Heart 2 {{development}} originally {{began as}} a collaborative <b>effort</b> <b>for</b> the PlayStation 2 between the Osaka and Tokyo studios of Aquaplus. During one of the staff meetings for the partnered project, To Heart 2 was conceived when a staff member jokingly mentioned {{the possibility of a}} sequel for the original To Heart. Production began shortly after once the team realized the popularity and success of the forerunner. Naoya Shimokawa, the president of Aquaplus, produced the resulting project, and Tsutomu Washimi served as the game's director.|$|E
5|$|Also in 1928, she {{assisted}} in the search <b>effort</b> <b>for</b> the wrecked airship Italia, which had crashed on the polar ice northeast of Svalbard. In addition, Roald Amundsen, who had also joined the search effort, went missing himself. Strassbourg arrived in Tromsø, Norway, on 19 June, to search for both Italia and Amundsen's aircraft. The ship's bow was not designed to operate in an Arctic environment, and so the crew had to continually fix wood planks to the hull {{to protect it from}} the ice. While refueling from the tanker Durance, Strassbourg took on two FBA 17 seaplanes to assist in the search effort. On 30 August, Strassbourg located one of the floats from Amundsen's aircraft, confirming the loss of the plane. The search effort was called off on 17 September, and Strassbourg returned to Brest by way of Reykjavík, arriving back in France by mid October.|$|E

5|$|Any {{offensive}} planning by the U.S. was, however, {{limited by}} the passage on 29 December 1970 of the Cooper-Church Amendment, which prohibited U.S. ground forces and advisors from entering Laos. Dewey Canyon II would, therefore, be conducted within territorial South Vietnam in order to reopen Route 9 {{all the way to}} the old Khe Sanh Combat Base, which had been abandoned by U.S. forces in 1968. The base would be reopened and would then serve as the logistical hub and airhead of the ARVN incursion. U.S. combat engineers were tasked with clearing Route 9 and rehabilitating Khe Sanh while infantry and mechanized units secured a line of communications along the length of the road. American artillery units would support the ARVN effort within Laos from the South Vietnamese side of the border while Army logisticians coordinated the entire supply <b>effort</b> <b>for</b> the South Vietnamese. Air support for the incursion would be provided by the aircraft of the U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps, and U.S. Army aviation units were tasked with providing complete helicopter support for the ARVN operation.|$|E
5|$|Before the 2009 AFL season, Selwood was {{appointed}} to the club's seven-man leadership group at just 20years of age. After the 2008 Grand Final loss ended Geelong's previous season, Selwood and his teammates began their 2009 campaign by capturing the pre-season NAB Cup {{for the second time in}} four years. Selwood's 33disposals, 11clearances, and 2goals earned him the Michael Tuck Medal as the player adjudged best afield in this final. In round five, Selwood made his 50th senior appearance, setting a new VFL/AFL record for the highest percentage of wins inside 50games. His involvement in 46victories set a winning percentage of 92 percent. In addition, Selwood's 50th appearance coincided with the club's own record-setting <b>effort</b> <b>for</b> the most successful 50game stretch in VFL/AFL history. Geelong had won 47 out of 50games—Selwood had been involved in 46—eclipsing Essendon's return of 46wins and 4losses during their dominant stretch during the 1999–2001 seasons.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, twenty-one {{northwest}} Washington tribes, {{joined by}} the United States filed a Request for Determination in U.S. District Court, asking the court {{to find that the}} State of Washington has a treaty-based duty to preserve fish runs and habitat sufficiently for the tribes to earn a “moderate living,” and sought to compel the state to repair or replace culverts that impede salmon migration. On August 22, 2007, the district court issued a summary judgment order, holding that while culverts impeding andromadous fish migration are not the only factor diminishing their upstream habitat, in building and maintaining culverts that impede salmon migration, Washington State had diminished the size of salmon runs within the case area and thereby violated its obligation under the Stevens Treaties. On March 29, 2013, the court issued an injunction ordering the state to significantly increase the <b>effort</b> <b>for</b> removing state-owned culverts that block habitat for salmon and steelhead, and to replace the state-owned culverts that have the greatest adverse impact on the habitat of andromadous fish by 2030.|$|E
