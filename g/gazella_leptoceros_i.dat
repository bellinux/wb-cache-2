25|$|A {{protected}} {{area in the}} Tibesti range has been proposed to preserve the area's rhim gazelle (<b>Gazella</b> <b>leptoceros)</b> and Barbary sheep (Ammotragus lervia) populations, which are {{the largest in the}} world. The {{protected area}} would be modeled after the Ouadi Rimé-Ouadi Achim Faunal Reserve to the south; however, there is currently insufficient funding available for the project.|$|R
50|$|The most {{important}} mammals are the dorcas gazelle (Gazella dorcas) and rhim gazelle (<b>Gazella</b> <b>leptoceros),</b> both highly threatened by uncontrolled hunting. The sand cat (Felis margarita), striped hyena (Hyaena hyaena) and the fennec fox (Vulpes zerda) are {{observed in the}} area only rarely. Rodents found in the area include sand rat (Psammomys obesus), greater Egyptian gerbil (Gerbillus pyramidum) and the Libyan jird (Meriones libycus).|$|R
50|$|Gazelles (Gazella dorcas and <b>Gazella</b> <b>leptoceros)</b> also {{inhabit the}} Qattara Depression, being an {{important}} food {{source for the}} cheetah. The largest gazelle population exists in the southwestern part of the Qattara Depression within a vast area of wetlands and soft sand. The area of 900 km2, includes the wild oases of Hatiyat Tabaghbagh and Hatiyat Umm Kitabain, and is a mosaic of lakes, salt marshes, scrubland, wild palm groves and Desmostachya bipinnata grassland.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe data {{provided}} {{is related to}} the article “Phylogenetic analyses of gazelles reveal repeated transitions of key ecological traits and provide novel insights into the origin of the genus Gazella” [1]. The data is based on 48 tissue samples of all nine extant species of the genus Gazella, namely Gazella gazella, Gazella arabica, Gazella bennettii, Gazella cuvieri, <b>Gazella</b> dorcas, <b>Gazella</b> <b>leptoceros,</b> <b>Gazella</b> marica, Gazella spekei, and Gazella subgutturosa and four related taxa (Saiga tatarica, Antidorcas marsupialis, Antilope cervicapra and Eudorcas rufifrons). It comprises alignments of sequences of a cytochrome b data set and of six nuclear intron markers. For the latter new primers were designed based on cattle and sheep genomes. Based on these alignments phylogenetic trees were inferred using Bayesian Inference and Maximum Likelihood methods. Furthermore, ancestral character states (inferred with BayesTraits 1. 0) and ancestral ranges based on a Dispersal-Extinction-Cladogenesis model were estimated and results׳ files were stored within this article...|$|R
50|$|The {{topographic}} and {{climatic conditions}} {{of the country has}} resulted in faunal species dominated by rare species such as African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana), striped hyena, Northwest African cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus hecki), waterbuck, African leopard (Panthera pardus pardus), West African lion (Panthera leo senegalensis), antelope, common warthog (Phacochoerus africanus), scimitar oryx (Oryx dammah), hippopotamuses (Hippopotamus amphibius) in the Niger River, crocodiles, horned vipers, lizards, pythons, manatee, the endemic Nigerian giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis peralta) which is endangered, the Critically Endangered dama gazelle, which is the national symbol of Niger (named meyna or ménas in the Hausa language) as well as Soemmerring's gazelle (Nanger soemmerringii), Grant's gazelle (Nanger granti) and slender-horned gazelle (<b>Gazella</b> <b>leptoceros).</b>|$|R
50|$|There are varying {{habitats}} in the ecoregion including sandy systems, rocky plateaus, wadis, depressions and mountains. Each {{has its own}} characteristic {{species and}} there is considerable endemism of both plants and animals in the area. Small mammals endemic to the Sahara area include the four-toed jerboa (Allactaga tetradactyla), North African gerbil (Gerbillus campestris), James's gerbil (G. jamesi), pale gerbil (G. perpallidus), lesser short-tailed gerbil (G. simoni), sand gerbil (G. syrticus), fat-tailed gerbil (Pachyuromys duprasi) and Shaw's jird (Meriones shawi). Larger mammals include the dorcas gazelle (Gazella dorcas), mountain gazelle (Gazella cuvieri) and slender-horned gazelle (<b>Gazella</b> <b>leptoceros).</b> There {{are a variety of}} snakes and lizards, including two endemic species, desert agama (Trapelus mutabilis) and Natterers gecko (Tropiocolotes nattereri). There are few amphibians, Brongersma's toad (Bufo brongersmai) being endemic to the coastal region of North Africa. Among the bird species, the Houbara bustard (Chlamydotis undulata) and Nubian bustard (Neotis nuba) have decreased in numbers because of hunting pressure.|$|R
25|$|The {{large mammals}} {{present in the}} {{ecoregion}} are the addax (Addax nasomaculatus), Barbary sheep (Ammotragus lervia), dorcas gazelle (Gazella dorcas), and rhim gazelle (<b>Gazella</b> <b>leptoceros).</b> However, rodents are the most represented order of mammals in the Tibesti, and include the Agag gerbil (Gerbillus agag), Balochistan gerbil (Gerbillus nanus), Cairo spiny mouse (Acomys cahirinus), lesser Egyptian jerboa (Jaculus jaculus), Libyan jird (Meriones libycus), Mzab gundi (Massoutiera Mzabi) and the North African gerbil (Gerbillus campestris). Also present are cats such as the African wildcat (Felis silvestris lybica) and, more rarely, the caracal (Caracal caracal) and the Sudan cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus soemmeringii), {{as well as several}} canine species including the Egyptian wolf (Canis anthus lupaster), fennec fox (Vulpes zerda) and Rüppell's fox (Vulpes rueppellii). The striped hyena (Hyaena hyaena) may also occupy the range. There may be as many as 50 endangered painted hunting dogs (Lycaon pictus) in the Tibesti, although some regard these relict populations as extirpated, partially due to the Darfur refugee turmoil and other Sudan generated conflicts. Bats are heavily represented in the Tibesti, including the desert long-eared bat (Otonycteris hemprichii), greater mouse-tailed bat (Rhinopoma microphyllum), Hamilton's tomb bat (Taphozous hamiltoni), Mauritian tomb bat (Taphozous mauritianus) and the trident bat (Asellia tridens). The Cape hare (Lepus capensis), desert hedgehog (Paraechinus aethiopicus), olive baboon (Papio anubis), rock hyrax (Procavia capensis) and the Saharan striped polecat (Ictonyx libyca) also populate the area.|$|R
40|$|Parasite {{control in}} wild {{ruminants}} is based mainly on anthelmintics. The {{objective of the}} present study was to evaluate three parasite control programs in seven herds of captive wild ruminants in 3 consecutive years. In the first year, a biannual spring-summer treatment regime with fenbendazole at 7. 5 mg/kg body weight p. o. for 3 days was applied. The next year, an early-season treatment program with three administrations of fenbendazole at the same dosage at 3 -wk intervals was used. In the third year, an early-season treatment program with ivermectin (0. 2 mg/kg p. o. for 3 days), applied three times at 5 -wk intervals, was evaluated. Effectiveness of these control programs was assessed by fecal egg counts and by scores of body condition and fecal consistency at weekly intervals. Involved animal species were Arabian oryx (Oryx leucoryx), scimitar-horned oryx (Oryx dammah), slender-horned gazelle (<b>Gazella</b> <b>leptoceros),</b> Soay sheep (Ovis aries soay), ibex (Capra ibex), red deer (Cervus elaphus hippelaphus), and Nelson's elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni). With the spring-summer regime, fecal egg counts remained low during the first 5 mo, but from September onward, they slowly increased to significant levels in all seven herds. The early-season program with fenbendazole resulted in fecal egg counts near zero during the entire year in four herds but a significant egg shedding from August onward was noted in Arabian oryx, scimitar-horned oryx, and Soay sheep. The early-season program with ivermectin resulted in very low to zero egg shedding in gazelle, adult Soay sheep, ibex, red deer, and Nelson's elk during the entire grazing season, but failed to prevent high shedding in October in Arabian oryx and scimitar-horned oryx. High contamination of grassy pastures with infective larvae/eggs in the previous year or before the first treatment may explain failure of the treatment regimes in some herds...|$|R
40|$|Faecal {{stable isotope}} {{compositions}} reflect wildlife diets, if digestive processes along the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) do not alter diet–faeces isotopic relationships in an unpredictable way. We investigated 13 C and 15 N compositions of digesta along the ruminant GIT, using Saanen dairy goats kept on pure grass hay or browse for > 20 days. Isotopic changes {{occurred in the}} ventral rumen, and in the small intestine, where digesta had significantly higher δ 13 C and δ 15 N (associated with lower C or higher N content, respectively) values relative to other GIT sites. However, effects on isotope fractionation were small (∼ 1. 0 ‰ for δ 13 C and∼ 2. 0 ‰ for δ 15 N), and were reversed in the hindgut such that faecal isotope compositions {{did not differ from}} the foregut. No other substantial isotopic changes occurred across GIT sites, despite the morphophysiological complexity of the ruminant GIT. We found similarly small differences across GIT components of rheem gazelles (<b>Gazella</b> <b>leptoceros)</b> fed a mixture of C 3 lucerne and C 4 grass, although in this case faeces were 15 N-depleted relative to other GIT components. Along with differences in δ 15 N between goats fed browse or grass, this result implies a systematic difference in diet–faeces δ 15 N relationships, contingent on the botanical composition of ruminant diets. Thus, while our results support faecal δ 13 C as a reliable proxy for wildlife diets, further work on factors influencing faecal 15 N abundance is needed. Finally, we note high levels of isotopic variability between individuals fed the same diets, even accounting for the relatively short duration of the experiments, suggesting an important influence of stochasticity on isotope fractionation...|$|R
40|$|Faecal {{egg count}} {{patterns}} and clinical signs associated with gastro-intestinal (GI) nematodes of 107 zoo ruminants were monitored at fortnightly intervals for 1 year. The ruminants {{in this study}} were kept under different husbandry conditions at two sites of the Royal Zoological Society of Antwerp, the Antwerp Zoo and the Animal Park Planckendael. Artiodactylids involved were Arabian oryx (Oryx leucoryx), scimitar-horned oryx (Oryx dammah), bongos (Tragelaphus euryceros isaaci), sitatungas (Tragelaphus spekii gratus), common eland (Taurotragus oryx), impala (Aepyceros melampus), slender-horned gazelles, (<b>Gazella</b> <b>leptoceros),</b> blue wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus taurinus), Kordofan giraffes (Giraffe camelopardalis antiquorum) and okapi (Okapia johnstoni). Nematode eggs were recovered from 586 of 1606 (36. 5 %) individual faecal samples, using flotation techniques. Infection levels were distinctly low at Antwerp Zoo, probably due to zero grazing and daily dung removal. At Planckendael, the herds of Arabian oryx, scimitar-horned oryx and slender-horned gazelles showed markedly higher egg counts than the other herds, with more than 10 % of the faecal egg counts having more than 100 eggs per gram (epg) and maximum faecal egg counts of 600, 750 and 1350 epg, respectively. Faecal egg counts increased during the mid-grazing season (July) and peaked {{at the end of the}} grazing season (October). No clinical signs, such as loss of faecal consistency, could be correlated with faecal egg counts (P > 0. 05). With the exception of significantly more Nematodirus spp. eggs that were present in juvenile eland, no differences in faecal egg counts could be found between the sexes and different age groups. Abomasa and intestines of 17 animals that died during the survey were available for total worm counts. In one Arabian oryx, four slender-horned gazelles and one sitatunga low burdens ranging from 200 to 14, 300 were found. Nematode species recovered were Camelostrongylus mentulatus from the abomasa and Trichostrongylus retortaeformis, Nematodirus fillicollis, Capillaria spp. and Trichuris spp. from the intestines. Our findings suggest different nematode infection levels between herds, which are mainly due to husbandry conditions but to a lesser extent to species- or individual susceptibility. Identification of ungulates that are highly infected and knowledge of the seasonal variation of their helminths can contribute greatly to a well-adjusted species-specific management and helminth control program...|$|R
