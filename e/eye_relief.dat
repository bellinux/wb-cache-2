5|$|Compared to {{standard}} telescopic sights, a reflector sight {{can be held}} at any distance from the eye (does not require a designed <b>eye</b> <b>relief),</b> and at almost any angle, without distorting {{the image of the}} target or reticle. They are often used with both eyes open (the brain will tend to automatically superimpose the illuminated reticle image coming from the dominant eye onto the other eye's unobstructed view), giving the shooter normal depth perception and full field of view. Since Reflector sights are not dependent on <b>eye</b> <b>relief,</b> they can theoretically be placed in any mechanically-convenient mounting position on a weapon.|$|E
5|$|The viewing {{portion of}} a {{reflector}} sight does not use any refractive optical elements, {{it is simply a}} projected reticle bounced off a beam splitter or curved mirror right into the users eye. This gives it the defining characteristics of not needing considerable experience and skill to use, as opposed to simple mechanical sights such as iron sights. A reflector sight also does not have the field of view and <b>eye</b> <b>relief</b> problems of sights based on optical telescopes: depending on design constraints their field of view is the user's naked eye field of view, and their non-focusing collimated nature means they don't have the optical telescopes constraint of <b>eye</b> <b>relief.</b> Reflector sights can be combined with telescopes, usually by placing the telescope directly behind the sight so it can view the projected reticle creating a telescopic sight, but this re-introduces the problems of narrow field of view and limited <b>eye</b> <b>relief.</b> The primary drawback of reflector sight is that they need some way to illuminate the reticle to function. Reticles illuminated by ambient light are hard to use in low light situations, and sights with electrical illumination stop functioning altogether if that system fails.|$|E
50|$|<b>Eye</b> <b>relief</b> — <b>Eye</b> <b>relief</b> is the {{distance}} from the rear eyepiece lens to the exit pupil or eye point. It is {{the distance}} the observer must position his or her eye behind the eyepiece in order to see an unvignetted image. The longer the focal length of the eyepiece, the greater the <b>eye</b> <b>relief.</b> Typical telescopic sights may have <b>eye</b> <b>relief</b> ranging from 25 mm to over 100 mm, but telescopic sights intended for scout rifles or handguns need much longer <b>eye</b> <b>relief</b> to present an unvignetted image. Telescopic sights with relatively long <b>eye</b> <b>relief</b> are favourable to avoid recoil induced facial and eye injuries and use in instances where it is difficult to hold the eyepiece steady. <b>Eye</b> <b>relief</b> can be particularly important for eyeglass wearers. The eye of an eyeglass wearer is typically further from the eye piece which necessitates a longer <b>eye</b> <b>relief</b> in order to still see the entire field of view.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Eye</b> <b>relief</b> is a {{particularly}} important (but often overlooked) parameter for spectacle wearers if the full field of view is to be visible. Although magnification, objective lens diameter and field of view (either in degrees or m @1000m) are often shown {{on the body of}} the monocular, <b>eye</b> <b>relief</b> virtually never is (except perhaps to say [...] "long eye relief" [...] or [...] "LER"). Early optics tended to have short <b>eye</b> <b>relief</b> (sub 10mm) but more contemporary designs are now much better. At least 15mm is desirable - ideally nearer 20mm - for spectacle wearers. (See table of eye reliefs below, noting the best in class, Opticron 5x30 at 25mm and Opticron 8x42 DBA at 21mm). <b>Eye</b> <b>relief</b> can seriously compromise the field of view if too short, so even if an optic has a good field of view specification, without an accompanying long <b>eye</b> <b>relief,</b> the benefit of the wide view will not be obtained (again, only applying to spectacle wearers). Good <b>eye</b> <b>relief</b> can greatly be facilitated by the eye lens diameter. The photograph below shows a comparison between two 8x monoculars, {{the one on the left}} typical of a 1980s design and with a relatively small eyepiece lens diameter (11mm) and sub 10mm <b>eye</b> <b>relief.</b> The one on the right is more contemporary - from 2016 - and with a relatively large eyepiece diameter (24mm) and approx. 15mm <b>eye</b> <b>relief.</b> This large eyepiece lens not only helps <b>eye</b> <b>relief</b> but also helps to create a wider field of view.|$|E
5000|$|The Weaver rail {{above the}} action and barrel allow either for {{conventional}} positioning of a scope with normal 1.5 in - 3.5 <b>eye</b> <b>relief</b> or for the forward placement of a [...] "scout scope" [...] with intermediate or long <b>eye</b> <b>relief.</b> The latter is more faithful to Cooper's Scout concept, and the Steyr-Mannlicher rifle can be ordered from the factory with a low-magnification Leupold scope with long <b>eye</b> <b>relief.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Eye</b> <b>relief</b> {{typically}} {{ranges from}} about 2 mm to 20 mm, {{depending on the}} construction of the eyepiece. Long focal-length eyepieces usually have ample <b>eye</b> <b>relief,</b> but short focal-length eyepieces are more problematic. Until recently, and still quite commonly, eyepieces of a short-focal length have had a short <b>eye</b> <b>relief.</b> Good design guidelines suggest a minimum of 5-6 mm to accommodate the eyelashes of the observer to avoid discomfort. Modern designs with many lens elements, however, can correct for this, and viewing at high power becomes more comfortable. This is especially the case for spectacle wearers, who may need up to 20 mm of <b>eye</b> <b>relief</b> to accommodate their glasses.|$|E

60|$|She was {{preparing}} herself for a nervous break-down, {{and she knew}} it.

To add to the strain, she could not forget the tragedy. She remained as close to the horror as on the first morning when the unexpected stalked into the cabin and took possession. In her daily ministrations upon the prisoner she was forced to grit her teeth and steel herself, body and spirit.|$|R
50|$|The <b>eye</b> <b>relief</b> of {{an optical}} {{instrument}} (such as a telescope, a microscope, or binoculars) is {{the distance from}} the last surface of an eyepiece within which the user's eye can obtain the full viewing angle. If a viewer's eye is outside this distance, a reduced field of view will be obtained. The calculation of <b>eye</b> <b>relief</b> is complex, though generally, the higher the magnification and the larger the intended field-of-view, the shorter the <b>eye</b> <b>relief.</b>|$|E
50|$|The eye {{needs to}} be held at a certain {{distance}} behind the eye lens of an eyepiece to see images properly through it. This distance is called the <b>eye</b> <b>relief.</b> A larger <b>eye</b> <b>relief</b> means that the optimum position is farther from the eyepiece, making it easier to view an image. However, if the <b>eye</b> <b>relief</b> is too large it can be uncomfortable to hold the eye in the correct position {{for an extended period of}} time, for which reason some eyepieces with long <b>eye</b> <b>relief</b> have cups behind the eye lens to aid the observer in maintaining the correct observing position. The eye pupil should coincide with the exit pupil, the image of the entrance pupil, which in the case of an astronomical telescope corresponds to the object glass.|$|E
50|$|The <b>eye</b> <b>relief</b> {{given in}} product {{specifications}} {{does not always}} give a realistic view of what a user can expect. Although eye-cups can usually be folded down to allow the spectacle wearer {{to get closer to}} binocular eyepieces, there are sometimes lens mountings that do not allow the theoretical <b>eye</b> <b>relief</b> to be obtained. A better measure for those with strict needs would be one that takes account of this available <b>eye</b> <b>relief,</b> the theoretical value less any thickness of the lens' rims. This point can account for confusion in performance and is rarely expressed clearly.|$|E

50|$|An early {{practical}} refractor telescope based {{telescopic sight}} {{was built in}} 1880 by August Fiedler (Stronsdorf, Austria), forestry commissioner of Prince Reuss.Later telescopic sights with extra long <b>eye</b> <b>relief</b> became available for handgun and scout rifle use.

50|$|Because {{there is}} no magnification, the shooter need not worry about {{parallax}} or <b>eye</b> <b>relief.</b> The long <b>eye</b> <b>relief</b> makes red dot sights appropriate for firearms with heavy recoil that might drive a conventional short <b>eye</b> <b>relief</b> telescopic sight into the shooter's eye. Since dot sights can be mounted at any distance from the shooter's eye with no issues of focus, military rifle mounts usually place the sight in any mechanically-convenient mounting position, such as the carrying handle of the M16 rifle, or on a rail system (typically a Picatinny rail) {{on top of the}} rifle. This leaves plenty of room for night vision equipment to be used with the red dot sight.|$|E

50|$|After the {{outbreak}} of the war, Baumann, still with fragile health, participated as volunteer in protecting the Swiss border. In 1915 he was again released from military service and went for health treatments in Davos and Arosa. In 1918 Baumann joined the architectural office of Rudolf Gaberel in Davos, where he maintained friendships with Jakob Bosshart, Wilhelm Schwerzmann and the expressionist Ernst Ludwig Kirchner. In 1919 he won the first prize in a contest for a monument for the Bernese cavalry units on the Lueg near Burgdorf. This project was, however, not realized, because he refused, to combine it with a, in his <b>eyes,</b> worthless <b>relief</b> of the sculptor Karl Hänny.

50|$|The Plössl is an {{eyepiece}} usually {{consisting of}} two sets of doublets, designed by Georg Simon Plössl in 1860. Since the two doublets can be identical this design is sometimes called a symmetrical eyepiece. The compound Plössl lens provides a large 50° or more apparent field of view, along with relatively large FOV. This makes this eyepiece ideal {{for a variety of}} observational purposes including deep-sky and planetary viewing. The chief disadvantage of the Plössl optical design is short <b>eye</b> <b>relief</b> compared to an orthoscopic since the Plössl <b>eye</b> <b>relief</b> is restricted to about 70-80% of focal length. The short <b>eye</b> <b>relief</b> is more critical in short focal lengths below about 10 mm, when viewing can become uncomfortable especially for people wearing glasses.|$|E
5000|$|For a shooter, <b>eye</b> <b>relief</b> is also {{a safety}} consideration. If the <b>eye</b> <b>relief</b> of a {{telescopic}} sight is too short, leaving the eye close to the sight, the firearms recoil can force the optic to strike the skin around the shooters eye, leaving a cut. This is frequently called the [...] "idiot cut" [...] due to the obvious and long-lasting nature of such a mistake. Typical <b>eye</b> <b>relief</b> distances for telescopic sights are often between one and four inches (25 to 100 mm), {{as opposed to the}} much shorter 15 to 17 mm for typical binoculars. The exit pupil widths in rifle sights are designed to be larger than the eyes pupil, to allow for a range of motion without vignetting.|$|E
50|$|<b>Eye</b> <b>relief</b> {{distance}} can {{be particularly}} important for eyeglass wearers and shooters. The eye of an eyeglass wearer is typically further from the eyepiece so needs a longer <b>eye</b> <b>relief</b> in order to still see the entire field of view. A simple practical test {{as to whether or}} not spectacles limit the field of view can be conducted by viewing first without spectacles and then again with them. Ideally there should be no difference in the field.|$|E

40|$|Proposed {{is a novel}} eye vision testing {{system based}} on micromachines that uses micro-optic, micromechanic, and microelectronic technologies. The micromachines include a {{programmable}} micro-optic lens and aperture control devices, pico-projectors, Radio Frequency (RF), optical wireless communication and control links, and energy harvesting and storage devices with remote wireless energy transfer capabilities. The portable lightweight system can measure eye refractive powers, optimize light conditions for the eye under testing, conduct color-blindness tests, and implement <b>eye</b> strain <b>relief</b> and <b>eye</b> muscle exercises via time sequenced imaging. A basic eye vision test system is built in the laboratory for near-sighted (myopic) vision spherical lens refractive error correction. Refractive error corrections from zero up to − 5. 0 Diopters and − 2. 0 Diopters are experimentally demonstrated using the Electronic-Lens (E-Lens) and aperture control methods, respectively. The proposed portable eye vision test system is suited for children’s eye tests and developing world eye centers where technical expertise may be limited. Design of a novel low-cost human vision corrective eyewear is also presented based on the proposed aperture control concept. Given its simplistic and economical design, significant impact can be created for humans with vision problems in the under-developed world...|$|R
