5|$|Over {{time the}} {{increased}} {{numbers of people}} gathering at the site resulted in tensions between the Jewish visitors who wanted easier access and more space, and the residents, who complained of the noise. This <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> to Jewish attempts at gaining ownership of the land adjacent to the Wall.|$|E
5|$|The {{song thrush}} is {{the emblem of}} West Bromwich Albion Football Club, chosen because the public house in which the team used to change kept a pet thrush in a cage. It also <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> to Albion's early nickname, The Throstles.|$|E
50|$|In males, the UG sinus {{is divided}} into three regions: upper, pelvic, and phallic. The upper part <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> to the urinary bladder and the pelvic part <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> to the prostatic and {{membranous}} parts of the urethra. The phallic portion <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> to the penile urethra.|$|R
50|$|Because each nucleus {{contains}} {{a large population}} of neurons, the dorsal column nuclei <b>give</b> <b>rise</b> to characteristic bumps or tubercles when viewing the posterior side of the intact brainstem.

5|$|Alphonso Boone, the {{grandson}} of Daniel Boone, settled in what would later become Wilsonville in 1846 and established the Boones Ferry across the Willamette River in 1847. The ferry <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> to the community of Boones Landing, which eventually grew into Wilsonville.

50|$|Diagonal slices {{through the}} Fourier {{operator}} <b>give</b> <b>rise</b> to chirps. Thus {{rotation of the}} Fourier operator <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> to the fractional Fourier transform, which {{is related to the}} chirplet transform.|$|R
5|$|Balzac uses meticulous, {{abundant}} {{detail to}} describe the Maison Vauquer, its inhabitants, and the world around them; this technique <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> to his title {{as the father of}} the realist novel. The details focus mostly on the penury of the residents of the Maison Vauquer. Much less intricate are the descriptions of wealthier homes; Madame de Beauséant's rooms are given scant attention, and the Nucingen family lives in a house sketched in the briefest detail.|$|E
5|$|Cambodian Rocks was {{the first}} release of its kind, {{followed}} {{by a number of}} similar compilations like Cambodian Cassette Archives and other unrelated titles by the same or similar names, inspired by the original or exploiting its weak standing with regard to intellectual property. It also <b>gave</b> <b>rise,</b> in part, to a broader trend of Western interest in obscure psychedelic and progressive rock {{from the rest of the}} world.|$|E
5|$|Caroline Island is {{believed}} to have originated from a volcanic hotspot which eroded and then became home to a coral reef which grew above the ocean surface. Although these geological processes are poorly understood, the orientation of the Line Islands (roughly north-south) suggests that they were formed more than 40 million years ago, before the Pacific Plate changed its direction of travel. The same hotspot more recently <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> to the Tuamotu Archipelago.|$|E
50|$|Two {{alternative}} CDFs can be used: the logistic {{and normal}} CDFs. The logistic CDF <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> to the logit {{model and the}} normal CDF <b>give</b> <b>rises</b> to the probit model.|$|R

5|$|Despite Reich's {{precarious}} mental health, {{his work}} on character {{and the idea of}} muscular armouring contributed to the development of what is now known as ego psychology, <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> to body psychotherapy, and helped shape the Gestalt therapy of Fritz Perls, the bioenergetic analysis of Reich's student Alexander Lowen, and the primal therapy of Arthur Janov.|$|E
5|$|In 1613 Sigismund III Vasa {{reached an}} {{understanding}} with Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor, based on which both sides agreed {{to cooperate and}} mutually provide assistance in suppressing internal rebellions. The pact neutralized the Habsburg Monarchy {{in regard to the}} Commonwealth's war with Russia, but had resulted in more serious consequences after the Bohemian Revolt <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> to the Thirty Years' War in 1618.|$|E
5|$|In another study, {{methylation}} of the EFS CpG {{island was}} observed in 69% of cases of uveal melanoma (UM) and only UM with EFS methylation <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> to metastases. RT-PCR expression analysis revealed a significant inverse correlation between EFS mRNA expression with EFS methylation in UM. EFS methylation was tissue-specific with full methylation in peripheral blood cells, but no methylation in other tissues such as fetal muscle, kidney and brain.|$|E
50|$|The scale anomaly, which <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> to {{a running}} {{coupling}} constant. In QED this <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> to {{the phenomenon of}} the Landau pole. In Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) this leads to asymptotic freedom.|$|R
50|$|For each conjugacy {{class of}} G, {{we have a}} {{different}} superselection sector (wrt the worldsheet). The conjugacy class consisting of the identity <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> to the untwisted sector and all the other conjugacy classes <b>give</b> <b>rise</b> to twisted sectors. It's easy to see that since the observables are only modulo G, two different g's which are conjugate to each other <b>give</b> <b>rise</b> to the same sector.|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} precise {{definition}} of a continuous time dynamical system made up of interacting open subsystems. The interconnections of subsystems are coded by directed graphs. We prove that the appropriate maps of graphs called graph fibrations <b>give</b> <b>rise</b> to maps of dynamical systems. Consequently surjective graph fibrations <b>give</b> <b>rise</b> to invariant subsystems and injective graph fibrations <b>give</b> <b>rise</b> to projections of dynamical systems...|$|R
5|$|Muni began {{service on}} December 28, 1912, when the A Geary-Park line was inaugurated, running between the Financial District and the Richmond District {{on the western}} side of the city. Expansion of the system and {{consolidation}} with other transit companies eventually made Muni the city's sole public transit operator in 1952, when it acquired the bankrupt California Street Cable Railroad. Subsequent changes and adjustments to the system <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> to the lines in use today.|$|E
5|$|Nikephoros Komnenos {{is one of}} {{the first}} {{documented}} members of the Komnenos family, but nothing is known of his early life or his connection to the main branch of the family, which eventually <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> to the imperial dynasty. The Greek scholar Konstantinos Varzos suggested that he was born , and that he was the younger brother of the Komnenian dynasty's patriarch, Manuel Erotikos Komnenos, but neither assumption can be verified.|$|E
5|$|ONs may {{join the}} Old Norvicensian Society, an {{association}} for former pupils. Predecessors in the 18th and 19th centuries include the Parrian Club, a dining society for former pupils of Samuel Parr's headship, and the Valpeian Club, after Edward Valpy. In 1866, {{the latter was}} replaced by The Norwich School Club which <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> to the current association for former pupils, which emerged {{at the beginning of}} the 20th century.|$|E
