500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of these defeats at sea, and with the food supply in Valletta dwindling, the British sent another demand for capitulation. Vaubois again refused, with the reply [...] "Cette place est en trop bon état, et je suis moi-même trop jaloux de bien servir men payset de conserver mon honneur, por écouter vos propositions." [...] ("This place is in too good a situation, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>too</b> conscious of the service of my country and my honour, {{to listen to your}} proposals"). In reality, the situation was dire: during February, prices of basic foodstuffs stood at 16 francs for a fowl, 12 francs for a rabbit, 20 sous for an egg, 18 sous for a lettuce, 40 sous for a rat and six francs per pound for fish. For the civilian typhus patients, the only food available was a horse-flesh soup.|$|E

500|$|Aboard Guillaume Tell, the British found {{evidence}} {{of the severity of}} the food shortages in Valletta: [...] "the only thing found in La Guillaume Tell was the leg of a mule, hung for safety and his especial use of the admiral's stern-galley". News of the capture of Guillaume Tell was immediately passed to Vaubois by the British besiegers, along with a demand that he surrender the island. The French general, despite dwindling food supplies, refused, stating [...] "Cette place est en trop bon état, et je suis moi-même trop jaloux de bien servir mon pays et de conserver mon honneur, pour écouter vos propositions." [...] ("This place is in too good a situation, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>too</b> conscious of the service of my country and my honour, to listen to your proposals"). Despite Vaubois' defiance, the garrison was rapidly starving, and although the French commander resisted until 4 September, he was eventually forced to surrender Valletta and all of its military equipment to the British.|$|E
500|$|Carey {{was unable}} to film an {{accompanying}} music video for the single; {{at the time of}} its release, she was recovering from a physical and emotional breakdown that left her hospitalized in August 2001, and caused her to cancel all public appearances to promote Glitter. She said, [...] "When I was asked about the video I said, 'I can't do it today'. And nobody could accept that answer. And that's when I started to get mad. I was, like, look, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>too</b> fatigued. I'm overly-tired, I can't do it as a human being. And nobody was hearing those last two words — human being. They were used to the Mariah that always says, 'Come on, let's fight, let's go'. They just weren't used to me ever saying no. I never said no before". Instead, a video was created using a scene taken directly from the film, where Billie Frank (played by Carey) sings the song at Madison Square Garden during her first sold-out concert. Frank's performance of the song in the film omits its entire second verse, and the song's development runs in parallel with the film's love story.|$|E

2500|$|Murasaki {{suffered}} overwhelming loneliness, {{had her own}} {{concerns about}} aging, and was not happy living at court. She became withdrawn, writing that perhaps the other women considered her stupid, shy or both: [...] "Do they really look on me as such a dull thing, I wonder? But I am what <b>I</b> <b>am....</b> <b>too</b> has often remarked that she thought I {{was not the kind}} of person with whom one could ever relax.... I am perversely stand-offish; if only I can avoid putting off those for whom I have genuine respect." [...] Keene speculates that as a writer who required solitude Murasaki's loneliness may have been [...] "the loneliness of the artist who craves companionship but also rejects it". He points out she had [...] "exceptional powers of discernment" [...] and probably alienated the other women, about 15 or 16 of whom she describes in her diary. Although she adds praise for each woman, her criticism is more memorable because she saw through and described their flaws.|$|E

2500|$|As {{the winner}} of the 1884 Prix de Rome with his {{composition}} L'enfant prodigue, he received a scholarship to the Académie des Beaux-Arts, which included a four-year residence at the Villa Medici, the French Academy in Rome, to further his studies (1885–1887). According to letters to Marie-Blanche Vasnier, perhaps in part designed to gain her sympathy, he found the artistic atmosphere stifling, the company boorish, the food bad, and the monastic quarters [...] "abominable". Neither did he delight in Italian opera, as he found the operas of Donizetti and Verdi not to his taste. Debussy was often depressed and unable to compose, but he was inspired by Franz Liszt, whose command of the keyboard he found admirable. In June 1885, he wrote of his desire to follow his own way, saying, [...] "I am sure the Institute would not approve, for, naturally it regards the path which it ordains as the only right one. But there is no help for it! <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>too</b> enamoured of my freedom, too fond of my own ideas!" ...|$|E

The Evening News, meanwhile declared the serial to be [...] "a jolly good successor to Quatermass". Not so impressed was L. Marsland Gander in the Daily Telegraph who wrote, [...] "As a devotee of Prof. Hoyle and a keen student of disembodied intelligence I felt impatient... <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>too</b> well acquainted with [...] work to be disappointed, but the temptation is great". A harsher verdict came from Philip Phillips of the Daily Herald who said, [...] "The next six episodes might be brilliant. But I won't be watching them" [...] while The Sunday Times said, [...] "I cannot with the best will find anything in the least exciting about A for Andromeda".|$|E

2500|$|Russell {{soon came}} to believe that Wittgenstein was a genius, {{especially}} after he had examined Wittgenstein's written work. He wrote in November 1911 that he had at first thought Wittgenstein might be a crank, but soon decided he was a genius: [...] "Some of his early views made the decision difficult. He maintained, for example, at one time that all existential propositions are meaningless. This was in a lecture room, and I invited him to consider the proposition: 'There is no hippopotamus in this room at present.' When he refused to believe this, I looked under all the desks without finding one; but he remained unconvinced." [...] Three months after Wittgenstein's arrival Russell told Morrell: [...] "I love him & feel he will solve the problems <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>too</b> old to solve ... He is the young man one hopes for." [...] Wittgenstein later told David Pinsent that Russell’s encouragement had proven his salvation, and had ended nine years of loneliness and suffering, during which he had continually thought of suicide. In encouraging him to pursue philosophy and in justifying his inclination to abandon engineering, Russell had, quite literally, saved Wittgenstein’s life. However, while this encouragement played a positive role, Wittgenstein’s later life was riddled with depression nonetheless. The role-reversal between him and Wittgenstein was such that he wrote in 1916, after Wittgenstein had criticized Russell's own work: [...] "His criticism, tho' I don't think you realized it at the time, was an event of first-rate importance in my life, and affected everything I have done since. I saw that he was right, and I saw that I could not hope ever again to do fundamental work in philosophy." ...|$|E
