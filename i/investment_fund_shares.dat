However, the theory of dividends and the reform of dividend taxation remain a puzzle. This paper analyzes the effect of dividend taxation on firms’ dividend policies. Using a natural experiment and difference-in-difference estimation, we find that China’s dividend tax cut in 2005 led firms to increase their dividend payments. Companies with higher proportions of tradable individual shares or <b>investment</b> <b>fund</b> <b>shares</b> were more likely to increase their dividend payments. However, opportunistic behavior also exists, where companies with higher proportions of shares held by executives {{were also more likely to}} increase their dividend payments.

40|$|In {{the current}} {{conditions}} one could hardly expect a rapid establishment {{and development of}} investment funds investing in real estate in Poland, not only {{due to the lack}} of relevant legal regulations. Among some further causes there are some technical obstacles in dealing in real estate as well as an often unclear legal status of real property. Besides, the high minimal allowed asset value is an additional deterrent. Currently, this minimal value is 0. 5 billion zl for an investment of 30 - 40 million zł. This condition follows the requirement to maintain an appropriate level of investment diversification in order to reduce the risks involved. The only specialist closed investment fund that has ever attempted to invest in real estate in Poland failed to collect even 10 % of the amount. Another obstacle in developing specialist closed investment funds investing in real estate is also the relatively short time of keeping shares by Polish investment fund shareholders (in Germany the median of keeping open <b>investment</b> <b>fund</b> <b>shares</b> being 7 years). This can impede selling off specialist closed <b>investment</b> <b>fund</b> <b>shares</b> and in the case of open funds it also implies the need to maintain a high share of liquid securities (especially T-bonds) with a view to securing possible obligations involved in share redemption. This can in consequence reduce the investment return rate. When drafting legislation concerning funds investing in real estate (especially open ones) one should focus in particular upon their investment target. Transparency of the real estate market is veiy limited, as there is no full information on the deals handled on this market; also, the object of the deals, i. e. real estate ownership, is atypical. On the market it is dealt in ownership rights, which are highly individualized and which are priced on the basis of a number of factors, such as the location, legal and physical condition, or local land development plan, all of which add up to the individual value of each property. One should therefore consider limiting the investment target of future open real estate funds only to managing and reaping profits from owned real property rather than allow speculative transactions, which should be allowed only for specialist closed investment funds. Collective real estate investment institutions are an important element of developed capital markets. It is hard not to appreciate their impact upon the development of real estate market and due to a relatively low risk involved in investing in this market, such institutions are a significant long-term saving instrument (especially toward pension). One should hope that the legislator will soon give a green light to the investments in question not only for smaller investors (for whom open real estate funds will be available) but also to e. g. open pension funds. Under the current law open pension funds are banned from investing not only directly in real estate but also in specialist closed <b>investment</b> <b>fund</b> <b>shares...</b>|$|E

The substitution and own price elasticities of purely private, subsidized individual and subsidized collective investments are derived from maximum likelihood estimates of translog system model, allowing for investment scale effects. Investments supported by public funding behave in a strongly complementary fashion to each other. Some substitution of subsidized private funding for non-subsidized private funding was found. Strong scale effects and forest investment incentives were found among forest owners in response to public investment aid.

But, {{for the last three}} years its activity is more dominated by the rapid growth and development of the so-called open-end collective investment agreement than the closed-end Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Funds</b> taking the form of limited liability company, particularly among the Investment Manager as players in the capital market. On the other side, Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Fund</b> is also purported to be a collective investment means which is favouring domestic investors, particularly small and medium investors that need both certainty and protection of their investment. What is reflected is that there are some legal aspects in the Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Funds</b> activity, mostly on the side of the Investment Manager as a company providing management service for securities portfolio or investment of its customers. Therefore, it is important to conduct research on these legal aspects to reveal the reasons why [...] particularly among the Investment Manager [...] open-end Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Funds</b> is more developed than its closed-end counterpart. It is also necessary to conduct research on the institutional character and the activities of Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Fund</b> as a business construction, the control of the government over the activities of Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Funds</b> to ensure protection of the public investors interest, and the system of responsibility of the Investment Manager to the investors in Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Fund.</b> In order to identify and to understand the above mentioned problems, this descriptive-analytical research is performed through juridical-normative and sociological approach by focusing on secondary data which is supported by primary data. Data of this research is gathered from BAPEPAM, some Investment Managers, some Representatives of Investment Manager, APEI (Indonesian Association of Securities Companies), and PIPM Semarang. In gathering data, the techniques employed in this research are document analysis, questionaire, and interview. Next, qualitative analysis is applied to the data gathered. The facts of the field resarch reveal that the growth and development of Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Funds</b> in Indonesia is more influenced by the role and participation of the Investment Managers rather than by the degree of knowledge and understanding on the side of public investors, as may be seen from the fact that the development in the open-end Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Funds</b> which is not necessarily corelated to the preference of public investors to choose Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Funds</b> product. Legal obstacles that make closed-end Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Fund</b> is less-developed than open-end Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Funds</b> among the <b>Investment</b> Managers are in fact closely related to the legal procedure of establishment, flexibility in management, support from the government [...] particularly in term of taxation, and the marketability of the product of open-end Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Funds.</b> As a business stucture, the characteristic of the institution and activity of Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Funds</b> lies more on its purpose to protect the interest of public investors in investment portfolio than on the juridical structure of company organization. Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Funds</b> institution in the form of limited liability company is cathegories as 'PT Terbuka' with specialities in the capital structure, the system/structure in managing the company's assets and the rights of the share-holders. Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Funds</b> in the formof collective investment contrat basically falls within the cathegory of business entities which are established by a particular contract containing legal relationship of providing service in management and depository of collective investment assets for the interest of investors as a single unit. In term of activity, both kind of Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Funds</b> <b>share</b> the same goals in giving investment benefit (economical rights) coming from securities portfolio, [...] which is managed by the Investment Manager [...] , in a diversified way to the beneficiary, that is the share holders/participation unit holders in a particular form influenced by the purposes character of the formation of securities portfolio of the relevant Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Funds.</b> The control of BAPEPAM over the activities of Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Funds</b> to protect public investors is hampered by the purpose and interest on the government's part in stimulating the development of the quantity of Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Funds</b> industry. Consequently, the control is more focused on fostering Investment Manager as reflected from the whistleblowing nature of the legal sanctions, from the compliance request, and the from the refusal to approve the request of dismissing Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Funds</b> by <b>Investment</b> Manager on the ground that Investment Manager is expected to participate in developing trust in the Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Funds.</b> The reponsibility system of Investment Manager as the manager of Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Funds</b> to the investor can be cathegorized as fiduciary duties, based on either the law or the management contract. As a consequence of the representative nature of the duties given, the authority of the Investment Manager is restrictied by good-faith in the transaction of the fund and the securities as the investment portfolio of the Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Funds.</b> There is also a mechanism in settling the transaction of the securities which falls within the authority and responsibility of the Custodian Bank so that interest of the investors is more protected.

40|$|Abstract The role {{of wealth}} as a {{determinant}} of household consumption choices has been thoroughly analysed by economic theory both from macro and micro perspectives; for example, the permanent life-cycle theory links long-run consumption {{not only to}} disposable income {{but also to the}} net wealth owned by each consumer over his entire life. The components of each consumer’s wealth are real and financial assets: the latter ones are diversified in deposits, securities, equities and <b>investment</b> <b>funds</b> <b>shares</b> according the different risk profile of each economic agent, while the first ones mainly consist of dwellings. In the short run the prices of financial assets are generally more volatile than those of the dwellings, since financial markets, according the efficiency market theory, (see Fama, 1970), include very quickly all the information affecting the value of a given asset. But in the long-run also housing prices present huge upward and downward shifts; such dynamics reflect the different information which have been imbedded in the housing market in the long-time. The high volatility of the dwellings’ prices in the long-run can create bubbles in the housing market, and when they burst they can potentially cause huge losses to each household in terms of her net wealth, with negative consequences both on her consumption planning and investment choices. In a macroeconomic framework these combined effects negatively push on aggregate demand with a huge shock to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and on the business cycle of a country, increasing unemployment. Moreover, bigger is the size of the GDP of the country and larger is the correlation among the financial markets of each world area, larger can be the final impact on the employment. In this paper we focus on the literature that studies the relationship between the housing market prices and the business cycle and then we analyze with a Vector Autoregressive model (VAR) and a Vector Error Correction model (VEC) this relationship in the Euro Area on the supply side. The data source is the Euro Area Statistics of the Monthly Bulletin-European Central Bank and the variables utilized are the quarterly growth rate of the Residential Property Prices and the quarterly growth rate of the Employment for the period 1981 :Q 1 – 2010 :Q 4. VAR and VEC models have been estimated by two lags for the two variables considered. The impulse response function according the Cholesky factorized decomposition points out that the response to an innovation in the quarterly growth rate of the Employment is persistent for the quarterly growth rate of the Residential Property Prices [...] In particular in the VEC model the response of the Employment to the shock in Residential Property Prices becomes persistent after six quarters. This last outcome confirms that huge upward or downward movements in the housing market prices affect the business cycle, in particular a fall or an high increase {{in the value of the}} dwellings determine a multiplied effect in the same direction in the employment in the Euro Area. ...|$|R

ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Pension {{funds are}} large {{institutional}} investors in South Africa and hold {{some of the}} highest levels of investment, relative to gross domestic product, in the world. The South African stock market is also the largest stock market in Africa. Research has shown that pension funds can {{play an important role in}} developing stock markets. This assignment investigated the impact that pension <b>fund</b> <b>investment</b> has had on the development of the South African stock market. This question is particularly relevant in the light of the changing domestic pension policy environment and the need to better develop stock markets in Southern Africa and globally to generate economic growth. The Johansen cointegration approach was applied to evaluate the impact of pension funds on the development of the South African stock market. Stock market development was measured by its depth or market capitalisation, liquidity and volatility.

Pension <b>fund</b> <b>investment</b> in <b>shares</b> increased market capitalisation, while market capitalisation was reduced when the prime lending rate was included as a control variable. Total pension <b>fund</b> <b>investment</b> decreased market capitalisation, probably through the impact of interest rates on interest-bearing assets held in the portfolio...|$|R
