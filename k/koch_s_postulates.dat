A little later in 1857 two species Stipa pennata and S. capillata are indicated without precise localities for the former Mogilev province. All these data are not conﬁrmed by herbarium specimens and seems to be erroneous. Other literature sources belong only to the cultivated species.

Fundamentally, these molecular postulates state that if a gene is involved in virulence, its removal will compromise virulence. Likewise, its reintroduction should restore virulence to the mutant. These approaches are widely employed in Cryptococcus neoformans, where gene deletion via biolistic transformation is a well-established technique. However, the complementation of these mutants is less straightforward. Currently, one of three approaches will be taken: the gene is reintroduced at the original locus, the gene is reintroduced into a random site in the genome, or the mutant is not complemented at all. Depending on which approach is utilized, the mutant may be complemented but other genes are potentially disrupted in the process. To counter the drawbacks of the current approaches to complementation we have created a new tool to assist in this key step {{in the study of}} a gene 2 ̆ 7 s role in virulence. We have identified and characterized a small gene-free region in the C. neoformans genome dubbed the "safe haven", and constructed a plasmid vector that targets DNA constructs to this preselected site. The plasmid vector integrates with high frequency, effectively complementing a mutant strain without disrupting adjacent genes. qRT-PCR of the flanking genes {{on either side of the}} safe haven site following integration of the targeting vector revealed no changes in their expression, and no secondary phenotypes were observed in a range of phenotypic assays including an intranasal murine infection model. Combined, these data confirm that we have successfully created a much-needed molecular resource for the Cryptococcus community, enabling the reliable fulfillment of the molecular Koch 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>postulates...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{dissertation}} {{submitted to}} the Faculty of Science, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, in fulfilment of requirements for the degree of Master of Science. Johannesburg, 30. 09. 2014. ABSTRACT In this dissertation we study {{the action of the}} one loop dilatation operator on operators with a classical dimension of order N. We consider the su(3) and su(2) sectors. The operators in the su(3) sector are constructed using three complex fields X, Y and Z, while operators in the su(2) sector are constructed from only the two complex fields Y and Z. For the operators in these sectors non-planar diagrams contribute already at the leading order in N and the planar and large N limits are distinct. Although the spectrum of anomalous dimensions in su(3) has been computed for this class of operators, previous studies have neglected certain terms which were argued to be small. After dropping these terms diagonalizing the dilatation operator reduces to diagonalizing a set of decoupled oscillators. In this dissertation we explicitly compute the terms which were neglected previously and show that diagonalizing the dilatation operator still reduces to diagonalizing a set of decoupled oscillators. In the su(2) sector the action of the one loop and the two loop dilatation operator reduces to a set of decoupled oscillators and factorizes into an action on the Z fields and an action on the Y fields. Direct computation has shown that the action on the Y fields is the same at one and two loops. In this dissertation, using the su(2) symmetry algebra as well as structural features of field theory, we give compelling evidence that the factor in the dilatation operator that acts on the Y s is given by the one loop expression, at any loop order.
