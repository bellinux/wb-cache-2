5|$|The FN {{has been}} part of several groups in the European Parliament. The first group it helped co-establish was the European Right after the 1984 election, which also {{consisted}} of the <b>Italian</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Movement</b> (MSI), its early inspiration, and the Greek National Political Union. Following the 1989 election, it teamed up with the German Republicans and the Belgian Vlaams Blok in a new European Right group, while the MSI left due to the Germans' arrival. As the MSI evolved into the National Alliance, it chose to distance itself from the FN. From 1999 to 2001, the FN {{was a member of the}} Technical Group of Independents. In 2007, it was part of the short-lived Identity, Tradition, Sovereignty group. Between the mentioned groups, the party sat among the non-affiliated Non-Inscrits. It leads the Europe of Nations and Freedom group, which also includes the Freedom Party of Austria, Polish Congress of the New Right, Italian Northern League, Vlaams Belang, the Alternative for Germany, the Dutch Freedom Party, a former member of the UK Independence Party and a former member of Romania's Conservative Party. They're also part of the Movement for a Europe of Nations and Freedom since 2014.|$|E
5|$|While the ON had {{competed in}} some local {{elections}} since 1970, at its second congress in June 1972 {{it decided to}} establish a new political party to contest the 1973 legislative elections. The party was launched on 5 October 1972 under the name National Front for French Unity (Front national pour l'unité française), or Front National. In order to create a broad movement, the ON sought to model the new party (as it earlier had sought to model itself) on the more established <b>Italian</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Movement</b> (MSI), which at the time appeared to establish a broad coalition for the Italian right. The FN adopted a French version of the MSI tricolour flame as its logo. It wanted to unite the various French far-right currents, and brought together Le Pen's nationalist group, Roger Holeindre's Party of French Unity, Georges Bidault's Justice and Liberty movement, former Poujadists, Algerian War veterans, and some monarchists, among others. Le Pen was chosen to be the first president of the party, as he was untainted with the militant public image of the ON and was a relatively moderate figure on the far-right.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} win the March 1994 general election, Berlusconi formed two {{separate}} electoral alliances: Pole of Freedoms (Polo delle Libertà) with the Lega Nord (Northern League) in northern Italian districts, and another, the Pole of Good Government (Polo del Buon Governo), with the National Alliance (Alleanza Nazionale; heir to the <b>Italian</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Movement)</b> in central and southern regions.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the continuing significance in contemporary Italy of the <b>Italian</b> new <b>social</b> <b>movement</b> of 1973 - 83, Autonomia, by positing it {{as a movement}} of refusal: of capitalist work, of the party form, of the clandestine form of political violence, and {{of the politics of}} `taking power'. It was in discontinuity with the value systems of the reformist Old Left and the revolutionary New Left, but in continuity with contemporary Italian antagonist and global anti-capitalist movements. In defining the research subject, the concept of individual and collective autonomy emerges as a central characteristic of the <b>Italian</b> new <b>social</b> <b>movements.</b> Autonomy is understood not only as independence from the capitalist State and economy and their institutions of mediation, but also as the self-determination of everyday life, related to the needs, desires and subjectivity of what Italian `workerism' defined as the Fordist `mass worker' and the post-Fordist `socialised worker'. Using the `class composition' theoretical perspective of Autonomist Marxism to critique classical Marxism, neo-Marxism and new <b>social</b> <b>movement</b> theory's minimalisation of the political content of new <b>social</b> <b>movements</b> and dismissive analysis of Autonomia, the scope of research was limited to the interpretation of 48 interviews of former participants and observers, of primary texts produced by Autonomia and of secondary accounts based on `collective historical memory'. The thematic framework consists of chapters on workers' autonomy and the refusal of work; forms of political organisation and violence involving `organised', `diffused' and `armed' Autonomia; and on the youth counter-cultures and antagonist communication of `creative Autonomia' and the 1977 Movement. The thesis concludes that Autonomia expressed the violent social conflicts produced by the rapid transformation of an industrial into a post-industrial society, but ultimately was only a partial break from the traditions and practices of the Old and New Lefts, leaving an ambiguous legacy for contemporary <b>Italian</b> autonomous <b>social</b> <b>movements...</b>|$|R
40|$|Debate on the antimafia {{movement}} has placed the phenomenon {{mainly in the}} urban civil society tradition of new <b>Italian</b> <b>social</b> <b>movements.</b> While acknowledging the resonance of antimafia mobilization in this context, this article explores a different tradition, wherein struggles against the mafia in Sicily are analysed alongside, and in constant interconnection with, {{the development of the}} agrarian cooperative movement of the island. Focusing on the Alto Belice area of western Sicily, the article argues that antimafia politics evolved from an association with agricultural workers’ cooperativism in an anti-middleman direction after the 1950 s land reform. Moreover, it assesses ethnographically how this tradition has influenced actors in the contemporary, largely successful, movement of antimafia cooperatives that cultivate land confiscated from the mafia by the Italian state. It examines how these actors link to this genealogy, associating their contemporary activity, in largely imaginary ways, to this history of struggles, and claiming inheritance over it.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{argues that}} class composition, as defined and theorised by Operaismo and Autonomist thinkers, has had both a major and a minoritarian form. In fact class composition in its major form {{has always been}} subtended by a minor current. I examine both historical (the 1905 Russian Soviets, the 1919 Turin factory councils, the <b>Italian</b> <b>social</b> <b>movements</b> of the 1970 s) and contemporary examples (the occupation of Tahrir Square in Egypt, the Indignados movement in Spain, and Occupy Wall Street in 2011, {{as well as the}} 2012 Quebec student strike) of class composition. From these examples I then argue that the minor current of class composition is rooted in social reproduction – both its crisis and its recuperation. And further that this minor current expands throughout history, growing to command greater attention within <b>social</b> and labour <b>movements.</b> Further, this dissertation argues that contemporary <b>social</b> <b>movements</b> appear today as an assemblage, a human-machinic assemblage, which enact social reproduction in crisis and recuperation through both embodied and technologized forms. I demonstrate the ways in which technologies of communication are implicated in forms of securitised and commodified social reproduction, but also open up new and powerful possibilities for autonomous and liberatory social reproduction. This dissertation relies on a merger of conceptual, theoretical, and field research and benefits from the author’s direct involvement in social and political struggles...|$|R
40|$|<b>Social</b> <b>movements</b> {{are also}} {{producers}} of symbolic resources, since they construct new collective identities and provide alternative system of meanings to societies. This was particularly significant {{with regard to}} recent struggles against work insecurity in Italy. There, in a discursive context dominated by the so-called ‘flexibility political mantra’, activists raised their voice {{in order to identify}} a novel social problem, precarity, and a novel social subject, precarious workers. The paper starts from these premises in order to investigate the so-called media sociali, a particular kind of media practice that had been developed by Italian activists involved in the long protest campaign against precarity, namely the Euro Mayday Parade (EMP). Probably, the media sociali are the most evident attempt to construct a fresh imagery based on precarious workers living and working conditions and to provide an alternative cultural grammar able to speak about precarity. The paper gives back the most important mechanism on which the media sociali rests through the living voices of activists involved in their elaboration: the mechanism of political socialization and social networking as well as the mechanism of diffusion and mutual recognition. Moreover, the paper proposes further reflections about the way in which those activists involved in the EMP perceived the media sociali. In doing so, the paper presents different ways of interpreting political conflict in contemporary <b>Italian</b> <b>social</b> <b>movements</b> and argues that the media sociali are an interesting attempt to overcome both mainstream and independent media in the construction of precarious workers’ imagery and political socialization. Interviews with activists and <b>social</b> <b>movement</b> generated documents are the main data source, investigated according to a qualitative analysis approach...|$|R
40|$|The {{political}} movement "Nuova Destra" (ND) – or New Right – {{as it is}} called by the Italian media, has taken shape thanks to the efforts of a group of young people of diverse political provenance, now grouped mainly round the current of the MSI (the <b>Italian</b> neo-fascist <b>Social</b> <b>Movement)</b> guided by Pino Rauti. The ND inherits its ferocious criticism of liberalism and individualism from Julius Evola and Alain de Benoist. By trying to impose its own brand of modernisation all over the world, liberal-democratic society has become the ND's true enemy. In the quest for a middle course between liberalism and the catastrophe of the collectivist regimes, the aim is to overcome old rivalries and abandon the use of tired categorisations such as right and left to address the movements which have emerged since 1968 directly, delegitimising the present party system through combined effort. In its attemps to reconciliate opposites, the ND has often fallen into irremediable contradictions, which have, in turn, induced even the most attentive observers to reach often contrasting interpretations. There can be no doubt though that by rejecting individualism the members of the ND are to be set among the ranks of nostalgic devotees of the closed society...|$|R

2500|$|Although the National Fascist Party was outlawed by {{the postwar}} Constitution of Italy, {{a number of}} {{successor}} neo-fascist parties emerged to carry on its legacy.

2500|$|The term neo-fascism {{refers to}} fascist {{movements}} after World War II.

2500|$|After {{the fall}} of Fascism and {{following}} {{the birth of the}} Republic, the interest of scholars and politicians, and in general of the masses in Italian nationalism was relatively low, mainly because of the connections that it had with Fascism and consequently with the bad memories of World War II. The only notable and active political party who clearly declared Italian nationalism as its main ideology was the <b>Italian</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Movement</b> which became the fourth largest party in Italy by the early 1960s. In these years, Italian nationalism was considered an ideology totally linked to the right-wing political parties and organisations. Nevertheless, two significant events seemed to revitalise Italian nationalism among Italians, the first one in 1953 during the Question of Trieste when the claim of Italy on the full control of the city of Trieste was largely endorsed by most of the Italian society with patriotic demonstrations, the second one in 1985 during the Sigonella crisis between Italy and United States.|$|E

Pius XII stated that the war against communism was a holy war and excommunicated members of the Communist Party. Having decided to encourage the Christian Democrats to consider a political alliance with the Rightist parties as part of an anti-left coalition, he asked the Jesuit, Father Riccardo Lombardi, to speak with de Gasperi to consider such an alliance– an electoral alliance with those even of monarchist and neo-fascist tendencies -including the <b>Italian</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Movement.</b> Adopting a domino theory he warned that, if [...] "the Communists win in Rome, in Italy, it will cast a shadow on the entire world: France would become Communist, and then Spain and then all of Europe'. de Gasperi rejected the idea as politically dangerous to the long term fortunes of a centrist Catholic party.|$|E
