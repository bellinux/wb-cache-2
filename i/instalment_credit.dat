40|$|Demands for {{consumer}} credit have been strong in recent months. Consumers have borrowed for such widely ranging purposes as {{the purchase of}} automobiles and television sets, the financing of educations and vacations, and the payment of taxes and medical expenses. In general, the expansion in consumer credit has paralleled the growth in consumer expenditures and in {{the economy as a}} whole. The growth in <b>instalment</b> <b>credit</b> was particularly vigorous in April, in part because borrowing to pay taxes was larger than usual. The increase exceeded the record set in January, but in percentage terms both January and April ranked below the peak months in 1955 and 1959. The contrast with 1955 is especially striking since that year included 4 months with percentage increases double the size of this April's. By the end of April, <b>instalment</b> <b>credit</b> outstanding had passed the $ 60 billion mark. This represented an increase of $ 6. 4 billion from the same month last year and more than $ 19 billion from the cyclical low in the spring of 1961. Meanwhile noninstalment credit too has continued to expand, {{and at the end of}} April total consumer credit was at a new high of $ 77. 5 billion...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} the author {{identifies}} two related problems in financial modelling. First, {{the problem of}} implementing financial decision theory in practical decision situations and, second, {{the need to develop}} existing managerial financial models. A discussion of organization decision processes indicates possible reasons for the relative failure of management science and financial theory based models in practice and the predominance of accounting based models. This analysis of strategic decision processes suggests key design features for the implementation of financial models. Finally, research orientated models designed using these guidelines are seen as appropriate media for the transfer of knowledge between financial decision theory and financial practice. This is seen as providing a tentative basis for the development of managerial financial models. Throughout the paper the author uses examples from his own experience in model building in <b>instalment</b> <b>credit,</b> and leasing financial intermediaries, i. e. “Finance Houses”...|$|E
40|$|The role {{of mental}} {{accounts}} in consumer credit decision making was investigated. First, in a conversation-based process-tracing study, 96 adults with experience of credit {{were presented with}} minimal descriptions of three <b>instalment</b> <b>credit</b> options in realistic consumer scenarios. They chose a credit option and a repayment plan, but before doing so could request further information. When choosing the source of credit, participants usually sought and compared information on Annual Percentage Rate (APR) or total cost (TC), often using simple decision heuristics. When choosing repayment plans, they frequently asked about, and made trade-oVs between, monthly repayment amounts,TC, and loan duration. Second, in an independent groups experiment, TC and APR information were systematically varied. Participants chose from pairs of repayment plans conficting in loan duration and monthly repayment amount (ND 28). Although APR signifcantly infuenced choice, its effect was substantially moderated by TC information. It was concluded that: (i) although APR is an important attribute for source of credit decisions, TC is more important for repayment plan decisions, since consumers often represent specific credit plans in terms of total mental accounts; (ii) recurrent budget period accounts are used to evaluate monthly repayments and anticipate future goals and hazards...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This study {{analyses}} {{the relationship}} between disaggregated credit extension and financial distress in South Africa. Of particular interest is to isolate the components of disaggregated credit extension that show a strong relationship with the measure of financial distress. The empirical results reveal that aggregate total domestic credit extension is robustly positively correlated with the composite indicator of financial distress, {{while there is a}} mixed relationship between the components of disaggregated credit extension and the composite indicator of financial distress. In particular, the study finds that total domestic <b>credit</b> extension, <b>instalment</b> sale <b>credit,</b> loans and advances to households, investments and total loans and advances are highly correlated with the composite indicator of financial distress. Therefore,the study conjures that these components could be aggregated into a single measure of credit extension that could be usedfor financial stability purposes in South Africa. Keywords.

40|$|Abstract: Financial {{capability}} requires understanding {{measures of}} consumer credit cost {{and using them}} appropriately in credit judgements and decisions. In three studies, UK adults’ understanding and use of credit cost and duration information were investigated from a bounded rationality perspective. Study 1, part of a representative survey of UK adults (N = 1000), found that when presented with annual percentage rate (APR) participants significantly overestimated the total cost (TC) of a 12 -month loan. In Study 2, loan duration and APR were varied in an independent groups experiment (N = 242). Bank customers’ TC estimates were sensitive to both loan duration and APR but TC was again substantially overestimated. Study 3 was an independent groups experiment investigating the effect of APR and TC information on credit decisions (N = 241). APR often influenced decisions between loans varying in duration and monthly repayment, but this effect was moderated by TC information. It was concluded that: (1) people generally misunderstand the relation between APR and TC; and (2) although APR information can have a large effect on credit decisions, its effect is either attenuated or amplified by TC information. The findings are interpreted {{in terms of a}} ‘take the best APR’ heuristic and a dual mental account model of <b>instalment</b> <b>credit.</b> Recommendations for improving credit information provision and financial education are offered...|$|E

40|$|In the Cases C- 585 / 08 Peter Pammer v Reedere Karl Schluter GmbH & Co and C- 144 / 09 Hotel Alpenhof GesmbH v Oliver Heller, the CJEU {{considered}} {{the applicability of}} article 15 (1) (c) of Regulation EC 44 / 2001 (Brussels I) vis-à-vis the use of web sites in commercial communications with consumers domiciled in other Member States. Article 15 of Brussels I contains special rules which determine the jurisdiction of disputes concerning ‘protected’ consumer contracts falling within its scope. Articles 15 (1) (a) and (b) apply where either the contract is subject to an <b>instalment</b> <b>credit</b> arrangement or where the contract is for a loan to finance the sale of goods respectively. These two recent cases were concerned with article 15 (1) (c), itself previously regarded by the Commission as the ‘philosophy of Article 15. ’ The connecting factors in article 15 (1) (c) apply in two situations. The first is where the seller concludes contracts {{as a result of}} commercial activities entered into in the Member State of the consumer's domicile. The alternative applies when a business ‘directs’ its professional or commercial activities to the Member State of the consumer's domicile and a contract is concluded as a consequence of those activities. Article 15 (2) also (currently) provides that a non-EU defendant corporation which has a branch or agency in a Member State that contracts with a consumer may be regarded as domiciled in that Member State. The cases are important as for the first time references were made to the CJEU to specifically consider and interpret {{the extent to which a}} business' web site should be construed as ‘directing [commercial] activities’ towards consumers domiciled in other Member States.

However, in 1916, the use of credit expanded due to the competition between car dealers to match the low price of Ford's Model T. Medium priced car dealers allowed for their customers to pay in several payments over time for their cars. Soon after, the purchase of cars became credit-based in all countries. This method of payment also eventually became used for the purchase of other consumer goods.

40|$|In 1961 Kenya {{embarked}} on a program of agricultural reform called the Million Acre Settlement Scheme providing for the transfer of ownership {{of land in the}} Rift Valley from outgoing white settlers to local farmers. These new settlers were given loans by the Kenya Government {{to cover the cost of}} the purchase of their plots and of certain development inputs. Over course of time most of these farmers have fallen heavily into arrears with repayment of their loans and this problem provides the focus for this study of problems of farmers on the settlement schemes, which has the ultimate objective of making recommendations for improving the present poor rate of repayment. Not unexpectedly overall income was found to be the crucial factor affecting rates of repayment, however the relationship of size of income to rate of repayment is not straightforward as other factors intervene, especially patterns of expenditure, and more importantly perhaps to any solution are those which indirectly affect rates of repayment through their influence on income levels. It was furthermore discovered that some loan <b>instalments</b> are never <b>credited</b> due to poor administration and that the quality of administration permeates many other variables. This is a purely introductory paper since most data is still being analysed and few figures are adduced in support of the main arguments, which should be taken as provisional in nature.

5000|$|The Israel {{bank card}} system is {{somewhat}} confusing to newcomers, comprising {{a blend of}} features taken from different types of cards. What may {{be referred to as}} a credit card, is most likely to be a deferred debit card on an associated bank current account, {{the most common type of}} card in Israel, somewhat like the situation in France, though the term [...] "debit card" [...] is not in common usage. Cards are nearly universally called cartis eshrei (כרטיס אשראי), literally, [...] "credit card", a term which may bely the card's characteristics. Its main feature may be a direct link to a connected bank account (through which they are mostly issued), with the total value of the transactions made on the card being debited from the bank account in full on a regular date once a month, without the option to carry the balance over; indeed certain types of transactions (such as online and/or foreign currency) may be debited directly from the connected bank account at the time of the transaction. Any such limited credit enjoyed is a result of the customer's assets and credibility with the bank, and not granted by the credit card company. The card usually enables immediate ATM cash withdrawals & balance inquiries (as debit cards do), instalment & deferred charge interest free transactions offered by merchants (also applicable in Brazil), interest bearing <b>instalment</b> plans/deferred charge/revolving <b>credit</b> which is transaction specific at the point of sale (though granted by the issuer, hence the interest), and a variety of automated/upon request types of credit schemes including loans, some of which revolve or resemble the extended payment options sometimes offered by charge cards.|$|R
