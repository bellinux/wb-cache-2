5|$|The Texas oil boom, {{sometimes}} called the gusher age, {{was a period of}} dramatic change and <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> U.S. state of Texas during the early 20th century that began with the discovery of a large petroleum reserve near Beaumont, Texas. The find was unprecedented in its size and ushered in an age of rapid regional development and industrialization that has few parallels in U.S. history. Texas quickly became one of the leading oil producing states in the U.S., along with Oklahoma and California; soon the nation overtook the Russian Empire as the top producer of petroleum. By 1940 Texas had come to dominate U.S. production. Some historians even define the beginning of the world's Oil Age as the beginning of this era in Texas.|$|E
5|$|US113 {{follows the}} {{corridor}} of a post road {{established in the}} late 18thcentury to connect the aforementioned towns on the Delmarva Peninsula with Wilmington and Philadelphia. The highway was improved as an all-weather road in the 1910s. In Maryland, the post road was designated {{one of the original}} state roads established by the Maryland State Roads Commission (MDSRC) in 1909. In Delaware, the highway was the Selbyville–Dover portion of the DuPont Highway, a roadway whose construction was a grand philanthropic measure of Thomas Coleman DuPont. The DuPont Highway, which was started by DuPont's company and finished by the Delaware State Highway Department (DSHD), spurred <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tourism and agriculture sectors in southern Delaware. The economic growth resulted in heavy traffic; US113 was widened in both states in the early 1930s and again in the late 1940s. Bypasses of Dover and Pocomoke City were built in the mid-1930s; the bypassed section of highway in Dover became US113Alternate.|$|E
5|$|BART {{ridership}} {{has grown}} rapidly since 2010, mirroring strong <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bay Area. In 2015, {{the system was}} carrying approximately 100,000 more passengers each day than it had five years earlier. High gasoline prices also contributed to growth, pushing ridership to record levels during 2012, with the system recording five record ridership days in September and October 2012. During the fiscal year ending June 30, 2017, BART recorded an average weekday ridership of 423,395, the second-highest in its history, but a 2.3% drop from 2016. Ridership growth began to slow in late 2016, and dropped by 1.7% in October 2016 from the prior year. The line to the San Francisco International Airport lost riders, while ride-sharing services such as Uber and Lyft grew {{by a factor of}} almost six or nearly 500% at the airport during 2014–2016. BART planners believe that competition from Uber and Lyft is reducing overall ridership growth and BART's share of SFO airport transit. Some see the decline in transit use in large U.S. cities as part of a national trend, linked to changes in commute patterns, the fall in gasoline prices since 2014, and competition from the private sector in the form of ride-sharing services.|$|E

5|$|Japan's {{education}} system {{played a central}} part in the country's recovery and rapid <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> decades {{following the end of}} World War II. After World War II, the Fundamental Law of Education and the School Education Law were enacted. The latter law defined the school system that would be in effect for many decades: six years of elementary school, three years of junior high school, three years of high school, and two or four years of university. Starting in April 2016, various schools began the academic year with elementary school and junior high school integrated into one nine-year compulsory schooling program, in hopes to mitigate bullying and truancy; MEXT plans for this approach to be adopted nationwide in the coming years. In Japan, having a strong educational background greatly improves the likelihood of finding a job and earning enough money to support oneself. Highly educated individuals are less affected by unemployment trends as higher levels of educational attainment make an individual more attractive in the workforce. The lifetime earnings also increase with each level of education attained. Furthermore, skills needed in the modern 21st century labor market are becoming more knowledge-based and strong aptitude in science and mathematics are more strong predictors of employment prospects in Japan's highly technological economy.|$|E
