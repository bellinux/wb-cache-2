She served with the Second Division of the Austro-Hungarian Navy's battleships and shelled Senigallia {{as part of the}} {{bombardment}} of the key seaport of Ancona, Italy, during May 1915. However, Allied control of the Strait of Otranto meant that the Austro-Hungarian Navy was, <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>intents</b> <b>and</b> purposes, effectively bottled up in the Adriatic. Nonetheless, the presence of the Zrínyi and other battleships tied down a substantial force of Allied ships.|$|E

50|$|Nirit {{was founded}} on January 19, 1982 and was named after an {{indigenous}} plant, Ridolfia segetum, growing nearby. It expanded twice, once in 1986-1988 and again in 2000. Until 1986 there were only 15 families in temporary buildings, and nowadays it grew to about 240 families. In 2005 a new neighborhood named Nof Hasharon was built adjacent to Nirit.

50|$|Following {{the decline}} of the Mughal power, the region of Deccan saw the rise of Maratha Empire. The Nizam himself saw many invasions by the Marathas in the 1720s, which {{resulted}} in the Nizam paying a regular tax (Chauth) to the Marathas. The major battles fought between the Marathas and the Nizam include Palkhed, Bhopal, Rakshasbhuvan, and Kharda, in all of which the Nizam lost. Following the conquest of Deccan by Bajirao I and the imposition of chauth by him, Nizam remained a tributary of the Marathas <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>intent</b> <b>and</b> purposes.|$|R
5|$|With the Ordos now {{adequately}} fortified, the Mongols avoided {{its walls}} by riding east to invade Datong and Xuanfu (宣府; present-day Xuanhua, Hebei Province), which were two major garrisons guarding {{the corridor to}} Beijing where no walls had been built. The two defence lines of Xuanfu and Datong left by the Northern Qi and the early Ming had deteriorated by this point, and <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>intents</b> <b>and</b> purposes the inner line was the capital's main line of defence.|$|E
5|$|The dam was completed, and Beaver Lake was at {{full height}} by June 1966. <b>For</b> <b>all</b> <b>intents</b> <b>and</b> purposes, Harvey's Monte Ne was gone. However, {{in times of}} drought, some of the {{structures}} become visible again. The lake dropped to its lowest level on January 22, 1977, more than 27feet (8m) below its average depth, and the amphitheater and bridges were visible {{for the first time}} in more than 10 years. Before the water flooded downtown Monte Ne again, the rest of the buildings were either bulldozed or moved to avoid problems for swimmers, boaters, and fishermen. The few bridges that spanned the lagoon and the amphitheater were not demolished.|$|E
5|$|Although {{formally}} {{separate from}} Greek Orthodox and Latin (Catholic) Christians, the Armenians consider their quarter {{to be part}} of the Christian Quarter. The three Christian patriarchates of Jerusalem and the government of Armenia have publicly expressed their opposition to any political division of the two quarters. The central reasons for the existence of a separate Armenian Quarter is the miaphysitism and distinct language and culture of the Armenians, who, unlike the majority of Christians in Jerusalem (also in Israel and Palestine), are neither Arab nor Palestinian. However, <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>intents</b> <b>and</b> purposes, the Armenians living in the Armenian Quarter are considered Palestinians by Israel and the United Nations (UN).

5|$|Production of {{components}} would be split between Breguet and BAC, and the aircraft themselves would be assembled on two production lines; {{one in the}} UK and one in France, To avoid any duplication of work, each aircraft component had only one source. The British light strike/tactical support versions were the most demanding design, requiring supersonic performance, superior avionics, a cutting edge nav/attack system of more accuracy and complexity than the French version, moving map display, laser range-finder and marked-target seeker (LRMTS). As a result, the initial Br.121 design needed a thinner wing, redesigned fuselage, a higher rear cockpit, and after-burning engines. While putting on smiling faces for the public, maintaining {{the illusion of a}} shared design, the British design de facto departed from the French sub-sonic Breguet 121 {{to such a degree that}} it was <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>intents</b> <b>and</b> purposes a new design.|$|E

In a 2009 {{interview}} with QTheMusic.com, Andy Williams stated that, [...] "As Sub Sub we {{never made the}} album {{we thought we were}} all capable of. We'd always been in love with the idea of albums as opposed to just singles - which are cool in their way and suit dance music perfectly but we wanted to stretch ourselves and make a statement with a set of songs. So around 1996 we started writing and recording the songs which would finally become Lost Souls.

25|$|With {{tensions}} rising, a 1986 accord {{negotiated in}} Jabuuti between the Siyad Barre regime of Somalia and Mengistu Haile Miriam of Ethiopia {{to end the}} support of the respective rebellions against their regimes had <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>intent</b> <b>and</b> purposes entailed the dismemberment the SNM. Having lost its Ethiopian sanctuary, as a consequence of this agreement, in May 1988 the SNM waged a historically daring invasion on Togdheer and Northwest regions of Somaliland. With this secretly and meticulously planned attack—a shocking surprise to both Siyad Barre and Mingeste Haile Miriam regimes — SNM fighters easily took Burao (Burco) and Hargeisa (Hargeysa) cities. Although the SNM was finally pushed out of the two cities, the lightning attack proved to be the deathblow of the Siyad Barre regime. The end result being the peaceful transfer of power, in a spirit of unity, at the 1990 SNM Congress — a lasting peace that survives today.|$|R

5000|$|The {{last of the}} Tri-Five Chevrolets {{introduced}} several changes, {{including the}} large tailfins, [...] "twin rocket" [...] hood design, even more chrome, tri-color paint and a choice from no less than seven different V8 engines.

[...] As the horsepower race continued, Chevrolet introduced a new version of their small block, with 283 cubic inches of displacement and 245 horsepower. They also introduced a limited number of Rochester fuel injected 283 engines that produced 283 horsepower, the first production engine to achieve 1 horsepower per cubic inch. [...] <b>For</b> <b>all</b> <b>intent</b> <b>and</b> purposes, this made the 1957 Bel Air a [...] "hot rod", right off the production line. It was available with manual transmission only. The base 265cid engine saw an increase from 170 to 185 horsepower as well. While not as popular as the previous year's offering, Chevrolet still managed to sell 1.5 million cars in 1957.

2500|$|Until the 19th century, {{countries}} {{based their}} systems of length measurement on prototypes, metal bar primary standards, {{such as the}} standard yard in Britain kept at the Houses of Parliament, and the standard toise in France, kept at Paris. These were vulnerable to damage or destruction over the years, {{and because of the}} difficulty of comparing prototypes, the same unit often had different lengths in distant towns, creating opportunities for fraud. [...] During the Enlightenment scientists argued for a length standard that was based on some property of nature that could be determined by measurement, creating an indestructible, universal standard. The period of pendulums could be measured very precisely by timing them with clocks that were set by the stars. A pendulum standard amounted to defining the unit of length by the gravitational force of the Earth, <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>intents</b> constant, <b>and</b> the second, which was defined by the rotation rate of the Earth, also constant. The idea was that anyone, anywhere on Earth, could recreate the standard by constructing a pendulum that swung with the defined period and measuring its length.|$|R
50|$|On 8 December 1539, Philip {{visited the}} court of King Henry VIII of England {{with the hope of}} obtaining the hand of the King's daughter, Lady Mary Tudor.

They met on 17 December in Hertford Castle where he presented her with a gift and kissed her. Such familiarity gave rise to the belief that the two would wed and the majority of the English court expected a wedding within the coming months. However, King Henry did not allow this match to succeed {{due to the fact that}} the Duke was related to queen consort Anne of Cleves (his fourth wife). Surprisingly, given their differing religious views, Lady Mary showed affection towards the Duke, as she kissed him out of court. The duke was later sent back to his land. The plan did not come to fruition. Philip however was not deterred and he visited England three more times, but only once more did he get to see Lady Mary.|$|R
