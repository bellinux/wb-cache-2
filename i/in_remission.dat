40|$|Background: In the past, {{the first}} goal of bipolar {{disorder}} treatment was {{the reduction of}} symptoms of mania or depression, rather than the recovery of social functioning. Recently, {{as a result of}} an increased emphasis on patient needs, the concept of quality of life (QoL) has been brought into the treatment of physical illnesses. Subjects and methods: The purpose of the present study was to examine QoL data in patients with bipolar disorder <b>in</b> clinical <b>remission</b> and to determine the extent of the effects of demographic and clinical data on QoL in these patients. The second aim was to compare the QoL data of these patients to that of patients with schizophrenia <b>in</b> clinical <b>remission</b> and to that of healthy controls. Data were obtained using a QoL questionnaire (Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire, or Q-LES-Q) for 41 bipolar patients <b>in</b> clinical <b>remission.</b> The data were then compared with the data of 40 schizophrenic patients <b>in</b> clinical <b>remission</b> and with 40 healthy controls. Results: There were higher mean scores in most Q-LES-Q summary scales in the bipolar patients than in the schizophrenic patients. There were higher mean scores in the bipolar patients in some summary scales than in the healthy controls. Conclusions: Our results suggest the same or higher subjective QoL in bipolar patients <b>in</b> clinical <b>remission</b> <b>in</b> comparison with healthy controls and higher subjective QoL in bipolar patients <b>in</b> clinical <b>remission</b> than <b>in</b> schizophrenic patients <b>in</b> clinical <b>remission...</b>|$|R
40|$|Aim of {{the work}} To {{highlight}} some criteria of <b>remission</b> <b>in</b> ulcerative colitis, {{to address the issue}} of false remission, and settle a standard index for its detection. Patients and methods Patients with ulcerative colitis <b>in</b> clinical <b>remission</b> were enrolled prospectively and followed for 1 year for evaluation of clinical manifestations, C-reactive protein, fecal calprotectin, and tumor necrosis factor-α, and colonoscopic and microscopic examination for the detection of actual remission, with the exclusion of those who developed clinical relapse during the study. Results Out of 36 patients, we had 11 patients (30. 5 %) with true remission and 25 patients (69. 5 %) with false remission: 19 patients (52. 7 %) <b>in</b> false <b>remission</b> group A with abnormal mucosal healing and six patients (16 %) <b>in</b> false <b>remission</b> group B with high inflammatory markers. There was a significant positive correlation of inflammatory markers with the ulcerative colitis disease activity index in patients with true remission. There was a significant correlation of the ulcerative colitis disease activity index and histological grades <b>in</b> false <b>remission</b> A and a significant correlation of inflammatory markers with histological grades <b>in</b> false <b>remission</b> B. Conclusion About 70 % of our patients with ulcerative colitis <b>in</b> clinical <b>remission</b> had an active disease. Clinical <b>remission</b> <b>in</b> ulcerative colitis can be best expressed as true and false remission depending on histological grading in a revised ulcerative colitis disease activity index.

40|$|Biological {{agents have}} {{originally}} {{been developed to}} treat refractory arthritis, but evidence has been accruing, supporting their use in vasculitis as well. In the large-vessel vasculitides giant cell arteritis and Takayasu arteritis, TNF-α inhibitors have shown some efficacy in patients with relapsing disease. In contrast, in patients with recent onset of giant cell arteritis, TNF-α inhibitors failed to provide a significant benefit over and above that conferred by glucocorticoids alone. More recent, preliminary data suggest a role for the interleukin- 6 receptor antagonist tocilizumab in both resistant and treatment-naïve giant cell arteritis and Takayasu arteritis. Biological agents have also been proposed to treat difficult anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) -associated vasculitis. Uncontrolled observations suggest that the TNF-α inhibitor infliximab might be beneficial in resistant cases. On the contrary, a randomized controlled trial did not show superiority of the recombinant human soluble TNF-α p 75 receptor fusion protein etanercept over placebo <b>in</b> maintaining <b>remission</b> <b>in</b> granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Two randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that the anti-CD 20 monoclonal antibody rituximab was {{as effective as the}} standard-of-care agent cyclophosphamide <b>in</b> inducing <b>remission.</b> <b>In</b> addition, rituximab appeared to be superior to cyclophosphamide <b>in</b> inducing <b>remission</b> <b>in</b> the subset of patients with relapsing disease.

40|$|Shivani Shah, Duvuru Geetha Department of Medicine, Division of Nephrology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA Abstract: Granulomatosis with polyangiitis and {{microscopic}} polyangiitis {{are small}} vessel vasculitides characterized by circulating antineutrophil circulating antibodies. Standard treatment for active severe disease has consisted of cyclophosphamide with glucocorticoids {{with or without}} plasmapheresis, which achieves approximately 75 % sustained remission, but carries significant adverse effects such as malignancy, infertility, leukopenia, and infections. The role of B cells in the pathogenesis of anti-neutrophil circulating antibodies-associated vasculitis has been established, and as such, rituximab, a monoclonal anti-CD 20 antibody, has been studied in treatment of active granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis (induction) and <b>in</b> maintaining <b>remission.</b> Rituximab {{has been shown to}} be effective <b>in</b> inducing <b>remission</b> <b>in</b> several retrospective studies in patients with refractory disease or cyclophosphamide intolerance. The RAVE and RITUXVAS trials demonstrated rituximab is a noninferior alternative to standard cyclophosphamide-based therapy; however, its role in elderly patients and patients with severe renal disease warrants further investigation. Rituximab has been compared with azathioprine for maintaining <b>remission</b> <b>in</b> the MAINRITSAN trial and may be more efficacious <b>in</b> maintaining <b>remission</b> <b>in</b> patients treated with cyclophosphamide induction. Rituximab is not without risks and carries a similar adverse event risk rate as cyclophosphamide in randomized control trials. However, its use can be considered over cyclophosphamide in patients who have relapsing or refractory disease or in young patients seeking to preserve fertility.

40|$|Chronic {{myeloid leukemia}} (CML) {{is a poor}} {{prognostic}} disease which is characterized by Philadelphia chromosome: t (9; 22) (q 34; q 11). The BCR-ABL fusion gene product which is produced by chromosome translocation causes a constitutive active tyrosine kinase, and this enhances proliferation of myeloid hematopoietic lineage cells. Recently, new drug STI 571 (Imatinib) which inhibits signal transduction of BCR-ABL fusion gene product has been developed {{for the treatment of}} CML. By the use of 400 mg per day, hematological <b>remission</b> was obtained <b>in</b> 96 % of newly diagnosed CML patients, major cytological <b>remission</b> <b>in</b> 83 %, and complete cytological <b>remission</b> <b>in</b> 68 %. For patients at an accelerated phase and at blast crisis, 600 mg per day resulted <b>in</b> hematological <b>remission</b> <b>in</b> 71 % and 35 %.

40|$|Background: Conventional parameters, {{including}} Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAl) and colonoscopy {{are limited}} in assessing small bowel Crohn's disease (CD) remission. Recent studies suggest that CD patients in clinical but not endoscopic remission have worse long-term outcomes. Capsule endoscopy (CE) is the most sensitive test to diagnose small bowel CD, however, its role <b>in</b> assessing <b>remission</b> remains undetermined. Aims and methods: The alms {{of this study were}} to report CE findings in small bowel CD patients <b>In</b> clinical <b>remission</b> and compare these findings and faecal biomarker levels with standard clinical assessment tools (CDAl and CAP} <b>in</b> determining <b>remission.</b> Subsequently we assessed whether CE and the faecal biomarkers, calprotectin and S 100 A 12, offered prognostic information about future CD relapses. 44 adult small bowel CD patients <b>in</b> clinical <b>remission</b> (CDAl < 150) were prospectively enrolled and followed for 12 months. CE studies were reported using a Capsule Endoscopy Scoring Index (CESI). CDAl and CAP were measured at baseline and at 3 monthly intervals. Faecal calprotectin and S 100 A 121 evels were obtained at baseline. Results: As assessed by CESI, 61 % of patients <b>in</b> clinical <b>remission</b> had persistent inflammation distributed In the small bowel. Faecal calprotectln and S 100 A 12 levels at baseline were elevated in 52 % and 36 % of patients, respectively. Calprotectin levels were normal in all patients without inflammation and elevated In all those with moderate-severe inflammation. CESI and baseline calprotectin and S 100 A 12 levels were significantly correlated, while there was no correlation between CESI and either CDAI or CAP. All patients who had a clinical flare during 12 months followup, had mucosal inflammation at baseline CE and 75 % had elevated baseline calprotectin levels. Interestingly, 63 % of patients who had CE evidence of mucosal inflammation remained <b>in</b> clinical <b>remission</b> during the 12 -month followup period. Conclusion: In conclusion, in small bowel CD patients assessed <b>in</b> clinical <b>remission,</b> a significant proportion have ongoing mucosal inflammation on CE. Mucosal Inflammation significantly correlates with faecal calprotectin and S 100 A 12 levels. However, only a minority of these patients develop clinical relapse at least In the medium term.
