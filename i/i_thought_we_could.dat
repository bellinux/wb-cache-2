On leaving, Joshua Topolsky, former Editor-in-chief, is quoted having said, “We have been working on blogging technology that was developed in 2003, we haven’t made a hire since I started running the site, and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> be more successful elsewhere”.|$|E
500|$|Hugh Syme {{provided}} the artwork for Octavarium. The idea of depicting a giant Newton's cradle was {{born out of}} discussions between Syme and Portnoy. The two talked about how [...] "for everything you do in music you create either a cluster or triad", according to Syme. [...] "And then it became evident that for every action there is an opposite reaction. So <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> do something based on the Newton's cradle." [...] There are numerous references to the numbers five and eight throughout the artwork, alluding to the album's concept. For example, the Newton's cradle has eight suspended balls, and there are five birds on the cover. The album booklet features an octagonal maze, spider and octopus, among other references. The landscape on the cover is made up of a sky and grass from Indiana, and a background from the Lake District.|$|E
500|$|Gunn {{appointed}} a backroom staff of former Norwich colleagues, making Ian Crook first-team coach and John Deehan chief scout. However, the initial turnaround in form {{could not be}} maintained; having lost their last three games of the season, Norwich were relegated from the Championship. Gunn labelled his players as an [...] "embarrassment" [...] after the 4–2 defeat to Charlton Athletic that sealed relegation to League One. Despite relegation to the third tier of English football {{for the first time}} in nearly 50 years, Writing in Tales from the City, Gunn said of the match [...] "Even going to Charlton on the last day, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> survive… We lost 4-2 and were relegated to the third tier. I was shell-shocked; the emptiest I have ever felt in a sporting or professional context. The directors went on the field to face the fans and to thank them for their support and I had tears in my eyes when I saw Delia and Michael doing that. I told them how sorry I was." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{writing process}} {{consumed}} approximately six months, including three months creating notes and analyzing the novel. Zaillian noted that as time progressed, the writing accelerated. [...] "As {{soon as you}} start making decisions," [...] he explained, [...] "you start cutting off {{all of the other}} possibilities of things that could happen. [...] So with every decision that you make you are removing a whole bunch of other possibilities of where that story can go or what that character can do." [...] Given the book's sizable length, Zaillian deleted elements to match Fincher's desired running time. Even so, Zaillan took significant departures from the book. To Zaillian, there was always a [...] "low-grade" [...] anxiety, [...] "but I was never doing anything specifically to please or displease," [...] he continued. [...] "I was simply trying to tell the story the best way I could, and push that out of my mind. I didn't change anything {{just for the sake of}} changing it. There's a lot right about the book, but that part, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> do it a different way, and it could be a nice surprise for the people that have read it." ...|$|E
500|$|The film {{originally}} {{had a different}} ending to the one later released in America under the title Shades of Fear. Miramax co-founder Harvey Weinstein requested that the ending be reworked prior to distribution, and Winterson was highly unhappy at being asked to write an additional conclusionary scene. Winterson's preferred ending sees Rex Goodyear burn the painting he believes to be fraudulent, only to discover he actually had the genuine item in his possession all along, and has now destroyed it. This ties in with the major theme of the film in Winterson's eyes, whereby [...] "Duncan, Gabriel, Miss Bead and Miss Quim all find something valuable where they least expected it, Rex Goodyear finds that the things we value are very often worthless." [...] Winterson has called Weinstein [...] "a bully who knows the gentle touch", referring to the new ending as [...] "the most expensive words I will ever write". While she believes that the new ending is satisfying, she feels the film has lost some dimensions which were important to her and concludes: [...] "It is a good movie {{but it is not}} the movie <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> make. [...] I do like Great Moments but there is another film in there somewhere that has got lost." ...|$|E
500|$|Elliot Barker, {{the head}} of Oak Ridge's {{therapeutic}} division, had already interviewed Lamb in 1966 and spoken on his behalf at his trial. The doctor had arrived at Penetanguishene in 1959, and in 1965 stepped up his efforts to reform the unit's programmes, which on his arrival were still based around the traditional methods of neuroleptic tranquillisation and electroconvulsive therapy, supplemented by long periods of isolation for each inmate. Barker innovated a programme whereby the patients could spend more {{of their time in}} each other's company, in a more natural environment; he believed that the key to overcoming these illnesses was communication. [...] "My original vision," [...] he writes, [...] "was that I wasn't really dealing with patients. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> evolve a social structure where people could resolve the internal conflicts in community." [...] Barker's [...] "Social Therapy Unit" [...] (STU), initially made up exclusively of young male psychopaths and schizophrenics of normal intelligence, began in September 1965, with a programme of 80 hours of treatment a week, focussing on cures brought about by mutual cooperation and interaction. Joan Hollobon, the medical editor of the Toronto Globe and Mail, volunteered in 1967 to spend two days at Oak Ridge {{as if she were a}} patient, and afterwards heaped praise on the inmates, saying that they were [...] "pioneering a brave and exciting experiment in self-government and self-therapy ... individual responsibility, co-operation with colleagues and authority, and acceptance of rules reached by consensus." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "That's what I don't just know," [...] Seth replied, {{after a short}} pause. [...] "Pip Smith, he {{said the}} country was a terrible nice place to live in, an' when Snip an' I had to come away, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> perhaps <b>we</b> <b>could</b> find a chance to earn some money." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because," [...] {{answered}} Wulf, [...] "we {{were not}} sure that the news was true, and did not wish to bring false tidings and be made foolish.

500|$|The {{idea of a}} {{new album}} came back in 2010, as {{frontman}} Dave Grohl was touring Australia with Them Crooked Vultures. Grohl decided that [...] "we should make a documentary about the recording of this new album {{and make it a}} history of the band too. Rather than just record the album in the most expensive studio with the most state-of-the-art equipment, what if Butch and I were to get back together after 20 years and dust off the tape machines and put them in my garage?" [...] Grohl later elaborated that Vig was brought in so the record could be [...] "that one album that kinda defines the band: it might not be their best album, but it's the one people identify the band with the most, like Back In Black or the Metallica Black Album. It's like you take {{all of the things that}} people consider your band's signature characteristics and just amplify them and make one simple album with that. And that's sorta what <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> do with Butch, because Butch has a great way of trimming all the fat and making sense of it all." [...] Grohl also used the tour with the Vultures to turn song ideas into demos, which were then brought to drummer Taylor Hawkins to be further developed. The album would also mark the return of guitarist Pat Smear as a permanent member; Smear left the Foo Fighters after the release of The Colour and the Shape, but had been part of the touring band since 2006.|$|E
2500|$|After {{several years}} in Laredo, Tatangelo became active in local politics. He {{considered}} himself a Democrat, but, as an independent businessman, he was more pragmatic than partisan. [...] "I had a summer house in Zapata (also Zapata County) and learned {{that they had a}} fire station manned by volunteers. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> have that in Laredo," [...] he told The Laredo Morning Times. He recruited thirty-nine volunteers, and in 1973, a fire station was built on Del Mar Boulevard across from St. Patrick's Catholic Church.|$|E
2500|$|There were {{plans in}} 1991 {{to bring back}} the {{original}} Death's Head, which would have featured the character on trial and facing the death penalty, and flashing back to how he'd got there. Early into production the new editor Paul Neary scrapped it and commissioned Death's Head II instead: replacing the character with a new version, created by Dan Abnett, Andy Lanning, and Liam Sharp. In an autumn 1992 interview with Comic World, Neary was dismissive about the original character and the aborted : [...] "I didn't like the pages that had been produced - I didn't think there was much future in Transformers-style robots and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> do an awful lot better." [...] He produced some sample sketches of how he wanted the character to look,and Liam Sharp's take gave the project [...] "a kickstart". Ironically, the success of Death's Head II meant Neary was ordered to create more titles and the easiest way was to reprint the original series ("The Incomplete Death's Head"); editor John Freeman had to talk him into it.|$|E
6000|$|... "To be sure. If those goats {{can pull}} wagons, they can {{certainly}} pull sleds, too.

6000|$|... "I {{asked you}} to lunch at the club, Deane," [...] said Lord Nunneley, [...] "because <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> talk here without being interrupted. If you came to Cavendish Square, Olive would walk you right away from the table, and if I asked to have a chat with you alone, {{there would be a}} perfect {{avalanche}} of questions to face." ...|$|R
2500|$|In {{discussing}} {{adapting the}} Boris Pasternak novel for television, screenwriter Andrew Davies revealed {{the task was}} [...] "daunting because the book is reckoned to be a masterpiece and the film is a great movie and one that I admire very much. Robert Bolt is the king of epic screenplay writers in my book. But as I got further into the book I kept thinking that I didn't agree with Robert Bolt about how to tell the story... and I began to feel much more excited." [...] He added, [...] "It was also a relief to find {{so much in the}} book that hadn't found its way into the first movie and could make great drama.... I thought the film does the spectacle really well. Rather surprisingly, it also explains the politics very well, but I thought it could do a better job on the relationships. It's probably a bit controversial, but <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> say more about Lara and Yuri and how they get together; about Lara's extraordinary situation {{at the beginning of the}} story and Yuri having a dreadful start to his life with his parents dying. None of these things really came out in the movie, but they are there in the book. I think that if they look at both versions now, people will probably think that this version in a lot of ways works better for our time. It's more contemporary. I think they'll find the performances are more subtle yet speak to us in our time. Maybe my script will seem out of date in 20 years time because a lot of them do, but watching the original film, I think the central performances look stilted and dated now." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Some caution's necessary," [...] Stannard remarked. [...] "You {{got a very}} nasty {{shake and}} ran worse risks than you knew. When you stopped in the bank of gravel your luck was remarkably good; I did not expect you to stop until you reached the glacier. Then, had I not had a thick coat that helped to keep you warm, {{you might not have}} survived the shock. Afterwards much {{depended}} on Deering's speed and his getting men who knew the rocks.

5000|$|Blade Runner {{might not}} have done well financially when it first came out, but people are still talking about {{it because it was}} infused with all these big ideas. Scott was also talking about very big themes in Prometheus. It was being driven by people who wanted the answers to huge questions. But <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> do that without ever getting too pretentious. Nobody wants to see a movie where people are {{floating}} in space talking about the meaning of life ... That was already present in Spaihts's original script and Scott just wanted to bring it up more.|$|R
5000|$|After {{the success}} of Child's cookbook, Jones {{continued}} to expand the resource options for American home cooks. [...] "I got so excited by Julia's book and what it did for making people better cooks, and the tools that you needed to make it really work in an American city or small town, and <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> If <b>we</b> <b>could</b> do this for French food, for heavens' sake, let's start doing it for other exotic cuisines!" [...] Jones recalled. [...] "I used the word [...] "exotic," [...] and that meant the Middle East with Claudia Roden, it meant better Indian cooking with Madhur Jaffrey." ...|$|R

5000|$|In 1960 Garland was {{promoted}} from feature editor to women's {{editor of the}} magazine, but a financial recession in Chicago, declining circulation of the Courier and increasing coverage of black issues in mainstream newspapers had led to serious financial problems at the paper. In spite of bouncing pay checks, Garland continued writing for the paper. She commented [...] "I loved the Courier. It was everything to me.

60|$|We took twenty as stout fellows {{with us as}} any in the ship, {{besides the}} {{supercargo}} and myself, and we landed two hours before midnight, {{at the same place}} where the Indians stood drawn up in the evening before.

60|$|As to me, I {{was always}} {{steadily}} of opinion that this disorder {{was not in}} its nature intermittent. I conceived that the contest, once begun, could not be laid down again, to be resumed at our discretion, but that our first struggle with this evil would also be our last. <b>I</b> never <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> make peace with the system; {{because it was not}} for the sake of an object we pursued in rivalry with each other, but with the system itself that we were at war.
