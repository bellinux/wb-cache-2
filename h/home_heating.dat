5|$|Geothermal {{power is}} cost-effective, reliable, sustainable, and {{environmentally}} friendly, but {{has historically been}} limited to areas near tectonic plate boundaries. Recent technological advances have dramatically expanded the range and size of viable resources, especially for applications such as <b>home</b> <b>heating,</b> opening a potential for widespread exploitation. Geothermal wells release greenhouse gases trapped deep within the earth, but these emissions are much lower per energy unit than those of fossil fuels.|$|E
5|$|Lower {{temperature}} sources {{produce the}} energy equivalent of 100M BBL per year. Sources with temperatures of 30–150°C are used without conversion to electricity as district heating, greenhouses, fisheries, mineral recovery, industrial process heating and bathing in 75 countries. Heat pumps extract energy from shallow sources at 10–20°C in 43 countries {{for use in}} space heating and cooling. <b>Home</b> <b>heating</b> is the fastest-growing means of exploiting geothermal energy, with global annual growth rate of 30% in 2005 and 20% in 2012.|$|E
5|$|A {{geothermal}} heat pump can extract enough heat from shallow ground {{anywhere in the}} world to provide <b>home</b> <b>heating,</b> but industrial applications need the higher temperatures of deep resources. The thermal efficiency and profitability of electricity generation is particularly sensitive to temperature. The most demanding applications receive the greatest benefit from a high natural heat flux, ideally from using a hot spring. The next best option is to drill a well into a hot aquifer. If no adequate aquifer is available, an artificial one may be built by injecting water to hydraulically fracture the bedrock. This last approach is called hot dry rock geothermal energy in Europe, or enhanced geothermal systems in North America. Much greater potential may be available from this approach than from conventional tapping of natural aquifers.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{warnings}} from Noseworthy to control spending, Dunderdale's first budget saw spending increase by 4.9 percent. Spending {{was focused on}} infrastructure, health care, social programs, Nalcor Energy {{as well as other}} areas. The budget included tax credits for child care, volunteer fire fighters as well as an 8 percent Residential Energy Rebate on <b>home</b> <b>heating</b> fuel, which is equal to the provincial portion of the Harmonized Sales Tax (HST). The budget raised the threshold on the payroll tax exemption from $1 million to $1.2 million. Despite a $598 million surplus for the previous year and a $59 surplus forecasted for the coming year, the province's net debt was expected to increase from $8.2 billion to $8.67 billion due to unfunded liabilities. However, on November 16, 2011, Dunderdale's government released their Fall economic update and announced that the surplus for the 2011-2012, fiscal year was now projected to be $755.8 million, with the added surplus going towards the debt. In the audited financial statements released in January 2013, the surplus for the 2011-2012 was $882.8 million, with the overall debt falling to $7.8 billion.|$|E

50|$|A {{kerosene}} heater, {{also known}} as a paraffin heater, is typically a portable, unvented, kerosene-fueled, space (i.e. convectional) heating device. In Japan and other countries, they are a primary source of <b>home</b> <b>heat.</b> In the United States and Australia, they are a supplemental heat or a source of emergency heat during a power outage. Most kerosene heaters produce between 3.3 and 6.8 kW (11000 to 23000 BTU per hour).|$|R

25|$|Coal {{displaced}} wood {{during the}} mid-nineteenth century. In 1840 wood {{was the major}} fuel while coal production was minor. In 1850 wood was 90% of fuel consumption and 90% of that was for <b>home</b> <b>heating.</b> By 1880 wood was only 5% of fuel consumption. Cast iron stoves for heating and cooking displaced inefficient fireplaces.|$|E
25|$|Economically, {{electric}} heat can {{be compared}} to other sources of <b>home</b> <b>heating</b> by multiplying the local cost per kilowatt hour for electricity by the number of kilowatts the heater uses. E.g.: 1500-watt heater at 12 cents per kilowatt hour 1.5×12=18 cents per hour. When comparing to burning fuel it may be useful to convert kilowatt hours to BTUs: 1.5kWh × 3412.142=5118 BTU.|$|E
25|$|Although {{insulation}} {{standards have}} been increasing, {{so has the}} standard of <b>home</b> <b>heating.</b> In 1970, only 31% of homes had central heating. By 2003 it had been installed in 92% of British homes, leading in turn to {{a rise in the}} average temperature within them (from 12.1°C to 18.20°C). Even in homes with central heating, average temperatures rose 4.55°C during this period.|$|E
25|$|They {{ended the}} season with an {{impressive}} record of 20–20, finishing 5th {{in the league and}} qualifying for the post-season Play-offs, a remarkable achievement for the new team.

However the opposition in the Semi-finals, the all-conquering Newcastle Eagles proved too much and Heat succumbed to a 115–97 defeat.

50|$|Homeowners can get 90% {{efficiency}} using {{natural gas}} to <b>heat</b> their <b>home.</b> <b>Heat</b> pumps are very efficient and burn no natural gas, shifting the environmental impacts from homeowners to electric utilities. Switching from {{natural gas to}} electricity in Alberta Canada burns natural gas and coal at about a 40% efficiency to supply the heat pump. In Quebec Canada where electric resistance heating is common, the heat pump will use 70% less hydroelectricity. Heat pumps may be beneficial for the environment or not, it depends how your region generates electricity.|$|R
50|$|In {{the high}} villages {{people live in}} homes built {{according}} to medieval designs that withstand cold winters. The kitchen is separated from the living area (called the stube, {{the area of the}} <b>home</b> <b>heated</b> by a stove), and second-floor bedrooms benefit from rising heat. The typical Swiss chalet originated in the Bernese Oberland. Chalets often face south or downhill, and are built of solid wood, with a steeply gabled roof to allow accumulated snow to slide off easily. Stairs leading to upper levels are sometimes built on the outside, and balconies are sometimes enclosed.|$|R
25|$|New Hampshire's {{residential}} {{electricity use}} is low {{compared with the}} national average, in part because demand for air conditioning is low during the generally mild summer months and because few households use electricity as their primary energy source for <b>home</b> <b>heating.</b> Over half of New Hampshire households use fuel oil for winter heating. New Hampshire has potential for renewable energies like wind power, hydroelectricity, and wood fuel.|$|E
25|$|Part of {{the decline}} in prices and {{economic}} and geopolitical power of OPEC came from the move to alternate energy sources. OPEC had relied on price inelasticity to maintain high consumption, but had underestimated the extent to which conservation and other sources of supply would eventually reduce demand. Electricity generation from nuclear power and natural gas, <b>home</b> <b>heating</b> from natural gas, and ethanol-blended gasoline all reduced the demand for oil.|$|E

50|$|Propane is {{a popular}} choice for {{barbecues}} and portable stoves because the low boiling point of -42 C makes it vaporize {{as soon as it}} is released from its pressurized container. Therefore, no carburetor or other vaporizing device is required; a simple metering nozzle suffices. Propane powers some locomotives, buses, forklifts, taxis, outboard boat motors, and ice resurfacing machines and is used for heat and cooking in recreational vehicles and campers. Since it can be transported easily, it {{is a popular}} fuel for <b>home</b> <b>heat</b> and backup electrical generation in sparsely populated areas that do not have natural gas pipelines.|$|R
