30|$|Another set of {{recommendations}} {{for reducing the}} number of dropouts is focused on the need to improve the process of assigning students to training programs that line up with their interests and needs. In this respect, it is suggested that greater effort should be made to guarantee that students have access to the courses that they chose as their first option (Azzarano, 1981) and that students have a previous <b>interest,</b> <b>bond,</b> or experience with the professions for which they will be trained (Diamond, 2007; Elffers, Oort, and Karsten, 2012). It is also recommended that the teaching staff take a more central role, not only in the design and implementation of the training programs, but also in the selection of students (Langley, 1993) even though some authors recommend increasing available resources and contracting people specifically in charge of identifying students’ needs, interests, and abilities in order to guide them toward programs and courses that are suited to their characteristics (Cummins, 1973; Beekhoven and Dekkers, 2004; Diamond, 2007; Mohd Kamalludeen, 2012).|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{presence}} of depositor discipline in the U. S. banking sector. We test whether depositors penalize (discipline) banks for poor performance by withdrawing their uninsured deposits. While focusing on the movements in uninsured deposits, we also account {{for the possibility that}} banks may be forced to pay a risk premium in the form of higher interest rates to induce depositors not to withdraw their uninsured deposits. Our results support the existence of depositor discipline: a weak bank may not necessarily be able to stop a deposit drain by raising its uninsured deposit interest rates.

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} revive the case for {{countries}} to self-insure against economic growth slowdowns by issuing GDP-indexed bonds. We simulate the effects of GDP-indexed bonds under different assumptions about fiscal policy reaction functions and their output effects and find that they could substantially reduce the likelihood that debt/GDP paths become explosive. The insurance premium would likely be small, because cross-country comovement of GDP growth rates is low and cross-country GDP growth risk is thus largely diversifiable for an investor holding a portfolio of GDP-indexed bonds. Potential obstacles {{to the emergence of}} a market for these bonds include the verifiability of GDP data, the trade-off between insurance and moral hazard, and the need for liquidity.

Post-crisis GDP contractions are mainly accounted for by declines in investment and inventory and are more severe for emerging market countries. Post-crisis investment and inventory declines are correlated with the corporate debtequity ratio. Although companies in emerging market countries hold more liquidity, this is not sufficient to prevent a greater response of expenditures to shocks.

From 1970 - 2000, returns averaged 9 percent per annum, {{about the same}} as returns on a ten-year U. S. treasury bond. This reflects the combined effect of the 1980 s debt crisis and much higher returns during 1989 - 2000. Annual returns since 1986 have been less volatile than emerging market equity returns but more volatile than returns on U. S. corporate or high-yield bonds.

40|$|How {{to account}} for <b>interest</b> on <b>bonds</b> in a system as {{integrated}} as the System of National Accounts 1993 (1993 SNA) {{has been a source}} of much controversy. Two main positions emerge: the debtor treatment based on the contractual arrangements of the bonds; and the creditor treatment based on current interest rates and prices of assets/liabilities. Using the discounted cash flow model, this paper explores the treatment of income and other benefits from assets in the 1993 SNA. It finds that the debtor approach to <b>bond</b> <b>interest</b> conforms with the 1993 SNA recording income and other benefits from assets, as that approach captures the results of effective decision making between institutional units.

It is possible for money demand to increase when <b>bond</b> <b>interest</b> rates are rising if one’s perception is of a declining total return. We study the liquidity demand behavior of a group of bond fund portfolio managers, for whom the perceived total return is paramount, and find evidence of a positive relationship between <b>bond</b> <b>interest</b> rates, the standard proxy for the opportunity cost of money, and the demand for cash balances.
