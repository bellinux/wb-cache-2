It was produced by John Fields and Scott Faircloff. In an interview with Alternative Addiction, Wade said, [...] "Broken is the song that moves me the most. I wrote it in Nashville, about 6 months ago. I was in my hotel room at 3 AM, I was out there visiting a friend... he’s really sick, he needs a kidney transplant." [...] Furthermore, he said, [...] "That [...] song just kinda fell <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>lap,</b> and I really haven’t written a song like that since 'Hanging by a Moment' where it just happened within a 15 minute time period." [...] Broken was released as the third single from the album on June 18, 2007. The song was then edited for radio to give it more of a [...] "rock" [...] feel and was released via digital download on July 8, 2008.|$|E

When Claudius decided to marry her, he persuaded a group of senators that the marriage should be arranged in the public interest. In Roman society, an uncle (Claudius) marrying his niece (Agrippina) was considered incestuous, and obviously immoral.|$|E

2500|$|In {{an article}} in The New York Times in September 2013, Kenneth Leedom, an {{assistant}} of Horowitz for five years before 1955, laid claim to having been in a closeted relationship with him as his lover, saying, [...] "We had a wonderful life together...He was a difficult man, to say the least. He had an anger in him that was unbelievable. The number of meals I've had thrown on the floor or <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>lap.</b> He'd pick up the tablecloth and just pull it off the table, and all the food would go flying. He had tantrums, a lot. But then he was calm and sweet. Very sweet, very lovable. And he really adored me." ...|$|E

It fell into the hopper, where they had a dozen or more translators and stenographers with nothing else to do. They picked up Trotsky's document, translated it and distributed it to the heads of the delegations {{and the members of the}} program commission. So, lo and behold, it was laid <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>lap,</b> translated into English! Maurice Spector, a delegate from the Canadian Party, and in somewhat the same frame of mind as myself, was also on the program commission and he got a copy. We let the caucus meetings and the Congress sessions go to the devil while we read and studied this document. Then I knew what I had to do and so did he. Our doubts had been resolved... We made a compact there and then — Spector and I — that we would come back home and begin a struggle under the banner of Trotskyism." ...|$|E
5000|$|Judging by his letters, {{the king}} had a great ability to whine {{whenever}} he felt insulted; shortly after Shamshi-Adad's death, tension between Išḫi-Addu and the Assyrian king's eldest son Ishme-Dagan I occurred. The king of Assyria asked for two horses from Qatna, {{and it seems that}} Išḫi-Addu asked for something in return, but Ishme-Dagan sent a small amount of the horses real value and seems to not have met Išḫi-Addu's request causing the latter to write an angry message, which was apparently intercepted in Mari by Yasmah-Adad who had interest in keeping his brother and father in law at peace. His letters concerning his daughter also reveal a man capable of compassion; he wrote Yasmah-Adad: [...] "I am placing <b>in</b> your <b>lap</b> <b>my</b> flesh and my future. Your maid i have given you, may god prove her attractive to you. I am placing <b>in</b> your <b>lap</b> <b>my</b> flesh and my future, for this throne ('house') has now become yours and Mari's has now become mine".|$|R

I recall the melodic sounds of her voice as her intonations matched the characters and adventures tak ing place in the story. Her roar or cackle would put me a place and time where my imagination was everything. In these intimate moments, my love of literacy blossomed. Fast-forward to my career as a public school high school English teacher. I read the likes of Oliver Twist with a passionate, albeit sub-par British accent, proclaimed the beauty of iambic pentameter during Shakespeare units, and often was cast as all the characters in dramas such as Othello, but I aAlthough my love of literacy and 	 did it all with love and respect the fond memories it evokes help for literacy. ...|$|R
