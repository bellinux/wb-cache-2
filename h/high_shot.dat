25|$|Hasek roll: The Hasek roll is a desperation {{maneuver}} {{named after}} Czech goaltender Dominik Hašek. In the stacked pad stance {{the lower part}} of the net is protected very well, but the upper third is completely open. In a last-ditch effort to block an incoming <b>high</b> <b>shot</b> the goaltender can roll around his upper back, flailing his pads through the air and stacking them on the other side. If the timing is right the goalie might get his leg up just in time to make the save.|$|E
25|$|Eight {{minutes into}} the second half, a high tackle by Justin Hodges on Cameron Smith close to the Broncos' line {{resulted}} in a minor scuffle and a penalty to the Storm. Melbourne captain Smith {{decided to take the}} tap and attack Brisbane's line and a close-range try to Matt King resulted. The scores were then level at 8-all, with the kick to come. Smith, also the Storm's first-choice goal-kicker, was having a problem with his kicking leg so the task fell onto Matt Geyer whose conversion attempt went wide. Ten minutes later a penalty was awarded to the Broncos after a <b>high</b> <b>shot</b> from Billy Slater on Shaun Berrigan and Corey Parker's kick was successful, giving his side a two-point lead at 10-8. Following the restart kick from Melbourne, Brisbane were working the ball out of their own half and on the fifth tackle scored a brilliant Grand Final try. From dummy-half Berrigan ran then passed back inside to Lockyer who gave a short ball on to Parker who did likewise for Casey McGuire. Before being tackled McGuire tossed the ball blindly back over his head and it was picked up by Lockyer who spun out of a tackle then passed it to Tonie Carroll. Without losing momentum, Carroll passed the ball on to a flying Brent Tate who raced to the corner for the try. The conversion attempt from near the sideline was missed by Parker so the Broncos led by six with seventeen minutes of play remaining. A couple of minutes later the Storm appeared to have scored their third try when a bomb by Cronk was leapt for but unsuccessfully taken by both a Brisbane and a Melbourne player. On its way down the ball was snatched from the air by King who looked to have put it down for his second try but the video referee ruled that the ball had gone forward off the Storm so it was disallowed. In the seventy-third minute, after a strong run by prop Shane Webcke (the oldest player on the field) put him in good field position, Lockyer snapped away a successful field goal. This gave the Broncos a 7-point buffer. A frustrated Melbourne side were unable to score in the remaining minutes as Brisbane ground their way towards full-time, the score 15-8 at the final siren.|$|E
25|$|England won {{the coin}} toss and Australia's Andrew Johns {{kicked off the}} match. In England's first set with the ball Australia were penalised for their skipper Brad Fittler's high tackle on Andrew Farrell. From the {{resulting}} good field position England were able to force a line drop-out and get another set of six in Australia's half of the field. At {{the end of the}} set, Radlinski put up a high kick, which Australia's fullback Tim Brasher failed to secure and Australia were penalised for regathering the ball when off-side. Bobbie Goulding kicked the penalty goal from fifteen metres out, giving his side a 2 – 0 lead. From Australia's resulting kick-off, the English players couldn't secure the ball and it was regathered by the Kangaroos deep in the opposition half. On the last tackle of the ensuing set, Johns at first receiver put a chip kick into the left-hand corner of England's in-goal area where winger Rod Wishart dived in and got a hand on it, giving Australia the first try of the match in the seventh minute. Johns then converted the try from the touch-line and the Kangaroos were leading 2 – 6. A few minutes later England were penalised around the centre of the field and Johns attempted the kick at goal but missed. With the game now swinging from end to end, Johns conceded a penalty close to the goal posts and Goulding's kick bounced off the uprights but went in, so England were trailing 4 – 6 by the eighteenth minute. A few minutes later England conceded a penalty in front of their goal posts and Johns kicked Australia to a 4 – 8 lead. Shortly after that England winger Martin Offiah made a break down along the left sideline and was contentiously ruled to have been taken over the sideline by a desperate Tim Brasher tackle as he threw the ball back into the field for Paul Newlove to toe ahead and dive on, though television replays suggested that Offiah had managed to release the ball before he went into touch. After a <b>high</b> <b>shot</b> from Andy Farrell on Mark Carroll, Johns kicked another penalty giving Australia a 4 – 10 lead at the thirty-minute mark. Just before the half-time break England conceded another penalty in the ruck but Johns' kick missed so the score remained unchanged at the break.|$|E

2500|$|The {{regular season}} opened on October7 with a two-game series against visiting American International. Pearson sought {{to improve the}} team's {{defensive}} zone coverage in practices before the series, but starting goaltender Kevin Genoe gave up three goals {{in the first period}} while his Yellow Jackets counterpart, Ben Meisner, stopped all eight Huskies shots. The Huskies' comeback began late in the second period when Blake Pietila's pass deflected off a defender's skate past Meisner. In the third period, goals from Pietila, Steven Seigo and Jordan Baker completed Michigan Tech's 5–3 comeback win. Genoe stopped all 14shots he faced in the final two periods. In the following night's rematch, Robinson started at goaltender and the Huskies scored first after Riley Sweeney's pass sent Brett Olson on a shorthanded breakaway and Meisner failed to stop Olson's <b>high</b> <b>shot.</b> The Yellow Jackets, however, tied the game 31seconds later while the Huskies were still shorthanded. Pearson had inserted Mikael Lickteig in the lineup for this game, hoping his speed would be beneficial, and it paid off when Lickteig created a scoring chance for himself that Meisner stopped, but Jacob Johnstone scored on the rebound. In the second period, Johnstone found a loose puck immediately in front of Meisner and made [...] "three quick stick-handling moves for a highlight-reel goal", and the Huskies won 3–1. Robinson stopped 32 of 33shots, and Pearson called him [...] "the difference in the game". The series sweep was the Huskies' first since December19–20, 2008, against Northern Michigan. Pietila was named Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA) Rookie of the Week for his two-goal performance in the series' first game.|$|E
2500|$|On the {{recommendation}} of an MCC committee member in Australia the tour selectors had decided to demote Len Hutton – the best opener in the world – to bat at number 5 {{so that he could}} stiffen the fragile lower order. This was possible as they had two other openers in Cyril Washbrook and Reg Simpson and Hutton declined to object as he was outvoted and didn't want to appear obstinate. The two new openers went out to the middle on the first day, but Simpson successfully appealed for bad light and no ball was bowled. It rained on the Saturday morning and though it dried out on the rest day that followed more rain poured down overnight and play was suspended until the Monday afternoon. Keith Miller and Denis Compton took advantage of the situation by going to the local horse racing track, ringing the ground to check when play was to resume and dashing back just in time. Although other First Class games had their pitches covered they were not for Test matches – a ruling that would change {{as a result of what}} was to follow. The pitch was reduced to a [...] "mudheap", [...] "sticky dog" [...] or [...] "glue-pot" [...] so beloved by purists as only a batsman with classic technique could hope to play on it, in other words Len Hutton. The roller reduced the effects of the rain and Simpson (12) and Washbrook (19) added 28 for the first wicket while the going was good. The wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans (16) was brought in as a [...] "daywatchman" [...] while the pitch dried out to normality. Ray Lindwall bowled only one over before being taken off and Keith Miller (2/29) and Bill Johnston (5/35) were brought on by Hassett to exploit the conditions with their part-time spin as England collapsed from 49/1 to 67/7 as good length balls leapt chest <b>high,</b> <b>shot</b> along the ground, turned and straightened. Brown declared on 68/7, 160 runs behind, a move without precedent in Test cricket, but the England captain wanted to get the Australians onto the pitch before it dried out and became inhabitable. With hindsight he should have delayed as Hutton was still 8 not out and could have added some runs. As it was England was forced to bat again before stumps, but few captains anticipate getting Australia 32/7.|$|E
