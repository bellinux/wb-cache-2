During processing, when sound waves enter the ear, this information is transduced into an unanalyzed auditory object. The subcortical auditory pathway then relays the information to the auditory cortex in the dorsal superior temporal gyrus (dSTG). In the dSTG, it is then divided into its constituent phones. These phones are then recognized into phonetic words in the superior temporal sulcus (STS). The information first enters the ventral stream at the posterior middle temporal gyrus and the posterior <b>inferior</b> <b>temporal</b> <b>sulcus</b> p(MTG+ITS). Here the auditory words are converted into semantic words. These words are then converted into a semantic phrase by the first combinatorial net at the anterior portion of the middle temporal lobe and then converted into a syntactic noun phrase at the second combinatorial net. This second combinatorial net is location in the anterior inferior temporal gyrus.|$|E

40|$|Age {{is one of}} {{the most}} salient aspects in faces and of {{fundamental}} cognitive and social relevance. Although face processing has been studied extensively, brain regions responsive to age have yet to be localized. Using evocative face morphs and fMRI, we segregate two areas extending beyond the previously established face-sensitive core network, centered on the <b>inferior</b> <b>temporal</b> <b>sulci</b> and angular gyri bilaterally, both of which process changes of facial age. By means of probabilistic tractography, we compare their patterns of functional activation and structural connectivity. The ventral portion of Wernicke’s understudied perpendicular association fasciculus is shown to interconnect the two areas, and activation within these clusters is related to the probability of fiber connectivity between them. In addition, post-hoc age-rating competence is found to be associated with high response magnitudes in the left angular gyrus. Our results provide the first evidence that facial age has a distinct representation pattern in the posterior human brain. We propose that particular face-sensitive nodes interact with additional object-unselective quantification modules to obtain individual estimates of facial age. This brain network processing the age of faces differs from the cortical areas that have previously been linked to less developmental but instantly changeable face aspects.

40|$|Modeling and {{understanding}} the degree of correlations between brain structures is a challenging problem in neuroscience. Correlated anatomic measures may arise from common genetic and trophic influences across brain regions, and may be overlooked if structures are modeled independently. Here, we propose a new method to analyze structural brain correlations based on a large set of cortical sulcal landmarks (72 per brain) delineated in 98 healthy subjects (age: 51. 8 +/- 6. 2 years). First, we evaluate the correlation between any pair of sulcal positions via the total covariance matrix, a 6 x 6 symmetric positive-definite matrix. We use Log-Euclidean metrics to extrapolate this sparse field of total covariance matrices to obtain a dense representation. Second, we perform canonical correlation analysis to measure the degree of correlations between any two positions, and derive from it a p-value map for significance testing. We present maps of both local and long-range correlations, including maps of covariation between corresponding structures in opposite hemispheres, which show different degrees of hemispheric specialization. Results show that the central and <b>inferior</b> <b>temporal</b> <b>sulci</b> are highly correlated with their symmetric counterparts in the opposite brain hemisphere. Moreover, several functionally unrelated cortical landmarks show a high correlation as well. This structural dependence is likely attributable to common genetic programs, experience-driven plasticity, and coordinated brain growth or presence of anatomical links (neural fibers) ...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{analyze the}} {{influence}} of head positioning during preoperative image data acquisition on intraoperative accuracy of modern neuronavigation systems. MATERIAL AND METHODS: All measurements were performed preoperatively before opening the head. In 24 patients, preoperative MR image data acquisition was performed twice on a 0. 5 T scanner using a contrast-enhanced T 1 -weighted sequence; first in the neutral head position, and thereafter in the surgical head position for pterional craniotomy. For both data sets, the Sylvian fissure, the central sulcus, and the superior and <b>inferior</b> <b>temporal</b> <b>sulci</b> were depicted on the patient's scalp using the frameless neuronavigation system EasyGuide Neurotrade mark. At the beginning of surgery, with the head fixed in a Mayfield clamp and an articulated instrument holder being used for fixation of the navigation system's pointer, the distances of 10 correlating points of the sulci for the two data sets were measured. To evaluate {{the accuracy of the}} navigation system in this experimental set-up, a phantom study was also performed. RESULTS: The phantom study revealed a mean inaccuracy of 1. 6 mm (range 0. 1 - 2. 3 mm, standard deviation 0. 6 mm). The patient study revealed a mean inaccuracy of 1. 8 mm (range 0. 4 - 2. 8 mm, standard deviation 0. 5 mm). CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that the positioning of the patient's head during preoperative imaging plays no relevant role in intraoperative accuracy of neuronavigation. However, further studies and a larger number of patients with various pathologies in different regions of the brain are necessary to obtain {{a better understanding of the}} problem of brain shift in neuronavigation due to patient positioning alone, and to avoid procedure-related operative morbidity...|$|R

The term 'speech perception' describes the process of interest that employs sub lexical contexts to the probe process. It consists of many different language and grammatical functions, such as: features, segments (phonemes), syllabic structure (unit of pronunciation), phonological word forms (how sounds are grouped together), grammatical features, morphemic (prefixes and suffixes), and semantic information (the meaning of the words).In the early years, they were more interested in the acoustics of speech.

5000|$|The {{temporal}} lobe {{is unique to}} primates. In humans, the IT cortex {{is more complex than}} their relative primate counterparts. The human inferior temporal cortex consists of the inferior temporal gyrus, the middle temporal gyrus, and the fusiform gyrus. When looking at the brain laterally - that is from the side and looking at the surface of the {{temporal lobe}} - the inferior temporal gyrus is along the bottom portion of the temporal lobe, and is separated from the middle temporal gyrus located directly above by the <b>inferior</b> <b>temporal</b> <b>sulcus.</b> Additionally, some processing of the visual field that corresponds to the ventral stream of visual processing occurs in the lower portion of the superior temporal gyrus closest to the superior temporal sulcus. The medial and ventral view of the brain - meaning looking at the medial surface from below the brain, facing upwards - reveals that the inferior temporal gyrus is separated from the fusiform gyrus by the occipital-temporal sulcus. This human inferior temporal cortex is much more complex than that of other primates: non-human primates have an inferior temporal cortex that is not divided into unique regions such as humans' inferior temporal gyrus, fusiform gyrus, or middle temporal gyrus. [...] This region of the brain corresponds to the inferior temporal cortex and is responsible for visual object recognition and receives processed visual information. The inferior temporal cortex in primates has specific regions dedicated to processing different visual stimuli processed and organized by the different layers of the striate cortex and extra-striate cortex. The information from the V1 -V5 regions of the geniculate and tectopulvinar pathways are radiated to the IT cortex via the ventral stream: visual information specifically related to the color and form of the visual stimuli. Through comparative research between primates - humans and non-human primates - results indicate that the IT cortex plays a significant role in visual shape processing. This is supported by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data collected by researchers comparing this neurological process between humans and macaques.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Accessing the {{hippocampus}} for amygdalohippocampectomy and procedures such as depth electrode placement requires accurate knowledge regarding {{the location of}} {{the hippocampus}}. METHODS: The authors removed 10 human cadaveric brains (20 sides) from their crania, noted relationships between the lateral temporal neocortex and underlying hippocampus, and measured the distance between the hippocampus and superficial landmarks. RESULTS: Mean distances were as follows: 3. 8 cm from the tip of the temporal lobe {{to the head of the}} hippocampus; 6. 5 cm from the tip of the temporal lobe to the junction of the fornix and hippocampus; and 3. 5 cm between the tail and head of the hippocampus. The head of the hippocampus ranged from 0 to 5 mm inferior to the <b>inferior</b> <b>temporal</b> <b>sulcus.</b> The tail of the hippocampus ranged from 2. 2 to 7 mm superior to the <b>inferior</b> <b>temporal</b> <b>sulcus.</b> In two specimens, the tail was deep to the superior temporal sulcus. Generally the length of the hippocampus was along the <b>inferior</b> <b>temporal</b> <b>sulcus</b> and inferior aspect of the middle temporal gyrus. The hippocampus tended to be more superiorly located and shorter in females and left sides, but this was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Additional landmarks for localizing the underlying hippocampus may be helpful in temporal lobe surgery.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{location}} of the temporal horn is important to neurosurgeons during procedures such as amygdalohippocampectomy and intraventricular electrode placement for temporal lobe seizure monitoring. However, sometimes the temporal horn is difficult to localize, especially without neuronavigation. The authors aimed to better localize this structure using superficial anatomic landmarks. METHODS: Twenty-two brain halves were dissected from the midline, and the fornix identified and followed toward {{the left and right}} temporal horns. Once the temporal horn was isolated from a mesial approach, 6 -cm long needles were placed into its anterior and posterior walls of the temporal horn and passed laterally from the axial plane to the cortical surface. Pin exit sites were marked externally and measurements taken between the outer temporal lobe cortex and the underlying temporal horn. RESULTS: No statistical differences were noted between left and right sides. The temporal horn was generally directed anteroinferiorly and best marked externally by the <b>inferior</b> <b>temporal</b> <b>sulcus.</b> The mean length of the temporal horn was 4. 4 cm. Mean distance from anterior temporal tip to anterior wall of the temporal horn was 3. 3 cm. The mean distance from the anterior temporal tip to the posterior wall of the temporal horn was 7 cm.

In Experiment 1 they learned a series of two-choice visual discriminations between patterns. The animals with lesions of the superior <b>temporal</b> <b>sulcus</b> were markedly impaired. The discriminations were of two types: in the first, the discriminanda differed in shape (e. g. Y and 3), while in the second they differed only in their orientation (e. g.). Unlike animals with lesions to the neighbouring <b>inferior</b> <b>temporal</b> cortex who are impaired on shape but not orientation discriminations, animals with lesions of the superior <b>temporal</b> <b>sulcus</b> were equally impaired on both types of discrimination. In Experiment 2 the same six animals learned a series of discriminations between discriminanda which consisted of photographs of pairs of eyes. Each discrimination was between a set of eyes which looked directly at the viewer and a set in which the gaze was laterally averted to varying degrees. Again, animals with lesions of the superior <b>temporal</b> <b>sulcus</b> showed a marked impairment. We conclude that this impairment may be a general impairment in two-choice visual discrimination learning, rather than a selective impairment in discrimination of eye gaze.

Several cortical areas that support this process respond selectively in fMRI to static and dynamic displays of human bodies and faces.

Functionally defined body-, face-, and motion-selective visual areas all responded significantly to “point-light” human motion. Strikingly, however, only body selectivity was correlated, on a voxel-by-voxel basis, with biological motion selectivity. We conclude that (1) biological motion, through the process of structure-from-motion, engages areas involved in the analysis of the static human form; (2) body-selective regions in posterior fusiform gyrus and posterior <b>inferior</b> <b>temporal</b> <b>sulcus</b> overlap with, but are distinct from, face- and motion-selective regions; (3) the interpretation of region-of-interest findings may be substantially altered when multiple patterns of selectivity are considered...|$|E

The latter selectivity proved remarkably vulnerable to disparity discontinuities, such as sharp edges or steps in disparity. The majority of the neurons remained selective for small disparity variations within the stimulus. 3 D shape selectivity was preserved when the frontoparallel position or the stimulus size was altered.

Modality-specific activations unrelated to semantic processing occurred in the left inferior parietal lobule for words, and the right middle occipital gyrus for pictures.

Prior work (Hooker et al, 2014) has revealed neural deficits in ventral lateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) during processing of positive emotion {{in a community}} sample of people with high social anhedonia. Deficits in VLPFC neural activity are related to worse self-reported schizophrenia-spectrum symptoms and worse mood and behavior after social stress. In the current study, psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis was applied to investigate the neural mechanisms mediated by VLPFC during emotion processing.

Across all participants, connectivity between VLPFC and inferior parietal region when viewing positive (versus neutral) emotion was significantly correlated with measures of emotion management and attentional control. Additionally connectivity between VLPFC and superior temporal sulcus was related to reward and pleasure anticipation, and connectivity between VLPFC and <b>inferior</b> <b>temporal</b> <b>sulcus</b> correlated with attentional control measure.

We present an anatomical tracing {{study in which}} polysensory association cortex located at the fundus and upper bank of the rostral superior <b>temporal</b> <b>sulcus</b> presents reciprocal connections with primary olfactory structures. At the same time, projections from this polysensory area reach multiple primary olfactory centres. Retrograde (Fast Blue) and anterograde (biotinylated dextran–amine and 3 H-amino acids) tracers were injected into primary olfactory structures and rostral superior <b>temporal</b> <b>sulcus.</b> Retrograde tracers restricted to the anterior olfactory nucleus resulted in labelled neurons in the rostral portion of the upper bank and fundus of superior <b>temporal</b> <b>sulcus.</b> Injections of biotinylated dextran–amine at the fundus and upper bank of the superior <b>temporal</b> <b>sulcus</b> confirmed this projection by labelling axons in the dorsal and lateral portions of the anterior olfactory nucleus, as well as piriform, periamygdaloid and entorhinal cortices. Retrograde tracer injections at the rostral superior <b>temporal</b> <b>sulcus</b> resulted in neuronal labelling in the anterior olfactory nucleus, piriform, periamygdaloid and entorhinal cortices, thus providing confirmation of the reciprocity between primary olfactory structures and the cortex at the rostral superior <b>temporal</b> <b>sulcus.</b> The reciprocal connections between the rostral part of superior <b>temporal</b> <b>sulcus</b> and primary olfactory structures represent a convergence for olfactory and other sensory modalities at the cortex of the rostral temporal lobe...|$|R
40|$|Cognitive and neurocognitive {{models of}} face {{processing}} suggest that independent (modular) processing routes are engaged for {{different types of}} face processing tasks. This study used fMRI (1. 5 T) to examine common and distinctive processing routes for the perception of speech and emotion from posed photographs. For speech categorization (‘Is that a vowel or a consonant?’), there was bilateral activation in frontal and <b>inferior</b> <b>temporal</b> (including fusiform) regions. The emotion task (‘Is the expression positive or negative?’) also showed activation in <b>inferior</b> <b>temporal</b> and frontal regions, but this was right lateralized. While an incidental task (‘Can you see her teeth?’), using the same pictures, activated identical regions for the emotion faces, {{this was not the}} case for speech, where activation was limited to fusiform regions. Emotionally expressive, but not speech face images, readily activate a right-lateralized temporo-frontal circuit, whatever the task demands. Speech categorization from still images recruits extensive frontal regions, bilaterally, confirming previous findings [1]. Unlike previous reports, superior temporal regions did not show significant levels of activation for speech faces, although right superior <b>temporal</b> <b>sulcus</b> (STS) was activated by the emotional faces. 2...|$|R
50|$|The <b>inferior</b> <b>temporal</b> gyrus is the {{anterior}} {{region of the}} temporal lobe located underneath the central <b>temporal</b> <b>sulcus.</b> The primary function of the occipital temporal gyrus - otherwise referenced as IT cortex - is associated with visual stimuli processing, namely visual object recognition, and has been suggested by recent experimental results as the final location of the ventral cortical visual system. The IT cortex in humans {{is also known as}} the <b>Inferior</b> <b>Temporal</b> Gyrus since it has been located to a specific region of the human temporal lobe. The IT processes visual stimuli of objects in our field of vision, and is involved with memory and memory recall to identify that object; it is involved with the processing and perception created by visual stimuli amplified in the V1, V2, V3, and V4 regions of the occipital lobe. This region processes the color and form of the object in the visual field and is responsible for producing the “what” from this visual stimuli, or in other words identifying the object based on the color and form of the object and comparing that processed information to stored memories of objects to identify that object.|$|R
