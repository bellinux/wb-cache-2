[Subjects and Methods] Study subjects at four universi-ties in G city were surveyed. A total of 1, 000 questionnaires were distributed, and 959 responses were analyzed. The collected data was analyzed using descriptive statistics and multiple logistic regression analysis. [Results] <b>Factors</b> <b>that</b> <b>contributed</b> to the transition from the pre-contemplation stage to the contemplation stage included change-experimental processes (C-EP) and change-behavioral processes (C-BP). <b>Factors</b> <b>that</b> <b>contributed</b> to the transition from the contemplation stage to the preparation stage were C-BP and decisional decisional balance-cons (DB-C). Self-efficacy was the <b>factor</b> <b>that</b> <b>contributed</b> to the transition from the preparation stage to the action stage. However, there was no <b>factor</b> <b>that</b> <b>contributed</b> to the transition from the action stage to the maintenance stage. [Con-clusion] When exercise behavior change is low, strategies such as giving one-to-one training, having the subjects read relevant books, and providing information are needed. When exercise behavior change is high, it is necessary to heighten self-efficacy by having subjects select and freely conduct appropriate kinds of exercises...|$|R

In general Pachypodium have few branches.

25|$|One of {{the victims}} found {{alongside}} the highway, 16-year-old Ramona Wilson, was a subject of a 2006 documentary film by Métis filmmaker Christine Welsh, entitled Finding Dawn. Welsh's documentary highlights the tragic reality that Aboriginal women face today; in the past 30 years, an estimated 500 Aboriginal women have gone missing or have been murdered in Canada. Welsh uncovers the social, economic and historical <b>factors</b> <b>that</b> <b>contribute</b> to this grim statistic. Finding Dawn honours the women whose lives were lost and instills hope within a deeply wounded culture. The film can be accessed online on the Nation Film Board web page.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{males in}} {{competitive}} sports are often advised by their coaches {{not to be}} in intimate relationships based on the premises that they become more docile and less aggressive during an athletic event. The circumstances in which males and females experience aggression are also different. A study showed that social anxiety and stress was positively correlated with aggression in males, meaning as stress and social anxiety increases so does aggression. Furthermore, a male with higher social skills has a lower rate of aggressive behavior than a male with lower social skills. In females, higher rates of aggression were only correlated with higher rates of stress. Other than biological <b>factors</b> <b>that</b> <b>contribute</b> to aggression there are physical factors are well.|$|E

25|$|The {{perception}} of the landscape in historical ecology differs from other disciplines, such as landscape ecology. Landscape ecologists often attribute the depletion of biodiversity to human disturbance. Historical ecologists recognize {{that this is not}} always true. These changes are due to multiple <b>factors</b> <b>that</b> <b>contribute</b> to the ever-changing landscape. Landscape ecology still focuses on areas defined as ecosystems. In this, the ecosystem perpetually returns to a state of equilibrium. In contrast, historical ecologists view the landscape as perpetually changing. Landscape ecologists view noncyclical human events and natural disasters as external influences, while historical ecologists view disturbances {{as an integral part of}} the landscape's history. It is this integration of the concept of disturbance and history that allows for landscape to be viewed as palimpsests, representing successive layers of change, rather than as static entities.|$|E
25|$|Beyond {{the obvious}} detriments towards the {{theoretical}} success of open source software, {{there are several}} <b>factors</b> <b>that</b> <b>contribute</b> {{to the lack of}} long-term success in open source projects. One of the most obvious drawback is that without pay or royalty licensing, there is little financial incentive for a programmer to become involved with a project in the first place, or to continue development and support once the initial product is released. This leads to innumerable examples of well-anticipated software being forever condemned to beta versions and unsupported early model products. With donations as the only source of income for a truly open source (and GPL licensed) project, there is almost no certainty in the future of the project simply because of developer abandonment, making it a poor choice for any sort of application in which future versions, support and a long-term plan would be essential, as is the case for most business software.|$|E
25|$|According to the transtheoretical {{model of}} {{behavior}} change, {{also known as}} the stages of change model, states that there are five stages towards behavior change. The five stages, between which individuals may transition before achieving complete change, are precontemplation, contemplation, preparation for action, action, and maintenance. At the precontemplation stage, an individual {{may or may not be}} aware of a problem but has no thought of changing their behavior. From precontemplation to contemplation, the individual begins thinking about changing a certain behavior. During preparation, the individual begins his plans for change, and during the action stage the individual begins to exhibit new behavior consistently. An individual finally enters the maintenance stage once they exhibit the new behavior consistently for over six months. A problem faced with the stages of change model is that it is very easy for a person to enter the maintenance stage and then fall back into earlier stages. <b>Factors</b> <b>that</b> <b>contribute</b> to this decline include external factors such as weather or seasonal changes, and/or personal issues a person is dealing with.|$|E
