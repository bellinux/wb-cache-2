50|$|There {{are several}} {{issues related to}} the adverse {{environmental}} impact due to production of bananas. One issue is of waste management, particularly of plastic bags that are tied to the plants and the fruits during the stages of its growth. Of these bags, the blue colour bags are reported to have toxic effect of Chlorpyrifos, which are not controlled and found strewn all over the place. Aerial spraying of insecticides takes place with about 25 such cycles of spraying in a year. This is a major issue as the people both in the banana production process as in the spraying process are exposed to the toxic effects of such spraying. Not only the plantation but also houses, animals and water bodies are affected by the spray. Testing of water samples from affected areas has revealed calixin and also organophosphates. These toxics can lead to toxicant-induced loss of tolerance (TILT). While aerial spraying is one aspect of the problem manual spraying has much greater impact in the field as the task is sublet to contractors whose employees performing the task are not employed by the plantation and they use highly toxic products such as Mocap (<b>Ethoprophos),</b> and they usually work without any protective cover.|$|E

Highly accelerated degradation rates were measured for aldicarb, oxamyl and <b>ethoprophos</b> in a sandy soil (pH 7. 3) treated three times. After five years without further treatments, these high rates were still found for aldicarb and oxamyl, but not for <b>ethoprophos.</b> In another field (sandy soil, pH 5. 6) little or no increase in the degradation rates was measured in plots that had been treated ten times...|$|E
40|$|Two modellers {{tested the}} PESTLA model (version 2. 3. 1) against {{results of a}} field study on {{bentazone}} and <b>ethoprophos</b> behaviour in a sandy soil. Both modellers achieved an acceptable description of the measured moisture profiles but only after calibration of the soil hydraulic properties. Both could describe the bromide-ion concentration profiles measured {{at the end of}} the first winter reasonably well. However, both predicted that practically all bromide had leached out of the top 50 cm of the soil {{at the end of the}} second winter, whereas about 10 % of the bromide dose remained in this layer. This is attributable to a systematic deviation of bromide transport from the concept assumed in the convection/dispersion equation and/or to the release of bromide from dead root remnants. Both modellers derived pesticide transformation and sorption parameters from laboratory studies with soil from the field. Both described bentazone movement reasonably well. Modeller 1 described the concentration profiles reasonably well, whereas Modeller 2 strongly overestimated the concentrations at the end of the study. This difference was mainly attributable to a difference in interpretation of the temperature dependence of the transformation rate of bentazone. Only Modeller 2 simulated <b>ethoprophos</b> behaviour. He simulated the persistence of <b>ethoprophos</b> in the top 20 cm very well during the first 200 days. However, thereafter the transformation in the field proceeded much faster than simulated. This is probably caused by accelerated transformation resulting from exposure of the top soil layer to about 1 mg kg - 1 of <b>ethoprophos</b> over 200 days. Simulated penetration of <b>ethoprophos</b> was deeper than measured. By including accelerated transformation (admittedly on an ad-hoc basis) within the simulations, good agreement was achieved between measured and simulated penetration of <b>ethoprophos.</b> Calculations showed that the effect of calibrating water flow was substantial for bentazone but small for <b>ethoprophos.</b> However, the effect of calibration of water flow for bentazone was much smaller than the effect of the difference between the transformation rate parameters derived by the two modellers. We recommend that the guidance for deriving pesticide-soil input parameters be improved in order to reduce differences between modellers because a large influence of the person of the modeller on the outcome of model tests is unacceptable for methodological reasons.

40|$|The {{present study}} aimed {{to assess the}} {{environmental}} fate of the insecticide and nematicide <b>ethoprophos</b> in the soil-water interface following the pesticide application in simulated maize and potato crops under Mediterranean agricultural conditions, particularly of irrigation. Focus {{was given to the}} soil-water transfer pathways (leaching and runoff), to the pesticide transport in soil between pesticide application (crop row) and non-application areas (between crop rows), as well as to toxic effects of the various matrices on terrestrial and aquatic biota. A semi-field methodology mimicking a "worst-case" <b>ethoprophos</b> application (twice the recommended dosage for maize and potato crops: 100 % concentration v/v) in agricultural field situations was used, in order to mimic a possible misuse by the farmer under realistic conditions. A rainfall was simulated under a slope of 20 ° for both crop-based scenarios. Soil and water samples were collected for the analysis of pesticide residues. Ecotoxicity of soil and aquatic samples was assessed by performing lethal and sublethal bioassays with organisms from different trophic levels: the collembolan Folsomia candida, the earthworm Eisenia andrei and the cladoceran Daphnia magna. Although the majority of <b>ethoprophos</b> sorbed to the soil application area, pesticide concentrations were detected in all water matrices illustrating pesticide transfer pathways of water contamination between environmental compartments. Leaching to groundwater proved to be an important transfer pathway of <b>ethoprophos</b> under both crop-based scenarios, as it resulted in high pesticide concentration in leachates from Maize (130 µgL(- 1)) and Potato (630 µgL(- 1)) crop scenarios, respectively. <b>Ethoprophos</b> application at the Potato crop scenario caused more toxic effects on terrestrial and aquatic biota than at the Maize scenario at the recommended dosage and lower concentrations. In both crop-based scenarios, <b>ethoprophos</b> moved with the irrigation water flow to the soil between the crop rows where no pesticide was applied, causing toxic effects on terrestrial organisms. The two simulated agricultural crop-based scenarios had the merit to illustrate the importance of transfer pathways of pesticides from soil to groundwater through leaching and from crop rows to the surrounding soil areas in a soil-water interface environment, which is representative for irrigated agricultural crops under Mediterranean conditions...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to collect a data set {{suitable}} for testing pesticide leaching models in the case of a Dutch sandy soil with a shallow groundwater table. The movement of water, bromide ion and the behaviour of the pesticides <b>ethoprophos</b> and bentazone was studied. The substances were applied after sowing winter wheat in autumn 1990. This late application time is unusual for bentazone: it was selected on scientific grounds (without agricultural purpose). Rainfall, groundwater level and soil temperature were monitored continuously at the experimental field (80 m long and 54 m wide) until spring 1992. Soil profiles were sampled at 1, 103, 278 and 474 days after application (16 profiles at each date). In the laboratory, pesticide transformation rates were measured with soil material from 0 – 25, 50 – 100 and 100 – 200 cm depth. Sorption isotherms were measured with material from 0 – 25 cm depth. Concentration profiles showed that mobility increased in the sequence <b>ethoprophos</b> — bentazone — bromide ion. <b>Ethoprophos</b> movement was limited to the top 25 cm layer whereas bentazone leached to below 1 m depth. At the end of the study, the concentrations of <b>ethoprophos</b> and bentazone were below the detection limit (0. 2 – 2 μg dm− 3) in all soil layers between 25 and 120 cm depth.

40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{limited number}} of {{pesticides}} are available for the control of soil pests in potato. This, together with the monoculture nature of potato cultivation, does not favour chemical rotation, increasing the risk of reduced biological efficacy due to microbial adaptation. The dissipation of three major organophosphates (chlorpyrifos, <b>ethoprophos</b> and fosthiazate) was studied in comparison with fipronil, an insecticide recently introduced in potato cultivation, in 17 soils from potato monoculture areas in Greece to explore the extent of enhanced biodegradation development. RESULTS: The dissipation time of the four pesticides varied in the different soils, with DT 50 values of 1. 7 - 30. 8 days, 2. 7 - 56 days, 7. 0 - 31. 0 days and 24. 5 - 116. 5 days for fosthiazate, chlorpyrifos, <b>ethoprophos</b> and fipronil, respectively. A rapid dissipation of <b>ethoprophos</b> and fosthiazate in two soils with previous exposure to these nematicides provided first evidence {{for the development of}} enhanced biodegradation. Sterilisation of the given soils inhibited the dissipation of fosthiazate. Additionally, fosthiazate dissipation in the soils increased upon repeated applications. CONCLUSION: The development of enhanced biodegradation of fosthiazate in soils from potato monoculture regions was verified. This is the first report of enhanced biodegradation for this chemical. Further studies will focus on the isolation of microorganisms responsible for the dissipation of fosthiazate. © 2015 Society of Chemical Industry...|$|E
30|$|Influence of {{additional}} carbon source on degradation of OP compounds varies from one organism to another. For instance, a provision {{of additional}} carbon source to Paracoccus strain TRP [39] and Enterobacter strain B- 14 [40] {{led to a}} lag phase followed by an accelerated degradation of chlorpyrifos. The degradation of <b>ethoprophos</b> by Pseudomonas putida epI was not markedly influenced {{by the presence of}} a supplementary carbon source [38]. <b>Ethoprophos</b> degradation by P. putida epII was slower in the presence of glucose or succinate. On the other hand, glucose enhanced the degradation rate of Bacillus pumilus C 2 A 1 as it completely degraded the chlorpyrifos within 3  days of incubation. However, results of the current study revealed that supplementation of carbon had a different response to the degradation of quinalphos by the B. thuringiensis. The disappearance of quinalphos by B. thuringiensis in the presence of sodium acetate was marginally improved. This might be due to the effect of sodium acetate on the growth of the bacterium.|$|E

40|$|Current {{knowledge}} on fate and effect of agricultural pesticides comes is mainly from temperate ecosystems. More {{studies are needed}} in tropical systems {{in order to assess}} contamination risks to nontarget endemic tropical species from the extensive use of pesticides e. g. in banana and pineapple plantations. In this study, acute laboratory toxicity tests with organophosphate pesticides <b>ethoprophos</b> and chlorpyrifos were conducted on two Costa Rican species, cladoceran Daphnia ambigua and fish Parachromis dovii. Tests showed that chlorpyrifos was more toxic than <b>ethoprophos</b> to D. ambigua and P. dovii and that D. ambigua was also more sensitive than P. dovii to both pesticides. Additionally, bioassays were performed by exposing D. magna and P. dovii to contaminated water collected from the field. Chemical analyses of field water revealed that fungicides were generally the most frequent pesticide group found, followed by insecticides/nematicides and herbicides. The bioassays and values obtained from the literature confirmed that D. magna was more sensitive to pesticide contamination than P. dovii and that D. ambigua was more sensitive than D. magna, suggesting that the native cladoceran is a more suitable test species than its temperate counterpart. Species sensitivity distributions showed no significant difference in sensitivity between tropical and temperate fish and the arthropod species exposed to chlorpyrifos in this study. Choline esterase activity (ChE) was measured in P. dovii in laboratory tests in order to assess the applicability of this biomarker. ChE inhibition in P. dovii was observed in the laboratory at levels below the LC 10 of both <b>ethoprophos</b> and chlorpyrifos, confirming that ChE is an efficient biomarker of exposure.

40|$|User-dependent {{subjectivity}} in {{the process}} of testing pesticide leaching models is relevant because it may result in wrong interpretation of model tests. About 20 modellers used the same data set to test pesticide leaching models (one or two models per modeller). The data set included laboratory studies on transformation and sorption of <b>ethoprophos</b> and bentazone in soil from the top 25 cm, at two or three temperatures. All modellers received the raw data from these studies without guidance for deriving the model input parameters. The modellers were asked to provide the values of the half-lives and sorption coefficients which the model considered would use for this soil layer at 10 °C (and at field capacity for the haft-lives). The half-life of <b>ethoprophos</b> ranged from 92 to 346 days with an average of 191 days and a coefficient of variation of 29 %. The half-life of bentazone ranged from 33 to 204 days with an average of 83 days and a coefficient of variation of 46 %. The linear and Freundlich sorption coefficients of <b>ethoprophos</b> ranged from 1. 7 to 4. 3 dm 3 kg - 1 with an average of 3. 4 dm 3 kg - 1 and a coefficient of variation of 21 %. The linear and Freundlich sorption coefficients of bentazone ranged from 0. 08 to 0. 14 dm 3 kg - 1 with an average of 0. 11 dm 3 kg - 1 and a coefficient of variation of 13 %. This variability caused by the interpretation of the modeller is so large that it overrules conceptual differences between models in many cases. The most important cause of the variability in the half-lives was the expert judgement involved in establishing the relationship between transformation rate and soil temperature. Differences in fitting procedures played only a minor role for the half-lives but they were an important cause of the variability in the linear sorption coefficient. Some recommendations are proposed to reduce the effect of user-subjectivity on modelling results in future model tests. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B. V...|$|E

All reproduction tests were performed with natural soil from a Mediterranean agricultural area (with no pesticide residues) {{in order to}} improve the relevance of laboratory data to field conditions.

40|$|The {{ecotoxicological}} risk concept {{is considered to}} be the basis for setting environmental quality objectives for pesticides in groundwater. Ecotoxicological critical concentrations for groundwater can be derived through several exploratory approaches. These approaches will be subsequently compared (focusing mainly on the Netherlands but bringing the European Union standard for pesticides in groundwater into the relevant context) with critically reviewed groundwater monitoring data. Furthermore, aldicarb, atrazine and MITC results of geographic modelling are ecotoxicologically evaluated. The study focuses mainly on the Netherlands but the European context is not forgotten. Many reported groundwater monitoring data are strongly correlated. Therefore the assessment of the extent of groundwater contamination should be {{based on the number of}} localities where pesticides have been detected.

40|$|The {{granular}} nematicides aldicarb, oxamyl and <b>ethoprophos</b> {{often are}} applied to control plant parasitic nematodes. However, {{the use of these}} pesticides may have some disadvantages. In field trials, they increased stem infection of potatoes caused by Rhizoctonia solani Kühn and incidence of black scurf (sclerotia of R. solani) on tubers. This thesis, reports about possible mechanisms involved in the increased infection in nematicide treated fields. The effects of granular nematicides were studied on:- the pathogenicity of R. solani (Chapters 2 and 3) - the susceptibility of the host plant (Chapter 3) - the microbial antagonism to R. solani (Chapter 2) - the mycophagous soil fauna, i. e. nematodes (Chapters 5 and 7) or springtails and mites (Chapters 6 and 7) <b>Ethoprophos</b> was fungitoxic to R. solani. On Czapek Dox agar (CDA), the EC 50 of the compound was 49 mg l - 1 and at 100 mg l - 1 there was a total growth inhibition. Oxamyl showed a slight fungitoxicity. At 100 Mg 1 - 1 oxamyl in CDA, the growth of R. solani was reduced by 26 %. Aldicarb did not influence the growth of R. solani on CDA, but caused a slight growth stimulation on potato dextrose agar (PDA). The carbamate compounds aldicarb and oxamyl are systemically transported in plants. The presence inside the plant might, therefore, have some effect on the host-plant resistance to R. solani. The organophosphorus compound <b>ethoprophos</b> is not known to have a systemic activity, so it differs from the other two nematicides with respect to the uptake by the host plant. It was therefore, less likely that the increased infection by R. solani in nematicide-treated soil, was due to a reduced host-plant resistance. Laboratory experiments supplied the evidence that the nematicides did not reduce host-plant resistance. <b>Ethoprophos</b> caused an initial growth inhibition of potato sprouts, but immediately after their emergence, growth was promoted. In laboratory experiments carried out at 15 °C in a growth chamber, the emergence of sprouts was delayed by three days, when tubers were planted in ethoprophos-treated soil. However, most probably due to the fungitoxicity of <b>ethoprophos,</b> the appearance of lesions on the stems was delayed by nine days in this treatment. Oxamyl showed similar effects to <b>ethoprophos,</b> but to a lesser extent, while aldicarb did neither influence sprout development nor the appearance of lesions. The stages in the infection process, including growth of runner hyphae, branching of hyphae on the stem surface, formation of infection cushions and the relationship between size of the infection cushions and size of lesions, were not influenced by any of the nematicides. The previous observations made an indirect effect highly evident. In a study on the infection process was found that the size of lesions was proportional {{to the size of the}} infection cushions (dense masses of mycelium from which R. solani penetrates the plant). Any agent that changes the size of infection cushions will alter, therefore, the severity of the disease. By far the most important mycoparasite of R. solani in Dutch potato fields is Verticillium biguttatum, so the study on effects on mycoparasites was focussed on this fungus. The growth of V. biguttatum was strongly stimulated by aldicarb and <b>ethoprophos</b> on potato dextrose agar plates covered with mycelium of R. solani. The mechanism involved was not studied. In the nematicide-treated fields, the incidence of V. biguttatum on stolons was increased. This may be due to an increased availability of substrate (i. e. mycelium of R. solani) or a reduced activity of the mycophagous soil fauna, as well as from a direct stimulation by the nematicide. At the recommended dosages of aldicarb, oxamyl or <b>ethoprophos,</b> an effect on soil fungistasis was not found, neither in laboratory experiments nor in field experiments. The laboratory experiments indicated that the most probable explanation for the increased disease severity of R. solani in nematicide-treated fields is a suppression of the mycophagous soil fauna. In the experimental fields, the most abundant mycophagous nematodes were Aphelenchus avenae and Aphelenchoides spp. These nematodes could be reared on petri-dishes covered with mycelium of R. solani. In the rhizosphere of plants of which the foliage was removed, numbers of A. avenae increased dramatically. Outside the rhizosphere, only very low numbers of A. avenae and Aphelenchoides spp. were found. It was assumed that the large increase was due to a rapid development of the microflora in the rhizosphere of dying roots. Aldicarb, oxamyl and <b>ethoprophos</b> greatly limited this increase. In a field that had been fumigated with dichloropropene, the granular nematicides hardly affected stem infection and black scurf incidence. Initially, metabolites that may have been formed after fumigation could have had a toxic effect on R. solani. All soil animals were strongly reduced at the beginning of the growing season in the fumigated field. Later in the season, numbers of A. avenae were much higher in the rhizosphere of plants grown in fumigated soil than in non-fumigated soil. Although the granular nematicides reduced numbers of A. avenae also in the fumigated soil, the remaining population density of A. avenae was still high. In nematicide-treated plots, the disease suppression was, therefore, not much lower than in the untreated plots. To simulate potato stems colonized by R. solani, flax straws colonized by the fungus were buried in the field. Mycophagous nematodes rapidly increased on the straws. In aldicarb-treated plots, only low numbers of mycophagous nematodes were observed on these straws. These data show that grazing of mycophagous nematodes on mycelium and probably also on infection cushions of R. solani will be less in nematicide-treated soil than in untreated soil. In one field trial, the effect of the insecticide lindane on R. solani was assessed to discriminate between the role of mycophagous nematodes and mycophagous microarthropods. In lindane-treated plots, stem infection and black scurf incidence were increased to almost the same extent as in aldicarb-treated plots. Lindane did not have any nematicidal activity. This indicates that at least in this field microarthropods may also reduce R. solani by grazing. Aldicarb, <b>ethoprophos</b> and lindane reduced the numbers of most springtails and mites in potato fields. The most abundant springtails were Tullbergia krausbaueri, Isotoma notabilis and Folsomia fimetaria, and the most abundant mites were Pygmephorus sellnicki, Pygmephorus blumentritti, Coccotydeus sp. and Histiosoma litorale. Numbers of Pygmephorus spp. were not reduced in aldicarb- and ethoprophos-treated plots. T. krausbaueri was reduced in lindaneand ethoprophos-treated plots, but only slightly in aldicarb- treated plots. In the laboratory, T. krausbaueri, F. fimetaria and H. litorale could be reared on petri-dishes covered with R. solani or cultures of R. solani in sterilized soil. Pygmephorus spp. and Coccotydeus sp. could not be reared on these cultures, while I. notabilis was not successfully isolated from the field. In laboratory experiments where the microarthropods were introduced in a soil inoculated with R. solani, T. krausbaueri and F. fimetaria caused a strong reduction of stem infection of potatoes. Lowest numbers of T. krausbaueri and F. fimetaria that significantly reduced disease severity were 9800 and 430 individuals per litre soil, respectively. H. litorale did not survive during the experiment, so it was probably not important in grazing on mycelium of R. solani. In similar inoculation experiments, A. avenae was also found to cause a significant reduction in stem infection when inoculated with 500 nematodes per litre. An Aphelenchoides sp. had no effect on stem infection. Nematodes reproduced within a few days at room temperature, while springtails and mites had a much slower reproduction cycle. A. avenae and F. fimetaria seem to be some of the most important mycophagous soil animals that lead to a reduction by R. solani in the field. A smaller contribution in the reduction of disease severity can be expected from T. krausbaueri and other mycophagous soil animals that are only present at low densities. However, some of the species that were not reared in the laboratory on mycelium of R. solani, may also be able to cause a significant reduction of disease severity at low population densities. Any pesticide that reduces the density of mycophagous soil animals will, therefore, facilitate a better development of R. solani. The stimulatory effects of granular nematicides on R. solani on potato seem primarily caused by reduced grazing of the mycophagous soil fauna on the pathogen in nematicide-treated fields. ...|$|E

40|$|A {{validation}} {{study of the}} physical based pesticide leaching model WAVE is presented. The model considers a mechanistic description of 1 -D water, solute and heat transport. Linear sorption isotherms and first order degradation sub-models are used to simulate pesticide sorption and transformation. The first order degradation rates are reduced when temperature and moisture stress in the soil profile occur. The model is conceived to describe pesticide fate within rigid mineral soils. Model tests were therefore done using data collected at a sandy (Vredepeel) and a loamy soil (Weiherbach). Both field data and lysimeter data were {{used to evaluate the}} performance to describe water, bromide, <b>ethoprophos,</b> bentazone and isoproturon transport in soil. The evaluation procedure presented by Vanclooster et al. (Agric. Water Mgmt,, Vol. 44, pp. 1 - 19) was completely adopted. The measured soil moisture in the sandy soil could only successfully be described after calibrating the hydraulic functions using field observed soil moisture profiles. Zn addition, the predicted balance terms, such as the soil water drainage, were subject to a lot of uncertainty. Bromide transport in the sandy soil was poorly described with the equilibrium solute transport model. Anomalies were also observed when simulating the transport of the inert tracer in the lysimeter at the loamy site. The fate of the weakly sorbing bentazone component was appropriately described at the Vredepeel field site. However, the retardation of the strongly sorbing <b>ethoprophos</b> and isoproturon components was poorly simulated. Further, the pesticide dissipation varied considerably in time, which could not be accounted for with the first order degradation model. The need for model calibration illustrates the constraints when using mechanistic models such as WAVE to predict field scale pesticide fate and transport. The adoption of a mechanistic model for registration purposes may therefore be subjected to a lot of uncertainty. Ln addition, processes affecting pesticide fate and transport are still poorly represented within the model. Deficiencies are related to the description of non-linear sorption, time dependent pesticide degradation, and pesticide volatilisation. Future developments with the model should therefore envisage to improve the parametrisation reduce the output uncertainty, and improve process descriptions of essential processes.

40|$|This study {{assesses the}} {{ecological}} risks (ERA) of pesticides to aquatic organisms in the River Madre de Dios (RMD), which receives surface runoff water from banana, pineapple, and rice plantations on the Caribbean coast of Costa Rica. Water samples collected over 2 years at five {{sites in the}} RMD revealed a total of 26 pesticides. Their toxicity risk to aquatic organisms was assessed using three recent ERA models. (1) The PERPEST model showed a high probability (> 50 %) of clear toxic effects of pesticide mixtures on algae, macrophytes, zooplankton, macroinvertebrates, and community metabolism and a low probability (< 50 %) of clear effects on fish. (2) Species sensitivity distributions (SSD) showed a moderate to high risk of three herbicides: ametryn, bromacil, diuron and four insecticides: carbaryl, diazinon, <b>ethoprophos,</b> terbufos. (3) The multi-substance potentially affected fraction (msPAF) model showed results consistent with PERPEST: high risk to algae (maximum msPAF: 73 %), aquatic plants (61 %), and arthropods (25 %) and low risk to fish (0. 2 %) from pesticide mixtures. The pesticides posing the highest risks according to msPAF {{and that should be}} substituted with less toxic substances were the herbicides ametryn, diuron, the insecticides carbaryl, chlorpyrifos, diazinon, <b>ethoprophos,</b> and the fungicide difenoconazole. Ecological risks were highest near the plantations and decreased progressively further downstream. The risk to fish was found to be relatively low in these models, but water samples were not collected during fish kill events and some highly toxic pesticides known to be used were not analyzed for in this study. Further sampling and analysis of water samples is needed to determine toxicity risks to fish during peaks of pesticide mixture concentrations. The msPAF model, which estimates the ecological risks of mixtures based on their toxic modes of action, was found to be the most suitable model to assess toxicity risks to aquatic organisms in the RMD. The PERPEST model was found to be a strong tool for screening risk assessments. The SSD approach is useful in deriving water quality criteria for specific pesticides. This study, through the application of three ERA models, clearly shows that pesticides used in plantations within the RMD watershed are expected to have severe adverse effects on most groups of aquatic organisms and that actions are urgently needed to reduce pesticide pollution in this high biodiversity ecosystem...|$|E

The method is based on microwave-assisted extraction using a water-methanol modified mixture for desorption and simultaneous partitioning on n-hexane (MAEP), together with gas chromatography-flame photometric detection (GC-FPD). To improve GC-FPD signals (peak intensity and shape) olive oil was used effectively as a "matrix mimic". The optimisation of the extraction method was achieved in two steps: an initial approach through experimental design and principal component analysis where recovery of compounds using a water-methanol mixture ranged from 54 to 77 %, and the second one by studying the addition of KH 2 PO 4 to the extracting solution where recoveries were significantly increased, molecular replacing of OPPs from adsorption sites by phosphate being the probable extraction mechanism. Under optimised conditions, recoveries of pesticides from different soils were higher than 73 %, except for methyl parathion in some soils, with SD equal or lower than 11 % and detection limits ranging from 0. 004 to 0. 012 mu g g(- 1).

Important parameters that influence the extraction efficiency (i. e., fibre type, extraction modes, extraction time, salt addition, desorption time and temperature) were systematically investigated. Four types of commercially available fibres (i. e., 50 / 30 μm divinylbenzene/carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane (DVB/CAR/PDMS), 65 μm polydimethylsiloxane/divinylbenzene (PDMS/DVB), 100 μm polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), and 85 μm polyacrylate (PA)) were evaluated.

We performed a first tier risk assessment of the maximum measured concentrations of 32 pesticides detected over 4 years in the River Madre de Dios (RMD) and its coastal lagoon on the Caribbean coast of Costa Rica. Species sensitivity distributions (SSDs) were plotted in order to derive HC 5 values for each pesticide, i. e., hazard concentrations for 5 % of the species, often used as environmental criteria values in other countries. We also carried out toxicity tests for selected pesticides with native Costa Rican species in order to calculate risk coefficients according to national guidelines in Costa Rica. The concentrations of herbicides diuron and ametryn and insecticides carbofuran, diazinon, and <b>ethoprophos</b> exceeded either the HC 5 value or the lower limit of its 90 % confidence interval suggesting toxic risks above accepted levels. Risk coefficients of diuron and carbofuran derived using local guidelines indicate toxicity risks as well. The assessed fungicides did not present acute toxic risks according to our analysis. Overall, these results show a possible toxicity of detected pesticides to aquatic organisms and provide a comparison of Costa Rican national guidelines with more refined methods for risk assessment based on SSDs.

Southern root-knot {{nematodes}} (Meloidogyne incognita-RKN) {{are among}} the most destructive plant pathogens and are infectious on a range of crops, including lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus), a crop vital to the Mid-Atlantic Region vegetable industry. Control of root-knot nematode (RKN) cannot be limited to crop rotation or the fallowing of fields due to an extensive host range and survival characteristics that enable the pathogen to persist in the soil, even in non-ideal conditions. In relatively recent years, the most effective chemical nematode controls, such as methyl bromide, organophosphate and carbamate nematicides, were found to be harmful to the environment and to non-target soil biota, leading to a reduction or even prohibition of their usage, spurring a revival in research to control RKN. ☐ In this research, the effects of new chemicals, biologicals, and cultural practices on RKN populations were examined. Chemical controls on RKN populations and lima bean plants were studied, in multiple greenhouse and microplot experiments. Emergence of lima bean seedlings was negatively affected by <b>ethoprophos,</b> but RKN galling and populations were significantly reduced, often as the best performing nematicide in the experiments. Two new nematicides, fluensulfone and fluopyram, reduced RKN galling compared to the untreated control. Spirotetramat, applied as a foliar treatment, performed equivalent to the control in every experiment (no significant effect). In addition, the use of biofumigant mustard and sorghum cover crops, which can reduce RKN levels by releasing compounds that react in the soil with an end-product resulting in natural fumigation, were investigated with findings that support the widespread use of ‘Dwarf Essex’ rapeseed in the region to control RKN. Cultural approaches also impacted RKN populations. Organic matter additions showed small but significant reductions in RKN galling with high rates of compost and chicken manure.
