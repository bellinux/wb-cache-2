25|$|Fritz Todt {{died in a}} {{plane crash}} on 8 February 1942, shortly after a meeting with Hitler in East Prussia. Todt had become {{convinced}} that the war on the eastern front could not be won and thought himself independent <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> as much to Hitler. As a result, there has been some speculation that Todt's death was a covert assassination, but this has never been substantiated.|$|E
25|$|The Lake Bafu profile {{shows the}} {{replacement}} of deciduous oak and pine with maquis species: Phillyrea, Cistus, Ericaceae; fruit trees: Olea, Castanea; and farm weeds: Plantago lanceolata and Juniperus. Carbon in the sediment suggests the forest was cleared by slash and burn. This period corresponds to the settlement of the Carians in the area, who apparently moved in from southern Anatolia. There is a semi-legendary tradition that they subdued another Pre-Hellenic people, the Leleges, but the evidence is not precise <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> if the indigenes were all or partly Leleges. As the Carians worshipped Endymion, {{he may have been}} brought in at this time.|$|E

30|$|In {{making such}} decisions, {{it is not}} <b>enough</b> just <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that {{expenditures}} in a given area are meritorious; {{they need to be}} more meritorious than other expenditures. It is not <b>enough</b> just <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that actions in a given area benefit the beneficiaries of the program; the concern needs to be with social benefits to all members of society, not just those members of society who participate in the program in question. And it is not <b>enough</b> just <b>to</b> look at benefits; equal attention needs to be paid to costs, both the direct costs of the action under consideration but also the opportunity cost – that is, what will not be undertaken, because this program is undertaken.|$|R
25|$|They {{discover}} it {{on a nearby}} moon and destroy it by tricking the platforms to fire on their own power supply. On the station, Dax is visiting the Bajoran Temple to thank the Prophets for her pregnancy. Dukat, possessed by the Pah-wraith, suddenly transports in. Dax goes for her phaser but he hits her with bolts of energy from his hands and she collapses. He opens an orb of the prophets and the energy leaves his body, entering the orb which turns black. Outside the station, the Bajoran wormhole implodes. Dukat, back to his old self, apologises to Dax and departs the station. The crew of the Defiant are informed of the attack and rush back to the station. When they arrive, they are informed that the wormhole is gone and all the Bajoran orbs have turned dark. Bashir says {{that he was able}} to save the Dax symbiont but not Jadzia. She survives long <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> goodbye to Worf. Over Jadzia's coffin, Sisko says that he has to leave the station and announces that he is returning to Earth. He departs with his son, Jake (Cirroc Lofton), leaving Major Kira Nerys (Nana Visitor) in charge of DS9.|$|E

500|$|In {{the theory}} of distributions, a {{generalized}} function is considered not a function in itself but only in relation to how it affects other functions when [...] "integrated" [...] against them.

[...] If the delta function is already understood as a measure, then the Lebesgue integral of a test function against that measure supplies the necessary integral.|$|E

Alistair jumps back in time again by {{only a few hours}} to complete the modified power calculations based on Walter's comments, and to prepare a pre-addressed letter he brings with him. As the SWAT team barges in, Alistair re-engages his time machine. Alistair's modifications have worked, as he finds himself in the field, minutes before his fiancée's death.

American scientists returned to Mongolia in 1990, and a joint Mongolian-American {{expedition to the}} Gobi, led by the American Museum of Natural History and the Mongolian Academy of Sciences, turned up several well-preserved skeletons. One such specimen, IGM 100/980, was nicknamed [...] "Ichabodcraniosaurus" [...] by Norell's team because the fairly complete specimen was found without its skull (an allusion to the Washington Irving character Ichabod Crane).

500|$|Barbirolli {{is remembered}} as an {{interpreter}} of Elgar, Vaughan Williams and Mahler, {{as well as}} Schubert, Beethoven, Sibelius, Verdi and Puccini, and as a staunch supporter of new works by British composers. Vaughan Williams dedicated his Seventh and Eighth Symphonies to Barbirolli, whose nickname, [...] "Glorious John", comes from the inscription Vaughan Williams wrote {{at the head of}} the score of the Eighth: [...] "For glorious John, with love and admiration from Ralph." [...] Barbirolli did not disdain lighter repertoire.

The town shipyard was submerged under three feet of water, and the town's clinic was moved from its interim location in the fire station to the town airport after floodwater threatened the station. Town leaders encouraged residents to evacuate to higher ground until the flood receded. Nenana High School was saved from flooding by just eight inches of elevation.

500|$|In 1863–1864 {{during the}} American Civil War, Edward {{traveled}} through Europe, taking {{the opportunity to}} visit the most esteemed museums and societies of the time. Initially, he seemed interested in helping out at a field hospital, but in letters to his father {{later on in the}} war, this aspiration seemed to disappear; instead Edward considered working in the American South to assist freed African Americans. Davidson suggests [...] Edward's correspondence with Leidy and Ferdinand Hayden, who worked as field surgeons during the war, might have informed Edward of the horrors of the occupation. Edward was involved in a love affair; his father did not approve. Whether Edward or the unnamed woman (whom he at one point intended to marry) broke off the relationship is unknown, but he took the breakup poorly. Biographer and paleontologist Henry Fairfield Osborn attributed Edward's sudden departure for Europe as a method of keeping him from being drafted into the Civil War. Cope did write to his father from London on February 11, 1864, [...] "I shall get home in time to catch and be caught by the new draft. I shall not be sorry for this, as I know certain persons who would be mean <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that I have gone to Europe to avoid the war."
