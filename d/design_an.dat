The Comet's high cabin pressure and fast operating speeds were unprecedented in commercial aviation, making its fuselage <b>design</b> <b>an</b> experimental process. At its introduction, Comet airframes would be subjected to an intense, high-speed operating schedule which included simultaneous extreme heat from desert airfields and frosty cold from the kerosene-filled fuel tanks, still cold from cruising at high altitude.|$|E
5|$|Frank Brittan sold Linwood House to Hiorns in 1889, who {{commissioned}} architect John Whitelaw to <b>design</b> <b>an</b> extension.

5|$|Arthur Compton, the {{chairman}} of the University of Chicago physics department, coordinated the uranium research of Columbia University, Princeton University, the University of Chicago, and the University of California, Berkeley. To remove disagreement and duplication, Compton transferred the scientists to the Metallurgical Laboratory at Chicago. Teller was left behind at first, because while he and Mici were now American citizens, they still had relatives in enemy countries. In early 1943, the Los Alamos laboratory was established in Los Alamos, New Mexico to <b>design</b> <b>an</b> atomic bomb, with Oppenheimer as its director. Teller moved there in March 1943. Apparently, Teller managed to annoy his neighbors there by playing the piano late in the night.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, Compton was a {{key figure}} in the Manhattan Project that {{developed}} the first nuclear weapons. His reports were important in launching the project. In 1942, he became head of the Metallurgical Laboratory, with responsibility for producing nuclear reactors to convert uranium into plutonium, finding ways to separate the plutonium from the uranium and to <b>design</b> <b>an</b> atomic bomb. Compton oversaw Enrico Fermi's creation of Chicago Pile-1, the first nuclear reactor, which went critical on December 2, 1942. The Metallurgical Laboratory was also responsible for the design and operation of the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Plutonium began being produced in the Hanford Site reactors in 1945.|$|E
5|$|General Dynamics and BAE Systems, who {{received}} contracts in the Ground Combat Vehicle program, criticized the CBO report, saying {{they used the}} wrong vehicle in its analysis. Officials from both companies said they used the wrong notional model of the GCV that did {{not account for the}} change in requirements made by the Army or the advancements made in the technology development phase of the program. They also criticized the comparisons of the other vehicles. The report factored cost, survivability, mobility, and lethality, ranking the GCV's capabilities as lower than all others. The Army questioned the suitability of existing <b>design.</b> <b>An</b> Army test of currently fielded vehicles in 2012 revealed that some met critical GCV requirements, but none met enough without needing significant redesign. They also note that lethality was judged with a 25mm cannon for analysis, before the Army planned to mount a 30mm cannon. The CBO report did give credit to cost, assuming the Army's goal of $13 million per vehicle. However, Pentagon cost assessments estimated the price at $16–$17 million per vehicle.|$|E

5|$|In practice, the {{flexibility}} which the OBO design allows has gone largely unused, as these ships tend {{to specialize in}} either the liquid or dry bulk trade. Also, these ships have endemic maintenance problems. On one hand, due to a less specialized <b>design,</b> <b>an</b> OBO suffers more from wear and tear during dry cargo onload than a bulker. On the other hand, components of the liquid cargo system, from pumps to valves to piping, tend to develop problems when subjected to periods of disuse. These factors have contributed to a steady {{reduction in the number}} of OBO ships worldwide since the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|Mir was {{authorized}} on a 17 February 1976 decree, to <b>design</b> <b>an</b> improved {{model of the}} Salyut DOS-17K space stations. Four Salyut space stations had been launched since 1971, with three more being launched during Mirs development. It was planned that the station's core module (DOS-7 and the backup DOS-8) would be equipped {{with a total of}} four docking ports; two {{at either end of the}} station as with the Salyut stations, and an additional two ports on either side of a docking sphere at the front of the station to enable further modules to expand the station's capabilities. By August 1978, this had evolved to the final configuration of one aft port and five ports in a spherical compartment at the forward end of the station.|$|E

In February 2012, the Marine Corps received the first Block C Ospreys; these aircraft feature a new radar, along with additional mission management and electronic warfare equipment. In 2015, options for upgrading all aircraft to the V-22C standard were examined.|$|E
40|$|We {{develop a}} method that enables {{cognitive}} processes to be analysed quantitatively without having a conceptual framework {{in place at the}} start of the research. With current methods, the general structure of the cognitive process in question has to be known before quantitative analyses can be preformed. With the method, we studied the cognitive process of weighting the importance of attributes in a purchasing decision. Our approach consists of seven steps: determining the research method (in our case: the think-aloud method); <b>designing</b> <b>an</b> experiment; <b>designing</b> <b>a</b> data collection method; <b>designing</b> <b>a</b> tool for preliminary analysis; <b>designing</b> <b>a</b> tool for qualitative analysis; <b>designing</b> <b>a</b> tool for quantitative analysis; assessing external validity.

5|$|The game's open world {{setting was}} {{modelled}} on Los Angeles {{and other areas}} of Southern California. Much of the development work constituted the open world's creation, and the proprietary Rockstar Advanced Game Engine (RAGE) was overhauled to increase its draw distance render capabilities. Key team members conducted field trips around Southern California to gather research and footage, and Google Maps projections of Los Angeles were used to help design the city's road networks.

5|$|Unaware of this, Hugh DeWitt, a {{physicist}} at the Lawrence Livermore nuclear weapons laboratory, forwarded a copy to Chuck Hansen. Hansen was a computer programmer from Mountain View, California, who collected information about nuclear weapons as a hobby. He had run a competition to <b>design</b> <b>an</b> H-bomb, the winner {{of which would be}} the first person to have their design classified by the DOE. It now began to occur to him that his hobby might not be legal. On August 27, He wrote a letter to Senator Charles H. Percy detailing how much information he had deduced from publicly available sources. This included his own design, one not as good as Morland's, which Hansen had not seen. Hansen further charged that government scientists—including Edward Teller, Ted Taylor, and George Rathjens—had leaked sensitive information about thermonuclear weapons, for which no action had been taken. In this, Hansen was mistaken: Taylor had indeed been reprimanded, and Teller was not the source of the information that Hansen attributed to him. Hansen made copies of his letter available to several newspapers.|$|E

5|$|The {{choice of}} {{plutonium}} for the fissile {{component of the}} bomb meant that Penney's HER team at Fort Halstead had to <b>design</b> <b>an</b> implosion-type nuclear weapon. The Los Alamos Laboratory had solved the problem of doing this with explosive lenses. The involvement of several British scientists gave HER a solid base of experience to work from. The British design would hew {{to that of the}} American Fat Man as closely as possible. An important change would be the substitution of RDX, an ARD product, for Composition B as the fast explosive component of the lenses; Baratol would still provide the slow component. This was handled by the explosives experts at Woolwich, who devised the machining processes and produced prototypes of the lenses and moulds. Production was then handled by two Royal Ordnance Factories. The first lenses were delivered in 1952, and there were enough for two sets for the Operation Hurricane assemblies. Woolwich provided the supercharge, the spherical shell of explosive that encases the tamper. Test firings of explosive lenses were conducted at Foulness by a team under the direction of Roy Pilgrim. To achieve near-simultaneous detonations of the lenses, the Americans had developed the exploding-bridgewire detonator; this had to be duplicated. Ernest Mott and Cecil Bean developed them, while Challens devised the firing circuits.|$|E
