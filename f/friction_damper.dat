To efficiently simulate the friction contact, a full- 3 D time-discrete contact model is reformulated and an analytical expression for the Jacobian matrix is derived {{that reduces the}} computation time drastically {{with respect to the}} classical finite difference method. The developed numerical solver is applied on bladed disks with shroud contact and the advantage of full- 3 D contact model compared to a quasi- 3 D contact model is presented. The developed numerical solver is also applied on bladed disks with strip <b>damper</b> and multiple <b>friction</b> contacts and obtained results are discussed. Furthermore, presence of higher harmonics in the nonlinear contact forces is analyzed and their effect on the excitation of the different nodal diameters of the bladed disk are systematically presented. The main parameters that influence the effectiveness of <b>friction</b> <b>damping</b> in bladed disks are engine excitation order,  contact stiffnesses,  friction coefficient, relative motion at the friction interface and the normal contact load. Due to variation in these parameters during operation, the obtained <b>friction</b> <b>damping</b> in practice may differ from the optimum value. Therefore, to control the normal load adaptively that will lead to an optimum damping in the system despite these variations, use of magnetostrictive actuator is proposed. The magnetostrictive material that develops an internal strain under the influence of an external magnetic field is employed to increase and decrease the normal contact load. A linearized model of the magnetostrictive actuator is used to characterize the magnetoelastic behavior of the actuator.   A nonlinear static contact analysis of the bladed disk reveals that a change of normal load more than 700 N can be achieved using a reasonable size of the actuator.
