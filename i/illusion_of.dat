5|$|Time is also {{connected}} {{to the theme of}} light and dark. In Shakespeare's day, plays were most often performed at noon or in the afternoon in broad daylight. This forced the playwright to use words to create the <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> day and night in his plays. Shakespeare uses references to the night and day, the stars, the moon, and the sun to create this illusion. He also has characters frequently refer to days of the week and specific hours to help the audience understand that time has passed in the story. All in all, no fewer than 103 references to time are found in the play, adding to the <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> its passage.|$|E

5|$|Among {{the various}} {{patterns}} and motifs found in Delian mosaics is the triple-colored lozenge {{that creates a}} three-dimensional <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> cubes in perspective for the viewer. This pattern appears in fifteen different locations, {{making it one of}} the most common. Other motifs include waves and stepped triangles, while major themes include maritime, theatrical, natural, or mythological objects and figures. The single wave pattern, a common motif in Hellenistic art, is the most predominant type of border design for mosaics at Delos and appear in mosaics of Arsameia (albeit arranged in the opposite direction). The rosette motif, which is found in the mosaics of various Hellenistic sites across the Mediterranean, is often coupled with single-wave borders in Delian mosaics. The typical Hellenistic palmette motif is used in a mosaic of Delos to fill the four corners around a central rosette motif. The <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> three-dimensional relief in the figured scenes of Delian mosaics was usually achieved by the use of polychrome, with white, black, yellow, red, blue and green hues.|$|E

5|$|It's {{about how}} people take drugs to connect to God or {{to a higher level}} of consciousness. I keep saying, 'Plugging into the matrix'. If you get high, you can do that, which is why a lot of people drop acid or do drugs, because they want to get closer to God. But there's going to be a short circuit, and that's the <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> drugs, because they give you the <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> getting closer to God, but {{ultimately}} they kill you. They destroy you. I mean, I tried everything once, but as soon as I was high, I spent my time drinking tons of water {{to get it out of}} my system.

5|$|The fourth movement, in sonata form {{but with}} {{characteristics}} of a rondo, is replete with Haydnesque false recapitulations and conclusions. In one example, the music lands in the tonic {{at the end of}} the recapitulation and apparent coda, and is followed by two measures of complete silence, creating an <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> finality. However, the main theme is then reprised, and the real conclusion to the work follows some 20 measures later.|$|E
5|$|A {{technique}} was developed that combined the front projection effect with specially designed zoom lenses.

The apse in which she sits adds to the <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> depth and is an expanded area for her throne. A similar approach {{can be seen in}} the later Dresden Triptych, but that work contains a better handling of spatial depth; Mary's throne is moved back, and the donors and saints are relegated to wing panels. The figures in Canon van der Paele are within a more confined space, are somewhat cramped, but far more monumental.|$|E

40|$|Effective {{leadership}} in organizations is predicated {{not only on}} technical, but also social competence (Barry & Crant, 2000; Huselid, 1995; Pfeffer & Veiga, 1999; Weick, 1979). Leaders rely heavily on their social interactions and relationships with others to succeed in organizational contexts. As a result, leaders {{need to be able}} to establish relationships and alliances to effectively engender acceptance and compliance from others. However, leaders often fail to establish effective alliances and consequently are unable to successfully lead and maintain their power. This dissertation investigates the psychological processes that inhibit the ability of powerholders to effectively form alliances and maintain power. Specifically, I examine the impact <b>illusions</b> <b>of</b> alliance, which I define as the overestimation of the strength of one's alliances with others, on the loss of power. I argue that powerholders who hold <b>illusions</b> <b>of</b> alliance fail to promote and develop effective alliances, and ultimately lose power. Moreover, building from the literature on the psychological effects of power, I also argue that power itself increases the propensity to hold <b>illusions</b> <b>of</b> alliance. This deleterious effect of power might explain why power is often said to lead to its own demise. In two studies, I found that power increases the propensity to hold <b>illusions</b> <b>of</b> alliance. In Experiment 1, I investigated the impact of self-perceptions of dispositional power on <b>illusions</b> <b>of</b> alliance in long-term project teams that met over several months. As hypothesized, I found that individuals who believed they were dispositionally powerful also tended to hold <b>illusions</b> <b>of</b> alliance. In Experiment 2, to examine the causal role <b>of</b> power on <b>illusions</b> <b>of</b> alliance, I experimentally primed high (or low) power among individuals engaged in long-term project teams and found that individuals primed with high power were more likely to hold <b>illusions</b> <b>of</b> alliance as compared to those primed with low power or controls. In a separate set of studies, I also found that powerful individuals lose power to the extent that they hold <b>illusions</b> <b>of</b> alliance. In Experiment 3, I developed a task in which three individuals of varying power participated in a coalition building exercise. Participants in the high power role who overestimated their alliances were more frequently excluded from the final coalition. In Experiment 4, to examine the causal role <b>of</b> <b>illusions</b> <b>of</b> alliance, I used a similar coalition building task and manipulated the extent to which the high power actor held <b>illusions</b> <b>of</b> alliance. As in the previous study, high power actors who held <b>illusions</b> <b>of</b> alliance were excluded from the coalition more frequently. Taken together, these findings address one way in which powerholders fall from positions of power. Specifically, while most accounts of power loss focus on ethical breaches or performance deficiencies, my findings speak to the social and interpersonal dynamics that lead individuals to lose power. I argue that the possession of power increases the propensity to form <b>illusions</b> <b>of</b> alliance, and that such illusions lead to the loss of power. By overestimating the strength of their alliances with others, powerholders fail to effectively form and maintain alliances. In addition to examining the psychological effects of power, these findings have important implications for a number of outcomes critical to leaders and other organizational actors, including selection, turnover, and the development of leadership competencies...|$|R

For example, some of the Nostromo corridors were created from portions of scrapped bomber aircraft, and a mirror was used to create the <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> longer corridors in the below-deck area. Special effects supervisors Brian Johnson and Nick Allder made many of the set pieces and props function, including moving chairs, computer monitors, motion trackers, and flamethrowers.|$|E
5|$|In the {{original}} text, Mohini {{is referred to}} as simply an enchanting, female form of Vishnu. In later versions, Mohini is described as the maya (<b>illusion)</b> <b>of</b> Vishnu. Later still, the name of the avatar becomes Mohini from {{the original}} phrase describing his deliberate false appearance (mayam ashito mohinim). Once the Mohini legend became popular, it was retold, revised, and expanded in several texts. The tales of Mohini-Vishnu also increased among devotional circles in various regions. The same expanded Mahabharata version of the story is also recounted in the Bhagavata Purana in the 10th century CE. Here, Mohini becomes a formal avatar of Vishnu.|$|E
5|$|Masaccio {{is often}} {{compared}} to contemporaries like Donatello and Brunelleschi as {{a pioneer of}} the renaissance, particularly for his use of single-point perspective.

Both the mountains in the background, and the figure of Peter on the left are dimmer and paler than the objects in the foreground, creating an <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> depth. This technique was known in ancient Rome, but was considered lost until reinvented by Masaccio.|$|E

5|$|Quad {{have now}} brought out five {{generations of the}} classic {{electrostatic}} design. Originally designed for monaural sound in a domestic context, the popularisation of stereophonic sound prompted the manufacturer to modify the electrostatic panels to improve their stereo dispersion. These speakers featured larger panels and a revolutionary stator design, made up of eight concentric rings fed from the centre outwards through analogue delay lines, so that the audio signal gives the <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> radiating from a point source one foot behind the panel.|$|E
5|$|Thayer's {{original}} argument, restated by Cott, {{was that}} nature did {{the exact opposite}} with countershading that an artist did with paint when creating the <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> solid three-dimensionality, namely counteracting the effect of shade to flatten out form. Shading is a powerful cue used by animals in different phyla to identify the shapes of objects. Research with chicks showed that they preferred to peck at grains with shadows falling below them (as if illuminated from above), so both humans and birds may make use of shading as a depth cue.|$|E
