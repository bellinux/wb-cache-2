5|$|If an {{employee}} does {{make such a}} disclosure, Section 2 inserts a new Section 47B, providing that the employee shall suffer no detriment in their employment as a result. This includes both negative actions {{and the absence of}} action, and as such covers discipline, dismissal, or failing to gain a pay rise or access to facilities which would otherwise have been provided. If {{an employee}} does suffer a detriment, he is permitted to make a complaint before an <b>employment</b> <b>tribunal</b> under Section 3. In front of an <b>employment</b> <b>tribunal,</b> the law is amended in Sections 4 and 5 to provide compensation, and to reverse the burden of proof; if an employee has been dismissed for making a protected disclosure, this dismissal is automatically considered unfair. Similarly, under Section 6, an employee cannot be given priority when discussing redundancies simply because he made such a disclosure. These sections take into account Section 7, which notes that there is no requirement of age or length of employment before they come into effect.|$|E

5|$|In the United Kingdom, the Daily Mirror {{newspaper}} printed {{pictures of}} Arsenal fans {{alleged to have}} been part of the violence. It later arose that the majority of the people in the photos were either not involved or had been acting in self-defence. The photos led to some postmen working for Royal Mail losing their jobs because they had been seen in the photos and in television coverage, even though they had not been arrested. Michael Doherty, the chairman of the Communication Workers Union, and his brother Tom took Royal Mail to an <b>Employment</b> <b>Tribunal</b> for unfair dismissal claiming they had been acting in self-defence. In 2001, the tribunal ruled in their favour, and ordered Royal Mail to reinstate them. In 2012, the editor of the Daily Mirror at the time, Piers Morgan apologised for printing the pictures.|$|E

5|$|The Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998 (c.23) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom {{that protects}} whistleblowers from {{detrimental}} treatment by their employer. Influenced by various financial scandals and accidents, {{along with the}} report of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, the bill was introduced to Parliament by Richard Shepherd and given government support, on the condition that it become an amendment to the Employment Rights Act 1996. After receiving the Royal Assent on 2 July 1998, the Act came into force on 2 July 1999. It protects employees who make disclosures of certain types of information, including evidence of illegal activity or damage to the environment, from retribution from their employers, such as dismissal or being passed over for promotion. In cases where such retribution takes place the employee may bring a case before an <b>employment</b> <b>tribunal,</b> which can award compensation.|$|E

40|$|<b>Employment</b> <b>tribunals</b> {{were first}} {{established}} {{to provide a}} cheap and accessible service for the quick resolution of legally based employment disputes. With the decline of collective industrial relations {{and the growth of}} legislation on individual <b>employment</b> rights, <b>employment</b> <b>tribunals</b> have acquired a new prominence. However, in doing so <b>employment</b> <b>tribunals</b> have also been heavily criticized for becoming too legalistic and formal. This article takes issue with this tendency to criticize the work of <b>employment</b> <b>tribunals.</b> It closely investigates the role of the <b>Employment</b> Appeals <b>Tribunal</b> (EAT) in Ireland and finds that while it has become legalistic it still {{plays an important role in}} employment standard-setting. The article argues that employment relations systems in Anglo-Saxon countries are increasingly rights-based and that bodies like the EAT now play a key role in the functioning of such systems...|$|R
50|$|One {{peculiarity}} of the <b>employment</b> <b>tribunals</b> {{is that a}} {{claim for}} breach of contract cannot be brought until the employee's employment has ended, and a claim can only be brought if it arises or is outstanding on the termination of <b>employment.</b> The <b>employment</b> <b>tribunals</b> also can only hear certain types of claim for breach of contract, under the <b>Employment</b> <b>Tribunals</b> (Extension of Jurisdiction) Orders 1994, which are Statutory Instruments.

25|$|The main {{method of}} {{enforcement}} of labour law {{is through the}} <b>Employment</b> <b>Tribunal.</b> A fee must be paid to submit a claim.

Industrial tribunals were judicial bodies {{consisting of a}} lawyer, who was the chairman, an individual nominated by an employer association, and another by the Trades Union Congress (TUC) or TUC-affiliated union. These independent panels heard and made legally binding rulings in relation to employment law disputes. Under the Employment Rights (Dispute Resolution) Act 1998, their name was changed to <b>employment</b> <b>tribunals</b> from 1 August 1998. <b>Employment</b> <b>Tribunals</b> continue to perform the same function as the Industrial Tribunals.|$|R

25|$|In October 2004, Sarah Forsyth {{claimed that}} she had been {{dismissed}} unfairly by Eton College and had been bullied by senior staff.

An <b>employment</b> <b>tribunal</b> in July 2005 found {{that she had}} been unfairly dismissed and criticised Burke for bullying her and for repeatedly changing his story. It also criticised the school for failing to produce its capability procedures and criticised the Head Master for not reviewing the case independently.|$|E
25|$|Ed Balls, Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families, {{ordered an}} {{external}} inquiry into Haringey Council Social Services. The inquiry {{was not to}} examine the 'Baby P' case explicitly, but look into whether Haringey Social Services were following correct procedures in general. This report was presented to ministers on 1 December 2008. During a press conference that day, the Minister announced that, in an unusual move, he had used special powers to remove Sharon Shoesmith from her post of head of children's services at Haringey Council. She rejected calls for her resignation, saying {{that she wanted to}} continue to support her staff during the investigations, but was dismissed on 8 December 2008, by Haringey Council, without any compensation package. Shoesmith later brought legal proceedings against Ed Balls, Ofsted, and Haringey Council, claiming that the decisions which led to her dismissal were unfair. The High Court dismissed this claim in April 2010, although Shoesmith was still entitled to pursue an action for unfair dismissal in an <b>employment</b> <b>tribunal.</b> In May 2011, Shoesmith's appeal against that succeeded in the Court of Appeal; the Department of Education and Haringey Council said they intended to appeal to the Supreme Court against this decision. Their applications for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court were refused on 1 August 2011. It was reported by BBC News on 29 October 2013 that Sharon Shoesmith agreed to a six-figure payout for unfair dismissal.|$|E

500|$|MI6 {{dismissed}} him on 22 May 1995 {{as he came}} to the end of {{his extended}} probationary period. Tomlinson's probationary period had been extended over the standard six-month duration due to his senior line manager's doubts about his personality. Tomlinson claimed that he had become suicidally depressed following the death of his long-term girlfriend from cancer and that he had been suffering from post-traumatic stress after witnessing violence against a civilian during the Siege of Sarajevo, and that MI6 had been ill-equipped to handle his condition. MI6 argued that he was dismissed for [...] "not being a team player, lacking motivation and having a short-term interest in the service", but later conceded that he had experienced a [...] "personality clash" [...] with his senior line manager. Another reason given for his dismissal was for [...] "going on frolics on his own". Tomlinson claims that no formal reason for his dismissal was ever given, and that he was mid-assignment when he suddenly found himself barred from entering MI6 headquarters. Friends suggested that he was sacked after he complained about MI6's [...] "unethical" [...] tactics. Tomlinson argued that his supervisors had unfairly disregarded his personal circumstances. Tomlinson disputed the reasons for and legality of his dismissal and attempted to take MI6 before an <b>employment</b> <b>tribunal.</b> However, MI6 obtained a public-interest immunity certificate from the Foreign Secretary, Malcolm Rifkind. Having no further legal recourse to appeal against his dismissal, Tomlinson left the United Kingdom, and pursued his arguments against MI6 by publishing articles in the international press protesting his treatment, whilst working on a book detailing his career in the Service.|$|E
