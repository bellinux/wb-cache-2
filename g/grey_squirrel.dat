5|$|In many species, the molars are {{relatively}} large, intricately structured, and highly cusped or ridged. Rodent molars are well equipped to grind food into small particles. The jaw musculature is strong. The lower jaw is thrust forward while gnawing and is pulled backwards during chewing. Rodent groups {{differ in the}} arrangement of the jaw muscles and associated skull structures, both from other mammals and amongst themselves. The Sciuromorpha, such as the eastern <b>grey</b> <b>squirrel,</b> have a large deep masseter, making them efficient at biting with the incisors. The Myomorpha, such as the brown rat, have enlarged temporalis muscles, making them able to chew powerfully with their molars. The Hystricomorpha, such as the guinea pig, have larger superficial masseter muscles and smaller deep masseter muscles than rats or squirrels, possibly making them less efficient at biting with the incisors, but their enlarged internal pterygoid muscles may allow them to move the jaw further sideways when chewing. The cheek pouch is a specific morphological feature used for storing food and is evident in particular subgroups of rodents like kangaroo rats, hamsters, chipmunks and gophers which have two bags that may range from the mouth {{to the front of the}} shoulders. True mice and rats do not contain this structure but their cheeks are elastic due to a high degree of musculature and innervation in the region.|$|E

For the zoonotic pathogen Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, the agent of Lyme borreliosis, recent work shows invasive rodent species can be of high epidemiological importance and may support host specific strains. This study examined the role of <b>grey</b> <b>squirrels</b> (Sciurus carolinensis), (n= 679), an invasive species in the United Kingdom (UK), as B. burgdorferi s. l. hosts. We found that <b>grey</b> <b>squirrels</b> were frequently infested with Ixodes ricinus, the main vector of B. burgdorferi s. l. in the UK, and 11. 9 % were infected with B. burgdorferi s. l. All four genospecies which occur in the UK were detected in <b>grey</b> <b>squirrels,</b> and unexpectedly, the bird associated genospecies B. garinii, was most common. The second most frequent infection was with B. afzelli.

25|$|Animal {{diversity}} is modest, {{as a result}} of factors including the island's small land area, the relatively recent age of the habitats developed since the last glacial period and the island's physical separation from continental Europe, and the effects of seasonal variability.

A DEFRA (Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs) study from 2006 suggested that 100 species have become extinct in the UK during the 20th century, about 100 times the background extinction rate.

40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. Behavioural flexibility has been argued to be an evolutionarily favourable trait that help invasive species to establish themselves in non-native environments. But few studies have compared the level of flexibility (whether considered as an outcome or as a process) in mammalian invaders and related native species. Here, we tested whether flexibility differs between groups of free-ranging invasive Eastern <b>grey</b> <b>squirrels</b> (Sciurus carolinensis) and native Eurasian red squirrels (S. vulgaris) in the UK, using an easy and a difficult food-extraction task. All individuals of both species showed flexibility, at the outcome level, in solving the easy task and solution time was comparable between species across a series of successes. A higher proportion of <b>grey</b> <b>squirrels</b> than red squirrels solved the difficult task. However, for those squirrels that did solve the task, solving efficiency was comparable between species on their first success, and a few red <b>squirrels</b> outperformed the <b>grey</b> <b>squirrels</b> in subsequent successes. Between species analysis showed that instantaneous flexibility, flexibility at the process level that was measured as the rate of switching between tactics after a failed attempt, was higher in red <b>squirrels</b> than in <b>grey</b> <b>squirrels.</b> Within species analysis also revealed that red squirrel problem solvers showed higher flexibility at the process level, than their non-solver counterparts. Non-solvers also failed to make ‘productive’ switches (switching from ineffective tactics to effective tactics). Together, {{the results suggest that}} problem-solving ability overlaps in the two species, but is less variable, and on average higher, in <b>grey</b> <b>squirrels</b> than in red squirrels. The superior behavioural flexibility of the <b>grey</b> <b>squirrels,</b> shown here by success at problem solving, may have facilitated their invasion success, but it may also have resulted from selective pressures during the invasion processThis project is supported by the Postgraduate Research Enhancement Fund from University of Exeter and Gilbert’s private fund...|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to competition for resources, {{the spread of}} the <b>squirrel</b> poxvirus from <b>grey</b> <b>squirrels</b> to reds is thought to be {{a major factor in the}} decline of red <b>squirrel</b> populations. <b>Grey</b> <b>squirrels</b> do not die from the squirrelpox virus and can infect red squirrels causing the appearance of scabs and lesions on the face, feet, and genitals and eventually death. In Great Britain, <b>grey</b> <b>squirrels</b> have been able to spread 17-25 times faster through competitive exclusion of the red squirrel due to increased mortality of reds from the squirrelpox virus. In fact, the virus works so quickly in killing its host after infection that seeing a red squirrel with poxvirus is uncommon even though the disease may be highly prevalent in a red squirrel population. The full consequences of these interactions cannot be completely determined, though the difference in population density and weight of the two species may have an effect on energy flow in ecosystems.|$|R

40|$|In {{heterogeneous}} environments, differential niche selection by {{two competing}} species {{will result in}} niche partitioning so that individuals of each species can maximise their fitness under different sets of environmental variables. Thus, niche partitioning is considered essential to allow co-existence of ecologically related species. To assess whether niche partitioning was occurring between native red <b>squirrels</b> and alien <b>grey</b> <b>squirrels</b> living together in a 13 -ha high-quality mixed deciduous woodland in north Italy, we investigated temporal and spatial patterns in their activity and foraging behaviour between 1996 and 1998. We used live trapping and radio-tracking to study numbers, distribution and behaviour of squirrels. Daily and seasonal temporal activity patterns, and activity {{on the ground and}} in the trees, were similar in the two species. However, <b>grey</b> <b>squirrels</b> were more tree specialists and had a narrower tree-species niche width than red squirrels, in particular making greater use of oak. Other studies of red and <b>grey</b> <b>squirrels</b> in allopatry show that the two species differ in the extent they utilise oak. Overall, tree-species niche overlap was about 70 %. <b>Grey</b> <b>squirrels</b> had larger home ranges than red squirrels. Home ranges and core areas of both species were larger in males than females. Also, intraspecific home range and core-area overlap patterns were similar to those found in allopatric populations of these species. Overall, {{there was no evidence that}} the use of space of one species was affected by the other. Our results show that there was no niche partitioning of activity or foraging behaviour in time or space during the study. This suggests that, at moderate grey-squirrel densities, red squirrels are unable to avoid competition with <b>grey</b> <b>squirrels,</b> and that competition for food and/or space will occur when these resources become limiting...|$|R

40|$|Introduced hosts populations {{may benefit}} of an "enemy release" through {{impoverishment}} of parasite communities made of both few imported species and few acquired local ones. Moreover, closely related competing native hosts {{can be affected}} by acquiring introduced taxa (spillover) and by increased transmission risk of native parasites (spillback). We determined the macroparasite fauna of invasive <b>grey</b> <b>squirrels</b> (Sciurus carolinensis) in Italy to detect any diversity loss, introduction of novel parasites or acquisition of local ones, and analysed variation in parasite burdens to identify factors that may increase transmission risk for native red squirrels (S. vulgaris). Based on 277 <b>grey</b> <b>squirrels</b> sampled from 7 populations characterised by different time scales in introduction events, we identified 7 gastro-intestinal helminths and 4 parasite arthropods. Parasite richness is lower than in <b>grey</b> <b>squirrel's</b> native range and independent from introduction time lags. The most common parasites are Nearctic nematodes Strongyloides robustus (prevalence: 56. 6 %) and Trichostrongylus calcaratus (6. 5 %), red squirrel flea Ceratophyllus sciurorum (26. 0 %) and Holarctic sucking louse Neohaematopinus sciuri (17. 7 %). All other parasites are European or cosmopolitan species with prevalence below 5 %. S. robustus abundance is positively affected by host density and body mass, C. sciurorum abundance increases with host density and varies with seasons. Overall, we show that <b>grey</b> <b>squirrels</b> in Italy may benefit of an enemy release, and both spillback and spillover processes towards native red squirrels may occur...|$|R
40|$|If food {{pilferage}} {{has been}} a reliable selection pressure on food caching animals, those animals should have evolved the ability to protect their caches from pilferers. Evidence that animals protect their caches would support the argument that pilferage {{has been a}}n important adaptive challenge.
