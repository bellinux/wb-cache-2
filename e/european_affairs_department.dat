40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} effects of European integration on national level legislatures in European Union member states. Many economic and political decisions previously made by democratically elected national legislatures are now decided at a supranational, or European, level. National legislatures have responded to this change by increasing their oversight of <b>European</b> <b>affairs</b> in order to impose more democratic accountability and transparency into the opaque decision-making process of developing European legislation. While all national legislatures of European Union member states have established <b>European</b> <b>Affairs</b> Committees to help strengthen oversight of <b>European</b> <b>affairs,</b> there is considerable variation in the institutional strength and political control invested in these committees. I argue that the more recently a country joined the European Union, the more quickly the legislature will move to establish an oversight committee for <b>European</b> <b>affairs</b> and the more assertive its <b>European</b> <b>Affairs</b> Committee is likely to be. Cross-sectional statistical analysis shows {{a strong correlation between}} the timing of membership and the urgency with which the <b>European</b> <b>Affairs</b> Committee is established. There is also a strong correlation between timing of membership and a legislature's approach to parliamentary oversight of <b>European</b> <b>affairs.</b> Case studies on the German Bundestag, the Irish Oireachtas, and the German Bundesrat explore three different approaches to the oversight of <b>European</b> <b>affair...</b>|$|R
