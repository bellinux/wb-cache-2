5|$|Although McCarthy {{had been}} charged with first-degree murder, the judge allowed the <b>jury</b> <b>to</b> {{consider}} lesser charges of second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter. On June 26, 2017, the jury returned a verdict of second-degree murder and two days later he was sentenced to life imprisonment; he will be eligible for parole in 2037.|$|E
5000|$|It {{has been}} noted that [...] "no {{policeman}} has ever been convicted of murder or manslaughter for a death following police contact, though {{there have been more}} than 400 such deaths in the past ten years alone.". Although a number of these were determined (by inquest <b>juries)</b> <b>to</b> be suicides, other cases such as that of Ian Tomlinson, were found by inquest <b>juries</b> <b>to</b> be unlawful killings.|$|R

5|$|Garrow {{made much}} use of jury nullification {{to limit the}} {{punishment}} for his convicted clients, {{in a time when}} many crimes carried the death penalty (the so-called Bloody Code). In 1784 a pair of women were arrested for stealing fans worth 15 shillings, meaning a conviction would result in the death penalty; Garrow convinced the <b>jury</b> <b>to</b> convict the women of stealing 4 shillings worth of fans, therefore changing the sentence to twelve months of hard labour.|$|E
5|$|In its {{advertisement}} in The Economist, Steorn challenged {{scientists to}} form an independent <b>jury</b> <b>to</b> test their technology and publish the results. Within 36 hours of the advertisement being published, 420 scientists contacted Steorn and, on 1 December 2006, Steorn announced it had selected a jury. It was headed by Ian MacDonald, emeritus professor of electrical engineering at the University of Alberta, and the process began in February 2007.|$|E

5|$|James Device {{pleaded not}} guilty to the murders by {{witchcraft}} of Anne Townley and John Duckworth. However he, like Chattox, had earlier made a confession to Nowell, which was read out in court. That, and the evidence presented against him by his sister Jennet, who said that she had seen her brother asking a black dog he had conjured up to help him kill Townley, was sufficient to persuade the <b>jury</b> <b>to</b> find him guilty.|$|E
5|$|On 2 December 2013, {{after more}} than a year of {{testimony}} and over 12,000 pages of evidence, the presiding coroner instructed the <b>jury</b> <b>to</b> begin their deliberations, and requested they come back with a verdict in Smith's death and recommendations on means to prevent a recurrence of such an event.|$|E
5|$|On August 26, the {{day after}} the guilty verdict was reached by the jury, Judge Roan brought counsel into private {{chambers}} and sentenced Leo Frank to death by hanging with the date set to October 10.

5|$|On Tuesday 18 June {{the court}} opened at 9am; 12 {{defendants}} {{were charged with}} breaking into the house of Rebecca Waddelow in Littleport and stealing personal property and money. After hearing evidence, the judges held a discussion. Mr Justice Abbott informed the jury that a mistake {{had been made in}} the indictment, directing the <b>jury</b> <b>to</b> acquit. All 12 defendants were pronounced not guilty.|$|E
5|$|The inquest was {{frequently}} interrupted by multiple legal challenges {{and a change}} of coroner, before finally being terminated as a mistrial on 30 September 2011; a new inquest into Smith's death began on 19 September 2012. On 2 December 2013, the presiding coroner instructed the <b>jury</b> <b>to</b> begin their deliberations {{with respect to a}} verdict on Smith's death.|$|E
5|$|The jury {{never left}} the box, but instead conferred {{together}} and found Thornton not guilty in six minutes. They were then resworn on the rape allegation.

Thornton was set free.|$|E

50|$|The dissenting opinion, {{joined by}} Justices Ginsburg, Souter and Breyer, and written by Justice Stevens {{expressed}} concern that the decision set the disqualification bar for prospective jurors too low and in effect could cause <b>juries</b> <b>to</b> be more likely to vote for a death sentence.|$|R
5000|$|Rule 6 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure governs grand juries. It {{requires}} grand <b>juries</b> <b>to</b> {{be composed}} of 16 to 23 members and that 12 members must concur in an indictment. A grand <b>jury</b> is instructed <b>to</b> return an indictment if the probable cause standard has been met. The grand jury's decision is either a [...] "true bill" [...] (formerly billa vera, resulting in an [...] "indictment"), or [...] "no true bill".|$|R
5|$|The only {{surviving}} {{record of}} the trial is the speech given by Theomnestus and Apollodorus against Neaira and Stephanus, and the outcome is unknown. No records of Neaira exist after the trial. Modern commentators have noted the weaknesses in Apollodorus' arguments, though as the outcome of an Athenian trial depended heavily on what the parties involved could persuade the <b>jury</b> <b>to</b> accept, {{and how much of}} their dishonesty they could get away with, we cannot say for certain that the suit failed.|$|E
5|$|Without any {{discussion}} of the merits, 5-4, the Court held that the indictment stated offenses under ยง 1782 and that the evidence was sufficient for the <b>jury</b> <b>to</b> have convicted Burton. Justices Harlan, Brown, McKenna, Holmes, and Day were in the majority; Chief Justice Fuller, and Justices Peckham, Brewer, and White, were in dissent.|$|E
5|$|As a {{prominent}} figure in Portland he continually worked {{to raise funds}} for the library he supported. He would also rely on financial help from his associates in order to supplement his small salary as a federal judge. This allowed him to keep his personal appearance inline with what was expected of prominent citizens. In contravention to his earlier stances during the Oregon Constitutional Convention, Deady later denounced violence against Chinese Americans during the 1870s and 1880s, even convening a grand <b>jury</b> <b>to</b> examine charging anti-Chinese crowds with criminal acts. These crowds were threatening violence against these minorities in an attempt to expel the immigrants from the state.|$|E
50|$|The Court here {{limited the}} {{application}} of a rule laid down in Apprendi v. New Jersey and extended in Blakely v. Washington and Cunningham v.

50|$|However, the Fifth Amendment right <b>to</b> a grand <b>jury</b> {{indictment}} {{does not}} apply against the state governments because the grand jury provision has not been incorporated against the states by the Fourteenth Amendment. Thus, the information {{has always been the}} dominant charging document in the western U.S. states, where extremely dispersed population distribution during the American frontier era made it difficult to select and convene petit <b>juries</b> <b>to</b> hold trials. In that era, convening even larger grand <b>juries</b> just <b>to</b> indict criminals was seen as an unnecessary extravagance.|$|R
40|$|Jury nullification, that {{phenomenon}} whereby a jury returns a not-guilty verdict for {{a defendant}} it believes to be technically {{guilty of the}} alleged crime, is, obviously, a controversial issue. What {{is not a matter}} of controversy, however, is the fact that the law protects the <b>juryโs</b> ability <b>to</b> behave this way. Much of the controversy therefore centers on whether <b>juries</b> ought <b>to</b> be informed of this ability to nullify free from legal redress. In this paper I examine a number of arguments both for and against the view that <b>juries</b> ought <b>to</b> be, in the words of the literature, fully informed. In the end I conclude that there is significant empirical evidence to suggest that, rather than simply promoting justice and mercy, as proponents of the instruction argue, fully informing a jury has the unforeseen consequence of encouraging <b>juries</b> <b>to</b> behave in a manner I label bad-faith, and that such bad-faith juries in fact corrupt the principles of justice and fairness that are the cornerstones of the trial system...|$|R
5|$|Given Huskisson's importance, and the {{potential}} impact {{on the future of}} Liverpool and Manchester's industries and on the embryonic railway industry of any findings of liability {{on the part of the}} railway, a swift determination of the causes of the accident was considered essential. By 9.00am on the morning after the accident, a hastily convened coroner's jury was assembled in the Grapes public house in Eccles. The coroner himself, MrMilne, arrived at 10.00am and was in a hurry to proceed as he had another inquest scheduled that afternoon, but proceedings were unable to begin as Lord Wilton, the only sworn witness scheduled to attend the inquest, could not be found. In the meantime, Milne sent the <b>jury</b> <b>to</b> the vicarage to view Huskisson's body.|$|E
5|$|In 1856, Cleburne and Hindman {{were both}} wounded by gunshots during a street fight in Helena {{with members of}} the Know-Nothing Party {{following}} a debate. Cleburne was shot in the back, turned around and shot one of his attackers, killing him. The attackers hid until Cleburne collapsed on the street and then left. After the two recovered, they appeared before a grand <b>jury</b> <b>to</b> respond to all charges brought against them. They were exonerated and, afterward, went to Hindman's parents' house in Mississippi. By 1860, he was a naturalized citizen, a practicing lawyer, and very popular with the local residents.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Kentucky {{had wanted}} the <b>jury</b> <b>to</b> force NASCAR {{to grant the}} {{speedway}} a Sprint Cup Series event but in 2007 they changed their demand to instead force the France family to sell either NASCAR or ISC. The track is also demanding that NASCAR develop objective standards for the awarding of their race events and damages of $200 million. In January 2008, the court dismissed the lawsuit, saying that the plaintiffs had failed to make their case. Kentucky Speedway says they will appeal the court's decision.|$|E
