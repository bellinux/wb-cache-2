It maintains 14 kōban ("police boxes") within the ward and a substation near Hyogo Station.|$|E
5|$|Officially {{designated}} as Yeovil Municipal Borough in 1854, the town continued to lend {{its name to}} the area with the creation of the local government district of Yeovil on 1 April 1974, with the merging several neighbouring rural and urban districts, which is today known as South Somerset. Some of the suburbs <b>fall</b> <b>within</b> the civil parishes of Yeovil Without and Brympton.|$|E
50|$|Toorak <b>falls</b> <b>within</b> {{the federal}} {{electorate}} of Higgins.

At state level, it mostly <b>falls</b> <b>within</b> the electorate of Malvern (currently held by the Liberals' Michael O'Brien), with {{the western part of the}} suburb <b>falling</b> <b>within</b> the electorate of Prahran (currently held by Sam Hibbins on behalf the Australian Greens). At local council level, Toorak <b>falls</b> <b>within</b> the City of Stonnington.|$|R

50|$|After {{an impact}} event, the falling debris forms an ejecta blanket {{surrounding}} the crater. Approximately half {{the volume of}} ejecta <b>falls</b> <b>within</b> 1 crater radius of the rim, or 2 radii {{from the center of}} the crater. The ejecta blanket becomes thinner with distance and increasingly discontinuous. Over 90% of the debris <b>falls</b> <b>within</b> approximately 5 radii of the center of the crater. Ejecta which <b>falls</b> <b>within</b> that area is considered proximal ejecta. Beyond 5 radii, the discontinuous debris is considered distal ejecta.|$|R
5|$|The 1902 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season featured five known tropical cyclones, {{three of which}} made landfall in the United States. The first system was initially observed in the northwestern Caribbean Sea on June12. The last system dissipated on November6 while located well southeast of Newfoundland. These dates <b>fall</b> <b>within</b> the period with the most tropical cyclone activity in the Atlantic. None of the systems existed simultaneously.|$|E
5|$|The seeds {{maintain}} their germinative powers for decades, up {{to a hundred}} years, according to some studies. Because of this, and because the plant is an extremely prolific seed bearer (each plant produces hundreds of capsules, each containing up to 700+ seeds, with a total up to 180,000 or 240,000 seeds), it remains in the soil seed bank for extended periods of time, and can sprout from apparently bare ground, or shortly after forest fires long after previous plants have died. Its population pattern typically consists of an ephemeral adult population followed by {{a long period of}} dormancy as seeds. Great mullein rarely establishes on new grounds without human intervention because its seeds do not disperse very far. Seed dispersion requires the stem to be moved by wind or animal movement; 75% of the seeds <b>fall</b> <b>within</b> 1 m of the parent plant, and 93% <b>fall</b> <b>within</b> 5 m.|$|E
5|$|Adiantum viridimontanum largely reproduces asexually by {{branching}} {{rather than}} sexually through spores. While wind-blown spores {{can result in}} sexual reproduction for the species, most spores probably <b>fall</b> <b>within</b> a relatively short radius of the plant. In addition, reproduction through spore dispersal requires the spore to land in suitable conditions for generating a gametophyte, typically in bright sunlight on thin serpentine soils. These requirements allow A.viridimontanum to colonize recently disturbed sites on ultramafic outcrops, where bedrock has been exposed and competing plants have been removed. The populations appear stable, with the long life of individuals compensating for low recruitment rates.|$|E

5|$|Although {{sections}} 8 and 10 of the ISA concern {{matters of}} national security, the Court held that this concern {{does not preclude}} the objective review of executive discretion. Following the case of Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service (1983), the Court of Appeal decided that {{it is up to}} the courts to determine whether a decision is in fact based on grounds of national security. Similarly, it should also be within the court's purview to determine whether the matters relied upon in exercising powers under the ISA <b>fall</b> <b>within</b> the scope of purposes specified by sections8 and 10.|$|E
5|$|Dental anatomy is a {{field of}} anatomy {{dedicated}} {{to the study of}} tooth structure. The development, appearance, and classification of teeth <b>fall</b> <b>within</b> its field of study, though dental occlusion, or contact between teeth, does not. Dental anatomy is also a taxonomic science as it is concerned with the naming of teeth and their structures. This information serves a practical purpose for dentists, enabling them to easily identify teeth and structures during treatment.|$|E
5|$|English Heritage is a {{governmental}} {{body with a}} broad remit of managing the historic sites, artefacts and environments of England.

5|$|If two of {{the three}} given circles do not intersect, a center of {{inversion}} can be chosen so that those two given circles become concentric. Under this inversion, the solution circles must <b>fall</b> <b>within</b> the annulus between the two concentric circles. Therefore, they belong to two one-parameter families. In the first family (Figure7), the solutions do not enclose the inner concentric circle, but rather revolve like ball bearings in the annulus. In the second family (Figure8), the solution circles enclose the inner concentric circle. There are generally four solutions for each family, yielding eight possible solutions, consistent with the algebraic solution.|$|E
5|$|In 2010 {{more than}} 7,000 people claimed {{benefits}} in the Kirkcaldy area; around 90 fewer than in 2009 but 500 more than the pre-recession average for 2008. Recent Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) figures indicate that the most deprived datazone in Fife is Gallatown and Sinclairtown which has a rank of 82, meaning that it is amongst the 5% most deprived areas in Scotland. Linktown, Seafield, Hayfield, Smeaton and Templehall East areas in Kirkcaldy <b>fall</b> <b>within</b> the 5–10% banding of most deprived communities in Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{reported}} stations for box huckleberry <b>fall</b> <b>within</b> the Appalachian Mountains, ranging from central Pennsylvania in the north to eastern Tennessee in the south. However, the specimens located in Maryland and Delaware {{were found on the}} Atlantic Coastal Plain, and the single North Carolina station is in the Piedmont. Its scattered distribution suggests that the species once spread more broadly across North America, but was almost eradicated by glacial advances, surviving only where it escaped the ice in protected refugia.|$|E

Tolokonnikova subsequently filed an appeal with the Zubovo-Polyansky District Court in Mordovia, where she was imprisoned, and Alyokhina with the Berezniki District Court in Perm. Alyokhina's appeal was rejected on January 16, 2013, the judge stating that the presence of her child was already taken into account during her original sentence.|$|E
5|$|Players {{are first}} {{brought to the}} options screen, where the {{starting}} level, game speed, and music can be chosen. The initial level chosen is a value between zero and twenty that determines the number of viruses to clear, and the three-game speed options change how fast the capsules <b>fall</b> <b>within</b> the bottle. The player's score is {{based solely on the}} elimination of viruses and the chosen game speed, with bonus points for clearing more than 1 in a single line.
