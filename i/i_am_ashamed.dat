5|$|With Goya we do {{not think}} of the studio or even of the artist at work. We think only of the event. Does this imply that The Third of May {{is a kind of}} {{superior}} journalism, the record of an incident in which depth of focus is sacrificed to an immediate effect? <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>ashamed</b> to say that I once thought so; but the longer I look at this extraordinary picture and at Goya's other works, the more clearly I recognise that I was mistaken.|$|E

25|$|<b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>ashamed</b> of what I tell them: {{that they}} should indeed worry about making an {{accusation}} because what they fear is likely to come true. Not {{one of the women}} I have heard from had an outcome that was not worse for her than silence. One, I recall, was drummed out of the school by peer pressure. Many faced bureaucratic stonewalling. Some women said they lost their academic status as golden girls overnight; grants dried up, letters of recommendation were no longer forthcoming. No one was met with a coherent process that was not weighted against them. Usually, the key decision-makers in the college or university—especially if it was a private university—joined forces to, in effect, collude with the faculty member accused; to protect not him necessarily but the reputation of the university, and to keep information from surfacing in a way that could protect other women. The goal seemed to be not to provide a balanced forum, but damage control.|$|E

500|$|<b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>ashamed</b> {{to relate}} what Gallienus used often {{to say at}} this time, when such things were happening, as though jesting amid the ills of mankind. For when he was told of the revolt of Egypt, {{he is said to}} have exclaimed [...] "What! We cannot do without Egyptian linen!" [...] and when {{informed}} that Asia had been devastated both by the violence of nature and by the inroads of the Scythians, he said, [...] "What! We cannot do without saltpetre!" [...] and when Gaul was lost, he is reported to have laughed and remarked, [...] "Can the commonwealth be safe without Atrebatic cloaks?" [...] Thus, in short, with regard to all parts of the world, as he lost them, he would jest, as though seeming to have suffered the loss of some article of trifling service.|$|E

Of this <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>ashamed.</b> I used many means not to get shot and not to shoot [...] not once the worst means. But I would have used all means, all without exception, [...] had I been forced to do so: I wouldn't have said no to bribery or any other {{punishable}} acts. Many did just the same.|$|E

2500|$|Any illusions Naguib {{might have}} had {{about the nature of}} Farouk's rule {{evaporated}} on 4 February 1942 after a standoff at Abdeen Palace during World War II, in Cairo between the British and the king. In protest at Farouk's concessions to the British, allowing them to choose the Egyptian prime minister, Naguib sent in his resignation, saying that [...] "since the army was not called upon to defend Your Majesty, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>ashamed</b> to wear this uniform and ask your permission to resign.". On this occasion, Farouk turned down Naguib's resignation. He again attempted to resign in 1951 when Hussein Serri Amer, widely thought to be corrupt, was made head of the Coast Guard. Again, the resignation was refused.|$|E
2500|$|His mother {{wrote to}} him in horror: [...] "You know you are the Great Hope of the Family...if you do not like Service you can do {{something}} else...there are plenty of things Steady Young Men can do when they can write and read as you can...(the Army) is a refuge for all idle people...I shall name it to no one for <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>ashamed</b> to think of it...I would rather bury you than see you in a red coat." [...] On his first night in the Army he was so horrified by the rowdiness of the barrack room that he contemplated deserting, only to find that his civilian clothes, which had been parcelled up but not yet sent home, had already been stolen by another deserter.|$|E
2500|$|The message (and its {{trailing}} padding) became famous, {{and created}} some ill feeling, since {{it appeared to}} be a harsh criticism by Nimitz of Halsey's decision to pursue the decoy carriers and leave the landings uncovered. [...] "I was stunned as if I had been struck in the face", Halsey later recalled. [...] "The paper rattled in my hands, I snatched off my cap, threw it on the deck, and shouted something <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>ashamed</b> to remember", letting out an anguished sob. RADM Robert Carney, Halsey's chief of staff (who had argued strongly in favor of pursuing the carriers), witnessed Halsey's emotional outburst and reportedly grabbed him by the shoulders and shook him, shouting, [...] "Stop it! What the hell's the matter with you? Pull yourself together!" [...] Recognizing his failure, Halsey sulked in inactivity for a full hour while Taffy 3 was fighting for its lifefalsely claiming to be refueling his shipsbefore eventually turning around with his two fastest battleships, three light cruisers and eight destroyers and heading back to Samar, too late to have any impact on the battle.|$|E

2500|$|The poem's {{popularity}} came, in part, {{from the}} ambiguity over its race-related message. The narrator {{implies that the}} cheating of the Chinese man was no worse {{than that of the}} white man, but the irony was too subtle for general readers. The message matched one Harte had written elsewhere in exposing white people's hypocrisy. As he wrote later, the Chinese [...] "did as the Caucasian did in all respects, and, being more patient and frugal, did it a little better". Harte repeatedly opposed anti-Asian discrimination since as early as 1863, both privately and publicly. In 1866, for example, he wrote a letter defending the [...] "peaceable citizens" [...] of San Francisco's Chinatown who were [...] "patient under abuse, and that patience, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>ashamed</b> to say, they have to exercise continually in California". After the discovery of a murdered woman in Chinatown, whose cause of death was uncertain, Harte wrote, [...] "as her head was caved in it is thought by some physicians that she died of galloping Christianity of the malignant California type".|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the death}} of his {{father-in-law}} in May 1866, Custer returned to Monroe, Michigan, where he considered running for Congress. He took part in public discussion over the treatment of the American South {{in the aftermath of the}} Civil War, advocating a policy of moderation. He was named head of the Soldiers and Sailors Union, regarded as a response to the hyper-partisan Grand Army of the Republic (GAR). Also formed in 1866, it was led by Republican activist John Alexander Logan. In September 1866 Custer accompanied President Andrew Johnson on a journey by train known as the [...] "Swing Around the Circle" [...] to build up public support for Johnson's policies towards the South. Custer denied a charge by the newspapers that Johnson had promised him a colonel's commission in return for his support, but Custer had written to Johnson some weeks before seeking such a commission. Custer and his wife stayed with the president during most of the trip. At one point Custer confronted a small group of Ohio men who repeatedly jeered Johnson, saying to them: [...] "I was born two miles and a half from here, but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>ashamed</b> of you." ...|$|E
