5|$|The Guardian {{obtained}} a four-minute video on 21 April from an anonymous bystander {{who had been}} filming on Cornhill between 7:10 and 7:30pm. The footage shows Tomlinson standing behind a bicycle rack in Royal Exchange Passage with <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pockets,</b> {{and a group of}} advancing police officers. When a police dog approaches him, he turns his back. At that point, he is hit on the legs and pushed by the TSG constable, and can be seen scraping along the ground {{on the right side of}} his forehead. Eyewitnesses said they heard a noise as his head hit the ground. The IPCC sought an injunction against the broadcast of the video by Channel4 News, but a judge rejected the application. An image obtained by Sky News on 24 April appears to show bruising on the right side of Tomlinson's forehead. A head injury was recorded by the second and third pathologists.|$|E
25|$|During the First and Second World Wars {{there were}} large {{military}} {{camps in the}} town. In the First World War the camps were built to house 22nd Division, Kitchener's Third New Army. The south camp nearly encircled Seaford ladies college. In December 1914 there was a strike by a mainly Welsh regiment over the remoteness of the accommodation and mud. In 1919 two thousand Canadians rioted after {{one of them was}} beaten by a camp picket for walking with <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pockets.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1894, he bowled 422 overs {{for his new}} county, conceding just 516 {{runs and}} {{capturing}} 41 wickets. The following year, at Trent Bridge (when {{it was so cold}} that KS Ranjitsinhji kept <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pockets</b> and fielded the ball with his feet), Shaw bowled 100.1 five-ball overs as his former team accrued a gargantuan 726. He finally retired again two matches later, when Sussex drew against Middlesex, and only ever returned to the first-class scene in 1897 to play the Gentlemen of Philadelphia. He subsequently became a publican and died aged 64.|$|E

25|$|Much {{controversy}} surrounded Selig and {{his involvement}} in Bonds' all-time home run record chase. For months, speculation surrounded Selig {{and the possibility that}} he and Henry Aaron would not attend Bonds' games as he closed in on the record. Selig announced in July 2007 when Bonds was near 755 home runs that he would attend the games. Selig was in attendance for Bonds' record-tying home run against the San Diego Padres, sitting in Padres owner John Moores' private suite. When Bonds hit his 755th home run, Selig refused to applaud Bonds' accomplishment, instead choosing to keep <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pockets</b> and have a look of disdain on his face. Bud Selig also did not attend the San Francisco Giants' game on August 7 when Barry Bonds hit his record-breaking 756th home run against the Washington Nationals; after the event, Selig released a statement congratulating Bonds.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after his}} {{attempted}} arrest of the graffiti man, Harwood swung a coat at a protester, pulled a BBC camera{{man to the}} ground, used a palm strike against one man, and at 7:19 pm pushed another man to the ground for allegedly threatening a police dog handler. It was seconds after this that he saw Tomlinson standing with <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pockets</b> beside a bicycle rack, being told by police to move away. Harwood told the inquest he made a [...] "split-second decision" [...] that there was justification for engagement, then struck Tomlinson on the thigh with his baton and pushed him to the ground. He {{said it was a}} [...] "very poor push" [...] and he had been shocked when Tomlinson fell. Harwood made no mention of the incident in his notebook; he told the inquest he had forgotten about it.|$|E
500|$|On 20 February 2013, a {{video was}} {{released}} on the web depicting a supposed collaborator of [...] Valor por Tamaulipas, kneeling down and with <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pockets.</b> Beside him was a masked, camouflaged man with a firearm. The supposed collaborator said calmly, [...] "Please refrain from publishing any information – if not, this is the price you will pay." [...] After the kneeling man warned Internet users against collaborating with Valor por Tamaulipas, the gunman pulled the trigger and {{shot him in the}} head, apparently killing the man. The administrator of Valor por Tamaulipas responded by posting a message on Facebook and saying that he will not take a stance on the authenticity of the video, but stated that he does not recognize the man. Notinfomex blog website reported that the Gulf Cartel was behind the video, but the information and authenticity have not been officially confirmed.|$|E

500|$|The film's {{visual effects}} {{were created by}} Sony Pictures Imageworks, who collaborated with Bryan Singer on Superman Returns. The VFX company's two key goals were to {{accurately}} portray von Stauffenberg's injuries {{and to create a}} 1943 period look to Berlin. With many explosions and stunts seen in the film performed practically, the majority of the 800 computer-generated effects shots were used to portray von Stauffenberg's injuries. A digital version of Cruise's hand was designed, and VFX employees rotoscoped the hand in every movement it could make so the missing fingers were erased in the process. With many close-ups of von Stauffenberg's hand with missing fingers, the injuries were textured to look like actual scars, particularly based on surgical procedures from 1943. Cruise asked for advice on how to best move his hands so visual effects would be easier to apply, but some challenges, such as von Stauffenberg getting dressed on his own, were inescapable. According to VFX supervisor Richard R. Hoover, [...] "We know from historical accounts that von Stauffenberg didn't stick <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pockets</b> to try and hide his injuries." ...|$|E
2500|$|Krämer instead {{proposed}} as the [...] "most obvious source" [...] of Degas's composition a lithograph by Paul Gavarni: sheet number five from the Lorettes series, published in 1841 in Le Charivari. Gavarni {{was an artist}} greatly admired by Degas, who amassed a collection of some 2,000 of Gavarni's lithographs. Points of similarity between the print and Interior are described by Krämer: As in Degas's Le Viol, [...] has her back turned towards the man who {{stands in front of}} the door, his legs spread wide and <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pockets.</b> From above, as if contemplating his prize, his gaze is fixed on the woman who, significantly, is seated on an animal-skin rug. Not only is the man's posture reminiscent of Degas's painting, but the woman is also in a comparable pose, her right hand raised to her head, her garment sliding off her shoulder. Even the pictures on the wall and the discarded clothes on the sofa could have inspired Degas.|$|E
