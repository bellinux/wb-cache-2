Este trabalho avaliou os efeitos dos sistemas de preparo sobre as propriedades químicas e físicas do solo, em um experimento instalado em 1985. A área {{experimental}} vem sendo cultivada com culturas anuais em seis sistemas de preparo: semeadura direta (SD), arado de discos (AD), arado de aivecas (AA), grade pesada (GP), grade pesada + arado de discos (GP + AD) e grade pesada + arado de aivecas (GP + AA). O delineamento utilizado foi de blocos completos casualizados, com quatro repetições. As amostragens foram realizadas após a cultura do milho (safra 2001 / 02), nas profundidades de 0 - 5, 5 - 10 e 10 - 20 cm. As amostras de solo foram submetidas às análises químicas e físicas e as médias comparadas pelo teste de Tukey. Os sistemas de preparo influíram nas propriedades químicas e físicas do solo, com a maior parte das diferenças ocorrendo entre a SD e os demais sistemas. A densidade do solo foi superior na SD, em relação à dos demais tratamentos. Houve incremento nos valores de MO, pH, CTC efetiva, Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, K e P, na camada superficial da SD, em relação às demais profundidades. A semeadura direta apresentou valores de Al 3 + inferiores aos dos demais tratamentos, na camada de 0 - 5 cm de profundidade, e superiores aos dos tratamentos AD, GP e GP + AA, na camada de 10 - 20 cm. Os tratamentos AD, GP, GP + AD e GP + AA apresentaram valores de K superiores aos dos tratamentos SD e AA, na camada de 0 - 5 cm de profundidade. O tratamento SD apresentou teores de P disponível superiores aos dos demais tratamentos, na camada de 0 - 5 cm de profundidade e na média das três profundidades. Different tillage systems cause {{changes in}} the chemical, physical and biological attributes of a soil, requiring modifications in the requirements of fertilization and liming. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of tillage systems on chemical and physical attributes of a soil, in a long-term experiment installed in 1985. Since then, the soil has been cultivated with annual cultures and submitted to six tillage systems: no-tillage (SD), disc plow (AD), moldboard plow (AA), <b>heavy</b> <b>disc</b> <b>harrow</b> (GP), <b>heavy</b> <b>disc</b> <b>harrow</b> + moldboard plow (GP + AA) and <b>heavy</b> <b>disc</b> <b>harrow</b> + disc plow (GP + AD). The experimental design was in completely randomized blocks with four replications. Samplings were collected after the culture of maize (crop 2001 / 02), at depths of 0 - 5, 5 - 10 and 10 - 20 cm. Soil samples were submitted to chemical and physical analyses and the averages compared by the Tukey test. The tillage systems affected the chemical and physical attributes of a soil distinctly. Greatest differences were observed between the SD treatment and the others. SD showed higher bulk density values than the other treatments, in {{the average of the}} three depths. In the 0 - 5 cm layer of SD, increments of the medium values of organic matter, pH, cation-exchange capacity, exchangeable calcium, exchangeable magnesium, exchangeable potassium and phosphorus available were observed; in relation to the other depths. The aluminum value was smaller in the SD treatment in the 0 - 5 cm layer than the others; at the depth 10 - 20 cm, this value was higher than the treatments AD, GP and GP + AA. Treatments AD, GP, GP + AD and GP + AA showed higher values of exchangeable potassium than the treatments SD and AA, at the depth 0 - 5 cm. Treatment SD presented values of available phosphorus superior to the other treatments, at the depth 0 - 5 cm and in the average of the three depths...|$|E
40|$|Tillage {{involves}} great expense {{for many}} farmers today. Lowering machinery costs, fuel consumption and working hours per hectare can reduce total costs. However, {{this must be}} achieved without compromising the results of tillage. In a project {{carried out in the}} autumn of 2003, draught requirement and tillage outcomes were compared for different tillage implements during autumn sowing on a light soil and a heavy soil. The tillage implements used were mouldboard plough, shallow plough, stubble cultivator, heavy duty stubble cultivator with wing shares, tandem disc harrow and <b>heavy</b> <b>disc</b> <b>harrow</b> designed for shallow tillage. Except for the mouldboard plough, one and two passes were investigated for each implement. After primary tillage, the seedbed was prepared with a disc harrow for shallow tillage and a roller adapted for cultivation. Seed was drilled using a combi-drill with discs for shallow tillage. For each implement the fuel consumption was measured using an adapted tractor (Massey Ferguson 6290) with equipment for measuring fuel consumption. The equipment was calibrated to give the PTO effect for any combination of fuel consumption and engine speed. This effect was assumed to be equal to the effect available at the wheels. The drawbar power was calculated by subtracting power losses through wheel slip and rolling resistance. The draught requirement was calculated by dividing the drawbar power by the actual speed, which was measured during work. The actual working depth was calculated by measuring bulk density before tillage and then weighing the cultivated soil from a specific area. On the basis of the tillage depth, the working width and the draught requirements, it was possible to calculate the specific draught (force per cross-sectional tilled area, kN/m 2). The draught per metre working width (kN/m) was also calculated and used to calculate the fuel consumption per hectare for the different systems. Some of the cultivated soil from each line was sieved into different fractions, allowing the approximate surface area of the tilled soil (m 2 /kg) and the energy requirement for fracturing (J/m 2) to be calculated. After drilling, the soil surface was photographed and the images were analysed to calculate how much of the soil surface was covered with straw from the previous crop. To make a fair comparison of draught between different tillage implements, the actual working depth must be taken into consideration. The pre-set working depth is not an adequate parameter because the different implements do not leave equally uniform tillage bases. Therefore they till different volumes of soil at a particular pre-set working depth. The mouldboard plough and the shallow plough nearly always worked to the pre-set depth while the other implements always tilled to a shallower level than the pre-set depth. The mouldboard plough and the shallow plough had the lowest specific draught requirement. On the light soil, the specific draught did not differ much between the other implements. On the heavy soil, however, the specific draught was highest for the stubble cultivator and the heavy duty stubble cultivator with wing shares. The specific draught for the second pass was higher than that for the first pass for each implement because the actual working depth became very shallow. The mouldboard plough and the shallow plough were least effective at fracturing the soil, while there was little difference between the other implements. However, the tandem disc harrow and the <b>heavy</b> <b>disc</b> <b>harrow</b> designed for shallow tillage fractured the soil most effectively. The fracturing did not increase much after the second pass with any of the implements. The mouldboard plough and the shallow plough buried the straw best, while the direct drilling treatment left most straw on the soil surface. The differences between the other implements were low. The second pass did not seem to decrease the amount of straw on the soil surface. The tillage systems with the mouldboard plough and the shallow plough consumed the most fuel. Much of the fuel used in the overall tillage process is consumed in seedbed preparation. Both the tillage systems with the plough required more seedbed preparation than the other systems {{and that was one of}} the reasons why the fuel consumption was higher. The direct drilling system required the lowest amount of fuel. Of all the cultivation systems, those with one pass with the tandem disc harrow and the <b>heavy</b> <b>disc</b> <b>harrow</b> for shallow tillage consumed the least fuel. On the basis of all the parameters studied here, it is hard to identify an optimal tillage system. The choice depends on the prevailing conditions in the field in question. If there is a large amount of straw from the previous crop that is likely to cause problems, the mouldboard plough or the shallow plough are preferable because in such cases it is important to bury the straw well and this can justify the higher fuel consumption. The results of this study show that shallow ploughing (~ 11 cm) with either of the two ploughs requires a lower amount of fuel, fractures the soil better and buries the straw as well as deep ploughing (~ 20 cm). If the straw from the previous crop is not a problem, the system with the <b>heavy</b> <b>disc</b> <b>harrow</b> for shallow tillage or the heavy duty stubble cultivator with wing shares is preferable since both these implements give high soil fracturing and slicing across the entire working width, killing weeds effectively...|$|E
40|$|Shallow {{cultivation}} to a {{depth of}} 5 - 7 cm has in the last years become a realistic alternative to common ploughless tillage (cultivation depth 1 0 - 15 cm), especially in Great Britain, France and Germany. Shallow cultivation means avoiding unnecessary soil loosening, preserving the soils natural structure, increasing activity in the top layer and decreasing fuel consumption with less power requirement. Two years ago VäderstadVerken AB developed a tillage tool for shallow cultivation called Rexius Carrier with System Disc. The tool consists of a heavy roller and a front tool called Systern Disc. The front tool includes two rows of concave, close mounted discs, which combined with a trave 1 ing speed of 10 - 14 km/h leaves a well leveled, 100 % work through, top layer. The aim of this thesis was to test shallow cultivation with Rexius Carrier under Swedish conditions, as autumn cultivation and as spring cultivation after a catch crop. This thesis includes the results of three different series of field experiments. The first, "Minimized autumn tillage to a spring crop", R 2 - 4122, was started in the autumn 2000. The result of the trial showed the highest yield for mouldboard ploughing and the lowest for the shallow cultivation, with deeper ploughless tillage in between. The second series, "Spring seeding without autumn tillage, including a catch crop", R 2 - 4123, was started in the spring of 2001. The series contained three experiments on sites with different clay contents, and compared autumn and spring ploughing with ploughless tillage to different depths and with different tillage intensities. The shallow cultivation performed well in this comparison. Despite a less suitable seedbed, plant establishment and crop yield in the shallow cultivated plots was nearly as high as for autumn ploughing. The weed population was greatly reduced in the shallow cultivated plots. The spring ploughed plots had less sui 1 able seedbed properties, poorer germination, more weed and lower crop yield than autumn ploughed plots. The third series, "Shallow cultivation to winter seed", started in the autumn of 200 1. In this series conventional mouldboard ploughing was compared with shallow cultivation with Rexius Carrier, chisel ploughing with and without roller and <b>heavy</b> <b>disc</b> <b>harrow</b> with and without roller. Before the second cultivation the germination of weeds and volunteers was counted, without any differences between different treatments. Before the seeding, the amount of straw and stubble on the surface was compared using digital image analysis. No differences between the treatments were found. After the seeding, the seedbed properties and the plant establishment was determined. Due to the large amount of rain that fell in the autumn, which had an equalizing effect on the analyzed parameters, {{no significant differences between the}} treatments were found. The trials has shown that only shallow cultivation before seeding can give good opportunities for the following crop. The trial R 2 - 4123 showed that shallow spring cultivation after a catch crop can maintain harvest yield compared to conventional mouldboard ploughing. Shallow autumn cultivation has a future as an alternative to conventional methods. The plant establishment were quite comparable despite the large amount of rain that fell in the autumn...|$|E

In this study, the long-term (2006 - 2014) effects of six tillage systems on aggregate-associated SOC were investigated in a field experiment conducted under Mediterranean conditions. The tillage treatments were; conventional tillage with residue incorporated in the soil (CT 1), conventional tillage with residue burned (CT 2), reduced tillage with heavy tandem disc-harrow (RT 1), reduced tillage with rotary tiller (RT 2), reduced tillage with <b>heavy</b> tandem <b>disc</b> <b>harrow</b> fallowed by no-tillage (RNT) for the second crop, and no tillage (NT). The most frequently encountered aggregates in all tillage systems were at 4. 0 - 2. 0 mm size and the least frequently found aggregates were 1. 0 - 0. 5 mm. The mean weight diameter (MWD) value increased in the NT compared to the conventional tillage practices at the rates of 137 % and 204 %, respectively at 0 - 15 cm soil depth. Aggregate-associated SOC contents in 0 - 15 cm depth were higher under conservation tillage systems.

The implements used were a spring tine harrow, a cultivator-harrow with fairly rigid spring tines and a <b>disc</b> <b>harrow.</b> These implements {{were used in}} two, four and six runs. In addition, there was one treatment with spring ploughing and spring tine harrowing (two runs) and one treatment with rotary cultivation (one run). The experiments were carried out on light soils, rich in fine sand and silt. In one of the experiments, however, the soil had a clay content as high as 23 per cent. Among the <b>harrows,</b> the <b>disc</b> <b>harrow</b> gave the best mean yield result. Four runs gave the highest yield. The differenees were, however small. Ploughing in the spring did not increase the crop yield. The rotary cultivation gave a yield result {{as high as the}} best of the harrowed treatments...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{determining}} {{of reduced}} tillage techniques in green bean farming {{as a second}} crop after harvesting wheat was targeted. To this aim, four different soil tillage methods namely, heavy-duty <b>disc</b> <b>harrow</b> (HD), rotary tiller (ROT), heavy-duty <b>disc</b> <b>harrow</b> plus rotary tiller (HD+ROT) and no-tillage (NT) (seeding by direct drill) were examined. Experiments were arranged in a randomized block design with three replications. The highest green beans yields were obtained in HD+ROT and NT as 5, 862. 1 and 5, 829. 3 Mg/ha, respectively. The lowest green bean yield was found in HD as 3, 076. 7 Mg/ha. The highest fuel consumption was measured 30. 60 L ha- 1 for HD+ROT whereas the lowest value was found 7. 50 L ha- 1 for NT. No tillage method gave the best results for fuel consumption and effective power requirement. It is concluded that no-tillage method {{can be used in}} second crop green bean in the Thrace Region due to economic and erosion conditions...|$|R
50|$|The disc {{for cooking}} the meats {{is usually a}} <b>disc</b> <b>harrow</b> made of either iron or steel. Shaped like a Chinese Wok, the disc {{provides}} an even heat distribution ideal for cooking. The cast iron also provides a robust, earthy flavor to food cooked in this fashion. The original concave disc shape is unaltered, however the disc can have handles or a tripod welded to it for easy access.|$|R
50|$|There {{are four}} general types of harrows: <b>disc</b> <b>harrows,</b> tine harrows (including spring-tooth harrows, drag harrows, and spike harrows), chain harrows, and chain-disk harrows. Harrows were {{originally}} drawn by draft animals, such as horses, mules, or oxen, {{or in some}} times and places by manual labourers. In modern practice they are almost always tractor-mounted implements, either trailed after the tractor by a drawbar or mounted on the three-point hitch.|$|R

Hitch-system cylinder is replaced as coupler with spring and damper characteristic in model. Dynamic force on coupler is obtained as simulation result and depending on it hydraulic pressure in hitch-system cylinder had been calculated. Simulation results are evaluated on basis of experimental investigations. Key words: tractor hitch system, pressure oscillation simulation...|$|R
40|$|A {{three years}} {{research}} project {{was developed to}} study tractor-implement dynamics in tillage operations. This paper reports the results of field tests performed under real working conditions, using four wheel drive tractors and trailed <b>disc</b> <b>harrows</b> combinations, under different soils conditions. The data show a linear relationship between the drawbar pull per unit of implement width and the fuel consumption ha- 1. The results give evidence {{of the benefits of}} the “gear up, throttle down” approach...|$|R
40|$|When {{a farmer}} tills a {{field with a}} wheel-supported <b>disc</b> <b>harrow</b> or pulls a loaded wagon through a soft field, the speed and {{efficiency}} of his operation depend {{on the relationship between}} each tire and the soil. This varies with different wheels, changing soil conditions, and other factors. The object of this research was to determine the variables involved and thus give common ground for the study and comparison of the tire-soil relationships causing rolling resistance...|$|R
50|$|A <b>disc</b> <b>harrow</b> is the {{preferred}} method of incorporating both agricultural lime (either dolomitic or calcitic lime) and agricultural gypsum, and disc harrowing achieves a 50/50 mix with the soil when set correctly, thereby reducing acid saturation in the top soil and so promoting strong, healthy root development. Lime does not move in the soil, and this poses a critical challenge to sustainable zero-till farming, especially considering that chemical fertilizers are generally used by farmers around the world.|$|R
40|$|Field {{experiments}} were done {{to measure the}} effect of different primary tillage methods on the CO 2 flux from soil and to evaluate the effect of conservation tillage tools on short-term CO 2 emissions. The {{experiments were}} conducted on a clay loam soil winter wheat field and a corn field. The three tillage treatments included stubble mulching (<b>disc</b> <b>harrow,</b> mulch tiller, chisel plough), primary tillage (<b>disc</b> <b>harrow,</b> moldboard plough, and chisel plough) and secondary tillage (combined seedbed maker). The control treatment was no-till with soil and residues left by the harvester. The CO 2 flux from the tilled soil surface was measured by a portable closed-chamber tester. Moldboard ploughing produced the roughest soil surface and the highest initial CO 2 flux and maintained the highest flux throughout the experiment. The moldboard ploughing caused higher CO 2 loss than less intensive tillage such as chisel ploughing, mulch cultivating, or disc harrowing. Primary tillage caused higher CO 2 emission in the fall than seedbed preparation did in the spring. These results support increased use of new and improved forms of conservation tillage equipment and offer a significant potential for preserving or increasing soil C levels while decreasing carbon dioxide emissions...|$|R
