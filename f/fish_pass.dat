2500|$|Gillnets are {{a series}} of panels of meshes with a {{weighted}} [...] "foot rope" [...] along the bottom, and a headline, to which floats are attached. By altering the ratio of floats to weights, buoyancy changes, and the net [...] can therefore be set to fish at any depth in the water column. In commercial fisheries, the meshes of a gillnet are uniform in size and shape. Fish smaller than the mesh of the net pass through unhindered, while those too large to push their heads through the meshes as far as their gills are not retained. This gives gillnets the ability to target a specific size of fish, unlike other net gears such as trawls, in which smaller <b>fish</b> <b>pass</b> through the meshes and all larger fish are captured in the net.|$|E
60|$|Their mode {{of taking}} salmon is curious. They build a weir across the stream, having an opening only in one place, {{at which they}} fix a basket, three feet in diameter, with the mouth made {{something}} like an eel-trap, through which alone the fish can find a passage. On the side of this basket is a hole, to which is attached a smaller basket, into which the <b>fish</b> <b>pass</b> from the large one, and cannot return or escape. This, when filled, is taken up without disturbing the larger one.|$|E
40|$|Six Borland <b>fish</b> <b>passes</b> {{were built}} since 1970 on dams in the rivers Douro and Tejo. Although <b>fish</b> <b>passes</b> have been built, fish migrations are still {{obstructed}} {{and the loss}} of fish passage is important in both rivers. The migratory species such as Alosa alosa, A. fallax, Petromyzon marinus, and Anguilla anguilla, still continue to arrive at Crestuma-Lever and Belver dams being caught every year by fishermen. Belver and Crestuma-Lever <b>fish</b> <b>passes</b> were studied in order to identify the main reasons for unsuccessful operation. Design and operation conditions of both <b>fish</b> <b>passes</b> are described. Monitoring with video cameras was done to count and identify all fish using these devices. Relationships concerning the number of <b>fish</b> and species <b>passing</b> in each cycle, the condition of operations of the powerstation and the water levels downstream were studied. Some failures were detected resulting in lack of attractiveness mainly concerning the lower gates and inappropriate entrance locations. Also the <b>fish</b> <b>passes</b> flow was found to be not enough for an appropriate attraction to the entrance. Modifications are suggested in order to improve the efficiency of both <b>fish</b> <b>passes...</b>|$|R
40|$|Many {{fish species}} {{undertake}} migrations {{as part of}} their basic behavior. In addition to the long migratory routes, many species of fish and other aquatic organisms migrate in the medium and short distances, especially from one part of the watercourse to the other. Migration can take place due to various reasons and factors in certain phases of life cycle of aquatic organisms. People have started to interrupt the longitudinal connectivity of watercourses by building barriers and dams for their own needs and so destroyed many centuries of migratory habits of aquatic organisms. The aim of the construction of <b>fish</b> <b>passes</b> is to mitigate the consequences of the building dams and barriers to achieve free passes for all aquatic organisms in rivers and streams. However It should be noted that every construction of a properly functioning <b>fish</b> <b>passes</b> is always just a second-best solution and does not replace natural connectivity. <b>Fish</b> <b>passes</b> are therefore structures that facilitate upstream and downstream migration of aquatic organisms over obstacles and barriers. <b>Fish</b> <b>passes</b> can be designed as technical <b>fish</b> <b>passes,</b> which are more artificial types or close-to-nature types. Both types of <b>fish</b> <b>passes</b> try to create the best possible imitation of natural conditions that are specific for watercourse in a particular area...|$|R

6000|$|Living in a trader's house {{everything}} {{is brought to}} me {{as well as to}} the rest,--bundles of smoked tripang, or [...] "beche de mer," [...] looking like sausages which have been rolled in mud and then thrown up the chimney; dried sharks' fins, mother-of-pearl shells, as well as birds of Paradise, which, however, are so dirty and so badly preserved that I have as yet found no specimens worth purchasing. When I hardly look at the articles, and make no offer for them, they seem incredulous, and, as if fearing they have misunderstood me, again offer them, and declare what they want in return--knives, or tobacco, or sago, or handkerchiefs. I then have to endeavour to explain, through any interpreter who may be at hand, that neither tripang nor pearl oyster shells have any charms for me, and that I even decline to speculate in tortoiseshell, but that anything eatable I will buy--fish, or turtle, or vegetables of any sort. Almost the only food, however, that we can obtain with any regularity, are fish and cockles of very good quality, and to supply our daily wants it is absolutely necessary to be always provided with four articles--tobacco, knives, sago-cakes, and Dutch copper doits--because when the particular thing asked for is not forthcoming, the <b>fish</b> <b>pass</b> on to the next house, and we may go that day without a dinner. It is curious to see the baskets and buckets used here. The cockles are brought in large volute shells, probably the Cymbium ducale, while gigantic helmet-shells, a species of Cassis, suspended by a rattan handle, form the vessels in which fresh water is daily carried past my door. It is painful to a naturalist to see these splendid shells with their inner whorls ruthlessly broken away to fit them for their ignoble use.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Gregarious {{behaviour}} {{is found}} throughout the animal kingdom. Although many fish species live in groups during {{a certain period of}} their life cycle, rarely has this collective behaviour been incorporated in fish passage studies, which tend to focus on individual behaviour of target species. Near <b>fish</b> <b>passes,</b> local hydrodynamics are highly variable, potentially affecting school cohesion. Since schooling has several drivers, such as antipredatory benefits and energy savings mechanisms, a loss of school integrity might be a reason <b>fish</b> <b>passes</b> act as an ecological trap for fish species that live in schools. An understanding of how hydrodynamics, encountered near <b>fish</b> <b>passes,</b> affect school cohesion and schooling behaviour is needed. A ‘back-to-basics’ study was executed that explored the response of fish schools to hydrodynamics in an experimental setting. The Common Minnow (Phoxinus phoxinus) was chosen, since it is a strong schooling species and abundant in English rivers. Minnows are quite similar in morphology and swimming movements to the important (migratory) salmonids and could therefore serve as a proxy. Movements of schools of two individuals were recorded in flowing and standing water, and their individual trajectories extracted from video data. Results show that minnows switch from a tandem configuration in standing water to a close side-by-side configuration in flowing water. Modelling work revealed that in this side-by-side configuration, energy savings could not be realised. It was concluded that fish aim to maximize information transfer when encountering flow and therefore have to rely on vision more than their lateral line system as the effectiveness of the latter is disturbed by the flow conditions. These findings suggest that passage of schooling fish is highly dependent on flow characteristics as these determine the success of collective movement and navigation through <b>fish</b> <b>passes...</b>|$|R
