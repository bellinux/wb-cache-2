50|$|Low {{awareness}} of the disease among China's general population {{appears to be a}} major culprit. Most Chinese consider HIV/AIDS as a <b>foreign</b> <b>issue,</b> and even educated people are less knowledgeable of the virus, its transmission and prevention, than people in other countries. Until recently, the use of condoms was not very common, even among sex workers and their clients. As a result, the epidemic has spread from high-risk groups (drug users, sex workers, unsafe blood donors) to the general population.|$|E

The first was the signature of the 1750 Spanish-Portuguese treaty, which re-established the borders set in the Treaty of Tordesillas. This moment was not a <b>foreign</b> <b>issue</b> policy of Brazil per se, but was instead a pursuit of interests by the Portuguese in their largest colony. There was, however, a notable Brazilian in the diplomatic corps, Alexandre de Gusmão, who directed the Portuguese foreign policy of trying to separate the Americas from the subject of European successions. The height of Gusmão's diplomatic effort was {{the signing of the}} Treaty of Madrid of 1750, in which territorial issues in South America were resolved.|$|E
50|$|On June 11, 2009, the British Overseas Territory of Bermuda {{accepted}} four Chinese Uighurs {{from the}} United States' detainment facility known as Guantanamo Bay detention camp {{located on the}} Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba. At {{the request of the}} United States Government, Bermudan officials agreed to host Khaleel Mamut, Hozaifa Parhat, Salahidin Abdulahat, and Abdullah Abdulqadirakhun as guest workers in Bermuda who seven years ago, were all captured by Pakistani bounty hunters during the United States-led invasion of Afghanistan in October 2001. This decision agreed upon by American and Bermudan officials drew considerable consternation and contempt by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office as it was viewed by British officials in London that they should have been consulted on whether or not the decision to take in four Chinese Uighurs was a security and <b>foreign</b> <b>issue</b> of which the Bermudian government does not have delegated responsibility over.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{contribution}} of foreign investors to capital market development in an emerging economy. The findings reveal that Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI) as well as <b>foreign</b> <b>issue</b> of securities (FS) made insignificant contribution to development of the market compared to other contending factors such as domestic securities investment (DSI) and domestic issue of securities (DS). This appears to constitute a policy challenge, considering the enormous gain that would accrue to the economy from increasing foreign participation in the market. The challenge could be surmounted by liberalising investment laws, offering fiscal incentives, and strengthening surveillance of the market to enhance efficiency. capital markets; emerging economies; market development; foreign participation; foreign investors; foreign portfolio investment; domestic securities investment; economic policies; liberalisation; investment laws; fiscal incentives; market surveillance; enhanced efficiency; Nigeria; monetary economics; finance. ...|$|E

40|$|Data mining plays {{important}} role in marketing and is quite new. Although this field expands rapidly, data mining is still <b>foreign</b> <b>issue</b> for many marketers who trust only their experiences. Data mining techniques cannot substitute the significant role of domain experts and their business knowledge. In the other words, data mining algorithms are powerful but cannot effectively work without the active support of business experts. We can gain useful results by combining these techniques and business expertise. For instance ability of a data mining technique can be substantially increased by combining person experience in the field or information of business can be integrated into a data mining model to build a more successful result. Moreover, these results should always be evaluated by business experts. Thus, business knowledge can help and enrich the data mining results. On the other hand, data mining techniques can extract patterns {{that even the most}} experienced business people may have missed. In conclusion, the combination of business domain expertise with the power of data mining techniques can help organizations gain a competitive advantage in their efforts to optimize customer management. Clustering algorithms, a group of data mining technique, is one of most common used way to segment data set according to their similarities. This paper focuses on the topic of customer segmentation using data mining techniques. In the other words, we theoretically discuss about customer relationship management and then utilize couple of data mining algorithm specially clustering techniques for customer segmentation. We concentrated on behavioral segmentation...|$|E
40|$|In {{spite of}} {{political}} changes than include {{the rise and}} fall of the Franco regime, the triumph of the Cuban Revolution, and the restoration of democracy in Spain, historical links have had and still have an influence on the continuation of a very specialrelationship between Spain and Cuba since the Spanish Civil War. Spain not only did not brake its diplomatic relation Cuba, but during the harshest periods of international isolation and ideological confrontation Madrid still became the primary economic partner of Havana in the capitalist world. Under the PSOE leadership, Spain's role in the pre-transition in Cuba, via aid and cooperation programs,impressive trade figures, and investment), has produced polemical debates with the opposition including threats of termination of aid in the event of a PP victory in the coming elections of March 1996. Spain's foreign policy toward Latin America has experienced an evolution from a policy of substitution and legitimation, to one of pressure. In the case of Cuba, justification for increased trade, aid, and political agreements seems to based on a more traditionalhistorical obligation, plus the added feature of doing fast business. However, the absence of clear accomplishments in the political arena have created a climate of frustration in Spanish diplomatic circles, which has resulted in leaks to the press and resignations. This added to the frequent verbal confrontations and discussions on the U. S. economic embargo, has converted the Cuban topic from a <b>foreign</b> <b>issue</b> to an "internal matter" of Spain. Finally, in spite of the active pressure that Spanish government has applied in Brussels during the second semester of 1995 as president of the European Union,the project of an agreement with Cuba received a delay when political liberalization did not meet European expectations. Only when the final stage of true political and economic transition takes place in Cuba, will the proper evaluation of Spain's role in the process be possible...|$|E
