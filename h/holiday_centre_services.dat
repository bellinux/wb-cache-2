25|$|A <b>holiday</b> <b>centre</b> is a {{facility}} that specializes in providing apartments, chalets and camping pitches for visiting holidaymakers. The center is run commercially, and visitors are not members and have no say in the management. Most holiday centers expect visitors to hold an INF card, that is, {{be a member of}} their national organization, but some have relaxed this restriction, relying on the carrying of a trade card. Holiday centers can be quite small, just a couple of hectares or large occupying over 300 hectares. In a large <b>holiday</b> <b>centre</b> there will be swimming pools, sports pitches, an entertainment program, kids' clubs, restaurants and supermarkets. Some <b>holiday</b> <b>centres</b> allow regular visitors to purchase their own chalets, and generations of the same families will visit each year. <b>Holiday</b> <b>centres</b> are more tolerant of clothing than members-only clubs; total nudity is usually compulsory in the swimming pools and may be expected on the beaches, while on the football pitches, or in the restaurants in the evening, it is rare.|$|R
