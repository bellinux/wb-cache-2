40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{insight into}} the testing of three-phase equipment exposed to voltage sags caused by faults. The voltage sag recovers at the fault-current zeros, leading to a `discrete' voltage recovery, that is, the fault is cleared in different steps. In the literature, the most widespread classification divides `discrete' sags into 14 types. The authors study shows that it is generally sufficient to consider only five sag types for three-phase equipment, here called `time-invariant (TI) ' equipment. As the remaining nine sag types cause identical equipment behaviour in Park or Ku variables, the number of laboratory tests (or of extensive simulations) on equipment under sags is reduced by a ratio of 14 / 5. The study is validated by simulation of a three-phase induction generator and a three-phase inverter, which are `TI', and a three-phase <b>diode</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>rectifier,</b> which is not `TI'.
