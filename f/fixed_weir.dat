40|$|Movable weirs {{have been}} {{developed}} to address the weaknesses of conventional <b>fixed</b> <b>weirs.</b> However, the structures for riverbed protection downstream of movable weirs are designed using the criteria of <b>fixed</b> <b>weirs</b> in most cases, and these applications cause problems, such as scour and deformation of structures, due to misunderstanding the difference between different types of structures. In this study, a hydraulic experiment was conducted to examine weir type-specific hydraulic phenomena, compare hydraulic jumps and downstream flow characteristics according to different weir types, and analyze hydraulic characteristics, such as changes in water levels, velocities and energy. Additionally, to control the flow generated by a sluice gate, energy dissipators were examined herein for their effectiveness in relation to different installation locations and heights. As a result, it was found that although sluice gates generated hydraulic jumps similar to those of <b>fixed</b> <b>weirs,</b> their downstream supercritical flow increased to eventually elongate the overall hydraulic jumps. In energy dissipator installation, installation heights were found to be sensitive to energy dissipation. The most effective energy dissipator height was 10 % of the downstream free surface water depth in this experiment. Based on these findings, it seems desirable to use energy dissipators to reduce energy, as such dissipators were found to be effective in reducing hydraulic jumps and protecting the riverbed under sluice gates...|$|R

40|$|Dams are {{critical}} infrastructures whose failure would entail serious consequences for community safety. Although large dams represent {{the most dangerous}} items, small size dams may be critical, as {{a large number of}} these constructions are built in the proximity to inhabited zones. Earthquake is one of the hazards that may affect an existing dam. To assess safety and plan investments, dam owners need to create prioritisation sequences of interventions through a protocol considering technical, political and societal aspects. It is presented herein a specific procedure, based on a multi-criteria analysis with a rapid screening survey of the infrastructures, which addresses to classify the seismic criticality of dams considering the effects (in terms of loss of life and property) of a failure scenario subsequent to an earthquake. A protocol is used to define a prioritisation of interventions that mitigate the seismic risk. It has been applied to a group of 9 small concrete dams and 17 <b>fixed</b> <b>weirs,</b> built from 1920 to 1990 in Aosta Valley (Italy). As a result, about 30 % of the existing dams, which are more vulnerable than <b>fixed</b> <b>weirs,</b> shows the highest level of seismic criticality, and needs to be retrofitted in accordance with the current standards...|$|R
50|$|Construction of {{the canal}} was overseen by {{architect}} John Nash, with James Morgan acting as supervising engineer. Hampstead Road Locks were built between 1818 and 1820, with the chambers made of brick and stone coping along the top. The two locks are arranged side by side, with an island platform between them. Each chamber has two gates at both ends, {{and they have been}} Grade II listed since 1992. They were the first of 12 pairs of similar locks which dropped the level {{of the canal}} by 96 ft to reach Limehouse Basin. The transfer of water between the chambers made operation of the locks more complex, and so they were permanently manned during the heyday of the canal, with lock-keepers working a shift system to provide 24-hour cover. As the use of the canal declined, in part due to railway competition, manning levels were reduced, and padlocks were used to prevent operation of the locks at the weekends. Following the end of commercial traffic and the growth of leisure boating, the locks reverted to operation by boat crews, and in order to prevent flooding caused by incorrect operation of the paddles, in the 1980s most of the pairs were converted to single locks, by replacing the lower gates of one chamber with a <b>fixed</b> <b>weir.</b> Hampstead Road Lock is the only one where both chambers have been retained, although they are now emptied conventionally. In November 2013, the locks were fully drained for maintenance; the public were invited for the weekend of the 16th and 17th of that month to see the infrastructure for themselves.|$|E

25|$|A {{spillway}} is {{a section}} of a dam designed to pass water from the upstream side of a dam to the downstream side. Many spillways have floodgates designed to control the flow through the spillway. There are several types of spillway. A service spillway or primary spillway passes normal flow. An auxiliary spillway releases flow {{in excess of the}} capacity of the service spillway. An emergency spillway is designed for extreme conditions, such as a serious malfunction of the service spillway. A fuse plug spillway is a low embankment designed to be overtopped and washed away {{in the event of a}} large flood. The elements of a fuse plug are independent free-standing blocks, set side by side which work without any remote control. They allow increasing the normal pool of the dam without compromising the security of the dam because they are designed to be gradually evacuated for exceptional events. They work as <b>fixed</b> <b>weirs</b> at times by allowing over-flow for common floods.|$|R

40|$|An {{advanced}} {{hydraulic model}} {{was developed by}} improving the numerical implementation of internal boundary condition and the pre-diction of scour depth to analyse hydraulic effects in operation of multi-function weir during the flooding season. The proposed model calculates overflow at <b>fixed</b> <b>weir</b> and gate discharge controlled by movable weir depending on the computed water stages on the upstream and downstream reach compared to conventional model applying internal boundary condition specified as prescribed stage or rating curve. In addition, it can predict time-dependent scour depth considering soil properties under unsteady state in order to investigate the hydraulic effects on bridge structure located downstream. A historical flood event was applied to demonstrate the ver-ification of the model as simulation results were compared with observations on monitoring station.

40|$|Modelling {{floodplains}} adequately {{is crucial}} for numerous water management applications. Many of these require {{a large number of}} simulations or long term calculations, thereby necessitating the use of models with a limited calculation time. This paper investigates two different flexible data-driven methods for computationally efficient lumped floodplain modelling that predict the inundation level in the floodplain and the flow between the river and the floodplain for a given set of river stages. The flow can be calculated using a set of optimized discharge equations. Alternatively, a hybrid approach can be followed that combines physical principles with neural networks that rely on water levels to obtain flow estimates. The derived methodology was tested on a case study using simulation results from a detailed MIKE 11 model that solves the full de Saint-Venant equations. The results show that both approaches deliver accurate results, although the neural networks outperform the <b>fixed</b> <b>weir</b> equations. At the same time, the simulations are more than 10. 000 faster compared to the original full hydrodynamic model. The obtained floodplain models can be used for various applications that require very short computation times. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Of {{the many}} factors {{that govern the}} {{settling}} phenomenon, the flow velocity in the settling tanks can be controlled favorably by <b>fixing</b> suitably designed <b>weirs</b> at the outlets of the tanks. The velocity at the bottom should not dislodge the particles that have already settled.

To achieve these types of velocity control, new proportional weirs have been designed. Very near to the outlet of the tank, over a small length, the flow was found to be turbulent and noncompliant with the expected type of velocity control.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to understand the effects of breach properties (e. g. the top width, the depth and the bottom width of the breach) on the breach flow. The breach flow was modeled as flow over a compound broad-crested weir. A laboratory experiment was carried out with a <b>fixed</b> <b>weir</b> model in a flume. Five cases with different breach properties were tested. Firstly, the discharge coefficients for all cases were quantitatively determined. The calibrations were done under two flow conditions, namely emerged flow conditions (flow only through the breach) and overtopping flow conditions (flow through the compound cross-section of weir). In perfect weir situations, {{it turned out that the}} values of the discharge coefficient were below 1 and rather different in the two flow conditions. Particularly in the case of overtopping flow, the linear combination of traditional discharge equations was verified for predicting the discharge and the discharge distribution over the weir. In imperfect weir situations, submergence coefficient was introduced in emerged condition. Secondly, the dependence of the energy head loss caused by the weir on the upstream discharge and the downstream water depth was discussed in imperfect weir situations. The Form Drag model for estimating the energy head loss was proved to be applicable for the modeled breach flow. Thirdly, the local hydraulic characteristics of breach flow were described by means of velocity distribution, water level elevation and flow patterns appearing behind the weir. At last, the numerical model (Delft 3 D) was verified on the modeling of the present experiment by comparing with the experimental data. The report provides the information for the breach flow which can be of use in the development of breach models, inundation models and compound weir design.

40|$|Introduction: Labyrinth weirs {{compare with}} {{straight}} weirs had required less freeboard in upstream {{so they are}} more appropriate for the irrigation networks. So they could maked more space to sotrage water and restrained foold with higher discharge. Labyrinths weirs have three generally form triangles, trapezoidal and rectangular that Tullis et al. (15) presented formula (3) for discharge coefficient of labyrinth weirs (triangles and rectangular) and a few studiescarried out on rectangular shape and its hydraulic characteristics are not specified. Therefore main aim of this paper study and characterized hydraulic characteristics of rectangular labyrinth weirs by using laboratory data. Materials and Methods: In this study rectangular labyrinth weir discharge and coefficient discharge relationships used dimensional analysis and experiment on hydraulic modeling, constant coefficient was defined. Laboratory flume is shown in Figure 2 (0. 5 m wide x 12 m long x 0. 8 m deep). Models was made from clear plexiglass plate with 10 cm thickness thatcuted using leaserdevice and the crest manualy shaped quadrant with radius 10 cm, all models using silicon glue install in the flume. The upstream depth readership by point gauge that installed in upstream of models. Discharge calcutaed byupsterm depth of triangular weir that installed in down stream of flume. Data were analyzed by SPSS software and to compare relationships with each other used two parameter {{root mean square error}} and correlation coefficient and charts darw in Excel Results and Discussion: discharge coefficient formula (11) carried out by using SPSS software that compared with formula (3). Results showed (Tables 2 and 3) that the correlation coefficient of formula (11) was more than a formula (3) and formula (11) RSME was less than formula (3) RSME except in first and fifth hydraulic model (rectengular 1 and 5) that they were almost equal. So the formula (11) was more accurate than a formula (3) to peredict discharge of flow in flume. In previous step we used all data, we saw flourmloa (11) had more accurate then we diceded data divided in to three groups: high change, length change and all that calculated correlation coefficient and RSME for formula (11) to figure out which group have more accurate, results was brought in table 4. The result showed that constant coefficient of formula (11) yields from all data was useful for the design proposed. Plotted discharge changes against H/P for rectangular labyrinth and straight weirs in Figs. 3 and 4. In constant discharge and high with raising length weir, decreased depth of flow over the weir because the effective weir length was raised and the ratio of distributed length to apex length (b) was decreased. As well as in constant H/P and high weir with raising apex length, discharge was increased that similarity of the results of Tullis et al. (15) and Khode et al. (8). In length, and the ratio H / P constant with increasing height in the discharge coefficient due to submergence reduce local side Jt Hay reduce interference, but increases with increasing height from 0. 20 to 0. 25 m m discharge coefficient decreases as flow rate and Weber number decreased {{as a result of the}} effect of surface tension and increased resistance to flow. In length, and the ratio H / P fixed amount of overflow discharge increases with increasing height as the ratio H / P value of the denominator increases and therefore increases the total height of the water upstream. For designoverflow rectangular labyrinth weirs recommends 0. 20 ≤H/P≤ 0. 40 that maximum aeration and discharge coefficient in this range is the result of Hay and Taylor (7) and Darvas (4) is consistent. In discharge and <b>fixed</b> <b>weir</b> height and maximum height of the water upstream directly at least equal to 1. 8 of the overflow stright weirs. So for the areas where there is a height restriction of water upstream, the water level upstream of rectangular labyrinth weirs less direct overflow weirs requires the use of this is recommended. Conclusion: The results showed the relationship (11) that uses most of effective parameters has more accurate results and proposed for design aim. In constant water head upstream discharge of labyrinth weir maximum 2. 6 times more than straight weir discharge and in constant discharge water head upstream of straight weir 1. 8 times more than upstream labyrinth weir water head so use a labyrinth weir appropriate for areas that have head and discharge restrictions. Best range of ratio H/P for of design was 0. 20 to 0. 40 and maxim coefficient discharge happened in this range...|$|E

40|$|A {{commonly}} used flood mitigation technique in coastal areas of Australia {{during the late}} 1960 ’s was the installation of one-way floodgates on flood mitigation drains. In regions affected by acid sulphate soils (the oxidation of pyrite in the soil forms sulphuric acid), the floodgates prevent tidal carbonate/bicarbonate buffering of the drains and thereby create reservoirs of acidic water (pH 3 ̆c 4. 5) that discharge during low tide. Several acid sulphate soil remediation techniques {{have been used in}} coastal lowland in southeastern NSW, Australia. Following extensive monitoring and finite element modelling of groundwater conditions and quality, <b>fixed</b> level v-notch <b>weirs</b> were installed at three elevations to maintain elevated groundwater levels. The weirs successfully maintained the groundwater level above the acid sulphate soils, preventing additional pyrite oxidation, and reduced the rate of discharge of acid to the drain. Following further monitoring, investigation into anaerobic acid sources, and finite element based geochemical modelling, modified two-way floodgates that allow tidal ingress were installed. The modified floodgates were successful in buffering the drain water pH before discharging the drain water into adjacent waterways. Numerical analysis based on FEM was extended to illustrate that saline intrusion into the surrounding soil (as a result of tidal ingress and acid buffering in the drains) was not a major concern for the pastureland or other agricultural activitie...|$|R
