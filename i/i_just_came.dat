500|$|Gomez later {{explained}} the loss {{by saying that}} [...] "it was all very simple, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>came</b> to a decision in there that I need to retire from boxing full stop". Gomez further indicated {{that he planned to}} pursue a career in bodybuilding. McDonagh, meanwhile, claimed that he had won because of Gellar's assistance leading up to the bout.|$|E
500|$|The 2012 Olympic 100m final was {{the fastest}} ever Olympic race with seven men under ten seconds. Bolt won in 9.63seconds and was {{followed}} by Yohan Blake. Gay's run of 9.80 meant that he missed out on a bronze medal by one hundredth of a second to compatriot Justin Gatlin. Gay was visibly upset about his failure to reach the Olympic podium and cried during the post-race interview, saying [...] "I felt like I ran with the field and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>came</b> up short". The 4 × 100 metres relay final brought Gay his first Olympic medal and an American record time of 37.04seconds alongside Trell Kimmons, Gatlin, and Ryan Bailey. Despite equaling the previous world record mark, the Americans took the silver medal behind Jamaica, whose team improved that record by two tenths of a second. However, he was later stripped of this medal after failing a drug test in 2013; this also cost {{the rest of the}} relay team their medals. In the last two Diamond League 100m races, he ran 9.83 as runner-up at the Athletissima meet, where Yohan Blake equalled Gay's personal best time, and false started at the Weltklasse 100m series final.|$|E
2500|$|Recording {{sessions}} {{began in}} late 1994, and proceeded midway through 1995 in RZA's basement studio in Staten Island, the same studio {{that many of}} the group's earlier albums were recorded in. In regard to Raekwon and Ghostface Killah's original recording intentions, RZA recounted [...] "They had wanted to go to Barbados. But when they got to Barbados, the racism was so crazy. It was on some slave mentality. The Blacks was being treated like shit. They stopped back, and everything was recorded in my basement. No engineer, no assistant engineer. I did everything on that shit. The only two albums I did with nobody fucking with me was Linx and Liquid Swords. I was on a mission. To make all those early albums took {{three and a half years}} of my life. I didn't come outside, didn't have too many girl relations, didn't even enjoy the shit. I just stayed in the basement. Hours and hours and days and days. Turkey burgers and blunts. I didn't know if it was working. But nobody could hear or say nothing, no comments, no touching the board when I leave. Everything was just how I wanted it." [...] Regarding the recording atmosphere, Raekwon stated [...] "The way RZA had it poppin' back then, we would come into his spot. It was like dudes would come in on their own time and create stuff. I remember <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>came</b> in, and the beats was just pumpin'." ...|$|E
