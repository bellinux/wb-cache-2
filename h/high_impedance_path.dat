40|$|High {{impedance}} faults (HIF) {{are defined}} as circumstances where the fault current drawn {{is not sufficient to}} trip conventional protective devices due to the <b>high</b> <b>impedance</b> <b>path.</b> HIF is a common occurrence in medium voltage distribution networks. The broken live conductors can be a hazard to personal safety. In most cases, high temperature arcing is associated with such faults which can lead to fire. Detection of HIF has been a challenging problem due to its low amplitude and complex dynamics. In this thesis, the recorded data from extensive experiments conducted in the UNSW High Voltage Laboratory and those obtained through HRL Technology Pty Ltd (Victoria) have been studied and summarized. Experiments were also conducted to study the feasibility of using the existing metering current transformers installed on distribution networks for HIF sensing (thus avoid the need for new sensors on the network). The distinctive features of arcing HIF were obtained from the data. An arc model based on the thermal differential equations has been simulated and optimised by using differential evolution method in MATLAB. The simulation results are compared and fitted with experimental arcing data. The standard IEEE test networks are chosen as benchmark for case study and several types of power transients are simulated as well which are used as discrimination signals. Detection algorithms based on the wavelet transform and neural network are proposed based on the integrated simulation system and verified using experimental arcing data. Both results show that the HIF can be accurately detected and reliably discriminated from other faults...|$|E

Since the terms low and high depend on context to some extent, it is possible in principle for some <b>high</b> <b>impedance</b> nodes to be described as low impedance in one context, and <b>high</b> <b>impedance</b> in another; so the node (perhaps a signal source or amplifier input) has relatively low currents for the voltages involved.|$|R

40|$|The {{common mode}} {{inductor}} {{is an integral}} part of most EMI filters; its very <b>high</b> <b>impedance</b> over a wide frequency range suppresses high frequency power supply spikes. Switching power supplies gener-ate two types of noise: common mode and differential mode. Differential mode noise (Figure 1 a) follows the same path as the input power. Com-mon mode noise (Figure 1 b) is rep-resented by spikes that are equal to and in phase with each other and have a circuit path through ground. To suppress EMI, a typical filter will include common mode induc-tors, differential mode inductors and X and Y capacitors. The Y capaci-tors and the common mode induc-tors contribute to the attenuation of the common mode noise. The induc-tors become <b>high</b> <b>impedances</b> to the <b>high</b> frequency noise and either re-flect or absorb the noise while the capacitors become low <b>impedance</b> <b>paths</b> to ground and redirect the noise away from the main line (Figure 2). To be effective, the common mode inductor must provide the proper impedance over the switching fre-quency range. Common mode inductors are wound with two windings of equal numbers of turns. The windings are placed on the core so that the line currents in each winding create fluxes that are equal in magnitude but op-posite in phase. These two fluxes cancel each other, leaving the core in an unbiased state. The differential mode inductor has only one wind...|$|R

This paper decomposed the transient signal in multi-scale by utilizing the good localization performance of the wavelet in both time domain and frequency domain, reconstructed the wavelet coefficients under each scale, took the wavelet reconstruction coefficient which was under the scale 3, calculated the size spectrum of each feeder line in timing floating window and identified the circuits in which the faults lined according {{to the value of}} the size spectrum.

50|$|The main coil is {{the outer}} part of the line trap which is made from {{stranded}} aluminum cable. The reactor coil, depending on the device, {{can be made up}} of several aluminum wires, allowing equal distribution amongst the parallel wires. The stranded aluminum coil is wound in one layer. However, when the application of more than one layer is necessary, separation between layers is required to provide a cooling duct between them to avoid overheating. The cooling duct is created with spacer bars made out of epoxy resin and fiberglass. The coil carries rated continuous power frequency currents, therefore this is the power inductor in this system. It provides a low <b>impedance</b> <b>path</b> for the electricity flow. Since the power flow is rather large at times, the coil used in a line trap must be large in terms of physical size. Hence, a line trap unit is inserted between the busbar and connection of coupling capacitor to the line. It is a parallel tuned circuit containing inductance and capacitance. It has low impedance for power frequency and <b>high</b> <b>impedance</b> to carrier frequency. This unit prevents the high frequency carrier signal from entering the neighboring line.|$|R
