5|$|Benchley {{was forced}} to take a {{publicity}} position with the Liberty Loan program, and he continued to freelance until Collier's contacted him with an associate editor position. Benchley took this offer to Vanity Fair to see <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> match it, as he felt Vanity Fair was the better magazine, and Vanity Fair offered him the position of managing editor. He accepted and began work there in 1919.|$|E
5|$|Hawke asked Sir Home Gordon, a cricket {{writer who}} had {{assisted}} Hawke with his autobiography, {{to sound out}} other counties to see <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> find Sutcliffe an acceptable captain if he played as an amateur—some players switched from amateur to professional, or vice versa, around this time.

5|$|An Indian {{resistance}} movement against U.S. expansion {{had been growing}} through {{the leadership of the}} Shawnee brothers, Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa (The Prophet). The conflict became known as Tecumseh's War. Tenskwatawa convinced the native tribes that they would be protected by the Great Spirit and no harm could befall them <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> rise up against the white settlers. He encouraged resistance by telling the tribes to pay white traders only half of what they owed and to give up all the white man's ways, including their clothing, muskets, and especially whiskey, which was becoming known as evil for American Indians.|$|E
5|$|At an {{editorial}} meeting of Jyllands-Posten ("The Jutland Post", Denmark's largest daily newspaper) on 19 September, reporter Stig Olesen mooted {{the idea of}} asking {{the members of the}} newspaper illustrators union <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> be willing to draw Muhammad. This would be an experiment to see the degree to which professional illustrators felt threatened. Flemming Rose, culture editor, was interested in the idea and wrote to the 42 members of the union asking them to draw their interpretations of Muhammad.|$|E
5|$|Between {{chapters}} in which Penelope is narrating, the twelve maids speak on topics from their point-of-view.

They blame Penelope and Eurycleia for allowing them to unjustly die. In Hades, they haunt both Penelope and Odysseus.|$|E

5|$|High Voltage Software {{spent over}} a year {{creating}} Lego Racers car building mechanics. The game's lead programmer, Dwight Luetscher, created a formula that {{was used by the}} game's artists to create individual Lego elements in the game. The pieces available to the player were selected from hundreds of Lego elements by the developers, chosen first by aesthetics, and then analysed to see <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> fit into Luetscher's formula. The developers chose to affect the attributes of the player's car, such as handling, acceleration and top speed, through how many bricks are placed on the chassis, as this is simpler to understand for the game's main age demographic.|$|E

Paulo does what Nikki tells him to because of his fear of losing her, which results in their deaths.|$|E

Before the crew disembarked, Matushenko ordered that the Potemkins Kingston valves be opened so Potemkin would sink to the bottom.|$|E
5|$|The {{army was}} not ready as of the summer of 1815, delaying the crossing. Given the harsh {{conditions}} on the mountains, the crossing could only {{be done in the}} summer season, when there is less snow. Buenos Aires did not send more provisions after the ousting of Alvear. San Martín proposed to resign and serve under Balcarce, <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> support the campaign. San Martín and Guido wrote a report in the autumn of 1816, detailing to the Supreme Director Antonio González de Balcarce the full military plan of operations.|$|E
5|$|According to the police, the {{passengers}} behaved very calmly, given the circumstances. Keč allowed several of {{the passengers}} to use their mobile telephones, allowing {{one of them to}} communicate with the police and keep Sheriff Jan Bergen updated on the situation. Anti-terror police had been called to the scene, and there were plans to storm the aircraft if the situation escalated. After the incident, the police refused to say <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> have stormed the aircraft if Keč followed through his threats to depart to another airport. During the last stages of the incident, another aircraft was parked beside the MD-82, which the police confirmed played a role {{towards the end of the}} hijacking. All communication towards the central government was made to the Norwegian Ministry of Justice, and neither the prime minister of the minister of foreign affairs was ever contacted. No weapons were found on either the aircraft nor on the hijacker.|$|E

She confesses to Christopher that she has been informing and that the FBI would give them new identities <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> testify. Christopher is grief-stricken and nearly kills her. He leaves the apartment, saying he needs time to think. Tony has Silvio pick up Adriana under the pretense of taking her to see Christopher, but instead drives her out to the woods and executes her. Adriana’s betrayal and subsequent execution is too much for Christopher to handle and he briefly returns to drug abuse to deal with the pain.|$|E
5|$|An Indian {{resistance}} movement against U.S. expansion {{had been growing}} around the Shawnee brothers Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa (The Prophet) that became known as Tecumseh's War. Tenskwatawa convinced the native tribes {{that they would be}} protected by the Great Spirit and no harm could befall them <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> rise up against the whites. He encouraged resistance by telling the tribes to only pay white traders half of what they owed, and to give up all the white man's ways, including their clothing, whiskey, and guns. In 1810, Tecumseh, with about 400 armed warriors, traveled to Vincennes where he confronted Harrison and demanded that the Treaty of Fort Wayne be rescinded. Although Harrison refused, the war party left peacefully, but Tecumseh was angry and threatened retaliation. After the meeting Tecumseh journeyed to meet with many of the tribes in the region, hoping to create a confederation with which to battle the Americans.|$|E
5|$|Berryman's Duntroon {{class had}} not yet {{completed}} its military training. Major General William Throsby Bridges decided that regimental duty would rectify that deficiency, so he assigned the Duntroon cadets as regimental officers of the First Australian Imperial Force (AIF), rather than as staff officers. Cadets were given the choice of service in the infantry or light horse. One cadet, Lawrence Wackett, protested that he wished {{to serve in the}} technical services. When asked <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> prefer the technical services, twelve cadets, including Berryman, Beavis, Clowes, Vasey, and Wackett stepped forward. Berryman was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Permanent Military Forces (PMF) on 29 June 1915 and again in the First AIF on 1 July 1915. He was posted to Lieutenant Colonel Harold Grimwade's 4th Field Artillery Brigade of the 2nd Division Artillery, along with Vasey and Milford. Berryman embarked for Egypt with the 4th Field Artillery Brigade on the transport Wiltshire on 17 November 1915. In Egypt, Berryman briefly commanded the 4th Brigade Ammunition Column before it was absorbed into the 2nd Division Ammunition Column.|$|E

5|$|During the evening, {{elements}} of Morgan's army had advanced to within five miles (8km) of Corydon. The four Legion {{companies that had}} attempted to prevent the crossing had been reinforced by four additional companies from Corydon, one from Elizabeth, and one from New Amsterdam, making the force about four-hundred strong. They lured a company of unsuspecting Confederates into an ambush where they were surrounded; sixteen were captured and taken to the Corydon jail. The invaders also successfully captured about thirty defenders in several skirmishes. They were rounded up and held in a school house near Laconia. After Morgan crossed the river he addressed the prisoners {{and told them that}} <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> promise to go home and not return to arms, he would allow them to leave and keep their guns.

5|$|Following the {{marriage}} in Germany on 29 May 1815, Queen Charlotte refused to receive her new daughter-in-law, nor would the Queen attend the resolemnisation of the Cumberlands' marriage at Kew, which Ernest's four older brothers attended. The Prince of Wales (now Prince Regent) found the Cumberlands' presence in Britain embarrassing, and offered him {{money and the}} Governorship of Hanover <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> leave for the Continent. Ernest refused, and the Cumberlands divided their time between Kew and St. James's Palace {{for the next three}} years. The Queen remained obstinate in her refusal to receive Frederica. Despite these family troubles, the Cumberlands had a happy marriage. The Government of Lord Liverpool asked Parliament to increase the Duke's allowance by £6,000 per year in 1815 (equal to about £ today), so he could meet increased expenses due to his marriage. The Duke's involvement in the Weymouth election became an issue, and the bill failed by one vote. Liverpool tried again in 1817; this time the bill failed by seven votes.|$|E

He was dropped from the team against Halifax Town in favour of loanee Leo Fortune-West, and even though manager Walker assured Brodie {{that he was in the}} club's long-term plans, Brodie reacted angrily to being substituted for Fortune-West at home to Ebbsfleet United on 29 March 2008. He finished his first full season at York with 14 goals in 48 appearances, as they finished 14th in the Conference Premier. In April 2008, the club took up its option of extending his contract until the end of 2008–09. Newly promoted Conference North club Gateshead made an inquiry for Brodie in June 2008, which was rejected by York.
