40|$|In recent decades, {{commercial}} aviation accidents have occurred due to human-machine interaction (HMI) problems known as “mode confusion. ” This is caused, in some cases, {{by a lack}} of understanding of onboard systems by pilots. Large amounts of Flight Operational Quality Assurance (FOQA) data are available, analysis of which could assist in identification of safety risks in daily operations. Through analysis of pilot reactions and recorded aircraft data, methods to detect mode confusion are developed to improve aviation safety. This study was conducted by inducing mode confusion into a flight simulation scenario and analyzing aircraft data to detect emerging patterns. Three distinct Instrument Landing System approaches were flown by participants unaware of experiment details. Differences between these approaches force the pilot to capture the glideslope from above using automation. The results indicate that pilots reacted to the mode confusion by providing control input which opposed the goal of the automation. This reaction was a response to the divergence between pilot intent and automation intent. Further experimentation is needed to determine a general, universally accepted <b>data</b> <b>marker</b> for the occurrence of mode confusion.

However, when breed-origin alleles were segregating in the grand parental breeds, the proportion of declared POD QTL decreased, which was more pronounced in a mating design with a small number of parents (F 0 and F 1). Non-POD QTL, i. e. with Mendelian or parent-of-origin expression (complete imprinting) inheritance, were well classified (> 90 %) as non-POD QTL, except for QTL with small effects and paternal or maternal expression in the design with a small number of parents, for which spurious POD QTL were declared...|$|E
40|$|Artificial {{tetraploid}} somatic hybrids {{have been}} developed for sterile triploid citrus breeding by sexual hybridization between diploid and tetraploid somatic hybrids. The genetic structure of diploid gametes produced by tetraploid genotypes depends on the mode of chromosome association at meiosis. In order to evaluate tetraploid inheritance in a tetraploid interspecific somatic hybrid between mandarin and lemon, we performed segregation studies using cytogenetic and single sequence repeat molecular markers. Cytogenetic analysis of meiosis in the somatic hybrid revealed 11 % tetravalents and 76 % bivalents. Inheritance of the tetraploid hybrid was analyzed by genotyping the triploid progeny derived from a cross between a diploid pummelo and the tetraploid somatic hybrid, in order to derive genotypes of the meiospores produced by the tetraploid. A likelihood-based approach was used to distinguish between disomic, tetrasomic, and intermediate inheritance models and to estimate the double reduction rate. In agreement with expectations based the cytogenetic <b>data,</b> <b>marker</b> segregation was largely compatible with tetrasomic and inheritance intermediate between disomic and tetrasomic, with some evidence for preferential pairing of homoeologous chromosomes. This has important implications for the design of breeding programs that involve tetraploid hybrids, and underscores the need to consider inheritance models that are intermediate between disomic and tetrasomic.

40|$|Linkage {{analysis}} with genetic markers {{has been successful}} in the localization of genes for many monogenic human diseases. In studies of complex diseases, however, tests that rely on linkage disequilibrium (the simultaneous presence of linkage and association) are often more powerful than those that rely on linkage alone. This advantage is illustrated by the transmission/disequilibrium test (TDT). The TDT requires <b>data</b> (<b>marker</b> genotypes) for affected individuals and their parents; for some diseases, however, data from parents may be difficult or impossible to obtain. In this article, we describe a method, called the "sib TDT" (or "S-TDT"), that overcomes this problem by use of marker data from unaffected sibs instead of from parents, thus allowing application of the principle of the TDT to sibships without parental data. In a single collection of families, there might be some that can be analyzed only by the TDT and others that are suitable for analysis by the S-TDT. We show how all the data may be used jointly in one overall TDT-type procedure that tests for linkage in the presence of association. These extensions of the TDT will be valuable for the study of diseases of late onset, such as non-insulin-dependent diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and other diseases associated with aging...|$|E

40|$|Background: Schizophrenia is a {{disorder}} that {{is characterized by}} disordered thinking, memory, and perception in its patients. Schizoaffective disorder is a separate disorder that features symptoms of schizophrenia and mood disorders. Because of the overlap in symptoms, it {{is relatively easy to}} confuse schizoaffective disorder and schizophrenia. Based on DSM- 5 criteria, patients with schizophrenia must have {{at least two of the}} characteristic symptoms (delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior, and negative symptoms) for a significant portion of time during a 1 -month period and experience significant disturbance in functioning. A diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder can be made if that patient exhibits the symptoms required for schizophrenia in addition to presenting with a major mood episode. This major mood episode can include elevated and depressed moods similar to bipolar disorder, and their associated symptoms. Schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorders are not preventable or curable disorders, but various treatments are available for symptomatic suppression. However, there are differences in how the two disorders are treated. Therefore, accurately diagnosing these two conditions is imperative to ensure patients receive the appropriate evidence-based treatment. Objectives: To understand how diagnostic criteria on paper translates into real clinical practice and to develop interventions to improve the care of patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. Methods: We conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews with consenting psychiatrists at Cambridge Health Alliance sites to understand how they diagnosed and treated patients with either schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorders. We extracted data from the transcribed interviews and created frameworks of how each psychiatrist conceptualizes the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders. We then completed chart reviews for five of each psychiatrist’s patients who were diagnosed with either schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Data from the chart reviews represented the real-world diagnosis and treatment of patients, which was then compared with the psychiatrists’ conceptualization of these disorders and their treatment. Results: The results of this study have not been fully realized yet. The consenting psychiatrists have been interviewed and data has been collected from five of their schizophrenia and/or schizoaffective disorder patients. Analysis of the patients’ baseline characteristics has been completed, and we have determined which <b>data</b> <b>markers</b> would best illustrate differences in how both schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder patients are diagnosed, treated, and prepared for functioning well in society after being discharged. We have also determined which <b>data</b> <b>markers</b> will be extrapolated from the psychiatrists’ interview responses in order to understand their beliefs regarding differences between the diagnosis, treatment and therapy adherence of these two conditions. We are in the final process of comparing corresponding <b>data</b> <b>markers</b> from both sources (psychiatrist interview and patient charts), which will allow us to determine how well psychiatrists translate their conceptualizations into real-world clinical practice. Conclusion: As we have progressed through our data analysis, preliminary trends have become evident. The majority of psychiatrists did acknowledge a difference between the two conditions and this seems to be supported by their diagnosing and treatment habits. However, psychiatrists at this site did not draw distinctions when discussing the issue of patient adherence to their respective therapies...|$|R

The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the consequences of using approximate gametic variance covariance matrices on response to selection by MABLUP.
