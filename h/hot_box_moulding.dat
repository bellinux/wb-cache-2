40|$|In this dissertation, Calibrated <b>Hot</b> <b>Box</b> {{measurements}} {{on two different}} types of fenestration systems (one window and one glazing unit) are presented. The research program included: renovation of the University of Massachusetts <b>Hot</b> <b>Box</b> test facility, an analysis of measurement uncertainty, experimental refinements to the test method ruggedness 2 ̆ 7, calibration of the extraneous heat transfer of the <b>Hot</b> <b>Box,</b> and a numerical analysis of the two-dimensional heat transfer in the <b>Hot</b> <b>Box.</b> The finite element method was also used to analyze the heat transfer (thermal transmittance) for each of the fenestration systems tested. These analytical results are then compared with experimental results obtained from <b>Hot</b> <b>Box</b> measurements. ^ Renovation consistent with existing ASTM standards aimed at improving the precision of test method with the University of Massachusetts Calibrated <b>Hot</b> <b>Box</b> test facility were conducted and documented. The uncertainty of the <b>Hot</b> <b>Box</b> measurement results was estimated from an uncertainty analysis of the thermal transmittance. Ruggedness experiments consistent with ASTM test method E 1169 – 89 (1999) were performed, and results enabled the researcher to refine the <b>hot</b> <b>box</b> measurement methodology and reduce the variability of the measurements. Finally, <b>hot</b> <b>box</b> calibration experiments were designed and performed in order to account for the various heat transfer losses in the <b>hot</b> <b>box</b> so that the more accurate measurements of the net heat transfer through a fenestration system may be produced. ^ Using a finite element method, two-dimensional and three-dimensional numerical heat transfer analyses of the calibrated <b>hot</b> <b>box</b> and fenestration systems were conducted. These analyses were compared with the experimental calibration results. These included two- and three-dimensional numerical heat transfer analyses of the metering chamber extraneous heat transfer, and the specimen flanking heat transfer. Analytical heat transfer results with combined conduction, convection and radiation effects were compared with experimental results. The heat transfer through two different fenestration products (a glazing unit and a PVC framed window with three glazing units) was investigated. The results are compared with the experimental results on these products using the ASTM C 1199 - 97 (2000) standard test method for determining the thermal transmittance (U-factor) and the ISO/DIS 12567 (1999) window thermal testing standard. ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Hot</b> <b>box</b> (or simply box) is a {{non-contact}} {{team sport}} {{which is similar}} to ultimate, but played on a smaller field and with fewer players. Like ultimate, the object of the game is to score points by passing the disc into the end zone; however, in <b>Hot</b> <b>Box</b> there is generally only one end zone and it is of much smaller size than an Ultimate end zone. In this way, <b>hot</b> <b>box</b> is a [...] "half-court" [...] (see basketball) variant of ultimate.

40|$|Thermal {{conductivity}} {{of materials}} for structural elements and thermal insulation represents a fundamental parameter {{in the assessment}} of the energy need of buildings. In this paper, two different systems for thermal conductivity measurement are compared, based respectively on the calibrated <b>hot</b> <b>box</b> and on the guarded hot plate methods. The study is specifically aimed at assessing the range of thermal transmittance where the <b>hot</b> <b>box</b> system is suitable and verifying the strengths and the weaknesses of the system. The comparison between measurements on specimens with different thermal conductivity and thickness showed that the two methods are substantially equivalent in the considered range of thermal conductivity, but are not completely interchangeable. In particular, the measurement campaign confirmed the expectation that the <b>hot</b> <b>box</b> system gives more accurate results with low thermal resistance samples...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTwo {{standard}} test methods exist to experimentally determine the effective thermal resistance of a wall: in-situ testing to calibrate a computer simulation and steady-state testing in a guarded <b>hot</b> <b>box.</b> This paper compares results obtained using both methods {{on a wall}} assembly incorporating vacuum insulation panels (VIPs) with an experimentally determined effective R-Value of 8. 21 m 2 K/W using a guarded <b>hot</b> <b>box.</b> The result using a guarded <b>hot</b> <b>box</b> was lower than that using in-situ measurements paired with computer simulation {{as a result of}} the more accurate representation of thermal bridging between VIP panels using this test method. When testing in a guarded <b>hot</b> <b>box,</b> all thermal bridges, including between panels is accounted for. By comparison, an experimentally obtained thermal resistance measured at the center of a VIP panel and assumed as a constant thermal resistance across the complete VIP layer in the computer model does not account for the non-homogenous nature of a VIP layer. As a result, it was concluded that wall assemblies that contain numerous small thermal bridges like those incorporating VIP panels should be experimentally evaluated using a guarded box...|$|R

40|$|Solar-control {{films are}} {{increasingly}} being retrofitted to the windows of buildings {{as a means of}} reducing solar gain. At present, there is a dearth of information concerning how these films effect the thermal comfort of occupants within buildings where these films have been applied. An illuminated <b>hot</b> <b>box,</b> utilising a xenon lamp to simulate sunlight, has been designed as a testing facility. The illuminated <b>hot</b> <b>box</b> has been used to obtain information on how much thermal radiation enters the internal space from a window fitted with a solar-control film. The data from the experimental apparatus was verified using a finite-difference model written on a personal computer, with the aim of the computer program being used to compare different films, and thereby avoiding expensive experiments. The experimental rig produced usable data for the tested films only when the lamp was orthogonal to the plane of the glass, with errors occurring, and increasing, as the angle of incidence between the lamp and the glass increased. This conclusion was verified by the computer based model. It was seen that the illuminated <b>hot</b> <b>box</b> was too small to give accurate measurements for angles of incidence other than 0 °. It is suggested that a larger illuminated <b>hot</b> <b>box</b> which is able to eliminate the problems encountered when measuring for angles of incidence above 10 ° would be desirable. Furthermore, a more complex transient finite-difference computer based simulation model is needed, taking into account the conclusions that were made during this study...|$|R
40|$|Starting {{from the}} {{measurement}} principle for {{the determination of}} thermal resistance of a building element in the laboratory (guarded <b>hot</b> <b>box</b> method) and in-situ, possible testing errors are considered, in particular those due to temperature nonuniformity and imbalance between the metering and guard section. Almost all in-situ measurements are carried out in non-steady-state conditions, nevertheless imbalance problems {{are similar to those}} of such steady-state test methods as the guarded <b>hot</b> <b>box.</b> Temperature non-uniformity on the surfaces of the specimen generates an uncertainty in the definition of the surface temperature itself, but, as a consequence, there is an associated potential temperature imbalance. The scope of this work is to verify the semi-empirical expressions introduced in two documents of the European Committee for Standardization (CEN, Comité Européen de Normalisation) with those for guarded hot plate apparatus, analytically obtained and experimentally verified by Woodside and those analytically obtained for guarded <b>hot</b> <b>box</b> apparatus. Next, the application of the CEN expression to assess the effect of temperature non-uniformities was checked: for this purpose some homogeneous and layered structures have been analysed by the finite difference method...|$|R

50|$|<b>Hot</b> <b>box</b> is {{an energy}} {{efficient}} therrmocol box which keeps the temperature constant for hours, saving energy and fuel. It {{is ideal for}} rice cooking and for keeping normal food items hot. Rice is cooked in boiled water. The boiling point of water is 100 C and will not increase with further heating. When rice is cooked normally, the fire is maintained until it is cooked. If the water temperature can be maintained at 100 C without further heating, fuel is saved. This is what the <b>Hot</b> <b>Box</b> is designed to do. Rice is cooked in water until it has boild and the bowl is put in the Hotbox until it is fully cooked.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the possibilities of}} a more efficient condition-based maintenance in the railway sector by using trend analysis with temperature data from <b>hot</b> <b>box</b> detectors. The study shows {{that the use of}} trend analysis directly on <b>hot</b> <b>box</b> measurements could induce misleading predictions due to certain detector characteristics. Because of this, multiple linear regression models were used to estimate the temperature of bearings based on several known parameters for each detector. A second type of linear model was then used to predict future values of the difference between the estimated temperature and the measured temperature. Results from this study show a large variation in the predicted values. The variations of the predictions depend on the amount of measurements included in the model, the time difference between the measurements, the uncertainty of each measurement, the mean value of the measurements included, and the weight function of the model. Large prediction variations resulted in predicted values where it was difficult to separate scenarios that could be considered "normal" from scenarios where a <b>hot</b> <b>box</b> warning would be desirable. For the prediction model to be able to reduce the risk for false alarms without increasing the risk of overlooking actual faults the model needs to be improved or combined with other models...|$|R
