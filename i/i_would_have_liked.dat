500|$|The {{victory was}} Cambridge's 61st in the contest, taking the overall score to 6148. [...] The Cambridge boat club {{president}} and stroke Christopher Davey said: [...] "Everything went as planned, but Oxford hung {{on more than}} <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>liked</b> at the end. [...] <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>liked</b> to have taken it to 10 lengths if possible but Oxford kept going splendidly at the end." ...|$|E
500|$|... "It didn't {{really work}} out for Josh {{as he would have}} liked, as <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>liked,</b> He has got a lot of talent as a footballer. He came in and I knew he wasn't going to walk {{straight}} into the side but I was hoping he was going to develop and evolve and give us another option down the right-hand side.However, it hasn't quite worked out and he has gone back to his parent club which is the best thing for everybody." ...|$|E
500|$|The two {{boats in}} the Cambridge University Women's Boat Club (CUWBC) trials were denoted as Rise and Grind, with the race commencing at 2:30p.m. [...] Starting from the Surrey station, Rise, despite the lower stroke rate, were half a length ahead within the first 20 strokes, and held a length's lead by Craven Cottage. [...] They {{gradually}} extended their lead to two lengths by Hammersmith Bridge, three by Chiswick Steps and finished five lengths ahead of Grind. [...] Cambridge's coach Rob Baker was mildly disappointed but remained upbeat, suggesting [...] "Though <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>liked</b> a closer race, I saw some excellent performances".|$|E

[...] "When I was younger, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> garbage cans set up {{all around the}} yard," [...] Orlovsky recalled. [...] "And <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>like</b> 20 balls and just fire them into the cans. I really had {{nothing else to do}} back then." ...|$|R

5000|$|Coelen {{swore that}} she would never go through the terror of {{competing}} again, noting that it was [...] "too nerve-wracking," [...] yet that being a Miss World contestant and titleholder was [...] "something <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> <b>liked</b> to miss." ...|$|R
500|$|In the 2000s, Blancornelas {{wanted to}} remove bylines from Zetas most {{dangerous}} stories, but was persuaded not to by reporter Francisco Ortiz, who wished his {{to continue to}} run atop his stories on organized crime. In 2005, Ortiz {{was shot to death}} in front of his children, and Blancornelas began his no-byline policy. In the days after Ortiz's death, he stated, [...] "I feel remorse for having created Zeta. After losing three colleagues, I believe the price has been too high. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>liked</b> to retire a long time ago ... I cannot allow drug traffickers to think {{that they were able to}} crush Zeta's spirit, and our readers to believe that we are afraid." ...|$|E
500|$|Joyce, a 22-year veteran, tearfully {{admitted}} {{after reviewing}} {{video of the}} play after the game that [...] "I {{did not get the}} call correct", insisting that he [...] "took a perfect game away from that kid over there that worked his ass off all night". Joyce called the Donald ruling [...] "the biggest call of my career", claiming that [...] "I thought [...] beat the throw. I was convinced he beat the throw, until I saw the replay". The umpire later said, [...] "I didn't want this to be my 15 minutes of fame. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>liked</b> my 15 minutes to be a great call in the World Series. Hopefully, my 15 minutes are over now".|$|E
500|$|The {{final scene}} wherein Doggett and his ex-wife scatter Luke's remains was called [...] "difficult" [...] by Robert Patrick. He later noted that Manners [...] "was there {{to guide us}} along; I {{can think of no}} worst [...] {{nightmare}} for a parent than to lose their child." [...] The episode was written to create closure to Doggett's story. Patrick later said that, if the series had continued for a tenth season, {{he would have liked to}} see his character develop a relationship with Reyes, because [...] "I think Doggett was very attracted to Reyes [...] <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>liked</b> to see the relationship with Reyes explored more." [...] Gish agreed, noting that the show's ending never allowed the idea to be fleshed out, but that Reyes [...] "would have definitely gone further with their relationship." ...|$|E

500|$|He {{eventually}} {{turned down}} talks with York {{and agreed to}} sign a one-year contract with fellow Conference team Mansfield Town on 19 May. On signing, Smith said [...] "It {{was time for a}} change after not getting as much football as <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>liked.</b> I'm still young, Mansfield are {{going in the right direction}} and I'm excited about the new season". He made his debut in the opening match of 2010–11, a 3–1 victory over Forest Green, and was substituted in the 80th minute. Smith scored his first goal for Mansfield in a 4–0 victory over Altrincham on 30 August. A red card in the 61st minute of a 1–0 defeat at Gateshead on 2 October for a high challenge resulted in a three match suspension. He finished the season with 38 appearances and six goals.|$|E
500|$|The war had a {{significant}} influence on Moore's life - he said his only romance ended when his fiancée Lorna, a nurse, was killed in London in 1943 by a bomb which struck her ambulance. Moore subsequently remarked that he never married because [...] "there {{was no one else}} for me... second best is no good for me... <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>liked</b> a wife and family, but it was not to be." [...] In his autobiography he said that after sixty years he still thought about her, and because of her death [...] "if I saw the entire German nation sinking into the sea, I could be relied upon to help push it down." [...] In May 2012 he said to the Radio Times magazine, [...] "We must take care. There may be another war. The Germans will try again, given another chance". He also said, in the same interview, that [...] "The only good Kraut is a dead Kraut." [...] However, some doubt has arisen over Moore's account, as researchers have been unable to identify Lorna, despite the meticulous records kept of wartime civilian casualties.|$|E
500|$|It's {{something}} that's {{very difficult}} for me. Because it is lines on paper when I {{do it in the}} comic book series. It's like, 'Oh, okay, Charlie Adlard [...] doesn’t have to draw that arrangement of lines anymore, that person is dead.' But it's very uncomfortable for me to be on set, because I see these actors that are there and, in the source material, I have killed all but two of them. I walk through the set and I'm like, 'Yep, killed that one, killed that one, killed that one.' And it is firing those people. I feel really bad for Emma Bell, just because she was great and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>liked</b> to have had her in the show. But, you know, this is The Walking Dead, characters have got to die. Thankfully, Emma was brought onto the show with the understanding that she was only {{going to be in a}} certain number of episodes and she knew that she was going to die from the very beginning. But it doesn’t really make it any easier. When they were shooting those scenes, I had to fly to Comic-Con and so I wasn’t actually there for when she died. But it was very emotional on set and I know that she was very upset about having to leave the crew and the actors. You kind of become a family when you're doing a TV show and it’s a little upsetting to have to get rid of somebody.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am sorry. <b>I</b> {{thought you}} <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>liked</b> his coming,' said poor Mr. Edmonstone, only half {{conscious}} of his offence; 'but I see {{you are not}} well this evening.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah, that's a pity; I {{was sorry}} {{not to find}} you in the drawing-room, but <b>I</b> thought you <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>liked</b> just to see him,' said Mr. Edmonstone, disappointed, and apologizing.|$|R

"I did at Queenstown, but at Boston I had not {{the courage}} to test the fact. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> <b>liked</b> to try a joke {{with one of them}} as <b>I</b> <b>would</b> at Queenstown, or as <b>I</b> <b>would</b> at Boston with an American. Their faces did not arraign me, but they forbade me. It was very curious, and I may have misread them." ...|$|R
500|$|Emma's {{relationship}} with glee club coach Will Schuester {{is an integral}} part of her character. They have had an on and off relationship since the show's first season. Television critics have responded extremely well to the pairing between the two. Mandi Bierly for Entertainment Weekly said of the episode [...] "Vitamin D": [...] "Matthew Morrison communicates so much with his eyes. There’s a softness and a longing in them that I’m always surprised Emma (Jayma Mays) matches." [...] Critics also commented positively on the development of Will and Emma's relationship in the episode Sectionals. Natalie Abrams of TV Guide noted that she had been waiting for them to kiss since the pilot episode, and Eric Goldman of IGN has deemed their coming together [...] "very hard to not feel good about". Dan Snierson, however, wrote that although there was satisfaction in the episode ending on the kiss, it may have been [...] "more intriguing" [...] to conclude when Will finds Emma's empty office, and having him then question whether it was too soon for the two of them to begin a relationship. Eric Goldman of IGN commented of the following episode: [...] " [...] <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>liked</b> to at least see Shue and Emma as a couple for a few episodes, rather than such a quick split. It felt rushed." [...] Todd VanDerWerff added: [...] "I loved Emma's eruption to Will about how Sue Sylvester must have cheated and the kids deserved to win." [...] Robert Canning said of the Britney Spears oriented episode: [...] "The true focus of the episode was Will dealing with his lack of spontaneity. This stood as a contrast to the impulsiveness of Emma's new boyfriend, sexy dentist Carl played by the somehow always charming John Stamos. There's a fun love triangle building here which should only get better as Will becomes less of an insecure whiner." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wilder was {{not only}} proud of his film, he was plainly fond of it as well: [...] "I never heard that expression, film noir, when I made Double Indemnity... I just made {{pictures}} <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>liked</b> to see. When I was lucky, it coincided with {{the taste of the}} audience. With Double Indemnity, I was lucky." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the {{withdrawal}} of Tom Daschle's nomination for the position, Dean had been touted by many for the post of Secretary of Health and Human Services. After being passed over for the post once again, Dean commented: [...] "I was pretty clear that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>liked</b> to have been Secretary of HHS {{but it is the}} president's choice and he decided to go in a different direction." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{were trying}} which could {{keep up the}} longest," [...] Marion said; [...] "Wilfrid and I against the other two. You were looking on, and <b>I</b> believe you <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>liked</b> to <b>have</b> skipped too." ...|$|R
5000|$|Since we {{were only}} about 300 miles from the Japanese coast {{we had no idea}} why it was taking so long. Of course when we started {{dropping}} the big bombs we understood. <b>I</b> still <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>liked</b> for the big boys who were sunk at Pearl to {{have had a chance to}} lob those 16 inchers ashore and say [...] "hey, Japs, look who's here."

2500|$|Tatangelo {{had three}} children, the late Aldo, Jr., of Laredo, Linda T. (husband Jerry) McKinney of Fort Worth, and Robert (wife Elva) Tatangelo of Grapevine, Texas, and five grandchildren. He had two {{brothers}} and a sister who predeceased him, Guido and Leo Tatangelo and Eva T. Grenieri. He {{said that he has}} been pleased with his long life [...] "as a whole. ... There were more things that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>liked</b> to do, but, hey, you can't get everything you want, right?" [...] He was Roman Catholic.|$|E
2500|$|Four years later, when part of Crowe's {{appearance}} at the 2002 BAFTA awards was cut out {{to fit into the}} BBC's tape-delayed broadcast, Crowe used strong language during an argument with producer Malcolm Gerrie. The part cut was a poem in tribute to actor Richard Harris, and it was cut for copyright reasons. Crowe later apologised, saying [...] "What I said to him may have been a little bit more passionate than now, in the cold light of day, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>liked</b> it to have been." ...|$|E
2500|$|In February, Dibaba {{hoped to}} break the indoor 2 mile world record at the New Balance Indoor Grand Prix in Boston. Her pacer, however, quit at the 1 {{kilometre}} mark, and she finished in 9:13.17, seven seconds off the record. Dibaba said after the race, [...] "With this first race , I am happy. But I could have run faster with better pacing--9:03 or 9:04. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>liked</b> to have broken the meet record.... Running alone is a bit tough. When I broke the world record at 5000 meters, I had good pacemakers." ...|$|E
60|$|That {{dinner was}} the most {{soothing}} meal of which I had ever partaken. I did the carving, my companions did the questioning, and nearly all the conversation was about myself. Ordinarily <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> <b>liked</b> this, but every word which was said by these two fair ladies--for {{the sweetness of the}} mother was merely more seasoned than that of the daughter--was so filled with friendly interest that it gratified me to make my answers.|$|R
60|$|September 4th.--I made {{a voyage}} in the Pond-Lily {{all by myself}} {{yesterday}} morning, and was much encouraged by my success in causing the boat to go whither <b>I</b> <b>would.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> always <b>liked</b> to be afloat, but I think I have never adequately conceived of the enjoyment till now, when I begin to feel a power over that which supports me. I suppose I must <b>have</b> felt something <b>like</b> this sense of triumph when I first learned to swim; but I have forgotten it. O that I could run wild!--that is, that I could put myself into a true relation with Nature, and be on friendly terms with all congenial elements.|$|R
60|$|But {{we liked}} Miss Ponsonby and we pitied her. She confided {{to us that}} she was very lonely and that she wrote poetry. We never asked to see the poetry, {{although}} <b>I</b> think she <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>liked</b> to show it. But, as Jerry says, there are limits.|$|R
2500|$|George Orwell {{fought in}} the Spanish Civil War in the militia of Workers' Party of Marxist Unification (POUM), a revolutionary Trotskyst party (and {{therefore}} opposed to the Soviet Union line) whose militants were allied with the CNT during the revolution and to which Andrés Nin belonged. Orwell described in his book Homage to Catalonia the time during which Barcelona rose up with the CNT and anarchism. In the ninth chapter of his book, Orwell commented that [...] "As far as my purely personal preferences went <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>liked</b> to join the Anarchists." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ricky Ponting {{found himself}} criticised by journalists on his {{captaincy}} and {{performances in the}} 2005 series during {{the run-up to the}} first Test. When questioned in a press conference on this subject, he said [...] "We didn't perform the way we would have liked and probably I didn't score the runs <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>liked</b> to during the Ashes... It's important for us to move on, to move forward from that; that is me as a player, me as a captain {{and the rest of the}} team as well... We have managed to do that very well, we've actually played better cricket as a result of that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Singh has an {{interest}} in Greek poetry. He was asked in an interview, [...] "If you were to choose a profession other than law, what would it be and why?". He responded [...] "One thing <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>liked</b> to be is an academic specialising in Greek poetry. I love Greek poetry. I can read Ancient Greek but never had the chance to develop my interest." [...] Singh is also a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts. Singh has also expressed his views writing in The Guardian on how 'Asians should not be prejudged because of the way we look' following a personal experience on the London Underground following the 7 July 2005 London bombings.|$|E

60|$|Some {{little while}} I raged about the streets, and told myself I was the worst-used lad in Christendom. Anger choked me; {{it was all}} very well for me to breathe deep; it seemed there was not air enough about Leyden to supply me, and <b>I</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> burst <b>like</b> a man {{at the bottom of the}} sea. I stopped and laughed at myself at a street-corner a minute together, {{laughing}} out loud, so that a passenger looked at me, which brought me to myself.|$|R

[...] Wonderbra denied asking her to lose weight, saying [...] "...we chose her because of her fabulous curves. Since discovering Katie, we have been delighted with how she looked in our new D-G range." [...] It said the agency had advised her to lose weight, which they did not agree with.|$|R
