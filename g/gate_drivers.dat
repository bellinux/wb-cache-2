50|$|The most {{efficient}} MOSFET designs use N-channel MOSFETs {{on both the}} high side and low side because they typically have {{a third of the}} ON resistance of P-channel MOSFETs.

5000|$|It is {{essential}} to remember that, for N-MOSFETs, the high-side switch must be driven to a higher voltage than Vi. To achieve this, MOSFET <b>gate</b> <b>drivers</b> typically feed the MOSFET output voltage back into the gate driver. The gate driver then adds its own supply voltage to the MOSFET output voltage when driving the high-side MOSFETs to achieve a Vgs equal to the gate driver supply voltage.

40|$|The {{potential}} of silicon carbide (SiC) for modern power electronics applications is revolutionary {{because of its}} superior material properties including substantially better breakdown voltage, power density, device leakage, thermal conductivity, and switching speed. Integration of <b>gate</b> <b>driver</b> circuitry on the same chip, or in the same package, as the power device would significantly reduce the parasitic inductance, require far less thermal management paraphernalia, reduce cost {{and size of the}} system, and result in more efficient and reliable electrical and thermal performance of the system. The design of a <b>gate</b> <b>driver</b> circuit with good performance parameters in this completely new under-development SiC process is the key to realization of this ultimate goal of integrating a SiC <b>gate</b> <b>driver</b> with a SiC power MOSFET. The objective of this joint undertaking is integration of the designed <b>gate</b> <b>driver</b> into the electronic battery charger onboard the new plug-in hybrid Toyota Prius.

40|$|Silicon Carbide (SiC) power {{semiconductors}} {{have shown}} the capability of greatly outperforming Si-based power devices. Faster switching and smaller on-state losses coupled with higher voltage blocking and temperature capabilities make SiC an attractive semiconductor for high-performance, high-power-density power modules. However, the temperature capabilities and increased power density are fully realized only when the <b>gate</b> <b>driver</b> needed to control the SiC devices is placed next to them. This requires the <b>gate</b> <b>driver</b> to successfully operate under extreme conditions with reduced or no heat sinking requirements.

40|$|Silicon carbide-based power devices play an {{increasingly}} important role in modern power conversion systems. Finding a means {{to reduce the size}} and complexity of these systems by even incremental amounts can {{have a significant impact on}} cost and reliability.

Aside from cost reductions, there are significant advantages to the integration of the <b>gate</b> <b>driver</b> circuits with the power devices. By integrating the <b>gate</b> <b>driver</b> circuitry with the power devices, the parasitic inductances traditionally seen between the <b>gate</b> <b>driver</b> and the switching devices can be significantly reduced, allowing faster switching speeds, which in turn leads to higher efficiencies, less aggressive thermal management requirements, and physically smaller passives.
