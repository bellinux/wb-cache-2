25|$|Many housing {{initiatives}} involve {{homeless people}} {{in the process of}} building and maintaining affordable shared housing. This process works as a double impact by not only providing housing but also giving homeless people <b>employment</b> <b>income</b> and work experience. One example of this type of initiative is the nonprofit organization Living Solutions, which is located in downtown San Diego, CA. This community initiative provides the homeless population with a source of housing as well as giving them jobs building affordable homes. The initiative also builds community empowerment by asking formerly homeless residents to help to maintain and repair these homes. Residents are responsible for all household duties, including menu planning, budgeting, shopping, cooking, cleaning, yard work, and home maintenance. The environment of responsibility over a living space fosters a sense of ownership as well as involvement {{in all parts of the}} decision-making process.|$|E

500|$|The Conflict of the Orders {{was finally}} {{coming to an}} end, since the Plebeians had {{achieved}} political equality with the Patricians. A small number of Plebeian families had achieved the same standing that the old aristocratic Patrician families had always had, but these new Plebeian aristocrats were as uninterested in {{the plight of the}} average Plebeian as the old Patrician aristocrats had always been. During this time period, the Plebeian plight had been mitigated due to the constant state of war that Rome was in. These wars provided <b>employment,</b> <b>income,</b> and glory for the average Plebeian, and the sense of patriotism that resulted from these wars also eliminated any real threat of Plebeian unrest. The lex Publilia, which had required the election of at least one Plebeian Censor every five years, contained another provision. Before this time, any bill passed by an assembly (either by the Plebeian Council, the Tribal Assembly, or the Centuriate Assembly) could only become a law after the Patrician senators gave their approval. This approval {{came in the form of}} an auctoritas patrum ("authority of the fathers" [...] or [...] "authority of the Patrician senators"). The lex Publilia modified this process, requiring the auctoritas patrum to be passed before a law could be voted on by one of the assemblies, rather than after the law had already been voted on. It is not known why, but this modification seems to have made the auctoritas patrum irrelevant.|$|E

40|$|Ill-health can be {{expected}} to reduce <b>employment</b> and <b>income.</b> But are the effects sustained over time? Do they differ across the income distribution? And are there spillover effects on the <b>employment</b> and <b>income</b> of the spouse? We use matching combined with difference-in-differences to identify the causal effects of sudden illness, represented by acute hospitalisations, on <b>employment</b> and <b>income</b> up to six years after the health shock using linked Dutch hospital and tax register data. On average, an acute hospital admission lowers the employment probability by seven percentage points and results in a 5 % loss of personal income (30 % for those entering disability insurance) two years after the shock. There is no subsequent recovery in either <b>employment</b> or <b>income.</b> The distribution of ill-health contributes to income inequality: a health shock is both more likely to occur and to have a larger relative impact on <b>employment</b> and <b>income</b> {{at the bottom of the}} income distr ibution. There are large spillover effects: household income falls by 50 % more than the income of the disabled person, and the employment probability of the spouse is reduced by 1. 5 percentage points.

For the Continental European welfare states the results are more mixed. <b>Employment</b> and <b>income</b> are still important factors, but the effects are less clear and there are significant variations.
