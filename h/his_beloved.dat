5|$|In the sonnet, {{the speaker}} asks {{whether or not}} he should compare <b>his</b> <b>beloved</b> to the summer season, and argues that he should not because the {{comparison}} does not properly express the depths of his emotion. He also states that <b>his</b> <b>beloved</b> will live on forever through the words of the poem. Scholars have found parallels within the poem to Ovid's Tristia and Amores, both of which have love themes. Sonnet 18 is written in the typical Shakespearean sonnet form, having 14 lines of iambic pentameter ending in a rhymed couplet. Detailed exegeses have revealed several double meanings within the poem, giving it a greater depth of interpretation.|$|E

This was on a huge scale, 28ft (8.5m) in total width and 9ft 9in (3m) high; the three pictures from left to right depicted Joan devoting herself to the service of God and her country, Joan scattering the enemies of France, and Joan dying a martyr.|$|E

Marko broke his sword and spear, throwing his mace far out to sea before lying down to die. His body was found seven days later by Abbot Vaso and his deacon, Isaija.
