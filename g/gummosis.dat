50|$|The fungal {{pathogen}} Wilsonomyces carpophilus affects {{members of}} the Prunus genera. Almond, apricot, nectarine, peach, prune and cherry trees can be affected. Both edible and ornamental varieties are vulnerable to infection. Shot hole disease produces small (1/10-1/4”) reddish or purplish-brown spots. There may be a light green or yellow ring around these spots. Damaged areas become slightly larger and then dry up and fall away, leaving BB-sized holes in leaves. As the fungus spreads, more leaf tissue is damaged until the leaf falls. Significant infections can {{reduce the amount of}} photosynthesis that can occur, weakening the plant, and decreasing fruit production. The fungi can also affect fruit, beginning as small purple spots that develop into gray to white lesions. <b>Gummosis</b> may occur. These lesions leave toughened spots on the skin, and in some cases the fruit may be lost. Infected buds may appear darker than normal. Branches may develop concentric lesions when infected. These lesions may girdle a twig and kill it.|$|E
50|$|Webber's {{tenure as}} {{director}} of the CES lasted, with a few interruptions, from 1913 until his retirement in 1929. A few important achievements of the CES during his directorship were: Walter P. Kelly's development of drainage techniques for reclaiming thousands of acres of California land made unproductive by salt accumulation; the development of chemical fertilizers; the discovery of boron poisoning, methods for its control, and an understanding of the necessity of minute amounts of boron in citrus growth. Howard B. Frost's pioneering genetic research lead to the first accurate reports of the normal number of chromosomes for some citrus, the first discovery of polyploidy in citrus, and the first descriptions of citrus tetraploids. Frost also developed tools for guiding artificial hybridization for production of new citrus cultivars, which resulted in widespread propagation of nuclear lines and contributed to the improvement of citrus plantings throughout the world. By working out the etiology of various types of diseases, particularly <b>gummosis,</b> Howard S. Faucet contributed significantly to improved methods for disease control and made possible the discovery of the viral nature of some diseases which were responsible for causing quick decline among 3 million orange trees over a 25-year period. H.J. Quale's entomological research on citrus insects, mites, and walnut insects led to the first recognition of the problem of insect resistance to fumigation, and of means of overcoming it. Harry H. Smith and Harold Compere's discovery of natural parasites of the citrophilus mealybug in Australia effected almost complete control of this parasite in California, which saved growers in Orange County almost $1 million in crop losses annually. Although its major emphasis was on citrus, the CES also made research contributions to every major crop grown in Southern California.|$|E
40|$|The incidence-severity {{relationship}} for cashew <b>gummosis,</b> caused by Lasiodiplodia theobromae, was studied {{to determine the}} feasibility of using disease incidence to estimate indirectly disease severity {{in order to establish}} the potential damage caused by this disease in semiarid north-eastern Brazil. Epidemics were monitored in two cashew orchards, from 1995 to 1998 in an experimental field composed of 28 dwarf clones, and from 2000 to 2002 in a commercial orchard of a single clone. The two sites were located 10 km from each other. Logarithmic transformation achieved the best linear adjustment of incidence and severity data as determined by coefficients of determination for place, age and pooled data. A very high correlation between incidence and severity was found in both fields, with different disease pressures, different cashew genotypes, different ages and at several epidemic stages. Thus, the easily assessed <b>gummosis</b> incidence could be used to estimate <b>gummosis</b> severity levels...|$|E
40|$|Citrus <b>gummosis,</b> {{caused by}} Phylophthora spp., is an {{important}} citrus disease in Brazil. Almost all citrus rootstock varieties are susceptible to it to some degree, whereas resistance is present in Poncirus trifoliata, a closely related species. {{the objective of this}} study was to detect QTLs linked to citrus Phylophthora <b>gummosis</b> resistance. Eighty individuals of the F, progeny, obtained by controlled crosses between Sunki mandarin Citrus sunki (susceptible) and Poncirus trifoliata cv. Rubidoux (resistant), were evaluated. Resistance to Phytophthora parasitica was evaluated by inoculating stems of young plants with a disc of fungal mycelia and measuring lesion lengths a month later. Two QTLs linked to <b>gummosis</b> resistance were detected in linkage groups I and 5 of the P. trifoliala map, and one QTL in linkage group 2 of the C sunki map. the phenotypic variation explained by individual QTLs was 14 % for C sunki and ranged from 16 to 24 % for P. trifoliala. the low character heritability (h(2) = 18. 7 %) and the detection of more than one QTL associated with citrus Phytophthora <b>gummosis</b> resistance showed that inheritance of the resistance is quantitative.

40|$|The {{effect of}} CO, on ethylene-induced <b>gummosis</b> (secretion of polysaccharides), {{weight loss and}} {{respiration}} in tulip bulbs (Tulipa gesneriana L.) was investigated. A pretreatment with 1 -MCP prevented these ethylene-induced effects, indicating that ethylene action must have been directed via the ethylene receptor. Treatment with 0. 3 Pa ethylene for 2 days caused <b>gummosis</b> on 50 % {{of the total number}} of bulbs of cultivar Apeldoorn, known to be sensitive for <b>gummosis.</b> Addition of CO 2 (10 kPa) reduced the ethylene-induced <b>gummosis</b> to 18 %. In a second experiment the influence of ethylene and CO 2 on respiration and FW loss of bulbs of the cultivar Leen van der Mark was studied. A range of ethylene partial pressures (0. 003 - 0. 3 Pa) was applied continuously for 29 days. Ethylene caused a transient peak in O- 2 consumption rate during the first days after the start of application. The relation between O- 2 consumption rate and ethylene partial pressure could be described by Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Respiratory peaks were reduced by CO 2. This inhibition by CO 2 could not totally be due to competition with ethylene at the receptor binding-site, as was indicated by the use of an O- 2 consumption model. Pre-treatment of bulbs with 1 -MCP and subsequent exposure to CO 2, showed that CO 2 could influence respiration irrespective of any interaction with ethylene. Ethylene and CO 2 both stimulated weight loss. The effect of combined treatments of ethylene and CO 2 on weight loss was at least as strong as the sum of the separate effects, which implies that competition between ethylene and CO 2 at the receptor binding-site was unlikely...|$|E

40|$|The <b>gummosis</b> {{disease is}} caused by Botryosphaeria dothidea (Moug. ex. Fr) Ces. et de Not., {{and it is one}} of the most {{important}} diseases of stone fruits worldwide. The use of biocontrol as an alternative approach to synthetic chemical fungicides has aroused general concern about how to control plant diseases that are caused by phytopathogens. The aim of this study is to isolate Bacillus strains from raw honeys with the capacity to inhibit B. dothidea and to explore the mechanisms by which they could be used in the biocontrol of peach <b>gummosis.</b> Bacillus amyloliquefaciens SYBC H 47 was isolated and identified on the basis of its physiological and biochemical characteristics and its 16 S rRNA and gyrB gene sequences. The cell suspension and the cell-free supernatant of its culture showed significant antifungal activity against Aspergillus niger, Mucor racemosus, Fusarium oxysporum, Penicillium citrinum, and Candida albicans by agar-diffusion assays. The primary antifungal substances were bacillomycin L, fengycin, and surfactin, which were analyzed by HPLC LC/ESI-MS/MS. Bacillomycin L showed the best inhibitory effect against conidial germination of B. dothidea, followed by fengycin and surfactin. Surfactin had limited effects on mycelial growth, contrary to those of bacillomycin L and fengycin. However, a mixture of the three lipopeptides had a synergistic effect that disrupted the structure of the conidia and mycelia. In order to reduce the production cost, the use of waste frying peanut oil and soy oil as the sole carbon source increased the lipopeptide yield levels by approximately 17 % (2. 42 g/L) and 110 % (4. 35 g/L), respectively. In a field trial, the decreases in the infected <b>gummosis</b> rate (IGR) and the disease severity index (DSI) through cell suspension treatments were 20 % and 57. 5 % (in 2014), respectively, and 40 % and 57. 5 % (in 2015), respectively, in comparison with the control. In conclusion, B. amyloliquefaciens SYBC H 47 could inhibit the germination of conidia and the growth of mycelia from B. dothidea; therefore, this strain behaves as a potential biocontrol agent against the <b>gummosis</b> disease...|$|E

In order to know the mode of action of JA-Me on gum induction and/or formation, chemical composition of polysaccharides (after hydrolysis) in gums of apricot shoots induced by JA-Me compared with those by ethephon and their mixture, and naturally occurring ones was studied, resulted in the succesful identification of monosaccharides, and the similarity of a composition consisting of xylose, arabinose and galactose at molar ratio 1 : 10 : 14, respectively. These results suggest that beside different inducers of gum in apricot the mechanism of polysaccharides biosynthesis of gums is the same or similar.

Estima-se que cerca de meio milhão de mudas de cajueiro-anão-precoce sejam produzidas anualmente, sendo a grande maioria delas produzida de propágulos enxertados sobre plântulas oriundas de sementes do clone CCP 06. A principal estratégia de manejo da resinose é o plantio de clones resistentes. Entretanto, entre os aspectos que contribuem para sucessivas epidemias da resinose, destaca-se a falta de estudos de interações genotípicas entre enxerto e porta-enxerto. Este estudo objetivou avaliar o efeito de combinações de clones de cajueiro-anão-precoce usados como enxerto e porta-enxerto na incidência da resinose. Sementes de plantas de polinização aberta de seis clones selecionados foram usadas para produção de porta-enxerto. Os clones comerciais CCP 76 (suscetível) e BRS 226 (resistente) foram usados como enxertos. O experimento foi realizado obedecendo ao delineamento de blocos ao acaso, no esquema fatorial 2 x 6, com quatro repetições e nove plantas por parcela do tipo quadrada, sob condições de elevada pressão da doença, em Pio IX-PI. Três anos após o plantio definitivo, a incidência (I) e a severidade (S) (escala de 0 a 4) da resinose foram superiores no clone CCP 76 (I = 97 % e S= 2, 10) em relação ao BRS 226 (I = 33 % e S= 0, 36), independentemente do porta-enxerto. O clone CP 06 como porta-enxerto foi o único que reduziu a incidência e a severidade da resinose, independentemente do genótipo do enxerto.

40|$|Graduation date: 1991 Bacterial canker, {{caused by}} Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae is {{recognized}} as one of the greatest limiting factors in cherry production in Oregon. Disease incidence may be decreased when susceptible cultivars are high-grafted onto tolerant/resistant rootstocks. This research was begun to develop a rapid screening method which could be used to test cherry rootstocks for tolerance to Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae. In 1988, one-year-old wood of 'Napoleon', 'Corum' and F/ 12 - 1 was collected at monthly intervals from November until January. 'Napoleon' and 'Corum' are found to be susceptible, and F/ 12 - 1 to be tolerant to Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae. Twigs were inoculated with water, one avirulent, and three virulent strains of bacteria at 10 ⁵, 10 ⁶, and 10 ⁷ cfu/ml. Browning, <b>gummosis,</b> and callus production were evaluated at the inoculation site after incubation for 4 weeks. Generally, browning and <b>gummosis</b> induced by concentrations of 10 ⁶ and 10 ⁷ cfu/ml across the virulent strains were not different. No <b>gummosis</b> and browning were observed on twigs inoculated with water or the avirulent strain. Callus production did not appear to be a usable criterion of the disease in this assay. 'Napoleon' and 'Corum' had significantly higher browning and <b>gummosis</b> ratings than F/ 12 - 1. In 1989, one-year-old twigs from 'Napoleon', 'Corum', and a number of cherry rootstocks were collected from October until December. The rootstocks included: F/ 12 - 1, M x M 2, M x M 39, M x M 60, GI 148 - 1, GI 148 - 8, GI 154 - 2, GI 154 - 5, GI 169 - 15, GI 172 - 9, and GI 173 - 9. Twigs were inoculated with water alone as a check, one avirulent and three virulent strains at 10 ⁷ cfu/ml. Incision browning, <b>gummosis</b> and callus production were evaluated after incubation for 4 weeks. Based on incision browning and <b>gummosis</b> all the rootstocks tested were more tolerant than 'Napoleon' and 'Corum', and most did not differ from F/ 12 - 1. However, rootstocks GI 172 - 9 and GI 169 - 15 showed more browning than F/ 12 - 1 in a number of instances. On the last sampling date, rootstocks M x M 2, GI 173 - 9, GI 148 - 8, and GI 154 - 2 showed less browning than F/ 12 - 1. The expression of virulence genes in P. syringae has been shown to be induced by plant signals extracted from cherry leaves. Crude aqueous extracts from 'Napoleon', 'Corum', and various cherry rootstock twigs were adjusted to a concentration of 0. 2, 1. 0, and 2. 0 mg-ml⁻¹, and evaluated for the ability to induce virulence in Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae. A decrease in activity was generally observed at the two highest concentrations of plant extracts. Reduced activity may have been due to inhibition of the assay or saturation of active sites of the enzyme produced by the bacteria. Compared to tolerant genotype F/ 12 - 1, 'Napoleon' and 'Corum' had the highest activity of all the genotypes tested. Rootstocks M x M 60, GI 148 - 1, GI 148 - 9, GI 154 - 5, and GI 169 - 15 had higher activity than F/ 12 - 1 in plant extracts of 0. 2 mg-ml⁻¹. Activity induced in rootstocks MxM 2, MxM 39, GI 154 - 2, GI 172 - 9, and GI 173 - 9 was not different from that of F/ 12 - 1.

The study was conducted in the Multan district using trees rated as 1 - 2 on a decline severity scale and displaying symptoms of <b>gummosis,</b> bark splitting, canker formation, and leaf drooping. Experimental treatments included three plant activators viz. Bion, Planofix, and Root king in conjunction with or without thiophanate methyl, delivered through a macro infusion system. This was the first time a macro infusion system had been used in Pakistan. The injection system delivered the fungicide/activator mixture into the tree trunk under pressure through a series of holes bored into the xylem tissue. Tree disease symptoms were recorded fortnightly to assess the treatment efficacy. After three months, thiophanate methyl, in combination with Bion, was found to be the most effective treatment with trees displaying no apparent disease symptoms. When thiophanate methyl was used alone, or in combination with Root king and Planofix, the symptoms of bark splitting and <b>gummosis</b> persisted...|$|E
40|$|Peach (Prunus persica) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} and widely grown fruit trees in China; however, perennial <b>gummosis</b> on trunks and branches is a major problem in peach orchards of Hubei Province, one of the most important peach production areas of China. In order to identify the gummosis-causing agents, diseased trunks and branches were collected from 11 peach orchards in Hubei Province. Fungal isolates were obtained from these samples, yielding three species: Botryosphaeria dothidea (anamorph Fusicoccum aesculi), B. rhodina (anamorph Lasiodiplodia theobromae), and B. obtus...|$|E
40|$|Due to the {{economic}} importance of <b>gummosis</b> disease for the citriculture, studies on P. parasitica-Citrus interaction comprise a significant part in the Brazilian Citrus genome data bank (CitEST). Among them, two cDNA libraries constructed from two different growth conditions of the P. parasitica pathogen are included which has generated the PP/CitEST database (CitEST - Center APTA Citros Sylvio Moreira/IAC- Millennium Institute). Through this genomic approach and clustering analyses the following has been observed: {{out of a total}} of 13, 285 available in the Phytophthora parasitica database, a group of 4, 567 clusters was formed, comprising 2, 649 singlets and 1, 918 contigs. Out of a total of 4, 567 possible genes, only 2, 651 clusters were categorized; among them, only 4. 3 % shared sequence similarities with pathogenicity factors and defense. Some of these possible genes (103) corresponding to 421 ESTs, were characterized by phylogenetic analysis and discussed. A comparison made with the COGEME database has shown homology which may be part of an evolutionary pathogenicity pathway present in Phytophthora and also in other fungi. Many of the genes which were identified here, which may encode proteins associated to mechanisms of citrus <b>gummosis</b> pathogenicity, represent only one facet of the pathogen-host Phytophthora - Citrus interaction...|$|E

40|$|Background: We have {{investigated}} the effect of 8 weeks aerobic training (AT) and Ferula <b>gummosis</b> supplement (FG) on apelin and apelin receptor (APJ), nitric oxide (NO) and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) of hypertensive rats. Materials and Methods: In a experimental study, 50 adult male wistar rats were classified into five groups; 1 - AT, 2 - FG, 3 - combination of aerobic training + Ferula Gummosa supplement (TFG), 4 - nitro-L-arginine-methyl ester (L-NAME), 5 - shame (control) groups (SH). The rats in the 1 to 4 groups received L-NAME (10 mg/kg, 6 {{times a week for}} 8 weeks). Also, the 1 and 3 groups experienced the training of 15 to 22 m/min for 25 to 64 minutes, 5 times a week for 8 weeks, whereas, the 2 and 3 groups received Ferula <b>gummosis</b> supplement (90 mg/kg, 6 times a week for 8 weeks). However, rats in 5 groups received NaCl solution. Results: At protocols resulted in a significant increase in apelin and APJ as compared to control and L-NAME groups. The TFG protocols resulted in a markedly increase in apelin, APJ and significantly decrease of ACE levels as compared to L-NAME group. Chronically administration of L-NAME resulted increased, ACE, and reduced the levels of apelin, APJ and NO, as compared to control group. Conclusion: The results in this study show that physical regular activity with and without herbal treatment induce amplification in apelin/APJ system and down-regulation blood pressure in L-NAME induced hypertension in the rat kidney tissue. ...|$|E
40|$|Experiments were {{initiated}} to evaluate potential new citrus rootstocks for their relative tolerance or resistance to root rot and <b>gummosis</b> caused by Phytophthora citrophthora and P. parasitica {{and to determine}} the efficacy of potential new fungicides for disease control. In greenhouse trials conducted in 1994 and 1995, the range of root loss due to Phytophthora in the 44 different rootstocks tested ranged from 26 - 96 %. Rootstocks sustaining 80 % or less root loss will be evaluated further to identify those with superior tolerance to Phytophthora. In growth chamber experiments, the same rootstocks were inoculated on the stem to evaluate resistance to <b>gummosis.</b> The length of canker that developed on these test plants ranged from 1 - 25 mm. Rootstocks with canker development {{in the range of}} 1 - 10 mm in length will be tested further to identify the most resistant selections. Laboratory studies were conducted to determine the comparative activity of Aliette, Ridomil, Dimethomorph, Fluazinam, ICIA- 5504, and SM- 9 at concentrations of 1, 10, 100, and 1, 000 mg/l on sporulation and growth of P. citrophthora and P. parasitica. Each of the four new molecules was either comparable or superior to Aliette or Ridomil with respect to activity on at least one component of the life cycle of the Phytophthora species tested. The results presented in this report are preliminary in nature and will be validated in future studies...|$|E
