2500|$|The Electric Fuel Propulsion Company (EFP) of Ferndale, Michigan, {{produced}} {{a number of}} electric cars including the AMC Gremlin based, two-passenger X-144. Introduced in 1973 it featured a [...] direct current motor fueled by a 144-volt cobalt-lead storage batteries designed to reduce the formation of harmful gases during recharging, {{as well as a}} regular 12-volt battery to operate the cars lights, horn, and <b>heater</b> <b>blower.</b> Performance was claimed to be similar to a base gasoline Gremlin, including a top speed of , but with a calculated lower cost per mile for the X-144 over five years and [...] of use.|$|E
50|$|The body {{featured}} a full 12-volt electrical system. It supplied power to concealed four-beam headlights, parking/marker lights, brake lights, backup lights, electric windshield wipers, a single-speed <b>heater</b> <b>blower,</b> and a radio/public address system. With this equipment, the Boilermaker Special III {{was capable of}} day or night operation on most improved roads, including highways.|$|E
50|$|The basic fleet Avenger {{was added}} to the range in February 1972. It was offered with either 1250 or 1500 cc engines (the latter {{available}} with the automatic transmission option). The fleet Avenger was very basic: it did not have a sun visor for the front passenger, and the <b>heater</b> <b>blower</b> had just a single speed. In October 1972, the Avenger GT was replaced by the Avenger GLS, which came with a vinyl roof and Rostyle sports wheels.|$|E
50|$|The {{sales network}} has been {{expanded}} continuously since 1953. In 1963, the first branch was opened in Kägiswil with four employees. The process heat product line encompassing air <b>heaters</b> and <b>blowers</b> was developed {{a short time}} later. The existing location was expanded. All business activities were relocated to Switzerland in 1977. In-house motor fabrication {{was set up in}} 1979.|$|R

5000|$|Base: also {{referred}} to as [...] "S" [...] & [...] "SE" [...] at different points in the model run; first few years the back seat and rear bumperettes were optional, some years the 6cyl engine was an option, other years only the 4cyl was available in the [...] "Base" [...] model. An A/M radio (later AM/FM stereo) with two speakers came standard, as did high-back vinyl bucket seats and a <b>heater</b> and <b>blower.</b> An AM/FM stereo, cassette player, and air conditioning were optional. In 1986, a basic Wrangler Base cost $8,995 MSRP.|$|R
5000|$|By {{the end of}} 1983, 151 Hotspurs {{had also}} been fitted with a fire {{extinguishing}} system operated by the front seat passenger. In the event of the vehicle {{being hit by a}} petrol bomb, as was not uncommon during civil disorder, a dashboard button was pressed. This caused the <b>heater</b> <b>blower</b> and engine fan to switch off, and a fire extinguisher was automatically discharged through a series of pipes into the engine bay and over the windscreen and bonnet.|$|E

40|$|A solar-assisted heat-pump dryer {{and water}} heater has been designed, {{fabricated}} and tested. The {{performance of the}} system has been investigated under the meteorological conditions of Singapore. The system consists of a variable-speed reciprocating compressor, collector evaporator, storage tank, air-cooled condenser, auxiliary <b>heater,</b> <b>blower,</b> dryer, dehumidifier, and air collector. The drying system is designed {{in such a way}} that some of the components can be isolated depending on the weather conditions and usage pattern. The drying medium used is air and the drying chamber is configured to carry out batch drying of food grains. A simulation program is developed using Fortran language to evaluate the performance of the system and the influence of different variables. The performance indices considered to evaluate the performance of the system are: Solar Fraction (SF) and Coefficient of Performance (COP) with and without a water heater. The values of COP, obtained from the simulation and experiment are 7. 0, and 5. 0, respectively, whereas the solar fraction (SF) values of 0. 65 and 0. 61 are obtained from simulation and experiment, respectively.

50|$|A tubular grate heater is any grate or heat {{exchanger}} for a fireplace designed from metal tubing. Through the tubing is circulated home air that becomes heated by the fire. The air is then vented {{back into the}} room and home. It is a heat recovery device that improves the efficiency and ability of a fireplace to get the heat from the fire out and into the home. From simple to ornate, they can contribute significantly to the overall comfort of a room and potentially to a whole house. This in turn will reduce the amount of firewood needed to achieve the same comfort level, potentially reducing heating costs and expenses.Heaters increase the efficiency of a fireplace and hence the amount of heat that makes it from the fireplace out into the home. They work by having naturally convected and forced air funneled into the metal {{heat exchanger}} tubing that is then heated by the coals and/or fire. They draw in cold air from the floor and blow heated air back out into your home. This adds an element of conductive and convective heating to the radiant heat typical of a basic fireplace. Grate heaters have been called many things: heatilator, hearth <b>heater,</b> fireplace <b>blower,</b> fireplace grate <b>heater,</b> Fireplace Furnace, tubular grate heater, etc.|$|R
5000|$|Solvent inks: The main {{ingredient}} of these inks are {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs), organic chemical compounds that have high vapor pressures. Color is achieved with pigments rather than dyes for excellent fade-resistance. The chief advantage of solvent inks {{is that they are}} comparatively inexpensive and enable printing on flexible, uncoated vinyl substrates, which are used to produce vehicle graphics, billboards, banners and adhesive decals. Disadvantages include the vapour produced by the solvent and the need to dispose of used solvent. Unlike most aqueous inks, prints made using solvent-based inks are generally waterproof and ultraviolet-resistant (for outdoor use) without special over-coatings. The high print speed of many solvent printers demands special drying equipment, usually a combination of <b>heaters</b> and <b>blowers.</b> The substrate is usually heated immediately before and after the print heads apply ink. Solvent inks are divided into two sub-categories: hard solvent ink offers the greatest durability without specialized over-coatings but requires specialized ventilation of the printing area to avoid exposure to hazardous fumes, while Mild or [...] "Eco" [...] solvent inks, while still not as safe as aqueous inks, are intended for use in enclosed spaces without specialized ventilation of the printing area. Mild solvent inks have rapidly gained popularity in recent years as their color quality and durability have increased while ink cost has dropped significantly.|$|R
40|$|Drying {{is an old}} and {{well-established}} {{method of}} food preservation. Traditionally, crops (and fish) are spread {{out in the sun}} to dry, but this leaves them vulnerable to the vagaries of the weather to attack by pests and theft by birds and animals. To provide a solution to this problem the Intermediate Technology Group worked on developing an effective drying cabinet that was cheap to build and to run. An initial programme to dry sorrel in St. Vincent in 1974 led to further experimentation in Guatemala, where the need was to dry vegetables. The technology was then further refined and transferred to Peru and other countries in Latin America, where the need was as diverse as herbal teas and fruit. The first system consisted of a simple plywood double-cabinet drier, holding nine trays with air heated by a Benson-letaire <b>heater</b> <b>blower.</b> It was soon realized that the lower trays dried first and could be removed, the upper trays moved down and new trays added to the top. Moving the trays became time-consuming and so a semi-continuous system that allowed the trays to move down the cabinet was developed. The system was adapted in interesting ways to meet local needs and conditions and where fuel was cheap the semicontinuous, fuelefficient design was not always favoured. The drier is now being used in Bangladesh where It is helping a group of landless women process their coconut all year round. It has even been used in Ireland to process organically grown herbs.

50|$|The {{running gear}} {{and most other}} {{components}} stayed the same from the XM through to the XP. All of the utility, sedan delivery, and taxi/police kit vehicles had five-lug 13-inch wheels and larger 10-inch drum brakes, as had all previous commercial models. Commercials had always had lower-ratio differentials (4.00:1) and larger 6.70 x 13 tyres. The high-end Fairmonts came with 14-inch four-lug wheels to accommodate the standard disc brakes on this model, whereas other models had 13-inch wheels if disc brakes were not optioned. Fairmonts featured bucket seats, the 200 ci Super Pursuit engine initially in four-main bearing form and finally with the imported seven-main bearing unit, three-speed automatic transmission, and a padded dash along with carpets, perforated, colour-matched headlining, <b>blower</b> <b>heater,</b> screen washers, chrome-plated interior mirror, seven interior door-operated lights, and a handbrake on warning light flasher as standard. Vacuum-assisted disc brakes were standard in the Fairmont only and optional on other sedan and hardtop models.|$|R
25|$|It was {{not until}} the 1950s that the {{courthouse}} undertook major renovations. In 1955, the distillate stoves were replaced with butane heaters allowing the chimneys to be reduced to roof level while the roof was also replaced. In 1956, the roof would be replaced again for the fifth or sixth time since the building's completion in 1911. New flooring was installed in the courtroom and some offices, and the courtroom ceiling was lowered for acoustics and heating. In the courtroom, theater-style seating was installed while the upper gallery was removed. A new plywood bench for the judge and a jury box with matching railing were built. The stained glass window behind the judge's bench was boarded and plastered. Downstairs, exterior steel doors were installed, and a counter shelf was built for the office of the sheriff and tax-assessor collector along with five fire extinguishers provided for the premises. In 1957, two gas <b>heaters</b> with electric <b>blowers</b> were installed in the space formerly occupied by the courtroom's upper gallery to heat the courtroom. The building's roof would require replacement in 1974 and again 1975.|$|R
40|$|A {{soot blower}} {{is used to}} blow off soot on tubes in a tubular heat exchanger, or a gas <b>heater.</b> The soot <b>blower</b> has a long {{flexible}} tube, that is, a lance tube, 8 m long and 76. 2 mm in diameter, which is put slowly into/out of a gas heater. Steam flows through the lance tube and is discharged at the free end to blow off soot. The lance tube, rotating slowly about its axis at about 12 rpm, is supported at an intermediate position by a support bearing, that is, a lance bearing. Vibrations and noises occurred in operation while a lance tube is being put into a gas heater slowly. They are considered self-excited vibrations due to friction between the lance tube and the lance bearing. From frequency analysis dominant frequencies of the observed vibrations are the eighth to tenth natural frequencies. Experimental study is done to clarify the mechanism of the vibration. Accordingly, backward whirling motion of a shaft is observed. As the clearance between the flexible shaft and the circular support is reduced, higher modes appear...|$|R

40|$|Today, the {{automobile}} industry {{is driven by the}} urge to reduce emissions and to achieve the low CO 2 emission targets that are set by the European Legislation to reduce the average CO 2 emissions of a manufacturer's eet below 95 g/km by 2021. This has led to the focus on Mild Hybrid technology. This involves the introduction of a higher system voltage i. e. 48 V. However, the initial generation of Mild Hybrid Electric Vehicles is expected to have both 48 V and 12 V systems. The {{purpose of this study is}} to evaluate the potential benets of shifting electrical loads to the 48 V supply in the future Mild Hybrid Electric Vehicles at Volvo Car Corporation (VC). A literature study has been carried out to identify the loads on the existing 12 V automotive electrical network that could be considered to be suitable for a 48 V operation. The whole system has been modelled in MatLab R Simulink R and simulations were carried out to evaluate their performance at three temperatures (20 C, + 20 C and + 40 C). The savings in fuel consumption due to moving of loads to the 48 V bus have been analysed. Also, new loads that could improve the user experience have been identied. The complete system has been evaluated for its electrical performance and fuel consumption. The weight reduction by shifting loads to the 48 V bus have also been looked into. The results suggest that the 48 V mild hybrid system eciency is high during high loading condition primarily due to the increased eciency of Belt Driven Starter Generator (BSG). The fuel savings at 20 C, + 20 C and + 40 C have been estimated to be 376 ml/ 100 km, 32 ml/ 100 km and 103 ml/ 100 km respectively for the WLTP cycle. The considerable benet on reduced fuel consumption is also due to the higher amount of energy that is recuperated at 48 V. Due to these abilities of the BSG, it is still advantageous to supply the present day 12 V electrical network from a 48 V BSG through a DC/DC converter. The PTC <b>heaters,</b> defrosters, <b>blowers,</b> EPS, cooling fan and fuel pump could be supplied from a 48 V network in the initial generation of MHEVs...|$|R
