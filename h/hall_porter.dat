60|$|The <b>hall</b> <b>porter,</b> {{who was a}} most {{superior}} person, {{regarded him}} blandly.|$|E
60|$|He sprang out of bed, bathed, dressed, and ate his breakfast. Then {{he lit a}} cigarette, repacked his dressing-case, and {{descended into}} the hall. He {{made his way to}} the <b>hall</b> <b>porter's</b> enquiry office.|$|R
6000|$|... "Once {{more the}} <b>hall</b> <b>porter's</b> eyes wandered as if instinctively {{to a certain}} face in the court; once more he hesitated for many seconds which seemed like so many hours, during which a man's honour, a man's life, hung perhaps in the balance.|$|R
50|$|Some other venues {{have been}} used in recent years, {{including}} <b>Porter</b> <b>Hall</b> 100, <b>Porter</b> <b>Hall</b> 125C and the Helen Wayne Rauh Studio Theatre (in the Purnell Center). As of Fall 2016, most performances are held in the Cohon University Center Studio Theater, a black box theater constructed as part of the University Center expansion and opened in 2016.|$|R
60|$|I {{turned slowly}} away. The <b>hall</b> <b>porter</b> {{followed}} me. He was drawing something from his waistcoat pocket.|$|E
60|$|I {{ordered the}} taxi closed and we {{returned}} to the hotel. The <b>hall</b> <b>porter</b> drew me on one side confidentially.|$|E
6000|$|... "Pretty badly {{scared of}} H----he was!" [...] the <b>hall</b> <b>porter</b> remarked. [...] "Ten minutes after that {{cablegram}} came they were hard at it, packing." ...|$|E
60|$|I won't {{have you}} think that there was {{anything}} remarkable about the man, or anything that would--even momentarily--distinguish him from any number of other <b>hall</b> <b>porters,</b> who wear a uniform and peaked cap, have the air of having seen military service, and wear a couple of medals on a well-developed chest.|$|R
60|$|But {{before the}} Duke's {{somewhat}} long-winded {{series of questions}} had gone very far Mr. Sabin grasped {{the fact that the}} servants had been tampered with. Without wasting any more time he took a somewhat hurried leave and drove back to the hotel. One of the <b>hall</b> <b>porters</b> approached him, smiling.|$|R
50|$|A {{statue of}} Krishna was {{installed}} {{in front of the}} Kumbakonam Town <b>Hall</b> (also called <b>Porter</b> <b>Hall)</b> in 1913 and was dedicated to Raghunatha Rao.|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{does the}} <b>hall</b> <b>porter</b> say?" [...] asked Kenneth, {{who had joined}} the group in time to overhear the last speech and guess what had happened.|$|E
6000|$|... "However, Mr. Vassall walked {{round to}} the hotel and interviewed the <b>hall</b> <b>porter.</b> The latter {{perfectly}} well remembered Mr. Schwarz sending in his card to Prince Semionicz.|$|E
60|$|While Jones {{used the}} {{telephone}} booth {{of the hotel}} Colonel Hathaway conversed with the proprietor, and afterward with the <b>hall</b> <b>porter,</b> who was better posted and spoke better English.|$|E
50|$|In Buffalo, the Karpeles Museum {{consists}} of two separate buildings: (1) <b>Porter</b> <b>Hall</b> at 453 <b>Porter</b> Avenue at Jersey Street and Plymouth Avenue and (2) North Hall at 220 North Street at Elmwood Avenue. The <b>Porter</b> <b>Hall</b> was originally the Plymouth Methodist Church, while the North Hall was originally First Church of Christ, Scientist, built in 1911.|$|R
60|$|Just {{then the}} cab drew {{up outside the}} Langham Hotel. The every-day world had {{returned}} with its flaring electric lights, its <b>hall</b> <b>porters,</b> its noise and bustle, and chased away the illusions {{of the past few}} moments. Luke jumped out, ready to help Lou down--a happy second that, for her hand must needs rest in his.|$|R
60|$|As {{he reached}} the <b>hall</b> the <b>porter</b> {{came up to him}} with his cloak.|$|R
6000|$|The <b>hall</b> <b>porter,</b> {{who knew}} her, after calling to a page-boy: [...] "Major Winton--sharp, now!" [...] came {{specially}} {{out of his}} box to offer her a seat and The Times.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Ledsam desired me to say, sir," [...] the <b>hall</b> <b>porter</b> continued, [...] "to any of {{his friends}} who might be here, {{that he will be}} in to lunch to-morrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ryder," [...] {{he began}} quite {{abruptly}} at last, [...] "had the <b>hall</b> <b>porter</b> of that confounded club {{up to his}} room while I was there, and questioned him before me." ...|$|E
50|$|The chairs {{still exist}} to this day. One of them (also {{known as the}} <b>Hall</b> <b>Porter's</b> Chair) stands in the {{entrance}} to 10 Downing Street; the other is owned by a private collector of furniture. In the adjacent picture, fraying of the inner arm rests is evident. This {{is the result of}} the guards' pistols repeatedly rubbing against the fabric during their watch.|$|R
5000|$|... 1895 - International Organization of Good Templars built a {{community}} <b>hall</b> in <b>Porter</b> Street, {{dedicated to the}} abstinence from alcohol.|$|R
60|$|Luke sat farther on, and, {{as he was}} {{slightly}} turned toward her, she could watch his face all the while that {{she listened to the}} <b>hall</b> <b>porter's</b> evidence. It was perfectly still, the features as if moulded in wax; the eyes which actually were a clear hazel appeared quite dark and almost as if they had sunk back within their circling lids. He sat with arms folded, and not a muscle in face or body moved. No stone-carved image could have been more calm, none could have been so mysterious.|$|R
60|$|The {{next morning}} at twelve o'clock I took a taxi-cab round to Banton Street. The <b>hall</b> <b>porter,</b> who was {{beginning}} to know me well, seemed a little surprised at my appearance.|$|E
6000|$|... "What club {{do they go}} to? I {{called in}} at the Atheneum last night, {{thinking}} to find Radclyffe there, but the <b>hall</b> <b>porter</b> {{told me that he}} never went there now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Really, Boris, you are absurdly suspicious. I believe she's {{the cousin}} of the <b>hall</b> <b>porter,</b> or {{something}} of the kind. And nobody even dreams that I have any connection with our--mutual friend, Mr. Brown." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll get word soon, never fear," [...] replied his uncle, {{and then}} advised Dave to finish out his term at Oak <b>Hall,</b> Mr. <b>Porter</b> in the {{meantime}} remaining a guest of the Wadsworth family.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: <b>Porter</b> <b>Hall</b> (now President's Hall) at {{the former}} Colorado Women's College campus ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Porter</b> <b>Hall</b> as Jacob Q. Boot, editor, publisher, {{and owner}} of the Albuquerque Sun-Bulletin ...|$|R
60|$|Tuppence withdrew. The smart Annie {{was not in}} evidence. In {{the hall}} below a {{magnificent}} <b>hall</b> <b>porter</b> had relegated Albert to the background. Tuppence did not even glance at him as she passed meekly out.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{called at}} your place," [...] Mr. Carmyle was saying, [...] "and the <b>hall</b> <b>porter</b> {{told me that}} you were here, so I ventured to follow you. I hope you do not mind? May I smoke?" ...|$|E
60|$|I got Pyecraft's address {{from the}} <b>hall</b> <b>porter.</b> Pyecraft {{inhabited}} {{the upper half}} of a house in Bloomsbury, and I went there so soon as I had done my coffee and Trappistine. I did not wait to finish my cigar.|$|E
50|$|Westover is {{a member}} of the New England Prep Athletic Council and the Western New England Prep School Athletic Association (WNEPSAA). Some of the schools from WNEPSAA that Westover plays are Gunnery, Kingswood-Oxford, Kent, Miss <b>Hall's,</b> Miss <b>Porter's,</b> Taft, and Westminster.|$|R
5000|$|In February 1866, the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) of New York's Executive Committee privately {{distributed}} {{a report}} that was written by Cephas Brainerd and Robert McBurney entitled, [...] "A Memorandum Respecting New-York as a Field for Moral and Christian Effort Among Young Men." [...] This memorandum linked the main message of the Y.M.C.A. to facts and figures that were drawn from the census, tax data, and licensing reports. All of this data was used to support {{the fact that many}} of the younger, more unsupervised members of the society had more than enough free time in the evenings to spend in billiard saloons, gambling <b>halls,</b> <b>porter</b> houses, and houses of prostitution and assignation.|$|R
5000|$|Ion Storm Inc. (sometimes spelled ION Storm) was a Texas based {{developer}} of computer games founded by John Romero, Tom <b>Hall,</b> Todd <b>Porter,</b> and Jerry O'Flaherty, under the slogan [...] "Design is Law". Hall and Romero were former employees of id Software.|$|R
