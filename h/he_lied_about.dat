5|$|On 10 May, Van der Sloot {{allegedly}} {{accepted the}} amount of $15,000 by wire transfer to his account in the Netherlands, following a cash payment of $10,000 that was videotaped by undercover investigators in Aruba. In exchange, Van der Sloot told Kelly that his father buried Holloway's remains in {{the foundation of a}} house. Authorities determined that this information was false, because the house had not yet been built at the time of Holloway's disappearance. Van der Sloot later e-mailed Kelly that <b>he</b> <b>lied</b> <b>about</b> the house. Holloway was shocked that the FBI did not promptly file extortion charges against Van der Sloot, allowing him to leave freely with the money to Bogotá, Colombia, on his way to Lima, Peru. The FBI and the office of the U.S. Attorney contended that the case had not yet been sufficiently developed.|$|E

25|$|As Presley's fame grew, {{people became}} {{interested}} in Parker as well. For a time, <b>he</b> <b>lied</b> <b>about</b> his childhood, claiming {{to have been born}} in Huntington, West Virginia, and to have run away at an early age to join a circus run by an uncle. The truth about his early years was revealed when his family in the Netherlands recognized him in photographs standing next to Presley.|$|E

25|$|Peregory's {{mother died}} in 1931, forcing him to quit school to help his father support his seven siblings. In May, Peregory joined Company K (Monticello Guard) of the 116th Infantry Regiment of the Virginia National Guard at Charlottesville, the seat of Albemarle County. Because Peregory was only fifteen at the time, <b>he</b> <b>lied</b> <b>about</b> his year of birth, and this {{misinformation}} became part of his permanent record along with the presumably accidental misspelling of his surname. In 1941, Peregory married Bessie Kirby. Before {{the entrance of the}} United States into World War II, Peregory's unit was inducted into federal service on February 3, 1941.|$|E

25|$|Some {{classical}} and modern scholars have analyzed Abraham's reasoning for hiding Sarah's position as his wife. Rashi argued {{that when a}} stranger comes to town, the proper thing {{to do would be}} to inquire if he needs food and drink, not whether his female companion is a married woman, and hence as Abimelech did the latter, it tipped off Abraham {{to the fact that there}} is no fear of God in this place, and so <b>he</b> <b>lied</b> <b>about</b> his relationship with Sarah in order to avoid being killed. Christian interpretation of the incidents has varied considerably. Some commentators have seen them as regrettable exceptions in the lives of those who otherwise lived upright lives, comparable to Noah's and Lot's drunkenness and David's adultery.|$|E
25|$|The Case of Executing Chen Shimei (鍘美案): Chen Shimei had two {{children}} with wife Qin Xianglian, when he left them behind in his hometown for the Imperial examination in the capital. After placing first, <b>he</b> <b>lied</b> <b>about</b> his marriage and became the emperor’s new brother-in-law. Years later, a famine forced Qin and her children {{to move to the}} capital, where they learned what happened to Chen. Qin finally found a way to meet Chen and begged him to help at least his own children. Not only did Chen refuse, he sent his servant Han Qi to kill them to hide his secret, but Han helped the family escape and killed himself. Desperate, Qin brought her case to Bao Zheng, who tricked Chen to the court to have him arrested. The imperial family intervened with threats, but Bao executed him nonetheless.|$|E
50|$|On June 6, 2016 Prosecutors {{agreed to}} drop the charges against Kerry Max Cook; this was {{motivated}} in part by James Mayfield's admission that <b>he</b> had <b>lied</b> <b>about</b> not having sex with the victim for weeks.|$|R

25|$|In January 1965, {{five months}} after Bolden's trial and sentencing, Spagnoli was found guilty on {{counterfeiting}} charges and sentenced to fifteen years. At his trial, Spagnoli said his livelihood was gambling, that he had falsely testified in Bolden's trial that his mother supported him, and that this false testimony was suborned by the government counsel {{in order to improve}} the jury's opinion of him. He said that <b>he</b> <b>lied</b> <b>about</b> the date of his first contact with Agent Martineau and may have lied about other dates. On the basis of this information, Bolden appealed his conviction as well as the denial of a motion for a retrial to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. In addition, he claimed that Perry's Allen charge in the first trial was evidence that Perry was not impartial and that his failure to recuse himself denied Bolden a fair trial.|$|E
25|$|Before the 1999 season, the Blue Jays traded Clemens to the Yankees for {{starting}} pitcher David Wells, second baseman Homer Bush and relief pitcher Graeme Lloyd. They also fired manager Tim Johnson during spring training after <b>he</b> <b>lied</b> <b>about</b> several things (including killing {{people in the}} Vietnam War) in order to motivate his players. The Blue Jays had initially been willing to stand by Johnson. A blizzard of questions about his credibility during spring training, however, led Ash to fire him {{less than a month}} before opening day. Johnson was replaced with Jim Fregosi, who managed the Phillies when they lost to the Blue Jays in the 1993 World Series. The offense picked up somewhat in 1999, but the pitching suffered without Clemens, as the Blue Jays finished at 84–78, in third place. After the 1999 season, the Blue Jays' original mascot for 20 years, BJ Birdy, was replaced by a duo named Ace & Diamond.|$|E
25|$|On May 30, 1861, Lewis Powell {{left home}} and {{traveled}} to Jasper, Florida, where he enlisted in Company I of the 2nd Florida Infantry. He was accepted because <b>he</b> <b>lied</b> <b>about</b> his age (he {{claimed to be}} 19). Powell's unit fought in March and April 1862 in the Peninsula Campaign. Powell became a battle-hardened and effective soldier. He won praise from his commanding officers, and claimed that when he shot his rifle he did so to kill (never to wound). He was alleged to have carried the skull of a Union soldier with him, which he used as an ashtray. His one-year enlistment having expired, Powell received a two-month furlough, during which time he returned home to visit his family. He re-enlisted at Jasper on May 8, 1862. In November 1862, Powell fell ill and was hospitalized at General Hospital No. 11 in Richmond, Virginia. He returned to active duty within a few weeks, and fought in the Battle of Fredericksburg (December 11–15, 1862) near Fredericksburg, Virginia. His unit was then assigned to Third Corps, Army of Northern Virginia, which was organized {{at the beginning of}} 1863. Third Corps finally went into combat at the Battle of Gettysburg, July 1–3, 1863.|$|E

25|$|Around March 29, 2010, Joran van der Sloot {{contacted}} Twitty's attorney John Q. Kelly with {{an offer}} to reveal the location of her daughter's body and the circumstances surrounding her death for an advance of US$25,000 against a total of $250,000. Kelly said that he secretly went to Aruba in April to meet with Van der Sloot, who was desperate for money, and gave him $100. Kelly notified the Federal Bureau of Investigation {{to set up a}} sting operation with the Aruban authorities. On May 10, Van der Sloot accepted the amount of $15,000 by wire transfer from Birmingham to his account in the Netherlands, following a cash payment of $10,000 that was videotaped by undercover investigators in Aruba. In exchange, Van der Sloot told Kelly that his father buried Natalee's remains in the foundation of a house. Authorities determined that the information that he in return provided was false, because the house had not yet been built at the time of Natalee's disappearance. Van der Sloot later e-mailed Kelly that <b>he</b> <b>lied</b> <b>about</b> the house. Holloway was shocked that the FBI did not promptly file extortion charges against Van der Sloot, allowing him to leave freely with the money to Bogotá, Colombia, on his way to Lima, Peru. The FBI and the Office of the U.S. Attorney in Birmingham later claimed in a joint statement that they were working as quickly as possible and that the Lima murder was in no way the result of them allowing Van der Sloot to flee Aruba with the extorted money.|$|E
