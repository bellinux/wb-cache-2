40|$|Childbirth by cesarean section (c-section) is major {{abdominal}} surgery that carries risk to {{both mother and}} baby. There are reasons to suggest that c-section rates at rural <b>hospitals</b> might be different than c-section rates at urban <b>hospitals.</b> The diffusion of best practices, such as the safe delivery of infants by vaginal births to women with previous deliveries by c-section (VBAC), may be slower in rural communities, resulting in higher c-section rates at rural <b>hospitals.</b> There may also be non-medical reasons for an increased rate in rural facilities, particularly small <b>hospitals.</b> For example, lack of surgical coverage on weekends could lead to scheduled c-sections in anticipation of problems necessitating surgical intervention. This study examines delivery patterns in rural <b>hospitals</b> and compares the c-section rate in rural <b>hospitals</b> to that in urban <b>hospitals</b> using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS). Findings include: Rural <b>hospitals</b> were less likely than urban <b>hospitals</b> to provide any type of delivery services (70 % v. 76 %). However, smaller rural <b>hospitals</b> {{were much more likely}} to provide delivery services than were their smaller urban counterparts. Overall c-section rates were higher, though only slightly, in rural <b>hospitals</b> compared to urban <b>hospitals</b> (25. 3 % vs 24. 9 %.) When urban <b>hospitals</b> were categorized as teaching or non-teaching, the rate in the urban non-teaching <b>hospitals</b> was identical to the rural rate. Rural <b>hospitals</b> had a higher c-section rate on weekdays than did urban <b>hospitals</b> and a lower rate on weekends. Comparing rural and urban <b>hospitals</b> of similar sizes, c-section rates were generally higher in the rural <b>hospitals</b> with statistically significant differences in three of five size categories. The difference between rural and urban rates ranged from 0. 1 to 5. 8 percentage points with the largest difference noted for the smallest <b>hospitals</b> (< 10 average daily census).
