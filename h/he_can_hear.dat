5|$|Charged {{with the}} crime of heresy, based on her claim of visions and signs from God, she is tried in an ecclesiastical court proceeding, which is forced by the English {{occupation}} government. The English wish to quickly condemn and execute Joan since English soldiers are afraid to fight while she remains alive, based on their belief that she could supernaturally affect battles even while in prison. Bishop Cauchon expresses his fear of wrongfully executing someone who might have received visions from God. About to be burned for heresy, Joan is distraught {{that she will be}} executed without making a final confession. The Bishop tells her she must recant her visions before <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> her confession. Joan signs the recantation. The relieved Bishop shows the paper to the English, saying that Joan can no longer be burned as a heretic. Whilst in her cell, Joan is confronted by an unnamed cloaked man (Dustin Hoffman), who is implied to be Joan's conscience. The man makes Joan question whether she was actually receiving messages from God.|$|E

25|$|A year later, the new Abbé {{arrives at}} Charenton and {{is given the}} grand tour by Royer-Collard. During the tour they meet the maid Charlotte and through the {{exchange}} between herself and Royer-Collard {{it is apparent that}} there is a connection. The asylum has been converted into a print shop, with the inmates as its staff. The books being printed are the works of the Marquis de Sade. At the end of the tour, the new Abbé meets his predecessor, who resides in the Marquis' old cell. Yearning to write, he begs paper and a quill from the new Abbé, and tries to strangle Royer-Collard when he ventures to close the peephole. The Abbé is herded off by Royer-Collard before <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> anymore from his predecessor. However, the peephole opens, and Madeleine's mother thrusts paper, quill, and ink through. The Abbé begins to scribble furiously, with the Marquis providing the narration.|$|E

500|$|To {{create the}} effect of the Angels rocking the TARDIS Mulligan and Robertson threw {{themselves}} around the ship's set. The camera's operator then shook the camera in the opposite direction that Mulligan and Robertson threw themselves. The scene wherein the Doctor talks to Sally via a DVD extra was created by writing a conversation, removing Sally's lines, then having David Tennant record his lines. Moffat felt that this one-way filming made the performance more convincing. Moffat initially wrote placeholder dialogue in the script for the scene where the Doctor tells Sally that <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> her in the DVD shop, because he knew the lines that appeared would have to play [...] "double duty later on" [...] and be authentic and fresh both times. Gold called the sequences [...] "the heart of the Chinese puzzle".|$|E
500|$|According to Gaga, Bennett {{wanted her}} to sing {{different}} songs and was impressed by her vocals during [...] "Lush Life", referring to the Billy Strayhorn written standard that has been recorded by everyone from Nancy Wilson and Sarah Vaughan to Donna Summer and Linda Ronstadt. Gaga explained that she was nervous about recording with Bennett. [...] "I just wanted him to hear I have an authentic jazz voice and that I studied that... If <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> that, I'm okay. If he can't hear it, I'm not an authentic jazz voice", she added. Inspiration for singing came from jazz singer Amy Winehouse, who died in July 2011; Gaga added [...] "I thought of her almost {{every day in the}} studio. I wish she was still here. She was jazz to her core". The songs were recorded live with the band, and during the recording process Gaga asked for carpets to be placed on the studio floor, so that it looked like a film set and it could be photographed.|$|E
500|$|Miles {{was born}} in March 1977. [...] As a child, {{he lives with his}} mother Lara Chang (Leslie Ishii) in Encino, California. [...] Miles does not know his father, only being told by his mother that he is dead and did not care about them when he was alive, forcing them to leave him when Miles is a baby.

[...] In early December 2004, when he is twenty-seven years old, Miles is hired for $1.6 million by Charles Widmore to go on a freighter called the Kahana to an uncharted island to retrieve a mass murderer named Ben Linus, as Widmore believes that Miles will be able to communicate with those whom he had killed and gain information regarding his location. [...] Before he leaves, Miles is briefly abducted by Bram (Brad William Henke) and his team. Bram claims to know about Miles's father and the source of his superpower and he warns Miles not to go on this mission, instead trying to convince Miles to join him.|$|E

2500|$|Multiple {{consoles}} can be {{used for}} different applications in a single sound reinforcement system. [...] The Front of House (FOH) mixing console must be located where the operator can see the action on stage and hear the output of the loudspeaker system.

2500|$|At a United States Senate hearing, former {{chairman}} Lynne Cheney criticized Eminem and sponsor Seagram for [...] "promot {{violence of the}} most degrading kind against women", labeling him as [...] "a rap singer who advocates murder and rape".

He talks about choking women slowly so <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> their screams for a long time. He talks about using O.J.'s machete on women, {{and this is a}} man who is honored by the recording industry". Cheney drew a link between the Columbine massacre and violent music, mentioning artists Eminem and Marilyn Manson as musicians that contribute to the United States' culture of violence. [...] Although she stated that she has [...] "long been a vocal supporter of free speech", Cheney called for the music industry to impose age-restrictions on those who can purchase music with violent content.|$|E
2500|$|In the Prose Edda, Heimdallr is {{mentioned}} in the books Gylfaginning, Skáldskaparmál, and Háttatal. In Gylfaginning, the enthroned figure of High tells the disguised mythical king Gangleri of various gods, and, in chapter 25, mentions Heimdallr. High says that Heimdallr is known [...] "the white As", is [...] "great and holy", and that nine maidens, all sisters, gave birth to him. Heimdallr is called Hallinskiði and Gullintanni, and he has gold teeth. High continues that Heimdallr lives in [...] "a place" [...] called Himinbjörg {{and that it is}} near Bifröst. Heimdallr is the watchman of the gods, and he {{sits on the edge of}} heaven to guard the Bifröst bridge from the berg jötnar. Heimdallr requires less sleep than a bird, can see at night just as well as if it were day, and for over a hundred leagues. Heimdallr's hearing is also quite keen; <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> grass as it grows on the earth, wool as it grows on sheep, and anything louder. Heimdallr possesses a trumpet, Gjallarhorn, that, when blown, can be heard in all worlds, and [...] "the head is referred to as Heimdall's sword". High then quotes the above-mentioned Grímnismál stanza about Himinbjörg and provides two lines from the otherwise lost poem about Heimdallr, Heimdalargaldr, in which Heimdallr proclaims himself to be the son of Nine Mothers.|$|E

2500|$|St. Elsewheres series finale {{featured}} momentous {{changes for}} several main characters, including the departures of Drs. Fiscus and Morrison {{and the death}} of Dr. Auschlander, as well as the return of Dr. Westphall to an active leadership role at St. Eligius after Ecumena agrees to sell the hospital back to the Boston archdiocese, as Dr. Gideon is set to move on to another hospital in San Jose, California. [...] The finale is more known for its provocative final scene: Westphall and his son Tommy Westphall (played by Chad Allen), who has autism, are seen in Dr. Auschlander's office watching snow falling outside. The image cuts to an exterior shot of the hospital. At that moment, Tommy and Daniel Auschlander are seen in an apartment building, with Tommy playing with a snow globe. Donald arrives home from a day of work, and {{it is clear from the}} uniform he wears and the dialog in this scene that he works in construction. [...] "Auschlander" [...] is revealed to be Donald's father, and thus Tommy's grandfather. Donald laments to his father, [...] "I don't understand this autism thing, Pop. Here's my son. I talk to him. I don't even know if <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> me, because he sits there, all day long, in his own world, staring at that toy. What's he thinking about?" [...] As Tommy shakes the snow globe, he is told by his father to come and wash his hands for dinner. Donald places the snow globe on the family's television set and walks into the kitchen with Tommy and Auschlander; as they leave the room, the camera closes in on the snow globe—which holds a replica of St. Eligius.|$|E
