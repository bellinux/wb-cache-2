2500|$|As in the {{previous}} instalments, Stuart Craig and Stephenie McMillan provided the film's art and set designs, respectively. Due to the film's scope, there were many new sets and transformations of old sets created. McMillan was most excited about redesigning the Great Hall for the scenes involving the Yule Ball. [...] "Originally we thought silver curtains, silver table cloths and an ice dance floor," [...] said McMillan, [...] "but it just went on and on. The drapes man eventually said, 'Why not <b>just</b> <b>stick</b> the fabrics on the wall?'" [...] Each task of the Triwizard Tournament required massive sets. The rock quarry set for the first task, where Harry faces off with the Hungarian Horntail, was built in two sections at Leavesden Studios. Craig called it [...] "one of the biggest sets we've ever built {{for any of the}} films." [...] For the second task, involving the film's underwater scenes, the film crew designed and built a blue screen tank holding [...] "about half a million gallons of water." [...] As for the final task, which took place in the maze, hedge walls ranging from 20 to 40 feet tall were constructed and enhanced with computer-generated imagery.|$|E

(Harris had also played Maigret on television four years before Gambon took that role.) Gambon reprised the role of Dumbledore in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, which was released in November 2005 in the United Kingdom and the United States. He returned to the role again in the fifth film, 2007's Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, and the sixth film, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. He appeared in the seventh film; Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Parts I and II, released in two parts in 2010 and 2011. Gambon told an interviewer that, when playing Dumbledore, he does not [...] "have to play anyone really. I <b>just</b> <b>stick</b> on a beard and play me, so it's no great feat.

6000|$|On November 7 of this {{laborious}} year, 1814, Scott {{was writing}} to Mr. Joseph Train, thanking {{him for a}} parcel of legendary lore, including the Galloway tale of the wandering astrologer and a budget of gypsy traditions. Falling in the rich soil of Scott's imagination, {{the tale of the}} astrologer yielded a name and an opening to [...] "Guy Mannering," [...] while the gypsy lore blossomed into the legend of Meg Merrilies. The seed of the novel was now sown. But between November 11 and December 25 Scott was writing the three last cantos of the [...] "Lord of the Isles." [...] Yet before the [...] "Lord of the Isles" [...] was published (Jan. 18, 1815), two volumes of [...] "Guy Mannering" [...] were in print (Letter to Morritt, Jan. 17, 1815.) The novel was issued on Feb. 14, 1815. Scott, as he says somewhere, was like the turnspit dog, into whose wheel a hot cinder is dropped to encourage his activity. Scott needed hot cinders in the shape of proof-sheets fresh from the press, and he worked most busily when the printer's devil was waiting. In this case, not only the printer's devil, but the wolf was at the door. The affairs of the Ballantynes clamoured for moneys In their necessity and his own, Scott wrote at the rate of a volume in ten days, and for some financial reason published [...] "Guy Mannering" [...] with Messrs. Longmans, not with Constable. Scott was at this moment facing creditors and difficulties as Napoleon faced the armies of the Allies,--present everywhere, everywhere daring and successful. True, his [...] "Lord of the Isles" [...] was a disappointment, as James Ballantyne informed him. [...] "'Well, James, so be it; but you know we must not droop, for we cannot afford to give over. Since one line has failed, we must <b>just</b> <b>stick</b> to something else.' And so he dismissed me, and resumed his novel." ...|$|E

6000|$|A kindred wonder in my {{eyes was}} the nature of his courage. There was never a braver man: he went out to welcome danger; an {{emergency}} (came it never so sudden) strung him like a tonic. And yet, upon the other hand, I have known none so nervous, so oppressed with possibilities, looking upon the world at large, and the life of a sailor in particular, with so constant and haggard a consideration of the ugly chances. All his courage was in blood, not merely cold, but icy with reasoned apprehension. He would lay our little craft rail under, and [...] "hang on" [...] in a squall, until I gave myself up for lost, and the men were rushing to their stations of their own accord. [...] "There," [...] he would say, [...] "I guess there's not a man on board would have hung on as long as I did that time: they'll have to give up thinking me no schooner sailor. I guess I can shave just as near capsizing as any other captain of this vessel, drunk or sober." [...] And then he would fall to repining and wishing himself well out of the enterprise, and dilate on the peril of the seas, the particular dangers of the schooner rig, which he abhorred, the various ways in which we might go to the bottom, and the prodigious fleet of ships that have sailed out in the course of history, dwindled from the eyes of watchers, and returned no more. [...] "Well," [...] he would wind up, [...] "I guess it don't much matter. I can't see what any one wants to live for, anyway. If I could get into some one else's apple-tree, and be about twelve years old, and <b>just</b> <b>stick</b> the way I was, eating stolen apples, I won't say. But there's no sense in this grown-up business--sailorising, politics, the piety mill, {{and all the rest of}} it. Good clean drowning is good enough for me."
