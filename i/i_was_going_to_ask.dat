500|$|An {{accomplished}} writer, series creator Nic Pizzolatto {{delved into}} fiction writing and published a novel, titled Galveston (2010), before being appointed as a screenwriter for AMC's The Killing the following year. It was {{around this time}} that Pizzolatto was preparing to branch out into television, an endeavor that, {{due to a lack}} of capital, was never fully realized. He had already begun writing True Detective as his next novel, but later, once the project took definite form, felt it was more suitable on screen. [...] "I'd always had plans from the first time I'd talked to an agent from Hollywood, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> how you break into this business, and particularly cable-TV writing, because in television the writer stays in control, which is what the concept of show runner is", he remembers. Pizzolatto pitched Galveston to several executives, and from May to July 2010, he drafted six screenplays, including a spec script for [...] "The Long Bright Dark" [...] which consumed 90 pages. Shortly thereafter, he secured a development deal with HBO for a potential pilot series.|$|E
