5000|$|In this scenario, it {{is clear}} how urban areas, {{as well as their}} urban design, {{play a key role in}} the {{definition}} of a long-term strategy for a sustainable development, despite other ephemeral remedies. Reconsidering the location where cities should be located and designed could reduce the CO2 emissions and energy demand, accordingly. In fact, the ultimate goal of our methodology is to identify useful principles and tools, aiming to direct the increasing world urbanization towards more sustainable long-term models, which are characterized by better energy performance and, consequently, better balance that would be achieved between the available resources and the required consumptionThe enthralling report of the US Energy Information Administration reveals that as the world energy consumption increased from 472 quadrillion Btu in 2006, it will increase further to 552 quadrillion Btu in 2015, and 678 quadrillion Btu in 2030, which a total increase of 44 per cent over the projection period. Also in all EU Member States, gross <b>inland</b> <b>consumption</b> of primary energy had increased throughout the period from 1999 to 2009, except for the United Kingdom (−10.1%). Additionally, the World Bank report illustrates that the modern patterns of city growth are increasingly land-intensive. [...] "Average urban densities (that is, the number of inhabitants per square kilometre of built-up area) have been declining for the past two centuries. As transportation continues to improve, the tendency is for cities to use up more and more land per person. The built-up area of cities with populations of 100,000 or more presently occupy a total of about 400,000 km2, half of it in the developing world. Cities in developing countries have many more people, but occupy less space per inhabitant. In both developing and industrialized countries, the average density of cities has been declining quickly: at an annual rate of 1.7 per cent over the last decade in developing countries and 2.2 per cent in industrialized countries". The significance impacts of urban form on energy performances of city, as well as emitted pollution, has been illustrated by different researches. The major part of mentioned studies explicates that the reduction of the residential density matches the steady increase in the amount of energy needs.In this scenario, {{it is clear}} how urban areas as well as urban design play a key role in the definition of a long term strategy for a sustainable development, despite the other ephemeral remedies: [...] "Although cities embody environmental damage, namely, increasing emissions due to transportation, energy consumption and other factors, policymakers and experts increasingly recognize the potential value of cities for long-term sustainability, after all, the majority of energy is consumed in cities. Therefore, sustainability is an urban issue". Consequently, new demands have risen, and fundamental questions to which the city has to deal with, such as: How can the city contribute to overall urban sustainability? Can urban design contribute with an appropriate approach to climate mitigation and emission reduction? Is the urban form correlated with these issues? And eventually, how can the urban transformation be performed, in order to achieve a sustainable urban form? And moreover, how can a city address both its competitive status, development and its ecological stewardship?IMM theory considers the city as a complex adaptive system. Furthermore, it sketches out the relationships between urban morphology and energy consumption, providing some new basic design principles to re-shape urban assessment, as well as designing new sustainable neighbourhoods as an integrated part of the city. Morphology plays an essential role for any energy-saving policy, urban efficiency, liveability and, generally, sustainable urban environments to succeed. It is necessary to adopt new principles and new urban design methodologies. One of the main objectives of the research is to find, thanks to a holistic and multidisciplinary approach, new methodologies that can help to shape a better comprehension of the different performances of different urban assessment; then, to apply to the new design principles in order to improve the system's performance. A complex system, to put it in a nutshell, is an arrangement of interconnected heterogeneous elements that, as a whole, shows one or more performances, and the fi nal result of the whole system is utterly different from every individual constituent's performance. The Complex Adaptive System (CAS) is a particular case of the complex system with the ability to learn from prior experiences. System’s agents adapt themselves to improve their performance, in response to new internal and external constraints. CAS refers to a field of study and resultant conceptual framework for natural and artificial systems that defy reductionist (top-down) investigation. Such systems are generally interactions result is in non-linear complex dynamics, whose results are emergent system phenomena.The system is composed of heterogeneous elements with several functions that should be classified in different ways. The members who both share the same function or a specific one are directly related to each other and categorized in a subsystem. The subsystems are often a complex adaptive system in their own right.|$|E

The empirical study is performed using a VAR approach with the application of aggregated data of EU 15 over the period 1995 to 2012. The results provide the evidence that the reactions of greenhouse gas emission and gross <b>inland</b> energy <b>consumption</b> to the shocks of environmental policy instruments are strong, mainly in the short term and decay to zero after about 8 years. Further, the reactions of the environmental policy instruments to the shocks of greenhouse gas emission and gross <b>inland</b> energy <b>consumption</b> are also strong in the short term, however with the deferred effects.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{gives an}} {{overview}} of the current state, recent developments and future prospects of bioenergy use in Central Europe with a special focus on the European Union’s targets in the field of renewable energy sources. Currently, the share of biomass and wastes in the total gross <b>inland</b> energy <b>consumption</b> ranges from 2. 4 % in Italy to 14. 2 % in Denmark (2007). Efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase the share of renewable energy sources as well as EU directives and according promotion schemes have led to notable progress in the use of biomass in some Central European countries. Especially in the field of biofuels for transport and electricity generation, high growth rates could be observed in recent years. There are considerable unused biomass resource potentials in some Central European countries. However, if serious efforts are put in fulfilling EU- and national energy policy targets, the biomass potentials in Central Europe need to be tapped to a large extent by 2020. This paper summarizes the core results of scenarios for the future development of biomass use in Central European countries and in more detail for the case of Austria. These scenarios provide insight into the importance of biomass for the future energy supply in Central Europe and help to reveal critical issues...|$|R
40|$|Energy {{dependency}} (ED) {{implies the}} extent to which an economy relies upon imports in order to meet its energy needs. The ED is calculated as net imports divided by the sum of gross <b>inland</b> energy <b>consumption</b> plus bunkers. This study aims at obtaining numerical equations to estimate of Turkey's energy dependency based on basic energy indicators and sectoral energy consumption by using artificial neural network (ANN) technique. It seeks to contribute to the strategies necessary to preserve the supply-demand balance of Turkey. For this purpose, two different models were used to train the ANN approach. In Model 1, main energy indicators such as total production of primary energy per capita, total gross electricity generation per capita and final energy consumption per capita were used in the input layer of the ANN while sectoral energy consumption per capita was used in Model 2. The ED was in the output layer for both models. Different models were employed to estimate the ED with a high confidence for future projections. The R 2 values of ED were found to be 0. 999 for both models. In accordance with the analysis results, ED is expected to increase from 72 % to 82 % within 14 years of period. Consequently, the utilization of renewable energy sources and nuclear energy is strictly recommended to ensure the ED stability in Turkey.

Serious problems of energy shortage and power rationing have already affected southeastern China. At the same time, enormous interregional coal transfers face a lack of transport capacity along the transport system. Based on first-hand statistics, a disaggregated analysis of coal distribution patterns since the late 1970 s provides novel evidences about the local effects of macroscopic trends, such as the shift from dominant exports to dominant imports in terms of changing traffic concentration levels and distribution patterns among routes and ports. The spatial evolution of coal distribution is also discussed in terms of related industry linkages and local influences, coal trade policies and market pricing, port system evolution, and transport network planning.

40|$|The {{energy sector}} {{accounts}} for the lion’s share (55 %) of greenhouse gas emissions in the European Union (EU). While EU emissions had fallen by 22. 1 % in 2015 compared with 1990, and continue to fall, the bloc’s economy grew by 27 % over that period. Since the Renewable Energy Directive (RED) entered into force, use of renewables has continued {{to grow in the}} 3 EU sectors that consume most energy (electricity, heating/ cooling and transport). This has done much to cut emissions. While the renewable share in gross final energy consumption rose from 12. 4 % in 2009 to almost 17 % in 2015, EU emissions fell year-on-year by an annual average of 8. 5 %. Fossil fuels are increasingly being displaced by renewables. The displacement between 1990 and 2015 amounted to 139 Mtoe equal to 11. 5 % of the gross <b>inland</b> <b>consumption</b> of fossil fuels. The electricity sector accounted for almost 40 % of this displacement, with rapidly growing new technologies such as wind and photovoltaics accounting for almost 18 % of total fossil fuel displacement. Without renewable energy sources, total emissions in the EU would have been 8. 7 % higher in 2009, 13. 8 % higher in 2014 and 14. 4 % higher in 2015.

40|$|The {{main object}} of the {{analysis}} presented in the text was to point to and confirm the existence of special “energy cultures” in the European Union. In order to achieve this aim the use was made of research present in the literature, inter alia, in the publications containing statistical analyses by: (1) A. Pach-Gurgul, (2) P. Tapio and his research team – Banister, J. Luukkanen, J. Vehma i R. Willamo, also in a review, (3) Z. Łucki and W. Misiak. Compared with the invoked research, the timeframe of the analysis in the text covered 2011, and the subjective scope embraced 28 countries (EU- 28). As part of the research process the following research hypotheses were subjected to verification: (1) It must be assumed that the dissimilarities in energy structures of particular EU member states are an outstanding premise {{on which to base}} a recognition of the existence of specific “energy cultures” in the European Union, (2) It must be assumed that in the period of 2001 - 2011 there occurred changes in the area of “energy cultures” of the European Union, which had earlier been recognised in the literature. In this scope the following conclusions ought to be presented: I. CONCLUSIONS: The differences in energy structures result in the possibility of pointing to particular features characterising member states and clusters of countries, partially because of the predominance of specific energy carriers and/or a way of their conversion. On account of the use of selected indexes for the purpose of characterising the specificity of the European Union member states, six clusters have been distinguished, and they include the following countries: (1) Spain, France, Italy and Great Britain; (2) Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia and Poland; (3) Denmark, Ireland, Greece, Cyprus, Malta, Austria, Slovenia, Finland and Sweden; (4) Croatia, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Portugal, Romania and Slovakia; (5) Germany; (6) Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. An observable cluster that recurs in the research by A. Pach-Gurgul {{as well as in the}} analysis presented in the text covering 2011, embraces Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia and Poland (Cluster II). As for Ward’s method the cluster is broader, but features an outstanding group of the above-mentioned countries (also including: Croatia, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Slovakia and Romania). Besides, in this model, in comparison with A. Pach-Gurgul’s research, another cluster is by and large repeated, including Croatia, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Portugal, Romania and Slovakia – Cluster IV (for a variety of reasons Croatia and Portugal are not repeated). The characteristic feature of both clusters is a higher scale of the index of energy intensity (kgoe/€ 1000). This shows that it is legitimate to recognise the existence of the division of the European Union into the two “energy cultures”: the Western European one and Eastern European one. The main factor behind this division is the energy intensity of the economies of individual member states. Unlike the analysis by P. Tapio and his research team, the axis of division has changed considerably, for within the so-called “old” European Union (EU- 15) there was an observable general division into the Northern European and Southern European “energy cultures. ” Both the above-mentioned clusters (II and IV) can be associated with the “Eastern European culture” as part of the division presented by Z. Łucki and W. Misiak. The energy culture distinguished by the two researchers is to be characterised by: (1) a variety of energy policies, (2) a high energy intensity of the economy, (3) a low electric energy consumption, (4) limited awareness, (5) a negative attitude towards energy market liberalisation. In the case of Bulgaria, the Czech Republic and Poland (Cluster II), the characteristic feature is a considerable share of solid fuels in the energy mix of the gross <b>inland</b> energy <b>consumption.</b> The countries included in Cluster IV are characterised by a smaller share of solid fuels and a higher diversity of energy structure. As part of the k-means clustering method, it is worth pointing out two clusters of countries: Cluster I (Spain, France, Italy, Great Britain) and Cluster V (Germany). The countries in both clusters belong to the so-called “old” European Union, and their main feature is a substantial level of energy production, Germany being the largest producer. In both cases, the characteristic features are a marked share of renewable energy sources, gas as well as petroleum and petroleum products in the gross <b>inland</b> energy <b>consumption.</b> Furthermore, both clusters are characterised by a low or relatively low index of energy intensity (kgoe/€ 1000). As part of the clustering based on the k-means method, in both periods, that is in 2001 and 2011 the cluster comprising Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands was repeated. This cluster is characterised by a high index of energy consumption per capita and a high index of GHG emission per capita. II. CONCLUSIONS: It must be emphasised that the period 2001 - 2010 is connected with the transition process of the electric energy and gas sectors in the European Union. The process is also associated with the introduction of the 1 st Climate-Energy Package in the European Union. What is more, the changes will be continued on account of the efforts at building an Energy Union as well as the implementation of the so-called 2 nd Climate-Energy Package. Of particular significance is also the increase in the import dependence of the European Union, given the declining reserves of energy resources. Moreover, the objectives of the “green energy policy” will be giving rise to the increasing energy efficiency and the growing share of renewable energy sources in energy production, which may constitute a factor limiting the import dependence. Thus, it should be posited that in the long term we will be witnessing a homogenisation of indexes, e. g. the index of energy intensity. These processes may result in the tendency for changes towards the model of the “energy culture,” which Z. Łucki and W. Misiak have termed a “Scandinavian culture,” that is one characterised by the following features: (1) a development of RES, (2) a low consumption of coal, (3) a low index of GHG emission, (4) a considerable energy consumption, (5) a low energy intensity, (6) a heightened environment- and energy-consciousness. By way of comparing the analyses for 2011 and for 2001, based on the k-means clustering method, it must be stressed that Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands hold steady in the cluster (Cluster VI), whereby they abide by the roles played by the features earlier ascribed to them. A measure of stability can also be observed in the case of Spain, France, Italy, Great Britain and Germany (Clusters I and V). Noteworthily, Sweden has been eliminated from the group (despite lowering the scale of the first three indexes). The distinctive feature of Eastern European countries is the high scale of the energy intensity index, as viewed against the backdrop of Clusters I and IV. Yet, some tendency towards stirring of the scale of energy intensity index is to be observed in this scope. A transformation of the energy structure will also prove quite a challenge here. Poland can serve as an example, whereby coal will continue to be the country’s main electric energy carrier for the next 30 years. The comparative analysis featuring in the text is limited, and so it does not address all the issues concerned with the correlations between the presented “energy cultures. ” The work sets out to verify the results of the research into the existence of “energy cultures” in the European Union, as presented by A. Pach-Gurgul, Z. Łucki and W. Misiak as well as P. Tapio and his research team. Still, the greatest emphasis has been laid on the proposals made by A. Pach-Gurgul, for it was her publication as well as the selection of indexes and research tools included therein that proved to be an inspiration for the present text. It should also be noted that the object of analysis in the text does not embrace a discussion of the legitimacy of employing specific methods for clustering. The main objective of the text is to present an analysis that points to the existence of special “energy cultures” in the European Union. The comparative analysis encompassing the results of previous research into “energy cultures” employs statistical methods, i. e. a cluster analysis (Ward’s clustering method and k-means clustering method). The main sections of the text address: (1) the concept and examples of “energy cultures,” (2) a methodology of analysis, (3) a selection of indexes characterising “energy cultures,” (4) an attempt at grouping the European Union member states with the aid of clustering, (5) conclusions. With a view to making the research problem more specific, the present text features the following questions: (1) Is the claim that the European Union manifests special “energy cultures” legitimate?, (2) Did the decade of 2001 - 2011 witness changes in the field of the European Union “energy cultures,” as earlier recognised by the literature...|$|R

Considering the pre- and protohistoric period, hardly any data are available; the scarce evidence from a number of small faunal assemblages suggests that, during these periods, trade in marine products towards inland sites did not occur. Unfortunately, Flemish pre- and protohistoric producer sites are unknown; they disappeared into sea due to the Holocene sea level rise. Considering the Roman period, for the same reason, the producer sites of marine products remain equally unknown. Inland consumer sites from that period, however, do show a (limited) consumption of large marine fish, be it species not derived from the North Sea. Spanish mackerel was imported in a salted form, as salsamenta, from more southern parts of the empire. Smaller fish from southern waters was also consumed in northern Gaul, as ingredient of garum, the well-known Roman fish sauce. At some point during the Roman occupation, even a local production of garum was set up, using small fish from the North Sea. Large marine fish from northern waters was not traded inland, in contrast to marine molluscs of which we do find the remains in Gallo-Roman inland sites. During the middle ages, the <b>inland</b> <b>consumption</b> of marine molluscs persisted and {{towards the end of the}} first millennium AD marine fish also appeared on the inland markets. Most probably, the development and growth of urban centres provided the stimulus for the coastal area to start organising surplus catches, larger than needed for their own subsistence economy. High medieval consumption refuse from Gent shows that, first, flatfish formed the majority of traded products, but that later large gadids became also important commodities. After 1000 AD, herring became popular on the urban markets, most probably due to the growing use of floating nets. When, during the late middle ages, the practice of gutting herring on board of the ships became widespread, the economic importance of the species even increased. The shift in marine fish most frequently consumed reflects the transition of fishing in coastal waters (for flatfish) towards fishing in open sea (large gadids). Moreover, late medieval assemblages of marine fish show that Flemish fishermen gradually explored more northern waters, above the Dogger bank and off the North-English and Scottish coasts. This evolution, however, was abruptly ended by the political and economic troubles of the late 15 th and 16 th century, which meant the end of the heydays of Flemish marine fishery...|$|E
