40|$|The {{evolution}} and long-time stability {{of a double}} layer (DL) in a discrete auroral arc requires that the parallel current in the arc, which may be considered uniform at the source, be diverted within the arc to charge the flanks of the U-shaped double layer potential structure. A simple model is presented in which this current redistribution is effected by anomalous transport based on electrostatic lower hybrid waves driven by the <b>flank</b> <b>structure</b> itself. This process provides the limiting constraint on the double layer potential. The flank charging may be represented {{as that of a}} nonlinear transmission line. A simplified model circuit, in which the transmission line is represented by a nonlinear impedance in parallel with a variable resistor, is incorporated in a one-dimensional simulation model to give the current density at the DL boundaries. Results are presented for the scaling of the DL potential {{as a function of the}} width of the arc and the saturation efficiency of the lower hybrid instability mechanism...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWithin a low-grade ductile shear zone, we {{investigated}} exceptionally well exposed brittle faults, which accumulated antithetic slip and rotated into the shearing direction. The foliation planes of the mylonitic host rock intersect the faults approximately at their centre and exhibit ductile reverse drag. Three types of brittle faults can be distinguished: (i) Faults developing on pre-existing K-feldspar/mica veins that are oblique to the shear direction. These faults have triclinic <b>flanking</b> <b>structures.</b> (ii) Wing cracks opening as mode I fractures at {{the tips of}} the triclinic <b>flanking</b> <b>structures,</b> perpendicular to the shear direction. These cracks are reactivated as faults with antithetic shear, extend from the parent K-feldspar/mica veins and form a complex linked <b>flanking</b> <b>structure</b> system. (iii) Joints forming perpendicular to the shearing direction are deformed to form monoclinic <b>flanking</b> <b>structures.</b> Triclinic and monoclinic <b>flanking</b> <b>structures</b> record elliptical displacement–distance profiles with steep displacement gradients at the fault tips by ductile flow in the host rocks, resulting in reverse drag of the foliation planes. These structures record one of the greatest maximum displacement/length ratios reported from natural fault structures.

40|$|AbstractWe use the Eshelby {{solution}} modified for a {{viscous fluid}} {{to model the}} evolution of three-dimensional <b>flanking</b> <b>structures</b> in monoclinic shear zones. Shearing of an elliptical crack strongly elongated perpendicular to the flow direction produces a cylindrical <b>flanking</b> <b>structure</b> which is reproducible with 2 D plane strain models. In contrast, a circular or even narrow, slit-shaped crack exhibits a reduced magnitude of the velocity jump across the crack and results in smaller offset and a narrower zone of deflection than predicted with 2 D-models. Even more significant deviations are observed if the crack axes are oriented at an oblique angle to the principal flow directions, where the velocity jump is oblique to the resolved shear direction and is modified during progressive deformation. The resulting triclinic geometry represents a rare example of triclinic structures developing in monoclinic flow and {{may be used to}} estimate the flow kinematics of the shear zone...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The aim of {{this study}} is to present analog models of <b>flanking</b> <b>structures</b> and to analyze the Fábrica Nova synform, Quadrilátero Ferrífero, Minas Gerais, from a {{geometric}} point of view. We set up seven models using a linear viscous silicone and produced <b>flanking</b> <b>structures</b> with a shear velocity of 2 cm h- 1. At different initial orientations with respect to the shear zone boundary, a rigid cross-cutting element with lubricated boundaries was deformed via sinistral bulk flow at a shear strain of γ = 1. 28. The most interesting features of our experiments are the geometries of the different marker lines, which are heterogeneous and resulted from thickening and thinning of the silicone at the cross-cutting element terminations. To compare our analog models and the Fábrica Nova synform, we analyzed the outermost marker line of the analog models and the top surface of the Cauê Formation in the Paleoproterozoic metasediments. The best comparisons between the experiments and the natural example were obtained by our CIS 90 model in terms of the flexure shape near the cross-cutting element and the cross-cutting element orientation. Thus, we suggest that the cross-cutting elements in both situations act as obstacles and consequently produce local perturbations in laminar flow...|$|R

Between the two faults, marker layers are “exhumed ” with respect to the position of the corresponding layers in the far field.

40|$|A <b>flanking</b> <b>structure</b> {{developed}} along {{a secondary}} shear zone in calcite marbles, on Syros (Cyclades, Greece), provides a natural laboratory for directly studying {{the effects of}} strain rate variations on calcite deformation at identical pressure and temperature conditions. The presence and rotation of a fracture during progressive deformation caused extreme variations in finite strain and strain rate, forming a localized ductile shear zone that shows different microstructures and textures. Textures {{and the degree of}} intracrystalline deformation were measured by electron backscattered diffraction. Marbles from the host rocks and the shear zone, which deformed at various strain rates, display crystal-preferred orientation, suggesting that the calcite preferentially deformed by intracrystalline-plastic deformation. Increasing strain rate results in a switch from subgrain rotation to bulging recrystallization in the dislocation-creep regime. With increasing strain rate, we observe in fine-grained (3 μm) ultramylonitic zones a change in deformation regime from grain-size insensitive to grain-size sensitive. Paleowattmeter and the paleopiezometer suggest strain rates for the localized shear zone around 10 exp− 10 s exp− 1 and for the marble host rock around 10 exp− 12 s exp− 1. We conclude that varying natural strain rates can have a first-order effect on the microstructures and textures that developed under the same metamorphic conditions...|$|R
40|$|The Earth’s {{crust is}} {{generally}} considered to consist of distinct brittle and viscous (or “ductile”) rheological layers, corresponding to Navier-Coulomb failure or viscous flow, with a “brittle-ductile transition” occurring over a specific and relatively limited depth interval. Depending on the assumed geothermal gradient, a compositionally layered crust could have several such brittle-ductile transitions, but the model still implies that large regions of the crust deform exclusively by either brittle fracture or viscous crystal-plastic flow. However, {{it is becoming increasingly}} clear from field observation that, in reality, there is an intimate interplay in space and time between precursor heterogeneities (either structural or compositional), brittle fracture, fluid-rock interaction and more distributed “ductile flow”. In particular, there are now several well-documented examples of brittle precursors localizing subsequent ductile deformation under high grade metamorphic conditions ranging from upper amphibolite (Mancktelow and Pennacchioni 2005, 2007) to even eclogite facies (Austrheim and Boundy 1994). This interplay between fracture and crystal-plastic creep and/or diffusion occurs over a wide range of scales, from 100 ’s of kilometres down to individual grains. Localization of strain in the crust can lead to the development of zones of very large relative displacement (such as low-angle thrusts and detachments, and steep strike-slip faults). The mechanics of this localization on a narrow zone and its repeated reactivation can only be considered in terms of a cyclical interaction between fracture, flow, and variation in local pore-fluid pressure. These relatively planar and discrete faults and shear zones are commonly observed to cross-cut layering and foliation at a small angle. Small-scale examples from the field, as well as numerical models, show that viscous localization is strongly controlled by existing compositional and rheological heterogeneity (such as bedding, dykes, veins etc), whereas fractures may crosscut such compositional layering at small angles. This suggests that major crosscutting faults, which may now be dominated by mylonitic fabrics characteristic of crystal-plastic flow (e. g., the Periadriatic Fault in the European Alps), could also have had a large-scale, brittle precursor that controlled subsequent ductile localization. On a smaller scale, <b>flanking</b> <b>structures</b> (Passchier 2001; Grasemann and Stüwe 2001) developed around brittle fractures of limited length are particularly clear examples of interacting brittle-ductile deformation, because their geometry can only be explained if discrete slip occurred synchronously with more distributed surrounding ductile flow (Exner et al. 2004). <b>Flanking</b> <b>structures</b> that formed in calcite marbles under amphibolite facies conditions (e. g., on the island of Naxos, Greece) demonstrate that brittle fracturing can play an important role even in weak rocks at high temperatures – conditions generally taken to imply exclusively ductile or viscous behaviour. Such <b>flanking</b> <b>structures</b> are common in mylonitic shear zones (e. g., in mylonites in the footwall of the major Simplon low-angle normal fault in the central Alps) and demonstrate the delicate balance between fracture and flow in such high strain zones, with switches back and forth varying locally in space and through time. This behaviour is not totally unexpected. The reduction of bulk porosity and permeability in rocks with depth raises the local pore fluid pressure from hydrostatic to near lithostatic (as usually assumed in metamorphic petrology), with the result that rocks are generally critically stressed and close to failure. Only minor local changes in the controlling parameters (strain rate, pore fluid pressure, dynamic or “tectonic” pressure) can cause a switch between fracture and flow. In natural examples, the interplay between fracture and flow is observed in middle to lower crustal rocks irrespective of whether they are weak (“wet”) or strong (“dry”). Excellent examples of interacting fracture and flow from glacier-polished outcrops of granodiorite in the Neves area of the eastern Alps developed under wet conditions, with very common quartz vein development and marked fluid-rock interaction along fractures. The deviatoric stress during both flow and fracture was low (< 10 MPa), as demonstrated by little deformed calcite porphyroclasts in quartz mylonites, which did not even significantly twin during crystal plastic flow of the matrix quartz under upper amphibolite facies conditions (Mancktelow and Pennacchioni 2010). In contrast, in dry lower crust, such as from the Mont Mary area of the western Alps, stresses were high (as indicated by very small recrystallized quartz grain sizes; Fitz Gerald et al. 2006) and seismic fracture was associated with pseudotachlyte development. Pseudotachylytes subsequently act as rheologically weak layers that strongly localize ductile shearing under dry upper amphibolite facies conditions (Pennacchioni and Cesare 1997).

When crowded objects are presented experimentally, a key finding is that observers frequently report nearby flanking items instead of the target. This observation {{has led to the}} proposal that crowding reflects increased noise in the positional code for objects; although how the presence of nearby objects might disrupt positional encoding remains unclear. We quantified this disruption using cross-like stimuli, where observers judged whether the horizontal target line was positioned above or below the stimulus midpoint. Overall, observers were poorer at judging position in the presence of crowding flankers. However, offsetting horizontal lines in the flankers also led observers to report that the horizontal line in the target was shifted in the same direction, an effect that held for subthreshold flanker offsets. In short, crowding induced both random and systematic errors in observers' judgment of position, with or without the detection of <b>flanker</b> <b>structure.</b> Computational modeling reveals that perceived position in the presence of flankers follows a weighted average of noisy target- and flanker-line positions, rather than a substitution of flanker-features into the target, as has been proposed previously.
