40|$|Abstract The present paper {{deals with}} the {{characterization}} of wastewater generated from Greek wineries and wine distilleries. The quantity {{and the quality of}} the wastewater of a distillery depends on the type of wine (white or red), on the processes followed for the production of wine as well as on the volume of the tanks that are used. The total production of wastewater from a winery is about 1. 2 times greater than the production of wine with BOD 5 1740 mg/l and 1970 mg/l for white and red wine respectively, while the corresponding prices for COD are 3112 mg/l and 3997 mg/l and for the total phenolic compounds 280 and 1440 mg/l respectively. From these results, it is expected that the biological treatment of wastewater from white wines will be more efficient than that from red wines.

40|$|An LC-MS/MS {{method for}} the trace-level {{determination}} of 3 -alkyl- 2 -methoxypyrazines in Sauvignon blanc wines is described. 3 -lsobutyl- 2 -methoxypyrazine (IBMP), 3 -isopropyl- 2 -methoxypyrazine (IPMP) and 3 -seobutyl- 2 -methoxypyrazine (SBMP) {{were analyzed by}} reversed phase liquid chromatography coupled to atmospheric pressure chemical ionization, as electrospray ionization was found to suffer from matrix quenching effects. A sample preparation method involving <b>distillation</b> of <b>wine</b> followed by solvent extraction and sufficient preconcentration was developed. Limits of detection and quantification for all three analytes were 0. 03 ng/L and 0. 10 ng/L, respectively, making the method more sensitive than gas chromatographic methods. IBMP {{was found to be}} the most abundant congener in South African Sauvignon blanc wines, with concentrations varying between 0. 40 and 44 ng/L in 575 samples. IPMP and SBMP levels varied from < 0. 03 to 3. 9 and < 0. 03 to 3. 2 ng/L, respectively. Statistical investigation indicated no clear correlation between methoxypyrazine content and either geographical origin or vintage. The method was also successfully applied for the quantitation of IBMP in five additional South African wine varieties, including three red wine cultivars.

50|$|The {{religious}} {{order of the}} Jesuates, formally the Clerici apostolici Sancti Hieronymi was founded in Siena in the 14th century and had a presence in Venice by 1390. Its members were known as I poveri Gesuati (the poor Jesuates) because they frequently called on the name of Jesus; they had no connection with the Jesuits (I Gesuiti), whose church is {{in the north of}} Venice. They acquired some wealth from donations and legacies and from privileges granted by the state, including a monopoly on the <b>distillation</b> of <b>wine.</b> In 1493, they commenced the building of a small church on land fronting the Zattere (the fondamenta which borders the Giudecca Canal facing the Giudecca island), where the other buildings of the order stood. This church was originally dedicated to St. Jerome (San Girolamo) and later to Santa Maria della Visitazione (St. Mary of the Visitation) and became known as the church of the Visitation. Later, the order found it hard to recruit new members and a falling off in numbers combined with slackness in the performance of their duties led to its suppression by Pope Clement IX in 1668. In 1669 their property was put up for auction and acquired by the Dominicans, who installed themselves there in 1670. It became known as the Dominicans' place at the Gesuati and the Venetians have to this day continued to use the name.|$|R

2500|$|Grape {{varieties}} in South Africa {{are known}} as cultivar, with many common international varieties developing local synonyms that still have a strong tradition of use. These include: Chenin blanc (Steen), Riesling (until recently known locally as Weisser Riesling), Crouchen (known as Cape Riesling), Palomino (the grape of the Spanish wine Sherry known locally as [...] "White French"), Trebbiano (Ugni Blanc), Sémillon (Groendruif) and Muscat of Alexandria (Hanepoot). However, wines that are often exported overseas will usually have the more internationally recognised name appear on the wine label. In 2015, SAWIS (South African Wine Information and Systems) reported that the country had 100,146 hectares of vineyards, with about 55% planted with white varieties. Chenin blanc {{has long been the}} most widely planted variety, still accounting for over 18% of all grape area planted in South Africa as of 2015, though it is slowly decreasing in overall share of vineyard area. In the 1980s and 1990s, interest in international varieties saw increase in plantings of Chardonnay and Sauvignon blanc. Other white grape varieties with significant plantings include Colombard (also spelled locally as Colombar), Cape Riesling, Gewürztraminer, Hanepoot, Muscat Blanc à Petits Grains, Riesling and Sémillon. Both red and white mutants of Muscat Blanc à Petits Grains as well as Chenel and Weldra, two Chenin blanc-Ugni blanc crossings, are used for brandy <b>distillation</b> and fortified <b>wine</b> production.|$|R
40|$|The <b>wine</b> <b>distillation</b> {{process is}} used to produce the spirits {{required}} for production of Port Wine. From this process results a by-product rich in phenolic compounds which may be incorporated into novel food products with functional properties. The objective of this work {{was to develop a}} new food product, attractive from the organoleptic point of view and with the advantage of being rich in phenolic compounds with antioxidant activity. For that, the red wine was dealcoholized and concentrated allowing to obtain a phenolic-rich solution with antioxidant activity. This solution was added (5 or 10 mL) into yogurts as functional ingredient. The developed yogurts contained different aroma variations (mixed fruit or cinnamon) and different levels of sugar (no sugar or 20 g/L added). The acidity and antioxidant activity of the yogurts were measured, and also a sensorial evaluation was performed. The addition of the phenolic-rich solution caused an increase in the content of antioxidants, which was proportional to the amount of added by-product solution. Furthermore, the yogurts with cinnamon presented higher antioxidant activity than the corresponding versions with fruits. Also, the adition of the by-product solution did not cause and observable effect on acidity, an important organoleptic factor for consumer acceptance. The results of sensory evaluation revealed that the fortified yogurts were preferred when compared with the control ones. In addition, it was possible to conclude that the yogurt with mixed fruits, sugar, and phenolic-rich solution was preferred by the panellists, getting the highest score. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

After PCR amplification, four small-subunit (SSU) rDNA clone libraries of Bacteria, Archaea, Procarya, and Eucarya populations were established. The community structure was determined by operational taxonomic unit (OTU) phylogenetic analyses of 579 partial rDNA sequences (about 500 bp long). A total of 146 OTUs were found, comprising 133, 6, and 7 from the Bacteria, Archaea, and Eucarya domains, respectively. A total of 117 bacterial OTU were affiliated with major phyla: low-G+C gram-positive bacteria, Cytophaga-Flexibacter-Bacteroides, Proteobacteria, high-G+C gram-positive bacteria, and Spirochaetes, where the clone distribution was 34, 26, 17, 6, and 4 %, respectively. The other 16 bacterial OTUs represent 13 % of the clones. They were either affiliated with narrow phyla such as Planctomyces-Chlamydia, green nonsulfur bacteria, or Synergistes, or deeply branched on the phylogenetic tree. A large number of bacterial OTUs are not closely related to any other hitherto determined sequences. The most frequent bacterial OTUs represents less than 5 % of the total bacterial SSU rDNA sequences. However, the 20 more frequent bacterial OTUs describe at least 50 % of these sequences.

40|$|The {{distillates}} {{obtained from}} wine, both raw and aged, are highly appreciated alcoholic beverages {{due to the}} refinement and fineness that characterizes them. Romania’s viticultural conditions are very favourable for these products - which in the last centuries have made regions such as Cognac and Armagnac in France famous. In Romania the aged distillate of wine is called “vinars” and in the Republic of Moldova it is named “divin”. This study analyses how the main compositional parameters and volatile compounds {{are influenced by the}} raw material <b>wine,</b> <b>distillation</b> technology, distillation steps, removal of the lower-quality fractions (heads and tails). The raw material used to make the distillates was a mixture of two wines of Fetească albă and Fetească regală, harvest of 2015, from Iasi vineyard. The proposed experimental protocol consisted of the double distillation of a volume of 1000 L of raw material. For the distillation, a simple copper distillery with a deflector was used. From each 10 L of distillate obtained, samples were taken and analysed via gas-chromatography. In the first and second distillation, the largest amounts of acetic acid are found in the head. The highest concentrations of octanoic acid are recorded in tails, as does hexanoic acid. The product obtained after the first distillation recorded an average alcoholic strength of 33. 5 % vol, which increased after the second distillation, so that the final distillate has an alcoholic strength of 58. 5 % vol. Concerning the acid profile, the following can be concluded: Acetic acid can be considerably diminished with the removal of the head fractions; Octanoic, hexanoic and decanoic acids fall into the class of short chain fatty acids, can affect the organoleptic qualities but are easily esterify the resulting compounds giving pleasing odour; aging in oak or mulberry wood barrels of crude distillates to achieve the maximum potential is recommended...|$|R
