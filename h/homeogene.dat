40|$|Using two primers {{corresponding}} to helix 1 and helix 3 {{regions in the}} homeodomain, we subjected genomic DNA from Caenorhabditis elegans to amplification by the polymerase chain reaction. Sequence analysis of the amplified products revealed a new homeobox-containing gene, designated ceh- 19.

40|$|AbstractRat genomic DNA was {{isolated}} by homology with Cdxl, a murine <b>homeogene</b> selectively expressed in intestinal cells of endodermal origin. Southern blot {{analysis indicated that}} the rat genome contains a single or {{a small number of}} closely related Cdx gene(s). A major 1. 7 kb Cdx mRNA was detected in neonate, suckling and adult rats whereas a 6. 5 kb mRNA was restricted to sucklings and adults. Both transcripts showed decreasing concentration from the colon towards the proximal part of the small intestine. No obvious correlation could be established with the patterns of expression of transcripts corresponding to markers of cell proliferation and cell differentiation during postnatal development...|$|E
40|$|The {{specification}} of area identities in the cerebral cortex {{is a complex}} process, primed by intrinsic cortical cues and refined after the arrival of afferent fibers from the thalamus. Little {{is known about the}} genetic control of the early steps of this process, but the distinctive expression pattern of the <b>homeogene</b> Emx 2 in the developing cortex has prompted suggestions that it is critical in this context. We tested this hypothesis using Emx 2 –/– mice. We found that the normal spectrum of cortical areal identities was encoded in these mutants, but areas with caudal–medial identities were reduced and those with anterior–lateral identities were relatively expanded in the cortex...|$|E
40|$|International audienceHigher fungi, which {{comprise}} ascomycetes and basidiomycetes, play {{major roles}} in the biosphere. Their evolutionary success {{may be due to}} the extended dikaryotic stage of their life cycle, which is the basis for their scientific name: the Dikarya. Dikaryosis is maintained by similar structures, the clamp in basidiomycetes and the crozier in ascomycetes. Homeodomain transcription factors are required for clamp formation in all basidiomycetes studied. We identified all the homeobox genes in the filamentous ascomycete fungus Podospora anserina and constructed deletion mutants for each of these genes and for a number of gene combinations. Croziers developed normally in these mutants, including those with up to six deleted <b>homeogenes.</b> However, some mutants had defects in maturation of the fruiting body, an effect that could be rescued by providing wild-type maternal hyphae. Analysis of mutants deficient in multiple <b>homeogenes</b> revealed interactions between the genes, suggesting that they operate as a complex network. Similar to their role in animals and plants, homeodomain transcription factors in ascomycetes are involved in shaping multicellular structures...|$|R
40|$|The {{mammalian}} Crx {{genes are}} highly divergent orthodenticle (otd) -related <b>homeogenes</b> that play {{important roles in}} the differentiation of retinal photoreceptors and the circadian entrainment. However, their evolutionary origin and orthological relationships with other otd-related genes remain unclear. An orthology relationship of these genes with the highly conserved Otx 5 genes identified in fish and amphibians, and also expressed {{in the eye and}} epiphysis, has been proposed previously but remains controversial. To test this hypothesis, we have identified Crx genes {{in a wide range of}} mammals, including three marsupials, and Otx 5 -related genes in a lizard, a turtle, and two archosaurs (crocodile and chick), as well as in the pufferfish. Phylogenetic analyses of the coding sequences show that the mammalian Crx genes are orthologous to the Otx 5 -related genes isolated in other gnathostomes. They also indicate that a duplication event has taken place in actinopterygians, after the splitting of the Cladistia, and that a relaxation of the structural constraints acting on the gene coding region has occurred early in the mammalian lineage. This process may be linked not only to the loss of ancestral Otx 5 /Crx functions during gastrulation or in the retinal pigmented epithelium, but also to the evolution of photic entrainment mechanisms in mammals...|$|R
40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVES: Autism (MIM# 209850) and {{schizophrenia}} (MIM# 181500) {{are both}} neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorders {{characterized by a}} highly genetic component. <b>Homeogenes</b> and forkhead genes encode transcription factors, which {{have been involved in}} brain development and cell differentiation. Thus, they are relevant candidate genes for psychiatric disorders. Genetic studies have reported an association between autism and DLX 2, HOXA 1, EN 2, ARX, and FOXP 2 genes whereas only three studies of EN 2, OTX 2, and FOXP 2 were performed on schizophrenia. Interestingly, most of these candidate genes contain trinucleotide repeats coding for polyamino acid stretch in which instability can be the cause of neurodevelopmental disorders. Our goal was to identify variations of coding trinucleotide repeats in schizophrenia, autism, and idiopathic mental retardation. METHODS: We screened the coding trinucleotide repeats of OTX 1, EN 1, DLX 2, HOXA 1, and FOXP 2 genes in populations suffering from schizophrenia (247 patients), autism (98 patients), and idiopathic mental retardation (56 patients), and compared them with control populations (112 super controls and 202 healthy controls). RESULTS: Novel deletions and insertions of coding trinucleotide repeats were found in the DLX 2, HOXA 1, and FOXP 2 genes. Most of these variations were detected in controls and no difference in their distribution was observed between patient and control groups. Two different polymorphisms in FOXP 2 were, however, found only in autistic patients and the functional consequences of these variations of repeats have to be characterized and correlated to particular clinical features. CONCLUSION: This study did not identify specific disease risk variants of trinucleotide repeats in OTX 1, EN 1, DLX 2, HOXA 1, and FOXP 2 candidate genes in neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorders...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Prox 1, the {{vertebrate}} homolog of prospero in Drosophila melanogaster, is a divergent <b>homeogene</b> {{that regulates}} cell proliferation, fate determination and differentiation during vertebrate embryonic development. Results Here we report that, in zebrafish, prox 1 is widely expressed in several districts of the Central Nervous System (CNS). Specifically, we evidenced prox 1 expression {{in a group}} of neurons, already positive for otp 1, located in the hypothalamus {{at the level of the}} posterior tuberculum (PT). Prox 1 knock-down determines the severe loss of hypothalamic catecholaminergic (CA) neurons, identified by tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression, and the synergistic prox 1 /otp 1 overexpression induces the appearance of hypothalamic supernumerary TH-positive neurons and ectopic TH-positive cells on the yolk epitelium. Conclusion Our findings indicate that prox 1 activity is crucial for the proper development of the otp 1 -positive hypothalamic neuronal precursors to their terminal CA phenotype. </p...|$|E
40|$|The distalless-related <b>homeogene</b> Dlx 5 is {{expressed}} in the olfactory placodes and derived tissues and in the anterior-basal forebrain. We investigated the role of Dlx 5 in olfactory development. In Dlx 5 (-/-) mice, the olfactory bulbs (OBs) lack glomeruli, exhibit disorganized cellular layers, and show reduced numbers of TH- and GAD 67 -positive neurons. The olfactory epithelium in Dlx 5 (-/-) mice is composed of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) that appear identical to wild-type ORNs, but their axons fail to contact the OBs. We transplanted Dlx 5 (-/-) OBs into a wild-type newborn mouse; wild-type ORN axons enter the mutant OB and form glomeruli, but cannot rescue the lamination defect or the expression of TH and GAD 67. Thus, the absence of Dlx 5 in the OB does not per se prevent ORN axon ingrowth. In conclusion, Dlx 5 plays major roles in the connectivity of ORN axons and in the differentiation of OB interneurons...|$|E
40|$|International audienceInherited retinal degenerations are {{blinding}} diseases {{characterized by}} the loss of photoreceptors. Their extreme genetic heterogeneity complicates treatment by gene therapy. This has motivated broader strategies for transplantation of healthy retinal pigmented epithelium to protect photoreceptors independently of the gene causing the disease. The limited clinical benefit for visual function reported up to now is mainly due to dedifferentiation of the transplanted cells that undergo an epithelial-mesenchymal transition. We have studied this mechanism in vitro and revealed the role of the <b>homeogene</b> OTX 2 in preventing dedifferentiation through the regulation of target genes. We have overexpressed OTX 2 in retinal pigmented epithelial cells before their transplantation in the eye of a model of retinitis pigmentosa carrying a mutation in Mertk, a gene specifically expressed by retinal pigmented epithelial cells. OTX 2 increases significantly the protection of photoreceptors as seen by histological and functional analyses. We observed that the beneficial effect of OTX 2 is non-cell autonomous, and it is at least partly mediated by unidentified trophic factors. Transplantation of OTX 2 -genetically modified cells may by medically effective for other retinal diseases involving the retinal pigmented epithelium in age-related macular degeneration...|$|E
40|$|Urogenital {{birth defects}} {{are one of}} the common phenotypes {{observed}} in hereditary human disorders. In particular, limb malformations are often associated with urogenital developmental abnormalities, as the case for Hand-foot-genital syndrome displaying similar hypoplasia/agenesis of limbs and external genitalia. Split-hand/split-foot malformation (SHFM) is a syndromic limb disorder affecting the central rays of the autopod with median clefts of the hands and feet, missing central fingers and often fusion of the remaining ones. SHFM type 1 (SHFM 1) is linked to genomic deletions or rearrangements, which includes the distal-less-related <b>homeogenes</b> DLX 5 and DLX 6 as well as DSS 1. SHFM type 4 (SHFM 4) is associated with mutations in p 63, which encodes a p 53 -related transcription factor. To understand that SHFM is associated with urogenital birth defects, we performed gene expression analysis and gene knockout mouse model analyses. We show here that Dlx 5, Dlx 6, p 63 and Bmp 7, one of the p 63 downstream candidate genes, are all expressed in the developing urethral plate (UP) and that targeted inactivation of these genes in the mouse results in UP defects leading to abnormal urethra formation. These results suggested that different set of transcription factors and growth factor genes play similar developmental functions during embryonic urethra formation. Human SHFM syndromes display multiple phenotypes with variations in addition to split hand foot limb phenotype. These results suggest that different genes associated with human SHFM could also be involved in the aetiogenesis of hypospadias pointing toward a common molecular origin of these congenital malformations.

40|$|We {{studied the}} structure, {{regulation}} and expression of HOX 3 D, a human homeobox gene {{located in the}} HOX 3 cluster on chromosome 12. HOX 3 D is developmentally regulated during embryogenesis and is activated by retinoic acid (RA) in cultured embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells. Transfection of HOX 3 D upstream genomic sequences linked to a reporter gene allowed the functional definition of its promoter, containing a canonical TATA element. This promoter directs {{the expression of the}} reporter gene in EC cells after induction with RA, and binds RA-induced nuclear factor(s) through a conserved palindromic sequence located approximately 100 bp upstream of the transcription start site. The HOX 3 D promoter is transactivated in both human and murine cells when cotransfected with vectors expressing the protein product of the upstream gene HOX 3 C and the paralogs of further upstream genes in the HOX 4 cluster (i. e. HOX 4 D, HOX 4 C and the murine Hox 4. 3). The HOX 3 D protein, and those encoded by the downstream gene HOX 3 E and its paralog HOX 4 B are instead inactive. HOX 4 C and HOX 4 D proteins synthesized in bacteria bind to the same conserved sequence located around position - 120, {{as well as to the}} TATA box and immediately upstream and downstream nucleotides. These data provide evidence that cross-regulatory interactions between mammalian <b>homeogenes</b> take place in cultured cells, thus raising the possibility that a regulatory network may exist in vivo. The sequences on the HOX 3 D promoter involved in cross-regulation are different from those binding nuclear factors induced by RA...|$|R
40|$|Bioactive glasses {{have been}} shown to stimulate osteogenesis both in vivo and in vitro. However, the {{molecular}} mechanisms underlying this process are still poorly understood. In this study, we have investigated the behaviour of osteoblast-like cells (MG 63), cultured in the presence of bioglass particles. Three types of granules were used: 45 S 5 registered bioactive glass, 45 S 5 registered granules preincubated in tris buffer and 60 S non-reactive glass, used as control. Phase contrast microscopy permitted step-by-step visualization of cell cultures in contact with the particles. Ultrastructural observations of undecalcified sections revealed direct contacts of the cells and an electron-dense layer located at the periphery of the material. Protein synthesis was evaluated biochemically and showed a gradual increase throughout the culture time in the three types of cultures. Alkaline phosphatase was detected in situ, in clusters of packed cells either in contact with the material or in the background cell layer. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis of the main osteoblastic markers showed that gene expression was maintained in all three cultures. The fact that osteocalcin was not detected, supports the fact that the MG 63 cell line is composed of less differentiated osteogenic cells rather than mature osteoblasts. We also demonstrated {{for the first time in}} this cell line, the expression of Msx- 2, Dlx- 3 and Dlx- 7 <b>homeogenes,</b> known to regulate in vivo foetal skeletogenesis as well as adult skeletal regeneration. However, no significant differences could be recognised in the expression pattern of bone markers between the three types of cultures. Yet these preliminary results indicate that bioactive glasses provided a suitable environment for the growth and proliferation of osteoblasts in vitro, since no drastic changes in phenotype expression of pre-osteoblasts was noted...|$|R
40|$|Epidemiological {{data and}} family studies in autism {{show that there}} is a genetic {{susceptibility}} factor in the aetiology of this syndrome. We carried out an association study in infantile autism. Two markers of the <b>homeogene</b> EN 2 involved in cerebellar development were tested in a population of 100 autistic children and in a population of 100 control children. With the MP 4 probe showing a PvuII polymorphism, significant differences in the allele frequencies between the two populations were found (chi 2 = 7. 99, df = 1, p < 0. 01). With the MP 5 probe showing an SstI polymorphism, no difference appeared (chi 2 = 1. 17, not significant). Several clinical examinations allowed us to characterise the autistic children. Most of them had high scores for autistic behaviour and language disorders but low scores for neurological syndromes. Two children had a significant family history and six children had confirmed syndromes or diseases of genetic origin. Discriminant analysis between clinical and molecular data did not give significant results. These preliminary results must be supported by further analyses of this gene and by studies of its potential involvement in the pathophysiology of the autistic syndrome...|$|E
40|$|We have {{previously}} {{shown that a}} cell cycle-dependent nucleoprotein complex assembles in vivo on a 74 bp sequence within the human DNA replication origin associated to the Lamin B 2 gene. Here, we report the identification, using a one-hybrid screen in yeast, of three proteins interacting with the 74 bp sequence. All of them, namely HOXA 13, HOXC 10 and HOXC 13, are orthologues of the Abdominal-B gene of Drosophila melanogaster and {{are members of the}} <b>homeogene</b> family of developmental regulators. We describe the complete open reading frame sequence of HOXC 10 and HOXC 13 along with the structure of the HoxC 13 gene. The specificity of binding of these two proteins to the Lamin B 2 origin is confirmed by both band-shift and in vitro footprinting assays. In addition, the ability of HOXC 10 and HOXC 13 to increase the activity of a promoter containing the 74 bp sequence, as assayed by CAT-assay experiments, demonstrates a direct interaction of these homeoproteins with the origin sequence in mammalian cells. We also show that HOXC 10 expression is cell-type-dependent and positively correlates with cell proliferation...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} cloning {{of the fourth}} major murine <b>homeogene</b> complex, HOX- 5. The partial {{characterization}} of this gene cluster revealed the presence of two novel genes (Hox- 5. 2, Hox- 5. 3) located at the 5 ' extremity of this complex. In situ hybridization experiments showed that these two genes are transcribed in very posterior domains during embryonic and foetal development. We also show that Hox- 1. 6, the gene located at the 3 ' most position in the HOX- 1 complex, has a very anterior expression boundary during early development. These results clearly support the recently proposed hypothesis that the expression of murine Antp-like homeobox-containing genes along the antero-posterior developing body axis follows a positional hierarchy which reflects their respective physical positions within the HOX clusters, similar to that which is found for the Drosophila homeotic genes. Such a structural and functional organization is likely conserved in most vertebrates. Moreover, {{on the basis of}} sequence comparisons, we propose that the ordering of homeobox-containing genes within clusters has been conserved between Drosophila and the house mouse. Thus, very different body plans might be achieved, both in insects and vertebrates, by evolutionarily conserved gene networks possibly displaying similar regulatory interactions...|$|E
40|$|The {{congenital}} malformation Split Hand-Foot Malformation (SHFM, or ectrodactyly) {{is characterized by}} a medial cleft of hands and feet, and missing central fingers. Five genetically distinct forms are known in humans; the most common (type- 1) is linked to deletions of DSS 1 and the distalless-related <b>homeogenes</b> DLX 5 and DLX 6. As Dlx 5;D 1 x 6 double-knockout mice show a SHFM-like phenotype, the human orthologs are believed to be the disease genes. SHFM-IV and Ectrodactyly-Ectodermal dysplasia-Cleft lip (EEC) are caused by mutations in p 63, an ectoderm-specific p 53 -related transcription factor. The similarity in the limb phenotype of different forms of SHFM may underlie the existence of a regulatory cascade involving the disease genes. Here, we show that p 63 and Dlx proteins colocalize in the nuclei of the apical ectodermal ridge (AER). In homozygous p 63 - (null) and p 63 EEC (R 279 H) mutant limbs, the AER fails to stratify and the expression of four Dlx genes is strongly reduced; interestingly, the p 63 +/EEC and p 63 +/- hindlimbs, which develop normally and have a normally stratified AER, show reduced Dlx gene expression. The p 63 +/EEC mutation combined with an incomplete loss of Dlx 5 and Dlx 6 alleles leads to severe limb phenotypes, which are not observed in mice with either mutation alone. In vitro, Î”Np 63 Î± induces transcription from the D 1 x 5 and D 1 x 6 promoters, an activity abolished by EEC and SHFM-IV mutations, but not by Ankyloblepharon-Ectodermal defects-Cleft lip/palate (AEC) mutations. ChIP analysis shows that p 63 is directly associated with the Dlx 5 and Dlx 6 promoters. Thus, our data strongly implicate p 63 and the Dlx 5 -Dlx 6 locus in a pathway relevant in the aetio-pathogenesis of SHFM...|$|R
40|$|PAX 3 is a {{transcription}} factor that is expressed early during embryonic development. The PAX 3 protein is a DNA binding protein and functions {{either as a}} transcription activator or as a repressor. The effects of PAX 3 on transcription depend on its association with corepressors. Mutations in the Pax 3 gene {{were found to be}} responsible for the Waardenburg syndrome type 1 (WS 1) and alveolar rhabdomyo-sarcoma (ARMS) in humans. Transcription is a critical stage in eukaryotic gene regulation. Over the past years, modulation of chromatin structure has shown to be critical to transcriptional regulation. Recent studies have revealed that there are different mechanisms capable of altering chromatin, one being post- translational modifications on the histone amino-terminal tails, including acetylation and methylation. Acetylation of histone tails by histone acetyltransferases (HATs) results in chromatin relaxation and transcriptional activation, and deacetylation by histone deacetylases (HDACs) results in the converse. Methylation of histone H 3 on lysine 9 by SUV 391 methyltransferases (HMTases) creats a binding site for heterochromatin protein 1 (HP 1), which involves in gene silencing. PAX 3 has transcriptional repression activity. The prevailing models for transcriptional repression are : 1, deacetylation of histones by HDAC; 2, maintenance of heterochromatin structure by HP 1. In this work, I provide evidence about the relationship between the repression activity of PAX 3 and the chromatin structure. First, using co-immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down analyses, I demonstrated that PAX 3 associated with HDAC 10, as well as HP 1. By deletional mutation, both HDAC 10 and HP 1 bound the N-terminal pired box domain of PAX 3. Second, PAX 3 colocalized with HDAC 10 and KAP- 1 within the nucleus in confocal microscopy. Furthermore, the C-terminal homeobox domain of PAX 3 was required for its localization. Finally, I purified a PAX 3 protein complex and found some new PAX 3 -binding proteins. PAX 3 是個在脊椎動物早期胚胎發生上，扮演重要角色的轉錄因子。在人類罕見疾病：瓦登伯革氏症候群 (Waardenburg Syndrome) 、橫紋肌肉瘤 (Rhabdomyosarcoma) 病患中，發現都有Pax 3 發生突變的現象。目前對於PAX 3 的研究已知PAX 3 是DNA結合蛋白，可活化或抑制下游基因的轉錄，也會和其他蛋白有結合作用，進而影響 PAX 3 對下游基因轉錄的調控。 在真核生物，基因表現主要受控於轉錄的階段。近幾年研究認為，染色質結構的變化和轉錄的進行有著密切的關係。其中histone N-terminal tail的轉錄後修飾參與很多轉錄調控。目前研究較多的修飾作用包括:乙醯化，作用酵素HAT及HDAC和轉錄因子結合，在histone lysine加上或去除乙醯基使得染色質鬆散或緊實，進而活化或抑制基因轉錄;甲基化，H 3 -Lys 9 加上甲基後，吸引HP 1 結合，造成gene silencing。根據許多研究報告指出，PAX 3 其轉錄活性可能與上述機制有關。因此，這份研究欲針對PAX 3 轉錄的活性和histone tail的轉錄後修飾是否有關係來探討。 首先，PAX 3 偵測出抑制轉錄活性，進而針對其可能機制探討: 1. HDAC，去除 lysine 上的乙醯基使染色質緊實， 2. HP 1 結合到甲基化H 3 -Lys 9 後造成的 gene silencing。研究發現，PAX 3 對 HDAC 10 有明顯的結合力。另一方面，發現 PAX 3 與 HP 1 也有結合。Deletion mutation 分析結果，HDAC 10 和 HP 1 皆與 PAX 3 N-terminal 171 個胺基酸結合。另外，PAX 3 位於細胞核內，其分佈則是特定集中於某些區域，與 HP 1 的分佈相似。進一步分析發現 PAX 3 C-terminal 308 個胺基酸在核內的分佈與完整 PAX 3 相似，認為與 PAX 3 在核內分部有關。最後純化並分析 PAX 3 蛋白複合體，研究 PAX 3 可能具有的功能，從中找到些蛋白成員。簡而言之，PAX 3 抑制轉錄活性可能來自於與 HDAC、HP 1 的結合。中文摘要 英文摘要 緒論 一. 前言 二.

40|$|Despite {{the intense}} {{research}} on adult {{neural stem cell}} biology suggested possible translational outcomes in regenerative medicine for neurodegenerative diseases, neuroregeneration is unlikely to occur in adult brain, due to intrinsic features that characterize the neural stem cell niche. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), osteogenic stem cells residing in the bone marrow stroma (also named bone marrow stromal cells), have been long considered highly plastic multipotent precursors, able to commit toward diversified lineages, including non-mesodermal ones. Their in vitro plasticity and ease of processing prompted their wide, sometimes untimely, exploitation in diversified regenerative medicine applications (Park et al., 2012; Bianco et al., 2013). They have been tested also for their putative, yet widely debated, neuroregenerative potential. This controversial issue stimulated this Research Topic, which aims to delve into relevant scientific milestones addressing the differences, possible interconnections, and overlaps between the osteogenic and the neurogenic niches' biology. The debated neuronal transdifferentiation potential of MSCs recently led to their inappropriate exploitation {{for the treatment of}} neurodegenerative disorders. The regulatory and ethical issues regarding this topic have been discussed in the Opinion paper by Solarino et al., delving into a recent Italian case of medical malpractice, which triggered significant international dispute (Abbott, 2013; Blasimme and Rial-Sebbag, 2013). Indeed, a better clarification of the specific features displayed by the osteogenic and the neurogenic stem cell niches is needed, as discussed by Lattanzi et al. This mini-review provides a pairwise comparison of the two niches within their in vivo environments, highlighting functionally relevant similarities and differences that should be considered to achieve a more rational clinical translation. The contribution by Salgado et al. provides an exhaustive description of osteogenic and neural stem cells' features, focusing on their possible interaction within the brain environment. In particular, the MSCs' secretome is known to exert autocrine and paracrine effects that may be relevant for potential therapeutic exploitations, also in the central nervous system (Ribeiro et al., 2011; Drago et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2013; Sart et al., 2014; Wright et al., 2014). The role of neural crest stem cells (NCSCs) in regulating the bone marrow niche is provided in the review by Coste et al. NCSCs are capable of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and ultimately give rise to both neural precursors and nestin-positive MSCs, actively involved in the homeostatic regulation of the hematopoietic stem cell niche (Achilleos and Trainor, 2012; Mayor and Theveneau, 2013). A significant overlap between the two niches relies on the molecular (Wnt, NOTCH, FGF, TGF-BMP, SHH signaling pathways) and secretome (BDNF, NGF, VEGF, PDGF) profiles, along with the intimate relationship with vessels, being a common structural feature observed in adult stem cell niches. Diverse phylogenetically old signaling pathways, including nucleotides and neuropeptides, are shared between the osteogenic and the neurogenic niches, exerting trophic, and immunomodulatory functions. Cavaliere et al. exhaustively discussed the often opposing roles played by purinergic ligands. These establish a common paracrine pathway that modulates MSCs' and NSCs' activity, in both physiological and pathological conditions. They appear {{to be involved in the}} crosstalk between the two niches, by modulating the immune response, which triggers stem cell recruitment after stressful insults (Cavaliere et al.). Among neuropeptides, the direct effects of neuropeptide Y (NPY), mediator for signaling in both neurogenic and osteogenic niches, has been reviewed by Geloso et al., with special attention to its effects on neurogenic niche. Data indicating a direct pro-neurogenic effect of NPY on NSCs, as well as the concomitant modulatory action on astrocytes, microglia, and endothelium activities within the niche have been discussed. Interestingly, a possible crosstalk between released nucleotides and NPY related pathways emerges (Jia and Hegg, 2012), suggesting that they could also represent a point of intersection between shared ancient molecular pathways. Neurotransmitters released by the sympathetic nervous system, interestingly including NPY, as recently reviewed by Park et al. (2015), are known to be also involved in the regulation of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) functions, mainly acting on endothelial cells and nestin-positive MSCs, which retain HSCs. In this regard, the relevance of catecholaminergic modulation of hematopoiesis has been extensively reviewed by Cosentino and coworkers (Cosentino et al.), highlighting their established role in the complex network of neural and neuroendocrine agents that regulate stem cell biology (Cosentino et al.). Within the wide range of external stimuli acting on the epigenetic control of adult tissue stem cell niches, the effects of extremely-low frequency electromagnetic field (ELFEF) stimulation is emerging as a tool to modulate neurogenic and osteogenic processes, as discussed by Leone et al. They highlighted the possible shared pathways induced by ELFEFS on both niches, including Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and the activation of p 300 or other histone acetyltransferases by Runx 2 (Leone et al.). The interdependence of brain and skull during development seems to rely also on the role of interposed meninges (Richtsmeier and Flaherty, 2013). Within this intriguing topic, Bifari et al. provided findings showing the distribution of neural precursor markers in rat meninges during development up to adulthood, related to the newly identified niche function of meninges (Decimo et al., 2011). Finally, an interesting evolutionary perspective on the relation between osteogenesis and neurogenesis is provided in the opinion paper by Boeckx and Benítez-Burraco, who approached this topic from a different “biolinguistic” standpoint. The Authors postulated that critical genes active in the osteogenic niche (including <b>homeogenes,</b> e. g. DLXs, morphogens, e. g. BMPs, and the master regulatory RUNX 2 gene), hence giving rise to skull globularity in anatomically modern humans, also have important consequences in brain development and plasticity, ultimately leading to our distinctive mode of cognition (Boeckx and Benítez-Burraco). Taken together, the papers included in this research topic seem to suggest an emerging cross-domain scenario in which significant molecular signaling and biological features are shared between osteogenic and neurogenic stem cells niches. The two niches appear to be interconnected in evolution, during development, and further beyond. Nonetheless, relevant differences in the relative stem cell niche dynamics should not be neglected, in order to appropriately design potential cross-lineage tissue regenerative strategies...|$|R
40|$|Cnidarians {{represent}} the first animal phylum with an organized nervous {{system and a}} complex active behavior. The hydra nervous system is formed of sensory-motoneurons, ganglia neurons and mechanoreceptor cells named nematocytes, which all differentiate from a common stem cell. The neurons are organized as a nerve net and a subset of neurons participate in a more complex structure, the nerve ring that was identified in most cnidarian species {{at the base of}} the tentacles. In order to better understand the genetic control of this neuronal network, we analysed the expression of evolutionarily conserved regulatory genes in the hydra nervous system. The Prd-class <b>homeogene</b> prdl-b and the nuclear orphan receptor hyCOUP-TF are expressed at strong levels in proliferating nematoblasts, a lineage where they were found repressed during patterning and morphogenesis, and at low levels in distinct subsets of neurons. Interestingly, Prd-class homeobox and COUP-TF genes are also expressed during neurogenesis in bilaterians, suggesting that mechanoreceptor and neuronal cells derive from a common ancestral cell. Moreover, the Prd-class homeobox gene prdl-a, the Antp-class homeobox gene msh, and the thrombospondin-related gene TSP 1, which are expressed in distinct subset of neurons in the adult polyp, are also expressed during early budding and/or head regeneration. These data strengthen the fact that two distinct regulations, one for neurogenesis and another for patterning, already apply to these regulatory genes, a feature also identified in bilaterian related genes...|$|E
40|$|We {{report that}} Emx 2 <b>homeogene</b> is {{expressed}} at the mRNA and protein {{levels in the}} adult mouse olfactory neuroepithelium. As expected for a transcription factor, Emx 2 {{is present in the}} nucleus of immature and mature olfactory sensory neurons. However, the protein is also detected in the axonal compartment of these neurons, both in the olfactory mucosa axon bundles and in axon terminals within the olfactory bulb. Emx 2 axonal staining is heterogeneous, suggesting an association with particles. Subcellular fractionations of olfactory bulb synaptosomes, combined with chemical lesions of olfactory neurons, confirm the presence of Emx 2 in axon terminals. Significant amounts of Emx 2 protein cosediment with high density synaptosomal subfractions containing eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 E (eIF 4 E). Nonionic detergents and RNase treatments failed to detach eIF 4 E and Emx 2 from these high-density fractions enriched in vesicles and granular structures. In addition, Emx 2 and eIF 4 E can be coimmunoprecipitated from olfactory mucosa and bulb extracts and interact directly, as demonstrated in pull-down experiments. Emx 2 axonal localization, association with high-density particles and interaction with eIF 4 E strongly suggest that this transcription factor has new nonnuclear functions most probably related to the local control of protein translation in the olfactory sensory neuron axons. Finally, we show that two other brain-expressed homeoproteins, Otx 2 and Engrailed 2, also bind eIF 4 E, indicating that several homeoproteins may modulate eIF 4 E functions in the developing and adult nervous system...|$|E
40|$|AbstractXenopuscerberus (Xcer) is a {{cytokine}} {{expressed in}} anterior mesendoderm overlapping and surrounding Spemann's gastrula organiser. When misexpressed in blastomeres, Xcer can induce ectopic heads with well-defined brain, cement gland, olfactory placodes, cyclopic eye, and occasionally liver and heart. We report here the identification ofmCer- 1,a murine gene related tocerberus. Both mCer- 1 and Xcer appear {{to belong to}} the cystine knot superfamily, which includes TGFβs and BMPs. InXenopusanimal cap assays, mCer- 1 and Xcer induced cement glands and markers of anterior neural tissue and endoderm, characteristic of BMP inhibition. Furthermore, both antagonised the ventrolateral mesoderm-inducing activity of coexpressed BMP 4. In mouse embryos,mCer- 1 was expressed at early gastrulation in a stripe of primitive endoderm along the future anterior side of the egg cylinder, a region essential for anterior patterning. A second phase of expression was detected in anterior embryonic mesendoderm, and by late-streak stages most of the anterior half of the embryo was positive, except for the node and cardiac progenitors. Expression was later seen in the cranial portion of the two most-recently formed somites and in two stripes within presomitic mesoderm. In embryos lackingOtx 2,a <b>homeogene</b> with a demonstrated role in anterior patterning,mCer- 1 was still expressed in an anterior zone, although often abnormally. The data suggest that mCer- 1 shares structural, functional, and expression characteristics with Xcer and may participate in patterning the anterior of the embryo and nascent somite region, in part, through a BMP-inhibitory mechanism...|$|E
40|$|Although a {{considerable}} number of reports indicate an involvement of the Hox-A 10 gene in the molecular control of hemopoiesis, the conclusions of such studies are quite controversial given that they support, in some cases, a role in the stimulation of stem cell self-renewal and myeloid progenitor expansion, whereas in others they implicate this transcription factor in the induction of monocyte-macrophage differentiation. To clarify this issue, we analyzed the biological effects and the transcriptome changes determined in human primary CD 34 + hemopoietic progenitors by retroviral transduction of a full-length Hox-A 10 cDNA. The results obtained clearly indicated that this <b>homeogene</b> is an inducer of monocyte differentiation, at least partly acting through the up-regulation of the MafB gene, recently identified as the master regulator of such a maturation pathway. By using a combined approach based on computational analysis, EMSA experiments, and luciferase assays, we were able to demonstrate the presence of a Hox-A 10 -binding site in the promoter region of the MafB gene, which suggested the likely molecular mechanism underlying the observed effect. Stimulation of the same cells with the vitamin D 3 monocyte differentiation inducer resulted in a clear increase of Hox-A 10 and MafB transcripts, indicating the existence of a precise transactivation cascade involving vitamin D 3 receptor, Hox-A 10, and MafB transcription factors. Altogether, these data allow one to conclude that the vitamin D 3 /Hox-A 10 pathway supports MafB function during the induction of monocyte differentiation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Modifications in Pax 6 <b>homeogene</b> {{expression}} produce strong eye phenotypes. This {{suggested to}} us that eye development might be an appropriate model to verify if homeoprotein intercellular passage has important functions in early development. Similar to other homeoproteins, Pax 6 has two domains that enable secretion and internalization by live cells and, thus, intercellular passage. In principle, a straightforward way {{to test the hypothesis}} would be to mutate one of the two sequences to produce a 'cell autonomous only' Pax 6. However, this was not possible because these sequences are in the homeodomain and their modification would affect Pax 6 transcriptional properties. We have thus developed an approach aimed at blocking Pax 6 only in the extracellular milieu of developing zebrafish embryos. Results A first strategy was to inject a one-cell embryo with a mRNA encoding a secreted single-chain anti-Pax 6 antibody. A second, complementary, strategy was to inject a Pax 6 antibody in the blastula extracellular milieu. In both cases, 'dissymmetric eyes', 'one eye only' and 'no eye' phenotypes were produced. In most cases, lens phenotypes paralleled retina malformations. Although eye phenotypes were analyzed 30 hours post-fertilization, there was a strong correlation between early eye field asymmetry, early asymmetry in Pax 6 expression and later-occurring eye malformations. Several controls were introduced, demonstrating that the effect is specific to Pax 6 and cannot be explained by intracellular antibody activities. Conclusion This study supports the hypothesis that the Pax 6 transcription factor is also a signaling molecule with direct non-cell autonomous activity. </p...|$|E
40|$|During {{neuronal}} {{development and}} maturation, microRNAs (miRs) play diverse functions ranging from early patterning, proliferation {{and commitment to}} differentiation, survival, homeostasis, activity and plasticity of more mature and adult neurons. The role of miRs in the differentiation of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) is emerging from the conditional inactivation of Dicer in immature ORN, and the depletion of all mature miRs in this system. Here, we identify specific miRs involved in olfactory development, by focusing on mice null for Dlx 5, a <b>homeogene</b> essential for both ORN differentiation and axon guidance and connectivity. Analysis of miR expression in Dlx 5 (-/-) olfactory epithelium pointed to reduced levels of miR- 9, miR- 376 a and four miRs of the - 200 class {{in the absence of}} Dlx 5. To functionally examine the role of these miRs, we depleted miR- 9 and miR- 200 class in reporter zebrafish embryos and observed delayed ORN differentiation, altered axonal trajectory/targeting, and altered genesis and position of olfactory-associated GnRH neurons, i. e. a phenotype known as Kallmann syndrome in humans. miR- 9 and miR- 200 -class negatively control Foxg 1 mRNA, a fork-head transcription factor essential for development of the olfactory epithelium and of the forebrain, known to maintain progenitors in a stem state. Increased levels of z-foxg 1 mRNA resulted in delayed ORN differentiation and altered axon trajectory, in zebrafish embryos. This work describes {{for the first time the}} role of specific miR (- 9 and - 200) in olfactory/GnRH development, and uncovers a Dlx 5 -Foxg 1 regulation whose alteration affects receptor neuron differentiation, axonal targeting, GnRH neuron development, the hallmarks of the Kallmann syndrome...|$|E
40|$|F 3 /Contactin is a {{neuronal}} glycoprotein which mediates axonal growth control via {{complex interactions}} {{with a number}} of cell surface or matrix components. As part of this developmental role, its expression undergoes differential regulation during the maturation of definite neuronal populations within the central and peripheral nervous tissue. To elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms we study here the organization of the regulatory region of the mouse F 3 /Contactin gene. We show that this region displays peculiar features in that it spans more than 80 kb, bears very large introns and includes four untranslated exons which undergo complex splicing events leading to 11 potential arrangements of the F 3 /Contactin mRNA 5 ′ end. Within this region we identify three alternative neurospecific promoters which, as deduced from the developmental profile of the associated 5 ′ exons (A 1,C 1, 0), drive two different patterns of F 3 /Contactin gene expression. The activity of the A 1 exon-associated promoter displays only minor developmental changes and is likely to contribute to the basal level of the F 3 /Contactin gene expression; by contrast, the activities of the exon C 1 - and exon 0 -associated promoters are significantly upregulated {{at the end of the}} first postnatal week. The data indicate that differential regulation of the F 3 /Contactin expression during development may depend upon alternative utilization of distinct promoter elements and may involve complex splicing events of the 5 ′ untranslated exons. Several consensuses for <b>homeogene</b> transcription factors are scattered within the identified regulatory region, in agreement with the general assumption of homeotic gene regulation of neural morphoregulatory molecules...|$|E

En 2 has been suggested to be an autism susceptibility gene and individuals with autism display an overexpression of this <b>homeogene</b> but the mechanisms remain unclear. We addressed {{in the present study}} the effect of exogenously added En 2 on the morphology of hippocampal cells that normally express only low levels of Engrailed proteins. By means of RT-qPCR, we confirmed that En 1 and En 2 were expressed at low levels in hippocampus and hippocampal neurons, and observed a pronounced decrease in En 2 expression at birth and during the first postnatal week, a period characterized by intense synaptogenesis. To address a putative effect of Engrailed in dendritogenesis or synaptogenesis, we added recombinant En 1 or En 2 proteins to hippocampal cell cultures. Both En 1 and En 2 treatment increased the complexity of the dendritic tree of glutamatergic neurons, but only En 2 increased that of GABAergic cells. En 1 increased the density of dendritic spines both in vitro and in vivo. En 2 had similar but less pronounced effect on spine density. The number of mature synapses remained unchanged upon En 1 treatment but was reduced by En 2 treatment, as well as the area of post-synaptic densities. Finally, both En 1 and En 2 elevated mTORC 1 activity and protein synthesis in hippocampal cells, suggesting that some effects of Engrailed proteins may require mRNA translation. Our results indicate that Engrailed proteins can play, even at low concentrations, {{an active role in the}} morphogenesis of hippocampal cells. Further, they emphasize the over-regulation of GABA cell morphology and the vulnerability of excitatory synapses in a pathological context of En 2 overexpression...|$|E
40|$|During {{embryonic}} development, immature neurons in the olfactory epithelium (OE) extend axons {{through the}} nasal mesenchyme, to contact projection neurons in the olfactory bulb. Axon navigation {{is accompanied by}} migration of the GnRH+ neurons, which enter the anterior forebrain and home in the septo-hypothalamic area. This process can be interrupted at various points and lead to {{the onset of the}} Kallmann syndrome (KS), a disorder characterized by anosmia and central hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Several genes has been identified in human and mice that cause KS or a KS-like phenotype. In mice a set of transcription factors appears to be required for olfactory connectivity and GnRH neuron migration; thus we explored the transcriptional network underlying this developmental process by profiling the OE and the adjacent mesenchyme at three embryonic ages. We also profiled the OE from embryos null for Dlx 5, a <b>homeogene</b> that causes a KS-like phenotype when deleted. We identified 20 interesting genes belonging to the following categories: 1) transmembrane adhesion/receptor, 2) axon-glia interaction, 3) scaffold/adapter for signalling, 4) synaptic proteins. We tested some of them in zebrafish embryos: the depletion of five (of six) Dlx 5 targets affected axonal extension and targeting, while three (of three) affected GnRH neuron position and neurite organization. Thus, we confirmed the importance of cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions and identified new molecules needed for olfactory connection and GnRH neuron migration. Using available and newly generated data, we predicted/prioritized putative KS-disease genes, by building conserved co-expression networks with all known disease genes in human and mouse. The results show the overall validity of approaches based on high-throughput data and predictive bioinformatics to identify genes potentially relevant for the molecular pathogenesis of KS. A number of candidate will be discussed, that should be tested in future mutation screens...|$|E
40|$|Tp 53, Tp 63 and Tp 73 {{family members}} encode for {{transcription}} factors which {{play a key}} role in control of the genome integrity inducing cell-cycle arrest, senescence, apoptosis or cell differentiation. They take a part in cell stress response and in tumor suppression (De Young MP and Ellisen LW, 2007). Wild type p 53 protein is a growth modulator and its inactivation is a critical event in malignant transformation (Gasco M, 2002). It has been recently demonstrated that p 53 has developmental and differentiation functions (Hu W, 2008). Indeed an over-expression of p 53 in tumor cells induces asymmetrical division avoiding a self-renewal of cancer stem cells (CSCs) and promoting their differentiation (Cicalese A, 2009). In this study 43 human ductal and lobular invasive breast carcinomas have been analyzed for the expression of p 53, p 63, p 73 and a pool of non-clustered homeobox genes. The homeogenes play a crucial role in embryogenesis, regulating cell differentiation and proliferation (Pagani IS, 2010). They are expressed in adult mammary gland and when deregulated, are involved in breast cancer (Lewis MT, 2000). We demonstrated that the Otx 1 <b>homeogene</b> is transcribed in breast cancer, in CSCs differentiation and in adult mammary gland development. We established that the p 53 and p 73 proteins directly induce the Otx 1 expression by acting on its promoter. Otx 1 has been described as a critical molecule for axon refinement in corticogenesis (Zhang YA, 2002), and its activity in breast cancer suggests a synergistic function with p 53 and p 73 in CSCs differentiation. In adult mammary gland development the Otx 1 expression is not regulated by p 53, but is correlated with the expression of Tp 73 in lactation and in regression. This suggests that in physiological conditions Otx 1 is regulated by p 73, while in the tumors p 53 regulates its expression...|$|E
