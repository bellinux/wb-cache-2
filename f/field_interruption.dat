40|$|The {{generation}} of rapid fluctuations, or spikes, in hard X-ray and microwave bursts via {{the disruption of}} electron heating and acceleration in current sheets is studied. It is found that 20 msec hard X-ray fluctuations can be thermally generated in a current sheet if the resistivity in the sheet is highly anomalous, the plasma density in the emitting region is relatively high, and {{the volume of the}} emitting region is greater than that of the current sheet. A specific mechanism for producing the fluctuations, involving heating in the presence of ion acoustic turbulence and a constant driving electric <b>field,</b> and <b>interruption</b> of the heating by a strong two-stream instability, is discussed. Variations upon this mechanism are also discussed. This mechanism also modulates electron acceleration, as required for the microwave spike emission. If the hard X-ray emission at energies less than approx. 1000 keV is nonthermal bremsstrahlung, the coherent modulation of electron acceleration in a large number of current sheets is required...|$|R
40|$|When {{using the}} computer, each user has some notion that "these {{applications}} are important" {{at a given}} point in time. We term this subset of applications that a user values as high-utility applications. Identifying high-utility applications is a critical first step for Task Analysis, Time Management/Workflow Analysis, and Interruption research. However, existing techniques fail to identify at least 57 % of these applications. Our work directly associates measurable computer interaction (CPU consumption, window area, etc.) with the user???s perceived application utility without identifying task. We present an objective utility function that accurately predicts the user???s subjective impressions of application importance, improving existing techniques by 53 %. This model of computer usage is based upon 321 hours of real-world data from 22 users (both professional and academic). Unlike existing approaches, our model {{is not limited to}} a pre-existing set of applications or known tasks. We conclude with a discussion of the direct implications for improving accuracy in the <b>fields</b> of <b>interruptions,</b> task analysis, and time management systems. unpublishednot peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Today we {{are going}} up against {{with the issue of}} high {{dimensionality}} and outsized measure of information, network intrusion detection is always the focus of current research in the network security field. It is the spoiling of data security rules by pernicious exercises. Interruption discovery (ID) is a progression of strategies for distinguishing and perceiving incredulous activities that make the move acknowledgment of benchmarks of protection/classification, prominence, unwavering quality, and accessibility of a PC based system framework.

40|$|International audienceDynamic {{flexibility}} {{is a major}} challenge in modern system design to react to context or applicative requirements evolutions. Adapting behaviors may impose substantial code modification across the whole system, in the <b>field,</b> without service <b>interruption</b> and without state loss. This paper presents the JnJVM, a full Java virtual machine (JVM) that satisfies these needs by using dynamic aspect weaving techniques and a component architecture. It supports adding or replacing its own code, while it is running, with no overhead on unmodified code execution. Our measurements reveal similar performance {{when compared with the}} monolithic JVM Kaffe. Three illustrative examples show different extension scenarios: (i) modifying the JVMs behavior; (ii) adding capabilities to the JVM; and (iii) modifying applications behavior...|$|R

Procedures were devised for inferring the lines of polarity reversal from H-alpha solar patrol photographs that map the same large-scale features found on Mt. Wilson magnetograms. These features may be monitored without interruption by combining observations from the global network of observatories associated with NOAA's Space Environment Services Center. The patterns of inferred {{magnetic fields}} may be followed accurately as far as 60 deg from central meridian.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an approach for investigating in a pre-dictive way potential disruptive effects of interruptions on task {{performance in a}} multitasking environment. The ap-proach combines previous work in the <b>field</b> of <b>interruption</b> analysis, formal description techniques for interactive sys-tems and stochastic processes to support performance anal-ysis of user activities constrained by the occurrence of in-terruptions. The approach uses formal description tech-niques to provide a precise description of user tasks, and both system and interruptions behavior. The detailed me-chanism by which systems and interruptions behave is first described using a Petri nets-based formal description tech-nique called Interactive Cooperative Objects (ICO). The use of a formal modeling technique for the description of these three components {{makes it possible to}} compare and analyze different interaction techniques. In particular, it allows us to determine which of the system states are most affected by the occurrence of interruptions. Once composed together, models describing the system, user tasks and in-terruptions behavior are transformed into PEPA models (i. e. Performance Evaluation Process Algebra) that are amenable to performance analysis using the PRISM model checker. The approach is exemplified by a simple example that models two interaction techniques for manipulating icons in a desktop environment.

40|$|Since {{the fifties}} of last century, the heart-lung machine {{is used in}} cardiac surgery. It {{provides}} a clear and quiet operative <b>field</b> without <b>interruption</b> of blood supply during surgery. However, the interaction of patient's blood with the artificial surface of various components of the heart-lung machine brings a number of undesirable complications, which are described as post pump syndrome and manifest as stroke, acute coronary syndrome, exorbitant bleeding, pulmonary edema, acute renal and liver failure and transitory psychotic syndrome. Therefore it was and is striving to develop minimized systems that have a significant reduction of foreign surface and a coating with biocompatible materials to facilitate a shorter and less intense foreign surface contact. In this clinical trial, 25 patients who underwent coronary bypass surgery were studied and evaluated. 15 patients were operated with a conventional heart-lung machine and 10 patients with a minimized, phosphorylcholine-coated system. The result of the analysis showed a significantly higher increase of hemolysis, the inflammatory cytokines, myocardial cell injury, and coagulatory activity, accompanied by increased fibrinolysis {{in the group of}} conventional heart-lung machine compared to the group with minimized system. However, these differences were transient and not accompanied by a clinical benefit. Overall, it can thus be stated that a reduction of the extracorporeal components and a coating with biocompatible materials such as phosphorylcholine leads to a significant reduction of laboratory parameters in favour of the minimized system. The phosphorylcholine-coating, however, seems to be less important for the significant differences. Rather, the advantages mentioned are merits of the minimized system.

Achromadora walkeri sp. n. was found in rhizosoil of the native California grape Vitis californica Bentham and {{is characterized by the}} position of the amphid (within the vicinity of both dorsal and ventral teeth), a relatively long stoma, and the absence of a prerectum. The other 2 species were plant parasitic criconematids: Criconemoides featherensis sp. n., found in association with roots of V. californica, is characterized by possessing strongly retrose annuli posterior to the vulva, a long stylet, the shape of the first annulus of the head, and rare anastomosis of annuli of the body. Specimens of Hemicycliophora armandae sp. n. were recovered from the rhizosoil of the desert grape Vilis girdiana Munson and are characterized by having 3 cephalic annuli, a lateral <b>field</b> marked by <b>interruption</b> of the striae, a long stylet, and a digitate tail.

40|$|Comprehensive {{measurements}} of magnetic {{fields in the}} solar corona {{have a long history}} as an important scientific goal. Besides being crucial to understanding coronal structures and the Sun’s generation of space weather, direct {{measurements of}} their strength and direction are also crucial steps in understanding observed wave motions. In this regard, the remote sensing instrumentation used to make coronal magnetic field measurements is well suited to measuring the Doppler signature of waves in the solar structures. In this paper, we describe the design and scientific values of the Waves and Magnetism in the Solar Atmosphere (WAMIS) investigation. WAMIS, taking advantage of greatly improved infrared filters and detectors, forward models, advanced diagnostic tools and inversion codes, is a long-duration high-altitude balloon payload designed to obtain a breakthrough in the measurement of coronal magnetic fields and in advancing the understanding of the interaction of these fields with space plasmas. It consists of a 20 cm aperture coronagraph with a visible-IR spectro-polarimeter focal plane assembly. The balloon altitude would provide minimum sky background and atmospheric scattering at the wavelengths in which these observations are made. It would also enable continuous measurements of the strength and direction of coronal magnetic <b>fields</b> without <b>interruptions</b> from the day-night cycle and weather. These measurements will be made over a large field-of-view allowing one to distinguish the magnetic signatures of different coronal structures, and at the spatial and temporal resolutions required to address outstanding problems in coronal physics. Additionally, WAMIS could obtain near simultaneous observations of the electron scattered K-corona for context and to obtain the electron density. These comprehensive observations are not provided by any current single ground-based or space observatory. The fundamental advancements achieved by the near-space observations of WAMIS on coronal field would point the way for future ground based and orbital instrumentation...|$|R
40|$|The planned {{research}} {{grows out}} of the existing literature on teams, the PIs’ extensive research on team collaborationand communication in many kinds of organizations, and our preliminary field work in a shock trauma hospital. Fromthis background, we have developed an initial theoretical framework for understanding the intersecting paths alongwhich work and team members flow {{in a large scale}} collaboration. We have adopted the concept of trajectories torefer to the sequence of activities and paths through which people, resources, and teams move. In the complexhospital environment, patient, resource, and staff trajectories must interweave or intersect in specific ways forspecific purposes. Coordinating multiple trajectories of events and activities requires the orchestration of thesetrajectories so that they are coupled or decoupled as necessary. Our research attempts to understand how interruptionstrategies and mechanisms, people’s awareness of the flow of trajectories, and social factors, especially leadershipand social differences, affect the management of trajectories. We will develop and evaluate technology to improvethe management of trajectories. We propose <b>field</b> studies of <b>interruption</b> and trajectory awareness in a shock traumahospital, laboratory studies of how people manage and lead divergent task and team trajectories in different criticalenvironments, and development of technology for providing people with tools for mobile awareness of the status ofrelevant trajectories, for remote access to public collaborative artifacts and databases (such as operating roomschedules), and for obtaining more relevant visual and other information about activities along various trajectories.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} how nonroutine acts performed by iii trained emergency workers developed into routine emergency acts and skills. I will be specifically looking for concepts that are common throughout the different types of emergency workers that will be interviewed. The data is gathered from focus groups that were recruited from classes on campus. In particular the results depict some very common techniques used in training that allowed the workers to feel confident about their role in emergencies. These tended to include repetition of "classroom training, "but more importantly from the viewpoint of the workers, repetition of simulated emergencies. The development of autonomy in decision making was an important facet for workers whose work "territory" was varied; however, autonomy was rarely stressed for those in relatively constant surroundings such as pools. Several commonalities were found throughout each <b>field.</b> These included <b>interruptions,</b> self-efficacy, the use of judgment and tacit knowledge. Many of the participants also expressed the same sentiment towards their feelings of the training and its efficiency. Some research will also show attempts to change policy and training within emergency workers in order to improve job performance and enhance the safety of the public as well. I will include a small statistical appendix that looks at the satisfaction level of evacuees who fled to Houston, Texas when Hurricane Katrina hit. Five specific factors were examined and regressed to determine satisfaction levels. Only two factors showed any type of significance. As the discussion will indicate, certain previous factors, before the hurricane hit, are believed to be the cause of these particular results...|$|R
40|$|Interruptions in time-critical, dynamic, and {{collaborative}} environments, such as {{air traffic control}} (ATC), can provide valuable, task-relevant information. However, they also negatively impact task performance by distracting the operator from on-going tasks and consuming attention resources. This thesis develops and assesses a tool to assist radar air traffic controllers in managing <b>interruptions.</b> <b>Field</b> observations and interviews with air traffic controllers were utilized to {{develop an understanding of}} how interruptions occur in real ATC environments, and to identify where opportunities exist to use technology to support the interruption management process. It was identified that operators in these environments could better manage the effects of interruptions if there were indications to one operator of the availability of a collaborator and the urgency of an interruption from a collaborator. Present communication systems do not facilitate the awareness of these functionalities. An initial prototype for providing these functionalities in operational ATC displays was designed. Feedback on the prototypes was solicited through Participatory Design (PD) sessions with air traffic controllers. Based on the refinement of these prototypes, the Working Awareness Interruption Tool (WAIT) was developed to support more efficient and appropriate interruption timing in the context of complex, real-time, distributed, human operator interactions. Variations of the tool demonstrated several ways of showing the availability of the controller to be interrupted (either through manual settings or automatic detection) as well as incorporating a means of conveying the urgency level of the interruption. In order to examine the utility of the tool and to assess the importance and validity of its features, an experiment was conducted in a laboratory-based setting. The results of the experiment show the potential of this tool in an environment representative of air traffic control tasks and communication. Although the sample size was limited, the WAIT facilitated improved performance on both objective measures and self-reported measures, and reduced the distraction effects of interruptions from other operators. These improvements occurred without affecting perceptions of the effectiveness of communications. Questionnaire and interview results showed that participants appear to prefer an automated setting of availability to be shown to other collaborators. Identifying two examples of key features supporting interruption management (communicating availability and urgency) in air traffic control {{is one of the key}} contributions of this work. The work also makes a contribution by demonstrating that providing a tool incorporating these features can improve performance in an environment representative of ATC, albeit with naïve participants. Finally, the research makes a contribution by presenting the challenges associated with evaluating interruption management tools that require collaboration between operators in a system...|$|R
