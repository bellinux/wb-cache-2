50|$|Alternative to {{employing}} a power valve, the carburetor may utilize a metering rod or step-up rod system {{to enrich the}} fuel mixture under high-demand conditions. Such systems were originated by Carter Carburetor in the 1950s for the primary two Venturis of their four barrel carburetors, and step-up rods were widely used on most 1-, 2-, and 4-barrel Carter carburetors {{through the end of}} production in the 1980s. The step-up rods are tapered at the bottom end, which extends into the <b>main</b> <b>metering</b> <b>jets.</b> The tops of the rods are connected to a vacuum piston or a mechanical linkage which lifts the rods out of the main jets when the throttle is opened (mechanical linkage) or when manifold vacuum drops (vacuum piston). When the step-up rod is lowered into the main jet, it restricts the fuel flow. When the step-up rod is raised out of the jet, more fuel can flow through it. In this manner, the amount of fuel delivered is tailored to the transient demands of the engine. Some 4-barrel carburetors use metering rods only on the primary two Venturis, but some use them on both primary and secondary circuits, as in the Rochester Quadrajet.|$|R
50|$|To {{provide the}} extra fuel, a choke is {{typically}} used; {{this is a}} device that restricts the flow of air {{at the entrance to}} the carburetor, before the venturi. With this restriction in place, extra vacuum is developed in the carburetor barrel, which pulls extra <b>fuel</b> through the <b>main</b> <b>metering</b> system to supplement the fuel being pulled from the idle and off-idle circuits. This provides the rich mixture required to sustain operation at low engine temperatures.|$|R
25|$|Analysis of {{the engines}} found that their fuel systems were {{contaminated}} with spherical particles. The particles had caused the <b>Fuel</b> <b>Metering</b> Units' <b>Main</b> <b>Metering</b> Valves (MMVs) to seize; the MMVs {{were found to be}} stuck in positions corresponding to the recorded thrust output of each engine as it approached Hong Kong. Other engine components were found to be contaminated with the particles as well, and No. 2 engine's Variable Stator Vane Controller was also found to be seized; the entire fuel system including the aircraft's fuel tanks was found to be contaminated with the spherical particles. As part of the investigation, fuel samples had been collected at Juanda International Airport. Investigators found that the contaminant particles were present in the fuel samples. The fuel supply pipeline system used to refuel aircraft at Juanda International Airport had been extended prior to B-HLL being refuelled there, as part of the construction of new aircraft parking bays. The investigation discovered that not all procedures were followed when the fuel pipeline system was brought back into service.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to carry out an investigastion into {{suitable}} alternatives to gasoline for use in modern automobiles. The fuel would provide the western world with a means of extending the natural gasoline resources and the third world a way of cutting down their dependence on the oil producing countries for their energy supply. Alcohols, namely methanol and ethanol, provide this solution. They {{can be used as}} gasoline extenders or as fuels on their own. In order to fulfil the aims of the project a literature study was carried out to investigate methods and costs of producing these fuels. An experimental programme was then set up in which the performance of the alcohols was studied on a conventional engine. The engine used for this purpose was the Fiat 127 930 cc four cylinder engine. This engine was used because of its popularity in the European countries. The Weber fixed jet carburettor, since it was designed to be used with gasoline, was adapted so that the alcohol fuels and the blends could be used in the most efficient way. This was mainly to take account of the lower heat content of the alcohols. The adaptation of the carburettor was in the form of enlarging the <b>main</b> <b>metering</b> <b>jet.</b> Allowances for the alcohol's lower specfic gravity were made during fuel metering. Owing to the low front end volatility of methanol and ethanol, it was expected that `start up' problems would occur. An experimental programme was set up to determine the temperature range for a minimum required percentage `take off' that would ease start-up since it was determined that a `take off' of about 5 % v/v liquid in the vapour phase would be sufficient for starting. Additions such as iso-pentane and n-pentane were used to improve the front end volatility. This proved to be successful. The lower heat content of the alcohol fuels also meant that a greater charge of fuel would be required. This was seen to pose further problems with fuel distribution from the carburettor to the individual cylinders on a multicylinder engine. Since {{it was not possible to}} modify the existing manifold on the Fiat 127 engine, experimental tests on manifold geometry were carried out using the Ricardo E 6 single cylinder variable compression engine. Results from these tests showed that the length, shape and cross-sectional area of the manifold play an important part in the distribution of the fuel entering the cylinder, ie. vapour phase, vapour/small liquid droplet/liquid film phase, vapour/large liquid droplet/liquid film phase etc. The solvent properties of the alcohols and their greater electrical conductivity suggested that the materials used on the engine would be prone to chemical attack. In order to determine the type and rate of chemical attack, an experimental programme was set up whereby carburettor and other components were immersed in the alcohols and in blends of alcohol with gasoline. The test fuels were aerated and in some instances kept at temperatures ranging from 50 oC to 90 oC. Results from these tests suggest that not all materials used in the conventional engine are equally suitable for use with alcohols and alcohol/gasoline blends. Aluminium for instance was severely attacked by methanol causing pitting and pin-holing in the surface. In general this whole experimental programme gave valuable information on the acceptability of substitute fuels. While the long term effects of alcohol use merit further study, it is clear that methanol and ethanol will be increasingly used in place of gasoline...|$|R

5000|$|Carburettors are {{provided}} with a float chamber to provide a constant hydrostatic head of fuel above the carburettor's <b>metering</b> <b>jets,</b> thus a constant pressure. The float chamber itself does not vary the pressure according to demand, but it does vary the supply flowrate with demand, to keep this pressure constant.|$|R
50|$|When {{the engine}} starts and air {{begins to flow}} through the venturi, the {{pressure}} in the venturi drops according to Bernoulli's principle. This causes the pressure in chamber B to drop. At the same time, air entering the carburetor compresses {{the air in the}} impact tubes, generating a positive pressure based on the density and speed of the air as it enters. The difference in pressure between chamber A and chamber B creates the air metering force which opens the servo valve and allows fuel in. Chamber C and chamber D are connected by a fuel passage which contains the fuel <b>metering</b> <b>jets.</b> As fuel begins to flow, the pressure drop across the <b>metering</b> <b>jet</b> creates the fuel metering force which acts to close the servo valve until a balance is reached with the air pressure and the spring.|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} {{intention of}} the Fish carburettor was to avoid {{the problems of the}} float chamber, and its sensitivity to sideways forces from acceleration and cornering. In the conventional carburettor, a venturi in the airflow creates a lowered pressure and this is enough to encourage the flow of fuel through the <b>metering</b> <b>jets.</b> The flow rate is critically sensitive to the fuel pressure at the jet, i.e. the hydrostatic head owing to the depth of fuel between the jet and the float level. Any sloshing within the float chamber affected this. Fish's design kept the float chamber, but avoided the dependency of flow rate on fuel depth. The float chamber was sealed and pressurised by a ram air effect from the air inlet, which then caused fuel to flow through the <b>metering</b> <b>jet.</b> This flow rate was entirely independent of fuel level, but did remain approximately proportional to the mass airflow. The Fish carburettor was also sensitive to mass airflow, rather than volume airflow, making it self-compensating for changes due to temperature or altitude.|$|R

50|$|The 'choke' for constant-depression {{carburettors}} {{such as the}} SU or Stromberg {{does not}} use a choke valve in the air circuit but instead has a mixture enrichment circuit to increase fuel flow by opening the <b>metering</b> <b>jet</b> further or by opening an additional fuel jet or 'enrichment'.

This circuit works exactly like the idle circuit, and when engaged it simply supplies extra fuel when the throttle is closed.|$|R

The cavity operating conditions include 1) direct cavity fueling, 2) direct cavity fueling with back pressurization, and 3) <b>fueling</b> from <b>main</b> injectors with and without direct cavity fueling. With direct cavity fueling, significant variation in the shape and spatial distribution of the cavity flame was observed at various fuel flow rates with and without back pressurization.
