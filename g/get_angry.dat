At the {{emergency}} room, House suspects Jeff's extreme niceness and inability to <b>get</b> <b>angry</b> is a major symptom of an underlying condition. After various tests, the team suspects his niceness is a personality change resulting from syphilis.

5|$|Veronica {{connects the}} five {{people who were}} framed to an {{incident}} where a student was publicly harassed in gym class. Keith is still dating Alicia Fennel (Erica Gimpel). Veronica and Wallace spend the night investigating students, and Veronica eventually deduces that Wallace ingested {{a small amount of}} an illegal substance, most likely in a gift basket earlier that year. In a flashback, Veronica and Logan make out in the car until the PCH bikers shoot out the car's windows. Veronica asks Keith for help in finding out the names of a company's shareholders.

When Logan starts to <b>get</b> <b>angry,</b> Keith barges in and makes him leave. Logan is carrying on a relationship with Kendall.|$|E
25|$|Johnson {{was given}} a regular column in The Spectator, The Daily Telegraph sister publication; it {{attracted}} mixed reviews and was often thought rushed. In 1999, he was also given a column on new cars in the magazine GQ. His behaviour regularly annoyed his editors; those at GQ were frustrated by {{the large number of}} parking fines that Johnson acquired while testing cars for them, while he was consistently late in providing his columns for The Telegraph and The Spectator, forcing many staff to stay late to accommodate him; they related that if they went ahead and published without his work included, he would <b>get</b> <b>angry</b> and shout at them with expletives.|$|E

25|$|The final affective {{response}} or emotion seen in initial infidelity is anger (Johnson, 2017). Anger is {{an emotion}} that is felt in {{all stages of}} infidelity, but in different ways and at different calibers. In {{the initial stages of}} infidelity anger is an underlying emotion that is usually exposed after the buildup of other emotions such as jealousy and resentment. When a partner is suspicious of another’s intentions and actions they become frustrated with that partner and tend to <b>get</b> <b>angry</b> at them more easily and feel that the anger is not anticipated. In turn, the suspected unfaithful partner will be confused and become angry at the other starting fight. Anger is noticed to be a key emotion within a situation like infidelity, it takes on many roles and forms throughout the process but in the initial stage of cheating anger can be an affective emotion because of how unpredictable and rapid it can happen without thinking of one’s actions and feelings before doing so.|$|E

He highlighted the President's age, suggesting {{that he was too}} old for a seventh five-year term. Houphouët-Boigny countered by broadcasting television footage of his youth, and he was re-elected to a seventh term with 2,445,365 votes to 548,441—an implausible 81.7 percent of the vote.|$|E

500|$|At {{the same}} time, the world's media {{were quick to}} condemn Mansfield's stunts. One {{editorial}} columnist wrote, [...] "We are amused when Miss Mansfield strains to pull in her stomach to fill out her bikini better; but we <b>get</b> <b>angry</b> when career-seeking women, shady ladies, and certain starlets and actresses...use every opportunity to display their anatomy unasked". By the late 1950s, Mansfield began to generate {{a great deal of}} negative publicity because of repeated exposure of her breasts in carefully staged public [...] "accidents". Richard Blackwell, her wardrobe designer (who also designed for Jane Russell, Dorothy Lamour, Peggy Lee and Nancy Reagan), dropped her from his client list because of those accidents. In April 1967, Los Angeles Times wrote, [...] "She confuses publicity and notoriety with stardom and celebrity and the result is very distasteful to the public." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{large portion}} of the episode was based on the ancient {{astronaut}} theory, which proposes that intelligent extraterrestrial beings have visited Earth in antiquity or prehistory and made contact with humans. Frank Spotnitz later remarked that he was astounded at how little negative fan mail the show received, {{despite the fact that the}} [...] "Biogenesis"/"The Sixth Extinction"/"" [...] story arc heavily hinted that aliens were the originators of the notion of God and religion. He credited the manner in which the show handled this delicate subject, saying, [...] "Often in the past, we've done stuff where I was sure we would <b>get</b> <b>angry</b> letters. But we rarely do.

Rayner called his performance [...] "one of the all time great cameos," [...] and Jacobson called it [...] "fun." [...] Broadwater considered Lee's appearance {{to be one of the}} season's [...] "highlights," [...] and Total Films Nathan Ditum ranked Lee's performance as the 12th best guest appearance in the show's history, describing it as [...] "a deranged, childish and brilliant version of himself." ...|$|E

50|$|Akrodha is {{considered}} a virtue and desirable ethical value in Hinduism.

500|$|The {{portions}} of the episode about the alien shard and Mulder's telepathic abilities allude to the ancient astronaut theory, which proposes that intelligent extraterrestrial beings visited Earth and made contact with humans in antiquity or prehistory. Spotnitz was surprised that the show received few complaints, even though the [...] "Biogenesis"/"The Sixth Extinction"/"Amor Fati" [...] story arc heavily suggested that aliens developed the notions of God and religion. He praised {{the manner in which}} the show handled this subject, saying, [...] "Often in the past, we've done stuff where I was sure we would <b>get</b> <b>angry</b> letters. But we rarely do. And the reason is because of the way we handle things. In 'Amor Fati' we treated the religious side [...] with respect." [...] Spotnitz later identified the combination of science and religion as [...] "a conjunction of science and mysticism, of aliens and religion, that we're starting to develop. It's deliberate on our part, to help bring all the mythologies together into one story line." [...] The ancient astronaut themes were revisited in two season nine episodes: [...] "Provenance" [...] and [...] "Providence".|$|E
500|$|Vachss said [...] "writing is {{my way of}} preaching. For me, it's always, {{always the}} message. The plot is {{something}} I contrive to deliver the message. You've got to have enough narrative force {{to get people to}} finish the book, but if you can give them an exciting story, you can always make your points." [...] He stated that [...] "the whole point of the book is to raise awareness about the kiddie-sex tourism business in Thailand". Though the story uses more realism than the escapism typically associated with superhero fiction, Vachss did end the book with endorsements of two real non-profit groups; Don't! Buy! Thai! and End Child Prostitution in Asian Tourism. The writing is not subtle, as Vachss noted [...] "If you don't <b>get</b> <b>angry,</b> you're not going to do anything". Understanding that the likely readers were young males with short attention spans, Vachss tried to be dramatic by using what author Adam Begley calls [...] "a motivational hat trick: sympathy for the victims, revenge, and a family calling".|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Untitled (How Does It Feel)" [...] portrayed D'Angelo {{as a sex}} symbol to {{mainstream}} music audiences, which had repercussions on The Voodoo Tours second half. During the tour, female fans yelled out {{for him to take}} his clothes off, while others tossed clothes onto the stage. As trumpeter Roy Hargrove recounted, [...] "We couldn't get through one song before women would start to scream for him to take off something [...] It wasn't about the music. All they wanted him to do was take off his clothes." [...] This led to frustration and both onstage and offstage outbursts by D'Angelo, with him breaking stage equipment. Questlove later said, [...] "He'd <b>get</b> <b>angry</b> and start breaking shit. The audience thinking, 'Fuck your art, I wanna see your ass!', made him angry." [...] Although some were cancelled due to D'Angelo's throat infection during the tour's mid-March dates, many shows were cancelled due to his personal and emotional problems. D'Angelo chose on several occasions to not perform on scheduled dates, and delayed others to do physical workouts like stomach crunches. According to Questlove, three weeks worth of concert dates were cancelled, including two weeks worth of shows in Japan. He elaborated on the experience in a 2003 interview for The Believer, saying that: ...|$|E

500|$|On March 3, {{the jurors}} {{listened to the}} voice {{recordings}} having been provided with a transcript. The transcript had [...] "inaudible" [...] written {{on some of the}} excerpts because the conversations during Garza's meeting with Martínez, and during Martínez' meeting with Cisneros, were unclear. On the first recording, Garza met with Martínez under the pretext that the gunmen were requesting more money, and that the police instructed Garza to tell Martínez that Cisneros needed to pay an extra US$500. On the recordings, Martínez told Garza that she had no money and that Cisneros was out of town. Garza then told Martínez that the assassins were difficult to contact and he worried that if the payments were not made, they could <b>get</b> <b>angry.</b> Martínez then asked Garza what the assassins did with the car they used, and if they had worn gloves when they shot Fischer. After two more recordings between the pair, the Brownsville police arrested Martínez and had her meet with Cisneros. Early in the recording made with Cisneros, though unclear in some parts, she was recorded handing over something to Martínez and saying [...] "five," [...] referring to the US$500 the police confiscated from her during the arrest. She was also recorded asking Martínez if there was any proof that she had been involved in the murder.|$|E
500|$|Sam is a laid-back but enthusiastic, brown-coated {{anthropomorphic}} [...] "canine shamus". He wears {{either a}} gray or blue {{suit with a}} matching fedora, to make people more cooperative when conversing with a six-foot talking dog. A warped sense of justice makes Sam the more passionate of the pair for their police work, only held back from taking his job seriously by Max. Nevertheless, he enjoys the mannerisms and dress that come with their line of work. Sam possesses near encyclopedic amounts of knowledge, particularly on obscure topics, and is prone to long-winded sentences filled with elaborate terminology. Although he is always keen to display this information—regardless of its accuracy—Sam can be capable of total ignorance towards more practical matters; for instance, despite his regard for his DeSoto Adventurer, he is severely negligent with the car's maintenance. Sam still retains various doglike qualities: he is excitable, enthusiastic but also susceptible to emotions of embarrassment and guilt. Nevertheless, Sam is [...] "not above sticking {{his head out the}} car window and letting his tongue flap in the breeze". Sam rarely loses his temper, and is able to react to panic-inducing situations with extreme calm. When he does <b>get</b> <b>angry,</b> Sam tends to react in a violent, uncharacteristically savage manner, in which case it is usually Max that calms him down and prevents him from acting upon his anger. Sam usually is armed with an oversized [...]44 revolver.|$|E
500|$|In 1958 Terry-Thomas {{received}} {{the first of}} his two film award nominations, the BAFTA Award for the [...] "Best British Actor in 1959" [...] for the part of Ivan in the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film tom thumb. He later described the film as his second favourite; he appeared opposite Sellers for much of his screen time, and later said that [...] "my part was perfect, but Peter's was bloody awful. He wasn't difficult about it, but he knew it". Terry-Thomas was still suffering with poor health following the filming of The Naked Truth when he suffered an attack of lumbago; filming went on for 85days during 1957–58, and he took painkillers to enable him to continue. The role was physically demanding, and required him to ride a horse, run long distances and fight in a duel. He stated that he fought and ran [...] "just as [...] had seen Douglas Fairbanks Snr do in The Mark of Zorro". Towards the end of filming, Terry-Thomas went to a Christmas party at the Trocadero, where he drank champagne, as well as taking codeine tablets, and was subsequently arrested on suspicion of being drunk and disorderly. He considered the arresting policemen to have been rude, and [...] "their attitude made me extremely angry and when I <b>get</b> <b>angry...</b> I just go completely off my nut". The case came to court on 14 March 1958 and his legal team from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer provided a medical report which showed Terry-Thomas had been on a course of prescription painkillers due to a gruelling filming schedule; along with inconsistencies in the arresting policemen's notes, the case proved inconclusive and was dismissed. For {{much of the rest of}} 1958, Terry-Thomas appeared on stage at the London Palladium in Large as Life, alongside Harry Secombe, Eric Sykes and Hattie Jacques. He played one of the Three Musketeers in one sketch and had another turn called [...] "Filling the Gap"; the show ran for a total of 380performances between May and December 1958. He also released his first record, Strictly T-T, a collection of comic songs and sketches.|$|E
