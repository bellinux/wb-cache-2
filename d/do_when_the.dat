5|$|The NCMP {{scheme was}} {{introduced}} in 1984, and was a significant modification of the traditional Westminster system of government. Since the ruling People's Action Party had won all parliamentary seats in the four general elections since independence, Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew argued that the NCMP scheme would ensure that opposition voices would be heard in Parliament. According to him, this would be beneficial to Singapore as it would give the younger generation of Singaporeans {{a chance to see}} what an opposition can or cannot <b>do.</b> <b>When</b> <b>the</b> first constitutional amendment was made to initiate the NCMP scheme, between three and six NCMPs were allowed in Parliament. The Constitution was amended again in 2010 to allow for a maximum of nine NCMPs in Parliament.|$|E
25|$|The pre-parade segment {{today may}} include mass-displays, choir {{performances}}, school band displays, sky-diving displays, and other light-hearted performances {{to entertain the}} crowd prior to the parade proper, with the added positive effect of encouraging parade-attendees to be seated earlier. Initially introduced on an ad-hoc basis as an informal filler, it has since became {{an integral part of}} the parade particularly when live television coverage was extended to this segment in recent years. As audience participation has become a part of the parade, the pre-parade segment also becomes an opportunity for the hosts to lead and rehearse with the audience actions they may have to <b>do</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> parade proper begins.|$|E
25|$|Upon graduation, {{one of the}} {{following}} degrees is obtained, according to the university: Doctor of Medicine, or both Doctor of Medicine and Doctor of Surgery. Public universities usually confer both degrees, and private universities bestow only Doctor of Medicine. In daily practice, however, there is no substantial difference between what a Doctor of Medicine or a Doctor of Medicine and Doctor of Surgery are allowed to <b>do.</b> <b>When</b> <b>the</b> degree is obtained, a record is created for that new doctor in the index of the National Ministry of Education (Ministerio Nacional de Educación) and the physician is given their corresponding medical practitioner's ID, which is a number that identifies him and his academic achievements. In addition, there is a provincial ID, i. e. a number to identify doctors in the province they practise medicine in.|$|E

500|$|The Asiatic dayflower {{has been}} used in {{pollination}} studies concerning the behaviour of plants in relation to their pollinators. One important experiment tested the hypotheses that floral guides (i.e. various patterns and colours on anthers and petals) simultaneously promote pollinator visitation and prevent visits where the pollinator fails to come into contact with the stigma or anthers, termed pollen theft. As the flowers of the Asiatic dayflower lack nectar, they offer only pollen as a reward to their visitors. To attract pollinators, the plant has three types of brightly colored floral organs: the large blue petals, fertile yellow anthers, and infertile yellow antherodes that lack pollen. When the infertile antherodes were experimentally removed in natural populations, the number of total floral visitor landings was reduced, supporting the hypothesis that these infertile anthers essentially trick their pollinators into believing they offer more than they actually <b>do.</b> <b>When</b> <b>the</b> central, bright yellow fertile anther was removed, leaving only two brown fertile anthers, the frequency of legitimate flower landings decreased, meaning that the visitors were not pollinating the flowers, suggesting that floral signals also prevent [...] "theft", or visits where the pollinators take pollen, but do not place any on the stigma. Thus both the fertile anthers and the infertile antherodes were shown {{to play an important role}} in both increasing visitor landings and orienting floral visitors toward a landing point appropriate for pollination.|$|E

2500|$|Skateboarding, {{as we know}} it, was {{probably}} born sometime in the late 1940s, or early 1950s, when surfers in California wanted something to <b>do</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> waves were flat. This was called [...] "sidewalk surfing" [...] - {{a new wave of}} surfing on the sidewalk as the sport of surfing became highly popular. No one knows who made the first board; it seems that several people came up with similar ideas at around the same time. The first manufactured skateboards were ordered by a Los Angeles, California surf shop, meant to be used by surfers in their downtime. The shop owner, Bill Richard, made a deal with the Chicago Roller Skate Company to produce sets of skate wheels, which they attached to square wooden boards. Accordingly, skateboarding was originally denoted [...] "sidewalk surfing" [...] and early skaters emulated surfing style and maneuvers, and performed barefoot.|$|E

2500|$|The District of Columbia {{successfully}} opened W Street NW through cemetery {{land in a}} {{far less}} divisive way in 1907. [...] The effort to open the street began in January 1903, when the city decided to open W Street NW between 2nd Street NW and North Capitol Street. [...] This would have effectively divided the cemetery's land west of North Capitol Street into equal north and south portions. Congress, however, provided no funds to obtain {{the land and the}} city would not initiate eminent domain proceedings. Instead, the city requested that the land be donated, which the cemetery declined to <b>do.</b> <b>When</b> <b>the</b> city next raised the issue, a year later, the city's legal counsel said the land must be condemned because the cemetery's charter did not allow it to alienate land. Subsequently, a bill was introduced in Congress in February 1904 to pay Prospect Hill Cemetery $5,000 for the necessary land.|$|E
