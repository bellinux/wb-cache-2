Quick {{reaction}} forces (QRF) from 1st Battalion, 32nd Infantry Regiment did not reach the outpost until 7:00pm that day, while insurgents remained {{in parts of the}} outpost as late as 5:10pm.

Members of 10th Mountain Division’s 1-32 Infantry Regiment were air lifted to the nearest helicopter landing zone on OP Fritsche and arrived at approximately 1400 hrs, as recalled by a soldier on scene. After assisting with securing the OP from potential follow on attacks, members of the Quick Reaction Force descended from the mountain’s peak to COP Keating on foot. While in route the Platoon encountered a planned ambush on the side of the mountain resulting in three confirmed enemy KIA at approximately 1800 hrs. After dispensing with the enemy, QRF continued their descent and entered the outpost at approximately 1900 hrs. At such time the platoon cleared the remaining areas of the outpost which members of 3-61 had not yet retaken.

25|$|The {{additional}} obligations imposed by European law on national border authorities {{when it comes}} to processing travellers who are third-country nationals (e.g. the obligation to stamp their travel documents) should not prevent the development of automated border control systems which are made available to such travellers. As shown by the examples listed above of automated border control systems which have been developed at external border crossing points of the Schengen Area, national border authorities have been able to adapt the design of their automated border control systems to allow third-country nationals to make use of them. One solution is to have a border guard physically positioned next to the automated border gates who can stamp travel documents where required: this approach has been adopted by the Finnish Border Guard at the automated border gates in Helsinki Airport, where eligible users (who are required to receive a passport stamp) include holders of Australian, Canadian, Japanese, New Zealand, South Korean and United States biometric passports, {{as well as by the}} Portuguese Serviço de Estrangeiros e Fronteiras at the automated border gates in Lisbon Airport where eligible users (who are required to receive a passport stamp) include holders of Angolan and Brazilian passports and holders of diplomatic/service passports. A similar but slightly different solution has been adopted by the Dutch Royal Marechaussee at the Privium iris recognition automated border gates at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport (where eligible users include registered EU/EEA/Swiss citizens, US citizens who are Global <b>Entry</b> <b>members,</b> and all nationals who are holders of diplomatic passports), as well as by the German Federal Police at the ABG Plus iris recognition automated border gates at Frankfurt Airport (where eligible users include registered EU/EEA/Swiss citizens and US citizens who are Global Entry members): when eligible third-country nationals use Privium/ABG Plus, after their iris is scanned and verified, a different gate opens to that for EU/EEA/Swiss citizens and the third-country national is directed to a lane which leads them to the front of the queue for manual passport checks at immigration desks, where the border officer stamps the user's passport. Another possible solution would be to design the automated border gates to print a paper slip with an entry or exit stamp on it, as well as the traveller's name and travel document number, whenever the user is a traveller who is subject to the requirement to have his or her travel document stamped. At the Port of Helsinki, the Finnish Border Guard has adapted the design of the automated border gates there to widen eligibility to include Russian citizens (who, as Annex I nationals, are required to have a visa) by requiring them to scan both the biodata page and the visa inside their passport, then to step into the gate for a facial image and fingerprint recognition, and after the gate opens to approach a border officer to have their passport stamped.|$|E

40|$|This {{exploratory}} study provides {{a review of}} the neglected area of entrepreneurial founder team turnover. A novel distinction is made between entrepreneurial founder team <b>member</b> <b>entry</b> and team <b>member</b> exit. Ninety owner-managed ventures were monitored between 1990 and 2000. Presented hypotheses relating to a team's human capital were explored using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Variables associated with entry were found not to be the same as those associated with exit. The size of the founding team was significantly negatively associated with subsequent team <b>member</b> <b>entry.</b> The link between team turnover and entrepreneurial team heterogeneity was mixed. Functional heterogeneity was weakly significantly positively associated with team <b>member</b> <b>entry.</b> Heterogeneity of prior entrepreneurial experience was significantly positively associated with team member exit. In addition, family firms were significantly negatively associated with team member exit. The average age of the team was not significantly associated with team <b>member</b> <b>entry</b> or exit. Additional insights in future research may be gathered if a broader definition of team turnover (i. e., considering team <b>member</b> <b>entry</b> and exit) is considered. Practitioner awareness of the different factors associated with team <b>member</b> <b>entry</b> and exit may encourage them to provide assistance, which facilitates the team building process over time in developing firms. Promising areas for additional research are highlighted...|$|R

50|$|The {{years after}} the 1920 {{election}} witnessed major developments at the national level. Gandhi and his followers including C. Rajagopalachari strongly believed in Congress not participating in the elections. However, Chittaranjan Das (C. R. Das), Motilal Nehru and few others encouraged Congress participation in election. The party passed a resolution on 7 September 1922 to allow its members to stand as candidates {{and participate in the}} elections. C. R. Das's attempt to move a resolution advocating active participation in elections, at the Congress meeting held in Gaya in December 1922 after the imprisonment of Gandhi failed. Soon afterwards, C. R. Das and his followers formed Swaraj Party on January 1, 1923. Their platform included fighting the elections and participating in the elections and continue non-cooperation from within the diarchy. However, they did not secede from Congress and remained as a Pressure group within the Congress. After much debate between the pro- and anti-Council <b>entry</b> <b>members</b> within the Congress, a special meeting held in late September 1923 in Delhi authorised willing Congressmen to participate in elections while reinstating its commitment to non-cooperation. Rajagopalachari who did not attend the meeting expressed his support for Council entry. Despite his national support for Council entry, he continued working against it in Tamil Nadu. After Gandhi was released from Jail in February 1924, he was willing to accommodate the Swarajists in the Congress fold while expressing dislike for Council entry. He advised Rajaji also to follow a similar course in Madras and it was not until 1925 Rajaji publicly accepted Gandhi's advice.S. Srinivasa Iyengar joined the Swarajists and became the leader of the party machinery for the Madras Presidency.|$|E

40|$|The {{transient}} receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV 1) {{channel protein}} is activated by lipid metabolites synthesized in the cytosol of nociceptors {{in response to}} noxious stimulation. Lipid species include the endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA) and the linoleic acid metabolite 13 (S) hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (HODE) which act as endogenous TRPV 1 ligands (endovanilloids) by evoking TRPV 1 mediated Ca 2 + <b>entry.</b> <b>Members</b> of the fatty acid binding protein (FABP) family have been widely reported to act as intracellular lipid binding proteins for hydrophobic lipid species in aqueous cytosolic environments. The aim of this thesis was to identify which FABP isotypes could solubilize then shuttle AEA and 13 (S) HODE to TRPV 1 during nociception. Inhibiting FABP mediated transportation of endovanilloids could represent an alternative approach to analgesia by indirectly antagonizing TRPV 1 activity during nociception while avoiding the widely reported negative side effects of direct antagonism. For the first time, {{it was found that}} FABP isoforms 5, 7 and 8 were expressed in rat dorsal root ganglia cell preparations. Furthermore, subsequent cell free competitive binding assays confirmed that FABP 5, 7 and 8 could all physically bind to AEA and 13 (S) HODE albeit with variable affinities. The ability of FABP 5, 7 and 8 to physically associate with TRPV 1 and therefore deliver AEA was then assessed in live mammalian cell lines transfected with plasmid DNA constructs expressing recombinant TRPV 1 and FABPs. Physical interactions between TRPV 1 and FABP 5, 7 and 8 were observed in COS- 7 cells examined by fluorescence microscopy. However, when increases in intracellular Ca 2 + levels were measured in COS- 7 cells co-expressing TRPV 1 and FABP, in response to treatment with 1 µM AEA, the magnitude of AEA evoked Ca 2 + influxes were not significantly different to those observed in COS- 7 cells not co-expressing the FABPs. This suggested that the FABPs did not functionally associate with TRPV 1 and did not deliver AEA to TRPV 1 receptors. In conclusion, data in thesis showed that the FABP isoforms expressed in DRG cell preparations could physically associate with lipid species reported to activate TRPV 1 during nociception...|$|E
