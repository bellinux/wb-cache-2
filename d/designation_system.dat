5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the {{airplane}} was officially retired and had not flown since 1957, at least one F2Y was still in storage as of 1962. As a result, it was redesignated YF-7A under the 1962 United States Tri-Service aircraft <b>designation</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
5|$|In late 1934, the U.S. Navy's Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) {{issued a}} {{specification}} for new scout bomber and torpedo bomber designs. Eight companies submitted {{a total of}} ten designs in response, evenly split between monoplanes and biplanes. The Hall Aluminum Aircraft Company submitted the only seaplane design; a single prototype was ordered by the Navy for evaluation on June 30, 1934. Given the designation XPTBH-1, it became the only aircraft to receive three mission-type letters under the U.S. Navy's <b>designation</b> <b>system</b> used between 1922 and 1962.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the revolutionary}} {{features}} of the Apache was its helmet mounted display, the Integrated Helmet and Display Sighting System (IHADSS); among its capabilities, either the pilot or gunner can slave the helicopter's 30mm automatic M230 Chain Gun to their helmet, making the gun track head movements to point where they look. The M230E1 can be alternatively fixed to a locked forward firing position, or controlled via the Target Acquisition and <b>Designation</b> <b>System</b> (TADS). On more modern AH-64s, the TADS/PNVS {{has been replaced by}} Lockheed Martin's Arrowhead (MTADS) targeting system.|$|E

5|$|Upon commissioning, Taylor joined Destroyer Division 12 of the Atlantic Fleet. She cruised {{with that}} fleet during World War I but saw no action. Following {{the war on}} 1 April 1919, she was {{assigned}} to Destroyer Division 8. In 1920, Taylor was placed in reduced commission though still operating on the Atlantic coast. That summer, on 17 July, the Navy adopted the alpha-numeric hull <b>designation</b> <b>system,</b> and Taylor became DD-94. In October, she was placed back in full commission and, until the summer of 1922, operated with Destroyer Division 8, Flotilla 8, Squadron 3. On 21 June 1922, the ship was placed out of commission at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|Phase two {{was broken}} into four {{separate}} sections, phase 2.1 {{is for a}} radar upgrade, phase 2.2 incorporated a link 16 secure data link, Multi-function Information Distribution System (MIDS), Cockpit full colour displays (MDGU), Counter Measures Dispenser System (CMDS), Joint Helmet Mounted Cuing System (JHMCS), Tactical Air Moving Map Capability (TAMMAC), and the 19C Operational Flight Program. Phase 2.3 added the Electronic Warfare suite upgrade (Radar Warning Receiver, Radio Frequency Jammer) and phase 2.4 upgraded with the Target <b>Designation</b> <b>System</b> (HTDS). The following support systems will also be either upgraded or replaced, the Operational Flight Trainer (OFT) {{to be replaced by}} the Hornet Aircrew Training System (HACTS), the Integrated Avionics Software Support Facility (IASSF), the Mission Planning System (MPS), Miscellaneous Support Equipment (SE), Computer Based Training System (CBTS), Simulated Aircraft Maintenance Training System (SAMTS) to be replaced by the Integrated Maintenance Training System (IMTS).|$|E
