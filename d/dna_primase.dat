50|$|In eukaryotes, MCM heterohexamer is {{phosphorylated}} by CDC7 and CDK, which displaces Cdc6 and recruits MCM10. MCM10 cooperates with MCM2-7 in {{the recruitment}} of Cdc45.

40|$|Two major {{pathways}} of recombination-dependent DNA replication, “join-copy” and “join-cut-copy,” can {{be distinguished}} in phage T 4 : join-copy requires only early and middle genes, but two late proteins, endonuclease VII and terminase, are uniquely important in the join-cut-copy pathway. In wild-type T 4, timing of these pathways is integrated with the developmental program and related to transcription and packaging of <b>DNA.</b> In <b>primase</b> mutants, which are defective in origin-dependent lagging-strand DNA synthesis, the late pathway can bypass the lack of primers for lagging-strand DNA synthesis. The exquisitely regulated synthesis of endo VII, and of two proteins from its gene, explains the delay of recombination-dependent <b>DNA</b> replication in <b>primase</b> (as well as topoisomerase) mutants, and the temperature-dependence of the delay. Other proteins (e. g., the single-stranded DNA binding protein and the products of genes 46 and 47) are important in all recombination pathways, but they interact differently with other proteins in different pathways. These homologous recombination pathways contribute to evolution because they facilitate acquisition of any foreign DNA with limited sequence homology during horizontal gene transfer, without requiring transposition or site-specific recombination functions. Partial heteroduplex repair can generate {{what appears to be}} multiple mutations from a single recombinational intermediate. The resulting sequence divergence generates barriers to formation of viable recombinants. The multiple sequence changes can also lead to erroneous estimates in phylogenetic analyses...|$|R

Of the genes showing homologs (47 %), we identified those involved in host DNA degradation (three endonucleases) and T 1 replication (<b>DNA</b> helicase, <b>primase,</b> and single-stranded DNA-binding proteins) and recombination (RecE and Erf homologs). While the tail genes showed homology to those from temperate coliphage N 15, the capsid biosynthetic genes were unique.

5000|$|DnaG is a {{bacterial}} <b>DNA</b> <b>primase</b> and is encoded by the dnaG gene. The enzyme DnaG, {{and any other}} <b>DNA</b> <b>primase,</b> synthesizes short strands of RNA known as oligonucleotides during DNA replication. These oligonucleotides are known as primers because they act {{as a starting point}} for DNA synthesis. DnaG catalyzes the synthesis of oligonucleotides that are 10 to 60 nucleotides (the fundamental unit of DNA and RNA) long, however most of the oligonucleotides synthesized are 11 nucleotides. [...] These RNA oligonucleotides serve as primers, or starting points, for DNA synthesis by bacterial DNA polymerase III (Pol III). DnaG is important in bacterial DNA replication because DNA polymerase cannot initiate the synthesis of a DNA strand, but can only add nucleotides to a preexisting strand. [...] DnaG synthesizes a single RNA primer at the origin of replication. This primer serves to prime leading strand DNA synthesis. For the other parental strand, the lagging strand, DnaG synthesizes an RNA primer every few kilobases (kb). These primers serve as substrates for the synthesis of Okazaki fragments.|$|E

40|$|Within replisomes for DNA replication, the {{primosome}} {{is responsible}} for unwinding double-stranded DNA and synthesizing RNA primers. Assembly of the bacteriophage T 4 primosome on individual molecules of ssDNA or forked DNA (fDNA) has been studied by using FRET microscopy. On either DNA substrate, an ordered process of assembly begins with tight 1 : 1 binding of ssDNA-binding protein (gp 32) and helicase-loading protein (gp 59) to the DNA. Magnesium adenosine 5 ′-O-(3 -thiotriphosphate) (MgATPγS) mediates the weak binding of helicase (gp 41) to DNA coated with gp 32 and gp 59, whereas MgATP induces gp 32 and gp 59 to dissociate, leaving gp 41 bound to the <b>DNA.</b> Finally, <b>primase</b> (gp 61) binds to the gp 41 ·DNA complex. Ensemble studies {{were used to determine}} protein stoichiometries and binding constants. These single-molecule studies provide an unambiguous description of the pathway for assembly of the primosome on the lagging strand of DNA at a replication fork...|$|R
40|$|Initiation of DNA {{replication}} involves three sequential steps. First, one or {{more specific}} trans-acting proteins bind to specific cis-acting DNA se-quences referred to as origins of replication (DePamphilis 1993 a,b; Kornberg and Baker 1992). Second, DNA unwinding of the two comple-mentary templates begins. This step is usually carried out by a DNA heli-case but can also be done by some DNA polymerases (e. g., adenovirus [Ad]). DNA unwinding is facilitated by single-strand-specific DNA-binding proteins such as replication protein A (RP-A), which coat the templates, and by topoisomerase I, which releases torsional stress gener-ated by unwinding DNA. Third, DNA synthesis is initiated on one or both templates. In cellular chromosomes and DNA viruses that do not encode their own DNA polymerase (e. g., SV 40, PyV, and PV), <b>DNA</b> polymerase-a:DNA <b>primase</b> complex synthesizes a short RNA-primed nascent DNA chain referred to as an Okazaki fragment.

50|$|PrimPol is a <b>DNA</b> <b>primase</b> and DNA {{polymerase}} {{involved in}} DNA replication. Unlike the other known DNA polymerases, PrimPol can initiate replication {{without the need}} of an RNA primer and can extend from primers produced by PrimPol. PrimPol preferentially initiates replication using deoxynucleotides, rather than ribonucleotides and will only extend from a nascent DNA chain using deoxynucleotides. PrimPol exhibits a 1000-fold bias towards Watson-Crick base pairing when extending DNA chains. PrimPol plays an as yet unidentified role in unperturbed replication, PrimPol depleted cells slow replication fork progression, proliferate slower and show an increased RPA foci.|$|E
5000|$|<b>DNA</b> <b>primase</b> is {{an enzyme}} {{involved}} in the replication of DNA and {{is a type of}} DNA polymerase. Primase catalyzes the synthesis of a short RNA (or DNA in some organisms [...] ) segment called a primer complementary to a ssDNA template. Primase is of key importance in DNA replication because no known replicative DNA polymerases can initiate the synthesis of a DNA strand without an initial PNA or CNA primer (for temporary DNA elongation). After this elongation the RNA piece is removed by a 3' to 5' exonuclease and refilled with DNA.|$|E
50|$|The {{replication}} of the kinetoplast occurs simultaneously to the duplication of the adjacent flagellum and {{just prior to}} the nuclear DNA replication. In a traditional Crithidia fasciculata kDNA network, initiation of replication is promoted by the unlinking of kDNA minicircles via topoisomerase II. The free minicircles are released into a region between the kinetoplast and the mitochondrial membrane called the kinetoflagellar zone (KFZ). After replication the minicircles migrate by unknown mechanisms to the antipodal protein complexes that contain several replication proteins including an endonuclease, helicase, DNA polymerase, <b>DNA</b> <b>primase,</b> and DNA ligase, which initiate repair of remaining discontinuities in the newly replicated minicircles.|$|E
40|$|Coats plus is {{a highly}} {{pleiotropic}} disorder particularly affecting the eye, brain, bone and gastrointestinal tract. Here, we show that Coats plus results from mutations in CTC 1, encoding conserved telomere maintenance component 1, {{a member of the}} mammalian homolog of the yeast heterotrimeric CST telomeric capping complex. Consistent with the observation of shortened telomeres in an Arabidopsis CTC 1 mutant and the phenotypic overlap of Coats plus with the telomeric maintenance disorders comprising dyskeratosis congenita, we observed shortened telomeres in three individuals with Coats plus and an increase in spontaneous ?H 2 AX-positive cells in cell lines derived from two affected individuals. CTC 1 is also a subunit of the ?-accessory factor (AAF) complex, stimulating the activity of <b>DNA</b> polymerase-? <b>primase,</b> the only enzyme known to initiate DNA replication in eukaryotic cells.

40|$|DNA {{replication}} is {{a crucial}} stage in the transfer of genetic information from parent to daughter cells. This mechanism involves multiple proteins with one key player being the primase. Primases are single-stranded DNA dependent RNA polymerases. On the leading strand, they synthesize the primer once allowing DNA elongation while on the lagging strand primers are generated repeatedly (Okazaki fragments). Primases have the unique ability to create the first phosphodiester bond yielding a dinucleotide which is initially elongated by primases and then by <b>DNA</b> polymerases. <b>Primase</b> activity has been studied in the last decades but the detailed molecular steps explaining some unique features remain unclear. High-resolution structures of free and bound primases domains have brought significant insights {{in the understanding of}} the primase reaction cycle. Here, we give a short review of the structural work conducted in the field of archaeo-eukaryotic primases and we underline the missing “pictures” of the active forms of the enzyme which are of major interest.

50|$|The zinc-binding domain, {{the domain}} {{responsible}} for recognizing sequence specific DNA binding sites, is conserved across all viral, bacteriophage, prokaryotic and eukaryotic <b>DNA</b> primases. The <b>primase</b> zinc-binding domain {{is part of}} the subfamily of zinc-binding domains known as the zinc ribbon. Zinc ribbon domains are characterized by two β-hairpin loops which form the zinc-binding domain. Typically, zinc ribbon domains are thought to lack α-helices, distinguishing them from other zinc-binding domains. However, in 2000 DnaG’s zinc-binding domain was crystallized from Bacillus stearothermophilus revealing that the domain consisted of a five stranded antiparallel β sheet adjacent to four α helices and a 310 helix on the c-terminal end of the domain.|$|R
50|$|The {{relatively}} small number of primase inhibitors likely reflects the inherent difficulty of primase assays rather than a lack of potential binding sites on the enzyme. The short length of products synthesized and the generally slow rate of the enzyme compared to other replication enzymes make developing high-throughput screening (HTS) approaches more difficult. Despite the difficulties, there are several known inhibitors of DnaG that are not NTP analogues. Doxorubicin and suramin are both DNA and NTP competitive inhibitors of Mycobacterium Tuberculosis DnaG. Suramin is also known to inhibit eukaryotic <b>DNA</b> <b>primase</b> by competing with GTP, so suramin is likely to inhibit DnaG via a similar mechanism.|$|E

It has an icosahedral capsid (T=16) which consists of 150 hexons and 12 pentons, formed from 6 proteins. The envelope is loose around the viral capsid and contains at least 10 glycoproteins which are critical for adsorption and penetration into host cells. The tegument containing at least 14 viral proteins lies between the capsid and the envelope. The tegument proteins are involved in nucleic acid metabolism, DNA synthesis and processing of proteins. The proteins in the tegument are thymidine kinase, thymidylate synthetase, dUTPase, ribonuclease reductase, DNA polymerase, DNA Helicase, <b>DNA</b> <b>Primase</b> and Protein Kinases.|$|E

Obg protein interacts with several regulators (RsbT, RsbW, RsbX) necessary for the stress activation of sigma B.|$|E
40|$|<b>DNA</b> helicase and <b>primase</b> are {{essential}} for DNA replication. The helicase unwinds the DNA to provide single-stranded templates for <b>DNA</b> polymerase. The <b>primase</b> catalyzes the synthesis of oligoribonucleotides for the initiation of lagging strand synthesis. The two activities reside in a single polypeptide encoded by gene 4 of bacteriophage T 7. Their coexistence within the same polypeptide facilitates their coordination during DNA replication. One surface of helix E within the helicase domain is positioned {{to interact with the}} primase domain and the linker connecting the two domains within the functional hexamer. The interaction occurs in trans such that helix E interacts with the primase domain and the linker of the adjacent subunit. Most alterations of residues on the surface of helix E (Arg 404, Lys 408, Tyr 411, and Gly 415) eliminate the ability of the altered proteins to complement growth of T 7 phage lacking gene 4. Both Tyr 411 and Gly 415 are important in oligomerization of the protein. Alterations G 415 V and K 408 A simultaneously influence helicase and primase activities in opposite manners that mimic events observed during coordinated DNA synthesis. The results suggest that Asp 263 located in the linker of one subunit can interact with Tyr 411, Lys 408, or Arg 404 in helix E of the adjacent subunit depending on the oligomerization state. Thus the switch in contacts between Asp 263 and its three interacting residues in helix E of the adjacent subunit results in conformational changes that modulate helicase and primase activity...|$|R

Each of the 4 -quinolones, when present in amounts of more than 100 micrograms/ml, reversibly inhibited the DNA synthesis performed by the 95 <b>DNA</b> polymerase alpha <b>primase</b> complex from calf thymus.

The antimicrobial agents did not significantly increase the frequencies of base pairing mismatches during the course of replication, indicating that the basal mutation rate is not affected by novobiocin and the 4 -quinolones. The Ki values of 50 % inhibition of DNA topoisomerases from calf thymus by ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, novobiocin, nalidixic acid, and ofloxacin were 300, 400, 1, 000 or more, 1, 000 or more, and 1, 500 or more micrograms/ml, respectively, in the case of topoisomerase I, and the Ki values were 150, 300, 500, 1, 000, and 1, 300 micrograms/ml, respectively, in the case of topoisomerase II. The procaryotic topoisomerase II is approximately 100 -fold more sensitive to inhibition by ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and ofloxacin than is its eucaryotic counterpart. Growth curves of lymphoblasts were recorded in the presence of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Neither 1 nor 10 micrograms of ciprofloxacin or of ofloxacin per ml affected cell proliferation. Ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin at 100 micrograms/ml inhibited cell growth; 1, 000 micrograms/ml led to cell death.
