40|$|<b>Monetary</b> <b>aggregates</b> {{continue}} {{to play an important}} role in the ECB''s policy strategy. This paper revisits the case for money, surveying the ongoing theoretical and empirical debate. The key conclusion is that an exclusive focus on non-monetary factors alone may leave the ECB with an incomplete picture of the economy. However, treating monetary factors as a separate matter is a second-best solution. Instead, a general-equilibrium inspired analytical framework that merges the economic and monetary "pillars" of the ECB''s policy strategy appears the most promising way forward. The role played by <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates</b> in such unified framework may be rather limited. However, an integrated framework would facilitate the presentation of policy decisions by providing a clearer narrative of the relative role of money in the interaction with other economic and financial sector variables, including asset prices, and their impact on consumer prices.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of monetary policy in achieving its macroeconomic objectives such as price stability {{and economic growth}} depend on the monetary policy tools that are implemented by the Central Bank. <b>Monetary</b> <b>aggregates</b> {{are one of the}} tools that have been used as indicators of economic activity and as intermediate targets to achieve these economic objectives. Until recently, <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates</b> have been questioned and criticised on their usefulness in monetary policy.

This study investigates the relevance of monetary aggregation by comparing the traditional simple sum and Divisia index <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates</b> which was constructed for the first time for South Africa using the Tornquist-Theil method.

Overall, the study found a very strong relationship between inflation and all the <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates.</b> However, more specifically the results suggested that the Divisia indices are superior to the simple sum in terms of predicting inflation. The evidence further suggests that the Divisia aggregates provide higher information about inflation than the simple sum aggregates.

40|$|Money {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the economic health of a nation. The amount of money in the economy matters because it affects real variables (output, employment) and/or nominal variables (price level). Monetarist view suggests that a target growth rate for a narrow definition of money be set so that a stable (and low) rate of inflation could be achieved. This is possible if the demand for money is stable and changes in the monetary base have a predictable impact on money supply. Therefore, the performance of a <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregate</b> is examined through a money demand specification and/or as an effective monetary target in the conduct of monetary policy. ^ Empirical work in the 1970 s showed that broad <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates</b> like M 2 were closely correlated with such potential policy target variables as output, unemployment and inflation. Several countries such as Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States declared <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates</b> as <b>intermediate</b> targets. By mid- 1980 s however, the stability of money demand relationship was questioned and the target growth rates of <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates</b> became unpredictable. <b>Monetary</b> authorities were forced to abandon monetary targeting or monitor <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates</b> as economic policy indicators along with other variables like inflation and interest rates. The poor performance of <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates</b> and the instability of money demand functions were attributed to financial innovations, inadequate econometric methodology and restrictive conventional framework of the analysis. ^ Under such circumstances, Barnett (1980) suggested the microfoundations approach and his subsequent work has shown that weighted <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates</b> could outperform simple-sum <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates.</b> The theoretical framework of the microfoundations approach derives from monetary aggregation theory and statistical index numbers. This approach constructs new <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates</b> and compares their performance with simple-sum <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates.</b> ^ This dissertation empirically investigates the microfoundations approach for four of the G- 7 countries (Germany, Japan, United Kingdom and United States) and a developing country (Turkey), using, cointegration analysis, stability test and Granger-causality.

40|$|We apply wavelet {{analysis}} {{to compare the}} relationship between simple sum and Divisa <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates</b> with real GDP and CPI infl ation for the U. S. using data from 1967 to 2013. Wavelet analysis allows to account for variations in the relationships both across the frequency spectrum and across time. While we find evidence for a weaker comovement of Divisia compared to simple sum <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates</b> with real GDP the relationship between money growth and infl ation {{is estimated to be}} much tighter between Divisia <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates</b> and CPI infl ation than for simple sum aggregates, in particular at lower frequencies. Furthermore, for the Divisia indices for broader <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates</b> (M 2, M 2 M, MZM) we estimate a stable lead before CPI in flation of about four to five years...|$|R

The author expresses her thanks to Steven Morling and Caroline This paper examines the relationship between selected <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates</b> and inflation and output. Simple correlation coefficients and Granger causality tests under a VAR framework were used to discover the leading or lagging role of the <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates.</b> In addition, the information provided by the <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates</b> as predictors of output and inflation was examined. This was assessed by examining their predictive power for subsequent observations on an in-sample basis. Overall, the results indicated a lack of robustness in the relationship between the <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates</b> and the economic activity variables, as Since the 1980 s, the traditional relationship between money an...|$|R
