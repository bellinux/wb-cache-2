50|$|A similar implement, {{the foot}} press or <b>foot</b> <b>screw,</b> {{consisted}} {{of a pair of}} horizontal iron plates slowly tightened around the bare foot by means of a crank mechanism to crush the bones. Although it was quite standard to line the lower plate with ribs to prevent the foot from popping out of the grip of the instrument as it became sweatier, a crueler variant of this device - typically encountered in Nuremberg, Germany - lined the upper plate with hundreds of sharp spikes. A version from Venice, sometimes called the <b>foot</b> <b>screw</b> or toe breaker, connected the crank mechanism to a drill that slowly mutilated the foot by boring a hole {{through the center of the}} instep as the press was tightened. The instrument was of sufficient power and cruelty to pulverize the tiniest of toe bones.|$|E

30|$|Among the {{patients}} with FFF treated with SESA in our study, the clinical and X-ray studies during the follow-up period show good outcomes in approximately 94  % of patients, even after screw removal. Our X-ray measurements show a greater {{improvement of the}} Costa-Bartani and talar inclination angles than of the calcaneal pitch angle, {{probably due to the}} site of correction, i.e. the subtalar joint. The average follow-up was 4.5  years, and, at the time of evaluation all our patients had reached complete foot skeletal maturity and had no recurrence of the deformity. We evaluated the outcome in 121 <b>feet</b> after <b>screw</b> removal, which occurred on average 2.9  years post-SESA. The data collected after screw removal show similar pre- and post-operative values of the Costa-Bartani and talar inclination angles, which, however, are improved with respect to the measurements post-SESA. Interestingly, the calcaneal pitch angle at screw removal, in contrast to the immediate post-SESA period, did improve, although in a statistically nonsignificant manner. This result may be explained by the calcaneus progressive correction after the improvement of the talo-calcaneal relationship at the subtalar joint and demonstrates that the correction obtained with SESA is effective, progressive and maintained.|$|R
50|$|This was, essentially, a 706 {{base with}} a {{modified}} chassis and case.

60|$|The {{engines and}} boilers are of immense power and magnitude. There are both screw and paddle engines, the former being capable of working up to 6500 horse-power, {{the latter to}} 5000. There are ten boilers and one hundred and twelve furnaces. The paddle engines, which were made by Messrs. Scott Russell and Company, stand nearly 40 feet high. Each {{cylinder}} weighs about 28 tons, and each paddle-wheel is 58 feet in diameter, or considerably larger than the ring in Astley's Circus. The screw engines were manufactured by Messrs. Watt and Company of Birmingham. They consist of four cylinders of 84 inches diameter and 4 <b>feet</b> stroke. The <b>screw</b> propeller is 24 feet in diameter and 37 feet pitch; and the engine-shaft is 160 feet long, or 12 feet longer than {{the height of the}} Duke of York's Column.

5000|$|To keep time accurately, {{pendulum}} clocks must {{be absolutely}} level. If they are not, the pendulum swings more {{to one side}} than the other, upsetting the symmetrical operation of the escapement. This condition can often be heard audibly in the ticking sound of the clock. The ticks or [...] "beats" [...] should be at precisely equally spaced intervals to give a sound of, [...] "tick...tock...tick...tock"; if they are not, and have the sound [...] "tick-tock...tick-tock..."

A spirit level or watch timing machine can achieve a higher accuracy than relying on the sound of the beat; precision regulators often have a built in spirit level for the task. Older freestanding clocks often have <b>feet</b> with adjustable <b>screws</b> to level them, more recent ones have a leveling adjustment in the movement.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Favorable to {{excellent}} clinical {{results have}} been reported for isolated subtalar joint arthrodesis. Pedobarography after subtalar bone-block distraction arthrodesis have demonstrated a more laterally shifted gait line. However pedobarographic measurements after primary in-situ isolated subtalar arthrodesis have not been reported. This is the first study considering this. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Physical examination, AOFAS Hindfoot score, full weightbearing anterior/posterior and lateral radiographs were assessed in 15 feet. Peak pressures, ground reaction force and force distribution at foot-flat and push-off were measured. RESULTS: Average AOFAS-Score significantly improved. Subjective satisfaction was high. Non-union was found in 1 <b>foot</b> (7 %), <b>screws</b> were removed in 4 of the 15 feet (27 %). One new asymptomatic arthritic talonavicular joint was found. The pressure and force distributions under the operated and contralateral foot showed a different pattern compared to a normal foot. Ground reaction force under both the operated and contralateral feet were lower than a normal foot. DISCUSSION: This study found good clinical, subjective and radiographic results matching that of the reported literature. However, pedobarographic assessment suggests that great functional differences still remain when compared to a normal foot. Subtalar arthrodesis may induce an abnormal gait pattern by preventing compensation of axial rotation of the tibia. This is also reflected in the unaffected side, which may indicate an effort in the general locomotor control to keep a symmetrical gait pattern. This finally alters the pressure and force distribution under both feet. Nevertheless, subtalar arthrodesis is considered a valuable treatment for various isolated subtalar disorders...|$|R
40|$|This is an author's peer-reviewed final manuscript, as {{accepted}} by the publisher. The published article is copyrighted by Crop Science Society of America {{and can be found}} at: [URL] simulators are often utilized when researching turfgrass wear tolerance and recovery. However, the availability of a durable traffic simulator capable of producing dynamic force is limited. Therefore, the objectives of this research were to: 1) evaluate a novel traffic simulator with improved durability and capable of producing dynamic force and 2) evaluate the bio-physical effects of the traffic simulator on a native soil turfgrass system. The Baldree Traffic Simulator is a modified Ryan GA 30 riding aerification unit, equipped with fabricated, spring loaded steel plate <b>feet</b> studded with <b>screw</b> in cleats. The effects of this unit on a ‘Tifway’ bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon [L. ] Pers. × C. transvaalensis Burtt-Davy) system established on a Tifton loamy sand (Fine-loamy, kaolinitic, thermic Plinthic Kandiudults) were evaluated at the Coastal Plains Experiment Station, Tifton, GA. Factors included location (1 and 2) and traffic rate (0, 12 and 24 passes applied over a 6 week period). Field data included soil bulk density, turf density, and percent green turf cover. An in-ground force plate at the McPhail Equine Performance Center, East Lansing, MI was used to quantify vertical and net shear ground reaction force produced by the Baldree traffic simulator when operated in the forward and backward direction. The Baldree traffic simulator produced more cleat marks per pass than the Brinkman and Cady traffic simulators, as well as vertical force values comparable to that of a trotting horse. At the low traffic rate the Baldree traffic simulator increased soil bulk density, while turf density, percent green turf cover and vegetative indices decreased, therefore, the tool can be used to simulate heavy traffic conditions with a minimum number of passes...|$|R
