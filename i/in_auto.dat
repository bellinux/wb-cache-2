5|$|The Indianapolis Motor Speedway complex {{was built}} in 1909, inaugurating {{a new era in}} history. Most Indiana cities within 200 miles of Detroit became part of the giant {{automobile}} industry after 1910. The Indianapolis speedway was a venue for auto companies to show off their products. The Indianapolis 500 quickly became the standard <b>in</b> <b>auto</b> racing as European and American companies competed to build the fastest automobile and win at the track. Industrial and technological industries thrived during this era, George Kingston developed an early carburetor in 1902; in 1912, Elwood Haynes received a patent for stainless steel.|$|E

40|$|This paper first {{assesses the}} costs of the US-Japan <b>auto</b> VER <b>in</b> a general {{equilibrium}} constant returns to scale (CRTS) model at about $ 10 billion.

In the preferred monopolistic competition, initial profit model, the estimated costs are about 10 % less than under the assumption of CRTS, but costs remain high at over $ 200 000 per job protected <b>in</b> <b>autos.</b> Compared with exogenous rent determination, endogenous rent determination results in significantly lower estimated costs of the VER because domestic entry reduces the rent premium.

50|$|In {{addition}} to increasing militancy and revolutionary consciousness in the Black working class movement, {{the conditions of}} the trade union movement in Detroit, and particularly <b>in</b> the <b>auto</b> industry, {{played a significant role in}} the creation of the LRBW.

While there was a union <b>in</b> the <b>auto</b> industry, the United Auto Workers (UAW), most Black workers felt alienated from the union’s majority white leadership and perceived the union in the same vein as the government and the bosses for its failure and outright refusal to meaningfully take up the growing concerns of Black workers <b>in</b> the <b>auto</b> industry.|$|R
