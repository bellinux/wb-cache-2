5|$|Several reviewers <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>critical</b> of the event. The most {{frequent}} criticism has {{been related to}} the match between The Undertaker and Giant Gonzalez, Hulk Hogan's title win, and the Roman togas worn by announcers. Both the pay-per-view buyrate and the attendance for the event dropped from the previous year's WrestleMania.|$|E
5|$|The George C. Marshall Institute and Fred Singer, {{two of the}} subjects, <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>critical</b> of the book. Other {{reviewer}}s {{have been}} more favorable. One reviewer said that Merchants of Doubt is exhaustively researched and documented, and {{may be one of}} the most important books of 2010. Another reviewer saw the book as his choice for best science book of the year. It was made into a film, Merchants of Doubt, directed by Robert Kenner, released in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Tim Waterstone and James Daunt <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>critical</b> of tax {{avoidance}} by Amazon.com in the British press. Amazon has received sustained scrutiny {{for the amount}} of its overall sales that are reported by its UK subsidiary, in comparison to those 'processed offshore in Luxembourg to avoid UK tax'. In the 2012-13 financial year, Amazon paid £3.2 million in tax on sales of £4.2 billion and received £2.5 million in grants from the government. In the same period, it was revealed that Waterstones paid £11.9 million in tax, despite an operating loss of £25.4 million and sales of £410.4 million.|$|E

5|$|Who's Your City? was {{intended}} to be a self-help book, based on scholarly research and an academic theory, that provided a reader the mental framework necessary to match their personality and life situation with the optimum city to reside. Florida drew upon his past research on the geographical aspects of wealth generation and locational decisions of members of the creative class, as well as theories and opinions of other academics, like Jane Jacobs, and even those who <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>critical</b> of Florida's work, like Tim Harford. New research included a psychological aspect to his theory. Maps, graphs, tables, and indices illustrate the text.|$|E
5|$|Windows 10 {{received}} mostly positive reviews {{upon its}} original release in July 2015; critics praised Microsoft's decision {{to provide a}} desktop-oriented interface in line with previous versions of Windows, contrasting the tablet-oriented approach of 8, although Windows 10's touch-oriented user interface mode was panned for containing regressions upon the touch-oriented interface of Windows 8. Critics also praised the improvements to Windows 10's bundled software over Windows 8.1, Xbox Live integration, {{as well as the}} functionality and capabilities of Cortana personal assistant and the replacement of Internet Explorer with Microsoft Edge. However, media outlets <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>critical</b> of changes to operating system behaviors, including mandatory update installation, privacy concerns over data collection performed by the OS for Microsoft and its partners, and the adware-like tactics used to promote the operating system on its release.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} fusion {{researchers}} working on non-tokamak systems, such as Robert Bussard and Eric Lerner, <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>critical</b> of ITER for diverting funding {{from what they}} believe could be a potentially more viable and/or cost-effective path to fusion power, such as the polywell reactor.|$|E
25|$|On 16 September 2013, BTV {{journalist}} Genka Shikerova’s personal automobile {{was found}} torched.

25|$|The {{operations}} on New Britain are considered by historians {{to have been}} a success for the Allied forces. However, some have questioned the necessity of the campaign.

25|$|On {{repeated}} occasions, the WJC {{has urged}} countries {{to ensure that}} Holocaust denial is publicly condemned and fought.

25|$|Milner has {{the ability}} to pass {{accurately}} and shoot from a great distance from goal. As a result, he usually goes forward for set pieces and is often a candidate to take corners and free kicks. Critical opinion is divided as to Milner's crossing ability. While some commentators <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>critical</b> of his ability in this area, other journalists have said that Milner can produce accurate crosses.|$|E

25|$|Its {{stance is}} one of {{immediate}} peace, irrespective of national boundaries or other such outcomes. Party speakers do emphasise, though, that the SPGB is not a pacifist party, and would countenance force being used to defend a socialist revolution. They <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>critical,</b> also, of opponents of nuclear weapons such as CND {{on the grounds that}} opposing one type of weapon is insufficient compared to opposing the system that causes war.|$|E
25|$|Many {{political}} opponents and DMK party senior leaders <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>critical</b> {{of the rise}} of M. K. Stalin in the party. But some of the party men have pointed out that Stalin has come up on his own. Stalin was an MLA in 1989 and 1996 when his father Karunanidhi was the Chief Minister, and became Chennai's 44th mayor in 1996. In 2009, he was made the Deputy Chief Minister.|$|E
25|$|Richard Stallman and the Free Software Foundation <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>critical</b> of Android {{and have}} {{recommended}} {{the usage of}} alternatives such as Replicant, because drivers and firmware vital for the proper functioning of Android devices are usually proprietary, and because the Google Play Store application can forcibly install or deinstall applications and, as a result, invite non-free software; although the Free Software Foundation has not found Google {{to use it for}} malicious reasons.|$|E

25|$|In 1980, General Secretary and reformist Hu Yaobang visited Tibet and {{ushered in}} a period of social, political, and {{economic}} liberalization. At the end of the decade, however, before the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, monks in the Drepung and Sera monasteries started protesting for independence, and so the government halted reforms and started an anti-separatist campaign. Human rights organisations <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>critical</b> of the Beijing and Lhasa governments' approach to human rights in the region when cracking down on separatist convulsions that have occurred around monasteries and cities, most recently in the 2008 Tibetan unrest.|$|E
25|$|In the US, Good Samaritan {{laws have}} been {{implemented}} to protect bystanders who acted in good faith. Many organizations are including bystander training. For example, the United States Department of the Army is doing bystander training with respect to sexual assault. Some organizations routinely do bystander training with respect to safety issues. Others have been doing bystander training with respect to diversity issues. Organizations such as American universities are also using bystander research to improve bystander attitudes in cases of rape. Examples include the InterAct Sexual Assault Prevention program and the Green Dot program. Others <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>critical</b> of these laws for being punitive and criminalizing the problem they are meant to address.|$|E
25|$|There <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>critical</b> {{editions of}} {{particular}} tractates (e.g. Henry Malter's edition of Ta'anit), {{but there is}} no modern critical edition of the whole Talmud. Modern editions such as those of the Oz ve-Hadar Institute correct misprints and restore passages that in earlier editions were modified or excised by censorship but do not attempt a comprehensive account of textual variants. One edition, by Rabbi Yosef Amar, represents the Yemenite tradition, and {{takes the form of a}} photostatic reproduction of a Vilna-based print to which Yemenite vocalization and textual variants have been added by hand, together with printed introductory material. Collations of the Yemenite manuscripts of some tractates have been published by Columbia University.|$|E
