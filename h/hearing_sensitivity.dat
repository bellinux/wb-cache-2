5|$|The {{pinniped}} ear {{is adapted}} for hearing underwater, {{where it can}} hear sound frequencies at up to 70,000Hz. In air, hearing is somewhat reduced in pinnipeds compared to many terrestrial mammals. While {{they are capable of}} hearing a wide range of frequencies (e.g. 500 to 32,000Hz in the northern fur seal, compared to 20 to 20,000Hz in humans), their airborne <b>hearing</b> <b>sensitivity</b> is weaker overall. One study of three species—the harbor seal, California sea lion and northern elephant seal—found that the sea lion was best adapted for airborne hearing, the harbor seal was equally capable of hearing in air and water, and the elephant seal was better adapted for underwater hearing. Although pinnipeds have a fairly good sense of smell on land, it is useless underwater as their nostrils are closed.|$|E

40|$|Sea turtles {{spend much}} of their life in aquatic environments, but {{critical}} portions of their life cycle, such as nesting and hatching, occur in terrestrial environments, suggesting that it may be important for them to detect sounds in both air and water. In this study we compared underwater and aerial <b>hearing</b> <b>sensitivities</b> in five juvenile green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas) by measuring auditory evoked potential responses to tone pip stimuli. Green sea turtles detected acoustic stimuli in both media, responding to underwater stimuli between 50 and 1600 Hz and aerial stimuli between 50 and 800 Hz, with maximum sensitivity between 200 and 400 Hz underwater and 300 and 400 Hz in air. When underwater and aerial <b>hearing</b> <b>sensitivities</b> were compared in terms of pressure, green sea turtle aerial sound pressure thresholds were lower than underwater thresholds, however they detected a wider range of frequencies underwater. When thresholds were compared in terms of sound intensity, green sea turtle sound intensity level thresholds were 2 - 39 dB lower underwater particularly at frequencies below 400 Hz. Acoustic stimuli may provide important environmental cues for sea turtles. Further {{research is needed to determine}} how sea turtles behaviorally and physiologically respond to sounds in their environment...|$|R
40|$|An {{astonishing}} {{diversity of}} inner ears and accessory hearing structures (AHS) that can enhance hearing has evolved in fishes. Inner ears mainly {{differ in the}} size of the otolith end organs, the shape and orientation of the sensory epithelia, and the orientation patterns of ciliary bundles of sensory hair cells. Despite our profound morphological knowledge of inner ear variation, two main questions remain widely unanswered. (i) What selective forces and/or constraints led to the evolution of this inner ear diversity? (ii) How is the morphological variability linked to hearing abilities? Improved hearing is mainly based on the ability of many fish species to transmit oscillations of swim bladder walls or other gas-filled bladders to the inner ears. Swim bladders may be linked to the inner ears via a chain of ossicles (in otophysans), anterior extensions (e. g. some cichlids, squirrelfishes), or the gas bladders may touch the inner ears directly (labyrinth fishes). Studies on catfishes and cichlids demonstrate that larger swim bladders and more pronounced linkages to the inner ears positively affect both auditory sensitivities and the detectable frequency range, but lack of a connection does not exclude hearing enhancement. This diversity of auditory structures and hearing abilities is one of the main riddles in fish bioacoustics research. Hearing enhancement might have evolved to facilitate intraspecific acoustic communication. A comparison of sound-producing species, however, indicates that acoustic communication is widespread in taxa lacking AHS. Eco-acoustical constraints are a more likely explanation for the diversity in fish <b>hearing</b> <b>sensitivities.</b> Low ambient noise levels may have facilitated the evolution of AHS, enabling fish to detect low-level abiotic noise and sounds from con- and heterospecifics, including predators and prey. Aquatic habitats differ in ambient noise regimes, and preliminary data indicate that <b>hearing</b> <b>sensitivities</b> of fishes vary accordingly...|$|R

Otoliths of the saccule and lagena from cave fish differed from those of surface fish in the features of the face oriented towards the sensory epithelium.

25|$|Hearing loss in divers is a known {{problem and}} has many factors, {{one of which}} is noise exposure. Open circuit divers produce a high level of {{breathing}} noise by airflow through the regulator during inhalation and bubble noise during exhalation. The primary noise source is exhaust bubbles which can exceed 95dB(A). Voice communications and free-flow demisting push these levels above 100db(A), as communications need to be about 15dB above background to be intelligible. Free-flow helmet noise levels are generally higher than demand systems, and are comparable with demisting noise levels. Rebreather and reclaim systems are significantly quieter, as there is no bubble noise most of the time. The type of headgear affects noise sensitivity and noise hazard depending on whether transmission is wet or dry. Human hearing underwater is less sensitive with wet ears than in air, and a neoprene hood provides substantial attenuation. When wearing a helmet sensitivity is similar to in surface air, as <b>hearing</b> <b>sensitivity</b> is not significantly affected by the breathing gas or chamber atmosphere composition or pressure.|$|E
25|$|Hearing loss {{among the}} aged {{community}} lessens elders' ability {{to compensate for}} other age related social and/or physical problems. Communication problems of elderly adults can be greatly impacted by mechanical problems such as: the translation of ideas into linguistic representation or expression, the perception of linguistic stimuli or the derivation of an idea from a given unit of disclosure. Changes in these mechanical problems {{are more important than}} changes in linguistic knowledge. The main goal of hearing aids is to improve communication and quality of life, not just to restore hearing. Presbycusis {{is an example of a}} hearing deficit that cannot be corrected by hearing aids. Presbycusis, the alteration of <b>hearing</b> <b>sensitivity</b> associated with normal hearing loss, is caused by the decreased amount of hair cells of the inner ear. This is normally caused by long periods of distressing noise that diminish the hair cells which with increasing age will not grow back. Presbycusis and other such hearing-related problems promote social withdrawal, as individuals begin to lose touch with the world around them. Hearing loss among the aged community lessens elders' ability to compensate for other age-related social and/or physical problems. This impairment can cause elders to lose touch of social skills because they may have trouble keeping up with fast-paced or hearing different pitched voices in conversation.|$|E
500|$|In mammals, {{albinism}} is occasionally {{associated with}} hearing impairments. However, when tested, {{there was no}} differences in responses between wild-type and albinistic European wels catfish (Silurus glanis) and South American bronze catfish (Corydoras aeneus). [...] Similarly, Mexican blind cave fish (Astyanax mexicanus) do not differ in <b>hearing</b> <b>sensitivity</b> from the normally pigmented and eyed surface-dwelling populations. [...] Fish lack melanin in the inner ear, meaning that hearing in fishes {{is less likely to}} be affected by albinism than in mammals.|$|E
40|$|Any {{attempt to}} assess the effects of sounds on animals must {{consider}} species differences in hearing abilities. Although the hearing ranges of most species overlap to a large degree, considerable variation occurs in high- and low-frequency hearing {{as well as in}} absolute sensitivity. As a result, a sound that is easily audible to one species may be less audible, or even inaudible, to another. The purpose of this review is to describe the variation in the hearing ranges of common laboratory animals. 21 - 3 In our interactions with animals, we often assume that their hearing abilities are, if not identical to ours, at least quite similar. For example, we easily hear the vocalizations of cats and dogs, and they, in turn, are easily trained to come to the sound of our calls. However, comparative {{studies have shown that the}} auditory sensitivity of different species can vary widely, especially with regard to the ability to hear high- and low-frequency sounds.

40|$|Regulations for {{protecting}} and preserving {{the marine environment}} (e. g. in the USA and EU) often require investigating the potential effect of anthropogenic sound on marine life. The origin of underwater sound can be natural as well as anthropogenic. To assess the potential importance of various types of sounds, we constructed sound maps for the Dutch North Sea for both natural sources (i. e. wind and rain) and anthropogenic sources (shipping, explosions, and seismic surveys). Different sources affect different species, because of different frequency ranges or because of their distribution in time (e. g., continuous or intermittent; changing suddenly or gradually). Our maps take into account different averaging times, different swimming depths and frequency-weighting according to different <b>hearing</b> <b>sensitivities.</b> The underwater acoustic propagation is modeled mathematically by combining Weston’s average intensity method and adiabatic normal mode theory, which can provide fast and accurate results without calculation of normal mode eigenvalues and tracing rays. These maps, combined with information on species distribution and their physiological and behavioural reactions to sound, provide a useful indicator for understanding the impact of sound on marine life in the Dutch part of North Sea...|$|R
500|$|Water has {{different}} acoustic properties {{from those of}} air. Sound from an underwater source can propagate relatively freely through body tissues where there is contact with the water as the acoustic properties are similar. When the head is exposed to the water, some sound is transmitted by the eardrum and middle ear, but a significant part reaches the cochlea independently, by bone conduction. Some sound localisation is possible, though difficult. [...] Human hearing underwater, {{in cases where the}} diver’s ear is wet, is less sensitive than in air. Frequency sensitivity underwater also differs from that in air, with a consistently higher threshold of hearing underwater; sensitivity to higher frequency sounds is reduced the most. [...] The type of headgear affects noise sensitivity and noise hazard depending on whether transmission is wet or dry. Human hearing underwater is less sensitive with wet ears than in air, and a neoprene hood causes substantial attenuation. When wearing a helmet, <b>hearing</b> <b>sensitivity</b> is similar to that in surface air, as it is not greatly affected by the breathing gas or chamber atmosphere composition or pressure. Because sound travels faster in heliox than in air, voice formants are raised, making divers' speech high-pitched and distorted, and hard to understand for people not used to it. The increased density of breathing gases under pressure has a similar and additive effect.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are also}} {{high rates of}} hearing loss, often NIHL, in firefighters, which {{increases}} with age and number of years working as a firefighter. [...] Hearing loss prevention programs have been implemented in multiple stations and have shown to help lower the rate of firefighters with NIHL. Other {{attempts have been made}} to lower sound exposures for firefighters, such as enclosing the cabs of the firetrucks to lower the siren exposure while driving. NFPA (National Fire Protection Association) is responsible for occupational health programs and standards in firefighters which discusses what <b>hearing</b> <b>sensitivity</b> is required to work as a firefighter, but also enforces baseline (initial) and annual hearing tests (based on OSHA hearing maintenance regulations). While NIHL can be a risk that occurs from working as a firefighter, NIHL can also be a safety concern for communicating while doing the job as communicating with coworkers and victims is essential for safety. Hearing protection devices have been used by firefighters in the United States. Earmuffs are the most commonly used hearing protection device (HPD) as they are the most easy to put on correctly in a quick manner. Multiple fire departments have used HPDs that have communication devices built in, allowing firefighters to speak with each other at safe, but audible sound levels, while lowering the hazardous sound levels around them.|$|E

40|$|The {{underwater}} <b>hearing</b> <b>sensitivities</b> of two 2 -year-old female harbor seals were quantified {{in a pool}} {{built for}} acoustic research by using a behavioral psycho-acoustic technique. The animals were trained only to respond when they detected an acoustic signal (“go/no-go” response). Detection thresholds were obtained for pure tone signals (frequencies: 0. 2 – 40 kHz; durations: 0. 5 – 5000 ms, depending on the frequency; 59 frequency-duration combinations). Detection thresholds were quantified by varying the signal amplitude by the 1 -up, 1 -down staircase method, and were defined as the stimulus levels, resulting in a 50 % detection rate. The hearing thresholds of the two seals were similar for all frequencies except for 40 kHz, for which the thresholds differed by, on average, 3. 7 dB. There was an inverse relationship between the time constant (τ), derived from an exponential model of temporal integration, and the frequency [log(τ) = 2. 86 − 0. 94 [*]log(f);τ in ms and f in kHz]. Similarly, the thresholds increased when the pulse was shorter than ∼ 780  cycles (independent of the frequency). For pulses shorter than the integration time, the thresholds increased by 9 – 16 dB per decade reduction in the duration or number of cycles in the pulse. The {{results of this study}} suggest that most published hearing thresholds ≤ 1  kHz for harbor seals are probably not absolute, as they were derived from signals with durations shorter than the time constants for those frequencies...|$|R
40|$|The LKB 1 gene, which encodes a serine/threonine kinase, was {{discovered}} to play crucial roles in cell differentiation, proliferation, {{and the establishment}} of cell polarity.

Tests of auditory brainstem response and distortion product otoacoustic emissions revealed significant decreases in the <b>hearing</b> <b>sensitivities</b> of the Atoh 1 -LKB 1 -/- mice. In Atoh 1 -LKB 1 -/- mice, malformations of hair cell stereocilliary bundles were present as early as postnatal day 1 (P 1), a time long before the maturation of the hair cell bundles. In addition, we also observed outer hair cell (OHC) loss starting at P 14. The impaired stereocilliary bundles occurred long before the presence of hair cell loss. Stereociliary cytoskeletal structure depends on the core actin-based cytoskeleton and several actin-binding proteins. By Western blot, we examined actin-binding proteins, specifically ERM (ezrin/radixin/moesin) proteins involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton of hair cell stereocilia. Our results revealed that the phosphorylation of ERM proteins (pERM) was significantly decreased in mutant mice. Thus, we propose that the decreased pERM may be a key factor for the impaired stereocillia function, and the damaged stereocillia may induce hair cell loss and hearing impairments. Taken together, our data indicates that LKB 1 is required for the development and maintenance of stereocilia in the inner ear...|$|R
40|$|Perceived {{synchrony}} {{of visual}} and auditory signals {{can be altered}} by exposure to a stream of temporally offset stimulus pairs. Previous literature suggests that adapting to audiovisual temporal offsets is an important recalibration to correctly combine audiovisual stimuli into a single percept {{across a range of}} source distances. Healthy ageing results in synchrony perception over a wider range of temporally offset visual and auditory signals, independent of age-related unisensory declines in vision and <b>hearing</b> <b>sensitivities.</b> However the impact of ageing on audiovisual recalibration is unkonwn. Audiovisual synchrony perception for sound-lead and sound-lag stimuli was measured for fifteen younger (22 - 32 years old) and fifteen older (64 - 74 years old) healthy adults using a method-of-constant-stimuli, after adapting to a stream of visual and auditory pairs. The adaptation pairs were either synchronous or asynchronous (sound-lag of 230 ms). The adaptation effect for each observer was computed as the shift in the mean of the individually fitted psychometric functions after adapting to asynchrony. Post adaptation to synchrony, the younger and older observers had average window widths (±standard deviation) of 326 (± 80) and 448 (± 105) ms, respectively. There was no adaptation effect for sound-lead pairs. Both the younger and older observers however perceived more sound-lag pairs as synchronous. The magnitude of the adaptation effect in the older observers was not correlated with how often they saw the adapting sound-lag stimuli as asynchronous nor their synchrony window widths. Our finding demonstrates that audiovisual synchrony perception adapts less with advancing age...|$|R

40|$|Developmental {{events in}} the {{temporal}} bones shift the pattern of a given speech sound’s acoustic profile through the time children are mapping linguistic sound systems. Before age 5 years, frequency information in vowels is differentially accessible through the years children are acquiring the sound systems of their native language(s). To model the acoustic effects caused by developing temporal bones, data collected to elicit steady-state vowels from adult native speakers of English and Diné were modified to reflect the form of children’s <b>hearing</b> <b>sensitivities</b> at different ages based on patterns established in the psychoacoustic literature. It was assumed, {{based on the work}} of psychacousticians (e. g., Werner, Fay & Popper 2012; and Werner & Marean 1996), that the effects caused by immature temporal bones were conductive immaturities, and the age-sensitive filters were constructed based on psychoacoustic research into the hearing of infants and children. Data were partitioned by language, sex, and individual vowels and compared for points of similarity and difference in the way information in vowels is filtered because of the constraints imposed by the immaturity of the temporal bones. Results show that the early formant pattern becomes successively modified in a constrained pattern reflecting maturational processes. Results also suggest that children may well be switching strategies for processing vowels, using a more adult-like process after 18 months. Future research should explore if early hearing not only affects individual speech sounds but their relationships to one another in the vowel space as well. Additionally, there is an interesting artifact in the observed gradual progression to full adult hearing which may be the effect of the foramen of Huschke contributing to the filters at 1 year and 18 months. Given that immature temporal bones reflect brain expansion and rotational birth in hominids, these results contribute to the discussion of the biological underpinnings of the evolution of language.

I measured the underwater and aerial <b>hearing</b> <b>sensitivities</b> of juvenile green (Chelonia mydas), hatchling leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea), and hatchling hawksbill (Eretmochelys imbricata) sea turtles by recording auditory evoked potential responses to tonal stimuli. Green turtles detected tonal stimuli between 50 and 1, 600 Hz underwater (maximum sensitivity: 200 - 400 Hz) and 50 and 800 Hz in air (maximum sensitivity: 300 - 400 Hz), leatherbacks detected tonal stimuli between 50 and 1, 200 Hz underwater (maximum sensitivity: 100 - 400 Hz) and 50 and 1, 600 Hz in air (maximum sensitivity: 50 - 400 Hz), and hawksbills detected tonal stimuli between 50 and 1, 600 Hz in both media (maximum sensitivity: 200 - 400 Hz). Sea turtles were more sensitive to aerial than underwater stimuli when audiograms were compared in terms of sound pressure, but they were more sensitive to underwater stimuli when audiograms were compared in terms of sound intensity. I also examined the behavioral responses of loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) to simulated low frequency acoustic deterrent devices (ADDs) and found that these turtles exhibited a mild, aversive response to these sounds. This finding indicates that low frequency tonal ADDs have the potential to warn sea turtles of the presence of fishing gear and suggest that field tests of ADDs are warranted. Finally, I conducted a comprehensive review of our knowledge of the acoustic ecology of sea turtles, examined the sources of marine anthropogenic sound sea turtles are able to detect, evaluated the potential physiological and behavioral effects of anthropogenic sound, identified data gaps, and made recommendations for future research.
