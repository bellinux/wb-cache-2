50|$|Belonio's {{rice husk}} stove {{is a small}} {{cylinder}} equipped with a fan in its base, which provides air during the conversion of rice hulls into gas. It was designed as an apparatus {{that can be easily}} operated. Fish can be fried in fifteen minutes using the stove. The stove consumes 2 kilograms of rice husks per hour. It does not produce any smoke, and the burnt rice husks can still be used as coal and also as <b>insulating</b> <b>cement</b> for traditional stoves fueled by wood. Plans for the stove are available free of charge from the internet.|$|E

30|$|The {{top-level}} end of {{the outer}} tube was enclosed by a PVC cylinder of diameter 20  cm and length 30  cm, which was covered by an <b>insulating</b> <b>cement</b> tile to limit outside temperature variations affecting {{the inside of the}} tubes. The CR- 39 dosimeter, which registers cumulative Rn alpha tracks as described in Kobeissi et al. (2008) and shown in Fig.  3, consists of a plastic cup on whose bottom center a CR- 39 detector (with dimensions 20  ×  15  mm 2 and 1  mm thick) was fixed by a double sticking material. The center of the cup cover was equipped with a 1  cm diameter hole covered with a 1.5  cm thick sponge filter, through which only Rn gas can penetrate to the interior of the cup. The calibration of the dosimeter was done earlier at the Federal Office for Radiation Protection in Berlin.|$|E
40|$|Many U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) {{facilities}} are undergoing decontamination and decommissioning (D&D) activities.

The particular brush is fitted with wicks - that is, <b>insulated</b> and <b>cemented</b> cylinders of brush material, terminating in the brush surface. The number of partial contact surfaces can be computed from the length of the rest periods in which such wicks remain without current.

40|$|Insulating {{concrete}} {{is a type}} {{of material}} designed to enhance energy efficiency by reducing thermal conductivity. It contains numerous voids induced by the use of air entraining admixtures or aggregates, and these voids strongly affect the characteristics and responses of the material. Thus, appropriate methods to examine the void distribution of materials are needed. Here, X ray micro computed tomography micro CT is adopted to investigate the spatial distribution of voids in a material without destroying the specimen. By using micro CT, a series of cross sectional images with the micrometer range pixel size can be obtained. Then, void density contour and probabilistic description methods, such as two point correlation and lineal path functions, are used to describe the void distribution inside the specimen. In this study, Aer solids, small prefabricated hollow air bubbles, are used for <b>insulating</b> <b>cement</b> paste specimens to increase the insulating effect. The cement paste specimens with different void ratios and Aer solids are generated, and their void distribution characteristics are investigated using the methods mentioned above. The thermal and mechanical responses of the insulating specimens are also evaluated by experiments and numerical methods. The effect of Aer solids on the material characteristics and the relationship between void distribution and material responses are confirmed from the obtained results...|$|E
40|$|In 1933 {{the method}} of laminar {{thermocoagulation}} of the cerebral cortex was described. ' 2 This allows one to destroy, at will, any number of cortical layers, and has the following additional advantages: (1) {{the continuity of the}} cortex is undisturbed, (2) no bleeding occurs, (3) the killed region is strictly confined to the heated area, (4) the cortex immediately outside the killed area is functionally normal, and (5) scar formation and retraction are absent in the adjacent cortex. This method has been employed in many experiments 8 ' 4 ' 5, 6, 78 in which a simple coagulator was used, the one inconvenience of which was that only the heating surface, the "thermode " proper, could be sterilized. In this paper a coagulator is described of such character that the instrument can be sterilized in the autoclave and hence can be used conveniently in clinical neurosurgery. The apparatus consists of a "thermode " (Fig. 1) heated by the current from a 5 -volt 100 -watt stepdown-transformer. The thermode is a heavy-walled brass tube consisting of four parts, A, B, C, and H (Fig. 1). A and B are joined by insulating cement; B, C, and H are screwed together. Inside this ther- X mode is inserted a nichrome heating-wire, N, of No. 28 gauge (Fig. 1). The <b>insulating</b> <b>cement</b> between parts A and B of the thermode insures FIG. 1.

40|$|Sustainable, or "green building," {{design and}} {{construction}} {{provide an opportunity to}} use resources more efficiently, while creating healthier and more energy-efficient homes. Successful green buildings leave a lighter footprint on the environment through conservation of resources, {{while at the same time}} balancing energy-efficient, cost-effective, low-maintenance products for construction needs. A similar concept of green building is natural building, which is usually on a smaller scale and tends to focus on the use of natural materials that are available locally In this thesis, sustainable housing materials for Shiraz houses are identified. In the first step the concept of sustainable materials are revealed and then, the characteristics of sustainable hosing materials are explained based on previous works and researches. Forward these works, same thesis for sustainable building materials in Sri Lanka is modified and its methodology is analyzed. Total characteristics and modifications of Shiraz and Shiraz houses are explained in next step, and then the analysis based on the sustainable material characteristics is started. Each objective is analyzed based on each house condition and the results are determined. The results show that, gathering the following materials would lead us to have a sustainable house in Shiraz: <b>insulated</b> <b>cement</b> block due to its low embodied energy and carbon emission for using in inside walls, the low amount of carbon emission and embodied energy of travertine stone in faced walls, steep clay roof as roofing system because it has the least carbon emission, and UPVC window for windows materials. In case of widows materials iron windows has the least amount of embodied amount of carbon emission and embodied energy but because they do not have many characteristics of sustainability, UPVC windows are preferred instead of these windows...|$|R

Known as 'bell bottom jikos' because of their shape, these stoves have been adapted by ITDG and other collaborators from an original design which came from India to Kenya in the late 19 th century. The charcoal-burning jiko has a ceramic liner, and is <b>insulated</b> with <b>cement</b> and vermiculite. ITDG claims that the improved insulation gives fuel savings of up to 50 % and will pay for itself after two to four months' use by the average household.

5000|$|The Canada Malting complex was {{designed}} by David Jerome Spence, and was built in 1904. [...] On {{the west side of}} the complex there are nine violet colored silos. They are covered in treated clay tiles that were manufactured by the Barnett and Record Co. of Minneapolis. These silos are rare examples of using this technique to cover and <b>insulate</b> silos. The <b>cement</b> silos on the other side were added in the 1940s, and were used to store the barley used to produce the malt. The barley was germinated and dried in the buildings that lined Saint-Ambroise Street. [...] The factory had an enormous output of 250000 lb of malt per year, and distributed it to distilleries and breweries. The closing of the Lachine Canal in 1970 forced the company to transport its malt by train only, and around 1980, the building was actually too small and the transportation costs too high, so the company abandoned the site and moved into a new malting complex located at 205 Riverside and Mill Street, Montreal. [...] The building was then sold for $500,000 and became a soya and corn storage facility for Quonta Holding Ltd, before it was abandoned in 1989 when Canadian National ceased its rail line service to factories in this area of the canal. The ancient clay silos are now protected as part of the Lachine Canal National Historic Site. They have been so battered from both the elements and vandalism, that it is no longer possible to restore them.|$|R
40|$|Our {{interdisciplinary}} team, {{known as}} Forge, {{has built a}} cookstove that not only can be a portable cookstove, but also includes a port to charge devices such as a phone using thermoelectrics. The product has been designed for developing areas in Nicaragua where power is inaccessible and a multi-purpose cookstove/phone charger could be of use. The cookstove features a cylindrical combustion chamber {{that can be used}} for gasification. Gasification is a burning process where smoke from the fire is also burned, creating higher temperatures and a cleaner burn. The combustion chamber is <b>insulated</b> using refractory <b>cement,</b> which will drop the temperature from about 700 Celsius inside the chamber to 200 Celsius outside the chamber. The cookstove outputs heat at a rate of 4. 6 - 6. 6 kW. The cookstove has thermoelectric modules attached to the outside, which, by utilizing the Seebeck effect, convert excess heat into electrical energy. Ideally, the energy would be transferred into the phone at 5 volts and 0. 5 - 0. 6 amps and some of the electrical energy would be used to power a cooling fan to help the stove function properly. The final temperatures that were recorded ranged from around 400 ºC to 700 ºC in the combustion chamber and around 500 ºC for the cooking surface. Gasification was successfully occurring during this stage, and the smoke was being visibly burned off. The electrical output was less successful, resulting with only around 0. 08 V coming out of the thermoelectric generators due to the lack of air flow within the electrical housing and poor electrical connection. The stove does achieve its primary functionality of being more than capable of boiling water, something that presently available cookstoves in Nicaragua cannot do consistently...|$|R
40|$|Requests {{of energy}} {{reduction}} and efficiency {{has contributed to}} improve environmental aspects in construction. It has also —mainly for the insulat-ing materials used—raised a new issue: the environmental sustainability of building materials and products. Assessment of the environmental impact produced by any human activity is, in general, very complex and nowadays very debated. It involves a local and global scale, the biosphere — in which humans {{are not the only}} protagonists — and all valuation methods must be considered. The build-ing sector in particular consumes a significant amount of resources, both when producing components and in construction. Construction uses large amount of energy for heating, releases as much pollutant emissions and form massive volumes of mixed waste after demolition. The use of wood in construction meets the main objectives for achieving sustainable development. This is possible through ecological forest man-agement combined with the low environmental impact of products made from wood. Wood is the only renewable resource in building materials. It possesses the capacity to be repaired, reused, efficiently recycled and recovered as fuel {{at the end of its}} life cycle. The contribution of this study is to quantitatively calculate and qualita-tively exam the environmental impacts —positive and negative— produced by the use of wood based components in structures. The focus is specifically <b>insulating</b> wood wool <b>cement</b> boards. The environmental sustainability assessment was combined with a technological analysis in order to verify the thermal performance of the insulation boards and the suitability of structural wood harvested from the Alps forests. The environmental assessment was performed through a life cycle analy-sis and developed according to ISO 14040 standard series, with an environmental product declaration oriented approach. The impact analy-sis was done in the specific software SimaPro 7. 3, including the uncertainty analyses. For the classification and characterization two dif-ferent life cycle impact assessment methods were used. The inventory analysis required a detailed data collection, in this case performed on the production process of a wood wool cement board. The results show that short wood chain supply and different energy pro-duction scenarios lead to a better environmental performance. This study allowed a quantification of the benefits of a short supply chain and eco-design by identifying opportunities for improvement of the wood wool cement board production process and the choice of insulating mate-rials to be included in the building design...|$|R
