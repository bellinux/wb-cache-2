40|$|This study {{examined}} the effects of pre-structuring <b>discussion</b> <b>threads</b> on group performance in computer-supported collaborative argumentation where students labeled their messages as arguments, challenges, supporting evidence, and explanations on a <b>threaded</b> <b>discussion</b> board. In the pre-structured group students were required to post supporting and opposing arguments to designated and separate <b>discussion</b> <b>threads.</b> In the control group no <b>discussion</b> <b>threads</b> were desig-nated for posting supporting and opposing arguments. The mean number of challenges elicited per argument was 64 % greater with pre-structured threads (ES = +. 47). No significant differences were found in the mean number of counter-challenges, supporting evidence, and explanations posted in reply to challenges. The findings suggest that prestructured <b>discussion</b> <b>threads</b> can increase the frequency of argument→challenge exchanges needed to initiate critical discourse...|$|R

As such, the first accused's [...] "particularly vile remarks", which had provoked a widespread and virulent response and sparked off the slinging of racial slurs at Chinese and Malays, {{was taken to}} be an aggravating factor. The Senior District Judge also took into account mitigating factors specific to the case– the offending acts by the accused persons were halted early on, and they had taken action to reduce the offensiveness of the acts. One of the accused persons issued an apology and removed the offending material from public access, while the other locked the <b>discussion</b> <b>thread</b> containing the offending statement and also tendered a written apology. The significance of these mitigating factors was downplayed in Ong Kian Cheong, District Judge Neighbour observing that despite their presence the offences committed were serious in {{that they had the}} capacity to undermine and erode racial and religious harmony in Singapore.|$|E
2500|$|In 2001 and 2002 the {{brothers}} published five papers in peer-reviewed physics journals, including Annals of Physics and Classical and Quantum Gravity. [...] The {{controversy over the}} Bogdanovs' work began on October 22, 2002, with an email sent by University of Tours physicist Max Niedermaier to University of Pittsburgh physicist Ezra T. Newman. [...] Niedermayer suggested that the Bogdanovs' Ph.D. theses and papers were [...] "spoof," [...] created by throwing together string theory and theoretical physics jargon: [...] "The abstracts are delightfully meaningless combinations of buzzwords ... which apparently have been taken seriously." [...] Copies of the email reached American mathematical physicist John Baez, and on October 23 he created a <b>discussion</b> <b>thread</b> about the Bogdanovs' work on the Usenet newsgroup sci.physics.research, titled [...] "Physics bitten by reverse Alan Sokal hoax?" [...] Baez was comparing the Bogdanovs' publications to the 1996 Sokal affair, in which physicist Alan Sokal successfully submitted an intentionally nonsensical paper to a cultural studies journal in order to criticize the incoherence of postmodernism. The Bogdanovs quickly became a popular discussion topic, with most respondents agreeing that the papers were flawed. [...] The Bogdanovs' background in entertainment lent some plausibility {{to the idea that}} they were attempting a deliberate hoax, but Igor Bogdanov quickly denied the accusation. [...] The online discussion was quickly followed by media attention; The Register reported on the dispute on November 1, 2002 [...] and stories in The Chronicle of Higher Education, Nature, The New York Times, and other publications appeared soon after.|$|E

The original email corpus was extremely heterogeneous. We first applied the Tidy HTML parser to strip tags and to identify data such as the sender, thread history, and subject of the messages.

40|$|Starting {{from the}} socio-constructivist {{concepts}} of (virtual) {{community of practice}} (vCoP) and internet-based argumentative open-ended learning environments, this study proposes and validates two tools for automated dialogue assessment, ReaderBench and Important Moments, developed on the ground of the polyphonic social knowledge building model. The analyzed corpus was the dialogue produced by an academic vCoP with N = 179 community members in 23 months, and consisting of 3685 interventions in 292 text-based <b>discussion</b> <b>threads.</b> The analysis results uncovered {{significant differences in the}} <b>discussion</b> <b>threads</b> produced by central and peripheral participants, such that central participants produced more interventions with higher collaborative dialogue quality, and the <b>discussion</b> <b>threads</b> they initiated were longer and involved a larger number of participants. Moreover, based on the automated analysis result, the vCoP participants could be classified in two clusters corresponding to the well-known core-periphery structure of CoPs. These findings are consistent with those revealed by other methods, and suggest that the employed tools are appropriate for identifying virtual communities that are appropriate as open-ended learning environments. Further research and development is needed to deepen quantitative vCoP models and test communication strategies recommended to students in vCoP-based argumentative open-ended learning environments...|$|R
