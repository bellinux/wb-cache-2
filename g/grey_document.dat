40|$|A bibliometric {{study of}} the Italian grey {{literature}} in SIGLE database. Preliminary results. Given the increasing importance of Grey Literature (GL) for the information and documentation field, {{it is essential to}} apply a bibliometric analysis similar to the one widely used for the conventional literature. Study objectives: 1) impact evalutation of grey literature in physical sciences; and 2) differentiation between scientific and non scientific <b>grey</b> literature <b>documents</b> in the same discipline, according to their role and purpose in the communication process. Methods: A bibliometric analysis of grey literature references was applied on a sample of Reviews indexed by Science Citation Index. Referring to the second study objective, "meanigful" notes contained in <b>grey</b> literature <b>documents</b> were used as indicators. Examples of these indicators are as follows: national or international programs, granted projects, collaborating institutes, publication times, language. Data used for this analysis were obtained from a sample of <b>grey</b> literature <b>documents</b> belonging to the Italian input in SIGLE. Conclusions: Study results show that bibliometric analysis is an important tool to measuring and comparing grey literature use in different disciplines; in order to improve the SIGLE database, as well as other similar databases, it is preferable to anlyse the information contained in the <b>grey</b> literature <b>documents</b> in no-standardized form.

50|$|Some of the {{problems}} of accessing grey literature have decreased since the late 1990s as government, professional, business and university bodies have increasingly published their reports and other official or review documents online. The impact of this trend has been greatly boosted since the early 2000s by the growth of major search engines. Grey reports are thus far more easily found online than they were, often at no cost to access. Most users of reports and other <b>grey</b> <b>documents</b> have migrated to using online copies, and efforts by libraries to collect hard-copy versions have generally declined in consequence.|$|R

Attachment theory is referred to in current prison policy for mothers (PSO 4801, 2008), and could provide a framework linking policy and practice. Reviewing grey literature provided an opportunity to explore practice-based literature. 24 academic papers and 51 <b>grey</b> <b>documents</b> were reviewed. Use of attachment theory in the academic literature varied according to discipline, ranging from extensive use to no use. There was greater use of attachment theory in the grey literature. Despite linguistic differences, all documents highlighted the detrimental impact of separation on imprisoned mothers. However, specificity was lacking regarding support for mothers, and staff needs were overlooked. Given its use across the sparse research and practice literature, and its basis for policy, attachment theory could underpin theoretically informed support for imprisoned mothers separated from their infants and staff who support them...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} report we {{present the results}} of {{the second phase of the}} WILCO project, the aim of which was to {{describe}} how social inequality and exclusion patterns in twenty European cities have developed over the past years. Specifically, we have looked at effects with respect to gender, age and migration in the fields of employment, childcare and housing. The findings are based on 20 city reports collecting secondary statistical data, local literature and <b>grey</b> <b>documents</b> and interviews with privileged interlocutors, combined with interviews of 360 single mothers, young unemployed adults and migrants. The underlying city reports are available through our website: www. wilcoproject. eu. Our focus is on social vulnerability, which emerges from difficulties in the coordination of different resources and obligations, rather than from a lack of resources. In other words, it focuses on instability and precariousness, not on permanent exclusion or poverty in itself.

40|$|The article {{provides}} an overview on the definition and evolution of grey literature (GL) in the emerging environment of online resources and open access to scientific and technical information. First, it gives some empirical evidence {{on the importance of}} GL in scientific publications from different domains, especially education, based on citation analysis. Other topics: the impact of Internet on the production of GL, the place of grey resources in open archives and institutional repositories, the development of bibliographic control and standardization of GL and the difficulties of identification and accessing of <b>grey</b> <b>documents.</b> The article ends with some prognostics on the future of GL and open questions for research in library and information sciences on GL. LANDMARKS Cartographers everywhere, even those who map the archipelagos of knowledge (Baltz, 2003), need a few landmarks to guide their sketches and explorations.

40|$|Copyright {{enforcement}} {{is a mixture}} of law and culturally-influenced practice. Although the statute law appears in black and white, the traditions and expectations of those who create and use GL are definitely greyscale. And the latter are a better predictor of both infringement and litigation than {{the letter of the law}} itself. Casual US assumptions about using GL stem in part from technicalities in the pre- 1978 copyright law, which often threw GL immediately into the public domain. These assumptions stem also partly from the low economic valuation of GL, and the key role economic value plays in US copyright litigation. Since moral rights play almost no role in US copyright law, common European features such as the right of withdrawal have no place in local expectations. In recent years digital publishing and international access have exposed these assumptions to a context where the separation of moral and economic rights is taken for granted. Legal rights, both within the US and Europe, have also come in conflict with the urgent desire of both scholars and librarians to make <b>grey</b> <b>documents</b> more accessible by republishing them on the Web.

40|$|Despite the {{increasing}} attention to GL {{a number of}} methodological issues remain unsolved, basically standards of presentations and indicators for measuring GL use. The main aim {{of this paper is}} to study the use of GL in agricultural economics. This field of agricultural science is an interesting point of observation because it represents a social science (economics) in an applied context (agricultural). Previous studies showed that all agricultural research fields are strongly connected to agricultural economics. Current research in this field reveals the usage of various types of GL document. We identify different patterns of GL use through the analysis of citations fo GL in bibliographic references for a source sample consisting of core journals. Cited GL documents are described by their type (report, thesis, preprint, etc.), producer and publication date. Furthermore, based on their type, they are classified into three categories (dark - medium - light <b>grey</b> <b>documents)</b> in order to account for different tones of grey in GL, by which we mean different levels of availability and accessibility. Moreover, we estimate the coverage of each of theses three categories of GL documents for specialised libraries and Internet.

40|$|The recent European {{regulation}} (EEC Framework Directive 89 / 391) regarding {{safety and}} health at work and its transposition in the Italian legislation (L. D. 626 / 94 and L. D. 242 / 96) attaches great importance {{to the role of}} information. For the first time, employers are obliged to carry out the risk assessment pertaining to the specific workplace and to inform all their employees; the latter, in their turn, have not only to be informed, but to play an active role in informing themselves in order to become aware of the potential risks and to take every possible measure to avoid accidents. The new legislation has consequently had the effect of stimulating the production of a great quantity of specialised documentation, which presents the well known characteristics of <b>grey</b> literature <b>documents</b> and which very rarely reach the diffusion channels of conventional literature. Furthermore, this documentation is produced by institutions and associations, which are entitled to operate in this field at different levels of responsibility and which have specific roles and range of intervention. This paper presents the results of the first phase of a two-year project, which aims to develop a database gathering <b>grey</b> literature <b>documents</b> in the field. In this first phase a sample survey has been carried out using a questionnaire to identify grey literature producers, types of documents, modality of production, diffusion and bibliographic treatments. The structured questionnaire has been distributed to approximately 900 potential GL producers, {{selected on the basis of}} their competence and relevance so as to represent the main subjects which interact in this field: research (university and research bodies), control (national and local health care departments), consultancy (associations dedicated to this field, trade unions). This also gives the opportunity to analyse the documents produced which are characterised by the intersections of both technical-scientific and administrative- institutional aspects and which may stimulate further discussion on the definition of <b>Grey</b> Literature <b>documents.</b> Thus, the results of the questionnaire allow us to outline different profiles of Grey Literature producers, which in turn make it possible to develop an information system capable of facilitating the already existing information flows as well as creating new ones.

40|$|Augmented Reality (AR) {{technology}} for maintenance aims to improve human performances by providing relevant information regarding both corrective and preventive maintenance. The {{development of an}} AR system involves {{the choice of a}} hardware, a development software and a visualisation method. These selections are challenging due to the wide choice of services and options available which result in fragmentation: different development processes and different user experiences. In order to ease the selection of an AR system for supporting maintenance operations, this paper proposes an innovative process. It guides the reader to identify the requirements and the constraints for any specific application through a number of questions developed in this study to help with the selection. This results in suggestions for the selection of the hardware, the development software and the visualisation method. The process is built based on a literature study, <b>grey</b> <b>documents</b> and experts interviews. Future works includes the validation of the selection process proposed in this project. It could be done by comparing the choices made using the proposed process with the choices made by experts for the same case study. Moreover, the decisional process could be extended to face the economical and ergonomics aspects related with the selection of an AR system. It could be done expanding the literature research including studies which investigate into the economical and ergonomics consequences of the application or AR for maintenance.

40|$|Eagle, the {{producer}} of the SIGLE database (System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe), began in 1980 as an association of seven libraries and documentation centres from seven countries of the EU. In 1992, membership was opened to all European countries. As a result eagle now has members in 15 European countries. SIGLE covers all subject areas (1 / 3 technology, 1 / 3 social and economic sciences & humanities, 1 / 3 natural sciences/ medicine/ biology). SIGLE contains over 480, 000 records. The volume of input in SIGLE is steadily increasing. During the mid-eighties the annual input was 20, 000 records. During the mid-nineties the annual input was over 40, 000 records. Input of 73, 000 records is projected for the year 2000. During this process of steady growth the members of eagle sometimes question whether their efforts are worthwhile. They believe that the documents described in SIGLE provide a valuable information resource, {{but what is the}} reality? The International Conference Series on GL continues to generate more information on this subject. This paper examines research results, which demonstrate the quality and value of GL: (1) Grey information forms a major part of scientific and technical communication; (2) <b>Grey</b> <b>documents</b> remain unique and are rarely followed by a journal article; (3) Much grey literature is published by prestigious organizations whose names are a guarantee for quality.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} current {{developments and}} research outcomes {{at the intersection}} of two important paradigms: migration management and sexuality. Recent high court decisions and legal changes in Europe have stressed that non-citizens have a right to freely act out their sexual orientation, be it within the context of “traditional”, often religiously defined marriage and family life or in other forms of sexuality, without stigma or harassment. In both cases discussed, the state is tasked to respect the right of migrants to partnerships, and to protect them from potential persecution in other nations. In both cases, relationships and sexual practices can lead to the attainment of legal residence, even trumping other considerations such as employment or qualification. However, this extension of migrant rights is always accompanied with the fear of abuse. Based on original ethnographic research as well as an analysis of recent court cases and <b>grey</b> <b>documents,</b> we examine how immigration authorities decide on these cases. We argue that in order to prevent abuse, officials often go far beyond an acceptable infringement of privacy. However, this is {{due to a lack of}} supervision and guidelines, as well as the stark vulnerability of applicants, who in order to appear cooperative see themselves forced to comply with these infringements. Instead of seeing them as acts of pure humiliation, the practices should rather be seen as misguided practices of immigrant selection, often formed by traditional religious expectations of social life, which can be managed and curtailed...|$|R
40|$|International audiencePurpose – The paper aims to {{investigate}} {{the impact of the}} open access movement on the <b>document</b> supply of <b>grey</b> literature. Design/methodology/approach – The paper is based on a comparative survey of five major scientific and technical information centres: The British Library (UK), KM (Canada), INIST-CNRS (France), KISTI (South Korea) and TIB Hannover (Germany). Findings – The five institutions supplied less than 1. 8 million supplied items in 2014, i. e. half of the activity in 2004 (_ 55 per cent). There were 85, 000 <b>grey</b> <b>documents,</b> mainly conference proceedings and reports, i. e. 5 per cent of the overall activity, a historically low level compared to 2004 (_ 72 per cent). At the same time, they continue to expand their open access strategies. Just as in 2004 and 2008, these strategies are specific, and they reflect institutional and national choices rather than global approaches, with two or three common or comparable projects (PubMed Central, national repositories, attribution of DOIs to datasets, dissertations and other objects). In spite of all differences, their development reveals some common features, like budget cuts, legal barriers (copyright), focus on domestic needs and open access policies to foster dissemination and impact of research results. Document supply for corporate customers tends to become a business-to-business service, while the delivery for the public sector relies more, than before, on resource sharing and networking with academic and public libraries. Except perhaps for the TIB Hannover, the declining importance of grey literature points towards their changing role – less intermediation, less acquisition and collection development and more high-value services, more dissemination and preservation capacities designed for the scientific community needs (research excellence, open access, data management, etc.).

40|$|This {{analysis}} {{is based on}} the classification of the systems GreyNet, OpenSIGLE, Czech ASEP, RIV and others. During the analysis of the lists of document types, we have discovered that these typologies contain, besides "real" document types (reports, theses, etc.) other aspects, such as events (arrangement, organization), types of events (conferences, speeches), producers (universities, institutes), processes (translations, output), content (political documents, legal texts), location (domestic, foreign), and format (e-texts, numeric data). However, this approach is not systematic. Therefore, we have decided to create a classification scheme for document types only, and classify other aspects into various groups in order to define them more precisely. The scheme will be processed in a text version as well as schematically in mind maps. We believe that identifying a specific typology for credible <b>grey</b> literature <b>document</b> types, particularly reports, conference proceedings, and government documents, will assist in the classification of grey literature in the fields of science, research, and education. On the other hand, grey literature also consists of various means of communication, such as telephone calls, meetings, e-mails, blogs, interviews, social networking tools, or discussions in Wiki. It is important to identify only credible document types and not use unverified information that may be unsuitable for scientific work. The aim of this {{analysis is}} therefore to create, define, and implement a current credible <b>grey</b> literature <b>document</b> typology, in order to open discussions in the grey literature community, leading to a means of collecting GL from reputable events and producers rather than relying on social networking tools or Wiki contributions. While the later types of sources can assist researchers, scientists, and teachers with their information-seeking pursuits, document of this nature needs to be evaluated on a regular basis.

40|$|Our {{contribution}} summarizes {{and describes}} activities concerning grey {{literature in the}} Czech Republic. The managing organisation of the activity is the State Technical Library (henceforth the STL); in the past, it was the STL, who was collecting, publishing and submitting grey literature into the SIGLE system. Moreover, the STL was {{the representative of the}} Czech Republic in the EAGLE. Now, EAGLE being extinct, there is no coordinated collection of grey literature on the national level since 2005. The STL makes up the role of the Czech National Library, which under the National Digital Library project, aims at accessibility of wide spread published documents ("white literature"). On the other hand, the STL intends to deal with literature not acquired through normal bookselling channels (grey literature) and initiated a project for grey literature retrieval. The project - National Repository of Grey Literature (henceforth NRGL) - has been supported by the Ministry of Culture. Its main objective is formation of a digital repository of grey literature in the Czech Republic. The project aims at gathering metadata and possibly full texts of <b>grey</b> <b>documents</b> in the field of education, science and research. NRGL shall solve the typology of documents gathered, metadata formats, persistent identifiers, intellectual property issues, soft- and hardware support, forming a network of collaborating institutions etc. There has been established a close collaboration with representatives of Czech universities, who face the issue of storing university qualification theses {{which is one of the}} segments of typology of documents collected by NRGL. The National Registry of University Qualification Theses shall become a component of NRGL. The STL has also got in touch with further issuers of grey literature in the Czech Republic, in particular research institutes of the Czech Academy of Sciences, the institution covering a major part of production of grey literature in the segment of research and development. NRGL should make it possible to research the data on grey literature in the Czech Republic at one spot with a single interface, as well as to retrieve the information on the owner of the document and if possible, the full text of the document, either in electronic form or through the contemporary network of libraries (interlibrary loan, Virtual Polytechnic Library, Document Delivery Service etc.). The NRGL project does not assume retrospective digitalisation of <b>grey</b> literature <b>documents.</b> However, we intend to make NRLG be a trustworthy repository. The aim of the project is to provide services not to the NRGL contributors only, but also to the widest public. The STL has based the project on practice of universities which had already experience with local repositories. The entire NRGL project is consulted with the National Library of the Czech Republic as a part of the National Digital Library project.

The use of Information Extraction (IE), a Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique is central to the annotation process. The paper explores the use of Ontology Oriented Information Extraction (OOIE) methods for the definition of rich semantic-aware indices of archaeology documents. The annotation process follows a rule-based information extraction approach using GATE. In particular the report discusses a prototype development that adopts the core ontology, CIDOC CRM, together with an English Heritage archaeological extension, to inform and direct the information extraction effort.

40|$|Next to journal {{articles}} and eprints electronic theses and dissertations (ETD) {{are the most}} frequent document type found in open archives, for various reasons: - ETD's are a well defined and well referenced document type. Rules for deposit and citation are generally established on a national level, and international standards exist for specific information and theses metadata, contrary to other <b>grey</b> <b>documents.</b> - ETD's are administrative documents, and students can be "obliged" to deposit their work in an archive or repository for formal reasons. The paper describes some tendancies concerning electronic theses and dissertations in Europe as observed during explorations of institutional and other repositories, with specific regard to the full text. In the first part we examine the changing landscape in repositories where access to the complete full text of a thesis no longer is the unique offer, but where we also find partial access, temporary embargoes and bibliographic citations only. The increase {{of the number of}} items seems thus somewhat couterbalanced by a decrease in "quality". In the second part, we {{take a closer look at}} the language issue of ETDs. If the technical open access to the full text of ETDs is increasing, it doesn't necessarily imply an easier access (i. e. readability) for everyone, since the language barrier may still exist. Can the "accessibility" be increased by choosing the right language? Today we observe a growing number of ETDs written in English, the vernacular language for scientific research. But who writes in English? In this paper we explore the phenomenon under different aspects. - Are there differences between disciplines? - Are foreign students more inclined to write in English? - Does the participation in international projects influence the choice of language? - Can legal aspects or national recommendations create obstacles? The growing complexity of the ETD landscape calls for explicit policies to inform the user of a given repository as well as for tools such as directories providing detailed information on a general level.

40|$|BDSP (Public Health Databank) is {{a network}} of {{institutions}} initiated 20 {{years ago by the}} French ministry of health. Its aim is to collect and provide access to documents on public health topics, with specific attention to grey literature published in French. 40 organizations participate in this open and collaborative network, including the stakeholders of the French health system and from other French-speaking countries. It is managed by a team of 4 members of the EHESP School of Public Health. The network produces a multiservice portal which includes a bibliographic database with more than 470, 000 records and 64, 000 fulltext documents online. It also offers a multilingual glossary and a thesaurus in public health. The website receives about 3000 visits per day. BDSP is a unique product by its “construction”, its contents and its scope. Its flexible organization has allowed for many adaptations and extensions over the past 20 years, aiming to cover all fields on public health. The bibliographic database offers access to an important number of <b>grey</b> <b>documents</b> published by the main French organizations involved in public health, research units or government agencies, at both a national and regional level. The documents include expert’s reports, summary reports, policies, theses and dissertations. Participation in the BDSP network allows its members to archive their grey publications and data, to increase their visibility, to share current awareness tasks and exchange bibliographic records or documents as well as best practices. Working in a network further helps to deal with obstacles in managing grey literature such as insufficient recognition of the documents compared to journal articles, difficulties to obtain authorizations for the dissemination (in particular for government agencies) and {{to keep up with the}} rapid evolution of knowledge. At present the network explores ways to extend its cooperation with other French speaking countries and to share grey literature in French.

40|$|The International Association of Agricultural Librarians and Documentalists (IAALD) has {{understood}} {{since its}} creation (in 1955) that {{the access to}} the primary documents and namely for the non-conventional ones is essetial in agriculture for everyone in all countries all over the world, and that the 2500 agricultural libraries (in 1980) need an internationally supported structure {{in order to promote}} their cooperation. AGLINET (AGricultural LIbrary NETwork) was crete in November 1971, under the coordination of David Lubin library of the FAO. The principle of the system is the reciprocal non commercial availability of catalogs and the photocopy supplying or lending services. In the same period the need for an agricultural bibliographic database, accessible in the developing countries is discussed by IAALD conference. AGRIS is create in 1974 under FAO coordination. Its principle is the participation of a great nomber of countries by putting into the database the bibliographic descriptions of the conventional, but also non-conventional literature issued on their own territory. The national and international centres are responsible for collecting and making available the national and international output of grey literature. Since the beginning of AGRIS a special tag pointing non conventional documents is create (the bibliographic indicator V) and a field in the bibliographic description receives the complete address of availability. The reciprocal convention which relies all AGRIS participants to provide each other the primary documents hold by the country of origin reinforces the work of AGLINET. The second common AGLINETcatalogue of periodicals (1985) comprised the 3700 titles most frequently cited in AGRIS, with their location in the AGLINET libraries. Participation to AGRIS has permitted the developing countries to became conscians of the importance of their own grey litterature and also create their own national agricultural bibliography. From 1975 to now, near 400 000 descriptions of <b>grey</b> <b>documents</b> are present in AGRIS database (20 per cent of all the descriptions). An analysis of the document types, country of origin, annaual increase and their occurrence in CAB is given. Includes : Conference preprint, Pratt student commentaryXAInternationa...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{technology}} for networked information services, developed at the CERN Document Server (CDS) research group, called the CERN Document Server Software (CDSware). Standardization of networked information services {{in the field of}} grey literature has recently become a subject of an intensive research in the digital library community. The current state-of-the-art in this area effectively allows to provide various networked information services, such as information brokering or other value-added services upon distributed or federated data. This refers specifically to a variety of newly developed frameworks, such as the Open Archives initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAi-PMH). The CDSware technology offers a comprehensive solution for a document management of a large <b>grey</b> literature <b>document</b> repository, compliant with a variety of networking standards essential for a wide deployment of networked information services.

40|$|Wife of Admiral Sir Frederick Grey, Commander of the Cape of Good Hope and South Coast of Africa Station (a title changed, {{immediately}} on his arrival, to the West Coast of Africa Station), Lady Barbarina Grey left behind both a journal, the extracts {{of which have}} appeared in a published family chronicle, and also some 93 letters to her husband's cousin, Countess Maria. Today the letters are housed in Durham University special collections. Extracts from both have been edited by Andrew L. Harington and published by the South African Library (1997). Harington came across Lady Grey's archives accidentally, but he is keen to reproduce a combined record that focusses on the Greys' sojourn at the Cape: those letters and journal entries, in other words, {{that focus on the}} Cape itself. The record is still fairly slight, but there is some remarkable material, particularly in the tantalising references to Lady Eliza Grey (no relation, but so elusive in the historical record compared with her husband, the Governor of the Cape, Sir George Grey). Lady Barbarina <b>Grey</b> <b>documents</b> her travels on the peninsula and inland [...] visits to the usual colonial sites of Table Mountain and the Moravian mission station of Genadendal. For health reasons (risks of disease), she is advised not to accompany Sir Frederick on his tours of duty to West Africa. She does however take significant voyages with him east to Knysna and then, further into the Indian Ocean, to Mauritius and Madagascar and other nearby islands. But for all this it would seem, based on Harington's book, that Lady Grey's record is not written primarily offshore. Considering Sir Frederick's profession, {{and the fact that they}} are resident at Admiralty House in Simon's Bay rather than in Cape Town, to what extent does the 'coastal zone' of the south coast of Africa feature in her writings? This paper, which forms part of my larger project on British women writing colonial South Africa, looks at a selection of actual letters from the Durham special collections and assesses Lady Grey's engagement with the sea and all matters nautical. It also considers more critically other circuits of travel that she encountered as hostess: the traffic of visitors that included, for example, the legendary Dr Livingstone...|$|R
40|$|The rate of {{acquisition}} of data, its structuring into information and its interpretation as knowledge is increasing rapidly. There are more active researchers {{now than ever}} and the output of white publications per researcher is increasing. The output of grey publications is orders of magnitude greater. Past techniques of experts (librarians) cataloguing manually with metadata each publication do not scale. The problem is {{to find ways to}} manage this resource. The hypothesis is in 4 parts: (a) that the R&D process itself provides some context for managing the information; (b) that linking the records of the process to the publications provides this context; (c) that questions of curation and provenance are addressed automatically in such an environment; (d) that such an environment integrates grey and white literature and other R&D outputs such as software, data, products and patents. At UiB the emphasis of the work has been on assessment of the research output - especially publications - linked in context with records of the researchers, their organisational units, and related CRIS (Current Research Information System) information (the FRIDA system which is mostly CERIF-compatible). At CCLRC the emphasis of the work has been on the production of an open access repository of publication outputs from the organisation (ePubs), linked to the CERIFcompatible CDR (Corporate Data Repository) CRIS and thus to other research outputs with associated metadata. The recording of the data provides the context including the workflow of the R&D process, history and provenance. <b>Grey</b> <b>documents</b> produced as early ideas are captured in a temporal and organisational context, just as well as white publications, via the linked repository. CERIF allows, in a multidimensional framework, deduction or induction of relationships between documents, for example between a grey internal report and a white published paper - and with other research outputs. Furthermore, relationships between documents can be expressed explicitly: references and / or citations can be recorded. In this way a rich context for understanding the R&D output is provided, including versions, history and provenance. Recording facts once in a structured R&D process environment and then re-using them in many ways reduces - by automated provision assistance - the need for user input of metadata to describe research outputs (especially grey literature) and thus addresses the scalability problem.

40|$|Adaptation {{is a key}} {{component}} of climate policy, yet we have limited and fragmented understanding of if and how adaptation is currently taking place. In this paper, we document and characterize the current status of adaptation in 47 vulnerable ‘hotspot’ nations in Asia and Africa, based on a systematic review of the peer-reviewed and grey literature, as well as policy documents, to extract evidence of adaptation initiatives. In total, 100 peer-reviewed articles, 161 <b>grey</b> literature <b>documents,</b> and 27 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change National Communications were reviewed, constituting 760 adaptation initiatives. Results indicate a significant increase in reported adaptations since 2006. Adaptations are primarily being reported from African and low-income countries, particularly those nations receiving adaptation funds, involve a combination of groundwork and more concrete adaptations to reduce vulnerability, and are primarily being driven by national governments, NGOs, and international institutions, with minimal involvement of lower levels of government or collaboration across nations. Gaps in our knowledge of adaptation policy and practice are particularly notable in North Africa and Central Asia, and there is limited evidence of adaptation initiatives being targeted at vulnerable populations including socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, children, indigenous peoples, and the elderly...|$|R
