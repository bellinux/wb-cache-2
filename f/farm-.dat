40|$|Summary Harvest weed {{seed control}} (HWSC) {{is a new}} {{approach}} which targets weed seed removal and/or destruction during the crop harvest operation. The success of HWSC is dependant upon weed seed retention at harvest. To identify and define the poten-tial value of HWSC in northern farming systems, we conducted a field survey. In total 1400 transects across 70 paddocks assessed weed distribution, density and seed production at harvest time in wheat, chickpea and sorghum crops. Seventy weed species were identified, of which many had large seed numbers retained at crop harvest. The most prevalent included common sowthistle, flaxleaf fleabane, awnless barnyard grass, wild oat, and African turnip weed. Our field survey has shown there is a role for HWSC in the northern <b>farm-ing</b> system. Therefore the efficacy of specific HWSC systems on problematic weeds should be evaluated in the northern region...|$|R

Conservation initiatives linked to precision <b>farm-ing</b> is an apt mechanism to minimize the loss of natural resources of agricultural landscapes to maintain the complex stabilizers of ecological functions.

A commercial organic poultry agro-forestry system was developed for Sheepdrove Organic Farm, Berk-shire, UK, affording the benefits of an agro-forestry system, whilst retaining commercial viability. Five avenues of highly diverse parallel hedges incorporat-ing tree, shrub and herb species were planted. On-going monitoring of the system {{was put in place}} to evaluate its development. The programme consists of monitoring: 1) biodiversity 2) soil nutrient status and respiration 3) behaviour and welfare of the poultry. Conventionally profits tend to be viewed purely in terms of economic gain. However in an organic <b>farm-ing</b> system more emphasis is placed on the intrinsic and sustainable qualities it has.

It was certain that he was the representative of a family which had been settled at Beechcroft ever since the Norman Conquest, and Lily was very proud of the name of Sir William de Moune in the battle roll, and of Sir John among the first Knights of the Garter. Her favourite was Sir Maurice, who had held out Beechcroft Court for six weeks against the Roundheads, and had seen the greater part of the walls battered down. Witnesses of the strength of the old castle yet remained in the massive walls and broad green ramparts, which enclosed what was now orchard and <b>farm-</b> yard, and was called the Old Court, while the dwelling-house, built by Sir Maurice after the Restoration, was named the New Court. Sir Maurice had lost many an acre in the cause of King Charles, and his new mansion was better suited to the honest squires who succeeded him, than to the mighty barons his ancestors. It was substantial and well built, with a square gravelled court in front, and great, solid, folding gates opening into a lane, bordered with very tall well- clipped holly hedges, forming a polished, green, prickly wall. There was a little door in one of these gates, which was scarcely ever shut, from whence a well-worn path led to the porch, where generally reposed a huge Newfoundland dog, guardian of the hoops and walkingsticks that occupied the corners. The front door was of heavy substantial oak, studded with nails, and never closed in the daytime, and the hall, wainscoted and floored with slippery oak, had a noble open fireplace, with a wood fire burning on the hearth.|$|E

Hunting spiders, which tend to have lower dispersal capabilities, had higher activity density, and more species were captured, on organic compared to conven-tional farms.
