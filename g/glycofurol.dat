40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The {{organic solvent}} dimethyl-sulfoxide (DMSO), as a {{commonly}} used vehicle for nonadhesive liquid embolics, is not devoid of local angiotoxic effects. We compared microvascular toxicities of superselective infusions of DMSO with potentially more compatible sol-vents in swine rete mirabile. METHODS: Fourteen swine underwent angiography for superselective catheterization of 28 arteries of the rete while electrocardiography and intra-arterial pressure were continuously monitored. The investigated solvents were DMSO, dimethyl isosorbide (DMI), ethyl lactate, <b>glycofurol</b> 75, N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP), and solketal. Control infusion of saline ruled out catheter induced vasospasm in all cases. Each artery of the rete was infused only once with 0. 8 mL {{of one of}} the solvents over 60 seconds. Acute angiographic and hemodynamic consequences were evaluated. Blood samples were assessed for signs of intravascular hemolysis. Brains and retia were harvested for gross and his-topathologic investigation. RESULTS: On the basis of the angiographic data, DMSO induced the most pronounced vasospasm with the longest recovery period of all solvents investigated. Ethyl lactate, <b>glycofurol</b> 75, and solketal elicited less severe vasospasms and accordingly resolved much more quickly. DMI and NMP induce...|$|E

Cloyd. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xvi, 185 pages, appendix p. 181 - 185. The use of rectal diazepam has improved {{the management of}} acute repetitive seizures (ARS) outside a health care facility. Two placebo controlled trials have shown that rectal administration of diazepam is safe and effective for treatment of this condition. Diastat® is the only FDA approved treatment for ARS in the United States. Although some older children and adults are willing to use Diastat®, many patients in these age {{groups as well as}} physicians and caregivers object to the route of administration and instead use other therapies not approved for this purpose, receive no treatment, or use emergency medical services or acute care systems. We developed and evaluated three nasal spray formulations of diazepam which can be easily administered with rapid absorption characteristics intended as an alternative to rectal administration. One formulation used a supersaturated <b>glycofurol</b> based co-solvent system while the remaining two (Nas-A & Nas-B) used microemulsion based co-solvent systems. These formulations were studied for their pharmacokinetics and tolerability in healthy adult volunteers. Data from these studies were then compared to the pharmacokinetics after rectal administration using both model-based analysis (NONMEM) and graphical methods. The primary finding from this work was that, only the microemulsion-based formulations, particularly Nas-B could be used for further development as the <b>glycofurol</b> formulation was not well tolerated by subjects. The pharmacokinetic profiles after intranasal administration were associated with high variability. However, we are able to show that the dose-normalized partial area under the curve (AUC - an exposure parameter) after nasal administration, at times when the drug concentrations are most important, are 60 - 80 % of that when given via the rectal route. Given the ease and social acceptability of nasal administration compared to rectal, equivalent exposures can be easily attained by giving a second nasal dose, and we thus conclude that intranasal diazepam is a feasible and preferable alternative to rectal diazepam in the management of ARS outside a hospital. This work also provides some recommendations for future studies in the development of an intranasal product...|$|E

Blood and tissue concns. of tacrolimus from two study groups (oral application of SMEDDS Tac and Prograf) were detd. using ELISA technique following tacrolimus administration in rats.

Maximum concns. of the drug were three times higher (P < 0. 05) in the SEDDM Tac group accompanied by a 3 -fold earlier peak time. Elimination half-life was significantly lower in the SEDDM Tac group. Application of SMEDDS Tac increased tissue accumulation.

Intravenously and orally four dose levels were administered. BaF was dissolved in soybean oil for oral administration, and in <b>glycofurol</b> for intravenous administration. The doses were such, that the absolute oral bioavailability could be calculated for two dose levels. The plasma pharmacokinetics of BaP after intravenous administration were described by a two-compartment model. The corresponding kinetic parameters were calculated. The elimination half-life of BaP was approx. 30 - 60 min. in the period 0 - 12 h after administration. Therefore, unchanged BaP will not accumulate after repeated administration, when it is administered once daily. The AUC values (area under the plasma concentration-time curve) increased more than proportionally with the oral or intravenous dose. The deviation from linearity was small for the doses used in this study. After oral administration multiple plasma concentration maxima were observed, which {{may be explained by}} an interaction of the oil solution with the bile. The absolute oral bioavailability of unchanged BaP was approx. 13 % for a dose of 1 mg/kg and approx. 4 % for a dose of 5 mg/kg. This does not mean, that the absorption of BaP decreased with increasing doses, because the non-linear increase of the AUC values with the dose may be explained by saturation of metabolism. The kinetic parameters and the oral bioavailability were in the same range as found in the literature for other rat species...|$|E
40|$|Generally, organic water-miscible {{solvents}} {{are used}} intravascularly (both intravenously and intra-arterially) for preparing {{two types of}} formulations, namely, pharmaceutical injections of poorly soluble drugs and precipitating liquid embolic polymeric materials for the minimally invasive treatment of aneurysms, arteriovenous malformations, or tumors, by arterial route. Although several of such solvents {{have been used in}} both drug delivery and interventional radiology, their safety profile is a concern. In particular, {{there is a lack of}} comparative investigations of their cardiovascular effects when injected intra-arterially. We selected 13 non-aqueous water-miscible solvents based on their capacity to solubilize drugs or embolic polymeric materials, and on their described use, at least diluted with water, in pharmaceutical formulations. Their in vivo hemodynamic toxicity in male adult sheep after infra-renal aorta catheterization has been estimated with respect to the arterial and venous pressures, as well as the heart rate. Saline solution was used as a control. Three different volumes (0. 1, 0. 5, and 1. 0 mL) were infused rapidly. An increase in arterial pressure and concomitant decrease in venous pressure, which we considered as signs of a cardiovascular toxicity, were observed to a differing extent for all organic solvents. Changes in heart rate were negligible. Based on the intensity of arterial pressure change after a 1 -mL infusion, a classification of the toxicity of the solvents following intra-arterial infusion is proposed: Solvents devoid of significant cardiovascular toxicity: dimethyl isosorbide (DMI), <b>Glycofurol</b> 75, polyethylene glycol 200 (PEG 200), diglyme. Solvents with moderate cardiovascular toxicity: tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA), ethanol, acetone, Solketal, glycerol formal, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Solvents with marked cardiovascular toxicity: propylene glycol, ethyl lactate, N-methyl- 2 -pyrrolidone (NMP). Emphasis is put on the relative character of the proposed ranking and on the lack for certain solvents, at least in the open literature, of data pertaining at other forms of toxic effects (e. g., undesirable pharmacological action, carcinogenicity, teratogenicity, mutagenicity, and irritating and sensitizing properties), all factors that have to be considered when selecting a proper solvent...|$|E

Methods: Excipients used for enhancing the solubility and stability of sirolimus were screened. A phase-separation test, visual observation for emulsifying efficiency, and droplet size analysis were performed. Ternary phase diagrams were constructed to optimize the liquid SMEDDS formulation. The selected liquid SMEDDS formulations were prepared into solid form. The dissolution profiles and pharmacokinetic profiles in rats were analyzed. Results: In the results of the oil and cosolvent screening studies, Capryol™ Propylene glycol monocaprylate (PGMC) and <b>glycofurol</b> exhibited the highest solubility of all oils and cosolvents, respectively. In the surfactant screening test, D-α-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (vitamin E TPGS) was determined to be the most effective stabilizer of sirolimus in pH 1. 2 simulated gastric fluids. The optimal formulation determined by the construction of ternary phase diagrams was the T 32 (Capryol™ PGMC:glycofurol:vitamin E TPGS = 30 : 30 : 40 weight ratio) formulation with a mean droplet size of 108. 2 ± 11. 4 nm. The solid SMEDDS formulations were prepared with Sucroester 15 and mannitol. The droplet size of the reconstituted solid SMEDDS showed no significant difference compared with the liquid SMEDDS. In the dissolution study, the release amounts of sirolimus from the SMEDDS formulation were significantly higher than the raw sirolimus powder. In addition, the solid SMEDDS formulation was in a more stable state than liquid SMEDDS in pH 1. 2 simulated gastric fluids. The results of the pharmacokinetic study indicate that the SMEDDS formulation shows significantly greater bioavailability than the raw sirolimus powder or commercial product (Rapamune® oral solution).

40|$|Intracranial aneurysms do {{not usually}} become {{clinically}} apparent before their rupture. This medical emergency {{is connected with}} high morbidity and mortality. An aneurysm rupture is typically accompanied by a subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) as bleeding in the external CSF spaces between the arachnoid und pia mater. The primary aim when treating a patient with aneurismal SAH is the speedy elimination of the ruptured aneurysm {{in order to prevent}} an often fatal recurrence of the haemorrhaging. In order to achieve this there are essentially two treatment options available: endoluminal sealing through the vascular system by placing coils into the aneurysm or operative microsurgical elimination using vascular clips. The superiority of the endovascular method was demonstrated in the ISAT (International Subarachnoid Aneurysm Trial) study. In this study endovascular coiling was associated with a lower 30 -day mortality whereby there was a slightly increased rate of renewed haemorrhaging. The group which was treated endovascularly also showed a significantly lower 5 -year mortality risk. An important limitation of coil embolization is, however, the relatively high rate of incompletely closed aneurysms, particularly in the case of wide-necked and large or giant aneurysms. The use of liquid embolics can be advantageous especially in those cases in which theoretically independent of the aneurysm configuration the complete filling of the aneurysm with an embolic can be achieved. Onyx® (ev 3 Inc., Irvine, USA) is the only commercially available precipitating liquid embolic which can be used for the treatment of cerebral aneurysms as well as for arteriovenous malformations. The polymer is composed of two subunits, hydrophobic ethylene and hydrophilic vinyl alcohol (ethylene-vinyl-alcohol-copolymer, EVAL). This is dissolved in the organic solvent dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). To achieve radiopacity tantalum is added to the mixture. When coming into contact with blood, DMSO diffuses into its surroundings. This process takes place on the surface within seconds so that a thermosetting polymer surface, with a core that is still soft, is formed, similar to cooling lava. An embolus of any size can be formed at the catheter tip through careful and very controlled renewed injection until the breaking of this crust. It is indeed the case that for difficult aneurysms superior occlusion rates can be achieved when using Onyx® in comparison to coil embolization, while treatment related morbidity is comparably low. However, there are several disadvantages so that the search for a more suitable substance mixture should continue. For example, elaborate preparation including heating, shaking and reheating before the application of the mixture is necessary in order to improve its rheology and to ensure homogenous radiopacity. A sedimentation of tantalum during the preparation process cannot be excluded which could cause inhomogenous radiopacity with potential nontarget embolizations. Furthermore, angiotoxic reactions triggering vasospasms with fatal clinical consequences such as apoplexy and subarachnoid haemorrhaging have been described in cases where a rapid intra-arterial injection of the solvent DMSO took place. Thus, the aim of this paper was the identification and experimental testing of a new precipitating liquid embolic which would have simpler and, therefore, safer applicability together with improved biocompatibility. For this purpose a new type of polymer was synthesized on the basis of EVAL with iodine-containing side chains (I-PVA). The highly viscid mixture of I-PVA and the solvent DMSO showed in vitro a sufficient intrinsic radiopacity without adding any further radiopaque substances. It could easily be injected using a micro-catheter and demonstrated good precipitation properties. The suitability of this mixture as a precipitating liquid embolic was examined on 12 experimentally generated wide-necked carotid sidewall aneurysms in swine. The endovascular application was performed using transfemoral access with a DMSO-resistent micro-catheter and temporary balloon occlusion of the carrier vessel {{at the level of the}} aneurysm base. ECG and blood pressure and the hemolysis parameters Hb, fHb and LDH were determined for the assessment of systemic effects. For non-invasive imaging, a multisection CT-angiography immediately before and after the intervention and a follow-up examination using MRI were performed. For invasive imaging, a control angiography was carried out. In the macroscopic analysis the distribution of the liquid embolic and the morphology of the aneurysm base were evaluated. In the microscopic analysis a histopathological examination was carried out with the following parameters: intra-aneurysmal liquid distribution, extent of inflammation inside the aneurysm, occurrence of an accompanying foreign-body reaction, connective tissue formation and a neointima formation at the former aneurysm orifice. The degree of inflammatory response was divided into a five point score. In addition, the local angiotoxicity of DMSO and numerous other organic solvents was examined in swine rete mirabile, an upstream capillary network of the circulus arteriosus (circle of Willisi), via a superselective catherization of the ascending pharyngeal artery (i. e. the artery of the rete). A direct comparison was carried out between the local changes (angiographically measured degree of vasospasms), systemic hemodynamic (blood pressure, heart frequency, ECG), laboratory chemical (hemolysis) and histopathological changes (epithelial damages, angionecroses, fibrin deposits, cellular inflammations and microbleeds) after the injection of the respective potentially more compatible solvents. Finally the innovation of the intrinsically radiopaque polymer (I-PVA) was combined with a low angiotoxic carrier substance (NMP) to form a new precipitating liquid embolic. This was tested on the known experimental aneurysm model in order to confirm its suitability as a liquid embolic. The evaluation was performed in the same way as the initial examinations. The result of the first study, in which I-PVA dissolved in DMSO was tested for the liquid embolization of surgically constructed wide-necked aneurysms, showed that I-PVA is perfectly suited for controlled intra-aneurysmal application. As a ready-to-use mixture it has sufficient visibility under fluoroscopy and displays a homogenous radiopacity. Initially, an average occlusion rate of aneurysms of 96 % was achieved; after four weeks a complete occlusion of all successfully treated aneurysms was confirmed. A rate of primary complete aneurysm occlusions of 67 % was obtained. This was achieved despite one occurrence of polymer migration into the carrier vessel due to a DMSO-related catheter leakage with consecutive arterial occlusion (from then on all the catheters used were DMSO-resistant) and two occurrences of minimal polymer migration without significant vascular stenosis. In one case a partially embolized aneurysm occurred due to a thrombus at the catheter tip. The macroscopic and microscopic examination of the resected aneurysms showed to a large extent a complete coating of the aneurysm base with a neointima consisting of newly formed fibroblasts, covered by a single layer of endothelial cells. The histological examination confirmed the good biocompatibility of I-PVA. As no radiopaque metallic mixtures were needed for the application, the follow-up examinations of the treated aneurysms could be performed using CT and MR angiography without artifacts. In the second study a comparative examination was performed regarding the angiotoxicity of the organic solvents DMI (dimethyl isosorbide), DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide), ethyl lactate, <b>Glycofurol</b> 75 ® (tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol polyethyleneglycol ether), NMP and Solketal® (isopropylidene glycerol) in swine rete mirabile. Compared to DMSO, DMI and NMP triggered a significantly lower vasospasm without any indication of a systemic or histopathological toxicity and were, thus, better suited as organic solvents for precipitating liquid embolics. Finally, in the third study, the successful application of I-PVA dissolved in NMP for liquid embolization of experimental wide-necked aneurysms could be demonstrated. Its favorable precipitation dynamics allowed for a very controlled intra-aneurysmal polymer delivery, which resulted in a high initial occlusion rate of 98 % and no technical difficulties were encountered. Only in one case was a small leakage of the embolic into the artery lumen observed which did not lead to an immediate or later stenosis. Hemodynamics and hemolysis parameters were normal. The macroscopic examination showed that all aneurysms were covered with a smooth layer of connective tissue and the histopathological examination confirmed the formation of neointima with a slightly reactive tissue response. After four weeks, complete occlusion could be demonstrated using conventional angiography as well as multisection CT angiography and MR imaging without artifacts. Thus, the aneurysms could be discriminated well from the parent artery which allowed for a precise and detailed depiction of the embolized aneurysm in axial sectional images and in 3 D reconstructions with high spatial resolution. In summary, it can be seen that I-PVA dissolved in NMP is a new and promising precipitating liquid embolic for the neurointerventional treatment of wide-necked intracranial aneurysms. It can be applied as a ready-to-use product and it shows good radiopacity under fluoroscopy and enables a simplified artifact-free examination via CT and MRI. The low toxic solvent minimizes unwanted side effects...|$|E
