The relevance of the work {{stems from the fact}} that the modern and perspective requirements to the track maintenance in the conditions of the transition to high-speed, high-speed, high-tonnage traffic can be implemented only by switching to a new system of track maintenance based on the performance of work of specialized high-performance machines and on the new system with maximum opportunity for automation technology. More than half of the volume of works on the current maintenance of the tracks are the works on the removal of splashes, straightening and tamping of track, the technology of which can be divided into two components: calculation-evaluation and the generation of control actions on the railway track. Track machines are used extensively at the local bearing places of the occurrence of splashes on track sections or for continuous bearing plot ways to restore the equal elasticity of the undersleeper base and reduce the degree of non-uniformity deviations in rails’ position on level and in plan, as well as track subsidence. The bunker for filling the ballast may be mounted on additional frame or on offset brackets of the machine. The device for measuring the position of a railway track includes the means for measuring the deflections of the road, bending rise the track in the longitudinal profile and the position of the track on level (elevation of one rail in relation to another) and the adjacent block determining the actual position of a railway track in plan, in longitudinal profile and on level. The block of determining the amount of ballast consists of interconnected devices for determining the value of shifts and raise of the track and the block of comparing the track raise values with determining the amount necessary for filling of ballast. A device for determining the magnitudes of the shifts and the track raise consists of the interconnected unit for comparing the actual position of the track with a given (estimated) position of the track and a block determining the values of the track shifts and raise, which also provides the conversion of the recorded deflections of the track in the longitudinal profile in the track subsidence. The block comparing the track raise values with determining the amount necessary for filling the ballast, compares the magnitude of the track raise, determines changes in the transverse area of a prism in case of track raise and determines the amount needed for ballast filling. It also controls the control unit of the device for filling the ballast. The authors developed and tested the schemes of using the elements of technological processes automation during the operation of <b>hopper</b> <b>dispenser</b> with the track surfacing, which will allow reducing the duration of track possessions and will speed up the track maintenance...|$|E
40|$|Bulk solids {{technology}} plays a {{key part}} in manufacturing process when handled material is an assembly of solid particles in large quantities. Micro-dispensing technology for bulk solids can improve operation efficiency in dispensing relatively small amount of material. The demand for the technology covers {{a wide range of}} areas where materials have diverse flow behaviours and flow problems due to different physical properties. This Ph. D. project aims to investigate bulk solids flow behaviour and fluidizing mechanism in a hopper under the influence of vibration, and to develop a bulk solids micro-dispensing technique to demonstrate the dispensing process of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API), excipients and biomaterials. Experiment work in this project includes design of vibratory <b>dispenser</b> <b>hopper</b> and dispensing test with vibratory dispensers where mechanical vibration and ultrasonic vibration is utilized as the driving force to fluidize coarse granules and fine powders, respectively. The results suggest that the vibratory dispenser is capable of accurately and fast dispensing “dropwise” bulk solid in a small amount per drop. A doming controlled flow mechanism is identified in the vibratory dispenser. Bulk solids dome formed in the <b>dispenser</b> <b>hopper</b> plays as a “valve” of flow under the influence of vibration. The dispensing test results show that the design parameters of <b>dispenser</b> <b>hopper,</b> i. e. orifice size, hopper angle and hopper diameter, and vibration signal parameters, i. e. frequency and amplitude, affect the flow rate and dosage conformity in the vibratory bulk solids micro-dispensing technique. Additionally, a triboelectric charging phenomenon is investigated in the ultrasonic vibration dispenser and a solution to the charging issue is proposed with modifying surfaces of <b>dispenser</b> <b>hopper</b> by using platinum plating method. Pt-coated surface reduces the triboelectric charge generated in the dispensing process and improves the flowability of powders. The correlation between discharge rate and design parameters of ultrasonic vibration dispenser is derived. The derived equations are used to predict dosing results in the application of producing solid form oral drugs and biomaterial dry powder libraries for high-throughput screening (HTS) experiment. <br/...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) {{acquired}} property {{in a rural}} area outside Poolesville, Maryland. The facility that was built on this property housed several research projects, including those headed by Calhoun. It was here that his most famous experiment, the mouse universe, was created. In July 1968 four pairs of mice were introduced into the habitat. The habitat was a 9 ft square metal pen with 4.5 ft sides. Each side had four groups of four vertical, wire mesh [...] "tunnels." [...] The [...] "tunnels" [...] gave access to nesting boxes, food <b>hoppers,</b> and water <b>dispensers.</b> There was no shortage of food or water or nesting material. There were no predators. The only adversity was the limit on space.|$|R
40|$|The {{essence of}} the new development, {{proposed}} by the co-authors, consists in the following engineering solution: a concrete spreader, designated for the molding of products {{to be made of}} concrete mixtures and composed of a self-moving gantry, is equipped with a hoisting smoothing mechanism and a cart having a travel mechanism that has a roll-over <b>hopper</b> and a <b>dispenser</b> with a shutter, that is kinematically connected to the power engine. The shutter has an elastoplastic lining. The hoisting smoothing mechanism represents a rack having rigidly connected top and bottom plates. The longitudinal groove of the smoothing plate has teeth with a conical body. The teeth are attached to the springs hinged to the bottom surface of the top plate rigidly connected to the rod of the hydrocylinder and a frame installed on the guide of the gantry. The proposed construction of the vibration-induced smoothing rack of a concrete spreader improves the quality of the smoothed surface of concrete mixtures thanks to the higher intensification and compaction of the concrete mixture surface because of deeper penetration of vibrations into inner concrete layers and higher pressure produced on the concrete mixture. Предложена новая конструкция бетоноукладчика с зубчатой виброзаглаживающей рейкой. Сущность разработки заключается в том, что в бетоноукладчике для формования изделий из бетонных смесей подъемно-опускаемый заглаживающий механизм выполнен в виде зубчатой рейки, имеющей верхнюю и заглаживающую плиты, жестко связанные между собой.
