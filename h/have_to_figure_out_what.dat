500|$|In April 2015, it was {{revealed}} that a settlement had been reached with The Gap Band's publishing company, Minder Music, to add The Gap Band and producer Lonnie Simmons as co-writers, who will receive 17% of the royalties from Mark and Mars' hit [...] "Uptown Funk". The claim on behalf of The Gap Band and Lonnie Simmons was entered into YouTube’s content management system preventing payments to the publisher. Later, on August 12, Serbian pop artist Viktorija has also argued that [...] "Uptown Funk" [...] infringed on her track [...] "Ulice mračne nisu za devojke". She stated that she had no hurry to sue them, since [...] "these processes take a long time, and my life and career does not depend on lawsuits." [...] She added, [...] "for these lawsuits, there should be a lot of money, the lawyers are working on a percentage.

His family was growing, and he was assisting with his brother Russell's Phat Farm clothing imprint, making Run-D.M.C. less of a priority. Aerosmith was beginning to discuss extending the successful tour, but while on the bus headed to another performance, Simmons {{announced that he was}} leaving and was not interested in returning.

Y'all <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> y'all are gonna do. Because I don't want to perform no more." [...] Despite the protests of McDaniels, Mizell, and Tyler, Simmons was adamant. Their touring career at the time seemed over, and it was uncertain whether the trio would ever record again.|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Guitar World in 2011 Fredrik states [...] "My dad always listened to jazz, and I guess that influenced me to learn about improvisation. An improvised solo sounds {{so much better than}} a written one. For me, there's not much thinking going on at all, only a reaction to what I'm being told from the inside. And no, I have not had any formal training. When I record my leads, they are usually based on feel and totally ignorant to all laws of music theory. This, of course, is because I just play whatever comes out. There are no rules. But on certain songs, I do <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> scales I need to use to follow chord changes. Since I'm not very good with all the scales, I sometimes have to write parts down and plan things ahead. I usually improvise the first part, then insert the written part and continue to improvise {{until the end of the}} solo. It's a very confusing way to do it, but I do whatever it takes to make it sound like I know what I'm doing".|$|E
5000|$|The University of Kansas' operatic {{version of}} the play premiered April 8, 2008.Librettist and stage {{director}} Tim Ocel recalled, [...] "When Forrest Pierce knocked on my door during the fall of 2006 and said he’d like to compose something for KU Opera, I jumped at the chance. The voice/opera division {{was just beginning to}} consider what our contribution to the 50th Murphy Hall celebration would be. I thought maybe we should create something; William Inge is the playwright and dramatic storyteller of 1950s Kansas, so why not explore the possibility of turning one of his plays into an opera? We both agreed that Picnic was the play that lent itself best to an operatic treatment. The libretto formed over the next six months, and by June 2007 Forrest was composing. The opera is a domestic comedy of sorts. Inge calls the play [...] "A Summer Romance." [...] It’s about everyday people... you and I... who <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> it means to be alive and connected and useful in this world.

5000|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Adam Raymond of New York Magazine conveyed his happiness about seeing trains in the episode: [...] "Before last night’s episode, I {{was ready to}} rename it Hell on Hooves because, you know, there are more horses than trains. But then 'Pride, Pomp and Circumstance' arrived bellowing enough black smoke to warrant {{a visit from the}} EPA." [...] TV Fanatic's Sean McKenna gave the episode almost 4 out of 5 stars: [...] "'Pride, Pomp and Circumstance' continued to move the show forward in its efforts to draw the characters closer towards a larger conflict ... Here's to hoping that {{the second half of the}} season begins to take all of those interesting story lines and make something of them." [...] Phil Nugent of The A.V. Club would prefer the series to center more on Cullen. [...] "The problem with giving the hero of a TV series a vengeance quest for his principal motivation is that, once it’s fulfilled, you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> he’s going to do next or the series has to end ... If the show becomes swamped by matters in which the man-of-action hero has no stake, then why should we care?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Another of Shusterman’s {{contributions}} {{to the theory of}} interpretation is his critique of a widely held view he calls ‘hermeneutic universalism’, and attributes to Hans-Georg Gadamer, Alexander Nehamas and Stanley Fish, among others. Agreeing with basic anti-foundationalist thrust of the hermeneutic universalists’ position, Shusterman simultaneously rejects their thesis that “to perceive, read, understand, or behave at all intelligently ... must always be to interpret” and seeks to refute it with many original arguments. He also insists that the notion of interpretation needs a contrasting category to guarantee its own meaningfulness. If everything is interpretation then the concept loses its point. Shusterman argues that immediate, non-interpretive understanding can serve that role of contrast. Inspired by Wittgenstein and Heidegger’s theory of hermeneutic circle, Shusterman proposes:“the immediacy of uninterrupted understandings of language (as when I immediately understand simple and pertinent utterances of a language I know well) and the mediacy of interpretations (as when I encounter an utterance or text that I do not understand in terms of word-meaning or contextual relevance and then <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> is meant)”.Among Shusterman’s achievements in the theory of interpretation, there are also the accounts of literary criticism he created in his earlier, analytic period, as well as his pragmatist arguments against interpretational intentionalism and his genealogical critique of deconstructionist (Harold Bloom’s, Jonathan Culler’s), analytic (Joseph Margolis’) and neo-pragmatist (Richard Rorty’s, Stanley Fish’s, Walter Benn Michaels and Steven Knapp’s) literary theories which, as he claims, are all governed at their core by an ideology of professionalism.|$|E
5000|$|On September 29, 2014, it was {{announced}} that Netflix and The Weinstein Company's Harvey Weinstein had made a deal to release the feature film Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon II: The Green Legend on Netflix. The sequel would be released via RADiUS-TWC simultaneously on Netflix and in selected IMAX theatres on August 28, 2015. The day after Netflix's announcement, American cinema chain Regal Entertainment Group announced that they would not show the film in their theaters. Regal's Russ Nunley declined to be part of [...] "an experiment where you can see the same product on screens varying from three stories tall to 3 inches wide on a smart phone", as opposed to a regular theater experience. The same day, AMC, Carmike Cinemas, Cinemark Theatres, and Cineworld also announced they would not show the film. IMAX's CEO Richard Gelfond argued on the rejection by some chains, saying, [...] "This is a test, and I can't tell you for sure that it's going to work, but I can tell you for sure that attempting to innovate is a good idea because as technology changes, viewers change, and we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> does or doesn't work". On July 7, 2015, the film was removed from the August 28, 2015 slot and was moved back to a fourth-quarter day and date release. A trailer for the film was released on December 7, 2015. The film was scheduled to be released in China on February 8, 2016, but was pushed back to February 19. The film was released worldwide outside China on Netflix and in 10-15 IMAX screens in the United States on February 26, 2016.|$|E

30|$|The {{other thing}} that I tell my friends a good deal, {{particularly}} talking about novelty, which is a direction we might go, is that until we get something analogous to Mendel (1866), something analogous to understanding the combinatorics of novelty, we’ll just talk about combinatorics but we won’t really {{get a grip on}} them.

In this paper I argue that this way of proceeding is full of traps and is bound to be pretty useless unless we already have a good idea of what sort of things there are, and of how we are going to count them. 1.
