5000|$|Agaricus abruptibulbus is {{a species}} of {{mushroom}} in the genus Agaricus. It {{is commonly known as}} the abruptly-bulbous agaricus or the flat-bulb mushroom. First described by the mycologist Charles Horton Peck, this bulbous-stemmed edible species smells slightly of anise, and turns yellow when bruised or cut. The mushroom is medium-sized, with a white, yellow-staining cap on a slender stipe that has a wide, <b>flat</b> <b>bulb</b> on the base ...|$|R

60|$|They {{passed through}} several such passages, {{and came out}} at last into a queer steel chamber with curved walls, almost spherical in shape, but presenting, with its tiers of benches, {{something}} of {{the appearance of a}} scientific lecture-theatre. There were no rifles or pistols in this apartment, but round the walls of it were hung more dubious and dreadful shapes, things that looked like the <b>bulbs</b> of <b>iron</b> plants, or the eggs of iron birds. They were bombs, and the very room itself seemed like the inside of a bomb. Syme knocked his cigar ash off against the wall, and went in.|$|R
50|$|In 1922 PTVGD {{started to}} {{manufacture}} phones. In 1924 it started producing crystal-detector radios. In 1928 it began producing automatic telephone exchanges. They bought the license from Mix & Genest to produce small volume (for 100, 200, 300 numbers) and large volume (1000, 2000 numbers) switchboards. Telephone exchange in Riga and Latvia's populated places were upgraded with equipment manufactured by PTVGD until 1940. During the 1930s the monthly production of PTVGD included 500 phones and 400 exchanges.By the 1930s the factory produced all electronics that had any market demand - communication devices, phones, light <b>bulbs,</b> cameras, <b>irons,</b> radios, flashlights, {{as well as}} photo paper, work-tables, and even airplanes. They also repaired cars.|$|R
50|$|Beijing's Inner city wall had gate towers {{that sat}} atop {{rectangular}} platforms 12 to 13 metres high {{integrated into the}} city walls. Each gate entranceway, centred under the middle of its gate tower platform, had two giant red wooden gates that opened outwards. <b>Iron</b> <b>bulbs</b> were fitted on the exterior side of the gates and gilt copper bulbs on the interior side. When the gates were closed they were locked with giant tree-trunk-sized wooden beams.|$|R
30|$|Waste glass has {{considerably}} {{contributed to}} the total solid wastes, which causes the awful waste of resources and serious environmental pollutions (Topçu et al. 2008). It is produced in many forms, including packaging or container glass, <b>flat</b> glass, <b>bulb</b> glass, and cathode ray tube glass, {{all of which have}} a limited life in the forms in which they are produced and need to be reused/recycled in order to avoid environmental problems that would be created {{if they are to be}} stockpiled or sent to landfills. It is noted that the incorporation of waste glass powder to cementitious composite, mainly cement mortar and concrete, is an effective solution for the recycling and utilization of waste glass (Avila-López et al. 2015; Ali and Al-Tersawy 2012). Theoretically, glass can be a 100 % recyclable material; it can be indefinitely recycled without any loss of quality (Sobolev et al. 2006).|$|R

50|$|A {{bulb keel}} is a keel, usually {{made with a}} high aspect ratio foil, that {{contains}} a ballast-filled bulb at the bottom, usually teardrop shaped. The purpose of the bulb keel is to place the ballast as low as possible, therefore gaining the maximum possible amount of leverage and thus the most righting moment. An example of a class of boats that use a bulb keel is the International 110 racing class, which uses a 300 lb (136 kg) cast <b>iron</b> <b>bulb</b> keel on a boat whose minimum racing weight is 910 lb (414 kg).|$|R
40|$|As {{the amount}} of {{activity}} in the Arctic increases, the response of ship structures to ice loading is becoming ever more important. Plastic limit states design is utilized {{for the design of}} ship structures for ice conditions. This thesis includes the discussion of full-scale laboratory experiments involving ice-structure interaction. Stiffened panels representative of full-scale polar ship structure are loaded with laboratory-grown ice blocks quasi-statically to extreme load levels. These experiments are unique in scale for a laboratory environment. Finite element analysis of the laboratory experiments is performed, and high fidelity is achieved. The close match between real-life results and finite element simulation validates the methods used in this thesis. Using the laboratory experiments as validation, the plastic response of polar class ship structure along the midbody ice belt of a longitudinally framed, PC 7, 12, 000 tonne ship is evaluated using finite element analysis. Different stiffener cross-section types are evaluated, including T-section, L-section, <b>bulb</b> <b>flat,</b> and flat bar-section. Full discussion of the results is included...|$|R
5000|$|Transitioning from {{hobbyist}} to horticulturist, Powell {{needed a}} way to forward his finds to researchers and preserve them for future reference. He studied the standardized method for specimen preservation and storage. Specimens were dried by extracting moisture in a device called a plant press; however in one instance he noted: [...] "Live flower mashed flat with finger." [...] Although he was initially cautioned against it, he added artificial heat (an electric light <b>bulb</b> or electric <b>iron)</b> which aided {{in the quality of}} the results in the tropics. In a letter to Rolfe, Powell asks: [...] "It drying was done over an Electric Light Bulb while lighted up. I {{have done a lot of}} experimenting in the drying of flowers, both with stove and sun heat, but this seems to have been the most successful. How is it for a Specimen?" [...] The pressed plant could then be affixed to a mounting sheet (11 X 17 inch paper). Label data (essential documentary information) was added. Once label data was added to the mounting sheet, it was ready for shipping. The mounting sheet (specimen) became a candidate for long-term storage in a repository (like the Harvard University Herbaria). Once accepted, the mounting sheet would then be known as a herbarium specimen. At first he sent just the preserved flowers, but soon he was asked to send preserved plants that included the roots, stems, leaves, flowers, and seeds. Powell painstakingly crafted his mounting sheets; he enhanced them with fieldnotes, illustrations, flower cutouts, and photographs. His original sheets would stand on their own as works of art; over time they have evolved into beautiful, remarkably detailed documents.|$|R
50|$|In lithic analysis, a {{subdivision}} of archaeology, a bulb of applied force (also {{known as a}} bulb of percussion or simply bulb of force) is a defining characteristic of a lithic flake. Bulb of applied force was first correctly described by Sir John Evans, the cofounder of prehistoric archeology. However, bulb of percussion was coined scientifically by W.J. Sollas. When a flake is detached from its parent core, {{a portion of the}} Hertzian cone of force caused by the detachment blow is detached with it, leaving a distinctive bulb on the flake and a corresponding flake scar on the core. In the case of a unidirectional core, the bulb of applied force is produced by an initiated crack formed at the point of contact, which begins producing the Hertzian cone. The outward pressure increases causing the crack to curve away from the core and the bulb formation. The bulb of applied force forms below the striking platform as a slight bulge. If the flake is completely crushed the bulb will not be visible. Bulbs of applied force may be distinctive, moderate, or diffuse, depending upon the force of the blow used to detach the flake, and upon the type of material used as a fabricator. The bulb of applied force can indicate the mass or density of the tool used in the application of the force. The bulb may also be an indication of the angle of the force. This information is helpful to archaeologists in understanding and recreating the process of flintknapping. Generally, the harder the material used as a fabricator, the more distinctive the bulb of applied force. Soft hammer percussion has a low diffuse bulb while hard hammer percussion usually leaves a more distinct and noticeable bulb of applied force. Pressure flake also allowed for diffuse bulbs. The bulb of percussion of a flake or blade is convex and the core has a corresponding concave bulb. The concave bulb on the core is known as the negative bulb of percussion. Bulbs of applied force are not usually present if the flake has been struck off naturally. This allows archaeologists to identify and distinguish natural breakage from human artistry. The three main <b>bulb</b> types are <b>flat</b> or nondescript, normal, and pronounced. A <b>flat</b> or nondescript <b>bulb</b> is poorly defined and does not rise up on the ventral surface. A normal bulb on the ventral side has average height and well-defined. A pronounced bulb rises up on ventral side and is very large.|$|R
