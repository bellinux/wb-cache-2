30|$|The {{efficiency}} of the simultaneous polling method in [7] depends on the interference condition among the STAs. The larger interference range allows less direct data communication to be simultaneously performed without interference. When the interference range is large enough for the data transmission of each STA {{to interfere with the}} <b>data</b> <b>receptions</b> of all other STAs in the same wireless LAN, the simultaneous direct data communication is impossible, and the {{efficiency of}} the simultaneous polling method will be {{the same as that of}} the conventional PCF protocol. Therefore, the simultaneous polling method needs to be enhanced to alleviate this problem of the lower polling efficiency with the larger interference range.|$|R

30|$|Contrary to client {{mobility}}, {{the content}} source mobility in CCN creates a complicated situation. As CCN requires content name-based routing information for content delivery, errors in routing information may cause interest packets to be misrouted. Therefore, when {{the movement of}} content sources happens, all relevant content routers should update their routing information for the successful delivery of future/ongoing content requests toward mobile content sources (MCSs). However, it takes much time to update the routing tables of all content routers. So, the interest packets may not be reached if the route to the MCS has not made changes to the new location; hence, the interest packets {{that have not yet}} been satisfied are unnecessarily sent again because content requesters do not know whether no <b>data</b> <b>receptions</b> are brought about by either a network problem like congestion/network failure or route breaks due to node movement.|$|R

40|$|Nowadays most medium access {{protocols}} {{designed for}} wireless ad hoc networks {{are based on}} collision avoidance strategies like the CSMA/CA based IEEE 802. 11 protocol. But these types of protocols are not designed for multi-hop scenarios – {{the efficiency of the}} channel utilization is too low which results in, among others, large packet delays. One popular approach to increase the channel utilization is to reserve time slots along a transmission path, thus having a scheduled access. However, a major problem is interference from nearby nodes, although these nodes are not on the same route. This might lead to destruction of ongoing <b>data</b> <b>receptions.</b> In this paper we suggest a new reservation protocol, called JamTDMA. It offers protection against this effect by advertising the reservations in a larger neighborhood. We will show that this protocol allows to improve the rate of successfully received packets while assuring an upper bound for the end-to-end delay. Categories and Subject Descriptor...|$|R
