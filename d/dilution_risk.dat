40|$|This Article proposes an “environmental {{practices}} money security interest” (EPMSI) {{that could}} be added to Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) Article 9 to facilitate transactions that enable good environmental practices. EPMSI rules would grant priority over earlier investors to financers whose extensions of credit enable debtors to invest in improving environmental impact. This work suggests {{that we should not}} rely exclusively on government subsidies such as tax credits and subsidized loans to induce investments in improved environmental impact when we could also enact commercial law devices that do so. An EPMSI would add to states’ legislative efforts to address climate change by enabling companies to issue high-priority debt to finance improvements in sustainability. Article 9 ’s blend of first-in-time priority rules and later-in-time interests that enjoy exceptions to these rules is, essentially, about benefits and drawbacks of new money. As we consider these benefits and drawbacks, two points about Article 9 become important: first, legal scholars overstate {{the extent to which the}} purchase-money rules avoid <b>dilution</b> <b>risk</b> by limiting purchase-money collateral to new goods, and, second, scholars overlook the existence of production-money interests in agricultural finance in analyses of Article 9 and interests with later-in-time priority. Ultimately, levels of commitment to mechanisms for private funding of improved environmental sustainability, and of tolerance for risk of dilution to secured creditors’ positions, are for collective determination. Through making a concrete reform proposal, this Article intends to animate, in the context of UCC Article 9, questions about environmental costs and financing of improvements in sustainability...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines three current topics {{related to}} development economics. In {{the first chapter}} I investigate spatial variation in earnings {{and the cost of}} internal migration in Thailand. The second chapter explore the unintended consequences of low accountability that accompany large technological investments in the Indian dairy sector. In the third chapter I develop a model of mutual insurance where agents can only partially observe each other's earnings. In the first chapter I estimate the perceived cost of internal migration and associated labor supply elasticity in Thailand using the revealed-preference location decisions of workers. I develop a multiperiod model of the location decision where observed earnings are an imperfect proxy for the net present value of a migration. I use global commodity prices to construct instruments that identify permanent and transitory components of local earnings. Reduced-form evidence suggests that workers are sensitive to the share of the permanent component in an earnings innovation. Given this, I estimate a structural model of migration to recover cost parameters, exploiting variation in net present value induced by the instruments. Over a range of discount rates, I estimate the average cost of migration to an individual to lie between 0. 3 and 1. 1 times annual earnings. Fixed costs of moving (which include both financial and psychic costs) account for 60 percent of this, with the remaining 40 percent varying by distance. Furthermore, variation in idiosyncratic preferences is more than double the spatial variation in earnings. Using the parameter estimates of the model, I find that migration contributes 8. 6 percentage points to local labor supply elasticity, split almost evenly between workers entering a province and fewer locals exiting. The model suggests that 20 % of long-term earnings differentials over space can be attributed to perceived moving costs. In the second chapter (co-authored with Emily Breza and Arun Chandrasekhar) I investigate the effects of technology investment in the Indian dairy sector. In India, village dairy cooperatives collect milk from rural producers and sell it in bulk to the regional market. In the last decade the Karnataka Milk Federation, the largest organizer of cooperatives in the Indian state of Karnataka, has invested heavily in bulk milk chillers (BMCs) that drastically lower the time between production and refrigeration. These chillers, by lowering the perceived risk of penalty for spoilage, both raise the potential returns to high quality milk and increase the temptation to engage in unsavory practices such as milk <b>dilution.</b> <b>Risk</b> declines both because chillers better preserve milk and because monitoring at chilling stations is more lax. Therefore the new technology both raises the returns to quality and lowers the cost of cheating. We investigate the net effects of village access to a BMC on the production process through a difference-in-difference approach using village-level data from the district of Kolar. We find that production quantity increases with access to a chiller but average production quality decreases, as does the likelihood of being punished for low quality. The results are consistent with a model in which villagers increase their use of dishonest practices such as dilution after being connected to a BMC because they face less risk of being punished. The effect size is strongest in villages that had the highest quality ex ante, suggesting an equilibrium shift brought on by the change in punishment probability. In addition, we find the strongest evidence of adulteration in villages with fewer outside agricultural options. In the third chapter I generalize a model of infinite-horizon risk sharing in which agents have private information about their stochastic income realizations. I extend the model so that agents also receive a noisy signal of each agent's earnings. Crucially, agents cannot change their action based on the signal, but contracts between the two agents may be conditioned on signal realizations. An efficient contract in this setting is one that maximizes total surplus subject to satisfying an aggregate resource constraint and ensuring that both agents truthfully reveal their private information. I first verify that an efficient contract exists and then characterize how the efficient contract incorporates information from the signal. Information increases surplus in the contracting relationship in two ways: first, it makes incentive compatibility easier to satisfy by allowing contracts to more precisely target individual types. Second, it allows contracts to better allocate resources to agents with low income by providing independent information on unobserved types. I show that under certain conditions, these two channels are mutually reinforcing and generate the unambiguous prediction that optimal contracts deliver greater payments to agents with signals associated with lower income realizations. Finally, I prove that under these conditions, as the signal gets more precise risk sharing improves monotonically and utility under an optimal contract approaches the first best. by Ashish Shenoy.

40|$|International {{audience}} Aggregation {{is thought}} to enhance an animal’s security through effective predator detection and the <b>dilution</b> of <b>risk.</b> A decline in individual vigilance as group size increases is commonly {{reported in the literature}} and called the group size effect. However, to date, most of the research has only been directed toward examining whether this effect occurs at the population level. Few studies have explored the specific contributions of predator detection and <b>risk</b> <b>dilution</b> and the basis of individual differences in the use of vigilance tactics. We tested whether male and female (non-reproductive or with young) eastern grey kangaroos (Macropus giganteus) adopted different vigilance tactics when in mixed-sex groups and varied in their reliance on predator detection and/or <b>risk</b> <b>dilution</b> as group size changed. This species exhibits pronounced sexual dimorphism with females being much smaller than males, making them differentially vulnerable toward predators. We combined field observations with vigilance models describing the effects of detection and dilution on scanning rates as group size increased. We found that females with and without juveniles relied on predator detection and <b>risk</b> <b>dilution,</b> but the latter adjusted their vigilance to the proportion of females with juveniles within their group. Two models appeared to equally support the data for males suggesting that males, similarly to females, relied on predator detection and <b>risk</b> <b>dilution</b> but may also have adjusted their vigilance according to the proportion of mothers within their group. Differential vulnerability may cause sex differences in vigilance tactic use in this species. The presence of males within a group that do not, or only partially, contribute to predator detection and are less at risk may cause additional security costs to females. Our results call for reexamination of the classical view of the safety advantages of grouping to provide a more detailed functional interpretation of gregariousness. </p...|$|R

40|$|Collective {{detection}} and predation <b>risk</b> <b>dilution</b> are two nonexclusive mechanisms that can allow {{a reduction in}} antipredator vigilance in large animal groups. The two mechanisms make remarkably similar predictions in many contexts, and disentangling their relative contribution has proven empirically difficult thus far. We examined a situation where predators {{are more likely to}} attack {{from one side of the}} group. Provided that all foragers in the group can detect the predator equally well, the collective detection hypothesis predicts that all individuals will adopt the same vigilance level if this mechanism acted alone. In terms of <b>risk</b> <b>dilution,</b> individuals that are on the riskier side of the group, namely those on the attack side, are unlikely to benefit to the same extent as other groupmates from the presence of companions, and should have a higher level of vigilance than more buffered foragers further inside the group. We show that semipalmated sandpipers on the riskier side of flocks were more vigilant and thus pecked at a lower rate than those in the centre of the flocks and those on the less risky side. The proportion of successful pecks did not vary with spatial position within the flocks, suggesting that differences in food availability did not confound the above findings. We conclude that it is unlikely that collective detection acted alone and that <b>risk</b> <b>dilution,</b> acting alone or in combination with collective detection, shaped antipredator vigilance in an avian prey under predation risk...|$|R
40|$|Behavioural ecology {{has been}} remarkably {{successful}} as a discipline, {{in part because}} much of the theory that has been developed is readily testable through manipulative experiments in the laboratory and the ®eld. Although the preferred currency for most theories is ®tness, it has usually been possible to incorporate modi®cations or simplifying assumptions that allow the use of more readily observed, surrogate measures of ®tness. Admittedly this does require some compromise, but in the grand tradition of behavioural ecology this trade-o € is easy to solve: the bene®ts outweigh the costs. Moody et al. (1996) (henceforth referred to as MHM), explored the role that <b>risk</b> <b>dilution</b> will have on the results of experiments that investigate predation risk ± foraging trade-o€s. Assuming that the probability of being killed by a predator is inversely related to the number of animals feeding at a site, they developed a model that incorporates <b>risk</b> <b>dilution</b> into ideal free distributions (IFDs) under predation risk.

40|$|The {{geological}} deep {{disposal of}} Nuclear High Level Waste (HLW) is nowadays {{considered the most}} likely option {{to solve the problem}} of nuclear waste in the long term. In most of the countries that have developed nuclear civil programs, three options are considered as potential geological formations to host a repository: Granite, clay and salt, though other alternatives are not excluded. One of the requirements to get the approval from national authorities to operate such kind of facility is the demonstration of compliance with national regulations regarding post-closure safety. Post-closure safety criteria are based on the concept of risk in many countries, and the peak of the mean dose over time is the most widely used measure of risk. Uncertainty is a pervasive factor all over this process. We have to face model uncertainty, scenario uncertainty and parameter uncertainty. Not all our models are validated under all possible physical conditions and in some cases we could be omitting some relevant phenomena. Regarding scenarios, omitting some relevant scenario could be possible and estimating scenario probabilities is not an easy task. Finally, parameter uncertainty is a main issue, mostly when the origin of uncertainty is lack of knowledge instead of intrinsic variability. A trustworthy risk assessment should rely on an accurate assessment of all kinds of uncertainties. In this paper we address the issue of <b>risk</b> <b>dilution</b> in the <b>risk</b> assessment of a HLW repository. <b>Risk</b> <b>dilution</b> consists in getting a lower estimation of risk (peak of the mean dose over time), due to either wrong assessment of input parameter uncertain, or to inadequate treatment of events that could have a high impact on the dose but whose occurrence is stochastic and has a very limited action in time and/or space.

40|$|Antipredatory {{vigilance}} usually {{decreases in}} groups. The generally accepted "collective detection" explanation implies {{that because there}} are more eyes to scan the surroundings for predators, individuals in a group can lower their personal investment in vigilance without increasing their predation risk. The role of other factors, such as numerical <b>risk</b> <b>dilution</b> caused by {{the mere presence of}} companions, has been neglected. In a model, we explore a dilution game when foragers in groups have access to protective cover. We show that foragers can take advantage of <b>risk</b> <b>dilution</b> and that this leads to changes in vigilance with group size without the need to invoke collective detection. We identify a cost to maintaining high levels of vigilance as less vigilant foragers gather food faster and so depart the group sooner (to reach cover) leaving more vulnerable stragglers behind. In groups, there is a scramble to reach safe sites that can induce a reduction in vigilance levels. Such a mechanism operates less forcefully in large groups because individuals in these groups are less vulnerable to the departure of an individual. We also demonstrate that individuals should adopt lower levels of vigilance, to reach safe sites sooner, when predator evasion is compromised or when the rate of food intake is high. The model provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying changes in vigilance with group size in animals. Copyright 2007, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R

If restocking aims at increasing harvest opportunities, increased hunting pressure is expected, which would then be supported by either wild or released individuals. On the other hand, the wild recipient population may benefit from the release of captive-bred conspecifics if this reduces hunting pressure on the former through <b>dilution</b> of <b>risk</b> or selective harvesting of captive-bred individuals. Here, we modelled a Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) population consisting of wild individuals supplemented by captive-bred conspecifics, a very common practice in Europe over the last 40 years.

40|$|Animals {{frequently}} {{raise their}} heads to check for danger. In a group, individuals generally raise their heads independently. Earlier models suggest that all group members could gain by coordinating their vigilance, i. e., each member raising its head when others are not. We re-examine these suggestions, considering groups of different sizes, in light of empirical findings that: (1) animals can sometimes detect a predator without raising their heads, and (2) when one member of a group detects a predator, the information does not always spread to {{other members of the}} group. Including these effects in models generally decreases the value of coordinated vigilance. Coordinated vigilance is highly favored only when animals have a low probability of detecting predators without lifting their heads but a high probability of being warned when another member of the group detects a predator. For other combinations, coordinated vigilance has little value and may have a negative value. Group size has contrasting effects depending on how social information is obtained. Coordination is favored in smaller groups when one or more detecting individuals provide a constant amount of information to individuals unaware of the predator. On the other hand, coordination is favored in larger groups if each detecting individual provides unaware individuals with an independent source of information (i. e., if the amount of information increases as the number of detecting individuals increases). These results depend on the balance of an escape due to social information and <b>dilution</b> of <b>risk</b> in groups with imperfect information spread.

We investigated whether there was a foraging benefit in redshanks, Tringa totanus, that show the group size decrease in individual vigilance. Intake rates did not change with group size, despite an increase in time spent foraging. Interference competition increased with group size because individuals travelled more to find prey. Redshanks used the extra time available to forage to maintain intake rates under increased competition. Although the group size effect on vigilance did not accrue direct foraging benefits, larger groups formed, conferring other antipredation benefits.

40|$|The present {{work has}} two main objectives; to {{determine}} the benefits and the mechanisms of group-living in M. disstria caterpillars. A combination of laboratory and field experiments showed that groups of M. disstria caterpillars can thermoregulate, that body temperatures achieved while basking in a group coincided with temperatures at which development rate is maximal for this species, and resulted in higher growth rates in the laboratory. Not only is collective thermoregulatory behaviour possible and advantageous in this species, it also drives much of the colony’s behaviour, in large part dictating temporal and spatial patterns of movement. The objective of the second section {{of the study was}} to determine if the gregarious habit of M. disstria caterpillars is advantageous against different invertebrate natural enemies as a function of group size and larval instar. We found that behavioural tactics in response to attacks were specifically tailored to the particular mortality agents acting on them and were more diverse and more effective for larger caterpillars. We also show that grouping benefits caterpillars through both the <b>dilution</b> of <b>risk</b> and group defences. Synchronization of activity between individuals is necessary to derive the benefits that ensue from an aggregated lifestyle. Which individuals decide which activities to perform and when to perform them is therefore a fundamental question. The results of our study indicate that unfed caterpillars initiate foraging bouts and are more likely to lead locomotion. Consistent behavioural differences between individuals, if they exist, are therefore not necessary to explain task allocation and synchronisation during foraging in this species. In conclusion, these findings suggest that group thermoregulation and protection from predation may be important selection pressures keeping larval colonies of M. disstria together. Like other groups of animals with self-organization, these caterpillars are able to make collective decisions as a result of individual behaviours in order to benefit from these advantages. ...|$|R
40|$|When an {{imminent}} attack by a predator {{on a group}} of birds is signalled to non-detectors only by the departure of the detector, non-detectors may make time-wasting false-alarm flights in response to mistaken or non-predator-driven departures. The frequency of false-alarm flights might be reduced if group members assess the reason for single departures before responding. Immediate flights should only occur after multiple simultaneous departures, because these are only likely to be generated by an attack. The response delay between the detectors' departure and the next birds that respond should then be dependent on the number of detectors. On sparrowhawk attack, response delays in redshanks decreased significantly as detector number increased, controlling for raptor conspicuousness and proximity, and flock size and spacing. If response delay is modified because of <b>risk</b> <b>dilution,</b> it should increase with flock size and, consequently, the rate of alarm flights due to mistakes should decrease. However, response delay did not increase and flight frequency due to misidentification of non-raptors or non-predator-driven departures did not decrease with flock size.

The resulting behaviour and energetic reserves of individuals, and the resulting group sizes, are shown to be affected both by the ability of the forager to detect conspecifics and areas of the environment suitable for foraging, and by the distribution of energy in the environment.

These metrics determine {{the performance of}} a disposal system (hazardous and radioactive wastes), which must be determined for a site to obtain an operating license. Monte Carlo sampling is used to investigate the impacts of uncertainty and model bias on risk predictions. The sampling accounts for uncertainty within the disposal system using both normal and lognormal distributions for the model parameters. The effects on risk predictions of modeled events with an estimated probability of occurrence and of a particular compliance period are also analyzed. Risk predictions are calculated based on a simplified model that takes into account waste container failure, the release rate from the waste, and transport of the release with retardation to a receptor. Results from the simplified model are used to evaluate the stability and accuracy of risk predictions for each metric over a range of uncertainties and biases. The peak-of-the-mean metric provides the least stable and least accurate risk predictions, whereas the cumulative release metric is the most stable and the most accurate. The peak-of-the-mean metric also exhibits <b>risk</b> <b>dilution</b> (i. e., a decrease in the predicted risk with increased uncertainty). The impact of an event on a risk prediction when the modeled time of the event is either under-estimated or over-estimated is assessed. The cumulative release is the most stable and accurate metric. The peak-of-the-mean metric is stable but under-estimates risk. ^ The mean-of-the-peaks metric provides an accurate risk prediction if the time of the event is approximately equal to the modeled event time. If the modeled event time is either under-estimated or over-estimated, this metric under-estimates risk with respect to the nominal risk. Risk predictions for each metric are stable and accurate when the compliance period is greater than the containment time for the disposal system. If the compliance period is less than the containment period, risk predictions using these metrics can be unstable and inaccurate. For events with probabilities, under-estimating or over-estimating the modeled event time can {{have a significant effect on}} the predicted risk depending on the risk metric. The cumulative release metric is the most stable and accurate risk predictor for event probabilities that are either under-estimated or over-estimated. The mean-of-the-peaks metric shows <b>risk</b> <b>dilution</b> and the peak-of-the-mean metric consistently under-estimates risk. ^ This paper presents the behavior of metrics for different uncertainties, biases, compliance periods, and events with probabilities. It also illustrates how risk predictions can be moved in a direction that may or may not be expected or intended. ...|$|R
40|$|AIMS: To {{quantify}} {{the association between}} treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and selective cyclooxygenase (COX) - 2 inhibitors and hospitalization due to congestive heart failure (CHF); {{to determine if the}} risk varies between first and subsequent episodes of CHF. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study of the relationship between recent use of NSAIDs and COX- 2 inhibitors and hospitalization with CHF. Cases (n= 530) were patients admitted to hospital with a primary diagnosis of CHF. Controls (n= 1054) were subjects without CHF who were admitted to the same hospitals as the cases. They were frequency matched to cases on the basis of age and sex. Structured interviews were used to obtain information on a number of study factors, including recent use of NSAIDs and COX- 2 inhibitors. Relative risks (RRs) were estimated from exposure odds ratios, adjusted for a range of potential confounders. RESULTS: Overall, NSAIDs and COX- 2 inhibitors had been taken by 249 (23. 6 %) controls in the week before admission to hospital. Use of any NSAID/COX- 2 inhibitor was recorded in 81 / 285 (28. 4 %) first-time cases compared with 38 / 245 (15. 5 %) in recurrent cases: difference 12. 9 % (95 % confidence interval 5. 9, 19. 8) (P= 0. 0004). The adjusted RRs for first hospital admission for CHF with different drug exposures were: NSAIDs 1. 1 (0. 67, 1. 83), rofecoxib 1. 29 (0. 78, 2. 13) and celecoxib 1. 47 (0. 85, 2. 53). CONCLUSIONS: We found weak and statistically nonsignificant associations between use of NSAIDs and COX- 2 inhibitors and hospitalization with CHF. This low RR is consistent with the results of recently published studies, but not with early studies that found an approximate doubling of risk with use of NSAIDs. The <b>dilution</b> of <b>risk</b> and the significantly lower levels of prescribing for recurrent than for first-time cases of heart failure suggest that prescribing doctors heeded messages that NSAIDs may precipitate CHF in vulnerable individuals, and that they have applied the same message to selective COX- 2 inhibitors...|$|R
40|$|Gregariousness {{in animals}} is widely {{accepted}} as a behavioral adaptation for protection from predation. However, predation risk {{and the effectiveness of}} a prey’s defense can be a function of several other factors, including predator species and prey size or age. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine if the gregarious habit of Malacosoma disstria caterpillars is advantageous against invertebrate natural enemies, and whether it is through dilution or cooperative defenses. We also examined the effects of larval growth and group size on the rate and success of attacks. Caterpillars of M. disstria responded with predator-specific behaviors, which led to increased survival. Evasive behaviors were used against stinkbugs, while thrashing by fourth instar caterpillars and holding on to the silk mat by second instar caterpillars was most efficient against spider attacks. Collective head flicking and biting by groups of both second and fourth instar caterpillars were observed when attacked by parasitoids. Increased larval size decreased the average number of attacks by spiders but increased the number of attacks by both stinkbugs and parasitoids. However, increased body size decreased the success rate of attacks by all three natural enemies and increased handling time for both predators. Larger group sizes did not influence the number of attacks from predators but increased the number of attacks and the number of successful attacks from parasitoids. In all cases, individual risk was lower in larger groups. Caterpillars showed collective defenses against parasitoids but not against the walking predators. These results show that caterpillars use different tactics against different natural enemies. Overall, these tactics are both more diverse and more effective in fourth instar than in second instar caterpillars, confirming that growth reduces predation risk. We also show that grouping benefits caterpillars through <b>dilution</b> of <b>risk,</b> and, in the case of parasitoids, through group defenses. The decreased tendency to aggregate in the last larval instar may therefore be linked to decreasing predation risk. ...|$|R
40|$|For migratory species, {{the timing}} of arrival at {{breeding}} grounds is an important determinant of fitness. Too early arrival at the breeding ground is associated with various costs, and we focus on one understudied cost: that migrants can experience {{a higher risk of}} predation if arriving earlier than the bulk of the breeding population. We show, using both a semi-analytic and simulation model, that predation can select for later arrival. This is because of safety in numbers: predation risk becomes diluted if many other individuals, either con- or heterospecific, are already residing in the area. Predation <b>risk</b> <b>dilution</b> can also select for more synchronous arrival because deviating from the current population-wide norm to earlier or later dates leads to higher predation risk or to failures in territory acquisition, respectively. The fact that selection for high arrival synchrony can in some cases be more important than selection for a specific date (early or late) within the season is an example of an ‘evolutionary priority effect’: whichever strategy – in this case a particular arrival time – becomes established in a population can remain stable over long periods of time; there are many possible equilibria (multiple stable states) which the population can remain at. Mixed arrival strategies are also possible under some circumstances...|$|R
40|$|A {{reduction}} in individual vigilance {{with an increase}} in group size {{is one of the most}} frequently reported re-lationships in animal behaviour, yet the reasons for it remain unclear. A key issue is whether the group-size effect is better explained by the detection (or ‘many eyes’) hypothesis, modelled by Pulliam’s (1973) in-fluential paper, or by <b>risk</b> <b>dilution</b> (Hamilton, 1971). This question was the focus of an earlier review (Roberts, 1996). However, in this review, Beauchamp questions whether the group-size effect is due to predation-related factors at all, and whether it might instead be a consequence of foraging-related effects, particularly scramble competition. This may be seen as echoing Elgar’s (1989) concern that factors such as foraging effects might confound any relationship between group size and vigilance. Yet there have been a number of theoretical developments concerning the inter-relationships between group size, foraging and vigilance that make an updated review timely. Beauchamp argues that predation-related factors and scramble competition represent equally viable explanations for the group-size effect. However, if a group-size effect were to be found in non-feeding ani-mals, scramble competition would not provide a viable explanation. In fact, there are a number of studies in which such an effect has been found. Roberts (1995), for example, found that preening crested terns Sterna bergii reduced their vigilance when flock siz...|$|R
40|$|Vigilance {{has been}} {{predicted}} to decrease with group size {{due to increased}} predator detection and <b>dilution</b> of predation <b>risk</b> in larger groups. Although earlier literature reviews have provided ample support for this prediction, {{an increasing number of}} studies have failed to document a decline in vigilance with group size. In addition, support for this prediction has been based thus far on the P value of the relationship between vigilance and group size rather than on a quantitative assessment of effect magnitude. Here, I use a meta-analysis of empirical relationships between vigilance and group size in birds published in the last 35 years to provide a reassessment of the group-size effect on vigilance. Nearly one-third of all published relationships between vigilance and group size were not significant (n[*]=[*] 172). Results from the meta-analysis indicate weak to moderate negative correlations between group size and time spent vigilant (n[*]=[*] 43), scan frequency (n[*]=[*] 29), or scan duration (n[*]=[*] 20). The magnitude of the relationship was stronger in studies that controlled the amount of food available to birds. A funnel plot of the relationship between correlation coefficients and sample size failed to reveal an obvious publication bias. Although the meta-analysis results generally support the prediction that vigilance should decline with group size, a large amount of variation in vigilance remains unexplained in avian studies.

40|$|International audienceI used a {{simulation}} model {{to study how}} individual responses to predation risk and vigilance strategies may lead to departure in a foraging bird flock. The model incorporates <b>risk</b> <b>dilution</b> and, to some extent, collective detection of predators. A major factor influencing birds' behaviour is individual perception of predation risk. In the model, this perception is partly based on the observation of the other birds in the flock. It increases when these birds reveal their anxiety by becoming vigilant or taking flight. In general, the model describes birds' departure as a contagious phenomenon, which quickly spreads over the whole group. However, isolated flights involving only a few individuals may also occur. The model predicts that flock size and reliance on social information will strongly affect the moment that birds decide to stop feeding and take flight, {{even in the absence}} of any predator attack. In general, birds in small flocks leave the food patch sooner, and having accumulated lower energy reserves, than birds in larger groups. When disturbed, a flock may take flight instantaneously, simply because the high level of vigilance in the group increases anxiety. As a consequence, the model predicts that high levels of disturbance may have important effects on the mean level of energy reserves in the flock.

The metabolic syndrome and cancer project (Me-Can) includes cohorts from Norway, Austria, and Sweden; the current study included data on 257, 585 men and 256, 512 women. The mean age at study entry was 43. 8 years for men and 44. 2 years for women. The mean follow-up time was 13. 4 years (SD = 8. 5) for men and 11. 9 years (SD = 7. 2) for women. Excluding {{the first year of}} follow-up, 23, 060 men and 15, 686 women were diagnosed with cancer. Cox regression models were used to calculate relative risk (RR) of cancer for triglyceride levels in quintiles and as a continuous variable. RRs were corrected for random error by use of regression <b>dilution</b> ratio. Relative <b>risk</b> for top quintile versus bottom quintile of triglycerides of overall cancer was 1. 16 (95 % confidence interval 1. 06 - 1. 26) in men and 1. 15 (1. 05 - 1. 27) in women. For specific cancers, significant increases for top quintile versus bottom quintile of triglycerides among men were found for cancers of the colon, respiratory tract, the kidney, melanoma and thyroid and among women, for respiratory, cervical, and non-melanoma skin cancers.

40|$|The cestode Schistocephalus solidus uses copepods {{as first}} and {{sticklebacks}} as second intermediate hosts. For transmission, an infected copepod {{has to be}} preyed upon by a stickleback. We used copepods of the species Macrocy albidus to test whether infected and uninfected copepods differ in their reaction to two kind of simultaneously presented odors: odors of sticklebacks and odors of sticklebacks and conspecificz. By giving this choice, we attempted to force the copepods to make a trade-off between the benefit of <b>risk</b> <b>dilution</b> and possible predator confusion {{and the costs of}} food competition and other disadvantages induced by conspecifics. Within 1 - 8 h after last feeding, uninfected copepods clearly preferred the odors of conspeciflcs under the chemically simulated threat of predation. This was in contrast to the infected copepods, who tended to avoid the odor of conspecifics. When the time between experiment and last feeding varied, infected copepods showed an increas preference for fish water only (or avoided conspecthcs) with increasing hunger level This suggests that S. solidus benefits from hunger-induced behavioral changes of its copepod host by influencing its microhabitat selection. The same effect could be found in both sexes; however, it was significantly more pronounced in male than in female copepods. We propose several hypotheses that could explain the difference between the sexes in their infection-dependent microhabitat selectio...|$|R
5000|$|Gregarious {{behavior}} {{occurs in}} a wide variety of taxa and thus, has likely evolved independently on several occasions. [...] <b>Dilution</b> of predation <b>risk</b> is one of many proposed benefits that have facilitated the selection of such behavior. Much research has been devoted to understanding the possible evolution of the selfish herd and thus, the plausibility of the theory. In order for the selfish herd to have evolved, movement rules that decreased domains of danger within a population must have been selected. Because such rules are often complex, it is unlikely that they would have evolved in a single step. Rather, simple rules that considered solely the nearest neighbor in guiding movement may have given rise to the evolution of more complicated rules. This proposed succession would only occur if individuals who moved toward their nearest neighbor in the face of predation showed a higher survival than those who did not. Furthermore, individuals must have benefited from such movements more often than they were harmed (i.e. forced onto the periphery and attacked). This idea has, in fact, gained support. A study conducted by Reluga and Viscido found that natural selection of localized movement rules of members within a population could, in fact, promote the evolution of the selfish herd. Further, it has been shown that how the predator attacks plays a crucial role in whether or not selfish herd behavior can evolve.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of an {{experiment}} investigating how directors’ identification and evaluation of diagnostic and non-diagnostic information in a financial statement fraud risk assessment setting affects <b>dilution</b> in their <b>risk</b> assessments. My results show that more (less) diluted risk assessments are made when more (fewer) nondiagnostic factors are identified and where less (more) weight is placed on non-diagnostic factors identified as relevant to the judgment decision. Directors with higher levels of technical knowledge are found to identify more diagnostic factors and place greater weight on these factors than directors with lower levels of technical knowledge. Higher levels of technical knowledge are also associated with marginally lower weights placed on nondiagnostic factors and a resultant lower susceptibility to dilution in judgment decisions. Audit committee members with higher levels of technical knowledge are also found to make less diluted risk assessments. Directors who possess lower levels of technical knowledge are found to be unable to bridge the ‘gap’ in their performance compared to directors with higher technical knowledge even with the assistance of a decision aid. Collectively, these findings indicate that technical knowledge is a key driver in the ability of directors to identify and evaluate risk factors, and that any lack of technical knowledge may not easily be supplemented with decision aids. The findings also suggest that some commonly-used measures of director task expertise and competence may be inappropriate proxies for their risk assessment capabilities...|$|R

CPO experiments were carried out in a lab scale auto-thermal reformer with honeycomb monolith catalysts (2 % Rh/Î±-Al 2 O 3), equipped with probes for spatially resolved measurements of temperature and concentration. Tests were performed with about 50 % N 2 <b>dilution</b> to prevent <b>risks</b> of deactivation due to catalyst over temperature. The CPO of the two isomers follows similar reaction pathways, which mainly consist of the exothermic combustion reaction and the endothermic steam reforming. This results in a close similarity of the concentration profiles of the main species and of the temperature profiles obtained with the two isomers. On the other hand, gas phase reactions proceed to a different extent and bring about a different distribution of thermal cracking products, iso-octane being more reactive and selective to iso-butylene and propene, while n-octane being selective to ethylene. Coke formation was observed upon adiabatic tests which was responsible for partial deactivation of the reforming zone of the catalyst. Post mortem TPO tests show that n-octane exhibits a higher tendency to coke deposition than iso-octane in the adopted CPO conditions. Thermodynamic and modeling calculations show {{that the risk of}} coking can be reduced by using exhaust gas recycling instead of N 2 to dilute the reactants...|$|R
