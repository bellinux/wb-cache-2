Johan Wippsson from Melodic praised Don Gilmore's production and described the albums as [...] "destructive and angry but always with a well controlled melodic feeling all over." [...] NMEs Noel Gardner commented that [...] "otherwise damn fine soaring emo-crunchers like 'With You' and 'A Place for My Head' are pointlessly jazzed up with tokenistic scratching," [...] giving the album a score of six out of ten. Tyler Fisher at Sputnikmusic gave the album a 3.0/5, saying [...] "Hybrid Theory stands as a defining mainstream album {{at the turn of}} the century, and for good reason.", but calling the guitar riffs [...] "often bland and unoriginal". Mike Ross of Jam! declares the albums as a combination of the best of hip hop and heavy metal. He goes on to state [...] "...they can actually rap. They can actually crank out a ferocious, head-banging groove. They can write introspective lyrics with intelligence. <b>It</b> <b>adds</b> <b>up</b> to one of the finest new rap metal bands I've ever heard." ...|$|E

2500|$|All for You {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 73. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic favored All for You over her last studio album, The Velvet Rope, calling it [...] "alluring, easily enveloping the listener." [...] Erlewine added, [...] "This is her sexiest-sounding record, thanks to Jam and Lewis' silky groove and her breathy delivery, {{two things that}} make the record palatable." [...] Tom Sinclair of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a 'B' rating, saying, [...] "Despite a few missteps, All for You is {{about as good as}} modern diva-pop gets, with a higher ratio of worthy-to-mediocre songs than might be expected... <b>it</b> <b>adds</b> <b>up</b> to a lot more than most female singers have done for us lately." ...|$|E

The Laplaces, whose only daughter Sophie had died in childbirth in September 1813, were in fear {{for the safety of}} their son Émile, who was on the eastern front with the emperor. Napoleon had originally come to power promising stability, but {{it was clear that he}} had overextended himself, putting the nation at peril. It was at this point that Laplace's loyalty began to weaken. Although he still had easy access to Napoleon, his personal relations with the emperor cooled considerably. As a grieving father, he was particularly cut to the quick by Napoleon's insensitivity in an exchange related by Jean-Antoine Chaptal: [...] "On his return from the rout in Leipzig, he [...] accosted Mr Laplace: 'Oh! I see that you have grown thin—Sire, I have lost my daughter—Oh! that's not a reason for losing weight. You are a mathematician; put this event in an equation, and you will find that <b>it</b> <b>adds</b> <b>up</b> to zero.'" ...|$|E

40|$|This {{essay is}} an attempt to throw light on German fascism from a new perspective, namely by examinating its {{vocabulary}} of cultural criticism. I focus on the language of Martin Heidegger and Ernst Jünger to suggest that it represents a critique of philosophical and religious transcendence. Being neither logical nor primarily communicative, it was arbitrary and elaborately coded, and while thus evading party political identification and orthodoxy, <b>it</b> <b>added</b> <b>up</b> to an expression of what has been called, in reference to Heidegger, a 'Privat-Nationalsozialismus'.
