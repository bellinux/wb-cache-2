5|$|A simple case {{of dynamic}} {{equilibrium}} occurs in constant velocity motion across a surface with kinetic friction. In such a situation, a {{force is applied}} in the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>motion</b> while the kinetic friction force exactly opposes the applied force. This results in zero net force, but since the object started with a non-zero velocity, it continues to move with a non-zero velocity. Aristotle misinterpreted this motion as being caused by the applied force. However, when kinetic friction is taken into consideration {{it is clear that}} there is no net force causing constant velocity motion.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe motion {{after-effect}} (MAE) can be elicited by adapting {{observers to}} global <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> randomly distributed dots before they view a display containing dots moving in random directions, but no global motion. Experiments by others {{have shown that}} if the adaptation stimulus contains two <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> <b>motion,</b> the MAE points opposite to the vector sum <b>of</b> the adapting <b>directions.</b> The present study investigated whether such vector addition in the MAE could also occur if the two <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> <b>motion</b> were presented to separate eyes. Observers were adapted to different, but not opposite, <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> <b>motion</b> in the two eyes. Either the left eye, the right eye, or both eyes were tested. Observers reported the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> perceived <b>motion</b> during the test. When they saw the test stimulus with both eyes, observers reported seeing motion in the <b>direction</b> opposite that <b>of</b> the vector sum <b>of</b> the adaptation <b>directions.</b> In the monocular test conditions observers reported MAE directions opposite to the corresponding monocular adaptation directions. In a second experiment we verified that subjects had interocular transfer of the MAE. Together these {{results are consistent with}} a model in which (1) addition <b>of</b> adaptation <b>directions</b> occurs at a binocular site; (2) directional adaptation occurs at a monocular site; and (3) monocular adaptation is able to change the threshold for obtaining an MAE at the binocular site, thus acting like binocular adaptation in interocular transfer of the MAE...|$|R

Rather than being covered in low-relief ridges, this region is covered in numerous criss-crossing sets of troughs and ridges, similar to the deformation seen in the south polar region. This area is {{on the opposite side}} of Enceladus from Sarandib and Diyar Planitiae, suggesting that the placement of these regions is influenced by Saturn's tides on Enceladus.|$|E
5|$|Because of this {{experiment}} Hendrik Lorentz {{proposed that the}} motion of the apparatus through the aether may cause the apparatus to contract along its length in the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>motion,</b> and he further assumed, that the time variable for moving systems must also be changed accordingly ("local time"), which led to the formulation of the Lorentz transformation. Based on Lorentz's aether theory, Henri Poincaré (1900) showed that this local time (to first order in v/c) is indicated by clocks moving in the aether, which are synchronized under the assumption of constant light speed. In 1904, he speculated that the speed of light could be a limiting velocity in dynamics, provided that the assumptions of Lorentz's theory are all confirmed. In 1905, Poincaré brought Lorentz's aether theory into full observational agreement with the principle of relativity.|$|E
5|$|In 1895, Lorentz more {{generally}} explained Fresnel's coefficient {{based on the}} concept of local time. However, Lorentz's theory had the same fundamental problem as Fresnel's: a stationary aether contradicted the Michelson–Morley experiment. So in 1892 Lorentz proposed that moving bodies contract in the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>motion</b> (FitzGerald-Lorentz contraction hypothesis, since George FitzGerald had already arrived in 1889 at this conclusion). The equations that he used to describe these effects were further developed by him until 1904. These are now called the Lorentz transformations in his honor, and are identical in form to the equations that Einstein was later to derive from first principles. Unlike Einstein's equations, however, Lorentz's transformations were strictly ad hoc, their only justification being that they seemed to work.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} that much <b>of</b> the visual <b>motion</b> coding {{in the primary}} visual cortex can be understood from a theory <b>of</b> efficient <b>motion</b> coding in the multiscale representation. The theory predicts that cortical cells can have a spectrum of directional indices, are tuned to different <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> <b>motion,</b> and their receptive fields (RF) can be spatio-temporally separable or inseparable. The predictions also include the following correlations between the motion coding and spatial, chromatic, and stereo codings: the preferred speed is larger when the cell receptive field sizes are larger: the color channel prefers smaller speed than the luminance channel, both the optimal speeds and the preferred <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> <b>motion</b> can be different for the two eyes in the same neuron. These predictions agree with experimental observations. In addition, this theory makes predictions {{that have not been}} experimentally investigated systematically and provides testing ground for the efficient multiscale coding framework. These predictions are: (1) nearby cortical cells of a given preferred orientation and scale are to prefer opposite <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> <b>motion,</b> have the same directional index, and are of quadrature spatio-temporal phase relationships with each other; (2) a single neuron can have different optimal motion speeds for opposite <b>motion</b> <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> monocular stimuli to a given eye, and (3) a neuron's ocular dominance may change with motion direction if the two eyes prefer opposite motion directions...|$|R

5|$|In {{order to}} {{initiate}} a turn and the necessary lean {{in the direction of}} that turn, a bike must momentarily steer in the opposite direction. This {{is often referred to as}} countersteering. With the front wheel now at a finite angle to the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>motion,</b> a lateral force is developed at the contact patch of the tire. This force creates a torque around the longitudinal (roll) axis of the bike, and this torque causes the bike to lean away from the initially steered direction and toward the direction of the desired turn. Where there is no external influence, such as an opportune side wind to create the force necessary to lean the bike, countersteering is necessary {{to initiate a}} rapid turn.|$|E
5|$|Mariners {{have a way}} {{to safely}} {{navigate}} around tropical cyclones. They split tropical cyclones in two, based on their <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>motion,</b> and maneuver to avoid the right segment of the cyclone in the Northern Hemisphere (the left in the Southern Hemisphere). Sailors term the right side the dangerous semicircle since the heaviest rain and strongest winds and seas were located in this half of the storm, as the cyclone's translation speed and its rotational wind are additive. The other half of the tropical cyclone is called the navigable semicircle since weather conditions are lessened (subtractive) in this portion of the storm (but are still potentially quite hazardous). The rules of thumb for ship travel when a tropical cyclone is in their vicinity are to avoid them if at all possible and do not cross their forecast path (crossing the T). Those traveling through the dangerous semicircle are advised to keep to the true wind on the starboard bow and make as much headway as possible. Ships moving through the navigable semicircle are advised to keep the true wind on the starboard quarter while making as much headway as possible.|$|E

40|$|It is {{generally}} believed that percept alternations in binocular rivalry {{result from the}} interplay between mutual inhibition and slow adaptation of the competing percepts. This view is supported by growing evidence that dynamic changes in adaptation indeed support percept alternations in binocular rivalry. Empirical evidence for the involvement of mutual inhibition, however, is still scarce. To fill this gap, we presented human subjects with dichoptic random-dot motion stimuli and manipulated the angle between the monocular <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> <b>motion</b> from pure opponent horizontal motion to pure vertical motion in the same direction. We hypothesized that this decrease in motion-direction disparity increases the cross-inhibition gain due to lateral inhibition between neurons in the brain that are coarsely tuned to adjacent <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> visual <b>motion,</b> which predicts the largest changes in dominance at the smallest instead of the largest motion-direction disparities. We found that decreasing the angle between the two monocular <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> <b>motion</b> indeed systematically increased the predominance and mean dominance durations <b>of</b> the <b>motion</b> pattern presented to the ocular dominant eye (as identified by the hole-in-card test). Moreover, this effect was stronger if the contrast of the stimuli was lowered. Simulations showed that these features are indeed hallmark of weighted lateral inhibition between populations of directionally tuned motion-sensitive neurons. Our findings thus suggest dominance and suppression in binocular rivalry arises naturally from this fundamental principle in sensory processing. Interestingly, if the two monocular <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> <b>motion</b> differed < 60 degrees, the percept alternations also included transitions to in-between (vertical) motion percepts. We speculate that this behavior might result from positive feedback arising from adapting disinhibitory circuits in the network...|$|R
