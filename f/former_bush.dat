25|$|John Yoo, a <b>former</b> <b>Bush</b> Administration Justice Department {{official}} and current {{professor of law}} at the University of California, Berkeley, called the Act a “stinging rebuke” of the Supreme Court's Hamdan v.

25|$|However, due to {{his poor}} {{performance}} in economy and diplomacy, Roh was not a popular president, having the worst approval rating on average ever recorded in South Korean political history. His economic policy was often criticized for persisting with certain obsolete economic views and failing certain livelihood issues. There had been a considerable diplomatic dissonance between South Korea and its traditional allies during Roh's presidency as well. <b>Former</b> <b>Bush</b> administration officials such as Condoleezza Rice and Robert Gates, in their memoirs published, claimed that Roh was anti-American and disclosed {{that there had been}} numerous conflicts between the U.S. and South Korea because of Roh's unpredictability. There has been criticism that Roh's anti-Americanism, nationalism, and pro-North Korean views contributed to a contradiction in diplomacy and impaired credibility in the international community. It also led to a decline in some of his popular support, especially among the older generation.|$|E

500|$|Mayo and Minnesota, {{supported}} by amicus briefs {{from a number}} of residency programs and medical organizations, argued that a residency is primarily educational in nature. They asserted that a residency is generally chosen based on academic criteria and that a residency must be completed in order for a physician to be licensed to practice medicine. They also argued that residency training involves not only supervised work, but also an educational curriculum, conferences, and lectures, much like clinical years of medical school. Mayo's attorney, <b>former</b> <b>Bush</b> Administration Solicitor General Theodore Olson, also argued that the rule was [...] "arbitrary", as the tax would apply to a resident working 40 hours per week but not to a resident working only 39 hours per week. The medical schools proposed that the IRS should base their determination on the primary purpose of a program—providing an education versus providing a livelihood.|$|E
