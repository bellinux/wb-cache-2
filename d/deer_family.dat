5|$|Members of {{the genus}} Cervus (and hence early {{relatives}} or possible ancestors of the elk) first appear in the fossil record 25 million years ago, during the Oligocene in Eurasia, but do {{not appear in the}} North American fossil record until the early Miocene. The extinct Irish elk (Megaloceros) was not a member {{of the genus}} Cervus, but rather the largest member of the wider <b>deer</b> <b>family</b> (Cervidae) known from the fossil record.|$|E
5|$|Until recently, {{red deer}} and elk were {{considered}} to be one species, Cervus elaphus. However, mitochondrial DNA studies, conducted on hundreds of samples in 2004 from red deer and elk subspecies as well as other species of the Cervus <b>deer</b> <b>family,</b> strongly indicate that elk, or wapiti, should be a distinct species, namely Cervus canadensis. The previous classification had over a dozen subspecies under the C. elaphus species designation; DNA evidence concludes that elk are more closely related to Thorold's deer and even sika deer than they are to the red deer. Though elk and red deer can produce fertile offspring in captivity, geographic isolation between the species in the wild and differences in mating behaviors indicate that reproduction between them outside a controlled environment would be unlikely. However, the two species have freely inter-bred in New Zealand's Fiordland National Park, where the cross-bred animals have all but removed the pure elk blood from the area.|$|E
25|$|Bull moose have antlers {{like other}} members of the <b>deer</b> <b>family.</b> Cows select mates based on antler size. Bull moose use {{dominant}} displays of antlers to discourage competition and will spar or fight rivals. The size and growth rate of antlers is determined by diet and age; symmetry reflects health.|$|E
50|$|BGSU Firelands is {{also the}} site of the McBride Arboretum (named in honor of Dr. James McBride, the college's first Dean), a natural spot that was {{carefully}} thought out, designed and implemented to showcase the plants, trees and grasses that {{are a part of the}} natural setting of the Firelands Region. The latest addition to the Arboretum was donated by <b>Deering</b> <b>family</b> of Erie County and is an all-weather deck built along one of the many small bodies of water in the Arboretum, which is 60 ft long, on which students and the public can enjoy nature. The Arboretum is managed for BGSU Firelands by Erie MetroParks.|$|R
50|$|The {{city had}} {{for some time}} been {{interested}} the Deering Oaks property, {{part of a larger}} estate owned by the <b>Deering</b> <b>family</b> since the early 19th century. In 1875, the Deerings offered the city 50 acre of land in exchange for a tax abatement, and the city agreed to the deal in 1879. The park was developed by William Goodwin, the city's civil engineer, as part of an overall master plan for city parks developed by Frederick Law Olmsted. Goodwin's vision largely survives today, except only for the loss of {{a small portion of the}} park's north side, for the construction of Interstate 295.|$|R
50|$|In 1961, the Olivers {{sold the}} {{business}} to Carroll Wales (1917-2007) and Constantine Tsaousis (1924-1987), both of whom had restored religious art in churches in the eastern Mediterranean. Notable domestic restorations of Wales and Tsaousis included Arshile Gorky's murals in Newark Airport in 1977 and the Spanish medieval art collection of the <b>Deering</b> <b>family</b> from 1971 through 1982. Over the years Mr. Wales and Mr. Tsaousis restored and conserved numerous artworks by renowned artists, including Annibale Caracci, John Singleton Copley, Francisco Goya, Giovanni Paolo Panini, Gilbert Stuart and Rembrandt Van Rain, to name a few. In 1986, Peter Tysver, an Oliver Brothers apprentice since 1968, bought the business, and in 2004, Gregory Bishop, who had been training at Oliver Brothers since 1990, became a partner. Tysver and Bishop are the two principals of today’s Oliver Brothers Art Restoration and Conservation, which remains in Boston and Beverly, Massachusetts.|$|R
25|$|Moose (Alces alces shirasi Nelson), {{the largest}} {{member of the}} <b>deer</b> <b>family,</b> were {{reportedly}} very rare in northwest Wyoming when Yellowstone National Park was established in 1872.

25|$|The European {{red deer}} {{is found in}} southwestern Asia (Asia Minor and Caucasus regions), North Africa and Europe. The red deer is the largest non-domesticated land mammal still {{existing}} in Ireland. The Barbary stag (which resembles the western European red deer) is {{the only member of}} the <b>deer</b> <b>family</b> represented in Africa, with the population centred in the northwestern region of the continent in the Atlas Mountains. As of the mid-1990s, Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria were the only African countries known to have red deer.|$|E
25|$|More than 30,000 elk from 7-8 {{different}} herds {{summer in}} Yellowstone and approximately 15,000 to 22,000 {{winter in the}} park. The subspecies of elk that lives here are found from Arizona to northern Canada along the Rocky Mountain chain; other species of elk were historically distributed from coast to coast, but disappeared from the eastern United States in the early 19th century. Some other subspecies of elk still occupy coastal regions of California, Washington, and Oregon. Elk are the second largest member of the <b>deer</b> <b>family</b> (moose are the largest). Adult males, or bulls, range upwards of 700 pounds (~320kg) while females, or cows, average 500-525 pounds (~225–240kg). Their coats are reddish brown with heavy, darker-colored manes and a distinct yellowish rump patch. Elk usually live about 15 years in the wild.|$|E

25|$|The {{red blood}} cells of mammals are {{typically}} shaped as biconcave disks: flattened and depressed in the center, with a dumbbell-shaped cross section, and a torus-shaped rim {{on the edge of}} the disk. This distinctive biconcave shape optimises the flow properties of blood in the large vessels, such as maximization of laminar flow and minimization of platelet scatter, which suppresses their atherogenic activity in those large vessels. However, there are some exceptions concerning shape in the artiodactyl order (even-toed ungulates including cattle, deer, and their relatives), which displays a wide variety of bizarre red blood cell morphologies: small and highly ovaloid cells in llamas and camels (family Camelidae), tiny spherical cells in mouse <b>deer</b> (<b>family</b> Tragulidae), and cells which assume fusiform, lanceolate, crescentic, and irregularly polygonal and other angular forms in red deer and wapiti (family Cervidae). Members of this order have clearly evolved a mode of red blood cell development substantially different from the mammalian norm. Overall, mammalian {{red blood cells}} are remarkably flexible and deformable so as to squeeze through tiny capillaries, as well as to maximize their apposing surface by assuming a cigar shape, where they efficiently release their oxygen load.|$|E
500|$|The elk, or wapiti (Cervus canadensis), {{is one of}} {{the largest}} species within the <b>deer</b> <b>family,</b> Cervidae, in the world, and one of the largest land mammals in North America and Eastern Asia. This animal should not be {{confused}} with the still larger moose (Alces alces) to which the name [...] "elk" [...] applies in British English and in reference to populations in Eurasia. Apart from the moose, the only other member of the <b>deer</b> <b>family</b> to rival the elk in size is the south Asian sambar (Rusa unicolor).|$|E

50|$|By 1682, when William Penn {{arrived to}} his American commonwealth, the Lenape {{had been so}} reduced by disease, famine, and war that the sub-clan mothers had reluctantly {{resolved}} to consolidate their families into the main clan family. This is why William Penn and all those after him believed that the Lenape clans had always only had three divisions (Turtle, Turkey, and Wolf) when, in fact, they had over thirty {{on the eve of}} European contact. For example, some time between 1650 and 1680, the Bear, <b>Deer,</b> etc. <b>families,</b> with few members left, absorbed into the leading Wolf Family.|$|R
2500|$|Cervus genus {{ancestors}} of red deer first appear in fossil records 12 {{million years ago}} during the Miocene in Eurasia. An extinct genus known as the Irish elk (Megaloceros), related to the red deer, was the largest member of the <b>deer</b> <b>family</b> known from the fossil record. Early phylogenetic analyses supported {{the idea of a}} sister-group relationship between fallow deer (Dama dama) and the Irish Elk. However, newer morphological studies prove that the Irish elk is more closely related to its modern regional counterparts of the Red Deer (Cervus elaphus). For this reason, the name [...] "Giant Deer" [...] is used in some publications.|$|E
2500|$|Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a {{transmissible}} {{spongiform encephalopathy}} (TSE) of mule deer, white-tailed deer, elk (or [...] "wapiti"), moose, and reindeer.

500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from September 17, 1910. It states: [...] "John Deering is a poor inventor living modestly {{with his wife and}} only daughter. He has approached Mr. Cobleigh, a capitalist, with a proposition to share the profits of a new invention with him, providing that he (Cobleigh) furnish the capital to swing it. Cobleigh comes to see the model of Deering's invention and is greatly impressed with it. Cobleigh offers Deering a small amount of money for the invention, but Deering refuses to accept it. Then Cobleigh, having failed to get his invention by fair means, determines to secure it by foul. He drugs Deering, and the result of the poison is to make the inventor temporarily insane. While in this condition, Cobleigh has Deering transferred to an insane asylum. Then he forges the inventor's name to the bill of sale and thinks that his crime will never be discovered. Deering's daughter, Grace, failing to induce her sweetheart, Tom Reynolds, to aid in rescuing Deering, breaks into the asylum and takes her father out singlehandedly. She conveys him to a camp in the woods where her tender care restores him to health. Then she takes him home again and he demands his rights from Cobleigh. The latter denies that he owes Deering a cent, and the inventor goes to law. Tom, who acts as his counsel, shows by enlarged stereopticon views of the two signatures that Cobleigh had traced the one from the other. Cobleigh, overcome by the revelation of his crime, is arrested, and the <b>Deering</b> <b>family</b> and the faithful Tom are happy." ...|$|R

Green and Kattel (1997) report that Moschus comprise a separate family, somewhere between the Mouse Deer (Tragulidae) and the Cervoids (goat-antelopes and true deer). This is due to having both “primitive” ruminant characteristics such as tusks and an absence of antlers, and more advanced features such as a four-chambered stomach.
