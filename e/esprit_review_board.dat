5000|$|Once {{a person}} is found not criminally {{responsible}} ("NCR"), {{he or she will}} have a hearing by a <b>Review</b> <b>Board</b> within 45 days (90 days if the court extends the delay). A <b>Review</b> <b>Board</b> is established under Part XX.1 of the Criminal Code and is composed of at least three members, a person who is a judge or eligible to be a judge, a psychiatrist and another expert in a relevant field, such as social work, criminology or psychology. Parties at a <b>Review</b> <b>Board</b> hearing are usually the accused, the Crown and the hospital responsible for the supervision or assessment of the accused. A <b>Review</b> <b>Board</b> is responsible for both accused persons found NCR or accused persons found unfit to stand trial on account of mental disorder. A <b>Review</b> <b>Board</b> dealing with an NCR offender must consider two questions: whether the accused is a [...] "significant threat to the safety of the public" [...] and, if so, what the [...] "least onerous and least restrictive" [...] restrictions on the liberty of the accused should be in order to mitigate such a threat. Proceedings before a <b>Review</b> <b>Board</b> are inquisitorial rather than adversarial. Often the <b>Review</b> <b>Board</b> will be active in conducting an inquiry. Where the <b>Review</b> <b>Board</b> is unable to conclude that the accused is a significant threat to the safety of the public, the <b>review</b> <b>board</b> must grant the accused an absolute discharge, an order essentially terminating the jurisdiction of the criminal law over the accused. Otherwise the <b>Review</b> <b>Board</b> must order that the accused be either discharged subject to conditions or detained in a hospital, both subject to conditions. The conditions imposed must be the least onerous and least restrictive necessary to mitigate any danger the accused may pose to others.|$|R

50|$|A dispute <b>board</b> or dispute <b>review</b> <b>board</b> (DRB) or dispute {{adjudication}} board (DAB) is a 'job-site' dispute adjudication process, typically comprising three {{independent and}} impartial persons {{selected by the}} contracting parties. The significant difference between Dispute <b>Review</b> <b>Boards</b> and most other Alternate Dispute Review techniques (and possibly the reason why or Dispute <b>Review</b> <b>Boards</b> have had such success in recent years) is that the Dispute <b>Review</b> <b>Board</b> is appointed at the commencement of a project before any disputes arise and, by undertaking regular visits to the site, is actively involved throughout the project (and possibly any agreed period thereafter).|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} the outcomes for patients following applications to regional <b>review</b> <b>boards</b> at an Ontario provincial psychiatric hospital for 1992 through 1994. Method: A retrospective casenote study examined frequency of readmission, time to next admission, status upon readmission, and episodes of dangerous behaviour perpetrated {{in the community}} for patients applying to <b>review</b> <b>boards.</b> Results: Over 3 years, 116 hearings took place to review various certificates. Only 57 % of applications reached a hearing. Of those, 69 % were confirmed and 31 % rescinded. A small group of patients made multiple applications to the <b>review</b> <b>board.</b> Median time to next admission for patients who had certificates of involuntary admission rescinded by the <b>review</b> <b>board</b> was 14 days, compared with 53 days for those who remained in hospital until the time of planned discharge. Conclusion: <b>Review</b> <b>boards</b> consume considerable resources, serve only {{a small proportion of}} patients, and contribute to the “revolving door ” phenomenon.

40|$|In the U. S., all {{research}} must {{be approved}} by an Institutional <b>Review</b> <b>Board</b> (IRB) that evaluates research protocols for the purpose of protecting human subjects. This paper includes a brief history of the development of public policy that guides institutional <b>review</b> <b>boards</b> in the U. S. and commentary on the responsibilities of a grounded theory researcher interested in applying for approval for a research study. An institutional <b>review</b> <b>board</b> (IRB) is a formally constituted committee that approves and monitors biomedical and behavioural research with the purpose of protecting the rights and welfare of research participants. An IRB performs scientific, ethical, and regulatory oversight functions. In the U. S., it is common for grounded theorists to experience frustration with the IRB protocol submission process. Facets of the application process may seem rigid, redundant, and non-applicable. <b>Review</b> <b>board</b> members may not seem to understand or appreciate qualitative methods and delays are common. In addition, a conglomeration of disparate policies and procedures coupled with a variety of types of <b>review</b> <b>boards</b> creates a system that defies description. Nevertheless, a researcher who understands public policy and the responsibilities of institutional <b>review</b> <b>boards</b> can learn to develop research applications that are quickly approved...|$|R
