2500|$|Another {{approach}} to controlling the drug {{on the state}} level which has been mandated by some state governments to control the purchases of their citizens is the use of <b>electronic</b> <b>tracking</b> systems, which require the electronic submission of specified purchaser information by all retailers who sell pseudoephedrine. 32 states now require the National Precursor Log Exchange (NPLEx) to be used for every pseudoephedrine and ephedrine OTC purchase, and ten of the eleven largest pharmacy chains in the US voluntarily contribute all of their similar transactions to NPLEx. These states have seen dramatic results in reducing the number of methamphetamine laboratory seizures. Prior to implementation of the system in Tennessee in 2005, methamphetamine laboratory seizures totaled 1,497 in 2004, but were reduced to 955 in 2005, and 589 in 2009. Kentucky's program was implemented statewide in 2008, and since statewide implementation, the number of laboratory seizures has significantly decreased. Oklahoma initially experienced success with their tracking system after implementation in 2006, as the number of seizures dropped in that year and again in 2007. However, in 2008, seizures began rising again, and have continued to rise in 2009. [...] However, when Oklahoma adopted NPLEx, their lab seizures also dropped significantly.|$|E

This paper introduces a paradigm for <b>electronic</b> <b>track</b> map design and generation. According to the satellite-base train positioning scheme, the architecture of the <b>electronic</b> <b>track</b> map and its coupling in the train-borne systems is investigated.
