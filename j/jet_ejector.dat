The high-efficiency <b>jet</b> <b>ejector</b> was simulated by Fluent Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software. A conventional finite-volume scheme was utilized to solve two-dimensional transport equations with the standard k-?? turbulence model (Kim et. al., 1999). In this study of a constant-area <b>jet</b> <b>ejector,</b> all parameters were expressed in dimensionless terms. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the optimum length, throat diameter, nozzle position, and inlet curvature of the convergence section. Also, the optimum compression ratio and efficiency were determined. By comparing simulation results to an experiment, CFD modeling has shown high-quality results.

40|$|The rising {{standard}} of living and the changing situation in the energy sector {{have led to the}} development of solar cooling systems in the last years. Previously only "sorptive" cooling systems, which means absorption chillers, adsorption chillers and Desiccative Evaporative Cooling, have been used for solar cooling. These cooling systems are very complicated and there is still a high demand for research and development. Another interesting alternative to the only "sorptive" cooling systems used is a solar driven steam <b>jet</b> <b>ejector,</b> which has a simple construction design and a high coefficient of performance in part load. However, the concept of a solar driven steam <b>jet</b> <b>ejector</b> chiller has only been investigated theoretically or by small test rigs. Up to now there are no demonstration or pilot plants, so that no operational experiences are available. The few existing models for calculation are used to identify parameters for the nominal load and do not describe the operational behaviour. Because of the lack of systems realised and the respective calculation models, the operational behaviour of solar driven steam <b>jet</b> <b>ejector</b> chillers has not been investigated under changing operational conditions yet. This publication first of all gives an overview of the possibilities of solar cooling systems and describes briefly the different techniques. Furthermore, theoretical and practical works concerning solar collectors and steam jet ejectors are presented. Subsequently, a dynamic model of a solar driven steam <b>jet</b> <b>ejector</b> chiller is presented and described. The model is structured into model components, which correspond to the device components. These model components can be combined in different ways to one cooling plant. Consequently, different plant concepts can be modelled and investigated. The validation of the model is done by values taken from literature and measurement data of a small test rig. The validation proves that the model presented simulates the dynamic operational behaviour of a solar driven steam <b>jet</b> <b>ejector</b> chiller. At the end of the work, a concept of a solar driven steam <b>jet</b> <b>ejector</b> chiller for air conditioning is investigated for the location of St. Katrine in Egypt.
