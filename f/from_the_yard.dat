5|$|East of {{the station}} there is a flying {{junction}} that connects to the Jamaica Yard via a wye that curves east <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> towards Briarwood. A second side of the wye curves west to become {{a lower level of}} the subway just west {{of the station}}. The yard itself is situated just north of the station in the southern portion of Flushing Meadows–Corona Park, between the Grand Central Parkway and the Van Wyck Expressway.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the planned extension, the two tracks {{continue}} east of this station for about 700 feet along 205th Street to Webster Avenue, ending at a concrete wall, and this station does not have any crew quarters. Crews are changed at Bedford Park Boulevard, the next station south. Additionally, there is no diamond crossover between the tracks west of this station; here, a center track forms leading west to the Concourse Yard. Because of this, terminating trains arrive on the southern (railroad northbound) track and discharge their passengers before continuing east {{to the end of the}} track. They then use the diamond crossover there to return to this station on the northern (railroad southbound) track and begin service to Manhattan and Brooklyn. Due to the track configuration, trains may reverse into the yard from the southern track, and trains <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> may start service on the northern track.|$|E
5|$|Low's tactics {{consisted}} {{primarily of}} hoisting false colours and approaching an unsuspecting vessel. Off {{the coast of}} St John's, Newfoundland, Low mistook a fully armed man-of-war for a fishing boat, and barely escaped. He moved on to Conception Bay, capturing a number of boats around the Grand Banks southeast of Newfoundland before crossing the Atlantic to the Azores. There, he captured a French (or Portuguese—sources differ) pink, a narrow-sterned former man of war, which Low rearmed and refitted as his new flagship, naming it the Rose Pink. He also captured an English vessel with two Portuguese passengers aboard. Low had his crew hoist them up and drop them back down <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> arm several times, until they died. He {{moved on to the}} Canaries, Cape Verde and then back across to the coast of Brazil, where he was driven back by foul weather.|$|E

5|$|As in England, {{commissions}} of new statuary {{tended to}} be made in relatively cheap lead and even more economical painted or gilded plaster. The plasterwork of John Cheere's yard in London was particularly in demand. Also important was the work <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> of John Bacon (1740–99) who produced a monument for Robert Dundas (d. 1787) at Borthwick Church and one for Mrs Allardyce (d. 1787) at West Church, Aberdeen. Bacon was also a partner in Mrs Eleanor Coade's Artificial Stone Manufactory at Lambeth in London. This produced a buff coloured ceramic that could be moulded to provide fine detail, and be fired in sections, but was impervious to frost and fire. Much cheaper than carved stone, Coade stone was used for sphinxes, balustrading, capitals, coat of arms, tablets, ornamental vases, church monuments and fonts. It was used extensively by the Adam brothers, particularly in the houses they built in Scotland, such as Cullen, Banff, Culzean Castle, Ayrshire, Dunbar Castle, East Lothian, Register House, Edinburgh, Gosford House, East Lothian and Wedderburn, Berwickshire. As well as supplying sculpture, candelabra and cippi, the Adam family supplied designs to the Carron Company, founded in 1759, which produced a wide range of iron products, including stoves, safes, vases and tablets.|$|E
5|$|In {{the eighteenth}} century the {{development}} of the Grand Tour took young Scottish aristocrats to the continent, particularly Rome, which was home to the exiled Jacobite Stuarts. This in turn fuelled interest in classical and Renaissance styles, and the buying of artistic works, particularly sculptures. However, the only major Scottish collection of marble before the nineteenth century was that of James Johnstone, 2nd Marquess of Annandale. As in England, commissions of new statuary tended to be crafted in relatively cheap lead and even more economical painted or gilded plaster. The plasterwork of John Cheere's yard in London was particularly in demand. Also important was the work <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> of John Bacon (1740–99). Bacon was also a partner in Mrs Eleanor Coade's Artificial Stone Manufactory at Lambeth in London. This produced a buff coloured ceramic that could be moulded to provide fine detail, and be fired in sections, but was impervious to frost and fire. Much cheaper than carved stone, Coadstone was used for sphinxes, balustrading, capitals, coats of arms, tablets and ornamental vases. It was used extensively by the Adam brothers, particularly in the houses they built in Scotland, such as Cullen, Banff, Culzean Castle, Ayrshire, Dunbar Castle, East Lothian, Gosford House, East Lothian and Wedderburn, Berwickshire. They also supplied sculpture, candelabra and cippi that made up the neo-classical Adam Style.|$|E

25|$|Following {{her return}} to Pearl on 26 April 1961, Carpenter entered Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard on 22 May for ASW modernization. Emerging <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> in August with a new {{helicopter}} flight deck and a side-scanning AN/SQS-26 sonar to improve her submarine detection capabilities, she {{spent the rest of}} the year conducting refresher training and local operations designed to test her newly installed equipment.|$|E
25|$|The small 174th Street Yard lies under Broadway, {{with two}} tracks exiting {{to the south}} under that roadway. When the George Washington Bridge was {{designed}} in the 1920s, provisions were made for a lower deck that would carry these two tracks north <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> and across the bridge, {{as well as two}} commuter rail tracks. However, when the lower level was added in 1962, it instead carried a roadway.|$|E
25|$|On 2 April 1941, Astoria {{departed}} Pearl Harbor for {{the west}} coast of the United States. She reached Long Beach, California on 8 April and entered the Mare Island Navy Yard on the 13th. During her refit, she received quadruple-mount /75 cal anti-aircraft guns and a pedestal fitted at her foremast in anticipation of the imminent installation of the new air-search radar. Emerging <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> on 11 July 1941, the heavy cruiser sailed for Long Beach on the 16th. Later shifting to San Pedro, Astoria sailed for Pearl Harbor on 24 July 1941.|$|E

50|$|On VTA maps, {{this line}} is colored orange, but VTA {{personnel}} does not {{call it the}} Orange Line, much less {{refer to it as}} the Line 900 on official documents. The system's other two lines are the Alum Rock-Santa Teresa line and the Mountain View-Winchester line. Twice per day, a train <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Alum Rock-Santa Teresa line will throughrun <b>from</b> <b>the</b> VTA <b>yards</b> south of Gish station to serve the Almaden Shuttle. <b>The</b> train arrives <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>yards</b> early in <b>the</b> morning and leaves for <b>the</b> <b>yards</b> again after <b>the</b> last Almaden Shuttle run of the evening.|$|R
60|$|The first {{reception}} over, {{the smoke of}} the cannonading salute having cleared away, and the martial outburst of the brass band having also rolled off to leeward, the people were called down <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>yards,</b> and <b>the</b> drum beat to quarters.|$|R
25|$|On 10 October 1973 the Yom Kippur War begun, {{causing the}} 1973 oil crisis, tripling oil prices to US$10 per barrel, halting {{economic}} growth. Newly build ships sometimes went straight <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> to lay-up. The situation worsened when the Suez Canal was reopened in 1975. Just {{when the situation}} began to improve in 1979, the Iranian Revolution caused the second oil crisis, causing oil prices to rise to US$30. Ships were sometimes sent to the breakers after being in service for only ten years. It took {{until the end of}} the 1980s before any profits were being made in oil transport.|$|E
25|$|The {{two main}} tracks from Fort Washington Avenue enter Broadway near 171st Street, running {{underneath}} the yard tracks in a double-decker tunnel. A few blocks later, the lower tracks separate to straddle the yard tracks at 168th Street. The local/express split begins here, {{with the local}} tracks coming <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> and the express tracks coming from Inwood. Contrary to standard practice, the two local tracks are {{in the center and}} the two express tracks are on the outside. Except during late nights, the local service (C) ends at 168th Street, reversing direction on the yard tracks; the A runs to 207th Street at all times, express except during late nights. South of 168th Street, the express (outer) tracks lower below the local tracks, forming another double-decker tunnel, this time under St. Nicholas Avenue.|$|E
25|$|On 9 April 1799, after reconnoitering two French frigates in L'Orient, St Fiorenzo and HMS Amelia sailed towards Belle Île. Conditions were hazy and {{although}} Neale had sighted some vessels, {{it was only}} when he had passed the island that he discovered three French frigates and a large gun vessel. At that instant a sudden squall carried away Amelias main-top-mast and fore and mizzen top-gallant masts; the fall of the main-top-mast tore away much of the mainsail <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard.</b> Neale shortened St Fiorenzos sail and ordered Amelia to keep close to St Fiorenzo to maintain the weather gage, and to prepare for battle. An action commenced but the French vessels avoided close-quarter action and, although the British ships came under fire from shore batteries, they had to bear down on the French three times to engage them. After nearly two hours the French wore ship and sailed away to take refuge in the Loire, with the gun-vessel returning to Belle Île.|$|E
25|$|HMS Daedalus was a 32-gun fifth rate frigate of the Royal Navy, {{launched}} in 1780 <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>yards</b> of John Fisher, of Liverpool. She {{went on to}} serve in the American War of Independence, as well as the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars.|$|R

500|$|Away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard,</b> the {{surroundings}} become residential once more for another four blocks before entering a heavily industrial neighborhood around an intersection with NY31. Farther north in Lewiston, the center turn lane becomes a hard median as it widens {{in preparation for}} a pseudo-interchange with Highland Avenue. The median reverts to its previous width shortly after Highland merges into Hyde Park Boulevard; however, the median ends two blocks later at a service road for the Robert Moses Niagara Power Plant. NY61, now a four-lane undivided highway once again, continues for another [...] {{to the top of the}} Niagara River gorge, where it ends at NY104 south of the Moses Power Plant and adjacent to the campus of Niagara University.|$|E
