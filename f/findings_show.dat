5|$|Although {{the concern}} for a thiomersal-autism link was {{originally}} derived from indirect evidence based on the known potent neurotoxic effects of methylmercury, recent studies show these feared effects were likely overestimated. Ethylmercury, such as in thiomersal, clears much faster from the body after administration than methylmercury, suggesting total mercury exposure over time is much less with ethylmercury. Currently used methods of estimating brain deposition of mercury likely overestimates the amounts deposited due to ethylmercury, and ethylmercury also decomposes quicker in the brain than methylmercury, suggesting a lower risk of brain damage. These <b>findings</b> <b>show</b> that the assumptions that originally led to concern about the toxicity of ethylmercury, which were based on direct comparison to methylmercury, were flawed.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological <b>findings</b> <b>show</b> {{human use}} of ivory to date {{back more than}} 35,000 years. It has been {{exported}} to Europe since at least Classical antiquity, but exporting accelerated during the Age of Exploration and colonisation of Africa. At its peak, {{at the end of}} the 19th century and early 20th century, with the rise of mass production, well over 1000 tons of ivory were exported to Europe yearly. In the last quarter of the 19th century, the city of Sheffield, England alone imported 180 tons just for cutlery handles. In the 1970s, Japan became the largest consumer of ivory, accounting for about 40% of all trade worldwide, with Hong Kong acting as the largest trade hub.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} {{to the study of}} bilingualism in children, similar research is being conducted in adults. Research <b>findings</b> <b>show</b> that although bilingual benefits are muted in middle adulthood, they are more profound in older age when those who develop dementia experience onset about 4.5 years later in bilingual subjects. The increased attentional control, inhibition, and conflict resolution developed from bilingualism may be accountable for the later onset of dementia.|$|E

25|$|The {{fact that}} {{there seem to be}} no clear {{transitions}} makes it difficult to draw up a list of unique characteristics of H. heidelbergensis that distinguishes it from H. erectus and H. neanderthalensis. In general, the <b>findings</b> <b>show</b> a continuation of evolutionary trends that are emerging from around the Lower into Middle Pleistocene. Along with changes in the robustness of cranial and dental features, a remarkable increase in brain size from H. erectus towards H. heidelbergensis is noticeable.|$|E

25|$|Another example {{would be}} a left neglect patient failing to {{describe}} left turns while describing a familiar route. This shows that the failure to describe things in the contralesional side can also affect verbal items. These <b>findings</b> <b>show</b> that space representation is more topological than symbolic. Patients show a contralesional loss of space representation with a deviation of spatial reference to the ipsilesional side. In these cases we see a left-right dissimilarity of representation rather than a decline of representational competence.|$|E
25|$|According to fMRI {{studies of}} the brain and {{behavioral}} observations, visual attention can be moved independently of moving eye position. Studies have had participants fixate their eyes on a central point and measured brain activity as stimuli were presented outside the visual fixation point. fMRI <b>findings</b> <b>show</b> changes in brain activity correlated with the shift in spatial attention to the various stimuli. Behavioral studies have also shown that when a person knows where a stimulus is likely to appear, their attention can shift to it more rapidly and process it better.|$|E
25|$|Social Reward Dependence {{has also}} been {{associated}} with the temporal lobes, the caudate Grey Matter Density (GMD) in the orbitofrontal cortex and the basal ganglia of the ventral striatum. These structures, which are rich in dopamine receptors, are known to {{play a crucial role in}} reward receipt, Incentive anticipation and simple and discrete primary and secondary rewards prediction errors. These significant <b>findings</b> <b>show</b> a correlation between primary reward processing circuits and reward dependence, keeping with the fMRI research studies that demonstrated that, following the experience of complex rewards the activation of the striatal circuits occur.|$|E

25|$|Water {{resources}} that span international boundaries {{are more likely}} to be a source of collaboration and cooperation than war. Scientists working at the International Water Management Institute have been investigating the evidence behind water war predictions. Their <b>findings</b> <b>show</b> that, while it is true there has been conflict related to water in a handful of international basins, in the rest of the world’s approximately 300 shared basins the record has been largely positive. This is exemplified by the hundreds of treaties in place guiding equitable water use between nations sharing water resources. The institutions created by these agreements can, in fact, be one of the most important factors in ensuring cooperation rather than conflict.|$|E
25|$|Within the Cardamone et al. paper, {{comparisons}} {{are made with}} other compact galaxies, namely Blue Compact Dwarfs Galaxies and UV-luminous Galaxies, at local and much higher distances. The <b>findings</b> <b>show</b> that GPs form a different class of galaxies than Ultra Blue Compact Dwarfs, but may {{be similar to the}} most luminous members of the Blue Compact Dwarf Galaxy category. The GPs are also similar to UV-luminous high redshift galaxies such as Lyman-break Galaxies and Lyman-alpha emitter. It is concluded that if the underlying processes occurring in the GPs are similar to that found in the UV-luminous high redshift galaxies, the GPs may be the last remnants of a mode of star formation common in the early Universe.|$|E
25|$|As {{almost any}} cereal {{containing}} certain sugars can undergo spontaneous fermentation due to wild yeasts in the air, {{it is possible}} that beer-like beverages were independently developed throughout the world soon after a tribe or culture had domesticated cereal. Chemical tests of ancient pottery jars reveal that beer was produced about 3,500 BC in what is today Iran, {{and was one of the}} first-known biological engineering tasks where the biological process of fermentation is used. Also, archaeological <b>findings</b> <b>show</b> that Chinese villagers were brewing fermented alcoholic drinks as far back as 7000 BC on small and individual scale, with the production process and methods similar to that of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia.|$|E

25|$|The {{woolly mammoth}} (M. primigenius) {{was the last}} species of the genus. Most populations of the woolly mammoth in North America and Eurasia, {{as well as all}} the Columbian mammoths (M. columbi) in North America, died out {{around the time of the}} last glacial retreat, as part of a mass {{extinction}} of megafauna in northern Eurasia and the Americas. Until recently, the last woolly mammoths were generally assumed to have vanished from Europe and southern Siberia about 12,000 years ago, but new <b>findings</b> <b>show</b> some were still present there about 10,000 years ago. Slightly later, the woolly mammoths also disappeared from continental northern Siberia. A small population survived on St. Paul Island, Alaska, up until 3750BC, and the small mammoths of Wrangel Island survived until 1650BC. Recent research of sediments in Alaska indicates mammoths survived on the American mainland until 10,000 years ago.|$|E
25|$|Archaeological <b>findings</b> <b>show</b> people {{settled in}} the middle alpine region, later to be called Tyrol, when the glaciers retreated and flora and fauna revived, after {{the last ice age}} ended around 12,000 BC. Artifacts found on the Seiser Alm date to the Upper Paleolithic era. In the valley bottoms near Bolzano, Brixen and Salorno, {{mesolithic}} hunters resting places were discovered. Stone artefacts recovered there were dated to the 8th millennia BC. Discovery of Ötzi on the Similaun glacier in 1991 proved man had already crossed the highest Alpine passes 5000 years ago. Sedentary settlements of farmers and herders {{can be traced back to}} 5000 BC. There is ample evidence of settlements in the main and side valleys during the early and middle Bronze Age (1800-1300 BC). Preferred settlement sites were sunny terraces on the valleys slopes, and hill tops in the middle heights.|$|E
25|$|Their <b>findings</b> <b>show</b> {{that the}} three GPs display {{relatively}} low Extinction (astronomy), low oxygen abundances and high nitrogen-to-oxygen ratios. Also reported are the clear signatures of Wolf–Rayet stars, of which a population are found (between ~800 and ~1200). A combination of population and evolutionary synthesis models strongly suggest a formation history dominated by starbursts. These models show that these three GPs currently undergo a major starburst producing between ~4% and ~20% of their stellar mass. However, as these models imply, they are old galaxies having formed most of their stellar mass several billion years ago. The presence of old stars has been spectroscopically verified {{in one of the}} three galaxies by the detection of Magnesium. Surface photometry, using data from the Hubble Space Telescope archive, indicates {{that the three}} GPs possess an exponential low surface brightness envelope (see Low-surface-brightness galaxy). This suggests that GPs are identifiable with major episodes in the assembly history of local Blue Compact Dwarf galaxies.|$|E
