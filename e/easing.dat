5|$|Although the U.S. {{administration}} has denied that devaluing their currency {{was part of}} their objectives for implementing quantitative <b>easing,</b> the practice can act to devalue a country's currency in two indirect ways. Firstly, it can encourage speculators to bet that the currency will decline in value. Secondly, the large increase in the domestic money supply will lower domestic interest rates, often they will become much lower than interest rates in countries not practising quantitative <b>easing.</b> This creates the conditions for a carry trade, where market participants can engage in a form of arbitrage, borrowing in the currency of the country practising quantitative <b>easing,</b> and lending {{in a country with}} a relatively high rate of interest. Because they are effectively selling the currency being used for quantitative <b>easing</b> on the international markets, this can increase the supply of the currency and hence push down its value. By October 2010 expectations in the markets were high that the United States, UK, and Japan would soon embark on a second round of QE, with the prospects for the Eurozone to join them less certain.|$|E

When comparing literature, this <b>ease</b> study showed a smaller amount of <b>ease</b> {{than that in}} other studies (Nam and Lee 2005; Kwak et al. 2008), which documented 1  cm. The average front crotch <b>ease</b> was 0.43  cm. This minimum <b>ease</b> was also 0  cm and the maximum <b>ease</b> was 1  cm.

40|$|When the {{three-dimensional}} garment style {{was transformed into}} the two-dimensional garment pattern, the information of <b>ease</b> distribution was crucial because the <b>ease</b> of the garment {{was one of the}} important elements in constructing garment style. To model the <b>ease</b> distribution of X-line style jackets, the <b>ease</b> distribution was qualitatively presented by the shapes of cross section at different altitude.

A mathematical model of <b>ease</b> distribution was established in the X-line style jacket by using the surface fitting approach, which may predict the <b>ease</b> distribution of jackets in different dimensions. The <b>ease</b> distribution models of bustline, waistline, and hipline in X-line style of jackets were satisfactory because of lower root-mean-square error, especially compared with the actually measured data.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} the proper amount of hip <b>ease</b> in the skirt lining. We carried out a wear test comparing the skirts that differed in hip <b>ease.</b> The outer fabrics were denim and jersey，which were equal in thickness，and bemberg taffeta was used for the 	lining fabric. The amount of hip <b>ease</b> in the skirt was 2 cm， 6 cm and 10 cm <b>ease</b> for the outer 	fabrics，and 0 cm to 10 cm <b>ease</b> for the lining. Six female subjects were asked to judge the 	single and combination of skirts with regard to garment fit at 14 different positions and 	overall comfort. The wearers graded fit and comfort on a scale from - 2 to + 2. 	There were significant differences in overall comfort between the outer fabrics，the hip 	<b>ease</b> of outer skirts and that of skirt lining. When the amount of hip <b>ease</b> was 2 cm for the 	outer skirts，the subjects felt tightness，regardless of hip <b>ease</b> in the lining. However，they felt 	comfortable or moderately loose over 6 cm <b>ease</b> for the lining on condition that the amount 	of hip <b>ease</b> was 6 cm or 10 cm <b>ease</b> for the outer skirts.

5|$|However, the {{financial}} crisis of 2007–08 ended this period of stability, and, on 16 April 2007, the governor (at that time Mervyn King), was obliged to write the first MPC open letter to the chancellor (Gordon Brown), explaining why the inflation had deviated from the target of 2% per year {{by more than one}} percentage point (3.1%). By February 2013, he had had to write 14 such letters to chancellors. Between October 2008 and March 2009 the base rate was cut six times to an all-time low of 0.5% in order to avoid deflation and spur growth. In March 2009, the MPC launched a programme of quantitative <b>easing,</b> initially injecting £75 billion into the economy. By March 2010, it had also increased the amount of money set aside for quantitative <b>easing</b> to £200 billion, a figure later increased by a further £75 billion in the months following October 2011. The MPC announced two further £50 billion rounds of quantitative <b>easing</b> in February and July 2012, bringing the total to £375 billion whilst simultaneously keeping the base rate at 0.5%. In March 2013, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, called on the MPC to follow its American counterpart (the Federal Reserve Board) in committing itself to keeping interest rates low for a prolonged period of time via appropriate forward guidance, which it did on 7 August.|$|E

40|$|Calving <b>ease</b> is of {{economic}} importance in dairy cattle {{and should be}} considered in breeding programs. Economic values of direct and maternal calving <b>ease</b> were derived based on cost-benefit analysis and gene flow methodology.

For an average mate, numbers of discounted expressions for sires to breed replacements were. 58 [...] 44, and. 63 for direct and maternal calving <b>ease</b> and production. Discounted expressions for direct calving <b>ease</b> were higher when sires were mated to primiparous versus multiparous dams.

Strategies 2 and 3 allowed for assortative mating of sires with favorable direct calving <b>ease</b> to primiparous females subsequent to selection. Strategy 2 resulted in maximal economic response.

2500|$|The {{difficulty}} of deep dyslexics in reading abstract words has {{been referred to}} as the [...] "imageability effect". According to this idea, the <b>ease</b> with which a mental image can be created for a word is strongly related to the <b>ease</b> of reading the word. In an attempt to explain this relationship, researchers have developed a variable to link the mental imagery created by a word and the <b>ease</b> of reading it. This variable, <b>ease</b> of predication, is a rating of {{how easy it is to}} come up with simple factual statements or attributes of a word. For example, when presented with the word [...] "dog", an individual may come up with statements, or predicates, such as [...] "has four legs", [...] "is an animal", or [...] "barks and wags its tail".
