40|$|In {{order to}} raise yarn quality, a new {{drafting}} system concept for ring spinning machines is developed in this study, {{along with an}} analysis of its controlling effects. To optimize the new drafting system, its structural parameters are studied and two empirical equations <b>for</b> <b>yarn</b> unevenness and nep count model its design. The equation of yarn unevenness is used to find the optimum structural parameters of the new drafting system. Practical spinning tests with the optimized system prove that it can reduce unevenness, thin places, thick places, and neps in spun yarns, and that the equation <b>for</b> <b>yarn</b> unevenness {{can be used to}} satisfactorily estimate the unevenness of spun yarns. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
