5|$|Hull {{attempted}} {{to join the}} South African Air Force in 1935, but was turned <b>down</b> <b>because</b> he did not speak Afrikaans. He joined the Royal Air Force (RAF) instead, enlisting in England in September 1935. Completing the pilot's course on 3 August 1936 with the rank of pilot officer, he joined No. 43 Squadron at RAF Tangmere in Sussex five days later.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, Richard Garfield {{approached}} Wizards of the Coast {{with the}} idea for a new board game called RoboRally, but was turned <b>down</b> <b>because</b> the game would have been too expensive for Wizards of the Coast to produce. Instead, Adkison asked Garfield if he could invent a game that was both portable and quick-playing, to which Garfield agreed.|$|E

5|$|Marseille {{developed}} his own special tactics, which differed {{significantly from the}} methods of most other pilots. (When attacking a Lufbery circle) he had to fly very slowly. He even {{took it to the}} point where he had to operate his landing flaps as not to fall <b>down,</b> <b>because,</b> of course he had to fly his curve (turns) more tightly than the upper defensive circle. He and his fighter were one unit, and he was in command of that aircraft like no-one else.|$|E
5|$|On June 7, 2007, the Conservative {{government}} announced it had finalized free trade {{negotiations with the}} European Free Trade Association (EFTA). Under this agreement, Canada increased its trade ties with Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Liechtenstein. In 2006, the value of trade between these partners was $10.7 billion. Canada had originally begun negotiations with the EFTA on October 9, 1998, but talks broke <b>down</b> <b>because</b> of a disagreement over subsidies to shipyards in Atlantic Canada.|$|E
5|$|The wartime Allies {{initially}} {{worked together}} {{under the auspices of}} the Allied Control Council (ACC) for Germany. Cooperation between the Western Allies and the Soviets ultimately broke <b>down</b> <b>because</b> of disagreements over Germany's political and economic future. In May 1949, the three western occupation zones were merged to form the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) with a freely elected government. The Soviet zone became the German Democratic Republic (GDR), under communist rule.|$|E

5000|$|From the report, US {{intelligence}} {{assumed that}} three bombers had been <b>downed</b> <b>because</b> Lt. Besby F. Holmes claimed the [...] "Betty" [...] that {{crashed into the}} sea. None of the remaining pilots were debriefed after the mission because no formal interrogation procedures existed on Guadalcanal at that time. Likewise Lanphier's claim of the kill was never officially witnessed. Many of the other mission's pilots soon became skeptical about the official US Army version.|$|R

5|$|Cartman's {{involvement}} with the fried chicken black market closely mirrors {{the plot of the}} 1983 crime film Scarface, with Cartman in the role of Tony Montana, and Colonel Sanders in the role of Alejandro Sosa. In the episode, Cartman travels to a foreign land to meet a dealer, usurps the illegal operation from his local boss, and is ultimately brought <b>down</b> <b>because</b> he becomes addicted to his own product, plot points that mirror the plot of Scarface. Specific scenes patterned after ones in Scarface, include one in which Cartman watches Tommy being executed by being hanged from a helicopter, and the final scene in which Cartman's compound is attacked by gunmen. The episode also includes references to the 1991 crime film New Jack City.|$|E
5|$|Distressed by the {{occupation}} of Khafji, Saudi commander General Khaled bin Sultan appealed to American General Norman Schwarzkopf for an immediate air campaign against Iraqi forces {{in and around the}} city. However this was turned <b>down</b> <b>because</b> the buildings would make it difficult for aircraft to spot targets without getting too close. It was instead decided that the city would be retaken by Arab ground forces. The task fell to the 2nd Saudi Arabian National Guard Brigade's 7th Battalion, composed of Saudi infantry and two Kuwaiti tank companies attached to the task force. These were supported by U.S. Army Special Forces and Marine Reconnaissance personnel.|$|E
5|$|Following Sean Connery's {{announcement}} {{that he would}} not play James Bond again, Eastwood was offered the role but turned it <b>down</b> <b>because</b> he believed the character should be played by an English actor. He next starred in the loner Western Joe Kidd (1972), based on a character inspired by Reies Lopez Tijerina, who stormed a courthouse in Tierra Amarilla, New Mexico in June 1967. During filming, Eastwood suffered symptoms of a bronchial infection and several panic attacks. Joe Kidd received a mixed reception, with Roger Greenspun of The New York Times writing that it was unremarkable, with foolish symbolism and sloppy editing, although he praised Eastwood's performance.|$|E
50|$|Hardy {{recovered}} from his injury and {{played for the}} Cowboys in the 2002 NFL season, finishing the season ranked third on the team in both total (114) and solo tackles (60), also had two quarterback sacks and three forced fumbles. He played outside linebacker, lining up as a defensive end in some passing <b>downs.</b> <b>Because</b> of salary cap issues, he was released on February 27, 2003, {{in order to avoid}} a $5.025 million option bonus if the Cowboys retained him.|$|R
5000|$|... 2006: Started all 16 {{regular season}} games (the fifth {{time in his}} 9-year {{professional}} career). Finished the season with 37 tackles (30 solo), 4.0 sacks, 1 forced fumble, 1 fumble recovery and 1 pass defensed. However, he played only 56 percent of the <b>downs</b> <b>because</b> of injuries {{and the arrival of}} pass-rushing linebacker Julian Peterson in free agency. Peterson replaced Wistrom as the right end in passing situations. As a result, Wistrom had the fewest tackles since his rookie season with the Rams.|$|R

5|$|For Galileo, {{the tides}} {{were caused by}} the {{sloshing}} back and forth {{of water in the}} seas as a point on the Earth's surface sped up and slowed <b>down</b> <b>because</b> of the Earth's rotation on its axis and revolution around the Sun. He circulated his first account of the tides in 1616, addressed to Cardinal Orsini. His theory gave the first insight into the importance of the shapes of ocean basins in the size and timing of tides; he correctly accounted, for instance, for the negligible tides halfway along the Adriatic Sea compared to those at the ends. As a general account of the cause of tides, however, his theory was a failure.|$|E
5|$|For their {{action on}} December 7, the U.S. War Department in Communiqué No. 19 on December 13, 1941, {{designated}} Taylor and Welch {{as the first}} two American heroes of World War II, and awarded both the Distinguished Service Cross on January 8, 1942. Taylor learned {{that he was to}} receive the award in mid-December after reading several newspapers. The award is the United States Army's second highest honor for valor in the heat of combat. Additionally, he later received the Distinguished Service Medal, the Legion of Merit, the Air Medal, and a Purple Heart for injuries he sustained. Both men were recommended for the Medal of Honor, but were turned <b>down</b> <b>because</b> they had taken off without orders.|$|E
5|$|Having been {{interested}} in aviation {{since he was a}} boy, Plagis volunteered for the Southern Rhodesian Air Force (SRAF) soon after the outbreak of war in September 1939. He was turned <b>down</b> <b>because</b> {{he was the son of}} foreign nationals and therefore not a citizen, despite having lived in Rhodesia all his life. After Italy invaded Greece in late October 1940, bringing the Greeks into the war on the Allied side, Plagis applied again—this time to join the Royal Air Force, which had absorbed the SRAF in April 1940—and was accepted. Training first in Southern Rhodesia, then England, Plagis passed out with the rank of flight sergeant in June 1941 with above-average ratings in all of his flying assessments.|$|E

The letter authorized him to engage in offensive action against the French, should the opportunity arise, and not just defensive action. On her return voyage she reached St Helena on 21 March 1806 and arrived at the Downs on 14 June.|$|R

5|$|In 2000, Lone Hvass of the Elsinore Museum, Miranda Aldhouse-Green of Cardiff University, and the Department of Forensic Science at the University of Århus {{performed}} a re-examination of the Haraldskær Woman. Forensic analysis revealed stomach contents of unhusked millet and blackberries. Her neck had a faint groove {{as if someone}} applied a rope for torture or strangulation. The scientists concluded bog acids caused the swelling of the knee joint and that the woman was probably already dead before the branches pinned her <b>down.</b> <b>Because</b> of her careful placement, and since cremation was the prevailing mode of interment during that period in Jutland, the examiners guess the Haraldskær Woman {{was a victim of}} ritual sacrifice.|$|E
5|$|In June 2012, Watson was {{confirmed}} {{for the role}} as Ila in Darren Aronofsky's Noah, which began filming the following month, and was released in March 2014. In March 2013, {{it was reported that}} Watson was in negotiations to star as the title character in a live-action Disney adaptation of Cinderella. Kenneth Branagh was attached to direct the adaptation, while Cate Blanchett had reportedly agreed to play the evil stepmother. Watson was offered the role, but turned it <b>down</b> <b>because</b> she did not connect with the character. The role ultimately went to Lily James.|$|E

5|$|Inquirer {{journalist}} Uriah Hunt Painter {{was at the}} First Battle of Bull Run in 1861, {{a battle}} which ended in a Confederate victory. Initial reports from the government claimed a Union victory, but The Inquirer went with Painter's firsthand account. Crowds threatened to burn The Inquirers building <b>down</b> <b>because</b> of the report. Another report, this time about General George Meade, angered Meade enough that he punished Edward Crapsey, the reporter who wrote it. Crapsey and other war correspondents later decided to attribute any victories of the Army of the Potomac, Meade's command, to Ulysses S. Grant, commander of the entire Union army. Any defeats of the Army of the Potomac would be attributed to Meade.|$|E
5|$|Jud Dunlevy {{kicked the}} ball, which {{traveled}} the regulation 10yards, but was recovered by Kansas. The Hokies, despite failing {{to recover the}} onside kick, still had a chance for another offensive possession if they stopped Kansas' offense short of a first <b>down.</b> <b>Because</b> the Hokies had two timeouts remaining, they could stop the clock after two Kansas plays, thus preserving time for a Virginia Tech offensive drive. An 11-yard pass by Todd Reesing netted Kansas a first down, however, and subsequent runs by the Jayhawks allowed Kansas to run out the clock despite the Virginia Tech timeouts. Kansas preserved its lead by kneeling on the ball inside the Virginia Tech 5-yard line on the final plays of the game, and the 2421 victory was celebrated as time ran out.|$|E

Stephen Chbosky, who directed The Perks of Being a Wallflower (also filmed in Pittsburgh), was in talks to direct the film but turned it <b>down</b> <b>because</b> of its similarity to Perks. On February 19, 2013, Josh Boone was hired as director; Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber were hired to adapt the novel into a screenplaytheir second adaptation for Fox, following Rosaline.|$|E
