25|$|Shortly after that, in August of 2016, the SB 32 was passed, which {{changed the}} target for green house gas (GHG) {{reduction}} to 40% below the levels in 1990, {{to be achieved}} by 2030. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>anticipated</b> that this {{will lead to the}} tightening of LCFS standards from 2020 all the way through 2030.|$|E
25|$|The Rans S-20 Raven is an American homebuilt {{aircraft}} {{that was designed}} by Randy Schlitter and is produced by Rans Designs of Hays, Kansas, introduced at AirVenture in August 2013.

40|$|In Brisbane {{and across}} Australia more generally, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{apparent}} {{that the use of}} information technology (<b>IT)</b> <b>is</b> becoming increasingly important to community organisations in their capacity to deliver services effectively. IT support represents a fundamental component of this. However, the quality and effectiveness of different forms of IT support in these organisations varies greatly. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>anticipated,</b> therefore, that the Feasibility Study would provide some answers to whether a more effective model could <b>be</b> implemented. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>anticipated</b> that the findings would also assist in assessing the long-term demand and self-sustainability of such a centralised service model...|$|R
25|$|On April 12, 2010, it was {{reported}} that a fourth suspect, an as-yet unidentified Pakistani citizen, was arrested in Pakistan. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>anticipated</b> that he will be extradited to the U.S., and tried in Brooklyn Federal Court with Medunjanin and Ahmedzay on charges that he helped orchestrate the planned attack.

25|$|The {{benefits}} of the A-kit/B-kit principle are that armor is only fitted when required, reducing vehicle wear and tear and, by default, whole life cycle costs. Improvements and/or upgrades to armor are also far easier to integrate into an appliqué solution. No quantity for JLTV armoring kits has yet been disclosed, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>anticipated</b> that the estimated $65,000 kits will be procured on a 'one kit to three vehicle' basis. The overall protection solution will include a spall liner to minimize perforation effects within a vehicle when the vehicle takes hostile fire.|$|E
25|$|Medical {{studies are}} {{conducted}} aboard the ISS {{on behalf of}} the National Space Biomedical Research Institute (NSBRI). Prominent among these is the Advanced Diagnostic Ultrasound in Microgravity study in which astronauts perform ultrasound scans under the guidance of remote experts. The study considers the diagnosis and treatment of medical conditions in space. Usually, there is no physician on board the ISS and diagnosis of medical conditions is a challenge. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>anticipated</b> that remotely guided ultrasound scans will have application on Earth in emergency and rural care situations where access to a trained physician is difficult.|$|E

25|$|Third {{generation}} sequencing {{technologies have}} demonstrated promising prospects {{in solving the}} problem of transcript detection as well as mRNA abundance estimation {{at the level of}} transcripts. While error rates remain high, third generation sequencing technologies have the capability to produce much longer read lengths. Pacific Bioscience has introduced the iso-seq platform, proposing to sequence mRNA molecules at their full lengths. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>anticipated</b> that Oxford Nanopore will put forth similar technologies. The trouble with higher error rates may be alleviated by supplementary high quality short reads. This approach has been previously tested and reported to reduce the error rate by more than 3 folds.|$|E
25|$|In 1990 it was {{estimated}} that 90 languages still survived of the approximately 250 once spoken, but with a high rate of attrition as elders died out. Of the 90, 70% by 2001 were judged as 'severely endangered' with only 17 spoken by all age groups, a definition of a 'strong ' language. On these grounds <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>anticipated</b> that despite efforts at linguistic preservation, many of the remaining languages will disappear within the next generation. The overall trend suggests that in the not too distant future all of the indigenous languages will be lost, perhaps by 2050, and with them the cultural knowledge they convey.|$|E
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>anticipated</b> that TMR will be {{modelled}} against driverless {{systems such}} as London's Docklands Light Railway, providing an anticipated peak frequency of five trains per hour and an off-peak frequency of three trains per hour.|$|R
