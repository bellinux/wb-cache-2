30|$|Future 5 G {{cellular}} systems need {{to support}} multigigabits per second (Gbps) cell capacity and tens of megabits per second (Mbps) cell edge throughput. Current cellular spectrums below 5 [*]GHz are constrained by the available bandwidth. Millimeter wave (mmWave) bands (30 – 300 [*]GHz) offer a solution because there are vast amounts of spectrum available in mmWave bands [22]. The small wavelengths allow for smaller massive multiple input and multiple output (MIMO) antenna arrays, making them suitable for implementation on both a base station (BTS) and UE. By using massive MIMO antenna arrays, significant beamforming gains can help to overcome the high propagation loss over the mmWave frequency, and the spatial reuse can reduce the interference found with intra- and <b>intercells.</b> Massive MIMO antenna array systems in mmWave bands are ideally suitable for high-capacity transmission and are considered {{an important part of}} 5 G.|$|R

50|$|DECT {{provides}} dynamic {{channel selection}} and assignment; {{the choice of}} transmission frequency and time slot is always made by the mobile terminal. In case of interference in the selected frequency channel, the mobile terminal (possibly from suggestion by the base station) can initiate either intracell handover, selecting another channel/transmitter on the same base, or <b>intercell</b> handover, selecting a different base station altogether. For this purpose, DECT devices scan all idle channels at regular 30 s intervals to generate a RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indication) list. When a new channel is required, the mobile terminal (PP) or base station (FP) selects a channel with the minimum interference from the RSSI list.|$|E

This model {{is capable of}} producing irregular angular fragments upon particle fragmentation while conserving the total volume. The particle is modeled as a cluster of rigid polyhedral cells generated by a Voronoi tessellation. The cells are bonded along their faces by a cohesive Tresca law with independent tensile and shear strengths and simulated by the contact dynamics method. Using this model, we analyze the mechanical response of a single particle subjected to diametral compression for varying number of cells, their degree of disorder, and <b>intercell</b> tensile and shear strength. In particular, we identify the functional dependence of particle strength on the <b>intercell</b> strengths. We find that two different regimes can be distinguished depending on whether <b>intercell</b> shear strength is below or above its tensile strength. In both regimes, we observe a power-law dependence of particle strength on both <b>intercell</b> strengths but with different exponents. The strong effect of <b>intercell</b> shear strength on the particle strength reflects an interlocking effect between cells. In fact, even at low tensile strength, the particle global strength can still considerably increase with <b>intercell</b> shear strength.

30|$|<b>Intercell</b> {{interference}} {{management techniques}} have recently attracted growing interest[2, 3]. The conventional non-cooperative {{approach is to}} treat <b>intercell</b> interference as noise at the receiver. This may be characterized as passive treatment. Another more proactive solution to manage <b>intercell</b> interference is to apply interference-aware multi-cell coordination at the base stations[4]. Such coordination methods require backhaul links to facilitate the base station cooperation via information exchange. The degree of cooperation defines a trade-off between the performance gains and the resulting signalling overhead. Some representative coordination-based methods are discussed in next paragraph.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a new {{scheme is}} {{developed}} for optimal location area design in wireless systems. New algorithms based on <b>intercell</b> traffic prediction and traffic-based cell grouping {{are used to}} select the optimal set of cells for location areas (LAs). The expected <b>intercell</b> movement patterns of mobiles are determined by using the new <b>intercell</b> traffic prediction algorithm. Further, the cells are partitioned into LAs by applying the new traffic-based cell grouping algorithm where the cell pairs with higher <b>intercell</b> mobile traffic are grouped into the same LA. Hence, the inter-LA mobile traffic is decreased by increasing the intra-LA mobile traffic. Experimental results show that this cell grouping algorithm reduces the number of location updates by 27 percent to 36 percent on average compared to proximity-based cell grouping schemes.

30|$|As {{the term}} ‘fractional’ implies, FFR {{attempts}} to find a compromise between the full frequency reuse scenario, which allocates the entire available bandwidth to each cell but {{at the expense of}} a maximum level of <b>intercell</b> interference, and the partial frequency reuse scenario, which provides zero <b>intercell</b> interference by orthogonally sharing the bandwidth among adjacent cells [10]. The idea behind FFR has come from the observation that user terminals (UTs) within a cell are not equivalent from an <b>intercell</b> interference point of view: due to the path-loss effect, cell-edge users are far more sensitive to it than users located {{near the center of the}} cell.|$|E
