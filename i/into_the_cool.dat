500|$|In Leng's description, the {{finished}} recording opens with Harrison's [...] "heaviest-ever intro" [...] – the [...] "shattering concoction" [...] of Harrison and Clapton's [...] "angry" [...] guitar riffs, [...] "sledgehammer" [...] drums from Gordon, and Wright's [...] "roaring" [...] Hammond organ – before the music [...] "slips <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cool</b> waters of a balmy, smooth sensuality" [...] {{for the first}} verse. The horns similarly adopt contrasting musical textures, providing a soft, [...] "Moonlight Bay"-like setting, as Spector put it, during the song's quieter moments. From its aggressive sound over the intro and choruses, Harrison's slide guitar reverts to a warmer tone, on a track that Leng views as Harrison developing his [...] "unique voice" [...] on slide guitar. Leng also highlights the [...] "gospel passion" [...] of Clapton and Whitlock's vocal contributions, as the so-called [...] "George O'Hara-Smith Singers".|$|E
500|$|In 1945 Las Vegas, World War II veteran Frank Harris {{returns from}} Italy with a {{motorcycle}} and reunites with his mother. However, Frank {{and his mother}} are struck in a traffic collision with a drunk driver while riding his motorcycle, resulting {{in the death of}} Frank's mother; Frank is transported to an animated realm named the [...] "Cool World". Forty-seven years later, detained cartoonist Jack Deebs creates a comic strip named Cool World, which features the femme fatale Holli Would. Holli voices her desire to enter the real world, but is declined help from Frank, who is now a detective in the Cool World. After being released from prison, Jack is transported to the Cool World and is smuggled into a club by Holli. Frank becomes aware of Jack's presence in the Cool World and aggressively confronts him, informing him that Cool World has existed long before Jack created the comic series and warns him that [...] "noids", humans from the real world, are not allowed to have sex with [...] "doodles", the inhabitants of the Cool World. Holli brings Jack back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cool</b> World and the two have sex, causing Holli to transform into a human.|$|E
2500|$|A related {{phenomenon}} {{occurs when}} the Santa Ana condition is present but weak, allowing hot dry air to accumulate in the inland valleys that may not push {{all the way to}} sea level. [...] Under these conditions auto commuters can drive from the San Fernando Valley where conditions are sunny and warm, over the low Santa Monica Mountains, to plunge <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cool</b> cloudy air, low clouds, and fog characteristic of the marine air mass. [...] This and the [...] "Santa Ana fog" [...] above constitute examples of an air inversion.|$|E
50|$|Macro fouling {{is caused}} by coarse matter of either {{biological}} or inorganic origin, for example industrially produced refuse. Such matter enters <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> water circuit through <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> water pumps from sources like the open sea, rivers or lakes. In closed circuits, like <b>cooling</b> towers, <b>the</b> ingress of macro fouling <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> tower basin is possible through open canals or by the wind. Sometimes, parts of <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> tower internals detach themselves and are carried <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> water circuit. Such substances can foul the surfaces of heat exchangers and may cause deterioration of the relevant heat transfer coefficient. They may also create flow blockages, redistribute the flow inside the components, or cause fretting damage.|$|R

50|$|In December 2009, a $1.1 billion {{emissions}} upgrade was completed. A new stack and <b>cooling</b> system reduced <b>the</b> {{amount of}} waste heat going <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> water discharge channel.|$|R
2500|$|The {{dry season}} lasts 6–8 months, divided <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cool</b> dry season or winter from April or May to August, {{followed}} by the hot dry season, September to November. Most rivers, lakes and swamps are permanent, except in the hotter, drier south. Along the banks of permanent rivers and in the spray of waterfalls are evergreen thickets similar in character to tropical rainforest, relics of a wetter past. In dambos (grasslands found {{in most of the}} country) and other marshes, soil water is available throughout the dry season, but they may be rather acidic.|$|E

5000|$|Fermentation. Put Hongqu <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> steamed rice, add water, stir evenly, {{and seal}} for {{fermentation}}. The fermentation temperature is controlled between 20 to 30 degrees {{and the time}} lasts about 7 days.|$|R

50|$|Tabletop or kitchen worktop {{versions}} are available which utilise readily available five-liter water bottles from supermarkets. These coolers use air pumps to push <b>the</b> water <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> chamber and Peltier devices to chill the water.|$|R
50|$|Natural draft: When air or flue gases flow {{due to the}} {{difference}} in density of the hot flue gases and <b>cooler</b> ambient gases. <b>The</b> difference in density creates a pressure differential that moves the hotter flue gases <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cooler</b> surroundings.|$|R

5000|$|Evaporative coolers, {{sometimes}} called [...] "swamp coolers", {{do not have}} a compressor or condenser. Liquid water is evaporated on <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> fins, releasing <b>the</b> vapor <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cooled</b> area. Evaporating water absorbs a significant amount of heat, the latent heat of vaporisation, <b>cooling</b> <b>the</b> air. Humans and animals use the same mechanism to cool themselves by sweating.|$|R

50|$|Starting in the 1980s Sony began {{incorporating}} {{heat pipes}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> schemes {{for some of}} its commercial electronic products in place of both forced convection and passive finned heat sinks.

5000|$|An {{expansion}} tank {{is also used}} in <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> system of most internal combustion engines, to allow the coolant, the antifreeze, and {{the air in the}} system to expand with rising temperature and pressure. The tank is also called a [...] "coolant recovery tank", since it prevents venting and permanent loss of coolant, by allowing it to be sucked back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> system as <b>the</b> engine <b>cools.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... 11. Cooling TowerReturn {{water from}} the Coldry heat {{exchange}} is now at a lower temperature, but still requires further cooling. This water is now pumped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> tower, where a portion evaporates, <b>cooling</b> <b>the</b> remainder down to suitable temperatures for the condenser operation. Make up water is added to replace that which was lost to evaporation.|$|R
50|$|After {{the aquatic}} organisms are {{impinged}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> system, they are discharged back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> bay as sediment.
