40|$|Background. Bacillus {{species are}} aerobic or facultative anaerobic, gram-positive, or gram-variable spore-forming rods. They are {{ubiquitous}} {{in the environmental}} sources. Bacillus anthracis may usually cause three forms of anthrax: inhalation, gastrointestinal, and cutaneous. The gastrointestinal (GI) anthrax develops after eating contaminated meat. In this paper we report septic <b>intestinal</b> <b>anthrax.</b> Case Presentation. We report an isolation of Bacillus anthracis from blood culture of patient with <b>intestinal</b> <b>anthrax.</b> Bacillus anthracis was isolated from a blood culture of a 34 -year-old man who {{had a history of}} severe abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, fever, sweating, and lethargy within 4 to 5 days after eating the meat of domestic goat. He had evidence of severe infection and septic shock and did not respond to treatments and subsequently expired 9 hours after hospitalization. Conclusion. Gastrointestinal anthrax is characterized by rapid onset, fever, and septicemia. Rapid diagnosis and prompt initiation of antibiotic therapy can help in survival. Most of previous cases of septicemic anthrax were related to injection drug users but, in our case, septicemia occurred after gastrointestinal anthrax...|$|E

We describe some of these cases, introduce {{the concept of the}} surgical management of advanced <b>intestinal</b> <b>anthrax,</b> and describe some of the approaches for treatment. Several reports and reviews have recently shed light on anthrax and its cutaneous and pulmonary manifestations, focusing on its threat as a biologic weapon. The third form of the disease, gastrointestinal anthrax, has not received as much attention, and the research describing its manifestations is scarce. We report on several cases of <b>intestinal</b> <b>anthrax</b> from 1960 to 1974 in the Bekaa Valley in Lebanon, where the consumption of raw or poorly cooked meat is customary. One of the authors (A. Ghossain) treated and operated on all the patients described here. We describe a series of gastrointestinal anthrax cases, the reporting of which has become paramount with the current renewed interest in this entity, the scarcity of information in the research on this particular form of anthrax, and the high fatality rate in advanced disease. The cases described in this report were chosen to illustrate the protean manifestations of gastrointestinal anthrax. Clinical Manifestations and Surgical Findings In March 1960, an acute and particularly severe abdominal syndrome was recognized in the Bekaa Valley in Lebanon. The first cases were described in male patients from 4 to 25 years of age with an illness that consisted of three phases. Phase I was marked by fainting spells, asthenia, low-grade fever, and headache. Patients rarely sought medical treatment at this stage because the symptoms were not serious enough. In the few patients seen at this stage...|$|E
5000|$|Studying the {{epidemiology}} of typhus and relapsing fever, {{he found}} that the carriers of these diseases where blood-sucking insects. His work, [...] "Plague in Russia" [...] (1898), written {{on the basis of the}} study of the epidemic in 1878-79 in the village of Vetlyanskaya (Vetluzhsky), was the work of his personal involvement therein; in this work, the characteristic of the clinic and the bubonic plague and pneumonic forms indicated the route of infection. He also found that both <b>intestinal</b> and pulmonary <b>anthrax</b> have a common origin. In 1873, he described the anthrax as bodies that migrate in cells, but was not able to properly assess the significance of this observation.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{events have}} {{demonstrated}} that bioterrorists {{have the ability to}} disseminate biologic agents in the United States and cause widespread social panic. Family physicians would {{play a key role in}} the initial recognition of a potential bioterrorism attack. Familiarity with the infectious agents of highest priority can expedite diagnosis and initial management, and lead to a successful public health response to such an attack. High-priority infectious agents include anthrax, smallpox, plague, tularemia, botulism, and viral hemorrhagic fever. Anthrax and smallpox must be distinguished from such common infections as influenza and varicella. Anthrax treatment is stratified into postexposure prophylaxis and treatment of confirmed cutaneous, <b>intestinal,</b> or inhalation <b>anthrax.</b> Disease prevention by vaccination and isolation of affected persons is key in preventing widespread smallpox infection. Many resources are available to physicians when a bioterrorism attack is suspected, including local public health agencies and the Centers for Diseas...|$|R
40|$|In my {{bachelor}} thesis, I concentrated {{primarily to}} issues inclusive to water management and terrorism. The main aim of my thesis is to analyze {{protection of water}} supply against possible terrorist attack with using of selective contaminants. The district of Žatec is defined by administrative area municipality with extended competence Žatec that includes 18 villages and their parts. Over 91 % from the 26 thousand inhabitants are supplied a potable water by public water supply from several surface and groundwater water sources. In this region has been built over 20 water tanks, more than 200 km water mains, several pump stations, water treatment plant and another equipment. Water supply network of the district Žatec is controlled by regional dispatch center, located in Most. In partial analyse of security system water supply, I focused on issue of the protection against external disruption by terrorists on selective objects or equipment. I visited some of them, specifically selected water tanks and dispatching by excursion with expert consultation. I founded that the most vulnerable components are water tanks which are not connected to dispatching. That´s means that dispatchers haven´t continuous information about monitored parameters of water tanks and that these water tanks are not secured by infrared sensor which points out a break-in. These water tanks aren´t connected to large distributional systems. They supply individual town or group of municipalities by local or group water mains. Their further disadvantage is small capacity too. Water tank at Třeskonice has two chamber each with capacity of 25 m 3. I defined suitable contaminant of water supply system by analysis potentially hazardous water contaminants. I compared required properties of suitable contaminant with available informations concerning to selective biological weapons and toxins. Although, at first I supposed that I will define by analysis more suitable contaminants than one, so I could determine only bacillus anthracis as potentially highly hazardous water contaminant due to limited access of available informations about agens. Spores of this bacterium which cause anthrax are e. g. resistant to chlorine, stable in water enviroment, relatively easy cultivation on selected culture medium. There is probably posibility to be infected by cutaneous and <b>intestinal</b> forms of <b>anthrax</b> through effective and sufficient contamination. In the final analysis, the potential {{of a terrorist attack}} on the water supply network of the district Žatec, I concentrated mainly on evaluation posibilities of ways performance terrorist attack {{from the point of view}} of efectivity and difficulty performance such terrorist attack and on evaluation of total and general potencial terrorist attack. The easiest and the most likely ways of performance terrorist attack is direct aplication of suitable contaminant into water tanks´s reservoir. Simultaneously the easiest and the most effective is contamination into selective water tanks that I specified in analysis security of water supply network. Nevertheless is undoubted that even ineffective contamination would mean really significant intervention towards activities of all relevant institutions and serious disruption of inhabitants´s daily life. Due to my achieved results is neccesary to raise level of protection water supply network for some parts of this system. It concerns primarily improvement security for individual water tanks. It is also desirable to determine security level of water tanks by legislative law. For verification of preparedness for such crisis situation is needed to perform a demonstration training with model situation for possible contamination of the water network by hazardous substances. Concurrently it is important to implement available and actual data from adequate foreing sources which are concerning to a research potentional water contaminants, especially biological and chemical weapons...|$|R
40|$|Cutaneous anthrax {{is usually}} easy to {{diagnose}} provided the doctor thinks of anthrax. The lesion {{most likely to}} be confused with anthrax is accidental vaccinia. Orf lacks the characteristic central eschar. Cutaneous anthrax responds to antibiotic therapy: rare complications are meningitis and hypoxic hypertension. Pulmonary anthrax is highly fatal: its incidence is related to the number and size of anthrax-containing particles which are inhaled. Artificial mists containing lethal doses of anthrax bacilli can be manufactured. <b>Intestinal</b> <b>anthrax</b> may present as gastroenteritis or as ulceration of the intestine with obstruction and perforation...|$|E
40|$|Anthrax {{has been}} {{described}} as a veterinary disease of minor importance to clinical medicine, causing occasional occupational infections in single cases or clusters. Its potential for rapid and widespread epidemic transmission under natural circumstances has not been widely appreciated. A little-known 1770 epidemic that killed 15, 000 people in Saint-Domingue (modern Haiti) was probably <b>intestinal</b> <b>anthrax.</b> The epidemic spread rapidly throughout the colony in association with consumption of uncooked beef. Largescale, highly fatal epidemics of anthrax may occur under unusual but natural circumstances. Historical information may not only provide important clues about epidemic development but may also raise awareness about bioterrorism potential. I n late 2001, anthrax bioterrorist attacks in the United States prompted considerable commentary on how little is generally appreciated about the transmissibility of Bacillus anthracis. Textbooks have long described anthrax as a veterinary disease of minor medical importance, attributing most human infections to occupational exposures, now less common i...|$|E
40|$|Anthrax {{which is}} caused by Bacillus anthracis is {{typically}} a disease of herbivores. Spores existing in the skin, meat, hair or mouth and nose of animals are transmitted to humans through contact with {{a break in the}} skin, consumption of infected meat or inhalation of spores [1]. Infected uncooked or insufficiently cooked meats cause oropharyngeal and gastrointestinal system (GIS) anthrax. When this infected materials swallowed anthrax spores may cause lesions from the oral cavity to the caecum. The diagnosis of gastrointestinal system (GIS) anthrax is difficult due to insidious clinical progression of the disease and difficulty in the isolation of agent pathogen. Releated symptoms of GIS anthrax are sore throat, neck swelling, diffuculty swallowing, stomach pain, anoreksia, bloody diarrhea, nause, bloody vomiting and fever. Supportive and antibiotic treatments are required. Benzylpenicillin, rifampicin, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, imipenem/cilastatin, or vancomycin can be use for treatment, ciprofloxacin or doxycycline may be added to this treat-ment for serious cases. To emphasize the necessity of taking precautions, an oropharyngeal and <b>intestinal</b> <b>anthrax</b> case due to consumption of infected and insufficiently cooked meat is presented below...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Anthrax is {{a disease}} of herbivores caused by the gram-positive {{bacterium}} Bacillus anthracis. It can affect cattle, sheep, swine, horses and various species of wildlife. The routes for the spread among wildlife are reviewed. There are three kinds of human anthrax – inhalation, cutaneous, and <b>intestinal</b> <b>anthrax</b> – which differ in their routes of infection and outcomes. In the United States, confirmation of cases is made by the isolation of B. anthracis and by biochemical tests. Vac-cination is not recommended for the general public; civilians who should be vaccinated include those who, in their work places, {{come in contact with}} products po-tentially contaminated with B. anthracis spores, and people engaged in research or diagnostic activities. After September 11, 2001, there were bioterrorism an-thrax attacks in the United States: anthrax-laced letters sent to multiple locations were the source of infectious B. anthracis. The US Postal Service issued recommen-dations to prevent the danger of hazardous exposure to the bacterium. B. anthracis spores can spread easily and persist for very long times, which makes decontamina-tion of buildings very difficult. Early detection, rapid diagnosis, and well-coordinated public health response are the key to minimizing casualties. The US Govern-ment is seeking new ways to deter bioterrorism, includ-ing a tighter control of research on infectious agents, even though pathogens such as B. anthracis are widely spread in nature and easy to grow. It is necessary to define the boundary between defensive and offensive biological weapons research. Deterring bioterrorism should not restrict critical scientific research...|$|E
40|$|Anthrax is a {{bacterial}} disease which primarily affects herbivorous animals, although all mammals {{are susceptible to}} infection. In humans, anthrax can affect the skin and, rarely, the respiratory or gastro-intestinal tract. It {{is caused by the}} aerobic bacillus, Bacillus anthracis, and is spread by spores. Spores can be found in animal products such as wool, hair, hides, skins, bones, bonemeal and in the carcasses of infected animals. The spores can also contaminate soil and may survive for many years. Anthrax The incubation period is usually 48 hours but can be up to seven days. In cutaneous anthrax, a lesion appears on the skin and develops into a characteristic ulcer with a black centre. Inhalational anthrax begins with a flu-like illness and is followed by respiratory compromise and shock around two to six days later. <b>Intestinal</b> <b>anthrax</b> results in severe abdominal pain, fever and bloody diarrhoea. Anthrax can be treated effectively with antibiotics if identified early. If untreated, the infection can cause septicaemia, toxaemia or meningitis, and is fatal in around 5 % of cases. In the UK, human anthrax is rare, and is almost entirely an occupational disease affecting those handling imported infected animal products or working with infected animals (see Table 13. 1). Prevention depends on controlling anthrax in livestock and on disinfecting, washing and scouring imported animal products. Processing of hides, wool and bone by tanning, dyeing, carbonising or acid treatment also reduces the risk of infection. Bonemeal used as horticultural fertiliser may rarely contain anthrax spores when not correctly treated in the country of origin; a certificate of sterilisation should accompany any consignment on entry to the UK. Those handling bonemeal in bulk should wear impervious gloves that should be destroyed after use...|$|E
40|$|Some {{important}} {{zoonotic diseases}} in Indonesia are Rabies, Plague, Anthrax, Taeniasis/Cysticercosis and Japanese encephalitis. These diseases are geographycally distributed in some provinces in Indonesia and each disease have its control program. Other zoonoses which are under intensive surveillance are Toxoplasmosis, Leptospirosis, Brucellosis, bovine Tuberculosis and Haemorrhagic Hanta virosis. These diseases have epidemic potential. Plague known foci are in Boyolali Central Java dan Sleman Yogyakarta. In 1987 after 30 years of dormant period an outbreack of plague occured in Pasuruan, East Java with 48 {{number of cases}} and 21 deaths. Intensive surveillance on human, rodent and fleas were conducted in three plague foci. Since 1988 no human case of plague is found in Indonesia eventhough antibody against Y. pestis were found positive in human {{as well as in}} rodents. Anthrax is distributed geographycally in Jakarta, West Java, Central Java, South Sulawesi, Southeast Sulawesi, West and East Nusa Tenggara and Timor Timur. Skin and <b>intestinal</b> <b>Anthrax</b> types {{are to be found in}} Indonesia. In 1990 on outbreak of anthrax occured in Central Java and 7 out of 98 cases were fatal. Of 154 (27. 9 %) out 553 human sera collected from the provinces of West Sumatera, West Kalimantan, South Sulawesi, North Sumatera and North Sulawesi were found positive against toxoplasmosis during the survey conducted in 1995. From the same provinces 152 (19. 2 %) out of 792 animal sera also were found antibody positive against Toxoplasma gondii. There are about 170 Leptospirosis serotypes known in Indonesia. Leptospirosis is geographycally distributed in Central Java, Yogyakarta, West Java, North Sumatera, Riau, Jambi, South Sumatera, Bengkulu, East Kalimantan. Sporadic outbreaks occured in some provinces related to the lack of washing and drinking water in the dry season. Of 10 (1. 8 %) out 154 serum specimens taken from humans in West Sumatera, West Kalimantan, South Sulawesi, North Sumatera and North Sulawesi in 1995 were found positive against Leptospirosis sp. while 29 (3. 7 %) out 792 animal sera from the some provinces also were found positive against Leptospirosis sp...|$|E
