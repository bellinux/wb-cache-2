It defines its application in such organizations and based on comparison it evaluates the practical use of the prudence principle and its reflection in the accounting books. The main focus is on differences in applying the prudence principle that result from differences in the purpose activities and methods of asset management in these organizations. The practical application of the prudence <b>principle</b> in <b>accounting</b> consists mainly in the creation and use of provisions and impairments. These methods are defined by the Implementing Regulation to the Accounting Act No. 563 / 1991. The paper also provides tables where the creation and use of impairments and provisions in the above-mentioned organizations is compared with how business companies proceed in creating impairments and provisions. The key legislation standardizing accounting in the Czech Republic is the Accounting Act No. 563 / 1991, as amended, which stipulates the <b>general</b> <b>accounting</b> <b>principles,</b> the so-called <b>accounting</b> philosophy.

40|$|For over a century, anti-trust law {{has been}} used to {{maintain}} an open and fair market economy by preventing monopolies. However, anti-trust law has never precisely defined the term “monopoly”, which makes evaluating the interactions between the prohibition of monopoly and encouraging competition increasingly challenging. In 2006, the Hong Kong Government appointed Arculli 2 ̆ 6 Associates Solicitor Firm to study issues relating to competition in the auto-fuel retail market in Hong Kong. A test based on contribution margins was recommended, leading to the conclusion that price fixing is not a crime in the industry. This article examines the problems related to Arculli 2 ̆ 6 Associates Solicitor Firm’s conclusion. First, price fixing is a per se violation (in or by itself) of the anti-trust law in the United States. Second, it is difficult for the courts to evaluate price fixing because the evidence of such activities between corporations is not easily available. Third, the test has applied non-standardized <b>accounting</b> <b>principles,</b> which clash with the accounting industry on numerous grounds. To combat these problems, this paper proposes a revised and objective “Contribution Margin” test to measure monopolies.

40|$|In 2005 a new {{recommendation}} was implemented, IAS 36 "Impairment of intangible assets". The Swedish {{translation of}} the recommendation is RR 17. The previous treatment of impairment of goodwill was to amortize it over {{a certain amount of}} years. In order for a company to make impairment, they had to estimate the decrease in value of goodwill to be permanent. The new recommendation RR 17 on the other hand states that goodwill should be impaired as soon as an indication of impairment loss is revealed. This implies that the new recommendation shows the fair value of goodwill. Our problem description is; how does the impairment procedure of goodwill in companies applying RR 17 look like? In order to reach the purpose of this study, which is to understand the impairment procedure of goodwill, we used four sub questions; (1) How does goodwill arise? (2) How is goodwill divided between cash generating units? (3) How do stock listed business combinations in accordance with RR 17 estimate whether an impairment loss of goodwill exist or not, in cases where goodwill exist, how is it impaired? (4) How is goodwill revalued and how often? The study has mainly taken a hermeneutic approach because we strive to understand the impairment procedure of goodwill. We conducted a qualitative study, with semi- structured interviews. Four companies, which operate in somewhat different branches, were chosen {{in order to get a}} diversified illustration of different business areas and see if there were any differences between them. Our central concepts present <b>general</b> <b>accounting</b> <b>principles</b> as well as <b>accounting</b> <b>principles</b> handling impairment of goodwill, which helps the reader to receive a better understanding of the essential concepts concerning the impairment procedure of goodwill. In the analysis we connect our empirical findings with the central concepts in order to discover more dimensions of the impairment procedure of goodwill. The result from our interviews showed that the companies follow the recommendation RR 17. However we could identify some differences between the companies, which we believe are due to the fact that the companies operate in different business areas and are therefore faced with somewhat diverse risks. Further we could link the differences to be correlated to the mindsets and demands of the companies’ auditors. Finally we want to make the reader aware of the fact that the recommendation RR 17 has so far only been applied in an economic boom and therefore when we conducted this study the need to impair goodwill was very small. ...|$|R

This paper shows that Japanese banks are highly capitalized in terms of market value; much of their capital is"hidden capital,"the divergence between accounting and stock market estimates. The authors developed a method for testing hypotheses about two types of hidden capital: the misvaluation of on-balance-sheet items and intangible values that the <b>General</b> Accepted <b>Accounting</b> <b>Principles</b> (GAPP) currently designates to be unbookable off-balance-sheet items. They construct a model that explains changes in both types of capital functions of holding-period returns earned in Japan on stocks, bonds, yen, and real estate. They apply the model to annual data for 1975 - 89 and a four-class size/charter participation of the Japanese banking system. For each type of hidden capital and each class of bank, the model develops estimates of the stock market, interest rate, foreign exchange, and real estate sensitivities of returns to bank stockholders. Only the stock market sensitivities prove significant, at 5 percent.
