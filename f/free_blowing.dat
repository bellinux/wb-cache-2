5000|$|David Dupont of Allmusic wrote [...] "This session ... {{represents}} a free bop supergroup. Those names promise much, and the recording delivers that and more. This conjoining of talents {{results in an}} adventurous, free-swinging session informed by {{a keen sense of}} structure. The group's ability to match expansive <b>free</b> <b>blowing</b> with intriguing song forms is most pronounced on the ensemble's version of Stanley Cowell's joyful waltz, [...] "Effie." [...] The special rapport among the members of the core trio lifts the music, and {{at the heart of the}} trio is bassist Reggie Workman. The aptly named Workman moves up any session he's on a couple notches, and he's at his best here laying down a foundation of expansive, elastic lines and contributing powerful solos. On the opener he instigates pianist Mulgrew Miller's journey from bebop into the free beyond. The much-underrated Frederick Waits is at once colorful and earthbound. He also contributes two pieces, including a tribute to fellow drummer Ed Blackwell that features metric trickery and interlocking piano and saxophone lines. Guest Oliver Lake feasts on the support he receives, delivering a number of hearty orations".|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{injection}} stretch/blow {{molding process}} of PET bottles {{is a complex}} process, in which {{the performance of the}} bottles depends on various processing parameters. Experimental work has been conducted on a properly instrumented stretch/blow molding machine in order to characterize these processing parameters. The objective being {{a better understanding of the}} pressure evolution, preform free inflation has been processed and compared with a simple thermodynamic model. In addition, a numerical model for the thermomechanical simulation of the stretch/blow molding process has been developed. At each time step, mechanical and temperature balance equations are solved separately on the current deformed configuration. Then, the geometry is updated. The dynamic equilibrium and the Oldroyd B constitutive equations are solved separately using an iterative procedure based on a fixed-point method. The heat transfer equation is discretized using the Galerkin method and approximated by a Crank-Nicholson's scheme over the time increment. Successful <b>free</b> <b>blowing</b> simulations as well as stretch/blow molding simulations have been performed and compared with experiments...|$|E

5000|$|Whether mold <b>blown</b> or <b>free</b> <b>blown</b> (both {{forms of}} mouth-blowing and {{considered}} hand made), most bottles produced before 1860-65 have a distinct scar on their base.

40|$|International audienceStrain induced {{crystallisation}} of PET {{designed for}} stretch blow molding is studied combining well-controlled tensile tests and <b>free</b> <b>blowing</b> on a stretch blow prototype. Microstructure evolution {{is followed by}} WAXS and SAXS. Observations on blown parts clearly show that the microstructure can differ along the bottle and from processing conditions to another. Difference can be observed on crystalline orientation, periodic arrangement {{at the level of}} lamellae and long period. Range of long period, 8. 5 to 13 nm is in agreement with literature. In certain case lamellar organisation disappears. Despite of high level of strain and evidence for strain hardening to occur during blowing no perfect crystalline pattern is observed, except in very thick zones. Interrupted tensile tests followed by quenching demonstrates that strain hardening is not correlated to prefect crystallisation. Microstructure clearly depends on the three parameters: temperature, strain rate and strain. It is concluded that strain hardening is mainly controlled by first stages of crystallisation and that actual crystallisation occurs during a following relaxation step. This later is then highly dependent upon cooling step...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe great {{influence}} of temperature on polymer's behavior {{is well known}} and, for example, a 10 °C increase {{can lead to a}} 10 time reduction of the viscosity. The necessity {{to take into account the}} self heating phenomena appears then to be crucial for thermoforming process simulation and in particular for ISBM of PET. An original anisotropic visco-hyperelastic model coupled with temperature has been developed [1, 2], identified from equibiaxial and constant width tension tests [3] and can be used to evaluate this self-heating phenomenon. In order to provide validation of the model and its capacity to predict accurately final bubble shape, self-heating value and induced mechanical properties, <b>free</b> <b>blowing</b> of a preform has been carried out with temperature measured using a thermal camera. Results are discussed and compared with numerical simulation prediction. At room temperature, tension specimens have been cut from the different blown bubbles and induced modulus where measured in three directions: longitudinal and hoop directions and also 45 ° from both previous ones and an elastic orthotropic behavior is identified. The effect of the self heating on the free blown shapes and induced modulus is discussed...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} the paper is to study the {{influence}} of molecular architecture of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) {{on its ability to}} be processed by stretch-blow molding, which is not well documented in the literature. To evaluate this process ability, it proposes an original strategy combining laboratory analyses and experiments on a prototype machine. PET copolymers were prepared from three types of comonomers: diethylene glycol (DEG), isophthalic acid (IPA) and trimethylolpropane (TMP). It is first shown, through laboratory experiments, that the nature of the polymer in terms of chain constitution (copolymerization), chain length (intrinsic viscosity) and purity (catalytic residues) greatly affects many properties: melt crystallization, thermal properties, polymer rigidity and drawability. These different properties obviously induce very different behaviours at the different steps of the stretch-blow molding process: injection-molding of the preform (quenchability), heating (IR absorption), stretch-blow (rigidity and drawability). The stretch-blow step has been simulated on a prototype apparatus designed in our laboratory. It has been shown that <b>free</b> <b>blowing</b> can be used to characterize the process ability of the polymer. A statistical analysis has confirmed the great differences between the materials investigated and pointed out the complexity of the material response during blowing...|$|E

In this work, the blowing air to inflate the PET preform was modeled through two different approaches: a direct pressure input (as measured in the blowing machine) and a constant mass flow rate input (based on a pressure-volume-time relationship). The results from these two approaches were validated against <b>free</b> <b>blow</b> and <b>free</b> stretch-blow experiments, which were instrumented and monitored through highspeed video.

40|$|This thesis {{has been}} {{performed}} at Mondi kraft {{pulp and paper}} mill located in Sweden, Kramfors Dynäs due to the low return rate of condensate. Currently, the return rate is only at 65 - 75 %. This is problematic as the demineralization process is operating on full capacity and thus requires a reduced make-up water need. The production of demineralized water is an expensive process due to large requirements of chemicals and pump-energy, but also due {{to the cost of}} raw water and maintenance. Therefore the purpose of the work was to investigate the possibility to increase the condensate return rate and thus reduce the need of make-up water. The investigation was performed during normal production rates to simplify the interpretations. The steam and condensate system was mapped and extracted flows were identified, measured and marked on map. The extracted flows were investigated in more detail and characterized as either consumed in a process or lost to sewer or atmosphere. In the work, both minor and major improvements were investigated. Minor improvements are accomplished with small intervention measures and could be done with small or no investments costs. Major improvements require large investments costs and further investigations. Six different processes were found to constitute the total production of make-up water. These are the <b>free</b> <b>blowing</b> of excess steam, soot blowing steam, paper machine 6, de-aerating process in the feed water tanks, digester process and steam- & condensate leaks along the pipe network. Improvements with the category of minor were found to reduce steam and condensate consumption by 22 - 23 ton/h. This implies a reduction by 30 - 32 % of the added make-up water, including an annual financial benefit of 3, 3 - 3, 9 MSEK. Additionally 0, 41 - 0, 82 MSEK could be gained annually by improving the insulation on the cylinder dryer heads. The make-up water would be further reduced if insulation jackets and inspection programs were implemented on equipments along the steam lines. Two major improvements are recommended. The first major improvement involves elimination of the <b>free</b> <b>blowing</b> of excess steam. This could be accomplished by drying the bark before combustion. The added make-up water would be reduced by 25 % and with the possibility to sell the dried bark during low steam production. The second major improvement involves the digester process, where the consumptions of medium pressure steam could be reduced by replacing steam with liquor-steam from the strong liquor accumulator. Medium pressure steam could instead be converted into electricity by the turbine...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{presentation}} {{deals with}} the non linear strongly elastic and viscous behaviour of poly ethylene terephthalate near the glass transition temperature and biaxially stretched at high strain rates representative of the injection stretch blow moulding process. A non linear visco-hyperelastic model inspired from [1] and identified from the experimental results of the equi-biaxial tension test [2], have been developed and presented in [3] is implemented into a finite element code developed with Matlab. The thermal behaviour modelling, identification and simulation has also been managed. First, a numerical simulation of 2 D plane stress case has been performed involving 2 fields (global velocity V and elastic Cauchy Green tensor Be). Rectangular finite elements with quadratic and linear interpolations have been employed for velocity and the elastic left Cauchy Green tensor. Second, an axi symmetric formulation involving 4 fields (global velocity V, lagrange multiplier p associated with the global incompressibility condition, and multiplier q associated with the incompressibility of the elastic part) has been performed using rectangular elements. Degree of interpolation have been tested for all possible combinations to test the LBB like condition. Both simulations are compared with equi biaxial or sequential biaxial testing in order to reproduce the strain hardening effect and the self-heating observed. The final goal of this work is to perform the <b>free</b> <b>blowing</b> simulation to compare with experimental data. Therefore, we should solve an iterative procedure for a thermo-mechanical equation. At each time step, a four-field approach is adopted for the mechanical part, and a classical heat transfer equation is discretised for the thermal part...|$|E
