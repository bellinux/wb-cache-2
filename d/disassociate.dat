Additionally, Georgetown University students are affiliated, in some cases, with fraternities at other nearby universities and colleges.|$|E
5|$|Back in Europe, Bernard of Clairvaux was humiliated by the defeat. Bernard {{considered}} it {{his duty to}} send an apology to the Pope and it is inserted {{in the second part}} of his Book of Consideration. There he explains how the sins of the crusaders were the cause of their misfortune and failures. When his attempt to call a new crusade failed, he tried to <b>disassociate</b> himself from the fiasco of the Second Crusade altogether. He would die in 1153.|$|E
5|$|During this time, Conrad {{wished to}} leave the series to pursue other career opportunities, though she filmed ten episodes in the {{following}} season to close her storylines. After departing halfway through the fifth season, she was replaced by Cavallari, a fellow former Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County cast member. The sixth and final season saw Conrad's friends Lo Bosworth and Stephanie Pratt, who were respectively featured as supporting roles since {{the second and third}} seasons, become primary cast members. Halfway through the season, Montag left the series after the cast looked to <b>disassociate</b> themselves from her uncharacteristic antics.|$|E

5|$|Each of the Christian forces {{felt betrayed}} by the other. A new plan was made to attack Ascalon but this was {{abandoned}} {{due to the lack}} of trust that had resulted from the failed siege. This mutual distrust would linger for a generation due to the defeat, to the ruin of the Christian kingdoms in the Holy Land. Following the battle, Conrad returned to Constantinople to further his alliance with Manuel. As a result of the attack, Damascus no longer trusted the crusaders, and the city was formally handed over to Nur ad-Din in 1154. Bernard of Clairvaux was also humiliated, and when his attempt to call a new crusade failed, he tried to <b>disassociate</b> himself from the fiasco of the Second Crusade altogether.|$|E
5|$|Saddam Hussein {{claimed that}} Aflaq had {{converted}} to Islam {{prior to his}} death – according to nameless Western diplomats. This claim was later disputed by nameless members of Aflaq's own family - although Aflaq's son Iyad confirmed that his father thought about conversion already in 1980. Upon his disputed conversion {{he had taken the}} first name of Ahmad. According to the German orientalists Martin Robbe and Gerhard Höpp the conversion happened before 1988. Even so, Aflaq was given an Islamic funeral. For the Berkley Center, Aflaq's disputed conversion is considered by anonymous members of his family as a tool used by Saddam Hussein to <b>disassociate</b> Ba'athism from Christianity. The tomb constructed on the orders of Hussein was later used by American soldiers after the 2003 American invasion of Iraq as a military barracks for troops stationed within the Green Zone.|$|E
5|$|She {{was renamed}} Lazar Kaganovich in 1945 to <b>disassociate</b> her from Lazar's disgraced brother Mikhail Kaganovich. She {{remained}} inactive during the Soviet invasion of Manchuria in 1945. She spent the post-war period on routine training missions. She was renamed Petropavlovsk on 3 August 1957 after Lazar Kaganovich was purged {{from the government}} after an unsuccessful coup against Nikita Khrushchev that same year. Her superstructure was badly damaged by a Force 12 typhoon on 19 September 1957. Sources disagree on her fate; one says that she was converted into a floating barracks on 6 February 1960 and later sold for scrap while another says that she was simply sold for scrap on 6 February 1960.|$|E

5|$|After the {{completion}} of the H-41 design, Hitler issued a request for a larger battleship and placed no restrictions on gun caliber or displacement. The only requirements were a speed of , horizontal and underwater protection sufficiently strong enough to protect the vessel from all attacks, and a main battery properly balanced with the size of the ship. The results were purely study projects intended to determine the size of a ship with strong enough armor to counter the rapidly increasing power of bombs deployed by the Allies during the war. The Commission did not discuss its activities with Raeder or his successor, Admiral Karl Dönitz, or with other branches in the OKM. As the designs for the H-42, H-43, and H-44 battleships were purely conjectural, no actual work was begun. The German navy did not seriously consider construction on any of the designs, which were so large that they could not have been built in a traditional slipway. Indeed, the Construction Office of the OKM sought to <b>disassociate</b> itself from the projects, which they found to be of doubtful merit and unnecessary for German victory.|$|E

25|$|Techniques {{using this}} are most {{effective}} for light atoms such as hydrogen. Lighter isotopes tend to react or evaporate more quickly than heavy isotopes, allowing them to be separated.

This process in a large cascade was used at the heavy water production plant at Rjukan.|$|E
