50|$|The {{distinction}} between false brinelling and <b>fretting</b> <b>corrosion</b> {{has been extensively}} discussed in the literature.

30|$|Conversely, {{some studies}} have {{described}} how large-diameter femoral heads {{may not have a}} significant effect on damage at the trunnion–taper junction. In a retrospective study examining 110 large-diameter (> 36  mm) THAs, Matthies et al. [12] demonstrated that the volume of material loss was negligible (< 1  mm 3) in the trunnions of all 36 femoral stems that were received. In fact, the median volume loss (0.29  mm 3) was significantly less than that of the female taper, the femoral head, and acetabular-bearing surfaces (P <  0.001 for all). However, for the trunnions in this study, it should be noted that a significant positive correlation was observed between corrosion score and volume of material loss (ρ =  0.72, 95  % CI =  0.44 – 0.87, P <  0.001). Triantafyllopoulos et al. [13] conducted a retrieval analysis of 154 THAs. Ultimately, they found no association between femoral head size and the degree of <b>fretting</b> and <b>corrosion</b> on tapers (P =  0.247; P =  0.837, respectively) or trunnions (P =  0.471; P =  0.868, respectively). While this type of damage may be a regular occurrence in THAs, neither <b>fretting</b> nor <b>corrosion</b> was associated with femoral head size.|$|R
40|$|Corrosion has a vast {{impact on}} the global and {{domestic}} economy, and currently incurs losses of nearly $ 300 billion annually to the U. S. economy alone. Because of the huge impact of corrosion, {{it is imperative to}} have a systematic approach to recognizing and mitigating corrosion problems as soon as possible after they become apparent. A proper failure analysis includes collection of pertinent background data and service history, followed by visual inspection, photographic documentation, material evaluation, data review and conclusion procurement. In analyzing corrosion failures, one must recognize the wide range of common corrosion mechanisms. The features of any corrosion failure give strong clues as to the most likely cause of the corrosion. This article details a proven approach to properly determining the root cause of a failure, and includes pictographic illustrations of the most common corrosion mechanisms, including general corrosion, pitting, galvanic corrosion, dealloying, crevice corrosion, microbiologically-influenced corrosion (MIC), corrosion fatigue, stress corrosion cracking (SCC), intergranular <b>corrosion,</b> <b>fretting,</b> erosion <b>corrosion</b> and hydrogen damage...|$|R
30|$|The {{effect of}} taper design on trunnionosis has been {{extensively}} evaluated. A comprehensive study looked at all hip prosthesis with a 28 -mm plus zero length head over fourteen years with MoP implants giving a total of forty-four sets of retrieved implants, with six different taper designs. The Goldberg scale was used to score <b>fretting</b> and <b>corrosion.</b> This study showed no difference in patient age, body mass index, or length of implantation {{with regard to the}} trunnionosis. However, Taper design had a significant effect on corrosion {{at the base of the}} trunnion [36].|$|R
50|$|Fretting {{decreases}} {{fatigue strength}} of materials operating under cycling stress. This can result in fretting fatigue, whereby fatigue cracks can initiate in the fretting zone. Afterwards, the crack propagates into the material. Lap joints, common on airframe surfaces, are a prime location for <b>fretting</b> <b>corrosion.</b> This {{is also known as}} frettage or <b>fretting</b> <b>corrosion.</b>|$|E

40|$|Modularity {{in total}} hip {{arthroplasty}} provides multiple benefits to the surgeon in restoring the appropriate alignment and position to a previously damaged hip joint. The vast majority of modern implants incorporate modularity into their design with some implants having multiple modular interfaces.

This case report details the failure of an Emperion (Smith and Nephew, Memphis, TN) femoral stem in a 67 -year-old male patient 6 years after total hip replacement. Analysis of the implant revealed mechanically assisted crevice corrosion that likely accelerated fatigue crack initiation in the hip stem.

However, to be effective, the compressive residual stresses must be retained in service for successful integration into aircraft structural design, and the process must be affordable and compatible with the manufacturing environment. LPB provides high magnitude deep thermally and mechanically stable compression, and is performed on CNC machine tools. LPB provides a means to extend the lives of both new and legacy aircraft structural components. Improving fatigue performance by introducing deep stable layers of compressive residual stress avoids the generally prohibitive cost of modifying either material or design.

5000|$|The {{load and}} {{operating}} situation of pitch bearings are for rolling element bearings comparatively unfavorable.

40|$|This study {{examines}} how taper design affects <b>corrosion</b> and <b>fretting</b> {{at the head}} trunnion surface. All hip prostheses retrieved between 1999 and 2013 with 28 mm/+ 0 heads were selected, resulting in 44 cobalt-chrome-on-polyethylene implants, representing six taper designs.

50|$|Fretting wear is the {{repeated}} cyclical rubbing between two surfaces. Over {{a period of}} time fretting which will remove material from one or both surfaces in contact. It occurs typically in bearings, although most bearings have their surfaces hardened to resist the problem. Another problem occurs when cracks in either surface are created, known as fretting fatigue. It is the more serious of the two phenomena because it can lead to catastrophic failure of the bearing. An associated problem occurs when the small particles removed by wear are oxidised in air. The oxides are usually harder than the underlying metal, so wear accelerates as the harder particles abrade the metal surfaces further. <b>Fretting</b> <b>corrosion</b> acts in the same way, especially when water is present. Unprotected bearings on large structures like bridges can suffer serious degradation in behaviour, especially when salt is used the during winter to deice the highways carried by the bridges. The problem of <b>fretting</b> <b>corrosion</b> was involved in the Silver Bridge tragedy and the Mianus River Bridge accident.|$|E
50|$|Wear is a {{mechanical}} material degradation process occurring on rubbing or impacting surfaces, while corrosion involves chemical or electrochemical {{reactions of the}} material. Corrosion may accelerate wear and wear may accelerate corrosion. One then speaks of corrosion accelerated wear or wear accelerated corrosion. Both these phenomena, as well as <b>fretting</b> <b>corrosion</b> (which results from small amplitude oscillations between contacting surfaces) fall into the broader category of tribocorrosion. Erosion-corrosion is another tribocorrosion phenomenon involving mechanical and chemical effects: impacting particles or fluids erode a solid surface by abrasion, chipping or fatigue while simultaneously the surface corrodes.|$|E

30|$|Trunnion diameters {{have also}} been {{trending}} towards slimmer measurements {{in an effort to}} avoid impingement, i.e., from the older 14 -mm/ 16 -mm diameter to the more widely used 12 -mm/ 14 -mm diameter. It is thought that a decreased trunnion diameter translates to a reduced surface area for contact length and fitting, and therefore, increases the possibility for these complications [9, 17]. Contrary to this, a retrospective retrieval study by Nassif et al. [18] examined a small group of failed implants and revealed that thicker tapers with longer contact lengths were associated with greater fretting scores. Trunnions with 11 -mm/ 13 -mm tapers demonstrated significantly higher fretting scores compared to the narrower type one tapers (P =  0.005). This study also included 12 -mm/ 14 -mm tapers, but showed no significant association with <b>fretting</b> or <b>corrosion</b> scores. This particular investigation is limited because it examined a small group of failed implants from a heterogeneous cohort with respect to taper–trunnion geometry, alloy composition, implant manufacturer, and reason for revision.|$|R
40|$|Tribocorrosion in taper {{junctions}} of retrieved anatomic shoulder arthroplasty implants was evaluated. A {{comparison of}} the tribocorrosion between cobalt-chromium and titanium alloy stems was conducted and the observations were correlated with the individual’s clinical data.

In total shoulder arthroplasty, to date {{only a small number}} of retrieval analyses are available and even fewer address the issue of tribocorrosion at the taper junctions. A total of 36 retrieved hemiarthroplasties and total shoulder arthroplasties were assessed using the modified Goldberg score. The prevalence of <b>fretting</b> and <b>corrosion</b> was confirmed in this cohort. Titanium stems seem to be more susceptible to damage caused by tribocorrosion than cobalt-chromium stems. Furthermore, stemless designs offered less tribocorrosion at the taper junction than stemmed designs. A weak correlation between time to revision and increased levels of tribocorrosion was seen.

50|$|There are {{number of}} {{instances}} where {{this picture of}} a critical crack is modified by corrosion. Thus, <b>fretting</b> <b>corrosion</b> occurs when a corrosive medium is present at the interface between two rubbing surfaces. Fretting (in the absence of corrosion) results from the disruption of very small areas that bond and break as the surfaces undergo friction, often under vibrating conditions. The bonding contact areas deform under the localised pressure and the two surfaces gradually wear away. Fracture mechanics dictates that each minute localised fracture has to satisfy the general rule that the elastic energy released as the bond fractures has to exceed the work done in plastically deforming it and in creating the (very tiny) fracture surfaces. This process is enhanced when corrosion is present, not least because the corrosion products act as an abrasive between the rubbing surfaces.|$|E

This paper focuses on the main phenomena causing actual or potential fuel failure during in-core operation to identify the remedial actions taken and the significant lessons learned. The use of higher enrichment and higher burnup fuel, mixed cores with assemblies of different designs, more challenging core power management, and shorter outages has derived in the need to carefully consider the performance and safety of the fuel materials and designs under these conditions. A great effort has been put to improve the design and manufacture of the fuel assemblies, which has allowed for a better performance and higher operational margins, {{in spite of the}} more demanding operational conditions. The result of these counteracting trends is that fuel performance has improved significantly over the years, but there are still some concerns which need to be addressed, like debris and grid to rod <b>fretting,</b> overpower, and <b>corrosion.</b> The most recurrent causes of fuel related events were design deficiencies and human errors but the improved designs and operational strategies widely spread also as operational experience feedback have demonstrated to be very effective in reducing the frequency of in-core fuel related events.

Operational and surveillance practices, like Foreign Material Exclusion, coolant chemistry control, and actions to enhance human performance need to be further enhanced.
