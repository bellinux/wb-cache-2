5000|$|As the {{situation}} is modeled in finer detail, using the general principle of relativity, {{the concept of a}} frame-dependent gravitational field becomes less realistic. In these Machian models, the accelerated body can agree that the apparent gravitational field is associated with the motion of the background matter, but can also claim that the motion of the material as if there is a gravitational field, causes the gravitational field - the accelerating background matter [...] "drags light". Similarly, a background observer can argue that the forced acceleration of the mass causes an apparent gravitational field in the region between it and the <b>environmental</b> <b>material</b> (the accelerated mass also [...] "drags light").This [...] "mutual" [...] effect, and the ability of an accelerated mass to warp lightbeam geometry and lightbeam-based coordinate systems, is referred to as frame-dragging.|$|E
5000|$|The 1980s saw {{a change}} in Finland. From first being a subject that was limited to {{environmentally}} conscious groups and individuals interested in nature conservation, the earth’s ecological state started to capture {{the interest of the}} general public. Art teaching gravitated to assisting learners in acquiring skills in reading and evaluating the language of the man-made environment. Parallel to that, in teacher education, issues stemming from environmental psychology and environmental aesthetics were discussed. Towards the end of the decade, new trends emerged. Art educators began to develop activities that were strongly influenced by down-to-earth phenomena inenvironmental art and the new ecological awareness. A key figure in this development of a new approach to environmental education in the 1980s, as Pirkko Pohjakallio notes, was Meri-Helga Mantere. To the latter, an artistically oriented environmental education would be at its best when the artistic and creative perspective would run through the teaching project, from the stage of its planning to the evaluation of its results. Effectively, what this implied was that in the entire environmental education process the emphasis would be on the manner of observing, experiencing and thinking that is customary to art. Whereas before, art students, on basis of the prevailing orientation at the time of linguistic methods and critical theory, typically used collage of media images rather than personal and intimate contact with the actual environment, this now all began to change. To be sure, students were taken outdoors before by art educators as well, taking their pencils, drawing pads and brushes along. Here’s the contrast, in Mantere’s own words: [...] "Now the purpose is to search for a more direct connection with the materiality as well as spirituality of nature. Sand, water, or any other <b>environmental</b> <b>material</b> became tools for reflection and expression. Also allusions to the mythical meanings of nature could be a starting point in the art exercises given to students." ...|$|E
