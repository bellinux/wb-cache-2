25|$|In the Changing World Technologies (CWT) process, the {{feedstock}} {{material is}} first ground into small chunks, and mixed with water {{if it is}} especially dry. It is then fed into a pressure vessel reaction chamber where it is heated at constant volume to around 250 °C. Similar to a pressure cooker (except at much higher pressure), steam naturally raises the pressure to 600 psi (4 MPa) (near the point of saturated water). These conditions are held for approximately 15 minutes to fully heat the mixture, after which the pressure is rapidly released to boil off most of the water (see: <b>Flash</b> <b>evaporation).</b> The result {{is a mix of}} crude hydrocarbons and solid minerals. The minerals are removed, and the hydrocarbons are sent to a second-stage reactor where they are heated to 500°C, further breaking down the longer hydrocarbon chains. The hydrocarbons are then sorted by fractional distillation, in a process similar to conventional oil refining.|$|E
25|$|In the U.S., OSHA lists vinyl {{chloride}} as a Class IA Flammable Liquid, with a National Fire Protection Association Flammability Rating of 4. Because of its low boiling point, liquid VCM will undergo <b>flash</b> <b>evaporation</b> (i.e., autorefrigerate) upon its release to atmospheric pressure. The portion vaporized will form a dense cloud (more {{than twice as}} heavy as the surrounding air). The risk of subsequent explosion or fire is significant. According to OSHA, the flash point of {{vinyl chloride}} is −78°C (−108.4°F). Its flammable limits in air are: lower 3.6 volume% and upper 33.0 volume%. The explosive limits are: lower 4.0%, upper 22.05 by volume in air. Fire may release toxic hydrogen chloride (HCl) and carbon monoxide (CO). VCM can polymerise rapidly due to heating and {{under the influence of}} air, light and contact with a catalyst, strong oxidisers and metals such as copper and aluminium, with fire or explosion hazard. As a gas mixed with air, VCM is a fire and explosion hazard. On standing VCM can form peroxides, which may then explode. VCM will react with iron and steel in the presence of moisture. Vinyl chloride is a gas at normal atmospheric temperature and pressure.|$|E

2500|$|The vapor-compression {{cycle is}} used in most {{household}} refrigerators {{as well as in}} many large commercial and industrial refrigeration systems. Figure 1 provides a schematic diagram of the components of a typical vapor-compression refrigeration system. [...] The thermodynamics of the cycle can be analyzed on a diagram as shown in Figure 2. In this cycle, a circulating refrigerant such as Freon enters the compressor as a vapor. From point 1 to point 2, the vapor is compressed at constant entropy and exits the compressor as a vapor at a higher temperature, but still below the vapor pressure at that temperature. From point 2 to point 3 and on to point 4, the vapor travels through the condenser which cools the vapor until it starts condensing, and then condenses the vapor into a liquid by removing additional heat at constant pressure and temperature. Between points 4 and 5, the liquid refrigerant goes through the expansion valve (also called a throttle valve) where its pressure abruptly decreases, causing <b>flash</b> <b>evaporation</b> and auto-refrigeration of, typically, {{less than half of the}} liquid. [...] That results in a mixture of liquid and vapor at a lower temperature and pressure as shown at point 5. The cold liquid-vapor mixture then travels through the evaporator coil or tubes and is completely vaporized by cooling the warm air (from the space being refrigerated) being blown by a fan across the evaporator coil or tubes. The resulting refrigerant vapor returns to the compressor inlet at point 1 to complete the thermodynamic cycle.|$|E

40|$|A {{mechanical}} vapor re-compression (MVR) evaporation {{system for}} the treatment of the highly-concentrated inorganic salt wastewater was investigated, and its process characteristics were analyzed taking sodium chloride salt wastewater as the treated solution. In this paper, by adding “H 2 O 2 oxidation + filter +flash evaporation + hot filter” technology on the basis of original traditional MVR treatment system, the optimum technological conditions were determined through the experiment: The pH value is 8. 5; the oxidation time is 24. 0 h; H 2 O 2 amount accounting for 1 % of the total wastewater under the condition of outlet test MVR system respectively fell 88. 5 % and 90. 1 % than the traditional process of effluent COD and NH 3 -N removal rate.

Compared with the new process MVR system, the operation load of MVR system was lower. Therefore, the system can be used to treat the highly-concentrated inorganic salt wastewater and save energy.

The rest of the desalinated water is almost entirely from thermal distillation, such as multistage <b>flash</b> (MSF) <b>evaporation</b> and multi-effect desalination (MED) techniques. The RO permeate is more corrosive than water produced by thermal distillation due to its high dissolved salts (TDS) level, particularly chlorides.

40|$|International audienceDispersed {{liquid droplet}} flows with {{evaporation}} and condensation in multi-component gas mixture made of vapor and other gas phase chemical {{species such as}} air occur in many engineering applications dealing with two-phase flows. However, existing models are essentially derived for vaporization occurring in sprays combustion. It means that the energy is transferred from a hot gas to the liquid to produce its phase change. This is thus a non-symmetric approach as in some situations the energy is already stored in the liquid phase and flashing occurs {{as a consequence of}} pressure drop. In the present paper a droplet mass transfer model is derived and is valid in any situation: <b>evaporation,</b> <b>flashing</b> and condensation. It accounts for:- coupled heat and mass diffusion in the gas phase,- thermodynamics of the multi-component gas mixture,- heat diffusion inside the liquid droplet, enabling consideration of both droplet heating and cooling. These effects are important in evaporating and flashing situations respectively. The resulting model consists in an algebraic non-linear system of three equations giving the interface temperature, the mass flow rate and vapor species concentration at the interface. These interfacial variables enable computation of the mass species, momentum and energy transfer rates appearing in volume averaged two-phase flow models. Computational examples are shown with this mass transfer model embedded in a compressible two-phase flow model of Baer and Nunziato (1986) type...|$|R

[...] In the 1970s the seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) process was developed which made potable water from seawater by forcing it under high pressure through a tight membrane thus filtering out salts and impurities. These salts and impurities are discharged from the SWRO device as a concentrated brine solution in a continuous stream, which contains a large amount of high-pressure energy. Most of this energy can be recovered with a suitable device.

Images of the spray were captured at a rate of 7500 fps utilizing a high speed camera, with a CMOS sensor, in conjunction with a schlieren optical system. The images were then analyzed to determine quantitative aspects of the spray such as spray penetration, cone angle and mean spray velocity and qualitative aspects like <b>evaporation</b> and <b>flash</b> boiling. The fuel line pressure was also recorded and analysed to determine the effect that injection had on the pressure in the line. For the same injection conditions it was found that the penetration of diesel was greater than that of DME and the cone angle of diesel was greater than that of DME except at atmospheric back pressure. The pressure oscillation in the DME fuel line was smaller in amplitude and longer in duration than that of diesel. The DME spray exhibited signs of <b>flash</b> boiling and <b>evaporation</b> when injected into an environment at atmospheric pressure and room temperature.
