Morgenthau said, [...] "We wanted a grittier, boots-on-the-ground feeling, inspired by what Alan and I had done on Game of Thrones. We wanted the realms to feel grounded, like a real place, {{while at the same time}} respecting the magical 'planet of the Gods' feeling and theme." [...] Thor: The Dark World was Morgenthau's first time shooting a feature film digitally. For the film, Morgenthau chose the Arri Alexa Plus, although he tested with the Sony F65 but found the Alexa to be more pleasing. In addition to the Alexa, Red Epic and Canon EOS 5D Mark II cameras were used for second unit filming. With the Alexa, Morgenthau used Panavision anamorphic lenses. Morgenthau said, [...] "The lenses brought some of the magic and mystery of photochemical back to digital, that big-movie look." [...] Morgenthau also stated that Thor: The Dark World was easily the most technically complex project that he has worked but said, [...] "It's all the same concept and the same principles as in a smaller film. You just scale it up. You <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> prep. We had three months of prep and loads of time to pre-rig stages. Part of it is having a really good crew—it's definitely not a one-man show." ...|$|E
