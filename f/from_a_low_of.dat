5|$|Accompanying {{the changes}} to timbre and volume was {{a shift in the}} typical pitch used to tune instruments. Instruments meant to play together, as in an orchestra, must be tuned to the same {{standard}} lest they produce audibly different sounds while playing the same notes. Beginning in 1762, the average concert pitch began rising <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> <b>of</b> 377 vibrations to a high of 457 in 1880 Vienna. Different regions, countries, and even instrument manufacturers preferred different standards, making orchestral collaboration a challenge. Despite even the efforts of two organized international summits attended by noted composers like Hector Berlioz, no standard could be agreed upon.|$|E

5|$|Although it is {{classified}} as least concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, and not listed nationally as threatened, the yellow-tailed black cockatoo is declining in numbers in Victoria and South Australia. This is due to habitat fragmentation and loss of large trees used for breeding hollows, although birds have become more plentiful {{in the vicinity of}} pine plantations. It has been listed as vulnerable in South Australia, due to its decline in the Adelaide and Mount Lofty Ranges, and particularly the perilous status of the small isolated population on the Eyre Peninsula, which has declined sharply since European settlement, probably from loss of suitable habitat. A recovery program was commenced in 1998. Efforts to increase the population include fencing off remnants of native bushland, planting food plants such as Hakea rugosa, monitoring breeding, and raising chicks in captivity.

5|$|The early 1950s saw {{dramatic}} changes in the world of U.S. science fiction publishing. At the start of 1949, {{all but one of the}} major magazines in the field were in pulp format; by the end of 1955, all had either ceased publication or switched to digest format. This change was largely the work of the distributors, such as American News Company, who refused to carry the pulp magazines since they were no longer profitable; the loss of profitability was in turn associated with the rise in mass-market science fiction publishing, with paperback publishers such as Ace Books and Ballantine Books becoming established. Along with the increase in science fiction in book form came a flood of new U.S. magazines: <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> <b>of</b> eight active magazines in 1946, the field expanded to twenty in 1950, and a further twenty-two had commenced publication by 1954.|$|E

In the late 1940s, the market began to recover. <b>From</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> <b>of</b> eight active US magazines in 1946, the field expanded to 20 just four years later. Galaxys appearance in 1950 was part of this boom. According to sf historian and critic Mike Ashley, its success was the main reason for a subsequent flood of new releases: 22 more science fiction magazines appeared by 1954, when the market dipped again as a side effect of US Senate hearings into the putative connection between comic books and juvenile delinquency.|$|E

Real wages in 1980 amounted to 232.7 rubles, compared to 166.3 rubles before the 1965 Soviet economic reform and the Eight-Five Year Plan. The first period, 1960–1964, was characterised by low growth, while the second period, 1965–1981, had a stronger growth rate.

Consumption of goods and daily demand also increased. The consumption of home appliances greatly increased. Refrigerators increased <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> <b>of</b> 109,000 in 1964 to 440,000 units by 1973; consumption declined during the reversal of the reform.

5|$|Docherty rebuilt {{confidence}} in the team and Villa {{went on to win}} five consecutive games and retained a place in the Second Division. In the short time that Docherty had been at the club, attendances rose significantly <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> <b>of</b> just over 12,000 against Charlton Athletic in December. In the summer of 1969 the first share issue since 1896 raised £200,000 for the club, £140,000 of which was spent on new players. In the following season, however, Villa took ten games to register a win. By Christmas 1969, Villa were {{at the bottom of the}} Second Division and Docherty was sacked. His successor, Vic Crowe, was unable to prevent Aston Villa from being relegated to the third tier of English football for the first time in its history in the 196970 season. Despite finishing fourth in the Third Division in the 197071 season, Villa reached the League Cup final after beating Manchester United in the semi-final. They were defeated in the final by Tottenham Hotspur 20. The 197172 season saw the club return to the Second Division as champions with a then divisional record 70 points. They were invited to take part in the 1972 FA Charity Shield but lost 1–0 to Manchester City. In the autumn of 1972, there was a revolt in the boardroom and four of the five directors voted to oust Doug Ellis from the board. Within 43days though, Ellis was reinstated as chairman after he received the support of the largest shareholder Pat Matthews, and the supporters at an EGM, who also voted to replace the existing directors. Their first season back in the Second Division in 197273 saw Villa narrowly miss out on a second successive promotion when they finished third. However, the following season Villa finished 14th and Ellis sacked Crowe, replacing him with Ron Saunders.|$|E
