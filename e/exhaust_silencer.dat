500|$|The {{tank was}} {{powered by a}} T-26 [...] flat row 4-cylinder {{air-cooled}} petrol engine, which was a complete Soviet copy of the Armstrong Siddeley engine used in the Vickers 6-Ton. The engine was located in the rear part of the hull. Early Soviet-made tank engines were of bad quality but they became better beginning in 1934. The T-26 (Armstrong Siddeley) engine {{did not have an}} over-speed limiter, which often resulted in overheating and engine valve breakage, especially in summer. A fuel tank for [...] and an oil box for [...] were placed alongside the engine. The engine required top-grade petrol; the use of second-rate petrol could cause damage to the valve units because of engine detonation. From mid-1932, a more capacious fuel tank (290 L instead of 182 L) and a simplified oil box were introduced. An engine cooling fan was mounted over the engine in a special shroud. From early 1932, the <b>exhaust</b> <b>silencer</b> was affixed by three clamps instead of two.|$|E

2500|$|The design {{specifically}} includes {{features for}} safety, reliability and appearance. In place of cardan shaft drives to the wheels, coupling rods {{were used to}} give people something to watch and engine covers were omitted to give {{a good view of}} the Rolls-Royce diesel engines. The full-length canopy above the engine covers not only adds to the distinctive outline but also supports the <b>exhaust</b> <b>silencer.</b> For added safety with only one man in the cab, a dead-man device is included, a pedal that when released triggers the braking system to bring the train safely to a halt. The turbocharged six-cylinder engine is rated at [...] and drives through a hydraulic transmission that has only one drive ratio. The result is a locomotive that accelerates quickly up to speed. All four locomotives were rebuilt in 2012–13 in readiness for the launch of the new [...] "traditional diesel" [...] service.|$|E

50|$|The {{square-shaped}} {{rear wheel}} arches became rounded in January 1972. Also in this year, a Triumph steering rack was fitted, giving a gearing that was somewhat lower than earlier Midgets. A second <b>exhaust</b> <b>silencer</b> was also added in 1972. Alternators were fitted instead of dynamos (generators) from 1973 onwards.|$|E
50|$|The Type XXIII had an {{all-welded}} single hull, {{the first}} submarine {{to use such}} a design.

50|$|The wagon's primary {{differences}} were a five speed manual gearbox, and no air conditioning (at least for UK market.) The estate had steel wheels and rear drum brakes {{instead of the}} saloon's discs, and had one less <b>exhaust</b> <b>silencer.</b> Altogether a less luxurious but more rugged car. There is a flip-up rear-facing seat in the cargo area technically making the 300C wagon a seven seater.|$|E
50|$|By definition, this {{configuration}} allows {{exhaust gases}} to flow straight to atmosphere. Consequently the gases do not {{pass through the}} catalytic converter or <b>exhaust</b> <b>silencer</b> which renders it illegal for street use due to noise and exhaust emission regulations in many countries. Whilst exhaust emission laws do not apply away from the public highways in most countries, many race tracks have strict noise rules in place once again outlawing screamer pipe use.|$|E
5000|$|Images of a {{glowplug}} {{engine and}} a [...] "diesel" [...] engine are shown below for comparison. The most obvious external difference is seen {{on top of}} the cylinder head. The glowplug engine's glow plug has a pinlike terminal for its center contact, which is an electrical connector for the glowplug. The [...] "diesel" [...] engine has a T-bar which is used for adjusting the compression. The cylindrical object behind the glowplug engine is an <b>exhaust</b> <b>silencer</b> or muffler.|$|E
50|$|This series, numbers 내연601 to 내연665 {{is made up}} of the 64 units {{delivered}} new to North Korea {{from the}} factory, as well as one unit obtained second-hand from the Polish State Railways (내연665). Interestingly, 내연656 (works number 1384, built 1971), although built for the Korean State Railway, wasn't delivered immediately, instead having served for some years with Soviet Railways, assigned to the Lvov region as M62-1265. Some of the units originally built for the DPRK have since been retrofitted with <b>exhaust</b> <b>silencers.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The exhaust noise, which {{falls into}} low-frequency noise, is the {{dominant}} noise source of a diesel engines and tractors. The traditional <b>exhaust</b> <b>silencers,</b> which are normally constructed by combination of expansion chamber, and perforated pipe or perforated board, are with high exhaust resistance, but poor noise reduction especially for the low-frequency band noise. For this reason, a new theory of exhaust muffler of diesel engine based on counter-phase counteracts has been proposed. The mathematical model and the corresponding experimental validation for the new exhaust muffler based on this theory were performed...|$|R
50|$|Minor changes such as: {{modified}} lower bodywork, {{changes to}} graphics and silver <b>exhaust</b> <b>silencers.</b> Magazines {{reported that the}} exhaust manifold now featured small chamfers on the collector for increased ground clearance. Cycle magazines also reported a change to the rear shock mounting geometry and front fork length to improve ground clearance. Graphics/paint schemes varied slightly between global markets. US models were available in blue/white and red/white schemes. The SACS acronym decal, located on the lower body work of the blue/white models, changed from a diagonal lettering to a straight lettering.|$|R
5000|$|From 1960 Velocette {{produced}} the Viper in a [...] "Clubman" [...] racing version, fitted with TT Amal carburettors, a BTH racing magneto {{and a close}} ratio gearbox, with the compression ratio raised to 9.3 to 1. The Clubman dispensed with the unpopular glass fibre enclosure and instead made a feature of its highly polished crankcase and gearbox castings. Supplied with [...] "rearset" [...] controls, lowered handlebars and a steering damper, the Clubman also had a range of optional accessories including a [...] "megaphone" [...] <b>exhaust</b> <b>silencer,</b> a rev counter and light alloy wheel rims.|$|E
50|$|Honda {{recommended}} daily checks of the lights, horn, tire pressure, brakes, fuel and oil level, and a weekly {{check of the}} battery electrolyte level. The new engine break in maintenance was done at 200 mi, requiring adjustment of the valve tappets and contact breaker points, and an oil change, and the rider was advised to stay under 30 mph for the first 500 mi. Every 1000 mi the spark plug needed cleaning, and the chain adjustment checked, and every 2000 mi an oil change, breaker point check, and valve adjustment was due. At 5000 mi, major maintenance was due, requiring the removal and cleaning of the carburetor, drive chain, <b>exhaust</b> <b>silencer,</b> and wheel bearings.

50|$|The {{full name}} is Ferrari 599 GTB Fiorano HGTE. An upgrade that {{improves}} the car's handling, meaning Handling Gran Turismo Evoluzione, includes a modified set-up with stiffer springs and rear anti-roll bar {{as well as}} new calibration settings for the Delphi MagneRide magneto-rheological shock absorbers when the manettino is at its sportier settings. The ride height has also been lowered, which lowers the car's center of gravity. The package also includes optimised tyres featuring a compound that offers improved grip. The car's electronics have also changed. The gearbox's shifts are faster in high-performance settings, while new engine software improved accelerator response. The <b>exhaust</b> <b>silencer</b> was modified to produce more marked and thrilling sound under hard usage while still delivering just the right comfort levels at cruising speed. The exterior and interior were upgraded with more carbon fiber components and it also includes new 20-inch wheels.|$|E
