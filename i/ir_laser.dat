25|$|Data {{from the}} tests {{suggested}} that about 10MJ of x-ray energy {{would be needed}} to reach ignition. If this energy is supplied by an <b>IR</b> <b>laser</b> to a hohlraum, as in Nova or NIF, this corresponds to an original laser energy on the order of 100MJ, well beyond the reach of existing technologies.|$|E
25|$|The vacuum {{ultraviolet}} (VUV) band (100–200nm) can {{be generated}} by non-linear 4 wave mixing in gases by sum or difference frequency mixing of 2 or more longer wavelength lasers. The generation is generally done in gasses (e.g. krypton, hydrogen which are two-photon resonant near 193nm) or metal vapors (e.g. magnesium). By making one of the lasers tunable, the VUV can be tuned. If one of the lasers is resonant with a transition in the gas or vapor then the VUV production is intensified. However, resonances also generate wavelength dispersion, and thus the phase matching can limit the tunable range of the 4 wave mixing. Difference frequency mixing (lambda1 + lambda2 − lambda3) has an advantage over sum frequency mixing because the phase matching can provide greater tuning. In particular, difference frequency mixing two photons of an ArF (193nm) excimer laser with a tunable visible or near <b>IR</b> <b>laser</b> in hydrogen or krypton provides resonantly enhanced tunable VUV covering from 100nm to 200nm. Practically, the lack of suitable gas/vapor cell window materials above the lithium fluoride cut-off wavelength limit the tuning range to longer than about 110nm. Tunable VUV wavelengths down to 75 nm was achieved using window-free configurations.|$|E
25|$|Nano-FTIR {{was first}} {{described}} in 2005 in a patent by Ocelic and Hillenbrand as Fourier transform spectroscopy of tip-scattered light with an asymmetric spectrometer (i.e. the tip/sample placed {{inside one of}} the interferometer arms). The first realization of s-SNOM with FTIR was demonstrated in 2006 in the laboratory of F. Keilmann using a mid-infrared source based on a simple version of nonlinear difference-frequency generation (DFG). However, the mid-IR spectra in this realization were recorded using dual comb spectroscopy principles, yielding a discrete set of frequencies and thus demonstrating a multiheterodyne imaging technique rather than nano-FTIR. The first continuous spectra were recorded only in 2009 in the same laboratory using a supercontinuum IR beam also obtained by DFG in GaSe upon superimposing two pulsed trains emitted from Er-doped fiber laser. This source further allowed in 2011 for the first assessment of nanoscale-resolved spectra of SiC with excellent quality and spectral resolution. At the same time, Huth et al. in the laboratory of R. Hillenbrand used IR radiation from a simple glowbar source in combination with the principles of Fourier transform spectroscopy, to record IR spectra of p-doped Si and its oxides in a semiconductor device. In the same work the term nano-FTIR was first introduced. However, an insufficient spectral irradiance of glowbar sources limited the applicability of the technique to the detection of strongly-resonant excitations such phonons; and the early supercontinuum <b>IR</b> <b>laser</b> sources, while providing more power, had very narrow bandwidth (<300nbsp&cm−1). Further attempt to improve the spectral power, while retaining the large bandwidth of a glowbar source was made by utilizing the IR radiation from a high temperature argon arc source (also known as plasma source). However, due to lack of commercial availability and rapid development of the IR supercontinium laser sources, plasma sources are not widely utilized in nano-FTIR.|$|E

2500|$|IR-visible sum {{frequency}} generation spectroscopy uses two laser beams that spatially and temporally overlap at a {{surface of a}} material or the interface between two media. [...] An output beam is generated at a frequency of {{the sum of the}} two input beams. The two input beams {{have to be able to}} access the surface, and the output beam needs to be able to leave the surface to be picked up by a detector.

In the case of broadband spectrometers, one laser (typically the visible laser) is kept at a fixed narrow wavelength, and the other laser produces a spectrally broad beam.

50|$|Though the IR from a DPSS laser is less collimated, {{the typical}} neodymium-doped {{crystals}} in such lasers do produce a true <b>IR</b> <b>laser</b> beam. The eye will usually {{react to the}} higher-powered visible light; however in higher power DPSS lasers the <b>IR</b> <b>laser</b> output can be significant. What poses a special hazard for this unfiltered IR output is its presence in conjunction with laser safety goggles designed to only block the visible wavelengths of the laser. Red goggles, for example, will block most green light from entering the eyes, but will pass IR light. The reduced light behind the goggles may also cause the pupils to dilate, increasing the hazard to the invisible IR light. Dual-frequency so-called YAG laser eyewear is significantly more expensive than single frequency laser eyewear, and is often not supplied with unfiltered DPSS pointer style lasers, which output 1064 nm <b>IR</b> <b>laser</b> light as well. These potentially hazardous lasers produce little or no visible beam when shone through the eyewear supplied with them, yet their IR-laser output can still be easily seen when viewed with an IR-sensitive video camera.|$|E
