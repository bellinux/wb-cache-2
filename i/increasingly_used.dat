5|$|Today, {{the breed}} is used mainly for meat, {{due to its}} {{extensive}} musculature. Horse meat is a dietary staple in many European countries, including France, Belgium, Germany and Switzerland. However, they are <b>increasingly</b> <b>used</b> for farm, forest and leisure work. Their nimble action, stamina and good temper make them <b>increasingly</b> <b>used</b> for competitive driving across Europe, and they have also been used as mounts for therapeutic horseback riding. The breed {{is known for its}} ability to work in rough, hilly terrain.|$|E
5|$|According to McGregor, the {{military}} <b>increasingly</b> <b>used</b> Sudirman's {{image as a}} symbol of leadership as it gained more political power. An image of Sudirman was featured on every denomination of the 1968 series of rupiah. He featured as a major character in several war films, including Janur Kuning (Yellow Coconut Leaf; 1979) and Serangan Fajar (Dawn Attack; 1982).|$|E
5|$|By 1915 when Tolkien {{was writing}} his first elven poems, the words elf, fairy and gnome had many {{divergent}} and contradictory associations. Tolkien had been gently warned against {{using the term}} 'fairy', which John Garth supposes {{may have been due}} to the word becoming <b>increasingly</b> <b>used</b> to indicate homosexuality, although despite this warning Tolkien continued to use it.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to agriculture, slave labor was <b>increasingly</b> <b>used</b> in mining, shipbuilding and other industries. The execution of Gabriel Prosser in 1800, Nat Turner's slave rebellion in 1831 and John Brown's Raid on Harpers Ferry in 1859 marked the growing social discontent over slavery {{and its role}} in the plantation economy. By 1860, almost half a million people, roughly 31% of the total population of Virginia, were enslaved. This division contributed {{to the start of the}} American Civil War.|$|E
5|$|The {{morphological}} {{characteristics of}} caterpillars and pupae used for classification are {{completely different from}} that of adults; different classification schemes are sometimes provided separately for classifying adults, larvae and pupae. The characteristics of immature stages are <b>increasingly</b> <b>used</b> for taxonomic purposes as they provide insights into systematics and phylogenies of Lepidoptera that are not apparent from examination of adults.|$|E
5|$|The terms {{attachment}} disorder, attachment problems, and attachment therapy, although <b>increasingly</b> <b>used,</b> have no clear, specific, or consensus definitions. However, {{the terms}} and therapies often are applied to children who are maltreated, particularly those in the foster care, kinship care, or adoption systems, and related populations such as children adopted internationally from orphanages.|$|E

5|$|By {{the late}} 4th century, the Empire had become chronically {{deficient}} in raising sufficient troops from amongst its own population. As an alternative, taxation raised internally was <b>increasingly</b> <b>used</b> to subsidise {{growing numbers of}} barbarian recruits. The Romans had, for some time, recruited individual non-Roman soldiers into regular military units. In 358AD, this practice was accelerated by the wholescale adoption of the entire Salian Franks people into the Empire, providing a ready pool of such recruits. In return for being allowed to settle as foederatii in northern Gallia on the near side of the Rhine, the Franks were expected to defend the Empire's borders in their territory and provide troops to serve in Roman units.|$|E
5|$|Horse {{ownership}} {{was widespread}} by the 12th century. Both tenant farmers and landlords {{were involved in}} the harrowing of land for arable crops in the relatively new open field system, and employed horses for this work. Horses and carts were <b>increasingly</b> <b>used</b> for transporting farm goods and implements; peasants were obliged to transport such items in their own carts, though the poorest may have had to rely on one horse for all their farm work. The necessity for carting produce revolutionised communication between villages. Horse-breeding as an enterprise continued; in the 14th century, Hexham Priory had 80broodmares, the Prior of Durham owned two stud farms, Rievaulx Abbey owned one, Gilbert d'Umfraville, Earl of Angus, in Scotland, had significant grazing lands for mares, and horse-breeding was being carried out both east and west of the Pennines.|$|E
5|$|In 1326 Provost Adam de Brome was {{appointed}} warden of St Bartholomew's; a leper hospital in Cowley Marsh, {{the hospital was}} later granted to the college by Edward III, along with the payments it had been receiving from the fee farm. It was <b>increasingly</b> <b>used</b> as a rest house for sick members of the college needing a change of air. In 1649 the college rebuilt the main hospital range north of the chapel, destroyed in the Civil War, as a row of four almshouses, called Bartlemas House. Bartlemas Chapel and two farm cottages are the other extant buildings.|$|E

5|$|Metal corsets {{for medical}} {{purposes}} {{continued to be}} used in the 18th and early 19th century, although equivalent garments made from canvas were <b>increasingly</b> <b>used</b> in their place. In 1894, A.M. Phelps of the American Orthopaedic Association recommended an aluminium corset coated with waterproof enamel for sufferers of Pott disease or curvature of the spine. Made from a cast of the patient's body, the advantages of such a garment were that aluminium was lightweight, durable, thin enough to be worn beneath clothing, and could be worn while bathing. Such corsets were still being recommended in the early 20th century as cheaper and more durable in the longer run than plaster moulds, although their initial expense was greater.|$|E
5|$|Route {{branding}} {{has been}} <b>increasingly</b> <b>used</b> by Lothian since {{the introduction of}} low floor vehicles. Route branding highlights the route of certain services making the buses easier to be spotted throughout Lothian. Since May 2010 the Harlequin livery used to identify low floor buses has started to be phased out, as the company is now a full low floor operation, with {{a return to the}} traditional madder and white livery although the style has been altered slightly to suit the lines of modern buses. Each type of bus owned directly by Lothian Buses has had at least one of their type painted in the new livery.|$|E
5|$|The {{east coast}} of the U.S. also began to consume more ice, {{particularly}} as more industrial and private customers found uses for refrigeration. Ice became <b>increasingly</b> <b>used</b> in the northeast of the U.S. to preserve dairy products and fresh fruit for market, the chilled goods being transported over the growing railroad lines. By the 1840s, ice was being used to transfer small quantities of goods further west across the continent. Eastern U.S. fishermen began to use ice to preserve their catches. Fewer businesses or individuals in the east harvested their own ice independently in winter, most preferring to rely on commercial providers.|$|E

5|$|The {{government}} {{department responsible for}} the NHS is the Department of Health, headed by the Secretary of State for Health, who sits in the British Cabinet. Most of the expenditure of the Department of Health is spent on the NHS—£98.6billion was spent in 2008–2009. In recent years the private sector has been <b>increasingly</b> <b>used</b> to provide more NHS services despite opposition by doctors and trade unions. The average life expectancy of people in England is 77.5 years for males and 81.7 years for females, the highest of the four countries of the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of Auxois are still bred for meat production, and in 2001, 50% {{of the horses}} bred were intended for slaughter. However, the power and gaits of the breed make them valued for competitive and leisure driving, as well as equestrian tourism. The smaller horses of the breed are used for milk production. The Auxois is used for celebrations, such as weddings, and historical reenactments. It is also used for logging, and in recent years, has been <b>increasingly</b> <b>used</b> in agriculture, being found in vineyards, gardens and farms. The use of them {{for the maintenance of}} rural roads is also in planning.|$|E
5|$|The wing began flying night defence patrols {{shortly after}} No.452 Squadron arrived at Morotai. At the time Morotai {{was a major}} Allied base and had been {{attacked}} by Japanese aircraft on multiple occasions. During the night of 24December a Spitfire shot down a Japanese bomber over the island. This proved {{to be one of}} the last Japanese raids on Morotai, however, and no further interceptions were made. The lack of aerial opposition meant that No.80 Wing's aircraft were <b>increasingly</b> <b>used</b> to strafe Japanese positions near Morotai. During January 1945 the wing flew 84 ground attack sorties, losing three Spitfires in the process. The lack of opportunities for aerial combat disappointed No.80 Wing's pilots and contributed to a decline in their morale.|$|E

5|$|A {{person with}} MS can have almost any {{neurological}} symptom or sign, with autonomic, visual, motor, and sensory problems {{being the most}} common. The specific symptoms {{are determined by the}} locations of the lesions within the nervous system, and may include loss of sensitivity or changes in sensation such as tingling, pins and needles or numbness, muscle weakness, blurred vision, very pronounced reflexes, muscle spasms, or difficulty in moving; difficulties with coordination and balance (ataxia); problems with speech or swallowing, visual problems (nystagmus, optic neuritis or double vision), feeling tired, acute or chronic pain, and bladder and bowel difficulties, among others. Difficulties thinking and emotional problems such as depression or unstable mood are also common. Uhthoff's phenomenon, a worsening of symptoms due to exposure to higher than usual temperatures, and Lhermitte's sign, an electrical sensation that runs down the back when bending the neck, are particularly characteristic of MS. The main measure of disability and severity is the expanded disability status scale (EDSS), with other measures such as the multiple sclerosis functional composite being <b>increasingly</b> <b>used</b> in research.|$|E
5|$|Biblical Hebrew {{has been}} written {{with a number of}} {{different}} writing systems. The Hebrews adopted the Phoenician alphabet around the 12th centuryBCE, which developed into the Paleo-Hebrew alphabet. This was retained by the Samaritans, who use the descendent Samaritan alphabet to this day. However, the Aramaic alphabet gradually displaced the Paleo-Hebrew alphabet for the Jews, and it became the source for the modern Hebrew alphabet. All of these scripts were lacking letters to represent all of the sounds of Biblical Hebrew, though these sounds are reflected in Greek and Latin transcriptions/translations of the time. These scripts originally only indicated consonants, but certain letters, known by the Latin term matres lectionis, became <b>increasingly</b> <b>used</b> to mark vowels. In the Middle Ages, various systems of diacritics were developed to mark the vowels in Hebrew manuscripts; of these, only the Tiberian vocalization is still in wide use.|$|E
5|$|In {{the absence}} of officially {{recognized}} diagnostic criteria, and beyond the ambit of the discourse on a broader set of criteria discussed above, the term attachment disorder has been <b>increasingly</b> <b>used</b> by some clinicians {{to refer to a}} broader set of children whose behavior may be affected by lack of a primary attachment figure, a seriously unhealthy attachment relationship with a primary caregiver, or a disrupted attachment relationship. Although there are no studies examining diagnostic accuracy, concern is expressed as to the potential for over-diagnosis based on broad checklists and 'snapshots'. This form of therapy, including diagnosis and accompanying parenting techniques, is scientifically unvalidated and is not considered to be part of mainstream psychology or, despite its name, to be based on attachment theory, with which it is considered incompatible. It has been described as potentially abusive and a pseudoscientific intervention, that has resulted in tragic outcomes for children.|$|E
