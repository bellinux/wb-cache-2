Hakuin despaired over this story, as it showed that even a great monk could not be saved from a bloody death in this life. How then could he, <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> monk, hope to be saved from the tortures of hell in the next life? He gave up his goal of {{becoming}} an enlightened monk, and not wanting to return home in shame, traveled around studying literature and poetry.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} {{evidence of}} building {{activity on the}} site dates from around 600 BC. At this time the Skiloudians, allies of the Pistans, built the Temple of Hera. The Treasuries and the Pelopion were built {{during the course of}} the 6th century BC. The secular structures and athletic arenas were also under construction during this period including the Bouleuterion. The first stadium was constructed around 560 BC, it consisted of <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> track. The stadium was remodelled around 500 BC with sloping sides for spectators and shifted slightly to the east. Over the course of the 6th century BC a range of sports were added to the Olympic festival. In 580 BC, Elis, in alliance with Sparta, occupied Pisa and regained the control over the sanctuary.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to staying below the arcing voltage, the ignition system keep the voltage across the points below the breakdown voltage for an air gap {{to prevent a}} glow discharge across the points. Such a glow discharge would quickly transition to an arc, and the arc would prevent the spark plug from firing. The minimum voltage for a glow discharge in air is about 320V. Consequently, the capacitor value is chosen to also keep the voltage across the points {{to be less than}} 320V. Keeping the points from arcing when they separate is the reason the ignition coil includes a secondary winding rather than using <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> inductor. If the transformer has a 100:1 ratio, then the secondary voltage can reach 30kV.|$|E
25|$|The {{filaments}} {{can burn}} out (fail) {{at the end}} of the lamp's lifetime, opening the circuit and losing the capability to heat up. Both filaments lose function as they are connected in series, with <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> switch start circuit a broken filament will render the lamp completely useless. Filaments rarely burn out or fail open circuit unless the filament becomes depleted of emitter and the control gear is able to supply a high enough voltage across the tube to operate it in cold cathode mode. Some digital electronic ballasts are capable of detecting broken filaments and can still strike an arc with one or both filaments broken providing there is still sufficient emitter. A broken filament in a lamp attached to a magnetic ballast often causes both lamps to burn out or flicker.|$|E

25|$|The {{others can}} be {{standing}} or sitting. With the exception of Yakushi Nyorai, all statues are empty-handed and their fingers make a mudra. To the contrary, Yakushi Nyorai's right hand always holds some object, either a sphere or a small jar, while the other makes a mudra. Dainichi Nyorai's hands make a characteristic mudra (the fingers {{of his left hand}} hold his right hand's index, see photo). Excepted Dainichi Nyorai, who is represented with some body ornamentation like a bodhisattva, all statues wear <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> robe without body ornamentation, signs of priesthood. This is because they represent someone who has reached enlightenment. The robe can cover one or both shoulders. The head has a round protuberance on top with the hair divided in tight curls.

25|$|For example, in act 1, scene 2, the {{scenario}} is that Jenny and other girls are walking to Mahagonny. The music is surprisingly simple; <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> solo {{with a short}} chorus and sparse orchestration. The music is not some baroque contrapuntal scheme, {{nor is it a}} Romantic forest of sound; rather, the music is very easy to listen to. This music setting matches with the idea of making music accessible to the public, and not just for educated artists. The music style also displays influences from popular music. During this time, American jazz was a sensation in Europe; since opera is set in America, {{it is not surprising that}} the tune and the beat have a jazz influence. The orchestration, also includes such non-classical instruments as a saxophone, a decidedly jazz instrument. By using a jazz style in the music, Weill immediately associates the action as happening in America. In addition to making a relatively exotic sound, Weill manages to incorporate the jazz style in the song without making it seem incongruous; the American and European music are seamlessly joined under Weill's hands.|$|E
500|$|A central {{element of}} the episode’s plot line {{concerns}} the fictional [...] "tween wave" [...] genre of music, which consists of audible flatulence and defecation in a literal sense. In the episode, children love tween wave while adults are generally repelled by it; this joke serves as a commentary on generation gaps. In this sense, Parker related it to the plot line of the Hans Christian Andersen short story [...] "The Emperor's New Clothes". Reviewers interpreted the episode's use of literal feces as <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> example of the show's use of scatological humor, but also a comment on the dismissiveness of things vulgarly described as [...] "crap" [...] or [...] "shit." [...] Alan Sepinwall of HitFix interpreted the final dialogue as a criticism of those lacking passion, and also an observation on the show's recurring philosophy, which he described as the exact opposite: [...] "how other people care too much about things, and {{that many of our}} big problems and scandals would go away if everyone could just relax and feel less passionate." ...|$|E

500|$|Stephen G. Haw, however, {{challenges}} {{this idea}} that Polo exaggerated his own importance, writing that, [...] "contrary to what has often been said...Marco does not claim any very exalted position for himself in the Yuan empire." [...] He points out that Marco never {{claimed to be a}} minister of high rank, a darughachi, a leader of a tumen (i.e. 10,000 men), not even the leader of 1,000 men, only that he was an emissary for the khan and held a position of some honor. Haw sees this as a reasonable claim if Marco was a keshig, who numbered some fourteen thousand at the time. Haw explains how the earliest manuscripts of Polo's accounts provide contradicting information about his role in Yangzhou, with some stating he was <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> resident, others stating he was a governor, and Ramusio's manuscript claiming he was simply holding that office as a temporary substitute for someone else, yet all the manuscripts concur that he worked as an esteemed emissary for the khan. Haw also objected to the approach to finding mention of Marco Polo in Chinese texts, contending that contemporaneous Europeans had little regard for using surnames, and a direct Chinese transcription of the name [...] "Marco" [...] ignores the possibility of him taking on a Chinese or even Mongol name that had no bearing or similarity with his Latin name.|$|E

[...] Anna Pickard from The Guardian complimented the video saying that [...] "quite {{a lot of work}} has gone into it". However, she opined that the video was too long. Entertainment Weekly gave a positive review of the video, saying it [...] "gives us even more of the next-level cuckoo we've come to expect from the girl born Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta." [...] The paparazzi theme of the video was compared to Britney Spears's 2004 music video, [...] "Everytime". MTV News called the video a [...] "1940s romantic-epic-style video" [...] that [...] "proves once and for all that Gaga is a true original with a unique vision." [...] The video was nominated for five VMAs at the 2009 awards in the categories of Best Direction, Best Editing, Best Special Effects, Best Cinematography and Best Art Direction. Along with four other nominations for [...] "Poker Face", she and Beyoncé were tied for most nominations that year. The video won the award for Best Art Direction and Best Special Effects.
