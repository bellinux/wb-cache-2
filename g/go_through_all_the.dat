5|$|Within the week, {{they had}} a working game written in Adobe Flash's ActionScript 2. The two agreed to {{complete}} it out as a game they could release on Steam though with no expectations of sales. Completion of the game from the prototype to the finished state took about 3 months with part-time development. During this time, they discovered there were several limitations on the {{size and scope of}} both Flash and ActionScript that limited how much they could do with the game, but continued to use the tools as to release the title. McMillen said that because they were not worried about sales, they were able to work with Valve to release the game without fears of censorship or having to seek an ESRB rating. Releasing through Steam also enabled them to update the game freely, several times on its initial release, an aspect that they could not do with other consoles without significant cost to themselves. They did release without significant end-user testing, as it would have taken several hundreds of users to <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> various combinations of items that a player could collect, and McMillen recognized they had released the title with their buyers being playtesters for them. A week after the Steam release, McMillen released a demo version via the website Newgrounds. Merge Games produced a physical edition that included the game, soundtrack, and a poster, for stores in the United Kingdom in 2012.|$|E

25|$|After a year, {{one of the}} commission's {{members was}} replaced, as his tenure was finished. This delayed the work as his {{replacement}} had to <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> findings to catch up. The duration of the investigation was criticized by the press and next of kin, but the commission stated {{that it was necessary}} with a prescribed degree of diligence in the matter. An issue of particular interest was the ILS system at Fornebu, which would under given circumstances produce false signals. The commission found no way of terminating the shortcomings. By August 1975 a preliminary report was sent to the involved parties. Despite promises of immediate release, the publication was postponed further to sort out further details. The final draft was given to the Ministry of Transport and Communications on 18 December. The report went public on 4 January 1976.|$|E

25|$|Though the {{laboratory}} did not employ any revolutionary measurement techniques, it was unique {{because of the}} simple logistics of constructing such a demonstration within a limited space and have it quickly and efficiently be able to gather all the necessary data. The laboratory itself was a see-through (lattice-walled) fenced off gallery measuring 36 feet long by 6 feet long. To collect data efficiently, Galton {{had to make the}} process as simple as possible for people to understand. As a result, subjects were taken through {{the laboratory}} in pairs so that explanations could be given to two at a time, also in the hope that one of the two would confidently take the initiative to <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> tests first, encouraging the other. With this design, the total time spent in the exhibit was fourteen minutes for each pair.|$|E

However, at the same time, 48% agreed [...] "constitutional monarchy is outmoded and would prefer a republican system of government with an elected head of state, like in the United States," [...] and 65% believed that the royals were simply celebrities who should not have any formal role in Canada. The same poll found that 58% of respondents felt [...] "the issue of the monarchy and the form of Canada's government isn't important to them and if the system is working OK why <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> fuss to change it?" [...] A poll by Léger Marketing found that 50% of those polled believed the monarchy should be preserved, while 43% disagreed.|$|E

2500|$|Conflict {{between the}} Smithsonian and Zeckendorf plans {{came to a}} head in late 1955. [...] The Smithsonian had {{approached}} Zeckendorf in February 1954 and proposed that their airplane museum become the [...] "cultural center" [...] envisioned by the redevelopment plan. But nothing came of this proposal. [...] In September 1954, the NCPC came close to reversing itself and approving the Smithsonian plan. But John Remon, chairman of the RLA, strenuously objected. In February 1955, the NCPC tentatively approved the area {{on the south side of}} Independence Avenue SW between 9th and 12th Streets for the Air Museum. [...] But it reversed itself in April, and said 10th Street SW would <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> way to Independence Avenue. The approval of first one plan and then another created great controversy. [...] The NCPC formally suspended its decision-making process in late November because of the Smithsonian's desire to build along Independence Avenue. At issue was a memorandum of understanding (MOU) signed by Zeckendorf and the RLA in 1954. [...] The MOU stated that 10th Street would be used as an esplanade — a use which would be denied if 10th Street were blocked off at its northern end by a large museum building.|$|E
2500|$|The Muon Spectrometer is an {{extremely}} large tracking system, consisting of three parts: (1) a magnetic field provided by three toroidal magnets, (2) a set of 1200 chambers measuring with high spatial precision the tracks of the outgoing muons, (3) a set of triggering chambers with accurate time-resolution. The extent of this sub-detector starts at a radius of 4.25m close to the calorimeters out to the full radius of the detector (11m). [...] Its tremendous size is required to accurately measure the momentum of muons, which first <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> {{other elements of the}} detector before reaching the muon spectrometer. It was designed to measure, standalone, the momentum of 100 GeV muons with 3% accuracy and of 1 TeV muons with 10% accuracy. It was vital to go to the lengths of putting together such a large piece of equipment because a number of interesting physical processes can only be observed if one or more muons are detected, and because the total energy of particles in an event could not be measured if the muons were ignored. It functions similarly to the Inner Detector, with muons curving so that their momentum can be measured, albeit with a different magnetic field configuration, lower spatial precision, and a much larger volume. [...] It also serves the function of simply identifying muons – very few particles of other types are expected to pass through the calorimeters and subsequently leave signals in the Muon Spectrometer. [...] It has roughly one million readout channels, and its layers of detectors have a total area of 12,000square meters.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{positive}} review {{centering on}} the science fiction elements of the film was relayed by Janet Maslin of The New York Times. She praised the theme saying, [...] "Alien Nation has the best science-fiction idea this side of The Terminator." [...] However, Maslin was quick to admit the film [...] "settles down, with remarkable ease, into the routine of a two-cop buddy film, extraterrestrials and all. Matthew and Sam (whom Matthew refuses to address that way, renaming him George) <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> familiar stages of forging a friendship between partners: cool antipathy, exchanges of insults, growing mutual respect on the job and, finally, an all-night drinking binge to solidify their buddyhood." [...] On a negative front, author Jay Carr of The Boston Globe commented on James Caan's performance viewing him [...] "Looking like a Paul Newman gone wrong, ..." [...] He went on further stating that [...] "the film's air of enlightenment is only makeup deep. And while [...] 'Alien Nation' [...] is no smarter than, say, a [...] 'Lethal Weapon' , it hasn't got the juice or the level of sensory jolt a [...] 'Lethal Weapon' [...] supplies." [...] Other critics such as Gene Siskel acknowledged the similarities between other police thriller movies, but still found the film to be a [...] "Genuinely entertaining version of that old reliable; a cop buddy picture with two very different detectives." [...] He explained, [...] "Now {{this is an example}} of how a you can put a nice twist on a familiar story, and it will work if it's been fully written. Caan and Patinkin have special characters to play." [...] Compelled by the acting, he felt [...] "The buddy combination here, worked for me." [...] He ultimately gave the film a [...] "Thumbs Up" [...] review. Not nearly as impressed with the film was author NF of TimeOut Magazine calling it, [...] "Worthy, predictable, and dull." [...] A summation of the negativity was described as being, [...] "Played hard and fast, the film might just have worked, but the decision to soft-pedal the violence merely emphasises the obviousness of the liberal point-scoring (parallels with Vietnamese or Nicaraguan refugees are so facile as to be crass)." [...] Critic Leonard Maltin bluntly referred to the film as [...] "A great concept that doesn't quite pay off." [...] But in a hint of commendation, he remarked how the film contains [...] "many clever touches and terrific performances by Caan and Patinkin." ...|$|E
