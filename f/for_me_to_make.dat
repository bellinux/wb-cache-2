So that's what I did." [...] She explained that she wanted the song to be [...] "tasteful, yet sexual" [...] and described it as [...] "very sexy, but very musical at the same time". She said, [...] "The songs I had before, even though they were explicit to an extent, they were just fun. It was time when we just wanted to make that sort of record, and we did. It's probably one of the sexier songs on the record, but I think it needed that!"

The first single [...] "Beat of My Drum" [...] had an on-sale release meaning it had little promotion beforehand and commercially it peaked at number 27 in the United Kingdom but critically it garnered acclaim from critics which Roberts described as [...] "amazing". A second single [...] "Lucky Day" [...] was released shortly after and whilst gaining positive reviews it failed to make an impact commercially peaking at number 40 in the UK.
