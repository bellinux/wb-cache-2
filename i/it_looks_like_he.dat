5|$|Sandy, Patrick, and Squidward {{arrive at}} a gas station and from reading a {{newspaper}} article, discover SpongeBob's appointment as mayor of New Kelp City. But when they go to New Kelp City to retrieve him, SpongeBob cannot remember who they are. Squidward hi-jinks SpongeBob's limousine and gets away from the city with SpongeBob, Patrick and Sandy in tow and they return to the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob still does not recall the eatery and wants to return to New Kelp City to resume his job as mayor. Delighted that SpongeBob is leaving again, Squidward requests for his jewel encrusted egg but slips and accidentally throws the egg onto SpongeBob's head, which causes his memory to come back. Patrick, Sandy and Mr. Krabs apologize to SpongeBob for selfishly running him out of Bikini Bottom and are happy to have him back. But even so, SpongeBob still wants to return to New Kelp City. He changes his mind after a breaking news report comes on, saying that the bubbles in New Kelp City are blinding the citizens, and a thug threatens to do something to SpongeBob if he ever comes back. SpongeBob starts cooking Krabby Patties again, much to his friends' delight. With a sigh of happiness, SpongeBob says that <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> will be back in Bikini Bottom. Upon hearing this, Squidward takes out his brain and drops it in a trash can.|$|E
500|$|During pre-season, {{ahead of}} the 2006–07 campaign, May injured his {{shoulder}} in training, resulting in him missing the club's pre-season tour of Iceland. Millwall manager Nigel Spackman revealed that May's injury would rule {{him out of the}} first two months of the season — [...] "He fell over during the close season, and <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> is going to be out for a couple of months". He made his first appearance of the season in October 2006, coming on as a second-half substitute in Millwall's 2–0 home win against Bournemouth in the Football League Trophy, scoring Millwall's second goal with his first touch of the game. In his first start of the season, he scored after six minutes in the club's 2–1 FA Cup win against Havant & Waterlooville in a game played at Fratton Park, netting from close range after good work from Chris Hackett. Five days later, he provided the assist for Darren Byfield's goal in a 2–2 home draw with Doncaster Rovers. May scored his third goal in five appearances when he scored in Millwall's 3–1 loss at Nottingham Forest on 24 November 2006. After Millwall's 2–0 home win against Bradford City, a game in which May assisted Filipe Morais in scoring Millwall's first goal, Millwall manager Willie Donachie stated — [...] "There's more to come from this team, especially Darren Byfield and Ben May, who are as good as anyone in this league. They're committed, honest players who want to work for each other". Three days later, on 12 December 2006, May's pacey cross resulted in Nathan Doyle putting the ball into his own net, giving Millwall a 1–0 win against Bradford City after extra-time in the FA Cup. May scored the only goal of the game in a 1–0 victory at Yeovil Town on 3 February 2007, converting Darren Byfield's cross to give Millwall the three points. However, he was substituted after 53 minutes in the same game with an ankle injury, and in March 2007, he was ruled out of first-team action {{for the rest of the}} 2006–07 season. Despite this, he made a second-half substitute appearance on the last day of the season in a 2–2 draw at Bradford City, assisting Darren Byfield's goal just after coming on. May scored four times in 19 appearances in a season disrupted by injuries.|$|E

Despite this he feels repulsion for the [...] "new kind of photographs" [...] that inhabit the island, but as time goes by he accepts their existence as something better than his own. He learns how to operate the machine and inserts himself into the recording so <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> and Faustine are in love, even though she might have slept with Alec and Haynes. This bothers him, but he is confident it will not matter in the eternity they will spend together. At least he is sure she is not Morel's lover.|$|E

However, just as <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> might succeed, Wolfram & Hart bring in Drusilla to turn Darla back into a vampire.

2500|$|Bayern did not {{contest the}} Belmont Stakes and was instead {{aimed at the}} seven-furlong Woody Stephens Stakes at the same meeting. He contested the early lead before taking a clear {{advantage}} entering the straight and drew away in the closing stages to win by {{seven and a half}} lengths from Top Fortitude. His winning time of 1:20.75 was less than a second off the track record. [...] Stevens returned as his jockey and said, [...] "That was a powerhouse performance. He had a bad experience in the gate in the Preakness. Jimmy Barnes [...] and Bob's crew did a great job getting him ready by schooling, schooling, schooling him." [...] Bayern was moved back up in class and distance for the Grade I Haskell Invitational over nine furlongs at Monmouth Park on July 27. Ridden for the first time by Martin Garcia, he was the second choice in the betting behind the filly Untapable.

After the race, the trainer, who said that he had considered keeping the horse to sprint distances, stated, [...] "We tried to slow him down in the past, but now we know we just have to utilize his speed.
