25|$|A {{heat pump}} uses an {{electrically}} driven compressor {{to operate a}} refrigeration cycle that extracts heat energy from outdoor air, the ground or ground water, and moves that heat to the space to be warmed. A liquid contained within the evaporator section of the heat pump boils at low pressure, absorbing heat energy from the outdoor air or the ground. The vapor is then compressed by a compressor and piped into a condenser coil within the building to be heated. The heat from the hot dense gas is absorbed by {{the air in the}} building (and sometimes also used for domestic hot water) causing the hot working fluid to condense back into a liquid. From there the <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>fluid</b> is passed back to the evaporator section where it expands through an orifice and into the evaporator section, completing the cycle. In the summer months, the cycle can be reversed to move heat out of the conditioned space and to the outside air.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect of}} the {{combustion}} of propellant in the rocket engine {{is to increase the}} velocity of the resulting gases to very high speeds, hence producing a thrust. Initially, the gases of combustion are sent in every direction, but only those that produce a net thrust have any effect. The ideal direction of motion of the exhaust is in the direction so as to cause thrust. At the top end of the combustion chamber the hot, energetic gas fluid cannot move forward, and so, it pushes upward against the top of the rocket engine's combustion chamber. As the combustion gases approach the exit of the combustion chamber, they increase in speed. The {{effect of the}} convergent part of the rocket engine nozzle on the <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>fluid</b> of combustion gases, is to cause the gases to accelerate to high speed. The higher the speed of the gases, the lower the pressure of the gas (Bernoulli's principle or conservation of energy) acting on that part of the combustion chamber. In a properly designed engine, the flow will reach Mach 1 at the throat of the nozzle. At which point the speed of the flow increases. Beyond the throat of the nozzle, a bell shaped expansion part of the engine allows the gases that are expanding to push against that part of the rocket engine. Thus, the bell part of the nozzle gives additional thrust. Simply expressed, for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction, according to Newton's third law with the result that the exiting gases produce the reaction of a force on the rocket causing it to accelerate the rocket.|$|E
50|$|A {{pressure}} exchanger transfers pressure energy from a <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>fluid</b> stream {{to a low}} pressure fluid stream. Many industrial processes operate at elevated pressures and have high pressure waste streams. One way of providing a <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>fluid</b> to such a process is to transfer the waste pressure to a low pressure stream using a {{pressure exchanger}}.|$|E
50|$|Back-siphonage {{occurs when}} <b>higher</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>fluids,</b> gases, or {{suspended}} solids move {{to an area}} of lower <b>pressure</b> <b>fluids.</b> For example, when a drinking straw is used to consume a beverage, suction reduces the <b>pressure</b> of <b>fluid</b> inside the straw, causing liquid {{to move from the}} cup to inside the straw and then into the drinker's mouth. This is an example of an indirect cross-connection, undesirable material being pulled into the system.|$|R

In 1970, Saab Automobile introduced headlight wipers across their product range. These operated on a horizontal reciprocating mechanism, with a single motor. They were later superseded by a radial spindle action wiper mechanism, with individual motors on each headlamp. In 1972, headlamp cleaning systems became mandatory in Sweden.|$|E
5000|$|Power {{consumption}} and supply {{requirements of the}} solenoid vary with application, being primarily determined by fluid pressure and line diameter. For example, a popular 3/4" [...] 150 psi sprinkler valve, intended for 24 VAC (50 - 60 Hz) residential systems, has a momentary inrush of 7.2 VA, and a holding power requirement of 4.6 VA. Comparatively, an industrial 1/2" [...] 10000 psi valve, intended for 12, 24, or 120 VAC systems in <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>fluid</b> and cryogenic applications, has an inrush of 300 VA and a holding power of 22 VA.

But there is little systematic theoretical investigation of this view. This essay adopts spherical coordinate model to calculate the temperature and stress distribution in the film and analyzes the local stress redistribution after phase transformation or crush happens. The influences of porosity and pore radius on stress redistribution have been studied. The results show that: for the case of only local crush occurrence, the changes of porosity and pore radius have little influence on the stress relief effect For the films with low porosity, the formed thermal stress cannot be alleviated effectively. When local phase transformation happens, the permeation action of <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>fluid</b> can reduce the local high pressure in the phase transformation zone: on the other hand, it can make the <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>fluid</b> permeate to film's surface and cause surface tensile stress increase.

40|$|In China, {{electric}} vehicles (EVs) are becoming increasing popular. With several years practical operation experiences, {{a lot of}} news reports reveal the existing electrical supplementary heating can dramatically impact the driving range of EVs under cold weather in north China. The high efficient electric heat pump system has become the research hotspot, but previous research show the heat pump operation could supply adequate heating capacity only in mild weather conditions when the working fluid is R 134 a. Since the user canâ€™t change environment temperature, choose a <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> working <b>fluid</b> to have better heating performance become a realistic choice.

A loss of the high accuracy of hydroformed parts is disadvantageous especially by shape distortion during thermal joining. One solution is the integration of the joining operation into the hydroforming-process. A new integration method is a combination of hydroforming and spot-joining.

30|$|The aseismic {{parts of}} shear systems at mid-to deep crustal levels can localise {{the supply of}} deeply-sourced, <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>fluids</b> into the {{shallower}} level parts of these systems in the seismogenic regime. Even during deformation at elevated temperatures in mid-to deep crustal shear zones, high pore fluid factors promote grain-scale to macroscopic fracture growth and permeability enhancement. The evolution of permeability is governed by dynamic competition between crack growth and crack sealing/healing processes. Steady state creep below the seismic-aseismic transition leads to steady state permeability and continuous fluid flow. In contrast, within and near {{the base of the}} seismogenic regime, large cyclic changes in permeability can lead to episodic fluid flow and fluctuations in <b>fluid</b> <b>pressure.</b> At mid-crustal depths, temporal and spatial variations in pore <b>fluid</b> <b>pressure</b> and shear stress within shear networks influence rupture nucleation via cyclic changes in shear strength. <b>Fluid</b> <b>pressure</b> and shear stress cycling can also drive repeated transitions between interseismic creep and rapid, co-seismic slip. Reaction-weakening and reaction-strengthening, during hydrothermal alteration in fluid-active shear systems, can also drive transitions between seismic and aseismic behaviour on longer time-scales.|$|R
50|$|Finally, another {{widespread}} {{application of}} subcooling is boosting and economising. Inversely to superheating, subcooling, or {{the amount of}} heat withdrawn from the liquid refrigerant on the subcooling process, manifests itself as an increase on the refrigeration capacity of the system. This means that any extra heat removal after the condensation (subcooling) allows a higher ratio of heat absorption on further stages of the cycle. It is to be noted that superheating has exactly the inverse effect, and that an internal heat exchanger alone, {{is not able to}} increase the capacity of the system because the boosting effect of subcooling is dimmed by the superheating, making the net capacity gain equal to zero. Nevertheless, some systems are able to move refrigerant and/or to remove heat using up less energy because they do so on <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>fluids</b> that later cool or subcool lower pressure (which are more difficult to cool) fluids.|$|R
