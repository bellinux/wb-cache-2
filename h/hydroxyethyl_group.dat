40|$|Background: The {{first line}} of defense by {{bacteria}} against b-lactam antibiotics is the expression of b-lactamases, which cleave the amide bond of the b-lactam ring. In the reaction of biapenem inactivation by B 2 metallo b-lactamases (MbLs), after the b-lactam ring is opened, the carboxyl group generated by the hydrolytic process and the <b>hydroxyethyl</b> <b>group</b> (common to all carbapenems) rotate around the C 5 –C 6 bond, assuming a new position that allows a proton transfer from the <b>hydroxyethyl</b> <b>group</b> to C 2, and a nucleophilic attack on C 3 by the oxygen atom of the same side-chain. This process leads to the formation of a bicyclic compound, as originally observed in the X-ray structure of the metallo b-lactamase CphA in complex with product. Methodology/Principal Findings: QM/MM and metadynamics simulations of the post-hydrolysis steps in solution and in the enzyme reveal that while the rotation of the <b>hydroxyethyl</b> <b>group</b> can occur in solution or in the enzyme active site, formation of the bicyclic compound occurs primarily in solution, after which the final product binds back to the enzyme. The calculations also suggest that the rotation and cyclization steps can occur at a rate comparable to that observed experimentally for the enzymatic inactivation of biapenem only if the hydrolysis reaction leaves the N 4 nitrogen of the b-lactam ring unprotonated.

Isothermal titration calorimetry indicated that binding of the ligands to calf thymus DNA (5 mM Tris buffer, 50 mM NaCl, pH 7. 2, 25 degrees C) is exothermic. The binding constants increased from 1. 5 x 10 (4) to 1. 7 x 10 (6) M- 1 {{as a function}} of {{increase in the number of}} hydroxyethyl functions (0 - 4). DNA binding was accompanied by red-shifted absorption (similar to 630 cm(- 1)), strong hypochromism (> 65 %), positive induced-circular dichroism bands, and negative linear dichroism signals. DNA binding, in general, increased the helix stabilities to a significant extent (Delta T-m approximate to 7 degrees C, Delta Delta H approximate to 3 kcal/mol, Delta Delta S approximate to 6 - 20 cal/K center dot mol). The binding constants showed a strong correlation with the number of <b>hydroxyethyl</b> <b>groups</b> present on the anthracene ring system.

In this work, mono and dicationic cholinium ionic liquids {{as well as}} cholinium derivatives were synthesized and their toxicity assessed using the luminescent bacteria Vibrio fischeri. A range of cholinium derivatives was synthesized, using different amines and the correspondent brominated derivatives, through the alkylation of the amine with the halide in MeCN. The results indicate that their toxicity is highly dependent on the structural modifications of the cholinium cation, mainly related to the alkyl side or linkage chain length, number of <b>hydroxyethyl</b> <b>groups</b> and insertion of carbon-carbon multiple bonds. The data indicated {{that it is possible}} to perform environmentally advantageous structural alterations, namely the addition of double bonds, which would not negatively affect V. fischeri. Moreover, the dicationic compounds revealed a significantly lower toxicity than the monocationic counterparts.

International audienceHydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC) with low molar substitution has better solubility in 8 %NaOH-water solution than pure cellulose. The thermal behavior of ternary HEC/NaOH/water mixtures was investigated by DSC, {{and the results are}} compared with those of cellulose/NaOH/water solutions, aiming at providing better understanding about cellulose dissolution mechanism in NaOH-water. At low polymer concentrations and below 0 °C, HEC and cellulose solutions exhibit a similar thermal behavior with ice, eutectic and/or melting and recrystallization peaks, showing that the overall interactions between NaOH, water and cellulose or HEC are identical. However, when the concentration increases above 2 %, the eutectic peak of HEC solutions disappeared, leaving only the ice peak, which is different from previous results for cellulose where the disappearance of the eutectic peak was related to the maximum solubility of cellulose (around 8 wt%). This implies that the dissolution behavior of HEC in NaOH solution is changed due to possible changes of chain flexibility and/or increased attractions to water caused by the hydrophilic <b>hydroxyethyl</b> <b>groups.</b> The melting and recrystallization peaks visible only at low concentrations of HEC or cellulose in solution also support the conclusion that dissolution of cellulose and HEC at low concentrations bears features which are not yet understood...|$|R

By using solely a SEC guard column as an analytical column allowed sufficient chromatographic resolution in a minimal amount of time and with reasonable repeatability (average RSD of 10 %).

40|$|In the {{framework}} of this study, {{a broad range of}} permodified ?- and -cyclodextrins with appended carboxylic functions was prepared. Several alternative synthetic procedures were demonstrated. Oxidation of primary hydroxylic groups of per- 2, 3 -protected cyclodextrins with TEMPO gave good to high yields of the corresponding per-carboxylic (uronic) acids. Direct oxidation of native CDs was found to proceed with insufficient selectivity. Dipolar cycloaddition of per(6 -azido- 6 -deoxy) -cyclodextrins on dimethyl acetylene-dicarboxylate was used to attach twelve or fourteen cyrboxylic functions onto the primary rim through triazolyl rings. Carboxymethylation was found to be the most versatile route to cyclodextrins regioselectively persubstituted with carboxylic groups on either of the rims. Two alternative procedures were developed. Primary hydroxyls of per(2, 3 -di-O-methyl) -cyclodextrins were simply carboxymethylated using ethyl diazoacetate under catalysis of anhydrous HBF 4. More polar peralkyl-CD derivatives and native -CD were carboxymethylated by (i) allylation of the desired positions, (ii) alkylation of the remaining positions, (iii) dihydroxylation of the double bond (OsO 4) followed by cleavage of the diol (NaIO 4) and reduction of the peraldehyde (NaBH 4) performed as "one pot" reaction, and (iv) oxidation (TEMPO) ot the <b>hydroxyethyl</b> <b>groups</b> to carboxymethyl functions. This procedure permits preparation of per- 2, 3, 6 -, per- 2, 6 - and per- 2, 3 -carboxymethylated -CDs in good overall yields. Self-assembling properties of a few-selected per-acids and their complexes with isosteric peramines were investigated. Vapour pressure osmometry was found to be the most useful method for the determination of the average molecular weight of discrete aggregates. The amphiphilic per(6 -O-carboxymethyl- 2, 3 -di-O-methyl) -cyclodextrins and per(5 -carboxy- 5 -dehydroxymethyl- 2, 3 -di-O-methyl) -cyclodextrins were found to form stable dimers in 1, 2 -dichloroethane or chloroform solutions {{in a wide range of}} concentrations. Structure of the complexes of these percarboxylic acids with complementary peramines depended markedly on the nature of the solvent.
