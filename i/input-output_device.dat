50|$|The Four-Phase Systems AL1 was an 8-bit {{bit slice}} chip {{containing}} eight registers and an ALU. It {{was designed by}} Lee Boysel in 1969. At the time, it formed part of a nine-chip, 24-bit CPU with three AL1s, but it was later called a microprocessor when, in response to 1990s litigation by Texas Instruments, a demonstration system was constructed where a single AL1 formed part of a courtroom demonstration computer system, together with RAM, ROM, and an <b>input-output</b> <b>device.</b>|$|E

50|$|A minicomputer, or colloquially mini, is a {{class of}} smaller {{computers}} that {{was developed in the}} mid-1960s and sold for much less than mainframe and mid-size computers from IBM and its direct competitors. In a 1970 survey, the New York Times suggested a consensus definition of a minicomputer as a machine costing less than , with an <b>input-output</b> <b>device</b> such as a teleprinter and at least four thousand words of memory, that is capable of running programs in a higher level language, such as Fortran or BASIC. The class formed a distinct group with its own software architectures and operating systems. Minis were designed for control, instrumentation, human interaction, and communication switching as distinct from calculation and record keeping. Many were sold indirectly to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) for final end use application. During the two decade lifetime of the minicomputer class (1965-1985), almost 100 companies formed and only a half dozen remained.|$|E

40|$|The {{process of}} {{locating}} the minimum of a nonlinear function is highly experimental in nature since {{the determination of}} an acceptable solution may require many trials involving technique and parameter changes. If this problem is handled in a batch computing environment, the user is obliged to accept significant delays between minimization experiments. This difficulty can be overcome {{through the use of}} an interactive approach. The work described in this thesis is concerned with the development of a software package, called INTEROPT, which applies interactive/graphics techniques to the solution of nonlinear minimization problems. INTEROPT is designed for use on the IBM 360 / 65 computer operated by the Computing Center of the University of Ottawa.

40|$|Part Two In {{the last}} chapter, I claimed that {{behavior}} is the functional {{form of an}} animal's behavior.

50|$|Bank {{switching}} {{originated in}} minicomputer systems. Many modern microcontrollers and microprocessors use bank switching to manage random-access memory, non-volatile memory, <b>input-output</b> <b>devices</b> and system management registers in small embedded systems. The technique was common in 8-bit microcomputer systems. Bank-switching {{may also be}} used to work around limitations in address bus width, where some hardware constraint prevents straightforward addition of more address lines. Some control-oriented microprocessors use a bank-switching technique to access internal I/O and control registers, which limits the number of register address bits that must be used in every instruction.|$|R

Appropriate versions of traced monoidal properties are verified for feedback, and a normal form theorem for expressions of processes is proved.

Using the JCSP implementation of active AWT components as a model, we have constructed an active serial port (ASP), using javax. comm, that gives a channel interface that is more easily incorporated into a distributed JCSP. net collection of processes. The ASP has been tested in a real-time embedded system used to collect data from infrared detectors used to monitor the movement of pedestrians.
