5|$|Zakuani {{was born}} in Kinshasa, Zaire—now the Democratic Republic of the Congo. When he was four, his father, Mao Zakuani, moved his family to London for {{political}} and professional reasons after receiving a job offer as a translator. The family switched homes often and lived with extended family for long periods. They later settled in a north London neighborhood with other African <b>families,</b> <b>where</b> Zakuani attended White Hart Lane School.|$|E
5|$|The {{individual}} {{regions of}} the North have had their own identities and cultures for centuries, but with industrialisation, mass media {{and the opening of}} the North–South divide, a common Northern identity began to develop. This identity was initially a reactionary response to Southern prejudices – the North of the nineteenth century was largely depicted as a dirty, wild and uncultured place, even in sympathetic depictions such as Elizabeth Gaskell's 1855 novel North and South – but became an affirmation of what Northerners saw as their own personal strengths. Traits stereotypically associated with Northern England are straight-talking, grit and warmheartedness, as compared to the supposedly effete Southerners. Northern England – especially Lancashire, but also Yorkshire and the North East – has a tradition of matriarchal <b>families,</b> <b>where</b> the woman of the house runs the home and controls the family's finances. This too has its roots in industrialisation, when mills offered well-paid work for women: during depressions when demand for coal and steel were low, women were often the main breadwinners. Northern women are still stereotyped as strong-willed and independent, or affectionately as battle-axes.|$|E

50|$|Harris {{was born}} in Barnsley in Yorkshire, to an English father and a French mother. Her parents were both academics, {{teaching}} modern languages and literature at a local grammar school. Her first language was French which caused divisions between her English <b>family,</b> <b>where</b> no-one spoke French, and her French <b>family,</b> <b>where</b> no-one spoke English. Both families had turbulent histories and a tradition of strong women, kitchen gardening, storytelling, folklore and cookery.|$|R
25|$|The inverse {{relationship}} between consonant gradation and medial lenition of stops (the pattern also continuing within the three <b>families</b> <b>where</b> gradation is found) is noted by Helimski (1995): an original allophonic gradation system between voiceless and voiced stops would have been easily disrupted by a spreading of voicing to previously unvoiced stops as well.|$|E
25|$|Physical {{dormancy}} or {{hard seed}} coats occurs when seeds are impermeable to water. At dormancy break, a specialized structure, the ‘water gap’, is disrupted {{in response to}} environmental cues, especially temperature, so water can enter the seed and germination can occur. Plant <b>families</b> <b>where</b> physical dormancy occurs include Anacardiaceae, Cannaceae, Convulvulaceae, Fabaceae and Malvaceae.|$|E
25|$|The first pre-schools were {{established}} in the 1820s by a private initiative intended to instruct the children of working <b>families,</b> <b>where</b> both parents worked outside the home. During the period between 1850 and 1900, private educational institutions appeared that were open only on a part-time basis. These institutions had pedagogical objectives unlike those of the previous schools that were mostly mere retention centres for children of working parents, and were aimed at {{the children of the}} more privileged classes.|$|E

25|$|The arson was {{reported}} to have affected about 3,000 shops and the livelihoods of almost 10,000 people. Total loss incurred was Rs 30 billion in total. The markets that fell victim to the arson attacks included the Bolton, Light House, Paper, and Allahwala markets. Later reports speculated that the loss estimated exceeded to a staggering 4,000 shops and 40,000 effected <b>families.</b> <b>Where</b> eyewitnesses stated that the police and Rangers did not take action against the arsonists and robbers, some people talk of the arson as an elaborate conspiracy.|$|E
25|$|In {{morphological}} dormancy, germination is prevented due to morphological {{characteristics of}} the embryo. In some species, the embryo is just a mass of cells when seeds are dispersed; it is not differentiated. Before germination can take place, both differentiation and growth of the embryo have to occur. In other species, the embryo is differentiated but not fully grown (underdeveloped) at dispersal, and embryo growth up to a species specific length is required before germination can occur. Examples of plant <b>families</b> <b>where</b> morphological dormancy occurs are Apiaceae, Cycadaceae, Liliaceae, Magnoliaceae and Ranunculaceae.|$|E
25|$|In summary, {{the article}} 'A Quick Look at Lesbians by Dilys Rowe' (Winter 1962–1963) {{was based on}} an {{interview}} with three self-confessed 'homosexual women' and a female doctor who specialised in marriage guidance. The article focused on the largely invisible lives of lesbians in society at the time and their relationships with their mother and father. It proposed that lesbians reported growing up in <b>families</b> <b>where</b> they had a weak father and a dominant mother and that they had failed to emotionally bond with their fathers during their formative years.|$|E

25|$|In many {{immigrant}} families, {{members of}} the younger generation have greater English language proficiency than their elders. In <b>families</b> <b>where</b> parents may know little to no English, children may act as interpreters. Young children may therefore be involved in important family matters, including finances. In cases where children are in charge of paying bills, they may {{be in a position to}} take a portion of their parents' money for their own use. Even when this is not the case, the role of interpreter gives a particular family member a certain measure of control over other family members who are unable to communicate as well in English.|$|E
25|$|When the {{population}} settled down the society greatly changed, first coexisting {{with the older}} societies, later absorbing them. Trade became much more important, a political institution elected by the people came into existence, the very same institution whose successor is the current County Council. Jämtland got its name and a somewhat hierarchical social structure emerged, though, as already pointed out, Jämtland never had an upper class. Strong families such as Skanke and Blix did exist though and on the countryside in Jämtland people still live in networks of relatives, <b>families.</b> <b>Where</b> they provide a second social security for many, {{in the rest of}} Sweden and in e.g. Östersund this has completely or almost entirely been replaced by public welfare.|$|E
25|$|U.S. {{immigration}} policies shape {{the opportunities for}} 16.6 million mixed immigrant families. The experiences of mixed immigrant status families {{need to be in}} sharper focus, especially the effects on children growing up in these families. There are an estimated 5.5 million children with unauthorized immigrant parents, about three-quarters of whom are U.S. born citizens. The nature of immigration policy dehumanizes individuals in mixed status families through practices that threat and harm, such as deportation procedures, which is when a migrant is formally removed from the United States and is banned from reentering. Immigration policies and practices do not only affect the undocumented population itself. However, U.S. born children growing up in <b>families</b> <b>where</b> there are undocumented members living are negatively impacted by these policies.|$|E

25|$|The Carlisle Summer Outing Program {{arranged}} {{for students to}} work in homes as domestic servants or in farms or businesses during the summer. The program won praise from reformers and administrators alike and helped increase the public's faith that Indians could be educated and assimilated. The program gave students opportunities to interact {{and live in the}} white world and found jobs for students during the summer months with middle-class farm <b>families</b> <b>where</b> they earned their first wages. Many students worked in the homes and farms of Quaker families in eastern Pennsylvania and surrounding states. Some were sent to farms in the Pennsylvania Dutch Country of Dauphin, Lancaster, and Lebanon counties and acquired what would be a lifelong Pennsylvania Dutch accent.|$|E
25|$|Polish {{immigrants}} {{were attracted to}} saloons – drinking was a popular social activity. Saloons allowed Poles to relieve their stresses from difficult physical labor, the selling of steamship tickets, and meeting grounds for mutual aid societies and political groups. Among Polish immigrants, a saloon-keeper was a favorite entrepreneurship opportunity, second only to a grocery store owner. By 1920, when alcohol was prohibited in the United States, American Poles continued to drink and run bootlegging operations. Contemporary Polish language newspapers decried a pervasive alcoholism among Polish American <b>families,</b> <b>where</b> mothers would brew liquor and beer at home for their husbands (and sometimes children). Although small in both numbers and scope, Poles joined organized crime and mafia-related distribution networks of alcohol in the U.S.|$|E
25|$|The slayings were a major blow to {{the efforts}} of the {{breakaway}} republic to gain international recognition of its declaration of independence. Kidnappings had become common in Chechnya, procuring over $200 million during the three year independence, particularly {{since the end of the}} First Chechen War in 1996, as the ruined region's fledging separatist government failed to maintain law and order, with some of the kidnapped people being sold into indentured servitude to Chechen <b>families,</b> <b>where</b> they were regarded as slaves and had to endure starvation, beating, and often maiming. Since the industries of hostage-taking and slavery flourished in the inter-war years, most foreign nationals left the region by early 1998. Prior to the murder of the engineers of Granger Telecom, six foreign ICRC delegates were assassinated on 17 December 1996. A seventh delegate, also a foreigner, was wounded and left for dead.|$|E
