50|$|Aquatic {{reptiles}} such as {{sea turtles}} predominantly use their pectoral flippers to propulse {{through the water}} and their pelvic flippers for maneuvering. During swimming they move their pectoral flippers in a clapping motion underneath their body and pull them back up into an airplane position, causing forward motion. During the swimming motion <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>important</b> that they rotate their front flipper in order to decrease drag through the water column and increase their efficiency. Sea turtles exhibit a natural suite of behavior skills that help them direct themselves towards the ocean as well as identify the transition from sand to water after hatching. If rotated in the pitch, yaw or roll direction the hatchlings are capable of counteracting the forces acting upon them by correcting with either their pectoral or pelvic flippers and redirecting themselves towards the open ocean.|$|E

50|$|He {{was made}} artistic {{director}} of the Drottningholm Palace Theatre in 1980 and remained in that role until 1992. He gained an international reputation as a champion of the period performance movement in classical music, a movement that insists on the performance of repertoire from c. 1600 to 1820 (i.e., baroque, classical, and early romantic) using instruments (or modern replicas), techniques, and stylistic sensibilities from the appropriate period. In particular, Drottningholm's productions of Mozart operas with period instruments caused a considerable stir {{in the early days of}} the historical-performance movement. To Östman, use of historically appropriate instruments is vital to developing an understanding of the Mozartian style:It's so important to use classical instruments. We make mistakes with them, but we keep trying because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>important</b> complementary information, which has a scientific value. Yet we don't use it as Scientists, we use it for artistic freedom. The more information you have, the more freedom you have.|$|E

I will tell you {{who he is and}} why he is great.... Archie's series 'Sixty Paintings from the Bible' (1992)... takes scenes from the Bible, illustrates them with Classical compositions, expressionist, almost cartoony lines, and bold pastel colors. The images contain speech bubbles that convey what the Biblical characters really said.... To Archie this playful synthesis of cartoon and Biblical stories....by creating a patchwork of different styles, the Bible works... provides a 'way of compensating for the inability of English to get at the Hebrew text' all in cartoon bubble form.... If you are up to the challenge of really trying to bridge the experiential Judaism with an aesthetic vision, then Archie Rand is the most perfect guide I know.|$|E

50|$|The fractal {{approach}} to soil mechanics {{is a new}} line of thought. There are several problems in soil mechanics which can be dealt by applying a fractal approach. One of these problems is the determination of soil-water-characteristic curve (also called (water retention curve) and/or capillary pressure curve). It is a time-consuming process considering usual laboratory experiments. Many scientists have been involved in making mathematical models of soil-water-characteristic curve (SWCC) in which constants are related to the fractal dimension of pore size distribution or particle size distribution of the soil. After the great mathematician Benoît Mandelbrot—father of fractal mathematics—showed the world fractals, Scientists of Agronomy, Agricultural engineering and Earth Scientists have developed more fractal-based models. It is noteworthy that all of these models have been used to extract hydraulic properties of soils and the potential capabilities of fractal mathematics to investigate mechanical properties of soils. Therefore, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>important</b> to use such physically based models to promote our understanding of the mechanics of the soils. It can be of great help for researchers in the area of unsaturated soil mechanics. Mechanical parameters can alsso be driven from such models and of course it needs further works and researches.|$|E
50|$|Price {{management}} and price psychology is related {{from one to}} another. Companies often transform from a freelancer that sells into large company with multibillion-dollar contract at stake, which this relates to price anxiety or on the other hand, price confidence. For example, when buyer knows that the seller will win a deal in any cost, the seller will get it at any cost, meaning, the price will go down. Thus, in another way, {{the moment when the}} seller fears a price negotiation {{and on the other side}} there is an experienced buyer, the price will go down. This is often said that fear is the most expensive feeling in a company. Additionally, it is often to be seen that companies, salespersons, entrepreneurs or freelancers are anxious to lose a deal when customer just takes the price down. Pricing confidence is an essential organizational characteristic which allows teams to sell the product confidently and believing in the price worthy value of a product (Liozu et al., 2011). Therefore, it is important that companies build up pricing confidence in a team, showing the team a better insight, creating more value on the product, and the product is worth the price. Furthermore, this leads to price confidence that leads from the confidence a seller has in the product they are selling. However, when the seller is not confident about the price or product they are selling, help from others to access your product that has the value for the price is possible as well, and this leads to commodization. Commodization happens when the product a seller offer is as good or as bad as the competitor is offering, where it proves that the seller has no right to sell the product in a higher price. However, customer to drive down the price of a product during a negotiation often uses commodization. Thus, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>important</b> to convince buyers that the seller is not selling commodity when you understand the value and the price the product is worth for.|$|E
