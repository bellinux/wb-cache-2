5|$|In October 2010 the British Library {{launched}} its Management and business studies portal. This website is <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> digital access to management research reports, consulting reports, working papers and articles.|$|E
5|$|Lone Scouting is {{a program}} <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> those who would {{otherwise}} {{not be able to}} become Boy Scouts or Cub Scouts—usually due to residence in an overseas, isolated, or unsafe community—to participate in the Scouting experience.|$|E
5|$|The {{upper level}} relay tracks east of 179th Street on the IND Queens Boulevard Line were {{intended}} to continue toward Floral Park, and the tunnel is <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> for such a future extension.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Figure 5. Photograph on an IsaMill {{with the}} split-shell <b>design</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> easier {{replacement}} of the shell liner.|$|R
50|$|Modular <b>design</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> for the {{attachment}} of standard interfaces for mission payloads (for example electric megaphone and/or siren/dazzler/tear-gas generator/searchlight sub-systems).|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} {{possible}} <b>designs</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> the foot stretcher (with flywheel) and handle to move relatively nearer {{and apart from}} each other.|$|R
5|$|A new weekday {{schedule}} <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> {{time for}} construction became effective on April 10, 2017. The weekend schedule was revised on July 15, 2017, which decreased frequency from 60 minutes to 90 minutes between trains and eliminated eight trains per weekend day. The revised schedules are anticipated {{to be in}} effect until 2020, when construction associated with PCEP has completed.|$|E
5|$|ABC and Nielsen partnered in 2011 {{to create}} a Grey Anatomy {{application}} for Apple's iPad. The application was <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> viewers to participate in polls and learn trivial facts as they watch a live episode. It uses Nielsen's Media-Sync software to listen for the episode and to post features as the episode progresses.|$|E
5|$|Elemental abundances in the {{photosphere}} {{are well}} known from spectroscopic studies, but {{the composition of the}} interior of the Sun is more poorly understood. A solar wind sample return mission, Genesis, was <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> astronomers to directly measure the composition of solar material.|$|E
50|$|Panasonic Corporation in 2009 {{developed}} a consumer induction cooker {{that uses a}} higher-frequency magnetic field, and a different oscillator circuit <b>design,</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> use with non-ferrous metals.|$|R
50|$|At first, {{stations}} were designed without the mezzanine floor. However, these were added <b>to</b> the final <b>design</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> street crossing {{and the use}} of gates to collect tickets.|$|R
50|$|A dual-voltage CPU uses a split-rail <b>design</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> lower {{voltages}} <b>to</b> {{be used in}} {{the processor}} core while the external Input/Output (I/O) voltages remain 3.3 volts for backwards compatibility.|$|R
5|$|The 1930s {{improvements}} {{included the}} construction of the Prescott Channel, <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> flood water to bypass the Three Mills tide mills. The channel included sluices to regulate water levels above it, but these became redundant once the tide mills ceased to operate, and eventually seized up. They were removed soon after parts of the Channelsea River were culverted.|$|E
5|$|The Peace Plaza is the {{backdrop}} for the museum. The plaza was <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> 50 thousand people to gather around the peace monument in the centre. Tange also designed the monument as an arch composed of two hyperbolic paraboloids, said {{to be based on}} traditional Japanese ceremonial tombs from the Kofun Period.|$|E
5|$|The Portway Park and Ride is in Shirehampton {{near the}} M5 junction. A bus lane on the inbound {{section of the}} road from Sea Mills is <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> quicker access for buses to the city centre. As well as Shirehampton and Sea Mills, there have been {{proposals}} {{to build a new}} station at the Park and Ride.|$|E
25|$|Kenworthy {{modified}} the <b>design</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> fitting {{of a more}} powerful (140hp (104kW)) two-row Gnome engine, which was built as the B.E.7, flying {{for the first time}} on 28 February 1913.|$|R
5000|$|The Kohte [...] is {{the typical}} tent of German Scouting and the German Youth Movement. It has several unusual features, {{including}} its distinctive black colour and its <b>design</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> a central fire.|$|R
5000|$|The design {{includes}} an amphibian fence about 40 cm in height with an adjacent rock aggregate to suppress vegetation. [...] A small fauna underpass was also {{incorporated into the}} <b>design</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> for {{the movement of the}} wallum sedge frog.|$|R
5|$|While {{connector}} interfaces can be <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> plugging {{with either}} orientation, {{the original design}} omitted such functionality to decrease manufacturing costs. The reversible type-C plug is an addition to the USB3.1 specification comparable in size to the Micro-B SuperSpeed connector.|$|E
5|$|William F. Wayman {{designed}} the structure with Victor Batchelar building the home, while Charles F. Walters {{designed the}} grounds. All the wood was logged by Richard Rice, {{who made his}} living as a logging contractor. He also milled the wood. The home was <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> the basement {{to serve as a}} museum for the Rices' collections.|$|E
5|$|Another {{feature of}} the ball is its rubber layer; it was <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> a better {{response}} while retaining the impact energy and releases it in the coup. Its support material of cross-linked nitrogen-expanded foam improves its retention and durability of its shape. Polyester support fabric enhances structure and stability. The asymmetrical high-contrast graphic around the ball creates an optimal flicker as the ball rotates for a more powerful visual signal, allowing the player to more easily identify and track the ball.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{developments}} in the Cell design for SX–EW applications include large, flat-bottomed cell <b>design</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> it <b>to</b> sit {{on the ground and}} large (500mm diameter) downcomers that can have multiple liquor (there being no slurry in SX–EW applications) lenses fitted to each downcomer.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} {{road junction}} types are <b>designed</b> specifically <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> U-turns.|$|R
50|$|The first {{flotation}} type applicator {{produced by}} Ag-Chem was the Ag-Gator 804. This model {{was also the}} first <b>design</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> the operator <b>to</b> apply either a liquid or a dry product. This model featured front wheel drive and an optional 150HP gasoline powered or 155HP diesel power plant.|$|R
5|$|By 1886 {{the four}} threequarter system had spread {{throughout}} Wales. First instituted by Cardiff RFC in 1884, {{the system was}} <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> Cardiff centres Frank Hancock and Tom Williams {{to play at the}} same time, and involved dropping the ninth forward to include a second centre. Newport were reluctant to adopt this style of play, mainly due to Gould's excellent kicking and covering abilities, which allowed the club to continue with the advantage of the extra forward.|$|E
5|$|Consumer Electronics Control (CEC) is an HDMI feature <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> {{the user}} to command and control up to 15 CEC-enabled devices, that are {{connected}} through HDMI, by using only one of their remote controls (for example by controlling a television set, set-top box, and DVD player using only the remote control of the TV). CEC also allows for individual CEC-enabled devices to command and control each other without user intervention.|$|E
5|$|Initially unplanned, The Missing Link was {{developed}} by Human Revolutions core staff, including producer David Anfossi, director Jean-François Dugas, writer Mary DeMarle, and composer Michael McCann. The story {{was designed as a}} standalone experience, partially due to the technical and aesthetic improvements the team had made. A boss battle was <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> for multiple solutions, in contrast to the limited action-based approaches of the main game's boss fights. Reception was generally positive: despite some mixed opinions on the story, praise was given to the improved visuals and gameplay.|$|E
2500|$|Last 11 {{production}} F 1s {{were built}} as FB 1s plus an additional aircraft ordered on 27 March 1951 to replace one aircraft destroyed on a production test flight. The FB1 had been modified {{from the original}} <b>design</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> it <b>to</b> carry rocket projectiles or bombs under the wings.|$|R
5000|$|Artificial turf. The {{artificial}} turf {{at the stadium}} has permanent markings for soccer, field hockey, and lacrosse. A complex drainage system is incorporated into the <b>design</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> for play in all weather conditions. The [...] "24/7" [...] artificial field surface is named Joseph P. and Janet A. Clayton Field.|$|R

5|$|Philadelphians {{saw three}} ballot {{questions}} in the primary election, all of which involved allowing the city to borrow money. The loans, on the ballot at Clark's urging, were <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> the city to temporarily increase spending without raising taxes, and were opposed by many ward leaders in both parties. As a result, they went down to unexpected defeat by a 3:2 margin. Undeterred, Clark and his allies revised and relisted the loans for {{a vote in the}} general election in November, which would see better turnout and, they believed, a better chance of success.|$|E
5|$|The Pipeline Authorization Act {{required}} the pipeline {{to be able}} to withstand the maximum earthquake ever recorded in the area it was built. When crossing the Denali Fault, Teflon-coated sliders were <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> the pipeline to move side-to-side in an earthquake. To protect against forward-and-backward shocks and to allow for thermal expansion, the pipeline wasn't designed as a straight line. Instead, it was intended to be laid in an S-shape, and the bends would allow for expansion and movement without breaking.|$|E
5|$|At this point, Grant began {{describing}} {{himself as}} the O.H.O. (Outer Head of the Order) of the O.T.O., claiming that he deserved this title not by direct succession from Crowley but because he displayed the inspiration and innovation that Germer lacked. A document purportedly by Crowley naming Grant as his successor was subsequently exposed as a hoax created by Robert Taylor, a Typhonian O.T.O. member. In the early 1970s he established his own Thelemic organisation, the Typhonian O.T.O., which produced its first official announcement in 1973. Although adopting the O.T.O. degree system used by Crowley, Grant removed the rituals of initiation <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> a member to enter a higher degree; instead he personally promoted them through the degrees according to what he believed were their own personal spiritual development.|$|E
50|$|Concrete {{continues}} to be the preferred method for capping vertical shafts. Considerations can be made in the <b>design</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> for an entrance to the mine, a steel door for humans, a slot for bats, a hole for airflow. The slabs thickness can vary from as little as 6 inches to several feet.|$|R
50|$|The {{conventional}} {{piston engine}} drove both a small propeller (to provide airflow across a rudder) and an air compressor to provide air (subsequently mixed with fuel) through the rotor head and hollow rotor blades to combustion chambers at the rotor tips. As a research helicopter {{it was a}} simple <b>design</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> modification.|$|R
40|$|In this {{research}} we undertake {{the necessity to}} motivate the students of sociocultural studies career from the University of San Cristobal participation in the universitary expansion, besides an strategy was <b>design</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> the bond between student and expansion activities developed in the University making them main characters of every action developed in this institution...|$|R
