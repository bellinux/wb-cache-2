The cost management level of enterprise determines its ability to obtain economic benefits. The responsibility cost management mode that involves everyone participation could enhance management level of enterprises. To eliminate internal <b>information</b> <b>island</b> and information asymmetry, information should communicate between each cost management department. The responsibility cost management model of internal information circulation covers the whole process of project, the cost of project could be reflected timely and accurately, the sufficient information could provide support for every manager decision, then the effectiveness and overall level of responsibility cost management could be enhanced. Thus, with the help of information system, construction enterprise could form a scientific and standardized management model...|$|E

In this study we adopt Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) to the core-banking system using foreign exchange import business as example and focusing on the SOA solution for {{the integration of the}} L/C (letter of credit) business process. The Service-Oriented Modeling and Architecture (SOMA) approach is used to analyze the issuing business process of the import L/C. The web services in the process are identified and then realized that enable reusability of the existing services through the exercise of service orchestration and composition. According to the established SOA layered architecture of the L/C management, we then implemented a new foreign exchange import system. With the features of service reusability and service composability, the system development time and costs are reduced and the integration can be easily achieved. The SOA solution of this study improves the use of our case bank's internal information system and the developed prototype should be able to serve as a reference for other banks...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} 40 years {{manufacturing}} industry {{has enjoyed a}} rapid growth {{with the support of}} various computer-aided systems (CAD, CAPP, CAM etc.) known as CAx. Since the first Numerically Controlled (NC) machine appeared in 1952, there have been many advances in CAx resource capabilities. The information integration and interoperability between different manufacturing resources has become an important and popular research area over the last decade. Computer Numerically Controlled (CNC) machines are an important link in the manufacturing chain and the major contributor to the production capacity of manufacturing industry today. However, most of the research has focused on the information integration of upper systems in the CAD/CAPP /CAM/CNC manufacturing chain, leaving the shop floor as an isolated <b>information</b> <b>island.</b> In particular, there is limited opportunity to capture and feed shopfloor knowledge back to the upper systems. Furthermore, the part programs for the machines are not exchangeable due to the. machine specific postprocessors. Thus there is a further need to consider information interoperability between different CNC machine and other systems. This research investigates the reverse transformation of the CNC part programmes into higher level of process information, entitled process comprehension, to enable the shopfloor interoperability. A novel framework of universal process comprehension is specified and designed. The framework provides a reverse direction of information flow from the CNC machine to upper CAx systems, enabling the interoperability and recycling of the shopfloor knowledge. A prototype implementation of the framework is realised and utilised to demonstrate the functionalities through three industrially inspired test components. The major contribution of this research to knowledge is the new vision of the shopfloor interoperability associated with process knowledge capture and reuse. The research shows that process comprehension of part programmes can provide an effective solution to the issues of the shopfloor interoperability and knowledge reuse in manufacturing industries.
