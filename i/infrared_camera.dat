5|$|An HDF {{counterpart}} {{in the southern}} celestial hemisphere was created in 1998: the HDF-South. Created using a similar observing strategy, the HDF-S was very similar in appearance to the original HDF. This supports the cosmological principle that at its largest scale the Universe is homogeneous. The HDF-S survey used the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) and the Near <b>Infrared</b> <b>Camera</b> and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS) instruments installed on the HST in 1997; the Hubble Deep Field has since been re-observed several times using WFPC2, {{as well as by}} the NICMOS and STIS instruments. Several supernova events were detected by comparing the first and second epoch observations of the HDF-N.|$|E
5|$|Servicing Mission 2, {{flown by}} Discovery in February 1997, {{replaced}} the GHRS and the FOS with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) and the Near <b>Infrared</b> <b>Camera</b> and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS), replaced an Engineering and Science Tape Recorder {{with a new}} Solid State Recorder, and repaired thermal insulation. NICMOS contained a heat sink of solid nitrogen to reduce the thermal noise from the instrument, but shortly after it was installed, an unexpected thermal expansion resulted in part of the heat sink coming into contact with an optical baffle. This led to an increased warming rate for the instrument and reduced its original expected lifetime of 4.5 years to about 2 years.|$|E

50|$|Some long-wave cameras require their {{detector}} to be cryogenically cooled, typically {{for several}} minutes before use, although some moderately sensitive <b>infrared</b> <b>cameras</b> do not require this.

50|$|<b>Infrared</b> or thermographic <b>cameras</b> {{are used}} to {{facilitate}} gestural detection. Unlike digital <b>cameras,</b> <b>infrared</b> <b>cameras</b> operate independent of light, instead relying on the heat signature of an object. This is beneficial because it allows for gesture detection in all lighting conditions. However, cameras are subject to occlusion by other objects that {{may result in a}} loss of gesture tracking. <b>Infrared</b> <b>cameras</b> are most common in three-dimensional implementations.|$|R

25|$|Gait {{analysis}} is {{the systematic study}} of animal locomotion, more specifically the study of human motion, using the eye and the brain of observers, augmented by instrumentation for measuring body movements, body mechanics, and {{the activity of the}} muscles.

25|$|On 18 May 2006, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) {{issued a}} {{certificate}} of authorization which will allow the M/RQ-1 and M/RQ-9 aircraft to be used within U.S. civilian airspace to search for survivors of disasters. Requests {{had been made in}} 2005 for the aircraft to be used in search and rescue operations following Hurricane Katrina, but because there was no FAA authorization in place at the time, the assets were not used. The Predator's <b>infrared</b> <b>camera</b> with digitally enhanced zoom has the capability of identifying the infrared signature of a human body from an altitude of 3km (10,000ft), making the aircraft an ideal search and rescue tool.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the start}} of excavations, {{beginning}} in the early months of 2004, Dr. Victor Manuel Velasco Herrera, from UNAM Institute of Geophysics, determined with the help of ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and a team of some 20 archaeologists and workers the approximate length of the tunnel and the presence of internal chambers. They scanned the earth under the Ciudadela, returning every afternoon to upload the results to Gómez’s computers. By 2005, the digital map was complete. The archaeologists explored the tunnel with a remote-controlled robot called Tlaloc II-TC, equipped with an <b>infrared</b> <b>camera</b> and a laser scanner that generates 3D visualization to perform three dimensional register of the spaces beneath the temple. A small opening in the tunnel wall was made and the scanner captured the first images, 37 meters into the passage.|$|E

500|$|The AGM-65 Maverick {{air-to-surface missile}} is a {{commonly}} used munition for the A-10, targeted via electro-optical (TV-guided) or infrared. The Maverick allows target engagement at much greater ranges than the cannon, and thus less risk from anti-aircraft systems. During Desert Storm, {{in the absence}} of dedicated forward-looking infrared (FLIR) cameras for night vision, the Maverick's <b>infrared</b> <b>camera</b> was used for night missions as a [...] "poor man's FLIR". Other weapons include cluster bombs and Hydra rocket pods. The A-10 is equipped to carry laser-guided bombs. [...] A-10s usually fly with an ALQ-131 ECM pod under one wing and two AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles under the other wing for self-defense.|$|E
500|$|While snorkelling, Bond meets Domino. Later, at a casino, he {{encounters}} Domino and Largo, who {{has taken}} Domino as his mistress. Bond enters a game against Largo and wins, and subsequently takes Domino to a dance. Bond and Largo recognise each other as adversaries and begin a tense cat-and-mouse game of attempting to gain advantage over each other while still pretending ignorance of their adversary's true nature. Bond meets Felix Leiter and Q, and is issued various gadgets, including an underwater <b>infrared</b> <b>camera,</b> a distress beacon, underwater breathing apparatus, a flare gun, and a Geiger counter. Diving under Largo's ship, the Disco Volante, Bond fails to find the atomic bomb, but detects an underwater hatch; Bond narrowly escapes Largo's henchmen. The next day, Bond visits Largo at his estate, Palmyra.|$|E
