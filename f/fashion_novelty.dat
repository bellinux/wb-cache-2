40|$|Abstract. Sensor nodes in {{large-scale}} sensor networks autonomously and proactively report diverse {{information obtained}} from extensive target area to a base station, which is energy unconstrained node. To efficiently handle the variable traffic, we present Co-MAC, an energy efficient {{medium access control}} protocol for large-scale sensor networks. In Co-MAC, an overall network is divided into independent subnets, and each subnet orthogonally operates on time line in a temporal <b>fashion.</b> The <b>novelty</b> in this protocol is to evenly distribute sensor nodes in a certain geographic area to subnets at the association process with probability p. In our simulation, {{it was observed that}} energy efficiency of Co-MAC outperforms S-MAC by 6 times and T-MAC by 2 times under identical conditions. The reason for this phenomenon is that the overhearing frequency between sensor nodes is relatively lower in Co-MAC. The results of these analyses demonstrate that Co-MAC obtains significant energy savings...|$|R

40|$|Cell {{membrane}} proteins play {{an important}} role in tissue architecture and cell-cell communication. We hypothesize that segmentation and multidimensional characterization of the distribution of cell membrane proteins, on a cell-by-cell basis, enable improved classification of treatment groups and identify important characteristics that can otherwise be hidden. We have developed a series of computational steps to (i) delineate cell membrane protein signals and associate them with a specific nucleus; (ii) compute a coupled representation of the multiplexed DNA content with membrane proteins; (iii) rank computed features associated with such a multidimensional representation; (iv) visualize selected features for comparative evaluation through heatmaps; and (v) discriminate between treatment groups in an optimal <b>fashion.</b> The <b>novelty</b> of our method is in the segmentation of the membrane signal and the multidimensional representation of phenotypic signature on a cell-by-cell basis. To test the utility of this method, the proposed computational steps were applied to images of cells that have been irradiated with different radiation qualities in the presence and absence of other small molecules. These samples are labeled for their DNA content and E-cadherin membrane proteins. We demonstrate that multidimensional representations of cell-by-cell phenotypes improve predictive and visualization capabilities among different treatment groups, and identify hidden variables...|$|R
40|$|The {{country house}} is well {{recognized}} as a site of elite patronage, an important vehicle {{of social and political}} ambition, and a statement of power and taste. Yet we know relatively little about the networks of supply and purchasing patterns of rural elites, or about how their practices related to broader changes in material culture. Drawing on a large sample of bills and receipts of the Leigh family of Stoneleigh in Warwickshire, this article recreates the processes through which the material culture of the family home was constructed. These reveal London as the source for many high quality goods, although the pattern of supply was not a simple dichotomy of local– everyday and metropolitan–luxury purchases. They also show the large number of shopkeepers patronized as the Leighs spread their purchases through choice, convenience, and expediency. Relating this to wider conceptions of consumption, the Leighs emerge as engaging in layered and sometimes conflicting consumer cultures. They were concerned with <b>fashion</b> as <b>novelty</b> and a marker of rank; but they also valued traditional markers of status. Social distinction was achieved through a continued emphasis on title and lineage as much as fashion or taste—value systems that were unavailable to the middling sort...|$|R
500|$|Later in life, when Cibber {{himself had}} {{the last word in}} casting at Drury Lane, he wrote, or patched together, several tragedies that were {{tailored}} to fit his continuing hankering after playing [...] "a Hero".

40|$|The general {{understanding}} that traditional modes of consumption were replaced for {{all levels of}} society arises primarily because conceptualisations of changing consumption regimes view elite consumers as the driving force in a broader social transformation. This {{is seen in the}} social/cultural emulation suggested by Veblen and McKendrick, but also in Simmel’s notion of trickle-down. It even fits Grieg’s reading of fashion and the Beau Monde: this was a powerful group, she argues, because they were by definition fashionable. For these models to work, the elite must, prima facie, have {{been at the forefront of}} the move to a new material culture and the lionising of <b>fashion</b> as <b>novelty</b> – an assumption that is seldom tested in empirical studies which principally focus on social groups from the gentry down. I have argued elsewhere that elite consumers followed more complex consumer models, which were characterised by the marking and redefinition of aristocratic status through patronage, conspicuous consumption and heritance. In this paper, I want to build on this by exploring the notion that elites and middling sorts followed different consumption models. To do this, I examine a large collection of catalogues for house sales taking place in and around Northamptonshire in the period 1760 - 1840. These include the country houses of elites, but also rural vicarages, urban villas, and the town houses of tradesmen. My analysis focuses on the goods being offered for sale. It assesses distinctions in terms of fashionable goods (including tea and breakfast services, decorative items, and pianos) and more traditional items (silverware, paintings, collections and carriages), and seeks to determine whether elite homes were qualitatively different during this period. But I am also interested in the language used to describe these goods, both on the covers and the pages of the catalogues. Of particular interest in this regard is the appearance of ‘antiques’ as valued items and as bridges between new and old consumer culture...|$|R
40|$|The {{material}} {{culture of the}} country house has long been both an object of fascination for visitors to the country house and the subject analysis for academics seeking to understand elite culture and, more occasionally, consumption practices. The country house and its contents are often seen as being governed by widely accepted and normative systems of taste. These have been variously interpreted in terms of conspicuous consumption, the pursuit of luxury, <b>fashion</b> or <b>novelty,</b> or a response to broadening cultural horizons and an opening up of a world of goods. From such perspectives, {{we can see the}} country house as a vehicle for the display of status; one which was constantly updated to reflect changing tastes. In this paper, I want to draw on a large collection of bills and receipts, together with a number of inventories from Stoneleigh Abbey, in order to explore and challenge these interpretations. There is plenty of evidence that the Leighs were engaged in fashionable consumption and that Stoneleigh Abbey reflected shifts in taste. However, {{it is also clear that}} the impact of changing taste was felt more keenly in some parts of the house than others: goods were moved around as new items were introduced, but the transformation, even of the main public rooms, was rarely complete. At the same time, the dictates of fashion were moderated by a specific aristocratic culture of consumption. This is sometimes seen in terms of an emphasis on dynastic spending or the collection of art or antiquities; it is also manifest in a desire to imprint familial identity on and through material objects. Perhaps most important – and most often neglected – was the way in which personal preferences cut across these general trends. The importance of the individual can be traced over three generations of the Leigh family as they chose different goods and rearranged the furniture to reflect their own taste and character...|$|R
500|$|At {{this time}} the London stage was in {{something}} of a slump after the glories of the early Restoration period. The King's and Duke's companies had merged into a monopoly, leaving actors in a weak negotiating position and much {{at the mercy of}} the dictatorial manager Christopher Rich. When the senior actors rebelled and established a cooperative company of their own in 1695, Cibber—"wisely", as the Biographical Dictionary of Actors puts it—stayed with the remnants of the old company, [...] "where the competition was less keen". After five years, he had still not seen significant success in his chosen profession, and there had been no heroic parts and no love scenes. However, the return of two-company rivalry created a sudden demand for new plays, and Cibber seized this opportunity to launch his career by writing a comedy with a big, flamboyant part for himself to play. He scored a double triumph: his comedy Love's Last Shift, or The Fool in Fashion (1696) was a great success, and his own uninhibited performance as the Frenchified fop Sir <b>Novelty</b> <b>Fashion</b> ("a coxcomb that loves to be the first in all foppery") delighted the audiences. His name was made, both as playwright and as comedian.|$|R
5000|$|The fop was a stock {{character}} in English literature and especially comic drama, {{as well as}} satirical prints. He is a [...] "man of fashion" [...] who overdresses, aspires to wit, and generally puts on airs, which may include aspiring to a higher social station than others think he has. He may be somewhat effeminate, although this rarely affects his pursuit of an heiress. He may also overdo being fashionably French by wearing French clothes and using French vocabulary. An example of the so-called Frenchified fop is Sir <b>Novelty</b> <b>Fashion</b> in Colley Cibber's Love's Last Shift (1696). Fop characters appear in many Restoration comedies, including sir Fopling Flutter in George Etherege's The Man of Mode, or Sir Fopling Flutter (1676), Aphra Behn's diatribe against politic marriages, The Town Fop (1676, published 1677), and Lord Foppington in The Relapse (1696) by John Vanbrugh. Vanbrugh planned The Relapse around particular actors at the Drury Lane Theatre, including Colley Cibber, who played Lord Foppington. A fop is {{also referred to as}} a [...] "", as in the Restoration comedies The Beaux' Stratagem (1707) by George Farquhar, The Beau Defeated (1700) by Mary Pix, or the real-life Beau Nash, master of ceremonies at Bath, or Regency celebrity Beau Brummell.

40|$|ABSTRACT THE PERFORMANCE OF IDENTITY IN SELECTED PLAYS BY JONSON, ETHEREGE, CIBBER, AND CROWN by Connor J. Trebra Master of Arts in English California State University, Chico Spring 2009 This study {{focuses on}} the {{performance}} of gender and social identities found in selected plays of the seventeenth-century theater. Primary texts include Jonson???s Epicoene and Bartholomew Fair, Cibber???s Love???s Last Shift, Crowne???s Sir <b>Novelty</b> <b>Fashion,</b> and Etherege???s The Man of Mode. The playwrights of the seventeenth and eighteenth century used theater to delight as well as to instruct and critique its audience members, English culture, and politics. While plays tended to uphold the status quo, portrayals of gender, especially masculinity, also subtly paved the way for changing cultural and societal roles. If gender is, as Judith Butler posits, performative, then gender as performed on the early all male seventeenth-century stage is particularly complex. Furthermore, although the later seventeenth-century introduced women actors to the stage, the complex layers of gender performance that we see in the character of both the libertine and the fop continued to both defend and challenge prevailing masculine standards. This thesis intends to discuss those defenses and challenges seen in the above vii plays in connection with class, gender, and power, and provide readings based on theories from Rom Harr??, Robert W. Connell, Thomas A. King, Andrew P. Williams, and others. CSU, Chic...|$|R
40|$|Fashion merchants were {{acknowledged}} {{as the highest}} status trade and dynamic agents for change within the production and consumption of women’s clothing {{in the eighteenth century}} but their position in the nineteenth century has not previously been considered. This thesis examines how the trade evolved in Paris between 1795 and 1855 considering factors such as gender, finance and location in the context of political, economic and social change. The findings challenge the idea that significant change only occurred before 1789 or after 1860. <b>Fashion</b> merchants used <b>novelty,</b> luxury and taste to produce fashionable merchandise, particularly headgear, from a range of authentic and substitute materials that stimulated consumer demand across different social levels. Engaging with debates about gender and the public sphere, the investigation demonstrates that, although there were successful male merchants, women continued to dominate the sector. Married women did not retreat from business, instead their husbands could be helpmeets and the métier was often the focus of the family economy. Continuity was found in the use of credit in trade, the high status of the fashion merchant, the importance of reputation and the value of location and premises. Change was shown in production, sales and promotional strategies including advertising and the increasing importance of headwear to French industry was acknowledged by its inclusion in the industry exhibitions of 1851 and 1855...|$|R
40|$|As an {{expressive}} language, {{fashion design}} has an innate capacity to engage a full gamut of sensorial responses. This research explores {{the contribution of}} synaesthesia to fashion design {{in an effort to}} highlight the positive aesthetic and intellectual impact of this integration. Such research advances my creative practice. The method of realising garments which address synaesthetic principles is an extension of personal interest in synaesthesia, driven from both an experiential perspective and a desire to gain a greater understanding into theories in relation to challenging the senses in a contemporary fashion world. If <b>fashion</b> includes <b>novelty</b> as a crucial and desirable aspect, and can be defined as an ever evolving and self rejuvenating art form, then the energy and frivolity of these components in association with multiple sensory stimuli and response will expose the consequence of the study through design-work. Recognition of the importance of sensory cross-overs in fashion design will reveal the quintessence of how humans position themselves and respond to a specific environment. If realisation of the senses is with regard to surroundings, and fashion becomes the surrounding which elicits multiple involuntary responses from stimuli, a conscious recognition has begun. Traditional theories on the organisation of sense modalities speculate that humans perceive their world with five senses, the most dominant generally being sight. The combined effect of these senses creates the environment in which we inhabit. The visual and tactile senses have long been the focus of the fashion product but, of all the senses, touch is most key to our species (Ackerman, 1990). Sound, taste and smell have been under-recognised as providers of ceaseless information about our environment. The investigation into the notion that fashion and other sensory systems are not separate entities assists with establishing the links between sensory integration and fashion design. The emergence of the synaesthetic paradigm has highlighted a unity between the senses rather than the traditional hierarchy of favouring the visual. The research on synaesthesia relative to fashion design occupies a parallel position to neurological theory and allows synaesthetic investigation to be a pivotal determining factor towards my outcome. I have engaged in critical self-reflection of my design process and production as a means of elucidating stimuli associated with multi-sensory perception...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} and discusses changes in certain dress and clothing practices {{and their effects}} on conflict within oneself and others. In this context, the paper analyzes certain conflict situations faced by the Goranci females in Belgrade. This conflict was {{brought about by the}} changes that have occurred in the females clothing {{during the second half of}} 20 th and the first decade of 21 st century. The focus is placed on changes that were initiated by external factors - legislation, migration and <b>fashion</b> trends. Accepting <b>novelties</b> in dress and clothing was not always simple and easy, especially if they implied the elimination of those garments implying a certain symbolic significance within the Goranci community and female subculture. Besides, changes in clothing imply and initiate changes in other spheres of life, especially in the sphere of (self) identification, on several levels at the same time (gender, religious, ethnic, etc.). The initiation of the clothing changes impacted the women in such a way to become somewhat at odds with themselves, to feel discomfort because of the fear that the (non) acceptance of the novelty could cause conflicts with some family members and relatives. A reconciliation with oneself and others imply that a women accepts a new way of dressing, but also the rest of whatever this may imply. Such reconciliation - assessed in this way - is not an end in itself. It is a process that involves several aspects simultaneously, and clothing is just one among them. In addition, a reconciliation on a personal level does not imply in itself reconciliation with others, and vice versa. Conflicts due to clothing do not represent an exception in this respect, but proved to be indicative for understanding complex socio-cultural processes such as reconciliation...|$|R
40|$|Vincenzo Galilei foi um músico teórico, alaudista e professor, nascido em uma pequena cidade nos arredores de Florença na primeira metade do século XVI. Embora pouco se saiba de sua formação, sabe-se que após os seus estudos com o teórico Gioseffo Zarlino, manteve intensa correspondência com o filólogo Girolamo Mei que o introduziu aos textos da antigüidade clássica. Vincenzo Galilei estudou e criticou os textos clássicos e desenvolveu experimentações com instrumentos. Ao estudar os instrumentos musicais e os materiais de que eram constituídos, Galilei buscava solucionar problemas musicais. A sua análise dos diversos comportamentos dos materiais, assim como dos instrumentos, proveu um novo fundamento para a música teórica.

Vanbrugh reputedly wrote the part of Lord Foppington deliberately [...] "to suit the eccentricities of Cibber's acting style".His tragic efforts, however, were consistently ridiculed by contemporaries: when Cibber in the role of Richard III made love to Lady Anne, the Grub Street Journal wrote, [...] "he looks like a pickpocket, with his shrugs and grimaces, that has more a design on her purse than her heart". Cibber was on the stage in every year but two (1727 and 1731) between his debut in 1690 and his retirement in 1732, playing more than 100 parts in all in nearly 3,000 documented performances. After he had sold his interest in Drury Lane in 1733 and was a wealthy man in his sixties, he returned to the stage occasionally to play the classic fop parts of Restoration comedy for which audiences appreciated him. His Lord Foppington in Vanbrugh's The Relapse, Sir Courtly Nice in John Crowne's Sir Courtly Nice, and Sir Fopling Flutter in George Etherege's Man of Mode were legendary. Critic John Hill in his 1775 work The actor, or, A treatise on the art of playing, described Cibber as [...] "the best Lord Foppington who ever appeared, was in real life (with all due respect be it spoken by one who loves him) something of the coxcomb". These were the kind of comic parts where Cibber's affectation and mannerism were desirable. In 1738-39, he played Shallow in Shakespeare's Henry IV, Part 2 to critical acclaim, but his Richard III (in his own version of the play) was not well received. In the middle of the play, he whispered to fellow actor Benjamin Victor that he wanted to go home, perhaps realising he was too old for the part and its physical demands. Cibber also essayed tragic parts in plays by Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, John Dryden and others, but with less success. By the end of his acting career, audiences were being entranced by the innovatively naturalistic acting of the rising star David Garrick, who made his London debut in the title part in a production of Cibber's adaptation of Richard III in 1741. He returned to the stage for a final time in 1745 as Cardinal Pandulph in his play Papal Tyranny in the Reign of King John.|$|R
