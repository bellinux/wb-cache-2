40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the <b>inertia</b> <b>tensors</b> of tennis rackets and {{their influence on}} the elbow swing torques in a forehand motion, the loadings transmitted to the elbow from central and eccentric impacts, and the racket acceleration responses from central and eccentric impacts. <b>Inertia</b> <b>tensors</b> of various rackets with similar mass and mass center location were determined by an inertia pendulum and were found to vary considerably in all three orthogonal directions. Tennis swing mechanics and impact analyses were performed using a computer model comprised of a full-body model of a human, a parametric model of the racket, and an impact function. The swing mechanics analysis of a forehand motion determined that inertia values had a moderate linear effect on the pronation-supination elbow torques required to twist the racket, and a minor effect on the flexion-extension and valgus-varus torques. The impact analysis found that mass center inertia values had a considerable effect on the transmitted torques for both longitudinal and latitudinal eccentric impacts and significantly affected all elbow torque components. Racket acceleration responses to central and eccentric impacts were measured experimentally and found to be notably sensitive to impact location and mass center inertia value...|$|R
40|$|New {{statistical}} {{properties of}} dark matter halos in Lagrangian space are presented. Tracing back the dark matter particles constituting bound halos resolved {{in a series of}} N-body simulations, we measure quantitatively the correlations of the proto-halo’s <b>inertia</b> <b>tensors</b> with the local tidal tensors and investigate how the correlation strength depends on the proto-halo’s shape, local density and filtering scale. It is shown {{that the majority of the}} proto-halos exhibit strong correlations between the two tensors provided that the tidal field is smoothed on the proto-halo’s mass scale. The correlation strength is found to increase as the proto-halo’s sphericity increases, as the proto-halo’s mass increases, and as the local density becomes close to the critical value, δec. It is also found that those peculiar proto-halos which exhibit exceptionally weak correlations between the two tensors tend to acquire higher specific angular momentum in Eulerian space, which is consistent with the linear tidal torque theory. In the light of our results, it is intriguing to speculate a hypothesis that the low surface brightness galaxies observed at present epoch correspond to the peculiar needle-shaped proto-halos whose <b>inertia</b> <b>tensors</b> are weakly correlated with the local tidal tensors in Lagrangian space. We discuss the possibility that the strengths of the correlations between the two tensors depend on the background cosmology.

Its trabecular structure is constantly remodelling to ensure a maintenance function. A simulated bone remodelling process was discussed in a previous study based on a BMU germ-grain model where type and orientation of local structure related to mechanical stress were not considered. In this study, we explore the potential ability of a 3 D-skeleton coupled with a statistical tensor analysis to locally describe the trabecular structure for binary images. In order to add new constraints for BMU validation and BMU-shape characterisation in the simulator, we propose a strategy using <b>inertia</b> <b>tensors</b> based on the skeleton ensuring the feasibility of the entire process...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a mathematical method for generating walking primitives for an anthropomorphic 3 D-biped with 12 joints. The corresponding rigid body model includes all masses and <b>inertia</b> <b>tensors.</b> Control torques allowing a symmetrical straight ahead gait with pre-swing, swing and heel-contact are derived by dynamic optimization using a direct collocation approach. The computed torques minimize {{the absolute value}} of the mechanical power consumption in the joints of the biped. Zero moment point (ZMP) and friction conditions at the feet ensuring postural stability of the biped, as well as bounds on the joint angles and on the control torques, are treated as constraints. The resulting biped motion is dynamically stable and the overall motion behaviour is remarkably close to that of humans. ...|$|R

We prove the non complete meromorphic integrability of the satellite using a criterion based on a theorem of J. -J. Morales and J. -P. Ramis. This criterion relies on some local and global properties of a linear differential system, called normal variational system and depending rationally on A and 3 (B −A). Our proof uses tools from computer algebra and proceeds in two steps: first the satellite with axial symmetry (i. e. 0 < A < B = C = 1) then the satellite without axial symmetry (i. e. 0 < A < B < C = 1). ...|$|R
