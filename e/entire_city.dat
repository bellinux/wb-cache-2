5|$|Hamburg {{had once}} been Germany's main seaport, the fourth largest in the world, but in 1943 {{virtually}} the <b>entire</b> <b>city</b> {{had been reduced to}} rubble by World War II bombing raids.

5|$|Although the {{original}} plan had been to demolish the old fortifications of Rethymno and move the inhabitants into the Fortezza, it {{was too small to}} house the <b>entire</b> <b>city.</b> The walls along the landward approach to the city were left intact, and the Fortezza became a citadel housing the Venetian administration of the city. It was only to be used by the inhabitants of the city {{in the case of an}} Ottoman invasion. Over the years, a number of modifications were made to the fortress. Nonetheless, it was never truly secure as it lacked a ditch and outworks, and the ramparts were rather low.|$|E

The operation was a success; Soviet resistance crumbled. On 1 July German forces entered the city while the Soviet forces conducted a disorganised evacuation, and Hitler promoted Manstein to Generalfeldmarschall the same day. The <b>entire</b> <b>city</b> was in German hands by 4 July.|$|E
