5|$|About 50–80% of {{salicylate}} in {{the blood}} <b>is</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> albumin protein, while the rest remains in the active, ionized state; protein binding is concentration-dependent. Saturation of binding sites leads to more free salicylate and increased toxicity. The volume of distribution is 0.1–0.2 L/kg. Acidosis increases the volume of distribution because of enhancement of tissue penetration of salicylates.|$|E

5|$|Bond dispatches Sévérine's {{guards and}} sneaks aboard her boat. After he joins {{her in the}} shower, the two have sex. While {{approaching}} Silva's base on Dead Island, Sévérine becomes more afraid and tells Bond {{that it is not}} too late to retreat. However, they are taken prisoner by the guards, handcuffed and escorted through an abandoned city on the island. She explains to Bond that Silva made the natives believe a leak at the local chemical plant required them to evacuate the island. This allowed him to use it as his base of operations. Sévérine is separated from Bond, and is brutally beaten for her betrayal. After Bond is interrogated by Silva, he is taken to a courtyard, where Sévérine <b>is</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> a statue. Silva places a shot glass of whiskey on her head, and challenges Bond to shoot it with an antique percussion cap pistol. Bond misses the target, and Silva responds by shooting her in the head.|$|E

5|$|Copper {{enters the}} body through the {{digestive}} tract. A transporter protein on {{the cells of}} the small bowel, copper membrane transporter 1 (Ctr1; SLC31A1), carries copper inside the cells, where some <b>is</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> metallothionein and part is carried by ATOX1 to an organelle known as the trans-Golgi network. Here, in response to rising concentrations of copper, an enzyme called ATP7A releases copper into the portal vein to the liver. Liver cells also carry the CMT1 protein, and metallothionein and ATOX1 bind it inside the cell, but here it is ATP7B that links copper to ceruloplasmin and releases it into the bloodstream, as well as removing excess copper by secreting it into bile. Both functions of ATP7B are impaired in Wilson's disease. Copper accumulates in the liver tissue; ceruloplasmin is still secreted, but in a form that lacks copper (termed apoceruloplasmin) and is rapidly degraded in the bloodstream.|$|E
5|$|Ginsburg {{has also}} been an {{advocate}} for using foreign law and norms to shape U.S. law in judicial opinions, a view not shared by some of her conservative colleagues. Ginsburg supports using foreign interpretations of law for the persuasive value and possible wisdom, not as precedent which the court <b>is</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> follow. Ginsburg has expressed the view that looking to international law is well-ingrained in tradition in American law, counting John Henry Wigmore and President John Adams as internationalists. Ginsburg's own reliance on international law dates back to her time as an attorney; during her first argument before the court, 1971's Reed v. Reed, she cited two German cases. In her concurring opinion in Grutter v. Bollinger 539 U.S. 306 (2016), a decision upholding Michigan Law School's affirmative action admissions policy, Ginsburg noted there was accord between the notion that affirmative action admissions policies would have an end point and agrees with international treaties designed to combat racial and gender based discrimination.|$|E
5|$|Heparin occurs {{naturally}} {{in the human}} body, but the development of HIT antibodies suggests heparin may act as a hapten, and thus be targeted by the immune system. In HIT, the immune system forms antibodies against heparin when it <b>is</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> a protein called platelet factor 4 (PF4). These antibodies are usually of the IgG class and their development usually takes about five days. However, {{those who have been}} exposed to heparin {{in the last few months}} may still have circulating IgG, as IgG-type antibodies generally continue to be produced even when their precipitant has been removed. This is similar to immunity against certain microorganisms, with the difference that the HIT antibody does not persist more than three months. HIT antibodies have been found in individuals with thrombocytopenia and thrombosis who had no prior exposure to heparin, but the majority are found in people who are receiving heparin.|$|E

5|$|Messenger RNA (mRNA) carries {{information}} about a protein sequence to the ribosomes, the protein synthesis factories in the cell. It is coded so that every three nucleotides (a codon) corresponds to one amino acid. In eukaryotic cells, once precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) has been transcribed from DNA, it is processed to mature mRNA. This removes its introns—non-coding sections of the pre-mRNA. The mRNA is then exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where it <b>is</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> ribosomes and translated into its corresponding protein form {{with the help of}} tRNA. In prokaryotic cells, which do not have nucleus and cytoplasm compartments, mRNA can bind to ribosomes while it is being transcribed from DNA. After {{a certain amount of time}} the message degrades into its component nucleotides with the assistance of ribonucleases.|$|E
5|$|Once the Kongs collect all DK coins, {{they give}} the coins to Funky, who in {{exchange}} gives them a gyrocopter.

She tells the Kongs that she can only be freed if her separated children are returned to her, and that she will rid the land of K. Rool if she is freed. The Kongs find each of her children in a cave, {{where one of the}} birds is trapped in an egg which hatches when the Kongs complete a Simon-like memory game. After rescuing them and completing a large trade sequence between the Brothers Bear, the Kongs return the children to the Queen. The Queen and her children all sing, annihilating the barrier. The Queen proceeds to chase K. Rool, who is fleeing in a hovercraft. When she catches up to him, she drops a giant eggshell on top of him, which Dixie and Kiddy land on. The Kongs repeatedly knock on the shell, annoying K. Rool.|$|E
5|$|Thyroid hormone is {{required}} for the normal functioning of numerous tissues in the body. In health, the thyroid gland predominantly secretes thyroxine (T4), which is converted into triiodothyronine (T3) in other organs by the selenium-dependent enzyme iodothyronine deiodinase. Triiodothyronine binds to the thyroid hormone receptor in the nucleus of cells, where it stimulates the turning on of particular genes and the production of specific proteins. Additionally, the hormone binds to integrin αvβ3 on the cell membrane, thereby stimulating the sodium–hydrogen antiporter and processes such as formation of blood vessels and cell growth. In blood, almost all thyroid hormone (99.97%) <b>is</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> plasma proteins such as thyroxine-binding globulin; only the free unbound thyroid hormone is biologically active.|$|E

5|$|Unlike the organolithium compounds, the {{organometallic}} compounds of the heavier alkali metals are predominantly ionic. The application of organosodium compounds in chemistry {{is limited in}} part due to competition from organolithium compounds, which are commercially available and exhibit more convenient reactivity. The principal organosodium compound of commercial importance is sodium cyclopentadienide. Sodium tetraphenylborate can also be classified as an organosodium compound since in the solid state sodium <b>is</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> the aryl groups. Organometallic compounds of the higher alkali metals are even more reactive than organosodium compounds and of limited utility. A notable reagent is Schlosser's base, a mixture of n-butyllithium and potassium tert-butoxide. This reagent reacts with propene to form the compound allylpotassium (KCH2CHCH2). cis-2-Butene and trans-2-butene equilibrate when in contact with alkali metals. Whereas isomerisation is fast with lithium and sodium, it is slow with the heavier alkali metals. The heavier alkali metals also favour the sterically congested conformation. Several crystal structures of organopotassium compounds have been reported, establishing that they, like the sodium compounds, are polymeric. Organosodium, organopotassium, organorubidium and organocaesium compounds are all mostly ionic and are insoluble (or nearly so) in nonpolar solvents.|$|E
