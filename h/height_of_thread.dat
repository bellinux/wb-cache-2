40|$|A lot {{of studies}} on thread rolling have been tried already, and {{nowadays}} by the spread of rolling machine thread rolling is playing {{an important part in}} the production of screws. In the present report the authors used four roller types which were different in rib number of roller, examined the rolling of external thread to aluminum bar, investigated the relation between rib number of dice and swelled <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>thread,</b> and inquired into minimum rib number giving regular form of the rolled threads. 近年加工技術の発展にともない，金属の加工に冷間塑性加工を使用する場合が多くなった。この加工を用いれば，量産性，精度，表面あらさなどに有利な点が多く，転造による加工が効果的である。このことからねじ転造用機械として 1851 年に平形転造ダイスを使用する転造盤がイギリスで試作され，後 1940 年代に丸形ダイスを用いる転造盤がドイツで作られている。わが国でも戦後研究が盛んになり現在では丸形ダイスを用いた油圧式転造盤を用い，小ものねじ類はほとんど転造により加工されている。当講座では転造において重要な位置をしめる転造ダイスに興味をもち，外径の大きな素材に対してそろばん玉状ダイスと簡単な装置を用いてJIS規格M 30 のねじ転造を行ない，その精度を調べ，あわせてダイス山数の変化に対するねじ山の形成状況を観察し，ダイス山数の最小必要数を求めた...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{we present}} an {{acceleration}} method for texture-based ray cast-ing on the compute unified device architecture (CUDA) compatible graphics process-ing unit (GPU). Since ray casting is a memory-intensive application, our method in-creases the hit {{rate of the}} texture cache during rendering. To achieve this, our method dynamically selects the width and <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>thread</b> blocks (TBs) such that each warp, which {{is a series of}} 32 threads simultaneously processed on the GPU, can achieve high data locality for specific viewpoints. The objective of this selection is to allow every warp rather than every thread to access data with a small stride, because the GPU ex-ecutes multiple threads at the same time. In experiments using a GeForce GTX 480 card (i. e., the latest Fermi architecture), we find that the speedup of our method ranges from a factor of 1. 0 to that of 4. 0, depending on viewpoints. We think that optimizing the shape of TBs is important to achieve more cache hits in the highly-threaded CUDA hardware. ...|$|E

50|$|The minor {{diameter}} is the lower extreme diameter <b>of</b> the <b>thread.</b> Major diameter minus {{minor diameter}}, divided by two, equals the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the <b>thread.</b> The minor diameter of a nut is its inside diameter.

40|$|In a bolted joint, it {{is known}} that {{failures}} usually happen {{at the root of the}} first bolt thread where the maximum stress concentration occurs. Previously several methods were proposed to reduce the stress concentration through improving bolts and nuts profile. Among those methods, tapering threads have been widely used in mechanical structures. Those types <b>of</b> <b>threads</b> are called CD bolts, which were proposed by Nishida as an effective method for stress reduction. Several experimental studies indicated that CD bolts have higher fatigue strength although little FEM analyses is available. In this study, therefore, the bolted joint with tapered threads is analyzed with the finite element method, and stress reduction effect of CD bolts is discussed with varying geometrical conditions. The reduction of the stress concentration is realized by tapering bolt thread. Then, it is found that the stress reduction is notable when the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> bolt <b>threads</b> is reduced significantly near the bolt heat and the nut is closer to the bolt head. According to those results, optimum conditions for stress reduction are discussed. Then, it is shown that the maximum stress can be decreased by 20 % compared with the cases of standard bolts and nuts...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} realization of an online measurement device used for Joint Internal Thread. The online measurement device adopts the principle that the shaft section of two dimensional tooth profile <b>of</b> Joint Internal <b>Thread</b> was obtained with the passive contact method. A novel first derivative segmentation method based on the dynamic linear regression was used to classify and identify the two-dimensional tooth profile data. The basic and derived parameter <b>of</b> Joint Internal <b>Thread</b> was then quickly calculated. The tooth <b>height</b> <b>of</b> Joint Internal <b>Thread</b> {{was used as the}} traceable standard to calibrate the online measurement device. The comparison between field experiment data and manually measured data shows that the online measurement device is a rational design which works stably, shortens the measurement time largely, and improves the efficiency.

40|$|A {{woven fabric}} {{structure}} {{is defined by}} mutual threads interlacing in the fabric {{as well as the}} basic parameters of the fabric. The interrelation among fabric parameters can be obtained by considering a geometrical model of the fabric and specific experimental methods. The geometrical model is mainly concerned with the shape taken up by the yarn in the warp or weft cross-section of the fabric. This article provides a possible methodology for evaluation of geometric parameters <b>of</b> <b>threads</b> in the real longitudinal and transverse cross-sections of fabric. From an individual cross-section of the fabric using image analysis it is possible to define the diameter <b>of</b> <b>threads,</b> their deformation, thread spacing, the maximum displace-ment (<b>height</b> <b>of</b> binding wave) <b>of</b> the <b>thread</b> axis, the angle <b>of</b> the <b>thread</b> axis (interlacing angle), the length <b>of</b> the <b>thread</b> axis in the cross-section of the fabric, the crimp <b>of</b> <b>threads</b> in the fabric, and the real shape of the binding wave through wave coordinates. The pa-rameters mentioned are possible to use as input for mathematical modelling of the fabric structure and for prediction of mechanical and end-use properties of fabrics. Key words: fabric geometry, interlacing, cross-section, waviness, height, binding waves...|$|R
50|$|The stack <b>height</b> <b>of</b> {{a headset}} {{is the total}} {{assembled}} <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the headset components and, {{in the case of}} a threadless system, the stem, discounting the tangs which press into the head tube and (in the case <b>of</b> <b>threaded</b> headsets) the thickness of the top seal of the locknut. The stack <b>height</b> <b>of</b> a frame and fork is the difference between the steerer tube length and the head tube length. Stack height is critical because a headset with a greater stack height than the frame and fork will not fit; the locknut will not thread on sufficiently (threaded) or there will be no room for the stem (threadless). If the headset has a lower stack height than the frame and fork, spacers are added to make up the difference.|$|R

The article reviews manufacturer’s production programs <b>of</b> <b>thread</b> mills (Carmex, Emuge, Jel, Sandvik, Vargus) to show that, presently, there is a significant diversity <b>of</b> <b>thread</b> mill designs for processing. The analysis allowed to reveal the main nomenclature and standard sizes <b>of</b> <b>thread</b> mills, including combined tools on their base, as well as to reveal classification signs and to develop classification <b>of</b> <b>thread</b> mills. Classification comprises also combined tools based on design <b>of</b> <b>thread</b> mill, which allow us to reduce the nomenclature of the tools used in threading. The paper considers working schemes of the main types <b>of</b> <b>thread</b> mills and areas of their rational application. To analyse design data <b>of</b> <b>thread</b> mills two types of tools have been selected, namely the integral trailer edge thread mills with the spiral chip flutes and drill thread mills made from hard alloy. The analysis of design data was made in the closed "system of the tool", i. e. in advance assuming that there is a connection between diameter of the tapping part of the tool and diameter <b>of</b> the cut <b>thread.</b> The parameter analysis of the chosen designs allowed us to develop the sketches of tools with the specified parameters to be calculated.
