The region {{has been particularly}} active during {{the second part of}} 2002, and we show GMS- 5, NOAA/AVHRR- 16, and Aqua/MODIS data from eruptions of Raung (Java, Indonesia), and Ruang (Sangihe Islands, Indonesia). We also show a possible ‘volcanic thunderstorm ’ from Rabaul, Papua New Guinea, in 1999. The higher spatial resolution of polar orbiting instruments is important for examination of <b>eruption</b> <b>details</b> and detection of small eruptions, but the high temporal resolution of geostationary satellites is critical for an effective warning service. The ‘split-window ’ method is the primary method of volcanic ash detection. GMS- 5 can be effective at detecting ash with the split-window method, particularly in the eruption at Ruang. ‘False alarms ’ caused by the stratospheric temperature inversion and poor instrument calibration can be minimised with the enhancement techniques used in Darwin. The availability of more spectral bands in polar orbiting satellites can help us understand the nature of eruption clouds.

40|$|Large {{volcanic}} eruptions have strong impacts on both atmospheric and ocean dynamics that {{can last for}} decades. Numerical models have attempted to reproduce the effects of major {{volcanic eruptions}} on climate; however, there are remarkable inter-model disagreements related to both short-term dynamical response to volcanic forcing and long-term oceanic evolution. The lack of robust simulated behaviour is related to various aspects from model formulation to simulated background internal variability to the <b>eruption</b> <b>details.</b> Here, we use the Norwegian Earth System Model version 1 to calculate interactively the volcanic aerosol loading resulting from SO 2 emissions of the second largest high-latitude volcanic eruption in historical time (the Laki eruption of 1783). We use two different approaches commonly used interchangeably in the literature to generate ensembles. The ensembles start from different background initial states, and we show that the two approaches are not identical on short-time scales (< 1 yr) in discerning the volcanic effects on climate, depending on the background initial state in which the simulated eruption occurred. Our results also show that volcanic eruptions alter surface climate variability (in general increasing it) when aerosols are allowed to realistically interact with circulation: Simulations with fixed volcanic aerosol show no significant change in surface climate variability. Our simulations also highlight that the change in climate variability is not a linear function {{of the amount of}} the volcanic aerosol injected. We then provide a tentative estimation of the ensemble size needed to discern a given volcanic signal on surface temperature from the natural internal variability on regional scale: At least 20 – 25 members are necessary to significantly detect seasonally averaged anomalies of 0. 5 °C; however, when focusing on North America and in winter, a higher number of ensemble members (35 – 40) is necessary...|$|E

Successful volcanic event forecasting {{depends on}} the quality of the surveillance network for detecting any changes in volcano behaviour. To interpret the geochemical and geophysical precursors correctly it is important to understand the volcanic processes that occur prior and during volcanic <b>eruptions.</b> <b>Detailed</b> knowledge of the volcano internal structure, the rheology of the magmas, the time scales of the processes occurring at depth and the characteristics of past unrest episodes, must be combined with an adequate monitoring network to improve the volcanic hazard forecast. However, these aspects have received little attention in monogenetic volcanoes. The aim of my PhD Thesis is to improve our understanding on monogenetic volcanism, its causes and dynamics, and to help anticipating the volcanic activity. I have focused on three main aspects of this problem. The first one is the calculation of the rheological properties of magmas during mixing. The second aspect I have addressed are the processes and time scales that lead to monogenetic eruptions with the aim to better interpret volcanic unrest and improve eruption forecasts. Finally, I have investigated the seismic unrest periods of historical monogenetic eruptions from a compilation of historical accounts worldwide. The results provide a conceptual framework for better anticipating monogenetic eruptions and should lead to improved strategies for mitigation of their associated hazards and risks.

40|$|Post-caldera eruptions of Santorini, Greece, {{over the}} past 3000 years {{resulted}} {{in the formation of}} the Kameni Islands, which comprise a series of compositionally similar dacitic lava flows. Each lava flow has a distinct population of partially-crystalline mafic enclaves, which we propose were derived from the break-up of a layer of replenishing magma responsible for triggering the eruption. Five of the recent flows (erupted in 1570, 1939, 1940, 1941 and 1950) include enclaves of essentially identical andesitic bulk compositions, which formed by crystallization of originally aphyric melts prior to <b>eruption.</b> <b>Detailed</b> examination of angles subtended at the junctions between pairs of plagioclase grains demonstrates that enclaves from each flow have a characteristic textural signature, with distinct differences in the extent of quench-related modification of the original population of dihedral angles formed by impingement of growing grains. These variations suggest that the temperature difference between the host dacite and the replenishing andesite at the time of layer overturn and eruption differed between flows. The uniformity of major element compositions of both the replenishing magma and the host dacitic lava flows demonstrates that the critical parameter in determining the timing of layer-overturn is the pre-eruptive H 2 O content of both host dacite and replenishing magma. We suggest that the replenishing magma responsible for two of the three eruptions in the period 1939 - 1941 was significantly wetter than that responsible for the later 1950 eruption. The enclaves with the least amount of quench-related modification occur in the 1570 flow. We suggest that in this case the intruding magma was relatively dry. © 2005 Cambridge University Press...|$|R
40|$|Injection of basaltic magmas into silicic crustal holding {{chambers}} and subsequent magma mingling or mixing {{is a process}} that has been recognised since the late seventies as resulting in explosive <b>eruptions.</b> <b>Detailed</b> reconstruction and assessment of the mixing process caused by such intrusion is now possible because of the exceptional time-sequence sample suite available from the tephra fallout of the 2010 summit eruption at Eyjafjallajökull volcano in South Iceland. Fallout from 14 to 19 April contains three glass types of basaltic, intermediate, and silicic compositions recording rapid magma mingling without homogenisation, involving evolved FeTi-basalt and silicic melt with composition identical to that produced by the 1821 – 1823 AD Eyjafjallajökull summit eruption. The time-dependent change in the magma composition suggests a binary mixing process with changing end-member compositions and proportions. Beginning of May, a new injection of primitive basalt was recorded by deep seismicity, appearance of Mg-rich olivine phenocrysts together with high sulphur dioxide output and presence of sulphide crystals. Thus, the composition of the basaltic injection became more magnesian and hotter with time provoking changes in the silicic mixing end-member from pre-existing melt to the solid carapace of the magma chamber. Finally, decreasing proportions of the mafic end-member with time in the erupted mixed-magma demonstrate that injections of Mg-rich basalt was the motor of the 2010 Eyjafjallajökull explosive eruption, and that its decreasing inflow terminated the eruption. Significant quantity of silicic magma is thus still present in the interior of the volcano. Our results show that detailed sampling during the entire eruption was essential for deciphering the complex magmatic processes at play, i. e. the dynamics of the magma mingling and mixing. Finally, the rapid compositional changes in the eruptive products suggest that magma mingling occurs on a timescale of a few hours to days whereas the interval between the first detected magma injection and eruption was several months...|$|R
40|$|The 5 April 2003 {{eruption}} of Stromboli volcano (Italy) {{was the most}} violent in the past 50 years. It was also the best documented due to the accurate geophysical monitoring of the ongoing effusive <b>eruption.</b> <b>Detailed</b> field studies carried out {{a few hours to}} {{a few months after the}} event provided further information that were coupled with visual documentation to reconstruct the explosive dynamics. The eruption consisted of an 8 -min-long explosive event preceded by a short-lived precursory activity that evolved into the impulsive ejection of gas and pyroclasts. Meter-sized ballistic blocks were launched to altitudes of up to 1400 m above the craters falling on the volcano flanks and on the village of Ginostra, about 2 km far from the vent. The vertical jet of gas and pyroclasts above the craters fed a convective plume that reached a height of 4 km. The calculated erupted mass yielded values of 1. 1 – 1. 4 × 108 kg. Later explosions generated a scoria flow deposit, with an estimated mass of 1. 0 – 1. 3 × 107 kg. Final, waning ash explosions closet the event. The juvenile fraction consisted of an almost aphyric, highly vesicular pumice mingled with a shallow-derived, crystal-rich, moderately vesicular scoria. Resuming of the lava emission a few hours after the paroxysm indicate that the shallow magmatic system was not significantly modified during the explosions. Combination of volume data with duration of eruptive phases allowed us to estimate the eruptive intensity: during the climactic explosive event, the mass discharge rate was between 106 and 107 kg/s, whereas during the pyroclastic flow activity, it was 2. 8 – 3. 6 × 105 kg/s. Strong similarities with other historical paroxysms at Stromboli suggest similar explosion dynamics...|$|R

40|$|Little {{is known}} about how the {{internal}} structures of explosive calderas vary with time, and whether this can affect magma differentiation, eruption behaviour and periodicity. Some exhumed calderas underwent a single piecemeal collapse – e. g. Scafell caldera,UK (Branney and Kokelaar, 1994), however this study tests whether some calderas become more intensely fractured with time due to successive distinct caldera-collapse eruptions. This scenario might lead to more frequent, smaller eruptions over time (noncyclic); magma leakage through an increasingly fractured volcano might also lead to less evolved compositions with time due to shorter residence times (Ferriz and Mahood, 1984).

At the same time, primitive lavas continued to erupt from dyke complexes in the rift zones, while intermediate lavas effused in the geographical transition from rift zone to central complex. To constrain the magmatic processes, {{that gave rise}} to the observed temporal and spatial patterns, several types of geochemical analyses of these rocks were applied and results embedded into a detailed, pre-existing framework of radiometric ages and whole-rock data. A case study of the composite lava flow of Montana Reventada allowed to investigate magma mixing as one potential mechanism to generate intermediate magma on Tenerife. The two end-members were a basanite and a phonolite, which erupted one after another, the basanite before the phonolite. The phonolite carries a considerable amount of mafic enclaves. Based on field evidence, the magma mixing event was constrained to a short interval before the <b>eruption.</b> A <b>detailed</b> geochemical dataset was used to confirm the mixed nature of the inclusions and to determine mixing ratios. Not all elements and oxides could be modelled, which is explained by observed crystal exchange between basanite and phonolite and by interdiffusion of trace elements between enclaves and phonolite.

A 50 cm core sample which contained the ash layer {{was not included in}} the preliminary quantitative anlyses of δ^ O, microparticles by Coulter counter, electrical conductivity, pH and major ions, of which 50 cm length samples were taken at 2 m intervals all through the core (O. WATANABE et al.; JARE Data Rep., 181 (Glaciology 20), 79 p., 1992). Most of the ash layer has been kept for detailed analyses using more sophisticated techniques in the near future. Recently, preliminary analyses of the ash by a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and also by energy dispersive spectra (EDS) have been done as presented here. Several grams of ice were taken from a depth of 500. 665 - 500. 700 m where the ash concentration was visibly thick. The sample was cut and melted in the same way as we adopted in our SEM observations of microparticles contained in medium depth ice cores retrieved in Queen Maud Land, Antarctica (A. HIGASHI et al.; Bull. Glacier Res., 8, 1, 1990). Volcanic ash particles were collected on a Nucleo filter by filtering the melt water through it, and its small portion was adhered on a specimen holder of a SEM and coated with evaporated carbon in vacuum. The SEM is a JSM-T 220,JEOL, attached to a QX- 2000,Link for the EDS analysis. For the quantitative elemental analysis using EDS, a cobalt standard and ZAF 4 program were used. Several particles which look like vesicular tephra or volcanic glass shard in SEM photographs were analyzed quantitatively by EDS. Computed data of oxides plotted on a diagram of Na_ 2 O+K_ 2 O vs. SiO_ 2 show that the present {{volcanic ash}} belongs to the non-alkaline area in the diagram. Compared with data of other ashes found in bare ice areas in the Yamato Mountains (T. KATSUSHIMA et al.; Mem. NIPR, Spec. Issue, 34, 174, 1984) and at 100. 8 m depth of the Vostok core and 303. 44 m depth of the South Pole core (J. M. PALAIS et al.; Geophys. Res. Lett., 19, 801, 1987) on the same diagram, it is concluded that the present ash orignated from South Sandwich Island. J. M. PALAIS et al. (ibid, 1987) estimated the age of ice, both at 100. 8 m depth of the Vostok-and 303. 44 m depth of the South pole core as 3200 BP from the accumulation rates, and concluded that ashes in both cores are correlated. Our esimate of 500. 7 m depth of the Mizuho core is approximately 6000 years BP from the depth-age relationship obtained by M. NAKAWO et al. (Proc. NIPR Symp. Polar Meteorol. Glaciol., 2, 105, 1989).

The segment integration and Pyle’s exponential methods gave similar values. The single isopach method, however, gave {{a wide range}} of results depending on which contour was used. Therefore, the total discharged mass of the 2014 eruption is estimated at between 8.9  ×  105 and 1.2  ×  106  t. More than 90  % of the total mass accumulated within the proximal area. This shows {{how important it is to}} include a proximal area field survey for the total mass estimation of phreatic <b>eruptions.</b> A <b>detailed</b> isopleth mass distribution map was prepared covering as far as 85  km from the source. The main ash-fall dispersal was ENE in the proximal and medial areas and E in the distal area. The secondary distribution lobes also extended to the S and NW proximally, reflecting the effects of elutriation ash and surge deposits from pyroclastic density currents during the phreatic eruption. The total discharged mass of the 1979 phreatic eruption was also calculated for comparison. The resulting volume of 1.9  ×  106  t (using the segment integration method) indicates that it was about 1.6 – 2.1 times larger than the 2014 eruption. The estimated average discharged mass flux rate of the 2014 eruption was 1.7  ×  108  kg/h and for the 1979 eruption was 1.0  ×  108  kg/h. One of the possible reasons for the higher flux rate of the 2014 eruption is the occurrence of pyroclastic density currents at the summit area.|$|R
40|$|Andesite lavas {{from the}} current {{eruption}} of the Soufrière Hills Volcano, Montserrat exhibit evidence for magma mingling, related to the intrusion of mafic magma at depth. The processes of mass transfer and flux of material involved in the interaction between mafic and silicic magmas are crucial for understanding <b>eruption</b> dynamics. <b>Detailed</b> textural, petrological and geochemical analyses coupled with field observations are used to define a classification scheme for mafic enclave types in erupted andesite from phase V (2009 – 2010). Type A are closest to a mafic end-member, whereas type B are significantly hybridised. Type A quench crystallisation is driven by rapid thermal equilibration during injection into the andesite. Type B enclaves form from a slower cooling vesiculating hybridised melt layer. Type C, are a composite of types A and types B, representing an interface between the types. Geochemical modelling shows that {{since the start of}} the current eruption that the dominant control on the range of enclave bulk compositions has changed from fractional crystallisation to mixing of the mafic end-member and host andesite. A change in selected elements concentrations in the mafic end-member is observed from phases I to III, halting in phase V. Volatile flux from the mafic to andesite magmas plays a vital role in eruption dynamics, but evidence for vapour transport in the erupted lavas is rarely preserved. Geochemical and petrological evidence is presented for the segregation and transport of metal-bearing vapour in shear fractures generated in the shallow conduit or dome during magma ascent. Elevated metal concentrations (Cu, Au, Ag, Pb, Zn) indicate magmatic vapours transport. Volatiles were resorbed into the partial melt generated during frictional heating (> 1000 °C) at the slip surface as a peraluminous partial melt recrystallised.

Volcanism was concentrated in epochs of intense activity, alternating to periods of quiescence. The I epoch lasted from 12, 000 to 9500 years BP giving rise to 34 explosive eruptions, each every 70 years on average. During the II epoch, dated between 8600 and 8200 years BP, six explosive eruptions took place at an average interval of 65 years. The III epoch lasted from 4800 to 3800 years BP and produced 16 explosive and four effusive eruptions which followed each other at mean intervals of 50 years. Eruption vents of the I epoch were located mostly along the marginal faults of the Neapolitan Yellow Tuff caldera, while those of the II epoch aligned on the northeastern sector of this margin. During the III epoch volcanism was confined in the northeastern sector of the Neapolitan Yellow Tuff caldera floor. The caldera floor is disjointed in blocks with variable vertical movements by fault and fracture systems mainly trending NE–SW and NW–SE.

We have studied the evolution of photospheric magnetic flux leading to ten observed filament eruptions. Specifically, we look for gradual magnetic changes in the neighborhood of the PIL prior to and during eruption. We use Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) images from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA), and magnetograms from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI), both on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), to study filament eruptions and their photospheric magnetic fields. We examine whether flux cancellation or/and emergence leads to filament eruptions. We find that continuous flux cancellation was present at the PIL for many hours prior to each eruption. We present two CME-producing <b>eruptions</b> in <b>detail</b> and find the following: (a) the pre-eruption filament-holding core field is highly sheared and appears {{in the shape of a}} sigmoid above the PIL; (b) at the start of the eruption the opposite arms of the sigmoid reconnect in the middle above the site of (tether-cutting) flux cancellation at the PIL; (c) the filaments first show a slow-rise, followed by a fast-rise as they erupt. We conclude that these two filament eruptions result from flux cancellation in the middle of the sheared field, and thereafter evolve in agreement with the standard model for a CME/flare filament eruption from a closed bipolar magnetic field [flux cancellation (van Ballegooijen and Martens 1989 and Moore and Roumelrotis 1992) and runaway tether-cutting (Moore et. al 2001) ]...|$|R
40|$|Our Sun is a dynamic, ever-changing star. In general, its {{atmosphere}} displays major {{variation on}} an 11 -year cycle. Throughout the cycle, the atmosphere occasionally exhibits large, sudden outbursts of energy. These "solar eruptions" manifest {{themselves in the}} form of solar flares, filament eruptions, coronal mass ejections (CMEs), and energetic particle releases. They are of high interest to scientists both because they represent fundamental processes that occur in various astrophysical context, and because, if directed toward Earth, they can disrupt Earth-based systems and satellites. Research over the last few decades has shown that the source of the eruptions is localized regions of energy-storing magnetic field on the Sun that become destabilized, leading to a release of the stored energy. Solar scientists have (probably) unraveled the basic outline of what happens in these <b>eruptions,</b> but many <b>details</b> are still not understood. In recent years we have been studying what triggers these magnetic eruptions, using ground-based and satellite-based solar observations in combination with predictions from various theoretical models. We will present an overview of solar activity and solar eruptions, give results from some of our own research, and discuss questions that remain to be explored...|$|R
40|$|Geodetic {{surveying}} is a core volcano monitoring technique. Measurements of how {{the crust}} deforms can give valuable insight into the mechanisms and processes that drive an eruption, {{and the way in}} which they change. Various geodetic observables, including ground deformation and gravity changes, have been recorded on Montserrat throughout the eruption. Instrumentation and surveying networks used to make such measurements have evolved significantly since 1995, providing increasingly accurate and robust observations. The detailed research that has been facilitated by these rich geodetic datasets has illuminated many aspects of the Soufrière Hills Volcano (SHV) and demonstrated eruptive mechanisms that are relevant to the study of other volcanoes. We have compiled a history of the geodetic study of the <b>eruption</b> on Montserrat, <b>detailing</b> the development of surveying techniques, network design and data processing since 1995. We then underline some of the key geodetic observations and review some of the most significant research that has contributed to our understanding of this volcanic system. Finally, we apply a series of typical deformation inversion models to deformation observations, and discuss the parameter sensitivity of such modelling approaches and how confidently they can be applied to identify the characteristics of the mechanisms feeding the eruption...|$|R
40|$|The 2001 and 2002 – 2003 flank eruptions on Mount Etna (Italy) were {{characterized}} by intense explosive activity {{which led to the}} formation of two large monogenetic scoria cones (one from each eruption) on the upper southern flank of the volcano. Continuous monitoring of Etna, especially during flank <b>eruptions,</b> has provided <b>detailed</b> information on the growth of these cones. They differ in genesis, shape, and size. A set of high resolution (1 m) digital elevation models (DEMs) derived from light detection and ranging (LIDAR) data collected during four different surveys (2004, 2005, 2006, and 2007) has been used to map morphology and to extract the morphometric parameters of the scoria cones. By comparing LIDAR-derived DEMs with a pre-eruption (1998) 10 m DEM, the volume of the two scoria cones was calculated for the first time. Comparison of the LIDAR-derived DEMs revealed in unprecedented detail morphological changes during scoria cone degradation. In particular, the morphologically more exposed and structurally weaker 2002 – 2003 cone was eroded rapidly during the first few years after its emplacement mainly due to gravitational instability of slopes and wind erosion...|$|R
40|$|The in situ {{observation}} of conduit processes {{as well as}} eruption dynamics during major Plinian eruptions is still impossible, however, understanding these processes is essential to enhance hazard mitigation and risk reduction near active volcanoes. Here {{we set out to}} reconstruct the conditions in the conduit during Plinian <b>eruptions</b> through a <b>detailed</b> analysis of the fall deposits of two major Plinian eruptions (Minoan eruption as the chemically homogeneous and the Plinian phases of the Laacher See eruption as chemically heterogeneous endmember) focussing on the stratigraphic variation of deposit structures (granulometry, modal composition, clast shape parameters) and pumice textures (clast density, permeability, vesicle size distribution) in combination with chemical data and intensive parameters. Changes in the aforementioned parameters reflect changing transport conditions like the granulometric data of the fall deposit being an indicator for fragmentation and eruption intensity or the acceleration of the melt being controlled by degassing that is mirrored in the pumice density and vesicle size distribution. The data collected by means of various methods and their simultaneous interpretation demonstrates that deposit structure and pumice texture are indeed a powerful tool to constrain and reconstruct the temporal variation of conduit flow and eruption dynamics during major Plinian eruptions. It was found that the chemically homogeneous deposits are much easier to invert for conduit flow processes and eruptions dynamics because viscosity is a major factor controlling transport properties of the melt. With the viscosity being fixed parameters like conduit geometry, or shifting of the fragmentation horizon can be constrained much better...|$|R
40|$|Acquiring <b>detailed</b> <b>eruption</b> {{frequency}} datasets for {{a volcano}} {{system is essential}} for realistic eruption forecasts. However, accurate datasets are inherently difficult to compile, even if one or more well-dated eruption records are available. A single record typically under-represents the eruption frequency, while combining two or more records may result in an overrepresentation. Although glass compositions {{have proven to be}} successful in tephrochronological studies of dominantly rhyolitic tephras; microlitic growth and thin glass shards inhibit their application to andesitic tephras. A method consisting of a combination of two techniques for correlating syn-eruptive deposits is demonstrated on data from the typical andesitic stratovolcano of Mt. Taranaki, New Zealand. Firstly, tentative matches are identified using the radiocarbon age and associated error of each event. Secondly, the compositions of titanomagnetite micro-phenocrysts are used as an independent check, and shown to be a useful correlation tool where age data is available. Using two lake-core records containing tephra layers in an overlapping time-frame, the radiocarbon age-correlation procedure suggested 31 tephra matches. Geochemistry data were available for 15 of these pairs. In three of these cases, the titanomagnetite compositions did not match. Hence, these "paired" t ephras were from compositionally distinct magmas and therefore likely represent separate events. An additional three matches were reassigned within the temporal uncertainty limits of the dating procedure, based on better geochemical pairing. The final combined dataset suggests that there have been at least 138 separate ash fall-producing eruptions between 96 and 10 150 years B. P. from Taranaki. Using the combined dataset the mixture of Weibulls renewal model forecasts a probability of 0. 52 for an eruption occurring in the next 50 years at this volcano. The present annual eruption probability is estimated at 1. 6 %. This likelihood is almost double that obtained when relying on a single stratigraphic record. 16 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Copyright 2000 by the American Geophysical UnionVailulu'u Seamount is {{identified}} as an active volcano marking the current location of the Samoan hotspot. This seamount is located 45 km east of Ta'u Island, Samoa, at 169 ° 03. 5 ′W, 14 ° 12. 9 ′S. Vailulu'u defines the easternmost edge of the Samoan Swell, rising from the 5000 ‐m ocean floor to a summit depth of 590 m and marked by a 400 ‐m‐deep and 2 ‐km‐wide summit crater. Its broad western rift and stellate morphology brand it as a juvenile progeny of Ta'u. Seven dredges, ranging from the summit to the SE Rift zone at 4200 m, recovered only alkali basalts and picrites. Isotopically, the volcano is strongly EM 2 in character and clearly of Samoan pedigree (⁸⁷Sr/⁸⁶Sr: 0. 7052 – 0. 7067; ¹⁴³Nd/¹⁴⁴Nd: 0. 51267 – 0. 51277; ²⁰⁶Pb/²⁰⁴Pb: 19. 19 – 19. 40). The ²¹⁰Po‐²¹⁴Pb data on two summit basalts indicate ages younger than 50 years; all of the recovered rocks are extremely fresh and veneered with glass. An earthquake swarm in early 1995 may attest to a recent <b>eruption</b> cycle. A <b>detailed</b> nephelometry survey of the water column shows clear evidence for hydrothermal plume activity in the summit crater. The water inside the crater is very turbid (nephelometric turbidity unit (NTU) values up to 1. 4), and a halo of “smog” several hundred meters thick encircles and extends away from the summit for at least 7 km. The turbid waters are highly enriched in manganese (up to 7. 3 nmol/kg), providing further evidence of hydrothermal activity. Vailulu'u is similar to Loihi (Hawaii) in being an active volcanic construct at {{the eastern end of}} a hotspot chain; it differs importantly from the Hawaiian model in its total lack of tholeiitic basalt compositions...|$|R
40|$|Volcanic hazards {{assessment}} tools {{are essential for}} risk mitigation of volcanic activities. A number of offline volcanic hazard {{assessment tools}} have been provided, but in most cases, they require relatively complex installation procedure and usage. This situation causes limited usage of volcanic hazard assessment tools among volcanologists and volcanic hazards communities. In addition, volcanic <b>eruption</b> chronology and <b>detailed</b> database of each volcano {{in the world are}} essential key information for volcanic hazard assessment, but most of them are isolated and not connected to and with each other. The Volcanic Hazard Assessment Support System aims to implement a user-friendly, WebGIS-based, open-access online system for potential hazards assessment and risk-mitigation of Quaternary volcanoes in the world. The users can get up-to-date information such as eruption chronology and geophysical monitoring data of a specific volcano using the direct link system to major volcano databases on the system. Currently, the system provides 3 simple, powerful and notable deterministic modeling simulation codes of volcanic processes, such as Energy Cone, Titan 2 D and Tephra 2. The system provides deterministic tools because probabilistic assessment tools are normally much more computationally demanding. By using the volcano hazard assessment system, the area that would be affected by volcanic eruptions in any location near the volcano can be estimated using numerical simulations. The system is being implemented using the ASTER Global DEM covering 2790 Quaternary volcanoes in the world. The system can be used to evaluate volcanic hazards and move this toward risk-potential by overlaying the estimated distribution of volcanic gravity flows or tephra falls on major roads, houses and evacuation areas using the GIS-enabled systems. The system is developed for all users in the world who need volcanic hazards assessment tools...|$|R
40|$|From December 2002 to July 2003, Stromboli volcano was {{characterized}} by a new effusive stage of eruption {{after a period of}} extraordinary strombolian activity. Signals recorded in two continuous monitoring stations during the eruption, which have already been presented in very recent papers, evidenced anomalies in the CO 2 flux just before the onset of the <b>eruption.</b> A more <b>detailed</b> analysis carried out on the data subset acquired during the eruption, integrated by daily field observations of the scientific personnel working at the volcanological observatory in Stromboli, showed that CO 2 flux and soil temperature are strictly related to volcanic events. Furthermore, the relative minima and maxima of the two parameters showed a strong correlation with wind speed and direction. This fact was especially true at the summit station, whereas at the coastal sites seasonal and meteorological effects masked the volcanic signal. The analysis of the wind data, particularly the relationships between wind speed and direction, air and soil temperature, and local circulation of atmospheric air masses revealed that during the eruption, in the summit area of Stromboli air movements were not only related to atmospheric circulation but were also significantly affected, and in certain cases caused, by volcanic activity. This conclusion was reached by observing several anomalies, such as the discrepancies in the wind direction between the two stations, higher air temperatures at the summit site, and inversion of direction for wind before and after the reopening of the conduit in a major explosion on 5 April 2003. The relationships found between volcanic activity, soil temperatures, CO 2 fluxes, and wind speed and direction indicate that soil temperature measurements, in an open conduit volcano such as in this case, could be used to monitor the level of volcanic activity, along with CO 2 flux. Furthermore, the possible volcanic origin of a peculiar type of air circulation identified in the summit area of Stromboli suggests that the separation between volcanic and atmospheric signals might not be obvious, requiring monitoring over a wide area, rather than a single location...|$|R
40|$|We have {{performed}} a parametric {{study on the}} dynamics of trachytic (alkaline) versus rhyolitic (calc-alkaline) eruptions by employing a steady, isothermal, multiphase non-equilibrium model of conduit flow and fragmentation. The employed compositions correspond to a typical rhyolite and to trachytic liquids from Phlegrean Fields <b>eruptions,</b> for which <b>detailed</b> viscosity measurements have been performed. The investigated conditions include conduit diameters in the range 30 – 90 m and total water contents from 2 to 6 wt%, corresponding to mass flow rates in the range 106 – 108 kg/s. The numerical results show that rhyolites fragment deep in the conduit and at a gas volume fraction ranging from 0. 64 to 0. 76, while for trachytes fragmentation is found to occur at much shallower levels and higher vesicularities (0. 81 – 0. 85). An unexpected result is that low-viscosity trachytes {{can be associated with}} lower mass flow rates with respect to more viscous rhyolites. This is due to the non-linear combined effects of viscosity and water solubility affecting the whole eruption dynamics. The lower viscosity of trachytes, together with higher water solubility, results in delayed fragmentation, or in a longer bubbly flow region within the conduit where viscous forces are dominant. Therefore, the total dissipation due to viscous forces can be higher for the less viscous trachytic magma, depending on the specific conditions and trachytic composition employed. The fragmentation conditions determined through the simulations agree with measured vesicularities in natural pumice clasts of both magma compositions. In fact, vesicularities average 0. 80 in pumice from alkaline eruptions at Phlegrean Fields, while they tend to be lower in most calc-alkaline pumices. The results of numerical simulations suggest that higher vesicularities in alkaline products are related to delayed fragmentation of magmas with this composition. Despite large differences in the distribution of flow variables which occur in the deep conduit region and at fragmentation, the flow dynamics of rhyolites and trachytes in the upper conduit and at the vent can be very similar, at equal conduit size and total water content. This is consistent with similar phenomenologies of eruptions associated with the two magma types...|$|R
