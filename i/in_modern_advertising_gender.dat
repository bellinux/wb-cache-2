5000|$|Despite the title, an {{advertising}} art director {{is not necessarily}} the head of an art department. <b>In</b> <b>modern</b> <b>advertising</b> practice, an art director typically works in tandem with a copywriter and are typically known as a creative team. They work together to devise an overall concept (also known as the [...] "creative" [...] or [...] "big idea") for the commercial, mailer, brochure, or other advertisement. The copywriter is responsible for the textual content, the art director for the visual aspects. But the art director may come up with the headline or other copy, and the copywriter may suggest a visual or the aesthetic approach. Each person usually welcomes suggestions and constructive criticism from the other. The process of collaboration often improves the work. Ideally, the words and visual should not parrot each other; each should enhance or enlarge the other's meaning and effect.|$|R

40|$|Background: Advertising {{communication}} {{tends to}} shorten {{the use of the}} language means. This characteristic explains the deliberate usage of such linguistic constructions that primarily influence the potential consumer. The role of advertising has increased <b>in</b> the <b>modern</b> world. Its strengthening intensifies the interest in the study of this social phenomenon among the scientists in various fields. The relevance of the study is obvious {{due to the fact that}} the issues of verbal influence on the recipient remains unexplored <b>in</b> <b>modern</b> Ukrainian linguistics. Purpose: clarifying the role of manipulative formulas in pragmatic implementation of advertisement guidelines. Results: This article makes an attempt to define and describe a set of basic communicative and pragmatic properties <b>in</b> <b>modern</b> <b>advertising</b> texts. The research represents main communicative and speech characteristics of advertising texts. The author analyzes the role of evaluation in producing the impact of communicative effect on the recipient. Also it reveals the efficiency of using impact-oriented language means in advertising texts.

At this level, we can establish the interdependent exponential relation between <b>modern</b> print <b>advertising</b> discourse, treated in terms of space conceptual model of representation, and its meaning comprehension process, emphasizing its optimal relevance...|$|R

40|$|Due to its {{communicative}} specifics studying {{of modern}} printed discourse of advertising basing {{on the theory}} of emotivity is of special interest to the scientists. The manifestation and expression of emotions {{in the context of}} advertising communication is an intention of the author of the advertisement message to cause a specific emotional reaction from the recipient (target audience), to influence her/him in a sought way.

Basing on methodology of linguistics of emotion, linguoecology, communicative linguistics and methods of pragmatic, discursive, comparative, cross-cultural analysis we have allocated emotional/ emotive representations pragmatic orientation of which correlates with the extent of emotional openness or restraint of the participants of the discourse of advertising, touches upon the field of social norms of emotional behavior and is determined by national cultural specifics.

40|$|Despite its long-standing {{history and}} many strong findings, {{research}} on advertising effectiveness still ranks {{high on the}} academic and practitioner agenda. With respect {{to the influence of}} advertising on sales, existing econometric response models mostly focus on the impact of advertising spending and scheduling. Comparatively less attention has been devoted to the specific advertising content. Even though, choosing appropriate content cues that grab consumers’ attention and persuade them becomes more and more important due to the increasingly cluttered media environment and consumers’ limited attention span. The dissertation at hand thus investigates how selected content cues affect advertising effectiveness. The first two papers empirically examine the moderating influence of content cues on the relationship between advertising spending and sales. Specifically, the first paper explores how firms should communicate their brands in TV advertising. The authors evaluate 17 branding cues (e. g., frequency of mentions of the brand name, duration of time the logo appears, number of communicated benefits), which are commonly used within advertising that should reinforce branding components (salience, benefits, and attributes) and investigate their influence on ad effectiveness. The second paper focuses on the impact of authenticity, one of the most prevalent buzzwords <b>in</b> the <b>modern</b> <b>advertising</b> industry. The authors identify four dimensions by which authenticity can be conveyed in advertising and analyze their effects on the sales performance of advertised products. Both empirical studies are based on a unique dataset of multiple advertisings and brands across six fast-moving consumer good categories and four years. Finally, the third paper develops a conceptual framework that structures and classifies different content cues, provides an overview of the relevant literature, and identifies several literature gaps. ...|$|R
