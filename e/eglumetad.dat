50|$|Structurally, LY-404,039 {{is a close}} {{relative}} to other mGluR2/3 orthosteric agonists <b>eglumetad,</b> LY-379,268, LY-389,795, and MGS-008, {{all of which are}} members of the bicyclohexane family. LY-404,039 was the preferred drug candidate for further development due to its antipsychotic efficacy and lack of motor coordination effects at doses up to 30 mg/kg.|$|E
50|$|LY-2140023 was {{identified}} using the analogous peptide prodrug approach used previously for talaglumetad, the prodrug of <b>eglumetad.</b> Synthesis {{was the result}} of preparation of LY-389795 followed by oxidation to LY-404,039 and coupling with L-methionine. LY-2140023 uses a human peptide transporter and hydrolytic pathways to deliver LY-404,039 to systemic circulation in humans. It is rapidly absorbed and hydrolyzed to produce active LY-404,039 (~70% conversion), increasing its estimated bioavailability to 49%. In humans, use of LY-2140023 resulted in significantly higher plasma levels of LY-404,039 compared with oral administration of LY-404039. LY-2140023 appears to be an inactive prodrug, as K values for the drug {{have been found to be}} greater than 100 ÂµM.|$|E
