5|$|A {{tessellation}} of a {{flat surface}} is the tiling of a plane using one or more geometric shapes, called tiles, with no overlaps and no gaps. In mathematics, tessellations can be generalized to higher dimensions {{and a variety of}} <b>geometries.</b>|$|E

5|$|Simulating the geodynamo {{requires}} numerically {{solving a}} set of nonlinear partial differential equations for the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) of the Earth's interior. Simulation of the MHD equations is performed on a 3D grid of points and the fineness of the grid, which in part determines the realism of the solutions, is limited mainly by computer power. For decades, theorists were confined to creating kinematic dynamo computer models in which the fluid motion is chosen in advance and {{the effect on the}} magnetic field calculated. Kinematic dynamo theory was mainly a matter of trying different flow <b>geometries</b> and testing whether such <b>geometries</b> could sustain a dynamo.|$|E
50|$|Discrete <b>geometry</b> {{has a large}} {{overlap with}} convex <b>geometry</b> and {{computational}} <b>geometry,</b> and {{is closely related to}} subjects such as finite <b>geometry,</b> combinatorial optimization, digital <b>geometry,</b> discrete differential <b>geometry,</b> geometric graph theory, toric <b>geometry,</b> and combinatorial topology.|$|R
5000|$|Ordered <b>geometry</b> {{is a form}} of <b>geometry</b> {{featuring}} the concept of intermediacy (or [...] "betweenness") but, like projective <b>geometry,</b> omitting the basic notion of measurement. Ordered <b>geometry</b> is a fundamental <b>geometry</b> forming a common framework for affine, Euclidean, absolute, and hyperbolic <b>geometry</b> (but not for projective <b>geometry).</b>|$|R
5000|$|In mathematics, {{hyperbolic}} <b>geometry</b> (also called Bolyai-Lobachevskian <b>geometry</b> or Lobachevskian <b>geometry)</b> is a non-Euclidean <b>geometry.</b> The parallel postulate of Euclidean <b>geometry</b> {{is replaced}} with: ...|$|R
5|$|An {{important}} parameter {{determining the}} future {{evolution of the}} Universe theory is the density parameter, Omega (Ω), defined as the average matter density of the universe divided by a critical value of that density. This selects one of three possible <b>geometries</b> depending on whether Ω is equal to, less than, or greater than 1. These are called, respectively, the flat, open and closed universes.|$|E
5|$|Geometry was {{a second}} field in which groups were used systematically, {{especially}} symmetry groups as part of Felix Klein's 1872 Erlangen program. After novel <b>geometries</b> such as hyperbolic and projective geometry had emerged, Klein used group theory to organize them in a more coherent way. Further advancing these ideas, Sophus Lie founded the study of Lie groups in 1884.|$|E
5|$|Immobile Holliday junctions, with {{asymmetrical}} sequences that {{lock the}} strands {{in a specific}} position, were artificially created by scientists to study their structure {{as a model for}} natural Holliday junctions. These junctions also later found use as basic structural building blocks in DNA nanotechnology, where multiple Holliday junctions can be combined into specific designed <b>geometries</b> that provide molecules {{with a high degree of}} structural rigidity.|$|E
50|$|Absolute <b>geometry</b> is an {{extension}} of ordered <b>geometry,</b> and thus, all theorems in ordered <b>geometry</b> hold in absolute <b>geometry.</b> The converse is not true. Absolute <b>geometry</b> assumes the first four of Euclid's Axioms (or their equivalents), to be contrasted with affine <b>geometry,</b> which does not assume Euclid's third and fourth axioms. Ordered <b>geometry</b> is a common foundation of both absolute and affine <b>geometry.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{classical}} mathematics, analytic <b>geometry,</b> {{also known}} as coordinate <b>geometry,</b> or Cartesian <b>geometry,</b> {{is the study of}} <b>geometry</b> using a coordinate system. This contrasts with synthetic <b>geometry.</b>|$|R
50|$|In mathematics, convex <b>geometry</b> is {{the branch}} of <b>geometry</b> {{studying}} convex sets, mainly in Euclidean space. Convex sets occur naturally in many areas: computational <b>geometry,</b> convex analysis, discrete <b>geometry,</b> functional analysis, <b>geometry</b> of numbers, integral <b>geometry,</b> linear programming, probability theory, etc.|$|R
5|$|It is {{possible}} to tessellate in non-Euclidean <b>geometries</b> such as hyperbolic geometry. A uniform tiling in the hyperbolic plane (which may be regular, quasiregular or semiregular) is an edge-to-edge filling of the hyperbolic plane, with regular polygons as faces; these are vertex-transitive (transitive on its vertices), and isogonal (there is an isometry mapping any vertex onto any other).|$|E
5|$|Regularity {{and order}} are common {{features}} in Toraja wood carving (see table below), {{as well as}} abstracts and geometrical designs. Nature is frequently {{used as the basis}} of Toraja's ornaments, because nature is full of abstractions and <b>geometries</b> with regularities and ordering. Toraja's ornaments have been studied in ethnomathematics to reveal their mathematical structure, but Torajans base this art only on approximations. To create an ornament, bamboo sticks are used as a geometrical tool.|$|E
5|$|Some tetracoordinate nickel(II) complexes, e.g. bis(triphenylphosphine)nickel chloride, exist both in {{tetrahedral}} {{and square}} planar <b>geometries.</b> The tetrahedral complexes are paramagnetic, whereas the square planar complexes are diamagnetic. In having properties of magnetic equilibrium and formation of octahedral complexes, they {{contrast with the}} divalent complexes of the heavier group 10 metals, palladium(II) and platinum(II), which form only square-planar geometry.|$|E
50|$|In {{traditional}} <b>geometry,</b> affine <b>geometry</b> {{is considered}} to be a study between Euclidean <b>geometry</b> and projective <b>geometry.</b> On the one hand, affine <b>geometry</b> is Euclidean <b>geometry</b> with congruence left out; on the other hand, affine <b>geometry</b> may be obtained from projective <b>geometry</b> by the designation of a particular line or plane to represent the points at infinity. In affine <b>geometry,</b> there is no metric structure but the parallel postulate does hold. Affine <b>geometry</b> provides the basis for Euclidean structure when perpendicular lines are defined, or the basis for Minkowski <b>geometry</b> through the notion of hyperbolic orthogonality. In this viewpoint, an affine transformation <b>geometry</b> is a group of projective transformations that do not permute finite points with points at infinity.|$|R
25|$|Elliptic <b>geometry</b> is a <b>geometry</b> {{in which}} Euclid's {{parallel}} postulate does not hold. Elliptic <b>geometry</b> is studied in two, three, or more dimensions. The appearance of this <b>geometry</b> {{in the nineteenth}} century stimulated the development of non-Euclidean <b>geometry</b> generally, including hyperbolic <b>geometry.</b>|$|R
50|$|When geometers first {{realised}} {{they were}} working with {{something other than the}} standard Euclidean <b>geometry</b> they described their <b>geometry</b> under many different names; Felix Klein finally gave the subject the name hyperbolic <b>geometry</b> to include it in the now rarely used sequence elliptic <b>geometry</b> (spherical <b>geometry),</b> parabolic <b>geometry</b> (Euclidean <b>geometry),</b> and hyperbolic geometry.In Russia it is commonly called Lobachevskian <b>geometry,</b> named after one of its discoverers, the Russian geometer Nikolai Lobachevsky.|$|R
5|$|The same triad <b>geometries</b> been converged upon by serine proteases {{such as the}} {{chymotrypsin}} and subtilisin superfamilies. Similar convergent {{evolution has}} occurred with cysteine proteases such as viral C3 protease and papain superfamilies. These triads have converged to almost the same arrangement due to the mechanistic similarities in cysteine and serine proteolysis mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|Von Neumann {{founded the}} field of {{continuous}} geometry based on lattice theoretic principles. Earlier, Menger and Birkhoff had axiomatized complex projective geometry {{in terms of the}} properties of its lattice of linear subspaces. Von Neumann, following his work on rings of operators, weakened those axioms to describe a broader class of lattices, the continuous <b>geometries.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, several theorists {{generalized}} Montonen–Olive duality to the S-duality relationship, which connects different string theories. Ashoke Sen studied S-duality in {{the context}} of heterotic strings in four dimensions. Chris Hull and Paul Townsend showed that type IIB string theory with a large coupling constant is equivalent via S-duality to the same theory with small coupling constant. Theorists also found that different string theories may be related by T-duality. This duality implies that strings propagating on completely different spacetime <b>geometries</b> may be physically equivalent.|$|E
25|$|In {{classical}} mathematics, analytic <b>geometry,</b> {{also known}} as coordinate <b>geometry,</b> or in a common manifestation Cartesian <b>geometry,</b> {{is the study of}} <b>geometry</b> using a coordinate system. This contrasts with synthetic <b>geometry.</b>|$|R

25|$|In three dimensions, {{there are}} eight models of <b>geometries.</b> There are Euclidean, elliptic, and {{hyperbolic}} <b>geometries,</b> as in the two-dimensional case; mixed <b>geometries</b> that are partially Euclidean and partially hyperbolic or spherical; twisted versions of the mixed geometries; and one unusual geometry that is completely anisotropic (i.e. every direction behaves differently).|$|E
25|$|In the <b>geometries</b> {{where the}} concept of a line is a {{primitive}} notion, as may be the case in some synthetic <b>geometries,</b> other methods of determining collinearity are needed.|$|E
50|$|Euclidean <b>geometry</b> is {{the study}} of <b>geometry</b> that {{satisfies}} all of Euclid's axioms, including the parallel postulate. A <b>geometry</b> where the parallel postulate does not hold is known as a non-Euclidean <b>geometry.</b> <b>Geometry</b> that is independent of Euclid's fifth postulate (i.e., only assumes the modern equivalent of the first four postulates) is known as absolute <b>geometry</b> (or, in other places known as neutral <b>geometry).</b>|$|R
40|$|From {{elementary}} school {{to high school}} we have been learning different types of <b>geometry.</b> Taxicab <b>geometry</b> {{is an example of}} non‐euclidean <b>geometry.</b> Although it has similar points with Euclidian <b>geometry,</b> it differs from Euclidian <b>geometry</b> in an area; in distance functions. I have decided to try a new <b>geometry.</b> So, I have found taxicab <b>geometry.</b> When I researched about taxicab <b>geometry,</b> I have asked myself that “Could I turn this <b>geometry</b> into three dimensions?” My research subject is “Taxicab <b>Geometry</b> in Three Dimensions”. In {{the first part of the}} essay, my reasons of choosing this subject and an explanation of taxicab <b>geometry</b> are briefly given. After this quick information in the second part I will be proving Taxicab <b>geometry</b> is a metric*. Third part involves Euclidian <b>geometry’s</b> theorems for distance and theorems that are highly related to distance functions in three dimensions are given. Also formulas for distance in two dimensional taxicab <b>geometry</b> are given a. Furthermore, these theorems are taken as reference points for converting taxicab <b>geometry</b> to three dimensions. Distance function in two dimensions is converted to third dimension in this part. In the fourth part, sphere and cylinder which belongs to Euclidian <b>geometry</b> are recreated by me in taxicab <b>geometry</b> using the formulas that are found in the third part. The last part of the essay is about applications of taxicab <b>geometry</b> “Taxicab <b>Geometry</b> in Three Dimensions”. The taxicab space’s part in daily life, city planning and in buildings is explained by an example. To conclude, I will try to find answer to the question “Is it possible to convert sphere and cylinder from three dimensional Euclidian <b>geometry</b> to three dimensional taxicab <b>geometry?...</b>|$|R
