5|$|Although {{they failed}} to achieve their objectives, by nightfall the ANZACs had formed a beachhead, albeit much smaller than intended. In places they were {{clinging}} onto cliff faces with no organised defence system. Their precarious position convinced both divisional commanders to ask for an evacuation, but after taking advice from the Royal Navy about how practicable that would be, the army commander <b>decided</b> <b>they</b> would stay.

5|$|The Swedish commanders had <b>decided</b> <b>they</b> {{must try}} to make a stand. A few {{kilometers}} west of Nyborg the Swedish forces of about 5,500 men stood in battle formation {{in the way of the}} advancing forces. The Swedes had a good position, with a small lake on the left flank and a forest on the right, providing good cover for a retreat to Nyborg should it be necessary. Opposing them were 9,000 men, with Eberstein in command that day. They divided into two lines, each commanded by the respective commanders. Thrice Eberstein attacked; only to be rebuffed by intensive Swedish fire and cavalry attacks. Eberstein himself was almost captured, only narrowly escaping.|$|E
5|$|After Houston {{received}} word that Santa Anna was leading a large force to San Antonio, Bowie offered to lead volunteers {{to defend the}} Alamo from the expected attack. He arrived with 30men on January 19, where they found a force of 104men with a few weapons and a few cannons, but not many supplies and little gunpowder. Houston {{knew that there were}} not enough men to hold the fort in an attack and had given Bowie authority to remove the artillery and blow up the fortification. Bowie and the Alamo commander, James C. Neill, <b>decided</b> <b>they</b> did not have enough oxen to move the artillery, and {{they did not want to}} destroy the fortress. On January 26, one of Bowie's men, James Bonham, organized a rally which passed a resolution in favor of holding the Alamo. Bonham signed the resolution first, with Bowie's signature second.|$|E
5|$|After Trespass was recorded, {{ill health}} and {{developing}} stage fright caused Phillips to leave Genesis. His last show {{with the band}} took place in Haywards Heath on 18 July 1970. He felt the increased number of gigs affected the group's creativity and that several songs he wrote were not recorded or performed live. He had contracted bronchial pneumonia and became isolated {{from the rest of}} the band, feeling that it had too many songwriters in it. Banks, Gabriel, and Rutherford saw Phillips as an important member, being the most instrumental in encouraging them to turn professional. They regarded his exit as the band's greatest threat and the most difficult to overcome. Gabriel and Rutherford <b>decided</b> <b>they</b> would continue; Banks agreed on the condition that they find a new drummer that was of equal stature to the rest of the group. Mayhew was therefore fired, though Phillips later thought Mayhew's working-class background clashed with the rest of the band which affected his confidence.|$|E

5|$|Artist and {{inventor}} Bill Lishman created two sculptures {{for this}} section of the park, as well as some smaller works for application to the buildings. The most prominent is a dragon {{at the entrance to the}} Dragon Fire, which had originally been intended to hold a sign, but the park management <b>decided</b> <b>they</b> liked it enough for it to be a standalone sculpture. Lishman was allowed to design it from scratch, as opposed to follow preset designs established before he was hired, taking him and assistant Richard Van Heuvelan two months to complete. The other main sculpture was the wild boar at Wild Beast, both this and the dragon being built at his home in Blackstock, Ontario, for about $75,000. Signs by Lishman included Sherwood Florist, Boo Boo's Buggys, an ice cream cone, and for a popcorn counter.|$|E
5|$|At 00:50, {{aircraft}} {{carrying the}} rest of the 6th Airborne Division appeared overhead and the paratroopers descended onto drop zones marked out by the pathfinders. Howard began blowing the morse code letter 'V' on his whistle, to help guide the 7th Parachute Battalion to the bridges. The first paratroops to arrive, at 00:52, were Brigadier Poett and the soldier he had picked up en route. Briefed by Howard on the situation, they heard tanks and lorries moving around in Bénouville and Le Port. On the drop zone, only about 100 men of the 7th Parachute Battalion had made it to the rallying point but all their signal equipment, machine guns and mortars were missing. Pine-Coffin, aware that his battalion was the only unit allocated defensive positions west of the bridges, <b>decided</b> <b>they</b> could not wait any longer and, at 01:10, left for the bridges.|$|E
5|$|By 1932, {{there was}} an {{increasing}} movement for government control. By mid-1934 when Cardinal Dougherty of Philadelphia called for a Catholic boycott of all films, and Raymond Cannon was privately preparing a congressional bill supported by both Democrats and Republicans which would introduce Government oversight, the studios <b>decided</b> <b>they</b> had had enough. They re-organized the enforcement procedures giving Hays and the recently appointed Joseph I. Breen, a devout Roman Catholic, {{head of the new}} Production Code Administration (PCA), greater control over censorship. The studios agreed to disband their appeals committee and to impose a $25,000 fine for producing, distributing, or exhibiting any film without PCA approval. Hays had originally hired Breen, who had worked in public relations, in 1930 to handle Production Code publicity, and the latter was popular among Catholics.* Jeff & Simmmons, pg. 55.* Ross, pg. 270. Joy began working solely for Fox Studios, and Wingate had been bypassed in favor of Breen in December 1933. Hays became a functionary, while Breen handled the business of censoring films.|$|E
