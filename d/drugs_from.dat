5|$|Approximately {{two weeks}} later on March 19, 2007, Sports Illustrated posted on its website another article in its {{continuing}} series investigating a steroid and HGH ring used {{by a number of}} professional athletes in several sports. That article mentioned that ten other professional wrestlers were implicated to have received performance-enhancing <b>drugs</b> <b>from</b> the same drug ring, including four WWE wrestlers and Eddie Guerrero. Angle never failed a drug test for pain pills, but he did fail a steroid test under WWE's Wellness Policy because his prescription for nandrolone had expired.|$|E
5|$|Plants serve many {{functions}} in culture. The reliable provision of food through agriculture {{is the basis}} of civilization. The study of plant uses by native peoples is ethnobotany, while economic botany focuses on modern cultivated plants. Plants are used in medicine, providing many <b>drugs</b> <b>from</b> the earliest times to the present, and as the feedstock for many industrial products including timber and paper as well as a wide range of chemicals. Plants give millions of people pleasure through gardening.|$|E
5|$|Trevor {{appears as}} a main {{character}} in Grand Theft Auto Online, the online multiplayer mode of Grand Theft Auto V. He provides missions to the player character once they reach Rank 13; after the player steals Trevor's rolling meth lab, Trevor demands that they are to complete jobs for him to settle the issue. The jobs that Trevor demands generally consist of stealing <b>drugs</b> <b>from</b> rival groups, specifically the Lost Motorcycle Club, while killing the dealers. The narrative of Grand Theft Auto Online is set several {{months prior to the}} events of the single-player story.|$|E

5|$|Aspirin {{is known}} to {{interact}} with other drugs. For example, acetazolamide and ammonium chloride are known to enhance the intoxicating effect of salicylates, and alcohol also increases the gastrointestinal bleeding associated with these types of drugs. Aspirin {{is known to}} displace a number of <b>drugs</b> <b>from</b> protein-binding sites in the blood, including the antidiabetic drugs tolbutamide and chlorpropamide, warfarin, methotrexate, phenytoin, probenecid, valproic acid (as well as interfering with beta oxidation, {{an important part of}} valproate metabolism), and other NSAIDs. Corticosteroids may also reduce the concentration of aspirin. Ibuprofen can negate the antiplatelet effect of aspirin used for cardioprotection and stroke prevention. The pharmacological activity of spironolactone may be reduced by taking aspirin, and it is known to compete with penicillin G for renal tubular secretion. Aspirin may also inhibit the absorption of vitamin C.|$|E
5|$|Faced {{with growing}} {{legal and illegal}} {{competition}} for the globally marketed ASA, Bayer worked to cement the connection between Bayer and Aspirin. One strategy it developed was to switch from distributing Aspirin powder for pharmacists to press into pill form to distributing standardized tablets—complete with the distinctive Bayer cross logo. In 1903 the company set up an American subsidiary, with a converted factory in Rensselaer, New York, to produce Aspirin for the American market without paying import duties. Bayer also sued the most egregious patent violators and smugglers. The company's attempts to hold onto its Aspirin sales incited criticism from muckraking journalists and the American Medical Association, especially after the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act that prevented trademarked <b>drugs</b> <b>from</b> being listed in the United States Pharmacopeia; Bayer listed ASA with an intentionally convoluted generic name (monoacetic acid ester of salicylic acid) to discourage doctors referring to anything but Aspirin.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Malawi's Ministry of Health and Population began {{developing}} {{a plan to}} distribute antiretroviral drugs to the population, and, as of 2003, there were several sites providing antiretroviral drugs in Malawi. The Lighthouse, a trust in Lilongwe that fights HIV/AIDS, provides antiretroviral drugs {{at a cost of}} 2,500 kwacha per month. Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre provides antiretroviral therapy through its outpatient department, and Médecins Sans Frontières distributes antiretroviral drugs to patients for free in the Chiradzulu and Thyolo Districts. Many different private providers sell antiretroviral drugs, particularly in cities; however, very few patients can afford to receive <b>drugs</b> <b>from</b> the private sector in Malawi. In addition, private providers are not currently required to obtain certification before selling antiretroviral drugs, and, therefore, this practice is not closely monitored. Finally, some employees receive access to antiretroviral drugs through the health insurance policies provided by their employers, but this practice is not widespread.|$|E

5|$|In New Jersey v. T. L. O. (1985), the Supreme Court {{ruled that}} {{searches}} {{in public schools}} do not require warrants, {{as long as the}} searching officers have reasonable grounds for believing that the search will result in the finding of evidence of illegal activity. However, in Safford Unified School District v. Redding (2009), the Court ruled that school officials violated the Fourth Amendment when they strip searched a 13-year-old girl based only on a student claiming to have received <b>drugs</b> <b>from</b> that student. Similarly, in Samson v. California (2006), the Court ruled that government offices may be searched for evidence of work-related misconduct by government employees on similar grounds. Searches of prison cells are subject to no restraints relating to reasonableness or probable cause.|$|E
5|$|Medication is {{available}} to help when symptoms interfere with functioning. The classes of medication with the most proven efficacy in treating tics—typical and atypical neuroleptics including risperidone (trade name Risperdal), ziprasidone (Geodon), haloperidol (Haldol), pimozide (Orap) and fluphenazine (Prolixin)—can have long-term and short-term adverse effects. The antihypertensive agents clonidine (trade name Catapres) and guanfacine (Tenex) are also used to treat tics; studies show variable efficacy, but a lower side effect profile than the neuroleptics. Stimulants and other medications {{may be useful in}} treating ADHD when it co-occurs with tic disorders. <b>Drugs</b> <b>from</b> several other classes of medications can be used when stimulant trials fail, including guanfacine (trade name Tenex), atomoxetine (Strattera) and tricyclic antidepressants. Clomipramine (Anafranil), a tricyclic, and SSRIs—a class of antidepressants including fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline (Zoloft), and fluvoxamine (Luvox)—may be prescribed when a Tourette's patient also has symptoms of obsessive–compulsive disorder. Several other medications have been tried, but evidence to support their use is unconvincing.|$|E
5|$|The {{place of}} plants in {{medicine}} was radically altered in the 19th century by {{the application of}} chemical analysis. Alkaloids were isolated from a succession of medicinal plants, starting with morphine from the poppy in 1806, and soon followed by ipecacuanha and strychnos in 1817, quinine from the cinchona tree, and then many others. As chemistry progressed, additional classes of pharmacologically active substances were discovered in medicinal plants. Commercial extraction of purified alkaloids including morphine from medicinal plants began at Merck in 1826. Synthesis of a substance first discovered in a medicinal plant began with salicylic acid in 1853. Around {{the end of the}} 19th century, the mood of pharmacy turned against medicinal plants, as enzymes often modified the active ingredients when whole plants were dried, and alkaloids and glycosides purified from plant material started to be preferred. Drug discovery from plants continued to be important through the 20th century and into the 21st, with important anti-cancer <b>drugs</b> <b>from</b> yew and Madagascar periwinkle.|$|E

When the captain gets drunk and falls overboard, Picasso takes the boat to Florida, and meets up with Jesus Castro, the lead drug smuggler. Castro intimidates Picasso into running the <b>drugs</b> <b>from</b> Miami to Boston, however after Picasso collects the $1.5 million payment from the Irish Republican Army, he escapes by train to the New England town of Tyburn, where a winter storm is picking up force. He decides to lodge at the seaside Admiral Benbow Inn for the weekend, until he can depart for Italy.|$|E
5|$|Fenmore was befriended by Carmine Basco (Marco Dapper), the {{man whom}} Lauren {{was having an}} affair with, while also trying to win over Summer again, who was {{crushing}} on Kyle Abbott (Hartley Sawyer). Fenmore asked Summer to their senior prom, and instead of going, Summer threw a party at her mother's penthouse. During a game of truth or dare, Fenmore was dared to kiss Summer, who had text messaged Kyle that she was in trouble. Kyle later punched Fenmore in the face; footage was caught on video and uploaded online, weakening Fenmore's social status. Afterward, he is befriended by Raven (Amanda Leighton); they go to a graduation party, do drugs and talk about their social struggles. When Fenmore discovers Carmine's affair with his mother, he isolates himself from his family and continues to do drugs. Afterward, he asks Carmine to help him obtain more drugs, and while he refuses, he finds Fenmore unconscious {{in the back of the}} local restaurant. When he awakens in the hospital, he tells his parents that Carmine gave him the drugs that he overdosed on, but he later confesses that this was a lie. After stealing <b>drugs</b> <b>from</b> the hospital and getting caught, Michael and Lauren send Fenmore to rehab. After being released for an event in which Lauren would be crowned businesswoman of the year, Carmine is shot to death in an alleyway. Fenmore is convinced he murdered Carmine but admits to being high on drugs at the time and can't remember clearly. Michael decides to confess to the murder to protect his family, and he is sent to prison. Knowing that his father did not kill Carmine, Fenmore steals drugs and purposely gets caught so he can be put in prison as well. While in prison, Fenmore tries to make deals with other prisoners to get his father's sentence reduced, as Paul Williams (Doug Davidson) and Christine Blair (Lauralee Bell) try to uncover the truth behind Carmine's death. Michael is later released after Fen confesses to killing Carmine, worrying his parents.|$|E
