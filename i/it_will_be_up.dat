500|$|One night, Mr. Nutt is fatally {{attacked}} by a creature. The agents eventually discover that the attacker is Lanny's twin, Leonard, {{who is able to}} detach himself from Lanny's body. According to Lanny, Leonard attacks people and attempts to burrow into them because he is looking for a new brother to replace Lanny, who is dying from liver failure due to years of alcohol abuse. Lanny voluntarily locks himself in the local jail {{in an effort to keep}} Leonard from escaping, but dies during the night, and Leonard is able to slip through the bars on the cell window and flee. Mulder and Scully try to capture Leonard, who goes inside a funhouse, but he manages to get away. Upon leaving the funhouse, they find The Conundrum lying on the ground, rubbing his stomach, apparently having eaten Leonard. As Dr. Blockhead prepares to leave town with The Conundrum the following morning, he comments to Scully that with modern science eradicating genetic anomalies, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>up</b> to self-made freaks like him to remind people that [...] "nature abhors normality." [...] The Conundrum looks unwell and Mulder asks what the matter is. The Conundrum [...] in his only line of the episode [...] replies, [...] "probably something I ate." [...] As Dr. Blockhead drives away with The Conundrum, Mulder and Scully turn to each other with confused and somewhat shocked expressions.|$|E

60|$|Behold, then, how mindful, how careful, how {{faithful}} our Father and the Lamb of God is! It is not exaltation, nor glory, nor a crown, nor a kingdom, nor a throne, that {{shall make}} him neglect his poor ones on earth.

And it shall proceed to be far higher than ever was the swellings of Jordan. True, it runs not so high now as in former days, because of the curse of God upon Antichrist, by whose means the land of God's people is full of briers and thorns (Isa 32:13-17).
