5|$|After {{resuming}} production, Navarro {{questioned the}} methods of the Chili Peppers' recording procedures. He wondered why such {{a considerable amount of}} jamming was involved with the album's conception. Various qualms followed, and the process soon became uncomfortable for the band.

He returned to <b>Hollywood</b> <b>in</b> late January 1995, when he finally finished recording his vocals. The rest of the recording was completed within the next month.|$|E
5|$|Although most of Wodehouse's {{fiction is}} set in England, {{he spent much of}} his life in the US and used New York and Hollywood as {{settings}} for some of his novels and short stories.

He began the 1930s writing for MGM in <b>Hollywood.</b> <b>In</b> a 1931 interview, his naïve revelations of incompetence and extravagance in the studios caused a furore. In the same decade, his literary career reached a new peak.|$|E

Michael Weyland is a duplicitous character, and it is irrelevant whether he is a human or an android.|$|E

5|$|Rand {{did not use}} a {{specific}} architect {{as a model for}} Keating. Her inspiration for the character came from a neighbor she knew while working in <b>Hollywood</b> <b>in</b> the early 1930s. Rand asked this young woman to explain her goals in life. The woman's response was focused on social comparisons: the neighbor wanted her material possessions and social standing to equal or exceed those of other people. Rand created Keating as an archetype of this motivation, which she saw as the opposite of self-interest.|$|E

5|$|Disney {{moved to}} <b>Hollywood</b> <b>in</b> July 1923. Although New York {{was the center}} of the cartoon industry, he was {{attracted}} to Los Angeles because his brother Roy was convalescing from tuberculosis there. Disney's efforts to sell Alice's Wonderland were in vain until he heard from New York film distributor Margaret J. Winkler. She was losing the rights to both the Out of the Inkwell and Felix the Cat cartoons, and needed a new series. In October they signed a contract for six Alice comedies, with an option for two further series of six episodes each. Disney and his brother Roy formed the Disney Brothers Studiowhich later became The Walt Disney Companyto produce the films; they persuaded Davis and her family to relocate to Hollywood to continue production, with Davis on contract at $100 a month. In July 1924 Disney also hired Iwerks, persuading him to relocate to Hollywood from Kansas City.|$|E
