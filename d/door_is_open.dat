A farmer discovers the barn <b>door</b> <b>is</b> <b>open</b> and suspects trespassers. He enters the barn, nearly catching Homer and Marge, who are hiding in the hay loft, but leaves after failing to locate them. When the coast is clear, Homer and Marge have inspired sexual intercourse in the hay loft.|$|E
5|$|The goal in each cavern is {{to locate}} both {{the end of}} level door and the special pillar which unlocks it. When stepped on, the pillar {{activates}} a countdown timer, during which the <b>door</b> <b>is</b> <b>open.</b> Once the timer is active, the player must get to the door before the timer ends and the door re-closes. There are multiple bonus games in between levels where the player can amass more treasure. Later levels include caveman villages where the player can purchase new tools with collected treasure as a currency.|$|E

Many lasers are considered class1 only because the light is contained within an interlocked enclosure, like DVD drives or portable CD players.|$|E

25|$|States {{refer to}} the various {{conditions}} that can occur in a use or sequence scenario of the system. An example is an elevator, which uses logic based on the system state to perform certain actions in response to its state and operator input. For example, if the operator presses the floor n button, the system will respond {{depending on whether the}} elevator is stopped or moving, going up or down, or if the <b>door</b> <b>is</b> <b>open</b> or closed, and other conditions.|$|E
25|$|Photography is {{forbidden}} in these areas, {{both inside and}} outside, although some photos have {{found their way to}} a variety of web sites. Guests who attempt to explore backstage are warned and often escorted from the property. The boundary between on and off-stage is demarcated at every access point. Everything within guest view when a door or gateway is open is also considered on stage. It is from this point that characters start playing their part. That way, when the <b>door</b> <b>is</b> <b>open,</b> guests will not accidentally see a person out of character backstage.|$|E

2500|$|The {{radiation}} {{produced by}} a microwave oven is non-ionizing. It therefore {{does not have the}} cancer risks associated with ionizing radiation such as X-rays and high-energy particles. Long-term rodent studies to assess cancer risk have so far failed to identify any carcinogenicity from [...] microwave radiation even with chronic exposure levels (i.e. large fraction of life span) far larger than humans are likely to encounter from any leaking ovens. However, with the oven door open, the radiation may cause damage by heating. Every microwave oven sold has a protective interlock so that it cannot be run when the <b>door</b> <b>is</b> <b>open</b> or improperly latched.|$|E

The <b>door</b> <b>is</b> <b>open,</b> which is very nice - I'd {{absolutely}} consider going back. It was really emotional. It's just like leaving behind a massive family. I really miss it - but onwards and upwards". Kenny also discussed writing the second series of EastEnders: E20, saying: [...] "I really wanted it {{to start with a}} bang. As soon as you come in it's exciting, there's sex and romance and kissing. I wanted it to be really fresh".|$|E

With no guarantee of the right to religious freedom for all individuals, together with a judicial system instructed to enforce Islamic principles and Islamic law, the <b>door</b> <b>is</b> <b>open</b> for a harsh, unfair, or even abusive interpretation of religious orthodoxy to be officially imposed…" ...|$|E

2500|$|Juan Manuel Blanes, the Uruguayan {{painter who}} lived in Buenos Aires, painted an oil on canvas (currently in Montevideo) called The Episode of the Yellow Fever, {{reproduced}} in this article, inspired by one done during the tragedy, probably on 17 March 1871 in Balcarce Street. [...] In it we see a woman (Ana Bristani), dead of the fever, lying across {{the floor of a}} tenement. [...] Her son, a baby of a few months, searches for his mother's breast. [...] His father's corpse lies on a bed on the right. [...] The <b>door</b> <b>is</b> <b>open</b> and through it you can see the doctors Roque Pérez (centre) and Manuel Argerich (on the right) entering the room.

2500|$|... "72. ... {{there is}} no logical or {{necessary}} connection between seriousness and probability. Some seriously harmful behaviour, such as murder, is sufficiently rare to be inherently improbable in most circumstances. Even then there are circumstances, such as a body with its throat cut and no weapon to hand, where {{it is not at}} all improbable. Other seriously harmful behaviour, such as alcohol or drug abuse, is regrettably all too common and not at all improbable. Nor are serious allegations made in a vacuum. Consider the famous example of the animal seen in Regent’s Park. If it is seen outside the zoo on a stretch of greensward regularly used for walking dogs, then of course it is more likely to be a dog than a lion. If it is seen in the zoo next to the lions’ enclosure when the <b>door</b> <b>is</b> <b>open,</b> then it may well be more likely to be a lion than a dog." ...|$|E
2500|$|At 7:36p.m. on September 16, 2016, police {{received}} a 9-1-1 call about an abandoned {{vehicle in the}} middle of 36th Street North just west of Lewis Avenue.

I got out and was like, 'Do you need help?'" [...] "He was like, 'Come here, come here, I think it's going to blow up.'" [...] The other caller said: [...] "There is a car that looks like somebody just jumped out of it and left it in the center of the road on 36th Street North and North Lewis Avenue." [...] "It's dead in the middle of the street." [...] "It's a Navigator. The driver-side <b>door</b> <b>is</b> <b>open</b> like somebody jumped out. It's on the yellow line, blocking traffic.

2500|$|Upon arriving, {{they find}} their <b>door</b> <b>is</b> <b>open,</b> {{suggesting}} a burglar {{is inside the}} house. Bart fetches Homer a makeshift weapon made from a cinder block tied to a chain that he calls [...] "The Defender". Homer swings it around to threaten the burglar, but when the family smells apple pie, they discover it is actually Homer's mother, Mona Simpson. Mona says that her days of activism are over, and that she is staying for good. When she asks if Homer will forgive her, a shaken Homer angrily replies that he will not, {{because of all the}} times she left him as a child. Homer explains that he feels hurt and abandoned when Mona is not around, and does not want to feel that way again. Later that night, Mona tries to explain to Homer she has changed her ways, but, again Homer does not listen. Afterwards, Homer realizes he should have listened to his mother, and makes her a card as an apology: when he goes downstairs to apologize, he sees her {{sitting in front of the}} fire, and asks if she is asleep. When he then notices and questions that she is [...] "sleeping with her eyes open", her head slumps down and Homer realizes that she has died.|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} {{was featured in}} various other storylines, including a feud with Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp); a tug-of-love for Ricky's affections with his first wife Sam Mitchell (Danniella Westbrook); a one-night stand with Lenny Wallace (Des Coleman), causing a sexually transmitted disease scare; {{and the death of}} her best friend Tiffany Mitchell (Martine McCutcheon). In November 1998, the BBC announced that Patsy Palmer had decided to leave EastEnders {{to spend more time with}} her family. The BBC said that Bianca would not be killed off, and a spokesman commented: [...] "Bianca has always been an amazingly powerful character and the <b>door</b> <b>is</b> <b>open</b> to her if she wants to return in the future. She has been fantastic in the years she has been in EastEnders and we will miss her." [...] Palmer was one of several high-profile EastEnders stars to announce their departures that year; McCutcheon and Kemp also decided to leave, and Gillian Taylforth left the serial in 1998 after 13 years playing Kathy Beale. The BBC said, [...] "no-one is bigger than the show, which is doing extremely well at the moment. We will send her off with all our very best wishes." [...] Richard Stokes, EastEnders series editor and producer of Palmer's exit storyline commented, [...] "you don't expect people to stay here for ever. But it's a double-edged sword. Yes, it's a shame when a well-loved character announces they're going, but the flipside is that it provides us with the space to do the best possible story. If someone is going, you can up the stakes. The whole of Bianca's story was developed once we knew she was going to go." ...|$|E
