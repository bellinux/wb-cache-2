60|$|And then, at last, {{the truth}} flashed across me, and <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> {{should be in}} time. Ours was the first boat, {{and it would be}} unkind of me to spoil the man’s picture, I thought.|$|E
6000|$|It did a little, I saw, but I {{gave it a}} tilt up. [...] "Not at all. It's a case of shining as Brissenden shines." [...] <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> {{might go}} further--then risked it. [...] "By sacrifice." ...|$|E
60|$|As {{the evening}} wore on <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> {{would be able}} to sleep. There was no use {{worrying}} about matters, as it would do no good, so I was inclined to treat the affair philosophically and make the best of it.|$|E
6000|$|CLARE. On the door-mat! And they'd {{whitewashed}} me so beautifully! Poor dears! <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> ought----[She looks {{towards the}} door.] ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I don't {{know whether}} I quite like it," [...] said Lydia. [...] "It seems like hypocrisy. It used to worry me. Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had any real self. I {{seemed to be}} just what people made me, and a {{different}} person to each." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I know. Gee! if {{you knew}} how I've been {{thinking}} about you all day! I've been wondering if I ought to-- I'm no good; blooming waster, I told myself; and <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had any right {{to try to make}} you care; but-- Oh, you must come, Goldie!" ...|$|E
60|$|When {{the boat}} {{finally came to}} a {{standstill}} I was nearly suffocated for the want of fresh air, and <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had not been chloroformed when first assaulted. I was hoisted up by several men and placed upon my feet, and then the cords which bound me were cut and the bag was removed.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Twas Thomasin who spoke," [...] said Wildeve. [...] "Then {{they have}} fetched her. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had better go in--yet it might do harm." ...|$|R
6000|$|And, [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> am aphoristic and subtle? <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> {{when she}} gets the rice-powder off, Claire isn't a lot more like Milt than she thought?" ...|$|R

60|$|To {{keep up the}} circulation, I {{ran around}} the island a dozen times or so, and clambered across its rocky {{backbone}} as many times more-- all of which was of greater service to me, as I afterward discovered, than merely to warm me up. In {{the midst of this}} exercise <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had lost anything out of my pockets while rolling over and over in the sand. A search showed the absence of my revolver and pocket-knife. The first Yellow Handkerchief had taken; but the knife had been lost in the sand.|$|E
6000|$|... "As an assistant," [...] the old {{tinsmith}} continued, [...] "Chopfyt {{was not a}} success. He was awkward {{with tools}} and was always hungry. He demanded something to eat six or eight times a day, so <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had fitted his insides properly. Indeed, Chopfyt ate so much that little food was left for myself; so, when he proposed, one day, {{to go out into}} the world and seek adventures, I was delighted to be rid of him. I even made him a tin arm to take the place of the missing one, and that pleased him very much, so that we parted good friends." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{finally got}} away {{at two in}} the morning, and when I turned out at six, we were {{rounding}} to at a rocky point where there was an old stone warehouse--at any rate, the ruins of it; two or three decayed dwelling-houses were near by, in the shelter of the leafy hills; but there were no evidences of human or other animal life to be seen. <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had forgotten the river; for I had no recollection whatever of this place; the shape of the river, too, was unfamiliar; there was nothing in sight, anywhere, that I could remember ever having seen before. I was surprised, disappointed, and annoyed.|$|E

60|$|Yva {{lifted her}} shield and {{returned}} to her station, and in the blue discharges which now flashed almost continuously, and the phosphorescent glare of the advancing mountain, I saw that though her beautiful face worked beneath the pain of the blow, her eyes remained serene and purposeful. Even then I wondered--what was the purpose shining through them. Also <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> was about to be called upon to make that sacrifice of which she had spoken, and if so, how. Of one thing I was determined--that if the call came it should not find me deaf. Yet all the while I was horribly afraid.|$|E
60|$|I lay a while {{drawing in}} the sweet air which to me was like a draught of nectar, and {{wondering}} whether I were not still in a dream. For instance, <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had truly seen the figures of Anscombe and Heda pass {{the mouth of the}} cave, on that day when I awoke, or if these were but another of Zikali's illusions imprinted on my weakened mind by his will power. For of what he and Nombe told me I believed nothing. Thus marvelling I fell into a doze and in my doze heard whisperings. I opened my eyes and lo! there before me stood Anscombe and Heda. It was she who spoke the first, for I was tongue-tied; I could not open my lips.|$|E
6000|$|... "When we were {{assigned}} to our rooms Miss Stacy had to leave us. Jane and I sat together and Jane was so composed that I envied her. No need of the multiplication table for good, steady, sensible Jane! <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> looked as I felt and if they could hear my heart thumping clear across the room. Then a man came in and began distributing the English examination sheets. My hands grew cold then and my head fairly whirled around as I picked it up. Just one awful moment--Diana, I felt exactly as I did {{four years ago when}} I asked Marilla if I might stay at Green Gables--and then everything cleared up in my mind and my heart began beating again--I forgot to say that it had stopped altogether!--for I knew I could do something with THAT paper anyhow.|$|E

60|$|The visitor, who {{was evidently}} still nervous, {{was glad to}} hurry away, and I heard her {{retreating}} step on the staircase. The rattling of the door began again, and at last it seemed to yield to a stronger pull, and opened sufficiently to allow Mrs. Saltillo to squeeze through. I withdrew behind my door. I fancied that it creaked as she passed, as if, noticing it ajar, she had laid an inquiring hand upon it. I waited, {{but she was not}} followed by any one. <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had been mistaken. I was going to the bell-rope to summon assistance to move my own door when a sudden instinct withheld me. If there was any one still in that room, he might come from it just as the servant answered my call, and a public discovery would be unavoidable. I was right. In another instant the figure of a man, whose face I could not discern, slipped out of the room, passed my door, and went stealthily down the staircase.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I was {{thinking}} this," [...] he began: [...] "I {{was thinking}} I lay on Papeete beach one night--all moon and squalls and fellows coughing--and I {{was cold and}} hungry, {{and down in the}} mouth, and was about ninety years of age, and had spent two hundred and twenty of them on Papeete beach. And I was thinking I wished I had a ring to rub, or had a fairy godmother, or could raise Beelzebub. And I was trying to remember how you did it. I knew you made a ring of skulls, for I had seen that in the Freischütz: and that you took off your coat and turned up your sleeves, for I had seen Formes do that when he was playing Kaspar, and you could see (by the way he went about it) it was a business he had studied; and that you ought to have something to kick up a smoke and a bad smell, I daresay a cigar might do, and that you ought to say the Lord's Prayer backwards. Well, <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> could do that; it seemed rather a feat, you see. And then <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> would say it forward, and I thought I did. Well, no sooner had I got to world without end, than I saw a man in a pariu, and with a mat under his arm, come along the beach from the town. He was rather a hard-favoured old party, and he limped and crippled, and all the time he kept coughing. At first I didn't cotton to his looks, I thought, and then I got sorry for the old soul because he coughed so hard. I remembered that we had some of that cough mixture the American consul gave the captain for Hay. It never did Hay a ha'porth of service, but I thought it might do the old gentleman's business for him, and stood up. 'Yorana!' says I. 'Yorana!' says he. 'Look here,' I said, 'I've got some first-rate stuff in a bottle; it'll fix your cough, savvy? Harry my[1] and I'll measure you a tablespoonful in the palm of my hand, for all our plate is at the bankers.' So I thought the old party came up, and the nearer he came the less I took to him. But I had passed my word, you see." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{admired the}} skill with which Isabel saved her {{conscience}} in this statement {{too much to}} dispute it; and I suppose that whatever she had said, Miss Gage would have been reassured. I cannot particularly praise the wisdom of her behaviour during that day, or, for the matter of that, the behaviour of Kendricks either. The ideal thing {{would have been for}} him to keep away now till her father came, but {{it seemed to me that}} he was about under our feet all the while, and that she, so far from making him remain at his own hotel, encouraged him to pass the time at ours. Without consulting me, Mrs. March asked him to stay to dinner after he had stayed all the forenoon, and he made this a pretext for spending the afternoon in our corner of the verandah. She made me give it up to him and Miss Gage, so that they could be alone together, though I must say they did not seem to mind us a great deal when we were present; he was always leaning on the back of her chair, or sitting next her with his hand dangling over it in a manner that made me sick. <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> was ever such an ass as that, and I quite lost the respect for Kendricks's good sense and good taste which had been the ground of my liking for him.|$|E

6000|$|... "After {{ten days}} {{or more of}} this I was worn out by loss of sleep. And one night, when tired out with watching, I fell asleep. My gun-bearer {{was alone in the}} tent with me. A terrible roar awakened me, then an unearthly scream pierced right into my ears. I always slept with my rifle in my hands, and, {{grasping}} it, I tried to rise. But I could not for the reason that a lion was standing over me. Then I lay still. The screams of my gun-bearer told me that the lion had him. I was fond of this fellow and wanted to save him. I thought it best, however, not to move while the lion stood over me. Suddenly he stepped, and I felt poor Luki's feet dragging across me. He screamed, 'Save me, master!' And instinctively I grasped at him and caught his foot. The lion walked out of the tent dragging me as I held to Luki's foot. The night was bright moonlight. I could see the lion distinctly. He was a huge, black-maned brute, and he held Luki by the shoulder. The poor lad kept screaming frightfully. The man-eater must have dragged me forty yards before he became aware of a double incumbrance to his progress. Then he halted and turned. By Jove! he made a devilish fierce object with his shaggy, massive head, his green-fire eyes, and his huge jaws holding Luki. I let go of Luki's foot and bethought myself of the gun. But as I lay there on my side, before attempting to rise, I made a horrible discovery. I did not have my rifle at all. I had Luki's iron spear, which he always had near him. My rifle had slipped out of the hollow of my arm, and when the lion awakened me, in my confusion I picked up Luki's spear instead. The bloody brute dropped Luki and uttered a roar that shook the ground. It was then I felt frightened. For an instant I was almost paralyzed. The lion meant to charge, and in one spring he could reach me. Under circumstances like those a man can think many things in little time. I knew to try to run would be fatal. I remembered how strangely lions had been known to act upon occasion. One had been frightened by an umbrella; one had been frightened by a blast from a cow-horn; another had been frightened by a native who in running from one lion ran right at the other which he had not seen. Accordingly, <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> could frighten the lion that meant to leap at me. Acting upon wild impulse, I prodded him in the hind quarters with the spear. Ladies and gentlemen, I am a blooming idiot if that lion did not cower like a whipped dog, put his tail down, and begin to slink away. Quick to see my chance, I jumped up yelling, and made after him, prodding him again. He let out a bellow such as you could imagine would come from an outraged king of beasts. I prodded again, and then he loped off. I found Luki not badly hurt. In fact, he got well. But I've never forgotten that scare." ...|$|E
