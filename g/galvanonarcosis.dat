40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} effective pulse limits for Salmo irideus, Cyprinus carpio, Gasterosteus aculeatus, Tinca tinca, Salmo fario and ldus melanotus in impulse D. C. for galvanotaxis and <b>galvanonarcosis,</b> {{studies were carried out}} with rectangular and square impulses. The narcotizing pulse limits remained constant for each variety in an impulse D. C. of specific wave form. The anodic effect of fishes was better in square wave form and varied with the variation of temperature of surrounding medium. S. fario reacted better when placed parallel to the lines of electrical force. Transversal escape movement occured when the axis of fish body was at right angles to the direction of current...|$|E
40|$|The {{threshold}} current densities required for first reaction, galvanotaxis and <b>galvanonarcosis</b> of fish depended upon species, {{length of the}} body, conductivity of water, nature of current and frequency of impulses. The threshold values and their ratios decreased with increase in length of fish. With rise in conductivity {{of water in the}} ratio of 1 : 4 : 13, these values increased in the ratio 1 : 2 : 5. Impulse D. C was superior to continuous D. C and the threshold values of current densities for different reactions of fish decreased with rise in impulse frequency reaching minimum at an impulse frequency of 48 /sec. Among Salmo irideus, ldus melanotus and Cyprinus carpio, the first one was affected earlier and required minimum current densities to exhibit the reactions, while the last one showed similar reactions only at higher current densities...|$|E
40|$|Response to {{external}} electric field (D. C.) {{of three different}} varieties of fish namely Puntius ticto, Heteropneustis fossilis and Tilapia mossambica having different anatomical and behavioural characteristics were studied. Clearly distinguished reactions occurred one after another m all the varieties of fish {{with the increase in}} field intensity with minor specific variations. These reactions can be broadly classified into initial start (first reaction), forced swimming (galvanotaxis), slackening of body muscle (<b>galvanonarcosis)</b> and state of muscular rigidity (tetanus). The orientation of the organism (projection of nervous element) to the surrounding field has been found to have important bearing on the behaviour reactions. Clearly differentiated anodic taxis and true narcosis set in when fish body axis was parallel to the lines of current conduction. But with greater angle between the body axis and the current lines, fish did not show well marked reactions. Fish body, when perpendicular to current lines responded for anodic curvature and off balance swimming followed by tetanus...|$|E
