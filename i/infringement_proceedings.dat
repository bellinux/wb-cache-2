25|$|A {{decision}} of the EPO to revoke a European patent is final (when the opportunity to appeal before the EPO is exhausted), which makes the opposition proceedings at the EPO especially attractive for opponents. In contrast, a {{decision of}} the EPO not to revoke a European patent (the decision instead maintaining the patent as granted or in an amended form) leaves the way open for revocation by the national court. The EPO decision does not create an estoppel precluding a subsequent challenge by an unsuccessful opponent {{at the national level}} (at least before the English courts). The validity of a European patent can be scrutinised both at the national level, before a national court, and at the international level, before the European Patent Office during opposition. The same is not true for <b>infringement</b> <b>proceedings,</b> upon which national courts exercise exclusive jurisdiction.|$|E
2500|$|The law {{considers}} a trademark to {{be a form}} of property. [...] rights in relation to a trademark may be established through actual use in the marketplace, or through registration of the mark with the trademarks office (or [...] "trademarks registry") of a particular jurisdiction. In some jurisdictions, trademark rights can be established through either or both means. Certain jurisdictions generally do not recognize trademarks rights arising through use. If trademark owners do not hold registrations for their marks in such jurisdictions, {{the extent to which they}} will be able to enforce their rights through trademark <b>infringement</b> <b>proceedings</b> will therefore be limited. In cases of dispute, this disparity of rights is often referred to as [...] "first to file" [...] as opposed to [...] "first to use." [...] Other countries such as Germany offer a limited amount of common law rights for unregistered marks where to gain protection, the goods or services must occupy a highly significant position in the marketplace— where this could be 40% or more market share for sales in the particular class of goods or services.|$|E
40|$|The {{question}} at hand {{is located at}} the intersection of EU law and national constitutional law, and aims to answer the following problem: namely, how to mitigate federal concerns in the context of infringement procedures and financial sanctions under art. 260 TFEU. This article approaches this question both {{from the perspective of the}} Commission and the Court of Justice, as well as from the vantage point of the central and regional governments involved. After analysing the composition of the financial sanctions, we cover the involvement of subnational entities in the <b>infringements</b> <b>proceedings</b> in six tiered Member States (Austria, Belgium, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK) and the relevant national provisions for the partition of financial sanctions. The conclusions pertain to both the central and regional level and the EU institutions concerned, adhering to the multi-level relationship subjacent to this article...|$|R
40|$|In {{the recent}} past, prestigious courts {{around the world}} have refused to {{adjudicate}} cases relating to foreign registered or unregistered intellectual property rights (hereinafter: IPRs), where the proceedings concerned an IPR infringement claim or where the defendant in an IPR infringement action or the claimant in a declaratory action to establish that the IPR is not infringed pleaded that the IPR is invalid or void and that there is also no infringement of that right for that reason (so called validity issues incidentally raised). In these cases the refusal to adjudicate the foreign IPRs infringement and validity claims was grounded on exclusive subject-matter jurisdiction (exclusive jurisdiction) rules. According to those rules, the State that granted or recognized the IPR has the exclusive jurisdiction to address claims related thereto, independent of its also having personal jurisdiction over the defendant. This paper adopts and develops a thesis according to which exclusive jurisdiction rules in IPRs cases are not suggested by public international law; are actually illegal according to its rules on the denial of justice and on the fundamental human right of access to courts; and therefore, must be abandoned not only with respect to IPRs infringement issues, but also to IPRs validity claims raised as a defense in <b>infringements</b> <b>proceedings,</b> as the majority of the scholars maintain and the most recent academic initiatives like the ALI Principles and the CLIP Project codify...|$|R
40|$|In the post-Markman era, the Federal Circuit {{has focused}} {{attention}} on the public notice function of patent claims in equivalents cases, and {{it has come to}} emphasize precision and accuracy in claim drafting. This Article argues that recent judicial emphasis on the public notice function of patent claims is an inappropriate innovation policy. The demand for highly refined patent claims increases patent acquisition expenditures that are unlikely to increase social welfare, cause patent rights to be distributed unevenly, and are inconsistent with the structural features of the patent system. This Article presents two mechanisms to accommodate the doctrine of equivalents in the post-Markman era. One is the reinvigoration of the reissue proceeding. The other is allowing judicial amendment of patent claims during <b>infringement</b> litigation <b>proceedings,</b> much like the longstanding British practice. This shift would allow courts to pursue the policy goals of Markman for literal and equivalent infringement alike...|$|R

It furthermore has jurisdiction to hear cases against decisions of the European Patent Office regarding unitary patents. As a court of several member states of the European Union it may (Court of First Instance) or must (Court of Appeal) ask prejudicial questions to the European Court of Justice when the interpretation of EU law (including the two unitary patent regulations, but excluding the UPC Agreement) is not obvious.|$|R
40|$|National patent laws protect {{intellectual}} property rights. However, these rights {{can only be}} enforced {{in the country that}} granted the patent. Therefore, a patent owner must pursue <b>infringement</b> or revocation <b>proceedings</b> in each country where his patent rights are challenged even if the defendant is the same party.

50|$|The Unified Patent Court (UPC) is a {{proposed}} common patent court open for participation of {{all member states}} of the European Union. The Court will hear cases regarding <b>infringement</b> and revocation <b>proceedings</b> of European patents (including unitary patents) valid in the territories of the participating states, with a single court ruling being directly applicable throughout those territories. Requesting unitary patents upon the grant of certain European patents will be possible from {{the establishment of the}} UPC.

It will enter into force {{on the first day of}} the fourth month after meeting three predefined conditions. The UPC comprises a Court of First Instance, a Court of Appeal in Luxembourg, an Arbitration and Mediation Center and a common Registry. The Court of First Instance will consist of a central division in Paris (with thematic sections in London and Munich) along with several local and regional divisions.|$|R

The EU Member States (except Denmark) were required to implement the Directive into national law by 16 November 2015. However, Greece is one of the 16 countries facing <b>infringement</b> <b>proceedings</b> for the non-communication of the Directive.|$|E
50|$|A {{cause of}} action for passing off {{is a form of}} {{intellectual}} property enforcement against the unauthorised use of a get-up (the whole external appearance or look-and-feel of a product, including any marks or other indicia used) which is considered to be similar to that of another party's product, including any registered or unregistered trademarks. Passing off is of particular significance where an action for trade mark infringement based on a registered trade mark is unlikely to be successful (due to the differences between the registered trade mark and the unregistered mark). Passing off is a common law {{cause of action}}, whereas statutory law such as the United Kingdom Trade Marks Act 1994 provides for enforcement of registered trademarks through <b>infringement</b> <b>proceedings.</b>|$|E
50|$|The European patent with unitary effect (EPUE), more {{commonly}} known as the unitary patent, is a new type of European patent in advanced stage of adoption which would be valid in participating member states of the European Union. Unitary effect can be registered for a European patent upon grant, replacing validation of the European patent in the individual countries concerned. The unitary effect means a single renewal fee, a single ownership, a single object of property, a single court (the Unified Patent Court) and uniform protection—which means that revocation as well as <b>infringement</b> <b>proceedings</b> are to be decided for the unitary patent as a whole rather than for each country individually. Licensing is however to remain possible for part of the unitary territory.|$|E
50|$|There {{are only}} two types of {{centrally}} executed procedures after grant, the opposition procedure and the limitation and revocation procedures. The opposition procedure, governed by the EPC, allows third parties to file an opposition against a European patent within 9 months of the date of grant of that patent. It is a quasi-judicial process, subject to appeal, {{which can lead to}} maintenance, maintenance in amended form or revocation of a European patent. Simultaneously to the opposition, a European patent may be the subject of litigation at a national level (for example an infringement dispute). National courts may suspend such <b>infringement</b> <b>proceedings</b> pending outcome of the opposition proceedings to avoid proceedings running in parallel and the uncertainties that may arise from that.|$|E
