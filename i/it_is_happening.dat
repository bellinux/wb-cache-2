500|$|The diary {{has been}} praised for its {{literary}} merits. Commenting on Anne Frank's writing style, the dramatist Meyer Levin commended Frank for [...] "sustaining {{the tension of}} a well-constructed novel", and was so impressed {{by the quality of}} her work that he collaborated with Otto Frank on a dramatization of the diary shortly after its publication. Levin became obsessed with Anne Frank, which he wrote about in his autobiography The Obsession. The poet John Berryman called the book a unique depiction, not merely of adolescence but of the [...] "conversion of a child into a person as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> in a precise, confident, economical style stunning in its honesty".|$|E

Furthermore, [...] "Locke" [...] publishes an essay detailing the Chinese betrayal just as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>happening,</b> and {{on the basis of}} this prescience (and other miracles over the years) Peter Wiggin is elected Hegemon over the world.|$|E
2500|$|The Conseil supérieur de l'audiovisuel (CSA), {{the agency}} of the French {{government}} which oversees broadcast media, reminded television stations there that it was still illegal to broadcast footage of the perp walk, as some did, even though it took place overseas. Violators could face a fine as high as €15,000; but the CSA said it would leave it to Strauss-Kahn to pursue complaints. [...] French journalists such as Olivier Ravanello, deputy managing editor at i>-Télé, stated that the law was inapplicable to criminal proceedings in foreign countries, stating that [...] "We can't cover the DSK story like a French story {{for the simple reason}} <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> in the U.S. The images we saw are brutal indeed, but that's {{because of the nature of}} the U.S. judiciary." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Iron Dream won {{critical}} acclaim, {{including a}} Nebula Award nomination and a Prix Tour-Apollo Award. Ursula K. Le Guin {{wrote in a}} review that: [...] "We are forced, insofar as {{we can continue to}} read the book seriously, to think, not about Adolf Hitler and his historic crimesHitler is simply the distancing mediumbut to think about ourselves: our moral assumptions, our ideas of heroism, our desires to, lead or to be led, our righteous wars. What Spinrad is trying to tell us is that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> here." [...] Le Guin also stated that [...] "a novel by Adolf Hitler" [...] cannot [...] "be well-written, complex, (or) interesting", as this [...] "would spoil the bitter joke", then asked rhetorically why anyone should [...] "read a book that isn't interesting".|$|E
2500|$|Buckley was an {{advocate}} for the legalization of marijuana and some drug legalization as early as his 1965 candidacy for mayor of New York City. He wrote a pointed pro-marijuana legalization piece for National Review in 2004 where he calls for conservatives to change their views on legalization, stating, [...] "We're {{not going to find}} someone running for president who advocates reform of those laws. What is required is a genuine republican groundswell. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>happening,</b> but ever so gradually. Two of every five Americans [...] believe 'the government should treat marijuana {{more or less the same}} way it treats alcohol: It should regulate it, control it, tax it, and make it illegal only for children.'" [...] In his December 3, 2007 column, shortly after his wife's death, which he attributed, at least in part, to her smoking, Buckley seemed to advocate banning tobacco use in America.|$|E
2500|$|Warn {{said that}} the February 12, 2009 {{statements}} by Carruthers regarding Reese insulted the audience's intelligence. The statements were not supported by what the audience saw, she said. [...] "There is validity to the argument Carruthers is making — that there simply aren't enough romantic-pairing options for long-running lesbian characters unless you're willing to change the general makeup of the established cast of characters," [...] said Warn. [...] "This logic is frequently used by TV writers and showrunners to justify minimal lesbian visibility, bad lesbian storylines, and the growing trend towards adding bisexual characters to their shows instead of lesbians." [...] Warn said that while this may be an understandable decision for an individual show, when <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> on various shows, the viewer is [...] "left with a television landscape populated by lesbians who sleep with men, or no lesbians at all, only bisexual characters (who also primarily sleep with men)" [...] and that All My Children [...] "fed right into" [...] this with the Reese and Bianca storyline.|$|E

Everywhere, and in all ages, as far as I can ascertain, has man been inventing stimulants and narcotics to supply that want of vitality of which he is so painfully aware; and has asked nature, and not God, to clear the dull brain, and comfort the weary spirit.|$|E
