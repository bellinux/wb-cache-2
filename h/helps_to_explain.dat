5|$|New oceanic crust, {{closest to}} the mid-oceanic ridges, is mostly basalt at shallow levels and has a rugged topography. The {{roughness}} of this topography {{is a function of}} the rate at which the mid-ocean ridge is spreading (the spreading rate). Magnitudes of spreading rates vary quite significantly. Typical values for fast-spreading ridges are greater than 100mm/yr, while slow-spreading ridges are typically less than 20mm/yr. Studies have shown that the slower the spreading rate, the rougher the new oceanic crust will be, and vice versa. It is thought this phenomenon is due to faulting at the mid-ocean ridge when the new oceanic crust was formed. These faults pervading the oceanic crust, along with their bounding abyssal hills, are the most common tectonic and topographic features on the surface of the Earth. The process of seafloor spreading <b>helps</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> the concept of continental drift in the theory of plate tectonics.|$|E

25|$|Most Dolichovespula species {{including}} D. media mate {{only once}} or fertilize most eggs with sperm {{from a single}} male. In addition, there are only 1-2 queens per colony. These specific characteristics result in {{a high level of}} worker-worker relatedness within the colony. One study estimated this relatedness to be as high as 0.71. This was determined by analyzing 20 workers from each of 10 nests at 3 DNA microsatellite loci. The DNA analysis allowed the researchers to determine if males were queen’s or workers’ sons and from there calculate an estimated relatedness. There is evidence that workers in this species attempt to reproduce with about 4 reproducing workers per colony that sometimes lay eggs, however, only 7.4% of the male population are produced by the workers. It has been observed that the median wasp participates in worker policing where the queen or other workers throw worker laid eggs out of the nest or otherwise destroy them. All of this information <b>helps</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> the high level of relatedness in the colony and that relatedness <b>helps</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> the eusocial behavior of these wasps.|$|E

25|$|The {{cellular}} {{mechanisms of}} commotio cordis are still poorly understood, but probably {{related to the}} activation of mechanosensitive proteins, ion channels. These trigger extra electrical excitation waves which, if occurring right at {{the trailing edge of}} a previous electrical cycle, can give rise to ventricular fibrillation. Since the trailing edge of the preceding electrical cycle travels over the ventricular surface, the critical window for mechanical induction of ventricular fibrillation varies locally - i.e. the commotio cordis risk window exists in time and in space. This <b>helps</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> why precordial impacts tend to have benign consequences.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to Picasso and Braque, Gleizes' intent {{was not to}} analyze and describe visual reality. Gleizes had argued that we cannot know the external world, we can only know our sensations. Objects from daily life⎯guitar, pipe or bowl of fruit⎯ did not satisfy his complex idealistic concepts of the physical world. His subjects were of vast scale and of provocative social and cultural meaning. Gleizes' iconography (as of Delaunay, Le Fauconnier and Léger) <b>helps</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> why there is no period in his work corresponding to analytic Cubism, {{and how it was}} possible for Gleizes to become an abstract painter, more theoretically in tune with Kandinsky and Mondrian than Picasso and Braque, who remained associated with visual reality.|$|E
25|$|The {{theory of}} metals in their solid state <b>helps</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> the unusually high {{electrical}} conductivity of copper. In a copper atom, the outermost 4s energy zone, or conduction band, {{is only half}} filled, so many electrons are able to carry electric current. When an electric field is applied to a copper wire, the conduction of electrons accelerates towards the electropositive end, thereby creating a current. These electrons encounter resistance to their passage by colliding with impurity atoms, vacancies, lattice ions, and imperfections. The average distance travelled between collisions, defined as the “mean free path,” is inversely proportional to the resistivity of the metal. What is unique about copper is its long mean free path (approximately 100 atomic spacings at room temperature). This mean free path increases rapidly as copper is chilled.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the atomic}} {{structure}} of glass shares {{characteristics of the}} structure in a supercooled liquid, glass tends to behave as a solid below its glass transition temperature. A supercooled liquid behaves as a liquid, but it is below the freezing point of the material, {{and in some cases}} will crystallize almost instantly if a crystal is added as a core. The change in heat capacity at a glass transition and a melting transition of comparable materials are typically of the same order of magnitude, indicating that the change in active degrees of freedom is comparable as well. Both in a glass and in a crystal it is mostly only the vibrational degrees of freedom that remain active, whereas rotational and translational motion is arrested. This <b>helps</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> why both crystalline and non-crystalline solids exhibit rigidity on most experimental time scales.|$|E
25|$|Aberdeen's {{architecture}} {{is known for}} its principal use during the Victorian era of granite, which has led to its local nickname of the Granite City or more romantically the less commonly used name the Silver City, since the Mica in the stone sparkles in the sun. The hard grey stone {{is one of the most}} durable materials available and <b>helps</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> why the city's buildings look brand-new when they have been newly cleaned and the cement has been pointed. Unlike other Scottish cities where sandstone has been used, the buildings are not weathering and need very little structural maintenance on their masonry. The buildings can however become noticeably darker as a result of pollution and grime accumulated over the years. There has however been great success in cleaning the buildings which can result in their façade being restored back to much how they looked originally.|$|E
25|$|Proponents of {{this model}} claim that it <b>helps</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> when and how {{language}} in our species emerged. Among 'Machiavellian', competitive nonhuman primates, sex is {{a major source of}} conflict, mutual suspicion and mistrust, as a result of which group members attempt to minimise the cost of deception by responding only to bodily signals which are intrinsically 'hard to fake'. This social pressure from receivers prevents language from even beginning to emerge. FCC theorists argue that for signals as cheap and intrinsically unreliable as words to become socially accepted, unprecedentedly intense levels of in-group trust were required. An effect of the Female Cosmetic Coalitions strategy, claim its supporters, was to minimise internal sexual conflict within each gender group, giving rise to a trusting social atmosphere such as is found among extant human egalitarian hunter-gatherers. These new levels of public trust, according to supporters of the model, enabled our species' latent linguistic capacities to flourish where previously they had been suppressed.|$|E

25|$|In DIC, the {{processes}} of coagulation and fibrinolysis are dysregulated, {{and the result is}} widespread clotting with resultant bleeding. Regardless of the triggering event of DIC, once initiated, the pathophysiology of DIC is similar in all conditions. One critical mediator of DIC is the release of a transmembrane glycoprotein called tissue factor (TF). TF is present on the surface of many cell types (including endothelial cells, macrophages, and monocytes) and is not normally in contact with the general circulation, but is exposed to the circulation after vascular damage. For example, TF is released in response to exposure to cytokines (particularly interleukin 1), tumor necrosis factor, and endotoxin. This {{plays a major role in}} the development of DIC in septic conditions. TF is also abundant in tissues of the lungs, brain, and placenta. This <b>helps</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> why DIC readily develops in patients with extensive trauma. Upon exposure to blood and platelets, TF binds with activated factor VIIa (normally present in trace amounts in the blood), forming the extrinsic tenase complex. This complex further activates factor IX and X to IXa and Xa, respectively, leading to the common coagulation pathway and the subsequent formation of thrombin and fibrin.|$|E
