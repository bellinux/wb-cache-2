40|$|International audienceA {{combination}} of original, powerful characterization techniques {{was used to}} make a thorough description of solid geopolymers and of the associated effect of varying the alkali cation source—NaOH, KOH, or CsOH—and aging for up to several years. More specifically, the local and pore structures were progressively determined from atomic local scale up to several nanometers by pair distribution function analysis (PDF), small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and longer correlation concerning the pore network, and possible diffusion and accumulation phenomena were unraveled by thermoporosimetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), respectively. These complementary observations resulted in a picture of an interface between the mineral and the porous network that was correlated to the solvated alkali cation present in the porous solution. After a short time of a few months, the Na-based geopolymer was found to exhibit a smooth interface built up from small “elementary” particles. This contrasted with the K- and Cs-based geopolymers, which presented developed interfaces arising from hierarchically organized smooth particles forming aggregates of fractal outer surface. This striking difference unraveled by SAXS and EIS is ascribed for the Na geopolymer to the contact of the solvated Na(H 2 O) x+ cations with the amorphous mineral surface. The <b>K(H</b> 2 <b>O)</b> x+ and Cs(H 2 O) x+ solvated cations were {{an integral part of the}} porous solution, without direct contact with the mineral surface, thus leading to apparently rough interfaces. Dewatering occurred with time, mostly impacting the Na series. Overall, we obtained a detailed picture of the geopolymer series and their changes in time.

40|$|An {{electrochemical}} {{quartz crystal}} microbalance {{was used as}} a sensitive detector to analyse the mass changes occurring during the coloration/bleaching processes of sol—gel NiO—TiO 2 electrochromic layers. Double layers were deposited on gold-coated quartz crystal electrode and sintered at 300 °C in air. The electrochemical process was studied in KOH electrolyte in the potential range - 0. 4 to + 0. 57 V vs. SCE during 650 CV cycles. The current density, charge and mass were found to increase with cycling. The shape of the mass spectrum is rather complex and changes continuously by cycling. The mass of the layer increases after each cycle slowly up to about the 150 th cycle then it increases strongly after about the 250 th cycle. It passes through a maximum around the 570 th cycle with high amplitude variation within each cycle and then decreases fast without drastic change of the cathodic charge. Finally, a complete breakdown occurs around the 650 th CV cycle impeding to record any further mass variation. The study is divided in two typical regions where the mechanism of coloration is found to change by cycling. During the first 150 CV cycles, the reversible change of the mass with the charge (increase in the anodic range for V> 0. 35 V vs. SCE and decrease in the cathodic range for V<- 0. 2 V) was related to exchange of OH- groups that involves a change of the oxidation state of Ni from 2 + to 3 + and vice versa leading to coloration and bleaching processes, respectively. For further cycling a model is proposed taking into account the incorporation of <b>K(H</b> 2 <b>O)</b> n+ ions in the hydrated structure of the layer.

It complements {{an earlier}} inference of "positive" hyperconjugative aromaticity for the cyclohexadienyl cation. The anion is a reactive intermediate in the dehydration of benzene cis- 1, 2 -dihydrodiol to phenol. Rate constants for 3 -substituted benzene cis-dihydrodiols are correlated by values with rho = 3. 2. Solvent isotope effects for the reactions are <b>k(H</b> 2 <b>O)</b> /k(D 2 O) = 1. 2 - 1. 8. These measurements {{are consistent with}} reaction via a carbanion intermediate or a concerted reaction with a "carbanion-like" transition state. These and other experimental results confirm that the reaction proceeds by a stepwise mechanism, with a change in rate-determining step from proton transfer {{to the loss of}} hydroxide ion from the intermediate. Hydrogen isotope exchange accompanying dehydration of the parent benzene cis- 1, 2 -dihydrodiol was not found, and thus, the proton transfer step is subject to internal return. A rate constant of similar to 10 (11) s(- 1), corresponding to rotational relaxation of the aqueous solvent, is assigned to loss of hydroxide ion from the intermediate. The rate constant for internal return therefore falls in the range 10 (11) - 10 (12) s(- 1). From these limiting values and the measured rate constant for hydroxide-catalyzed dehydration, a pK(a) of 30. 8 +/- 0. 5 was determined for formation of the anion. Although loss of hydroxide ion is hugely exothermic, a concerted reaction is not enforced by the instability of the intermediate. Stabilization by negative hyperconjugation is proposed for 1, 2 -dihydroxycyclohexadienide and similar anions, and this proposal is supported by additional experimental evidence and by computational results, including evidence for a diatropic ("aromatic") ring current in 3, 3 -difluorocyclohexadienyl anion...|$|R

40|$|Electrochemical {{synthesis}} of hydroxyapatite particles was performed from a homogeneous solution of Na 2 H 2 EDTA. 2 H 2 <b>O,</b> <b>KH</b> 2 PO 4 and CaCl 2 without stirring {{to investigate the}} mechanism of hydroxyapa-tite formation. We found that OH- ions generated by water reduction at the cathode {{play an important role}} in the formation of hydroxyapatite particles. The OH- ions induce the liberation of Ca 2 + ions and the dissociation of phosphoric acid, which serve as the reactants for the formation of hydroxyapatite particles. Two layers with a clear boundary were formed during electrolysis. The upper layer comprises the produced particles and the lower layer is a homogeneous solution. The produced particles were held in the region between the electrodes mainly due to the electrostatic interactions of charged particles in an electric field. The hydroxyapatite particles are agglomerates consisting of spherical particles. Aging the suspension for 24 h after electrolysis leads to the transformation of hydroxyapatite to brushite. Thus, if producing hydroxyapatite is desired, the particles should be continuously removed from the system. This method appears to be promising as a continuous process to produce hydroxyapatite parti...|$|R
40|$|A {{combination}} of original, powerful characterization techniques {{was used to}} make a thorough description of solid geopolymers and of the associated effect of varying the alkali cation source - NaOH, KOH, or CsOH - and aging for up to several years. More specifically, the local and pore structures were progressively determined from atomic local scale up to several nanometers by pair distribution function analysis (PDF), small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and longer correlation concerning the pore network, and possible diffusion and accumulation phenomena were unraveled by thermoporosimetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), respectively. These complementary observations resulted in a picture of an interface between the mineral and the porous network that was correlated to the solvated alkali cation present in the porous solution. After a short time of a few months, the Na-based geopolymer was found to exhibit a smooth interface built up from small "elementary"particles. This contrasted with the K- and Cs-based geopolymers, which presented developed interfaces arising from hierarchically organized smooth particles forming aggregates of fractal outer surface. This striking difference unraveled by SAXS and EIS is ascribed for the Na geopolymer to the contact of the solvated Na(H 2 O) x + cations with the amorphous mineral surface. The <b>K(H</b> 2 <b>O)</b> x + and Cs(H 2 O) x + solvated cations were {{an integral part of the}} porous solution, without direct contact with the mineral surface, thus leading to apparently rough interfaces. Dewatering occurred with time, mostly impacting the Na series. Overall, we obtained a detailed picture of the geopolymer series and their changes in time. The environment generated around the kosmotropic (order-making) Na+ alkali cation was more prone to change upon aging toward a non-Debye type relaxation than the initially developed interface supplied by the chaotropic Cs+ alkali cation, which was found to be relatively stable after 5 years. © 2015 American Chemical Society.

40|$|Measurement of {{cerebral}} {{blood flow}} (CBF) using positron emission tomography (PET) with 15 O-labelled water is commonly achieved using the one-compartment model of Kety. Unlike this model, a recently developed two-compartment CBF model accounts for nonextracted intravascular radioactivity and therefore provides with perfusion (CBF) as well as vascular, i. e., blood volume (CBV) related, information. The two parameters obtained from this two-compartment analysis, namely cerebral water clearance, <b>KH</b> 2 <b>O</b> 1, a measure of perfusion, and the apparent tracer distribution volume, Vo, provide more complete haemodynamic information than CBF alone. Still, accurate K 1 values can only be obtained if appropriate corrections for tracer delay (Deltat) and dispersion (tau) have been applied. Building on this two-compartment model, we have derived new nonlinear and linear solutions where all parameters involved appear explicitly. Simulations were performed to evaluate the accuracy and precision with which K 1, k 2, Vo, Deltat and tau can be determined from multiparameter regression of the model equations on dynamic PET data. It was found that K 1 and k 2 can be estimated with less than 2 % error using 5 -parameter fitting. We have applied our solutions to dynamic 15 O-water bolus PET studies where a CBF change was produced either through neuronal activation triggered by visual stimulation (in normal subjects), or by external pharmacological control through vasodilatory insults induced by Diamox injection (in patients with cerebrovascular disease) and antioxidant LY 231617 administration (in monkeys with unilateral middle cerebral artery occlusion). We found {{that in addition to}} accurate pixel-by-pixel estimation of K 1 and k 2, accurate changes in K 1, Vo and the ratio Vo/K 1 between baseline and activation states can also be obtained using our solutions of the two-compartment CBF model with implicit corrections for delay, dispersion and residual vascular radioactivity. These parameter changes provide potential indices of cerebrovascular reserve capacity, and of variations in cerebral vascular volume and mean vascular transit time. Our method may prove to be an elegant tool in the selection of candidates for revascularisation surgery...|$|R
40|$|Pulmonary neuroepithelial bodies (NEB) {{are widely}} {{distributed}} throughout the airway mucosa of human and animal lungs. Based on the observation that NEB cells have a candidate oxygen sensor enzyme complex (NADPH oxidase) and an oxygen-sensitive K+ current, {{it has been suggested}} that NEB may function as airway chemoreceptors. Here we report that mRNAs for both the hydrogen peroxide sensitive voltage gated potassium channel subunit (<b>KH</b> 2 <b>O</b> 2) KV 3. 3 a and membrane components of NADPH oxidase (gp 91 phox and p 22 phox) are coexpressed in the NEB cells of fetal rabbit and neonatal human lungs. Using a microfluorometry and dihydrorhodamine 123 as a probe to assess H 2 O 2 generation, NEB cells exhibited oxidase activity under basal conditions. The oxidase in NEB cells was significantly stimulated by exposure to phorbol esther (0. 1 μM) and inhibited by diphenyliodonium (5 μM). Studies using whole-cell voltage clamp showed that the K+ current of cultured fetal rabbit NEB cells exhibited inactivating properties similar to KV 3. 3 a transcripts expressed in Xenopus oocyte model. Exposure of NEB cells to hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2, the dismuted by-product of the oxidase) under normoxia resulted in an increase of the outward K+ current indicating that H 2 O 2 could be the transmitter modulating the O 2 -sensitive K+ channel. Expressed mRNAs or orresponding protein products for the NADPH oxidase membrane cytochrome b as well as mRNA encoding KV 3. 3 a were identified in small cell lung carcinoma cell lines. The studies presented here provide strong evidence for an oxidase-O 2 sensitive potassium channel molecular complex operating as an O 2 sensor in NEB cells, which function as chemoreceptors in airways and in NEB related tumors. Such a complex may represent an evolutionary conserved biochemical link for a membrane bound O 2 -signaling mechanism proposed for other cells and life forms...|$|R
40|$|Chlorothiazide (CTZ) is {{a poorly}} soluble {{diuretic}} agent. The {{aim of the}} present work was to produce and characterise a potassium salt form of chlorothiazide which has the potential advantages of improved aqueous solubility and potassium supplementation. A number of novel potassium salt forms of CTZ (CTZK) were prepared: CTZK monohydrate (form I), CTZK dihydrate (form II), anhydrous CTZK (form III), CTZK monohydrate hemiethanolate (form IV) and a desolvate of CTZK monohydrate hemiethanolate (form V). These salt forms were characterised by thermal analysis, PXRD, NMR, elemental analysis, FTIR, Karl Fisher titrimetry, ICP-MS and GC-MS. The ethanol-free CTZK forms were also characterised by dynamic vapour sorption analysis (DVS). CTZK form I was stable (in the DVS) over the range 0 % to 60 % RH. The dihydrate form of the salt was stable (in the DVS) over {{a broader range of}} relative humidities, 10 to 90 %RH at 25 ?C. CTZK form II was less hygroscopic at high humidities (70 - 90 % RH) than the previously reported CTZNa dihydrate. Single crystal X-ray analysis indicated that chlorothiazide potassium, crystallised from water or water/acetone mixture, formed a dihydrated polymeric-like intermolecular self-assembly (ISA) suprastructure. The ISA coordination was determined to be: (CTZ) 3 ?<b>K?(H</b> 2 <b>O)</b> 2 (CTZ) 2 ?(H 2 O) 2 ?K?(CTZ) 3 (monoclinic, space group: C 2 /c, single crystal cell parameters: a = 18. 328 (4) ?, b = 7. 3662 (16) ?, c = 19. 993 (5) ?, ?= 90 ?, ?= 99. 729 (3) ?, ? = 90 ?). When CTZK was crystallised from ethanol, a monohydrate hemiethanolate ISA was formed, described as (CTZ) 3 ?K?CTZ?(H 2 O) 2 ?CTZ?K?(CTZ) 2 (triclinic, space group: P- 1, single crystal cell parameters: a = 7. 078 (3) ?, b = 9. 842 (5) ?, c = 21. 994 (11) ?, ? = 87. 522 (13) ?, ?= 84. 064 (14) ?, ?= 78. 822 (12) ?).
