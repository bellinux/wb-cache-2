40|$|ABSTRACT Content-based music {{retrieval}} {{research has}} mostly focused on symbolic data rather than acoustical data. Given {{that there are}} no general-purpose transcription algorithms that can convert acoustical data into musical scores, new methods are needed to do music retrieval on acoustical data. In this paper, we review some existing methods on contentbased music retrieval, discuss different definitions of music similarity, and present a new framework to perform music indexing and retrieval. The framework is based on an earlier prototype we developed, with significant improvements. In our framework known as MACSIS, each audio file is broken down into small segments and converted into feature vectors. All vectors are stored in a high-dimensional indexing structure called LSH, a probabilistic indexing scheme that makes use of multiple hashing instances in parallel. At retrieval time, small segments of audio matches are retrieved from the index and pieced together using the Hough Transform technique, and results are used as the basis to rank candidate matches. 1.

The adage that “if you build it, they will come ” is not necessarily true. It’s not enough to be good; people need to KNOW that you’re good. Word-of-mouth will only take our organizations so far when it comes to promoting our collections, services and facilities to our audiences.

Aim: The {{purpose of this}} paper is to study the strategies involved in the communication process between an organisation and its target audience. The study also aims to examine the company Academic Work and its communication efforts towards the targeted audience students. Method/Material: In order to examine the aim above, interviews were made with two persons involved in the communication of Academic Work. In addition to the interviews, a questionnaire was carried out at campus Ekonomikum, Uppsala University. Main results: The main result can be summarized as: · Academic Works communications have a lot of resemblance with the papers presented theory. · Events and direct meetings is the communication effort by Academic Work that has the biggest impact on student’s awareness and knowledge of the company. · A large majority of the students at campus Ekonomikum at Uppsala University are interested in working part-time and are aware of Academic Work. Despite this, only a few percents of the students participating in the questionnaire are working or have ever worked for Academic Work.

40|$|With the {{ubiquity of}} the Microsoft Office suite of products, you often need to use SAS data and {{analytical}} results in the Office products Excel or Word. But transferring data from SAS to the Office applications can be difficult when the SAS System is installed on a non-Windows platform, such as OpenVMS™, UNIX ® or OS/ 3790 ®. This paper provides techniques for integrating the analytic processing power of the SAS system, irrespective of platform, with Microsoft Excel and Word. The use of the Output Delivery System (ODS) is also discussed. CROSS-PLATFORM TECHNIQUES The situation: your SAS data reside on a platform other than Windows, and you don't have the SAS System installed on the Windows machine where you have Excel and Word. <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> data, SAS, and the Office products together? The most straightforward way to get SAS data into your Office documents is to generate files that can be imported directly into Excel and Word. The methods described below will work on any platform, and all follow the same process: you generate the file, move the file to the Windows system where Office is installed, via FTP for example, and then use either Excel or Word to open the file. In later sections of this paper there are examples of how to automate the entire process using SAS server technologies. COMMA SEPARATED VALUE (CSV) FILE Perhaps {{the simplest way to}} transfer data across platforms is by utilizing a Comma Separated Value file. A CSV file is a plain-text file consisting of columns of data delimited by commas. It is generally used to transport raw data, not formatted analytical results. Figure 1 shows the CSV file corresponding to the SASHELP. CLASS data set. Excel can read this type of file and place the data into discrete cells. In contrast, if you open this type of file with Word, a Word table is not be generated, and you end up with basically what you see in Figure 1, a list of comma separated values. There are a number of ways to generate CSV files. Starting in Release 8. 2 of the SAS System, you can generate CSV files from a data set using the Output Delivery System (ODS) : ods listing close; ods csv file="class. csv"; proc print data=sashelp. class noobs; run; ods csv close; If you license SAS/IntrNet ® software, you can use the DS 2 CSV macro to create the file...|$|E

40|$|Breaking {{into the}} export market CUE: Selling your produce in {{domestic}} markets is one thing, but {{selling it to}} overseas markets is surely much more difficult. However, many of the basic rules for successful export marketing are the same, as Chris Kakunta found out {{when he spoke to}} Daniel Ball, a Zambian farmer who now runs a business selling honey to Europe and North America. Daniel began his honey business buying honey from local bee-keepers, processing it, and then selling it to the domestic market in Zambia. This was a successful venture, and he learned many lessons about good marketing. However, he believed that he could make more money by exporting, if only he could find a way of breaking into the export market. He decided to take a big risk, and bought a large quantity - many tons - of local honey. Now he had something to export; next he needed to find a buyer, and that was where things became difficult. IN:		?It was very difficult because ? OUT:		? and I know their needs. ? DUR?N	 4 ? 03 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Daniel Ball on the importance of having a good relationship with buyers for successful marketing. Transcript Ball	It was very difficult because I bought the honey and I found it difficult to find a market. I should have found the market first and then bought the honey, but I did it the other way, and I learned a valuable lesson. And I had to stay for almost two years without selling that honey, but I managed. And when I sold it, I sold at a loss, but the quality was good, such that the buyers came back to me. So now I am busy trying to make up that loss. But I?m not here for one business day, I?m here for the long term. Kakunta	And marketing strategy. Do you think it can play a very important role in production and export of honey? Ball	Well in developing a marketing strategy for something like honey or wax, you have three things that you must consider. Quality, quantity and reliability. Those are three factors that are very very important in developing any market, but they are very important when developing an export market. Kakunta	Perhaps you can elaborate more? Ball	Well the issue of quantity is, you cannot export 10 kg of honey, because no one in Europe or North America is interested in 10 kg of honey. And to have enough to export honey I would say you need between 16 to 20 tons, minimum. So quantity is very important. Secondly, quality is equally important. On the export market, they require a very high quality honey, which means that you must be very careful with your processing. Let me give you an example, if there is too much smoke; if it arrives in North America, and it smells to much like smoke, they will just pour it into the sea. If there is too much water in the honey, people in Europe or North America they don?t want that. So these are quality issues that you have to pay attention to. and the third issue is reliability; whether you can deliver what you say you have. If you say to someone like myself, I have got 100 kg of honey, so in my planning I take that into consideration. Now if they come and that farmer says, ?no I don?t have it?, then it also messes up. So you have to be reliable, in how much you say you can deliver, {{and you have to be}} reliable in your quality as well. Kakunta	I believe one important factor is the price. How do you manage to sell so that you don?t operate at a loss? Do you for instance have market information on what others are offering in terms of the price for your honey? Ball	That?s a good question. And you know I am reminded, today I was in Soweto, I was with some people selling beans. And the market for beans is no different than the market for honey. There is a lot of negotiation even on the export market. But yes we have information, and we have to compete; there are many different types of honey on the market. We have to also push forward and say, ?No try this! Zambian honey is number one! And then also I do know the price on the world market, and so I can use that. Kakunta	<b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> information on the world market, and how do you utilise it? Ball	Sometimes I go on the internet, sometimes I read commodity newspapers in which the prices are stated. Kakunta	So the information that you are able to get from the market, helps in the planning the way forward for your product? Ball	Yes, and I work very closely with my buyers. The people who buy from me, we don?t just meet in the market place, and say ?How much? OK, I?ll buy?. We meet all year round, they talk to me about the issues. ?Dan you have to be careful, there is still too much smoke in your honey?. ?OK, thank you?. So I am in constant contact with my buyers. There is a long term relationship with them, in which they know me they know my needs, and I know them and I know their needs. End of track. A honey exporter from Zambia explains the ?secrets? for successful marketing: quality, quantity, and reliability. These rules, he says, apply to all kinds of marketing whether for domestic or export markets. He also stresses the importance of having a good relationship with his buyers...|$|E
