5|$|Like Equijubus, Probactrosaurus, Gongpoquansaurus, {{and other}} styracosternans, Eolambia has {{cervical}} vertebrae {{which are very}} opisthocoelous, meaning that their front ends are strongly convex while their back ends are strongly concave. Unusually, {{the front end of}} the third cervical is set slightly higher than the back end, which is not seen in any other cervical vertebrae. Vertebrae from further back in the neck have a greater angle between the <b>elongate</b> articular processes known as the postzygapophyses, and also more <b>elongate</b> transverse processes. On the transverse processes, there are further articular processes – the rounded parapophyses and rod-like diapophyses – are located. In the rearmost cervicals, there is also a deep depression separating the postzygapophyses, and the neural spines have steeply-angled front margins, which has the effect of creating prominent spike-like projections.|$|E
5|$|As noted, {{there is}} bonebed {{evidence}} that this genus lived in groups during {{at least part of}} the year. Additionally, it had several potential methods for display in a social setting. The bony facial crest is an obvious candidate, and nasal diverticula may also have been present. These postulated diverticula would have taken the form of inflatable soft-tissue sacs housed in the deep excavations flanking the crest and <b>elongate</b> holes for the nostrils. Such sacs could be used for both visual and auditory signals.|$|E
5|$|Dromaeosaurids are {{diagnosed}} {{by the following}} features; short T-shaped frontals that form the rostral boundary of the supratemporal fenestra; a caudolateral overhanging shelf of the squamosal; a lateral process of the quadrate that contacts the quadratojugal; raised, stalked, parapophyses on the dorsal vertebrae, a modified pedal digit II; chevrons and prezygapophysis of the caudal vertebrae <b>elongate</b> and spanning several vertebrae; {{the presence of a}} subglenoid fossa on the coracoid.|$|E
30|$|Elongation {{ratio is}} {{the ratio of}} the {{diameter}} of a circle of the same area as the basin to the maximum basin length (Schumm 1956). It is a significant parameter to analyse the shape of the watershed. The low Re value indicates a steep slope and an <b>elongated</b> basin. An index of elongation ratio, proposed by Schumm and further interpreted by Strahler, is used to evaluate the shape of the watersheds, i.e. circular (0.9 – 0.10), oval (0.8 – 0.9), less <b>elongated</b> (0.7 – 0.8), <b>elongated</b> (0.5 – 0.7) and more <b>elongated</b> (<[*] 0.5). The drainage basin in Jhajjar district is mostly <b>elongated</b> in shape. The elongation ratio of SW 1 to SW 7 calculated was 0.85 (oval), 0.69 (<b>elongated),</b> 0.40 (more <b>elongated),</b> 0.69 (<b>elongated),</b> 0.66 (<b>elongated),</b> 0.46 (more <b>elongated)</b> and 0.75 (less <b>elongated),</b> respectively.|$|R

The collecting of <b>elongated</b> coins is a branch of numismatics. <b>Elongated</b> coins are also categorized as exonumia.|$|R
50|$|In geometry, the <b>elongated</b> square bipyramid (or <b>elongated</b> octahedron) {{is one of}} the Johnson solids (J15). As {{the name}} suggests, it can be {{constructed}} by <b>elongating</b> an octahedron by inserting a cube between its congruent halves.|$|R
5|$|In colonial corals, growth {{results from}} the budding of new polyps. There {{are two types of}} budding, intratentacular and extratentacular. In intratentacular budding, a new polyp {{develops}} on the oral disc, inside the ring of tentacles. This can form individual, separate polyps or a row of partially separated polyps sharing an <b>elongate</b> oral disc with a series of mouths. Tentacles grow around the margin of this elongated oral disc and not around the individual mouths. This is surrounded by a single corallite wall, {{as is the case in}} the meandroid corallites of brain corals.|$|E
5|$|The {{morphology}} (shape) {{of volcanic}} ash {{is controlled by}} a plethora of different eruption and kinematic processes. Eruptions of low-viscosity magmas (e.g., basalt) typically form droplet shaped particles. This droplet shape is, in part, controlled by surface tension, acceleration of the droplets after they leave the vent, and air friction. Shapes range from perfect spheres {{to a variety of}} twisted, <b>elongate</b> droplets with smooth, fluidal surfaces.|$|E
5|$|The sand whiting has a {{very similar}} profile to {{other members of the}} genus Sillago, with a {{slightly}} compressed, <b>elongate</b> body tapering toward the terminal mouth. The dorsal fin is in two parts, the first made of feeble spines and the second of soft rays headed by a single feeble spine, while the ventral profile is straight. The species is known to grow to a maximum size of 51cm and around 1.25kg weight.|$|E

5|$|The skull {{is unknown}} except for {{possibly}} {{a portion of}} lower jaw found at the same site {{as the rest of}} the known Coelurus material. Although it has the same preservation and coloring as the fossils known to belong to the Coelurus skeleton, it is very slender, which may mean it does not belong to the skeleton; this bone is 7.9centimeters long (3.1in) but only 1.1centimeters tall (0.43in). In general, its vertebrae were long and low, with low neural spines and thin walls to the bodies of the vertebrae. Its neck vertebrae were very pneumatic, with numerous hollow spaces on their surfaces (pleurocoels); these hollows were not evenly distributed among the vertebrae and varied in size. The neck vertebrae were very <b>elongate,</b> with bodies four times longer than wide, and they articulated with concave faces on both ends (amphicoely). The back vertebrae were not as <b>elongate,</b> lacked surface hollows, and had less developed concave faces and bodies that were hourglass-shaped. The tail vertebrae also lacked surface hollows.|$|E
5|$|Indraloris {{is known}} from {{isolated}} teeth and fragmentary lower jaws. The jaw is deep under the last premolars, but becomes shallower towards the front. The lower premolars are <b>elongate.</b> The lower molars are shorter and broader {{than those of}} Sivaladapis. Indraloris may have been arboreal and at least partly frugivorous. When the first Indraloris fossils were discovered in the early 1930s, one was misidentified as a carnivoran and the other as a loris. The carnivoran identification was corrected in 1968, and in 1979 Indraloris and the related Sivaladapis were identified as late survivors of Adapiformes, an archaic primate group.|$|E
5|$|Isolated lower premolars {{are known}} from I.kamlialensis. A p3, YGSP 33157, {{resembles that of}} YGSP 32727 in {{possessing}} a single large cusp connected to crests at the front and back. A heel is present at the back, part of a small talonid. The tooth has two roots. The p4, represented by YGSP 24338, is an <b>elongate,</b> two-rooted tooth with a distinct trigonid at the front and talonid at the back. The protoconid is the highest cusp of the trigonid. Two crests descend from it at right angles in a lingual direction (towards the inner side of the tooth): the protolophid towards the front, ending at the low paraconid, and the metalophid towards the back, reaching the <b>elongate</b> metaconid. The talonid basin is open lingually; on the labial side, the hypoconid cusp is present. A crest, the cristid obliqua, reaches from the hypoconid forward towards the trigonid. No other cusps are visible in the talonid, but the specimen is worn and poorly preserved; the posterolophid, a crest descending from the hypoconid, may end in a small hypoconulid. A weak cingulum is present on the labial side of the tooth between the protoconid and hypoconid. Another tooth, YGSP 32151, is interpreted as a dp4. It has a more closed trigonid (with the protolophid and metalophid making a more acute angle), the protolophid is shorter, and the paraconid is indistinct. In the talonid, the hypoconulid and entoconid are distinct. The labial cingulum is strong.|$|E

5|$|Kīlauea {{has been}} active {{throughout}} its history. Since 1918, Kīlauea's only prolonged period of rest was an 18-year pause between 1934 and 1952. The bulk of Kīlauea consists of solidified lava flows, intermittent with scattered volcanic ash and tephra sourced from relatively lower-volume explosive eruptions. Much of the volcano is covered in historical flows, and 90 percent of its surface dates from the last 1,100 years. Kīlauea built itself up from the seafloor over time, and thus much of its bulk remains underwater; its subaerial surface {{is in the form}} of a gently sloping, <b>elongate,</b> decentralized shield with a surface area of approximately , making up 13.7 percent of the island's total surface area.|$|E
5|$|Matthew and Brown also {{described}} a fifth skeleton (AMNH 5664), which Charles H. Sternberg had collected in 1917 {{and sold to}} their museum. It was smaller than other Gorgosaurus specimens, with a lower, lighter skull and more <b>elongate</b> limb proportions. Many sutures between bones were unfused in this specimen as well. Matthew and Brown noted that these features were characteristic of juvenile tyrannosaurids, but still described it as the holotype of a new species, G. sternbergi. Today's paleontologists regard this specimen as a juvenile G. libratus. Dozens of other specimens have been excavated from the Dinosaur Park Formation and are housed in museums across the United States and Canada. G. libratus is the best-represented tyrannosaurid in the fossil record, known from a virtually complete growth series.|$|E
5|$|More {{complete}} aetosaur {{remains were}} found from the Lower Stubensandtein of Germany in the 1870s. Among them were complete articulated skeletons of 22 aetosaurs. These specimens {{were found in}} a large sandstone outcrop near Stuttgart and were preserved together in an area less than 2 square metres in size. The animals were probably buried under lake sediment soon after they died, with {{the flow of water}} repositioning their bodies on the lake bed and putting them in close proximity to one another. In 1877, German paleontologist Oskar Fraas assigned these specimens to the newly erected genus Aetosaurus. Fraas named the genus after the skull's resemblance to the head of an eagle, with a narrow, <b>elongate</b> skull and a pointed snout.|$|E

5|$|Several {{species of}} <b>elongate</b> organisms form their bodies into a loop to roll, {{including}} certain caterpillars (which do so to escape danger), tiger beetle larvae, myriapods, mantis shrimp, Armadillidiidae, and Mount Lyell salamanders. Other species adopt more spherical postures, primarily {{to protect their}} bodies from predators; this posture has been seen in pangolins, wheel spiders, hedgehogs, armadillos, Armadillo girdled lizards, isopods, and fossilized trilobites. Pangolins and wheel spiders have been observed to purposely roll away from predators. These species may roll passively (under the influence of gravity or wind) or actively, typically by altering their shape to generate a propulsive force.|$|E
5|$|The Hornet Upgrade program (HUG) {{commenced}} in 1999. The project {{sought and}} continues to seek to modernise {{the ability of the}} current ACG fleet of F/A-18A and F/A-18B aircraft and associated support systems. The upgrade project has been set up to <b>elongate</b> the time the Hornet's can run until 2018. The project is being conducted in three phases. This project was established to upgrade the F/A-18 fleet to combine enrichments that will allow the aircraft to more effectively perform its air defence tasks. The project is being conducted in three main phases, phase one has already concluded and phases two and three are currently in production.|$|E
5|$|The {{external}} {{anatomy of}} the soft parts of this species {{is similar to that}} of other strombid snails. The animal has an <b>elongate</b> snout, thin eyestalks with well-developed eyes and sensory tentacles, and a narrow, strong foot with a sickle-shaped operculum. A molecular analysis conducted in 2006 based on DNA sequences of histone and mitochondrial genes demonstrated that Laevistrombus canarium, Doxander vittatus and Labiostrombus epidromis are closely related species. The dog conch exhibits behaviours common among Strombidae, including burrowing and a characteristic leaping form of locomotion. The former behaviour, however, involves movement sequences unique to this species.|$|E

50|$|The square orthobicupola can be <b>elongated</b> by the {{insertion}} of an octagonal prism between its two cupolae to yield a rhombicuboctahedron, or collapsed by the removal of an irregular hexagonal prism to yield an <b>elongated</b> square dipyramid (J15), which itself is merely an <b>elongated</b> octahedron.|$|R

5|$|The forelimbs of Patagosaurus {{are only}} based on three bones from the {{juvenile}} specimen, and no manual elements are preserved. The humeri are slender and <b>elongate,</b> lacking great proximal and distal expansions. The incomplete deltoid crest, only {{shows that it}} was wide, and likely had a projection below and behind. Like the humeri, the radius is slender, and lacks large expansions on either end. On the edge closest to the ulna, the radius possesses a ridge along its edge, which corresponds to where radioulnar ligaments would have attached. The ulna is complete, although sediment-filled breaks might have altered its original shape. The forelimb of Patagosaurus is much more gracile and different from the robust later sauropods like Camarasaurus, and Apatosaurus, and instead resembles more Diplodocus.|$|E
5|$|The {{large size}} of hadrosaurid eye sockets and the {{presence}} of sclerotic rings in the eyes imply acute vision and diurnal habits, evidence that sight was important to these animals. The hadrosaurid sense of hearing also appears to be strong. There is at least one example, in the related Corythosaurus, of a slender stapes (reptilian ear bone) in place, which combined with a large space for an eardrum implies a sensitive middle ear, and the hadrosaurid lagena is <b>elongate</b> like a crocodilian's. This indicates that the auditory portion of the inner ear was well-developed. If used as a noisemaker, the crest could also have provided recognizable differences for different species or sexes, because the differing layouts of the nasal passages corresponding to the different crest shapes would have produced intrinsically different sounds.|$|E
5|$|The slender smooth-hound has a {{very thin}} body and a broad, highly {{flattened}} head. The snout is long, with a distinctive bell-shaped outline when viewed from above. The eyes have an <b>elongate</b> horizontal oval shape, and are equipped with rudimentary nictitating membranes (protective third eyelids). Beneath each eye is a prominent ridge, and behind is a much smaller spiracle. The nostrils are preceded by small, almost triangular flaps of skin. The line of the mouth forms an angle; there are very short furrows at the mouth corners. The upper and lower jaws contain 96–99 and 108–114 rows respectively of small, very closely spaced teeth; each tooth has a narrow upright central cusp flanked by smaller cusplets on both sides. The five pairs of gill slits are short.|$|E
