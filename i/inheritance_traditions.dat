40|$|It {{may not be}} {{an exaggeration}} to say that the law of {{inheritance}} {{is one of the most}} neglected domains in the Indonesian government’s campaign for legal nationalization. Such negligence is in keeping with the state’s attitude towards non-state normative orderings, which is itself a product not only of the national legal ideology enshrined in the constitution that favors unification and uniformity, but also with the fact that the state is at a loss as to how to deal with the variety of <b>inheritance</b> <b>traditions</b> existing in the society. The question is thus not simply which law should be used as the main building block of the national inheritance law (whether Islamic, adat or even the Western civil law traditions) but more how to unify the practices currently followed. Gender-neutral inheritance is one of the most complicated problems faced by the state in the issue of varied inheritance practices. This is because not all contemporary legal traditions in the country have the same viewpoint with respect to gender equality among the recipients of inheritance. In this respect, the concept of gender-neutral justice, regarded as characteristic of the national legal system, has been challenged by certain traditions of inheritance that view difference in gender as a criterion for distributing the estate. Islamic inheritance law is the case that concerns us most here, especially as the tradition embodied in this religious law makes clear distinctions on the basis of sex. In the process of dividing the estate, the genders of the heirs become one of the most important factors i...|$|E

40|$|In {{contrast}} to the claim that without freedom from determinism {{there can be no}} justification for the attribution of moral responsibility, this work argues that a consistent treatment of ethical concerns actually requires the acceptance of determinism. Realizing that the materialistic, deterministic philosophy of naturalism is compatible with ethical considerations leads, in turn, to a new appreciation of the moral significance of American literary naturalism. ^ It is argued that American literary naturalism represents the modern <b>inheritance</b> of a <b>tradition</b> of naturalistic thought which extends through the work of the French philosophes and into early Greek philosophy. Further, it is argued that the philosophical reconciliation of determinism and moralism bred of this tradition also passes on a phenomenological reconciliation of the seemingly inconsistent objective and subjective approaches to reality. This phenomonological reconciliation is concomitant with a development from subjectivity to greater objectivity on the part of characters in the naturalistic fiction of Oliver Wendell Holmes and Mark Twain. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{thesis is}} {{centered}} around two Romanian post-communist films [...] - The Oak and The Conjugal Bed [...] -while also addressing {{other aspects of}} the contemporary cultural spectrum. The films constitute a (pre) text for analysis and indicators of larger social phenomena. Using an eclectic cultural approach to post-communist phenomena, I position contemporary Romanian artifacts in relation to the communist <b>inheritance,</b> cultural <b>traditions,</b> and regional features. The thesis is structured to permit continuous dialogism among post-communism and post-colonialism, postmodernism, and feminisms. To emphasize the similarities and dissimilarities among these cultural trends, I have used the New Zealand Film Once Were Warriors as a background. The liminality of the post-communist transition is discussed in terms of its aesthetic and theoretical consequences, with emphasis on the fluidity of the critical approach which has to perpetually attune itself to the dynamics of the events. The aspects I have approached [...] -internalized violence, the lack of positive forms of nationalism, the use of the absurd, grotesque imagery, (self-) irony, and laughter [...] -constitute a dynamic, self-generating system of features. The presence of violence on screen is the outcome of a violent external factor of oppression [...] -the imposition of Soviet communism [...] -which has been internalized. The tacit involvement of the population through passivity led to heightened levels of guilt, national low self-esteem, and even an absence of a positive nationalist feeling. As liminal types of discourse, the absurd, the grotesque and laughter propose subversive alternatives to both the rigidity of the communist discourse and the stiffness of cheap nationalist optimism.

Here, we demonstrate that behavioural food-processing variants among wild vervet monkey, Chlorocebus aethiops, mothers are matched by their infants in their first manipulative approaches to a new foraging problem. In our field experiment, grapes covered with sand were provisioned within groups of wild vervet monkeys that included experienced adults and 17 naïve infants. Monkeys dealt with the dirty food in four different ways. All infants first adopted their mother's way of handling the grapes, rather than those of other mothers or other monkeys eating nearby. Mothers who handled grapes in different ways had infants who were more likely to explore different approaches to handle the sandy grapes. Rarer cases of co-feeding siblings further suggest that copying may occur on the matriline level. Our findings suggest a capacity for detailed copying by infants of their mothers' and matriline members' food- processing techniques when encountering new foods, underlining the significance of familial models in such primate social groups...|$|R
