The program was developed and implemented by Rena Kornblum, a dance/movement therapist working in the Madison, WI public schools.

A review of the literature focuses on recent <b>evaluations</b> <b>and</b> <b>reviews</b> of other school-based violence prevention programs, as well as large-scale meta-analyses of and guides to such program evaluations. A mixed method evaluation of the Kornblum curriculum’s effectiveness was conducted with second grade students.

40|$|Background: Across {{the member}} {{countries}} of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), pay-for-performance (P 4 P) programs have been implemented in the inpatient sector {{to improve the quality}} of care provided by hospitals. However, little is known about whether such programs can live up to expectations. Thus far, <b>evaluations</b> <b>and</b> <b>reviews</b> have focused on the ambulatory care sector in Anglo-Saxon countries. The transferability of lessons learned to the inpatient sector, however, is limited. Objectives: We aimed to provide an overview of existing P 4 P programs in the inpatient sector in the OECD countries and to assemble information on their effects. Furthermore, we attempted to identify whether evaluations of such programs allow preliminary conclusions to be drawn about the effects of P 4 P. [ [...] . ...|$|E

40|$|This work {{reports on}} {{lessons learned from}} the first {{offering}} of an information systems capstone project for non-traditional bachelor’s degree students at the University of Richmond. Capstone projects have long been offered in lieu of comprehensive thesis papers for information systems master’s degree programs, and to integrate core competencies in both masters and undergraduate programs. It is accepted that such a course is ideal for pulling together and integrating core competencies of the information systems bachelor’s degree program and certificate program for those already having an undergraduate degree in another field. These students are non-traditional students at the University’s School of Professional and Continuing Studies. Little change to the syllabus from master’s degree syllabi was made for this initial course offering. It was immediately obvious that significant changes to this course would be required for future offerings to tailor the course to extend its value to the target population. The goal is to maintain the realism of a real-world capstone/consulting project, while ensuring academic goals are met, and students realize value from the process. The author uses observation, course outcomes and <b>evaluations,</b> <b>and</b> <b>reviews</b> the literature to suggest ways to improve future offerings of the course...|$|E

The results of this study might benefit administrators and districts to see the need to explore additional resources. As ease of use and usefulness are vital to {{technology acceptance}}, providing resources to school psychologists are key to the overall success of the IEP process.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to develop {{approaches}} that aid agencies could use in the appraisal and/or development of basic education programs in South Pacific countries which address aspects of poverty. It {{is set in the}} context of wider international concern that aid programs need to have a more direct impact on the conditions of the poor than they have had in the recent past. Concepts of poverty, basic education and literacy appropriate to South Pacific countries are developed and relationships among them are examined as preliminary steps to data collection and analysis. The data for the thesis comes from programs of aid to basic education that were running in or have commenced since 1985 and consists of formal <b>evaluations</b> <b>and</b> <b>reviews,</b> the opinion of expert panels and anecdotal evidence from individuals. Analysis of the data is conducted in two stages; first, criteria by which to judge the success of programs are developed and applied to the data, and second, the common components of successful programs are identified. The 'components of success' are then used to develop approaches that aid agencies could employ in analysing program proposals and/or in developing programs in basic education that have a poverty focus. Examples of how these approaches could be applied to particular programs are given...|$|E

Nevertheless, the promise of increased engagement requires that we consider how this might be accomplished, delivering up-to-date and authoritative coverage of advanced computer science and applications.

40|$|A {{major issue}} in Swedish and {{international}} research has, indeed, been the overriding purpose of social studies, along with the recurring discussion on whether the teaching of social studies should be organised in the individual subjects or be subject-integrated. The main aim {{of this article is}} to analyse how social studies as a specific field of study is featured in government commissions of inquiry and steering documents in the period 1980 - 2014. The analysis is primarily based on American and Nordic history and social studies education theory, which has identified a number of concepts regarding the purpose and organization of the social studies subject; the humanistic approach; the progressively approach; the disciplinary oriented approach and the postmodern and interpretive approach. The article is based on an analysis of national <b>evaluations</b> <b>and</b> <b>reviews</b> of social studies as well as curricula and government commissioned inquiries. The analysis shows that social studies as a knowledge domain is characterized by progressivism in the national evaluations in the whole period. Although curricula nowadays have a disciplinary perspective on the purpose and organization of social studies, progressivism is still prevalent in evaluations. It is clear that the public authorities responsible for the most recent inspections embrace progressivism. Concurrent with the predominance of certain education philosophies–progressivism in 1980 - 2011 and the disciplinary perspective from 2011 – there are also traces of other approaches in the curricula, for example, the humanistic as well as the postmodern perspectives...|$|E
