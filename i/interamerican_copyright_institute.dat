Against this background, we analyse the macroeconomic determinants of public investment, with a special focus on its long-term trend. We find that public investment has been determined by national income, the stance of budgetary policies and fiscal sustainability considerations. Neither the cost of financing nor the fiscal rules embodied in EMU have had a systemic impact on public investment. The significant downtrend that characterises the evolution of public investment in non-cohesion countries is chiefly determined by drawn-out episodes of fiscal consolidation, unrelated to EMU. <b>Copyright</b> <b>Institute</b> for Fiscal Studies, 2006. ...|$|R

I speculate on the reasons why this culture has persisted, discuss the suitability of the entrepreneurial university in the post- 2012 era and stress the importance of distinguishing between commercialism and Clark's concept of entrepreneurialism. © 2012 <b>Copyright</b> <b>Institute</b> of Education, University of London...|$|R
40|$|The {{sustained}} surpluses in {{the current}} and capital accounts of balance of payments are {{the main reason for}} the continuing rapid expanse of China's foreign exchange reserves in recent years. However, flaws {{in the formation of the}} renminbi exchange rate regime are the institutional root cause of the sustained high growth in foreign exchange reserves. Various theoretical misconceptions about the scale of foreign exchange reserves have swayed policies and contributed to its sustained fast growth. Sustained high growth of China's foreign exchange reserves, and its extraordinary large scale, carry tremendous risks. Because the security of foreign exchange reserves affects a country's financial safety, China urgently needs to adjust its foreign exchange reserve policies. <b>Copyright</b> <b>Institute</b> of World Economics and Politics, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences 2006. ...|$|R
40|$|To date, few {{observations}} {{have been}} made about the performance improvement that resulted from the property right transformation of the collective-owned township and village enterprises (TVE) {{in the middle of}} 1990 s. Using data collected from a questionnaire survey on the privatized TVE and their employees, the present paper provides some empirical evidence about this topic, and the analysis suggests that property right transformation has had a positive impact on sample enterprises' performance, including business improvement, employment expansion, incremental investment and contributions to government revenues. The present study concludes that, from a transient viewpoint, the property right transformation has not distorted local governments' intentions to establish TVE in earlier years. <b>Copyright</b> <b>Institute</b> of World Economics and Politics, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences 2006. ...|$|R

We measure the effective tax burden on capital investment and on highly qualified labour in 33 locations across Europe and the United States. We then correlate both types of tax burden in order to study the different tax policy strategies applied in different countries. We find that effective tax rates on companies and on highly skilled employees are closely correlated for a number of countries. Ireland and most new EU Member States impose relatively lower taxes on capital investment than on highly skilled manpower. Conversely, in the US, companies are taxed heavily but the effective tax rate on highly skilled employees is moderate. <b>Copyright</b> <b>Institute</b> for Fiscal Studies, 2006. ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{efficiency}} of the Chinese metal futures (i. e. copper and aluminum) traded on China's Shanghai Futures Exchange. First, we thoroughly analyze the development of China's commodity futures markets, which provides a fundamental background. Then we examine the random walk and unbiasedness hypotheses for two metal futures during 1999 - 2004. Based on the empirical evidence, we argue that China's copper and aluminum futures markets are efficient, and that they aid the process of price discovery because futures prices can be considered as unbiased predictors of future spot prices. We attribute this efficiency to the regulatory changes made in 1999 and the increased financial skills and acumen {{of the participants in the}} market. <b>Copyright</b> <b>Institute</b> of World Economics and Politics, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences 2006. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} an attempt to present an {{analysis}} of China's decentralization and local governance practices, the dilemmas rooted in the current institution. We argue that the misbehavior of local government officials is endogenous to China's central-local structure and that competition among localities has become distorted and constrained by various policy burdens and development mandates imposed from above. The information asymmetry for the enforcement cost of mandates that exists between central and local governments not only leads to difficulties and distortions in local performance evaluations, but also creates opportunities for local bureaucracy expansion and rent-seeking. Enhancing fiscal transfers, or strengthening political restraint, although necessary, would be far from enough to solve the local governance problems. The ultimate solution entails an in-depth deregulation reform on factor mobility and a furthest eradication of policy mandates for the local government. <b>Copyright</b> <b>Institute</b> of World Economics and Politics, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences 2006. ...|$|R
40|$|Microfinance, the {{provision}} of small size loans and other financial services to low income households, is often seen as the key innovation of the last 25 years in terms of means of {{reaching out to the}} poor and vulnerable. There is extensive experience in microfinance provision in both Asia and Latin America, but as yet relatively little use of the approach in China. This paper assesses different approaches to microfinance delivery using a threefold distinction, the credit union approach, the non-government organization approach and the banking approach, to generalize across recent Asian and Latin American experience and discuss the role of microfinance in poverty reduction in a theoretical framework. Considering the current state of microfinance in China and international experience, we suggest the banking approach as the way to best increase outreach of micro-financial services in China. <b>Copyright</b> <b>Institute</b> of World Economics and Politics, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences 2006. ...|$|R

40|$|A better {{comprehension}} of the mixed sentiment {{in the rest of}} world towards the rapid rise of the Chinese economy will depend on the understanding of some key features of the Chinese economy, such as those associated with its size, structure and institution. To further sustain its high growth, China is facing more challenges than it has encountered in the past 2 decades, including a gamut of material constraints. Although polices and technological progress might alleviate many of these constraints, the ultimate solution will still lie in continued institutional reform. China's recent move towards a more flexible exchange rate regime is in line with its broad reform and in accordance with the progress of its development. However, such a move will have limited immediate effects on the prodigious US trade deficit, which itself is a problem rooted in the flawed international reserve system, far beyond a Sino-US trade issue. <b>Copyright</b> <b>Institute</b> of World Economics and Politics, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences 2006. ...|$|R

Although the experimental refutation of this kind of inequality is extremely difficult when macroscopic systems are involved, we can get some insight into the problem by studying systems at an intermediate scale. In this case, the non-invasive measurability assumption does not hold; the inhibition of dynamics for continuous monitoring (quantum Zeno effect) is one consequence of this. However, directly testable Bell-type inequalities can be derived if one replaces the non-invasive measurability assumption by a stationarity condition. Accordingly to a realist approach, such inequalities should hold for any (strictly) two-state stochastic process.
