40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to establish an in-depth understanding of task-related occupant behaviors toserve {{as the basis for the}} design of an occupant-building interaction interface. Building simulations arefrequently used to design buildings and predict energy performance. Yet, all of these assumptions are relatedto occupant behavior and interactions with the building. In an occupant-controlled environment, anunderstanding of the occupant decision-making process must be represented in the simulation task lists. Current task lists assume <b>general</b> <b>occupant</b> behaviors based on averages, and lack the details required for thisunderstanding. This paper looks to strike a balance between simplicity and complexity in the generation oftask lists to establish a process for developing an understanding of occupant behavior at a greater level ofdetail than current practice. A contextual task analysis questionnaire characterizes occupant behavior toprovide the link between the building, occupant, and task. Generation of a sample task list demonstrates howa detailed understanding of task-related occupant behaviors can be effectively used as the basis of anoccupant-building control scheme...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{development}} of a methodology for identifying and improving occupant behavior in existing residential buildings. In this study, end-use loads were divided into two levels (i. e. main and sub-category), and they were used to deduce corresponding two-level user activities (i. e. general and specific occupant behavior) indirectly. The proposed method is based on three basic data mining techniques: cluster analysis, classification analysis, and association rules mining. Cluster analysis and classification analysis are combined to analyze the main end-use loads, so as to identify energy-inefficient <b>general</b> <b>occupant</b> behavior. Then, association rules are mined to examine end-use loads at both levels, so as to identify energy-inefficient specific occupant behavior. In order to demonstrate its applicability, this methodology was applied to a group of residential buildings in Japan, and one building with the most comprehensive household appliances was selected as the case building. The results show that, for the case building, the method was able to identify the behavior which needs to be modified, and provide occupants with feasible recommendations so that they can make required decisions. Also, a reference building can be identified for the case building to evaluate its energy-saving potential due to occupant behavior modification. The results obtained could help building occupants to modify their behavior, thereby significantly reducing building energy consumption. Moreover, given that the proposed method is partly based on the comparison with similar buildings, it could motivate building occupants to modify their behavior...|$|E
40|$|During {{the winter}} of 1985 - 86, a {{retrofit}} field test was performed in 66 occupied, low-income, single-family homes in Madison, Wisconsin. The primary objectives of the field test were to (1) determine the measured energy savings and the relative benefits {{of a combination of}} envelope and mechanical equipment retrofits that were selected following a new audit-directed retrofit procedure, (2) determine the energy savings and benefits due to performing infiltration reduction work following a recently developed infiltration reduction procedure, and (3) study <b>general</b> <b>occupant</b> behavior and house thermal characteristics and their possible change following retrofit installation. This report provides an overview of the project and summarizes the findings which will be presented in detail in separate reports. Major findings from the field test include: (1) The audit-directed retrofit procedure produced an average savings of 207 therms/year/house. The procedure also more than doubled the overall cost-effectiveness of the low-income weatherization assistance program as compared with the priority system formerly used in Wisconsin. Wall insulation and condensing furnaces were the major retrofits (predicted annual energy savings greater than 100 therms/year) most often selected under the procedure. The respective average energy savings of the houses receiving wall insulation and condensing furnace. s was 14. 6 and 14. 3 therms/year for each $ 100 spent on them under the program. (2) The blower-door-guided infiltration reduction procedure reduced expenditures for infiltration reduction to about one-fourth of previous program costs (from $ 570 /house to $ 106 /house). The procedure also reduced the average air leakage rate in the treated houses by 16 %, whereas, in a previous study, no significant reduction was found following the installation of typical infiltration reduction measures. (3) Twenty to 60 % of the deviation between predicted and measured savings can be attributed to incorrect assumptions regarding the indoor temperature before and after retrofit used in making the predictions. Incorrect assumptions regarding the value of the indoor temperature before retrofit may be more prevalent than incorrect assumptions regarding a constant indoor temperature following retrofit, as the occupants did not generally increase their indoor temperature after retrofit installation (the occupants did not generally display ''take back'' behavior) ...|$|E

This study was conducted to evaluate the performance of space cooling and surface condensation prevention of an RFCS applied with FCU for dehumidification and supplementary space cooling in a multi-zone house, as compared with a conventional cooling system, such as a packaged air conditioner. In Korea, cooling systems for residential buildings predominantly involve the provision of cooling for the whole house by installing a PAC in the living room or in the living room and an additional main room (statistical data addressed in Sect.  2.2). In <b>general,</b> <b>occupants</b> tend to open the doors of each room except for at bed time in residential buildings. Therefore, it was considered to install FCU for dehumidification and supplementary space cooling in the living room only in a manner similar to typical cooling system installations. We evaluated the performance in terms of space cooling and surface condensation prevention in each room, even in cases where FCU was installed in a representative room, such as the living room. The issue of the installation of an FCU for dehumidification in each room was left for a future study.|$|R

Some of them are unaware of any controllable installations that lead to frustration and ultimately impacts on the reputation of certain areas on campus. Interviewed occupants believe that fully automated indoor control might have some undesired consequences, such as unintended temperature drops, and they need to manually control indoor climate when the building automation fails to provide proper indoor climate.|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} decades, public and {{governmental}} awareness on thermal comfort and {{indoor air quality}} (IAQ) has been growing. In buildings the number of potential pollutants is significant, and even low concentration levels can cause health problems (increased incidence of asthma and allergies, for example) if combined effects are considered. Therefore, the assessment of IAQ {{is very important to}} ensure health, well-being and productivity.  This paper presents the results of a thermal comfort conditions and IAQ assessment of two hospital buildings with natural ventilation. The air temperature, the black bulb temperature, air velocity, relative humidity and the concentration of suspended particles, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, ozone, formaldehyde and total volatile organic compounds were measured. A standard questionnaire was delivered to the occupants to also obtain a subjective assessment of the thermal comfort and IAQ conditions. The goal {{of this study was to}} verify the thermal and IAQ conditions inside Portuguese hospital buildings. The results showed that, in <b>general,</b> the <b>occupants</b> were uncomfortable and that the main IAQ problems were related to high concentrations of carbon dioxide, volatile organic compounds and formaldehyde. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|Building energy {{consumption}} {{is shaped by}} a variety of factors which prompts a challenge of accurately predicting the building energy performance. Research findings disclosed a significant gap between the building’s predicted and actual energy performance. One of the key factors behind this gap is the occupant’s behavior during operation which includes a set of dependent and independent parameters generating a greater level of uncertainties. To accurately estimate the energy performance, we need to quantify the impact of any observed parameters and further detect its correlation with other parameters. Human behaviors are complex and quantifying the impact of all its interconnected parameters can be error prone and costly. To minimize the performance gap, more scalable and accurate prediction approaches, such as supervised machine learning methods, should be considered. This paper is devoted to investigate the most commonly used supervised learning methods which, when intertwined with conventional building energy performance prediction model, could potentially provide more accurate and reliable estimates. The paper will pinpoint the best use of each studied method in the relation to energy prediction in <b>general</b> and <b>occupant’s</b> behavior in specific and how it can be implemented to better predict building energy performance...|$|R
40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the XXXIII IAHS World Congress on Housing, 27 - 30 September 2005,"Transforming Housing Environments through Design", University of Pretoria. The contemporary debate and practice in architecture focuses {{on the role of}} the occupant in the design and quality of housing. Due to a change in occupation or the dynamic nature of people’s lives over time, housing design requires a variety of interior arrangements such as flexibility, freedom, inclusiveness, etc. However, this nature of the individual occupant is usually not considered in mass housing developments, which create a tension between the general and the individual requirements. The recent housing patterns and trends reveal the need for particularization at certain degrees and consequently the importance of designing adaptable housing. When the recent ‘construction boom’ in the island of Cyprus is considered, hundreds of mass housing units denote the range of changes to adapt the housing units during the pre and post occupancy periods. The development of mass housing is under the impact of rapid socio-economic and technical transformations. Furthermore, preference of foreigners to settle in Cyprus has created a need for designers and builders to inquire about occupants and their choices. In <b>general,</b> <b>occupants,</b> who are native (Turkish Cypriot), native living in the UK and the British, change and adapt their housing units. At this point, it is a matter of question if there is any commonality or divergence in the changes to houses made by different profiles of users. Without doubt, it is important to understand the range of architectural changes due to societal phenomena for launching design ideas and concepts. They provide the occupants with greater preoccupancy choice and the opportunity for later adaptability. Under this scope, the aim is to understand the nature and degree of changes in the houses selected from different mass housing areas in the city of Girne (Kyrenia). This city on the north coast of the island has been densely settled by locals and foreigners. According to the findings obtained from personal observations and interviews with the occupants, change and adaptations are interpreted by considering the variables of the three occupant groups mentioned above.

40|$|Australia {{is faced}} with the {{challenge}} of housing and caring for an increasingly ageing population. As the human body ages its sensitivity to changes in the thermal environment diminishes. This paper discusses a recent survey of older people living in Adelaide, South Australia, about the conditions of their living environment, their general health conditions {{and the ways in which}} they operate their houses. Selected dwellings are being monitored to record indoor temperatures and humidity while a long term thermal comfort survey of the occupants is being conducted. This paper will discuss preliminary results of this thermal comfort survey for the summer period. The results found that in <b>general</b> the selected <b>occupants</b> perceived their dwellings to be thermally acceptable; however there are some potentially hazardous trends around the use (or not) of heating and cooling. Overall, the thermal comfort surveys in conjunction with the temperature and humidity data indicate a preference among older people for cooler temperatures than typically considered comfortable by the healthy adult population. Balancing these preferences for both temperature and mechanical heating and cooling usage is vital for creating an environment for health and comfort in later life.

This financial benefit is owing to differences between the import and export prices, which in some cases can be a factor of four or more. Quantifying the exact financial benefit in terms of the dwelling’s effective electricity prices is, however, not trivial; it depends on the physical meter arrangement, the dwelling’s electricity tariffs (including any feed-in-tariff), the instantaneous levels of PV generation and household demand. This study reviews typical metering and tariff configurations for the UK, and Germany, and systematically considers how the effective price may be calculated. This study reviews and expands upon <b>general</b> advice for <b>occupants</b> aiming to reduce electricity bills: demand should be kept below generation; external irradiance is a useful proxy for determining effective electricity prices. Furthermore, designers of feed-in tariffs should consider that focusing on generation payments encourages consumption typically around mid-day, which may be counterproductive from a grid-balancing and environmental perspective. Conversely, a focus on export payments discourages mid-day consumption but may increase the risk of over-voltages in local networks...|$|R

Masters final project submitted to the Faculty of the Graduate School of the University of Maryland, College Park, in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Historic Preservation. HISP 710 / 711 Spring 2010. Arlington House, located within Arlington National Cemetery and now managed by the National Park Service, was built in a three phase, sixteen-year construction sequence (1802 - 1818), and is considered the first American example of adapting the principles of Grecian style architecture to a domestic building. Despite its historic designation as a National Monument in 1925, the interpretation at Arlington House does not adequately portray the significance of its early history and architecture nor its contribution {{to the development of}} the nation’s capital. Federal legislation requires the site interpretation to portray the period of April 1861, when its last <b>occupants,</b> <b>General</b> Robert E. Lee and his family, departed following Virginia’s secession from the Union. The emphasis on Lee’s tenancy overshadows the early history of Arlington House and the contributions of its owner, George Washington Parke Custis, and architect, George Hadfield. By providing a comprehensive historical overview of the development of Arlington House, this research is intended to: (1) outline the major factors that shaped its history to promote a broader understanding of its national significance as a historic site; and (2) promote a greater appreciation of architect George Hadfield’s professional accomplishments and his contribution towards developing an American vernacular form of residential Greek Revival architecture. This paper will argue for a more broadly representative site interpretation that expands the current interpretation by placing greater emphasis on the significance of its early history and architectural design. Identifying the factors that have shaped the historical and architectural significance of Arlington House is critical in advocating for a comprehensive approach to its public site interpretation. Ultimately, this research questions the relevancy of the existing federal legislation that mandates the interpretation while advocating a policy change that seeks to incorporate a broader approach to how site interpretation is presented at house museums managed by the National Park Service...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{evaluate}} numerically the human thermal response that 24 students and 1 teacher feel in a classroom equipped with radiant cooling systems and subjected to uniform convective environments, in lightly warm conditions. The evolution of thermal comfort conditions, using the PMV index, is made by the multi-nodal human thermal comfort model. In this numerical model, that works in transient or steady-state conditions and simulates simultaneously a group of persons, the three-dimensional body is divided in 24 cylindrical and 1 spherical elements. Each element is divided in four parts (core, muscle, fat and skin), sub-divided in several layers, and protected by several clothing layers. This numerical model is divided in six parts: human body thermal system, clothing thermal system, integral equations resolution system, thermoregulatory system, heat exchange between {{the body and the}} environment and thermal comfort evaluation. Seven different radiant systems are combined to three convective environments. In the radiant systems (1) no radiant system without warmed curtain, (2) no radiant system with warmed curtain, (3) radiant floors cooling system with warmed curtain, (4) radiant panels cooling system with warmed curtain, (5) radiant ceiling cooling system with warmed curtain, (6) radiant floor and panels cooling system with warmed curtain and (7) radiant ceiling and panels cooling system with warmed curtain are analysed, while in the convective environments (1) without air velocity field and with uniform air velocity field of (2) 0. 2 m/s and (3) 0. 6 m/s are also analysed. The internal air temperature and internal surfaces temperature are 28 degrees C, the radiant cooling surfaces temperature are 19 degrees C and the warmed internal curtains surfaces temperatures, subjected to direct solar radiation, are 40 degrees C. The numerical model calculates the Mean Radiant Temperature field, the human bodies' temperatures field and the thermal comfort level, for the 25 occupants, for the 21 analysed situations. Without uniform air velocity field, when only one individual radiant cooling system is used, the Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfied people is lowest when the radiant floor cooling system is applied and is highest when the radiant panel cooling system is applied. When are combined the radiant ceiling or the floor cooling systems with the radiant panel cooling system the Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfied people decreases. When the uniform air velocity increases the thermal comfort level, that the occupants are subjected, increases. When the radiant floor cooling system or the combination of radiant floor and panel cooling systems without uniform air velocity field is applied, the Category C is verified for some occupants. However, with a convective uniform air velocity field of 0. 2 m/s the Category B is verified and with a convective uniform air velocity field of 0. 6 m/s the Category A is verify for some occupants.

40|$|Mitigating {{injury in}} side impact {{has been an}} {{important}} topic of research for decades. In the mid 1980 ’s the American government began a program intended to improve the crashworthiness of vehicles in side impact. This program ultimately led to the introduction of a dynamic side impact test (Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 214), which new vehicles must pass, along with a very similar test aimed at consumer awareness (New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) side impact test). The work presented in this thesis involved the study and simulation of these tests to evaluate occupant response in side impact, with a focus on the thoracic response. In the first portion of the work presented here, an in-depth study of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) crash test database was performed. In this study the results of the side impact crash tests of 72 vehicles were examined to understand the general trends seen in this type of testing with regards to vehicle velocity, side intrusion, and occupant injury prediction. A series of average velocity profile curves was created from accelerometer data at 18 measurement points on each vehicle crash tested. Additionally the injury criterion measured by the front seat occupant was plotted against several vehicle variables (such as mass and occupant arm to door distance) to study the effect these variable had on the injury predicted by the occupant. No single variable was shown to have a strong correlation to injury, although increasing door intrusion distance, peak lateral velocity, the Head Injury Criterion (HIC), and pelvic acceleration were found to positively correlate to thoracic injury. In addition, increasing vehicle model year, vehicle mass, and arm to door (AD) distance showed negative correlations with thoracic injury. Following the survey of the NHTSA database, a finite element model of the NHTSA side impact test was developed. This model included a full scale Ford Taurus model, a NHTSA barrier model and three side impact anthropometric test device (ATD) occupant models, each representing a different 50 th percentile male dummy. Validation of this model was carried out by comparing the simulated vehicle component velocity results to the corridors developed in the NHSTA crash test database study as well as comparing these velocities, the vehicle deformation profile, and the occupant velocity, acceleration and rib deflection to several Ford Taurus crash tests from a similar vintage to the finite element model. As this model was intended as a ‘baseline’ case to study side impact and occupant kinematics in side impact, side airbags were not included in this model. A lack of experimental data and a lack of consensuses within the automotive crash community on the proper method of modeling these devices and their effectiveness in real world impacts also led to their exclusion. Following model validation, a parametric study was carried out to assess the importance of the initial position of the occupant on the vehicle door velocity profile and the predicted occupant injury response. Additionally the effect of the door trim material properties, arm rest properties and the effect of seat belt use were studied. It was found that the lateral position of the occupant had an effect on the door velocity profile, while the vertical and longitudinal position did not. The use of seatbelts was shown to have no significant effect in these simulations, due to minimal interaction between the restraint system and occupant during side impact. Furthermore, there was a general decreasing trend in the injury predicted as the initial position of the occupant was moved further inboard, down and forward in the vehicle. Stiffer interior trim was found to improve the injury prediction of the occupant, while changing the material of the foam door inserts had no effect. It was found that in <b>general</b> the <b>occupant</b> remained in position, due to the inertia of the occupant, while the seat began moving towards the centerline of the vehicle. Future considerations could include more advanced restraint systems to couple the occupant more effectively to the seat, or to develop side interior trim that engages the occupant earlier to reduce the relative velocity between the occupant and intruding door. Overall, the model correlated well with experimental data and provided insight into several areas which could lead to improved occupant protection in side impact. Future work should include integrating side airbags into the model, widening the focus of the areas of injury to include other body regions and integrating more detailed human body models...|$|R
