40|$|ABSTRACT Regulation of {{dwelling}} house’s <b>green</b> <b>open</b> {{space has}} been compiled {{from the center}} to the regions, but the provision of dwelling house’s <b>green</b> <b>open</b> space often marginalized by non-ecological space to function needs, especially for a small land ownership society. Village Panjunan, Kudus was selected in this study {{because it is a}} village in the most densely populated urban areas. The results showed that the level of public knowledge that has small land in the Village Panjunan, in the category of pretty. Most people have a small piece of land is not aware of any provision of the open space in the residence. In addition, people also do not know how appropriate composition rules. The absence of sanctions or rewards in the provision of open space further weakened in its application. Not optimal socialization become noteworthy, therefore, to increase support for realizing a green city with dwelling house’s <b>green</b> <b>open</b> space, should begin with increasing socialization of regulations related dwelling house’s <b>green</b> <b>open</b> space.

Planning for <b>green</b> <b>open</b> spaces in particular can play an important role, as they support important ecosystem services, including those that assist in flood management. It has been argued that interconnected and strategically planned networks of <b>green</b> <b>open</b> spaces should be planned for early in land use planning and design processes, with consideration of water-related ecosystem values and landscape functions in concert with land development, growth management and physical infrastructure planning. Although there is growing {{recognition of the}} importance of <b>green</b> <b>open</b> space planning for water sensitive cities and supportive planning measures, there are few analyses of the actual inclusion of this recognition in plans and strategies, or the presence of related actions and planning mechanisms. This paper addresses this gap by comparatively analysing the approaches taken to regional <b>green</b> <b>open</b> space planning in three Australian capital city-regions. Findings indicate the acknowledgement of relationships between flood regulation and <b>green</b> <b>open</b> space planning and various associated planning mechanisms. However, there is limited explicit integration of flood management and <b>green</b> <b>open</b> spaces planning, and significant on-ground barriers to enabling this integration to occur given the legacy of past planning decisions and the lack of information to support implementation. The paper concludes with recommendations for further research to assist planning for <b>green</b> <b>open</b> spaces as an ally to ecosystem services relating to flood management.

Actualizing the green city, one of its attributes <b>green</b> <b>open</b> space is strictly regulated in Law No. 26 Year 2007 about Spatial Planning. The total area of the city 30 % must be used as <b>green</b> <b>open</b> space (RTH), 20 % as public RTH and 10 % as private RTH. The purposes of this research are identifying vast and distribution of land use and RTH existing in Yogyakarta city, analyzing the adequacy of RTH based on vast territory and total population, determining areas that could potentially be developed for RTH, and arranging development strategy toward to Yogyakarta Green City. Several methods were used in this research, among others : image interpretation and analysis the adequacy of RTH is calculated based on vast territory and total population. The results showed that RTH eksisiting is 584. 45 ha or 17. 78 %, consisting public <b>green</b> <b>open</b> space covering an area of 329. 63 ha and private <b>green</b> <b>open</b> space for 254. 82 ha. Based on vast territory, Yogyakarta city still needs 390. 55 ha of  <b>green</b> <b>open</b> space, while based on total population, <b>green</b> <b>open</b> space still lack for 220. 91 ha. Potential area in Yogyakarta City is 30. 94 ha. RTH development strategy of Yogyakarta City focused on maintaining and increasing the quality of existing RTH, adding unused area as public RTH and developing green corridor. This indicates that <b>green</b> <b>open</b> space in Yogyakarta city is not sufficient based on the standard needed toward Green City...|$|R

One {{of them is the}} transfer of <b>Green</b> <b>open</b> spaces become business sector farm and or settlement. Even in cities of Malang of <b>Green</b> <b>open</b> spaces progressively finished and only just have <b>Green</b> <b>open</b> spaces again.

Hence than that, researcher interest to see how Ormas perception to switchover of <b>Green</b> <b>open</b> spaces. space function of is intention of this research is first, to know Perception Ormas to Switchover of <b>Green</b> <b>open</b> spaces in cities of Malang. second, To explain important meaning of <b>Green</b> <b>open</b> spaces to importance of society. As for As for this research type is descriptive qualitative, intake of data by using research subject, and technics of data collecting is observation, structure interview and documentation, by using told data analysis by Miles and Habermas namely data collecting, Discount Data, Presentation of Data, Withdrawal of Conclusion. As for from result of this research there are matters namely start from change which emerge that goodness of physical like popping out new economic sector like Malang Town Square, Mall Olympic Garden, as well as some luxuriant settlement, besides environmental change like environmental damage, floods. While change of caused social progressively the loss of <b>green</b> <b>open</b> spaces which is public area automatically will cause change of society like appearance srewed, besides by changing <b>green</b> <b>open</b> spaces it also will change society tend to to have hedonis and konsumeris. change of prosperity there are two perception, first, positive perception that with change of <b>green</b> <b>open</b> spaces will improve prosperity of Malang.
