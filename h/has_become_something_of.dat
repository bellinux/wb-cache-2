25|$|The {{phenomenon}} of Messianic Judaism <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> an irritant to Jewish / Christian relations. Messianic Jews—who generally seek to combine a Jewish identity with {{the recognition of}} Jesus—are rejected by mainstream Jewish groups, who dismiss Messianic Judaism {{as little more than}} Christianity with Jewish undertones.|$|E

50|$|As it is {{a fairly}} small town, Bry-sur-Marne is one station (along with {{neighbouring}} Neuilly-Plaisance) where trains do not systematically stop, in either direction.

25|$|Since {{the initial}} {{approval}} of the system from the public, local and national government, and environmental groups, Metrolink <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> a victim of its own popularity. Many routes are extremely busy, especially at peak times, and prices have risen at far above the rate of inflation. The network has also gained {{a reputation for being}} somewhat unreliable. In 2011, Stagecoach Manchester who operated the Metrolink under contract to Transport for Greater Manchester, sold the contract to the RATP Group.|$|E
25|$|Harmonia axyridis (the {{harlequin}} ladybird) is {{an example}} of how an animal might be partly welcome and partly harmful. It was introduced into North America from Asia in 1916 to control aphids, but is now the most common species, outcompeting many of the native species. It has since spread to much of western Europe, reaching the UK in 2004. It <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> a domestic and agricultural pest in some regions, and gives cause for ecological concern. It has similarly arrived in parts of Africa, where it has proved variously unwelcome, perhaps most prominently in vine-related crops.|$|E
25|$|The {{character}} of Scully <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> a sci-fi heroine {{due to her}} intelligence and resilience, frequently appearing on lists of important female science fiction characters, such as Total Sci-Fi Onlines list of The 25 Women Who Shook Sci-Fi, where she came in fourth.

25|$|Scrooge never {{completed}} a formal education, {{as he left}} school at an early age. However, he has a sharp mind and is always ready to learn new skills. Because of his secondary occupation as a treasure hunter, Scrooge <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> a scholar and an amateur archaeologist. Starting with Barks, several writers have explained how Scrooge becomes aware of the treasures he decides to pursue. This often involves periods of research consulting various written sources in search of passages that might lead him to a treasure. Often Scrooge decides {{to search for the}} possible truth behind old legends, or discovers obscure references to the activities of ancient conquerors, explorers and military leaders that he considers interesting enough to begin a new expedition.|$|E
25|$|In 1989, Falsk and Mathisen {{wrote and}} created the film Showbiz, where Falsk played the movie's protagonist, a loser obsessed with {{becoming}} a pop star, while Mathisen played six different supporting roles. According to Falsk, he and Mathisen were determined to break every screenwriting rule and ignore every film cliché when writing the script. Falsk also directed the film, which was slaughtered by the critics after its premiere in September 1989, and bombed at the box office. Nonetheless, Showbiz <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> a cult film in Norway. The duo's next project, the television show Tom Mathisen og Herodes Falsks latterlige verden (The ridiculous world of Tom Mathisen and Herodes Falsk), which aired on the cable channel TVNorge, was more successful. The TV show was basically an extension of Falsk/Mathisen's live act and featured sketches, songs, television parodies and bits of Falsk's stand-up material.|$|E
25|$|Responding to its sentimental public, Argentine film {{at times}} returns to {{subjects}} of the heart. David Lipszyc's grainy portrait of depression-era Argentina, El astillero ("The Shipyard", 2000) was a hit with critics, Paula Hernandez's touching ode to immigrants, Inheritance (2001), <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> a sleeper, Adolfo Aristarain's Common Places (2002) follows an elderly professor into retirement, Cleopatra (2003), Eduardo Mignona's tale of an unlikely friendship, received numerous awards, as did Carlos Sorín's touching El perro ("The Dog", 2004). Emotional negativity, a staple for filmmakers anywhere, was explored in Mario Sabato's India Pravile (2003), Francisco D'Intino's La esperanza (2005) and Ariel Rotter's El otro ("The Other", 2007) each deals with mid-life crises in very different ways. The pronounced sentimentality of the average Argentine was also the subject of Robert Duvall's 2002 Assassination Tango, a deceptively simple crime drama that shows that still waters do, indeed, run deep.|$|E
50|$|The {{big things}} <b>have</b> <b>become</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> a cult phenomenon, and are {{sometimes}} {{used as an}} excuse for a road trip, where many or all big things are visited and used as a backdrop to a group photograph.

50|$|Despite {{the fact}} that over its {{production}} run {{tens of thousands of}} GSXR1100s were produced and sold all over the world, original examples in good condition <b>have</b> <b>become</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> a rarity. Many bikes were ridden hard and they were often crashed. As a result, they became and remain a popular starting point for street fighters and customs.|$|R
50|$|In 1975, Seventeen {{magazine}} {{found that}} King {{was the most}} admired {{woman in the world}} from a poll of its readers.

25|$|Situated on {{the mouth}} of the River Shannon, Limerick has been an {{important}} gateway city for over 800 years.

Artists' works in the museum include Pablo Picasso, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Jack B. Yeats and Henry Moore.|$|E
500|$|In the insert song [...] "nowhere", {{there is}} a {{frequently}} repeated background refrain [...] It doesn't have any particular meaning but since the song usually plays when Madlax is fighting, [...] "Yanmaani" [...] <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> a joke to Japanese fans, claiming that it apparently gives her superpowers.|$|E
500|$|Some fans, however, {{criticized the}} {{introduction}} of Doggett; claiming that the character had been intentionally created to replace Mulder. Carter responded to this {{in an interview with}} National Public Radio (NPR) by stating, [...] "What he brings is a different approach to The X-Files. First of all, he’s a knee jerk skeptic so he couldn’t be more different than the character of Mulder. He’s an insider at the FBI, well liked, has buddies. Mulder, of course, he’s been banished to the basement along with all of his X-files. So when he’s put together with Agent Scully, who <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> a reluctant believer, the dynamic on the show changes completely".|$|E
50|$|The town's {{role as a}} port {{declined}} from the 18th century, and by Victorian times it <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> a 'ghost town'. The harbour was filled in and the sea cut off by the coastal railway line {{in the second half}} of the 19th century (though the outer harbour has recently been restored by a local group).|$|R
5000|$|During {{the early}} 1930s [...] "Tiger Rag" [...] became a {{standard}} showoff piece for Big Band arrangers and soloists, especially in England, where Ambrose, Jack Hylton, Lew Stone, Billy Cotton, Jack Payne, and Ray Noble all made recordings of it. The tune fell from popularity during the Swing era, as it <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> a cliché.|$|R
5000|$|Piracy <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> a bogeyman, and defence from pirates is {{frequently}} given {{as one of}} the reasons for cities to set up honorific decrees for individuals, as with the c. 166 BC decree from Imbros: [...] ""Lysanias is benevolent towards the people … he stood firm and brought news of the descent of pirates" ...|$|R
