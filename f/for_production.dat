A large wind farm may consist of several hundred individual wind turbines distributed over an extended area, but the land between the turbines may be used for agricultural or other purposes. For example, Gansu Wind Farm, the largest wind farm in the world, has several thousand turbines. A wind farm may also be located offshore.|$|E

5|$|Early in production, Warner Bros. {{decided to}} release Phantasm as a {{theatrical}} release, rather than straight to video. That left {{less than a}} year <b>for</b> <b>production</b> time (most animated features take well over two years from finished story to final release). Due to this decision, the animators went over the scenes in order to accommodate the widescreen theatrical aspect ratio. The studio cooperated well, granting the filmmakers a large amount of creative control.|$|E

The fighter was not accepted <b>for</b> <b>production</b> as it was inferior to the swept-wing fighters like the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15.|$|E

5|$|Worldwide {{production}} of thorium {{is a few}} tens of tons per year. The low demand makes working mines for extraction of thorium alone not profitable, and it is almost always extracted with the rare earths, which themselves may be by-products of {{production of}} other minerals. The current reliance on monazite <b>for</b> <b>production</b> is due to thorium being largely produced as a by-product; other sources such as thorite contain more thorium and could easily be used <b>for</b> <b>production</b> if demand rose. Present knowledge {{of the distribution of}} thorium resources is poor, as low demand has led to exploration efforts being relatively minor.|$|E
5|$|A 3km {{protection}} zone, 10km {{surveillance zone}} and a restricted zone encompassing 2000km2 were set up. Another 159,000 turkeys were slaughtered with the cull being completed {{on the evening}} of 5 February. Also on 5 February there was criticism that nearby farmers had not been advised as to the action to be taken. Around 320 workers at the plant were given anti-viral drugs. Although a vet from the site was admitted into hospital, suffering from a 'mild respiratory illness' during the evening of 6 February, it was found not to be bird flu. The plant was thoroughly disinfected, with cleaning complete on 12 February, and permission being given <b>for</b> <b>production</b> to resume.|$|E
