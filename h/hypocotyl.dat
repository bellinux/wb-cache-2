AOA declined the contents of chlorophylls a and b and total carotenoids in buckwheat cotyledons. The results show that AOA inhibits phenylpropanoids biosynthesis in buckwheat <b>hypocotyls,</b> and suppress photosynthesis in cotyledons. Moreover, the experiments show that AOA enhances the level of free putrescine in <b>hypocotyls</b> {{and the level of}} spermidine in buckwheat cotyledons.

Afterwards anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins content, as well as elongation of primary roots and <b>hypocotyls</b> were measured. When applied as solutions cis-jasmone (JAS) stimulated the anthocyanins accumulation, but when used as vapors had tendency to decrease its accumulation in buckwheat <b>hypocotyls.</b> Jasmonic acid (JA) solutions slightly stimulated or had no effect on biosynthesis of anthocyanins in buckwheat <b>hypocotyls,</b> but used as vapors caused a decline of anthocyanins in buckwheat <b>hypocotyls.</b> Methyl jasmonate (MJ) clearly inhibited biosynthesis of anthocyanins in <b>hypocotyls</b> of buckwheat seedlings. The studied jasmonates had no influence on anthocyanins level in cotyledons of buckwheat seedlings, except cis-jasmone, which at the lowest solution concentration slightly enhanced biosynthesis of the pigments. Treatment of buckwheat seedlings with solutions of all jasmonates (10 - 8 M, 10 - 6 M and 10 - 4 M) had no influence on the growth of buckwheat <b>hypocotyls.</b> Contrary to that observation vapors of the growth regulators in concentrations 10 - 4 M, had a strong inhibitory effect on the growth of <b>hypocotyls</b> of buckwheat seedlings.

40|$|The {{effect of}} methyl jasmonate (MJ) vapors on content of {{phenolic}} compounds: free phenolic acids, total quercetin, and total phenolics in etiolated buckwheat seedlings were studied. The data presented show that low concentration of MJ (10 - 8 M) had no influence on trans -cinnamic acid (CA), but stimulated {{the accumulation of}} chlorogenic acid in <b>hypocotyls</b> and cotyledons of buckwheat seedlings. A moderate dose of MJ (10 - 6 M) did not change the level of chlorogenic acid in the <b>hypocotyls</b> and cotyledons, but CA synthesis was promoted in cotyledons, whereas in <b>hypocotyls</b> no significant effect was found. Highest concentration of MJ (10 - 4 M) caused small decline of CA in <b>hypocotyls,</b> but large stimulation of the acid production in cotyledons was noted. MJ had stimulatory effect on caffeic acid forming, but inhibited synthesis of vanillic acid in <b>hypocotyls</b> and cotyledons. Lowest concentration of MJ (10 - 8 M) elicited accumulation of quercetin glycosides in both studied tissues of buckwheat seedlings, however at higher doses (10 - 8 and 10 - 4 M) {{did not affect the}} flavonol level. The obtained results suggest that nonequivalent influence of methyl jasmonate on the phenolics composition can be a result of various mechanisms of MJ uptake, transforming and/or its translocation in buckwheat <b>hypocotyls</b> and cotyledons. Decline of anthocyanins level in buckwheat <b>hypocotyls</b> caused by MJ cannot be explained by enhanced accumulation of quercetin glycosides or free phenolic acids, but probably by synthesis of other unknown phenolic compounds...|$|R

Secondly, the same type of comparison was carried out for caffeine and chlorogenic acid (CQA) contents. Cell wall polysaccharides (CWP) present in cotyledons, <b>hypocotyls</b> and roots were identified. Neither the laurina mutation nor the growth conditions {{had an impact on the}} CWP composition. By contrast, there were marked differences between cotyledons, <b>hypocotyls</b> and roots regarding their CWP composition, CQA and caffeine contents.

To elucidate this phenomenon, we have isolated a number of mutants with abnormal shoot gravitropic responses in Arabidopsis thaliana. Here we describe mainly three mutants: sgr 1 - 1, sgr 2 - 1, and sgr 3 - 1 (shoot gravitropism). Genetic analysis confirmed that these mutations were recessive and occurred at three independent loci, named SGR 1, SGR 2, and SGR 3, respectively. In wild type, both inflorescence stems and <b>hypocotyls</b> show negative gravitropic responses. The sgr 1 - 1 mutants showed no response to gravity either by inflorescence stems or by <b>hypocotyls.</b> The sgr 2 - 1 mutants also showed no gravitropic response in inflorescence stems but showed a reduced gravitropic response in <b>hypocotyls.</b> In contrast, the sgr 3 - 1 mutant was found to have reduced gravitropic responses in inflorescence stems but normal gravitropic responses in <b>hypocotyls.</b> These results suggest that some genetic components of the regulatory mechanisms for gravitropic responses are common between inflorescence stems and <b>hypocotyls,</b> but others are not. In addition, these sgr mutants were normal with respect to root gravitropism, and their inflorescence stems and <b>hypocotyls</b> could carry out phototropism.

De-etiolation treatment induced a larger difference between the growth rates at the lighted and shaded sides of the <b>hypocotyls,</b> resulting in a larger curvature of de-etiolated seedlings than of etiolated ones. The contents of growth inhibitors, cis- and trans-raphanusanins, increased in the lighted {{but not in the}} shaded halves of the <b>hypocotyls</b> of etiolated seedlings. In de-etiolated seedlings, the two inhibitors increased due to the de-etiolation treatment. When de-etiolated seedlings were exposed to a pulse of unilateral irradiation the level of the two inhibitors remained high along the lighted side for 1 h following the light pulse, whereas at the shaded side the contents of the inhibitors abruptly decreased upon transfer to the dark, the difference between their amounts in the lighted and shaded sides being larger than in etiolated seedlings. Another growth inhibitor, raphanusamide, did not respond to the phototropic stimulus, although its amounts increased by the de-etiolation treatment. These data suggest that cis- and trans-raphanusanins are involved in the first positive phototropic response of radish <b>hypocotyls,</b> and that de-etiolation magnifies the phototropic response through induction of a larger lateral gradient of the raphanusanins in the <b>hypocotyls</b> by the phototropic stimulus...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Arsenate {{is reduced}} to As(III) and causes the {{formation}} of free radicals in plants. Arsenic induces oxidative stress in the cell wall region and destroys the membrane permeability. Therefore the effect of arsenate on ion efflux, H 2 O 2 concentration, ascorbate concentration, ascorbate oxidase (AAO) activity and malondialdehyde formation was investigated in cucumber. The cucumber seedlings have a very sensitive period during their development. Under As(V) treatment of 7 -day-old plants the roots, <b>hypocotyls</b> and leaves are flaccid and the fresh weight of the roots decreases because of the efflux of water and solutes. H 2 O 2 significantly decreases while ascorbic acid concentration does not change compared to the control roots. In the <b>hypocotyls</b> H 2 O 2 does not change but ascorbic acid significantly increases. Ascorbic acid oxidase activity is higher in the roots and smaller in the <b>hypocotyls.</b> As(V) significantly lowers AAO activity in the roots (about 50 %) but increases in <b>hypocotyls</b> of 5 -day-old plants. Ascorbic acid protects the plants by preventing lipid peroxidation so the <b>hypocotyls</b> remains turgid, and the inhibition of growth is much smaller.

The seeds of corn are constructed with these structures; pericarp, scutellum (single large cotyledon) that absorbs nutrients from the endosperm, plumule, radicle, coleoptile and coleorhiza—these last two structures are sheath-like and enclose the plumule and radicle, acting as a protective covering.|$|E
25|$|In most {{monocotyledons}} (such as {{grasses and}} palms) and some (endospermic or albuminous) dicotyledons (such as castor beans) the embryo {{is embedded in}} the endosperm (and nucellus), which the seedling will use upon germination.

At maturity, seeds of these species have no endosperm and are also referred to as exalbuminous seeds. The exalbuminous seeds include the legumes (such as beans and peas), trees such as the oak and walnut, vegetables such as squash and radish, and sunflowers.

The Darwins concluded that the tip of the coleoptile was responsible for sensing light, and proposed that a messenger is transmitted in a downward direction from the tip of the coleoptile, causing it to bend.|$|E

These results indicated that the normal expression of resistance to the fungus and production of glyceollin both required de novo messenger RNA and protein synthesis early after infection. Furthermore, actinomycin D and blasticidin S also were effective in suppressing resistance expression and glyceollin production in soybean <b>hypocotyls</b> when inoculated with various Phytophthora species that were normally nonpathogenic to the plants.
