30|$|Single-wall carbon nanohorns [SWCNHs] are carbon {{nanostructures}} {{belonging to}} the family of carbon nanotubes. They consist of single layers of a graphene sheet wrapped into an irregular tubule with a variable diameter of 2 to 5 nm and a length of 30 to 50 nm, with cone-shaped tips [1 – 3]. The SWCNHs assemble to form roughly spherical aggregates with typical diameters of about 100 to 120 nm with three characteristic morphologies: dahlia-like, bud-like, and seed-like [3]. They exhibit both a large surface area and a large number of cavities [4] and therefore appear promising for a large variety of applications, including gas storage [5], drug delivery, [6] and solar energy [7, 8]. When the differences between SWCNHs and better-known carbon nanotubes are concerned, the absence of metals in SWCNHs (which are needed to catalyze nanotube growth) makes their cytotoxicity negligible [9]. Moreover, the minimum van der Waals interactions between the superstructures of SWCNH aggregates give rise to a better dispersion of SWCNHs in liquid media [10] and a much longer time stability of their suspensions. In fact, SWCNH aqueous suspensions have been demonstrated to be very stable [7] also when compared to more conventional carbon forms like amorphous carbon [11].

Direct evaporative cooling is employed at the air-cooled condenser of a split air-conditioning system to pre-cool the ambient air flowing over the condenser coils. Different ambient conditions of air were simulated using a heater to mimic typical high temperature environments. Rigid cellulose pads with thickness ranging from 2 - 6 inches (5. 1 cm- 15. 24 cm) served as the <b>heat</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>medium</b> for air-water interaction, and were tested to {{determine the influence of}} the pad thickness in pre-cooling the ambient air before it flows over the condenser coils to extract heat from the refrigerant in the condenser. It was observed that a 10 C drop in ambient air temperature causes the condensing temperature of the refrigerant to drop by 0. 60 C. This drop in condensing temperature of the refrigerant causes a decrease in power consumption of the unit, accompanied by an increase in Coefficient of Performance (COP). Results obtained shows that up to 44 % increase in COP, and a 20 % decrease in power consumption can be achieved by employing evaporative cooling. Additionally, the COP was found to increase by 4 % for every 10 C drop in refrigerant condensing temperature. The water consumption pattern of the hybrid system is monitored to provide a realistic estimate of the operating cost, and profitability of the hybrid system.

40|$|The {{mechanics}} of frying are fairly simple. Hot oil {{serves as a}} <b>heat</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>medium</b> in which heat is transferred to the food being fried. As a result, the heat converts water within the food to steam and melts the fat within the food. The steam and fat then migrate from {{the interior of the}} food through the exterior and into the oil. Conversely, some of the frying oil is absorbed into the food being fried. The chemistry occurring in the frying oil and in the food being fried includes a myriad of thermal and oxidative reactions involving lipids, proteins, carbohydrates and minor food constituents. Decomposition products by autoxidation above 100 °C, polimerization without oxigen between 200 - 300 °C and thermal oxidation at 200 °C, can be produced in frying oil and their amounts are related to different chemical and physical parameters such as temperature, heating time, type of oil used and food being fried, oil turnover rate, management of the oil and finally type of equipment used. Different studies have remarked as the toxicity of these by-products, is due to their chemistry and concentration. Since the prime requirement in food quality is the safety of the products, attainable through preventive analysis of the risks and total control through all frying processes, in this work the critical points of particular importance are identify and showed: Oil composition, and in particular its antioxidant capacity. Proper fryer design. Food/oil ratio. Good manufactured practice. Beside the quality screening has to be direct towards the chemical quality evaluation by easy and rapid analysis of oil (colour, polar compounds, free fatty acids and antioxidant capacity) and food fried (panel test and/or consumer test).

40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} examine the {{effective}} convective heat exchange of sand as a <b>heat</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>medium.</b> The goal of this exploratory research is to quantify the heat transfer coefficient of sand in a proposed Thermal Energy Storage (TES) system which intends to complement solar thermal power generation. Standard concentrator solar thermal power plants typically employ a heat transfer fluid (HTF) that is heated in the collector field then routed to the power generators or TES unit. A fairly clear option for a TES system would be to utilize the existing HTF as the working storage medium. However, the use of conventional HTF systems may be too expensive. These fluids are quite costly as the quantity needed for storage is high and for some fluids their associated high vapor pressures require expensive highly reinforced containment vessels. The proposed storage system seeks to use sand as the storage medium; greatly reducing the expenses involved for both medium and storage costs. Most prior TES designs using sand or other solids employed them in a fixed bed for thermal exchange. The proposed TES system will instead move the sand to drive a counter flow thermal exchange. This counter flow design allows for a much closer temperature of approach when compared to a fixed bed. As cost and performance are the primary goals to tackle of the proposed system, {{the evaluation of the}} sandâ s thermal exchange effectiveness in a flowing state is necessary. Experiments will be conducted to measure the effective heat transfer coefficient between the sand and representative solid surfaces used as the heat transfer conduits. Additional experiments that will be looked at are wear caused by the sand as a consideration for long term design viability as well as angle of repose of the sand and its effect on scoop design for improved materials handling. Key investigational aspects of these experiments involve the sand grain size as well as shape of the heat exchanger surfaces. The thesis will evaluate the resulting convective heat transfer coefficient of the sand as related to these features. The data will then be compared and verified with available literature of previously studied characteristic thermal properties of sand. The measured and confirmed data will then be used to further aid in a design model for the proposed TES system. M. S.

40|$|Geothermal energy can be {{extracted}} from an aquifer, where the groundwater {{is used as}} <b>heat</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>medium</b> while heat and cold are stored in the surrounding material in the aquifer {{and to some extent}} in the groundwater. Application of aquifer storage for the use of geothermal energy is mainly used in large scale facilities and is limited to sites with suitable aquifers in the form of ridges, sandstone and limestone aquifers. Löwenströmska hospital in the municipality of Upplands Väsby, north of Stockholm, is located nearby {{the northern part of the}} Stockholm esker. This means that it can be profitable and environmentally beneficial for the hospital to examine the possibilities of aquifer storage in the esker material next to its property. The purpose of this master thesis has been to investigate if geothermal energy storage with a seasonal storage of heat and cold can be applied within Löwenströmska hospital’s property area using groundwater modeling. A hydraulic groundwater model was constructed in MODFLOW based on a simplified conceptual model of the groundwater system. The hydraulic groundwater model was calibrated and validated against observed groundwater levels before and after a pumping test. The hydraulic groundwater model was then used to implement a fictitious geothermal energy storage with MT 3 DMS. MT 3 DMS is a modular function used with MODFLOW, which can be modified to simulate heat transport. The result shows that the geothermal energy storage can store seasonal heating and cooling of about 4 GWh, which covers 85 % of the hospital’s heating demand with an assumed SP-factor of 4, and the entire cooling demand. To cover 50 % of the peak heating power it was calculated that a flow of 63 l/s was needed, and according to the model this is possible. The geothermal energy storage does not need to be completely in energy balance, since the aquifer is recharged with its natural groundwater. The location of the wells influences which flows that are needed to create energy balance. A too close placement of the wells leads to a thermal breakthrough. The hydraulic conductivity of the esker material affects the amount of energy that can be stored. A higher hydraulic conductivity provides greater energy losses and a lower hydraulic conductivity favors the energy storage but gives a greater influence area. A number of assumptions have been made in the model construction of the hydrogeological model and further investigation of the geological and hydrogeological conditions are desirable to improve the model...|$|E

40|$|Faster, more {{powerful}} and dense computing hardware generates significant heat and imposes considerable data center cooling requirements. Traditional computer room air conditioning (CRAC) cooling methods are proving increasingly cost-ineffective and inefficient. Studies show that using the volume of room air as a <b>heat</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>medium</b> is wasteful and allows for substantial mixing of hot and cold air. Further, it limits cabinet/frame/rack density because it cannot effectively cool high heat density equipment that is spaced closely together. A more cost-effective, efficient solution for maximizing heat transfer and enabling higher heat density equipment frames {{can be accomplished by}} utilizing properly positioned ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂphase changeÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ or ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂtwo-phaseÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ pumped refrigerant cooling methods. Pumping low pressure, oil-free phase changing refrigerant through microchannel heat exchangers can provide up to 90 % less energy consumption for the primary cooling loop within the room. The primary benefits of such a solution include reduced energy requirements, optimized utilization of data center space, and lower OPEX and CAPEX. Alcatel-Lucent recently developed a modular cooling technology based on a pumped two-phase refrigerant that removes heat directly at the shelf level of equipment racks. The key elements that comprise the modular cooling technology consist of the following. A pump delivers liquid refrigerant to finned microchannel heat exchangers mounted on the back of equipment racks. Fans drive air through the equipment shelf, where the air gains heat dissipated by the electronic components therein. Prior to exiting the rack, the heated air passes through the heat exchangers, where it is cooled back down to the temperature level of the air entering the frame by vaporization of the refrigerant, which is subsequently returned to a condenser where it is liquefied and recirculated by the pump. All the cooling air enters and leaves the shelves/racks at nominally the same temperature. Results of a 100 kW prototype data center installation of the refrigerant-based modular cooling technology were dramatic in terms of energy efficiency and the ability to cool high-heat-density equipment. The prototype data center installation consisted of 10 racks each loaded with 10 kW of high-heat-density IT equipment with the racks arranged in a standard hot-aisle/cold-aisle configuration with standard cabinet spacing. A typical chilled-water CRAC unit would require approximately 16 kW to cool such a heat load. In contrast, the refrigerant-based modular cooling technology required only 2. 3 kW of power for the refrigerant pump and shelf-level fans, a reduction of 85 percent. Differences in hot-aisle and cold-aisle temperature were also substantially reduced, mitigating many issues that arise in purely air-based cooling systems, such as mixing of hot and cold air streams, or from placing high-heat-density equipment in close proximity. The technology is also such that it is able to retro-fit live equipment without service interruption, which is particularly important to the large installed ICT customer base, thereby providing a means of mitigating reliability and performance concerns during the installation, training and validation phases of product integration. Moreover, the refrigerant used in our approach, R 134 a, is a widely-used, non-toxic dielectric liquid which, unlike water, is non-conducting and non-corrosive and will not damage electronics {{in the case of a}} leakÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂa triple-play win over alternative water-based liquid coolant technologies. Finally, through use of a pumped refrigerant, pressures are modest (~ 60 psi), and toxic lubricants and oils are not required, in contrast to compressorized refrigerant systemsÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂanother environmental win. Project Activities - The ARCTIC project goal was to further develop and dramatically accelerate the commercialization of this game-changing, refrigerant-based, liquid-cooling technology and achieve a revolutionary increase in energy efficiency and carbon footprint reduction for our nationÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs Information and Communications Technology (ICT) infrastructure. The specific objectives of the ARCTIC project focused in the following three areas: i) advanced research innovations that dramatically enhance the ability to deal with ever-increasing device heat densities and footprint reduction by bringing the liquid cooling much closer to the actual heat sources; ii) manufacturing optimization of key components; and iii) ensuring rapid market acceptance by reducing cost, thoroughly understanding system-level performance, and developing viable commercialization strategies. The project involved participants with expertise in all aspects of commercialization, including research & development, manufacturing, sales & marketing and end users. The team was lead by Alcatel-Lucent, and included subcontractors Modine and USHose...|$|E
