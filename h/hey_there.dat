500|$|Opening track [...] "The Classical" [...] {{acts as a}} {{statement}} of intent {{similar to that in}} [...] "Crap Rap 2/Like to Blow" [...] from the Fall's debut album Live at the Witch Trials. Whereas on the earlier song Smith described himself as [...] "Northern white crap that talks back", in the opening lines of Hex Enduction Hour he complains that the fact that contemporary music lacks culture is his [...] "brag", observing that a [...] "taste for bullshit reveals a lust for a home of office" [...] and references [...] "obligatory niggers", before accusingly shouting [...] "Hey there, fuckface, <b>hey</b> <b>there,</b> fuckface". Pavement released a less offensive, sanitised cover of the track in the early 1990s, and Smith dismissed them later as mere Fall copyists. [...] "Jawbone and the Air Rifle" [...] depicts a nightmarish folklore tale of a poacher (described as a [...] "rabbit killer") bored by a decades-old marriage who escapes by roaming the local countryside at night hunting prey. One night the protagonist [...] "lets out a misplaced shot", which draws the Hex of the [...] "Broken Brothers Pentacle Church". The song's main focal point is toward the end when the lyrics detail a series of semi-religious, semi-pagan horrific and repeating hallucinations.|$|E

500|$|The second single {{from the}} album, [...] "Papa Don't Preach" [...] faced {{criticism}} {{as well as}} support from groups concerned with pregnancy and abortion for its theme of a girl getting pregnant and then deciding to continue the pregnancy rather than ending it.
