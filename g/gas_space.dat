5|$|Barotrauma, {{an example}} of dysbarism, is {{physical}} damage to body tissues caused by a difference in pressure between a <b>gas</b> <b>space</b> inside, or {{in contact with the}} body, and the surrounding gas or fluid. It typically occurs when the organism is exposed to a large change in ambient pressure, such as when a diver ascends or descends. When diving, the pressure differences which cause the barotrauma are changes in hydrostatic pressure.|$|E
25|$|Typically, spacers {{are filled}} with or contain {{desiccant}} to remove moisture trapped in the <b>gas</b> <b>space</b> during manufacturing, thereby lowering the dew point of the gas in that space, and preventing condensation from forming on surface #2 when the outside glass pane temperature falls.|$|E
25|$|Barotraumas {{of descent}} {{are caused by}} {{preventing}} the free change of volume of the gas in a closed space {{in contact with the}} diver, resulting in a pressure difference between the tissues and the <b>gas</b> <b>space,</b> and the unbalanced force due to this pressure difference causes deformation of the tissues resulting in cell rupture.|$|E
40|$|An Insulated Glazing unit (IGU) is {{constructed}} {{with two or}} more layers of glass panes sealed together by <b>gas</b> <b>spaces</b> in-between. IGUs are prevalent in windows, doors and rooflights, primarily due to their improved thermal resistance. Today, most IGUs are either two or three layered. Adding further layers of glass improves thermal insulation but with the penalty of increased cost and weight. Low emissivity (Low-e) film coatings, when deposited on the glass panes, reduce long-wavelength radiative heat losses. Furthermore, filling the <b>gas</b> <b>spaces</b> with the inert gases (e. g. Argon, Krypton, Xenon and SF 6), further reduce conduction and natural convection across the gap. In summary, higher thermal insulation performance of an IGU can be achieved with gas fillings and Low-e coatings on glass. This report discusses spreadsheets that have been developed, capable of estimating the thermal transmittance values of IGU, as per BS EN 673. The spreadsheet tools also {{have the ability to}} estimate the thermal conductivity of the <b>gas</b> <b>spaces</b> between the panes of IGU...|$|R
40|$|For active nodule {{nitrogen}} fixation, O 2, N 2, and carbohydrate must {{be transported}} throughout the nodule. No quantitative {{analysis of these}} transport processes in the nodules has been presented. By invoking several simplifying assumptions, a second-order differential equation for the various gradients and concentrations in the nodule was solved. Even though the nodule can only be approximated in this analysis, it indicates clearly that intercellular <b>gas</b> <b>spaces</b> must exist in nodules for adequate O 2 distribution. To preserve low O 2 concentrations and protect the nitrogenase, these <b>gas</b> <b>spaces</b> cannot be {{in direct contact with}} the ambient atmosphere. It is hypothesized that a gas barrier exists in the cortical region of the nodule to limit O 2 diffusion. This barrier would not substantially inhibit N 2 transport. Carbohydrate transport from the vascular tissue via diffusion in the liquid phase can adequately accommodate the requirements within the nodule...|$|R

25|$|Diving {{mask squeeze}} {{enclosing}} {{the eyes and}} nose: The main risk is rupture of the capillaries of the eyes and facial skin because of the negative pressure difference between the <b>gas</b> <b>space</b> and blood pressure, or orbital emphysema from higher pressures. This can be avoided by breathing air into the mask through the nose. Goggles covering only the eyes are not suitable for deep diving as they cannot be equalised.|$|E
25|$|The {{pressure}} {{changes during}} ascent and descent may affect gas {{spaces in the}} diver and diving equipment. A change in pressure will cause a pressure difference between the <b>gas</b> <b>space</b> and environment which will cause the gas to expand or compress if that is possible, and constraining the gas from expanding or compressing to balance the pressure may cause damage to the surrounding material or tissues by over-expansion or crushing. Some gas spaces, such as the mask, will automatically release excess gas as it expands during ascent, but have to be equalized during compression of descent.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{components}} to the ambient pressure {{acting on the}} diver: the atmospheric pressure and the water (hydrostatic) pressure. A descent of 10 metres (33feet) in water increases the ambient pressure by an amount approximately equal to {{the pressure of the}} atmosphere at sea level. So, a descent from the surface to 10 metres (33feet) underwater results in a doubling of the pressure on the diver. This pressure change will reduce the volume of a gas filled space by half. Boyle's law describes the relationship between the volume of the <b>gas</b> <b>space</b> and the pressure in the gas.|$|E

25|$|Equalisation of {{pressure}} in <b>gas</b> <b>spaces</b> to avoid barotraumas. The expansion or compression of enclosed air spaces may cause discomfort or injury while diving. Critically, the lungs {{are susceptible to}} over-expansion and subsequent collapse if a diver holds their breath while ascending: during training divers are taught to never hold their breath while diving. Ear clearing is another critical equalisation procedure, usually requiring conscious intervention by the diver.|$|R
40|$|Models for {{unsteady}} {{water transport}} in fuel cell configurations of Bacon-Pratt and Whitney type are derived.

An analytical solution which includes diffusion in both the liquid and the <b>gas</b> <b>spaces</b> of the matrix is in better agreement with the data than models which consider diffusion in either the liquid or in the gas phase alone...|$|R
25|$|Barotrauma is {{physical}} damage to body tissues {{caused by a}} difference in pressure between a <b>gas</b> <b>space</b> inside, or {{in contact with the}} body, and the surrounding gas or fluid. The initial damage is usually due to over-stretching the tissues in tension or shear, either directly by expansion of the gas in the closed space, or by pressure difference hydrostatically transmitted through the tissue. Tissue rupture may be complicated by the introduction of gas into the local tissue or circulation through the initial trauma site, which can cause blockage of circulation at distant sites, or interfere with normal function of an organ by its presence.|$|E
25|$|The main {{components}} of the average scuba diver's equipment which are positively buoyant are the {{components of the}} exposure suit. The two most commonly used exposure suit types are the dry suit and the wet suit. Both of these types of exposure suit use gas spaces to provide insulation, and these gas spaces are inherently buoyant. The buoyancy of a wet suit will decrease significantly with an increase in depth as the ambient pressure causes the volume of the gas bubbles in the neoprene to decrease. A dry suit will also compress with depth, but the air space inside is continuous and can be topped up from a cylinder or vented to maintain a moderately constant volume. A large part of the ballast used by a diver is to balance the buoyancy of this <b>gas</b> <b>space.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{pressure}} {{changes during}} ascent and descent may affect gas {{spaces in the}} diver and diving equipment. A change in pressure will cause a pressure difference between the <b>gas</b> <b>space</b> and environment which will cause the gas to expand or compress if that is possible, and constraining the gas from expanding or compressing to balance the pressure may cause damage to the surrounding material or tissues by over-expansion or crushing. Some gas spaces, such as the mask, will automatically release excess gas as it expands, but have to be equalized during compression, others, such as the buoyancy compensator bladder, will expand until the over-pressure valve opens. The ears are a special case, as they will usually vent naturally through the Eustachian tubes, but these may be blocked. During descent they do not usually equalize automatically, and must be intentionally equalized by the diver, using one of several possible methods. Most of the physiological airway automatically equalizes {{as long as the}} diver is breathing normally, but holding the breath can prevent equalization of the lower airways and lungs, which can lead to barotrauma.|$|E

500|$|Barotrauma {{generally}} manifests as sinus {{or middle}} ear effects, DCS, lung overpressure injuries, and injuries resulting from external squeezes. Barotraumas of descent {{are caused by}} preventing the free change of volume of the gas in a closed space {{in contact with the}} diver, resulting in a pressure difference between the tissues and the <b>gas</b> <b>space,</b> and the unbalanced force due to this pressure difference causes deformation of the tissues resulting in cell rupture. Barotraumas of ascent are also caused when the free change of volume of the gas in a closed space in contact with the diver is prevented. In this case the pressure difference causes a resultant tension in the surrounding tissues which exceeds their tensile strength. Besides tissue rupture, the overpressure may cause ingress of gases into the tissues and further afield through the circulatory system. [...] This can cause blockage of circulation at distant sites, or interfere with the normal function of an organ by its presence.|$|E
500|$|It {{has been}} {{estimated}} that more than 40,000 people per year seek medical attention for carbon monoxide poisoning in the United States. 95% of carbon monoxide poisoning deaths in the United States are due to <b>gas</b> <b>space</b> heaters. In many industrialized countries carbon monoxide is the cause of more than 50% of fatal poisonings. In the United States, approximately 200 people die each year from carbon monoxide poisoning associated with home fuel-burning heating equipment. Carbon monoxide poisoning contributes to the approximately 5613 smoke inhalation deaths each year in the United States. The CDC reports, [...] "Each year, more than 500 Americans die from unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning, and more than 2,000 commit suicide by intentionally poisoning themselves." [...] For the 10-year period from 1979 to 1988, 56,133 deaths from carbon monoxide poisoning occurred in the United States, with 25,889 of those being suicides, leaving 30,244 unintentional deaths. A report from New Zealand showed that 206 people died from carbon monoxide poisoning in the years of 2001 and 2002. In total carbon monoxide poisoning was responsible for 43.9% of deaths by poisoning in that country. In South Korea, 1,950 people had been poisoned by carbon monoxide with 254 deaths from 2001 through 2003. A report from Jerusalem showed 3.53 per 100,000 people were poisoned annually from 2001 through 2006. In Hubei, China, 218 deaths from poisoning were reported over a 10-year period with 16.5% being from carbon monoxide exposure.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{numerical}} {{study of}} the <b>gas</b> flow velocity <b>space</b> is presented in a convection type reflow oven. Convection reflow ovens usually apply the nozzle-matrix heater system which generates numerous gas streams perpendicularly to surface of the soldered assembly.

The temperature can be independently controlled in each zone; however the velocity of the influent streams is usually fixed. The <b>gas</b> flow velocity <b>space</b> {{is one of the}} most important parameter of the local heat transfer coefficient in the oven.

These results can be useful during the overview of the actual assembly design and manufacturing rules...|$|R
40|$|A multiconfigurational self-consistent field method {{based on}} the concept of {{generalized}} active <b>space</b> (<b>GAS)</b> is presented. GAS wave functions are obtained by defining an arbitrary number of active spaces with arbitrary occupation constraints. By a suitable choice of the <b>GAS</b> <b>spaces,</b> numerous ineffective configurations present in a large complete active space (CAS) can be removed, while keeping the important ones in the CI space. As a consequence, the GAS self-consistent field approach retains the accuracy of the CAS self-consistent field (CASSCF) ansatz and, at the same time, can deal with larger active spaces, which would be unaffordable at the CASSCF level. Test calculations on the Gd atom, Gd 2 molecule, and oxoMn(salen) complex are presented. They show that GAS wave functions achieve the same accuracy as CAS wave functions on systems that would be prohibitive at the CAS level...|$|R

The conventional histological techniques by Light Microscopy (LM) were used to get anatomical datas. This root has no cork covering. Cells of the meristem normally had dense cytoplasm and clear nucleus. Protoderm first appeared as a distinct layer {{at the edge of the}} tiers of cortical meristem. Root caps of feeding root of S. alba consist of two regions, i. e., weakly stained central columella or statenchyma and well-stained peripheral regions. The columella has 8 - 11 layers.
