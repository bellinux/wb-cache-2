Lenny Henry in Windrush - The Irresistible Rise of Multiracial Britain Following his retirement from the game in 1959, Williams tried his hand as a singer in local working men's clubs, but it was his comic chat between the songs that was best received, so he decided to move into comedy full-time. He eventually became Britain's first well-known black television comedian. [...] He came to prominence from 1971, when he began appearing regularly on The Comedians. The show broadcast stand-up routines from relatively unknown but often very experienced club comedians, including Frank Carson, Mike Reid and Bernard Manning. The novel combination of a black man with a Yorkshire accent and his first-hand experience of life in the British working class made him unmistakable.|$|E

40|$|This article {{considers}} how {{we should}} frame the ethical issues raised by current proposals for large-scale genebanks with on-going links to medical and lifestyle data, such as the Wellcome Trust and Medical Research Council's 'UK Biobank'. As recent scandals such as Alder <b>Hey</b> <b>have</b> emphasised, there are complex issues concerning the informed consent of donors {{that need to be}} carefully considered. However, we believe that a preoccupation with informed consent obscures important questions about the purposes to which such collections are put, not least that they may be only haphazardly used for research (especially that of commercial interest) - an end that would not fairly reflect the original altruistic motivation of donors, and the trust they must invest. We therefore argue that custodians of such databases take on a weighty pro-active duty, to encourage public debate about the ends of such collections and to sponsor research that reflects publicly agreed priorities and provides public benefits...|$|E
40|$|Patent law is {{constantly}} evolving to accommodate advances {{in science and}} technology. But, {{for a variety of}} reasons, some aspects of patent doctrine have not evolved over time leading to a growing disconnect between the patent system and certain technical communities. Particularly vulnerable to the ill effects of this disconnect are "atypical" inventions, which this Article definesas those in which either (1) a technical aspect of the invention or the inventive process does not conform to an established legal standard in patent law or (2) the technical underpinnings of the invention depart from well-established scientific paradigms. An example of the former is an invention which occurs by accident; an example of the latter is an invention which seems incredible in light of contemporary knowledge in the relevant field. Since these inventions often spark a paradigm shift in scientific and technological understanding, <b>hey</b> <b>have</b> a high likelihood of stimulating significant creative activity and ultimately promoting the patent system's overarching goal to promote scientific and technological progress. Thus, this Article argues that the patent system should evolve to better accommodate these inventions...|$|E

40|$|AbstractFabrication of {{homogenous}} CaCO 3 particles is {{a significant}} step in assembling polyelectrolyte capsules. It is crucial to control the dimensions, the shape and the charge of the calcium carbonate particles {{in order to have}} homogenously separated and charged templates as final result. For this reason, previously. <b>hey</b> <b>have</b> been deeply investigated. Recently, crystallization of CaCO 3 was done by adding poly (sodium 4 -styrenesulfonate) (PSS) as negatively charged polymer and poly (allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) as positively charged polymer and the results were surprising. The homogenous particles were separated and they carried the same charge of the used polymer. The aim of this work was to investigate the synthesis process of CaCO 3 particles in different experimental conditions: calcium carbonate was produced in presence and in absence of water and with addition of appropriate polymers. In particular, chitosan (CHI) and poly acrylic acid (PAA) were chosen as biodegradable polymers whereas PSS and PAH were chosen as non-biodegradable polymers. Shape and diameter of particles were investigated by using transmission and scanning electron microscopy, elemental composition was inferred by energy dispersive X-ray analyses whereas their charges were explored by using zeta potential...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{relationship}} among population, poverty, and the environmental factors, and the impact <b>hey</b> <b>have</b> had on China's land, water, forests and pastures. It does so by examining the extent of environmental degradation and China's success in controlling its environmental problems is reviewed; by investigating how the leadership has tried to develop a legal framework and series of institutions to carry out environ-mental policy; and by providing empirical evidence demonstrating the determinants of the successes that China has achieved in surmounting (or slowing) some of its environmental problems. Five of China's rural resource concerns are surveyed in this paper: water pollution, deforestation, destruction of the grasslands, oil erosion, and salinization. The paper finds that government policy has not been effective in con-trolling rural resource degradation primarily because it has limited fiscal resources and poorly trained personnel, and under these constraints the government has delegated responsibility for environmental and resource protection to the ministries of agricul-ture and forestry, two institutions that {{have an incentive to}} favor pro-production poli-cies. Instead, China's efforts to alleviate policy, integrate markets, and control popu-lation appear to have helped mitigate a number of adverse environmental consequences of China's development effort of the last 40 years...|$|E
40|$|As {{a result}} of Analysis of green sand {{properties}} on 100 lines of system sand in 1985 and 1998 respectively, it showed a tendency that green sand, analyzed in 1998, had lower compactability and higher strength compared with those in 1985. Also lower deviation was recognized. So {{it can be said}} that green sands in 1998 have changed to higher quality one with better flowability, while they are almost same properties among them.
