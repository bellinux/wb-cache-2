5|$|The post-colonial {{discourse}} {{presented in}} Orientalism, also influenced post-colonial theology and post-colonial biblical criticism, by which method the analytical reader approaches a scripture {{from the perspective}} of a colonial reader. See: The Bible and Zionism: Invented Traditions, Archaeology and Post-colonialism in Palestine–Israel (2007). Another book in this area is Postcolonial Theory (1998), by Leela Gandhi, explains Post-colonialism to <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> applied to the wider philosophical and intellectual context of history.|$|E
5|$|Our perceptual {{experiences}} {{depend on}} stimuli that arrive at our various sensory organs from the external world, and these stimuli cause {{changes in our}} mental states, ultimately causing us to feel a sensation, which may be pleasant or unpleasant. Someone's desire for a slice of pizza, for example, will tend to cause that person to move his or her body in a specific manner and in a specific direction to obtain {{what he or she}} wants. The question, then, is <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> possible for conscious experiences to arise out of a lump of gray matter endowed with nothing but electrochemical properties.|$|E

25|$|Magic or sorcery {{is the use}} of rituals, symbols, actions, gestures, and {{language}} with the aim of utilizing supernatural forces. The term magic has a variety of meanings, and there is no widely agreed upon definition of what it is or <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> used.|$|E
25|$|Context-free grammars {{are simple}} {{enough to allow}} the {{construction}} of efficient parsing algorithms that, for a given string, determine whether and <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> generated from the grammar. An Earley parser {{is an example of}} such an algorithm, while the widely used LR and LL parsers are simpler algorithms that deal only with more restrictive subsets of context-free grammars.|$|E

25|$|In an originalist interpretation, if {{the meaning}} of the Constitution is static, then any ex post facto {{information}} (such as the opinions of the American people, American judges, or the judiciaries of any foreign country) is inherently valueless for interpretation of {{the meaning of}} the Constitution, and should not form any part of constitutional jurisprudence. The Constitution is thus fixed and has procedures defining <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> changed.|$|E
25|$|In {{preparation}} for a dinner which family and friends attend, the participants have to buy each other a complete outfit on their own, to be worn at the dinner.

At the dinner, the friends, family and participants further evaluate the relationship in question and discuss <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> improved, prompting the couple to confront and realize their issues.|$|E
25|$|Ultimately neuroscientists {{would like}} to {{understand}} {{every aspect of the}} nervous system, including how it works, how it develops, how it malfunctions, and <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> altered or repaired. The specific topics that form the main foci of research change over time, driven by an ever-expanding base of knowledge and the availability of increasingly sophisticated technical methods. Over the long term, improvements in technology have been the primary drivers of progress. Developments in electron microscopy, computers, electronics, functional brain imaging, and most recently genetics and genomics, have all been major drivers of progress.|$|E

25|$|Operationalize {{means to}} put into operation. Operational {{definitions}} are also used to define system states {{in terms of a}} specific, publicly accessible process of preparation or validation testing, which is repeatable at will. For example, 100 degrees Celsius may be crudely defined by describing the process of heating water at sea level until it is observed to boil. An item like a brick, or even a photograph of a brick, may be defined in terms of <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> made. Likewise, iron may be defined in terms of the results of testing or measuring it in particular ways.|$|E
25|$|Although Schenker himself usually {{presents}} his analyses in the generative direction, {{starting from}} the fundamental structure (Ursatz) to reach the score, the practice of Schenkerian analysis more often is reductive, {{starting from the}} score and showing <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> reduced to its fundamental structure. The graph of the Ursatz is arrhythmic, as is a strict-counterpoint cantus firmus exercise. Even at intermediate levels of the reduction, rhythmic notation (open and closed noteheads, beams and flags) shows not rhythm but the hierarchical relationships between the pitch-events. Schenkerian analysis is subjective. There is no mechanical procedure involved and the analysis reflects the musical intuitions of the analyst. The analysis represents a way of hearing (and reading) a piece of music.|$|E
25|$|At stake, beyond {{commercial}} {{speculation and}} financial profit, were {{the questions of}} when Cubism began, who {{led the way in}} its development, what distinguishes Cubist art, <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> defined and who can be called Cubist. By marginalizing the contribution of the artists who exhibited at the Salon des Indépendants and Salon d'Automne, Kahnweiler's attempted to focus attention on Picasso and Braque, those who played a leading if independent {{role in the development of}} this new mode of expression. To some extent Kahnweiler had succeeded in his endeavor, prompting historians such as Douglas Cooper to coin the term ‘true’ Cubism to describe the work of Picasso and Braque. The implied value judgement was intentional.|$|E

25|$|In {{his early}} work, Conn studied {{numerous}} aspects of plasma for fusion applications, including <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> confined with magnetic fields, thereby increasing its density {{and the likelihood}} that atomic nuclei collide and fuse. Conn also studied the boundary conditions between the plasma and the chamber walls inside a reactor, how to design the so-called “blanket region” surrounding the plasma chamber so as to capture the fusion energy released as neutrons, and many other science and engineering challenges associated with practical reactor development. Among the many reports for which Conn {{played a central role}} was the UWMAK-1 Study in 1973, which became a tutorial on reactor design used by private sector companies including Westinghouse and McDonald Douglas. His key partner in these studies was Professor Gerald Kulcinski, Grainger Professor of Engineering at UW.|$|E
