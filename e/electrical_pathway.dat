25|$|The Enigma was an {{electro-mechanical}} {{rotor machine}} {{used for the}} encryption and decryption of secret messages. It was developed in Germany in the 1920s. The repeated changes of the <b>electrical</b> <b>pathway</b> from the keyboard to the lampboard implemented a polyalphabetic substitution cipher, which turned plaintext into ciphertext and back again. The Enigma's scrambler contained rotors with 26 electrical contacts on each side, whose wiring diverted the current to a different position on the two sides. On depressing a key on the keyboard, an electric current flowed through an entry drum at the right-hand end of the scrambler, then through the set of rotors to a reflecting drum (or reflector) which turned it back through the rotors and entry drum, and out to cause one lamp on the lampboard to be illuminated.|$|E

The main model {{in use in}} 1940 had three rotors that set an <b>electrical</b> <b>pathway</b> from the keyboard to the lampboard. Pressing a key caused one lamp to light and the right-most rotor to advance by one letter position. This changed the <b>electrical</b> <b>pathway</b> so that pressing the same key again caused a different letter to light up. At one of the 26 positions, a notch on the right-most rotor engaged with the middle rotor so that the two rotors advanced together, and similarly the middle rotor would engage with the left-most rotor, giving a very long period before the sequence repeated (26 [...] 26 [...] 26 = 17,576). The ring on the rotor that contained the notch and so caused the next rotor to advance, could be set {{to any one of}} the 26 positions. The three rotors were selected from a set of five, giving 60 different ways of mounting rotors in the machine. However, because the Germans laid down the rule that no rotor should be in the same position on successive days, if the previous days's rotors and their positions were known, this number was reduced to 32.|$|E

40|$|The {{electrical}} {{activation of}} the heart is a complex physiological process that {{is essential for the}} understanding of several cardiac dysfunctions, such as ventricular tachycardia (VT). Nowadays, electro-anatomical mappings of patient-specific activation times on the left ventricle surface can be estimated, providing crucial information to the clinicians for guiding cardiac treatment. However, some <b>electrical</b> <b>pathways</b> of particular interest such as Purkinje or still viable conduction channels are difficult to interpret in these maps. We present here a novel method to find some of these <b>electrical</b> <b>pathways</b> using minimal cost paths computations on surface maps.

50|$|Cardiac physiologists usually set up what {{is known}} as a {{transducer}} to monitor pressure in the arteries.

50|$|In {{the realm}} of {{acquired}} arrhythmias, Antzelevitch's research team {{was the first to}} recognize that the antianginal drug ranolazine blocks the <b>electrical</b> <b>pathway</b> in the heart known as the late sodium channel, an atrial-selective action that has potential benefit in the treatment of AF.

50|$|Congenital heart defects are {{structural}} or <b>electrical</b> <b>pathway</b> {{problems in}} the heart that are present at birth. Anyone can be affected with this because overall health does not {{play a role in}} the problem. Problems with the <b>electrical</b> <b>pathway</b> of the heart can cause very fast or even deadly arrhythmias. Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome is due to an extra pathway in the heart that is made up of electrical muscle tissue. This tissue allows the electrical impulse, which stimulates the heartbeat, to happen very rapidly. Right Ventricular outflow tract Tachycardia is the most common type of ventricular tachycardia in otherwise healthy individuals. This defect is due to an electrical node in the right ventricle just before the pulmonary artery. When the node is stimulated, the patient will go into ventricular tachycardia, which does not allow the heart to fill with blood before beating again. Long QT Syndrome is another complex problem in the heart and has been labeled as an independent factor in mortality. There are multiple methods of treatment for these including cardiac ablations, medication treatment, or altering your lifestyle to have less stress and exercise. It is possible to live a full and happy life with these conditions.|$|E

The energy emitting probe (electrode) is placed into the heart through a catheter inserted into veins in the groin or neck.

40|$|Cardiac {{ablation}} is {{a procedure}} that uses either radiofrequency or cryothermal energy to destroy cells in the heart to terminate and/or prevent arrhythmias. The indications for cardiac catheter ablation include refractory, symptomatic arrhythmias, with more specific guidelines for atrial fibrillation in particular.

There are many types of arrhythmias, and they require individualized approaches to ablation based on their innately different <b>electrical</b> <b>pathways.</b> Ablation of arrhythmias, such as Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, AV nodal reentrant tachycardia, and atrial-fibrillation, is discussed in this review.

50|$|Most {{military}} Enigmas {{also featured}} a plugboard (German: Steckerbrett). This altered the <b>electrical</b> <b>pathway</b> between the keyboard and the entry {{wheel of the}} scrambler and, in the opposite direction, between the scrambler and the lampboard.

The same connections applied for the current {{on the way out}} to the lamp panel.|$|E
50|$|The Enigma {{machines}} {{produced a}} polyalphabetic substitution cipher. During World War I, inventors {{in several countries}} realized that a purely random key sequence, containing no repetitive pattern, would, in principle, make a polyalphabetic substitution cipher unbreakable.

When the normal balance between inhibition and excitation is significantly disrupted in {{all or part of the}} brain, a seizure can occur.

50|$|An {{automatic}} tachycardia is {{a cardiac}} arrhythmia which involves {{an area of}} the heart generating an abnormally fast rhythm, sometimes also called enhanced automaticity.

Most automatic tachycardias are supraventricular tachycardias (SVT). It is important to recognise an automatic tachycardia because the treatment will be different to that for a reentrant tachycardia. The most useful clue will be the presence of 'warm up' and 'cool down'. This means that whereas a reentrant tachycardia will both begin and end abruptly as cardiac conduction utilises then ceases to utilise the accessory pathway, an automatic tachycardia will rise and fall gradually in rate as the automatic focus increases and decreases its automatic rate of electrical discharge.|$|E
