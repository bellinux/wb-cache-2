500|$|Writing for The Washington Post, Allison Stewart {{opined that}} the track {{describes}} an eccentric night of romance, beginning with [...] "a body full of liquor with a cocaine kicker" [...] {{and ending with}} [...] "you and me/Making love like gorillas". She concluded, [...] "for all its awfulness" [...] the song is the [...] "image shifter Mars needs". Idolator's Emily Tan commented [...] "the libidinous lyrics are disguised with epic guitars and Phil Collins-esque heavy drum combinations...strong enough to soundtrack a scene in a drama series". Jason Lipshutz of Billboard magazine similarly felt that the [...] "drums and keyboards are nicely overwhelming, but the overall concept floats {{too far away to}} make a dent on the listener". Day Hyman of Spin thought that the lyrics on the album [...] "desperately needed kick in the pants" [...] mainly noticed on [...] "Gorilla". He also drew comparisons on the [...] "Prince-channeling" [...] vibe. On the critical side, Amy Dawson of Metro described it as a [...] "Phil Collins-esque low point" [...] in the album, [...] "in which the button-eyed singer makes plans to <b>go</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> {{in the same way as}} said giant ape, all over a Phil Collins-esque synth/percussion combo backing… but by the time the jungle noises kick in, you think he surely must be in on the joke." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2010, Lang and Tylo recreated a 1983 lily pond cat-fight between Krystle Carrington and Alexis Colby in {{the drama}} Dynasty, {{shooting}} the scenes in a koi pond at the CBS Studios.

After Stephanie's death, Taylor and Brooke's animosity against one another reignites as Taylor grows closer to Eric in 2013. Tylo said that [...] "When Brooke and Taylor <b>go</b> <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> it really {{gets a lot of}} people wound up. [...] I said this brings the show around full circle with everything Stephanie was fighting for, and now the battle has been set for these two to really go at it." ...|$|E
60|$|A quick sort of {{council was}} held, and Captain Maryon soon {{resolved}} {{that we must}} all fall to work to get the cargo out, and that when that was done, the guns and heavy matters must be got out, and that the sloop must be hauled ashore, and careened, and the leak stopped. We were all mustered (the Pirate-Chace party volunteering), and told off into parties, with so many hours of spell and so many hours of relief, and we all <b>went</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> with a will. Christian George King was entered one of the party in which I worked, at his own request, and he <b>went</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> with as good a will {{as any of the}} rest.

2500|$|On November 28, 1998, Toyota {{faced the}} legendary Chigusa Nagayo in a one-time-only legends bout that saw arguably {{the two best}} female wrestlers ever <b>go</b> <b>at</b> <b>it.</b> Nagayo came out victorious in a 15-minute match. Toyota was brought in by Aja Kong to Chigusa Nagayo's Gaea Japan wrestling group. She feuded with her old partner Toshiyo Yamada, as well as Dynamite Kansai.

2500|$|... "I think {{having a}} pilot's licence helped a little bit. One of my road crew said {{we found this}} guy that {{used to work in}} the circus and he does a lot of things for TV and special effects and he's made {{something}} that might interest you, it's a piano that spins round, and I immediately responded, oh that sounds interesting. I happened to be within the New York area and I was driven over to Long Island to a guy called Bob McCarthy, and there in the background he had this piano situated. So he called his wife down from upstairs and said, darling could you demonstrate this for Keith? I looked on, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. His wife comes down and sits on the seat and up she goes in the air and proceeds to spin around. I thought, well that's great! Then Bob asked me, {{do you want to have}} a <b>go</b> <b>at</b> <b>it?...</b> Yea, okay. You need to understand, below the keyboard there's an inverted-tee, like a bar. You wrap your legs around the down pipe and put your heels under the inverted-tee. Then you go up in the air and try and do your best to play. It was a little difficult to play at first because of the centrifugal force, so it wasn't easy. I think we actually used it for the first time at Madison Square Garden, it was a Christmas concert. People in the audience were so astounded they couldn't quite believe what they were seeing. Later on that coming year the California Jam came up and I said we have to do that there. Bob drove the whole contraption down to the California Jam and there was very little space to set it up. There were loads of bands up on that stage, all having to do their set and then getting their equipment off. Now, with the moog, the Hammonds, Carl's gongs and everything, it was hard enough to just get that off stage. We had the spinning piano and everything that went along with it and we tried to find a place to situate it. It ended up going just at the end of the stage, so when the piano went up it was literally over the heads of the audience. After that every TV show I did came the question... Keith, how do you spin around on that piano? I'd say what about my music? When I had the honor of meeting the great jazz pianist Dave Brubeck just before he died, he said, Keith you've got to tell me how do you spin around on that piano? Dave Brubeck was 90 years old then and I said, 'Dave, don't try it!'" ...|$|E
2500|$|India {{entered the}} final day with ten wickets in hand and a further 193 runs to get. Should they win the match, it would be their first in Australian soil in 23 years, {{moreover}} such a result {{would mean that the}} Australians would have lost their first home test match in five years. As the openers walked out on a bright and sunny morning. The morning sessions was intense and tension-filled, as the Australian bowlers, led by Gillespie, did not let the opening pair to settle down as they did the previous morning. The opening pair only added 11 runs to the score in five overs, before Gillespie nailed Chopra when the score was 48. Dravid, the next man in, was welcomed with a tremendous round of applause from the Australian crowd. However, the welcome he received from the Australian bowlers was less than warm. When he was batting on 9, Dravid edged a delivery in the offstump line from the injured Brad Williams to Gilchrist, who could not take a low and difficult chance. However, Dravid was once again given a thorough working over from Williams. The reprieve would ultimately prove to be costly. Had the wicket fallen, it would have been 73/2, but the second wicket did not get delayed much after that drop. Virender Sehwag had smashed a four off Stuart MacGill, but almost immediately, a couple of balls later, he got out MacGill, who dropped in a well-flighted delivery, luring Sehwag to step put of the crease and have a <b>go</b> <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> which resulted in his stumping. Then the score was 79/2. Sachin Tendulkar, coming at the fall of the second wicket was under immense pressure as he had only scored a meagre 171 runs at an average of 19 in five tests that he played since December 2002. His sequence of scores in those tests were:8, 51, 9, 32, 8, 7, 55, 1, 0 and 1. However, in this innings, Tendulkar started well, starting with a paddle-sweep for four of MacGill, and then he played some handsome cover-drives and unleashed his pulls whenever the bowlers seemed to have erred in line and length. He played patiently as well, not allowing the momentum to drop, but also not allowing aggression to get the better of him. His running was also prolific, as he ran three runs and on one occasion, he even ran four runs. Dravid, on the other end, played slowly and assuredly, with his runs coming mainly from solid batting rather than aggressive or flamboyant strokeplay. The duo added 50 runs within a span of 14.2 overs, when Dravid scored two runs off a delivery from Steve Waugh. Brad Williams came back for a second spell and tested the two batsmen severely with his reverse swing and limited pace. The partnership blossomed to 70, and just when it seemed that the two would bat Australia out of the game, Stuart MacGill struck with Tendulkar's wicket in the 47th over. MacGill, who had been until then, bowling from round the wicket, changed the angle and Tendulkar, failing to read a straighter one which pitched on middle-and-leg, offered no stroke and was given out lbw for a 59-ball 37, and the score was 149/3. Sourav Ganguly joined Dravid in the middle. The two added 21 runs from 9 overs before Ganguly was dismissed by Andy Bichel for 12, scooping a drive straight to Simon Katich. At 170/4, India required 60 runs more and Australia were smelling blood, and were back into the contest. Laxman walked out once again, to join Dravid, and he swung back the momentum of the match promptly. After scoring his first run off his first ball, Laxman was back on strike in the 57th over. He dead-batted the first two balls, but he caressed the third ball through covers, a full toss (by MacGill) to the boundary. When MacGill repeated that the next ball, Laxman sent it back to the midwicket boundary. Then he cut the last ball to the point boundary, taking 12 runs from the over. The next over, Dravid reached a well-deserved fifty from 129 balls, with a four off Andy Bichel. Thus, he completed the distinction of being the only man to reach two fifty-plus scores in the match. Dravid too, grew in confidence, and began to repeat his partner's exploits. Soon after the two had added 51 from 11 overs, Laxman was dismissed playing a rash stroke, mistiming a hoick off Katich to Bichel, but the match was already lost by then and at 221/4, India needed only 9 runs to clinch the match. Parthiv Patel delayed the moment, getting bowled around the legs by Katich, but it brought together India's two heroes with the bat an ball, Rahul Dravid and Ajit Agarkar to the crease. In the fourth ball of the 72nd over and with the score on 229/6, Dravid played a square cut, which went away to the boundary, and as he ran, he let out a roar and pumped his fist. Then he took off his cap and kissed the India crest on it. Steve Waugh, in a brave act of sportsmanship, gave Dravid the ball which he had cut for four, saying [...] "Well Played." ...|$|E
