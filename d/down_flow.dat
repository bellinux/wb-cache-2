Originating as a spring near the village of Uppalapadu in Orvakal Mandal of Kurnool District, it goes through many changes before merging with the Penna at Adinimmaya Palli village of Kadapa District. It is known for frequent floods that bring heavy damage to the Nandyal and Koilkuntla areas, and hence it is popularly called the [...] "Sorrow of Nandyal." [...] But nowadays Nandyal town became a big town with huge population so that the drainage water is discharged to the Kundu river with out prior treatment. Industrialists focused their vision at more and more profits and they polluted the river to the maximum extent. The villagers who are living at <b>down</b> <b>flow</b> of the river from Nandyala are suffering with different skin diseases. The pollution impacts even animals health too. In ancient times this river was known as the Kumudvathi. There is a saying in Rayalaseema that whoever drinks the water of the Kundu will gain enormous courage to face enemies.

5000|$|After March 1916, {{along the}} 72 km of the [...] "Voie Sacrée", {{transport}} vehicles {{were on the}} move day and night ferrying troops, armaments, and supplies to the Verdun battlefield. During the initial crisis of 21 February to 22 March, 600 trucks per day had already delivered 48,000 tons of ammunition, 6,400 tons of other material and 263,000 men to the battlefield. Beginning on February 21, all horse drawn traffic and troop movements on foot had been ordered off the road leaving it open for truck and motor car traffic only. After March 1916, one truck passed every 14 seconds, submitting the road to considerable wear and tear. Quarries had to be opened nearby to supply the road with crushed stone. Over the course of ten months, 16 labour battalions worked to keep the road in good shape and order. The road had been recognized since 1915 as the only reliable vehicular road that remained in existence to supply Verdun safely. All the standard gauge railway lines that could reach Verdun had already been interrupted by German forces in late 1914. To compensate for this precarious situation the road had been widened to 23 feet during 1915, so it could accommodate the continuous up and <b>down</b> <b>flow</b> of two lines of truck traffic. This preemptive roadway improvement in 1915, plus success in organizing the transport system on the road (a mission supervised by colonel Maurice de Barescut, the Chief of Staff of the French Second Army), is what saved Verdun in 1916.|$|E
50|$|The {{space of}} the Gevgelian ravine that {{comprise}} the {{space of the}} Bogdanci field is located in the south and the south east part of Republic of Macedonia. A part of the ravine is in Greece. The region is in the <b>down</b> <b>flow</b> of the river Vardar. At the first side this space location gives you an impression of reticence because of its kampong with the local hills. There is Kozhuf, the mountain on west, some hills on north, the mountains Belasica and Kara Balija on east and on south it’s open to Greece. This location has a vantage point as for the disposition of the space and the traffic connection. The vintage point of Bogdanci in the Gevgelian valley is good. It’s on some 80-90 meters attitude above the sea level. There is the expressway E-75 on some 9 km on the west side, it’s 10 km far away from the center of Gevgelija, 7 km from the Macedonian - Greek border and 5 km from the river Vardar. The Dojran Lake and Dojran are on some 20 km on east of Bogdanci. There are some roads passing through the Geveglian - Bogdanci’s field, connecting Bogdanci with Gevgelija, Stojakovo, Gjavoto and the expressway E-75. The road that connects Bogdanci with Dojran, Strumica and Valandovo passes through the valley of the river Paljurska. This road connects Gevgelija and Dojran. In the past the road that connect Gevgelija with Macedonia, Greece, was very frequent. Bogdanci’s good geographical position in the ravine, the traffic importance and the economic function in the region are the reasons that Bogdanci was and still is a dynamic hearth for the gravitation of the settlements from the Dojran’s and Gevgelian ravines. In the past the traffic was not developed enough and that’s why the relief was the main factor for the intensity of the gravitation occupy in some ways. Most villages of the region that were well connected with Bogdanci gravitated in every sphere with it. Stojakovo, Gjavoto, Bogorodica, Furka, Crnichani were the villages that gravitated well with Bogdanci, and from the other side Bogdanci gravitated well with Thessaloniki the center of Macedonia in that time. Today with the development of the ravine’s center Gevgelija the gravitation occupy of Bogdanci is shrank.|$|E

The effect of downer diameter on Mass transfer coefficients was studied by plotting Mass transfer coefficients {{in terms of}} dimensionless parameters. Downers are <b>down</b> <b>flow</b> fluidized beds. They offer several advantages compared to risers. 1. Reduced gas and solid back mixing. 2. Reduced contact time between different phases 3.

These advantages become significant in several fields where <b>down</b> <b>flow</b> fluidized beds (downers) are used e. g. petroleum industry (FCC), glass industry, fertilizer industry, etc. Some studies have already been done on other parameters of downers like Heat transfer, Particle velocity profiles, etc. The present work reports experimental observation on fluid to particle mass transfer in downers...|$|E

The result shows that the status of bioconvection classifies three different regions by the strength of electrical field. The lower area is "natural convection region" in which bioconvection is not changed by electrical field. Middle area is "convection control region" in which <b>down</b> <b>flow</b> stream near the negative electrode is brought to just under the negative electrode.

30|$|ADW used in {{the present}} study was the same as that used in our {{previous}} laboratory experiments for assessing CE-MFCs for WWT (Miyahara et al. 2013; Yoshizawa et al. 2014); in these studies, however, despite that HRT and CODin were also the same as those in the present study, CRE values were reported to be around 80 %. On the other hand, as presented in Fig.  1 and Table  1, CRE values observed in the present work were higher than 90 % (93 % in average). We consider that the up and <b>down</b> <b>flow</b> of water in MFC was effective for improving the quality of effluent water; this flow system was newly employed in the present study. We had employed right and left flows of water in CE-MFC (named the slalom flow) in previous studies (Miyahara et al. 2013; Yoshizawa et al. 2014), while we found that this system was associated with a problem of undercurrent that was not effectively contacted with electrode surfaces. The present study therefore proposes that the up and <b>down</b> <b>flow</b> of wastewater is effective for gaining high WWT efficiencies in CE-MFCs. In order to further improve water flow in CE-MFCs, computational fluid dynamics analyses may be necessary.|$|E
