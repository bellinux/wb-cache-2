5|$|The unusual surface {{appearance}} of the cerebellum conceals {{the fact that most}} of its volume is made up of a very tightly folded layer of gray matter: the cerebellar cortex. Each ridge or gyrus in this layer is called a <b>folium.</b> It is estimated that, if the human cerebellar cortex were completely unfolded, it would give rise to a layer of neural tissue about 1meter long and averaging 5centimeters wide—a total surface area of about 500square cm, packed within a volume of dimensions 6cm × 5cm × 10cm. Underneath the gray matter of the cortex lies white matter, made up largely of myelinated nerve fibers running to and from the cortex. Embedded within the white matter—which is sometimes called the arbor vitae (tree of life) because of its branched, tree-like appearance in cross-section—are four deep cerebellar nuclei, composed of gray matter.|$|E

500|$|In 1796 English {{botanist}} Richard Salisbury {{published a}} formal {{description of the}} species, from a specimen collected in Port Jackson (Sydney). [...] He gave it the name Protea anemonifolia, the specific epithet derived from anemone and <b>folium,</b> the latter meaning [...] "leaf", highlighting the resemblance of its leaves to those of anemones. The common name drumsticks is derived from their globular cones.|$|E
500|$|English {{botanist}} Richard Salisbury {{described this}} species in 1796 as Protea anethifolia, from a specimen collected in Port Jackson (Sydney). The species name {{is derived from}} the Latin words anethum [...] "dill" [...] and <b>folium</b> [...] "leaf", from the resemblance of its leaves to those of the herb. The common name is variously written as narrowleaf-, narrow-leaf-, or narrow-leafed drumsticks. The common name drumsticks {{is derived from the}} globular cones {{of the members of the}} genus.|$|E
500|$|First {{collected}} by Luis Née between March and April 1793, the fern-leaved banksia {{was described by}} Antonio José Cavanilles in 1800 as two separate species from two collections, first as Banksia oblongifolia from the vicinity of Port Jackson (Sydney), and then as Banksia salicifolia from around Botany Bay. Derived from the Latin words oblongus [...] "oblong", and <b>folium</b> [...] "leaf", the species name refers {{to the shape of}} the leaves. Richard Anthony Salisbury had published the name Banksia aspleniifolia in 1796 based on leaves of cultivated material.|$|E
500|$|B.sessilis var. flabellifolia was {{published}} by George in 1996, the type specimen having been collected northwest of Northampton in 1993. The northernmost of the four varieties, it is found from Kalbarri south to Geraldton and Northampton. There are some scattered records further south towards Moora. Its specific name {{is derived from the}} Latin flabellum [...] "fan" [...] and <b>folium</b> [...] "leaf". Its leaves are fan shaped, with a long, toothless lower margin, and a toothed end. Its stems are hairless, unlike the other varieties.|$|E
500|$|Brown {{eventually}} {{published the}} species in his 1810 work On {{the natural order}} of plants called Proteaceae. The specific name is derived from the Latin words ilex [...] "holly" [...] and <b>folium</b> [...] "leaf", hence [...] "holly-leaved". In 1810, Brown published Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen in which he arranged the genus into two unranked groups. B.ilicifolia was placed alone in Isostylis because of its unusual dome-shaped inflorescences. All other species were placed in Banksia verae, the [...] "true banksias", because they have the elongate flower spike then considered characteristic of Banksia.|$|E
500|$|B.integrifolia {{was first}} {{collected}} at Botany Bay on 29 April 1770, by Sir Joseph Banks and Dr Daniel Solander, naturalists on the Endeavour during Lieutenant (later Captain) James Cook's first voyage to the Pacific Ocean. However, the species was not published until April 1782, when Carolus Linnaeus the Younger described {{the first four}} Banksia species in his Supplementum Plantarum. Linnaeus distinguished the species by their leaf shapes, and named them accordingly. Thus the species with entire leaf margins was given the specific name integrifolia, from the Latin integer, meaning [...] "entire", and <b>folium,</b> meaning [...] "leaf". The full name for the species is therefore Banksia integrifolia L.f.|$|E
500|$|B.ericifolia {{was first}} {{collected}} at Botany Bay on 29 April 1770, by Sir Joseph Banks and Dr Daniel Solander, naturalists on the Endeavour during Lieutenant (later Captain) James Cook's first voyage to the Pacific Ocean. However, the species was not published until April 1782, when Carolus Linnaeus the Younger described {{the first four}} Banksia species in his Supplementum Plantarum. Linnaeus distinguished the species by their leaf shapes and named them accordingly. Thus the species with leaves reminiscent of heather (at the time classified in the genus Erica) was given the specific name ericaefolia, from the Latin erica, meaning [...] "heather", and <b>folium,</b> meaning [...] "leaf". This spelling was later adjusted to [...] "ericifolia"; thus the full name for the species is Banksia ericifolia L.f., with the initials L.f. identifying Carolus Linnaeus the Younger.|$|E

2500|$|The term [...] "folio", {{from the}} Latin <b>folium</b> (leaf), has three {{interconnected}} but distinct meanings {{in the world}} of books and printing. It is firstly a term for a common method of arranging sheets of paper into book form, folding the sheet only once, and a term for a book made in this way. [...] Secondly, it is a general term for a sheet, leaf or page in (especially) manuscripts and old books, and thirdly, an approximate term for the size of a book, and for a book of this size.|$|E
2500|$|Vitex rotundifolia is {{a member}} of the family Lamiaceae [...] and {{subfamily}} Viticoideae. The plant was originally described by the son of Carolus Linnaeus, Carl Linnaeus the Younger The original description was published in Supplementum Plantarum in 1782. The generic epithet, Vitex, is derived from the Latin viere, meaning “to bind or twist” in reference to the rope-like stems produced by some species in the genus. The specific epithet, rotundifolia, is derived from the Latin rotundus, which means [...] "round, spherical", and <b>folium,</b> meaning [...] "leaf.” This is a reference to the rounded character of the leaves.|$|E
2500|$|A folio (from Latin foliō, abl. of <b>folium,</b> leaf [...] ) {{is a book}} or {{pamphlet}} made up {{of one or more}} full {{sheets of}} paper, on each sheet of which four pages of text are printed, two on each side; each sheet is then folded one time to produce two leaves. [...] Each leaf of a folio book thus is one half the size of the original sheet. This contrasts with a quarto, folding each sheet twice, and octavo, folding each sheet three times. [...] Unlike the folio, these last, and further types involving more folds, require the pages of the book to be cut open after binding, which might be done mechanically by the printer, but in historic books was often left for the reader to do with a paper-knife.|$|E
2500|$|A leaf (often wrongly {{referred}} to as a folio) typically has two pages of text and/or images, front and back, in a finished book. The Latin for leaf is <b>folium,</b> therefore [...] "folio" [...] should be followed by a number to distinguish between recto and verso. Thus [...] "folio 5r" [...] means [...] "on the recto of the leaf numbered 5", although technically not accurate, it is normal to say [...] "on folio 5r". In everyday speech it is common to refer to [...] "turning the pages of a book", although it would be more accurate to say [...] "turning the leaves of a book"; this is the origin of the phrase [...] "to turn over a new leaf" [...] i.e. to start on a fresh blank page.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{thing that}} is born," [...] or [...] "put forth." [...] "When the branch is tender, and putteth forth her leaves, ye know that summer is nigh." [...] The botanists say, [...] "The leaf is an {{expansion}} of the bark of the stem." [...] More accurately, the bark is a contraction of the tissue of the leaf. For every leaf is born out of the earth, and breathes out of the air; and there are many leaves that have no stems, but only roots. It is 'the springing thing'; this thin film of life; rising, with its edge out of the ground--infinitely feeble, infinitely fair. With <b>Folium,</b> in Latin, is rightly associated the word Flos; for the flower is only a group of {42} singularly happy leaves. From these two roots come foglio, feuille, feuillage, and fleur;--blume, blossom, and bloom; our foliage, and the borrowed foil, and the connected technical groups of words in architecture and the sciences.|$|E
50|$|In codicology, each {{physical}} sheet (<b>folium,</b> abbreviated fol. or f.) of {{a manuscript}} is numbered, and the sides {{are referred to}} as <b>folium</b> rectum and <b>folium</b> versum, abbreviated as r and v respectively.
