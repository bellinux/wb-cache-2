Plover was initially <b>fitted</b> with <b>mine</b> recovery gear, but her mine capacity increased from 80 to 100 after it was removed when World War II began. Sometime during the war she received a Type 286 air warning radar.|$|R
50|$|Type IXs had six torpedo tubes; four at {{the bow and}} two at the stern. They carried six reloads {{internally}} and {{had five}} external torpedo containers (three at the stern and two at the bow) which stored ten additional torpedoes. The total of 22 torpedoes allowed U-boat commanders to follow a convoy and strike night after night. Some of the IXC boats were <b>fitted</b> for <b>mine</b> operations; as mine-layers they could carry 44 TMA or 66 TMB mines.|$|R
2500|$|For scenes where Peyton {{is drawing}} or painting, Ward stated, [...] "...there {{would likely be}} very light lines for her to follow. Often I would give a {{finished}} version and an unfinished for this purpose. If I remember correctly, it was usually the words that I left undone." [...] Regarding the evolution of Peyton's artwork over the years, she said, [...] "I {{look back at the}} first season and think the drawings are awful! I certainly became more comfortable working in her style, but I think her style also evolved to <b>fit</b> <b>mine.</b> Does that make sense?" [...] Ward clarified, [...] "Initially I was trying to do something that just didn’t flow well from me. The drawings were too clean. A little forced and not at all the way I liked to work." [...] Ward said that as the show progressed, she began to put more of my own style in them, and became more comfortable and the work got better. In Season 3, the artwork was promoted through the album Friends with Benefit. In Season 6, it is seen in color instead of in black and white, to reflect the character's happiness.|$|R

6000|$|I did not {{get back}} the same drawers I sent down, when our things came up at six-fifteen; I got a pair on a new plan. They were merely a pair of white ruffle-cuffed absurdities, hitched {{together}} at the top with a narrow band, {{and they did not}} come quite down to my knees. They were pretty enough, but they made me feel like two people, and disconnected at that. The man must have been an idiot that got himself up like that, to rough it in the Swiss mountains. The shirt they brought me was shorter than the drawers, and hadn't any sleeves to it--at least it hadn't anything more than what Mr. Darwin would call [...] "rudimentary" [...] sleeves; these had [...] "edging" [...] around them, but the bosom was ridiculously plain. The knit silk undershirt they brought me was on a new plan, and was really a sensible thing; it opened behind, and had pockets in it to put your shoulder-blades in; but they did not seem to <b>fit</b> <b>mine,</b> and so I found it a sort of uncomfortable garment. They gave my bobtail coat to somebody else, and sent me an ulster suitable for a giraffe. I had to tie my collar on, because there was no button behind on that foolish little shirt which I described a while ago.|$|R
5|$|After {{the end of}} the war Rossia {{returned}} to Kronstadt where she underwent a three-year refit that strengthened her armament. She was <b>fitted</b> with <b>mine</b> rails in 1914 and laid one minefield during World War I that damaged two German light cruisers. She was reconstructed beginning in late 1915 to further strengthen her armament, but played no part during the rest of the war as her crew became involved in revolutionary activities in 1917. She was taken over by the Bolsheviks in late 1917, but was put into reserve in 1918 and sold for scrap in 1922.|$|R
50|$|Because {{of these}} shortcomings, the M600 {{chemical}} fuze {{was removed from}} service around 1953 and replaced by the M603 single-impulse fuze, which used a mechanical trigger mechanism i.e. a belleville spring. The M603 fuze is inherently safe to handle and much more reliable. In addition to the standard M603 fuze, two additional fuzes are available: the M624 tilt-rod fuze (which offers full-width attack capability) and the M608 double-impulse fuze. The M624 fuze requires 3.75 pounds of pressure to move the tilt rod, and once it exceeds 20 degrees of tilt the mine will detonate. The M608 double-impulse fuze will not detonate the mine when the first tank drives over it: instead, it simply arms itself so that the mine detonates when the second vehicle (e.g. an APC or perhaps a truck towing a howitzer) following in the tracks of the first tank drives over it - an event which might occur seconds, hours or even weeks later. The M608 double-impulse fuze is particularly useful when <b>fitted</b> to <b>mines</b> located on the outer edges of minefields, because this gives tanks {{a false sense of}} security. The lead tank, for instance, can drive over 30 <b>mines</b> <b>fitted</b> with double-impulse fuzes without detonating any of them. This lures tanks deep into the minefield, where they eventually trigger <b>mines</b> <b>fitted</b> with the M603 or M624 fuze (both of which operate exclusively in single-impulse mode) and become trapped. Attempts to recover the tanks or rescue victims are hindered {{by the fact that the}} M608-fitted mines previously driven over are now operating in single-impulse mode, and also because minefields containing M15 mines usually contain various antipersonnel mines as well, for instance the M14 mine and M16 bounding mine. An additional benefit of double-impulse fuzes is that they give mines a degree of protection against clearance techniques which use blast overpressure or mine roller systems.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{introduces}} membership cloud {{function and}} membership cloud generator, then establishes membership cloud function model which is <b>fit</b> for <b>mine.</b> With {{the application of}} the model through simulation, the reliability of ring network, tree network and star network in mine is analyzed. We could know that ring network which has the maximum reliability but poor fault resistance ability costs for not all links and nodes could use double road and it is not suitable for mine roadway. Tree network and star network, whose reliability are poor than double ring network's, are more suitable for mine roadway and have high cost performance, so they are more suitable for application in mine...|$|R
