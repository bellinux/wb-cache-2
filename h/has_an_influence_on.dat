2500|$|Maharishi Vedic Astrology (also {{known as}} Maharishi Jyotish) {{premises}} that planets influence individual health. Jotyish is a vedanga {{within the field}} of vedic literature. Maharishi Jyotish is premised on the ability to precisely calculate mathematically the unfolding pattern of life, and to locate the trends and tendencies of an individual life within that pattern, making it possible to determine in advance whether a difficult period was coming, and to take action in the present to amend a future difficulty. Maharishi Jyotish asserts that the solar system <b>has</b> <b>an</b> <b>influence</b> <b>on</b> the human brain, cells and DNA. According to the Maharishi and his successor, Tony Nader, there is a correspondence between the nine Grahas of Vedic Astrology and the structure of DNA, the brain and the structure of cells. Each graha is associated with a gemstone: Maharishi Vedic Astrology associates the planets with the basal ganglia, thalmus and [...] hypothalmus; the 12 Bhavas (astrological houses) with cortical areas; the 12 Rashis (zodiac signs) with the cranial nerves; and the 27 Nakshatras (lunar mansions) with groups of the brainstem.|$|E
2500|$|Immanuel Kant also <b>has</b> <b>an</b> <b>influence</b> <b>on</b> how the {{individuals}} within The Matrix interact {{with one another}} and with the system. Kant states in his Critique of Pure Reason that people come to know and explore our world through synthetic means (language, etc.), and thus this makes it rather difficult to discern truth from falsely perceived views. This means we ourselves are our own agents of deceit, and so in order for one to know truth, one must choose to openly pursue truth. One may examine this explicitly in the scene that contains Agent Smith's monologue about the first version of the Matrix, which was to be a human utopia, a perfect world without suffering and with total happiness. Agent Smith exclaims, [...] "it was a disaster. No one accepted the program. Entire crops [...] were lost." [...] The machines had to amend their choice of programming in order to make people subservient to them, and so they conceived The Matrix {{in the image of the}} world in 1999. The world in 1999 was far from a utopia, but still humans accepted this over the suffering-less utopia. This is Kantian, because the machines wished to impose a perfect world on humans in an attempt to keep people content to remain completely submissive to the machines, both consciously and subconsciously, but humans are not easy to make content.|$|E

2500|$|Boas's work in {{physical}} anthropology brought together {{his interest in}} Darwinian evolution with his interest in migration {{as a cause of}} change. His most important research in this field was his study of changes in body form among children of immigrants in New York. Other researchers had already noted differences in height, cranial measurements, and other physical features between Americans and people from different parts of Europe. Many used these differences to argue that there is an innate biological difference between races. Boas's primary interest—in symbolic and material culture and in language—was the study of processes of change; he therefore set out to determine whether bodily forms are also subject to processes of change. Boas studied 17,821 people, divided into seven ethno-national groups. Boas found that average measures of cranial size of immigrants were significantly different from members of these groups who were born in the United States. Moreover, he discovered that average measures of cranial size of children born within ten years of their mothers' arrival were significantly different from those of children born more than ten years after their mothers' arrival. Boas did not deny that physical features such as height or cranial size were inherited; he did, however, argue that the environment <b>has</b> <b>an</b> <b>influence</b> <b>on</b> these features, which is expressed through change over time. This work was central to his influential argument that differences between races were not immutable. [...] Boas observed: ...|$|E

While the band's second album - Payin' the Dues - was in similar style as their debut album it also displayed a tighter musicianship and songwriting technique as well as keyboards by Anders Lindström. Grande Rock was the first studio album to be recorded without original guitarist Dregen and was {{a departure from the}} band's Detroit rock influenced sound to a more 1970's rock sound. The band continued to evolve their sound throughout their career, while Nicke Andersson claims that all of their music is based around three chords and a chorus the band had no interest in repeating themselves. On the band's later releases, Andersson's vocals incorporated soul influences from his and Scott Morgans sideproject The Solution. The Hellacopters also recorded many cover songs throughout their career of songs from bands and artist such as Radio Birdman, Misfits, Smokey Robinson, Nationalteatern, Alice Cooper, The Nomads, April Stevens, Sonic's Rendezvous Band, The Dictators, Love and others. However Andersson asserts that {{there is a difference between}} the music that inspires him and the music that <b>has</b> <b>an</b> <b>influence</b> <b>on</b> his music, Andersson has mentioned country music artist Guy Clark as an artist that inspires his songwriting without affecting the band's sound.|$|E
2500|$|Bassoon reeds, made of Arundo donax cane, {{are often}} {{made by the}} players themselves, {{although}} beginner bassoonists tend to buy their reeds from professional reed makers or use reeds made by their teachers. Reeds begin with a length of tube cane that is split into three or four pieces using a tool called a cane splitter. The cane is then trimmed and gouged to the desired thickness, leaving the bark attached. After soaking, the gouged cane is cut to the proper shape and milled to the desired thickness, or profiled, by removing material from the bark side. This {{can be done by}} hand with a file; more frequently it is done with a machine or tool designed for the purpose. After the profiled cane has soaked once again it is folded over in the middle. Prior to soaking, the reed maker will have lightly scored the bark with parallel lines with a knife; this ensures that the cane will assume a cylindrical shape during the forming stage. On the bark portion, the reed maker binds on one, two, or three coils or loops of brass wire to aid in the final forming process. The exact placement of these loops can vary somewhat depending on the reed maker. The bound reed blank is then wrapped with thick cotton or linen thread to protect it, and a conical steel mandrel (which sometimes has been heated in a flame) is quickly inserted in between the blades. Using a special pair of pliers, the reed maker presses down the cane, making it conform to the shape of the mandrel. (The steam generated by the heated mandrel causes the cane to permanently assume the shape of the mandrel.) The upper portion of the cavity thus created is called the [...] "throat," [...] and its shape <b>has</b> <b>an</b> <b>influence</b> <b>on</b> the final playing characteristics of the reed. The lower, mostly cylindrical portion will be reamed out with a special tool called a reamer, allowing the reed to fit on the bocal.|$|E

6000|$|... "The test of any {{doctrine}} {{is whether it}} can be translated into life, whether it will {{make any difference to}} the individual who accepts it. The doctrines expressed in the Creeds must stand or fall by the test. Consider, for instance, the fundamental doctrine in the Creeds, that of the Trinity, which has been much scoffed at. A belief in God, you will admit, <b>has</b> <b>an</b> <b>influence</b> <b>on</b> conduct, and the Trinity defines the three chief aspects of the God in whom Christians believe. Of what use to quarrel with the word Person if God be conscious? And the character of God <b>has</b> <b>an</b> <b>influence</b> <b>on</b> conduct. The ancients deemed him wrathful, jealous, arbitrary, and hence flung themselves before him and propitiated him. If the conscious God of the universe be good, he is spoken of as a Father. He is as once, in this belief, Father and Creator. And inasmuch as it is known that the divine qualities enter into man, and that one Man, Jesus, whose composite portrait--it is agreed--could not have been factitiously invented, was filled with them, we speak of God in man as the Son. And the Spirit of God that enters into the soul of man, transforming, inspiring, and driving him, is the Third Person, so-called. There is no difficulty so far, granted the initial belief in a beneficent God.|$|E

60|$|The mode of {{proceeding}} {{now required}} great caution {{on the part}} of Mark Woolston. His mind was fully made up not to desert his islands, although this might easily be done, by fitting out the ship for another voyage, filling her with sandal-wood, and bringing off all who chose to abandon the place. But Woolston had become infatuated with the climate, which had all the witchery of a low latitude without any of its lassitude. The sea-breezes kept the frame invigorated, and the air reasonably cool, even at the Reef; while, on the Peak, there was scarcely ever a day, in the warmest months, when one could not labour at noon. In this respect the climate did not vary essentially from that of Pennsylvania, the difference existing in {{the fact that there was}} no winter in his new country. Nothing takes such a hold on men as a delicious climate. They may not be sensible of all its excellencies while in its enjoyment, but the want of it is immediately felt, and <b>has</b> <b>an</b> <b>influence</b> <b>on</b> all their pleasures. Even the scenery-hunter submits to this witchery of climate, which casts a charm over the secondary beauties of nature, as a sweet and placid temper renders the face of woman more lovely than the colour of a skin, or the brilliancy of fine eyes. The Alps and the Apennines furnish a standing proof of the truth of this fact. As respects grandeur, a startling magnificence, and all that at first takes the reason, as well as the tastes, by surprise, the first are vastly in advance of the last; yet, no man of feeling or sentiment, probably ever dwelt a twelve-month amid each, without becoming more attached to the last. We wonder at Switzerland, while we get to love Italy. The difference is entirely owing to climate; for, did the Alps rise in a lower latitude, they would be absolutely peerless.|$|E
