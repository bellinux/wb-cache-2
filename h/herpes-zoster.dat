40|$|ABSTRACT BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Post-herpetic {{neuralgia}} {{is defined}} as pain persisting {{for more than three}} months after the resolution of skin eruptions observed in <b>herpes-zoster.</b> Post-herpetic neuralgia incidence is quite variable, increases with age, being more frequent among patients aged over 60, and is associated to reduced quality of life of affected individuals. The objective of this review is to discuss key aspects of post-herpetic neuralgia, particularly its pathophysiology, clinical signs, diagnosis, prevention and treatment. CONTENTS: Post-herpetic neuralgia pathophysiology is poorly understood and involves peripheral and central nervous system mechanisms. Associated clinical signs are variable and represented mainly by pain with neuropathic features and skin changes in dermatomes previously affected by <b>herpes-zoster.</b> Post-herpetic neuralgia prophylactic vaccination seems to be the best preventive option. Diagnosis of post-herpetic neuralgia is largely clinical and treatment involves an early-stage, multimodal approach. Among techniques described in the literature, there is pharmacological treatment which, when not effective, requires the implementation of interventional techniques. CONCLUSION: Post-herpetic neuralgia is a complex entity and should be treated in a multidisciplinary way aiming at improving patients' quality of life...|$|E
40|$|<b>Herpes-zoster</b> {{is caused}} by the {{reactivation}} of varicella-zoster virus (VZV). In this paper different hypotheses of how this re-emergence of virus comes about are reviewed and discussed. From these hypotheses, and epidemiological data describing the initial transmission of the virus, a mathematical model of primary disease (varicella) and reactivated disease (zoster) in developed countries is derived. The steady-state age distributions of zoster cases predicted by this model are compared with the observed distribution, derived from a review and analysis of published epidemiological data. The model allows differentiation between published hypotheses in which age of host may or may not influence the probability of viral reactivation. The results indicate that the probability of reactivation must increase with age to allow the observed pattern of zoster cases. The basic mathematical model presented provides a conceptual framework, which may be extended to assess possible control programmes...|$|E
40|$|A {{decision}} {{analytical model}} is presented and analysed {{to assess the}} effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of routine vaccination against varicella and <b>herpes-zoster,</b> or shingles. These diseases have as common aetiological agent the varicella-zoster virus (VZV). Zoster can more likely occur in aged people with declining cell-mediated immunity. The general concern is that universal varicella vaccination might lead to more cases of zoster: with more vaccinated children exposure {{of the general population}} to varicella infectives become smaller and thus a larger proportion of older people will have weaker immunity to VZV, leading to more cases of reactivation of zoster. Our compartment model shows that only two possible equilibria exist, one without varicella and the other one where varicella arid zoster both thrive. Threshold quantities to distinguish these cases are derived. Cost estimates on a possible herd vaccination program are discussed indicating a possible tradeoff choice. progetto Lagrange of the Fondazione ISI, Villa Gualino, viale Settimio Severo 65, 10133 Torino, ItaliaFondazione CRT/Progetto Lagrang...|$|E

40|$|Identification of {{the factors}} {{affecting}} reactivation of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) largely remains an open question. Exposure to solar ultra violet (UV) radiation is speculated to facilitate reactivation. Should the role of UV in reactivation be significant, VZV reactivation patterns would generally {{be expected to be}} synchronous with seasonal UV profiles in temperate climates. We analysed age and gender specific VZV notification time series data from Perth, Western Australia (WA). This city has more daily sunshine hours than any other major Australian city. Using the cosinor and generalized linear models, we tested these data for seasonality and correlation with UV and temperature. We established significant seasonality of varicella notifications and showed that while <b>herpes-zoster</b> (HZ) was not seasonal it had a more stable seasonal component in males over 60 than in any other subpopulation tested. We also detected significant association between HZ notifications and UV for the entire Perth population as well as for females and males separately. In most cases, temperature proved to be a significant factor as well. Our findings suggest that UV radiation may be important for VZV reactivation, under the assumption that notification data represent an acceptably accurate qualitative measure of true VZV incidence...|$|E
40|$|See the {{editorial}} by Gershon on pages 945 – 7.) A 1 -year-old boy was vaccinated with the Oka strain of varicella {{just prior to}} the discovery of a tumor that required intensive antitumor therapy. Three months later he developed herpes zoster, which developed into chronic verrucous lesions that were refractory to treatment with acyclovir and which subsequently dissemi-nated. DNA from a biopsy specimen of a chronic <b>herpes-zoster</b> lesion indicated that the Oka vaccine strain of the the virus caused this severe complication. Analysis of this viral DNA demonstrated a mutation in the viral thymidine kinase gene. Plasmids containing this altered gene were unable to produce functional thymidine kinase in an in vitro translation system. The presence of this mutation would explain the clinical resistance to acyclovir. This is the first report of Oka-strain varicella virus causing severe disease after reactivation and of resistance to acyclovir during an infection caused by this virus. Varicella can cause severe and persistent infections in immunocompromised patients who have inadequate varicella-zoster virus (VZV) –specific T cell–mediated im-mune (CMI) responses [1 – 8]. In some of these patients, the VZV infection does not heal and persists in the for...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The {{prevalence}} of neuropathic pain {{varies according to}} specific situations, due to multiple etiologies and manifestations, and may be located anywhere in the nervous system, being classified as peripheral or central. The classification has been modified with a certain frequency by the International Association for the Study of Pain in recent years, and may, for example, be classified as possible, probable or permanent. This brief review analyzes aspects of neuropathic pain epidemiology in general Brazilian population and in different clinical situations. CONTENTS: Data on neuropathic pain prevalence in general population are not reliable due to broad heterogeneity of studies, different definitions and evaluation methods. The same difficulties are found when neuropathic pain prevalence is evaluated in Brazil. The prevalence and/or incidence in different clinical situation varies according to specific clinical situation, since it has multiple etiologies and may be located anywhere in the nervous system. Clinical situations in which neuropathic pain is more frequent are <b>herpes-zoster,</b> diabetes, leprosy, trigeminal and glossopharyngeal neuralgia, low back pain, and also central neurological diseases. CONCLUSION: Data on the incidence and/or {{prevalence of}} chronic pain with neuropathic characteristics are very different and although this type of pain is being broadly studied in recent years, epidemiological studies are relatively scarce and the methodology used varies a lot...|$|E
40|$|This paper uses {{mathematical}} {{models and}} data analysis {{to examine the}} epidemiological implications of possible immunologically mediated links between patterns of varicella and <b>herpes-zoster</b> incidence in human communities. A review of previously published reports does not clarify {{whether or not there}} is a relationship between the incidence of varicella and the incidence of zoster. However, new analysis of data collected by the Royal College of General Practitioners provides indirect evidence for the hypothesis that a high intensity of varicella transmission suppresses viral reactivation. The significance of this finding for proposed varicella vaccination campaigns is explored by a review of published data on the use of the vaccine. No significant difference is shown to exist between the risk of zoster caused by the vaccine and the wild virus. A mathematical model is then developed to take into consideration the influence of the prevalence of varicella on viral reactivation and the impact of vaccination with attenuated virus, which may be able to recrudesce. Under some conditions, mass application of such vaccines may have the impact of increasing zoster incidence. The results presented here indicate that, before starting any vaccination programme against varicella, its consequences need to be assessed in much more depth...|$|E

40|$|Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV) is the causative {{agent of}} {{chickenpox}} during primary infection and <b>herpes-zoster</b> or shingles following reactivation from neuronal latency. The VZV ORF 66 protein kinase is a serine/threonine kinase {{and one of}} two VZV protein kinases. Its homologue in the alphaherpesviruses are termed the US 3 kinases, and through phosphorylation of targets affect many events in infection, influencing processes such as survival of the infected cell to apoptosis, the state of permissivity to gene expression, avoidance of immunity, modulating cellular pathways affecting host actin dynamics, and influencing the nuclear structure and nuclear membrane to enable assembly of virus components. ORF 66 is not essential in most cell culture but important for viral replication in T cells. In this work, we have found the ORF 66 is critical for viral growth in primary corneal fibroblasts and thus established a model for further investigatation of cell-type dependent functions for ORF 66. This finding may have important applications for viral pathogenesis as VZV reactivates and causes infection of the eye in herpes zoster ophthalmicus disease. Here we also describe a novel ORF 66 cellular target, the nuclear matrix protein, matrin 3. Specific matrin 3 phosphorylation is conserved for herpes simplex virus - type 1 and pseudorabies virus US 3 kinases. Thus, this finding may {{have important implications for}} the role of ORF 66 /US 3 function in common alphaherpesvirus strategies to utilize host cell machinery in establishing a host cell environment conducive to viral replication. ORF 66 /US 3 -induced phosphorylation of matrin 3 was needed for matrin nuclear retainment late in viral infection, suggesting that ORF 66 /US 3 may have a role in modulating matrin 3 nuclear functions needed for viral replication. The ORF 66 kinase is clearly important for VZV growth in certain cell types relevant to human disease and our studies underscore the diverse roles of this protein in VZV infection...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has {{recently}} recommended a new vaccine against herpes zoster (shingles) for routine use in adults aged >= 60 years. However, {{estimates of the}} cost effectiveness of this vaccine vary widely, {{in part because of}} gaps in the data on the value of preventing herpes zoster. Our aims were to (i) generate comprehensive information on the value of preventing a range of outcomes of herpes zoster; (ii) compare these values among community members and patients with shingles and post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN); and (iii) identify clinical and demographic characteristics that explain the variation in these values. Methods: Community members drawn from a nationally representative survey research panel (n = 527) completed an Internet-based survey using time trade-off and willingness-to-pay questions to value a series of scenarios that described cases of herpes zoster with varying pain intensities (on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 represents no pain and 10 represents the worst imaginable pain) and duration (30 days to 1 year). Patients with shingles (n_=_ 382) or PHN (n_=_ 137) [defined as having symptoms for >= 90 days] from two large healthcare systems completed telephone interviews with similar questions to the Internet-based survey and also answered questions about their current experience with herpes zoster. We constructed generalized linear mixed models to evaluate the associations between demographic and clinical characteristics, the length and intensity of the health states and time trade-off and willingness-to-pay values. Results: In time trade-off questions, community members offered a mean of 89 (95 % CI 24, 182) discounted days to avoid the least severe scenario (pain level of 3 for 1 month) and a mean of 162 (95 % CI 88, 259) discounted days to avoid the most severe scenario (pain level of 8 for 12 months). Compared with patients with shingles, community members traded more days to avoid low-severity scenarios but similar numbers of days to avoid high-severity scenarios. Compared with patients with PHN, community members traded fewer days to avoid high-severity scenarios. In multivariate analyses, older age was the only characteristic significantly associated with higher time trade-off values. In willingness-to-pay questions, community members offered a mean of $US 450 (95 % CI 203, 893) to avoid pain of level 3 for 1 month and a mean of $US 1384 (95 % CI 873, 2050) [year 2005 values] to avoid pain of level 8 for 12 months. Community members traded less money than patients with either shingles or PHN to avoid both low- and high-severity scenarios (p-valuesContingent-valuation, <b>Herpes-zoster,</b> Postherpetic-neuralgia, Utility-measurement, Varicella-zoster-virus-vaccine-live, Willingness-to-pay...|$|E
40|$|Background: Although {{there are}} {{estimated}} to be nearly 1 million cases of herpes zoster diagnosed in the US each year, the economic costs associated with herpes zoster in the US have not been well described. Objective: To describe the healthcare resource utilisation and costs associated with physician-diagnosed acute/subacute herpes zoster, from a payer perspective, using a large US healthcare claims database. Methods: Data for the period 2000 - 1 were obtained from the Medstat Marketscan healthcare claims database. The duration of acute/subacute herpes zoster was considered to include the 21 days preceding, and 90 days following, the initial herpes zoster diagnosis. Resource utilisation was examined for individuals with newly diagnosed acute/subacute herpes zoster (n_=_ 8741) and compared, through regression analyses, with that observed for control individuals from the same population (n_=_ 50 _ 000). Similar analyses were conducted for costs; the costs included reflected healthcare payments from patients, insurers and other sources. Regression analyses controlled for demographics (age, gender), conditions that have been observed with greater frequency among patients with acute/subacute herpes zoster in prior studies (cancer, HIV infection, organ transplantation, other immunosuppressive conditions and therapies) and the number of billed services within each of seven categories of care that were potentially related to acute/subacute herpes zoster and that were utilised within the 30 - 180 days prior to the diagnosis for affected patients, and over an analogous period for controls. Results: The acute/subacute phase of herpes zoster was estimated to result in an average of 1. 7 (standard error [SE] 0. 02) additional physician and hospital outpatient visits, 0. 05 (SE 0. 003) additional emergency room visits, 0. 03 (SE 0. 003) additional inpatient hospital admissions, 2. 1 (SE 0. 03) additional prescriptions filled and $US 431 (SE 17. 60) in additional healthcare costs per patient. Among patients with acute/subacute herpes zoster, 21. 1 % had a diagnosis code with a designation for a herpes zoster-related complication, and 9. 4 % had three or more outpatient visits with a diagnosis code for herpes zoster. The average estimated incremental costs per patient with acute/subacute disease increased with age, ranging from $US 258 (SE 37. 70) among patients aged = 80 years. The numbers of additional outpatient visits, inpatient admissions, prescriptions filled for pain medications and coded complications were also substantially higher among older than younger patients with acute/subacute herpes zoster. Conclusions: The management of acute/subacute herpes zoster was found to result in substantial healthcare costs, with outpatient care and prescription drugs comprising the majority of the cost burden. To more fully understand the overall cost of herpes zoster disease to society, future studies should examine the healthcare costs associated with post-herpetic neuralgia and productivity losses due to herpes zoster and post-herpetic neuralgia.
