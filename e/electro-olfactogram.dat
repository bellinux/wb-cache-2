50|$|A 2006 {{study from}} Japan focused on {{olfactory}} inhibition in chum salmon {{and their ability}} to recover from copper toxicity after being exposed to relevant copper concentrations that are often used on hatchery fishes. The fish were exposed to the relevant concentrations for four hours while using an <b>electro-olfactogram</b> (EOG). Results showed that copper toxicity both depended on exposure concentration and time. A combination of these parameters, as well as other parameters, can change the degree of impact on target sites as well as if the toxic effects are reversible or not. Under short-term, four-hour exposures the chum salmon recovered from the toxic effects after one day. In hatchery fish this short-term effect will likely not cause harm, but in wild fish this olfactory disruption may impair important survival instincts and strategies. Based on current research a specific mechanism of action for copper toxicity has not been identified and more research is needed.|$|E

However, {{it is not known}} whether the adenylate cyclase serves this function for all odorants or for only certain classes of odorants. To investigate this question, we have compared the abilities of 35 odorants to stimulate the adenylate cyclase and to elicit an electrophysiological response. We report a strong positive correlation between the magnitude of adenylate cyclase stimulation and the summated electrical response of the olfactory epithelium (<b>electro-olfactogram)</b> evoked by individual odorants. We also show that the adenylate cyclase stimulator forskolin equally attenuates the <b>electro-olfactogram</b> response for all odorants tested.

We found that PrP(C) was expressed in OSNs, in which, however, it was unevenly distributed, being detectable at low levels in cell bodies, dendrites and apical layer, and more abundantly in axons. We also studied the involvement of PrP(C) in the response of the olfactory epithelium to odorants, by comparing the <b>electro-olfactograms</b> of the 3 mouse lines subjected to different stimulation protocols.

40|$|Abstract—To {{identify}} potential hormonal pheromones of {{the round}} goby (Neogobius melanostomus), a species recently introduced to the Great Lakes, we used <b>electro-olfactogram</b> (EOG) recording to examine olfactory responsiveness to more than 100 steroids and prostaglandins. Neogobius detected free and conjugated 18 -, 19 - and 21 -carbon steroids, but did not detect prostaglandins. EOG cross-adaptation, used to determine if Neogobius can discriminate the detected compounds at the sensory level, suggested that the detected steroids act on four classes of olfactory receptor mechanisms named (according to the most potent ligand for each) : estrone, 17 b-estradiol- 3 b-glucuronide, etiocholanolone, and dehydroepiandrosterone- 3 -sulfate. Although none of the detected steroids induced reproductive behaviors, exposure to steroids from {{three of the four}} receptor classes (estrone, 17 b-estradiol- 3 b-glucuronide, or etiocholanolone) increased ventilation rate in males, whereas only etiocholanolone increased ventilation rate in females. Using the ventilation increase as a behavioral bioassay of steroid detection, behavioral cross-adaptation studies in males demonstrated that steroids discriminated at the sensory level are also discriminated behaviorally. These findings suggest the round goby may use steroids as putative pheromones.

In recent years, several pesticides have been identified that interfere with salmonid olfaction at concentrations in the g/L range; thus, they may pose a risk to species longevity. In the present study, we investigated the acute effects of five agricultural pesticides on juvenile coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) olfaction using the <b>electro-olfactogram</b> (EOG), a measure of odorant-evoked field potentials. <b>Electro-olfactogram</b> responses to the odorant L-serine were measured during and following a 30 -min exposure of the left olfactory rosette to chlorothalonil, endosulfan, glyphosate acid, iodocarb (IPBC), trifluralin, and 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid. With the relatively insoluble pesticides endosulfan and trifluralin, decreases in EOG amplitude were only apparent at relatively high concentrations (100 and 300 g/L, respectively) following 20 min of exposure and were absent for chlorothalonil (1 mg/L). With the water-soluble herbicide glyphosate, significant EOG reductions occurred within 10 min of exposure to 1 mg/L and more rapidly with higher concentrations. Recovery of EOG post–glyphosate exposure was concentration-dependent, and complete recovery was not observed with some concentrations at 60 min postexposure. Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid only affected EOG at high concentration (100 mg/L), where it eliminated EOG within 2 min of exposure.

40|$|Abstract—The {{sublethal}} {{effects of}} copper on the sensory physiology of juvenile coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) were evaluated. In vivo field potential recordings from the olfactory epithelium (<b>electro-olfactograms)</b> {{were used to}} measure the impacts of copper on the responses of olfactory receptor neurons to natural odorants (L-serine and taurocholic acid) and an odorant mixture (L-arginine, L-aspartic acid, L-leucine, and L-serine) over a range of stimulus concentrations. Increases in copper impaired the neurophysiological response to all odorants within 10 min of exposure. The inhibitory effects of copper (1. 0 – 20. 0 �g/L) were dosedependent and they were not influenced by water hardness. Toxicity thresholds for the different receptor pathways were determined by using the benchmark dose method and found to be similar (a 2. 3 – 3. 0 �g/L increase in total dissolved copper over background). Collectively, examination of these data indicates that copper is broadly toxic to the salmon olfactory nervous system. Consequently, short-term influxes of copper to surface waters may interfere with olfactory-mediated behaviors that are critical for the survival and migratory success of wild salmonids.

40|$|The gaseous {{signalling}} molecule {{nitric oxide}} (NO) {{is involved in}} various physiological processes including regulation of blood pressure, immunocytotoxicity and neurotransmission. In the mammalian olfactory bulb (OB), NO {{plays a role in}} the formation of olfactory memory evoked by pheromones as well as conventional odorants. While NO generated by the neuronal isoform of NO synthase (nNOS) regulates neurogenesis in the olfactory epithelium, NO has not been implicated in olfactory signal transduction. We now show the expression and function of the endothelial isoform of NO synthase (eNOS) in mature olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) of adult mice. Using NO-sensitive micro electrodes, we show that stimulation liberates NO from isolated wild-type OSNs, but not from OSNs of eNOS deficient mice. Integrated electrophysiological recordings (<b>electro-olfactograms</b> or EOGs) from the olfactory epithelium of these mice show that NO plays a significant role in modulating adaptation. Evidence for the presence of eNOS in mature mammalian OSNs and its involvement in odorant adaptation implicates NO as an important new element involved in olfactory signal transduction. As a diffusible messenger, NO could also have additional functions related to cross adaptation, regeneration, and maintenance of MOE homeostasis...|$|R

The terminal nerve usually contains gonadotropin-releasing hormone {{as well as at}} least one other peptide that has not been characterized, but which bears some structural similarity to molluscan cardioexcitatory tetrapeptide (FMRFamide) and neuropeptide tyrosine (NPY). We investigated the effects of FMRFamide on both voltage-gated currents and odorant responses in the olfactory epithelium of axolotls (Ambystoma mexicanum), using whole-cell patch clamp and <b>electro-olfactogram</b> (EOG) recording techniques. In the presence of FMRFamide, the magnitude of a voltage-gated inward current was dramatically increased, reaching an average of 136 % of the initial (pre-exposure) magnitude in neurons that showed a response to the peptide. This increase is detectable within ~ 1 – 2 min of exposure to FMRFamide and is sustained for at least 10 min. In EOG experiments, odorant responses are not affected during FMRFamide application, but are sometimes increased or decreased during the subsequent wash period. On average, the largest single EOG response in each trial was detected ~ 25 min after initial FMRFamide application, and ranged from 110 to 147 % of baseline. These results suggest that a compound similar to FMRFamide, if released from the terminal nerve, may function in peripheral olfactory signal modulation.

40|$|Pheromone {{trapping}} is {{an increasingly}} viable strategy to reduce invasive fish populations, {{largely due to}} the pheromones 2 ̆ 7 function of evoking behavioral responses among conspecifics. Prior to attempting such population control techniques, the pheromones must be identified and their possible influences on non-target species addressed. The round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) is a species invasive to the Great Lakes region, and negatively impacts the ecosystem by interfering with local fish populations. At least two 5 β-reduced 3 α-hydroxyl steroids released by reproductive N. melanostomus (11 -O-ETIO and 11 -O-ETIO- 3 s) evoke olfactory sensory responses from the olfactory epithelium of conspecifics, and water conditioned by reproductive males (containing these steroids) attracts female round gobies. In this study, we examined whether these putative pheromones, along with simultaneously-released 11 -O-ETIO- 17 s, stimulate olfactory sensory responses from alternative fish species sharing the same ecosystem as N. melanostomus in the Great Lakes region. Rock bass (Ambloplites rupestris), bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus), pumpkinseed sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus), smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu), and yellow perch (Perca flavescens) were the targets of an <b>electro-olfactogram</b> experiment designed to record responses to odors. When compared to round goby responses from previous studies, amino acids and the bile acid consistently elicited <b>electro-olfactogram</b> responses across all species, but only round gobies showed a response to the putative pheromones.

40|$|The main {{olfactory}} system of mice contains a small subset of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) that are stimulated by CO 2. The {{objective of this}} study was to record olfactory receptor responses to a range of CO 2 concentrations to further elucidate steps in the proposed CO 2 transduction pathway in mice. <b>Electro-olfactograms</b> (EOGs) were recorded before and after inhibiting specific steps in the CO 2 transduction pathway with topically applied inhibitors. Inhibition of extracellular carbonic anhydrase (CA) did not significantly affect EOG responses to CO 2 but did decrease EOG responses to several control odorants. Inhibition of intracellular CA or cyclic nucleotide-gated channels attenuated EOG responses to CO 2, confirming the role of these components in CO 2 sensing in mice. We also show that, like canonical OSNs, CO 2 -sensitive OSNs depend on Ca 2 +-activated Cl − channels for depolarization of receptor neurons. Lastly, we found that guanylyl cyclase-D knockout mice were still able to respond to CO 2, indicating that other pathways may exist for the detection of low concentrations of nasal CO 2.

40|$|<b>Electro-olfactograms</b> (EOGs) {{evoked by}} 8 odorants from frog {{olfactory}} epithelia during ciliary regrowth and during epithelial regeneration were analyzed. During ciliary regrowth following detergent-induced ciliary removal, EOG amplitudes initially increase proportionately with ciliary length. EOGs reach maximal amplitudes after 2 days of growth, when cilia are 40 [mu]m long. Therefore olfactory transduction sites are located primarily on cilia {{rather than on}} the dendrite terminal and most of the receptor current enters through the proximal portion of the cilium. Zinc sulfate lavage of the nasal cavity causes selective necrosis of the receptor epithelium. During epithelial regeneration, EOGs increase linearly with time from 13 days after zinc lavage, the time of first cilium emergence, through 30 days. The rate of incrase is different for different odorants. At 30 days and within a period of a few days, EOG amplitudes increase abruptly, then asymptote. Thus the development of recetors for different substances occurs at different rates and occurs in two steps. The transition between the two developmental states is coincident with arrival of receptor axon terminals at the central nervous system and with the immobilization of the ciliary contractile apparatus. Since there is continual generation of new receptor neurons throughout life, EOGs recorded in a normal nose reflect a complex combination of the differing receptor processes of cells of diffring developmental stages...|$|R
40|$|Many {{species of}} {{freshwater}} fish with relatively simple mating strategies release hormonally derived sex pheromones in urine. However, {{it is not known}} whether species with more complex reproductive strategies use specialized urinary chemical signals. We addressed this by using the Mozambique tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus Peters 1852), a lek-breeding species in which males establish dominance hierarchies and visiting females mate preferentially with territorial/dominant males. We measured urination frequency of territorial males in social isolation and in the presence of females that were either ready to spawn or had finished spawning. In groups of fish, we monitored the volume of urine stored in subordinate and dominant males to determine if urine volume and olfactory potency (by recording <b>electro-olfactograms,</b> EOG, in females) are related to the male’s social rank. Dominant, territorial males stored more urine than subordinates and released it in short pulses, the frequency of which increased in the presence of females ready to spawn but not in the presence of post-spawn females. Urine from subordinate and dominant males was fractionated by liquid chromatography and fractions tested for olfactory potency by using the EOG, with the most potent fraction analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS). The olfactory system of females was sensitive to a urinary compound that was more abundant in the urine of dominant males than in that of subordinates. MS analysis suggested the compound is a sulfated aminosterol- like compound with a formula of C 29 H 40 N 2 O 10 S. Therefore, we suggest that dominant/territorial tilapia males dramatically increase urination frequency in the presence of females ready to spawn and that the urinary odorant acts as a pheromonal signal of dominance, thereby influencing female spawning...|$|R

40|$|Background: Social {{plasticity}} is {{a pervasive}} feature of animal behavior. Animals adjust {{the expression of}} their social behavior to the daily changes in social life and to transitions between life-history stages, and this ability has an impact in their Darwinian fitness. This behavioral plasticity may be achieved either by rewiring or by biochemically switching nodes of the neural network underlying social behavior in response to perceived social information. Independent of the proximate mechanisms, at the neuromolecular level social plasticity relies on the regulation of gene expression, such that different neurogenomic states emerge in response to different social stimuli and the switches between states are orchestrated by signaling pathways that interface the social environment and the genotype. Here, we test this hypothesis by characterizing {{the changes in the}} brain profile of gene expression in response to social odors in the Mozambique Tilapia, Oreochromis mossambicus. This species has a rich repertoire of social behaviors during which both visual and chemical information are conveyed to conspecifics. Specifically, dominant males increase their urination frequency during agonist encounters and during courtship to convey chemical information reflecting their dominance status. Results: We recorded <b>electro-olfactograms</b> to test {{the extent to which the}} olfactory epithelium can discriminate between olfactory information from dominant and subordinate males as well as from pre- and post-spawning females. We then performed a genome-scale gene expression analysis of the olfactory bulb and the olfactory cortex homolog in order to identify the neuromolecular systems involved in processing these social stimuli. Conclusions: Our results show that different olfactory stimuli from conspecifics' have a major impact in the brain transcriptome, with different chemical social cues eliciting specific patterns of gene expression in the brain. These results confirm the role of rapid changes in gene expression in the brain as a genomic mechanism underlying behavioral plasticity and reinforce the idea of an extensive transcriptional plasticity of cichlid genomes, especially in response to rapid changes in their social environment...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT—It {{has been}} {{reported}} that amphibians can smell not only airborne odorants but also amino acids. It is not clear, however, whether the signal transduction pathway of the amino acid responses is same as that of volatile odorant responses. In this study, we use patch-clamp recordings of newt olfactory receptor neurons to show that amino acid (200 µM glutamic acid, acidic; 200 µM arginine, basic; 200 µM alanine or cysteine, neutral) responses are accompanied by inducing depolarizing currents. Moreover, responses to both amino acids and forskolin, a stimulator of adenylate cyclase, were observed in the same cells, which indicates that the cells responding to amino acids possess the cAMP-system. In addition, our EOG (<b>electro-olfactogram)</b> studies show that forskolin attenuates not only responses to volatile odorants, but also those to amino acids.

40|$|Intensive {{aquaculture}} {{is heavily}} dependent on high-quality fishmeal to meet their protein requirements. However, due to the increased demand, decreased availability, raising costs and the potential presence of organic and inorganic contaminants, it is of economical and environmental interest to replace fishmeal by a renewable protein sources. This is particularly challenging since replacing fishmeal may lack appropriate chemical stimulants for active consumption. Fish have a well-defined olfactory sensitivity to L-amino acids (Hara, 1994), and this phenomenon is generally held {{to be involved in}} the location and identification of food (Carr et al., 1996). Olfactory sensitivity in fish can be assessed by <b>electro-olfactogram</b> (EOG); a field potential recorded from just above the olfactory epithelium (Scott and Scott-Johnson, 2002). Due to the high electrical conductivity of seawater, EOG responses recorded in marine fish are, however, of lower amplitude than those recorded in freshwater fish (Silver et al., 1976). It is unclear, however, to what extent EOG recording in seawater may underestimate the olfactory sensitivity of a given species when compared to more invasive recording methods, such as multi-unit recording from the olfactory nerve. The blackspot seabream is a promising new species for the finfish aquaculture industry; however, little is known about its biology. The current study investigated its olfactory sensitivity to amino acids and compared the efficacy of two different experimental approaches: multi-unit recording from the olfactory nerve and the <b>electro-olfactogram</b> (EOG).

40|$|Intestinal {{epithelium}} {{development is}} dramatically impaired in germfree rodents, but the conséquences {{of the absence}} of microbiota have been overlooked in other epithelia. In the present study, we present the first description of the bacterial communities associated with the olfactory epithelium and explored differences in olfactory epithelium characteristics between germfree and conventional, specific pathogen-free, mice. While the anatomy of the olfactory epithelium was not significantly different, we observed a thinner olfactory cilia layer along with a decreased cellular turn-over in germfree mice. Using <b>electro-olfactogram,</b> we recorded the responses of olfactory sensitive neuronal populations to various odorant stimulations. We observed a global increase in the amplitude of responses to odorants in germfree mice as well as altered responses kinetics. These changes were associated with a decreased transcription of most olfactory transduction actors and of olfactory xenobiotic metabolising enzymes. Overall, we present here the first evidence that the microbiota modulates the physiology of olfactory epithelium. As olfaction is a major sensory modality for most animal species, the microbiota may have an important impact on animal physiology and behaviour through olfaction alteration...|$|E
40|$|Background: The urine of {{freshwater}} fish species investigated so far acts {{as a vehicle for}} reproductive pheromones affecting the behaviour and physiology of the opposite sex. However, the role of urinary pheromones in intra-sexual competition has received less attention. This is particularly relevant in lek-breeding species, such as the Mozambique tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus), where males establish dominance hierarchies and there is the possibility for chemical communication in the modulation of aggression among males. To investigate whether males use urine during aggressive interactions, we measured urination frequency of dye-injected males during paired interactions between size-matched males. Furthermore, we assessed urinary volume stored in the bladder of males in a stable social hierarchy and the olfactory potency of their urine by recording of the <b>electro-olfactogram.</b> Results: Males released urine in pulses of short duration (about one second) and markedly increased urination frequency during aggressive behaviour, but did not release urine whilst submissive. In the stable hierarchy, subordinate males stored less urine than males of higher social rank; the olfactory potency of the urine was positively correlated with the rank of the male donor...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Electrophysiological {{experiments}} {{indicate that}} olfactory recep-tors {{of the channel}} catfish, Ictalurus punctatus, contain different receptor sites for the acidic (A), basic (B), and neutral amino acids; further, at least two partially interacting neutral sites exist, one for the hydrophilic neutral amino acids containing short side chains (SCN), and the second for the hydrophobic amino acids containing long side chains (LCN). The extent of cross-adaptation was determined by comparing the <b>electro-olfactogram</b> (EOG) responses to 20 "test " amino acids during continuous bathing of the olfactory mucosa with water only (control) to those during {{each of the eight}} "adapting " amino acid regimes. Both the adapting and test amino acids were adjusted in concentrations to provide approximately equal response magnitudes in the unadapted state. Under all eight adapting regimes, the test FOG responses were reduced from those obtained in the unadapted state, but substantial quantitative differences resulted, depending upon the molecular structure of the adapting stimulus. Analyses of the patterns of EOG responses to the test stimuli identified an...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Larval {{sea lamprey}} inhabit {{freshwater}} streams and migrate to oceans or lakes to feed after a radical metamorphosis; subsequently, mature adults return to streams to spawn. Previous observations suggested that lamprey utilize {{the odor of}} conspecific larvae to select streams for spawning. Here we report biochemical and electrophysiological evidence that this odor is comprised of two unique bile acids released by larvae. High performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry demonstrated that larval sea lamprey produce and release two unique bile acids, allocholic acid (ACA) and petromyzonol sulfate (PS). <b>Electro-olfactogram</b> (EOG) recording also demonstrated that the olfactory system of migratory adult sea lamprey is acutely and specifically sensitive to ACA and PS; detection thresholds for these compounds were ~ 10 -t 2 i. ACA and PS were the most potent of 38 bile acids tested and cross-adaptation experiments suggested that adult sea lamprey" have specific olfactory receptor sites associated with independent signal transduction pathways for these bile acids. These receptor sites specifically recognize the key substituents of ACA and PS such as a 5 a-hydrogen, three axial hydroxyls, and...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, behavioral, electrophysiological, and {{molecular}} biological experiments {{were developed to}} examine the role of aggressive interaction ("fighting experience") on downstream movement and olfactory function in relation to smoltification in hatchery-reared one-year-old masu salmon (Oncorhynchus masou). Individual salmon that lost the fighting contest in April and May moved downstream earlier than the winners. The olfactory response to salinity sensitivity of the losers, measured by <b>electro-olfactogram</b> to 10 ^[- 1] M sodium chloride, {{was significantly higher than}} that of the winners during the period from April to June. In May, the olfactory response to imprinting activity of the losers, previously exposed for one week to 10 ^[- 4] M L-glutamic acid was significantly high, and the salmon olfactory imprinting-related gene was also highly expressed. During the smoltification period, losing the aggressive interaction might exert strong influences on downstream movement and olfactory function in masu salmon. The present newly developed experiments provide new evidence for evaluating the relation between the aggressive interaction and the smoltification in masu salmon...|$|E
40|$|In vivo {{investigations}} of catfish olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) were previously limited to studying responses of spontaneously active cells. The olfactory organ, however, also contains ORNs that lack spontaneous activity {{and respond to}} amino acids. To record electrical activity of ORNs that were inactive prior to stimulation, we bathed the olfactory organ with low conductive, highly purified water that reduces shunting and enables detection of action potentials from ORNs distant to the electrode. After stimulation with amino acids, these ORNs elicited either phasic–tonic or tonic only activities. The spike frequency of the phasic activity consisted of transient frequencies up to 108  Hz that lasted 2 amino acids that included l-norvaline. In 29 of 31 neurons responding to > 1 amino acid, {{the duration of the}} responses to the most stimulatory amino acid was at least double compared to that to the other amino acids. The amplitude of <b>electro-olfactogram</b> (EOG) correlated significantly with the number of ORNs activated by the same amino acids confirming that the EOG represents the sum of ORN receptor potentials...|$|E
