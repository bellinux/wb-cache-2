Notice how a higher compression ratio first affects the high-frequency textures in the upper-left {{corner of the}} image, and how the contrasting lines become more fuzzy. The very high compression ratio severely affects {{the quality of the}} image, although the overall colors and image form are still recognizable. However, the precision of colors suffer less (for a human eye) than the precision of contours (based on luminance). This justifies the fact that images should be first transformed in a color model separating the luminance from the chromatic information, before subsampling the chromatic planes (which may also use lower quality quantization) in order to preserve the precision of the luminance plane with more <b>information</b> <b>bits.</b>|$|E
