5|$|Brooks {{moved into}} feature film work {{when he wrote}} and co-produced the 1979 film Starting Over. His next project was the {{critically}} acclaimed film Terms of Endearment, which he produced, directed and wrote, winning an Academy Award for all three roles. Basing his next film, Broadcast News, on his journalistic experiences, the film earned him a further two Academy Award nominations. Although his 1994 work I'll Do Anything was hampered by negative press attention due to the cutting of all of its recorded musical numbers, As <b>Good</b> <b>as</b> <b>It</b> <b>Gets</b> (co-written with Mark Andrus) earned further praise. It was seven years until his next film, 2004's Spanglish. His sixth film, How Do You Know, was released in 2010. Brooks also produced and mentored Cameron Crowe on Say Anything... (1989) and Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson on Bottle Rocket (1996).|$|E

As <b>Good</b> <b>as</b> <b>It</b> <b>Gets</b> received a total of seven Academy Award nominations, winning two, both for Best Actor for Jack Nicholson and Best Actress for Helen Hunt. Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader labelled it Brooks' best film, stating [...] "what Brooks manages to do with [...] as they struggle mightily to {{connect with one another}} is funny, painful, beautiful, and basically truthful—a triumph for everyone involved." [...] It also ranked 140 in Empire 2008 list of [...] "The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time".

2500|$|The game company Nintendo {{worked closely}} with Argonaut {{during the early years}} of the NES and SNES. They {{developed}} a prototype on the NES, initially codenamed [...] "NESGlider", which was inspired by their earlier 8-bit game Starglider, and ported this prototype to the SNES. Programmer Jez San told Nintendo that this was <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> could <b>get</b> unless they were allowed to design custom hardware to make the SNES better at 3D. Nintendo assented to this, and San hired chip designers to make the Super FX chip, the first 3D graphics accelerator in a consumer product. The Super FX was so much more powerful than the SNES's standard processor that the development team joked that the SNES was just a box to hold the chip.|$|R

He owned a 51% majority stake in the club and has made significant loans to the club to ensure its continued operation. Former Leicester City chairman John Elsom also joined {{the board of directors}} along with racehorse stable trainer and owner Michael Chapman in December 2002. However, with cash flow problems, corners had to be cut and the squad was paper thin, numbers were mainly made up by inexperienced youth team players, and loan signings of questionable purpose. Like many other teams who suffer a relegation in the previous season, Grimsby got off to a mediocre start and a lower mid-table finish was <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> would <b>get</b> for Slade's men.|$|R

The critic Ed Gonzalez reviewed the DVD negatively, calling the picture quality [...] "atrocious on the small screen", going {{on to say that}} [...] "the image quality of this video transfer is downright lousy from start to finish." [...] However, reviewer Robert Mack generally wrote favourably of the picture quality, noting excellence in the shots' detail and sharpness and the lack of compression artefacts, but describing an unfavourable darkness to scenes filmed within the manor house. Both reviewers commented positively on the film's score and soundtrack. Gonzalez wrote that [...] "Gosford Park sounds amazing for a film so dialogue-dependent" [...] and Mack that [...] "the audio transfer is about <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> can <b>get</b> on a movie of this style." ...|$|R
500|$|Brooks {{agreed to}} produce and direct Old Friends, a {{screenplay}} by Mark Andrus. Andrus' script [...] "needed you to suspend disbelief" [...] but Brooks realised [...] "my style when directing is that I really don't {{know how to get}} people to suspend disbelief." [...] Brooks spent a year reworking the screenplay: [...] "There were changes made and the emphasis was changed but it's the product, really, of a very unusual writing team," [...] and the project became As <b>Good</b> <b>as</b> <b>It</b> <b>Gets,</b> taking a year to produce after funding had been secured. According to The New York Times, Brooks [...] "was constantly experimenting, constantly reshooting, constantly re-editing" [...] the film, changing its ending five times and allowing the actors to improvise the film's tone.|$|E

[...] In the post-race press conference, the third-place finisher, Gilliland, said, [...] "It's a credit to NASCAR and their new rules, {{trying to get the}} (cars) closer, to let teams like us have a chance to be competitive.

Several high-profile fans have expressed their appreciation of the song. Musician Ben Folds told Blender [...] "everything about it—the songwriting, the music—is state of the art. It’s as <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>gets.</b> Anytime I hear it on the radio or a mix tape, I jump around like a freak." [...] J Mascis said his band Dinosaur Jr.'s affection for the song inspired them to record a cover version that was released in 1989. On 16 July 2006, [...] "Just Like Heaven" [...] was played as a wake-up call for the crew of Space Shuttle Discovery on their flight STS-121 at the request of astronaut Piers Sellers' family; Sellers told mission control center that the song reminded him of [...] "the wild, happy, beer-drinking years of my youth." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Today Is Your Day" [...] is a {{song with}} a length of 3 minutes and 12 seconds. The song is a slow mid-tempo ballad of the country pop genre. Nonetheless, several critics, such as Nicholas Köhler and Ken MacQueen Maclean's, have {{described}} the track to {{be a piece of}} pop music, rather than country music. It commences with a sole piano accompanying Twain's voice, and later progresses to an assortment of banjo, string instruments and other instrumentation. However, the production is maintained as sparse, leaving Twain's vocals at center. The lyrics are written in second person and discuss optimism and personal upliftment. In the bridge she sings, [...] "Brush yourself off no regrets / This is as <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>gets</b> / Don’t expect more or less / Just go out and give it your best", meaning one must be able to disregard dreaming for a better day because [...] "today is all you’ve got". Melinda Newman of HitFix presumed, considering Twain's back story, that Twain wrote [...] "Today Is Your Day" [...] as a message for herself.|$|E

Her other television roles include recurring appearances as Marlene on Dharma & Greg, and Penny in two episodes of Dead Like Me. Smith has also appeared in Phil of the Future and Teen Angel. Her one-scene role as pregnant checkout girl Nancy in 1991's City Slickers earned her [...] "more attention than all [...] previous roles combined", and taught her [...] "that it's far better to have small parts in big movies that everyone sees." [...] In 1997, she appeared as Lulu the palm reader in the independent film Just Write. Her other roles include parts in Barry Levinson's Toys and James L. Brooks' As <b>Good</b> <b>as</b> <b>It</b> <b>Gets.</b> Brooks, who is also executive producer of The Simpsons, had cast Smith in his 1994 film I'll Do Anything (in one of the film's musical numbers), but her part was cut.

Beck capped off the successful season by being the runner up to Mike Bossy for the Calder Memorial Trophy as the league's top first year player. [...] Beck thoroughly enjoyed his time in the Mile High State. [...] "There wasn't any pressure on me (in Colorado)," [...] Beck recalled. [...] "For one thing, there was hardly any media coverage, and there weren't very many fans. The first year was great. We'd just party and have a good time.

[...] TV Verdict's Erich Asperschlager said: [...] "Part Da Vinci Code, part National Treasure, and part Professor Layton, [...] "Gone Maggie Gone" [...] shakes up the Simpsons formula in a fun way by introducing one of those American-history-conspiracy-theory-cult-mysteries that are so popular with the kids, as well as those brain-bending-word-and-logic-puzzles that aren’t.

500|$|Mega Man 6 {{has enjoyed}} a {{favorable}} reception from gaming publications and websites. The graphics, play control, challenge level, and added power-ups were generally praised. GamePro was impressed {{with some of the}} newer enemies and larger mid-stage bosses, but was displeased with the game's recycling of Master Weapons seen in previous Mega Man games. Overall, the magazine described the graphics, audio, and level design in Mega Man 6 as standard fare for the franchise and called the game a [...] "rock of reliable NES fun" [...] in a series that is as [...] "predictable as the tide". Destructoid editor Tony Ponce considered Mega Man 6 the best game in the entire series. He argued that the game [...] "was retro before retro was cool" [...] due to Capcom's decision to develop it as a higher profile game on the NES during the era of fourth generation consoles. He also expressed appreciation for its music, introductions for each Robot Master, and the use of branching pathways in each level, among many other reasons. Nintendo Power listed Mega Man 6 as the best NES game of 1993, stating, [...] "His sixth NES adventure, in which he uses two new, Special Power-Ups, might just be his best". Craig Skistimas of ScrewAttack also appreciated these innovations and regretted missing out on the game when it was first released. Mega Man 6 is listed by IGN as the 58th best game on the NES. The writers summarized, [...] "Mega Man 6 is {{considered by many to be}} the last worthwhile NES release in the catalog, and though that's not saying much when looking at the title's contemporaries, Mega Man 6 is still as <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>gets</b> in many respects." ...|$|E

50|$|Washinee ‘Smiling Water’ and Washining ‘Laughing Water’ are romanticized, made-up {{meanings}} for {{the twin}} equal lakes; no Amerindian {{would think of}} places in that way. On consulting John C. Huden’s Indian place names of New England, NY, 1962, Museum of the American Indian—Heye Foundation, one can find the following entry, p. 271:Washining Litchfield County, Conn. Mahican, ‘mountain country’ or perhaps a corruption of Ossining, ‘stony land’. Variant, Washee. Washinee.There are some problems here. The first element Wash- seems similar to Massachusett wadchu ‘mountain, hill’, but the medial element -in- can’t be explained, and the final element -ing {{would seem to be}} clear enough as ‘at the place of’, but that last would imply a Delaware (Munsee, Unami) word and not Mahican, which used -uk (like /uck/ in English). So let’s bypass Huden’s first idea, but Delaware “Ossining” (‘stone-at’) matches extremely well Washining. Is there a lot of stoniness around those twin lakes? However, Mahican ‘stone’ is assen (+ -uk), but Munsee Delaware would be asúnung ‘stone-at’ (u as the a in sofa). Munsee has wáasiingw ‘pickerel’, but that medial -in- in the lake names is not accounted for.For a try at the etymology see Masthay’s book Schmick’s Mahican dictionary, 1991, on page 92, where there is the surprisingly similar wãhs’nanè, waásnanè with a preaspirated s (not sh, but h+s, which gives a breathiness to the word), and it means ‘Make it bright’ (an imperative; German Mache es helle), and Schmick shows wãhs’nanégan ‘light, brightness’ (‘candle, candlelight, lamp, torch’?) with the Algonquian abstract final for nouns -egan; thus probably pronounced /WANHS-nuh-NEE-gunn/. Perhaps that sounds like variable Washining. This is just about <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> can <b>get</b> for an etymology.|$|R
