5000|$|<b>Foster</b> <b>views</b> his {{roles as}} art critic and art {{historian}} as complementary rather than mutually opposed, {{in accordance with}} his adherence to postmodernism. In an interview published in the Journal of Visual Culture, he said, [...] "I've never seen critical work in opposition to historical work: like many others I try to hold the two in tandem, in tension. History without critique is inert; criticism without history is aimless".|$|E

5000|$|In {{his book}} Mystery and Philosophy (SCM Press, 1957), Foster seeks {{to explore the}} {{existence}} of mystery in various secular and religious disciplines in order to discover whether it serves a legitimate function in theology and philosophy when possibly applied to scientific and political realities. Foster asserts that realities exist (i.e., those found in revelation and appealed to in prayer) that are mysterious and will remain so; <b>Foster's</b> <b>view</b> of mystery like that of Gabriel Marcel's is therefore quite different from his view of unsolved puzzles and problems, which he, here following Marcel, holds only temporarily appear mysterious. [...] This idea of irresolvable mystery is similar to ones {{also found in the}} works of Eric L. Mascall and Norman Geisler. [...] Foster concludes this book by stating [...] "Faith is directed upon mystery, as revelation springs from mystery, and as prayer seems properly to be directed upon mysterious objects." [...] Mention of <b>Foster's</b> <b>view</b> of mystery {{can be found in the}} work of the philosopher Ann Hartle, for example.|$|R

60|$|A man sat at {{the spot}} he had marked and the chairs on both sides were unoccupied, but when Foster {{sat down in the}} nearest he saw the fellow was a stranger. This puzzled him, since he did not think he had been mistaken. It was, however, {{possible}} that Daly had been there, but had moved off quietly when <b>Foster's</b> <b>view</b> was obstructed. If so, he must have had an object for hiding, and Foster waited some minutes before he went to the office and examined the guestbook. Daly's name did not appear, and he found that nobody from the West had signed the book recently.|$|R
5000|$|Foster {{became a}} member of the IWW upon his arrival but soon became disaffected with the organization's dual union strategy, {{organizing}} workers in opposition to other unions already in the field. A brief stint in Europe in 1910 served only to solidify <b>Foster's</b> <b>views</b> on the matter. He returned home committed to the idea of working as a member of the unions of the American Federation of Labor and [...] "boring from within" [...] their ranks to radicalize these previously cautious and conservative bodies. Foster sought to launch a newspaper as an expression of his views, initially remaining within the ranks of the IWW and attempting to steer the organization to his point of view.|$|R
50|$|Oakland's first African American Superintendent was Dr. Marcus Foster, who {{was also}} the first black man to head a major U.S. school district. Born in Athens, GA, Dr. Foster arrived in Oakland in 1970, “already a celebrated and proven educator”. Dr. <b>Foster</b> <b>viewed</b> the three Rs and {{critical}} thinking as the building blocks of education. He also emphasized the need for art programs, team sports, and school activities that reflected the life circumstances of the students. In the short time he was in Oakland, Dr. Foster created a climate that gave life to a number of firsts: the Arts Magnet School, Far West School, Street Academy, Montera Film Festival (now the National Educational Film Festival), and the Oakland Education Institute (now the Marcus Foster Education Institute). Dr. Foster was murdered by the Symbionese Liberation Army in November, 1973.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{developments}} in IT industry {{lead to the}} notion of a Service, as an abstraction for an encapsulated business activity, hidden behind a well-defined interface. This abstraction <b>fosters</b> the <b>view</b> of complex business activities, as interactions between Services, allowing for an agile business activity modification. Furthermore, a breakdown of the monolithic business activity, into cooperating services, enables a simpler identification of Service’s capabilities, needed to accomplish given business goal. This <b>fosters</b> a clearer <b>view</b> of the overall process, in regard to outsourcing opportunities for external allocation of Services. The description of Services and collaborations between them, leads to the definition of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). In our understanding of SOA, a business activity is a set of messages being exchanged between Services, to enable the achievement of a common business goal. To allow for a correct business activity execution, well-defined choreography of, and coordination between, participating Services is necessary. To enable the coordination, the participants (Services) of a business activity have to exchange messages, representing the coordination flow. Thus, the services are being controlled by a coordination protocol. It is no...|$|R

40|$|Treating visuals as {{sites of}} power inscription, the authors advance a Foucauldian design model {{based on the}} Panopticon—Bentham's late-eighteenth-century {{architectural}} figure for empowerment based on bimodal surveillance.

The limitations of panoptic theory are located in its neglect of oppositional practices—seen as the most compelling horizon for research on the empowerment of designer and viewer through visual design...|$|R
50|$|Birmingham {{were drawn}} against West Ham United in the two-legged semi-final. In the first leg, at Upton Park, West Ham had much {{the best of}} the first half, taking a {{deserved}} lead when Mark Noble scored from a tight angle with <b>Foster's</b> <b>view</b> at the near post obscured by Scott Dann. Dann sustained an injury just before half-time which was to keep him out {{for the rest of the}} season. Early in the second half, Birmingham equalised through Ridgewell's header from a corner, then took a man advantage when Victor Obinna was sent off for kicking Larsson in the groin. Even after a penalty was denied when Barry Ferguson was knocked flying by Matthew Upson, it looked as Birmingham would go on to win, but goalkeeper Foster blundered when he allowed a weak shot from Carlton Cole to go through him. West Ham increased their lead to 3-1 on aggregate in the first half of the second leg when Cole collected a throw-in and shot past Foster from 25 yd. The half-time introduction of Žigić put pressure on West Ham's defence. A penalty appeal against Wayne Bridge for handball was rejected, but from the resultant corner, Lee Bowyer tied the scores on the night, and prolonged pressure led to Roger Johnson's 79th-minute headed goal which tied the scores overall. With the last play of normal time, Gardner's shot was touched onto the post by Robert Green, and the game went into extra time. Four minutes later, Gardner repeated the shot with enough power and accuracy to beat Green and give Birmingham the 4-3 aggregate lead which took them into the final.|$|R
