500|$|The direct {{impetus for}} the lyrics was an {{encounter}} with IRA supporters in New York City. As a promotional gimmick, U2 manager Paul McGuinness had made arrangements for the band {{to appear in the}} 1982 St. Patrick's Day parade. However, he later found that there was a possibility that Bobby Sands, an IRA hunger striker who had starved to death the previous year, would be the parade's honorary marshal. As they felt that the IRA's tactics were prolonging the fighting in Northern Ireland, McGuinness and the band members mutually decided they should withdraw from the parade. McGuinness met with one of the parade's organizers in a New York bar to arrange the cancellation, and ended up in a heated debate about the IRA. McGuinness recalled, [...] "He kept telling me to keep my voice down. The place was full of New York policemen - Irish cops - and he thought I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>us</b> killed." ...|$|E

2500|$|Compton was {{evacuated}} {{for severe}} trench foot; Stephen E. Ambrose concluded that Compton witnessing the carnage involving {{two of his}} closest friends, Joe Toye and William Guarnere [...] "unnerved" [...] him. Compton wrote in his autobiography, [...] "...although I was affected by the horrors of Bastogne, I do not believe I was clinically shell shocked, as the series portrays me.

500|$|Even {{though the}} episode aired during the {{beginning}} of the fifth season, it was produced by the crew of the fourth season. A large part of the original crew left the show after season four. This led to the addition of several scenes, which normally would not have been considered, because the mentality of the departing crew was [...] "what are they <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do, <b>get</b> <b>us</b> fired?" [...] Although most of the episode was completed by the staff of season four, the end was rewritten by the team of season five.|$|R
6000|$|... “They are Moors, certainly,” {{the captain}} said to the first {{lieutenant}} after examining them with his glass. “What would I not give for a breath of wind now?

Prior {{to the release of}} the official music video, an unauthorized release of the unfinish music video surfaced on the internet. During the aforementioned interview, Ice Prince shed light on the situation. He said: [...] "It was a very terrible situation for me. I was very depressed that period. The first cut that my director submitted leaked out. When he submitted it, I didn't like it and my record label didn't like it so we sent it back to him and asked him to redo it and which he did. What happen was, because we're all scattered, he sent us the link. He sent it on a private link and we got it and watched it. Unfortunately for us, someone got their hands on the private link.

We've not sorted it out up to now but it just went out like that. It was very very depressing." ...|$|R

It warn't quite midnight yet, so we cleared {{out for the}} mill, leaving Jim at work. We smouched the grindstone, {{and set out to}} roll her home, but it was a most nation tough job. Sometimes, do what we could, we couldn't keep her from falling over, and she come mighty near mashing us every time. Tom said she was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> one of <b>us,</b> sure, before we got through. We got her half way; and then we was plumb played out, and most drownded with sweat. We see it warn't no use; we got to go and fetch Jim. So he raised up his bed and slid the chain off of the bed-leg, and wrapt it round and round his neck, and we crawled out through our hole and down there, and Jim and me laid into that grindstone and walked her along like nothing; and Tom superintended. He could out-superintend any boy I ever see. He knowed how to do everything.|$|R

6000|$|... "There are {{precautions}} I mean to take," [...] Harding {{informed him}} dryly. [...] "However, I haven't {{come here to}} argue.

You expected us to be held up there until our provisions ran out and winter set in, when these Stonies would no doubt have moved on. Well, {{part of what you}} wished has happened; but the matter is taking a turn you couldn't have looked for. You led us into difficulties--and now you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>us</b> out. I guess delay means danger. Get ready to start." ...|$|E
5000|$|In July 1997, Jeremić co-founded {{and became}} the {{financial}} manager of the Organization of Serbian Students Abroad (OSSA), the first international Serbian student association, {{which at the time}} had several thousand members. He was an active supporter of Otpor! ("Resistance!"), the Serbian civic youth movement that employed non-violent civil disobedience tactics against Milošević's government in the hope of spurning democratic reforms. He became even more determined to see Milošević toppled during and after NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia {{in the spring and summer}} of 1999. [...] "This guy ... Milošević," [...] Jeremić recalled thinking, [...] "he has to be removed, because he’s <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>us</b> all buried.

Kennedy Presidential Library (that was withheld from the public until 2009), McHugh provided detailed statements that once Kennedy's body was back on board Air Force One {{he did not know}} that Lyndon Johnson was also on board. Due to safety concerns that there was a conspiracy, Jacqueline Kennedy's repeated requests, {{and the fact that the}} plane's interior cabin was quite warm, McHugh had requested that the plane take off. When the plane still had not taken off, McHugh went forward to again ask pilot James Swindal why the plane had not taken off and he was told that Johnson did not want the plane to take off yet. McHugh went to find Johnson and he soon found Johnson hiding in a bathroom with Johnson saying repeatedly, [...] "They're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>us</b> all. It's a plot. It's a plot.

5000|$|However, Germany remains {{opposed to}} debt {{that would be}} jointly issued and underwritten by all 17 members of the {{currency}} bloc, saying it could substantially raise the country's liabilities in the debt crisis. Barroso maintained that Germany did not oppose joint issuance in principle, but questioned the timing of it. Austria, Bulgaria, Finland and the Netherlands have also raised objections over eurobond issuance.
