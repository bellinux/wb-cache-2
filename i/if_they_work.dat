25|$|Outdoor {{workers are}} at risk of Lyme disease <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>work</b> at sites with {{infected}} ticks. In 2010, the highest number of confirmed Lyme disease cases were reported from New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Minnesota, Maryland, Virginia, New Hampshire, Delaware, and Maine. U.S. workers in the northeastern and north-central States are at highest risk of exposure to infected ticks. Ticks may also transmit other tick-borne diseases to workers in these and other regions of the country. Worksites with woods, bushes, high grass, or leaf litter are likely to have more ticks. Outdoor workers should be extra careful to protect themselves in the late spring and summer when young ticks are most active.|$|E
25|$|Since Hungary's 2004 {{accession}} to the European Union (EU), visa restrictions for Hungarian citizens were further relaxed. Hungarians can now not only travel visa-free to any member {{state of the}} EU, but also {{have a right to}} settle there. A valid passport or identity card is sufficient for any stay shorter than three months. For periods longer than three months, a residence permit is needed. Hungarians are allowed to settle in any EU country for more than three months <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>work</b> or study there, or if they are financially self-sufficient. By virtue of the agreement on the European Economic Area (EEA), those rights also apply to Hungarians in Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein. The same rights also extend to Hungarians in Switzerland {{as a result of the}} Agreement on the Free Movement of Persons. Following the {{accession to}} the European Union in 2004 and the Schengen Area in 2007, visa requirements were also lifted by several other countries including Georgia (2005), Bosnia and Herzegovina (2005), Macedonia (2005), Colombia (2005), Moldova (2007), Botswana (2008), Taiwan (2008), Australia (2008), and Thailand (2011).|$|E

2500|$|The second {{match of}} the night {{featured}} no active storylines between the members of each team, although tecnico Dr. Wagner Jr. and rudo L.A. Park had a long running on-again-off-again storyline that actually continued for years after the Sin Pidad event. Dr. Wagner Jr. would team up with Dos Caras Jr. and Rey Bucanero to take on L.A. Park and Los Guerreros del Infierno representatives Eclipse and Olímpico in a traditional Six-man [...] "Lucha Libre rules" [...] tag team match. The driving storyline behind the second match centered around the CMLL World Women's Championship that had seen champion Hiroka wart off challenger Dark Angel's advances several times {{over the last couple}} of months. Curiously the match did not include Lady Apache who had already been announced as challenging for the title only 10 days after Sin Piedad. The rudo champion Hiroka would team up with La Amapola and the masked Princesa Sujei to take on Dark Angel, Marcela, and Sahori in the second match {{of the night}}. The opening match of the show featured the Arena México debut of Flash as he teamed up with fellow tecnico and Super Nova to face the tag team of Artillero and Súper Comando, collectively known as Los Hombres del Camoflaje ("Men in Camouflage). For CMLL wrestlers working in Arena Mexico means that they are working on at the highest level of CMLL, especially <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>work</b> on Friday nights, where CMLL holds their most important shows CMLL Super Viernes or their major annual shows. The Sin Piedad show would be Flash's first opportunity to showcase his wrestling skills in front of CMLL's [...] "hometown crowd".|$|E

60|$|After church we wandered {{about the}} estate to see huge trees. One Ceiba, left {{standing}} in a cane-piece, was very grand, from the multitude and mass of its parasites and its huge tresses of lianes; and grand also from its form. The prickly board-wall spurs were at least fifteen feet high, some of them, where they entered the trunk; and at {{the summit of the}} trunk, which could not have been less than seventy or eighty feet, one enormous limb (itself a tree) stuck out quite horizontally, and gave a marvellous notion of strength. It seemed as if its length must have snapped it off, years since, where it joined the trunk; or as if the leverage of its weight must have toppled the whole tree over. But the great vegetable had known its own business best, and had built itself up right cannily; and stood, and will stand for many a year, perhaps for many a century, if the Matapalos do not squeeze out its life. I found, by the by, in groping my way to that tree through canes twelve feet high, that one must be careful, at least with some varieties of cane, not to get cut. The leaf-edges are finely serrated; and more, the sheaths of the leaves are covered with prickly hairs, which give the Coolies sore shins <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>work</b> bare-legged. The soil here, as everywhere, was exceedingly rich, and sawn out into rolling mounds and steep gullies--sometimes almost too steep for cane-cultivation--by the tropic rains. If, as cannot be doubted, denudation by rain has gone on here, for thousands of years, at the same pace at which it goes on now, the amount of soil removed must be very great; so great, that the Naparimas may have been, when they were first uplifted out of the Gulf, hundreds of feet higher than they are now.|$|E
50|$|The 1881 Occupational Statistics {{show that}} a {{majority}} of male workers worked in the agricultural sector, while women (<b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>worked)</b> worked more in domestic service. The amount of people who were in professional and governmental occupations was minimal due to Gayton's rural location, and many women were unaccounted for, these most likely being housewives. Compared to the 1831 statistics, the overall pattern of employment was roughly the same as in 1831, however, the inclusion of women into the statistics gives a more complete view of the employment patterns of the nineteenth century in rural communities.|$|R

6000|$|The sort of Englishmen, {{of whose}} respect Americans can make surest are those English thick-and-thin patriots who admire force and strength, {{and believe that}} it is the Anglo-Saxon mission to possess the earth, and to profit by its weaker peoples, not cruelly, not unkindly, yet unquestionably. The Englishmen of whose disrespect we can make surest are those who expect to achieve liberty, equality, and {{fraternity}} in the economic way, the political way having failed; who do not care whether the head of the state is born or elected, is called [...] "King" [...] or called [...] "President," [...] since he will presently not be at all; who abhor war, and believe that the meek shall inherit the earth, and these only <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>work</b> for a living. They have already had their will with the existing English state, until now that state is far more the servant of the people in fetching and carrying, in guarding them from hard masters and succoring them in their need, than the republic which professes to derive its just powers from the consent of the governed. When one encounters this sort of Englishman, one thinks silently of the child labor in the South, of the monopolies in the North, of the companies which govern while they serve us, and one hopes that the Englishman is not silently thinking of them too. He is probably of the lower classes, and one consoles one's self as one can by holding one's head higher in better company, where, without secret self- contempt, one can be more openly proud of our increasing fortunes and our increasing territory, and our warlike adequacy to a first position among the nations of the world. There is no fear that in such company one's national susceptibilities will be wounded, or that one will not be almost as much admired for one's money as at home. I do not say quite, because there are still things in England even more admired than money. Certainly a very rich American would be considered in such English society, but certainly he would not be so much considered as an equally rich Englishman who was also a duke.|$|E
