5000|$|He calls {{people to}} listen to him and {{explains}} that [...] "Nothing outside a man can make him 'unclean' by going into him. Rather, it is what comes out of a man that makes him 'unclean.'" [...] (15) Later his disciples (students) tell him they didn't understand him and he scolds them for being [...] "dull". He explains to them that food can't make you unclean but [...] "What comes out of a man is what makes him 'unclean.' For from within, out of men's hearts, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, greed, malice, deceit, lewdness, envy, slander, arrogance and folly. All these evils come from inside and make a man 'unclean.'" [...] (20-23) meaning intention of the [...] "heart" [...] is more important than ritual. What <b>foods</b> <b>you</b> eat will not matter to God. According to Kilgallen, [...] "...ultimately what is at stake here is knowledge of the divine will: Who knows best what God wants human beings to do." [...] (135) This view is contrasted to the controversy, such as at the Council of Jerusalem, within the Early Church over just how much Mosaic law one must obey. Mark uses this story as evidence for his view in the Pauline direction, making scholars question {{how much of it is}} actually Jesus' own teaching and how much of it is Mark trying to win Gentile converts. If the author really is Saint Mark then this would indicate that his group, Peter's circle, had come around in the Pauline direction.|$|E

Fu poetry is often viewed as a descendant of the Verses of Chu (also known as the Chu Ci or Ch'ü Tz'u) songs combined with the rhetorical expositions of the Intrigues of the Warring States. The Chu Ci is an anthology of Chinese poetry traditionally attributed mainly to Qu Yuan and Song Yu from the Warring States period (ended 221 BC), though about half of the poems seem to have been composed several centuries later, during the Han Dynasty.
