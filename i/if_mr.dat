5|$|The {{episode was}} written by George Meyer and {{directed}} by David Silverman. Executive producer Sam Simon and writers Al Jean and Mike Reiss {{came up with the}} idea for the episode. A co-worker had recently needed a blood transfusion and the writers thought it would be funny <b>if</b> <b>Mr.</b> Burns had one. Although Meyer was credited with writing the episode, Jean and Reiss re-wrote and polished the script. The episode includes the debut of the Olmec head Xtapolapocetl, which would become a common background prop in the Simpson home.|$|E
5|$|In late 1809, while {{mourning}} {{the death of}} his 17-year-old fiancée Matilda Hoffman, Irving completed work on his first major book, A History of New-York from the Beginning of the World to the End of the Dutch Dynasty, by Diedrich Knickerbocker (1809), a satire on self-important local history and contemporary politics. Prior to its publication, Irving started a hoax akin to today's viral marketing campaigns; he placed a series of missing person advertisements in New York newspapers seeking information on Diedrich Knickerbocker, a crusty Dutch historian who had allegedly gone missing from his hotel in New York City. As part of the ruse, Irving placed a notice—allegedly from the hotel's proprietor—informing readers that <b>if</b> <b>Mr.</b> Knickerbocker failed to return to the hotel to pay his bill, he would publish a manuscript Knickerbocker had left behind.|$|E
25|$|Both Mr. and Mrs. Crawford were {{questioned}} by police {{after receiving a}} Miranda warning. Mr. Crawford said to the police {{that he was not}} sure <b>if</b> <b>Mr.</b> Lee had a weapon, but that Crawford believed at the time that Lee did. Mrs. Crawford, being interrogated separately, at first said that she had not seen the attack, but under further questioning said that she had seen the attack and that Lee was not holding a weapon.|$|E

On April 26, 1983, she received a response from Andropov: ...|$|E
500|$|Priestley {{contended that}} Walpole had {{fulfilled}} his early potential, unlike Compton Mackenzie, Gilbert Cannan and other promising young novelists of his generation. This view was not universal among critics: Walpole sometimes divided opinion. Writing of Walpole's Russian novels the contemporary critic and novelist Douglas Goldring commented, [...] "Russia {{has been the}} grave of many reputations; and our Napoleon of the drawing-room novel has fared no better than other would-be conquerors of that disconcerting land." [...] Goldring's complaint was that Walpole's Russian (and English) characters were clichéd stereotypes. The reviewer in Punch, by contrast, wrote, [...] "I consulted a Russian, who is very much alive, and received the opinion that, <b>if</b> <b>Mr.</b> Walpole has not succeeded in drawing the real average Russian, he {{has given us a}} type whose faults and virtues sound the keynote of the situation as it is to-day." [...] The Observer rated The Dark Forest as [...] "one of the finest novels of our generation".|$|E
500|$|Vincent Canby of The New York Times {{praised the}} film's fictionalization of history, writing in his review, [...] "The film doesn't {{pretend to be}} about the civil-rights workers themselves. It's almost as <b>if</b> <b>Mr.</b> Parker and Mr. Gerolmo {{respected}} the victims, their ideals and their fate too much to reinvent them through the use of fiction." [...] In his review for the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert surmised, [...] "We knew the outcome of this case when we walked into the theater. What we may have forgotten, or never known, is exactly what kinds of currents were in the air in 1964." [...] On the syndicated television program Siskel and Ebert and the Movies, Ebert and his colleague Gene Siskel gave the film a [...] "two thumbs up" [...] rating. Siskel, writing for the Chicago Tribune, praised Hackman and Dafoe's [...] "subtle" [...] performances but felt that McDormand was [...] "most effective as the film's moral conscience".|$|E

500|$|After {{securing}} the Republican nomination in 1980, Ronald Reagan considered his former rival Ford {{as a potential}} vice-presidential runningmate, but negotiations between the Reagan and Ford camps at the Republican National Convention were unsuccessful. Ford conditioned his acceptance on Reagan's agreement to an unprecedented [...] "co-presidency", giving Ford the power to control key executive branch appointments (such as Kissinger as Secretary of State and Alan Greenspan as Treasury Secretary). After rejecting these terms, Reagan offered the vice-presidential nomination instead to George H. W. Bush. Ford did appear in a campaign commercial for the Reagan-Bush ticket, in which he declared that {{the country would be}} [...] "better served by a Reagan presidency rather than a continuation of the weak and politically expedient policies of Jimmy Carter". On October 8, 1980, Ford said President Nixon's involvement in the general election potentially could negatively impact the Reagan campaign: [...] "I {{think it would have been}} much more helpful <b>if</b> <b>Mr.</b> Nixon had stayed in the background during this campaign. It would have been much more beneficial to Ronald Reagan." ...|$|E
500|$|The band {{promoted}} the album by playing unannounced concerts in Detroit and Chicago, as radio stations received a strong amount of requests for the album's first single, [...] "Nookie". Significant Other climbed to No.1 on the Billboard 200, selling 643,874 copies {{in its first}} week of release. In its second week of release, the album sold an additional 335,000 copies. On the opening night of the band's Limptropolis tour with Kid Rock, Sam Rivers smashed his bass in frustration over the venue's poor sound, cutting his hand. After his hand was stitched up at a hospital, Rivers returned to finish the set. On July 12, Durst allegedly kicked a security guard in the head during a performance in St. Paul, Minnesota, and was later arrested on assault charges. Further criticisms of the band appeared in Rolling Stone and The New York Times. New York Times writer Ann Powers wrote, [...] "DJ Lethal used his turntables as a metal guitar, riffing expansively and going for effects instead of rhythm. John Otto on drums and Sam Rivers on bass never even tried to get funky, instead steering hip-hop's break-beat-based structure into a backbone for power chords. This makes for a hybrid {{that would be more}} interesting if the band did not constantly mire itself in boring tempos, and <b>if</b> <b>Mr.</b> Durst had any talent as a singer".|$|E
500|$|... "Blood Feud" [...] {{was written}} by George Meyer and {{directed}} by David Silverman. Executive producer Sam Simon and writers Al Jean and Mike Reiss {{came up with the}} idea for the episode while they were trying to fill up the rest of the production run. A co-worker had recently needed a blood transfusion, and the writers thought it would be funny <b>if</b> <b>Mr.</b> Burns had one. Although Meyer was credited with writing the episode, Jean and Reiss re-wrote and polished the script. Harry Shearer, the voice of Mr. Burns and Smithers, could not attend the table read for the episode, so his parts were read by Dan Castellaneta (the voice of Homer). [...] "Blood Feud" [...] includes a first act that is much longer than a normal episode of the show. The producers were going to end the act with Mr. Burns feeling better, but decided to extend it to show how the Simpson family was affected. [...] "Blood Feud" [...] ends with the family discussing what the message of the episode was, but decide that there was no message. The writers were having trouble conceiving an ending, but decided that since there was no point, they would discuss it. In his book Planet Simpson, Chris Turner writes that the ending is meant to openly mock the [...] "notion of the tidy sitcom-style moral" [...] and the [...] "formulaic plots of sitcoms".|$|E

500|$|The Simpsons writer Mike Reiss {{said on the}} episode's DVD audio {{commentary}} {{that while}} the episode was [...] "full of funny moments", it caused [...] "nothing but trouble" [...] to {{the staff of the}} show. One of the troubles was that after the episode had been written by Swartzwelder, an unsolicited writer sent the staff a script which contained a virtually identical story. To avoid a lawsuit, the staff paid him US$3000 and went forward with the episode. Material cut from the episode's script included many couples who were supposed to be at the retreat instead of the Flanders family, such as Mr. Burns and his mail-order bride, and Mrs. Krabappel trying to reunite with her estranged husband Ken Krabappel. Reiss said the scene played out [...] "horribly badly", and it appeared as <b>if</b> <b>Mr.</b> Burns's mail-order bride was a prostitute. The Ken Krabappel character was supposed to be based on singer Dean Martin, but somehow he ended up with a southern accent that made him sound like a hick. The whole scene was rewritten with help from producer James L. Brooks and it was completed after several hours. A scene in which Moe asked Dr. Hibbert to cure his discolored feces was also removed during the first reading of the script after a complaint by Brooks. Series creator Matt Groening later expressed an objection to the ending, which sees General Sherman jumping {{out of the water and}} winking at the camera, believing it to be overly cartoony.|$|E

2500|$|A major {{impetus to}} Deming's {{transfer}} was evidently the dissatisfaction of Robert L. Stephenson, an OU alumnus and major donor. On November 4, 2003, an attorney representing Stephenson wrote to University of Oklahoma provost Nancy Mergler, complaining that Deming was [...] "pursuing academic and personal interests outside of and not {{supportive of the}} School's mission." [...] The letter warned that <b>if</b> <b>Mr.</b> Stephenson's concerns were not addressed, [...] "his efforts and donations {{on behalf of the}} School will not continue." ...|$|E

The world will say, 'Parnell is beaten. Ireland has no longer a leader.'" [...] Biggar split with Parnell over this, declaring [...] "Mr. Chairman, all I have to say is, I can't agree with what you state, and <b>if</b> <b>Mr.</b> Lynch [...] goes to the poll I'll support him!".|$|E
2500|$|Shaw {{represented}} {{the new school}} of thought, modernism, which was rising at the time. Chesterton's views, on the other hand, became increasingly more focused towards the Church. In Orthodoxy he writes: [...] "The worship of will is the negation of will … <b>If</b> <b>Mr.</b> Bernard Shaw comes {{up to me and}} says, 'Will something', that is tantamount to saying, 'I do not mind what you will', and that is tantamount to saying, 'I have no will in the matter.' You cannot admire will in general, because the essence of will is that it is particular." ...|$|E
2500|$|Albert Gleizes, Jean Metzinger, Duchamp-Villon, and Jacques Villon are {{currently}} exhibiting at the Der Sturm gallery in Berlin. Jean Metzinger represents an extremely sophisticated art. He completes to perfection what he paints—not satisfying himself by drawing, he states. <b>If</b> <b>Mr.</b> Ingres, {{in spite of}} his considerable reputation, did not have somewhat restrained press, I would say he has the Japanese qualities of Ingresque painting. Fumeur, Tête de Femme, Marine, Nuit, Paysage, La Liseuse, and En Canot, which is with Fumeur cited above and said to be a portrait of myself, his masterpiece, this is what connoisseurs of the Spree will fight over with perseverance.

2500|$|In {{the latter}} half of the twentieth-century Gladstone's {{economic}} policies came to be admired by Thatcherite Conservatives. Margaret Thatcher proclaimed in 1983: [...] "We have a duty to make sure that every penny piece we raise in taxation is spent wisely and well. For it is our party which is dedicated to good housekeeping—indeed, I would not mind betting that <b>if</b> <b>Mr</b> Gladstone were alive today he would apply to join the Conservative Party". In 1996, she said: [...] "The kind of Conservatism which he and I...favoured would be best described as 'liberal', in the old-fashioned sense. And I mean the liberalism of Mr Gladstone, not of the latter-day collectivists". Nigel Lawson, one of Thatcher's Chancellors, believed Gladstone to be the [...] "greatest Chancellor of all time".|$|E

The charges were later dropped when his now ex-wife did not appear in court.

Mr. Bannon’s lawyer, she said, [...] "threatened me," [...] telling her that <b>if</b> <b>Mr.</b> Bannon went to jail, she [...] "would have no money and no way to support the children." ...
