40|$|AbstractElectro-hydrostatic {{actuator}} (EHA) was {{a typical}} power-by-wire (PBW) actuator, which was widely-used in large commercial aircrafts, such as Airbus A 380. The electro-hydrostatic actuator(EHA) had the advantages of small sizes, light weight, high power density, high reliability and maintainability. With the application of EHA in large commercial airplanes, the airworthiness certification of EHA became an new problem. The precondition of the airworthiness certification of EHA was to understand its operating principle and characteristic. Because of no centralized hydraulic oil tank and short cycle oil circuit, the temperature-rise of the hydraulic system in EHA always kept high during operation. Therefore, {{it was important to}} build the thermal-hydraulic models of the hydraulic system in EHA, and to do the thermal analysis of the EHA by this model. In this paper, a lumped-parameter thermal-hydraulic model of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>part</b> in EHA was proposed. The model was built based on the detailed analysis of the heat transfer of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>part</b> in EHA. By the simulation of a practical system and the comparison with the traditional hydraulic system, the accuracy and practicality of this model was verified...|$|R
40|$|Damage {{induced by}} {{microcracking}} affects {{not only the}} mechanical behaviour of geomaterials but also their hydraulic properties. Evaluating these impacts is important for many engineering applications, such as the safety assessment of radioactive waste disposal facilities. This paper presents a new constitutive model accounting simultaneously {{for the impact of}} damage on hydraulic and mechanical properties of unsaturated poroplastic geomaterials. The hydro-mechanical coupling is formulated by means of the thermodynamic framework for partially saturated media, extended by taking into account isotropic damage and plasticity. State and complementary laws are governed by the so-called plastic effective stress and equivalent pore pressure. Assuming a bimodal pore size distribution for cracked porous media, the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>part</b> (water retention curve and hydraulic conductivity) is modelled using phenomenological functions of damage variable. The participation of damage on both mechanical and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>part</b> enables this model to describe bilateral couplings between them. This coupled model is then validated against a number of experimental data obtained from Callovo-Oxfordian argillite, which is the possible host rock for a radioactive waste disposal in France. Parametric studies are also carried out to check the consistency and to better demonstrate the bilateral couplings in the model...|$|R

50|$|A chopper pump is {{operated}} by a drive unit (e.g. electric motor, hydraulic motor, PTO), which turns the impeller and the cutting system. An open impeller design is used to successfully pass the macerated solids or thick slurry. A set of hardened steel cutters is installed externally to the pump suction in order to macerate all solids prior to entering the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>parts</b> of the pump. A chopper pump {{should not be confused}} with a grinder pump, which uses its impeller as part of the cutting mechanism. Grinder pumps are typically used for light weight sewage applications, whereas chopper pumps are used for tough solids handling applications. The chopping system consists of a set of rotating cutters that are keyed to the shaft and work in conjunction with the stationary cutters, which are bolted to the suction plate. A system of mechanical seals are used to prevent the pumped liquid from entering the motor. The pump can either be connected to a pipe, flexible hose or lowered down a guide rail so that the pump sits on a coupling foot (aka base elbow), thereby connecting it to the discharge pipe.|$|E

30|$|The <b>hydraulic</b> <b>part</b> of {{the test}} {{consists}} in injecting the fluid at a prescribed flow rate with a chromatography pump, which also measures the injection pressure. Once the fluid has percolated through the fracture, it is recovered in an annular reservoir surrounding the rock sample. With the containment cell being pressurised (0.1  MPa), each time the solenoid valves located outside the chamber (at atmospheric pressure) are opened, the pressure difference flushes the fluid from the annular reservoir via capillaries (with a diameter of 1 / 16 th of an inch) to the systems for measuring the physicochemical changes in the fluid, for collecting samples and for monitoring the outflow. The last, which is done by weighing the fluid, enables one to verify, for an imposed injection rate, {{that there is no}} fluid loss in the circuit whether through leakage or excessive evaporation. To limit evaporation, the nitrogen used for pressurising the cell is water saturated through bubbling.|$|R
