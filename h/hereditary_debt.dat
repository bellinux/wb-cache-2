60|$|This second {{surprise}} {{had been}} accomplished for Jeanie Deans by the rod {{of the same}} benevolent enchanter, whose power had transplanted her father from the Crags of St. Leonard's to {{the banks of the}} Gare Loch. The Duke of Argyle was not a person to forget the <b>hereditary</b> <b>debt</b> of gratitude, which had been bequeathed to him by his grandfather, in favour of the grandson of old Bible Butler. He had internally resolved to provide for Reuben Butler in this kirk of Knocktarlitie, of which the incumbent had just departed this life. Accordingly, his agent received the necessary instructions for that purpose, under the qualifying condition always, that the learning and character of Mr. Butler should be found proper for the charge. Upon inquiry, these were found as highly satisfactory as had been reported in the case of David Deans himself.|$|E

Sometimes I dare to hope that the Divine Mercy of Christ--which once pleaded on earth for a woman like me--may plead, when death has taken me, for my spirit in Heaven.

5000|$|A {{study by}} S.K. Datta and J.B. Nugent {{argued that the}} pearl diving reforms were [...] "counter-productive" [...] and [...] "contributed {{to the demise of}} the {{pearling}} industry". The basis of this conclusion is that removal of <b>hereditary</b> <b>debts</b> raised the cost of [...] "recruitment of labour" [...] and [...] "granting of loans", and that giving equal loans to divers regardless of their skill reduced the competition between them. Mahdi Al-Tajir stated that the aforementioned analysis was exaggerated, despite containing some [...] "measure of truth" [...] in it. He added that the real causes behind the demise of pearling were not the regulations against abuse, but were the Great Depression of the 1930s, introduction of Japanese cultured pearls and the discovery of oil in Bahrain. Littlefield gave the same 3 reasons to explain the demise of the pearl industry. Hussain Esmail wrote that while Daly {{was one of the worst}} Political Agents in Bahrain's history, the reforms he introduced into pearl diving were one of his few good deeds.|$|R
5000|$|The holiday was {{announced}} {{to mark the}} 50th anniversary {{of the beginning of}} [...] "democratic reform" [...] of the Tibetan feudal theocratic social structure on March 28, 1959, where according to China, one million people were freed from serfdom. The People's Republic of China had been established since 1949, and has had control over Tibet since 1951. Mao Zedong had entered into negotiations with the 14th Dalai Lama to initiate land reform, but was told in 1957 that any reforms would have to be approved by the Tibetan nobility. Mao was surprised by the 1959 Tibetan uprising, which Chinese historians call an attempt by feudal lords to continue the system forever, but the Dalai Lama calls a [...] "national uprising". In retrospect, the Dalai Lama also prefers the term [...] "poor people" [...] for Tibetans, for which he says the designation [...] "serf" [...] is questionable. He also alleges that the Government of Tibet had drawn up plans to gradually lower <b>hereditary</b> <b>debts,</b> but that the central government was hesitant, preferring to do things their own way.|$|R
40|$|The {{doctoral}} thesis concerns the debt and liability of the legatee. The theme {{of interest is}} the succesional law. In Italian civil law succession may be legal or testamentary. The testator may establish an heir, which became sole heir or legatee. The general rule is that only the heir is liable for debts of the deceased; the legatee does not. The legate is responsible, if the testator has him imposed the payment of a debt. But the legatee responds {{within the limits of}} what was received (intra vires liability). Equally, if the good received is encumbered by mortgages and the legatee suffers enforcement. In any case, as a general rule, the creditor must apply to the heir, not to legatee (which has not any passive legitimation for the debts of the deceased). However, there are cases where the legatee should return the good received, when the heritage is insufficient to satisfy hereditary creditors (for example, separation of assets, acceptance with the benefit of inventory). Thus hereditary creditors may proceed by way of recourse against the legatee, although he didn’t have a debt. You must then remeditate the general principle that a legatee is not responsible for any <b>hereditary</b> <b>debt,</b> because there are cases of liability without debt. In this regard can be very useful dating german theory of “liability without debt”. Today this theory is, at least in Italy, entirely in the minority. However the distinction of the two elements of the obligation (debt and liability) is useful to describe and justify the fortunes of the obligations and the final allocation of "duty". With regard to the legatee, his position in relation to the debts or weights of the heritage can be varied, because the landscape of possible obligations that the legatee may, exceptionally, suffer is heterogeneous. The hypothesis of "liability" of the legatee is divided into four areas: 1) 	obligations of the legatee (modus, sub-legacy, testamentary autonomy of imposition debts, charges on things uncumbered) : distinguishing between obligations of the legatee and succession of the legatee in debts, these weights are settled by the succession rules. In case of modus and sub-legacy the legatee does not pay any debt of the testator, or a debt (in technical sense) of the heritage. Finally in the case of art. 668 cod. civ. They are not debts or charges of the heritage, but weights of loads imposed on the object of good lefted. 2) 	distinction between be liable and suffer weights (reduction action, lifetime allowance in favour of unrecognizable natural son, separation of assets of the deceased, lying inheritance, acceptance with the benefit of inventory). In the case of separation of assets and b. i., then, the legatee has not any debt, but his position is comparable to that of a purchaser of an asset encumbered by a real mortgage. 3) 	Patrimonial warranty of legatee (mortgage action and discovery of testament). We keep the conceptual autonomy of these cases from mortgage, because the mortgage action is comparable to real constraint that is realized with separation of assets, but it is different, because the mortgage is a specific constraint causally linked to a particular credit. With the mortgage liability in near to an abstraction, but causally tied to that particular credit. The ancillary characteristic of mortgage draws attention to the configurability of a case of responsibility without debt. Even if {{you do not want to}} agree to that theory (today a minority, though not entirely abandoned), the legatee suffer a warranty, different and more specific than that seen in the second macro-area. With the action of recourse in the case of b. i., the legatee does not suffer any debt of the testator, but a weight equal to its legacy. 4) 	debt and liability determinate by other rules (legacy of firma, company, usufruct, succession in the condominium, in the lease and in cooperative societies). In these cases the source of debt and responsibility doesn’t lie in any succession rules, but in the rules of the statement in which the legatee takes over. Therefore, the position of the legatee can be varied and complex. However, with regard to the specific aspect of succession in hereditary debts general principles are effective and good. All thing considered, the summa divisio lies on the distinction between succession and other rules. ...|$|E
40|$|In the presupposition {{that the}} heir and the {{inheritance}} constitute two essential {{moments of the}} same succession outline, which is regarded in one case in the subjective prism {{and in the other}} end, in that objective, it is excluded that the inheritance could be considered a thing or a good and the same one is solved in a recapitulatory formula able to assemble all the subjective juridical situations in which the heir nds himself. With the evident consequence that each business (inter vivos or mortis causa) that it has with regard to the inheritance ends up by characterising itself, inevitably, as a deal for relationem, which transfers the de nition of his content to the external stocktaking activity. On the other hand, be- ing positioned in the perspective of the succession progress, the report is made clear between called and heir, or rather between the one who by law or under the will has the power of accepting the inheritance and the one who, exercised this power with the act or the fact of the acceptance, has really attained the juridical heir position. Juridical position principally characterised by the expansive virtue of the share and by the responsibility for the payment of the <b>hereditary</b> <b>debts</b> and weights...|$|R
50|$|In 1921 and 1922, {{during what}} Al-Hulaibi {{referred}} to as the Divers' Uprising, divers boycotted the tribal-biased salifa court and refused to pay debts to Nakhudas. The next year, salifa was suspended for investigation. It was found that some Nakhudas manipulated accounts to over-charge divers. The reforms began in 1924, when Nakhudas were required to keep a separate account book for each diver and a boat-licensing tax was introduced. The former change was aimed to protect divers' interests, while the latter provided large income to the state (~Rs. 50,000 in 1924). There were several other changes in favor of the divers such as preventing the Nakhudas from punishing divers on board the boat, preventing selling of pearls without the presence and consent of divers, and assigning a minimum wage for divers. Debts were no longer <b>hereditary,</b> but outstanding <b>debts</b> had to be paid.|$|R
