5|$|Amanita abrupta {{was first}} {{described}} by American mycologist Charles Horton Peck in 1897, {{based on a}} specimen <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> Auburn, Alabama. Because {{the remains of the}} volva are not present on the bulb in dried, mature, specimens, Peck thought that the species should be grouped with Amanita rubescens and A.spissa. Synonyms include binomials resulting from generic transfers by Jean-Edouard Gilbert to Lepidella in 1928, and to Aspidella in 1940. Both of these genera have since been subsumed into Amanita.|$|E

5|$|Hamilton aided in {{all areas}} of the army's development, and after Washington's death he was by default the Senior Officer of the United States Army from December 14, 1799, to June 15, 1800. The army was to guard against {{invasion}} from France. Adams, however, derailed all plans for war by opening negotiations with France. Adams had held it proper to retain the members of Washington's cabinet, except for cause; <b>he</b> <b>found,</b> <b>in</b> 1800 (after Washington's death), that they were obeying Hamilton rather than himself, and fired several of them.|$|E
5|$|It is an unseasonably hot Easter at church, {{and no one}} is {{interested}} in Reverend Lovejoy's sermons.

In 2014, a follow-up book, Far and Near: On Days like These, {{was published}} by ECW. It covers travels in North America and Europe.

The movie ends with the dancer and the blind man dancing away and disappear in the horizon.|$|E
5|$|The {{mushroom}} {{was first}} described as Agaricus galopus by Christian Hendrik Persoon in 1800, and later {{transferred to the}} genus Mycena by Paul Kummer in 1871. An Australian taxon formerly considered a variety, Mycena galopus var. mellea, was raised to species level and renamed M.thunderboltensis in 1998. The variety candida was described by Jakob Emanuel Lange in 1914 based on specimens <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> Denmark; variety nigra was named by Carleton Rea in 1922. Mycena galopoda is an orthographical variant spelling.|$|E

5|$|The {{species was}} first named Boletus puniceus by Harry D. Thiers in 1965, based on {{specimens}} <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> Napa County, California, on 23 November 1963. In 1975, Thiers {{changed the name}} to Boletus amygdalinus (a nomen nudum) as he discovered that the epithet had already been used for a different bolete found in Yunnan, China, published in 1948. The fungus was transferred to Suillellus in 2014 after molecular phylogenetics demonstrated that S.amygdalinus was in a lineage distinct from Boletus.|$|E
5|$|William Murrill in 1909 {{placed the}} {{species in the}} genus Suillellus, while Sanshi Imai {{transferred}} it to Tubiporus in 1968. Tubiporus has since been synonymized with Boletus. In 1945, Rolf Singer described a bolete <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> Florida; although he originally {{described it as a}} subspecies of B.frostii, he later considered the differences between the taxa significant enough to warrant publishing Boletus floridanus as a unique species. Following recent molecular studies that outlined a new phylogenetic framework for the Boletaceae, the bolete was transferred to the newly circumscribed genus Exsudoporus in 2014.|$|E
5|$|After {{performing}} {{in a number}} of heavy metal bands in high school, Townsend was discovered by a record label in 1993 and was asked to perform lead vocals on Steve Vai's album Sex & Religion. After recording and touring with Vai, Townsend was discouraged by what <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> the music industry, and vented his anger on the solo album Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing released under the pseudonym Strapping Young Lad. He soon assembled a band under the name, and released the critically acclaimed City in 1997. Since then, he has released three more studio albums with Strapping Young Lad, along with solo material released under his own independent record label, HevyDevy Records.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{wanting to}} contact {{his parents in}} the United States, Owumi {{was not able to}} access the Internet or use his phone for {{international}} calls. He was also without electricity and had little food or water. Al-Nasr team president Ahmed Elturki also told Owumi that the airport in Libya had been burned down by protesters and advised him to remain in his apartment. Trapped in Mutassim's apartment during conflict, Owumi was eventually forced to drink toilet water with tea bags, urinate in the bathtub, and defecate into plastic bags. He also ate cockroaches and worms <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> the flower pots. His poor living conditions caused his teeth to rot and his skin to discolor.|$|E
5|$|Negron, in a {{flashback}} tells of his war {{experiences as a}} young corporal of the segregated 92nd Infantry Division in Italy in 1944. A disastrous attack ensues on German positions across the Serchio River. An officer, Captain Nokes, calls down artillery on the 92nd's own position, refusing to believe their reports of how far they have advanced. Many American soldiers are killed, leaving Negron stranded {{on the wrong side}} of the river with three men: Staff Sergeant Aubrey Stamps, Sergeant Bishop Cummings, and Private Sam Train. Sam carries the Head of the Primavera that <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> Florence, which he believes to carry magical powers. Sam and Bishop rescue an Italian boy named Angelo from a collapsing building. While traveling through the mountains of Tuscany, the soldiers enter a small village, where they form a bond with the residents. Sam grows especially fond of Angelo, becoming the boy's father figure. One Italian villager, Renata, soon becomes entangled in a love triangle with Stamps and Bishop, which creates conflict.|$|E
