40|$|African {{elephants}} (Loxodonta africana) are ecosystem {{engineers in}} that they substantially alter the environment through their unique foraging and feeding habits. At high densities, elephants potentially have negative impacts on the environment, specifically to large trees. Because of this, recent increases of elephants in the Associated Private Nature Reserves (APNR) on the Western Boundary of Kruger National Park, South Africa have caused concern regarding the health of several species of tree. My objective {{was to assess the}} effectiveness of wrapping protective <b>wire</b> <b>netting</b> around the trunk of the tree in preventing and reducing bark stripping by elephants. 2, 668 trees, 1352 marula (Sclerocarya birrea), 857 knobthorn (Acacia Nigrescens), and 459 false marula (Lannea schweinfurti), were assessed for elephant impact in the APNR, 1387 (52 %) of which had previously been wrapped in protective <b>wire</b> <b>netting</b> (789, 548, and 50 respectively). For knobthorn and marula, <b>wire</b> <b>netting</b> significantly decreased the number of the trees that were bark stripped. For all trees, <b>wire</b> <b>netting</b> decreased the level of bark stripping especially for the highest impact levels. No trees wrapped with wire were ringbarked, compared to 23 unwired trees. In addition, <b>wire</b> <b>netting</b> had an effect on the distribution of damage for the highest impact class incurred regardless of type. A higher relative frequency of wired trees were found in lower impact categories compared to unwired trees. <b>Wire</b> <b>netting</b> is a low maintenance and ecologically valuable technique that alleviates bark stripping for some species.

Because of this, recent increases of elephants in the Associated Private Nature Reserves (APNR) on the western boundary of the Kruger National Park (KNP), South Africa, have caused concern regarding the survival of several tree species. Our objective {{was to assess the}} effectiveness of wrapping protective <b>wire</b> <b>netting</b> around the trunk of the tree for preventing and reducing bark stripping, branch breaking, and felling by elephants. We assessed 2668 trees – 1352 Sclerocarya birrea (marula), 857 Acacia nigrescens (knobthorn), and 459 Lannea schweinfurthii (false marula) – for elephant impact in the APNR, 1387 (52 %) of which had previously been wrapped in protective <b>wire</b> <b>netting</b> (789, 548 and 50, respectively). <b>Wire</b> <b>netting</b> was effective in reducing the severity of bark stripping and the relative proportion of trees that were bark stripped. In addition, <b>wire</b> <b>netting</b> had an effect on the level of impact, with a higher relative frequency of wire-net-protected trees found in lower impact categories compared with unprotected trees. Since tree mortality has been attributed to high levels of elephant impact, the use of <b>wire</b> <b>netting</b> could serve to maintain individual trees or populations particularly vulnerable to elephant impact in areas with locally high densities of elephants. Conservation implications: Since <b>wire</b> <b>netting</b> is a relatively low cost and ecologically unobtrusive strategy, it could be used to reduce elephant impact in problem areas. This method focuses on protecting trees rather than some other strategies such as environmental manipulation, translocation, contraceptives, and culling that instead focus on reducing elephant numbers.

Rabbits on the <b>wire</b> <b>net</b> floor had significantly higher liveweight at slaughter than rabbits on the combined floor (2575 vs. 2498 g).
