5000|$|Operation of weaving in {{a textile}} mill is {{undertaken}} by a specially trained operator {{known as a}} weaver. Weavers are expected to uphold high industry standards, and are tasked with monitoring anywhere from ten, {{to as many as}} thirty separate looms at any one time. During their operating shift, weavers will first utilize a wax pencil or crayon to sign their initials onto the cloth to mark a shift change, and then walk along the cloth side (front) of the looms they tend, gently touching the fabric as it comes from the reed. This is done to feel for any broken [...] "picks" [...] or <b>filler</b> <b>thread.</b> Should broken picks be detected, the weaver will disable the machine and undertake to correct the error, typically by replacing the bobbin of <b>filler</b> <b>thread</b> in as little time as possible. They are trained that, ideally, no machine should stop working for more than one minute, with faster turn around times being preferred.|$|E
5000|$|Thread {{seal tape}} (also known as PTFE tape or plumber's tape) is a {{polytetrafluoroethylene}} (PTFE) film {{for use in}} sealing pipe threads. The tape is sold cut to specific widths and wound on a spool, {{making it easy to}} wind around pipe threads. It is also known by the genericised trade-name Teflon tape; while Teflon is in fact identical to PTFE, Chemours (the trade-mark holders) consider this usage incorrect, especially as they no longer manufacture Teflon in tape form. Thread seal tape lubricates allowing for a deeper seating of the threads, and it helps prevent the threads from seizing when being unscrewed. The tape also works as a deformable <b>filler</b> and <b>thread</b> lubricant, helping to seal the joint without hardening or making it more difficult to tighten, and instead making it easier to tighten.|$|R
