25|$|Buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum), {{also known}} as common buckwheat, <b>Japanese</b> <b>buckwheat</b> and silverhull buckwheat, is a plant {{cultivated}} for its grain-like seeds and as a cover crop. A related and more bitter species, Fagopyrum tataricum, a domesticated food plant common in Asia, but not as common in Europe or North America is {{also referred to as}} buckwheat.|$|E
50|$|It is {{made from}} rather large yellow wheat noodle, with the size similar of <b>Japanese</b> <b>buckwheat</b> noodle.

40|$|Protein {{fractions}} were extracted by successive extraction {{and analysis}} method in four <b>buckwheat</b> varieties: including <b>Japanese</b> spring <b>buckwheat,</b> <b>Japanese</b> summer <b>buckwheat,</b> Yuqiao No. 1 and Yuqiao 6 - 21. The amino acid {{of the composition}} and the mineral content of each protein fraction were also analyzed in this paper. The basis for the data on the experiment was the relationships between protein fractions and amino acids, and the mineral contents of protein fractions, the distribution and proportion of amino acids and the minerals in each protein fraction in the buckwheat kernel, {{as well as the}} nutritional value of buckwheat kernels were discussed. The results showed that it has a high amount of soluble protein and a very low amount of prolamin in the buckwheat kernel. Leucine is the first limited amino acid in buckwheat, and buckwheat protein is only a semi-nutritional-protein. The buckwheat kernel is rich in K, Zn in albumin, Ca, Mg, Mn in globulin, Na in prolamin and glutein...|$|R
5000|$|Soba is {{also the}} <b>Japanese</b> word for <b>{{buckwheat}}.</b> Roasted buckwheat kernels may {{be made into a}} grain tea called sobacha, which may be served hot or cold. Buckwheat hulls, or sobakawa (also called sobagara), are used to fill pillows. Sometimes, beers are made with roasted buckwheat added as a flavoring, and called [...] "soba ale".|$|R
5000|$|Soba (そば or 蕎麦) ( [...] , [...] ) is the <b>Japanese</b> {{name for}} <b>{{buckwheat}}.</b> It usually refers to thin noodles made from buckwheat flour, {{or a combination}} of buckwheat and wheat flours (Nagano soba). They contrast to thick wheat noodles, called udon. In Japan, the word can refer to any thin noodle. Soba noodles are served either chilled with a dipping sauce, or in hot broth as a noodle soup.|$|R

40|$|The allelopatbic {{effect of}} {{buckwheat}} (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench) on lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) was investigated with water soluble extracts according to Ebana's method (EBANA ET AL 2001). Four cuhivars {{were used to}} establish the bioassay of allelopathic activity in buckwheat. Two times dilution liquid of the clued extraction liquid was effective in the assay of effect on allelopathic activity of buckwheat. Water soluble compounds, which were extracted from buckwheat leaves, were applied to lettuce seed. This extract inhibited the root growth of lettuce. A wide range of variation in allelopathic activity among 50 <b>Japanese</b> <b>buckwheat</b> cultivars was assessed using water soluble extracts from their leaves and lettuce as a test plants. The wide intra cultivar variations of allelopathic activity were investigated in each cultivar...|$|E
40|$|Radical-scavenging {{activity}} in the flour obtained from 32 cultivars of buckwheat grown and harvested in the Kyushu region of Japan was investigated by a method using 1,I-diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH). The radical-scavenging activity of DPPH in buckwheat flour extract by an 80 % ethanol solution varied {{in the range of}} 0. 497 to 1. 233 umol-Trolox equivalent/ml (1 ml equivalent to 100 mg of buckwheat flour), and the varietal difference was statistically sig-nificant (P<O. OI). <b>Japanese</b> <b>buckwheat</b> varieties showed radical-scavenging {{activity in}} the range of 0. 581 to 0. 922 umol-Trolox equivalent/ml. Among those tested, 2 varieties originating from Nepal possessed the highest radical-scavenging activity, suggesting that they would be suitable resources for breeding buckwheat with a high radical-scavenging activity. In addition, the radical-scavenging activity of DPPH in all varieties was correlated with total polyphenol content (r= 0. 975, P<O. Ol) ...|$|E
40|$|One {{hundred and}} seventy {{thousands}} ton of <b>Japanese</b> annual <b>buckwheat</b> production in 1895 was decreased rapidly to 20 thousand tons in 1967. It {{is known that}} good proportions of buckwheat had been produced by the technique of the slash-and-burn method of agriculture in Japan. The decrease had very much relationship {{with the death of}} the slash-and-burn method of agriculture. The Agricultural Census in 1950 shows that the gross area of arable land made by the slash-and-burn method was 9, 552. 94 hectares. The real area of arable land made by the slash-and-burn method is estimated more than 30 thousands hectares, because the recorded area in the Agricultural Census are concerned that third to tenth shorter than its real area, by SASAKI K. (1975) 3). Since around 1955, the technique of the slash-and-burn method declined and was very rare. Although arable land made by the method is very hard to seen in Japan, few person produced the buckwheat and other crops by the traditional slash-and-burn method, in the Shiiba village now. First of all, the author will introduce the outline of the traditional slash-and-burn method in Shiiba village 2), and will consider the traditional seed timing of buckwheat, as an example carried in 1994, to verify on the suitability of the slash-and-burn systems, next...|$|R
40|$|Although many {{previous}} studies reported that honey promotes wound healing, no study {{has examined the}} effects of Japanese honey. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effects of three types of <b>Japanese</b> honey, Acacia, <b>Buckwheat</b> flour, and Chinese milk vetch honey, on wound healing in comparison with hydrocolloid dressing. Circular full-thickness skin wounds were produced on male mice. Japanese honey or hydrocolloid dressing was applied daily to the mice for 14 days. The ratio of wound area for the hydrocolloid dressing group increased initially in the inflammatory and early proliferative phases and then decreased rapidly to heal with scarring. However, the ratios of wound area for the Japanese honey groups decreased in the inflammatory phase, increased in the proliferative phase, and decreased in the proliferative phase, and some wounds were not completely covered with new epithelium. These findings indicate that using Japanese honey alone has limited benefit, but since it reduces wound size in the inflammatory phase, it is possible to apply a combined treatment in which Japanese honey is applied only in the inflammatory phase, followed by hydrocolloid dressing from the proliferative phase, which would effectively contract the wound. © 2013 Yukari Nakajima et al...|$|R

40|$|Key words: anther culture, callus induction, cold {{pretreatment}} Three <b>Japanese</b> <b>buckwheat</b> cultivars 'Mogami-wase, Hashikami-wase and Kitawase-soba ' {{were used}} to study their ability in callus formation. Medium components, length of cold pretreatment and material size were also tested. Among these cultivars, 'Kitawase-soba ' showed higher ability to produce calli than the others did. The highest callus induction rate was 43. 3 % in 'Kitawase-soba '. In 'Mogami-wase and Kitawase-soba ', the highest callus induction rate was attained on B 5 basal medium with 2 % sucrose supplemented with 1. 0 mg/l NAA and 2. 0 mg/I BA. On the other hand, lower concentration of sucrose (I %) and plant hormones (0. 5 mg/I NAA and 1. 0 mg/l BA) was good for 'Hashikami-wase '. Cold pretreatment was conducted at 5 °C from 0 to 15 days and relatively long pretreatment promoted callus formation except in 'Hashikami-wase'. In 'Hashikami-wase', the reaction to cold pretreatment differed among indi-vidual plants so genetic background of each plant seemed to influence the ability of callus formation. As for the mate-rial size (the length of flower bud), I mm was better than 2 mm for callus induction. Some plantlets regenerated in 'Mogami-wase and Hashikami-wase ' under callus inducing condition, while rooting from calli sometimes occurred throughout the experiments. In one plantlet of 'Mogami-wase ', the amount of DNA of leaf cells showed three fifth ofthat of diploid control plants. Other plantlets showed almost the same value as that of control and {{were considered to be}} diploid...|$|E
