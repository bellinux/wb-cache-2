5000|$|The term {{separator}} in oilfield terminology designates {{a pressure}} vessel used for separating well fluids produced from {{oil and gas}} wells into gaseous and liquid components. A separator for petroleum production is a large vessel designed to separate production fluids into their constituent components of oil, gas and water. A separating vessel may be {{referred to in the}} following ways: Oil and gas separator, Separator, Stage separator, Trap, Knockout vessel (<b>Knockout</b> <b>drum,</b> knockout trap, water knockout, or liquid knockout), Flash chamber (flash vessel or flash trap), Expansion separator or expansion vessel, Scrubber (gas scrubber), Filter (gas filter). These separating vessels are normally used on a producing lease or platform near the wellhead, manifold, or tank battery to separate fluids produced from oil and gas wells into oil and gas or liquid and gas. An oil and gas separator generally includes the following essential components and features: ...|$|E
50|$|The Souders-Brown {{equation}} (named after Mott Souders and George Granger Brown) {{has been}} a tool for obtaining the maximum allowable vapor velocity in vapor-liquid separation vessels (variously called flash <b>drums,</b> <b>knockout</b> <b>drums,</b> <b>knockout</b> pots, compressor suction drums and compressor inlet drums). It has also been used for the same purpose in designing trayed fractionating columns, trayed absorption columns and other vapor-liquid-contacting columns.|$|R
40|$|In this study, we {{select the}} {{effective}} demulsifier for crude oil through analyzing the stability factors of polymer flooding Produced Fluids with {{high water content}} and carry out the field test research. The results demonstrate {{the stability of the}} crude oil emulsion enhanced with the increasing of polymer concentration, which resulting the increasing of the membrane strength of oil-water interface, the elastic shear modulus of oil-water interface decreased. The field tested results of the selected crude demulsifier DQ- 10 show that the average water rate in the oil dialed with the free water <b>knockout</b> <b>drums</b> is 5. 39 %, the water rate in exporting oil is less than 0. 3 % and the oil content in sewage is not more than 500 mg/L. The test results demonstrate that the prepared demulsifier can ensure the average water rate in oil and the oil content in sewage, which reveals that the demulsifier can be applied in the production of crude oil dehydration and be able to satisfy the demand of production. In that way, the annual expenses for crude oil demulsifier can be decreased by 260, 000 Yuan RMB...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe main {{objective}} of this field is to investigate various optimum field production strategies of the whole production system (from reservoir to separator) of Narsingdi Gas Field, Bangladesh using The Integrated Production Modeling, IPM suite (GAP, PROSPER, MBAL) software package by applying the trademarked methodology of Nodal Analysis. Recommending the best optimum production strategy on the context of recent gas crisis in the Bangladesh is {{the ultimate goal of}} this investigation. Individual modeling (Pressure and Temperature) of the wells in PROSPER by Nodal Analysis is a prime requirement of this work. Another important pre-requisites are to estimate the reserve of the field by Material Balance Method in MBAL, quality check with the recent volumetric reserve estimate, proper aquifer modeling and determine missing reservoir/aquifer parameters of the field. Based on this reserve estimation, various production forecasting and reservoir performance for existing and optimum conditions had been investigated after the whole production system of reservoir, wells, pipelines, chokes and separators in the GAP model. The reserve of the lower gas sand of this field is estimated to be 273. 838 BCF which fairly agrees with the recent volumetric estimate of 284 BCF. During the prediction run for various existing and optimum production strategies, it had been found that acceleration of production for existing conditions does not improve the gas recovery in a great deal, but when the wellhead backpressure is reduced by installing surface compressors and <b>knockout</b> <b>drum,</b> it definitely improves the gas recovery factor by 23 %. Finally, an optimum production strategy is recommended along with future installation of surface compressor and upgrading of gas processing capacity. </p...|$|E
40|$|In oil/gas and {{chemical}} industries, dynamics {{is one of}} the most essential characteristics of any process. Time-dependent response is involved in most steps of both the physical/engineering processes and the equipment performance. The conventional Quantitative Risk Assessment (QRA) is unable to address the time dependent effect in such dynamic processes. In this dissertation, a methodology of Dynamic Operational Risk Assessment (DORA) is developed for operational risk analysis in oil/gas {{and chemical}} industries. Given the assumption that the component performance state determines the value of parameters in process dynamics equations, the DORA probabilistic modeling integrates stochastic modeling and process dynamics modeling to evaluate operational risk. The stochastic system-state trajectory is modeled based on the abnormal behavior or failure of the components. For each of the possible system-state trajectories, a process dynamics evaluation is carried out to check whether process variables, e. g., level, flow rate, temperature, pressure, or chemical concentration, remain in their desirable regions. Monte Carlo simulations are performed to calculate the probability of process variable exceeding the safety boundaries. Component testing/inspection intervals and repair time are critical parameters to define the system-state configuration; and play an important role for evaluating the probability of operational failure. Sensitivity analysis is suggested to assist selecting the DORA probabilistic modeling inputs. In this study, probabilistic approach to characterize uncertainty associated with QRA is proposed to analyze data and experiment results in order to enhance the understanding of uncertainty and improve the accuracy of the risk estimation. Different scenarios on an oil/gas separation system were used to demonstrate the application of DORA method, and approaches are proposed for sensitivity and uncertainty analysis. Case study on a <b>knockout</b> <b>drum</b> in the distillation unit of a refinery process shows that the epistemic uncertainty associated with the risk estimation is reduced through Bayesian updating of the generic reliability information using plant specific real time testing or reliability data. Case study on an oil/gas separator component inspection interval optimization illustrates the cost benefit analysis in DORA framework and how DORA probabilistic modeling can be used as a tool for decision making. DORA not only provides a framework to evaluate the dynamic operational risk in oil/gas and chemical industries, but also guides the process design and optimization of the critical parameters such as component inspection intervals...|$|E
