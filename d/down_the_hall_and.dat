On the way to Willow's dorm she trips, turns around and sees The Gentlemen {{floating}} toward her. In Willow's dorm she frantically knocks on doors which no one will open; The Gentlemen steadily pursue her. Willow hears Tara's panicked knocking <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>and</b> exits her room as Tara sprints into her, sending them both tumbling. They lock themselves into a laundry room and try to barricade the door with a vending machine, but it is too heavy for them to move. Willow, injured, sits and concentrates on moving the machine with telekinesis; she fails, but Tara sees what she is doing. They clasp hands and the machine moves swiftly across the room, blocking the door.|$|E

Mathilda {{lives with her}} {{dysfunctional}} family in an apartment <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall,</b> <b>and</b> has stopped attending class at her school for troubled girls.

50|$|The {{second and}} third stories {{are said to have}} held 63 luxury {{sleeping}} rooms with baths <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>halls</b> <b>and</b> two large banks of skylights for lighting the inner rooms with natural light. It is also believed that all rooms were furnished with iron and brass beds and oak furnishings.|$|R
50|$|Crawford then charged <b>down</b> <b>the</b> lecture <b>hall</b> <b>and</b> out <b>the</b> door, symbolizing his {{exit from}} the gaming industry.|$|R

2500|$|In 1980 Hodgkinson formed The Work, a post-punk {{band with}} guitarist-composer Bill Gilonis, bassist Mick Hobbs and drummer Rick Wilson. At {{the same time}} Hodgkinson and Gilonis formed the {{independent}} record label, Woof Records. Over the next few years, The Work toured Europe. After performing at a Rock in Opposition festival in Bonn with vocalist Catherine Jauniaux in 1982, the band and Jauniaux recorded Slow Crimes (1982) for the Woof label. Later that year, with a slightly altered line-up of Hodgkinson, Gilonis, Amos and Chris Cutler, they performed in Japan. A concert in Osaka in June 1982 was recorded with a cassette recorder halfway <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>and</b> was later cleaned up and released on an LP Live in Japan (1982). After the Japanese tour, The Work disbanded but reformed again in 1989 with the original line-up to record two industrial/noise albums, Rubber Cage (1989) and See (1992). In February 1987 Hodgkinson toured with South African band Kalahari Surfers, playing at the [...] "Rote Lieder DDR" [...] Festival of Political Songs.|$|E
2500|$|As much as possible, Buñuel {{preferred}} {{to work with}} actors and crew members {{with whom he had}} worked before and whom he trusted, leading some critics to refer to these people as a [...] "stock company", including such performers as: Fernando Rey, Francisco Rabal, Pierre Clementi, Julien Bertheau, Michel Piccoli, Claudio Brook, Silvia Pinal, Paul Frankeur and Georges Marchal. [...] In his final film, That Obscure Object of Desire, the central character was played by Rey, but voiced by the French-speaking Piccoli. He told actors as little as possible, and limited his directions mostly to physical movements ("move to the right", [...] "walk <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>and</b> go through that door", etc.), [...] arguing that he had a better chance of capturing reality with inexperienced players who projected a desired sense of awkwardness. [...] He often refused to answer actors' questions and was known to simply turn off his hearing aid on the set. [...] One of his stars, Catherine Deneuve, has stated: [...] "I've always thought that he likes actors, up to a point. I think he likes very much the idea of the film, and to write it. But I had the impression that the film-making was not what he {{preferred to}} do. He had to go through actors, and he liked them if they were easy, simple, not too much fuss." [...] Though they found it difficult at the time, many actors who worked with him acknowledged later that his approach made for fresh and excellent performances.|$|E
60|$|They passed {{backwards}} {{through the}} door, {{then they went}} <b>down</b> <b>the</b> silent <b>hall</b> <b>and</b> out into <b>the</b> street. Even as they did so, the clock struck a quarter to two.|$|R
6000|$|... "Take {{him up to}} Father Kenelm. Tell him to {{look after}} the monk's comfort. This evening he can bring him <b>down</b> to <b>the</b> <b>hall,</b> <b>and</b> I will {{question}} him as to his journey." ...|$|R
60|$|So {{the elder}} brother {{looked in the}} mirror, and he was sore amazed; for {{he was an old}} man, and his hair was white upon his head; and he sat <b>down</b> in <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>and</b> wept aloud.|$|R
60|$|He dashed <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>and</b> stood shyly {{scratching}} at {{the straw}} of his newest hat.|$|E
60|$|Then Eric ran <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall,</b> <b>and,</b> {{putting out}} his strength, tore the Baresark from them.|$|E
60|$|Then {{he paused}} for a while, and, hearing no dissent, walked <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>and</b> out of the door.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Goodchild put him <b>down</b> in <b>the</b> old <b>hall,</b> <b>and</b> {{looked about}} him wildly.|$|R
60|$|Opening the door, {{she paused}} on the threshold, to glance <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> first, <b>and</b> {{then back to}} Allie. Her smile was beautiful. She {{closed the door and}} locked it. Allie heard the soft swish of silk dying away.|$|R
6000|$|... "If you scream or do {{anything}} silly you will be ever so sorry," [...] she said. [...] "Go <b>down</b> into <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>and</b> talk to Jo. Keep him where the stove is, {{with his back to}} the door." ...|$|R
60|$|Reinhart got {{quickly to}} his feet and left the office. He hurried <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>and</b> out of the Council building.|$|E
6000|$|Before either spoke, a head, in a nightcap {{so large}} and beruffled {{that it looked like}} a cabbage, popped out of a room farther <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall,</b> <b>and</b> an {{astonished}} voice exclaimed, ...|$|E
60|$|Half an {{hour later}} Gilbert ran <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>and</b> tapped on the spare-room door. A drowsy voice {{answered}} him {{and in a moment}} Marilla's pale, scared face peeped out from behind the door.|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed it is. Come, Miss Ray, we'll take a turn <b>down</b> into <b>the</b> <b>hall,</b> <b>and</b> see if {{places are}} ready for us." [...] Cornbury rather despised Rowan, as being a brewer and mechanical; and {{probably}} he showed that he did so.|$|R
60|$|They {{entered the}} lodge. Islington hurried <b>down</b> <b>the</b> long Gothic <b>hall,</b> <b>and</b> opened <b>the</b> library door.|$|R
60|$|He {{ran toward}} {{her with a}} {{heightened}} color and outstretched hands. But she whipped her own behind her, glanced rapidly up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> long <b>hall,</b> <b>and</b> stood looking {{at him with a}} half-audacious, half-mischievous admiration, in utter contrast to her old reserve.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come out, Peter. I'm {{waiting for}} you!" [...] he called <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall,</b> <b>and</b> made his voice sound as angry as he could. But inside he was chuckling. Then Jimmy Skunk calmly {{turned and went}} about his business. He had kept his word.|$|E
60|$|With {{a tragic}} gesture, Marie {{was about to}} adjust the pompon when the quick tap of a crutch came <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall,</b> <b>and</b> Lizzie hurried in, flushed and breathless, but smiling happily as she {{uncovered}} the box she carried {{with a look of}} proud satisfaction.|$|E
60|$|With this he {{gathered}} up the firearms, one by one, and tossed them through the window. Then he straightened up and a shot flashed <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>and</b> tumbled the big Mexican guard to the floor {{just as he was}} about to glide through the doorway.|$|E
60|$|It {{was seven}} o'clock when <b>the</b> doctor came <b>down</b> into <b>the</b> <b>hall,</b> <b>and</b> stood rubbing his freshly washed hands before opening the study door. Winton {{was still sitting}} before the fire, motionless, shrunk into his fur coat. He raised himself a little and looked round dully.|$|R
60|$|I laid my hand gently, {{but firmly}} upon his shoulder. We were half-way <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> now, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> {{front door was}} wide open. I longed to throw him out, but I {{restrained}} myself. He was perfectly conscious, I am sure, of my inclination, but he {{showed no signs of}} uneasiness.|$|R
2500|$|On July 26, 2004, Sammartino and Ric Flair were {{involved}} in the [...] "Who snubbed who?" [...] non-confrontation at the Mellon Arena in Pittsburgh. Flair had denigrated Sammartino's wrestling ability in his book To Be the Man. Flair said Sammartino refused to shake his hand at the event, while Sammartino said Flair saw him coming <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall,</b> turned, <b>and</b> rushed away.|$|R
60|$|Then {{the head}} medicine-man, raising himself upon his knees, crept {{on to the}} dais, took the fetish from her hands, and {{breaking}} into a wild song of triumph, he and his companions crawled <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>and</b> vanished through the door, leaving them alone save for the Asika's husband.|$|E
6000|$|... "For my sake," [...] implored the Baroness again; but {{the scale}} was turned. The Baron pushed back his chair heavily and rose to his feet. [...] "Forward!" [...] he roared, in a voice of thunder, and a great shout went up in answer as he strode clanking <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>and</b> out of the open door.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think you}} are mad, madame--mad so to talk of {{resisting}} him, as you are mad to call me coward. I'll leave you till you are come to a more tranquil frame of mind." [...] And turning upon his heel, his face on fire from the lash of her contempt, he strode <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>and</b> passed out, leaving her alone.|$|E
60|$|As soon as {{the cadets}} were settled <b>down</b> at <b>the</b> <b>Hall,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> {{excitement}} over the runaway, the loss of Andy's things, and the fight between Jack and Ritter, was at an end, {{the talk of the}} boys turned to football and other Fall sports. As in the past, the cadets hoped to have a good eleven and win some substantial victories.|$|R
60|$|R. Jones stood not on {{the order}} of his going. He was <b>down</b> in <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>and</b> fumbling with <b>the</b> handle of the front door with an agility of which few casual {{observers}} of his dimensions would have deemed him capable. The next moment he was out in the street, walking calmly toward Leicester Square, pondering over what he had heard.|$|R
60|$|Paul strolled <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> {{with her}} <b>and</b> handed {{her into the}} carriage. For {{the first time in}} his life he held her hand a little tighter and a little longer than was necessary.|$|R
