40|$|Barley is an {{important}} crop in the upper Great Plains, yet its economic importance has not been quantified. Expenditures and returns from crop production, grain handling, transportation, and processing activities represented the direct economic <b>impacts</b> <b>from</b> the barley industry. Secondary economic impacts were estimated using an input-output model. Barley production in the tri-state region averaged 3. 3 million planted acres and 165 million bushels from 1994 through 1996. North Dakota had about 2. 5 million acres. Barley production was estimated to generate $ 446 million in direct economic impacts. Total (direct and secondary) annual economic <b>impacts</b> <b>from</b> barley production were estimated at $ 1. 2 billion. Annual direct <b>impacts</b> <b>from</b> handling barley at country (local) elevators and terminal elevators in the region were estimated at $ 13 million. Total annual economic <b>impacts</b> <b>from</b> grain handling activities were estimated at $ 37 million. Annual regional expenditures and returns from transporting barley from country and terminal elevators to various market destinations were estimated at $ 47 million. Total annual economic <b>impacts</b> <b>from</b> barley transportation were estimated at $ 122 million. <b>Impacts</b> <b>from</b> barley processing were limited to regional malting of barley produced in the tri-state region. Annual direct <b>impacts</b> <b>from</b> barley processing were estimated at $ 58 million. Total annual economic <b>impacts</b> <b>from</b> barley processing were estimated at $ 180 million. Processing activities employed 431 full-time jobs, while overall economic activity from the industry supported 18, 450 secondary full-time equivalent jobs. The barley industry was responsible for generating $ 32 million annually in sales and use, corporate income, and personal income taxes. Annual economic <b>impacts</b> <b>from</b> all barley activities were estimated at $ 1. 5 billion in the tri-state region. Total economic impacts in North Dakota, South Dakota, and Minnesota were estimated at $ 1. 1 billion, $ 70 million, and $ 371 million, respectively. barley, upper Great Plains, economic impact, Production Economics,...|$|R

According to {{a report from the}} United States Geological Survey (USGS), a maximum of 5.54in (141mm) of rain fell near Río Cerrillos in Ponce, though the highest measurement from the Weather Prediction Center (WPC) was 4.60in (117mm) at Puerto Real in Cabo Rojo. Many other locations received rainfall amounts of 2.0–4.5in (50–115mm), which flooded some roads and low-lying areas.|$|E

5|$|Zeta {{originated}} {{from an area}} of low pressure on December 29, which previously developed within an upper-level trough. After becoming a tropical storm, the National Hurricane Center continually predicted it would weaken rapidly. Like the previous tropical cyclone, Hurricane Epsilon, Zeta defied these predictions. The storm reached its peak strength on January 2, 2006 before finally dissipating on January 6. As Zeta never approached land there was no <b>impact</b> <b>from</b> the storm other than minor shipping problems. Several ships encountered the storm, and several crews in the 2005 Atlantic Rowing Race were affected by rough seas and high winds.|$|E
5|$|Although only a {{depression}} at final landfall, this was officially counted as {{a tropical storm}} hit on the United States {{as much of the}} circulation was on land before landfall in the area of St. Petersburg, Florida. In preparations for Marco, a tropical storm warning was issued for nearly the entire Gulf and Atlantic coast of Florida. In Florida, Marco caused flooding damage to houses and roads, in addition to producing tropical storm force winds across the state. However, Marco is more notable for the <b>impact</b> <b>from</b> the remnants, especially in Georgia and South Carolina, where rainfall from the storm peaked at 19.89in (505mm) near Louisville, Georgia. In combination with the remnants of Hurricane Klaus, Marco caused heavy rainfall in South Carolina, causing a dam to burst, leading to three fatalities. Several more fatalities were caused by the remnants of Marco and Klaus, and the system caused 12 deaths. It also caused $57million (1990USD, $ USD) in damage, most of it from damage or destruction of residences in Georgia.|$|E

5|$|Amelia {{affected}} the Texas coast {{for two days}} which caused several shipping incidents and minor damage in Corpus Christi and South Padre Island. While active, there were no deaths linked to the storm. However, the biggest <b>impact</b> <b>from</b> the storm followed its dissipation, when its remnants contributed to record rainfall totals over the state. The state, already suffering from a previous drought, believed that the rain would help alleviate the conditions. However, the dry ground aided the flooding from the storm. The rainfall caused several rivers and creeks to flood, especially around the Texas Hill Country and northern Texas, leading to severe damage. Following the storm, President Jimmy Carter declared six counties in the state as federal disaster areas, allowing residents to seek aid from the government. Additional aid was brought in {{from as far away}} as New York. Overall, Amelia caused 33fatalities with an estimated $110million in damages in what then-governor Dolph Briscoe called one of the worst floods in the history of the state.|$|E
5|$|As Kujira {{began to}} track towards Taiwan, the Taiwanese {{government}} issued land- and sea-based warnings {{in advance of}} the storm. The local weather bureau specifically alerted vessels off the southern and southeastern coasts of the island. Continued strengthening of Kujira prompted the Central Weather Bureau to issue medium typhoon warnings for several portions of Taiwan, though these warnings were downgraded to light typhoon status following the subsequent weakening of the typhoon on April22. This made Kujira the first April typhoon to prompt the issuance of any cyclone-related warnings in Taiwan since 1978. Impacts on the island were expected to be limited to rainfall, though the forecasted precipitation was also expected to lessen ongoing drought conditions. However, mudslides were also a potential <b>impact</b> <b>from</b> the typhoon. The National Fire Administration and Taiwan Power Company developed a contingency plan for the typhoon and had also undertaken other precautionary measures. Airports on Orchid Island and Green Island were closed. The resultant rainfall from Kujira's outer rainbands would be some of the most significant for the island in several months.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} usual {{tactical}} aspects of racing, Wipeout 2097 (unlike its predecessor) offered the chance to eliminate other drivers from the competition by destroying their craft with weapons.

The craft also blows up if the time limit is reached, though this only applies to human players. The biggest weapon introduced in 2097 was the Quake Disruptor, which has been a series hallmark ever since. This weapon causes a quake to thrust a destructive wave down the track that dunks the crafts it smash into.|$|E
