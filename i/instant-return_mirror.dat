50|$|The Yashica Company {{introduced}} its own SLR in 1959, the Pentamatic, an advanced, modern 35mm SLR camera with a proprietary bayonet-mount. The Pentamatic featured an automatic stop-down diaphragm (offered {{only with the}} Auto Yashinon 50mm/1.8 lens), <b>instant-return</b> <b>mirror,</b> a fixed pentaprism, and a mechanical focal-plane shutter with speeds of 1-1/1000 second, along with additional interchangeable lenses.|$|E
50|$|Large format SLR {{cameras were}} {{probably}} first marketed {{with the introduction}} of C.R. Smith's Monocular Duplex (U.S., 1884). SLRs for smaller exposure formats were launched in the 1920s by several camera makers. The first 35mm SLR available to the mass market, Leica's PLOOT reflex housing along with a 200mm f4.5 lens paired to a 35mm rangefinder camera body, debuted in 1935. The Soviet Спорт (“Sport”), also a 24mm by 36mm image size, was prototyped in 1934 and went to market in 1937. K. Nüchterlein's Kine Exakta (Germany, 1936) was the first integrated 35mm SLR to enter the market. Additional Exakta models, all with waist-level finders, were produced up to and during World War II. Another ancestor of the modern SLR camera was the Swiss-made Alpa, which was innovative, and influenced the later Japanese cameras. The first eye-level SLR viewfinder was patented in Hungary on August 23, 1943 by Jenő Dulovits, who then designed the first 35 mm camera with one, the Duflex, which used a system of mirrors to provide a laterally correct, upright image in the eye-level viewfinder. The Duflex, which went into serial production in 1948, was also the world's first SLR with an <b>instant-return</b> (a.k.a. autoreturn) <b>mirror.</b>|$|R
50|$|As {{development}} of SLR cameras has progressed since these early models, fast sequence shooting has apparently become possible using ordinary moving mirrors in high-speed cameras, {{getting rid of}} the vulnerable pellicle mirror that was prone to dust and dirt. The mirror mechanism of conventional SLR cameras has improved since the Pellix mirror was introduced; the viewfinder is dark for only a very short time, the shutter lag is small, and the mirror-return is fast enough for rapid shooting. Digital SLR cameras are able to take ten frames or more per second employing an <b>instant-return</b> <b>mirror.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{first major}} post-war SLR {{innovation}} was the eye-level viewfinder, which {{first appeared on}} the Hungarian Duflex in 1947 and was refined in 1948 with the Contax S, the first camera to use a pentaprism. Prior to this, all SLRs were equipped with waist-level focusing screens. The Duflex {{was also the first}} SLR with an <b>instant-return</b> <b>mirror,</b> which prevented the viewfinder from being blacked out after each exposure. This same time period also saw the introduction of the Hasselblad 1600F, which set the standard for medium format SLRs for decades.|$|E
50|$|Early 35 mm SLR cameras {{had similar}} {{functionality}} to larger models, with a waist-level ground-glass viewfinder and a mirror which {{remained in the}} taking position—blacking out the viewfinder—after an exposure, returning when the film was wound on. Innovations which transformed the SLR were the pentaprism eye-level viewfinder and the instant-return mirror—the mirror flipped briefly up during exposure, immediately returning to the viewfinding position. The half-silvered fixed pellicle mirror, without even the brief blackout of the <b>instant-return</b> <b>mirror,</b> was innovative but did not become standard. Through-the-lens light metering was an important advance. As electronics advanced, new functionality, discussed below, became available.|$|E
50|$|The Asahi Optical Company took a {{different}} manufacturing path, inspired by the German SLRs. Its first model, the Asahiflex I, existed in prototype form in 1951 and production in 1952, making it the first Japanese-built 35mm SLR. The Asahiflex IIB of 1954 was the first Japanese SLR with an <b>instant-return</b> <b>mirror.</b> Previously, the mirror would remain up and the viewfinder black until the shutter was cocked for the next shot. In 1957, the Asahi Pentax became the first Japanese fixed-pentaprism SLR; its success led Asahi to eventually rename itself Pentax. This was the first SLR to use the right-hand {{single-stroke film advance lever}} of the Leica M3 of 1954 and Nikon S2 of 1955. Asahi (starting with the Asahi Pentax) and many other camera makers used the M42 lens mount from the Contax S, which came to be called the Pentax screw mount. Pentax is now part of the Ricoh Corporation.|$|E

50|$|The {{earliest}} Leica reflex housing was the PLOOT (Leitz's five {{letter code}} for its products), announced in 1935, {{along with the}} 200 mm f/4.5 Telyt Lens. This date is significant because that it places Leica among the 35 mm SLR pioneers. Moreover, until the 1964 introduction of the Leicaflex, the PLOOT and Visoflex were Leica’s only SLR offerings. A redesigned PLOOT was introduced by Leica in 1951 as the Visoflex I. This {{was followed by a}} much more compact Visoflex II in 1960 (which was the only Visoflex version available in both LTM screwmount and M-bayonet) and the Visoflex III with <b>instant-return</b> <b>mirror</b> in 1964. Leica lenses for the Visoflex system included focal lengths of 65, 180 (rare), 200, 280, 400, 560, and 800mm. In addition, the optical groups of many rangefinder lenses could be removed, and attached to the Visoflex via a system of adapters. The Visoflex system was discontinued in 1984.|$|E
5000|$|The first 35 mm single-lens reflex (SLR) was the Kine Exakta, {{introduced}} in 1936. World War II interrupted {{development of the}} type. After the war, Exakta resumed development and the Contax S model with the now familiar pentaprism viewing feature was {{introduced in}} 1949. In the 1950s, the SLR also began to be produced in Japan by such companies as Asahi and Miranda. Asahi's Pentax introduced the <b>instant-return</b> <b>mirror,</b> important for the popularity of SLRs; until then the viewfinder on an SLR camera blanked as the mirror sprang out of the optical path just before taking the picture, returning when the film was wound on. Nikon's F model, introduced in March 1959, was a system camera that greatly improved the quality and utility of 35 mm format cameras, encouraging professionals (especially photojournalists) to switch from larger format cameras to the versatile, rugged, and fast SLR design. Numerous other film formats waxed and waned in popularity, but by the 1970s, interchangeable-lens SLR cameras and smaller rangefinders, from expensive Leicas to [...] "point-and-shoot" [...] pocket cameras, were all using 35 mm film, and manufacturers had proliferated.|$|E
