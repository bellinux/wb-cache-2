40|$|We discuss risk {{measures}} {{representing the}} {{minimum amount of}} capital a financial institution needs to raise and invest in a pre-specified <b>eligible</b> <b>asset</b> to ensure it is adequately capitalized. Most of the literature has focused on cash-additive risk measures, for which the <b>eligible</b> <b>asset</b> is a risk-free bond, {{on the grounds that}} the general case can be reduced to the cash-additive case by a change of numéraire. However, discounting does not work in all financially relevant situations, especially when the <b>eligible</b> <b>asset</b> is a defaultable bond. In this paper, we fill this gap by allowing general eligible assets. We provide a variety of finiteness and continuity results for the corresponding risk measures and apply them to risk measures based on value-at-risk and tail value-at-risk on L p spaces, as well as to shortfall risk measures on Orlicz spaces. We pay special attention to the property of cash subadditivity, which has been recently proposed as an alternative to cash additivity to deal with defaultable bonds. For important examples, we provide characterizations of cash subadditivity and show that when the <b>eligible</b> <b>asset</b> is a defaultable bond, cash subadditivity is the exception rather than the rule. Finally, we consider the situation where the <b>eligible</b> <b>asset</b> is not liquidly traded and the pricing rule is no longer linear. We establish when the resulting risk measures are quasiconvex and show that cash subadditivity is only compatible with continuous pricing rules...|$|E
40|$|Monetary risk {{measures}} are usually {{interpreted as the}} smallest amount of external capital that must be added to a financial position to make it acceptable. We propose a new concept: intrinsic risk measures and argue that this approach provides a direct path from unacceptable positions towards the acceptance set. Intrinsic risk measures use only internal resources and return the smallest percentage of the currently held financial position which has to be sold and reinvested into an <b>eligible</b> <b>asset</b> such that the resulting position becomes acceptable. While avoiding the problem of infinite values, intrinsic risk measures allow a free choice of the <b>eligible</b> <b>asset</b> and they preserve desired properties such as monotonicity and quasi-convexity.

40|$|We study capital {{requirements}} for bounded financial positions {{defined as the}} minimum amount of capital {{to invest in a}} chosen <b>eligible</b> <b>asset</b> targeting a pre-specified acceptability test. We allow for general acceptance sets and general eligible assets, including defaultable bonds. Since the payoff of these assets is not necessarily bounded away from zero the resulting risk measures cannot be transformed into cash-additive risk measures by a change of numeraire. However, extending the range of eligible assets is important because, as exemplified by the recent financial crisis, assuming the existence of default-free bonds may be unrealistic. We focus on finiteness and continuity properties of these general risk measures. As an application, we discuss {{capital requirements}} based on Value-at-Risk and Tail-Value-at-Risk acceptability, the two most important acceptability criteria in practice. Finally, we prove that there is no optimal choice of the <b>eligible</b> <b>asset.</b> Our results and our examples show that a theory of capital requirements allowing for general eligible assets is richer than the standard theory of cash-additive risk measures...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} role and effects of the {{collateral}} framework which central banks, {{and in particular the}} Eurosystem, use in conducting temporary monetary policy operations. First, the paper explains the design of such a framework from the perspective of risk mitigation, which is the purpose of collateralisation. The paper argues that, by means of appropriate risk mitigation measures, the residual risk on any potentially <b>eligible</b> <b>asset</b> can be equalised and brought down to the level consistent with the risk tolerance of the central bank. Once this result has been achieved, eligibility decisions should be based on an economic cost-benefit analysis. Second, the paper looks at the effects of the collateral framework on financial markets, and in particular on spreads between eligible and ineligible assets. ...|$|E

40|$|We study comonotonicity of risk {{measures}} {{in terms of}} the primitives of the theory: acceptance sets and eligible assets. We show that comonotonicity cannot be characterized by the properties of the acceptance set alone and heavily depends on the choice of the <b>eligible</b> <b>asset.</b> In fact, in many important cases, comonotonicity is only compatible with risk-free eligible assets. The incompatibility with risky eligible assets is systematic whenever the acceptability criterion is based on Value at Risk or any convex distortion risk measures such as Expected Shortfall. These findings show the limitations of the concept of comonotonicity in a world without risk-free assets and raise questions about the meaning and the role of comonotonicity within a capital adequacy framework.

40|$|In {{a capital}} {{adequacy}} framework, risk measures {{are used to}} determine the minimal amount of capital that a financial institution has to raise and invest in a portfolio of pre-specified <b>eligible</b> <b>assets</b> in order to pass a given capital adequacy test. From a capital efficiency perspective, it is important to identify the set of portfolios of <b>eligible</b> <b>assets</b> that allow to pass the test by raising the least amount of capital. We study the existence and uniqueness of such optimal portfolios as well as their sensitivity to changes in the underlying capital position. This naturally leads to investigating the continuity properties of the set-valued map associating to each capital position the corresponding set of optimal portfolios. We pay special attention to lower semicontinuity, which is the key continuity property from a financial perspective. This "stability" property is always satisfied if the test is based on a polyhedral risk measure but it generally fails once we depart from polyhedrality even when the reference risk measure is convex. However, lower semicontinuity can be often achieved if one if one is willing to focuses on portfolios that are close to being optimal.

When the policy rate is sufficiently low, this set-up gives rise to an (il-) liquidity premium on non-eligible assets. Then, a quantitative easing policy, which increases the size of the central bank's balance sheet, can increase real activity and prices, while a credit easing policy, which changes the composition of the balance sheet, can lower interest rate spreads, stimulate real activity, and reduce prices.

40|$|Hedge fund indices {{have grown}} in numbers over the recent years and made their {{presence}} widespread {{through a number of}} providers. Assets linked to hedge fund indices currently exceed $ 12 billion, and the debate is now focusing on whether they should be considered as <b>eligible</b> <b>assets</b> for UCITS III funds. The consequences of a positive or negative answer from regulators are extremely important. In particular, a positive answer would imply that any non-approved offshore hedge fund can be indirectly distributed to any retail investors via an UCITS III vehicle, as long as this fund belongs to a hedge fund index. The problem is that existing hedge fund indices are fundamentally different from indices of traditional assets. In this paper, we review non-investable hedge fund indices, the various steps of their construction and the numerous performance biases that affect their returns. These biases are so important that in our view, the majority of existing hedge fund indices are not representative of the hedge fund universe – at best, they represent a biased sample of funds that have agreed to report to a database or an index provider. The case of the so-called investable hedge fund indices, which are often presented as an alternative to actively managed funds of hedge funds, is not much better. Our observations reveal that existing investable indices are less representative of the hedge fund universe and more biased than their non-investable cousins. They are, in essence, funds of hedge funds managed according to arbitrary rules and primarily designed to support high-fee tracking products. As a result of their numerous biases, lack of representativity and/or construction, our view is that existing hedge fund indices do not fulfil the three basic criteria required to become UCITS III eligible – sufficient diversification, ability to serve as an adequate benchmark and appropriate publication. We therefore suggest excluding them from the list of UCITS III <b>eligible</b> <b>assets.</b> Of course, in the future, this position could be revised once quality hedge fund indices are available and fulfil the aforementioned three basic criteria. hedge funds, UCITS, regulation, indices...|$|R
