HBO had earlier said that it had put [...] "probably 160 lawyers" [...] onto the task of reviewing the film in anticipation of challenges from the notoriously litigious church. Sheila Nevins of HBO commented {{that she could not}} believe how aggressive the church had been. Not only did it effectively provide free advertising for the film, but its hostility had made HBO Documentary Films even more determined to produce the film: [...] "I thought, 'They really don't want us to <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> <b>All</b> <b>the</b> reason more to do it.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{play has}} also been {{analysed}} {{as part of the}} theatre of the absurd. In a 1984 article, Archie J.

[...] In [...] a 2000 study of Coward, Jean Chothia instances surreal exchanges in the play, such as: [...] "Have you ever crossed the Sahara on a camel?" [...] "Frequently.

In 2008, Peter Orlovsky told the co-directors of the 2010 film Howl that a short moonlit walk—during which Orlovsky sang a rendition of the Hank Williams song [...] "Howlin’ At the Moon"—may have been the encouragement for the title of Ginsberg’s poem. [...] "I never asked him, and he never offered," [...] Orlovsky told them, [...] "but there were things he would pick up on and use in his verse form some way or another. Poets <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> time." [...] The Dedication by Ginsberg states he took the title from Kerouac.|$|E

After his release, he had offers to join the Roughriders or the Montreal Alouettes, and Jones elected to sign back with the Roughriders. [...] Roughriders {{director}} of player personnel Joe Womack admitted that trading Jones had been a mistake: [...] "Eric (Tillman, Saskatchewan's GM) and myself and Ken (Miller, the Roughriders' head coach) admittedly probably made a mistake -- and that's OK to admit that; teams <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> time." [...] Joseph, the player the Roughriders received in exchange for Jones was released by the club after training camp. Jones finished the 2009 season with 14 tackles.|$|E
