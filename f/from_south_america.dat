He added mercuric cyanide to form the compound palladium(II) cyanide, which was heated to extract palladium metal.|$|E

5|$|Alligator weed was {{introduced}} to the United States <b>from</b> <b>South</b> <b>America.</b> It takes root in shallow water, interfering with navigation, irrigation, and flood control. The alligator weed flea beetle and two other biological controls were released in Florida, greatly reducing the amount of land covered by the plant. Another aquatic weed, the giant salvinia (Salvinia molesta) is a serious pest, covering waterways, reducing water flow and harming native species. Control with the salvinia weevil (Cyrtobagous salviniae) and the salvinia stem-borer moth (Samea multiplicalis) is effective in warm climates, and in Zimbabwe, a 99% control of the weed was obtained over a two-year period.|$|E
5|$|Argentina {{allied with}} Brazil, Uruguay and Peru, three {{countries}} that had also recently ended their local military dictatorships, to mediate {{in the conflict}} between the United States and the Nicaraguan Contras. They created the Contadora support group, to support the Contadora group <b>from</b> <b>South</b> <b>America.</b> Both groups negotiated together, but ultimately failed because of the reluctance of both Nicaragua and the United States to change their positions. The group changed its scope later to discuss foreign debt and diplomacy with the United Kingdom in relation to the Falklands conflict.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} dinosaur families, the {{systematics}} (evolutionary relationships) {{within the family}} Abelisauridae are confused. Several cladistic {{studies have indicated that}} Majungasaurus shares a close relationship with Carnotaurus <b>from</b> <b>South</b> <b>America,</b> while others were unable to firmly place it in the phylogeny. The most recent analysis, using the most complete information, instead recovered Majungasaurus in a clade with Rajasaurus and Indosaurus from India, but excluding South American genera like Carnotaurus, Ilokelesia, Ekrixinatosaurus, Aucasaurus and Abelisaurus, as well as Rugops from mainland Africa. This leaves open the possibility of separate clades of abelisaurids in western and eastern Gondwana.|$|E
