5000|$|The {{technique}} of endovascular filament (intraluminal suture) MCAO as an animal model of <b>ischemic</b> <b>stroke</b> <b>was</b> described first by Koizumi [...] It {{is applied to}} rats and mice. A piece of surgical filament is introduced into the internal carotid artery and forwarded until the tip occludes {{the origin of the}} middle cerebral artery, resulting in a cessation of blood flow and subsequent brain infarction in its area of supply. If the suture is removed after a certain interval, reperfusion is achieved (transient MCAO); if the filament is left in place the procedure is suitable as model of permanent MCAO, too. The most common modification is based on Longa (1989) [...] who described filament introduction via the external carotid artery, allowing closure of the access point with preserved blood supply via the common and internal carotid artery to the brain after the removal of the filament. Known pitfalls of this method are insufficient occlusion, subarachnoid hemorrhage , hyperthermia , and necrosis of the ipsilateral extracranial tissue [...] Filament MCAO is not applicable to all rat strains [...]|$|E

A high misdiagnosis rate of <b>ischemic</b> <b>stroke</b> <b>was</b> observed among neurosyphilis patients in clinical practice, which prevents patients from receiving the most appropriate treatment, and often results in more severe neurologic damage. Methods: A total of 149 neurosyphilis patients were retrospectively reviewed. The control group comprised 1570 non-neurosyphilitic ischemic stroke patients. The proportion of patients with ischemic stroke as the primary symptom of {{the different types of}} neurosyphilis and the misdiagnosis rate of neurosyphilitic ischemic stroke were analyzed, including the risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Results: Among the 149 neurosyphilis patients. 21 (14. 09 %) developed ischemic stroke as a primary symptom, including three cases of syphilitic meningitis and 18 cases of meningovascular neurosyphilis. Only four of the neurosyphilis patients had histories of ischemic stroke and recurrence. The other 17 cases were treated {{for the first time in}} the emergency department; however, none of the patients were initially suspected of neurosyphilitic ischemic stroke. All of the patients were only diagnosed with neurosyphilis during their follow-up treatment. The misdiagnosis rate of neurosyphilitic <b>ischemic</b> <b>stroke</b> <b>was</b> as high as 80. 95 % (17 / 21). Furthermore, except for hypertension, no significant differences in cardiovascular risk factors were observed between the groups (P> 0. 05).

40|$|Background: Stroke is {{becoming}} an increasingly serious public health issue in Ethiopia and the paucity of data specific to the Ethiopian setting is limiting the formulation of an appropriate response.

Design: Medical record review with a standardized abstraction tool was used to obtain all data for this retrospective case study. Data was entered in EpiInfo Version 7 and analyzed using STATA 12. Descriptive statistics were used to explore differences among stroke subtypes and compare with other sub-Saharan African countries. Results: Among 142 stroke patients (mean age 62. 8  ±  15. 6  years, 54. 2 % male), <b>ischemic</b> <b>stroke</b> <b>was</b> the most frequent subtype (55. 6 %) followed by intracerebral hemorrhage (32. 4 %) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (5. 6 %). 38. 0 % of patients had pre-existing hypertension and 4. 9 % had pre-existing diabetes, and most were not on any treatment. 66. 2 % of patients were hypertensive at hospital arrival and nearly all presented with focal neurological deficit.
