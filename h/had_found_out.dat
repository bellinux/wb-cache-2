Anglin had previously lost his bid to be renominated in his riding as Wildrose's candidate for the next provincial election.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} decade of the Bourbon Restoration, Lafayette lent his support to a number of conspiracies in France and other European countries, all of which came to nothing. He was {{involved}} in the various Charbonnier plots, and agreed to go to the city of Belfort, where there was a garrison of French troops, and assume a major role in the revolutionary government. Warned that the royal government <b>had</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> about the conspiracy, he turned back on the road to Belfort, avoiding overt involvement. More successfully, he supported the Greek Revolution beginning in 1821, and by letter attempted to persuade American officials to ally with the Greeks. Louis' government considered arresting both Lafayette and Georges Washington, who was also involved in the Greek efforts, but were wary of the political ramifications if they did. Lafayette remained a member of the restored Chamber of Deputies until 1823, when new plural voting rules helped defeat his bid for re-election.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} his first for Starbucks' Hear Music record label, after {{previously}} having a 45-year-old relationship with Capitol/EMI. The recording contract with Capitol/EMI ended a few {{months prior to the}} release of the album, after McCartney <b>had</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> that EMI were planning to take six months to set up a promotional plan for the album. McCartney was the first artist to sign to Hear Music. The album was released on 4 June 2007 in the UK, and a day later on the 5th in the US, and with a vinyl edition later in the month on 25 June. In the US, Memory Almost Full debuted at number 3 on the Billboard 200 with about 161,000 copies sold within the first week, making it McCartney's highest-charting album there since 1997's Flaming Pie. 47% of the album sales from the opening week were from Starbucks coffee shops, which were the best sales for any album in the history of Starbucks. While it was announced that copies of the album sold in the Starbucks coffee shops in the UK would not be counted by the Official UK Charts, because they are not registered in the copies counting system, Memory Almost Full, however, still managed to hit number 5 on the UK Album Charts. The album was also peaked at number 1 on Billboard Internet Sales Chart, and number 3 on Billboard Top Internet Albums Downloads.|$|E

And the funny thing is that the Americans had great difficulty understanding this because the Lightning had the two top aces in the Far East.|$|E

Russian poets wrote about his virtues, the court praised him, foreign ambassadors fought for his favour, and his family moved into the palace.

He later recalled that he was extremely unhappy that day and wrote the song in one sitting. [...] "Liar" [...] is a rant directed at past member Chris Poland.

500|$|In March or April 1589 the Countess married Sir Christopher Blount, a {{relatively}} poor Catholic soldier 12 years her junior, {{who had been}} the Earl of Leicester's Gentleman of the Horse and a trusted friend of his. The marriage was a great surprise and the Earl of Essex complained that it was an [...] "unhappy choice". In the face of tittle-tattle that had reached even France, Lady Leicesterâ€”she continued to be styled thusâ€”explained her choice with being a defenceless widow; like her marriage to Leicester, the union proved to be a [...] "genuinely happy" [...] one. Some 60 years later it was claimed in a satirical poem that she had poisoned the Earl of Leicester on his deathbed, thereby forestalling her own murder at his hands, because he <b>had</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> about her supposed lover, Sir Christopher Blount.|$|E

500|$|Gus finds Cavanaugh's lunch, and {{believes}} that it is poisoned due to its unusual smell. Shawn takes it to his father, Henry Spencer (Corbin Bernsen), to have it analyzed. Henry demands that in return, Shawn must build a dog house he promised to make in 1989. Shawn agrees, and leaves. While riding back to the office, he is run off the road by a mysterious van. Shawn wakes up in the hospital, and after he gets out, Gus informs him that he discovered another fake inhaler. Shawn returns to Henry's house to finish the dog house. Henry confirms that the lunch was poisoned, and Shawn returns to the bee. He disguises himself as the new spellmaster in order to enter the booth, and discovers that Cavanaugh <b>had</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> that Miklous Prochazka (Richard Zeman) was helping his son (Alexander Calvert), a contestant in the bee, to cheat by spelling out his son's words to him in Morse code using electrical impulses that were transferred to his false inhaler. After the bee has finished, Shawn has a [...] "psychic vision" [...] where he reveals everything to the police, who arrest Miklous and his son.|$|E
500|$|After the King Michael's Coup, while {{en route}} to a meeting with Himmler in Berlin, Phleps and his entourage made a detour to reconnoitre the {{situation}} near Arad, Romania after receiving reports of Soviet advances in that area. Accompanied only by his adjutant and his driver, and unaware of the presence of Red Army units in the vicinity, he entered È˜imand, a village approximately [...] north of Arad, on the afternoon of 21 September 1944. Soviet forces were already in the village, and Phleps and his men were captured and brought in for interrogation. When the building in which they were held was attacked by German aircraft later that afternoon, the prisoners tried to escape and were shot by their guards. Bergel suspects that Phleps had been set up by Hungarian army officers who <b>had</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> that Phleps knew of plans for Hungary to switch sides as Romania had done shortly before. Phleps' personal effects, including his identity card, tags and decorations, were found by a Hungarian patrol and handed over to German authorities on 29 September 1944. Phleps had been listed as missing in action since 22 September 1944 when he did not show up for his meeting with Himmler, who had issued a warrant for Phleps' arrest.|$|E

Concurrently, the destroyer [...] arrived at its assigned station [...] offshore from the Chinese seaport of Swatow (Shantou), provoking the Chinese to surround it with an armada of over 40 armed powered junks. Although Task Force 77 was conducting its aerial parade over the horizon to the west, nearly two hours passed before aircraft from the task force appeared over Swatow and made threatening passes at the Chinese vessels and the port city. MacArthur officially received notification of his dismissal shortly after 15:00 Tokyo time (14:00 on the China coast), although he <b>had</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> about it half an hour before. Two hours later, the Bole retired from its station without hostile action being initiated by either side.
