500|$|Garcia {{returned}} to the Indians in 1949. A newspaper article predicted that Garcia might fill big needs in the Cleveland bullpen. Garcia saw action as a starter and as a relief pitcher that year, starting 20 of his 41 regular season appearances. He finished his rookie season with a 14–5 record, a league-leading 2.36 ERA, 94 strikeouts and five shutouts. Fellow pitcher Bob Feller said, [...] "From the beginning, Mike was a sneaky quick pitcher. For a big guy, he was certainly mobile." [...] One year removed from his rookie season, expectations from Indians General Manager Hank Greenberg and pitching coach Mel Harder were for Garcia to become a key piece of the Indians' rotation. [...] "Garcia has all the potentialities of a really great pitcher. <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> he should not reach greatness this season", Greenberg said. Garcia finished the 1950 season 11–11.|$|E

2500|$|The USR's public {{expression}} of regret over having tolerated [...] "a text with antisemitic content" [...] caused Goma to threaten with a lawsuit on libel grounds.

It is not him that we are discussing, but the magazine. <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> why he would sue me personally." [...] According to an overview of the episode by journalist Ovidiu Şimonca, Horia Gârbea had unwittingly prompted Goma to state his intention of suing the Jewish-Romanian community league, or Federation of Jewish Communities of Romania (FCER). This was because, during the scandal, Gârbea had explained that the FCER's reaction was an incentive in the USR's internal investigation. Goma's claim for reparations from FCER leaders, Şimonca noted, ignored the fact that Gârbea had not disclosed any names.|$|E

On 2 February 1965 Ray Williams wrote to Crawford that after having conversations with Bill Sutton and Wilma and Lauria Hedley {{he had become}} aware of Crawford's career as a playwright and to his knowledge had already written 25 plays. Mr Williams invited Crawford to contribute to The Realist! as both a journalist and a playwright. [...] "We should be most grateful if you should write an article for us – on any topic that suits you... Furthermore, <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> why we could not publish a portion of one of your plays, say an Act or a few scenes, at least."

2500|$|The Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868) {{granted the}} Lakota Sioux and their {{northern}} Cheyenne allies a reservation, including the Black Hills, in Dakota Territory {{and a large}} area of [...] "unceded territory" [...] in what became Montana and Wyoming. Both areas were for the exclusive use of the Indians, and whites, except for government officials, were forbidden to trespass. [...] In 1874, the discovery of gold in the Black Hills caused the United States to attempt to buy the Black Hills from the Sioux. [...] The U.S. ordered all bands of Lakota and Cheyenne {{to come to the}} Indian agencies on the reservation by January 31, 1876 to negotiate the sale.

2500|$|I {{have always}} been {{of the opinion that}} we have no right to impose our ideals upon other nations, no matter how strange it may seem to us that they enjoy the kind of life they lead, how slow they may be in {{utilizing}} the resources of their countries, or how much opposed their ideals may be to ours ... Our intolerant attitude is most pronounced in regard to what we like to call [...] "our free institutions." [...] Modern democracy was no doubt the most wholesome and needed reaction against the abuses of absolutism and of a selfish, often corrupt, bureaucracy. That the wishes and thoughts of the people should find expression, and that the form of government should conform to these wishis is an axiom that has pervaded the whole Western world, and that is even taking root in the Far East. It is a quite different question, however, in how far the particular machinery of democratic government is identical with democratic institutions ... To claim as we often do, that our solution is the only democratic and the ideal one is a one-sided expression of Americanism. <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> why we should not allow the Germans, Austrians, and Russians, or whoever else it may be, to solve their problems in their own ways, instead of demanding that they bestow upon themselves the benefactions of our regime.|$|E

[...] Using even stronger language, Cobb told the Sporting News in 1952 that [...] "the Negro should be accepted and not grudgingly but wholeheartedly." [...] In 1953, black newspapers cited his praise for Brooklyn Dodgers' catcher Roy Campanella, who Cobb said was [...] "among the all-time best catchers" [...] in baseball. Following Campanella's accident that left him paralyzed, the Dodgers staged a tribute game where tens of thousands of spectators silently held lit matches above their heads. Cobb wrote the Dodgers owner to show appreciation [...] "for what you did for this fine man." [...] Cobb also stated that Willie Mays was the [...] "only player I'd pay money to see."

2500|$|The United States lobbied {{against the}} {{resolution}} {{being brought to}} the UNGA, while Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman {{said that it was}} only exacerbating the situation and that a vote would trigger [...] "an extreme response from us." [...] However, following Operation Pillar of Defense, and under pressure from the United States, Israel stopped its threats of punishment to Abbas for going ahead with the move to the UN. Lieberman also went to New York City to meet Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, while Ambassador Ron Prosor was scheduled to speak after Abbas. Israeli former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert wrote: [...] "I believe that the Palestinian request from the United Nations is congruent with the basic concept of the two-state solution. Therefore, <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> to oppose it. Once the United Nations will lay the foundation for this idea, we in Israel will have to engage in a serious process of negotiations, in order to agree on specific borders based on the 1967 lines, and resolve the other issues. It is time to give a hand to, and encourage, the moderate forces amongst the Palestinians. Abu-Mazen [...] (Mahmoud Abbas) and Salam Fayyad need our help. It's time to give it." [...] There was a rally in support of the Palestinian bid in Tel Aviv's Rothschild Boulevard, which was organised by Gush Shalom, Peace Now, Hadash and Meretz. Former Foreign Ministry director Dr. Alon Liel said: [...] "As of today there is a Palestinian state. As of today we no longer control the life of a nation but the life of a separate state." [...] Former Meretz MK Mossi Raz said: [...] "We call on Lieberman and Netanyahu: It's not too late. Order the ambassador to say 'Israel yes.'" [...] Arab-Israeli singer Mira Awad also performed at the rally and said that she was [...] "happy with Abbas' bid and very sad about the inexplicable refusal to finally give the Palestinian people a chance to move forward." [...] Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard was criticised by Jewish groups for not rejecting the motion; she had initially wished to vote against the measure, but abstained instead due to opposition from her own cabinet and caucus. Netanyahu later downplayed the importance of the vote in saying that [...] "the decision at the United Nations will change nothing on the ground. It will not advance the establishment of a Palestinian state. It will delay it further. No matter how many hands are raised against us there is no power on earth that will cause me to compromise on Israel's security." ...|$|E
