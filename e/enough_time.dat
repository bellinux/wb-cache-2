5|$|Although {{the band}} {{did not have}} <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> to sell any records while touring, the album became Metal Blade Records' highest selling release. Five {{thousand}} copies was the label's average. Show No Mercy went on to sell between 15,500 and 20,000 copies in the United States; it also went on to sell more than 15,000 overseas, as Metal Blade had worldwide rights. The success of the album led to Slagel wanting the band to release a new record and an extended play.|$|E
5|$|In 1807 Scipione Piattoli {{returned}} to Courland. There he finally settled, abandoned the priesthood, and married {{one of the}} ladies of the court. In his final years in Courland he was involved with Courland's educational system, and hoped to pursue some scientific studies, a lifelong dream for which he never found <b>enough</b> <b>time.</b> He died of a lung infection in Altenburg on April 12, 1809. He was buried in a park in Löbichau.|$|E

Men formed choirs and music ensembles, performing in neighboring towns when relations were good. The men earned two days of furlough for each month of service.

5|$|On 1 February 2011, Ian Thorpe {{announced}} that he would try to qualify for the 2012 Olympics in London. Thorpe's major focus was the 100m and 200m freestyle at 2012's trials, stating he could offer the most value to the Australian team in the relays. He would not swim the 400m, claiming he would not have <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> to build up endurance for that event. This led many to see a renewed rivalry with Michael Phelps.|$|E
5|$|One {{issue that}} emerged from these studies was the problem of {{providing}} early warning to the SCD sites. The SCD's MSR radars provided detection at perhaps , which meant targets would appear on their radars only seconds before launches {{would have to be}} carried out. In a sneak attack scenario, there would not be <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> to receive command authority for the release of nuclear weapons. This meant the bases would require launch on warning authority, which was politically unacceptable.|$|E

After the third run was stopped for no gain, however, the Hokies were forced to punt the ball. Boston College now had 28seconds to score a touchdown and either tie the game with an extra point or win it with a two-point conversion.|$|E

5|$|The {{coronation}} {{usually takes}} place {{several months after}} the death of the previous monarch, as it is considered a joyous occasion that would be inappropriate while mourning continues. This interval also gives the planners <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> to complete the elaborate arrangements required. For example, Queen ElizabethII was crowned on 2June 1953, having ascended the throne on 6February 1952; the date of her coronation was announced almost a year in advance, and preparations inside the abbey took five months.|$|E
5|$|After Charles II was {{restored}} to the throne in 1660, he began a wide-ranging programme of work on the coastal defences. The Dutch fleet then attacked up the Thames in June 1667, but were deterred from going further for fear of the Tilbury and Gravesend fortifications. In reality, the forts were poorly prepared to resist a Dutch attack; at Tilbury {{there were only two}} guns ready for action. The Dutch struck the English fleet at Medway instead, giving <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> for the government to improve the defences along the Thames and mount 80 guns on the forts. In the wake of the conflict, the King instructed his Chief Engineer, a Dutchman called Sir Bernard de Gomme, to develop Tilbury Fort's defences further.|$|E
5|$|After filming was complete, test {{screenings}} were held, and {{the production}} team became aware of {{a problem with the}} ending. In the original ending, Ru'afo is ejected into space from the Son'a collector ship and de-ages rapidly as he floats amongst the rings of the planet Ba'ku. The revised ending saw the Enterprise swoop in at the last minute to save Picard and destroy the collector ship with Ru'afo aboard. The studio liked the new ending but wanted a bigger space battle. The production team agreed providing they could postpone the release to allow <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> for this. Because the studio wanted Insurrection to be released in time for Christmas, no further revisions were made to the ending.|$|E

5|$|As Neerja boards Pan Am 73, it is {{revealed}} that the Abu Nidal organization, a Libyan-sponsored terrorist group, plans to hijack the plane in Karachi. The plane takes off from Mumbai's Sahar International Airport and lands in Karachi, where the four Abu Nidal terrorists, disguised as security officers escorting a Libyan diplomat, hijack the plane. Neerja quickly alerts the cockpit, and the three American pilots escape through the overhead hatch, fleeing to the terminal under fire from the hijackers. The American pilots had just <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> to escape, as the hijackers {{did not realize that}} the cockpit of a Boeing 747 is located upstairs.|$|E

Afterward, Lariboisière was sent to northern Italy where he commanded the advance guard division; Jean Victor Moreau's right wing, with Lariboisière's infantry and artillery, crossed the Ticino river at Pavia, marched up the left bank of the Po River and took position beneath Alessandria; there, he protected Moreau's flank from Russian skirmishers sufficiently for Moreau to establish a large train of artillery in Turin and to strengthen the French positions between the Po and the Tanaro river.|$|E

He {{attempts}} to negotiate with Amber, Wilson's girlfriend, about conditions under which they can both have Wilson's company. They are at a standstill, thus House seeks Lisa Cuddy's (Lisa Edelstein) resolution. However, she will only lay out the conditions if House does his team's performance reviews (knowing that he hates doing paperwork). House relents and Cuddy sets the rules, although House has Foreman do the team reviews instead.|$|E

5|$|Both 256Lr and 260Lr have half-lives {{too short}} to allow a {{complete}} chemical purification process. Early experiments with 256Lr therefore used rapid solvent extraction, with the chelating agent thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTA) dissolved in methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) as the organic phase, and with the aqueous phase being buffered acetate solutions. Ions of different charge (+2, +3, or +4) will then extract into the organic phase under different pH ranges, but this method will not separate the trivalent actinides and thus 256Lr must be identified by its emitted 8.24MeV alpha particles. More recent methods have allowed rapid selective elution with α-HIB {{to take place in}} <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> to separate out the longer-lived isotope 260Lr, which can be removed from the catcher foil with 0.05Mhydrochloric acid.|$|E
5|$|By mid-March, the Prussian {{ships were}} ready for action and the ice had receded far enough that Prince Adalbert ordered Jachmann to conduct a {{reconnaissance}} of the blockading force on 16 March. In the meantime, Dockum's squadron had arrived off Swinemünde two days before. Arcona and Nymphe patrolled off Greifswald, but the weather was very poor, with snow showers hampering visibility. The Prussian gunboats, led by the paddle steamer , remained closer to Swinemünde. Jachmann spotted three vessels at around 15:30, but there was not <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> before dark to catch them. Instead, Jachmann turned back to Swinemünde, intending to try again the following day.|$|E
5|$|Data {{is visiting}} D'Sora, but she seems unhappy {{and he is}} acting erratically {{in order to find}} an {{appropriate}} response to make her happy. It becomes evident to the crew that the nebula is causing distortions in space; Picard orders the ship into warp to leave the nebula as quickly as possible but this speeds up the distortions. Whilst investigating them, Lieutenant Van Mayter (Georgina Shore) is killed when a distortion embeds her into the deck. Data discovers that dark matter is causing the distortions. The ship can detect the pockets at short range, but not in <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> {{to move out of the}} way. Worf proposes using a shuttle to lead the Enterprise out, and Picard insists on piloting it alone.|$|E
