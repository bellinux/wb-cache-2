5|$|If {{appropriate}} {{electrical contacts}} {{are attached to}} a nanotube, electron-hole pairs (excitons) can be generated by injecting electrons and holes from the contacts. Subsequent exciton recombination results in <b>electroluminescence</b> (EL). Electroluminescent devices have been produced from single nanotubes and their macroscopic assemblies. Recombination appears to proceed via triplet-triplet annihilation giving distinct peaks corresponding to E11 and E22 transitions.|$|E
25|$|Roger Partridge {{made the}} first {{observation}} of <b>electroluminescence</b> from polymer films at the National Physical Laboratory in the United Kingdom. The device consisted of a film of poly(N-vinylcarbazole) up to 2.2 micrometers thick located between two charge injecting electrodes. The results of the project were patented in 1975 and published in 1983.|$|E
25|$|Pope's group {{reported}} in 1965 {{that in the}} absence of an external electric field, the <b>electroluminescence</b> in anthracene crystals is caused by the recombination of a thermalized electron and hole, and that the conducting level of anthracene is higher in energy than the exciton energy level. Also in 1965, W. Helfrich and W. G. Schneider of the National Research Council in Canada produced double injection recombination <b>electroluminescence</b> for the first time in an anthracene single crystal using hole and electron injecting electrodes, the forerunner of modern double-injection devices. In the same year, Dow Chemical researchers patented a method of preparing electroluminescent cells using high-voltage (500–1500 V) AC-driven (100–3000Hz) electrically insulated one millimetre thin layers of a melted phosphor consisting of ground anthracene powder, tetracene, and graphite powder. Their proposed mechanism involved electronic excitation at the contacts between the graphite particles and the anthracene molecules.|$|E
25|$|A light-emitting-diode (LED) is a {{semiconductor}} diode that emits light when an electric current is {{applied in the}} forward direction of the device, as in the simple LED circuit. The effect {{is a form of}} <b>electroluminescence</b> where incoherent and narrow-spectrum light is emitted from the p-n junction in a solid state material. The first practical visible-spectrum LED was invented in 1962 by Nick Holonyak Jr.|$|E
25|$|Research into polymer <b>electroluminescence</b> {{culminated in}} 1990 with J. H. Burroughes et al. at the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge University, UK, {{reporting}} a high efficiency green light-emitting polymer based device using 100nm thick films of poly(p-phenylene vinylene). Moving from molecular to macromolecular materials solved the problems previously encountered with the long-term {{stability of the}} organic films and enabled high-quality films to be easily made. Subsequent research developed multilayer polymers and the new field of plastic electronics and OLED research and device production grew rapidly.|$|E
25|$|In 1960 Martin Pope {{and some}} of his {{co-workers}} at New York University developed ohmic dark-injecting electrode contacts to organic crystals. They further described the necessary energetic requirements (work functions) for hole and electron injecting electrode contacts. These contacts are the basis of charge injection in all modern OLED devices. Pope's group also first observed direct current (DC) <b>electroluminescence</b> under vacuum on a single pure crystal of anthracene and on anthracene crystals doped with tetracene in 1963 using a small area silver electrode at 400 volts. The proposed mechanism was field-accelerated electron excitation of molecular fluorescence.|$|E

The ambient interior lighting package consisted of the installation of <b>electroluminescence</b> that gave the driver the ability to choose various color combinations for the instrument cluster, sound system and climate control displays, as well as light emitting {{from the top of}} the front footwells and from beneath the rear seats.|$|E
25|$|In some observations, {{the ball}} {{lightning}} {{appeared to have}} an extremely high energy concentration but this phenomenon hasn't been adequately verified. The present theory concerns only the low energy lightning ball form, with centripetal forces and surface tension.

Static discharge from the cylindrical stage imply the existence of contact electrification within the object. The direction of the discharges indicate the cylinder's rotation, and resulting rotational axis of the ball lightning in accordance to the law of laminar flow. If the ball came from the channel, it would have rotated in the opposite direction.|$|E

The instrument panel did not use regular bulbs to light the gauges, but rather <b>electroluminescence</b> lit the four chrome-ringed circular dash pods, needles, radio, shifter-position indicator in the console, as well as clock and air conditioning controls if equipped.
