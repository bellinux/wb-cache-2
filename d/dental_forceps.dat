50|$|Simple extractions are {{performed}} on teeth that are {{visible in the}} mouth, usually under local anaesthetic, and require only the use of instruments to elevate and/or grasp the visible portion of the tooth. Typically the tooth is lifted using an elevator, and using <b>dental</b> <b>forceps,</b> {{rocked back and forth}} until the periodontal ligament has been sufficiently broken and the supporting alveolar bone has been adequately widened to make the tooth loose enough to remove. Typically, when teeth are removed with forceps, slow, steady pressure is applied with controlled force.|$|E
5000|$|Castle Dale, {{the seat}} of Emery County government, is located on Cottonwood Creek in Castle Valley, a region of benchlands and river valleys bounded by the Wasatch Plateau {{to the west and}} the {{striking}} buttes, mesas, and canyons of the San Rafael Swell to the east. The high plateau barrier and the ruggedness of the Castle Valley landscape delayed settlement of the region until the late 1870s, when population growth and expanding livestock herds in Utah's central valleys stimulated a search for new agricultural and grazing lands. In 1875, brothers Orange Seely and Justus Wellington Seely, Jr., first brought the Mount Pleasant cooperative cattle and sheep herds to winter on Cottonwood Creek. On 22 August 1877 Brigham Young issued a formal call for settlers to locate in Castle Valley, the last such directive from the [...] "Great Colonizer" [...] before his death on 29 August. Orange Seely was appointed LDS bishop of the entire region east of the Wasatch Plateau, including present-day Emery, Carbon, and Grand counties. Local tradition describes Bishop Seely as a man of immense girth who made his pastoral rounds riding one mule and leading another laden with staple food items to be distributed to needy families, blacksmith tools for the shoeing of horses and sharpening of plowshares, and <b>dental</b> <b>forceps</b> to remove aching teeth.|$|E
30|$|In {{addition}} to the decision of choosing the optimal 3 D data between the pre-extraction or post-extraction tooth for fabrication of a customized implant, the intactness of the tooth {{must also be taken}} into account, particularly in the root area. Teeth that need to be replaced by implants are commonly damaged or even already extracted; thus, it is suggested that recreating a 3 D model based on the contra-lateral tooth could be a suitable option. Additionally, the concept of using 3 D data of the tooth without extraction could achieve better accuracy because there was no damage to the tooth by the elevator or <b>dental</b> <b>forceps</b> [88].|$|E
30|$|Dental pulp {{stem cells}} were {{collected}} from the pulp tissue of impacted mandibular wisdom teeth of three young (20, 21 and 23  years old) healthy male adults. An {{informed consent was obtained}} before extraction of the teeth. The teeth were rinsed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and the pulp tissue was removed, following separation of the crown by <b>dental</b> <b>forceps.</b> The pulp tissue was digested by incubation in 3  mg/ml collagenase solution (Sigma-Aldrich) dispense in PBS at 37  °C for 1  h. Cell suspension was then centrifuged and the cells were immersed in standard culture media [DMEM (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA), 20 % FBS (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and 1 % penicillin/streptomycin 10, 000  µ/mL (Life Technologies)] and placed in 25  cm 2 flasks and incubated at 37  °C and 5 % CO 2. DPSCs were passaged three times using 0.25 % trypsin plus EDTA (Life Technologies) before being used in this study.|$|E
40|$|Because of some {{aesthetic}} imperfections {{and because}} metal is unsuitable for some patients, metal-free ceramic has been developed. A patient, 50 years old, is {{presented with a}} 6 year old faceted bridge on teeth 24, 25, 26, 27. The patient complained of thermal irritation in the cervical region. A clinical examination showed gingivitis and lack of hygiene. Between the toothsegment 26 and the crown on 27 was a fracture, and the patient {{decided to have a}} new bridge made. A metal-free ceramic bridge made of Vita In-ceram zirconium was suggested as well as treatment of the periodontium by the Durr Vektor method. The teeth region 24 and 27 were anesthetized with local infiltration anesthetic. Silicone impression for a temporary bridge was taken. Using the separatory bur in the red contra angle Titan TE 200 crowns 24 and 27 were separated and pulled with special <b>dental</b> <b>forceps.</b> Before beginning the preparation it is necessary to put the retraction thread in two levels circularly round the stump in the gingival sulcus to prevent bleeding. The 2 mm of the tooth crown depth is marked by a diamond bur. Labial and palatal it is done with a special grooved diamond point LVS- 1 with 1. 2 mm grooves. The tooth is treated in the following order - occlusally, labially, approximately and palatally. At the same time a 0. 5 mm rectangular step inside the sulcus is prepared. Finally the rims of the step and the stump are treated with Titan Eva-head TK 14 with 0, 4 working amplitude and a maximum of 6000 r. p. m. The final treatment with Arkansas stone follows. The thread is removed and the impression in the additional silicone or polyether is taken. The relation between the jaws is estimated with the silicone key. The acrylic temporary bridge is made directly in the mouth and is cemented with temporary cement. The ceramic-free construction is cemented by adhesional technique...|$|E
