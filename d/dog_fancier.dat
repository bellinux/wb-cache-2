6000|$|Crusoe's {{father and}} mother were {{magnificent}} Newfoundlanders. There was no doubt as to their being of the genuine breed, for Major Hope had received them as a parting gift from a brother officer, who had brought them both from Newfoundland itself. The father's name was Crusoe; the mother's name was Fan. Why the father had been so called no one could tell. The man from whom Major Hope's friend had obtained the pair was a poor, illiterate fisherman, who {{had never heard of}} the celebrated [...] "Robinson" [...] in all his life. All he knew was that Fan had been named after his own wife. As for Crusoe, he had got him from a friend, who had got him from another friend, whose cousin had received him as a marriage gift from a friend of his; and that each had said to the other that the dog's name was [...] "Crusoe," [...] without reasons being asked or given on either side. On arriving at New York the major's friend, as we have said, made him a present of the dogs. Not being much of a <b>dog</b> <b>fancier,</b> he soon tired of old Crusoe, and gave him away to a gentleman, who took him down to Florida, {{and that was the end}} of him. He was never heard of more.|$|E

40|$|SOS Dog is an eye-opener {{for anyone}} {{involved}} in breeding, treating, showing or selling pure-bred dogs. The book is thought-provoking {{and easy to}} read, but its challenge of practices that are still widely considered to be acceptable {{in the field of}} dog breeding and showing is bound to cause some controversy in <b>dog</b> <b>fancier</b> circles. Veterinarians in particular are likely to find the book stimulating in terms of re-examining their role as canine health care professionals when it comes to treating the increasing number of hereditary and breeding problems encountered in purebred dogs.

40|$|The Weimaraner {{has been}} {{subjected}} to an intense publicity program {{in the last few years}} that has brought the breed to the attention of a considerable portion of the American public. That this program has been highly successful is evidenced by the widespread interest in the breed and the continued demand for comparatively high priced puppies. Two years ago Weimaraner show entries were a rarity and their appearance elicited much comment. Today show entries are approaching those of the more common hunting breeds and they are recognized by many people on sight. The enthusiasm of some writers in describing the prowess of the breed has been responsible for creating an exaggerated conception of their capabilities. It has also resulted in a considerable amount of confusion concerning the availability, membership in the Weimaraner Club, ownership, and in the mind of the amateur <b>dog</b> <b>fancier,</b> about their hunting ability and intelligence. Undoubtedly, small animal practitioners will be approached with questions concerning these problems, hence it is the purpose of this article to attempt to clarify these points...|$|E
