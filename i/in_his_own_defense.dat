5|$|The {{reactions}} to Robin No.181 included negative commentary from political commentator and scholar, Roderick Long, and Alan Grant himself. Among fans who interacted with Nicieza in a forum discussion, some responses were also negative, prompting responses from Nicieza <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>defense.</b>|$|E
5|$|Prior to his arrest, Chandler {{worked as}} an {{unlicensed}} aluminum-siding contractor. He testified <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>defense,</b> {{against the advice of}} his attorneys, saying that he had met the Ohio women and had given them directions, but that he never saw them again aside from in newspaper coverage and on the billboards set up by authorities. Police originally theorized that two men were involved in the murders, but this was discounted once Chandler was arrested. Following his conviction, Chandler was incarcerated at Union Correctional Institution, and, during his seventeen years of incarceration until his execution, he was notable for not having had a single visitor.|$|E
5|$|When Romero's {{committee}} intensifies its investigation, Underwood {{tries to}} divert their attention by ordering troops into Syria on {{the pretense of}} preventing a terrorist attack. This provokes Durant to testify against him; before she can take the stand, however, Underwood pushes her {{down a flight of}} stairs, incapacitating her. When Walker testifies about Underwood's role in the Chinese money laundering, Underwood takes the stand <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>defense</b> and stuns the committee by resigning the presidency. When Claire demands an explanation, Underwood reveals that his resignation was part of a plan to ensure that they control the country for years to come: Claire from the White House, he from the private sector. To tie up loose ends, he has Macallan and Harvey killed.|$|E
50|$|The next {{reason is}} that role {{reversal}} prevents the protagonist from being trapped <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>defenses.</b> Yablonsky provides another example about the fight within spouses. Through role reversal, the spouses change their positions with the other and then produce new insight of the whole interaction. This technique helps the protagonist to gain more understanding of a significant other rather than being stuck <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> perspective.|$|R

50|$|This reign {{also came}} to an end quick, Gómez being handed his 3rd loss at the hands of young Alfredo Layne by {{knockout}} in 9 rounds. Layne lost the title <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> first <b>defense</b> to South Africa's Brian Mitchell, and it became obvious Gómez's best years had gone by, so he retired after this fight.|$|R
5|$|The French {{position}} {{was such that}} they were able to lay down withering fire on the British forces as they advanced, and the abatis (a word that shares derivation with abattoir, or slaughterhouse) rapidly became a killing field. By about 2 pm, it was clear that the first wave of attack had failed. Montcalm was active on the battlefield, having removed his coat, and was moving among his men, giving encouragement and making sure all of their needs were being met. Abercrombie, who was reported by early historians like Francis Parkman and Thomas Mante to be at the sawmill (and thus well away from the action), was reported by his aide, James Abercrombie, to be near the rear of the lines by the La Chute River during much of the battle, and to have approached the front of the French lines at one point early in the battle. It is uncertain why, after the first wave of attack failed, Abercrombie persisted in ordering further attacks. Writing <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>defense,</b> he later claimed that he was relying on Clerk's assessment that the works could be easily taken; this was clearly refuted by the failure of the first charge.|$|E

25|$|The {{prosecution}} had {{originally intended to}} try both defendants together; however, the trial of Bobby Cherry was delayed due {{to the findings of}} a court-ordered psychiatric evaluation, which had concluded that vascular dementia had impaired his mind, therefore making Cherry mentally incompetent to stand trial or assist <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>defense.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 2000, when Kolbe {{found out}} about former Congressman Mark Foley's [...] "Internet {{communications}} with teenagers" [...] who were subordinate to Foley, he informed the office that oversaw the page program. He assumed the matter had been taken care of, although this was not brought to the public's attention until September 29, 2006, when it became public that Foley had sent sexually explicit and solicitative e-mails and instant messages to young adult male pages. Republican leaders had claimed that they had only recently been made aware of Foley's actions, despite Kolbe's actions. In January 2007, the Federal Election Commission committee ruled that Kolbe could use campaign funds for legal expenses associated with the Foley scandal.Former Senator Larry Craig cited this ruling in 2012 in defense against a lawsuit by the FEC regarding Craig's use of campaign funds <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> legal <b>defense.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{relief sought}} here is simple yet profoundly important. Mr. Almarri has been imprisoned in virtual {{isolation}} at the Naval Consolidated Brig (“the Brig”) {{for more than}} 1, 700 days and, if the government’s arguments elsewhere prevail, may well be held there {{for the rest of}} his life. Although the government has moderated to some extent Mr. Almarri’s brutal conditions since he filed this suit, he remains socially isolated and without meaningful family contact. The cumulative and continued effects of Mr. Almarri’s prolonged isolation are inflicting long-term mental harm and jeopardizing his ability to participate <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> legal <b>defense.</b> <b>In</b> a reasonable effort to mitigate this damage, and after counsel’s repeated attempts to address this issue with the government failed, Mr. Almarri filed this motion seeking regular and frequent phone calls with immediate family members, timely processing of his family mail, and increased access to news. Despite its access to Mr. Almarri, the government presents nothing to contradict the specific evidence of his actual mental decline. And the government fails to show these modest accommodations would impose a material burden on the government in general o...|$|R

25|$|In Griffin v. California (1965), the Supreme Court {{ruled that}} a {{prosecutor}} may not ask the jury to draw an inference of guilt from a defendant's refusal to testify <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>defense.</b> The Court overturned as unconstitutional under the federal constitution a provision of the California state constitution that explicitly granted such power to prosecutors.|$|E
25|$|In this case, the defendant's {{ability to}} {{understand}} {{the charges against him}} and his ability to assist <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>defense</b> was challenged on five separate occasions before and during his trial and sentencing for capital murder, but the trial judge ruled he was competent to stand trial because he did not meet Oklahoma's high standard of proof.|$|E
5000|$|If a {{defendant}} is found guilty, sentencing follows, often at a separate hearing after the prosecution, defense, and court have developed information based {{on which the}} judge will craft a sentence. The United States Sentencing Commission has promulgated guidance on what restitution and prison terms should be assessed for different crimes. [...] In capital cases, a separate [...] "penalty phase" [...] occurs, in which the jury determines whether to recommend {{that the death penalty}} should be imposed. As with the determination of guilt phase, the burden is on the prosecution to prove its case, and the defendant is entitled to take the stand <b>in</b> <b>his</b> or her <b>own</b> <b>defense,</b> and may call witnesses and present evidence.|$|R

25|$|Initial jury {{selection}} began on this date, and would continue until July 9.

25|$|Riggins {{appealed to}} the Nevada Supreme Court {{on the grounds that}} forced {{administration}} of Mellaril denied him the ability to assist <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>defense</b> and gave a false impression of his attitude, appearance, and demeanor at trial. Riggins claimed that the forced medication was not justified, as the State had not demonstrated a need to administer Mellaril nor did it explore less restrictive alternatives to giving him 800 milligrams of the drug each day. However, the Nevada Supreme Court affirmed Riggins' convictions and death sentence. Riggins then petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court.|$|E
25|$|Williams' {{trial began}} on January 6, 1982 in Fulton County. During the two-month trial, {{prosecutors}} matched nineteen different sources of fibers from Williams' home and car environment—his bedspread, bathroom, gloves, clothes, carpets, dog and an unusual tri-lobal carpet fiber—to {{a number of}} victims. Other evidence included eyewitness testimony placing Williams with several victims while they were alive, and inconsistencies in his accounts of his whereabouts. Williams took the stand <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>defense,</b> but alienated the jury by becoming angry and combative. After twelve hours of deliberation, the jury found him guilty on February 27 of the murders of Cater and Payne. He {{was sentenced to life}} imprisonment.|$|E

25|$|During {{a hearing}} on August 10, 2006, Haq {{surprised}} the court by indicating that he wished to enter a guilty plea on all charges. The judge refused to accept this plea before a competency hearing had been conducted. Additionally, experts consulted by the Seattle Post-Intelligencer expressed doubts as to whether Haq {{would be allowed to}} plead guilty at such an early point in the legal process because the prosecution had not yet decided whether Haq would face the death penalty. On August 16, C. Wesley Richards, Haq's attorney, told the court that Haq had changed his mind and chosen to plead not guilty. Additionally, Richards said that Haq was mentally competent to stand trial since he understood the charges against him and was capable of assisting <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>defense.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{trial began}} on 21 April 1924. It lasted about two weeks. Near {{the end of}} the trial, Overturf testified <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>defense.</b> He denied the charges, but {{admitted}} that several appraisals were higher than they should have been due to inaccurate measurements of the properties. In addition, Overturf testified that he had asked the veterans’ aid commission several times for instructions on how to prepare his appraisal, but had received no answer to his queries. The jury deliberated for twelve hours before finding Overturf and other defendants guilty of mail fraud. However, after the verdict the jury petitioned the judge for leniency in sentencing, recommending that Overturf and the others be given fines rather than prison sentences. The judge agreed, giving Overturf a $1,000 fine and the others three defendants $500 fines. Overturf paid his fine and did not appeal the outcome of the trial.|$|E
25|$|Nova is {{featured}} in the Marvel Zombies edition Dead Days. Unable to overcome his fear and horror of the slaughter occurring around him, Nova fails to act <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>defense</b> when Spider-Man attacks him. Fortunately for Nova, Daredevil intervenes but is bitten when Nova is too shocked to assist. He and Thor are rescued by the Fantastic Four and united with the other surviving heroes on the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier. Nova panics further when Nick Fury formulates a desperate last stand defense, citing that this was nothing like previous global threats; and {{that the world was}} as good as dead. Regardless, Nova helps in the battle until he is bitten by Ms. Marvel. As a zombie, he participates in a failed attack on Doctor Doom's castle, {{in an effort to get}} at the humans inside. A zombie version of Nova can be seen in the Marvel Zombies limited series, being shredded by a hail of metal fragments hurled by Magneto.|$|E
