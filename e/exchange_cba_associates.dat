Scalar KP, BKP and CKP hierarchies are considered as examples. There are different methods to construct integrable equations and to analyze their properties (see e. g. [1 - 4]). The ∂-dressing method proposed in [5] is, perhaps, {{one of the most}} effective of them. Recently, it has been applied successfully to several important problems in soliton theory (see e. g. [6 - 11]). In this letter we would like to attract an attention to one more profitable aspect of the ∂-dressing method. Namely, starting with ∂-problem and dual ∂-problem, we derive two important bilinear relations for the so-called Cauchy-Baker-Akhiezer (<b>CBA)</b> functions <b>associated</b> with different kernels R of the ∂-problem. These relations provide us simple variational relations for CBA functions and ∂-kernel R. In a simple unified manner, they generate integrable hierarchies in different parametrizations and corresponding bilinear Hirota identities. These bilinear relations are convenient also for analysis of different constraints. It is shown how scalar BKP and CKP hierarchies aris...|$|R
40|$|Currency board {{arrangements}} (CBAs) are a {{very strong}} form of fixed exchange rate regime. Like the gold standard, they rely on market forces, rather than on foreign exchange controls or interventions, to fix the <b>exchange</b> rate. <b>CBAs</b> have been adopted {{in a variety of}} institutional forms and with varying degrees of success in a number of economies. In theory, the classical CBA, which originated in the 19 th century, uses three anchors to fix the exchange rate: (i) economic discipline, because of the requirement that currency issues should be fully backed by foreign reserves; (ii) specie flow and interest arbitrage; and (iii) currency (cash) arbitrage, which binds the spot exchange rate. In practice, not all three anchors function effectively in every CBA. Regarding economic optimality, the case for or against CBAs is broadly similar to the debate on fixed versus floating exchange rate, but the link between the narrower monetary aggregate and the balance of payments in a CBA tends to be even closer than in other fixed rate regimes. Williamson (1995) has identified some advantages and disadvantages of CBAs. Insofar as a great deal of resources have been committed to CBAs to make them more credible and robust, they may have difficulty adjusting to major structural changes and irreversible divergence in the longer run. Modifying or abandoning them would carry very high adjustment cost or exit cost. In the extreme, total commitment begs the question of why the “dollarization ” option—replacing the home currency with the foreign currency to which it is pegged—was not adopted instead...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe aim of {{this trial}} was to compare cutting balloon {{angioplasty}} (CBA) with conventional balloon angioplasty (i. e., {{percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty}} [PTCA]) for the treatment of patients with coronary in-stent restenosis (ISR). BackgroundRetrospective studies suggest CBA might be superior to conventional PTCA in the treatment of ISR. MethodsThe Restenosis Cutting Balloon Evaluation Trial (RESCUT) is a multicenter, randomized, prospective European trial including 428 patients with all types of ISR (e. g., focal, multifocal, diffuse, proliferative). ResultsIn both groups, the majority of ISR lesions were shorter than 20 mm. The length of restenotic stents was similar (CBA: 18. 6 ± 9. 7 mm; PTCA: 18. 3 ± 8. 7 mm). The number of balloons used to treat ISR was lower in the CBA group: only one balloon was used in 82. 3 % of CBA cases, compared with 75 % of PTCA procedures (p = 0. 03). Balloon slippage was less frequent in the CBA group (CBA 6. 5 %, PTCA 25 %; p < 0. 01). There was a trend toward a lower need for additional stenting in the CBA group (CBA 3. 9 %, PTCA 8. 0 %; p = 0. 07). At seven-month angiographic follow-up, the binary restenosis rate was not different between the groups (CBA 29. 8 %, PTCA 31. 4 %; p = 0. 82), with a similar pattern of recurrent restenosis. Clinical events at seven months were also similar. ConclusionsCutting balloon angioplasty did not reduce recurrent ISR and major adverse cardiac events, as compared with conventional PTCA. However, <b>CBA</b> was <b>associated</b> with some procedural advantages, such as use of fewer balloons, less requirement for additional stenting, and a lower incidence of balloon slippage...|$|R

However, knowledge of WHAMM {{is limited to}} interphase somatic cells. In this study, we examined its localization and function in mouse oocytes during meiosis. Immunostaining showed that in the germinal vesicle (GV) stage, there was no WHAMM signal; after meiosis resumption, WHAMM {{was associated with the}} spindle at prometaphase I (Pro MI), metaphase I (MI), telophase I (TI) and metaphase II (MII) stages. Nocodazole and taxol treatments showed that WHAMM was localized around the MI spindle. Depletion of WHAMM by microinjection of specific short interfering (si) RNA into the oocyte cytoplasm resulted in failure of spindle migration, disruption of asymmetric cytokinesis and a decrease in the first polar body extrusion rate during meiotic maturation. Moreover, actin cap formation was also disrupted after WHAMM depletion, confirming the failure of spindle migration. Taken together, our data suggest that WHAMM is required for peripheral spindle migration and asymmetric cytokinesis during mouse oocyte maturation...|$|R

Therefore, in order to be effective, the <b>CBA</b> <b>exchanges</b> information or evidence to the public prosecutors who possess executive powers. Moreover, this division of the Polish government has a responsibility that extends from the detection of corruption to crime prevention. In order to reduce the occurrence of corruption, the CBA conducts preventative and educational activities with the assistance of non-governmental organisations and financial support from the European Union. The efforts to remove corruption have pushed Poland to increase international cooperation as global networking can result in the pooling and exchange of resources and knowledge. The Bureau currently has obtained permission from Poland’s Prime Minister to cooperate with 50 other countries and 11 international organisations to tackle corruption on both a national and global scale. The CBA continues to pursue its anti-corruption goal with its latest project, [...] "Rising of the Anticorruption Training System", whereby over the course of 3 years from 2013 - 2015, the CBA has been working closely with specialised law enforcements of Lithuania and Latvia. The project also consists of international anti-corruption training conferences whereby notable countries such as Norway and Denmark are able to share their high standard practices with Poland. Additionally, the project has also taken advantage of technology by launching an e-learning platform that is equipped with anti-corruption education tools and online activities. The online platform is a training course designed to educate the general public and Polish working in both the government and business sectors. The key objective of this online platform is to provide an easily accessible set of educational tools that increases public awareness of corruption and informs the necessary steps to assist with its prevention and detection.|$|R
40|$|The {{acute and}} {{permanent}} effects of noise exposure on the endocochlear potential (EP) and cochlear lateral wall were evaluated in BALB/cJ (BALB) inbred mice, and compared with CBA/J (CBA) and C 57 BL/ 6 (B 6) mice. Two-hour exposure to broadband noise (4 – 45  kHz) at 110  dB SPL {{leads to a}} ~ 50  mV reduction in the EP in BALB and CBA, but not B 6. EP reduction in BALB and <b>CBA</b> is reliably <b>associated</b> with characteristic acute cellular pathology in stria vascularis and spiral ligament. By 8  weeks after exposure, the EP in CBA mice has returned to normal. In BALBs, however, the EP remains depressed by an average ~ 10  mV, so that permanent EP reduction contributes to permanent threshold shifts in these mice. We recently showed that the CBA noise phenotype in part reflects {{the influence of a}} large effect quantitative trait locus on Chr. 18, termed Nirep (Ohlemiller et al., Hear Res 260 : 47 – 53, 2010 b). While CBA “EP susceptibility” alleles are dominant to those in B 6, examination of (B 6 [*]×[*]BALB) F 1 hybrid mice and (F 1 [*]×[*]BALB) N 2 backcross mice revealed that noise-related EP reduction and associated cell pathology in BALBs are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, and are dependent on multiple genes. Moreover, while N 2 mice formed from B 6 and CBA retain strong correspondence between acute EP reduction, ligament pathology, and strial pathology, N 2 s formed from B 6 and BALB include subsets that dissociate pathology of ligament and stria. We conclude that the genes and cascades that govern the very similar EP susceptibility phenotypes in BALB and CBA mice need not be the same. BALBs appear to carry alleles that promote more pronounced long term effects of noise on the lateral wall. Separate loci in BALBs may preferentially impact stria versus ligament...|$|R

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 115 patients after lumbar fusion, discectomy, or decompression {{were asked to respond to}} an ex post questionnaire on their WTP/WTA for their respective intervention. Additional questions addressed socio-demographics, household income, and clinical outcome. WTP/WTA was related to the actual intervention costs and clinical outcome. The WTP and cost data were then combined within a formal <b>CBA</b> framework with <b>associated</b> 95 % confidence intervals generated using bootstrapping methods. RESULTS: The response rate was 91. 3 % (n = 105). 89. 5 % were satisfied/very satisfied with the treatment. 76. 2 % found the result of the operation was good/excellent and 75. 7 % would choose the operation for a given hypothetical intervention cost. Mean stated WTP was 20 % lower than the actual operation costs (not known to respondents) for spinal fusion, although it was 37 % higher for discectomy and 10 % higher for decompression. The individuals' financial situation was the strongest predictor for WTP. Pain improvement, present pain, duration of hospitalization, and estimated intervention costs were significant independent predictors in the expected direction for the WTP, having controlled for socio-demographic and financial confounding variables. CONCLUSION: This study explored the feasibility of the CV approach for spinal interventions. The approach produced results suggesting positive net benefits with their associated levels of variability for discectomy and decompression, indicating that such surgery is cost-beneficial within a CBA framework, but this conclusion is not supported in the case of spinal fusion. Nevertheless, to improve reliability of the net-benefit estimates for these interventions, we recommend further studies comparing in particular ex ante and ex post WTP methods...|$|R

40|$|A {{critical}} {{review of the}} mechanisms of present water treatment systems including, chlorination, coagulation, filtration, granular and powdered activated carbon adsorption, ozonation and ultraviolet radiation {{for the removal of}} herbicides is presented. Rapid selective and sensitive HPLC methods were developed and rigorously validated for the analysis of the selected herbicides. Analysis of atrazine was made using Cl 8 cartridges. For raw water containing interferences, extraction of the compound was made on SCX cartridges, followed by solvent exchange on C 18 cartridges. A quantitative recovery of virtually 100 % of the compound was achieved using C 18. While the double cartridge extraction of the compound gave a recovery of about 89 %. Previously developed methods for 2, 4 -D and MCPA were rigorously validated for the extraction and analysis of 2, 4 -D and MCPA. A quantitative recovery of usually greater than 90 % was achieved for both compounds using Cl 8 cartridges. For the extraction of paraquat different extraction systems including, reversed phase on C 8 and C 18, ion-paired reversed phase on C 18, and cation <b>exchange</b> on SCX, <b>CBA,</b> and CN were investigated. A quantitative recovery, usually greater than 90 %, of the compound was obtained using CN and CBA cartridges. The methods were then successfully used for the evaluation of the removal efficiency and establishment of mechanisms of removal of herbicides by biological filters at bench and pilot scale. Four herbicides belonging to three broad chemical categories were studied. The data presented in this study demonstrated that biological filters are very efficient in removing certain classes of herbicides. 2, 4 -D and MCPA were consistently removed to below a detection limit of 0. 1 mug/ 1 for an influent concentration of 3 - 11 mug/ 1. Process variables such as flow rate, bed depth and contact time were investigated for the efficient removal of these herbicides. Seasonal variations in performance were observed and possible explanations proposed. A series of experiments was undertaken to establish. mechanisms of removal. Quantitative recovery of the herbicides from the river water proved that the processes in the filter bed as opposed to the processes in the water were responsible for removal of the herbicides. It was clear from the investigation of the adsorption of the herbicides both on the sand and organic and inorganic dirt that adsorption on these surfaces was not the main reason for removal. Filter maturation experiment showed that the presence of microorganisms in the bed is a precondition for the removal of herbicides. A depth experiment for the removal of 2, 4 -D showed that superficial efficient zone of removal imitates the distribution of microbial density. This evidence confirms the significance of microorganisms for the removal of herbicides by the filter bed. The ultimate proof of the biodegradation of 2, 4 -D by microorganisms in the filter bed was the identification of the biodegradation product 2 -chlorophenol as predicted by the metabolic pathways of the compound. Filter design modifications using activated carbon were made to accommodate the removal of 'non-biodegradable' herbicides. A sandwich sand / GAC / sand filter was investigated. Filter efficiency for this arrangement was determined and short-comings were identified and a possible solution {{in the form of a}} double GAC sandwich is suggested...|$|R
