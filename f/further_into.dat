5|$|A low {{pressure}} area developed off the Karnataka-Goa coastline in the Arabian Sea on May 27 and developed into a depression the next day.

The depression continued to move west, weakening to a remnant low shortly as it made landfall on the Arabian Peninsula on June 2. The remnant low dissipated over southern Saudi Arabia the next day.|$|E

5|$|After Operation Save, the {{division}} remained relatively static {{for more than}} three weeks, mopping up and repelling local Partisan attacks. The Muslims were impatient to push <b>further</b> <b>into</b> Bosnia, but the reconnaissance battalion was heavily engaged on {{the division}}al western flank, attacking positions held by the Partisan 3rd Vojvodina Brigade of the 36th Vojvodina Division at Gornji Rahić on 26 March, killing 124 Partisans and capturing 14. The battalion captured several more Partisan positions in the following week. In early April, 200 Partisans of the 16th Muslim Brigade surrendered to the division. They were mostly former members of various Muslim militias who had been conscripted into the ranks of the Partisans.|$|E

5|$|As Tropical Storm Dorothy moved <b>further</b> <b>into</b> the Caribbean Sea, {{it began}} a gradual {{weakening}} trend initiated by a persistent tropical upper tropospheric trough, {{as well as}} the presence of strong wind shear and a lack of inflow. Hurricane Hunter flights late on August21 and early on August22 failed to locate a closed low-level circulation, and as a result the storm was downgraded to a tropical depression. After another flight into the system could not detect a circulation, the NHC discontinued advisories on Dorothy to the south of Hispaniola late on August22. Around the same time, thunderstorms increased in association with the cyclone, and forecasters remarked the potential for re-intensification over the western Caribbean Sea. However, the storm became more disorganized, and on August23 Dorothy degenerated into a tropical wave.|$|E
5|$|At {{almost the}} same time as Chesapeake lost control of her helm, her fore-topsail halyard was shot away, her fore-topsail yard then dropped, and she 'luffed up'. Losing her forward momentum, she yawed <b>further</b> <b>into</b> the wind until she was 'in irons', her sails were pressed back against her masts and she then made {{sternway}} (went backwards). Her port stern quarter (rear left corner) made contact with Shannons starboard side, level with the fifth gunport from the bow, and Chesapeake was caught by the projecting fluke of one of Shannons anchors, which had been stowed on the gangway. Chesapeakes spanker boom then swung over the deck of the British ship. Mr Stevens, Broke's boatswain, lashed the boom inboard to keep the two ships together, and lost an arm as he did so.|$|E
