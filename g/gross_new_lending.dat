40|$|During {{the recent}} {{financial}} crisis Bank Rate was reduced sharply, {{but in general}} the interest rates charged on <b>new</b> <b>lending</b> to households did not fall by as much and indeed some interest rates rose. This article assesses the factors that have influenced <b>new</b> <b>lending</b> rates using a simple decomposition of <b>new</b> <b>lending</b> rates into lenders’ funding costs, credit risk charges and a residual (which includes both operating costs and the mark-up). Applying the decomposition to two indicative lending products suggests that funding costs have been an important driver of <b>new</b> <b>lending</b> rates and the residual has also risen. The residual needs to {{be interpreted with caution}} — by definition it reflects all the remaining unmodelled factors. But among other things, a larger residual is consistent with lenders increasing mark-ups over marginal costs for <b>new</b> <b>lending,</b> which may reflect a need to build higher capital levels within the banking sector. ...|$|R

40|$|We empirically {{examined}} whether declining {{bank loans}} in Japan {{in the late}} 1990 s {{are the result of}} banks' downward adjustments of lending supply (a "credit crunch") in response to capital losses (a "capital crunch"). Estimating the <b>new</b> <b>lending</b> supply function as a non-linear function of the capital to asset ratio, we found that the (<b>new</b> <b>lending</b> supply) function is not only increasing in bank capital but also concave in bank capital, which supports the view that a "credit crunch" occurs since forward-looking banks have an incentive to avoid failing to meet regulatory requirements in the future. ...|$|R

40|$|There {{was very}} little net <b>new</b> <b>lending</b> by U. S. banks to {{developing}} countries in 1983 - 84, following the heavy lending of preceding years. When non-spontaneous lending to Brazil, Mexico and some other Latin American countries is deducted, there was an absolute decline in U. S. banks' claims on these countries. However, estimates of net <b>new</b> <b>lending</b> based on charges in outstanding claims understate the amount of net <b>new</b> <b>lending</b> to these countries in 1983 - 84 by an amount {{on the order of}} $ 3 - 1 / 2 billion. This is because outstanding claims were reduced by a number of factors other than repayments; such factors included loan charge-offs, sales of claims to non-bank investors, the exercise of official guarantees, and the statistical effects of exchange rate charges. Other aspects of U. S. bank lending to develop countries in 1983 - 84 were an increased concentration of the outstanding claims at the largest banks, and an increased concentration of the claims towards the public sector of the borrowing countries. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{persistent}} {{debt crisis}} of mayor LDC-borrowers {{has led to}} various proposals on how to ease or even solve these problems. Most suggestions have in common that they concentrate on restructuring the old loans and suggest approaches to higher future lending. These proposals {{are based on the}} assumption that the debt burden accumulated in the past represents the main obstacle to <b>new</b> bank <b>lending</b> in the future. It has to be doubted, however, that debt relief in one form or another will be sufficient for generating <b>new</b> <b>lending.</b> The high debt burden constitutes only one reason for the reluctance of banks to provide fresh money voluntarily. A more fundamental reason may be related to the behavior of creditors and borrowers that lead to the present instability of the international credit market. This behavior is influenced by the institutional incentive structure prevailing in this market. <b>New</b> <b>lending</b> would, therefore, be conditional on an improved institutional framework in the international credit market. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a framework for understanding the lingering problem of soft budget constraints in many transition economies even after the macroeconomic situation has been stabilized and a sound banking system has been introduced. We show that soft budget constraints can persist and even coexist with credit crunches, as the existing evidence from transition economies seems to indicate. As in Dewatripont and Maskin (Credit and efficiency in centralized and decentralized economies, Review of Economic Studies, 1995), the existence of sunk costs in existing loans may also give rise to soft budget constraints when banks themselves are subject to hard budget constraints and have outside options. We endogenize the outside option by allowing banks to allocate available funds between <b>new</b> <b>lending</b> and refinancing of old loans. The option to invest in <b>new</b> <b>lending</b> hardens budget constraints when the average quality of investment projects is high and varied. Otherwise soft budget constraints may persist. In the latter case, refinancing of old loans crowds out new finance, giving rise to credit crunches on new loans. By screening and monitoring firms banks can improve the relative profitability of <b>new</b> <b>lending</b> and break out of soft budget constraint equilibria. Unlike Dewatripont and Maskin, larger banks may be harder than smaller banks {{because they have the}} resources and higher incentives to invest in screening and monitoring. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.

50|$|Recent Financial Services Authority {{guidelines}} to UK lenders regarding interest-only mortgages has tightened the criteria on <b>new</b> <b>lending</b> on an interest-only basis.

40|$|This paper {{documents}} that new loans to large borrowers fell by 37 % {{during the peak}} period {{of the financial crisis}} (September-November 2008) relative to the prior three-month period and by 68 % relative to the peak of the credit boom (Mar-May 2007). <b>New</b> <b>lending</b> for real investment (such as capital expenditures) fell to the same extent as <b>new</b> <b>lending</b> for restructuring (LBOs, M&A, share repurchases). Banks that have access to deposit financing cut their lending less than banks with less access to deposit financing. In addition, there is a large overhang of revolving credit facilities, which may also have curtailed lending. We document an increase in drawdowns of revolving credit facilities. Many of these drawdowns were undertaken by low credit quality firms concerned about their access to funding. While helpful to these borrowers, they may limit the ability of banks to make other loans. Banks with more revolving lines outstanding relative to deposits reduced their lending more than those with less revolving line exposure...|$|R
