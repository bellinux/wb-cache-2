5|$|It is, I believe, universally {{agreed that}} the only way to keep Indians from harassing the country is to visit them. But we find, by experience, that burning their empty towns has not the desired effect. They can soon build others. They must be {{followed}} up and beaten, or the British, whom they draw their support from, totally driven out of their country. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>if</b> Detroit was demolished, it would be a good step toward giving some, at least, temporary ease to this country.|$|E
500|$|Early on, Young {{established}} himself {{as one of the}} harder-throwing pitchers in the game. Bill James wrote that Zimmer often put a piece of beefsteak inside his baseball glove to protect his catching hand from Young's fastball. In the absence of radar guns, however, it is impossible to say just how hard Young actually threw. Young continued to perform at a high level during the 1890 season. On {{the last day of the}} season, Young won both games of a doubleheader. In the first weeks of Young's career, Cap Anson, the player-manager of the Chicago Colts spotted Young's ability. Anson told Spiders' manager Gus Schmelz, [...] "He's too green to do your club much good, but <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>if</b> I taught him what I know, I might make a pitcher out of him in a couple of years. He's not worth it now, but I'm willing to give you $1,000 ($ today) for him." [...] Schmelz replied, [...] "Cap, you can keep your thousand and we'll keep the rube." ...|$|E
500|$|One {{method was}} by {{introducing}} overarching themes that individual episodes could be tied to, such as [...] "The Pattern" [...] in Season 1, providing information repeatedly about the larger plot {{over the course}} of several episodes or seasons. Abrams also created characters whose alliances to the larger narrative were clear, avoiding a similar problem that had occurred during the first and second seasons of Alias. [...] A final step taken was to script out all of the major long-running plot elements, including the show's finale, prior to full-time production. [...] Abrams contrasted this to the process used in Lost, where ideas like character flashbacks and the hatch from the second season were introduced haphazardly and made difficulties in defining when they should be presented to the viewers. Instead, with Fringe, they were able to create [...] "clearly defined goalposts" [...] (in Itzkoff's words) that could be altered as necessary with network and seasonal changes but always provided a clear target for the overarching plot. These approaches also allowed the team to introduce unique plot elements to be introduced in time that would have altered the show's fate if known at the start. Abrams stated that [...] "There are certain details that are hugely important that <b>I</b> <b>believe,</b> <b>if</b> shared, will destroy any chance of actually getting on the air." [...] Abrams noted that they are able to benefit from [...] "how open Fox as a network has been to a show that is embracing the weirdness and the long-term stories that we want to tell". During the third season, executive producer Jeff Pinkner noted that [...] "We have six to eight seasons worth of material. We see it as having certain chapters that would enrich the overall story, but aren't necessary to tell the overall story. God willing, the network allows us the time to tell our complete story." ...|$|E

Or, at any rate, that I should? Don't you bother about the war. It's all right, or as right as {{it is likely to be}} for many a long day." ...|$|R

2500|$|On July 7, 2006, Angelides {{expressed}} {{his support for}} gay rights, and pledged to legalize same-sex marriage if elected governor, stating [...] "I would sign the marriage equality bill because <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>if</b> we can get behind people to build a lasting relationship, {{that is a good}} thing." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although Dorgan had {{indicated}} in early 2008 he would seek a fourth {{term in the}} Senate, on January 5, 2010, he issued a statement announcing he would not run for re-election. In it, he insisted that the [...] "...decision [...] not a reflection of any dissatisfaction with my work in the Senate, nor [...] it connected to a potential election contest [...] (frankly, <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>if</b> I were to run for another term I would be reelected)." [...] He gave his Senate farewell speech on December 9, 2010.|$|E
2500|$|Police {{said that}} the handgun Belcher used that murdered his girlfriend was {{different}} from the one he used to kill himself. Both were legally owned, but {{he did not have a}} permit to carry a concealed weapon. Belcher had other guns at his house, some of which he used to go to the shooting range. The day after the shooting, NBC broadcaster Bob Costas, quoting Jason Whitlock, said during a segment of Sunday Night Football that [...] "in the coming days, Jovan Belcher's actions and their possible connection to football will be analyzed. Who knows? But here, wrote Jason Whitlock, is what <b>I</b> <b>believe.</b> <b>If</b> Jovan Belcher didn't possess a gun, he and Kasandra Perkins would both be alive today." [...] The comments prompted criticism and support from both sides of the gun control issue. Nine other current or former NFL players have also killed themselves since 2011: Dave Duerson, Ray Easterling, Junior Seau, Kurt Crain, O.J. Murdock, Mike Current, Paul Oliver, Adrian Robinson, and Aaron Hernandez. [...] With the exceptions of Robinson and Hernandez, each of these players died of self-inflicted gunshot wounds.|$|E

60|$|There {{were still}} two persons at our disposal. Lady Rachel might help us, as <b>I</b> <b>believed,</b> <b>if</b> {{she chose to}} do it. As for old Toller, I {{suggested}} (on reflection) that the lawyer should examine him. The lawyer declined to waste any more of my money. I called again on Lady Rachel. This time, I was let in. I found the noble lady smoking a cigarette and reading a French novel.|$|R
