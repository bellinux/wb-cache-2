5|$|Barrier {{contraceptives}} are {{devices that}} attempt to prevent pregnancy by physically preventing sperm from entering the uterus. They include male condoms, female condoms, cervical caps, <b>diaphragms,</b> and contraceptive sponges with spermicide.|$|E
5|$|James Hargreaves (1834–1915) was {{a chemist}} and inventor, who, along with Thomas Bird, {{developed}} {{a process for}} the electrolysis of brine using asbestos <b>diaphragms.</b> In 1899, he became director of the newly opened General Electrolytic Alkali Company at Middlewich.|$|E
5|$|Contraceptive sponges {{combine a}} barrier with a spermicide. Like <b>diaphragms,</b> they are {{inserted}} vaginally before intercourse {{and must be}} placed over the cervix to be effective. Typical failure rates {{during the first year}} depend on whether or not a woman has previously given birth, being 24% in those who have and 12% in those who have not. The sponge can be inserted up to 24hours before intercourse and must be left in place for at least six hours afterward. Allergic reactions and more severe adverse effects such as toxic shock syndrome have been reported.|$|E
40|$|The {{proposal}} {{describes a}} pressure sensor {{which has a}} <b>diaphragm</b> held by a support, said <b>diaphragm</b> comprising a <b>diaphragm</b> reinforcement area mainly arranged in the middle, the thickness measurement of which {{is greater than the}} thickness measurement of the <b>diaphragm,</b> and an electrical converting device which converts a mechanical deformation of the <b>diaphragm</b> into a change in electrical parameter. The pressure sensor is characterized {{by the fact that the}} <b>diaphragm</b> has two further <b>diaphragm</b> reinforcement areas each having a larger thickness measurement than that of the <b>diaphragm,</b> said <b>diaphragm</b> reinforcement areas being spaced from the edge of the <b>diaphragm</b> and arranged in such a way that the first central <b>diaphragm</b> reinforcement area is situated between the two other <b>diaphragm</b> reinforcement areas, and at least one electrical converting device is arranged in an area of the <b>diaphragm</b> between the <b>diaphragm</b> reinforcement areas and/or between the <b>diaphragm</b> edge and the adjacent <b>diaphragm</b> reinfo rcement area...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the modeling of a polyimide <b>diaphragm</b> for an optical pulse pressure sensor. Polyimide {{is a type}} of polymer materials that possessed low linear coefficient of thermal expansion and has good thermal stability. The polyimide <b>diaphragm</b> has been designed and its performance is analyzed in terms of <b>diaphragm</b> deflection, <b>diaphragm</b> pressure sensitivity and <b>diaphragm</b> resonance frequency. Two design parameters namely <b>diaphragm</b> radius and <b>diaphragm</b> thickness are varied to study the <b>diaphragm</b> performance. It can be concluded that the modeled micro-diaphragm with a <b>diaphragm</b> radius of 90 Î¼m and <b>diaphragm</b> thickness of 4 Î¼m respectively has satisfied the maximum allowable deflection and operated in optimum frequency response...|$|R
30|$|Ventilator-induced <b>diaphragm</b> {{dysfunction}} {{is thought}} to result from <b>diaphragm</b> inactivity and/or dyssynchronous eccentric <b>diaphragm</b> contractions during mechanical ventilation [1, 2]. The magnitude of <b>diaphragm</b> disuse {{and the frequency of}} eccentric contractions and their impact on <b>diaphragm</b> function remains uncertain.|$|R
5|$|In {{patients}} of normal intelligence, rumination {{is not an}} intentional behavior and is habitually reversed using diaphragmatic breathing to counter the urge to regurgitate. Alongside reassurance, explanation and habit reversal, patients are shown how to breathe using their <b>diaphragms</b> prior to and during the normal rumination period. A similar breathing pattern {{can be used to}} prevent normal vomiting. Breathing in this method works by physically preventing the abdominal contractions required to expel stomach contents.|$|E
5|$|Several {{methods of}} {{contraception}} involve the cervix. Cervical <b>diaphragms</b> are reusable, firm-rimmed plastic devices inserted {{by a woman}} prior to intercourse that cover the cervix. Pressure against {{the walls of the}} vagina maintain the position of the diaphragm, and it acts as a physical barrier to prevent the entry of sperm into the uterus, preventing fertilisation. Cervical caps are a similar method, although they are smaller and adhere to the cervix by suction. <b>Diaphragms</b> and caps are often used in conjunction with spermicides. In one year, 12% of women using the diaphragm will undergo an unintended pregnancy, and with optimal use this falls to 6%. Efficacy rates are lower for the cap, with 18% of women undergoing an unintended pregnancy, and 10–13% with optimal use. Most types of progestogen-only pills are effective as a contraceptive because they thicken cervical mucus making it difficult for sperm to pass along the cervical canal. In addition, they may also sometimes prevent ovulation. In contrast, contraceptive pills that contain both oestrogen and progesterone, the combined oral contraceptive pills, work mainly by preventing ovulation. They also thicken cervical mucus and thin the lining of the uterus enhancing their effectiveness.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, Mary Dennett focused {{her efforts}} on the peace movement, but she {{returned}} to the birth control movement in 1918. She continued to lead the NBCL, and collaborated with Sanger's NYWPC. In 1919, Dennett published a widely distributed educational pamphlet, The Sex Side of Life, which treated sex as a natural and enjoyable act. However, in the same year, frustrated with the NBCL's chronic lack of funding, Dennett broke away and formed the Voluntary Parenthood League (VPL). Both Dennett and Sanger proposed legislative changes that would legalize birth control, but they took different approaches: Sanger endorsed contraception but only under a physician's supervision; Dennett pushed for unrestricted access to contraception.Engelman, pp. 113–115. Sanger, a proponent of <b>diaphragms,</b> was concerned that unrestricted access would result in ill-fitting <b>diaphragms</b> and would lead to medical quackery.McCann (1994), pp. 71–72 gives examples that show Sanger's fears were justified. Dennett was concerned that requiring women to get prescriptions from physicians would prevent poor women from receiving contraception, and she was concerned about a shortage of physicians trained in birth control. Both legislative initiatives failed, partly because some legislators felt that fear of pregnancy {{was the only thing that}} kept women chaste. In the early 1920s, Sanger's leadership position in the movement solidified because she gave frequent public lectures, and because she took steps to exclude Dennett from meetings and events.|$|E
2500|$|The term <b>diaphragm</b> in anatomy {{can refer}} to other flat {{structures}} such as the urogenital <b>diaphragm</b> or pelvic <b>diaphragm,</b> but [...] "the diaphragm" [...] generally refers to the thoracic <b>diaphragm.</b> In humans, the <b>diaphragm</b> is slightly asymmetric—its right half is higher up (superior) to the left half, since the large liver rests beneath the right half of the <b>diaphragm.</b> There is also a theory that the <b>diaphragm</b> is lower {{on the other side}} due to the presence of the heart.|$|R
40|$|A MEMS-based silicon {{pressure}} sensor for the ocean environment is presented. The invention is a multiple <b>diaphragm</b> piezoresistive {{pressure sensor}} {{for measuring the}} pressure of a liquid, comprising an inner deformable <b>diaphragm</b> formed on a silicon substrate, the inner deformable <b>diaphragm</b> having a first thickness an outer deformable <b>diaphragm</b> formed on the silicon substrate, the outer deformable <b>diaphragm</b> having a second thickness which {{is greater than the}} first thickness, positioned below the inner deformable <b>diaphragm</b> to support the inner deformable <b>diaphragm,</b> a first piezoresistive bridge embedded in the inner deformable <b>diaphragm,</b> a second piezoresistive bridge embedded in the outer deformable <b>diaphragm</b> and possibly a third piezoresistive bridge embedded in the silicon substrate to compensate for temperature variations...|$|R
30|$|The {{finite element}} {{software}} is employed {{to calculate the}} stresses of the cymbal slotted <b>diaphragm</b> and the slotted flat <b>diaphragm.</b> When the frequency of alternating pressure load applied on them is 10  Hz and {{the magnitude of the}} load is 10  kPa, cymbal slotted <b>diaphragm</b> has its maximum Von-Mises stress which is 0.036  kPa, and the slotted flat <b>diaphragm</b> is 0.249  kPa. That is, the cymbal slotted <b>diaphragm</b> is smaller than the slotted flat <b>diaphragm</b> in stress, so the cymbal slotted <b>diaphragm</b> has a high reliability.|$|R
5|$|The {{cervical}} canal is {{a passage}} through which sperm must travel to fertilize an egg cell after sexual intercourse. Several methods of contraception, including cervical caps and cervical <b>diaphragms</b> aim to block or prevent {{the passage of}} sperm through the cervical canal. Cervical mucus is used in several methods of fertility awareness, such as the Creighton model and Billings method, due to its changes in consistency throughout the menstrual period. During vaginal childbirth, the cervix must flatten and dilate to allow the fetus to progress along the birth canal. Midwives and doctors use {{the extent of the}} dilation of the cervix to assist decision-making during childbirth.|$|E
5|$|The most {{effective}} methods {{are those that}} are long acting and do not require ongoing health care visits. Surgical sterilization, implantable hormones, and intrauterine devices all have first-year failure rates of less than 1%. Hormonal contraceptive pills, patches or vaginal rings, and the lactational amenorrhea method (LAM), if used strictly, can also have first-year (or for LAM, first-6-month) failure rates of less than 1%. With typical use first-year failure rates are considerably high, at 9%, due to incorrect usage. Other methods such as condoms, <b>diaphragms,</b> and spermicides have higher first-year failure rates even with perfect usage. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends long acting reversible birth control as first line for young people.|$|E
5|$|By 1938, over 400 {{contraceptive}} manufacturers were in business, over 600 {{brands of}} female contraceptives were available, and industry revenues exceeded $250million per year. Condoms {{were sold in}} vending machines in some public restrooms, and men spent twice as much on condoms as on shaving.Tone, p. 136. Although condoms had become commonplace in the 1930s, feminists in the movement felt that birth control should be the woman's prerogative, and they continued to push for development of a contraceptive that was under the woman's control, a campaign which ultimately led to the birth control pill decades later. To increase the availability of high-quality contraceptives, birth control advocates established the Holland–Rantos company to manufacture contraceptives– primarily <b>diaphragms,</b> which were Sanger's recommended method. By the 1930s, the diaphragm with spermicidal jelly had become the most commonly prescribed form of contraception; in 1938, female contraceptives accounted for 85 percent of annual contraceptive sales.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the modeling of an optical <b>diaphragm</b> behavior for human pulse pressure detection. In this study, {{the comparison between}} {{the performance of the}} polyimide and silicon nitride <b>diaphragm</b> has be analyzed. The effect of <b>diaphragm's</b> radius and thickness on static and frequency response are also investigated. The findings show that the polyimide <b>diaphragm</b> is more sensitive than the silicon nitride <b>diaphragm.</b> The radius of the polyimide <b>diaphragm</b> has more effect on the deflection, sensitivity, and resonance frequency as compared to the <b>diaphragm's</b> thickness. It can be concluded that the polyimide <b>diaphragm</b> achieves the optimum performance in term of the deflection, sensitivity, and resonant frequency for human pulse pressure detection...|$|R
50|$|<b>Diaphragm</b> eventration is {{typically}} repaired thoracoscopically, by {{a technique called}} plication of the <b>diaphragm.</b> Plication basically involves a folding of the eventrated <b>diaphragm</b> which is then sutured in order to “take up the slack” of the excess <b>diaphragm</b> tissue.|$|R

5|$|The most {{effective}} methods {{of birth control}} are sterilization by means of vasectomy in males and tubal ligation in females, intrauterine devices (IUDs), and implantable birth control. This {{is followed by a}} number of hormone-based methods including oral pills, patches, vaginal rings, and injections. Less effective methods include physical barriers such as condoms, <b>diaphragms</b> and birth control sponges and fertility awareness methods. The least effective methods are spermicides and withdrawal by the male before ejaculation. Sterilization, while highly effective, is not usually reversible; all other methods are reversible, most immediately upon stopping them. Safe sex practices, such as with the use of male or female condoms, can also help prevent sexually transmitted infections. Other methods of birth control do not protect against sexually transmitted diseases. Emergency birth control can prevent pregnancy if taken within the 72 to 120 hours after unprotected sex. Some argue not having sex as a form of birth control, but abstinence-only sex education may increase teenage pregnancies if offered without birth control education, due to non-compliance.|$|E
5|$|The {{practice}} {{of birth control}} was common throughout the U.S. prior to 1914, when the movement to legalize contraception began. Longstanding techniques included the rhythm method, withdrawal, <b>diaphragms,</b> contraceptive sponges, condoms, prolonged breastfeeding, and spermicides. Use of contraceptives increased throughout the nineteenth century, contributing to a 50 percent drop in the fertility rate in the United States between 1800 and 1900, particularly in urban regions. The only known survey conducted {{during the nineteenth century}} of American women's contraceptive habits was performed by Clelia Mosher from 1892 to 1912. The survey was based on a small sample of upper-class women, and shows that most of the women used contraception (primarily douching, but also withdrawal, rhythm, condoms and pessaries) and that they viewed sex as a pleasurable act that could be undertaken without the goal of procreation.Engelman, pp. 11–12.|$|E

3000|$|A large {{majority}} of patients mechanically ventilated for at least 5  days exhibit <b>diaphragm</b> dysfunction {{at some point during}} their ICU stay. <b>Diaphragm</b> dysfunction presents many different patterns in these patients, comprising <b>diaphragm</b> dysfunction on admission and ICU-acquired <b>diaphragm</b> dysfunction.

40|$|Piston <b>diaphragm</b> {{pumps are}} used world-wide to {{transport}} abrasive and/or aggressive slurries against high discharge pressures in the mining, mineral processing and power industries. Limitation of excessive deformation of the <b>diaphragm</b> {{is of utmost}} importance for eliminating fatigue failures of the <b>diaphragm</b> and thereby obtaining a high reliability of the piston <b>diaphragm</b> pump. The deformation shape of the <b>diaphragm</b> {{is the result of}} a complex 2 -way Fluid Structure Interaction (FSI) mechanism within the pump chamber between the propelling fluid, the <b>diaphragm</b> and the pumped slurry. The understanding of this FSI mechanism has improved in the last decades but is still limited. Load and deformation analysis of the <b>diaphragm</b> is currently based quasi-static assumptions. This is however an over-simplification, especially for the larger piston <b>diaphragm</b> pumps used in the mining and mineral processing industries. In these applications, fluid momentum loading by both convective as well as unsteady fluid acceleration become important to consider. For improved analysis of the <b>diaphragm</b> deformation a numerical model is required. The objective of this study is therefore: Development of an experimentally validated numerical Fluid-Structure-Interaction model for the prediction of, operating condition induced, <b>diaphragm</b> deformation in piston <b>diaphragm</b> pump...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyzed}} {{a statistical}} model of <b>diaphragm</b> motion using regular {{principal component analysis}} (PCA) and generalized N-dimensional PCA (GND-PCA). First, we generate 4 D MRI of respiratory motion from 2 D MRI using an intersection profile method.

In order to build a general statistical model of <b>diaphragm</b> motion, we normalize the <b>diaphragm</b> motion in time and spatial domains and evaluate the <b>diaphragm</b> motion model of 10 healthy subjects by applying regular PCA and GND-PCA. We also validate the results using the leave-one-out method. The {{results show that the}} first three principal components of regular PCA contain more than 98 % of the total variation of <b>diaphragm</b> motion. However, validation using leave-one-out method gives up to 5. 0 [*]mm mean of error for right <b>diaphragm</b> motion and 3. 8 [*]mm mean of error for left <b>diaphragm</b> motion. Model analysis using GND-PCA provides about 1 [*]mm margin of error and is able to reconstruct the <b>diaphragm</b> model by fewer samples...|$|R

30|$|The <b>diaphragm</b> is {{the primary}} {{respiratory}} muscle. It has a complex structure and function. Contraction of the peripheral <b>diaphragm</b> musculature results in a cranio-caudal movement of the central fibrous parts [1]. Decreased <b>diaphragm</b> movement is seen in central neurological diseases, motor neuron diseases, and in traumatic injuries to the phrenic nerve [2, 3]. Pulmonary conditions such as pleural effusion [4], {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) [5, 6], and interstitial lung diseases [7] also affect <b>diaphragm</b> function. Symptoms of <b>diaphragm</b> dysfunction are often non-specific. Patients may suffer from acute hypercapnic respiratory failure, unexplained dyspnea, prolonged weaning from mechanic ventilation, recurrent pneumonia, or they may be asymptomatic with elevation of the <b>diaphragm</b> as an incidental finding on conventional chest X-ray images [8]. The non-specific nature of symptoms and wide spectrum of causal diseases emphasize the need for a feasible and accurate diagnostic method in <b>diaphragm</b> dysfunction. Ultrasonography can be used to evaluate <b>diaphragm</b> movement, <b>diaphragm</b> thickness, and thickening [9, 10].|$|R
40|$|Tutorialpg. 207 The {{application}} of <b>diaphragm</b> pumps for metering and conveying the fluids are continuously expanding {{because they provide}} zero-leakage, can run dry, have superior efficiency, offer high reliability, maximize safety and minimize maintenance.

The <b>diaphragm</b> design and the various influences on endurance and reliability are evaluated. Among others: material selection, the <b>diaphragm</b> motive system, the pump head/diaphragm, and installation/diaphragm interactions, <b>diaphragm</b> clamping, sandwich <b>diaphragm</b> design, computation of stresses and fatigue for both metal and PTFE <b>diaphragm.</b> Objectives or further optimization of <b>diaphragm</b> designs and comments about economy, performance and reliability close the discussion...|$|R

25|$|The {{degree of}} flexing and the {{material}} constituting the diaphragm affects the maintenance life of the equipment. Generally stiff metal <b>diaphragms</b> may only displace a few cubic centimeters of volume because the metal can not endure large degrees of flexing without cracking, but the stiffness of a metal diaphragm allows it to pump at high pressures. Rubber or silicone <b>diaphragms</b> are capable of enduring deep pumping strokes of very high flexion, but their low strength limits their use to low-pressure applications, {{and they need to}} be replaced as plastic embrittlement occurs.|$|E
