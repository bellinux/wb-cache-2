5|$|Kiep {{became a}} member of the CDU in the fall of 1961, gaining a seat in the county council of Obertaunus in 1963. Following the 1965 federal election, he {{became a member}} of the Bundestag, winning a mandate in the Obertaunus constituency. He {{retained}} his seat in 1969 and 1972, this time as part of his party's electoral list in Hessen. In 1972, Kiep was one of only a few CDU parliamentarians who voted yes to the Basic Treaty (Grundlagenvertrag) between West and East Germany. Other supporters of Willy Brandt's Ostpolitik were Richard von Weizsäcker, Karl Carstens and Olaf von Wrangel. During the 1972 federal elections, Kiep was named as prospective Federal Minister of <b>Economic</b> <b>Cooperation</b> <b>and</b> <b>Development</b> in the shadow cabinet of Rainer Barzel. He left parliament on 24 February 1976 to join the state government in Lower Saxony. During his tenure as minister, he also held a seat in the Landtag of Lower Saxony from 1978 to 1980. He regained a seat in the Bundestag following the 1980 election, entering through a place on the electoral list for Lower Saxony. In order to concentrate on his role as leading candidate in his home state of Hamburg, he once again left parliament on 26 April 1982.|$|E

25|$|The Millennium Summit Declaration was, however, {{only part}} of the origins of the MDGs.

A series of UN‑led {{conferences}} in the 1990s focused on issues such as children, nutrition, human rights and women. The OECD criticized major donors for reducing their levels of Official Development Assistance (ODA). UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan signed a report titled, We the Peoples: The Role of the United Nations in the 21st Century. The OECD had formed its International Development Goals (IDGs). The two efforts were combined for the World Bank's 2001 meeting to form the MDGs.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT This article {{discusses}} how the Organisation for <b>Economic</b> <b>Cooperation</b> <b>and</b> <b>Development’s</b> Centre for Educational Research and Innovation (CERI) {{addresses the}} task of conducting international policy research. The article begins with a descriptive account of CERI’s work, including the way member countries shape the research agenda. Several issues which relate to how research evidence is compiled within an international context are addressed. First, why the supposed priority area of lifelong learning is only weakly supported by systematic research is considered. The author {{raises the question of}} how we are to judge the quality and impact of international research work, especially where it is policy-related. He suggests that an increasing focus on the outcomes of education raises questions about causality in a policy research context. This leads to some brief consideration of evaluation of research, and of the country as a unit of methodological analysis. Finally, he asks what might be meant by learning from international experience. Cross-national education research is carried out by a number of international organisations, as well as by individuals and units working within national boundaries. In this article I examine, from the inside, the role played by one such international unit, the Organisation for <b>Economic</b> <b>Cooperation</b> <b>and</b> <b>Development’s</b> Centre for Educational Research and Innovation, where I worked for fou...|$|R
30|$|The {{increased}} {{focus on}} attitudes can be seen, for example, in the Organization for <b>Economic</b> <b>Cooperation</b> <b>and</b> <b>Development’s</b> (OECD) Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) in three domains: reading, mathematics, and science. In the lifespan of the PISA research, discussions about science education have been wide ranging, and {{the purposes of}} science education have also been redefined and broadened (OECD 2006). The willingness to engage in science-related issues is important not only {{with regard to the}} choice of educational pathways and careers but also with regard to the role of being a reflective citizen.|$|R

25|$|GIZ mainly {{operates}} {{on behalf of}} the Federal Ministry for <b>Economic</b> <b>Cooperation</b> <b>and</b> <b>Development</b> (BMZ). At the national level, GIZ, however, is also commissioned by other government departments, e.g. the Federal Foreign Office, the Federal Ministry for the Environment (BMUB), or the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi), as well as by German states and municipalities. At the international level, GIZ cooperates with the European Union, UN agencies, other international institutions such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFFATM), and foreign governments. The cooperation with private enterprises is an emerging field, promoted under the name of sustainable development. The GIZ is set up with International Services (IS) and the Public Private Partnership (PPP) in this area.|$|E
25|$|Over the years, {{government}} {{budget cuts}} {{have taken their}} toll. Israel was amongst the top-ranked nations in international rankings for science and mathematics performance in the 1960s, but dropped to 33 out of 41 nations in the 2002 survey. Wages for Israeli teachers are low compared to other industrialized countries, especially due to {{the small amount of}} frontal teaching hours with respect to other developed countries (the salary per hour {{is similar to that of}} the OECD standards), according to a survey of the Organization for <b>Economic</b> <b>Cooperation</b> <b>and</b> <b>Development.</b> The government-appointed Dovrat Commission, led by Shlomo Dovrat, concluded in 2004, that the key to improving Israeli education is not more money but better-quality teaching. The recommendations included a reform giving school principals the right to fire teachers of poor quality, and reward better ones with higher pay. These moves have been blocked by Israel's teachers' unions, which have paralyzed schools with a series of long strikes, mostly blocking the proposed reforms.|$|E
25|$|Total US {{investment}} in venture capital amounted to US$48.3 billion in 2014, for 4 356 deals.

The Organisation for <b>Economic</b> <b>Cooperation</b> <b>and</b> <b>Development</b> estimates that venture capital {{investment in}} the United States had fully recovered by 2014 to pre-recession levels. The National Venture Capital Association has reported that, in 2014, venture capital {{investment in the}} life sciences was at its highest level since 2008: in biotechnology, $6.0 billion was invested in 470 deals and, in life sciences overall, $8.6 billion in 789 deals (including biotechnology and medical devices). Two-thirds (68%) of the investment in biotechnology went to first-time/early-stage development deals and the remainder to the expansion stage of development (14%), seed-stage companies (11%) and late-stage companies (7%). However, it was the software industry which invested in {{the greatest number of}} deals overall: 1 799, for an investment of $19.8 billion. Second came internet-specific companies, garnering US$11.9 billion in investment through 1 005 deals. Many of these companies are based in the State of California, which alone concentrates 28% of US research.|$|E
