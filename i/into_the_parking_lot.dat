While in the storyline Triple H said he had done it in order to shield Austin from the WWF Championship and end his career, in reality Austin's previous neck injuries started bothering him again, forcing him to have surgery. In November 2000, Triple H and Austin had a match at Survivor Series that ended when Triple H tried to trick Austin into coming <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> <b>lot</b> to run him over again, only to have Austin lift his car up with a forklift and flip the car onto its roof 10feet high. Triple H returned a few weeks later to attack Austin, and their feud continued into 2001 and ended in a Three Stages of Hell match in which Triple H defeated Austin. In 2001, Triple H also feuded with The Undertaker, who defeated him at WrestleMania X-Seven. The night after WrestleMania, Triple H interfered in a steel cage match between Austin (who had just won the WWF Championship) and The Rock where he joined forces with Austin and double teamed on The Rock, forming a tag team called The Two-Man Power Trip. Triple H then defeated Chris Jericho for his third Intercontinental Championship on the April 5 SmackDown!, and won it for a fourth time two weeks later by defeating Jeff Hardy. Triple H then became a world tag team champion by winning the WWF Tag Team Championship {{for the first time at}} Backlash when he and Austin defeated Kane and The Undertaker in a [...] "Winner Take All" [...] tag team match.

With five 6A high schools to serve, Veterans Memorial Stadium is unable to fully handle the load, leading to numerous Thursday football games. Events at Veterans Memorial, in turn, increase traffic and congestion at the neighboring CCISD facilities and residential area. Stadium <b>parking</b> overflows <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> <b>lots</b> at Clear Creek High School, Clear Creek Intermediate, the CCISD Education Support Center, and neighboring businesses and residences.
