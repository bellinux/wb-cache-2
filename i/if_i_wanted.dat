25|$|Speaking {{before the}} opening of the Ordinary Synod of Bishops on the Family in October 2015, McAleese {{ridiculed}} the concept of 300 elderly celibates coming together to discuss family questions. Addressing a meeting of the Global Network of Rainbow (LGBT) Catholics {{on the eve of the}} Vatican’s Synod on the Family, former president McAleese said: “In the days when I was president, we had workshops on various issues and <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to look at an issue, I would consult the experts... But look at the Synod, I have to ask the question: <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> expertise on the family, I honestly cannot say that the first thing that would come into my mind would be to call together 300 celibate males who, as far we know, have never raised a child...“Let me repeat a question I asked last year when I saw the Vatican’s lengthy pre-Synod questionnaire, namely how many of these men have ever changed a child’s nappy? For me that is a very important question because it is one thing to say that we all grew up in families, we had mothers, we had fathers but it is a very different thing to raise a gay child, a very different thing to live daily in a relationship and to police the relationships between children and the world.” Acknowledging that the Synod will doubtless be considering the Catholic Church's pastoral approach to homosexuals, McAleese described herself as “cynical” about the outcome of the forthcoming three week consultation.|$|E

500|$|While commenting {{in regards}} to the lyrical content of the song on Australian talk show, Rove, Gaga said that she was unrepentant about her [...] "disco stick" [...] metaphor, though it led to a banning of the music video on Network Ten in Australia.

She went on to relegate [...] "lot of youth-oriented pop music" [...] as much racier than hers with their sexually provocative lyrics, but Gaga felt that the whole context of her visuals alongside the music was what made people react.

[...] Similar to his high school decision, Barnes said, [...] "He wants to win a national championship and said he wants {{to do it in the}} state of Indiana and wanted to do it at a place he's never done it before."

[...] Swanigan had not consulted Barnes before he committed to Michigan State, and some believe that since Barnes played sports at Purdue he was a major influence in Swanigan decommitting from Michigan State. Barnes said that was not the reason Swanigan switched, and the primary reason for Swanigan choosing Purdue was the presence of two centers that were taller than 7', Isaac Haas and A.J. Hammons, which allowed Swanigan to play the 4 spot.|$|E

500|$|A Parisian critic, {{after seeing}} La grand' tante, {{declared}} that Massenet was a symphonist {{rather than a}} theatre composer. At {{the time of the}} British premiere of Manon in 1885, the critic in The Manchester Guardian, reviewing the work enthusiastically, nevertheless echoed his French confrère's view that the composer was really a symphonist, whose music was at its best when purely orchestral. [...] Massenet took a wholly opposite view of his talents. He was temperamentally unsuited to writing symphonically: the constraints of sonata form bored him. He wrote, in the early 1870s, [...] "What I have to say, musically, I have to say rapidly, forcefully, concisely; my discourse is tight and nervous, and <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to express myself otherwise I would not be myself." [...] His efforts in the concertante field made little mark, but his orchestral suites, colourful and picturesque according to Grove, have survived on the fringes of the repertoire. [...] Other works for orchestra are a symphonic poem, Visions (1891), an Ouverture de Concert (1863) and Ouverture de Phèdre (1873). After early attempts at chamber music as a student, he wrote little more in the genre. Most of his early chamber pieces are now lost; three pieces for cello and piano survive.|$|E
500|$|Thomas O'Leary, the {{wireless}} operator for ML 446, recalled {{the ferocity of}} incoming German fire, stating"One commando was remarking how pretty the tracer fire, red and green, was.

I was down below with my tin hat because by now the bullets were going through (the boat) and out the other side. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to get about I had to crawl on my hands and knees and I was lucky nothing came through at my level. We couldn't get in (to the objective) and all over a sudden the wounded started coming down. By then all our guns had jammed and most of the other ships were on fire."ML 177, the launch that had successfully taken off some of the crew from Campbeltown, was sunk on her way out of the estuary. [...] ML 269, another torpedo-armed boat, had the unenviable task of moving up and down the river at high speed to draw German fire away from the landings. Soon after passing Campbeltown it was hit and its steering damaged. It took ten minutes to repair the steering. They turned and started in the other direction, opening fire on an armed trawler in passing. Return fire from the trawler set their engine on fire.|$|E
500|$|Music {{journalist}} Charles Shaar Murray {{likens the}} figure to a feminine ideal: [...] "Sometimes {{she is a}} spirit, sometimes a fantasy, sometimes a woman as solidly, palpably physical as he is". [...] The figure first appears as [...] "Waterfall" [...] in [...] "May This Be Love", where she offers solace and hope, and as [...] "a soulful, loving sprite" [...] in [...] "Little Wing". [...] However, other writers {{have suggested that the}} figure is similar to the guardian angel associated with Christianity, which is clearly what she represents in Hendrix's later song [...] "Angel". Hendrix's brother, Leon, interpreted [...] "Little Wing" [...] (and [...] "Angel") as a general tribute: [...] "He wrote it for his girlfriends, our aunties, and especially for our mama, who looked over us from high above in the afterlife". [...] Hendrix's hand-written lyrics for [...] "Angel" [...] (with the note, [...] "Finished January 14, 1968") use the title [...] "My Angel Catherina (Return of Little Wing)", which suggests that he saw a connection between the two songs. [...] At the time, Hendrix had just finished a short tour of Scandinavia, where he had performed [...] "Little Wing" [...] in concert for the first time. [...] At some point he responded to a question, [...] "Love? I know a girl, Katerina, in Sweden." [...] In a later 1969 interview, Hendrix described his relationships while he was on tour: [...] "So like 'Little Wing' is like one of these beautiful girls that come around sometimes... She was a very sweet girl that came around that gave me her whole life and more <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> it. And me with my crazy ass couldn't get it together, so I'm off here and there and off over there." ...|$|E
