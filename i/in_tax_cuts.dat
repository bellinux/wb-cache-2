2500|$|When {{it turned}} to the environment, the Carbon Tax {{proposal}} came up repeatedly, with both Dion and May supporting it, although May to more ambitious figures than Dion, pointing out {{it was the most}} recommended and proven way to deal with carbon emissions by countries and organizations around the world, noting the growth that Sweden and Germany have had with this system. Harper criticized the plan, saying would increase taxpayers' burden and that Dion should be [...] "honest with the people" [...] that some environmental measures will cost the economy and said the plan includes $40 billion in carbon taxes and $26 billion <b>in</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cuts.</b> Dion defended the Liberal's Green Shift, saying that [...] " [...] not true at all", and that [...] "for every dollar that we will raise, you will have a tax cut, and these tax cuts will be on your income". Duceppe commented that he would like targets to be applied to individual provinces, thereby allowing Quebec to financially benefit due to already-implemented greenhouse gas reductions. Layton, who favours a cap-and-trade system, said that it is a [...] "figment of Mr. Harper's imagination" [...] that emissions will fall under his plan. When Harper sought to outline his government's record on other environmental fronts, giving examples of his minority government supported the preservation {{of hundreds of thousands of}} hectares of environmentally sensitive land through the Nature Conservancy of Canada, and that the government declared a protected marine area by Lake Superior and created a whale sanctuary by Baffin Island, May responded by saying [...] "The only word he said that's true is on national parks".|$|E

40|$|There is {{a renewed}} {{interest}} in the dynamic effects of <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> on government revenue. The possibility of <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> paying for themselves over time definitely seems like an attractive option for policy makers. This paper looks at what conditions are required for reductions <b>in</b> capital <b>taxes</b> to be fully self-financing. This is done in a model with constant returns to scale in broad capital. Such a framework exhibits growth; the scope for self-financing <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> is therefore different than in the neoclassical growth model, most recently studied by Mankiw and Weinzierl (2006). Compared to previous literature, I make a methodological contribution in the definition of "Laffer effects" and clarify the role of compositional and dynamic effects <b>in</b> making <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> self-financing. I also provide simple analytical expressions for what tax rates are required for <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> to be fully self-financing. The results show that large distortions are required to get Laffer effects. Introducing a labor/leisure choice into the model opens up a new avenue for such effects, however.
