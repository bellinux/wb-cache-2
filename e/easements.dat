5|$|Hebden has {{a parish}} council with five {{independent}} members {{supported by a}} parish clerk. Elections are held every four years, the most recent in 2016. Council meetings are held every six weeks. The parish council's activities are largely funded by income from parish lands {{in the form of}} rent, grants, and <b>easements.</b>|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} various {{administrative}} groups of listed parks, such as Manhattan Sites, National Parks of New York Harbor, and Western Arctic National Parklands. The NPS also owns conservation <b>easements</b> (but not the land itself) {{for part of}} the area called the Green Springs National Historic Landmark District.|$|E
25|$|<b>Easements</b> by prescription, {{also called}} {{prescriptive}} <b>easements,</b> are implied <b>easements</b> granted after the dominant estate {{has used the}} property in a hostile, continuous and open manner for a statutorily prescribed number of years. Prescriptive <b>easements</b> differ from adverse possession by not requiring exclusivity.|$|E
50|$|In most U.S. jurisdictions, a {{prescriptive}} <b>easement</b> {{can only}} be determined for an affirmative <b>easement</b> not a negative <b>easement.</b> In all U.S. jurisdictions, an <b>easement</b> for view (which is a negative <b>easement)</b> cannot be created by prescription.|$|R
2500|$|There is also {{an unwritten}} form of <b>easement</b> {{referred}} to as an implied <b>easement</b> or <b>easement</b> by implication, arising from the original subdivision of the land for continuous and obvious use of the adjacent parcel (e.g., for access to a road, or to a source of water) such as the right of lot owners in a subdivision to use the roadway on the approved subdivision plan without requiring a specific grant of <b>easement</b> to each new lot when first conveyed. An <b>easement</b> by necessity is distinguished from an <b>easement</b> by implication in that the <b>easement</b> by necessity arises only when [...] "strictly necessary", whereas the <b>easement</b> by implication can arise when [...] "reasonably necessary". <b>Easement</b> by necessity is a higher standard by which to imply an <b>easement.</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis article {{deals with}} the <b>easement</b> valuation. The {{increased}} level of real estate with <b>easement</b> identification has prompted the reason of appraising such real estate. The article introduces the definition of and <b>easement,</b> all its properties and categories, because a proper understanding of all <b>easement</b> affections leads to better valuation. The basic principles of <b>easement</b> valuation focused on steps of <b>easement</b> valuation are also described in this article. At the end the Mr. Sherwood's <b>easement</b> valuation matrix is introduced and described with the definition of percentage of fee for different types of <b>easement</b> and different deepness of encumbrance...|$|R
25|$|<b>Easements</b> {{are most}} often created by express {{language}} in binding documents. Parties generally grant an easement to another, or reserve an easement for themselves. Under most circumstances {{having a conversation with}} another party is not sufficient. Courts have also recognized creation of <b>easements</b> in other ways.|$|E
25|$|Some <b>easements</b> are negative, forbidding a {{route that}} might {{otherwise}} be acceptable.|$|E
25|$|Once {{they become}} legally binding, <b>easements</b> by {{prescription}} hold the same legal weight as written or implied <b>easements.</b> But, {{before they become}} binding, they hold no legal weight and are broken if the true property owner takes appropriate acts to defend their ownership rights. Easement by prescription is typically found in legal systems based on common law, although other legal systems may also allow easement by prescription.|$|E
50|$|An <b>easement</b> or {{license to}} drill for oil, gas, or {{minerals}} generally runs with the land, {{and thus is}} an appurtenant <b>easement.</b> However, a utility <b>easement</b> generally runs with {{the owner of the}} <b>easement,</b> rather than running with the land, and as such, is an example of an <b>easement</b> in gross.|$|R
2500|$|Prescription {{may also}} be used to end an {{existing}} legal <b>easement.</b> For example, if a servient tenement (estate) holder were to erect a fence blocking a legally deeded right-of-way <b>easement,</b> the dominant tenement holder would have to act to defend their <b>easement</b> rights during the statutory period or the <b>easement</b> might cease to have legal force, even though it would remain a deeded document. [...] Failure to use an <b>easement</b> leading to loss of the <b>easement</b> is sometimes referred to as [...] "non-user." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{landowner}} who grants {{a conservation}} <b>easement</b> continues to privately own {{and manage the}} land and may receive significant state and federal tax advantages for having donated and/or sold the conservation <b>easement.</b> In accepting the conservation <b>easement,</b> the <b>easement</b> holder {{has a responsibility to}} monitor future uses of the land to ensure compliance with the terms of the <b>easement</b> and to enforce the terms if a violation occurs.|$|R
25|$|Rail trail {{conversions}} can be {{complex for}} legal, social, and economic reasons. Railroads in North America were often built {{with a mix}} of purchased land, government land grants, and <b>easements.</b> The land deeds can be over a hundred years old, land grants might be conditional upon continuous operation of the line, and <b>easements</b> may have expired, all expensive and difficult issues to determine at law.|$|E
25|$|Under the Torrens title {{system of}} land {{ownership}} registration, <b>easements</b> and mortgages are recorded on the titles {{kept in the}} central land registry or cadastre. Any unrecorded easement is not recognised and no easement by prescription or implication may be claimed. However, in Australia, <b>easements</b> may be created by prescription or implication and enforced if an exception to indefeasibility is established, but they cannot be recorded on the title.|$|E
25|$|Modern courts {{recognize}} more {{varieties of}} <b>easements,</b> but these original categories still form {{the foundation of}} easement law.|$|E
5000|$|Ingress/egress <b>easement.</b> This <b>easement</b> can be {{used for}} {{entering}} and exiting a property through or over the <b>easement</b> area. This might be used for a person's driveway, going over another person's property.|$|R
50|$|A {{dominant}} estate is the parcel of real property {{that has an}} <b>easement</b> over another piece of property (the servient estate). The type of <b>easement</b> involved is almost always an appurtenant <b>easement.</b> Likewise, it is almost always an affirmative <b>easement,</b> that is, one that permits a person to do something. Estate is a common law concept.|$|R
25|$|A private <b>easement</b> is held {{by private}} {{individuals}} or entities. A public <b>easement</b> grants an <b>easement</b> for a public use, for example, to allow the public an access over a parcel owned by an individual.|$|R
25|$|Implied <b>easements</b> {{are more}} complex and are {{determined}} by the courts based on the use of a property and the intention of the original parties, who can be private or public/government entities. Implied <b>easements</b> are not recorded or explicitly stated until a court decides a dispute, but reflect the practices and customs of use for a property. Courts typically refer to the intent of the parties, as well as prior use, to determine the existence of an implied easement.|$|E
25|$|The largest {{protected}} area is Richard J. Dorer Memorial Hardwood State Forest, which contains some state-owned land, but is mostly private, controlled by state conservation <b>easements.</b>|$|E
25|$|The trust collaborates {{with state}} and {{regional}} agencies and other conservation partners to preserve larger purchases. The <b>easements</b> help expand wildlife habitat and native plant populations within watersheds.|$|E
50|$|The {{conservation}} <b>easement</b> preserves one of {{the last}} sizeable open spaces in McLean. Within the new <b>easement,</b> 10 acre will be placed in active recreational use with the remainder used for passive recreation such as trails (providing a critical link to the Pimmit Run Trail system). The <b>easement</b> will also allow for preservation and interpretation of natural and cultural resources on the property. The <b>easement</b> prevents any residential construction on the property in perpetuity, and the Park Authority has the right of first refusal to own the Salona property outright. The cost of the conservation <b>easement</b> ($16.1 million) is {{less than half of the}} appraised (highest and best use) value of the property. The Northern Virginia Conservation Trust has the role of <b>easement</b> enforcement, and collaborated on the acquisition of the <b>easement.</b>|$|R
25|$|Sanitary sewer <b>easement.</b> An <b>easement</b> {{to carry}} used {{water to a}} sewage {{treatment}} plant.|$|R
25|$|Communications <b>easement.</b> This <b>easement</b> can be {{used for}} {{wireless}} communications towers, cable lines, and other communications services. This is a private <b>easement</b> and the rights granted by the property owner are for the specific use of communications.|$|R
25|$|The low {{weight of}} PRT's small {{vehicles}} allows smaller guideways and support structures than mass transit systems like light rail. The smaller structures translate into lower construction costs, smaller <b>easements,</b> and less visually obtrusive infrastructure.|$|E
25|$|<b>Easements</b> are {{regarded}} as a broader and more powerful than licenses, and licenses that {{have any of the}} properties of an easement may be bound by the higher standards for termination granted by an easement.|$|E
25|$|An {{easement}} {{may also}} be created by prior use. <b>Easements</b> by prior use {{are based on the}} idea that land owners can intend to create an easement, but forget to include it in the deed.|$|E
50|$|The {{decision}} {{to place a}} conservation <b>easement</b> on a property is strictly a voluntary one whether the <b>easement</b> is sold or donated. The restrictions of the <b>easement,</b> once set in place, are perpetual (and potentially reduce the resale value of the associated property). Appraisals {{of the value of}} the <b>easement,</b> and financial arrangements between the parties (land owner and land trust), generally are kept private.|$|R
25|$|Because {{this method}} of {{creating}} an <b>easement</b> requires imposing a burden (the <b>easement)</b> upon another party {{for the benefit of}} the landlocked owner, the court looks to the original circumstances in weighing the relative apportionment of benefit and burden to both lots in making its equitable determination whether such <b>easement</b> shall be created by the court. This method of creating an <b>easement,</b> being an active creation by a court of an otherwise non-existent right, may be automatically extinguished upon termination of the necessity (for example, if a new public road is built adjacent to the landlocked tenement or another <b>easement</b> is acquired without regard to comparison of ease or practicality between the imposed <b>easement</b> and any valid substitute).|$|R
40|$|<b>Easement</b> means, a right {{enjoyed by}} the owner of land over the lands of another: such as rights of way, right of light, rights of support, rights to a flow of air or water etc. The {{dominant}} tenement is the land owned by the possessor of the <b>easement,</b> and the servient tenement is the land over which the right is enjoyed. An <b>easement</b> must exist for the accommodation and better enjoyment {{to which it is}} annexed, otherwise it may amount to mere licence. An <b>easement</b> benefits and binds the land itself and therefore countinious despite any change of ownership of either dominant or servient tenement, although it will be extinguished if the two tenemants come into common ownership. An <b>easement</b> can only be enjoyed in respect of land. This means two parcels of land. First there must be a 'dominant tenement' and a 'servient tenement'. Dominant tenement to which the benefit of the <b>easement</b> attaches, and another (servient tenement) which bears the burden of the <b>easement.</b> A positive <b>easement</b> consist of a right to do something on the land of another; a negative <b>easement</b> restrict the use of owner of the serviant tenement may make of his land. An <b>easement</b> may be on land or on the house made on land. The next classification is on <b>easement</b> on the ground, and the other one under the ground. An <b>easement</b> shall be done in accordance with the principle of restrictions. This means that the less burden the servient tenement. When there is doubt about the extent of the actual <b>easement</b> shall take what easier the servient tenement. The new needs of the dominant estate does not result in the expansion of servitude. In the article is made comparison between The Draft Code of property and other real estate, and The Draft of Civil Code of Serbia...|$|R
25|$|In August 2016, {{the company}} {{stated that it}} had already {{executed}} easement agreements with 99% of the landowners whose properties lie along the four-state route and, {{with regards to the}} landowners along the pipeline's route in Iowa, 99% had entered voluntary <b>easements.</b>|$|E
25|$|These <b>easements</b> are {{exceptions}} to the acceptable routes which are otherwise explicitly defined, and are listed in Section E of the Guide for easy reference. They are simple to understand one-line rules, and exist to ensure that in most circumstances the simplest journey is acceptable.|$|E
25|$|Special {{fly fishing}} and catch and release-only areas are {{available}} above Altmar. Paid-only access {{is available on}} the stretch of the river below Pulaski and above the NYS Route 3 bridge in an area where no <b>easements</b> exist, known as the Douglaston Salmon Run.|$|E
