30|$|Mapping Yelp’s {{business}} venues with ratings {{provides a}} new way to understand spatial patterns of service quality of business or public venues at a large spatial scale. In terms of a spatially constrained algorithm, we could identify clusters of <b>high</b> <b>ratings</b> and further explore spatial patterns of clusters of <b>high</b> <b>ratings.</b> In this paper, we conducted an empirical research on Phoenix, USA. The empirical results indicate that spatial clusters of <b>high</b> <b>ratings</b> tend to be differently distributed between different categories of Yelp venues. More specifically, bars within or near the city centre are likely to have <b>high</b> <b>ratings.</b> Additionally, compared with Yelp restaurants Foursquare restaurants around the city centre {{are more likely to have}} <b>high</b> <b>ratings.</b> Moreover, although hot spots and cold spots of restaurants and fast foods both tend to be randomly distributed over space, spatial distribution of restaurants’ ratings tends to be more similar to that of bars’ ratings.|$|R

Bower promised to retain the return to traditional Neighbours values, but with an injection of drama that remains recognisable and relevant. Ratings rose to almost 900,000 in mid-2008, but generally ratings begin to fall towards the end of each year, usually averaging around 700,000. On 17 July 2009, during the aftermath of the Parker family's car accident and the dramatic death of Bridget Parker (Eloise Mignon), Neighbours achieved <b>higher</b> <b>ratings</b> than Home And Away.

5|$|The Simpsons {{first season}} was the Fox network's first TV series to rank among a season's top 30 highest-rated shows. Due to its success, the Fox network decided to switch The Simpsons {{timeslots}} {{in hopes that}} it would result in <b>higher</b> <b>ratings</b> for the lead out shows. It would move from 8:00 PM on Sunday night to the same time on Thursday where it would compete with The Cosby Show, the number one show at the time. Many of the producers were against the move, as The Simpsons {{had been in the}} top 10 while airing on Sunday and they felt the move would destroy its ratings.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Vince McMahon's World Wrestling Federation (WWF)'s main {{competition}} in the professional wrestling industry was from Jim Crockett Promotions. McMahon countered Jim Crockett's successful Starrcade pay-per-view, which began airing in 1983, by creating the WrestleMania franchise. After WrestleMania III in March 1987, the most successful professional wrestling pay-per-view event in history, McMahon created the Survivor Series franchise, which aired {{the same day as}} Starrcade 1987 in November 1987. After defeating Crockett in the ratings war, McMahon created the Royal Rumble, an event airing for free on the USA Network in January 1988. The event set a ratings record for the network with eight million households tuning in to watch the event. In retaliation, Crockett created the Clash of the Champions event, which aired simultaneously with WrestleMania IV. WrestleMania IV garnered <b>higher</b> <b>ratings,</b> and not long after, Crockett filed for bankruptcy and sold his company to Ted Turner, who renamed it World Championship Wrestling (WCW).|$|E

5|$|The book {{is divided}} into ten subject-related chapters. The first chapter {{provides}} an introduction to how Stursberg entered the CBC scene, how he viewed his role replacing the retiring Harold Redekopp as the executive {{vice president in charge}} of English services, and previews what challenges he would encounter. The second chapter covers his experience entering CBC senior management amid contract negotiations with its union, the resulting lock out during summer 2005, and the relations between what he labeled the Gang of Four (senior management) and the Central Committee (union representatives). In the third chapter, Entertainment, he explains his plan for re-orienting CBC television towards entertainment which would use audience numbers to gauge success. He cancelled critically acclaimed shows (Da Vinci's City Hall, This Is Wonderland, and Opening Night) which had low ratings and ordered what he expected would be more audience-friendly shows. Beginning in summer 2006, the first new show under Stursberg's strategy, , received very low ratings and was quickly cancelled. That Autumn's schedule, though, was successful, introducing Little Mosque on the Prairie, The Tudors, Heartland. The nest year's schedule introduced the successful The Border and Being Erica but also the unsuccessful MVP and jPod. Strusberg's move of Marketplace to Friday nights resulted in <b>higher</b> <b>ratings</b> but his plan to move The National to 11pm was denied by the CBC board of directors. In the fourth chapter, The French, he details his relationship with his French counterpart, the style differences between English and French television shows, the disproportionate funding given to the French services, and the lack of CBC Board members who can understand French. As a means of trying to bridge the two cultures, he ordered English versions of the popular Quebec shows Rumours and Sophie but both received low ratings in English Canada.|$|E
