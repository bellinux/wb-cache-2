40|$|For the {{prediction}} of acoustic waves from a rocket plume, source characteristics of Mach waves are investigated with using high resolution schemes. Four ideally-expanded supersonic jets, M= 2. 0 cold jet, M= 3. 0 cold jet, M= 2. 0 hot jet and M= 3. 0 hot jet, are computed and analyzed. With regard to computation, the seventh order weighted compact non-linear scheme and the tenth order compact scheme are used for the fluid analysis and near fields acoustics propagation, respectively. Source positions are investigated with the focused array method and the visualization of sources. The results of the focused array methods show that the high <b>frequency</b> <b>sources</b> are located at the upstream region, while the low <b>frequency</b> <b>sources</b> are located at the downstream region. In addition, Mach waves emitted from the high <b>frequency</b> <b>sources</b> are propagated with the large angle to the axis, while that from the low <b>frequency</b> <b>sources</b> are propagated with the small angle.

5000|$|In an LC {{oscillator}} circuit, {{the filter}} is a tuned circuit (often called a tank circuit; the tuned circuit is a resonator) consisting of an inductor (L) and capacitor (C) connected together.

50|$|If {{the applied}} voltage is normal voltage then normal flux {{will be set}} up. Since iron loss is a {{function}} of applied voltage, normal iron loss will occur. Hence the iron loss is maximum at rated voltage. This maximum iron loss is measured using the wattmeter. Since the impedance of the series winding of the transformer is very small compared to that of the excitation branch, all of the input voltage is dropped across the excitation branch. Thus the wattmeter measures only the iron loss. This test only measures the combined iron losses consisting of the hysteresis loss and the eddy current loss. Although the hysteresis loss is less than the eddy current loss, it is not negligible. The two losses can be separated by driving the transformer from a variable <b>frequency</b> <b>source</b> since the hysteresis loss varies linearly with supply frequency and the eddy current loss varies with the square.|$|E

5000|$|The Josephson {{effect was}} {{initially}} {{used to improve}} the measurement of the constant [...] based on voltage values derived from the SI volt realization as maintained by Weston cells. The uncertainty of these measurements was limited by {{the uncertainty of the}} SI volt realization and the stability of the Weston cells. [...] The stability of the Josephson volt depends only on the stability of [...] (which can easily be a part in 1012), and is at least four orders of magnitude better than the stability of Weston cells. Thus, in the early 1970s, many national standards laboratories adopted a value for the Josephson constant [...] and began using the ac Josephson effect as the practical standard of voltage. [...] Owing to small differences in existing national standards, different values of [...] were adopted by various countries. This inconsistency was corrected in 1990 when, by international agreement, the constant [...] was assigned the value 483597.9 GHz/V and adopted by all standards laboratories. The assigned value is based on a weighted average of volt realization measurements made prior to 1990 at many national measurement institutions. The uncertainty in [...] is 0.4 ppm. Standards such as the Josephson volt that depend on fundamental constants rather than physical artifacts are known as intrinsic standards. Although the Josephson voltage standard (JVS) does not realize the SI definition of the volt, it provides a very stable reference voltage that can be reproduced anywhere without the need to transfer artifacts such as Weston cells. The accuracy of the Josephson voltage-frequency relation , and its independence from experimental conditions, such as bias current, temperature, and junction materials, have been subjected to many tests. No significant deviation from this relation has ever been found. In the most precise of these experiments, two Josephson devices are driven by the same <b>frequency</b> <b>source,</b> biased on the same step, and connected in a series opposition loop across a small inductor. Since this loop is entirely superconductive, any voltage difference leads to a changing magnetic field in the inductor. This field is detected with a SQUID magnetometer and its constancy has set an upper limit on the voltage difference of less than 3 parts in 1019. Figure 2 is a semilog plot that illustrates how typical differences in dc voltage measurements among National Measurement Institutes (NMIs) have decreased over the last 70 years. The two major improvements coincide with the introduction of single-junction Josephson standards in the early 1970s and the introduction of series-array Josephson standards beginning in 1984.|$|E
