5|$|When Press Your Luck {{returned}} after the weekend break, the episode {{started with the}} same freeze frame image. Tomarken (again chroma keyed over the image) then brought the viewers {{up to speed on}} what Friday's episode entailed, first by introducing Larson's opponents and then explaining what Larson had done so far, before the game resumed. Freeze frames were also used to lead <b>into</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> of the first two commercial breaks, with voice overs by Tomarken leading <b>into</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> of them.|$|E

5|$|Although {{rail freight}} levels are far down {{compared}} to their height, significant quantities of cargo are also carried <b>into</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> of London by rail; chiefly building materials and landfill waste. As a major hub of the British railway network, London's tracks also carry large amounts of freight for the other regions, such as container freight from the Channel Tunnel and English Channel ports, and nuclear waste for reprocessing at Sellafield.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the release}} of the PlayStation 2, Sony {{reported}} that the new system had compatibility issues with the Final Fantasy V half of Final Fantasy Anthology. The game experienced a bug where if players attempted to save their games, a graphical error would occur. Square then released a statement that only the look of the save screen was corrupted, and saving was still possible, and if players wished, repeatedly going <b>into</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> of the save screen would make a normal screen eventually appear. This incompatibility was fixed for the PAL and Greatest Hits releases of Final Fantasy Anthology.|$|E
5|$|In December 2014, the June 27 {{flow from}} the ongoing {{eruption}} threatened to enter the town of Pahoa, and to cut Highway 130, the only route <b>into</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> of Lower Puna. As a result, work was begun to reopen Chain of Craters Road, initially as a one-lane gravelled surface, and to make Railroad Avenue and Government Beach Road usable as emergency routes. However the flow stopped just short of entering Pahoa, and by March 2015, {{the threat to the}} town was much reduced.|$|E

5|$|On 12 April, gunfire {{was heard}} between 19:00 and 21:00, as mutinous troops {{attempted}} {{to overthrow the}} government by seizing control of the centre of the capital Bissau. Initial reports by diplomats in the country said presidential candidate Carlos Gomes JÃºnior and interim President Raimundo Pereira were missing. The mutineers seized control of the offices of the incumbent African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC) and radio stations. They also fought police officers loyal to the government, forcing them to retreat after coming under fire from RPGs. The soldiers blocked the roads <b>into</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> of the capital city and the national radio and television was taken off-air at 20:00.|$|E
5|$|On June 9, Reagan's casket {{was removed}} from the presidential library and driven in a {{motorcade}} to NAS Point Mugu in Oxnard, California; it was the same airfield Reagan flew <b>into</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> of during his presidency when visiting his California ranch. SAM 28000, one of the two Boeing 747-200s, which usually serves the president as Air Force One, arrived to transport the casket to Washington. Thousands of people gathered to witness the plane's departure. Just before she boarded the VC-25A Presidential Aircraft, Nancy Reagan waved to the crowd with her military escort at her side. The plane lifted off at about 9:40am PST.|$|E
5|$|Relatively new {{cells in}} a groove {{on the edges}} of the mantle secrete {{material}} that extends the periostracum. These cells are gradually displaced to the underside of the mantle by more recent cells in the groove, and switch to secreting the mineralized material of the shell valves. In other words, {{on the edge of the}} valve the periostracum is extended first, and then reinforced by extension of the mineralized layers under the periostracum. In most species the edge of the mantle also bears movable bristles, often called chaetae or setae, that may help defend the animals and may act as sensors. In some brachiopods groups of chaetae help to channel the flow of water <b>into</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> of the mantle cavity.|$|E

5|$|The Japanese Army's mopping-up {{operations}} and the large-scale massacres that accompanied them were {{over by the}} afternoon of December 17 when General Matsui entered Nanking for the victory parade. By the end of December most Japanese soldiers had left Nanking, though units of the Shanghai Expeditionary Army stayed on to occupy the city. The Nanking Self-Government Committee, a new municipal authority formed from local Chinese collaborators, was inaugurated on January 1, 1938, {{but it was not}} until February 25 that all restrictions on the free movement of civilians <b>into</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> of the city were lifted.|$|E
5|$|The current {{standard}} {{theory for}} Solar System formation, the nebular hypothesis, has fallen <b>into</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> of favour since its formulation by Emanuel Swedenborg, Immanuel Kant, and Pierre-Simon Laplace in the 18th century. The most significant {{criticism of the}} hypothesis was its apparent inability to explain the Sun's relative lack of angular momentum {{when compared to the}} planets. However, since the early 1980s studies of young stars have shown them to be surrounded by cool discs of dust and gas, exactly as the nebular hypothesis predicts, which has led to its re-acceptance.|$|E

5|$|The normal resting {{heart rate}} {{is called the}} sinus rhythm, created and {{sustained}} by the sinoatrial node, a group of pacemaking cells found in {{the wall of the}} right atrium. Cells in the sinoatrial node do this by creating an action potential. The cardiac action potential is created by the movement of specific electrolytes <b>into</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> of the pacemaker cells. The action potential then spreads to nearby cells.|$|E
5|$|The {{painted turtle}} hunts along water bottoms. It quickly juts its head <b>into</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> of {{vegetation}} to stir potential victims {{out into the}} open water, where they are pursued. The turtle holds large prey in its mouth and tears the prey apart with its forefeet. It also consumes plants and skims {{the surface of the water}} with its mouth open to catch small particles of food.|$|E
5|$|The plasma {{membrane}} is a phospholipid bilayer membrane {{that separates the}} cell from its environment and regulates the transport of molecules and signals <b>into</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> of the cell. Embedded in the membrane are proteins that perform {{the functions of the}} {{plasma membrane}}. The plasma membrane is not a fixed or rigid structure, the molecules that compose the membrane are capable of lateral movement. This movement and the multiple components of the membrane are why it is referred to as a fluid mosaic. Smaller molecules such as carbon dioxide, water, and oxygen can pass through the plasma membrane freely by diffusion or osmosis. Larger molecules needed by the cell are assisted by proteins through active transport.|$|E

5|$|While every {{implementation}} of each kind of ALF is different, the vapor cell in each is relatively similar. The thermodynamic properties of vapor cells in filters are carefully controlled because they determine important {{qualities of the}} filter, for instance the necessary strength of the magnetic field. Light is let <b>into</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> of this vapor chamber by way of two low-reflection windows made of a material such as magnesium fluoride. The other sides of the cell may be of any opaque material, though generally a heat-resistant metal or ceramic is used as the vapor is usually kept at temperatures upwards of 100Â°C.|$|E

5|$|A deck {{decompression}} chamber (DDC), or double-lock chamber is a two compartment {{pressure vessel}} for human occupation which has sufficient space in the main chamber for two or more occupants, and a forechamber which can allow a person to be pressurised or decompressed while the main chamber remains under constant pressure. This allows an attendant to be locked in or out during treatment of the occupant(s) of the main chamber. There is usually also a medical lock, which serves a similar function but is much smaller. This is used to transfer medical material, food and specimens <b>into</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> of the main chamber while it is under pressure. Most {{deck decompression chamber}}s are fitted with built in breathing systems (BIBS), which supply an alternative breathig gas to the occupants (usually oxygen), and discharge the exhaled gas outside the chamber, so the chamber gas is not excessively enriched by oxygen, which would cause an unacceptable fire hazard, and require frequent flushing with chamber gas (usually air).|$|E
