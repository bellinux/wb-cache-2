25|$|Glucose is {{the major}} energy source in most life forms. For instance, polysaccharides are broken down into their {{monomers}} (<b>glycogen</b> <b>phosphorylase</b> removes glucose residues from glycogen).

25|$|In {{the early}} fasting state, {{cortisol}} stimulates gluconeogenesis (the formation of glucose), and activates antistress and anti-inflammatory pathways. Cortisol also plays an important, but indirect, role in liver and muscle glycogenolysis, the breaking down of glycogen to glucose-1-phosphate and glucose. This is done through its passive influence on glucagon. Additionally, cortisol facilitates the activation of <b>glycogen</b> <b>phosphorylase,</b> which {{is necessary for}} epinephrine {{to have an effect}} on glycogenolysis.|$|E
5000|$|Together with <b>phosphorylase,</b> <b>glycogen</b> {{debranching}} enzymes {{function in}} glycogen breakdown and glucose mobilization. When phosphorylase has digested a glycogen branch down to four glucose residues, {{it will not}} remove further residues. Glycogen debranching enzymes assist phosphorylase, the primary enzyme involved in glycogen breakdown, mobilize <b>glycogen</b> stores. <b>Phosphorylase</b> can only cleave α-1,4- glycosidic bond between adjacent glucose molecules in glycogen but branches exist as α-1,6 linkages. When phosphorylase reaches four residues from a branching point it stops cleaving; because 1 in 10 residues is branched, cleavage by phosphorylase alone would not be sufficient in mobilizing <b>glycogen</b> stores.

During perfusion or ischaemia, gsd/gsd-rat livers showed a brisk glycogenolysis. There {{was also a}} small (1. 9 -fold) but significant transient increase in their phosphorylase alpha activity during ischaemia, despite their phosphorylase b kinase deficiency; it seems unlikely, however, {{that this was the}} main determinant of the glycogenolysis...|$|R
40|$|Glycogen {{metabolism}} {{has been}} studied in the liver of the frog Rana esculenta throughout the annual cycle. Hepatic glycogen reserves are high during winter and decrease during spring and summer, the changes being reflected by variations {{in the activities of}} the rate-limiting enzymes <b>glycogen</b> synthase and <b>phosphorylase.</b> <b>Glycogen</b> deposition is associated with increased levels of synthase D activity and no changes in the relative proportions of the active-inactive form of the enzyme, whereas during glycogen mobilization significant changes in both total phosphorylase and in the percent phosphorylase a are observed. Regression analysis indicates a positive correlation between glycogen content and synthase activity, and an inverse relationship between glycogen content and either total phosphorylase or phosphorylase a. The results suggest that glycogen deposition and/or mobilization could be mainly controlled by mechanisms related to either changes in the amount of enzyme protein or to allosteric effects of the metabolite glucose- 6 -phosphate on glycogen synthase and phorphorylase...|$|R
25|$|After a meal {{has been}} digested and glucose levels begin to fall, insulin {{secretion}} is reduced, and glycogen synthesis stops. When {{it is needed}} for energy, glycogen is broken down and converted again to glucose. <b>Glycogen</b> <b>phosphorylase</b> is the primary enzyme of glycogen breakdown. For the next 8–12 hours, glucose derived from liver glycogen is {{the primary source of}} blood glucose used {{by the rest of the}} body for fuel.|$|E
25|$|G6P, {{the product}} of glucokinase, is the {{principal}} substrate of glycogen synthesis, and glucokinase has a close functional and regulatory association with glycogen synthesis. When maximally active, GK and glycogen synthase appears to {{be located in the}} same peripheral areas of hepatocyte cytoplasm in which glycogen synthesis occurs. The supply of G6P affects the rate of glycogen synthesis not only as the primary substrate, but by direct stimulation of glycogen synthase and inhibition of <b>glycogen</b> <b>phosphorylase.</b>|$|E
25|$|Phosphoprotein {{phosphatase}} {{is activated}} by the hormone insulin, {{which indicates that}} there is a high concentration of glucose in the blood. The enzyme then acts to dephosphorylate other enzymes, such as phosphorylase kinase, <b>glycogen</b> <b>phosphorylase,</b> and glycogen synthase. This leads to phosphorylase kinase and glycogen phosphorylase's becoming inactive, while glycogen synthase is activated. As a result, glycogen synthesis is increased and glycogenolysis is decreased, and the net effect is for energy to enter and be stored inside the cell.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to verify in man the {{relationships}} of muscle <b>glycogen</b> synthase and <b>phosphorylase</b> activities with <b>glycogen</b> concentration that were reported in animal studies. The upper level of glycogen concentration in muscle is known to be tightly controlled, and glycogen concentration was reported to have an inhibitory effect on synthase activity and a stimulatory effect on <b>phosphorylase</b> activity. <b>Glycogen</b> synthase and <b>phosphorylase</b> activity and <b>glycogen</b> concentration were measured in muscle biopsies in a group of nine normal subjects after stimulating an increase of their muscle glycogen concentration through either an intravenous glucose-insulin infusion to stimulate glycogen synthesis, or an Intralipid (Vitrum, Stockholm, Sweden) infusion in the basal state to inhibit glycogen mobilization by favoring lipid oxidation at the expense of glucose oxidation. Phosphorylase activity increased from 71. 3 +/- 21. 0 to 152. 8 +/- 20. 0 nmol/min/mg protein (P <. 005) after the glucose-insulin infusion. Phosphorylase activity was positively correlated with glycogen concentration (P =. 005 and P =. 0001) after the glucose-insulin and Intralipid infusions, respectively. Insulin-stimulated glycogen synthase activity was significantly negatively correlated with glycogen concentration at the end of the Intralipid infusion (P <. 005). In conclusion, by demonstrating a negative correlation of glycogen concentration with glycogen synthase and a positive correlation with phosphorylase, this study might confirm in man the double-feedback mechanism by which changes in glycogen concentration regulate <b>glycogen</b> synthase and <b>phosphorylase</b> activities. It suggests that this mechanism might play an important role in the regulation of glucose storage...|$|R
40|$|In the rat, autotransplanted minced {{skeletal}} muscle undergoes degenerative changes {{prior to the}} regeneration of a whole muscle. In this study, both the degenerative and early regenerative processes were examined using histochemical procedures for the localization of <b>glycogen,</b> neutral lipid, <b>phosphorylase,</b> lactate dehydrogenase, cytochrome oxidase, glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase and non-specific esterases. <b>Glycogen</b> and <b>phosphorylase</b> activity disappeared in all muscle fibers within 24 hours after mincing. Vascular injections of ink demonstrated that during the second to tenth days after mincing a central ischemic zone of degenerating minced muscle {{was surrounded by a}} vascularized zone of regenerating muscle. Lactate dehydrogenase staining persisted during the first week in the degenerating muscle fragments of the central zone. This latter histochemical observation was supported by quantitative evidence which showed that degenerating muscle isolated from the central zone of four day regenerates produced lactic acid in the presence of glucose. Cytochrome oxidase activity decreased rapidly in the degenerating muscle while succinic dehydrogenase persisted somewhat longer. Although non-specific esterases and glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase activities were not significant in normal muscle, they were histochemically detectable in degenerating muscle during the first week. The capacity for anaerobic metabolism apparently persists in the degenerating minced muscle for several days; this energy source may be sufficient to maintain the myogenic cells in an environment of degeneration and ischemia until they become reassociated with a vascular supply...|$|R
40|$|Cell {{swelling}} {{is known}} to increase net glycogen production from glucose in hepatocytes from fasted rats by activating glycogen synthase. Since both active <b>glycogen</b> synthase and <b>phosphorylase</b> are present in hepatocytes, suppression of flux through phosphorylase may {{also contribute to the}} net increase in glycogen synthesis by cell swelling. We have developed an isotopic procedure to estimate the fluxes through <b>glycogen</b> synthase and <b>phosphorylase</b> in intact hepatocytes and we have examined the effect of cell swelling on both enzyme fluxes. The following observations were made. (1) Hypotonic or glutamine-induced cell swelling increased net glycogen production by activating flux through glycogen synthase with little effect on phosphorylase flux. Proline, previously shown to increase glycogen synthesis more than could be accounted for by its ability to cause cell swelling, increased flux through glycogen synthase and inhibited phosphorylase flux. (2) Incorporation of [14 C]glucose into glycogen preceded complete mixing of [14 C]glucose with the intracellular pool of UDPglucose. It is concluded that cell swelling affects glycogen synthase only and that UDPglucose is compartmentalize...|$|R
25|$|Energy {{needed to}} perform short lasting, high {{intensity}} bursts of activity {{is derived from}} anaerobic metabolism within the cytosol of muscle cells, as opposed to aerobic respiration which utilizes oxygen, is sustainable, and occurs in the mitochondria. The quick energy sources consist of the phosphocreatine (PCr) system, fast glycolysis, and adenylate kinase. All of these systems re-synthesize adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the universal energy source in all cells. The most rapid source, but the most readily depleted of the above sources is the PCr system which utilizes the enzyme creatine kinase. This enzyme catalyzes a reaction that combines phosphocreatine and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) into ATP and creatine. This resource is short lasting because oxygen {{is required for the}} resynthesis of phosphocreatine via mitochondrial creatine kinase. Therefore, under anaerobic conditions, this substrate is finite and only lasts between approximately 10 to 30 seconds of high intensity work. Fast glycolysis, however, can function for approximately 2 minutes prior to fatigue, and predominately uses intracellular glycogen as a substrate. Glycogen is broken down rapidly via <b>glycogen</b> <b>phosphorylase</b> into individual glucose units during intense exercise. Glucose is then oxidized to pyruvate and under anaerobic condition is reduced to lactic acid. This reaction oxidizes NADH to NAD, thereby releasing a hydrogen ion, promoting acidosis. For this reason, fast glycolysis can not be sustained for long periods of time. Lastly, adenylate kinase catalyzes a reaction by which 2 ADP are combined to form ATP and adenosine monophosphate (AMP). This reaction takes place during low energy situations such as extreme exercise or conditions of hypoxia, but is not a significant source of energy. The creation of AMP resulting from this reaction stimulates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMP kinase) which is the energy sensor of the cell. After sensing low energy conditions, AMP kinase stimulates various other intracellular enzymes geared towards increasing energy supply and decreasing all anabolic, or energy requiring, cell functions.|$|E
2500|$|The {{understanding}} {{of the concept of}} second messengers, and in particular the role of cyclic nucleotides and their ability to relay physiological signals to a cell, has its origins in the research of glycogen metabolism by Carl and Gerty Cori, for which they were awarded a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1947. [...] A number of incremental but important discoveries through the 1950s added to their research, primarily focusing on the activity of <b>glycogen</b> <b>phosphorylase</b> in dog liver.

Biochemical determinations for <b>glycogen</b> and <b>phosphorylase</b> were carried out simultaneously. The results obtained were of interests on the relation betw een the histochemical staining reactions and the functional pathology. In the ischemic and toxic kidneys, the staining reactions indicated evidences of regeneration of the necrotoxic tubules. In the experimental hydronephrosis, however, functional impairments were straight progressive, although some of enzymatic activities were found to remain in some of tubullar cells even {{in the period of}} 30 days observation...|$|R
50|$|There {{has been}} a variety of {{evidence}} found biochemically to give evidence that glycosomes are present in cells. In the organelle that {{is assumed to be}} a glycosome, numerous proteins are found. These include <b>glycogen</b> synthase, <b>phosphorylase,</b> and branching and debranching enzymes for glycogen. All of these are regulatory enzymes that are needed in glycogen synthesis. The initiation of synthesis of glycogen requires glycogenin, found in glycosomes, a protein primer. Glycogen synthase as mentioned helps in glycogen elongation and the removal of the glucose from glycogen is aided by debranching enzymes and phosphorylase. All of these enzymes are found in the glycosome, showing that this organelle complete with glycogen as well is responsible for storing glycogen and separate from the cytosol.|$|R
40|$|Deletion and mutational {{analyses}} of the rat liver glycogen-targeting subunit (GL) of protein phosphatase 1 (PP 1) have identified three separate domains {{that are responsible for}} binding of PP 1, <b>glycogen</b> and <b>phosphorylase</b> a. The glycogen-binding domain spans the centre of GL between residues 144 and 231 and appears to be distinct from the glycogen-binding (storage) site of phosphorylase. The regulatory high-affinity binding site for phosphorylase a lies in the 16 amino acids at the C-terminus of GL. The PP 1 -binding domain is deduced to comprise the -RVXF- motif [Egloff, Johnson, Moorhead, Cohen and Barford (1997) EMBO J. 16, 1876 - 1887] located at residues 61 - 64 of GL and preceding lysine residues at positions 56, 57 and 59.

2500|$|In 1956 Edwin Krebs and Edmond Fischer {{discovered}} that adenosine triphosphate (ATP) {{is required for}} the conversion of <b>glycogen</b> <b>phosphorylase</b> b to <b>glycogen</b> <b>phosphorylase</b> a. While investigating the action of adrenaline on glycogenolysis the next year, Sutherland and Walter Wosilait reported that inorganic phosphate is released when the enzyme liver phosphorylase is inactivated; but when it is activated, it incorporates a phosphate. The “active factor” that the hormones produced [...] was finally purified in 1958, and then identified as containing a ribose, a phosphate, and an adenine in equal ratios. Further, it was proved that this factor reverted to 5’-AMP when it was inactivated.|$|E
2500|$|AMPK stimulates glucose uptake in {{skeletal}} muscle by phosphorylating [...] Rab-GTPase-activating protein TBC1D1, which ultimately induces fusion of GLUT4 vesicles with the plasma membrane.

2500|$|When {{the body}} needs glucose for energy, <b>glycogen</b> <b>phosphorylase,</b> {{with the help}} of an orthophosphate, can cleave away a {{molecule}} from the glycogen chain.

40|$|A {{detailed}} {{investigation was}} conducted to determine the precise subcellular localization of the rate-limiting enzymes of hepatic glycogen metabolism (<b>glycogen</b> synthase and <b>phosphorylase)</b> and their regulatory enzymes (synthase phosphatase and phosphorylase phosphatase). Rat liver was homogenized and fractionated to produce soluble, rough and smooth microsomal fractions. Enzyme assays of the fractions were performed, and {{the results showed that}} <b>glycogen</b> synthase and <b>phosphorylase</b> were located in the soluble fraction of the livers. Synthase phosphatase and phosphorylase phosphatase activities were also present in soluble fractions, but were clearly identified in both rough and smooth microsomal fractions. It is suggested that the location of smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) within the cytosome forms a microenvironment within hepatocytes that establishes conditions necessary for glycogen synthesis (and degradation). Thus the location of SER in the cell determines regions of the hepatocyte that are rich in glycogen particles. Furthermore, the demonstration of the association of synthase phosphatase and phosphorylase phosphatase with membranes of SER may account for the close morphological association of SER with glycogen particles (i. e., disposition of SER membranes brings the membrane-bound regulatory enzymes in close contact with their substrates) ...|$|R
40|$|Several enzymes and {{metabolites}} {{concerned with}} carbohydrate metabolism {{were examined in}} mice infected with Listeria monocytogenes.

There was {{a significant decrease in}} the activity of hepatic uridine diphosphate glucose-glycogen transglucosylase. This decrease in enzymatic activity correlated with the rate of <b>glycogen</b> depletion. <b>Phosphorylase</b> activity declined in a similar fashion, contraindicating enhanced glycogenolysis as the mechanism responsible for glycogen depletion.

2500|$|In liver cells, {{adrenaline}} binds to the β adrenergic receptor, which changes conformation {{and helps}} Gs, a G protein, exchange GDP to GTP. This trimeric G protein dissociates to Gs alpha and Gs beta/gamma subunits. Gs alpha binds to adenyl cyclase, thus converting ATP into cyclic AMP. Cyclic AMP binds to the regulatory subunit of protein kinase A: Protein kinase A phosphorylates phosphorylase kinase. Meanwhile, Gs beta/gamma binds to the calcium channel and allows calcium ions {{to enter the}} cytoplasm. Calcium ions bind to calmodulin proteins, a protein present in all eukaryotic cells, which then binds to phosphorylase kinase and finishes its activation.

50|$|Hormones such as epinephrine, insulin and {{glucagon}} regulate <b>glycogen</b> <b>phosphorylase</b> using {{second messenger}} amplification {{systems that are}} linked to G proteins. Glucagon activates adenylate cyclase through a seven transmembrane receptor coupled to Gs which, in turn, activates adenylate cyclase to increase intracellular concentrations of cAMP. cAMP binds to and releases an active form of protein kinase A (PKA). Next, PKA phosphorylates phosphorylase kinase, which, in turn, phosphorylates <b>glycogen</b> <b>phosphorylase</b> b, transforming it into the active <b>glycogen</b> <b>phosphorylase</b> a. This phosphorylation is added onto the <b>glycogen</b> <b>phosphorylase</b> b serine 14. In the liver, glucagon activates another G-protein-linked receptor that triggers a different cascade, resulting in the activation of Phospholipase C (PLC). PLC indirectly causes the release of calcium from the hepatocytes' endoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol. The increased calcium availability binds to the calmodulin subunit and activates <b>glycogen</b> <b>phosphorylase</b> kinase. <b>Glycogen</b> <b>phosphorylase</b> kinase activates <b>glycogen</b> <b>phosphorylase</b> {{in the same manner}} mentioned previously.|$|E

We now show that AMPK is inhibited by glycogen, particularly preparations with high branching content. We synthesized a series of branched oligosaccharides and show that those with a single α 1 → 6 branch are allosteric inhibitors that also inhibit phosphorylation by upstream kinases. Removal of the outer chains of <b>glycogen</b> using <b>phosphorylase,</b> thus exposing the outer branches, renders inhibition of AMPK more potent. Inhibition by all carbohydrates tested was dependent on the glycogen-binding domain being abolished by mutation of residues required for carbohydrate binding.

5000|$|PP1 plays {{a crucial}} role in the {{regulation}} of blood-glucose levels in the liver and glycogen metabolism. PP1 is important to the reciprocal regulation of glycogen metabolism by ensuring the opposite regulation of glycogen breakdown and <b>glycogen</b> synthesis. <b>Phosphorylase</b> a serves as a glucose sensor in liver cells. When glucose levels are low, phosphorylase a in its active R state has PP1 bound tightly. This binding to phosphorylase a prevents any phosphatase activity of PP1 and maintains the active phosphorylated configuration. Therefore, there phosphorylase a will accelerate glycogen breakdown until adequate levels of glucose are achieved. When glucose concentrations get too high, phosphorylase a is converted to its inactive, T state. By shifting phosphorylase a to its T state, PP1 dissociates from the complex. This dissociation activates glycogen synthase and converts phosphorylase a to phosphorylase b. It should be noted that phosphorylase b does not bind PP1 allowing PP1 to remain activated.|$|R

These observations suggest a temperature-dependent mechanism for the preferential synthesis of {{one or the other}} sugar reserve. Here we show that concomitant with these shifts of temperature, occurred reversible changes in the activities of <b>glycogen</b> synthase and <b>phosphorylase.</b> <b>Glycogen</b> synthase was inactivated at 45 °C while phosphorylase was activated. The reverse was true when the cells were shifted back to 30 °C. Addition of cycloheximide did not prevent the reversible enzymatic changes, which remained stable after gel filtration. Apparently, the effects of temperature shifts occurred at the level of reversible covalent enzymatic modifications. Trehalose- 6 -phosphate synthase properties were also affected by temperature. For instance, the enzyme was less sensitive to in vitro inhibition by inorganic phosphate at 50 °C than at 30 °C. Fructose- 6 -phosphate partially relieved the inhibitory effect of phosphate at 30 °C but not at 50 °C. These effects of the assay temperature, inorganic phosphate, and fructose- 6 -phosphate, on trehalose- 6 -phosphate synthase activity, were more evident for crude extracts obtained from heat-shocked cells.
