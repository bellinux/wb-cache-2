50|$|<b>Infantile</b> <b>beriberi</b> {{occurs in}} infants breast-fed by thiamin-deficient mothers (who may show {{no sign of}} {{thiamine}} deficiency). Infants may manifest cardiac, aphonic, or pseudomeningitic forms of the disorder. Infants with cardiac beriberi frequently exhibit a loud piercing cry, vomiting, and tachycardia. Convulsions are not uncommon, and death may ensue if thiamine is not administered promptly.|$|E
50|$|Beriberi {{refers to}} {{symptoms}} caused by thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency. Beriberi has conventionally been {{divided into three}} separate entities, relating to the body system mainly involved (peripheral nervous system or cardiovascular) or age of person (like <b>infantile).</b> <b>Beriberi</b> {{is one of several}} thiamine-deficiency related conditions, which may occur concurrently, including Wernicke's encephalopathy (mainly affecting the central nervous system), Korsakoff's syndrome (amnesia with additional psychiatric manifestations), and Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (with both neurologic and psychiatric symptoms).|$|E
5000|$|He then {{served in}} the Philippines, where he saw and studied {{tropical}} diseases (especially beriberi and scurvy). U.S. Army medical officers were conducting much research into the possible causes of beriberi, initially using animal subjects. Vedder became convinced {{by the work of}} Christiaan Eijkman and Gerrit Grijns and others that beri-beri was indeed caused by a nutritional deficiency. He enlisted the help of Robert R. Williams of the Bureau of Science in Manila in isolating the [...] "anti-beri-beri factor". In 1911, Vedder and Maj. Weston P. Chamberlain, who had become members of the Tropical Disease Board in 1910, began experimenting with the treatment of <b>infantile</b> <b>beriberi</b> with an extract of rice polishings (or partially milled rice, an alcohol-based extract of rice hulls). Williams set out to isolate the ingredient responsible, but his work was deferred with a career change to chemistry for Bell Telephone Company. Other physicians had already tried feeding the polishings to nursing mothers. Believing the problem to be a poison in the mother's milk, they required that each baby be exclusively bottle-fed until the mother's treatment had been completed. Vedder and Chamberlain cured 15 infants whose mothers had symptoms of beriberi by supplementing each mother's milk with an extract of rice polishings and allowing nursing to continue. In every case, regardless of the seriousness of the baby's condition, the cure was rapid and complete. The experiment demonstrated conclusively that beriberi was a deficiency disease rather than the result of a toxin in the mother's milk. In 1913 Vedder published a seminal book on the subject. (As an aside, work slowdown during the Great Depression allowed Williams to return to beri-beri research, and it was not until 1933 when he successfully isolated its vitamin preventative in quantity. In 1936 he first synthesized it and named it thiamine [...] - [...] vitamin B1 having been its original designation.) ...|$|E

40|$|Background: Before its recognition, <b>infantile</b> <b>beriberi</b> was {{the leading}} cause of infant death in camps for {{displaced}} persons of the Karen ethnic minority on Thailand’s western border. Objective: This study aimed to document thiamine status in the peripartum period to examine the current supplementation program and the correlation between the clinical manifesta-tions of thiamine deficiency and a biochemical measure of thi-amine status. Design: Women were enrolled prospectively at 30 wk of gesta-tion and were followed up weekly until delivery and at 3 mo postpartum. Thiamine supplementation during pregnancy was based on patient symptoms. Results: At 3 mo postpartum, thiamine deficiency reflected by an erythrocyte transketolase activity (ETKA) ≥ 1. 20 % was found in 57. 7 % (15 / 26) of mothers, 26. 9 % (7 / 26) of whom had severe deficiency (ETKA> 1. 25 %). No significant associations between ETKA and putative maternal symptoms or use of thiamine sup-plements were found. Conclusions: Biochemical postpartum thiamine deficiency is still common in Karen refugee women. This situation may be improved by educating lactating women to reduce their con-sumption of thiaminase-containing foods and by implementing an effective thiamine supplementation program.

40|$|<b>Infantile</b> <b>beriberi,</b> or {{clinical}} thiamin (vitamin B 1) {{deficiency in}} infants, is a forgotten disease in Asia, where 100 {{years ago it}} was a major public health problem. Infants with this deficiency, commonly aged ∼ 2 – 3 months, present in cardiac failure but usually rapidly improve if given thiamin injections. It remains relatively common in Vientiane, Lao PDR (Laos), probably because of prolonged intra- and post-partum food avoidance behaviours. Clinical disease may be the tip of an iceberg with subclinical thiamin deficiency contributing to sickness in infants without overt clinical beriberi. We therefore recruited 778 sick infants admitted during one year at Mahosot Hospital, Vientiane, without clinical evidence of beriberi, and performed erythrocyte transketolase (ETK) assays. 13. 4 % of infants had basal ETK< 0. 59 micromoles/min/gHb suggesting biochemical thiamin deficiency. Mortality was 5. 5 % but, among infants ≥ 2 months old, mortality was higher in those with basal ETK< 0. 59 micromoles/min/gHb (3 / 47, 6. 4 %) than in those with basal ETK≥ 0. 59 micromoles/min/gHb (1 / 146, 0. 7 %) (P =  0. 045, relative risk =  9. 32 (95 %CI 0. 99 to 87. 5)). We conclude that clinically unapparent thiamin deficiency is common among sick infants (≥ 2 months old) admitted to hospital in Vientiane. This may contribute to mortality and a low clinical threshold for providing thiamin to sick infants may be needed...|$|E

From March to June 2010, four suspected infants with thiamine deficiency were admitted to Luang Namtha Provincial hospital. All recovered after parenteral thiamine injection. Between 2007 and 2009, 54 infants with possible/probable thiamine deficiency were diagnosed with acute severe cardiac failure, 49 (90. 2 %) were cured after parenteral thiamine; three died (5. 6 %). In the 22 villages, of 468 live born infants, 50 (10. 6 %, 95 % CI: 8. 0 - 13. 8) died during the first year. A peak of mortality (36 deaths) was reported between 1 and 3 months. Verbal autopsy suggested that 17 deaths (3. 6 %) were due to suspected infantile thiamine deficiency. Of 127 mothers, 60 (47. 2 %) reported edema and paresthesia {{as well as a}} positive squat test during pregnancy; 125 (98. 4 %) respected post-partum food avoidance and all ate polished rice. Of 127 infants, 2 (1. 6 %) had probable thiamine deficiency, and 8 (6. 8 %) possible thiamine deficiency.

40|$|Background Thiamine {{deficiency}} {{is thought}} to be an issue in Cambodia and throughout Southeast Asia due to frequent clinical reports of <b>infantile</b> <b>beriberi.</b> However the extent of this public health issue is currently unknown {{due to a lack of}} population-representative data. Therefore we assessed the thiamine status (measured as erythrocyte thiamine diphosphate concentrations; eThDP) among a representative sample of Cambodian women of childbearing age (15 - 49 y) and their young children (6 - 69 mo). Methodology/Principle findings Samples for this cross-sectional analysis were collected as part of a national micronutrient survey linked to the Cambodian Demographic and Health Survey (CDHS) 2014. One-sixth of households taking part in the CDHS were randomly selected and re-visited for additional blood sampling for eThDP analysis (719 women and 761 children). Thiamine status was assessed using different cut-offs from literature. Women were mean (SD) 30 (6) y, and children (46 % girls) were 41 (17) mo. Women had lower mean (95 % Cl) eThDP of 150 nmol/L (146 - 153) compared to children, 174 nmol/L (171 - 179; P < 0. 001). Using the most conservative cut-off of eThDP < 120 nmol/ L, 27 % of mothers and 15 % of children were thiamine deficient, however prevalence rates of deficiency were as high as 78 % for mothers and 58 % for children using a cut-off of < 180 nmol/L. Thiamine deficiency was especially prevalent among infants aged 6 - 12 mo: 38 % were deficient using the most conservative cut-off (< 120 nmol/L). Conclusions/Significance There is a lack of consensus on thiamine status cut-offs; more research is required to set clinically meaningful cut-offs. Despite this, there is strong evidence of suboptimal thiamine status among Cambodian mothers and their children, with infants < 12 mo at the highest risk. Based on eThDP from this nationally-representative sample, immediate action is required to address thiamine deficiency in Cambodia, and likely throughout Southeast Asia...|$|E
