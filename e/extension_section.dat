2500|$|The Madrid–Seville {{high-speed}} railway line connects Madrid with Seville in {{the south}} of Spain, passing through the cities of Ciudad Real, Puertollano and Córdoba, where the Madrid–Málaga high-speed rail line branches off towards Málaga just outside Los Mochos near Almodóvar del Río. [...] The route travels across the plains of Castile, travelling through the Sierra Morena mountains just before reaching Córdoba, before going onward towards Seville through the largely flat land surrounding the Guadalquivir river. The Madrid–Seville line was the first dedicated passenger high-speed rail line to be built in Spain and was completed in time for Seville's Expo 92.

50|$|The Touch Base Policy {{failed to}} halt the influx of immigrants, and was {{abolished}} by the Hong Kong Government on 24 October 1980. Immigrants coming directly from the Mainland on or before 23 October 1980 were required to register for a Hong Kong Identity Card in a 3-day grace-period (24-26 of October 1980). Illegal immigrants arriving on or after 24 October 1980 were repatriated immediately, and it became compulsory for Hong Kong residents to carry their identity cards in public areas. That made the eligible immigrants who 'touched base' before the deadline rush to the Chinese <b>Extension</b> <b>Section</b> of the Immigration Department for identity registration.|$|E
50|$|The tool {{consists}} {{of at least}} two concentric pipes which are forming two hydraulic channels - one for pumping down a high-pressure working agent (water) and second for delivering pregnant slurry back to the surface. A BHM tool usually has (down-up): an eductor (waterjet pump) section, a hydromonitor section, an <b>extension</b> <b>section</b> and a hub, connecting it all to a drill pipe string. This string extends the tool up to the surface. Above the surface, the tool has a swivel allowing its suspension and rotation in a hole, and also connections to the working agent supply (pump station) and a slurry collector. A drill rig is normally required to operate a BHM tool.|$|E

50|$|Immediately {{past this}} interchange, Route 168 narrows to four lanes and intersects CR 650, {{crossing}} the Newton Creek, where it forms {{the border between}} Camden {{to the west and}} Haddon Township to the east. Here, the route crosses US 130 at a channelized intersection. After crossing over US 130, Route 168 drops the Black Horse Pike designation and becomes Mount Ephraim Avenue as is runs between the Fairview section of Camden and the West Collingswood <b>Extension</b> <b>section</b> of Haddon Township. Here, the route narrows to a two-lane undivided road and passes through urban areas. It crosses over CR 630 before it becomes a three-lane road with a center left-turn lane and entirely enters Camden. The road crosses the North Branch of the Newton Creek, where it forms the border between Camden to the west and Woodlynne to the east. It becomes a four-lane undivided road that passes through industrial sectors before crossing a Conrail Shared Assets Operations railroad line and heading past more urban development.
