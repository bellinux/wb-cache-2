5|$|In 1871, Dmitri Mendeleev {{predicted}} {{the existence of}} an element between thorium and uranium. The actinide element group was unknown at the time. Therefore, uranium was positioned below tungsten in group VI, and thorium below zirconium in <b>group</b> <b>IV,</b> leaving the space below tantalum in group V empty and, until the 1950s, periodic tables were published with this structure. For a long time chemists searched for eka-tantalum as an element with similar chemical properties to tantalum, making a discovery of protactinium nearly impossible. Tantalum's heavier analogue was later found to be the transuranic element dubnium.|$|E
5|$|In the {{periodic}} table published by Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869, thorium and the rare-earth elements were placed outside {{the main body of}} the table, at the end of each vertical period after the alkaline earth metals. This reflected the belief at that time that thorium and the rare-earth metals were divalent. With the later recognition that the rare earths were mostly trivalent and thorium was tetravalent, Mendeleev moved cerium and thorium to <b>group</b> <b>IV</b> in 1871, which contained the modern carbon group (group 14), titanium group (group 4), cerium, and thorium, because their maximum oxidation state was +4. Cerium was soon removed from {{the main body of the}} table and placed in a separate lanthanide series; thorium was left with group 4 as it had similar properties to its supposed lighter congeners in that group, such as titanium and zirconium.|$|E
