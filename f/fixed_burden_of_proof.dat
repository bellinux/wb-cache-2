After making clear the role <b>of</b> the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> in defining the difference of opinion in argumentative confrontations, the author outlines the constraints imposed by practices of political accountability on the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof.</b> Finally, she analyzes in detail a concrete case in which a politician maneuvers {{in such a way that}} his <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> is significantly diminished...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{problems}} {{pertaining to the}} allocation <b>of</b> the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> in mixed disputes in legal and non-legal contexts are addressed. First the traditional view on the allocation <b>of</b> the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> based on Whately’s legal conception of ‘presumption’ is discussed. Whately’s proposal is not adequate for the solution of problems related to the allocation <b>of</b> the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> in everyday mixed disputes {{where there is no}} presumption of status quo. Using the pragma-dialectical perspective it is explained how practical questions regarding the division <b>of</b> the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> are solved in a legal context. It is shown that for argumentation theory, the combination of material and procedural rules for the allocation <b>of</b> the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> offer an instrument for the allocation <b>of</b> the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> in both legal and non-legal discussions...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the author {{presents}} the evolution <b>of</b> <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> in {{criminal and civil}} procedure. In civil procedural law there are {{the differences between the}} <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> in subjective, and that in objective sense. In criminal procedural law there are the differences between the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> in formal, and that in material sense. The <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> in objective sense and the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> in material sense is a specific working method available to court after the evidence procedure is carried out, when the use of free assessment of evidence method did not result in its conviction that a certain disputed legally relevant fact is true, which disables the court to form the factual substratum of the judgment. A particular attention is paid to the discussion of the principle in dubio pro reo and its differences from <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> in civil procedure...|$|R

40|$|The concept <b>of</b> <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> is {{fundamentally}} important in argumentation studies. We know, for example, {{that it is}} very closely related to, and necessary for the study of informal fallacies, like the fallacy of argument from ignorance. But procedural methods for dealing with issues <b>of</b> <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> in argumentation have been worked out and applied in most detail in the field of law. There is controversy, however, concerning the extent to which legal methods for defining and determining <b>burdens</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> {{can be applied to the}} study <b>of</b> problems <b>of</b> <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> arising in everyday conversational argumentation, and other context like forensic debate. In the recent literature doubts have been expressed about whether the model <b>of</b> <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> in law can be transferred to the study <b>of</b> how <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> operates in everyday conversational argumentation. In this paper we argue that the two different settings of argument use share an underlying dialectical structure that brings out some common elements that are useful to know about with regard to studying <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof.</b> We argue that knowledge of these common elements enables us to derive many important lessons for argumentation theory as applied to nonlegal setting...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The concept <b>of</b> <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> {{is used in}} a {{wide range}} of discourses, from {{philosophy}} to law, science, skepticism, and even in everyday reasoning. This paper provides an analysis of the proper deployment <b>of</b> <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof,</b> focusing in particular on skeptical discussions of pseudoscience and the paranormal, where <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> assignments are most poignant and relatively clear-cut. We argue that <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> is often misapplied or used as a mere rhetorical gambit, with little appreciation of the underlying principles. The paper elaborates on an important distinction between evidential and prudential varieties <b>of</b> <b>burdens</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof,</b> which is cashed out in terms of Bayesian probabilities and error management theory. Finally, we explore the relationship between <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> and several (alleged) informal logical fallacies. This allows us to get a firmer grip on the concept and its applications in different domains, and also to clear up some confusions with regard to when exactly some fallacies (ad hominem, ad ignorantiam, and petitio principii) may or may not occur...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper is to analyze, how rules <b>of</b> the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> and rules <b>of</b> the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> argumentation justify a thesis, which is found as a true {{statement}} by court. Two concepts of the truth discussed in the Polish civil procedure (the objective/material truth and the judicial truth) are compared {{in connection with the}} rules <b>of</b> the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> and the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> argumentation. The rules <b>of</b> <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> and the rules <b>of</b> the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> argumentation are constitutive rules. They state under what conditions a thesis counts as justified. The justification of a decision of applying law based on the rules <b>of</b> the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> or rules <b>of</b> the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> argumentation is institutional, not substantial...|$|R

25|$|The {{party that}} does not carry the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> carries the benefit of {{assumption}} of being correct, they are presumed to be correct, until the burden shifts after presentation of evidence by the party bringing the action.

Some sample dialogues are analysed of types of situations where such a shift may occur, viz. reasoning with defeasible rules, reasoning with argumentation schemes and reasoning with mere presumptions. It is argued that whether {{a shift in the}} <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> occurs can itself become the subject of dispute and it is shown how a dialogue game protocol for persuasion can be extended to let it regulate persuasion dialogues about the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof.</b> It is also shown that dialogues about the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> are often implicitly about the precise form of the rules used in an argument. 1...|$|R

50|$|In a {{philosophical}} debate, {{there is an}} implicit <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> on the party asserting a claim, since the default position is generally one of neutrality or unbelief.

40|$|This {{research}} investigated {{whether the}} <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> instruction in criminal jury trials introduces a confirmation bias. The <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> instruction {{is one of}} two instructions intended to ensure the presumption of innocence and protect the defendant by placing the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> guilt entirely on the prosecution. Previous studies on jury instructions have found evidence of backfire effects with some instructions having unintended effects on jurors’ decision-making. To date most research on instructions has also focussed on comprehension rather than application of instructions. Therefore, this study investigated whether the application <b>of</b> the standard <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> instruction would have an unintended effect by placing jurors in a confirming frame of mind. Student mock jurors (N = 161) listened to a simulated trial with a between-subjects manipulation <b>of</b> <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> (standard or none) and case strength (strong or weak). Jurors gave a verdict and completed a questionnaire on their perceptions of the case. It was hypothesised that verdict, guilt likelihood, and elaboration about evidence would be less sensitive to case strength in the standard burden condition than the no burden condition. Results showed that verdict, perception of guilt likelihood, and level of elaboration were explained by evidence strength alone with no significant effects <b>of</b> <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> or differences in sensitivity to case strength. Therefore the hypothesis of a confirmation bias was not supported. This confirmed some previous findings in the literature that jurors use evidence more than instructions in decision-making. Findings are discussed in terms of the jurors’ lack of apparent bias and their limited attention to or comprehension <b>of</b> the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> instruction...|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates whether current nonmonotonic logics are {{suitable}} for formalising the defeasibility of legal reasoning.

It is argued that the two currently available modelling approaches both have some shortcomings. On the one hand, techniques for modelling <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> in nonmonotonic logics do not allow for shifts <b>of</b> the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> from one party to the other. On the other hand, current procedural models of legal argument are too rigid, in that every counterargument induces a shift <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> burdens; this fails to respect that in legal reasoning burden shifts only occur in some cases. It is then shown how current dialectical models of defeasible reasoning {{can be adapted to}} overcome these shortcomings...|$|R
