5|$|It {{was some}} time {{afterward}} when the thought flashed upon {{my mind that}} the disturbances I had observed {{might be due to}} an intelligent control. Although I could not decipher their meaning, it was impossible <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of them as having been entirely accidental. The feeling is constantly growing on me that I had been the first to hear the greeting of one planet to another.|$|E
500|$|Introspection {{was also}} listed {{as one of}} the {{foundational}} themes prevalent on the album, along with [...] "genuine statements of personal and careerist reflection scattered among the posturing of 'Bitch I'm Madonna' and 'Unapologetic Bitch'" [...] according to Slant Magazines Sam C. Mac as well as her [...] "obsessive self-regard". Madonna explained to Jon Pareles of The New York Times that although she has never looked back at her past endeavors, reminiscing about it felt right for Rebel Heart. [...] "And it's bittersweet <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about that. It just seemed like a time where I wanted to stop and look back. It's kind of like survivor guilt. How did I make it and they didn't?" [...] During the album's development phase, she became comfortable expressing her ideas in front of a few people, comparing it to: [...] "writing your diary in front of somebody and reading it out loud... It was almost like an acting exercise, you know, just putting myself in a room and letting ideas flow even if I didn't feel so connected to the people".|$|E
2500|$|Dylan {{talked about}} his {{difficulty}} at the recording sessions {{in an interview with}} Guitar World magazine. [...] "I lose my inspiration in the studio real easy, and it's very difficult <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that I'm going to eclipse anything I've ever done before. I get bored easily, and my mission, which starts out wide, becomes very dim after a few failed takes and this and that." [...] In the same interview Dylan cited Buddy Holly as an influence during the recording sessions.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{have lived}} and thought {{only as a}} woman, as become my sex and station," [...] Alice meekly replied; [...] "and when it shall be {{necessary}} <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> live and <b>think</b> otherwise, I should wish to die." ...|$|R
2500|$|The Rev. Moon has a {{very good}} sense of humor. It's hard <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of a person as being mean or {{brainwashing}} people with the sense of humor he has. He truly loves people. I mean, he likes being with them. He likes being kidded-he likes being teased. I never saw a mean act on his part. [...] He never asked for special treatment. He mopped floors and cleaned tables, and he helped other people when he was finished with his job.|$|E
60|$|There {{was silence}} between {{us for a}} while. It was {{possible}} <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>think.</b>|$|E

6000|$|... "Sure. But it's hard <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be idle. <b>Think</b> of me lying {{still all}} day {{with nothing to do}} but read! That's what knocked me out. I wouldn't have minded the pain if I could have gotten about.... Columbine, I've moved in!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then do this <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> Allow <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that I {{have not}} yet had an answer to my proposal; give <b>me</b> <b>to</b> this day month, to Christmas; till any time that you like to name, so that I may {{think that it is}} not yet settled, and may tell Uncle Christopher that such is the case." ...|$|R

60|$|This was charming. She {{was such}} an {{extremely}} agreeable young person that it was delightful <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of myself in any way as her husband's successor.|$|E

40|$|I {{would like}} to thank Dr. David Gross of SJSU <b>for</b> guiding <b>me</b> and the rest of my class through the process of writing {{academic}} articles, Dr. Afshin Marashi and Dr. Erika Gasser of CSUS <b>for</b> introducing <b>me</b> <b>to</b> Foucault, my supervisor Jennifer Ware, MLS, <b>for</b> encouraging <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> critically about the collection development process, and my family and boyfriend for tolerating with my maunderings about power and the library.

40|$|As all the {{graduates}} {{who have gone}} before me know from personal experience, {{it would be impossible}} to successfully navigate graduate school without the help and support of an army of people. In my case, I have many people to thank. I have been incredibly fortunate to have a committee comprised of people with enormous intellect, varied strengths, and good humor. My advisors, Christopher Federico and Eugene Borgida, have guided and supported me throughout my education. When it comes to my dissertation specifically, I have to thank Chris especially <b>for</b> challenging <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> carefully about my hypotheses, methodology and analyses. Every quantitative researcher should be so lucky as to have a stats genius for an advisor. His seemingly limitless knowledge awed me on countless occasions, and most certainly saved my experiment in chapter 4. I must thank Gene, in particular, <b>for</b> reminding <b>me</b> <b>to</b> always <b>think</b> about the big picture, including both the theoretical and real-world implications of all of my research. He has an impressive ability to cut through academic bureaucracy, which I benefited from numerous times. Marti Gonzales, although not my official advisor, served as an academic (and life) mentor throughou...|$|R

Keck Foundation for essays on the topic: To what extent should the ethical responsibilities of a lawyer in civil litigation include the obligation to assist the judge or jury in arriving at the truth? I am grateful to the W. M. Keck Foundation for pressing the important dialogue about how our legal system and those who work in it ought to serve our society and <b>for</b> forcing <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> again about why we lawyers are who we are.

40|$|A true {{information}} and political earthquake {{resulted from the}} collision of the two great plates of internet freedom and US diplomacy. The epicenter? Wikileaks, a well known website led by Julian Assange since 2006 that encourages online whistle-blowing with the guarantee to keep the source a secret. Coming from Chile, it is difficult <b>for</b> <b>me</b> not <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about earthquakes when describing such a big political crash. However, being fair with Wikileaks, earthquakes have a doubtless destructive power that the website arguably does not have: at least the picture of Wikileaks {{is one of a}} rich variety of grey, rather than plain black or white...|$|R
60|$|The plot {{seemed too}} diabolical and too {{improbable}} {{for anybody to}} believe. Jack could hardly think it possible when his new friend told him. But the stranger persisted so--it's hard <b>for</b> <b>me</b> even <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of him as quite really my father--that Jack at last brought out two or three earlier photographs I'd given him some time before; and his visitor recognised them at once, in all their stages, as his own daughter. This roused Jack's curiosity. He determined to hunt the matter up with his unknown connection. And he hunted it up thenceforward with deliberate care, till he proved every word of it.|$|R
60|$|Well, {{this did}} not satisfy <b>me,</b> <b>for</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of going <b>to</b> service was such a frightful thing <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> {{that if she had}} assured me I should not have gone till I was twenty years old, {{it would have been the}} same to me; I should have cried, I believe, all the time, with the very {{apprehension}} of its being to be so at last.|$|R

You know that I have a brother who is {{eternally}} banished from home, whose life I honestly believe my father's severity has ruined. I saw him in London not long ago, and he sent a message to you. It is very painful <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> even <b>think</b> of it, Douglas, for I always believed my father to be a just man. He has let you believe that you were a pauper. My brother {{told me that it was}} not true--that there was plenty of money for your education, and that there should be some to come to you. There, I have told you!

30|$|It’s hard <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> know. I <b>think</b> that in Cyert and March (1963), we {{basically}} {{said that a}} lot of behavior is routine. Organizations have standardized operating procedures and they follow standard operating procedures, that’s a lot of the behavior. Nelson and Winter (1982) came along and said, “Those look like genes,” and we can build an evolutionary theory around the idea that it is routine based behavior. I think, on the whole, that was a very interesting, good direction to go.|$|R

From the {{beginning}} of my graduate career, Paul Wilson has provided invaluable advice, support, and assistance.

In addition, he has been a great source of information on the economics profession in general and has been a wonderful mentor. For his unending patience, effort, and confidence in me, I am most appreciative. I am very grateful to David Sibley for his insight into economic modeling and his help with the job market. Many thanks to my dissertation committee members for their comments, especially Jim Burgess, <b>for</b> challenging <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about health economics from a different perspective.
