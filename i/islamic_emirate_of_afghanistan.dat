The Taliban entered Kabul on September 27, 1996, and established the <b>Islamic</b> <b>Emirate</b> <b>of</b> <b>Afghanistan.</b> Analysts described the Taliban then as developing into a proxy force for Pakistan's regional interests.|$|E

By 1996, however, they had regrouped with massive military support by Pakistan and financial support by Saudi Arabia. In September 1996 they took power in Kabul and established the <b>Islamic</b> <b>Emirate</b> <b>of</b> <b>Afghanistan.</b> The United Islamic Front (Northern Alliance) was created under the leadership of Ahmad Shah Massoud as a military-political resistance force against the Taliban Emirate which was backed militarily by Pakistan's Army and enforced by several thousand Al Qaeda fighters from Arab countries and Central Asia.|$|E

Many stadiums, like Ghazi Stadium of Kabul, were either destroyed or converted into venues for public executions and punishments. Women were banned from taking part in any type of sport; male athletes were allowed to participate in a few sports, but were forced to wear long sleeves, trousers and beards.

The Taliban seized Kabul in the same month and established the <b>Islamic</b> <b>Emirate</b> <b>of</b> <b>Afghanistan.</b> They imposed a strict form of Sharia, similar to that found in Saudi Arabia. According to Physicians for Human Rights (PHR), [...] "no other regime in the world has methodically and violently forced half of its population into virtual house arrest, prohibiting them on pain of physical punishment from showing their faces, seeking medical care without a male escort, or attending school" [...] (this statement, though, was made in 1998, long before the advent of ISIS which has imposed even tougher and more violent sharia controls).|$|E

As a result, the Progress Party continued their call for the imprisonment of Krekar, and the Labour Party stated for the first time they would form a new task force which would examine if people officially labeled as [...] "danger to national security" [...] could be imprisoned.
