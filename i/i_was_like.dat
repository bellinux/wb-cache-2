5|$|It was {{a little}} strange. And {{definitely}} when I {{walked down the aisle}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>like,</b> 'This is kind of creepy — there’s some other man standing there!' It was really beautiful. People were all really excited like it was really my wedding. My mother was even like, 'Aww', and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>like,</b> 'Mom, it's a video. This is not my dress. This is not the real wedding.' But I think it’s just one of those moments that every woman kind of fantasizes and relives.|$|E
5|$|It's like a 90's, throwback-type vibe, when I said 'I {{want it to}} {{look like}} this,' I said like a TLC, Fresh Prince type vibe. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>like,</b> 'Let's just get really silly, 90's amazing outfits, and {{just go out and}} dance around and have fun.|$|E
5|$|When I got {{the call}} , <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>like,</b> 'I don't know if that's me. She was like, 'Nah, it's gonna be your type of beat.' I'm like, 'Oh, for real?' Then when Hov called he said, 'I'm gonna do it with you.' <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>like,</b> 'Dag, this is big.' But when I did it, I kept it me and kept it 'hood. At first I ain't think she was gonna like it but she called and said she loved it. From there it was a wrap. That's history. Mariah is known for doing remixes with street cats from Mobb Deep to O.D.B., so {{to be a part}} of that was a good look for me and the Def Jam movement.|$|E
60|$|MARION. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> glad <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>like</b> her. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{glad that}} <b>I</b> have met you.|$|R

5|$|I didn't {{even know}} the project was coming out. I didn't know what the beat was for; I just knew Eminem asked me for the files and I sent it to them.... When I saw Eminem in L.A. for Grammy weekend, Eminem said, 'Yeah, he ripped the track.' Later on that day, I met Royce, and Royce was like, 'Yeah, {{download}} that track man. We ripped that track. That's the first single.' <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>like,</b> 'What?' But until then, I still wasn't sure.|$|E
5|$|When {{asked in}} an {{interview}} with Robert Canning of IGN about how she felt about being asked to come on to Angel after previously being killed off, Benz commented: I was shocked. I just thought once you poof'd, you poof'd! I thought that was it. So when they threw it out to me that I was coming back... They didn't tell me they were bringing her back to life. They just sent me the script for the season finale for season one of Angel, when they rose me from the dead. I was reading the script, and half way through, Darla still hadn't shown up. Benz went on to add, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>like,</b> 'Alright...' I get three quarters of the way through and I think, 'Maybe they sent me the wrong script...?' And then I get to the last page, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>like,</b> 'Oh my god! I can't believe this! This is so cool!' At that time I'd been committed to another project too. We didn't even know if I was going to be available or not. But it all ended up working out.|$|E
5|$|You are right. I did {{not think}} anything. I wasn’t thinking. I was feeling and I was dying. And then I was just like, You can’t go down like this! You have to turn this into music. You have to try, at least. I was so embarrassed by just everything. I just didn’t {{want to be that}} person that just went down after all of that. A lot of the time in the sessions, they weren’t letting me write. They were giving me tracks and doing it all. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>like,</b> Why am I here? Then I got the perfect {{combination}} of people to really support me and make me feel confident. It was an amazing awakening. I walked into the session and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>like,</b> You gotta know, I don’t care about anything except the truth right here.|$|E

5|$|It's {{about how}} people take drugs to connect to God or {{to a higher level}} of consciousness. I keep saying, 'Plugging into the matrix'. If you get high, you can do that, which is why a lot of people drop acid or do drugs, because they want to get closer to God. But there's going to be a short circuit, and that's the {{illusion}} of drugs, because they give you the illusion of getting closer to God, but ultimately they kill you. They destroy you. I mean, I tried everything once, but as soon as I was high, I spent my time drinking tons of water {{to get it out of}} my system. As soon as I was high, I was obsessed with flushing it out of me. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>like,</b> 'OK, I'm done now'.|$|E
5|$|Sia {{is one of}} them. She comes in, singer-songwriter, {{she just}} writes the most {{beautiful}} amazing ballads. Now she is making a name for herself on a more broad commercial scale {{with a lot of}} more dance-driven stuff, and she is just an incredible singer. She came in and she just writes such serious songs, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> 'Oh she is gunna be such a serious person, and I'm nervous to meet her, and I just want her to get me and understand that I'm not a cheesy pop star'. She comes in and she was all nervous, and she is the most bubbliest person in the world, but once she starts singing and getting into her thing, you're just sucked into this world of 'wow' and it's inspiring to be around people with such creative energy. I love that, that's the best experience.|$|E
25|$|That pinch (arrest) {{changed my}} whole life. I never, ever stopped a second {{from there on}} in. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> a madman. Never stopped stealing. Never stopped robbing. I was obsessed.|$|E
60|$|PHOEBE (pouting). La, sir, {{you mean}} <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>like</b> Aunt Phoebe. Every one says so--and indeed 'tis no compliment.|$|R

60|$|FILIPPO. Shelves and hooks, {{shelves and}} hooks, and when I see the shelves <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>like</b> to hang {{myself on the}} hooks.|$|R
25|$|I {{wanted to}} do {{something}} refreshing and different, so I mixed genres and drew inspiration from touring, traveling, watching rock bands, and attending festivals… <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> a mad scientist, putting lots of different songs together. Boyz II Men were the first ones to put Destiny's Child on tour. They showed us how to treat an opening act and I will never forget that. That was 15 years ago! Wow, 15 years! I'm old.|$|E
500|$|... “Gorgeous was one {{of those}} records that, as soon as I heard the beat, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>like,</b> ‘Man, this is the one. This is that 'This Can’t Be Life' Kanye beat. This is that classic ‘Ye beat. I want to be on this.’ I came up to him, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>like,</b> ‘Man, are you working on this record? Are you working on this beat?’ He goes, ‘Yeah … do you got an idea for it?’ <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>like,</b> ‘Yeah, I might. I didn’t. I was lying like a motherfucker. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>like,</b> ‘Yeah, man, I want to get on this joint.” ...|$|E
500|$|... "The {{song was}} so amazing I {{had to be}} sure, as an artist, that she really was trying {{to give it to}} me. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> 'is she really trying to give me this song, because it's pretty amazing.' They were like 'yes, but she wants to stay on it with you.' And <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>like,</b> 'Wow! Beyoncé? Thanks!' And you know I love and respect her to death so I wouldn't pass that chance up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, mamma thinks her too old; but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> sure <b>I</b> {{hope she}} <b>is</b> to develope more. I {{do not think}} you or <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>like</b> her at fifteen." ...|$|R

500|$|... "I said, I don't think it's fair because I don't {{think they}} showed {{when it first}} was said, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>like,</b> 'If someone's a racist, they should be portrayed as one. You shouldn't edit it {{to make them look}} good.'" ...|$|E
500|$|In September 1990, Buzz Osborne of the Melvins {{introduced}} the band to Dave Grohl, {{who was looking}} for a new band following the sudden break-up of Washington, D.C., hardcore punks Scream. A few days after arriving in Seattle, Novoselic and Cobain auditioned Grohl, with Novoselic later stating, [...] "We knew in two minutes that he was the right drummer". Grohl later told Q [...] "I remember being {{in the same room with}} them and thinking, 'What? Thats Nirvana? Are you kidding?'" [...] and [...] "Because on their record cover they looked like psycho lumberjacks... <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>like,</b> 'What, that little dude and that big motherfucker? You're kidding me'. I laughed. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>like,</b> 'No way'".|$|E
500|$|... "I {{had already}} raved over the record because it leaked. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> listen, {{there is no}} way this [...] be on your album, you'd have to be crazy. He was like 'Really, you think so?' <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> c'mon man we got to stop {{treating}} rap like oh it came out it's dead. When it's good, we have to make people love it and digest it. We can't treat this like mixtape throwaways like everybody else does. Everybody else does half-ass music. So what people don't know is that what Kanye did during that album is literally, I walked into the studio and I had the pick of 17 records and he was like {{do what you want to}} do to any of these, do what you like." ...|$|E
60|$|Bel. Umph! now I {{begin to}} taste it; <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>like</b> the drunken tinker in the play, a great prince, and never knew it.|$|R

6000|$|... 'It <b>is</b> <b>like</b> a workman {{getting up}} to go to work,' thought Gudrun. 'And <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>like</b> a workman's wife.' But an ache <b>like</b> nausea <b>was</b> upon her: a nausea of him.|$|R
500|$|It {{was about}} getting revenge. People were always hating on me, because I was different. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>like,</b> [...] "I'm going to sing, I'm {{going to do}} this, I'm going to do that," [...] they were like [...] "OK, sure you are." [...] And <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> [...] "No, I'm serious. This is what I'm going to do." [...] And {{everybody}} was like, [...] "Yeah right." [...] Even when I told everyone I was moving to LA to do music and had a going away party, only one person showed up, because no one believed that I was really going away. They were like, [...] "You'll be back." [...] So {{it was kind of}} just like my revenge, and just a statement, like throwing it back in their face.|$|E
500|$|... "Friday" [...] co-writer Patrice Wilson, {{a worker}} at Ark Music Factory, {{explained}} that he wrote the lyrics [...] "on a Thursday night going into a Friday. I was writing different songs all night and was like, 'Wow, I've been up {{a long time and}} it's Friday.' And <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>like,</b> wow, it is Friday!" ...|$|E
500|$|Because the CW is a fashion-orientated network, {{there were}} times Nikita had to be dressed {{in a certain way}} to get her noticed by her targets. Q liked the idea, {{but at the same time}} wanted Nikita's dress sense to be [...] "toned down a bit" [...] because she is an assassin. In one scene in {{particular}} Q had to wear a red bikini in the pilot, which [...] "mortified" [...] her. She added [...] "that red bikini was the bane of my existence. You're not going to see me in a bikini again, that's for sure. [...] <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>like,</b> 'Danny, can you put me in a one-piece?,' and he gave me that red bikini. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>like,</b> 'That's not a one-piece. That's a two-piece with a string.'" [...] However, Q did not have to cover her tattoos like she had to in the films, as it was in keeping with who the character is; a hardcore, street kid.|$|E
