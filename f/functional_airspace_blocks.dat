Since future 4 D trajectory management demands an efficient consideration of operational (e. g. temporally restricted areas), ecological (e. g. contrail prevention) and economic (e. g. <b>functional</b> <b>airspace</b> <b>blocks)</b> constraints, our dynamic sectorization method contributes to the highly flexible use of current and future airspace.

40|$|The {{implementation}} of Single European Sky {{is once again}} in jeopardy The European Commission is currently developing one of the centrepieces of the Single European Sky (SES) legislation: the legal framework concerning the performance and charging scheme for air navigation services {{for the period of}} 2015 - 2019. Considering the previous under-performance of the Member States, it is unacceptable that due to their pressure the Commission’s new proposals are not only lacking ambition, but will also prevent the realisation of the high level goals for SES by a considerable margin. Single European Sky is considered as the single largest pan-European project promising tangible benefits to European mobility, competitiveness and the environment. Under the Single Sky regulation, air navigation service providers are required to improve their overall performance and efficiency while harmonising their services by creating so-called <b>Functional</b> <b>Airspace</b> <b>Blocks</b> (FABs). It is now more than a decade since the European Commission first adopted proposals for a Single European Sky. All initiatives to achieve a harmonised and efficient European airspace have so far failed to deliver.

The problem of the European airspace fragmentation should be solved by the comprehensive dynamic harmonization programs, which can contribute to effective increase of airspace capacity and increase of air transport efficiency. The main objective of the development strategy refers {{to the implementation of}} reformation processes of the European air traffic management system through functional ATM 1 regionalization. Encouraged by the Single European Sky project, and through airspace de-fragmentation, numerous projects have been initiated by Eurocontrol in cooperation with the European Commission. One of them is establishing of the <b>Functional</b> <b>Airspace</b> <b>Block</b> in South Eastern Europe. The implementation of regulatory, institutional and legal framework of the Single European Sky FAB 2 would ensure the expansion of the European air traffic market to South Eastern Europe, counting over 500 million potential users [2].

Presented at the VOR Symposium on Lifelong Learning (in Dutch: Onderzoek, onderwijs en beleid voor een leven lang leren). Nyenrode University, Breukelen, The Netherlands. Several European Air Traffic Navigation Services (ATNS) {{are involved}} in developing future Air Traffic Management (ATM) scenarios, for instance, {{in the context of}} the programs Single European Sky ATM Research (SESAR) and <b>Functional</b> <b>Airspace</b> <b>Blocks</b> (FAB). The emphasis is on technological and operational innovations that could be achieved in the long term (2012 - 2020). New technologies (used to complement and substitute Air Traffic Control-ATC tasks), new operational concepts (to reduce complexity and enhance performance), and collaborative decision making in the aviation chain (to achieve better coordination and overall effectiveness) will have their impacts on the future work and competences of air traffic controllers. However, this impact is not direct but will be mediated by the structure of the ATM organization. The desired competences will have to be established through a thorough human factors perspective in ATM-design, selection and training and conversion training for operational personnel. The effectiveness of any future ATM system will depend on successful selection and training of competences and competences may change as a result of changes in the ATM system. Projects 2 a, 2 b, 2 c and 2 d focus on: 1) developing new training and selection models to sustain expertise development and excellence in the rapidly changing, technologically rich ATM setting for both ab-initio training for new air traffic controllers and conversion training for existing controllers 2) developing tools and instruments for selection and training design for lifelong learning based on those models 3) implementing and testing the tools and instruments in the field The integration and broad application of these concepts, tools and instruments is the main focus of the current project. With regard to the transfer of findings to other highly advanced technological domains, two studies will be conducted. The first study will focus on the theoretical foundation of designing flexible training systems and the way self-directed learning can be integrated in such systems. Furthermore, depending on the educational setting (yet to be determined) the theoretical guidelines will lead to a blueprint for a redesigned training program. In consultation with training directors aspects of the training program will be redesigned in order to support self-directed learning. In the second study, effects of the new system on task performance and on self-directed learning skills will be measured. In addition, the effects of the redesigned training program on adaptivily, flexibility and cost effectiveness will be determined.

40|$|The European {{air traffic}} {{management}} (ATM) systems handles approximately 26, 000 flights daily. Forecasts indicate that the European air traffic levels going to be double by 2020. In addition, European ATM costs an additional 2 - 3 billion every year, compared to other similar systems in the world. 1 Taking into account this scenario, European ATM systems {{have to look for}} solutions for accommodates the increasing air traffic flows in the future airspaces, whilst cutting costs and improving its performance. One of these solutions came with the initiative of organizing airspace into functional blocks, according to traffic flows rather than to national borders. Such a project was not possible without common rules and procedures at European level. 1 The establishment of <b>Functional</b> <b>Airspace</b> <b>blocks</b> (FAB) shall enable optimum use of airspace taking into account air traffic flows. In the same way, FABs initiatives contain a new philosophy for design the airspace, the new airspace structures include application of Flexible Use of Airspace (FUA) concept, Free Route Airspace (FRA) blocks, night direct routes implementation, etc. Additionally, FAB blocks look for cooperation or fusion between Air Navigation Services providers (ANPs), all this with the goal of reduce air navigation services costs for users. Particularly, Free Route Airspace concept offers enormous benefits to airspace users, because permits to select the user-preferred trajectories with the optimal flight profile, enabling flights to operate outside a pre-defined route structure, resulting in shortest routes and big distances saving for airlines. Furthermore, free route blocks will significantly impact in ATC systems, changing the way for establish aircraft separation in these new airspace structures. For all these reasons, this thesis will study the functionality of the future Southwest Functional Airspace Block (SW FAB), specially the implementation of the Free Route Airspace concept, focused in the long term phase (2020) that includes Santiago-Asturias, Lisbon, Santa Maria Oceanic and Canarias airspaces in one free route airspace block. 2 Objectives 1. -Evaluate the Free Route Airspace block in the future Southwest Functional Airspace Block in terms of flight efficiency (fuel,CO 2,NM), ATC workload****. 2. -Study the interaction between Free Route Airspace and conventional airspace divided in sectors (flying with RNAV). 3. -Explore the future systems and procedures for traffic separation in Free route airspace. Methodology As was explained before, this thesis pretend to make an analysis of the free route airspace in the future SW FAB, for achieves this goal it will be necessary, firstly to explain the main concepts and background of: Flexible Use of Airspace (FUA), Functional Airspace Block (FAB) and Free Route Airspace (FRA), and others concepts. In the same way, {{it will be necessary to}} review the phases of the future SW (Spain-Portugal) FAB main plan; all concepts will help to settle the base for the future analysis in the thesis. Secondly, this thesis will propose and simulate the future Free route airspace in the SW FAB. The simulation pretends to evaluate the advantages and possible problems of this new way of flight. Thirdly, this project will include some interviews from ATC professionals; these interviews pretend to see how will impact the FRA (Free route airspace) in the future, additionally those interviews can provide different points of view and needs in the ATM (Air traffic management) system.
