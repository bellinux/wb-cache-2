40|$|Two policy instruments, input {{taxes and}} regulations, {{can be used}} to deal with nitrate pollution. However, in {{practice}} command and control (CAC) measures such as input regulations and management practices, as outlined in Action Programmes under the EU Nitrates Directive (Council Directive of 12 December 1991 concerning the protection of waters against pollution caused by nitrates from agricultural sources (91 / 676 /EEC), rather than economic instruments, are commonly used to deal with nitrate pollution from agricultural sources. Action Programmes are meant to ensure that the applications of nitrogen to farmland are within limits calculated to avoid a level of nitrate emissions to water supplies that would put them above the concentration limit of 50 mg/litre specified in the Directive. The premise of the Action Programmes is that farmers should take all reasonable steps to prevent or minimise the application to land of fertilisers in excess of crop requirements. To this end the Irish Action Programme specifies that the amount of livestock manure applied in any year to land on a holding, together with that deposited on land by livestock, cannot exceed an amount containing 170 kg nitrogen per hectare (ha) and also sets limits on the application <b>of</b> <b>inorganic</b> (manufactured) nitrogen.

In this study, sewage sludge derived carbon (SC) was employed as support for iron-oxide-containing catalyst (FeSC). The catalysts were characterized <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>inorganic</b> elemental composition, XRD, SEM and TGA-FTIR. The catalytic activity of the catalyst was evaluated from the discoloration and mineralization of acid orange II (AOII) {{in the presence of}} H 2 O 2 and visible light. RESULTS The FeSC catalyst pyrolyzed at 800 (o) C for 2 h displayed the highest catalytic activity. Almost complete discoloration and 67 % mineralization of 100 mg L- 1 AOII were achieved after 30 min adsorption and 60 min oxidation under visible light irradiation, using 1. 5 g L- 1 catalyst, 15. 0 mmol L- 1 H 2 O 2 and initial pH 4. 0. The prepared FeSC also exhibited very limited iron leaching (0. 56 mg L- 1 after 90 min reaction) and high stability since the activity remained constant over ten consecutive runs.

40|$|Abstract [...] Equilibrium {{dialysis}} and {{ion exchange}} methods, {{as well as}} computer calculations (GEOCHEM), were applied for speciation of dissolved cadmium (Cd) in test solutions and leachate samples. The leachate samples originated from soil, compost, landfill waste and industrial waste. The ion exchange (IE) method separates dissolved Cd into free divalent Cd (Cd 2 +) and complexed Cd and furthermore separates the latter into the operationally defined forms: labile, slowly labile and stable complexes. The dialysis (ED) method determines high molecular weight Cd complexes (above 1000 mol. wt). For both methods the reproducibility was good. By combining {{the results of the}} GEOCHEM calculations <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> the <b>inorganic</b> omplexes, and the IE results, the fractions of free and inorganically complexed Cd were estimated.

The influence of the antistatic additive on the radical photopolymerization reaction of the acrylic resin was evaluated by real time FTIR, keeping the inorganic precursor content constant at 20 phr and increasing the trialkoxy-silyl ammonium salt in the range between 5 and 15 phr. When the samples were cured under nitrogen atmosphere, a complete conversion of acrylic double bonds was achieved after 90 s of irradiation both for the acrylic resin and the formulations containing the ammonium salt. The scratch behavior of coatings was investigated by carrying out of progressive load scratch test.

The model used has been successfully applied in the area in the past and extensively presented.

The importance of the microbial loop is highlighted by the carbon fluxes where almost 50 % of carbon is channelled within it. The impact of dissolved organic matter (DOM) (in the inflowing to the Aegean Sea, BSW) appears to be stronger than the impact of dissolved inorganic nutrients, showing a more extended effect over the N Aegean. Bacterial production and biomass is more strongly affected in the simulations by modified DOM, unlike phytoplankton biomass and production, which are more dependent on the inflowing nutrients and particularly phosphorus (inorganic and dissolved organic). In the phytoplankton composition, the dinoflagellates appear to be mostly affected, being favoured by higher nutrient availability at the expense of all other groups, particularly picoplankton, indicating a shift to a more classical food chain...|$|E

Recent evidence suggests that their competition is significantly affected by climatic factors under ongoing change, modifying especially the conditions for cold-water, spring bloom communities in temperate and Arctic regions. We investigated the effects of phytoplankton community composition on spring bloom carbon flows and nutrient stoichiometry in multiyear mesocosm experiments. Comparison of differing communities showed that community structure significantly affected C accumulation parameters, with highest particulate organic carbon (POC) buildup and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) release in diatom-dominated communities. <b>In</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>inorganic</b> nutrient drawdown and bloom accumulation phase, the dominating groups behaved as functional surrogates.

Diatom-dominated communities sequestered carbon up to 3. 6 -fold higher than the expectation based on the Redfield ratio, and 2 -fold higher compared to dinoflagellate dominance. To our knowledge, {{this is the first}} experimental report of consequences of climatically driven shifts in phytoplankton dominance patterns for carbon sequestration and related biogeochemical cycles in coastal seas. Our results also highlight the need for remote sensing technologies with taxonomical resolution, as the C : Chl a ratio was strongly dependent on community composition and bloom stage.

40|$|The {{ability of}} a human {{observer}} to identify an explosive device concealed in complex arrangements of objects routinely encountered in the 2 D x-ray screening of passenger baggage at airports is often problematic. Standard dual-energy x-ray techniques enable colour encoding of the resultant images <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> organic, <b>inorganic</b> and metal substances. This transmission imaging technique produces colour information computed from a high-energy x-ray signal and a low energy x-ray signal (80 keV<E< 140 keV). The broad nature of this materials discrimination places plastic explosive in the same organic window as other innocuous organic items. Also, images of a threat substance which has been masked by other materials will result in colour encoding which {{is proportional to the}} effective atomic number of the threat material and the masking material. The work presented in this thesis enables the effective atomic number of the target material within a specified window (6. 6 <= Z sub e sub f sub f <= 13) to be automatically discriminated from many layers of overlapping substances. This is achieved by applying a basis materials subtraction technique to the data provided by a wavelet image segmentation algorithm. This imaging technique is reliant upon the image data for the masking substances to be discriminated independently of the target material. Further work investigated the extraction of depth data from stereoscopic images to estimate the mass density of the target material. A binocular stereoscopic dual-energy x-ray machine previously developed by the Vision Systems Group at The Nottingham Trent University in collaboration with The Home Office Science and Technology Group provided the image data for the empirical investigation.

This study analyzed water, nitrogen, and phosphorus inputs and outputs to the Shiawassee Flats and evaluated the current role that the connected wetlands and floodplain play in water and nutrients to the Saginaw River and the downstream Bay. Discharge measurements and water samples were taken at all of the major inputs to, and output from, the Flats, throughout {{the spring and summer of}} 2012 - 2013, and chemical analyses were conducted for nitrogen and phosphorus. When hydrologic storage was occurring, the output flow was reduced by over 20 %; conversely, when combined upstream inputs were very low, at times 80 % of the output flow was wetland water.

All laboratorial work {{was carried out in}} compliance with the internal quality criteria established by the laboratory. Lead content was below the LOQ in all analysed samples. Cadmium was found above the LOQ only in one location; however it was present in all 3 sample types. Regarding the remaining elements bran was the type of sample with the highest levels. Arsenic content varied between 597 - 1527 µg/kg for bran, 266 - 593 µg/kg for whole grain, and 188 - 480 µg/kg for white rice. Speciation data showed that the arsenic species present were As (III), As (V) and DMA. In rice bran the inorganic species were predominant while in whole grain and white rice DMA was the most abundant species. This work demonstrates that, due to the toxicity of the species present, arsenic speciation studies are fundamental for characterize rice in terms of hazard identification. The content of all elements and species under study is in agreement with current legislation or available recommendations.

GHGs emission in Tanzania is reported mainly to be from land use change and forestry by 87. 33 %, energy and agriculture ranking second and third by contribution 6. 39 % and 5. 68 % respectively. This information gives an impression that despite less emission of GHGs in agriculture compared to other sectors, special attention needs to be paid on soil and livestock {{in order to reduce}} the emission from agriculture. The expected growth in agricultural sector may trigger acceleration of GHGs emission which might surpass other sectors, currently the conversion of natural forests and woodlands into agricultural fields is at alarming rate, the current rate of deforestation that have been reported by the government stands at 400, 000 ha/year, agricultural sector is said to be the key contributor of deforestation. The REDD+ readiness phase is the most significant mitigation program, the readiness phase has been implemented through the UN-REDD and the NICFI programme with a total budget of over 100 mil USD. The readiness phase has laid down a foundation to most ground work to support accounting on GHGs emission. Moreover, the readiness phase gave set up of the MRV system together with a road map for RL/REL. currently the ability of the nation to collect emission data (NFI) is much enhanced than before. Institutional arrangement and coordination for Carbon monitoring is well underway through the NCMC.

40|$|Currently in South Africa {{there is}} no {{acceptable}} standard method for testing coals for abrasion. Abrasion is the tendency of coals to wear away machinery. The technique referred to as YGP (Yancey, Geer and Price), proposed and accepted in 1951, is most commonly used to test for abrasion. Over the years {{there have been some}} modifications to this method by both mining houses and coal users (such as Eskom) which have resulted in inconsistent and conflicting results. To this end, this study serves {{as part of a larger}} project that will aim at devising a standard method acceptable for testing coals for abrasion in South Africa. The underlying principle behind this research was to determine the main characteristics in South African run of mine (ROM) coals that may cause abrasion. This research work specifically seeks to: (1) determine if the Abrasion Index (AI) and Hardgrove Grindability Index (HGI), empirical correlations, developed by Scieszka (1985), can be verified using experimental results; (2) determine if excluded minerals and included minerals are equally abrasive; (3) establish the type of abrasive wear that occurred during coal grinding. Five ROM coals from the Witbank Coalfields were analysed. An abrasion index tester pot and Hardgrove machine were used to determine the grinding properties of the coal samples. XRD (Rietveld method), XRF, Petrography and SEM-EDS were used to characterise the coals samples <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> their <b>inorganic</b> and organic components.

40|$|Three atomic {{spectrometry}} techniques, namely sector field {{inductively coupled plasma}} mass spectroscopy, graphite furnace {{atomic absorption}} spectrometry and hydride generation atomic fluorescence spectroscopy (ICP-SMS, GF-AAS and HG-AFS, respectively), housed at separate independent laboratories, were used to analyse water and sediment samples collected from the Huon River Estuary, SE Tasmania (Australia) in the Austral spring 1998. A dithiocarbamate-chelation/back-extraction technique was used to separate and preconcentrate Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb from eight collected water samples prior to analysis by ICP-SMS and GF-AAS. A number of other elements in the waters were analysed directly (Mn, Fe and Zn by GF-AAS; As by HG-AFS), or following sample dilution (1 + 19; V, Mn, Fe, As, Mo, Ba and U by ICP-SMS). Where possible, previously corroborated GF-AAS and HG-AFS techniques were used to verify obtained ICP-SMS results. From the analysis of four reference waters (SLEW- 1 and - 2, SLRS- 3 and NASS- 5), good agreement, to within +/- 10 - 20 %, was typically found between certified (or information only values) and measured results (irrespective of analytical technique). Exceptions included Zn (and sometimes Fe) {{that could not be}} quantified by ICP-SMS due to elevated blank signals, and As which was found to lie below ICP-SMS detection limits. For Huon Estuary water samples, inter-method agreement was within +/- 10 - 20 % (for those elements amenable to analysis by more than one technique). Nitric acid extracts of two certified reference materials (Buffalo River Sediment and BCSS- 1) and six Huon Estuary sediments were analysed by ICP-SMS (for Al, Sc, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Cd and Pb) and HG-AFS (for As). Results from the certified reference materials indicated extraction efficiencies of 60 - 70 % (for most elements). A close correlation between ICP-SMS and HG-AFS was obtained for leachable As in the sediments. <b>In</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> potential <b>inorganic</b> contaminants, the Huon Estuary was found to be a relatively 'clean' water system.

40|$|Providing {{access to}} safe {{drinking}} water becomes increasingly difficult on a worldwide level. Various regions of the Mexican Highlands have issues of groundwater contamination <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>inorganic</b> (e. g. arsenic or fluoride) or bacteriological parameters, which are exceeding the es- tablished limits in the Norma Oficial Mexicana (Official Mexican Standard) (NOM) for drinking water. One of the affected areas is the Altiplano region in the federal state of San Luis Potosí. Most of the rural communities in the region {{do not have access}} to (adequate) technology for groundwater purification and thus their inhabitants are exposed to the elevated levels of con- tamination which are potentially the cause for diseases, such as the fluorosis. Due to the facts of marginalization and poverty it is vital to investigate towards decentralized and economical technologies which can be applied on a small-scale level. A low-cost and “low-tech” approach is necessary in order to provide the people with a technology which they can construct, oper- ate and maintain themselves. A promising approach is the technology of solar distillation for drinking water supply on domestic level, making use of the high regional potential of solar en- ergy. It is proven that this technology is capable of removing nearly any type of contaminants (inorganic and bacterial) from the raw water. The simplest and most durable form of imple- mentation is the passive shallow-basin, single-slope solar still. The mayor drawback consists in its low daily output of drinking water (about two to five liters per square meter of insolated area). In the scope of the thesis, so-called passive energy augmentation measures are applied to the aforementioned design, in order to raise the distillate output to an adequate level for the drinking water supply of a small family of four members with a demand of approximately eight liters per day (considering the amount of pure ingestion). A prototype unit of the passive solar still is built and its parameters of distillate output, energy efficiency and construction costs are determined, considering two different configurations. An additional analysis of the distillate quality is made. The first configuration of the prototype is mainly characterized by a low water level in the evaporation basin and raw water pre-heating, whereas the second configuration adds reflective side- and rear wall coating inside the distillation chamber. Furthermore, a prototype of an active solar still is designed, incorporating an additional energy source (solar air collector) for higher process temperatures and therefore augmentation of the daily distillate yield. The emphasis in construction was put on the use of local, economical and recycled materials as far as possible, in order to lower the costs, attain a high reproducibility and to facilitate the possi- bility of autonomous self-construction in rural areas [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The {{combination}} of MBR membrane technology with reverse osmosis (RO) for wastewater treatment {{has been proven}} to provide a very high quality effluent. The MBR efficiently removes nutrients (C, N & P) from the influent wastewater together with suspended solids and colloids making it suitable to feed it to a RO membrane which removes most of {{the remainder of the}} dissolved compounds, to produce very high quality effluent which is of drinking water quality. The main advantages of the wastewater treatment systems based on MBR technology are the quality of output water and the need of little installation space, in comparison with conventional activated sludge (CAS) systems. However, fouling particularly of the RO membrane, remains a problem when using the RO membrane as a final stage in a wastewater reclamation plant. Membranes require frequent chemical cleaning processes to control the build-up of organic, inorganic and biological fouling on the membrane surface. As the membrane gets fouled, increasing amounts of energy are required to produce the same amount of product water. Therefore it is essential to understand what is causing the fouling and what control measures must be applied to achieve long-term sustainable operation. The objective of this project is to understand how the composition of the RO influent water (MBR effluent) <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>inorganic</b> contaminants, temperature, pH and the system recovery affects membrane fouling. To achieve this objective, the feedwater of an MBR-RO pilot plant located at Quart was studied to obtain a characterisation of RO feedwater quality. The results of a membrane autopsy were used to see what types of membrane fouling are observed during operation. An RO membrane simulation model was then used to understand through multiple simulations how the feed water quality, temperature, pH and system recovery affect membrane fouling, the product water quality and the energy consumption. The results are then used to propose strategies to control membrane fouling and optimize process operation in terms of energy use and permeate quality. The results from the autopsy and those from the modelling studies confirm that the main component of inorganic fouling is Calcium Carbonate (CaCO 3) particularly on the concentrate side of the membrane (the end of the membrane). On the feed side of the membrane, organic fouling was predominant. The modelling studies showed that the addition of acid to control the pH could control the CaCO 3 precipitation. Furthermore, we have shown that the optimal process recovery to run the RO membrane at the lowest energy consumption for different feedwater temperatures between 24 and 27 ºC is 70 - 75 %. The final part of the project utilized online process data to monitor membrane fouling during pilot plant operation and normalize process data in terms of permeate flux and salt rejectio...|$|E
40|$|Water {{quality and}} water supply are {{essential}} for organic greenhouse grown crops to prevent soil contaminationby undesirable chemicals and microorganisms, while providing a sufficient amount of water for plant growth. The absence of natural precipitation combined with higher evapotranspiration due to higher temperatureand longer cropping period requires an adequate supply of water. Water quality is commonly defined by itschemical, physical, and biological attributes. It is {{closely linked to the}} soil/rock native components, surroundingenvironment and land use. The runoff from urban, industrial, farming, mining, and forestry activities alsosignificantly affects the quality of water available for greenhouse horticulture. High water quality is particularlyimportant in organic greenhouse production in order to prevent soil salinization and ensure optimal soil biologicalactivity. Indeed, unbalanced organic fertilizer inputs may contribute to soil salinity, while soil microbial activitiesresponsible for nutrient mineralization, soil suppressiveness and plant health, are affected by soil pH, ions, andcontaminants. Poor water quality can also result in drip and micro irrigation clogging, plant toxicity, and productcontamination by human pathogen or illicit compounds. To achieve sustainable water management, good knowledge of crops' water requirements is essential as isknowledge of the soil water characteristics that determine the irrigation scheduling. Moreover, the adequacyof the irrigation distribution system determines the accuracy of the water supplied. Crop water needs areoften determined on the basis of daily evapotranspiration and solar radiation levels. Different irrigation controltools such as soil moisture sensors, plant sensors, lysimeters and models contribute to the optimization of theirrigation management of organic greenhouse crops. In addition to determining crop productivity, water qualityand water management also impact on product quality. In this booklet we first illustrate the water flows through different organic greenhouse growing systems. Westate the importance of water quality for organic greenhouse horticulture and give some guidelines regardingthe required water quality attributes <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>inorganic,</b> organic and microbial loads as well as hazardousmicroorganisms and compounds. We also define advantages and disadvantages of different water resourcesand describe the important drivers for crop and soil water demand. We then report the effects of salinity on soilmineralisation and crop development in organic greenhouse production systems. The main irrigation technologyused for organic greenhouse horticulture is described along with the most important management aspects forirrigation. Because quality attributes of greenhouse products drive consumer demand for organic products, wedefine the impact of water quality and irrigation management on product quality. Organic farming should usecultural practices that maintain land resources and ecological balance, in addition to promoting biodiversity,biological cycles, and soil biological activity. We therefore state the importance of water resources and their usefor organic greenhouse system sustainability. We then conclude by summarizing main aspects of water qualityand irrigation management, and by identifying knowledge gaps. Better prediction of the temporal dynamics of plant and soil microbial water needs in relation to sustainableproductivity and high water use efficiency is needed for greenhouse horticultural crops. It is also importantin terms of reduced attractiveness to pests and susceptibility to diseases. A reduction in spatial and temporalcrop heterogeneity should result from improved growing systems and better water and crop management. Nevertheless, advances in irrigation management for conventional greenhouse crops and development of newcontrol tools can be adapted for use in organic greenhouse horticulture. Similarly, some water treatmentsof drained or collected waters such as thermal, UV, ozone and biological treatments can be used by growersaccording to their organic regulation. Consequently, research is needed in different areas of organic greenhousehorticulture: (i) water quality in terms of relevant thresholds for contaminants and potential risks related toplant and human pathogens; (ii) efficient measures to prevent clogging of the irrigation systems; (iii) alternativewater treatments and system cleaning products; (iv) better knowledge and guidelines for non-leaching systems;(v) affordable and highly efficient control tools to assist growers; and (vi) knowledge about the environmentalimpact of different water management and water sources used for organic greenhouse horticulture to helpgrowers fulfilling the organic principles and improve their sustainability...|$|E
40|$|Reclamation of {{municipal}} wastewater {{has become an}} increasingly attractive alternative to supplement the limited fresh water supply all over the world. For this purpose, reverse osmosis (RO) based wastewater reclamation processes are being increasingly used to produce high quality recycled water that is suitable {{for a wide range}} of beneficial uses. However, the RO treatment processes generate the waste streams known as RO concentrate (ROC) which contain almost all contaminants present in the RO influent (usually the biologically treated secondary effluent) at elevated concentrations (4 - 6 times). As these contaminants include many harmful micropollutants and nutrient in addition to the organics recalcitrant to biological treatment, the ROC can pose significant risks to environment and human health if discharged to receiving water environments without proper treatment. The organics present in the ROC are refractory to further biodegradation because these organics are originated from the secondary effluent that has been subjected to extensive secondary treatment. Biological treatment such as biological activated carbon (BAC) is considered as a potentially cost-effective and environmentally benign option for removing organic matter and nutrients from the ROC via adsorption and biodegradation. Some preliminary studies have investigated the potential of BAC treatment in removing organic matter only from the relatively low salinity ROC (TDS &lt; 5 g/L). However, there is generally a lack of study on removing both organic matter and nutrients from different types of ROC (e. g., with high salinity, containing industrial process wastewater etc.), and the microbial communities contributing to the ROC remediation. Therefore, effectiveness of BAC was investigated for organic matter and nutrient removal from different types of ROC using different pre-treatment options in this study. The different types of ROC used in this study vary greatly in salinity levels, ionic concentrations, initial organic and nutrient concentrations. The UV/H 2 O 2 was used as pre-treatment of ROC as it improves its biodegradability by degrading recalcitrant organic compounds via oxidation by hydroxyl radicals and making the ROC more amenable for biodegradation by microorganisms in the BAC system. The combined UV/H 2 O 2 -BAC treatment of a ROC, which had extremely high salinity (TDS ~ 16 g/L and initial DOC ~ 36 mg/L) led to effective reductions in organic matter (57 % DOC removal) and nitrogen species at the empty bed contact time of 60 minutes. This was attributed mainly to the generation of simpler organic molecules during the oxidative treatment, which were readily removed by the microorganisms embedded in the BAC column. High total nitrogen removal (60 %) was achieved with complete nitrification and partial denitrification taking place in the BAC system without supplementing additional carbon source or aeration. However, total phosphorus removal was very low (15 %) due to the high salinity of the ROC (&gt; 5 g/L), at which plasmolysis of phosphorus removing bacteria would occur. The treated ROC had similar characteristics to the secondary effluent, which was used as the influent for the reclamation process, <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> DOC, COD and TN. Moreover, the treated ROC was markedly lower in colour and UVA 254 compared with the RO influent, confirming that the BAC process could be acclimated to treat the very high salinity municipal wastewater ROC. The BAC treatment system was found to be robust as the organic matter removal was not greatly affected by varied ROC salinity (TDS 7 - 16 g/L). However, total nitrogen removal was higher for the ROC at high salinity (TDS 16 g/L) compared with low (7 g/L) and medium (10 g/L) salinity ROC as a result of the considerably higher denitrification at high salinity (39 % cf. 23 % and 27 % at low and medium salinity, respectively). This was attributed to prevalence of diversified halotolerant bacteria which were mostly responsible for denitrification in the BAC treatment system. The major bacterial communities identified in the BAC treatment system were Bacillus sp., Pseudomonas sp. and Rhodococcus sp., as revealed by PCR-DGGE and sequencing, which were able to remove organic matter and the nitrogen species. The combined UV/H 2 O 2 -BAC treatment of another type of ROC (TDS 4. 5 g/L and initial DOC ~ 52 mg/L) which was derived from a municipal wastewater containing a significant proportion of petrochemical wastes led to overall 58 % DOC removal. The combined treatment of this ROC led to higher phosphorus removal (60 %) and low (15 %) total nitrogen removal, implying that nutrient removal could be greatly dependent on salinity level of ROC and the groups of bacteria present in the BAC system. The presence of Micrococcus sp. Ralstonia sp., Agrobacterium sp., Sphingopyxis sp. and Pseudomonas sp, which were closely related to phosphorus accumulating organisms (PAOs) in BAC treatment system, were considered to be responsible for phosphorus removal. Furthermore, the BAC treatment system effectively removed the total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) from the ROC, thus indicating its good potential for removing petrochemical compounds of interest. For the convenience of comparison, aforementioned two types of ROC were denoted as ROC A (TDS 16 g/L and initial DOC 36 mg/L) and ROC B (TDS 4. 5 g/L and initial DOC 52 mg/L). These two ROC types were different <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>inorganics</b> (as indicated by the TDS concentration) and organics as indicated by DOC concentration and Liquid Chromatography-Organic Carbon Detection (LC-OCD) analysis. The UV/H 2 O 2 -BAC treatment of two types of ROC led to comparable DOC reduction (58 %) due to considerable reduction of high molecular weight compounds (HA-like) and generating low molecular weight compounds during oxidation, which were more amenable to biodegradation in the BAC treatment. The COD removal was higher (59 %) for the ROC B compared with ROC A. It was found that nitrification was consistently higher as more than 90 % ammonium nitrogen removal was achieved for both ROC regardless <b>of</b> different <b>inorganic</b> and organic compositions of both ROC. Total nitrogen and phosphorus removals were mainly dependent on the existence of different bacterial communities in the two BAC systems treating different ROC streams. The impact of other pre-treatments including coagulation and sequential coagulation-UV/H 2 O 2 were also evaluated for their capabilities in organic matter and nutrient removal from the aforementioned two types of ROC (ROC A and ROC B). Coagulation pre-treatment achieved &gt; 90 % phosphorus removal regardless of the type of the ROC. For the coagulation-BAC treatment, organic matter removal was greater for the ROC A compared with ROC B. This was attributed to the significant removal of higher molecular weight organic compounds due to the formation of more rigid flocs in the higher salinity water environment, which led to better settleability of organic matter. The sequential coagulation-UV/H 2 O 2 -BAC treatment on the two types of ROC markedly improved the overall organic matter removal, with a comparable reduction in DOC (62 - 67 %) due to reduced organic load by individual pre-treatment and better oxidation of the remaining organics in coagulated ROC, and consequently more effective biodegradation occurred in the BAC treatment. Ammonium nitrogen removal (90 %) was consistently higher for the two types of ROC when using coagulation-BAC and sequential coagulation-UV/H 2 O 2 -BAC combinations. This study demonstrated that the BAC based processes are effective and resilient in removing organic matter and nutrients from the municipal wastewater ROC of significantly different natures and water quality characteristics. Since the BAC treatment could lead to significant reductions in chemical consumption (such as H 2 O 2 and coagulant) and energy cost (such as UV light), it is potentially a feasible option for reducing the environmental and health risks associated with the ROC on disposal or reuse. However, the technological feasibility of the processes should be assessed further with larger scale trials, and more detailed cost analyses should be conducted to justify their full-scale applications...|$|R
