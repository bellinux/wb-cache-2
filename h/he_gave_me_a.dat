500|$|After this, Bond's next {{role was}} Phœbe Meryll in The Yeomen of the Guard (1888–89). [...] Of this role, Bond wrote, [...] "My {{share in the}} most {{beautiful}} of all the Gilbert and Sullivan operas was delightfully easy and natural. [...] When Gilbert {{gave it to me}} at the first reading he said, 'Here you are, Jessie, you needn't act this, it's you.'" [...] Gilbert was even more nervous than usual on the first night of Yeomen and came backstage to give his best wishes to the cast. [...] Bond wrote, [...] "I am afraid he made himself a perfect nuisance behind the scenes, and did his best, poor fellow, to upset us all. These first nights were very hard on me... and nearly always my understudy was called upon to officiate on the second night of a play, while I lay exhausted in my bed. [...] , the curtain rises on Phœbe alone at her spinning wheel, and Gilbert kept fussing about... until I was almost as demented as he was. [...] At last I turned on him savagely. [...] 'For Heaven's sake, Mr. Gilbert, go away and leave me alone, or I shan't be able to sing a note!' <b>He</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> final frenzied hug, and vanished." ...|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} of the Maharishi's death in 2008, more than 5 million people had learned Transcendental Meditation, and his {{worldwide}} movement was valued in the billions of dollars. The ashram, built on land belonging to the Rajaji National Park, was reclaimed by the government in the mid-1990s after the lease expired in 1981, and fell into disrepair. After the Maharishi died, McCartney said: [...] "my memories of him will only be joyful ones. He was a great man who worked tirelessly {{for the people of the}} world and the cause of unity". Starr said in 2008, [...] "I feel so blessed I met the Maharishi– <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> mantra that no one can take away, and I still use it". In 2009, McCartney, Starr, Donovan, and Horn reunited at a concert held at New York's Radio City Music Hall to benefit the David Lynch Foundation, which funds the teaching of Transcendental Meditation in schools. A 2008 article in Rolling Stone magazine reported Yoko Ono as saying: [...] "John would have been the first one now, if he had been here, to recognize and acknowledge what Maharishi has done for the world and appreciate it". Author Gary Tillery wrote in 2010 that Lennon [...] "benefited from the experience" [...] and [...] "for the rest of his life he often turned to meditation to restore himself and improve his creativity." ...|$|E

He sent me a letter. He was honored that we did it. I felt confident we could settle anything that came up. You can usually settle that shit. It's part of the budget, man. But John Woo didn't want nothing, never no money for that. We actually became friends.

2500|$|Purim's mother, Rachel Vaisberg, is Brazilian-Jewish. Her father, Naum Purim (1912—1992), was a Romanian Jewish {{immigrant}} from Moghilău, then {{part of the}} Russian Empire. Her sister Yana Purim (Bernstein) is also a jazz singer. Purim is also {{the name of the}} annual Jewish festival commemorating the deliverance of the Jews from a plot to exterminate them, as recorded in the biblical Book of Esther. Hence Purim presumably has Jewish ancestry through her father. She also adheres to the Bahá'í Faith {{thanks in large part to}} Dizzy Gillespie. Gillespie's death in 1993 prompted Purim in 2002 to comment on his influence on her – [...] "…I loved him also because <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> lot of insight and spirituality, he even gave me his praying book…" ...|$|E

2500|$|Paul and Clara adopted Jobs's sister Patricia in 1957 and {{the family}} moved to Mountain View, California in 1961. It was during this time that Paul built a {{workbench}} in his garage for his son in order to [...] "pass along his love of mechanics." [...] Jobs, meanwhile, admired his father's craftsmanship [...] "because he knew how to build anything. If we needed a cabinet, he would build it. When he built our fence, <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> hammer so I could work with him ... I wasn't that into fixing cars ... but I was eager to hang out with my dad." [...] By the time he was ten, Jobs was deeply involved in electronics and befriended many of the engineers who lived in the neighborhood. He had difficulty making friends with children his own age, however, and was seen by his classmates as a [...] "loner." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "It {{must have}} been when I was about 19 or 20 and went out {{training}} with a friend on the Belgian borders. As we spun along, out of nowhere this skinny blond kid was on our back wheel. He looked about 14. He was still there 15 minutes later, so we picked up speed. He just sat there, so we picked up the pace again. It was still no problem for him. I looked over my shoulder and <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> half-mocking, half-friendly grin. In the end, we went {{as hard as we}} could to try {{to get rid of him}} and teach the little brat a lesson, because by now he was getting a bit too cocky for our tastes. But whatever we did, he still hung on. After about an hour, we came into a village called Ploegsteert, at which point he came alongside with real arrogance and said 'OK, I'm back home now, so 'bye. By the way, I'm Frank Vandenbroucke.' Neither of us had ever met a kid like him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dean starred for the Cardinals {{as one of}} baseball's premier {{pitchers}} from 1932 to 1937, {{with four}} All-Star Games, leading the NL in wins and shutouts twice, strikeouts four times, complete games and innings pitched three times, while procuring an MVP award with two runner-up finishes. [...] He also carried a distinctive persona when off the mound. [...] Dean was a robust, zany, quasi-Yogi Berra-prototype who uttered such memorable quotes as, [...] "It ain't bragging {{if you can do}} it", [...] "Son, what kind of pitch would you like to miss?", [...] "He slud into third", [...] "I ain't what I used to be, but who the hell is?", [...] "The doctors x-rayed my head and found nothing", [...] "The good Lord was good to me. [...] <b>He</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> strong body, a good right arm, and a weak mind", and [...] "It puzzles me how they know what corners are good for filling stations. [...] Just how did they know gas and oil was under there?" [...] His uninhibited nature and willingness to become a lightning rod for criticism garnered massive popularity with teammates, fans and media alike. [...] After retiring as a player, Dean augmented even more popularity as a sportscaster and was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1953.|$|E

2500|$|Wong {{received}} {{an invitation to}} appear in Game of Death (死亡遊戲), but declined. He was scheduled to attend a screen test {{on the set of}} Enter the Dragon after Bruce Lee had finished shooting the film and was working on dubbing. Lee returned to Hong Kong from his last trip to the United States of America in late May 1973. Thus, Wong would have attended the screen test sometime in June 1973. Wong recalled, [...] "About two months before he (Bruce Lee) died <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> phone call ... After this he left Hong Kong to settle his film business. When he came back, he called me up and wanted me to participate in the making of Game of Death. He had also invited me to the studio to attend a screen test. I did not promise to act in the film, yet I still went to attend the screen test to please him." [...] In a 1986 interview, Wong said, [...] "I told him (Bruce Lee) that I didn't want to go and die in my first movie! ... I wasn't in dire financial straits at the time, so I didn't have to do the film (just) to make money." [...] The role of Lee's final opponent was thus played by basketball star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. In another interview, Wong said, [...] "It was for Game of Death, but I declined because I thought that the moves of Wing Chun style wouldn’t look good on film. I think the Wing Chun method is ugly for movies but very good and very logical for real fighting." ...|$|E
