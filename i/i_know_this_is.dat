500|$|Keith Fay of {{the folk}} metal band Cruachan has also noted the {{influence}} of sea shanties on Viking metal, although disparagingly. In an interview with British magazine Terrorizer, {{he said that there}} is [...] "no real defined 'Viking music', so all these Nordic bands use 'sea shanty' type tunes to match their music. A lot of these bands, especially the bigger ones, are called folk metal but they don't really understand what real folk music is; though <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> not true for all of them." ...|$|E
500|$|Tintinologist Phillipe Goddin {{considered}} the series to be [...] "a milestone", describing it as [...] "full of promise" [...] and containing [...] "plety [...] of humour, rich in developments". The Tintinologists Jean-Marc and Randy Lofficier commented that [...] "Everything that made Tintin what it later became was seminally present in Totor", including the artistic style, {{the pace of}} the story, the use of humour, {{and the manner in which}} it imitated motion pictures. They also commented that Totor read like [...] "an adult was retelling one of those early American western serials... to a group of children. On the one hand he is exciting the children, but on the other he is winking at the adults as if to say, [...] "you and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> not serious."" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{band members}} {{began to have}} doubts about the record's sound. [...] During this time, Cobain admitted, [...] "The first time I played it at home, I knew there was {{something}} wrong. [...] The whole first week I wasn't really interested in listening to it at all, and that usually doesn't happen. [...] I got no emotion from it, I was just numb." [...] The group concluded that the bass and lyrics were inaudible and approached Albini to remix the album. [...] The producer declined; as he recalled, [...] " [...] wanted to make a record that he could slam down on the table and say, 'Listen, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> good, and I know your concerns about it are meaningless, so go with it.' [...] And I don't think he felt he had that yet... My problem was that I feared a slippery slope." [...] The band attempted to fix its concerns with the record during the mastering process with Bob Ludwig at his studio in Portland, Maine. [...] Novoselic was pleased with the results, but Cobain still did not feel the sound was perfect.|$|E

500|$|On June 22, 2017, Swanigan {{was drafted}} {{in the first round}} (26th overall) by the Portland Trail Blazers. On July 3, 2017, Swanigan signed with the Portland Trail Blazers. On being drafted, Swanigan said: [...] "Being {{selected}} tonight in the NBA Draft is a dream come true. I have been thinking of this moment for a long time. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> only the first step in my professional career, but I am extremely excited for to begin this journey". Painter said, [...] "We are thrilled that Biggie has achieved his lifelong dream of being selected in the NBA Draft. It’s been an incredibly tough road for him to get to this point and no one deserves it more than he does". Swanigan was the first Purdue basketball player to be drafted at the sophomore level or lower.

500|$|However, {{in a more}} mixed review, Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times {{felt that}} the song [...] "seems {{as if it were}} written by a ninth-grader imagining her rebellious college sister’s lifestyle" [...] and felt that it lacked {{creativity}} within Cyrus' catalog. Writing for Rolling Stone, Jon Dolan was skeptical of Cyrus' increasingly provocative image, stating that the lyrics in the chorus would be [...] "an odd fit for any singer" [...] and opining that [...] "there's still a bit too much Disney in her voice to fill the track." [...] Naomi Zeichner of The Fader praised the song, writing, [...] "Cyrus said in her recent MTV doc (...) , that she chose it to be her album's first single: 'Not everyone {{came to me and said}} okay, you've got the first single. I had to say no, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> it and I'll go to battle if I have to, against anyone who doesn't believe in it. Now I have this freedom to do whatever I want, because people trust me.' She was right about this one. The song's straightforward party is now tied to a sordid universe of visuals- the official video and the VMA performance." [...] Common Sense Media gave the song two stars out of five saying that [...] "After listening to the weird intro to [...] "We Can't Stop" [...] you'll kind of wish the song did just stop right there." ...|$|E

And he doesn't love me. He wasn't brought up the way you were brought up and I was brought up, through love of this country." [...] In response to criticism of the remarks, Giuliani said, [...] "Some people thought it was racist—I thought that was a joke, since he was brought up by a white mother... This isn't racism. This is socialism or possibly anti-colonialism." [...] White House deputy press secretary Eric Schultz said he agreed with Giuliani [...] "that it was a horrible thing to say", but said he would leave it up to the people who heard Giuliani directly to assess if the remarks were appropriate for the event. Although he received some support for his controversial comments, Giuliani said he also received several death threats within 48 hours.|$|E

2500|$|In late 1959, Shindo's album [...] "Brass and Bamboo" [...] was {{released}} by Capitol Records. [...] The album featured 10 standards and two original compositions by Shindo, combining the sounds of traditional Japanese instruments, including koto, samisen, and bamboo flutes, with Western brass with [...] "orchestration in tempos and moods that range from ballads to swing." [...] The fanfare drums used in the recording were borrowed from the Tenrikyo Church in Los Angeles, and musicians from the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra contributed a Chinese gong acquired {{on a trip to}} Hong Kong. [...] At the time of the album's release, Shindo said: [...] "It [...] [...] [...] introduces a foreign sound to the American ear. Oriental instruments have been used for solo passages in record before, but as far as <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the first time they have ever been {{an integral part of the}} arrangements." [...] One reviewer rated it as the [...] "Album of the Month" [...] for April 1960, calling it a [...] "sparkling debut" [...] with [...] "a new, refreshing blend of music of the East and West, big band dance arrangements spiced with exotic instrumental sounds of the orient." [...] Esquire magazine in 1960 wrote: [...] "Tak mixes ancient Eastern and modern Western instruments in a steamy dance sukiyaki." [...] Another reviewer wrote that [...] "the music is neither Oriental nor jazz, but a delightful, different sound" [...] providing [...] "nothing but fun for stereo fanciers." [...] Writing for allmusic.com, Richard Pierson wrote that Shindo's [...] "skillful arrangements of big band chestnuts and Hollywood theme tunes achieved a blend that was witty, cosmopolitan, and almost immediately outmoded as the ascendancy of rock and its youth market turned American pop music into an arena of generational identity politics." ...|$|E
