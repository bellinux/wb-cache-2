25|$|On 1 September 2008, {{the party}} regained a third mandate in the parliament, as Gitte Seeberg was {{appointed}} {{secretary general of}} the Danish branch of the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). Her mandate was given to former deputy mayor of Slagelse, Villum Christensen. On 5 January 2009, founding member and party leader Naser Khader left the party, citing that he did not believe in <b>it</b> <b>any</b> <b>longer.</b> At the time, Anders Samuelsen was scheduled to take over leadership of the party later that month. The same day, Villum Christensen expressed doubt on his future in the party.|$|E
25|$|Cavaradossi tells Angelotti of {{a chamber}} {{in an ancient}} Roman well on the {{property}} where he can hide until he makes his escape. It had been used by one of Cavaradossi's ancestors when he fled Rome after stabbing a Medici. Tosca arrives to confront her lover about the fan Scarpia had shown her. Cavaradossi and Angelotti explain everything and she realizes with horror {{that she has been}} duped into leading Scarpia to them. On hearing the arrival of Scarpia and his men, Angelotti seeks refuge in the well. Scarpia demands to know where Angelotti is hidden. When Tosca and Cavardossi refuse to tell, Cavaradossi is taken off to be interrogated by the Procureur and tortured by Scarpia's assistant if he refuses to answer. Scarpia describes the torture device in great detail to Tosca, who is then made to listen to her lover's screams. Unable to bear <b>it</b> <b>any</b> <b>longer,</b> she reveals the hiding place, much to Cavaradossi's fury. Rather than be captured, Angelotti takes poison concealed in his ring. Scarpia orders his men to take Cavaradossi to the Castel Sant'Angelo for execution and orders Tosca to be brought there as well.|$|E
500|$|Having {{originally}} {{agreed to}} serve {{for a year}} Gleeson wrote to Father Bernard Rawlinson, the senior Roman Catholic chaplain, in October 1915 requesting that he be relieved of duty stating that [...] "I am sorry to be leaving the dear old Munster lads, but I really can't stand <b>it</b> <b>any</b> <b>longer.</b> I {{do not like the}} life, though I love the poor men ever so much". He became a curate at the Church of Our Lady of Lourdes in Dublin but requested permission from his Archbishop, William Walsh, to return to army service for another year. He was recommissioned in his previous rank on 15 May 1917 and would serve another two years. When the Royal Munster Fusiliers were transferred to the 48th Brigade, 16th (Irish) Division on 29 January 1918 Gleeson remained with the 1st Infantry Division.|$|E

500|$|Bobby {{explains}} {{that the man who}} attacked Sam is Jeremy Frost; he was unable to dream because his father brutally hit him {{in the head with a}} baseball bat. The target's DNA is a required ingredient for the dream-root tea, and Jeremy acquired Bobby's by offering him a beer. Dean realizes that he made the same mistake. Vulnerable to Jeremy, they both stay awake for two days while attempting to track him down. Unable to endure <b>it</b> <b>any</b> <b>longer,</b> Dean goes to sleep to face Jeremy, and Sam uses the dream root to enter his dream. The brothers encounter a dream version of Lisa Braeden (Cindy Sampson)Dean's former love interestoutside on a blanket with a picnic basket. She invites Dean to join her, and tells him that she loves him before disappearing. Though Dean denies ever having that dream before, it is an obvious lie. Sam then sees Jeremy nearby and chases after him, and Dean finds himself in a long hallway. He enters his motel room, and comes face-to-face with a dream version of him; he is his own worst nightmare. The Dream Dean comments on the real Dean's feelings of worthlessness and self-loathing; he also deems Dean to be as [...] "mindless and obedient as an attack dog", noting that his possessions, personality, and motives all stem from his father. When the Dream Dean calls him a [...] "good soldier and nothing else", the real Dean reacts violently and exclaims that he did not deserve the burdens that his father put onto him and that he does not deserve to go to Hell. The real Dean shoots his doppelganger with a shotgun, but he returns to life as a demon. The Dream Dean taunts him that he cannot escape his fate, and reminds him that exposure to Hell will transform him into a demon.|$|E

2500|$|Both in {{his works}} and direct overtures to the press, Friedrich Christian gave {{detailed}} accounts {{of his time}} in the Nazi party. In 1963 for instance, he claimed that Hitler refused to shave his famous mustache because people would think he was [...] "sick". He said his wife Alexandra commented to Hitler that [...] "his haircut and little mustache were always openings for cartoonists", but that Hitler replied [...] "one shouldn't change a company's trademark, even if one doesn't like <b>it</b> <b>any</b> <b>longer.</b> The public has become so used to it over the years that it would rebel if he suddenly looked completely different." ...|$|E
2500|$|Like {{his brother}} had done when his playing days {{had come to a}} {{premature}} close, Alick took to coaching and umpiring, at which Charles was definitely more controversial and erratic. Alick, meanwhile, was a big traditionalist throughout his days when it came to etiquette and the like, and he took his cricket very seriously. On one occasion, a colleague of his was belting out a catchy number on the field. Alick, unable to endure <b>it</b> <b>any</b> <b>longer,</b> went over to him and read the riot act: [...] "If you want to play cricket, play it; if you want to sing, go and sing; but, for Heaven's sake, don't sing comic songs in the slips!" ...|$|E
2500|$|The combat {{began at}} dawn, with intense cannon fire and rocket {{discharges}} over the Argentine batteries, which had less accurate and slower loading cannons. [...] From the beginning the Argentines suffered many casualties — 150 dead, 90 wounded. Furthermore, the barges {{that held the}} chains were burnt down, and the Republicano was lost, blown up by its own commander when {{he was unable to}} defend <b>it</b> <b>any</b> <b>longer.</b> A number of armed launches were also sunk in battle. The gunboats Restaurador and Lagos disengaged successfully and withdrew up river, towards Tonelero pass. The third gunboat and the armed barges also survived the action, but the dismantled brigantine Vigilante was scuttled by her crew and the remaining launches were destroyed by the combined fleet on 28 November.|$|E

2500|$|Upon {{returning}} to California, Stewart's optimism for San Francisco was short lived: despite the larger black professional class, {{there was little}} affluence and even more racial segregation than in Portland. [...] His legal partnership with Hudson struggled financially, but the two remained committed to it. [...] Ultimately, Stewart gave in to pressure. On April 14, 1919, unable to read his morning newspaper and fearing {{that he was about}} to go blind, Stewart wrote a note of farewell and shot himself in the head in his office. [...] His body was found the following day by a business associate. His suicide note said: [...] "I am going blind. [...] My sight is gone. [...] I can't see to read. [...] Poor Mac.

2500|$|The Hawthornes {{had three}} children. Their first was {{daughter}} Una, born March 3, 1844; {{her name was}} a reference to The Faerie Queene, to the displeasure of family members.

There is no escaping <b>it</b> <b>any</b> <b>longer.</b> I have business on earth now, and must look about me for the means of doing it." [...] In October 1845, the Hawthornes moved to Salem. In 1846, their son Julian was born. Hawthorne wrote to his sister Louisa on June 22, 1846: [...] "A small troglodyte made his appearance here at ten minutes to six o'clock this morning, who claimed to be your nephew." [...] Daughter Rose was born in May 1851, and Hawthorne called her his [...] "autumnal flower".|$|E

He has discovered, by trying to kick Sunny, that Sunny had been {{substituted}} with a sack of flour. Genghis uncovers the Quagmires' disguises as a result, and gives them canteen duty. The orphans, unable to stand <b>it</b> <b>any</b> <b>longer,</b> attempt to reveal that Coach Genghis is Count Olaf. About that time, Mr. Poe comes to deliver the candy and earrings.

2500|$|The church's {{successful}} {{competition with}} the ongoing and widespread atheistic propaganda, prompted new laws to be adopted in 1929 on [...] "Religious Associations" [...] as well as amendments to the constitution, which forbade all forms of public, social, communal, educational, publishing or missionary activities for religious believers. The Church thereby lost any public voice and was limited strictly to religious services {{that took place in}} the walls of churches. Atheist propaganda continued to have an unlimited right of propagation, which meant that the Church could not respond to the arguments used against <b>it</b> <b>any</b> <b>longer.</b> The Church was not permitted to run study groups for religious adults, organize picnics or cultural circles, or organize special services for groups of believers, such as schoolchildren, youth, women or mothers. Any pursuit of the true pastoral duties by clergymen became punishable by law. These laws also forbade Christian charity efforts, participation of children in religious activities, and religious functionaries were restricted to the area associated with them.|$|E
2500|$|Their {{first known}} mission sent the two {{brothers}} {{to the front lines}} of the Iberian War against the Sassanid Empire, reinforcing Belisarius at Mindouos. Belisarius was attempting to construct a fortress at this location. [...] "When the emperor (Justinian I) heard this, inasmuch as Belisarius was not able to beat off the Persians from the place with the army he had, he ordered another army to go thither, and also Coutzes and Bouzes, who at that time commanded the soldiers in Libanus. These two were brothers from Thrace, both young and inclined to be rash in engaging with the enemy. So both armies were gathered together and came in full force to the scene of the building operations, the Persians in order to hinder the work with all their power, and the Romans to defend the labourers. And a fierce battle took place in which the Romans were defeated, and there was a great slaughter of them, while some also were made captive by the enemy. Among these was Coutzes himself. All these captives the Persians led away to their own country, and, putting them in chains, confined them permanently in a cave; as for the fort, since no one defended <b>it</b> <b>any</b> <b>longer,</b> they razed what had been built to the ground." ...|$|E
2500|$|After a time {{living in}} one of the {{imperial}} residences in the Crimea, she received reports that her sons, her daughter-in-law and her grandchildren had been murdered. However, she publicly rejected the report as a rumour.

[...] "And nobody can help or liberate them - only God! My Lord save my poor, unlucky Nicky, help him in his hard ordeals!" [...] In her diary she comforted herself: [...] "I am sure they all got out of Russia and now the Bolsheviks are trying to hide the truth." [...] She firmly held on to this conviction until her death. The truth was too painful for her to admit publicly. Her letters to her son and his family have since almost all been lost; but in one that survives, she wrote to Nicholas: [...] "You know that my thoughts and prayers never leave you.
