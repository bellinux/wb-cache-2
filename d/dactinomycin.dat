50|$|There {{are several}} ways {{molecules}} (in this case, also known as ligands) can interact with DNA. Ligands may interact with DNA by covalently binding, electrostatically binding, or intercalating. Intercalation occurs when ligands of an appropriate size and chemical nature fit themselves in between base pairs of DNA. These ligands are mostly polycyclic, aromatic, and planar, and therefore often make good nucleic acid stains. Intensively studied DNA intercalators include berberine, ethidium bromide, proflavine, daunomycin, doxorubicin, and thalidomide. DNA intercalators are used in chemotherapeutic treatment to inhibit DNA replication in rapidly growing cancer cells. Examples include doxorubicin (adriamycin) and daunorubicin (both of which are used in treatment of Hodgkin's lymphoma), and <b>dactinomycin</b> (used in Wilm's tumour, Ewing's Sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma).|$|E

The genomic breakpoint junctions were amplified by PCR. Cleavage of DNA substrates containing the normal homologues of the MLL and AF- 4 translocation breakpoints was examined in vitro upon incubation with human DNA topoisomerase IIα and etoposide, etoposide catechol, etoposide quinone, or <b>dactinomycin.</b> The der(11) and der(4) genomic breakpoint junctions both involved MLL intron 6 and AF- 4 intron 3. Recombination was precise at the sequence level except for the overall gain of a single templated nucleotide. The translocation breakpoints in MLL and AF- 4 were DNA topoisomerase II cleavage sites. Etoposide and its metabolites, but not <b>dactinomycin,</b> enhanced cleavage at these sites. Assuming that DNA topoisomerase II was the mediator of the breakage, processing of the staggered nicks induced by DNA topoisomerase II, including exonucleolytic deletion and template-directed polymerization, would have been required before ligation of the ends to generate the observed genomic breakpoint junctions. These data are inconsistent with a translocation mechanism involving interchromosomal recombination by simple exchange of DNA topoisomerase II subunits and DNA-strand transfer; however, consistent with reciprocal DNA topoisomerase II cleavage events in MLL and AF- 4 in which both breaks became stable, the DNA ends were processed and underwent ligation.

40|$|Patients {{receiving}} antitumor chemotherapy are {{at increased}} risk of developing nosocomial infections, and the antibacterial therapy of such infections is often monitored by bioassay. The effect of antitumor agents on seven bioassay procedures using strains of Sarcina, Klebsiella, Clostridium, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus aureus, and S. epidermidis or Bacillus was evaluated. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of six antitumor drugs, cytarabine, <b>dactinomycin,</b> doxorubicin, 5 -fluorouracil, methotrexate, and vinblastine, determined for each of the test organisms, showed that 5 -fluorouracil, <b>dactinomycin,</b> and doxorubicin are used at blood levels sufficient to interfere with bioassay procedures. The other drugs have minimum inhibitory concentrations as much as 100 times the expected blood levels. Antibiotic (gentamicin, kanamycin, cephalothin, and carbenicillin) recovery experiments in the presence of therapeutic levels of antitumor agents showed no in vitro inactivation of antibiotic.

40|$|Objectives. To {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} of three different standard chemotherapy regimens for low-risk gestational trophoblastic disease according to the FIGO staging system in a single-institute setting. Methods. From 1980 until 2002, we retrospectively reviewed 108 cases with low-risk persistent gestational trophoblastic disease who were treated with first-line chemotherapy. Patients were divided in three groups according to chemotherapy regimen: patients treated with methotrexate (MTX group; n= 42), patients treated with <b>dactinomycin</b> (ACT group; n= 42) and patients treated with methotrexate and <b>dactinomycin</b> in combination (MACT group; n= 24). We compared the number of chemotherapy courses for achieving remission, the duration of treatment, the adverse side effects, {{the efficacy of}} the treatment and the need for performing a hysterectomy among the groups Results. The complete remission rates were 69 %, 61. 4 % and 79. 1 % for methotrexate (MTX), <b>dactinomycin</b> (ACT) and the combination regimen (MACT) treated groups, respectively (p= 0. 7). The duration of the treatment and the number of chemotherapy courses were similar among the groups (p = 0. 2 and p = 0. 4, respectively). Adverse side effects rate was reported to be 62. 5 % in the MACT group, 28. 6 % in the MTX group and 19. 1 % in the ACT group (p= 0. 0003). Second-line chemotherapy was indicated for 30 patients. Hysterectomy was performed in 21 patients overall, and there was no difference among the groups (P= 0. 6). Conclusion. Our analysis indicates that single-agent chemotherapy regimens are as effective as combination chemotherapy for low-risk gestational trophoblastic disease. <b>Dactinomycin</b> is a less toxic drug and might offer the best cost-effective treatment option.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{responsible for}} the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) -induced increase in cellular oncogene RNAs for c-jun, c-fos, and c-myc in human embryo lung cells (I. Boldogh, S. AbuBakar, and T. Albrecht, Science 247 : 561 - 564, 1990) were investigated. Results of transcription assays indicated that the rapid increase in RNA levels for the above-noted oncogenes was controlled {{at the transcriptional level}} and was related to enhanced transcription. The maximum rates of transcription for c-jun and c-fos genes occurred at 40 min postinfection, while for the c-myc gene the maximum rate occurred at about 60 min. The magnitude of HCMV-induced activation of these cellular genes was similar to the activation induced by serum. The half-lives of the cellular oncogenes showed similar decay rates after either serum or HCMV activation when measured by <b>dactinomycin</b> chase. The half-life for c-fos or c-jun was about 20 min, and that for c-myc was about 40 min. Furthermore, inhibition of the RNA increase by <b>dactinomycin</b> or by alpha-amanitin suggested that the increase in RNA levels was due to an increase in the transcriptional activity of oncogenes triggered by HCMV...|$|E
40|$|METHODS: The authors {{reviewed}} 131 children {{enrolled in}} National Wilms Tumor Study- 3 (NWTS- 3) who received preoperative treatment for tumors unable to be resected at surgery or judged inoperable by imaging evaluation. Preoperative biopsies {{were performed on}} 103 patients. Patients were assigned a pretreatment stage: stage II (11 patients), stage III (39 patients), stage IV (66 patients), and unknown (15 patients). The chemotherapy regimen included <b>dactinomycin</b> and vincristine (81 patients), <b>dactinomycin,</b> vincristine, and doxorubicin (30 patients), <b>dactinomycin,</b> vincristine, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (10 patients), and other (8 patients). Preoperative radiation therapy was started concurrently with chemotherapy (27 patients) or {{because of lack of}} response (14 patients). Two patients were given preoperative irradiation without chemotherapy. RESULTS: Response to therapy was assessed after the first trial of chemotherapy. Partial responses were noted in 110 patients (85 %), 3 had complete responses, 13 had no response or progression of disease, and 5 patients were not able to be evaluated. There {{were no significant differences in}} preoperative response to the different chemotherapy regimens. Median time interval from diagnosis to nephrectomy was 58. 5 days. When compared with NWTS- 3 patients not receiving preoperative treatment, survival was reduced for patients treated preoperatively (88 % vs. 74 %, respectively, 4 -year survival), which was only partially explained by differences in stage distribution. Median duration of follow-up was 5. 9 years. Lack of response to the preoperative treatment was associated with a poor prognosis. Eight children died before removal of the primary tumor. All eight had either progressive disease or no response to the preoperative treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The use of preoperative treatment can facilitate subsequent surgical resection in selected patients with inoperable Wilms tumors. Although these very large tumors [...] judged unable to be resected [...] have a somewhat worse prognosis, nephrectomy was completed in 93 % of patients after preoperative treatment. However, preoperative treatment will lead to less accurate surgical and pathologic staging, and undertreatment should be avoided in these high-risk patients...|$|E

40|$|A {{variant of}} the multidrug-resistant human sarcoma cell line Dx 5 was derived by co-selection with {{doxorubicin}} and the cyclosporin D analogue PSC 833, a potent inhibitor of the multidrug transporter P-glycoprotein. The variant DxP cells manifest an altered phenotype compared with Dx 5, with decreased cross-resistance to Vinca alkaloids and no resistance to <b>dactinomycin.</b> Resistance to doxorubicin and paclitaxel is retained. The multidrug resistance phenotype of DxP cells is not modulated by 2 �M PSC 833 or cyclosporine. DxP cells manifest a decreased ability to transport [3 H]cyclosporine. DNA heteroduplex analysis and sequencing reveal a mutant mdr 1 gene (deletion of a phenylalanine at amino acid residue 335) in the DxP cell line. The mutant P-glycoprotein has a decreased affinity for PSC 833 and vinblastine and a decreased ability to transport rhodamine 123. Transfection of the mutant mdr 1 gene into drug-sensitive MES-SA sarcoma cells confers resistance to both doxorubicin and PSC 833. Our study demonstrates that survival of cells exposed to doxorubicin and PSC 833 in a multistep selection occurred {{as a result of}} a P-glycoprotein mutation in transmembrane region 6.
