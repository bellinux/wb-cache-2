5|$|Because Air Force {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, Virginia Tech {{received the}} ball to begin the second half. Tech returned the kickoff to its 25-yard line, where the Hokie offense began the first drive {{of the second half}}. The Tech offense used rushes by Lee Suggs and passes by Bryan Randall to pick up several first downs and drive into Air Force territory. But once on the Falcons' side of the field, Tech proved unable to gain another first down and was even pushed back <b>into</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> territory by a penalty. Tech was forced to punt, and Air Force began its first offensive possession of the second half at its 20-yard line after a touchback.|$|E

5|$|In 1870, the British {{zoologist}} John Edward Gray placed Coquerel's giant {{mouse lemur}} <b>into</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> genus, Mirza. This classification was widely ignored and later rejected {{in the early}} 1930s by zoologists Ernst Schwarz, Guillaume Grandidier, and others, who felt that its longer fur and bushy tail did not merit a separate genus and instead placed it in Microcebus. British anatomist William Charles Osman Hill also favored this view in 1953, noting that despite its larger size (comparable to Cheirogaleus), its first upper premolar was proportionally small as in Microcebus. In 1977, French zoologist Jean-Jacques Petter also favored the Microcebus classification, despite the threefold size difference between Coquerel's giant mouse lemur {{and the other members}} of the genus.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, the Intercultural Center, a {{multicultural}} student space, moved into Lathrop {{in spite of}} initial disagreement {{by members of the}} house two years earlier when the idea was first proposed.

5|$|In 2012, {{the first}} Cairanoolithus fossils {{discovered}} outside of France were first reported by Albert G.

Three years later, Selles and Angel Galobart published a comprehensive reanalysis of Cairanoolithus, in which they formally named the new oofamily, Cairanoolithidae, to contain Cairanaoolithus. Contrary to Cousin's conclusions, Selles and Galobart separated the oospecies C. dughii and C. roussetensis. Also, they demonstrated that Cairanoolithus was not the eggs of an ornithopod or sauropod and conjectured {{that it could be}} the eggs of a nodosaur.|$|E

5|$|In recent years, MSU's {{music program}} has grown substantially. Music major {{enrollment}} {{increased more than}} 97% between 1991 and 2004.

The new college faces many new challenges, such as working with limited space and funding. Nevertheless, MSU's music college plans on continued success, placing an annual average of 25 graduate students in tenure stream university positions.|$|E

5|$|Netball {{emerged from}} early {{versions}} of basketball and evolved <b>into</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> sport {{as the number}} of women participating in sports increased. Basketball was invented in 1891 by James Naismith in the United States. The game was initially played indoors between two teams of nine players, using an association football that was thrown into closed-end peach baskets. Naismith's game spread quickly across the United States and variations of the rules soon emerged. Physical education instructor Senda Berenson developed modified rules for women in 1892; these eventually gave rise to women's basketball. Around this time separate intercollegiate rules were developed for men and women. The various basketball rules converged into a universal set in the United States.|$|E

5|$|The {{polynomial}} pA in an indeterminate X {{given by}} evaluation the determinant det(XIn−A) {{is called the}} characteristic polynomial of A. It is a monic polynomial of degree n.

According to the Cayley–Hamilton theorem, pA(A) = 0, that is, the result of substituting the matrix itself <b>into</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> characteristic polynomial yields the zero matrix.|$|E
