50|$|The {{island has}} no {{distinct}} dry or wet season {{but it has}} pronounced rainfall from October to January. The <b>heaviest</b> <b>precipitation</b> occurs in November. May is relatively the driest month.|$|R
5|$|August 19, 1976- Tropical Storm Dottie {{hits the}} southwestern {{portion of the}} state, {{dropping}} <b>heavy</b> <b>precipitation</b> across its path including around 8inches (200mm) in the Coral Gables. The rainfall led to flooding and road closures near Miami.|$|E
5|$|In Nassau, Bahamas, Isidore {{produced}} flooding {{rains and}} gales. There, the storm forced {{the closure of}} schools and banks. <b>Heavy</b> <b>precipitation</b> fell throughout the island chain, but no serious damage was reported.|$|E
5|$|The {{precursor}} disturbance {{was expected}} to bring heavy, yet needed rainfall to the Bahamas. The precursor disturbance dropped <b>heavy</b> <b>precipitation</b> while moving across Florida, including in Indian River County, and also produced 6–8ft (1.8–2.4m) waves with moderate wind gusts.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Forecast of {{expected}} weather conditions across the eastern United States for Saturday, January 23. Blue indicates snow, green indicates rain, and purple indicates mixed precipitation. Darker shades denote <b>heavier</b> <b>precipitation.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{climate is}} mostly arid {{subtropical}} desert, with little rainfall. Winters are mild and dry, with most precipitation falling between January and May. The {{area of the}} country with the <b>heaviest</b> <b>precipitation</b> is the Kopet Dag Range.|$|R
2500|$|All {{precipitation}} falls as rain, characterised by air mass-type showers. Annual rainfall averages , {{with the}} <b>heaviest</b> <b>precipitation</b> from May to December. February is the driest month with [...] of rain, and August the wettest month, averaging [...] of rain.|$|R
5|$|Due to Mitch's large circulation, {{it dropped}} <b>heavy</b> <b>precipitation</b> {{as far south}} as Panama, {{especially}} in the Darién and Chiriquí provinces. The flooding washed away a few roads and bridges, and damaged numerous houses and schools, leaving thousands homeless. The hurricane left three casualties in Panama.|$|E
5|$|Early in its duration, Isa caused light {{rainfall}} and moderate winds on Pohnpei. Later, a stationary rainband from the typhoon dropped <b>heavy</b> <b>precipitation</b> on Guam during its dry season. Damage in the Guam National Weather Service {{area of responsibility}} totaled $1million (1997USD, $ USD), the majority of it from crop damage. No deaths were reported.|$|E
5|$|Construction in Norway {{has always}} been {{characterized}} {{by the need to}} shelter people, animals, and property from harsh weather, including predictably cold winters and frost, <b>heavy</b> <b>precipitation</b> in certain areas, wind and storms; and {{to make the most of}} scarce building resources. Until modern times, transportation infrastructure was also primitive, and builders largely had to rely on locally available materials.|$|E
2500|$|Rainfall {{is below}} average with the <b>heaviest</b> <b>precipitation</b> on the South Downs with [...] of {{rainfall}} per year. The close proximity of Sussex to the Continent of Europe, results in cold spells {{in winter and}} hot, humid weather in summer.|$|R
50|$|All {{precipitation}} falls as rain, characterised by air mass-type showers. Annual rainfall averages 2213 mm, {{with the}} <b>heaviest</b> <b>precipitation</b> from May to December. February is the driest month with 18 mm of rain, and August the wettest month, averaging 298 mm of rain.|$|R
50|$|Rainfall {{is below}} average with the <b>heaviest</b> <b>precipitation</b> on the South Downs with 950mm (37 in) of {{rainfall}} per year. The close proximity of Sussex to the Continent of Europe, results in cold spells {{in winter and}} hot, humid weather in summer.|$|R
5|$|Intensity of {{precipitation}} is primarily measured for meteorological concerns. However, {{it can be}} of concern to aviation as <b>heavy</b> <b>precipitation</b> can limit visibility. Also, intensity of freezing rain can determine how hazardous it is for pilots to fly nearby certain locations since {{it can be an}} in-flight hazard by depositing ice on the wings of aircraft, which can be detrimental to flight.|$|E
5|$|Numerous ships {{encountered}} the hurricane along its course. On the President Harding, {{en route to}} New York, one crew member drowned due to the rough conditions and 73 crew and passengers suffered injury, of various severity, requiring a call for emergency medical supplies. The ship itself sustained a bit of damage. As the storm passed near the island of Bermuda, it generated strong winds—gusting to —and <b>heavy</b> <b>precipitation.</b> Damage was fairly significant; the winds uprooted trees, shattered windows, and disrupted public utilities.|$|E
5|$|The {{combination}} of southeastern trade winds and northwestern monsoons produces a hot rainy season (November–April) with frequently destructive cyclones, and a relatively cooler dry season (May–October). Rain clouds originating over the Indian Ocean discharge {{much of their}} moisture over the island's eastern coast; the <b>heavy</b> <b>precipitation</b> supports the area's rain forest ecosystem. The central highlands are both drier and cooler while the west is drier still, and a semi-arid climate prevails in the southwest and southern interior of the island.|$|E
50|$|After 1893, {{the lakes}} water level sank almost {{continuously}} for nearly 10 years, {{with a slight}} rise every winter. <b>Heavier</b> <b>precipitation,</b> beginning in 1903, gradually filled the lake to about half the depth above its minimum level since 1883. Then in January, 1916, a flood rapidly raised the level to overflowing.|$|R
5000|$|Newport has mild, {{wet weather}} {{throughout}} the year with the <b>heaviest</b> <b>precipitation</b> falling during the winter months. The city averages 0.4 afternoons annually with maximum temperatures equalling or exceeding 90 F and 29 mornings with minimum temperatures of 32 F or lower. Historic extreme temperatures have varied between 1 F in winter and 100 F in summer.|$|R
25|$|In {{the lower}} {{section of the}} creek there is {{significant}} groundwater entering the creek. As it discharges, it weathers the gypsum and limestone. This results in increased sulfates in the water, and bicarbonates and calcium have also been found near the falls. These concentrations are in winter and spring, when <b>heavier</b> <b>precipitation</b> and runoff offsets {{the impact of the}} groundwater.|$|R
5|$|The cyclone {{produced}} peak {{winds of}} 50mph (85km/h) in Nassau, Bahamas, causing no reported damage. Crops were damaged by high winds and <b>heavy</b> <b>precipitation</b> on Eleuthera. About 30 {{percent of the}} tomato crops were destroyed during the storm. A man who attempted to secretly seed and weaken the storm was missing and presumed dead after his plane disappeared off Miami, Florida. Multiple searches by the Coast Guard were unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|The {{remnants}} of Beryl produced locally <b>heavy</b> <b>precipitation</b> peaking at about 12inches (300mm) in east-central Texas, resulting in some reports of flash flooding. The rainfall flooded some roads and also causes severe river flooding on the Angelina River. Remnant moisture dropped about 5inches (125mm) {{of rain in}} southeast Oklahoma and 3inches (75mm) in southwestern Arkansas. Further inland, the {{remnants of}} Beryl cooled temperatures and provided relief to the severe heat wave in the central United States.|$|E
5|$|Upon making landfall, Waveland, Mississippi {{recorded}} a peak storm surge of 4.12feet (1.26m). Sustained winds there peaked at 31mph (50km/h), and a peak gust of 41mph (66km/h). Tropical Storm Bertha produced moderate to <b>heavy</b> <b>precipitation</b> across southern Mississippi, including {{a total of}} 10.25inches (260.35mm) in Pascagoula. In Moss Point, the rainfall resulted in flooding which entered 15 to 20houses and several cars. The rainfall also flooded roadways and streets. Damage in Mississippi totaled to $50,000 (2002USD, $60,000 2008USD).|$|E
50|$|Closer to {{the center}} of {{tropical}} cyclone, the eyewall also exhibits the appearance of a bar, and high lightning activity occurs within this central bar. After the bar passes through, the strongest winds and often the <b>heaviest</b> <b>precipitation</b> abruptly changes to calmer conditions within the eye, before the eyewall passes over again and the strongest winds arrive from the opposite direction.|$|R
50|$|In {{the lower}} {{section of the}} creek there is {{significant}} groundwater entering the creek. As it discharges, it weathers the gypsum and limestone. This results in increased sulfates in the water, and bicarbonates and calcium have also been found near the falls. These concentrations are in winter and spring, when <b>heavier</b> <b>precipitation</b> and runoff offsets {{the impact of the}} groundwater.|$|R
5000|$|Cambodia has a {{temperature}} range from [...] and experiences tropical monsoons. Southwest monsoons blow inland bringing moisture-laden winds from the Gulf of Thailand and Indian Ocean from May to October. The northeast monsoon ushers {{in the dry}} season, which lasts from November to April. The country experiences the <b>heaviest</b> <b>precipitation</b> from September to October with the driest period occurring from January to February.|$|R
5|$|At the time, Jeanne was one {{of three}} November hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico; it was the first {{tropical}} cyclone to attain hurricane strength in the Gulf of Mexico during November. The late season storm surprised maritime interests, and two barges broke free from towing vessels. Indirectly, the hurricane produced <b>heavy</b> <b>precipitation</b> that peaked at 23.28inches (591mm) in Key West. Minor beach erosion occurred along the Texas coast, where tides were two to four feet above normal; coastal flooding affected the state, which was heavily impacted by tropical cyclones in August and September. Jeanne caused no deaths.|$|E
5|$|Danny {{had only}} minor effects on land. However, it {{triggered}} high surf and rip currents from Florida through the Mid-Atlantic states, {{leading to the}} death of a 12-year-old boy in North Carolina. The cyclone's remnants contributed to widespread rainfall in the northeast United States. At one point, some weather forecasts predicted Danny to rapidly strengthen, and hit Nantucket as a Category 1 Hurricane, although this never occurred. Localized flooding was reported, particularly in Pennsylvania. It later caused <b>heavy</b> <b>precipitation</b> and power outages in Atlantic Canada.|$|E
5|$|Farther inland, Arlene {{turned to}} the west-southwest along the {{building}} ridge. The storm decreased in strength upon doing so; its mid- and low-level circulations became increasingly decoupled, with the latter turning elongated and ill-defined. Early on July1, the NHC downgraded Arlene to a tropical depression, and the cyclone dissipated over the high terrain of the Sierra Madre Mountains shortly thereafter. Arlene's remnants continued to produce <b>heavy</b> <b>precipitation</b> over central Mexico, and with high air pressures offshore a tight pressure gradient generated a strong easterly breeze along the country's Pacific coastlines.|$|E
50|$|Uruguay has {{a largely}} uniform {{temperature}} throughout the year, with summers being tempered by winds off the Atlantic; severe cold in winter is unknown. The <b>heaviest</b> <b>precipitation</b> occurs during the autumn months, although more frequent rainy spells occur in winter. The {{mean annual precipitation}} is generally greater than 40 in, decreasing with distance from the sea coast, and is relatively evenly distributed throughout the year.|$|R
40|$|Heavy {{rains and}} severe {{flooding}} frequently plaque California. The heavy rains {{are most often}} associated with large scale cyclonic and frontal systems, where large scale dynamics and large moisture influx from the tropical Pacific interact. however, the complex topography along the west coast also interacts with the large scale influences, producing local areas with <b>heavier</b> <b>precipitation.</b> In this paper, we {{look at some of}} the local interactions with the large scale...|$|R
50|$|Papeete {{features}} a tropical monsoon climate {{with a wet}} season and dry season. However, precipitation is observed even during the city's dry season. The dry season is short, covering only the months of August and September. The {{rest of the year}} is wet, with the <b>heaviest</b> <b>precipitation</b> falling in the months of December and January. Temperatures are relatively constant throughout the course of the year, averaging around 25 C.|$|R
