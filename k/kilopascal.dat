40|$|A {{fiber optic}} {{spectrophotometric}} system {{was used to}} monitor the in vivo oxygenation of leghemoglobin in intact, attached soybean root nodules (Glycine max L. Merr. × USDA 16 Bradyrhizobium japonicum) which were flattened during development by growth in narrow, glass-walled cuvettes. When equilibrated at an external pO 2 of 20 <b>kilopascals,</b> leghemoglobin was 36. 6 ± 5. 4 % oxygenated, a value estimated to represent an infected cell O 2 concentration of 21. 5 nanomolar. Increasing the external pO 2 from 20 to 25 <b>kilopascals</b> caused a rapid increase in leghemoglobin oxygenation, followed by a recovery to the initial level, all within 7. 5 minutes. At 25 <b>kilopascals</b> O 2, the rates of H 2 and CO 2 evolution {{were similar to those}} at 20 <b>kilopascals.</b> Since respiration had not increased, the results support the proposal that nodules adapt to increased external pO 2 by regulating their resistance to O 2 diffusion...|$|R

25|$|Increases in {{barometric}} pressure increase a pendulum's period slightly {{due to the}} first two effects, by about 0.11 seconds per day per <b>kilopascal</b> (0.37 seconds per day per inch of mercury or 0.015 seconds per day per torr). Researchers using pendulums to measure the acceleration of gravity had to correct the period for the air pressure at the altitude of measurement, computing the equivalent period of a pendulum swinging in vacuum. A pendulum clock was first operated in a constant-pressure tank by Friedrich Tiede in 1865 at the Berlin Observatory, and by 1900 the highest precision clocks were mounted in tanks that were kept at a constant pressure to eliminate changes in atmospheric pressure. Alternatively, in some a small aneroid barometer mechanism attached to the pendulum compensated for this effect.|$|E

50|$|For {{pressure}} refueling, a {{high-pressure hose}} is attached and fuel is pumped in at 275 <b>kilopascals</b> (40 psi) {{and a maximum}} of 310 <b>kilopascals</b> (45 psi) for most commercial aircraft. Pressure for military aircraft, especially fighters, ranges up to 415 <b>kilopascals</b> (60 psi). Air being displaced in the tanks is usually vented overboard through a single vent on the aircraft. Because {{there is only one}} attachment point, fuel distribution between tanks is either automated or it is controlled from a control panel at the fueling point or in the cockpit. An early use of pressure refueling was on the de Havilland Comet and Sud Aviation Caravelle. Larger aircraft allow for two or more attachment points, however this is still referred to as single-point refueling, as either attachment point can refuel all of the tanks. Multiple attachments allow for faster fuel flows.|$|R

40|$|Xylem {{vessels in}} grapevines Vitis labrusca L. and Vitis riparia Michx. growing in New England {{contained}} air over winter and yet filled with xylem sap and recovered their maximum hydraulic conductance {{during the month}} before leaf expansion in late May. During this period root pressures between 10 and 100 <b>kilopascals</b> were measured. Although some air in vessels apparently dissolved in ascending xylem sap, results indicated that some is pushed out of vessels and then out of the vine. Air in the vessel network distal to advancing xylem sap was compressed at about 3 kilopascals; independent measurements indicated this was sufficient to push air across vessel ends, and from vessels to the exterior through dead vine tips, inflorescence scars, and points on the bark. Once wetted, vessel ends previously air-permeable at 3 <b>kilopascals</b> remained sealed against air at pressures up to 2 and 3 megapascals. Permeability at 3 <b>kilopascals</b> was restored by dehydrating vines below − 2. 4 megapascals. We suggest that the decrease in permeability with hydration is due to formation of water films across pores in intervascular pit membranes; this water seal can maintain a pressure difference of roughly 2 megapascals, and prevents cavitation by aspirated air at xylem pressures less negative than − 2. 4 megapascals...|$|R
40|$|Atmospheric {{pressure}} and oxygen concentration of human-occupied space vehicles and habitats {{are an important}} life support parameter. The atmosphere is critical in terms of not only safety but {{also in terms of}} maximizing human capabilities at the point of scientific discovery.

EVAs are carried out in low pressure (4. 3 psi/ 29. 6 <b>kilopascals)</b> space suits running at 100 percent oxygen. New suits currently in development will be capable of running at a range of pressures between approximately 8. 2 psi/ 56. 5 <b>kilopascals</b> and 4. 3 psi/ 29. 6 <b>kilopascals.</b> In order to carry out high-frequency EVA phases of a mission safely and more efficiently, it is advantageous to have cabin or vehicle atmospheres at lower total {{pressure and}} higher oxygen concentrations. This allows for much reduced pre-breathe times for a fixed risk of decompression sickness and thus more efficient EVAs. The recommended oxygen concentration is 32 % and represents a trade with respect to controlling the risk of decompression sickness and risk of fire.
