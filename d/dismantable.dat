We establish the analogues for graphs of results of Duffus, Poguntke and Rival about fixed point sets and cores in posets...|$|E
40|$|When we use {{the urban}} {{metabolism}} model for urban development, the input in the model is often valuable landscape, being the resource of the development, and output {{in the form of}} urban sprawl, as a result of city transformations. The resilience of these “output” areas is low. The lack of resilience is mainly caused by the inflexibility in these areas where existing buildings, infrastructure, and public space cannot be moved when deemed necessary. In this article, a new vision for the city is proposed in which the locations of these objects are flexible and, as a result, the resilience is higher: a <b>Dismantable</b> City. Currently, the development of this sort of city is constrained by technical, social, and regulatory practice. However, the perspective of a <b>Dismantable</b> City is worthwhile because it is able to deal with sudden, surprising, and unprecedented climate impacts. Through self-organizing processes the city becomes adjustable and its objects mobile. This allows the city to configure itself according to environmental demands. The city is then able to withstand or even anticipate floods, heat waves, droughts, or bushfires. Adjustability can be found in several directions: creating multiple layers for urban activities (multi-layer urbanism), easing the way objects are constructed (light urbanism), or re-using abandoned spaces (transformable urbanism) ...|$|E
40|$|Most {{pieces of}} case {{furniture}} (kitchen and bathroom furniture, cabinets, wardrobes, tables and etc.) {{are made of}} 18  mm thick wood particle boards finished with various coatings. This three-layered constructional material is obtained by bonding wood particles of different fractions with synthetic resins using heating. The exploitation duration and quality of case furniture {{is determined by the}} mechanical properties of wood particle boards and the construction of joints of wood-based panels. On a frequent basis, pieces of case furniture with non-dismantable and <b>dismantable</b> construction are joined by using multidowel glued joints and cam connecting fittings intended for furniture, respectively. Wood-based panels can be joined with mitre joints whose mechanical properties have not undergone testing and comparison with regular joints when applying insertable wooden dowels or furniture connecting fittings. During the testing of particle board properties it was established that joining wood-based panels in this way ensures most efficient use of mechanical characteristics of the particleboard. In addition to the properties of the mitre joint, the tests also allowed determining the bending strength, tensile strength and bonding strength of the constructional material, and providing an original method for testing board properties, which can be successfully applied to the prediction of properties of the mitre joint. Tests were performed by using a universal tensile testing machine P- 0. 5. Joints were bonded by applying PVA dispersion. The surface of boards was veneered by using mahogany veneer and urea formaldehyde resin. It was found that mitre joints of wood particle boards can withstand loads that are higher from 2 to 4 times, in comparison to glued doweled joints or joints constructed with cam connecting fittings.

30|$|The {{strategy}} of indulging the future aims {{to increase the}} spatial resilience in the city. In accommodating change urban form should be flexible and adaptable. Rather than creating fixed patterns, urban forms are allowed to emerge, the shape depending on external factors and change. For the urban environment {{to be open to}} change a systems approach is helpful. Complex, self-organising, adaptive systems, as cities are seen (Andersson 2012; Ikeda 2004; Bettencourt 2013, 2015; Batty 2013; Portugali 2000; Webster and Lai 2003; Roggema 2012 a; De Roo et al. 2012; Portugali et al. 2012), have the capability to adapt to change. Self-organisation of the city, or the society of the city can be ‘planned’ by setting rules about the relation between built elements, being buildings, linear elements or district elements. These urban codes regulate how these elements relate to each other, informing planning in a qualitative way (Alfasi and Portugali 2007). Urban coding will generate an indirect order, e.g. a nomocratic approach), by creating a stable and simple set of abstract and general relational rules, which enable society itself to be highly flexible. Leaving options open for society. The problem of complexity and intrinsic unpredictability requires a radical overhaul of the tools used to regulate land-use—particularly by exploring the idea of shifting the emphasis to framework instruments, such as urban codes (Moroni 2015). Swarm planning (Roggema 2012 a) suggests such a framework for dynamic environments, in which different paces of change are accommodated by different layers of planning, and planning starts with the biggest uncertainty or threat in mind. The impact of an intervention dealing with this uncertainty, creates a potential tipping point, which in turn regulates the spatial configuration of the future as it subsequently will be filled with spatial additions, and built elements by society. Moreover, when built elements of which the city is comprised become <b>dismantable,</b> the urban codes can be reinterpreted and the city may self-organise into new, best-fitting configurations. In order for this to happen, spaces, and also physical elements, {{have to be able to}} change over sometimes very short time periods. Open spaces and structures in the city, such as the green network, should be designed in such a way that they can expand and shrink in size or change land use whenever necessary (Roggema 2014). This is a new task for urbanism.|$|E
40|$|The {{majority}} of the Worlds’ population lives in cities, which are increasingly under pressure {{of all kinds of}} change. In general this is seen as an increase of risk: placing more people under influence of change makes them more vulnerable. In a linear world this may be true, but cities have a coincidental luck: they are complex systems and able to adjust when unexpected impacts occur. Despite the fact that a city is qualified as a complex system, we still do not treat her as one. Most of the literature only emphasises analysis and understanding of the city as a complex system: the city is explained. The main problem originates here: this analysis is still undertaken from a technical-rational planning perspective. When it comes to planning a city to become resilient for change, it involuntary brings solutions based in the engineering paradigm. And these create, for the larger part, more a resistant urban system than a responsive one. Alternatively, to create urban, socio-ecological systems with high resiliency, two elements need {{to be part of a}} fundamental different planning approach: first the desired outcome of the planning process must enhance realisation of agile, rhizomic cities and secondly the planning process itself must be organised differently in order to achieve these desired outcomes, for instance through bridging the interests and knowledge of scientists and policymakers. 1. Swarm planning is a recent addition to the toolkit of the urban designer, planner or futurist It emphasises the complexity of both the spatial system as well as the impacts as a result of wicked problems. Instead of creating a fixed plan for the future Swarm Planning proposes to design strategic interventions and literally create space for change. The designs delivered as result of the Swarm Planning approach anticipate uncertainties of future change and take these as the starting point of spatial developments. When the spatial grades of freedom are subsequently increased the effects of spatial interventions lead to emergent landscapes. The impact of this new approach for practice is dual: the spatial future of a region is no longer unchangeable as it amplifies the potential to modify land-use or urban patterns and secondly, the planning process demands from policymakers and politicians the ability to ‘undecide’, amending former decisions according to new insights. 2. The ‘science-policy-interface’ is widely discussed, but in many occasions they continue to be separated worlds. One way of bridging the gap is to make scientists functional in the policymaking process, and simultaneously allow local experts to contribute their (nonacademic) knowledge to scientific discussions and discourses. In concrete planning processes they even must be challenged to change their respective roles. The way this has been undertaken is by organising faceto- face creative discussion with a concrete objective: e. g. to create a spatial vision for a region under change, allowing participants to contribute their skills, knowledge and experience to the design. As result of these planning processes it is proposed to mandate a group of planners, consisting of a combination of policymakers and scientists, with the task to constantly ‘check and balance’ whether new design interventions are beneficial. This group of people must also constantly change to prevent people to become ‘attached to their seats’ Several examples of the above described approach will be illustrated in this paper: (1) Climate proofing the regional plan for Groningen province, the Netherlands, (2) Floodable Landscape, Eemsdelta, the Netherlands, (3) Bushfire Resilient Landscape of Bendigo, Victoria, Australia and (4) <b>Dismantable</b> City, consisting of three variants: the Multiple Layer City, Light Urbanism and the Empty City, all in the Netherlands...|$|E
