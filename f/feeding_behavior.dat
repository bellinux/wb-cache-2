5|$|A typical female {{vampire bat}} weighs 40grams and can consume over 20grams (1 fluid ounce) {{of blood in}} a 20-minute feed.

40|$|It {{is known}} that plant viruses can change the {{performance}} of their vectors. However, there have been no reports on whether or how a semipersistent plant virus manipulates the <b>feeding</b> <b>behaviors</b> of its whitefly vectors. Cucurbit chlorotic yellows virus (CCYV) (genus Crinivirus, family Closteroviridae) is an emergent plant virus in many Asian countries and is transmitted specifically by B and Q biotypes of tobacco whitefly, Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius), in a semipersistent manner. In the present study, we used electrical penetration graph (EPG) technique to investigate the effect of CCYV on the <b>feeding</b> <b>behaviors</b> of B. tabaci. The results showed that CCYV altered <b>feeding</b> <b>behaviors</b> of both biotypes and sexes of B. tabaci with different degrees. CCYV had stronger effects on <b>feeding</b> <b>behaviors</b> of Q biotype than those of B biotype, by increasing duration of phloem salivation and sap ingestion, and could differentially manipulate <b>feeding</b> <b>behaviors</b> of males and females in both biotype whiteflies, with more phloem ingestion in Q biotype males and more non-phloem probing in B biotype males than their respective females. With regard to <b>feeding</b> <b>behaviors</b> related to virus transmission, these results indicated that, when carrying CCYV, B. tabaci Q biotype plays more roles than B biotype, and males make greater contribution than females...|$|R
40|$|Maternal mind-mindedness, or the {{tendency}} to view the child as a mental agent, {{has been shown to}} predict sensitive and responsive parenting behavior. As yet the role of mind-mindedness has not been explored in the context of feeding interactions. This study evaluates the relations between maternal mind-mindedness at 6 months of infant age and subsequently observed maternal sensitivity and <b>feeding</b> <b>behaviors</b> with children at age 1 year. Maternal mind-mindedness was greater in mothers who had breast-fed compared to formula-fed. Controlling for breast-feeding, mind-mindedness at 6 months was correlated with observations of more sensitive and positive <b>feeding</b> <b>behaviors</b> at 1 year of age. Mind-mindedness was also associated with greater general maternal sensitivity in play and this general parenting sensitivity mediated the effect of mind-mindedness on more sensitive and positive <b>feeding</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Interventions to promote maternal tendency to consider their child’s mental states may encourage more adaptive parental <b>feeding</b> <b>behaviors...</b>|$|R

5|$|Conant (1929) gave a {{detailed}} account of the <b>feeding</b> <b>behavior</b> of a captive specimen from South Carolina. When prey was introduced, the snake quickly became attentive and made an attack. Frogs and small birds were seized and held until movement stopped. Larger prey was approached in a more cautious manner; a rapid strike was executed after which the snake would withdraw. In 2.5 years, the snake had accepted three species of frogs, including a large bullfrog, a spotted salamander, water snakes, garter snakes, sparrows, young rats, and three species of mice. Brimley (1944) described a captive specimen that ate copperheads (A. contortrix), as well as members of its own species, keeping its fangs embedded in its victims until they had been immobilized.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the highly}} {{specialized}} mandibles, {{scientists believe that}} the ants exhibited habits no longer seen in extant ants. The highly movable head suggests that mobility was an important factor for them (probably for <b>feeding</b> <b>behavior),</b> and the rugose projections {{may have played a}} major role in nest excavation because the mandibles would have prevented such activity. Zigrasimecia most likely interacted with the extinct ant genus Gerontoformica through conflict and probably shared some of their ecological niches. The mandibles of these ants were probably used for mechanical interactions with food, and they may also have served as traps for potential arthropod prey such as mites and small flies. Zigrasimecia was possibly a generalist predator.|$|E

50|$|Studies {{of insect}} feeding {{patterns}} can be conducted using electrical penetration graphs which allow researchers to match electrical waveforms to specific <b>feeding</b> <b>behaviors</b> in insects. Insects {{may choose to}} feed on different parts of a plant. By studying the waveforms produced for different <b>feeding</b> <b>behaviors</b> and then matching them to video images and histology of insects feeding, researchers can classify which part of a plant an insect feeds on. These waveforms may also give other valuable feeding information like {{the speed at which}} an insect feeds.|$|R
50|$|Rodents {{share common}} species-typical <b>feeding</b> <b>behaviors</b> (also known as order-typical, since all these creatures {{are members of}} the same order, rodentia. For example, certain types of beavers, squirrels, rats, guinea pigs, hamsters, and prairie dogs all locate food by {{sniffing}} for it, grasp for food with their mouths, sit on their hindquarters to eat, and grasp/manipulate the food with their hands. But they each also have more unique <b>feeding</b> <b>behaviors.</b> For example, beavers do grasp for food with their mouths, but sometimes they use a single paw instead. And many of the rodents manipulate the food with their digits in unique ways.|$|R
5|$|In 2012, bite {{marks on}} two fragmentary gastralia of the holotype {{specimen}} {{of the large}} ornithomimosaur Deinocheirus mirificus were reported. The {{size and shape of}} the bite marks match the teeth of Tarbosaurus, the largest known predator from the Nemegt Formation. Various types of feeding traces were identified; punctures, gouges, striae, fragmentary teeth, and combinations of the above marks. The bite marks probably represent <b>feeding</b> <b>behavior</b> instead of aggression between the species, and the fact that bite marks were not found elsewhere on the body indicates the predator focused on internal organs. Tarbosaurus bite marks have also been identified on hadrosaur and sauropod fossils, but theropod bite marks on bones of other theropods are very rare in the fossil record.|$|E
5|$|A 2007 {{study by}} Roach and Brinkman has called into {{question}} the cooperative pack hunting behavior of Deinonychus, based on what is known of modern carnivore hunting and the taphonomy of tenontosaur sites. Modern archosaurs (birds and crocodiles) and Komodo dragons display little cooperative hunting; instead, they are usually either solitary hunters, or are drawn to previously killed carcasses, where much conflict occurs between individuals of the same species. For example, in situations where groups of Komodo dragons are eating together, the largest individuals eat first and will attack smaller Komodos that attempt to feed; if the smaller animal is killed, it is cannibalized. When this information {{is applied to the}} tenontosaur sites, it appears that what is found is consistent with Deinonychus having a Komodo or crocodile-like feeding strategy. Deinonychus skeletal remains found at these sites are from subadults, with missing parts consistent with having been eaten by other Deinonychus. On the other hand, a paper by Li et al. describes track sites with similar foot spacing and parallel trackways, implying gregarious packing behavior instead of uncoordinated <b>feeding</b> <b>behavior.</b>|$|E
5|$|Balaenids rely {{on their}} huge heads, {{as opposed to the}} rorquals' throat pleats, to feed effectively. This <b>feeding</b> <b>behavior</b> allows them to grow very big and bulky, without the {{necessity}} for a streamlined body. They have callosities, unlike other whales, {{with the exception of the}} bowhead whale. Rorquals have a higher proportion of muscle tissue and tend to be negatively buoyant, whereas right whales have a higher proportion of blubber and are positively buoyant. Gray whales are easily distinguished from other extant cetaceans by their sleet-gray color, dorsal ridges (knuckles on the back), and their gray-white scars left from parasites. As with the rorquals, their throat pleats increase the capacity of their throats, allowing them to filter larger volumes of water at once. Gray whales are bottom-feeders, meaning they sift through sand to get their food. They usually turn on their sides, scoop up sediment into their mouths and filter out benthic creatures like amphipods, which leave noticeable marks on their heads.|$|E

25|$|Several <b>feeding</b> <b>behaviors</b> {{have been}} {{proposed}} for Masiakasaurus {{on the basis of}} its unusual dentition. Because the front teeth would have been well suited for grasping, Masiakasaurus may have consumed small vertebrates, invertebrates, and possibly even fruits.|$|R
5|$|One study {{looked at}} how reward {{discounting}} is context specific. By differing {{the time and}} space between small and large rewards, {{they were able to}} test how these factors affected the decision making in tamarins and marmosets. They showed that tamarins will travel longer distances for larger food rewards, but will not wait as long as marmosets. Conversely, marmosets will wait longer, but will not travel as far. They then concluded that this discounting behavior directly correlates to the normal <b>feeding</b> <b>behavior</b> of species. The tamarins feed over large distances, looking for insects. Capturing and eating insects requires a quick and impulsive decision and action. The marmosets, on the other hand, eat tree sap, which takes more time to secrete, but does not require that the marmosets to cover large distances.|$|E
5|$|Zigrasimecia {{is known}} for its unusual morphology, and most likely had habits no longer seen in extant species. It has a highly movable head that {{suggests}} mobility was an important factor for them (this is probably for <b>feeding</b> <b>behavior).</b> The morphology of the mandibles would have prevented nest excavation, so the rugose projections on the head may have provided assistance. There is no evidence that Cretaceous ants exhibited nesting behavior, although the queen caste in Z. tonsora suggests that a dealate queen was needed for creating nests. Also, Zigrasimecia and Gerontoformica ants coexisted with each other; this is evident as a recovered piece of amber showed both genera trapped inside. This means that the two ants may have shared some of their ecological niches and possibly interacted with each other through fighting.|$|E
5|$|Diplodocines have {{highly unusual}} teeth {{compared}} to other sauropods. The crowns are long and slender, and elliptical in cross-section, while the apex forms a blunt, triangular point. The most prominent wear facet is on the apex, though unlike all other wear patterns observed within sauropods, diplodocine wear patterns are on the labial (cheek) side of both {{the upper and lower}} teeth. What this means is that Diplodocus and other diplodocids had a radically different feeding mechanism than other sauropods. Unilateral branch stripping is the most likely <b>feeding</b> <b>behavior</b> of Diplodocus, as it explains the unusual wear patterns of the teeth (coming from tooth–food contact). In unilateral branch stripping, one tooth row would have been used to strip foliage from the stem, while the other would act as a guide and stabilizer. With the elongated preorbital (in front of the eyes) region of the skull, longer portions of stems could be stripped in a single action. Also, the palinal (backwards) motion of the lower jaws could have contributed two significant roles to feeding behaviour: 1) an increased gape, and 2) allowed fine adjustments of the relative positions of the tooth rows, creating a smooth stripping action.|$|E

40|$|The rising rate {{of obesity}} in the {{pediatric}} population has demanded further investigation {{from members of}} the health care community. Numerous exercise and nutrition programs have been developed to help combat the growing rate of obesity within the pediatric population but many lack the family-centered approach needed to achieve increased compliance with the prescribed plan of care. Both parenting styles and parental <b>feeding</b> <b>behaviors</b> have been shown to play a contributing role in the weight of children. According to previous research, the authoritarian parenting style often leads to an increased BMI in children. Research examining parental <b>feeding</b> <b>behaviors</b> indicates that high rates of disinhibition, especially within mothers, contribute to an increased BMI in children. Very few research studies have examined both factors and the relationship they have with BMI in school-age children and adolescents. This research study used a descriptive design to explore parenting styles, parental <b>feeding</b> <b>behaviors</b> and BMI in school-age children and adolescents.

5|$|Carnivores {{include both}} pack hunters and solitary hunters. The solitary hunter {{depends on a}} {{powerful}} bite at the canine teeth to subdue their prey, and thus exhibits a strong mandibular symphysis. In contrast, a pack hunter, which delivers many shallower bites, has a comparably weaker mandibular symphysis. Thus, researchers can use {{the strength of the}} mandibular symphysis in fossil carnivore specimens to determine what kind of hunter it wasa pack hunter or a solitary hunterand even how it consumed its prey. The mandibles of canids are buttressed behind the carnassial teeth to enable the animals to crack bones with their post-carnassial teeth (molars M2 and M3). A study found that the mandible buttress profile of the dire wolf was lower than that of the gray wolf and the red wolf, but very similar to the coyote and the African hunting dog. The dorsoventrally weak symphyseal region (in comparison to premolars P3 and P4) of the dire wolf indicates that it delivered shallow bites similar to its modern relatives and was therefore a pack hunter. This suggests that the dire wolf may have processed bone but was not as well adapted for it as was the gray wolf. The fact that the incidence of fracture for the dire wolf reduced in frequency in the late Pleistocene to that of its modern relatives suggests that reduced competition had allowed the dire wolf to return to a <b>feeding</b> <b>behavior</b> involving a lower amount of bone consumption, a behavior for which it was best suited.|$|E

This makes it difficult for paleontologists to make definitive statements about Dicraeosauridae <b>feeding</b> <b>behavior</b> compared to diplodocid <b>feeding</b> <b>behavior.</b> However, compared to its known relatives, Dicraeosaurus is unique in that it has an equal number of teeth in the upper and lower jaw, though teeth in the lower jaw are replaced more slowly.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Behavioral coding of videotaped {{eating and}} feeding {{interactions}} can provide researchers with rich observational data and unique insights into eating behaviors, food intake, food selection {{as well as}} interpersonal and mealtime dynamics of children and their families. Unlike self-report measures of eating and feeding practices, the coding of videotaped eating and <b>feeding</b> <b>behaviors</b> can allow for the quantitative and qualitative examinations of behaviors and practices that participants may not self-report. While this methodology is increasingly more common, behavioral coding protocols and methodology are not widely shared in the literature. This {{has important implications for}} validity and reliability of coding schemes across settings. Additional guidance on how to design, implement, code and analyze videotaped eating and <b>feeding</b> <b>behaviors</b> could contribute to advancing the science of behavioral nutrition. The objectives of this narrative review are to review methodology for the design, operationalization, and coding of videotaped behavioral eating and feeding data in children and their families, and to highlight best practices. Methods When capturing eating and <b>feeding</b> <b>behaviors</b> through analysis of videotapes, {{it is important for the}} study and coding to be hypothesis driven. Study design considerations include how to best capture the target behaviors through selection of a controlled experimental laboratory environment versus home mealtime, duration of video recording, number of observations to achieve reliability across eating episodes, as well as technical issues in video recording and sound quality. Study design must also take into account plans for coding the target behaviors, which may include behavior frequency, duration, categorization or qualitative descriptors. Coding scheme creation and refinement occur through an iterative process. Reliability between coders can be challenging to achieve but is paramount to the scientific rigor of the methodology. Analysis approach is dependent on the how data were coded and collapsed. Conclusions Behavioral coding of videotaped eating and <b>feeding</b> <b>behaviors</b> can capture rich data “in-vivo” that is otherwise unobtainable from self-report measures. While data collection and coding are time-intensive the data yielded can be extremely valuable.
