5|$|Principal {{photography}} commenced on August 15, 1983. All but {{two days}} of production were filmed on Paramount soundstages, by cinematographer Charles Correll. The Search for Spock {{was one of the}} first major feature films to use Eastman 5294, a color high speed negative film stock. The film allowed Correll latitude <b>in</b> <b>choosing</b> <b>a</b> broad range of exposure indexes. Since The Search for Spock was shot with anamorphic lenses and many theatergoers would see widescreen 70mm prints, Correll needed to produce a crisp depth of field, a difficult task on many sets. For scenes on the bridge, Correll pushed the exposure index above the Eastman recommendation to keep the image crisp at less than 50foot-candles.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, the MCC was {{involved}} in controversy over the non-selection of the mixed-race cricketer Basil D'Oliveira to tour South Africa, which was then under apartheid. The South African government did not want D'Oliveira, himself South African-born, in the England team because of his colour. The MCC were aware that there was opposition to a tour taking place, and that D'Oliveira's place in the team would be an issue, but wanted the tour to go ahead. The Shadow Foreign Secretary and former MCC President Sir Alec Douglas-Home visited South Africa in January 1968 and met the South African Prime Minister B. J. Vorster, who privately did not want D'Oliveira to come to South Africa under any circumstances. Vorster suggested to Douglas-Home that the MCC should not explicitly ask whether D'Oliveira's selection would be acceptable, {{but that it was}} likely no protest would be made. Douglas-Home passed this information to the MCC and advised them not to push for an answer. They had earlier written to the South African Cricket Association to establish whether they had a free hand <b>in</b> <b>choosing</b> <b>a</b> team, but their change of strategy meant that when the official reply arrived Allen refused to take receipt of it. In his biography of D'Oliveira, Peter Oborne writes that Allen and the MCC secretary Billy Griffith wished to hide any South African reply from the full MCC Committee to avoid raising awkward questions over Vorster's intentions.|$|E

To support the research, this study uses the Technology Acceptance Model and Motivational Theory {{to understand what the}} influencing factors are related to OTR in the Brazilian context. The suggested methodology was exploratory-descriptive with a quantitative approach.

The Structural Equation Modeling technique Partial Least Squares (PLS) was used in this study to test the eight hypotheses proposed in the model. To evaluate the five variables of the research model (ease of use, perceived usefulness, perceived enjoyment, attitude and intention), the PLS evaluated the measurement and structural model of the research. As a result, five hypotheses were confirmed, and three were rejected. It can be concluded by the confirmed hypotheses is that travelers who consider OTR useful, they have attitude and intention to use it <b>in</b> <b>choosing</b> <b>an</b> accommodation...|$|R

25|$|In close-quarters {{fighting}} {{there is}} no more deadly weapon than the knife. <b>In</b> <b>choosing</b> <b>a</b> knife there are two important factors to bear in mind: balance and keenness. The hilt should fit easily in your hand, and the blade should not be so heavy that it tends to drag the hilt from your fingers in a loose grip. It is essential that the blade have a sharp stabbing point and good cutting edges, because an artery torn through (as against a clean cut) tends to contract and stop the bleeding. If a main artery is cleanly severed, the wounded man will quickly lose consciousness and die.|$|E
25|$|In {{temperate}} softwoods, there {{often is}} a marked difference between latewood and earlywood. The latewood will be denser than that formed {{early in the}} season. When examined under a microscope, the cells of dense latewood are seen to be very thick-walled and with very small cell cavities, while those formed first in the season have thin walls and large cell cavities. The strength is in the walls, not the cavities. Hence the greater the proportion of latewood, the greater the density and strength. <b>In</b> <b>choosing</b> <b>a</b> piece of pine where strength or stiffness is the important consideration, the principal thing to observe is the comparative amounts of earlywood and latewood. The width of ring is not nearly so important as the proportion {{and nature of the}} latewood in the ring.|$|E
25|$|A {{large number}} of {{additive}} processes are available. The main differences between processes are in the way layers are deposited to create parts and in the materials that are used. Each method has its own advantages and drawbacks, which is why some companies offer a choice of powder and polymer for the material used to build the object. Others sometimes use standard, off-the-shelf business paper as the build material to produce a durable prototype. The main considerations <b>in</b> <b>choosing</b> <b>a</b> machine are generally speed, costs of the 3D printer, of the printed prototype, choice and cost of the materials, and color capabilities. Printers that work directly with metals are generally expensive. However less expensive printers {{can be used to}} make a mold, which is then used to make metal parts.|$|E

25|$|The Gender Equality Bureau {{defines a}} work-life balance {{as a society}} in which an {{individual}} is not limited by his/her gender <b>in</b> <b>choosing</b> <b>a</b> fulfilling occupation that will accommodate each stage of an individual's life. Japanese workers on average have a minimum of ten work days for vacation time per year and are given zero paid public holidays, numbers that are far below any other industrialized nation except the United States. In order to ensure that Japanese workers are free to lead a healthy and affluent life in a style of their choosing while also maintaining their economic independence, the Gender Equality Bureau in 2007 recommended a variety of policies for both the public and private sector in order to increase time-off for employees. The Bureau has pushed private employers to offer flexible hours that can cater to a variety of lifestyles, such as offering child-care leave for men in order to promote the male's role in child-rearing. Government, per the Bureau's recommendation, is tasked with providing a policy structure that meets both male and female needs, hiring only companies that practice work-life balance for public contracts, and passing legislation that signifies the importance of both genders taking an active role in domestic work.|$|E

An infatuation with the already-married Australian socialite Sheila, Lady Loughborough, came to an end in April 1920 when the King, with the promise of the dukedom of York, persuaded Albert to stop seeing her. That year, he met for the first time since childhood Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, the youngest daughter of the Earl and Countess of Strathmore and Kinghorne. He became determined to marry her. She rejected his proposal twice, in 1921 and 1922, reportedly because she was reluctant to make the sacrifices necessary to become a member of the royal family.

500|$|Osden is {{depicted}} as having a strong empathetic connection with the vegetated planet visited by the explorers.

500|$|Andrée Hayum {{argues that}} the {{commissioning}} of the tondo by the Doni family helped to emphasize the [...] "secular and domestic ideals" [...] of the painting rather than seeing it as a [...] "devotional object." [...] <b>In</b> <b>choosing</b> <b>a</b> tondo as the format for the picture, Michelangelo is referencing the form’s long association with depicting the [...] "Adoration of the Magi, the Nativity, [...] the Madonna and Child." [...] Hayum also finds many allusions to Noah throughout the work. [...] She posits a referencing of the Madonna to Noah’s daughter-in-law, a sibyl, which thus makes Joseph an embodiment of Noah himself. [...] Hayum further supports this by acknowledging the direct link between Joseph and Noah as depicted in Michelangelo’s Sistine Ceiling paintings. [...] This link to Noah also gives an explanation to the nudes in the background, whose forms may have inspired the sons in the Drunkenness of Noah. [...] The allusion to the Noah story also brings up themes of baptismal water, thus giving rise to {{an interpretation of the}} nudes similar to D’Ancona’s: [...] "catechumens awaiting baptism" [...] from John the Baptist, whose [...] "isolation within a pit-like space" [...] indicates his special role as baptizer.|$|E
500|$|To {{voice the}} central {{character}} of the series, Hillenburg turned to Tom Kenny, whose career in animation had started alongside Hillenburg's on Rocko's Modern Life. Elements of Kenny's own personality were employed in further developing the character. Initially, Hillenburg {{wanted to use the}} name SpongeBoy— the character would have had no last name, and the series would have been called SpongeBoy Ahoy! However, the Nickelodeon legal department discovered— after voice acting had been completed for the original seven-minute pilot episode— that the name [...] "SpongeBoy" [...] was already in use for a mop product. A {{character of the}} same name was also already trademarked by Flaming Carrot Comics creator Bob Burden. <b>In</b> <b>choosing</b> <b>a</b> replacement name, Hillenburg felt that he still had to use the word [...] "Sponge", so that viewers would not mistake the character for a [...] "Cheese Man". He settled on the name [...] "SpongeBob". [...] "SquarePants" [...] was then chosen as a family name after Kenny saw a picture of the character and remarked, [...] "Boy, look at this sponge in square pants, thinking he can get a job in a fast food place." [...] Hillenburg loved the phrase upon hearing Kenny say it and felt that it would reinforce the character's nerdiness.|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{desertion}} problem, the Battalion's strict {{discipline and}} drilling began {{to bring the}} men into line. [...] "The awakening {{of a sense of}} pride in their training and confidence in themselves was becoming apparent," [...] Alexandre Binda writes. Around this time the regimental march was chosen, as Binda says, [...] "rather by accident than design". One of the instructors seconded from Britain, Scottish Lance-Corporal Mac Martin, developed a habit of accompanying the men's route marching with appropriate songs, played on his bagpipes. An American gospel song, When the Saints Go Marching In, became a favourite among the soldiers, and when it was omitted during a retreat ceremony in Bulawayo soon after the Battalion's formation, a representative of the men complained to the Regimental Sergeant Major Ron Reid-Daly, asking why [...] "our regimental march" [...] was not played. Reid-Daly replied simply that there was no regimental march, prompting the representative to declare the song as such to him. Angered not only by his charges' impudence <b>in</b> <b>choosing</b> <b>a</b> march for themselves, but also because he believed that their preferred tune was [...] "unimaginative", Reid-Daly consulted the Regiment's commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel J. S. Salt. To Reid-Daly's surprise, Salt sanctioned the troopers' choice, saying [...] "I rather like The Saints." [...] Soon afterwards, the Lieutenant-Colonel arranged for his battalion to be presented with a pair of a cheetah cubs as regimental mascots.|$|E
