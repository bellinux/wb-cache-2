40|$|Purpose – It is {{the purpose}} of this article to empirically test the risk {{parameters}} for larger foreign-exchange portfolios and to suggest real-world policies and procedures for the management of market risk with the aid of value at risk (VaR) methodology. The aim of this article is to fill a void in the <b>foreign-exchange</b> <b>risk</b> management literature and particularly for large portfolios that consist of long and short positions of multi-currencies of numerous developed and emerging economies. Design/methodology/approach – In this article, a constructive approach for the management of risk exposure of foreign-exchange securities is demonstrated, which takes into account proper adjustments for the illiquidity of both long and short trading/investment positions. The approach is based on the renowned concept of VaR along with the innovation of a software tool utilizing matrix-algebra and other optimization techniques. Real-world examples and reports of <b>foreign-exchange</b> <b>risk</b> management are presented for a sample of 40 distinctive countries. Findings – A number of realistic case studies are achieved with the objective of setting-up a practical framework for market risk measurement, management and control reports, in addition to the inception of a practical procedure for the calculation of optimum VaR limits structure. The attainment of the risk management techniques is assessed for both long and short proprietary trading and/or active investment positions. Practical implications – The main contribution of this article is the introduction of a practical risk approach to managing foreign-exchange exposure in large proprietary trading and active investment portfolios. Key <b>foreign-exchange</b> <b>risk</b> management methods, rules and procedures that financial entities, regulators and policymakers should consider in setting-up their <b>foreign-exchange</b> <b>risk</b> management objectives are examined and adapted to the specific needs of a model of 40 distinctive economies. Originality/value – Although a substantial literature has examined the statistical and economic meaning of VaR models, this article provides real-world techniques and optimum asset allocation strategies for large foreign-exchange portfolios in emerging and developed financial markets. This is with the objective of setting-up the basis of a methodology/procedure for the measurement, management and control of foreign-exchange exposures in the day-to-day trading and/or asset management operations.

Applying weekly data {{to investigate the}} <b>foreign-exchange</b> <b>risk</b> premium, the evidence from a multivariate GARCH model shows that the foreign-exchange excess returns are significantly correlated with economic fundamentals such as the real interest-rate differential, long-short interest-rate spread differential, and equity-premium differential. The evidence also suggests that foreign-exchange excess returns are not independent of the conditional variances of these fundamental variables, supporting the time-varying risk-premium hypothesis.

40|$|The authors {{show that}} the {{potential}} benefit to a host country of forward markets or of foreign exchange guarantees depend on the investor's country of origin and on specific characteristics of investment. They show {{this in terms of}} the effects on <b>foreign-exchange</b> <b>risks</b> and on the amount of foreign direct investment taking place. Their main lessons for foreign investors: (a) the benefits of hedging exchange risks through forward markets vary substantially, depending on the investor, the type of investment, and, for foreign direct investment (FDI), the direction of the market supplied; (b) for short lived investment or FDI targeted to the host country market, the potential for gain from forward contracts is substantial because in the short run, nominal exchange rate fluctuations tend to be larger than real exchange rate fluctuations; (c) for long-lived investments or export oriented FDI, the gains from forward contracts will be much smaller. Firms investing in long lived assets or in activities targeted to exports net natural insurance from the correlation between the nominal exchange rate and the firm's earnings in host-country currency; and (d) the evidence on exchange rate and price fluctuations between 1975 and 1991 suggests that the demand for coverage is likely to be stronger in South Asia than in Latin America. In East Asia, the evidence is mixed. Their main lessons for host country governments: (a) in the short run, if there are no private forward markets, the optimal policy for a risk-neutral host country is to provide the firm with forward contracts at the expected spot exchange rate. This government insurance has the same effects as allowing trading in forward markets. But these contracts can have fiscal consequences, as they did in Latin America; (b) forward markets do not discriminate against host country firms. Those engaged in international trade can also benefit from the presence of forward markets; and (c) in the medium run, as exchange controls are being liberalized, forward markets may be slow to develop because of participants'uncertainty about their ability to get foreign currency to cover forward commitments. In this transitional period, contracts offered by the government are likely to be the most efficient means of reassuring foreign investors. These contracts should also be make available to host-country firms during the transitional period, in order not to discriminate against domestic investors.

EXCHANGE RATE RISK MANAGEMENT: EVIDENCE FROM EAST ASIA The recent East Asian (EA) financial crisis provides a natural experiment for investigating <b>foreign-exchange</b> <b>risk</b> management by non-financial corporations. During this period, the financial crisis exposed local firms to large depreciations in exchange rates and decreased access to foreign capital. We explore the exchange rate hedging practices of firms that hedge foreign debt exposure in eight EA countries between 1996 and 1998. Our paper makes three primary contributions. First, we identify and characterize EA companies that use foreign currency derivatives. This includes documenting differences in size, domestic and foreign debt exposures, and financial characteristics. Second, we investigate the factors important in the use of foreign currency derivatives. In contrast to studies of US firms, we find limited support for existing theories of optimal hedging.

40|$|Previous work by Dumas and Solnik (1993) {{has shown}} that a CAPM which {{incorporates}} <b>foreign-exchange</b> <b>risk</b> premia (a so-called 'international CAPM') is better capable empirically of explaining the structure of worldwide rates of return than does the classic CAPM. In the specification of that test, moments of rates of return were allowed to vary over time {{in relation to a}} number of lagged 'instrumental variables'. Dumas and Solnik used instrumental variables which were endogenous or 'internal' to the financial market (lagged world market portfolio rate of return, dividend yield, bond yield, short-term rate of interest). In the present paper, I use as instruments economic variables which are 'external' to the financial market, such as leading indicators of the business cycles. This is an attempt to explain the behavior of the international stock market on the basis of economically meaningful variables which capture 'the state of the economy'. I find that the leading indicators put together by Stock and Watson (NBER working paper no. 4014, 1992) as predictors of the U. S. business cycle also predict stock returns in the U. S., Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom. These instruments lead again to a rejection of the classic CAPM and no rejection of the international CAPM. ...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to assess the degree to which Islamic banks in Brunei Darussalam use risk management practices (RMPs) and techniques in dealing with different types of risk. Design/methodology/approach – The researcher developed a questionnaire which covers six aspects in the first part: understanding risk and risk management, risk assessment and analysis (RAA), risk identification (RI), risk monitoring, credit risk analysis and RMPs. The second part consists of two questions based on an ordinal scale dealing with two topics: methods of RI and risk facing the sample banks. Findings – This study found that that the three most important types of risk that the Islamic banks in Brunei Darussalam facing are <b>foreign-exchange</b> <b>risk,</b> followed by credit risk and then operating risk. It also found that the Islamic banks are somewhat reasonably efficient in managing risk where RI and RAA are the most influencing variables in RMPs. Research limitations/implications – The paper's findings are limited to the RMPs of Islamic banks in Brunei Darussalam. Originality/value – The paper explores the RMPs of the Islamic banks in Brunei Darussalam. The results can be used as a valuable feed back for improvement of RMPs in the Islamic banks in Brunei and will be of value to those people who are interested in the Islamic banking system.

40|$|Recent {{developments}} {{in a number}} of emerging economies have heightened interest in the relationship between macroeconomic management and financial regulation, in an environment of open capital accounts and large-scale movements of private capital. The authors analyze the Turkish experience with capital flows in a macro-economy characterized by chronically high inflation and fiscal deficits. They study the relationship between capital flows, macroeconomic management, and vulnerability in the financial system. Their analysis highlights the importance of fiscal policy in an era of large capital flows. Fiscal imbalances contributed both to real exchange rate appreciation and high real interest rates in Turkey. The high interest rates the government must pay on domestic debt have become one of the key issues of Turkey's macroeconomic management. Only by reducing its interest expenses can fiscal deficits be reduced and greater stability be achieved. The Turkishbanking system, in becoming increasingly integrated with international financial markets, has become vulnerable to shifts in market confidence. Banks borrowed abroad in response to macroeconomic imbalances to benefit from high interest rates on domestic loans and government paper. In the process, the banks have exposed themselves to interest rate risk, to <b>foreign-exchange</b> <b>risk,</b> and to large credit risks. To reduce the Turkish economy's vulnerability to external shocks, financial regulation must be strengthened simultaneously with the achievement of macroeconomic stability.

Instead, we find that firms use foreign earnings as a substitute for hedging with derivatives and evidence that EA firms engage in "selective" hedging. Third, we investigate the relative performance of hedgers during and after the crisis. We find no evidence that EA firms eliminate their foreign exchange exposure by using derivatives. More specifically, firms using derivatives prior to the crisis perform just as poorly as nonhedgers during the crisis. Post-crisis, firms that hedged performed somewhat better than nonhedgers, but this result appears to be explained by a larger post-crisis currency exposure for hedgers (an exchange rate risk premium), due to limited access to derivatives during that period...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the management of <b>foreign-exchange</b> <b>risk.</b> We take the perspective of a domestic firm that is exposed to foreign currencies (such as the GBP, CHF, and JPY) operating in a member country of the Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC). Three important questions are involved in hedging: (i) to hedge or not; (ii) the choice of the hedging instrument; and (iii) measurement of the hedge ratio. Our results show that there is no difference in performance and risk under these three hedging strategies (always to hedge, to hedge or not to hedge, and always not to hedge) for all of the GCC currencies against foreign currencies. Our examination of the effectiveness of three financial hedging techniques&mdash;forward hedging, money-market hedging and cross-currency hedging&mdash;shows that it makes no difference whether we use forward hedging or money-market hedging (for all of the GCC currencies against foreign currencies). However, in relation to cross-currency hedging, the results are mixed. We find that the effectiveness of cross-currency hedging depends on the correlation between the exchange rates of the base currency against the exposure currency, and the currency used as the hedging instrument. In examining the effectiveness of financial hedging (such as forward hedging) versus operational hedging, (such as risk-sharing arrangements, currency collars, and hybrid arrangements) we find that forward hedging is more effective than either risk-sharing arrangements or hybrid arrangements. However, when compared with currency collars, the results are mixed. Finally, we find that the use of different econometric models to estimate the hedge ratio fails either to add value or improve the effectiveness of the hedge. This implies that {{there is no need for}} a sophisticated econometric model to estimate the hedge ratio, because what matters is correlation...|$|E
