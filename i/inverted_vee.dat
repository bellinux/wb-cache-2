50|$|Elevating the antennas higher {{above ground}} {{somewhat}} resolves the disparity, but considering the practical, legal and financial limits which influence most antenna installations, the <b>inverted</b> <b>vee</b> will be observably inferior in performance to a dipole by 1 to 2 S-units. However, if space is limited, an <b>inverted</b> <b>vee</b> may permit operation on frequencies {{that would not}} be possible with a full-sized dipole.|$|E

5000|$|An <b>inverted</b> <b>vee</b> antenna {{is a type}} of antenna {{similar to}} a {{horizontal}} dipole, but with the two sides bent down towards the ground, typically creating a 120 or 90 degree angle between the dipole legs. It is typically used in areas of limited space as it can significantly reduce the ground foot print of the antenna without significantly impacting performance. Viewed from the side, it looks like the English letter [...] "V" [...] turned upside down, hence the name. <b>Inverted</b> <b>vee</b> antennas are commonly used by amateur radio stations, and aboard sailing vessels requiring better HF performance than available with a short whip antenna. <b>Inverted</b> <b>vee</b> antennas are horizontal polarized and have a similar pattern compared to a traditional horizontal dipole.|$|E
50|$|However, in practice, ground {{proximity}} {{and ground}} conductivity {{as well as}} end effects reduce {{the efficiency of the}} <b>inverted</b> <b>vee</b> considerably compared to the dipole: In the 40-foot example above, considering a useful take-off angle of 40 degrees above the horizon, the <b>inverted</b> <b>vee</b> produces a maximum gain of 1 dBi in a circular pattern, whereas the dipole produces an oval pattern ranging from 6 dBi toward the sides down to 1.2 dBi toward the ends.|$|E
50|$|In theory, {{the gain}} of an <b>inverted</b> <b>vee</b> {{is similar to}} that of a dipole at the same {{elevation}} because most of the radiation is from the high-current portion of the antenna, which is near the center. Since the center of both antennas are the same height, there is little difference in performance. Antenna modeling software bears this out for free-space models, predicting maximum gain of 2.15 dBi for the dipole and 1.9 dBi for the <b>inverted</b> <b>vee.</b>|$|E

50|$|Typically, the <b>inverted</b> <b>vee</b> antenna {{requires}} only a single, tall support at the center, and the ends can be insulated and secured to anchors near ground level {{or near the}} roof if mounted on a house. This simplified arrangement has several advantages, including a shorter ground distance between the ends. For example, a dipole antenna for the 80 meter band requires a ground length of about 140 ft from end to end. An <b>inverted</b> <b>vee</b> with a 40 ft apex elevation {{requires only}} 115 ft. For radio amateurs living on small parcels of property, such savings can {{make it possible to}} use the lower frequency amateur bands.|$|E

50|$|The Buzzard was a single-seat {{ultralight}} {{of wooden}} construction, fitted with split flaps and an all-flying tailplane, and {{powered by a}} 35 hp Anzani <b>inverted</b> <b>Vee</b> air-cooled engine. The Buzzard was designed by C.H. Latimer-Needham, and built by Luton Aircraft at Barton-in-the-Clay, Bedfordshire in 1936. The only Buzzard, registered G-ADYX and designated the Buzzard I first flew in 1936. On 16 November 1936, it was damaged during landing at Christchurch, Hampshire.|$|E
5000|$|In 1934, when Geoffrey de Havilland {{needed a}} more {{powerful}} engine for his twin-engined transport aircraft, the four-cylinder Gipsy Major was further developed into the 200 hp six-cylinder Gipsy Six. In 1937 even more power was needed for the new D.H.91 Albatross four-engined transatlantic mailplane, and so two Gipsy Six cylinder banks were combined to form one [...] Gipsy Twelve 12-cylinder <b>inverted</b> <b>Vee.</b> In military service, the Gipsy Twelve {{became known as the}} Gipsy King and the Gipsy Six the Gipsy Queen.|$|E
50|$|The MS.315 was {{developed}} from the earlier MS.300 primary trainer and related variants and first flew in October 1932. The MS.315 is a parasol-wing monoplane with a tailwheel, with divided main landing gear, and powered by a 135 hp (101 kW) Salmson 9Nc radial engine. A production run of 346 aircraft followed the four prototypes (including 33 built after the Second World War). Five high-powered MS.317/2 variants were also produced for the civil market, and a single MS.316 was built, powered by a RÃ©gnier <b>inverted</b> <b>Vee</b> engine.|$|E

5000|$|In practice, {{the large}} {{physical}} size of antennas at this frequency (a quarter-wave vertical, for example, is approximately 65 feet/20 meters high) {{and the difficulty}} of ensuring significant low angle radiation from antennas to maximize the distance of [...] "hops" [...] are two of the challenges facing amateurs wishing to communicate over longer distances. Most amateurs interested in regional communication use low, wire antennas, such as horizontal dipoles, <b>inverted</b> <b>vee</b> dipole antennas or loop antennas on this band. Horizontally polarized antennas, when close to earth, produce predominantly high-angle radiation. High angles are useful for Near Vertical Incidence Skywave and other short distance propagation modes, but substantial distance can still be covered even with modest height antennas.|$|E
5000|$|The US {{military}} services adopted a common aircraft designation scheme in 1962, and the DASH variants were given new designations. The DSN-1 became the [...] "QH-50A", the DSN-2 became the [...] "QH-50B", and the DSN-3 became the [...] "QH-50C". The general configuration {{of all three}} of the DASH prototype variants was similar, though the QH-50C was scaled up, with an empty weight almost twice that of the QH-50A. The QH-50C was an ugly little machine that was reminiscent of an insect. It had a frame made of steel tubing, with all machinery directly accessible, and stood on twin skids, with one or two homing torpedoes or nuclear depth charges carried between the skids. It had a coaxial rotor system and a dropdown <b>inverted</b> <b>vee</b> tail.|$|E

For the first time in WRTC history, both operators were allowed to transmit simultaneously, as in a [...] "Multioperator, Two-Transmitter" [...] (M/2) competition, providing more opportunity for participants around the world to work the competitors on as many bands as possible.

Various version of these steel framed Sea Sleds were used by both the US Navy and Army as rescue boats starting in 1913 up through the Second World War.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} is unlimited. This thesis investigates {{the performance of}} various configurations of tactical High Frequency (HF) field deployable antennas {{in the presence of}} lossy earth. Antennas investigated include horizontal dipoles, short sloping wires, inverted vees, and monopoles with buried and elevated radials. Numerical models of the antennas are exercised via the Numerical Electromagnetic Code (NEC) for radiation pattern performance. Antennas are analyzed for applicability to (1) short-range Near Vertical Incident Skywave (NVIS), where high elevation radiation angles are required, (2) medium- and long-range low radiation angle use, and (3) vertically polarized low-angle radiation for ground wave communication. Good NVIS and ground wave performance occurs for horizontal dipoles. Sloping wires and sloping dipoles are similar to horizontal dipoles but exhibit a moderate amount of azimuth plane directivity. Vertical monopoles with at least 15 buried radials produce medium- and long-range skyware coverage and good ground wave performance. Four elevated radials for quarter-wavelength monopoles are shown to out-perform 15 buried radials and are much easier to erect. The larger and more difficult-to-erect <b>inverted</b> <b>vee</b> dipole slightly outperforms a monopole by virtue of modest azimuth plane directivity. The results of this study can be included in an antenna engineering handbook and can be used to interface with existing ionospheric propagation codes in order to obtain optimum communication effectiveness.
