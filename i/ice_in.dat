5|$|A further {{survey of}} the graves was {{undertaken}} in 1986. A camera crew filmed the procedure, shown in Novas television documentary, Buried in <b>Ice</b> <b>in</b> 1988. Under difficult field conditions, Derek Notman, a radiologist and medical doctor from the University of Minnesota, and radiology technician Larry Anderson took many X-rays of the crewmen prior to autopsy. Barbara Schweger, an Arctic clothing specialist, and Roger Amy, a pathologist, assisted in the investigation.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{spectral}} evidence, Hygiea's {{surface is}} thought to consist of primitive carbonaceous materials {{similar to those found}} in carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. Aqueous alteration products have been detected on its surface, which could indicate the presence of water <b>ice</b> <b>in</b> the past which was heated sufficiently to melt. The primitive present surface composition would indicate that Hygiea had not been melted during the early period of Solar System formation, in contrast to other large planetesimals like 4 Vesta.|$|E
5|$|In 1850, California was in {{the midst}} of a gold rush; backed by this sudden demand for luxuries, New England {{companies}} made the first shipments, by ship to San Francisco and Sacramento, in California, including a shipment of refrigerated apples. The market was proved, but shipping <b>ice</b> <b>in</b> this way was expensive and demand outstripped supply. Ice began to be ordered instead from the then Russian-controlled Alaska in 1851 at $75 a ton (901kg). The American-Russian Commercial Company was subsequently formed in San Francisco in 1853 to work in partnership with the Russian-American Company of Alaska to supply ice to the west coast of America. The Russian company trained Aleutian teams to harvest <b>ice</b> <b>in</b> Alaska, built saw-mills to produce insulating saw-dust and shipped the ice south along with supplies of chilled fish. The costs of this operation remained high and M. Tallman founded the rival Nevada Ice Company, which harvested ice on Pilot Creek and transported to Sacramento, bringing the west coast price for ice down to seven cents ($2) a pound (0.5kg).|$|E

5|$|In 2005, radar data {{revealed}} {{the presence of}} large quantities of water ice at the poles and at mid-latitudes. The Mars rover Spirit sampled chemical compounds containing water molecules in March 2007. The Phoenix lander directly sampled water <b>ice</b> <b>in</b> shallow Martian soil on July 31, 2008. On September 28, 2015, NASA announced the presence of briny flowing salt water on the Martian surface.|$|E
5|$|On April 25, 2007, the AIM {{satellite}} (Aeronomy of <b>Ice</b> <b>in</b> the Mesosphere) was launched. It is {{the first}} satellite dedicated to studying noctilucent clouds, and made its first observations on May 25, 2007.

With the increased attendance and interest for hockey following the town's team playing in the top league, Storhamar started planning an indoor venue.|$|E

5|$|The Norwegian trade peaked {{during the}} 1890s, {{with a million}} tons (900 million kg) of ice was being {{exported}} from Norway by 1900; the major Leftwich company in Britain, importing much of this, kept a thousand tons (900,000kg) of <b>ice</b> <b>in</b> store at all times to meet demand. Austria entered the European ice market behind Norway, with the Vienna Ice Company exporting natural ice to Germany {{by the end of}} the century.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two main}} {{hypotheses}} regarding {{the origin of the}} rings. One hypothesis is that the rings are remnants of a destroyed moon of Saturn. The second hypothesis is that the rings are left over from the original nebular material from which Saturn formed. Some <b>ice</b> <b>in</b> the E ring comes from the moon Enceladus's geysers.|$|E
5|$|Data {{from the}} Aeronomy of <b>Ice</b> <b>in</b> the Mesosphere {{satellite}} suggests that noctilucent clouds require water vapour, dust, and very cold temperatures to form. The sources {{of both the}} dust and the water vapour in the upper atmosphere are not known with certainty. The dust is believed to come from micrometeors, although particulates from volcanoes and dust from the troposphere are also possibilities. The moisture could be lifted through gaps in the tropopause, as well as forming from the reaction of methane with hydroxyl radicals in the stratosphere.|$|E

5|$|Despite this setback, the {{expedition}} continued with Wild in command while Hussey returned to England with Shackleton's body. On 22 January, Worsley suffered a serious accident. Under sail, the Quest had been rolling heavily and ropes securing a lifeboat snapped. The lifeboat, full of stores, swung against the wheelhouse and crushed Worsley against the bridge. He broke several ribs {{and had to}} rest for several days. By the end of March, after being briefly trapped in <b>ice</b> <b>in</b> the Weddell Sea, the ship reached Elephant Island. The expedition then returned to South Georgia, where Hussey was waiting. Shackleton's widow had directed that he be buried on South Georgia and Hussey {{had returned to the}} island in late February to fulfil her request.|$|E
5|$|During the {{southern}} party's absence the relief ship Morning arrived, bringing fresh supplies. The expedition's organisers {{had assumed that}} the Discovery would be free from the <b>ice</b> <b>in</b> early 1903, enabling Scott to carry out further seaborne exploration and survey work before winter set in. It was intended that Discovery would return to New Zealand in March or April, then home to England via the Pacific, continuing its magnetic survey en route. Morning would provide any assistance that Scott might require during this period.|$|E
5|$|Except for water, {{the only}} other {{compound}} identified {{on the surface of}} Titania by infrared spectroscopy is carbon dioxide, which is concentrated mainly on the trailing hemisphere. The origin of the carbon dioxide is not completely clear. It might be produced locally from carbonates or organic materials {{under the influence of the}} solar ultraviolet radiation or energetic charged particles coming from the magnetosphere of Uranus. The latter process would explain the asymmetry in its distribution, because the trailing hemisphere is subject to a more intense magnetospheric influence than the leading hemisphere. Another possible source is the outgassing of the primordial CO2 trapped by water <b>ice</b> <b>in</b> Titania's interior. The escape of CO2 from the interior may be related to the past geological activity on this moon.|$|E

Gracehope was formed hundreds of years ago by a group called the Settlers who used to live in England. They possessed unusual abilities, such as extremely good vision and hearing, leading them to be called 'eye adepts' and 'ear adepts', respectively. These powers were seen as sorcery, prompting Grace, the leader of the Settlers, to bring the Settlers under the <b>ice</b> <b>in</b> Greenland where they could live in peace.|$|E
5|$|Henry McNish (11 September 187424 September 1930), often {{referred}} to as Harry McNeish or by the nickname Chippy, was the carpenter on Sir Ernest Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition of 1914–1917. He was responsible for much of the work that ensured the crew's survival after their ship, the Endurance, was destroyed when it became trapped in pack <b>ice</b> <b>in</b> the Weddell Sea. He modified the small boat, James Caird, that allowed Shackleton and five men (including McNish) to make a voyage of hundreds of miles to fetch help {{for the rest of the}} crew.|$|E
5|$|In October 1915 pack <b>ice</b> <b>in</b> the Weddell Sea {{had sunk}} Endurance, leaving Shackleton {{and his companions}} adrift on a {{precarious}} ice surface.

They then made their way in the ship's lifeboats to Elephant Island, where Shackleton decided that {{the most effective means}} of obtaining rescue would be to sail one of the lifeboats to South Georgia.|$|E
