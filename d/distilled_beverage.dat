25|$|Anthony Bopp (1983) {{proposed}} that kerosene, a low-quality fuel used in home heating, was a Giffen good. Schmuel Baruch and Yakar Kanai (2001) suggested that shochu, a Japanese <b>distilled</b> <b>beverage,</b> {{might be a}} Giffen good. In both cases, the authors offered supporting econometric evidence. However, the empirical evidence has been generally considered incomplete. In a 2005 article, Sasha Abramsky of The Nation conjectured that gasoline, in certain circumstances, may act as a Giffen good. However, no supporting evidence was offered, and evidence from the large increases in oil prices in 2008 would suggest that quantity demanded for gasoline did actually fall {{as a result of}} increased prices. Of course, the lack of evidence at the aggregate level does not rule out that the proposed goods may have been Giffen for certain groups of consumers—in particular for poor consumers.|$|E
500|$|The Whiskey Rebellion (also {{known as}} the Whiskey Insurrection) was a tax protest in the United States {{beginning}} in 1791 during the presidency of George Washington. The so-called [...] "whiskey tax" [...] was the first tax imposed on a domestic product by the newly formed federal government. It became law in 1791, and was intended to generate revenue for the war debt incurred during the Revolutionary War. [...] The tax applied to all distilled spirits, but American whiskey {{was by far the}} country's most popular <b>distilled</b> <b>beverage</b> in the 18th century, so the excise became widely known as a [...] "whiskey tax". Farmers of the western frontier were accustomed to distilling their surplus rye, barley, wheat, corn, or fermented grain mixtures into whiskey. These farmers resisted the tax. In these regions, whiskey often served as a medium of exchange. Many of the resisters were war veterans who believed that they were fighting for the principles of the American Revolution, in particular against taxation without local representation, while the federal government maintained that the taxes were the legal expression of Congressional taxation powers.|$|E
500|$|A {{source of}} {{government}} revenue {{was needed to}} pay the respectable amount due to the previous bondholders to whom the debt was owed. By December 1790, Hamilton believed that import duties, which were the government's primary source of revenue, had been raised as high as feasible. He therefore promoted passage of an excise tax on domestically produced distilled spirits. This {{was to be the}} first tax levied by the national government on a domestic product. Whiskey was by far the most popular <b>distilled</b> <b>beverage</b> in late 18th-century America, so the excise became known as the [...] "whiskey tax." [...] Taxes were politically unpopular, and Hamilton believed that the whiskey excise was a luxury tax and would be the least objectionable tax that the government could levy. In this, he had the support of some social reformers, who hoped that a [...] "sin tax" [...] would raise public awareness about the harmful effects of alcohol. The whiskey excise act, sometimes known as the [...] "Whiskey Act", became law in March 1791. George Washington defined the revenue districts, appointed the revenue supervisors and inspectors, and set their pay in November 1791.|$|E

2500|$|In Germany, a cheap {{substitute}} for genuine dark rum is called Rum-Verschnitt (literally: blended or [...] "cut" [...] rum). This <b>distilled</b> <b>beverage</b> {{is made of}} genuine dark rum (often from Jamaica), rectified spirit, and water. Very often, caramel coloring is used, too. The relative amount of genuine rum it contains can be quite low, since the legal minimum is at only 5%. In Austria, a similar rum called Inländerrum or domestic rum is available. However, Austrian Inländerrum is always a spiced rum, such as the brand Stroh; German Rum-Verschnitt, in contrast, is never spiced or flavored.|$|E
