50|$|Altogether, genetic {{studies suggest}} that African Americans are a multiracial people. According to DNA {{analysis}} led in 2006 by Penn State geneticist Mark D. Shriver, around 58 percent of African Americans have at least 12.5% European ancestry (equivalent to one European <b>great-grandparent</b> and his/her forebears), 19.6 percent of African Americans have at least 25% European ancestry (equivalent to one European grandparent and his/her forebears), and 1 percent of African Americans have at least 50% European ancestry (equivalent to one European parent and his/her forebears). According to Shriver, around 5 percent of African Americans also have at least 12.5% Native American ancestry (equivalent to one Native American <b>great-grandparent</b> and his/her forebears).|$|R
50|$|For lineal ancestors, {{this can}} be {{approximated}} by 10th degree consanguinity. The reason this is approximate, and not exact, is that common ancestry is halved every time the degree of consanguinity is increased by one. For example the degree of consanguinity of a parent is one. This means that a parent provides 1/21 or 1/2 of a persons ancestry (the other parent provides the other half). A 7th <b>great-grandparent</b> has a 9th degree consanguinity, and therefore providing 1/29 or 1/512 common ancestry. An 8th <b>great-grandparent</b> provides 1/1024 common ancestry which {{is as close as}} one can come to 1/1000, and so this is the cut-off used.|$|R
50|$|Many African Americans {{believe they}} have some Native American ancestry. But, in the PBS series led by {{historian}} Henry Louis Gates, Jr., called African American Lives, geneticists said DNA evidence shows that African-Native American admixture is relatively rare. Gates summarized the data:Only 5 percent of African Americans have at least one-eighth Native American ancestry (equivalent to one <b>great-grandparent).</b> On the other hand, nearly 78 percent of African Americans have at least one-eighth European ancestry (the equivalent to a <b>great-grandparent),</b> and nearly 20 percent have at least one-quarter European ancestry (the equivalent to a grandparent.)Historian Sherrel Wheeler Stewart says that most African Americans have Native American ancestry.|$|R
