5000|$|In Drosophila melanogaster, the GSC niche {{resides in}} the anterior-most region of each ovariole, known as the germarium. The GSC niche {{consists}} of necessary somatic cells-terminal filament cells, cap cells, escort cells, and other stem cells which function to maintain the GSCs. The GSC niche holds on average 2-3 GSCs, which are directly attached to somatic cap cells and Escort stem cells, which send maintenance signals directly to the GSCs. [...] GSCs are easily identified through histological staining against vasa protein (to identify germ cells) and 1B1 protein (to outline cell structures and a germline specific <b>fusome</b> structure). Their physical attachment to the cap cells is necessary for their maintenance and activity. A GSC will divide asymmetrically to produce one daughter cystoblast, which then undergoes 4 rounds of incomplete mitosis as it progresses down the ovariole (through the process of oogenesis) eventually emerging as a mature egg chamber; the <b>fusome</b> found in the GSCs functions in cyst formation and may regulate asymmetrical cell divisions of the GSCs. [...] Because of the abundant genetic tools available for use in Drosophila melanogaster and the ease of detecting GSCs through histological stainings, researchers have uncovered several molecular pathways controlling GSC maintenance and activity.|$|E

The ovaries {{are composed of}} approximately 40 ovarioles, showing non-synchronic oocyte maturation. The terminal filament with clusters of undifferentiated cells was found at the distal end of the ovarioles. Next to this region is the germarium, composed of several elongated cystocytes interconnected by cytoplasmic bridges. The nurse cells (23 - 28 cells) result from asymmetric mitosis. Cytoskeleton analysis showed F-actin concentrated at the muscle cells of the external tunica and in <b>fusomes</b> inside the ovarioles. Microtubules were concentrated around the nuclei of the nurse and follicular cells. In contrast, the oocytes and the external tunica showed faint staining for tubulin.

40|$|In {{many social}} {{hymenopteran}} species, workers possess functional ovaries that are physiologically inactive {{in the presence}} of queens. We investigated the ovarian regulatory mechanism of workers and reproductives in a queenless ponerine ant, Diacamma, using histological and molecular techniques. In this ant, clear reproductive differentiation occurs via a highly sophisticated dominance behavioral interaction called "gemmae mutilation". This clear and rapid bifurcation of reproductive physiology allows us to elucidate the detailed ovarian differentiation process. Histological characteristics of functional ovaries (<b>fusomes</b> and ring canals) were found in both workers and reproductives, suggesting that early oogenesis is not blocked in workers. Since insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling (IIS) is known to control insect reproduction, orthologs of 2 positive Its regulators, insulin receptor and serine-threonine kinase Akt (protein kinase B), were cloned in Diacamma (DiaInR, DiaAkt); their expression patterns during reproductive differentiation were examined by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction; DiaInR and DiaAkt were strongly expressed in the gasters of reproductives. Whole-mount in situ hybridization of ovaries indicated that DiaInR and DiaAkt were expressed in nurse cells, oocytes, and upper germarial regions of reproductives but not of workers. Our data suggest that the IIS pathway accounts for reproductive differentiation in late oogenesis...|$|R
40|$|The Drosophila <b>fusome</b> is a germ cell-specific {{organelle}} assembled from membrane skeletal {{proteins and}} membranous vesicles. Mutational {{studies that have}} examined inactivating alleles of <b>fusome</b> proteins indicate that the organelle plays central roles in germ cell differentiation. Although mutations in genes encoding skeletal <b>fusome</b> components prevent proper cyst formation, mutations in the bag-of-marbles gene disrupt the assembly of membranous cisternae within the <b>fusome</b> and block cystoblast differentiation altogether. To {{understand the relationship between}} <b>fusome</b> cisternae and cystoblast differentiation, we have begun to identify other proteins in this network of <b>fusome</b> tubules. In this article we present evidence that the fly homologue of the transitional endoplasmic reticulum ATPase (TER 94) is one such protein. The presence of TER 94 suggests that the <b>fusome</b> cisternae grow by vesicle fusion and are a germ cell modification of endoplasmic reticulum. We also show that <b>fusome</b> association of TER 94 is Bam-dependent, suggesting that cystoblast differentiation may be linked to <b>fusome</b> reticulum biogenesis...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackground: During Drosophila {{oogenesis}} a membranous organelle {{called the}} <b>fusome</b> has a key {{function in the}} establishment of oocyte fate and polarity, ultimately leading to the establishment of the major body axes of the animal. The <b>fusome</b> is necessary for the microtubule-driven restriction of markers of oocyte fate to the oocyte, but the mechanism by which the <b>fusome</b> organizes the microtubules is not known. Results: We have identified the spectraplakin Short stop (Shot) as a new component of the <b>fusome.</b> Spectraplakins are giant cytoskeletal linker proteins, with multiple isoforms produced from each gene. Shot is the sole spectraplakin in Drosophila. The phenotype caused by the absence of Shot is not similar to that of other components of the <b>fusome</b> but instead is similar to the absence of the downstream components that interact with microtubules: the dynein/dynactin-complex-associated proteins Egalitarian and BicaudalD. Shot is required for the association of microtubules with the <b>fusome</b> and the subsequent specification of the oocyte in 16 -cell cysts. Shot is also required for the concentration of centrosomes into the oocyte, a process thought to be independent of microtubules because it still occurs in the presence of microtubule depolymerizing drugs. This suggests that Shot may protect some microtubules from depolymerization and that these microtubules are sufficient for this process. Conclusions: Shot provides the missing link between the <b>fusome</b> and microtubules within meiotic cysts, which is essential for the establishment of the oocyte. Shot associates with the <b>fusome</b> and is required for microtubule organization. We suggest that it does this directly, via its microtubule binding GAS 2 domain...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe <b>fusome</b> {{plays an}} {{essential}} role in prefollicular germ cell development within insects such as Drosophila melanogaster. Alpha-spectrin and the adducin-like protein Hu-li tai shao (Hts) are required to maintain <b>fusome</b> integrity, synchronize asymmetric cystocyte mitoses, form interconnected 16 -cell germline cysts, and specify the initial cell as the oocyte. By screening a library of protein trap lines, we identified 14 new fusome-enriched proteins, including many associated with its characteristic vesicles. Our studies reveal that fusomes change during development and contain recycling endosomal and lysosomal compartments in females but not males. A significant number of <b>fusome</b> components are dispensable, because genetic disruption of tropomodulin, ferritin- 1 heavy chain, or scribble, does not alter <b>fusome</b> structure or female fertility. In contrast, rab 11 is required to maintain the germline stem cells, and to maintain the vesicle content of the spectrosome, suggesting that the <b>fusome</b> mediates intercellular signals that depend on the recycling endosome...|$|E
40|$|In {{addition}} to their well-known effects {{on the development of}} the mushroom body, mud mutants are also female sterile. Here we show that, although the early steps of ovary development are grossly normal, a defect becomes apparent in meiosis II when the two component spindles fail to cohere and align properly. The products of meiosis are consequently mispositioned within the egg and, with or without fertilization, soon undergo asynchronous and spatially disorganized replication. In wild-type eggs, Mud is found associated with the central spindle pole body that lies between the two spindles of meiosis II. The mutant defect thus implies that Mud should be added to the short list of components that are required for the formation and/or stability of this structure. Mud protein is also normally found in association with other structures during egg development: at the spindle poles of meiosis I, at the spindle poles of early cleavage and syncytial embryos, in the rosettes formed from the unfertilized products of meiosis, with the <b>fusomes</b> and spectrosomes that anchor the spindles of dividing cystoblasts, and at the nuclear rim of the developing oocyte. In contrast to its important role at the central spindle pole body, in none of these cases is it clear that Mud plays an essential role. But the commonalities in its location suggest potential roles for the protein in development of other tissues...|$|R
40|$|As {{key factors}} in {{intercellular}} adhesion processes, cadherins play {{important roles in}} a plethora of developmental processes, including gametogenesis. In a previous study on cadherin localization in the gonads of honey bees, performed with heterologous pan-cadherin antibodies, we detected these proteins as (i) associated with cell membranes, (ii) as homogeneously distributed throughout the cytoplasm, and (iii) as nuclear foci in both somatic and germline cells, raising the possibility of alternative functions. To further investigate such unusual intracellular cadherin localization we produced specific antibodies against the N- and C-terminal domains of honey bee N- and E-cadherin. A 160 kDa protein was recognized by the E-cadherin antibodies {{as well as one}} of approximately 300 kDa from those raised against N-cadherin. In gonad preparations, both proteins were detected as dispersed throughout the cytoplasm and as nuclear foci in both germline and somatic cells of queen and worker ovarioles, {{as well as in the}} testioles of drones. This leads us to infer that cadherins may indeed be involved in certain signaling pathways and/or transcriptional regulation during gametogenesis. In late oogenesis stages, immunolabeling for both proteins was observed at the cell cortex, in conformity with a role in cell adhesion. In testioles, E-cadherin was seen in co-localization with <b>fusomes,</b> indicating a possible role in cyst organization. Taken together, the distribution of N- and E-cadherins in honey bee gonads is suggestive of alternative roles for cadherins in gametogenesis of both sexes...|$|R
40|$|Specialized microenvironments called niches keep {{stem cells}} in an {{undifferentiated}} and self-renewing state. Dedicated stromal cells form niches by producing {{a variety of}} factors that act directly on stem cells. The size and signaling output of niches must be finely tuned to ensure proper tissue homeostasis. Although advances have been made in identifying factors that promote niche cell fate, the mechanisms that restrict niche cell formation during development and limit niche signaling output in adults remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the histone lysine-specific demethylase 1 (Lsd 1) regulates the size of the germline stem cell (GSC) niche in Drosophila ovaries. GSC maintenance depends on bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signals produced by a small cluster of cap cells located at the anterior tip of the germarium. Lsd 1 null mutant ovaries carry small germline tumors containing an expanded number of GSC-like cells with round <b>fusomes</b> that display ectopic BMP signal responsiveness away from the normal niche. Clonal analysis and cell type-specific rescue experiments demonstrate that Lsd 1 functions within the escort cells (ECs) that reside immediately adjacent to cap cells and prevents them from ectopically producing niche-specific signals. Temporally restricted gene knockdown experiments suggest that Lsd 1 functions both during development, to specify EC fate, and in adulthood, to prevent ECs from forming ectopic niches independent of changes in cell fate. Further analysis shows that Lsd 1 functions to repress decapentaplegic (dpp) expression in adult germaria. The role of Lsd 1 in regulating niche-specific signals may have important implications for understanding how disruption of its mammalian homolog contributes to cancer and metastasis...|$|R
40|$|In most animal species, {{female and}} male gametes are {{produced}} within clusters of germ cells which share a common cytoplasm through cell-cell channels. In Drosophila ovaries, these cells synchronise their divisions and specialise one cell of the cluster as the future egg. Both processes are organised by a germline-specific organelle of communication called the <b>fusome.</b> Until recently, the <b>fusome</b> has remained largely mysterious despite a hundred years of research on its composition, formation and functions. Novel results have now suggested several molecular mechanisms {{to explain how the}} <b>fusome</b> synchronises the divisions by controlling cell-cycle regulators and how it determines and polarises the future egg by organising the microtubule cytoskeleton. Importantly, a structure similar to the <b>fusome</b> has been identified during Xenopus oogenesis, suggesting that it is widely conserved from invertebrates to vertebrates, and that it thus serves an essential function...|$|E
40|$|Orbit, a Drosophila {{ortholog}} of microtubule plus-end enriched protein CLASP, {{plays an}} important role in many developmental processes involved in microtubule dynamics. Previous studies have shown that Orbit is required for asymmetric stem cell division and cystocyte divisions in germline cysts and for the development of microtubule networks that interconnect oocyte and nurse cells during oogenesis. Here, we examined the cellular localization of Orbit and its role in cyst formation during spermatogenesis. In male germline stem cells, distinct localization of Orbit was first observed on the spectrosome, which is a spherical precursor of the germline-specific cytoskeleton known as the <b>fusome.</b> In dividing stem cells and spermatogonia, Orbit was localized around centrosomes and on kinetochores and spindle microtubules. After cytokinesis, Orbit remained localized on ring canals, which are cytoplasmic bridges between the cells. Thereafter, it was found along fusomes, extending through the ring canal toward all spermatogonia in a cyst. <b>Fusome</b> localization of Orbit was not affected by microtubule depolymerization. Instead, our fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments suggested that Orbit is closely associated with F-actin, which is abundantly found in fusomes. Surprisingly, F-actin depolymerization influenced neither <b>fusome</b> organization nor Orbit localization on the germline-specific cytoskeleton. We revealed that two conserved regions of Orbit are required for <b>fusome</b> localization. Using orbit hypomorphic mutants, we showed that the protein is required for ring canal formation and for <b>fusome</b> elongation mediated by the interaction of newly generate...|$|E
40|$|AbstractKLP 61 F in Drosophila is {{a member}} of the BimC family of kinesins and, as for other family members [1], is {{required}} for spindle assembly [2, 3]. KLP 61 F is a bipolar homotetramer that cross-links spindle microtubules [4]. It is not known, however, whether the function of KLP 61 F is dedicated to mitosis or whether KLP 61 F interacts exclusively with microtubules. Previous work suggested that KLP 61 F functions during interphase in proliferating germ cells [3]. Cytokinesis is incomplete in germ cells and a branched cortical structure known as a <b>fusome</b> extrudes through intercellular bridges called ring canals. Here I show that, in germ cells, KLP 61 F cycles between spindles during mitosis and fusomes during interphase. Inspection of fusome-deficient hu-li tai shao (hts) mutants indicated that KLP 61 F gains fusome-dependent interactions near telophase that mediate its incorporation into these structures. KLP 61 F proved to be maintained in fusomes by microtubule-independent, detergent-resistant interactions. Inspection of KLP 61 F mutants indicated that KLP 61 F is required to recruit <b>fusome</b> material to spindle midbodies near telophase and for normal <b>fusome</b> organization. These observations suggest that KLP 61 F is bifunctional in germ cells, with microtubule-dependent functions in spindle assembly and microtubule-independent functions in <b>fusome</b> organization. Cytological analyses with antibodies against phosphorylated Eg 5 peptide [4] suggest that cycling of KLP 61 F might reflect phosphorylation...|$|E
40|$|Chromatin {{condensation}} is {{a typical}} feature of sperm cells. During mammalian spermiogenesis, histones are first replaced by transition proteins and then by protamines, while little is known for Drosophila. Here I characterize three male specific genes in the fly genome, Mst 35 Ba, Mst 35 Bb and Mst 77 F. With eGFP fusion for these above mentioned proteins, I show here that Mst 35 Ba and Mst 35 Bb indeed encode for dProtA (Drosophila ProtamineA) and dProtB (Drosophila ProtamineB), respectively and show 94 % identity to each other. Drosophila protamines are considerably larger than mammalian protamines, but, as in mammals, both protamines contain typical cysteine/arginine clusters. Ectopic expression of both dProtA and dProtB in the salivary gland cells localizes to the nucleus. Both the protamines binds to the polytene chromosomes without any specificity for the euchromatin or the heterochromatin reflecting the binding status of protamines in sperm nucleus. Unlike in mammals, Drosophila protamine genes are not haplo insufficient. Screening of Zuker mutant collection did not show any mutation in both protamine genes, which argues for functional redundancy. Mst 77 F encode a spermatid specific linker histone-like protein. The expression pattern of Mst 77 F overlaps the pattern of protamines as a chromatin component. Mst 77 F shows significant similarity to mammalian HILS 1 protein. The ProtamineA-eGFP, ProtamineB-eGFP and Mst 77 F-eGFP carrying Drosophila lines show that these proteins become the important chromosomal protein components at the canoe stage in elongating spermatids and stays in mature sperm nucleus and His 2 AvDGFP vanishes at the canoe stage. Thus, transition from histone based nucleosomal configuration to protamine based chromatin configuration {{takes place at the}} canoe stage of spermatid development. Mst 77 F mutants (ms(3) nc 3) are characterized by small round nuclei and are male sterile. These data suggests, the major feature of chromatin condensation in Drosophila spermatogenesis corrrespond to those in mammals. During the canoe stage of spermatid development, histone H 2 AvD is degraded. Here I show a novel function of UbcD 1 an E 2 -ubiquitin conjugating enzyme that is required for H 2 AvD degradation. E 3 ligase Cullin- 1 and Cullin- 3 both are expressed during Drosophila spermatogenesis. Cullin- 1 is expressed in all early germ cells and localizes to the <b>fusomes</b> and degraded during meiosis. In the later stages, Cullin- 1 is expressed again and localizes to the perinuclear space at the canoe stage of spermatid differentiation. Cullin- 3 is expressed in the elongated spermatids. During early fertilization steps, the paternal pronucleus still contains protamines and Mst 77 F, but regains a nucleosomal conformation before zygote formation. In eggs laid by sesame mutant females, the paternal pronucleus remains in a protamine-based chromatin status, but Mst 77 F-eGFP is removed, suggesting that the sesame gene product (HIRA) is essential for removal of protamines while Mst 77 F removal is independent of Sesame...|$|R
40|$|Drosophila ovarian cysts arise {{through a}} series of four {{synchronous}} incomplete mitotic divisions. After each round of mitosis, a membranous organelle, the <b>fusome,</b> grows along the cleavage furrow and the remnants of the mitotic spindle to connect all cystocytes in a cyst. The <b>fusome</b> is essential for the pattern and synchrony of the mitotic cyst divisions as well as oocyte differentiation. Using live cell imaging, greenfluorescent protein–tagged proteins, and photobleaching techniques, we demonstrate that fusomal endomembranes are part of a single continuous endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that is shared by all cystocytes in dividing ovarian cysts. Membrane and lumenal proteins of the common ER freely and rapidly diffuse between cystocytes. The fusomal ER mediates intercellular ER connectivity by linking the cytoplasmic ER membranes of all cystocytes within a cyst. Before entry into meiosis and onset of oocyte differentiation (between region 1 and region 2 A), ER continuity between cystocytes is lost. Furthermore, analyses of hts and Dhc 64 c mutants indicate that intercellular ER continuity within dividing ovarian cysts requires the <b>fusome</b> cytoskeletal component and suggest a possible role for the common ER in synchronizing mitotic cyst divisions...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAfter its specification, the Drosophila oocyte {{undergoes}} a critical polarization event that involves a {{reorganization of the}} microtubules (MT) and relocalization of the determinant Orb within the oocyte. This polarization requires Par- 1 kinase and the PDZ-containing Par- 3 homolog, Bazooka (Baz). Par- 1 has been observed on the <b>fusome,</b> which degenerates {{before the onset of}} oocyte polarization. How Par- 1 acts to polarize the oocyte has been unclear. Here we show that Par- 1 becomes restricted to the oocyte in a MT-dependent fashion after disappearance of the <b>fusome.</b> At the time of polarization, the kinase itself and the determinant BicaudalD (BicD) are relocalized from the anterior to the posterior of the oocyte. Par- 1 and BicD are interdependent and require MT and the minus end-directed motor Dynein for their relocalization. We show that baz is required for Par- 1 relocalization within the oocyte and that the distributions of Baz and Par- 1 in the Drosophila oocyte are complementary and strikingly reminiscent of the two PAR proteins in the C. elegans embryo. We propose that, through the combined actions of the <b>fusome,</b> MT, and Baz, Par- 1 is selectively enriched and localized within the oocyte, where, in conjunction with BicD, Egalitarian (Egl), and Dynein, it acts on the MT cytoskeleton to effect polarization...|$|E
40|$|During early Drosophila oogenesis, one cell from a cyst of 16 {{germ cells}} is {{selected}} {{to become the}} oocyte, and accumulates oocyte-specific proteins and the centrosomes from the other 15 cells.

Surprisingly, the centrosomes still localise to one cell after colcemid treatment, and in BicD and egl mutants, which abolish the localisation of all other oocyte markers and the polarisation of the microtubule cytoskeleton. In contrast, the centrosomes fail to migrate in cysts mutant for Dynein heavy chain 64 C, which disrupts the <b>fusome.</b> Thus, centrosome migration is independent of the organisation of the microtubule cytoskeleton, and seems to depend instead on the polarity of the <b>fusome.</b> Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|AbstractTheovarian tumorgene is {{required}} during both {{early and late}} stages of oogenesis. Mutations produce a range of phenotypes, including agametic ovarioles, tumorous egg chambers, and late stage oogenic arrest. We demonstrate {{that each of these}} phenotypes is associated with specific aberrations in actin distribution. In the earliest case,ovarian tumormutations cause actin filaments to accumulate ectopically in the <b>fusome.</b> This correlates with abnormal <b>fusome</b> morphology and arrested germ cell development in the germaria. Similarly,ovarian tumorfunction {{is required}} for the localization of actin that is essential for the maturation of ring canals. This defect gives rise to tumorous egg chambers in which germ cell numbers and morphology are profoundly aberrant. We also confirm thatovarian tumoris required for the formation of the nurse cell cytoplasmic actin array that is essential for the nonspecific transport of cytoplasmic contents to the oocyte during late oogenesis. Our data suggest that at this stageovarian tumorcontrols the site where actin filaments initiate. Taken together, these studies suggest that the diverseovarian tumormutant phenotypes derive from the mislocalization of actin filaments, indicating a role for this gene in organizing the female germline cytoskeleton, and that the misregulation of actin can have profound effects on germ cell division and differentiation...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDivision of {{a female}} Drosophila stem cell {{produces}} a daughter stem cell and a cystoblast. The cystoblast produces a syncytial cluster of 16 cells by precisely four mitotic divisions and incomplete cytokinesis. Mutations in genes required for cystoblast differentiation, such as bag-of-marbles, block syncytial cluster formation and produce a distinctive “tumorous” or hyperplastic germ cell phenotype. In this paper, we compare the oogenic phenotype of benign gonial cell neoplasm mutations to that of mutations in bam. The data indicate that, like bam, bgcn is required for cystoblast development and that germ cells lacking bgcn become trapped in a stem cell-like state. One indication that germ cells lacking bgcn cannot form cystoblasts is that bgcn stem cells resist genetic ablation by Bam misexpression. Misexpression of Bam eliminates wild-type stem cells, apparently by inducing them to divide as cystoblasts. bgcn stem cells remain active when Bam is misexpressed, probably because they cannot adopt the cystoblast fate. Bgcn activity is not required for Bam protein expression but {{is essential for the}} localization of Bam protein to the <b>fusome.</b> Together, the results suggest that Bam and Bgcn cooperatively regulate cystoblast differentiation by controlling localization of Bam protein to the <b>fusome...</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn theDrosophilaovary, {{membrane}} skeletal proteins {{such as the}} adducin-like Hts protein(s), spectrin, and ankyrin {{are found}} in the spectrosome, an organelle in germline stem cells (GSC) and their differentiated daughter cells (cystoblasts). These proteins are also components of the <b>fusome,</b> a cytoplasmic structure that spans the cystoblast's progeny that develop to form a germline cyst consisting of 15 nurse cells and an oocyte. Spectrosomes and fusomes are associated with one pole of spindles during mitosis and are implicated in cyst formation and oocyte differentiation. Here we show that the asymmetric behavior of the spectrosome persists throughout the cell cycle of GSC. Eliminating the spectrosome by thehtslmutation leads to randomized spindle orientation, suggesting that the spectrosome anchors the spindle to ensure the asymmetry of GSC division; eliminating the <b>fusome</b> in developing cysts results in defective spindles and randomized spindle orientation as well as asynchronous and reduced cystocyte divisions. These observations suggest that fusomes are required for the proper formation and asymmetric orientation of mitotic spindles. Moreover, they reinforce the notion that fusomes are required for the four synchronous divisions of the cystoblast leading to cyst formation. Inhtslcysts which lack fusomes and fail to incorporate ahtsgene product(s) into ring canals following cyst formation, polarized microtubule networks do not form, the dynamics of cytoplasmic dynein is disrupted, andoskarandorbRNAs fail to be transported to the future oocyte. These observations support the proposed role of fusomes and ring canals in organizing a polarized microtubule-based transport system for RNA localization that leads to oocyte differentiation...|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackground:Drosophila oocyte {{determination}} {{involves a}} complex process by which a single cell within an interconnected cyst of 16 germline cells differentiates into an oocyte. This process requires the asymmetric accumulation of both specific messenger RNAs and proteins within the future oocyte {{as well as the}} proper organization of the microtubule cytoskeleton, which together with the <b>fusome</b> provides polarity within the developing germline cyst. Results: In addition to its previously described late oogenic role in the establishment of anterior-posterior polarity and subsequent embryonic axis formation, the Drosophila par- 1 gene is required very early in the germline for establishing cyst polarity and for oocyte specification. Germline clonal analyses, for which we used a protein null mutation, reveal that Drosophila par- 1 (par- 1) is required for the asymmetric accumulation of oocyte-specific factors as well as the proper organization of the microtubule cytoskeleton. Similarly, somatic clonal analyses indicate that par- 1 is required for microtubule stabilization in follicle cells. The PAR- 1 protein is localized to the <b>fusome</b> and ring canals within the developing germline cyst in direct contact with microtubules. Likewise, in the follicular epithelium, PAR- 1 colocalizes with microtubules along the basolateral membrane. However, in either case PAR- 1 localization is independent of microtubules. Conclusions: The Drosophila par- 1 gene plays at least two essential roles during oogenesis; it is required early in the germline for organization of the microtubule cytoskeleton and subsequent oocyte determination, and it has a second, previously described role late in oogenesis in axis formation. In both cases, par- 1 appears to exert its effects through the regulation of microtubule dynamics and/or stability, and {{this finding is consistent with}} the defined role of the mammalian PAR- 1 homologs...|$|E

Consistent with previously described roles in spindle organization during Drosophila meiosis and mitosis, asp mutation leads to severe defects in spindle microtubule organization within the germarium. The mitotic spindles of the mutant cystocytes are composed by wavy microtubules and have abnormal poles that often lack g-tubulin. The <b>fusome</b> structure is also compromised. In the absence of asp function, the cystocyte divisions fail resulting in egg chamber with fewer than 16 germ cells. Moreover, the microtubule network within the developing germline cysts may assemble incorrectly in turn affecting the microtubule based transport of the specific determinants that is required during mid-oogenesis for the oocyte differentiation progra...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSrc family {{tyrosine}} kinases {{respond to}} a variety of signals by regulating the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. Here, we show that during early oogenesis Src 64 mutations lead to uneven accumulation of cortical actin, defects in <b>fusome</b> formation, mislocalization of septins, defective transport of Orb protein into the oocyte, and possible defects in cell division. Similar mutant phenotypes suggest that Src 64, the Tec 29 tyrosine kinase, and the actin crosslinking protein Kelch act together to regulate actin crosslinking, much as they do later during ring canal growth. Condensation of the oocyte chromatin into a compact karyosome is also defective in Src 64, Tec 29, and kelch mutants and in mutants for spire and chickadee (profilin), genes that regulate actin polymerization. These data, along with changes in G-actin accumulation in the oocyte nucleus, suggest that Src 64 is involved in a nuclear actin function during karyosome condensation.

40|$|Germline cysts are {{clusters}} of germ cells that arise by division {{from a single}} cell and are connected to one another by stable intercellular bridges.

Here we show that ALIX and the ESCRT-III component Shrub are required for completion of abscission during Drosophila female germline stem cell (fGSC) division. Loss of ALIX or Shrub function in fGSCs leads to delayed abscission and the consequent formation of stem cysts in which chains of daughter cells remain interconnected to the fGSC via midbody rings and <b>fusome.</b> We demonstrate that ALIX and Shrub interact and that they co-localize at midbody rings and midbodies during cytokinetic abscission in fGSCs. Mechanistically, we show that the direct interaction between ALIX and Shrub is required to ensure cytokinesis completion with normal kinetics in fGSCs. We conclude that ALIX and ESCRT-III coordinately control abscission in Drosophila fGSCs and that their complex formation is required for accurate abscission timing in GSCs in vivo...|$|E

Germline-specific features are used for the asymmetric segregation of fates, chromosomes and size during gametogenesis. In Drosophila females, for example, a germline-specific organelle called the <b>fusome</b> is used repeatedly to polarize the divisions of germline stem cells for their self-renewal, and during the divisions of cyst cells for the specification of the oocyte {{among a group of}} sister cells sharing a common cytoplasm. Later during oogenesis of most species, meiotic divisions produce a striking size asymmetry between a large oocyte and small polar bodies. The strategy used to create this asymmetry may involve the microtubules or the actin microfilaments or both, depending on the considered species. Despite this diversity and species-particularities, recent molecular data suggest that the PAR proteins, which control asymmetric cell division {{in a wide range of}} organisms and somatic cell types, could also play an important role at different steps of gametogenesis in many species. Here, we review the asymmetric features of germline cell division, from mitosis of germline stem cells to the extrusion of polar bodies after meiotic divisions...|$|E
40|$|The anterior-posterior axis of Drosophila is {{established}} before fertilisation when the oocyte becomes polarised {{to direct the}} localisation of bicoid and oskarmRNAs to opposite poles of the egg. Here we review recent results that reveal that the oocyte acquires polarity much earlier than previously thought, {{at the time when}} it acquires its fate. The oocyte arises from a 16 cell germline cyst, and its selection and the initial cue for its polarisation are controlled by the asymmetric segregation of a germline specific organelle called the <b>fusome.</b> Several different downstream pathways then interpret this asymmetry to restrict distinct aspects of oocyte identity to this cell. Mutations in any of the 6 conserved PAR proteins disrupt the early polarisation of the oocyte and lead to a failure to maintain its identity. Surprisingly, mutations affecting the control of the mitotic or meiotic cell cycle also lead to a failure to maintain the oocyte fate, indicating crosstalk between the nuclear and cytoplasmic events of oocyte differentiation. The early polarity of the oocyte initiates a series of reciprocal signalling events between the oocyte and the somatic follicle cells that lead to a reversal of oocyte polarity later in oogenesis, which defines the anterior-posterior axis of the embryo...|$|E
40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{formation}} of germline cyst and the differentiation of oocyte within the cyst in vertebrates. In the majority of invertebrates in the initial stages of gametogenesis, male and female germ cells develop in full synchrony as a syncytia of interconnected cells called germline cysts (clusters, nests). Using electron microscopy, immunostaining and three-dimensional reconstruction, we were able to elucidate the process of cyst formation in the developing ovary of the vertebrate Xenopus laevis. We found that the germline cyst in Xenopus contains 16 cells that are similar in general architecture and molecular composition to the cyst in Drosophila. Nest cells are connected by cytoplasmic bridges that contain ring canal-like structures. The nest cells contain a structure similar to the Drosophila <b>fusome</b> that that is probably involved in anchoring of the centrioles and organization of the primary mitochondrial cloud (PMC) around the centriole. We also find that in contrast to other organisms, in Xenopus, apoptosis is a rare event within the developing ovary. Our studies indicate that the processes responsible for the formation of female germline cysts and the establishment of germ cell polarity are highly conserved between invertebrates and vertebrates. The dissimilarities between Drosophila and Xenopus and the uniqueness of each system probably evolve...|$|E
40|$|The {{germline}} {{cells in}} the ovary of the female bee are interconnected by intercellular bridges kept open by cytoskeletal reinforcements in the plasmic membrane. These bridges among the germline cells display a dynamic behavior and probably act in {{the determination of the}} oocyte among the cells of the clone formed by the premeiotic mitoses, subsequently forming a pathway that enables the products synthesized by the nurse cells to reach the oocyte during its maturation. The cytoskeletal elements in the intercellular bridges of bee gonads are basically microfilaments and microtubules, but another type of filament (thick, of non-defined nature, associated with elements of the endoplasmic reticulum) is present in the bridges between the premeiotic cystocytes. This filament crosses the bridge, using microfilaments to fasten itself to the plasmic membrane. These filaments appear to control the span of the bridge. Upon completion of the proliferation phase the cystocytes take on a rosette shape, and a <b>fusome</b> formed by the convergence of the bridges appears at their center. The thick filaments are not present in this conformation. The differentiation of the oocyte and the nurse cells leads to a new change, in which the bridges are reoriented to convey the content of the future nurse cells to the oocyte...|$|E
40|$|Ovarian {{follicle}} {{formation in}} Drosophila melanogaster requires stall (stl) gene function, {{both within and}} outside the ovary, for follicle individualization, stalk cell intercalation, and oocyte localization. We have identified the stl transcript as CG 3622 and confirmed the presence of three alternatively spliced isoforms, contrary to current genome annotation. Here we show that the gene is expressed in both ovarian and brain tissues, which is consistent with previous evidence of an ovary nonautonomous function. On the basis of amino acid sequence, stl encodes a metalloprotease similar to the “a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin” (ADAMTS) family. Although stl mutant ovaries fail to maintain the branched structure of the <b>fusome</b> and periodically show improperly localized oocytes, stl mutants do not alter oocyte determination. Within the ovary, stl is expressed in pupal basal stalks and in adult somatic cells of the posterior germarium and the follicular poles. Genetically, stl exhibits a strong mutant interaction with Delta (Dl), and Dl mutant ovaries show altered stl expression patterns. Additionally, a previously described genetic interactor, daughterless, also modulates stl expression in the somatic ovary and may do so directly in its capacity as a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor. We propose a complex model of long-range extraovarian signaling through secretion or extracellular domain shedding, together with local intraovarian protein modification, to explain the dual sites of Stl metalloprotease function in oogenesis...|$|E

40|$|AbstractDuring {{male and}} female {{gametogenesis}} in species ranging from insects to mammals, germ cell cyst formation by incomplete cytokinesis involves the stabilization of cleavage furrows {{and the formation of}} stable intercellular bridges called ring canals. Accurate regulation of incomplete cytokinesis is required for both female and male fertility in Drosophila melanogaster. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms controlling complete versus incomplete cytokinesis are largely unknown. Here, we show that the scaffold protein Cindr is a novel component of both mitotic and meiotic ring canals during Drosophila spermatogenesis. Strikingly, unlike other male germline ring canal components, including Anillin and Pavarotti, Cindr and contractile ring F-actin dissociate from mitotic ring canals and translocate to the <b>fusome</b> upon completion of the mitotic germ cell divisions. We provide evidence that the loss of Cindr from mitotic ring canals is coordinated by signals that mediate the transition from germ cell mitosis to differentiation. Interestingly, Cindr loss from ring canals coincides with completion of the mitotic germ cell divisions in both Drosophila females and males, thus marking a common step of gametogenesis. We also show that Cindr co-localizes with Anillin at mitotic and meiotic ring canals and is recruited to the contractile ring by Anillin during male germ cell meiotic cytokinesis. Taken together, our analyses reveal a key step of incomplete cytokinesis at the endpoint of the mitotic germ cell divisions in D. melanogaster...|$|E
