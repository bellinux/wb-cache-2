40|$|Vierendeel {{mechanism}} is always critical in steel beams with single large web openings. While the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>web</b> openings controls both the shear and the flexural {{failures of the}} perforated sections, it is {{the length of the}} web openings that governs the 'Vierendeel' mechanism which in turn depends on the local shear and moment capacities of the tee sections above and below the web opening. A comprehensive finite element investigation on steel beams with web openings of various shapes and sizes was reported in a complementary paper, and the primary structural characteristics of those steel beams were presented in detail. Comparison on the global moment-shear interaction curves of those steel beams shows that they are similar to each other in shape, and thus, it is possible to develop a generalised moment-shear interaction curve to assess the load capacities of all steel beams with web openings of various shapes and sizes. As the global shear forces cause both shear failure and 'Vierendeel' mechanism in perforated sections, the effect of local 'Vierendeel' moments acting onto the tee-sections above and below the web openings may be incorporated through a reduction to the global shear capacities of the perforated sections. A global coupled shear capacity is thus established and its values for web openings of various shapes and sizes are obtained directly from the finite element investigation. Details of the design method are fully presented in this paper. Moreover, an indicative parameter, the 'Vierendeel' parameter, is established to assess the performance of 'Vierendeel' mechanism in perforated sections. Through comparison among the moment and the shear utilisation ratios, m and v, and the 'Vierendeel' parameter, v i, the critical modes of failure in perforated sections under different moment-shear ratios may be readily assessed.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to investigate and compare, through an analytical study, the behaviour of perforated steel beams with different shape configurations and sizes <b>of</b> <b>web</b> openings. In this investigation the ‘Vierendeel’ failure mechanisms of steel beams with web openings are examined through a Finite Element study. The shear and flexural failures of standard perforated sections are controlled mainly by the size (i. e. <b>depth)</b> <b>of</b> the <b>web</b> openings, whilst the ‘Vierendeel’ mechanism is primarily controlled by the critical length <b>of</b> the <b>web</b> openings. Three main categories <b>of</b> <b>web</b> opening shape configurations and sizes are considered in this work.

The results of this study are considered as relevant for practical applications as: (i) the reduction of the moment capacities of the tee-sections due to combination of axial and shear forces is smaller compared to the previous conservative linear interaction formula, and (ii) the formation of the initial plastic hinges at the low moment side (LMS) of the top tee-sections <b>of</b> the <b>web</b> openings does not usually cause failure, meaning that the beams can continue to carry additional load until all four plastic hinges are formed in the vicinity <b>of</b> the <b>web</b> openings and a ‘Vierendeel’ mechanism is fully established...|$|R

A comprehensive Finite Element (FE) study of four sizes of perforated steel sections with three different sizes of eleven standard and novel non-standard web opening shapes was undertaken, and their primary structural characteristics presented in detail {{in order to provide}} a simple design method for general practice.

30|$|Steel beams with web {{openings}} {{with five}} different spacing-to-diameter ratios (defined as {{the ratio of}} {{centre to centre distance}} of openings to diameter of openings, S/D o) and two aspect ratios (defined as the ratio of length <b>of</b> opening to <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> opening) were tested to failure. The models tested for each category are mentioned in Table  1. The details regarding position of proving ring, loading jack, and dial gauge are highlighted in Figs.  2 and 3. ‘The other parameters such as dimensions and location of stiffeners, and the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> the girder were kept constant to study the behaviour <b>of</b> <b>web</b> post exclusively. For all beams, overall depth was maintained at 100  mm with nominal top and bottom flange width of 55  mm and the corresponding nominal thickness of flange 5  mm and that <b>of</b> <b>web</b> is 4.7  mm. Transverse stiffeners were made of flat plates  25  mm wide and 5  mm nominal thickness. In the fifth model, the stiffeners were not provided, whereas in remaining all specimens the transverse stiffeners were provided at locations where concentrated forces are likely to occur, i.e. at centre of span and at supports, to prevent any modes of failure not required in the studies. All beams tested during experimental and numerical analysis have no lateral restrain, i.e. laterally unrestrained beams.|$|R

The experimental part verifies theoretical prerequisites when a flange is being machined with a sintered-carbide cutting tool.

40|$|JavaScript is a {{sequential}} {{programming language}} {{that has a}} large potential for parallel execution in Web applications. Thread-level speculation {{can take advantage of}} this, but it has a large memory overhead. In this article, we evaluate the effects of adjusting various parameters for thread-level speculation. Our results clearly show that thread-level speculation is a useful technique for taking advantage of multicore architectures for JavaScript in Web applications, that nested speculation is required in thread-level speculation, and that the execution characteristics <b>of</b> <b>Web</b> applications significantly reduce the needed memory, the number of threads, and the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> our speculation...|$|R
