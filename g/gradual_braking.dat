40|$|Abstract- “It takes 8, 460 bolts to {{assemble}} an automobile, and one nut to scatter {{it all over}} the road. ” Some of the biggest advances in the field of automotive technology in the past 10 years have come in the area of safety. Spurred by the improvements in the microprocessor speed, miniaturization, and software development, the automobile continues to evolve. In this new approach proposed, I am going to have an electronic and a pneumatic circuit to automatically control the traction of the vehicle. During ordinary conditions, when the vehicle is driven down a straight road, or if the difference between speeds of the two (rear) wheels is below a specified limit, no signal will be generated by the electronic circuit. This helps the vehicle negotiate the turns with better traction control as differential action is unaltered. But if the difference between speeds is beyond a specified limit, the signal will be generated by the electronic circuit which will actuate the pneumatic circuit. This causes <b>gradual</b> <b>braking</b> on the faster wheel until it gains traction. Hence, the wheels will never lose traction. This system ensures a reduction of more than 50 % in the capital investment as compared to the already existing systems can tilt the scales in the favour of the manufacturing company and eventually the cost conscious consume...|$|E
40|$|The {{introduction}} of the Brake By Wire is replacing the traditional mechanical control systems with ECUs and it is raising the need to reproduce feelings of eliminated static mechanical components (i. e. hydraulic fluids, pumps and cylinders). Thanks to electromechanical actuators and human-machine interfaces (i. e. active pedal) {{it is possible to}} reproduce such feelings and, therefore, arbitrarily change their features. In this way {{it will be possible to}} customize the pedal feelings and the vehicle deceleration needed depending on several factors (i. e. surrounding braking scenario, driver characteristics, race vs day-by-day driving condition). Since braking maneuvers are typically critical and involve the driver, the design and development of brake by wire system must start from the consideration of human factors in order to increase acceptance and braking effectiveness. The objective of this research was to redesign the pedal feelings, making them adaptable to the surrounding. Driver acceptance and braking effectiveness could be highly improved by means of adaptive pedal feelings. The starting points of this research were humans factors in the braking domain. Literature and relevant studies have been taken into consideration to put into evidence human mechanisms and behaviors during braking phases. On such basis, two main results have been found out: braking use cases and pedal feeling curves. With regard to the pedal feelings curves, 4 different pedal curves which describe both force on brake pedal travel and acceleration on brake pedal travel are designed. The pedal feeling depends on several factors like the pedal travel, the pedal idle travel, the effort, responsiveness, deceleration perceived, ease of balance (i. e. ease of modulation), <b>gradual</b> <b>braking</b> and so on. Regarding braking use cases, they are described by vehicle data as speed, acceleration, angles and relevant rates, engine rpm, gas and brake pedal position/speed and so on. These use cases have been clustered in order to meet the 4 pedal curves. The research continued on the implementation of a Matlab/Simulink/Stateflow model for the use case recognition. Basing on the vehicle data, the model is able to find out in which use case the vehicle is (parking, low speed maneuvers, emergency, downhill, and so on). Once it finds out the scenario, the model applies the most appropriate pedal feeling curve (both force feedback and deceleration needed). In the end, the model commands an EC brushless motor which is responsible of the changing of static springs force feedback of the pedal. The scenario recognition model has been validated through vehicle data on real road whereas the pedal feeling and relevant motor behaviors have been validate on bench tests...|$|E

50|$|The Pedalternorotandomovens Centroculatus Articulosus (curl-up) {{came into}} {{existence}} (spontaneous generation), because of the absence, in nature, of wheel shaped, living creatures {{with the ability to}} roll themselves forward. The accompanying 'beastie' depiction, referred to as 'revolving bitch' or 'roll paunch' in laymen's terms, subsequently anticipates the need with sensitivity. Biological details are still few: is it a mammal, a reptile, or an insect? It has a long, drawn-out, horned, sectioned body and three sets of legs; the ends of which look like the human foot. In the middle of the fat, round head, that is provided with a strong, bent parrots beak; they have bulb-shaped eyes, which, placed on posts, protrude far out {{from both sides of the}} head. In the stretched out position, the animal can, slow and cautiously, with the use of his six legs, move forward over a variety of terrains (it can potentially climb or descend steep stairs, plow through bushes, or scramble over boulders). However, when it must cover a great distance, and has a relatively flat path to his disposal, he pushes his head to the ground and rolls himself up with lightning speed, at which time he pushes himself off with his legs- for as much as they can still touch the ground. In the rolled up state it exhibits the form of a discus, of which the eye posts are the central axle. By pushing off alternately with one of his three pairs of legs, he can achieve great speeds. It is also sometimes desirable during the rolling (i.e. The descent of an incline, or coasting to a finish) to hold up the legs and 'freewheel' forward. Whenever it wants, it can return again to the walking position in two ways: first abruptly, by suddenly extending his body, but then it's lying on his back with his legs in the air, and second through <b>gradual</b> deceleration (<b>braking</b> with his feet) and slowly unrolling backwards in standing position.|$|R
