5|$|In 2011, at age 12, he {{impressed}} former football manager Lars Tjærnås {{during a}} nationwide tournament for under-16s: The best 15-year-olds {{in the country}} were gathered for a tournament between the top clubs... It was <b>definitely</b> <b>not</b> {{the first time he}} had astonished his opponents or the spectators. He was three or four years younger than the others. It was impossible not to realize that we were witnessing something out of the ordinary.|$|E
5|$|Many {{people believe}} the urban myth that the daddy longlegs Opiliones {{have the most}} {{poisonous}} bite in the spider world, but that the fangs {{are too small to}} penetrate human skin. This is untrue on several counts. None of the known species of harvestmen have venom glands; their chelicerae are not hollowed fangs but grasping claws that are typically very small and <b>definitely</b> <b>not</b> strong enough to break human skin.|$|E
5|$|The Sd.Kfz. 10/1 was a {{chemical}} detection vehicle. Before {{the outbreak of}} World War II only ninety were intended to be delivered in 194042 to equip the Chemical Troops (Nebeltruppen), but the 3 May 1940 production plan mentions {{that was to be}} produced at a rate of thirty per month until a total of 400 have been built and thereafter at ten per month. The last mention is a report that MWC was to complete ten vehicles by 15 January 1943. Production may have continued after that, but <b>definitely</b> <b>not</b> after 1943.|$|E

50|$|Ancient Aramaic {{may have}} had a larger series of emphatics, and some Neo-Aramaic {{languages}} <b>definitely</b> do. <b>Not</b> all dialects of Aramaic give these consonants their historic values.|$|R
5000|$|Donohue {{and colleagues}} (2002) {{conclude}} that it <b>definitely</b> is <b>not</b> a Kwerba language, {{as it had}} been classified by Wurm (1975). They did not notice connections to any other language family.|$|R
25|$|The {{evidence}} supports a midbrain {{cause of the}} AR pupil, provided one follows Loewenfeld’s definition of the AR pupil as small pupils that react very poorly to light and yet seem to retain a normal pupillary near response that is <b>definitely</b> <b>not</b> tonic.|$|E
25|$|We could {{remove the}} points where μ is zero, {{and take the}} support to be the {{remainder}} X\{x∈X|μ({x})=0}. This might work for the Dirac measure δ'p, but it would <b>definitely</b> <b>not</b> work for λ: since the Lebesgue measure of any singleton is zero, this definition would give λ empty support.|$|E
25|$|Günther's work {{agreed with}} Grant's, and the German {{anthropologist}} frequently {{stated that the}} Germans are <b>definitely</b> <b>not</b> a fully Nordic people. Hitler himself was later to downplay the importance of Nordicism in public for this very reason. The standard tripartite model placed most {{of the population of}} Hitler's Germany in the Alpine category, especially after the Anschluss.|$|E
50|$|Other authors {{prefer to}} use the symbols ⊂ and ⊃ to {{indicate}} proper subset and proper superset instead of ⊊ and ⊋. This usage makes ⊆ and ⊂ analogous to the inequality symbols ≤ and <. For example, if x ≤ y then x {{may or may not}} equal y, but if x < y, then x <b>definitely</b> does <b>not</b> equal y, and is less than y. Similarly, using the convention that ⊂ is proper subset, if A ⊆ B, then A may or may not equal B, but if A ⊂ B, then A <b>definitely</b> does <b>not</b> equal B.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>definitely</b> internal, <b>not</b> an external, {{motive for}} the {{behavior}} can be discerned clinically: e.g., long-lasting extortion or habitual spousal battery might cause a person to lie repeatedly, without the lying being a pathological symptom.|$|R
25|$|Hittorff lectured in Paris in 1829-1830 that Greek temples had {{originally}} been painted ochre yellow, with the moulding and sculptural details in red, blue, green and gold. While this {{may or may not}} have been the case with older wooden or plain stone temples, it was <b>definitely</b> <b>not</b> the case with the more luxurious marble temples, where colour was used sparingly to accentuate architectural highlights.|$|E
25|$|It {{is quickly}} {{revealed}} that Ella is <b>definitely</b> <b>not</b> what she seems. She is 445 {{years old and}} the daughter of John Dee. Ella is also a witch and has been hunting Azazeal for centuries. So far, she has been very successful in preventing Azazeal from begetting a son by a mortal witch. This time, however, Ella was too late. Her mission: kill Malachi.|$|E
25|$|But it was <b>definitely</b> <b>not</b> {{all work}} and no play for local residents. In 1894, Hamilton Herald {{newspaper}} and cigar store owner Billy Carroll established the Around the Bay Road Race. The route circumnavigates Burlington Bay and, {{although it is}} not a proper marathon, it is the longest continuously held long distance foot race in North America. It was won by such sporting greats as William “Billy” Sherring, Tom Longboat and Sam Mellor.|$|E
50|$|Everyone should {{recognize}} that there are serious economic challenges for the future of academic publishing. Even though open access models are problematic, traditional publishing models <b>definitely</b> are <b>not</b> sustainable and something radical needs to change immediately.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally in one percenter {{motorcycle}} clubs you {{see only}} Harley Davidson motorcycles, {{or at the}} very least it is somewhat mandatory that the motorcycle has been made in America and <b>definitely</b> is <b>not</b> produced in Asia.|$|R
25|$|Although he <b>definitely</b> did <b>not</b> {{perform the}} world's first radio broadcast, an honor {{that belongs to}} Enrico Marconi, Susini is often credited, {{especially}} in Argentine publications, {{with the establishment of}} the world's first regular radio broadcast service.|$|R
25|$|The T-37A was {{delivered}} to the U.S. Air Force beginning in June 1956. The USAF began cadet training in the T-37A during 1957. The first T-37B {{was delivered}} in 1959. Instructors and students considered the T-37A a pleasant aircraft to fly. It handled well and was agile and responsive, though it was <b>definitely</b> <b>not</b> overpowered. It was capable of all traditional aerobatic maneuvers. Students intentionally placed the aircraft into a spin {{as part of their}} pilot training.|$|E
25|$|The issues {{involved}} in raw feeding may be particularly relevant to tall, streamlined breeds such as the borzoi. It {{is interesting to note}} that the Hortaya Borzaya, undoubtedly a very close relative, is traditionally raised on a meager diet of oats and table scraps. The Hortaya is also said to be intolerant of highly concentrated kibble feeds. Basically, a lean body weight in itself is nothing to be concerned about, and force-feeding of healthy young borzoi is <b>definitely</b> <b>not</b> recommended.|$|E
25|$|As far as Lange is concerned, he was {{the biggest}} murderer I have ever known. To {{write a book about}} him would <b>definitely</b> <b>not</b> be enough. As he is dead, it is no use talking about him. I would, however, mention {{that he was one of}} the most notorious anti-Semites in the 20th century. He hated Jews so much that he could not look at them; one never wanted to pass him either in the motor pool or {{anywhere}} else.|$|E
50|$|In 2006, after {{completing}} her first feature film, {{she went on}} to create another multimedia piece, Things We Don’t Understand and <b>Definitely</b> Are <b>Not</b> Going To Talk About, which she performed in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and New York.|$|R

25|$|Some CBC Radio One programs, such as <b>Definitely</b> <b>Not</b> the Opera, WireTap, Q, and As It Happens, also air on some {{stations}} {{associated with}} American Public Media or Public Radio International. Some of the CBC's radio networks {{are available to}} SiriusXM subscribers in the United States, including CBC Radio One (a special feed that exclusively contains CBC-produced content and no regional programs) and Première (a simulcast of its Montreal flagship CBF-FM), CBC Radio 3, and music-oriented services exclusive to SiriusXM.|$|E
25|$|With {{the advent}} of the 3rd edition, Blood Bowl moved closer to the {{traditional}} Warhammer Fantasy Battle world by changing the miniatures to look more similar to their Warhammer Fantasy Battle counterparts. Jervis Johnson, designer of the game, has admitted this was not the best direction for the game, and has since stated that the Blood Bowl world is similar to, but <b>definitely</b> <b>not</b> the same as, the Warhammer world. Recent changes to the rules reflect this, and newer miniatures for the game look more sporty in nature.|$|E
25|$|The {{industrialization}} {{drive was}} meant to be primarily a Peruvian process not totally excluding foreign investors but <b>definitely</b> <b>not</b> welcoming them warmly. In that spirit, the Velasco regime immediately nationalized IPC in October 1968 and, not long after that, the largest copper mining company, while taking over other foreign firms more peacefully through buy-outs. The government put into place new restrictions on foreign investment in Peru and led the way to a regional agreement, the Andean Pact, that featured some of the most extensive controls on foreign investment yet attempted in the developing world.|$|E

50|$|Illustration of {{differences}} between self-action, interaction, and transaction, {{as well as the}} different facets of transactional inquiry are provided by statements of positions that Dewey and Bentley <b>definitely</b> did <b>not</b> hold and which never should be read into their work.|$|R

25|$|Tested at 9.7 {{seconds to}} 100km/h for the manual model, {{it is more}} than half a second slower than its predecessor. This is likely on account of its weight, a hefty 1300kg, which is curiously more than the Civic unlike before wherein it was usually lighter. The {{automatic}} also has widely spaced ratios {{due to the lack of}} a fifth gear, giving sluggish acceleration, <b>definitely</b> <b>not</b> maximizing the engine potential. The Toyota Corolla received a 4 star ANCAP safety rating for occupant safety and a 3 star rating for pedestrian safety.|$|E
25|$|There {{were few}} health care {{facilities}} other than local General Practitioner surgeries within the Municipality of Clarence prior to the Tasman Bridge Disaster. The isolation caused by the severing of the bridge, and the inability of patients to travel across the river for treatment highlighted the need for local health care services on the eastern shore. The Bayfield Healthcare Centre (now known as the Clarence Community Health Centre) was developed at considerable cost to the state government, but soon became the City's primary health care provider. Whilst it is <b>definitely</b> <b>not</b> {{large enough to be}} considered a hospital, recent upgrading has seen the centre fall into the super clinic category.|$|E
25|$|I {{have not}} worked with YA editors; my work {{has never been}} marketed that way until Tor put a YA cover and a new ISBN on Ender’s Game—fifteen years after the book first came out, and long after it had become popular with young readers. Ender's Game was written with no {{concessions}} to young readers. My protagonists were children, but the book was <b>definitely</b> <b>not</b> aimed at kids. I was perfectly aware that {{the rule of thumb}} for children’s literature is that the protagonist must be a couple of years older than the target audience. You want ten-year-old readers, you have a twelve-year-old hero.|$|E
50|$|This {{item was}} the {{greatest}} of all the others in the code because it emphasized the power of youth and the ability of it. Students were encouraged to learn while they are still young. The item, at that item, <b>definitely</b> was <b>not</b> discriminating.|$|R
5000|$|... " ... The {{statement}} {{of young people}} in the courtroom at that time made me speechless. I wanted to free them, but instead, I overwhelmed and offended them with sexual transgression. It <b>definitely</b> was <b>not</b> my intention. I hope they forgive me .... " ...|$|R
