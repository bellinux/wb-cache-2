40|$|Background: The {{medication}} cart can {{be filled}} using an automated system or a manual method and when using a manual method the medication {{can be arranged}} either by round time or by medication name. For the manual methods, it is hypothesized that the latter method {{would result in a}} lower <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> medication <b>administration</b> errors because nurses are forced to read the medication labels, but evidence for this hypothesis is lacking. Objectives: The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> medication <b>administration</b> errors <b>of</b> two different manual medication cart filling methods, namely arranging medication by round time or by medication name. Design: A prospective, observational study with a before-after design. Participants and settings: Eighty-six patients who stayed on an orthopaedic ward in one university medical centre in the Netherlands were included. Methods: Disguised observation was used to detect medication administration errors. The medication cart filling method in usual care was to fill the cart with medication arranged by round time. The intervention was the implementation of the second medication cart filling method, where the medication cart was filled by arranging medicines by their names. The primary outcome was the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> medication <b>administrations</b> with one or more error(s) after the intervention compared with before the intervention. The secondary outcome was the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> subtypes <b>of</b> medication <b>administration</b> errors. Results: After the intervention 170 of 740 (23. 0 %) medication administrations with one or more medication administration error(s) were observed compared to 114 of 589 (19. 4 %) before the intervention (odds ratio 1. 24 [95 % confidence interval 0. 95 - 1. 62]). The distribution of subtypes <b>of</b> medication <b>administration</b> errors before and after the intervention was statistically significantly different (p < 0. 001). Analysis of subtypes revealed more omissions and wrong time errors after the intervention than before the intervention. Unauthorized medication errors were detected more frequently before the intervention than after the intervention. Conclusion: The <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> medication <b>administration</b> errors with the medication cart filling method where the medication is arranged by name was not statistically significantly different compared to the medication cart filling method where the medication is arranged by round time.

The pooled 4 week placebo healing rate of all duodenal ulcer trials that employed a {{four times a day}} regimen was compared with the rate obtained from trials with a twice a day regimen. RESULTS: The pooled 4 week healing rate of the 51 trials with a four times a day regimen was 44. 2 % (805 of 1821 patients) compared with 36. 2 % (545 of 1504 patients) in the 28 trials with a twice a day regimen (difference, 8. 0 % [equal effects model]; 95 % confidence interval, 4. 6 % to 11. 3 %). Depending on the statistical analysis, the rate difference ranged from 6. 0 % (multivariable random effects model) to 8. 0 % (equal effects model). A number of sensitivity analyses showed comparable differences between the two regimens. Most of these sensitivity analyses were not significant, probably because a number of trials were excluded resulting in a loss of power. CONCLUSIONS: We found a relation between <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> placebo <b>administration</b> and healing <b>of</b> duodenal ulcer. We realize that the comparison was based on nonrandomized data.

In {{order to reduce}} the burden of the intravenously administered enzyme, a low <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration</b> was prospectively studied in patients with stable and minor disease following ERT. DESIGN AND METHODS: Eleven patients were randomly assigned either to continue their original regimen of a dose of ERT once every week or fortnight (five patients) or to lower the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration</b> to once every 4 weeks, at the same cumulative dose (six patients). The primary end-point was change in liver ratio (mL/kg body weight). Secondary end-points were spleen volume, hemoglobin level, platelet count, lumbar bone marrow fat content measured with quantitative chemical shift imaging (QCSI), white cell count, and plasma levels of ferritin, chitotriosidase, liver enzymes and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). RESULTS: There were no significant mean differences between the two treatment arms in liver ratio {{or any of the other}} end-points. However, there were two treatment failures in the low <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration</b> group. These patients showed progression of disease as evidenced by a reduction of QCSI in one patient and an increase in liver ratio as well as a slow decrease in QCSI in the other. Both patients already had relatively low baseline QCSI values. One patient switched back to the original regimen at 6 months because of subjective complaints.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{frequency}} of drug prescription errors is high. Excluding errors in decision making, the remaining are mainly due to order ambiguity, non standard nomenclature and writing illegibility. The {{aim of this}} study is to analyse, as a part of a continuous quality improvement program, the quality of prescriptions writing for antibiotics, in an Italian University Hospital as a risk factor for prescription errors. Methods The point prevalence survey, carried out in May 26 – 30 2008, involved 41 inpatient Units. Every parenteral or oral antibiotic prescription was analysed for legibility (generic or brand drug name, dose, <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration)</b> and completeness (generic or brand name, dose, <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration,</b> route of administration, date of prescription and signature of the prescriber). Eight doctors (residents in Hygiene and Preventive Medicine) and two pharmacists performed the survey by reviewing the clinical records of medical, surgical or intensive care section inpatients. The antibiotics drug category was chosen because its use is widespread in the setting considered. Results Out of 756 inpatients included in the study, 408 antibiotic prescriptions were found in 298 patients (mean prescriptions per patient 1. 4; SD ± 0. 6). Overall 92. 7 % (38 / 41) of the Units had at least one patient with antibiotic prescription. Legibility was in compliance with 78. 9 % of generic or brand names, 69. 4 % of doses, 80. 1 % of <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration,</b> whereas completeness was fulfilled for 95. 6 % of generic or brand names, 76. 7 % of doses, 83. 6 % of <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration,</b> 87 % of routes of administration, 43. 9 % of dates of prescription and 33. 3 % of physician's signature. Overall 23. 9 % of prescriptions were illegible and 29. 9 % of prescriptions were incomplete. Legibility and completeness are higher in unusual drugs prescriptions. Conclusion The Intensive Care Section performed best as far as quality of prescription writing was concerned when compared with the Medical and Surgical Sections. Nevertheless the overall illegibility and incompleteness (above 20 %) are unacceptably high. Values need to be improved by enhancing the safety culture and in particular the awareness of the professionals on the consequences that a bad prescription writing can produce. </p...|$|E

40|$|Background: Depot {{antipsychotics}} {{are commonly}} used to improve adherence and clinical outcomes such as relapse and readmission. Dosing regimens vary but are commonly two- and four-weekly. To date, the effect <b>of</b> <b>administration</b> at two-weekly or four-weekly intervals on outcome has not been examined in a meta-analysis. Aims: A systematic review and meta-analysis on whether the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> depot antipsychotic <b>administration</b> (e. g., two- vs four-weekly) makes any difference to compliance and outcome. Methods: A systematic search of Medline, EMBASE and PsycInfo for RCTs that compared the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> depot <b>administration</b> (e. g., two- vs four-weekly) for an equivalent dose.

Aim: To identify {{the relative importance of}} <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration,</b> efficacy, and other treatment characteristics among candidates for prophylactic treatment for hemophilia A and B. Method: An Internet survey was conducted among hemophilia patients and the parents of pediatric hemophilia patients in Australia, Canada, and the US. A monadic conjoint task was included in the survey, which varied <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration</b> (three, two, or one time per week for hemophilia A; twice weekly, weekly, or biweekly for hemophilia B), efficacy (no bleeding or breakthrough bleeding once every 4  months, 6  months, or 12  months), diluent volume (3  mL vs 2. 5  mL for hemophilia A; 5  mL vs 3  mL for hemophilia B), vials per infusion (2 vs 1), reconstitution device (assembly required vs not), and manufacturer (established in hemophilia vs not). Respondents were asked their likelihood to switch from their current regimen to the presented treatment. Respondents were told to assume that other aspects of treatment, such as risk of inhibitor development, cost, and method of distribution, would remain the same. Results: A total of 89 patients and/or parents of children with hemophilia A participated; another 32 were included in the exercise for hemophilia B. Relative importance was 47 %, 24 %, and 18 % for <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration,</b> efficacy, and manufacturer, respectively, in hemophilia A; analogous values were 48 %, 26 %, and 21 % in hemophilia B.

Subjects and methods: Of 88 Japanese AMD patients (28 men and 60 women, mean age: 72. 7 ± 7. 5 years) who underwent intravitreal injection of ranibizumab for 3 years from 2010 to 2013, this study involved 12 eyes of 12 patients (10 men and two women) in whom VMA was observed based on optical coherence tomography (OCT) findings (VMA [+] group) and 17 eyes of 16 patients (seven men and nine women, control group) in whom no VMA was observed (VMA [-] group). In all enrolled patients, ranibizumab was administered monthly for 3 months, and then administered as needed (ie, pro re nata) when deterioration was observed. The two groups were then compared in regard to changes in visual acuity (VA) and the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> ranibizumab <b>administration</b> over a 1 -year period.

If CTLs can be more rapidly and simply induced, the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> immunotherapy could be increased and unexpected contamination could be avoided. In this study, in order to more rapidly induce functional CTLs, we investigated a new method (N-method) that uses a cytokine cocktail, including interleukin (IL) - 2, IL- 4, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, tumour necrosis factor-α and interferon-α, together with a tumour lysate. CTLs induced by the N-method had equivalent functions, such as proliferation, surface antigen expressio...|$|R
