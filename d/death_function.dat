6000|$|The {{attempts}} {{to explain the}} nature of Life, which have fallen within my knowledge, presuppose the arbitrary division of all that surrounds us into things with life, and things without life—a division grounded on a mere assumption. At the best, it can be regarded only as a hasty deduction from the first superficial notices of the objects that surround us, sufficient, perhaps, {{for the purpose of}} ordinary discrimination, but far too indeterminate and diffluent to be taken unexamined by the philosophic inquirer. The positions of science must be tried in the jeweller’s scales, not like the mixed commodities of the market, on the weigh-bridge of common opinion and vulgar usage. Such, however, has been the procedure in the present instance, and the result has been answerable to the coarseness of the process. By a comprisal of the petitio principii with the argumentum in circulo,—in plain English, by an easy logic, which begins with begging the question, and then moving in a circle, comes round {{to the point where it}} began,—each of the two divisions has been made to define the other by a mere reassertion of their assumed contrariety. The physiologist has luminously explained Y plus X by informing us that it is a somewhat that is the antithesis of Y minus X; and if we ask, what then is Y-X? the answer is, the antithesis of Y+X,—a reciprocation of great service, that may remind us of the twin sisters in the fable of the Lamiæ, with but one eye between them both, which each borrowed from the other as either happened to want it; but with this additional disadvantage, that in the present case it is after all but an eye of glass. The definitions themselves will best illustrate our meaning. I will begin with that given by Bichat. “Life is the sum of all the functions by which death is resisted,” in which I have in vain endeavoured to discover any other meaning than that life consists in being able to live. This author, with a whimsical gravity, prefaces his definition with the remark, that the nature of life has hitherto been sought for in abstract considerations; as if it were possible that four more inveterate abstractions could be brought together in one sentence than are here assembled in the words, life, <b>death,</b> <b>function,</b> and resistance. Similar instances might be cited from Richerand and others. The word Life is translated into other more learned words; and this paraphrase of the term is substituted for the definition of the thing, and therefore (as is always the case in every real definition as contra-distinguished from a verbal definition,) for at least a partial solution of the fact. Such as these form the first class.—The second class takes some one particular function of Life common to all living objects,—nutrition, for instance; or, to adopt the phrase most in vogue at present, assimilation, for the purposes of reproduction and growth. Now this, it is evident, can be an appropriate definition only of the very lowest species, as of a Fungus or a Mollusca; and just as comprehensive an idea of the mystery of Life, as a Mollusca might give, can this definition afford. But this is not the only objection. For, first, it is not pretended that we begin with seeking for an organ evidently appropriated to nutrition, and then infer that the substance in which such an organ is found lives. On the contrary, in a number of cases among the obscurer animals and vegetables we infer the organ from the pre-established fact of its life. Secondly, it identifies the process itself with a certain range of its forms, those, namely, by which it is manifested in animals and vegetables. For this, too, no less than the former, presupposes the arbitrary division of all things into not living and lifeless, on which, as I before observed, all these definitions are grounded. But it is sorry logic to take the proof of an affirmative in one thing as the proof of the negative in another. All animals that have lungs breathe, but it would be a childish oversight to deduce the converse, viz. all animals that breathe have lungs. The theory in which the French chemists organized the discoveries of Black, Cavendish, Priestly, Scheele, and other English and German philosophers, is still, indeed, the reigning theory, but rather, it should seem, from the absence of a rival sufficiently popular to fill the throne in its stead, than from the continuance of an implicit belief in its own stability. We no longer at least cherish that intensity of faith which, before Davy commenced his brilliant career, had not only identified it with chemistry itself, but had substituted its nomenclature, even in common conversation, for the far more philosophic language which the human race had abstracted from the laboratory of Nature. I may venture to prophecy that no future Beddoes will make it the corival of the mathematical sciences in demonstrative evidence. I think it a matter of doubt whether, during the period of its supposed infallibility, physiology derived more benefit from the extension, or injury from the misdirection, of its views. Enough of the latter is fresh in recollection to make it but an equivocal compliment to a physiological position, that it must stand or fall with the corpuscular philosophy, as modified by the French theory of chemistry. Yet should it happen (and the event is not impossible, nor the supposition altogether absurd,) that more and more decisive facts should present themselves in confirmation of the metamorphosis of elements, the position that life consists in assimilation would either cease to be distinctive, or fall back into the former class as an identical proposition, namely, that Life, meaning by the word that sort of growth which takes place by means of a peculiar organization, consists in that sort of growth which is peculiar to organized life. Thirdly, the definition involves a still more egregious flaw in the reasoning, namely, that of cum hoc, ergo propter hoc (or the assumption of causation from mere coexistence); and this, too, in its very worst form. For it is not cum hoc solo, ergo propter hoc, which would in many cases supply a presumptive proof by induction, but cum hoc, et plurimis aliis, ergo propter hoc! Shell, of some kind or other, is common to the whole order of testacea, but it would be absurd to define the vis vitæ of testaceous animals as existing in the shell, though we know it to be the constant accompaniment, and have every reason to believe the constant effect, of the specific life that acts in those animals. Were we (argumenti [...] causá) to imagine shell coextensive with the organized creation, this would produce no abatement in the falsity of the reasoning. Nor does the flaw stop here; for a physiological, that is a real, definition, as distinguished from the verbal definitions of lexicography, must consist neither in any single property or function of the thing to be defined, nor yet in all collectively, which latter, indeed, would be a history, not a definition. It must consist, therefore, in the law of the thing, or in such an idea of it, as, being admitted, all the properties and functions are admitted by implication. It must likewise be so far causal, that a full insight having been obtained of the law, we derive from it a progressive insight into the necessity and generation of the phenomena of which it is the law. Suppose a disease in question, which appeared always accompanied with certain symptoms in certain stages, and with some one or more symptoms in all stages—say deranged digestion, capricious alternation of vivacity and languor, headache, dilated pupil, diminished sensibility to light, &c.—Neither the man who selected the one constant symptom, nor he who enumerated all the symptoms, would give the scientific definition talem scilicet, quali scientia fit vel datur, but the man who at once named and defined the disease hydrocephalus, producing pressure on the brain. For it is the essence of a scientific definition to be causative, not by introduction of imaginary somewhats, natural or supernatural under the name of causes, but by announcing the law of action in the particular case, in subordination to the common law of which all the phenomena are modifications or results.|$|E

A model with a strong density dependent <b>death</b> <b>function</b> shows that population replacement can be realized if the initial ratio of number of infected to the total number of mosquitoes exceeds a critical value, especially when transmission from mother to offspring is perfect.

40|$|AbstractIn mammals, {{mitochondria}} {{are important}} mediators of programmed cell death, and {{this process is}} often regulated by Bcl- 2 family proteins. However, a role for mitochondria-mediated cell death in non-mammalian species is more controversial.

Homologues of these fission factors and several additional mammalian cell death regulators are conserved in flies, worms and yeast, and have been suggested to regulate programmed cell death in these species as well. However, the molecular mechanisms by which these phylogenetically conserved proteins contribute to cell death are not known for any species. Some have taken the conserved pro-death activity of mitochondrial fission factors to mean that mitochondrial fission per se, or failed attempts to undergo fission, are directly involved in cell death. Other evidence suggests that the fission function and the cell <b>death</b> <b>function</b> of these factors are separable.

40|$|Cancer is a {{multifaceted}} disease comprising {{a combination of}} genetic, metabolic and signalling aberrations, which severely disrupt the normal homeostasis of cell growth and death. Many oncogenic events while promoting tumour development also increase the sensitivity of cells to cell death stimuli including chemotherapeutic drugs.

The impairment of cell <b>death</b> <b>function</b> is also often {{the reason for the}} development of chemotherapeutic resistance encountered during treatment. It is therefore necessary to achieve a comprehensive understanding of existing cell death pathways and the relevant regulatory components involved, with the intention of identifying new strategies to kill cancer cells.

Caspase- 8 deficiency is associated with pathologies that are unexpected for a proapoptotic molecule, such as abrogation of activation-induced lymphocyte proliferation, perturbed immune homeostasis, and immunodeficiency. In this study, we report the long-term physiological consequences of T cell–specific deletion of caspase- 8 (tcasp 8 �/ �). We show that tcasp 8 �/ � mice develop an age-dependent lethal lymphoproliferative and lymphoinfiltrative immune disorder characterized by lymphoadenopathy, splenomegaly, and accumulation of T cell infiltrates in the lungs, liver, and kidneys. Peripheral casp 8 �/ � T cells manifest activation marker up-regulation and are proliferating {{in the absence of any}} infection or stimulation.

An expression screen for proteins that bind to Bcl- 2 yielded a small novel protein, denoted Bim, whose only similarity to any known protein is the short (nine amino acid) BH 3 motif shared by most Bcl- 2 homologues. Bim provokes apoptosis, and the BH 3 region is required for Bcl- 2 binding {{and for most of}} its cytotoxicity.

We recently identified MAP 4 K 3 as proapoptotic kinase using an RNA interference screening approach. In mammalian cells, MAP 4 K 3 enhances the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway through the post-transcriptional modulation of selected proapoptotic Bcl- 2 homology domain 3 -only proteins.

In addition, we show that hppy expression triggers the activation of both the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and target of rapamycin (TOR) signalling pathways; however, only JNK signalling is required for apoptosis.

The three currently known IAP antagonists in Drosophila {{map to the}} H 99 genomic interval required for all programmed cell death [2]. Here we describe a fourth member of this genetic group, sickle (skl), which maps just outside of the H 99 deletion. At its N terminus, Skl shares residues in common with other IAP antagonists in flies (Rpr, Grim, and Hid) [3 – 5] and in mammals (Smac/DIABLO and Omi/Htra 2) [6 – 10]. Like other activators of apoptosis mapping in the Reaper region, full-length skl induced apoptosis when overexpressed, and the N terminus of this protein specifically bound to the BIR 2 domain of DIAP 1. However, unlike the N termini of Grim, Hid [11, 12], and Rpr, the N terminus of Skl did not induce apoptosis. skl transcripts accumulate in cells that are fated to die in some but not all regions of the embryo. Genotoxic stimuli induced skl expression, but skl was not responsive to all signals that trigger premature apoptosis. skl is potentially a fourth IAP antagonist in the “Reaper region” and a new candidate transducer of apoptotic damage signaling in Drosophila...|$|E

MethodsCauses of graft loss were reviewed for 1467 primary kidney transplants done at our institution between January 1, 1990, and December 31, 1999. Graft loss for that entire population was studied and then the causes of loss selectively examined at 5 years post-transplant. Finally, causes of loss in the 1990 s versus the 1980 s were compared. ResultsFive major causes of graft loss were noted in the 1990 s: thrombosis, acute rejection (either alone or combined with delayed graft function or infection), chronic rejection, <b>death</b> with <b>function,</b> and noncompliance.

In the present study, we investigated the role of NF-κB in cell death induced by chronic insult with hydrogen peroxide (H(2) O(2)). Here, we show that NF-κB promotes H(2) O(2) induced caspase independent but PARP dependent fibroblast cell death. The pro-death {{activity of}} NF-κB is due to the DNA binding activity of RelA, which is induced through IKK- mediated IκBα degradation.

The converse was found when nest sites were experimentally removed. This suggested that the numbers of nests that could be constructed on a territory was limited by habitat structure.

40|$|A simplified, {{systematic}} {{approach to the}} mathematical simulation of crystallizers is attempted by using the fundamental principles of mass conservation, via a population balance to the solid phase and a solute balance to both solid and liquid phases. A continuous, isothermal and isochoric crystallizer {{is assumed to be}} described by the MSMPR model under transient operating conditions with complete micromixing. The birth and <b>death</b> <b>functions</b> are assumed nil. Homogeneous nucleation is considered at a rate which is independent of the solution supersaturation. The growth rate of the crystals is described by McCabe's law. The possibility of solving the population balance and the mass balance independently is explored, and the conditions of validity for such an approach are found. The maximum linear dimension of crystal and the liquor concentration profile as functions of time are obtained. The approximation is found to be generally good {{for a period of time}} right after start-up of the crystallizer. A much wider range of time ensuring a satisfactory approximation is possible provided that the system and operation-dependent parameter takes small values...|$|R
