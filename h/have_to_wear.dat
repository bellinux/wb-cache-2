5|$|LeMond {{was in a}} {{car crash}} on the morning of January 30, 2013. He was driving through wintery and icy {{conditions}} to his dentist in Wayzata, Minnesota, when he lost control of his car. LeMond suffered a concussion and was left with no memory of the incident. According to Associated Press, a Plymouth police report says LeMond left the road, hit a fence and shrubs, and then hit an embankment before ending up in the backyard of a home. LeMond may have lost consciousness before the accident, according to his wife Kathy, and he suffered a compression fracture in his back and would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> a brace for three months. The accident curtailed LeMond's public appearances {{in the first half of}} 2013, but he made a full recovery.|$|E

5|$|The race saw the {{competitive}} début of Pirelli's new ultrasoft tyre compound, which was provided alongside the supersoft and soft compounds. Per the regulations of the 2016 season, every driver needs {{to set aside}} one set {{each of the two}} softest compounds for the race and one set of the ultrasofts for Q3 (should they advance). The drivers have freedom of what other compounds they choose for the remaining ten out of thirteen sets. From this race onwards, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile allowed drivers to choose alternative helmet designs for one race weekend per season, a practice usually prohibited as they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> the same design to make them more recognisable to spectators and television audiences. As a consequence, Felipe Massa's helmet featured extensive artwork by graffiti artist Os Gêmeos, teammate Valtteri Bottas featured casino-inspired imagery and Haas driver Romain Grosjean sported a tribute to the late Jules Bianchi on his helmet. The race marked a reason for celebration at McLaren, as the team had started their first ever Grand Prix at Monaco fifty years earlier.|$|E

25|$|The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia {{requires}} Muslim {{women to}} cover their hair and all women <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> a full-body garment. Saudi women commonly wear the traditional abaya robe, while foreigners sometimes opt for a long coat. These regulations are enforced by the religious police and vigilantes. In 2002 the Saudi religious police were accused by Saudi and international press of hindering the rescue of schoolgirls from a fire {{because they were not}} wearing hijab, which resulted in 15 deaths.|$|E
25|$|For example, in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran, many liberal women wore short skirts, flower printed hippie dresses, flared trousers, {{and went}} out in public without the hijab. This changed {{following}} the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, military dictatorship in Pakistan, and Iranian revolution of 1979, when traditional conservative attire including the abaya, jilbab and niqab made a comeback. There were demonstrations in Iran in March 1979, after the hijab law was brought in, decreeing that women in Iran would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> scarves to leave the house.|$|E

Unmarked cars, which are already equipped with a plug-in police light, will also be supplied with additional emergency equipment, including a siren package. The proposals will be phased in over three years beginning in 2008. Undercover officers will also <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wear,</b> carry or have access to standard police use-of-force options such as pepper spray and batons.|$|E
25|$|In April 1941, the RAF {{sent two}} Spitfire Mark VA fighters to Dayton for testing. The variant used a {{pressurized}} cockpit for high-altitude pilot comfort—the pilot would not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> an oxygen mask. Kelsey ferried {{one of the}} aircraft to and from Los Angeles {{so that it could}} be examined further at a California facility. Because of the Spitfire's inherent range limitations, Kelsey was forced to make a number of refueling stops at little-used air fields. Kelsey noted engine overheating during taxiing and brake fade on long desert runways in the presence of significant crosswind. He found long cross-country flight very tiring due to the Spitfire's marginal stability (which gave it high maneuverability in combat.) Kelsey felt that the highly lauded fighter would not have been approved for purchase in the United States where requirements included long range.|$|E
25|$|Though Crosby {{did want}} {{more time to}} tend to his other {{business}} and leisure activities, he also sought better quality through recording, including being able to eliminate mistakes and control the timing of his show performances. Because his own Bing Crosby Enterprises produced the show, he could purchase the latest and best sound equipment and arrange the microphones his way; the logistics of microphone placement had long been a hotly debated issue in every recording studio {{since the beginning of}} the electrical era. No longer would he <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> the hated toupee on his head previously required by CBS and NBC for his live audience shows (he preferred a hat). He could also record short promotions for his latest investment, the world's first frozen orange juice, sold under the brand name Minute Maid. This investment allowed Crosby to make more money by finding a loophole whereby the IRS couldn't tax him at a 77% rate.|$|E

25|$|On October 28, 1995, Grunge {{had faced}} Richards, with a pre-match {{stipulation}} {{stating that the}} loser would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> a dress. Grunge won, meaning Richards was forced to wear the dress. Grunge would team up with partner Rocco Rock to form The Public Enemy, as they defeated Richards and Raven on November 3. The following night, Grunge's team would keep the advantage, as partners The Pitbulls and Tommy Dreamer defeated Cactus Jack, Raven and Richards in a Six-Man Tag Team match. In a preview for December to Dismember, The Pitbulls faced The Eliminators at November to Remember. The Pitbulls {{would go on to}} win the match after Kronus was pinned. The Eliminators got their revenge on November 25, winning in their return match against The Pitbulls. Raven would also face Tommy Dreamer on November 25, but in a Death Match, which Raven won. This eventually led to the Ultimate Jeopardy Steel Cage match at December to Dismember.|$|E
25|$|Their white jerseys have {{provided}} three basic color combinations, {{two of which}} have been previously alluded to in this article. The last combination consists of both white jerseys and pants. That particular combination surfaced in {{the first game of the}} 2003 season, when the team was coached by Steve Spurrier, during a nationally televised game against the New York Jets, which led many sports fans and Redskins faithful alike to point out that they had never seen that particular combination before. That year the Redskins wore it two more times. That look didn't appear again until midway through the 2005 season when the Redskins wore it in a road game against the St. Louis Rams. The Redskins won six straight games, including one in the playoffs against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, wearing that combination and the local media jokingly pointed out that the reason the Redskins were winning was their use of the white over white combination. In the NFC Divisional Playoff game against the eventual 2005 NFC Champion Seattle Seahawks, the Redskins wore the all-white uniforms, in hopes that they could keep their streak going; however, they lost 20–10. The Redskins continued to wear the white jerseys and white pants into the 2006 preseason. In the 2006 season, the Redskins started wearing black cleats, something that hadn't been done for quite a while. It was a surprise because they wore white cleats during the preseason. They would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> that color for the rest of the season, because the NFL usually asks teams to choose either black or white cleats to be worn throughout the season.|$|E

500|$|Operation Greif, {{commanded}} by Otto Skorzeny's 150th Panzer brigade, {{was designed to}} capture certain bridges over the Meuse River. Skorzeny was ordered to dress his brigade in American and British uniforms, while using Western Allied vehicles and speaking English, {{in an effort to}} not only capture those bridges, but to pass on false orders and confuse Allied forces defending the breakthrough sector. [...] The unit's men were not alerted to the intentions of the offensive until the very last minute; they were warned that their preparations were for an impending Allied offensive. The effort to recruit for the unit was nearly compromised by an army-wide order requesting the names of English-speaking personnel and any captured Allied vehicles; although Skorzeny originally attempted to cancel the operation, he later turned the misfortune around by allowing rumors of the unit to circulate freely in order to hide the truth. Skorzeny was also wary {{of the fact that he}} and his men would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> American uniforms, which risked having them shot as spies if captured; ultimately, his men were allowed to wear German uniforms under their American clothing.|$|E
