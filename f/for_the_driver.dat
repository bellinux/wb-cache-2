5|$|Several {{anti-noise}} {{and electric}} car advocates have opposed {{the introduction of}} artificial sounds as warning for pedestrians, as {{they argue that the}} proposed system will only increase noise pollution.

5|$|The {{upper body}} had a crew {{compartment}} with three bench seats, one <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> and his assistant, {{and two others}} for the crew.

A convertible canvas top was mounted above the rear storage compartments. It fastened to the windshield when erected.|$|E

5|$|After 1912 thirty-one M7 {{locomotives}} were {{equipped with}} push-pull train capabilities with {{the provision of}} a primitive cable and pulley device. This was a modification {{that was designed to}} save time on country branch lines where the locomotive would usually have to run around its train {{in order to make a}} return journey. As a result, it was possible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> to drive his train from a cab located at the front of a designated push-pull coach, leaving the fireman to tend the fire and operate the injectors on the locomotive footplate.|$|E
5|$|Soon thereafter, {{a number}} of A-10 ground-attack {{aircraft}} arrived but {{found it difficult to}} pinpoint enemy targets and began dropping flares to illuminate the zone. One of these flares landed on a friendly vehicle, and although the vehicle radioed in its position, it was hit by an AGM-65 Maverick air-to-ground missile that killed the entire crew except <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver.</b> Following the incident, the company was withdrawn and the remaining vehicles reorganized into another nearby company. With observation post 4 cleared, the Iraqi 6th Armored Brigade withdrew over the border to Al-Wafrah under heavy fire from Coalition aircraft. Coalition forces had lost 11 troops to friendly fire and none to enemy action.|$|E
5|$|The unnamed Driver {{works as}} a mechanic, a stunt double, a stunt driver, {{as well as a}} criminal-for-hire getaway car driver. His jobs are all managed by auto shop owner Shannon, who persuades Jewish mobsters Bernie Rose and Nino to {{purchase}} a car <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Driver</b> to race. The Driver meets his new neighbor, Irene, and grows close to her and her young son, Benicio. Their budding relationship is interrupted when Irene's husband, Standard Gabriel, is released from prison.|$|E

5|$|The {{upper body}} had a crew {{compartment}} {{common to all}} versions. This had bench seats, one <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> and his assistant, and another for the crew. The rear portion of the upper body was adapted for the vehicle's intended role. The artillery model had two extra bench seats for the gun's crew and space for its ammunition. The cargo version had just two storage compartments mounted {{in the front of}} the cargo compartment, one on each side, that opened to the outside. The windshield could fold forward and was also removable. A convertible canvas top was mounted at the upper part of the rear body. It fastened to the windshield when erected.|$|E
5|$|The {{report on}} the {{disaster}} indicated that it was necessary, with the signals concerned being on the right hand side of the train {{and because of the}} limited visibility from the left hand side of a steam locomotive, for either the fireman to observe those signals (but with the driver being responsible for asking him to do so) or <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> to cross over the footplate from his left hand driving position to observe them from the other side. In the event, the driver did neither, and neither driver nor fireman looked out for the aspect of the signals. The report ascribed blame to the driver, but recommended that the class be fitted with wider windscreens to improve visibility, noting that, in fog with less than 80 yards' visibility, the three signals involved would not be visible at all from the driver's side of the footplate; however, it noted that, even from a Schools class locomotive with its much smaller boiler, it was unlikely that these signals could be seen from the driver's side in the dense foggy conditions of the incident. The report did not suggest that poor lifting of smoke obstructed visibility.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{pressures}} of other projects, Jagger did not begin work on the memorial until the following year, by which time {{he had decided to}} alter the design. The revised memorial would be a third larger than before, cruciform in plan, and guarded by three bronze soldiers. Jagger initially intended to point the howitzer east, towards the Wellington Arch, but after much discussion—including advice from Lutyens and Sir Reginald Blomfield—it was agreed that the howitzer would point south to produce a pleasing silhouette from the park. A lengthy, year-long debate occurred within the RAWCF as to what inscription should be placed on the memorial, adding to the delay. Jagger then decided that the fourth side of the memorial should feature a dead soldier, a proposal which proved controversial. Although recumbent effigies were not uncommon on tombs and (to a lesser extent) war memorials, a sculpture of a dead soldier at eye level was an unusual and dramatic feature among First World War memorials—architects often preferred abstract, classical designs (such as the Cenotaph) or portrayed death through allegory. Jagger was adamant about the inclusion, even offering to pay for the casting of the additional figure himself. After considerable debate, the RAWCF agreed to the modification. Jagger's work continued to take longer than planned, partially due to shortages of staff, the need to approve each amendment to the plan and practical problems on the site itself. The names of his models for three of the statues are known: William Fosten <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Driver,</b> another ex-gunner called Metcalfe for the Ammunition Carrier, and Lieutenant Eugene Paul Bennett, VC, who fought in the same regiment as Jagger.|$|E
