5|$|<b>Genetic</b> <b>engineering</b> is the {{modification}} of an organism's genome through biotechnology. Since the 1970s, {{a variety of}} techniques have been developed to specifically add, remove and edit genes in an organism. Recently developed genome engineering techniques use engineered nuclease enzymes to create targeted DNA repair in a chromosome to either disrupt or edit a gene when the break is repaired. The related term synthetic biology is sometimes used to refer to extensive <b>genetic</b> <b>engineering</b> of an organism.|$|E
5|$|Scientific {{advances}} in <b>genetic</b> <b>engineering</b> led to developments in crops. Genetically modified crops introduce new traits to plants {{which they do}} not have naturally. These can bring benefits such as a decrease in the use of harmful pesticides, by building in qualities such as insect resistance and herbicide tolerance.|$|E

Spectacular computer animations of molecular processes are paired with extensive commentary by key researchers, including Genentech founder Herb Boyer, Stanford University biochemists Stan Cohen and Paul Berg, former Genentech scientist Dave Goeddel, Nobel Laureate Jim Watson, Harvard University molecular biologist Walter Gilbert, and Monsanto biochemist Bob Horsch...|$|R

5|$|Alternatively dsRNA can be {{supplied}} without <b>genetic</b> <b>engineering.</b> One {{approach is to}} add them to irrigation water. The molecules are absorbed into the plants' vascular system and poison insects feeding on them. Another approach involves spraying dsRNA like a conventional pesticide. This would allow faster adaptation to resistance. Such approaches would require low cost sources of dsRNAs that do not currently exist.|$|E
5|$|Functional {{genomics}} using RNAi is {{a particularly}} attractive technique for genomic mapping and annotation in plants because many plants are polyploid, which presents substantial challenges for more traditional <b>genetic</b> <b>engineering</b> methods. For example, RNAi has been successfully used for functional genomics studies in bread wheat (which is hexaploid) {{as well as more}} common plant model systems Arabidopsis and maize.|$|E
5|$|<b>Genetic</b> <b>engineering</b> is now {{a routine}} {{research}} tool with model organisms. For example, genes are easily added to bacteria and lineages of knockout mice with a specific gene's function disrupted are used to investigate that gene's function. Many organisms have been genetically modified for applications in agriculture, industrial biotechnology, and medicine.|$|E

5|$|A non-chemical {{vector control}} {{strategy}} involves genetic manipulation of malaria mosquitoes. Advances in <b>genetic</b> <b>engineering</b> technologies {{make it possible}} to introduce foreign DNA into the mosquito genome and either decrease the lifespan of the mosquito, or make it more resistant to the malaria parasite. Sterile insect technique is a genetic control method whereby large numbers of sterile male mosquitoes are reared and released.

5|$|Artificial {{selection}} is the intentional selection of traits {{in a population}} of organisms. This {{has been used for}} thousands of years in the domestication of plants and animals. More recently, such selection has become a vital part of <b>genetic</b> <b>engineering,</b> with selectable markers such as antibiotic resistance genes being used to manipulate DNA. Proteins with valuable properties have evolved by repeated rounds of mutation and selection (for example modified enzymes and new antibodies) in a process called directed evolution.|$|E
5|$|At the park's visitor center, {{the group}} learns that the cloning was {{accomplished}} by extracting dinosaur DNA from mosquitoes that had been preserved in amber.

5|$|Biotechnology in {{the modern}} sense of <b>genetic</b> <b>engineering</b> began in the 1970s, with the {{invention}} of recombinant DNA techniques. Restriction enzymes were discovered and characterized in the late 1960s, following {{on the heels of}} the isolation, then duplication, then synthesis of viral genes. Beginning with the lab of Paul Berg in 1972 (aided by EcoRI from Herbert Boyer's lab, building on work with ligase by Arthur Kornberg's lab), molecular biologists put these pieces together to produce the first transgenic organisms. Soon after, others began using plasmid vectors and adding genes for antibiotic resistance, greatly increasing the reach of the recombinant techniques.|$|E

Blade Runner is also cited as an important influence to both the style and story of the Ghost in the Shell film series, which itself has been highly influential to the future-noir genre. Blade Runner has been very influential to the cyberpunk movement. It also influenced the cyberpunk derivative biopunk, which revolves around biotechnology and <b>genetic</b> <b>engineering.</b>|$|E

40|$|Throughout human history, natural {{products}} {{have been the}} basis for the discovery and development of therapeutics, cosmetic and food compounds used in industry. Many compounds found in natural organisms are rather difficult to chemically synthesize and to extract in large amounts, and in this respect, <b>genetic</b> and metabolic <b>engineering</b> are playing an increasingly important role in the production of these compounds, such as new terpenes and terpenoids, which may potentially be used to create aromas in industry.
