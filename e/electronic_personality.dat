40|$|Digital {{services}} require {{personal information}} {{for a variety}} of reasons. Due to advances in communication technology, new types of services are evolving alongwith traditional Internet services. Due to the diversity of services, the traditional approaches to personal information handling designed for Internet services are inadequate. Therefore, new approaches are necessary. In this thesis, a solution where personal information is stored in and accessed from the user's mobile device is presented. This approach is called Mobile <b>Electronic</b> <b>Personality</b> (ME). The ME approach is compared to the existing approaches which rely on a database either at a service, a trusted third party or a client program. Various personal information properties are taken into account in the comparison of storage locations. The thesis presents both the internal and the communication architecture of the ME. The internal architecture defines how the information is stored in the mobile device. The communication architecture defines how the information can be accessed by different types of services from the ME. The use of the architecture is described for services in different environments. A simple ME based solution for the authentication of a user is defined. The authentication of service, which is required to protect the privacy of the users is also presented...|$|E

However, people still doubt whether they would be benefited more from the virtual world than that of in the real world. This paper aims to {{better understanding of how}} personality traits affect the acceptance of e-finance by incorporating personality traits into the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model. Our findings suggest that personality traits have significant moderating effects on influencing behavioural intentions. Since the effects of human traits on their behavioural intentions might vary under different circumstances, different context or different cultures. The similarities and the differences are also discussed. e-finance; <b>electronic</b> finance; <b>personality</b> traits; online stocking; five factors model; unified theory of acceptance and use of technology; UTAUT model; online finance. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{explored the}} contribution of extracurricular sport and screen time viewing (television viewing and <b>electronic</b> gaming) to <b>personality</b> trait stability and change during childhood. Two independent samples of 3, 956 young children (age 6) and 3, 862 older children (age 10) {{were taken from the}} Longitudinal Study of Australian Children. Parent-reported child sport participation, screen time, and personality traits were measured at baseline and again 24 months later. Young children who were more active recorded more of a decrease in introversion, less of a decrease in persistence, and less of an increase in reactivity, than those who were less active. Older children who were more active recorded less of an increase in introversion and more of an increase in persistence than those who were less active. In addition, young children who continued participation in extracurricular sport had greater intra-individual stability of personality for introversion. These finding suggest that an active lifestyle might help to facilitate desirable personality trait stability and change during childhood...|$|R
40|$|Research Problem: The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to discover the factors that influence a New Zealand lawyer’s use of and ability to develop effective electronic information seeking behaviour. There have been no previous studies undertaken in New Zealand to understand the cognitive reasons and the reasons directly related to the resources themselves that impact on why lawyers do, or do not look for information effectively from electronic resources. Methodology: A phenomenological study design was used in order to understand an event from the viewpoint of the participants. Nine New Zealand lawyers participated, providing demographic information and taking part in semi-structured interviews. In addition two of these lawyers took part in a further participant observation. Results: The results indicated that factors personal to the applicant such as their previous training, <b>electronic</b> experience, <b>personality</b> and age have an impact on their ability to develop effective electronic information seeking behaviour. In addition external factors such as cost, time and lack of access directly related to electronic resources also have an impact. Implications: Based on the findings of this report it was found that electronic resources were considered to be an important part of a lawyer’s work and gaining increasing significance. However not all lawyers have the ability to make full use of these electronic resources. Therefore it is important that lawyers are provided with the opportunity to undertake appropriate training and to access high quality electronic resources. Further study needs to be undertaken to look at strategies and training methods required by lawyers and their employers to improve these skills...|$|R
40|$|Personalised {{ubiquitous}} {{services have}} rapidly proliferated due technological advancements in sensing, ubiquitous and mobile computing. Evolving societal trends, {{business and the}} economic potential of Personal Information (PI) have overlapped the service niches. At the same time, the societal thirst for more personalised services has increased and are met by soliciting deeper and more privacy invasive PI from customers. Consequentially, reinforcing traditional privacy challenges and unearthed new risks that render classical safeguards ine ective. The absence of solutions to criticise personalised ubiquitous services from privacy perspectives, aggravates the situation. This thesis presents a solution permitting users' PI, stored in their mobile terminals to be disclosed to services in privacy preserving manner for personalisation needs. The approach termed, Mobile <b>Electronic</b> <b>Personality</b> Version 2 (ME 2. 0), is compared to alternative mechanisms. Within ME 2. 0, PI handling vulnerabilities of ubiquitous services are identi ed and sensitised on their practices and privacy implications. Vulnerability where PI may leak through covert solicits, excessive acquisitions and legitimate data re-purposing to erode users privacy are also considered. In this thesis, the design, components, internal structures, architectures, scenarios and evaluations of ME 2. 0 are detailed. The design addresses implications and challenges leveraged by mobile terminals. ME 2. 0 components and internal structures discusses the functions related to how PI pieces are stored and handled by terminals and services. The architecture focusses on di erent components and their exchanges with services. Scenarios where ME 2. 0 is used are presented from di erent environment views, before evaluating for performance, privacy and usability...|$|E
40|$|My MFA project {{consists}} of sculptural installations, videos and images that, {{together with the}} written text, comment {{on the impact of}} information technology on society. In both the written and practical components, I refer to my own experience and developments in fashion and access to information technology (IT) in my home country, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), with a focus on Kinshasa. I also explore aspects of the consumerist nature of IT in Africa more broadly and how this generates trends relating to ‘FOMO’, an internet slang acronym for the Fear Of Missing Out. My primary reason for connecting African fashion with contemporary computer technology is because both concern Western products being utilised in Africa in the context of self-determination. The African continent is a source of mining wealth, for example coltan (short for columbite-tantalite), a mineral widely used in technology. The DRC {{is one of the major}} coltan-producing countries, and yet it is technologically underdeveloped or limited itself because of an oppressive capitalist system (Pole Institute – blood minerals [PI], 2010 : 8 - 9), (PI, 2010). However, some of these minerals return to Africa in the form of products and create new consumers, desires and services in emerging contemporary technology contexts. In the process of upgrading to higher levels of technology, the developed world often uses Africa as a dumping zone for electronic waste (e-waste), with no regard for the environmental and human impact. For example, the UN environment programme's 2012 and 2013 report under the Waste for Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) legislation showed that thirty percent of the allegedly second-hand products imported to Ghana were useless (African WEEE Report by the UN Environment Programme [AWRUNEP], 2012). Pieter Hugo's photographs in the book Permanent Error (2011) provide strong visual evidence of this. Although I’m aware of the debate around issues of representation and ‘afro pessimism’ generated by Hugo’s images, my motivation in using them is that they provide sufficient documentation of the realities of disposing of electronic waste and the impact on people and the environment pertaining to those particulars zones of Africa. I draw an analogy between the consumption of IT and African fashion, and specifically with my own country's culture of dressing-up, which has developed into a kind of doctrine (the ‘cult of the cloth’) and an expression of resistance. The analogy is linked to the desire to stay up to date with IT, which can lead to addiction. I also consider it useful to compare the symbolic and aesthetic aspects of African customs of hairdressing, the wearing of hats and jewellery, and even body modification as a social identification with today's society, within which ‘personal media’ are additional accessories for urban status. My reference and use of computer parts critique the way that contemporary technology has become an extension of our personal style, as in the fashion sense described above: a virtual identification which could also suggest a tendency towards an alienation of the body (because of the virtual social interaction and virtual identity) from its immediate environment that has manifested in our current psychological landscape. Consequently, I suggest the consumption of contemporary media in urban spaces opens up the notion of virtual anthropology or virtual cultural anthropology, related to the <b>electronic</b> <b>personality</b> or e-personality...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the study}} was to examine how {{personality}} relates to the consumption of alcohol and cigarettes during pregnancy. Methods: The thesis uses a subset of data collected previously for the study Medication use and related factors in pregnancy, headed by the School of Pharmacy, University of Oslo in collaboration with the Division of Mental Health at the National Institute of Public Health. The present study includes data from 9, 187 women from 19 countries. Both pregnant women (53. 8 %) and women with children under one year of age (46. 2 %) were included. Data was collected with an <b>electronic</b> questionnaire. <b>Personality</b> was assessed with the Big Five Inventory. Additionally, maternal background information and alcohol and nicotine habits were included in the analysis. Results and conclusion: High levels of conscientiousness and agreeableness acted as protective factors against continued alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Conscientiousness was also positively related to pregnant women quitting smoking altogether instead of merely reducing consumption. High levels of neuroticism were a risk factor for continued smoking during pregnancy. Women scoring high on openness to experience were more likely to quit smoking, but had a tendency to continue drinking. The trait of extraversion was unrelated to both smoking and drinking during pregnancy. The analysis of possible interaction effects between region of residency, personality, and smoking and drinking behavior, revealed that behavioral correlates to personality were culturally sensitive. Outcome was, at least in some instances, moderated by region of residency. Further, pregnant women with high scores on agreeableness, conscientiousness, or openness, had a greater chance to concurrently report smoking cigarettes than those with lower trait levels. The findings of this study point to the importance of personality and culture with regard to providing adequate pre- and postnatal health care...|$|R
