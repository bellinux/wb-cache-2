The Cinque Ports Flying Club re-established itself in {{facilities}} left by the RAF and re-opened on 12 July. The club possessed two Tiger Moths and an Auster. The first post-war air races were the Folkestone Trophy and the Lympne High Speed Handicap held over the weekend of 31 August and 1 September. The Folkestone Trophy was won by John Grierson <b>flying</b> <b>a</b> Supermarine Walrus (G-AHFN). The Lympne High Speed Handicap was won by W Humble <b>flying</b> <b>a</b> Hawker Fury I. Charter airline Air Kruise (Kent) Ltd was established at Lympne by Wing Commander Hugh Kennard and in September it was reported that the company had received the first civilian Miles Messenger aircraft.

5|$|A flying ace or fighter ace is a {{military}} aviator credited with shooting down five or more enemy aircraft during aerial combat (The Germans traditionally set the threshold at 10 victories.). During World War II, hundreds of German Luftwaffe fighter pilots achieved this feat flying contemporary piston engine fighter aircraft. However, only 28 pilots are credited with shooting down five or more enemy aircraft while <b>flying</b> <b>a</b> jet-powered aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Assuming this {{warning shot}} {{had been fired}} {{in the belief that}} his brig, which was not <b>flying</b> <b>a</b> flag, may be an enemy vessel, Barlow ordered the British naval ensign and the pennant of the Channel Fleet run up. Thus clearly {{identified}} as a neutral British warship, Barlow allowed Childers to drift closer inshore with the tide. The French battery responded by raising tricolour flags and red pennants, a move copied by the other batteries covering the Goulet. Having drifted much closer to two batteries Childers suddenly came under heavy fire, the batteries containing very large 48-pounder cannon.|$|E

5|$|In response, German {{submarines}} flowed {{out of the}} Baltic to Norway {{through the}} mined coastal waters, close to the Swedish coast. Coastal Command's No. 16 Group and No. 18 Group RAF had success against these submarines in April and May 1945. German crews travelled on the surface, for fear of mines, exposing them to air attack. Mosquitoes and Beaufighters from the two groups sunk several vessels. The last kill took place on 7 May 1945, when Flight Lieutenant K. Murray, <b>flying</b> <b>a</b> No. 210 Squadron RAF Catalina, crippled U-320. The submarine foundered two days later with all hands.|$|E

In {{the first half}} of 1943, 12 Nachtschlachtgruppen ("night battle groups") had been formed, <b>flying</b> <b>a</b> {{multitude}} of different types of aircraft, including the Ju 87, which proved itself ideally suited to the low-level slow flying needed.|$|E

With the agreement of de Havilland senior, Cunningham took the dead pilot's post which earned him £2,000 per year.|$|E

5|$|About {{the time}} of the {{completion}} of the Alaska Railroad {{and the beginning of the}} dredging era in Fairbanks, Alaska's aviation industry began to take off. The first airplane flight in Alaska took place in Fairbanks on July 4, 1913, when a barnstormer flew from a field south of town. The aircraft had been crated and sent from Seattle via Skagway and Whitehorse. The pilot subsequently tried to sell the aircraft, but had no takers. Alaska's first commercial aircraft didn't arrive until June 1923, when Noel Wien began <b>flying</b> <b>a</b> Curtiss JN-4 on mail routes between Fairbanks and isolated communities. From Fairbanks, Wien became the first person to fly to Anchorage and cross the Arctic Circle in an airplane.|$|E
