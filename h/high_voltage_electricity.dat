500|$|The French translation, {{published}} in 1752, contained an experiment {{suggesting that a}} long, pointed iron rod would attract a lightning bolt from a thunderstorm cloud. In 1750 Hopkinson suggested to Franklin the concept that electricity is attracted to points. Franklin then carried the idea a step forward and surmised that a pointed iron rod high above a rooftop would attract a lightning bolt, if the bolt was of electricity. Frenchman Thomas-Francois d'Alibald did the actual experiment May 10, 1752, as Franklin had suggested and lightning struck the iron rod. In London it was repeated in Spital Square on July 20, 1752, and again in Chelmsford, Essex, on August 12, 1752. The electricity attraction from a lightning storm was also done by Franklin himself in the kite experiment that he talked about {{in a letter to}} Collinson dated October 19, 1752. A {{man by the name of}} G. W. Richman was killed in 1753 from electrocution doing the kite experiment. Franklin had proven that lightning bolts and electricity were one and the same. He also showed that this [...] "electric fluid" [...] was attracted to a sharply pointed object high in the sky. An iron rod could have the other end put into the ground to create a path for safe conduction of the <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>electricity.</b> Thus, a way of diverting lightning bolts from wooden buildings [...] and preventing them from going aflame due to lightning hits [...] had been discovered. Franklin's lightning conductor invention, with its lightning rod uppermost point, became a model for the lightning-protection system used in America in the eighteenth century.|$|E

In 1777, Lichtenberg built a large electrophorus to generate <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> static <b>electricity</b> through induction. After discharging a <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> point to the surface of an insulator, he recorded the resulting radial patterns by sprinkling various powdered materials onto the surface.

50|$|Electricity is hazardous: an {{electric}} shock from a current {{as low as}} 35 milliamps is sufficient to cause fibrillation of the heart in vulnerable individuals. Even a healthy individual is at risk of falling from a high structure due to loss of muscle control. Higher currents can cause respiratory failure and result in extensive and life-threatening burns. The first recorded human fatality occurred in 1879 when a stage carpenter in Lyon, France touched a 250 volt wire.

30|$|To {{efficiently}} operate such a system, {{one solution}} is to segment the energy network and control the sub-networks asynchronously on a distribution network level (Stöcker 2018). A district-level distributed MES is an ideal representative of such a sub-network, because the complexity of its operation is reduced in comparison to a system that involves management of a <b>higher</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>electricity</b> network. A district heating network and other bi-directional distributed energy resources (DERs), such as electric vehicles, batteries and hydrogen storages, could also be added on top to form a district MES. Another solution to answer the increasing demand for flexible power is a Transactive Energy System (TES). Via a set of economic and controllable mechanisms, in particular price signals (Perez-Arriaga and Bharatkumar 2014), which balance the supply and demand of power over time across an entire electrical infrastructure, a TES enhances the value for transacting parties while being consistent with the overall system reliability (Tesfatsion 2018). Our project combines the said two solutions together for efficient operation of MES. We integrate the pricing-based TES methods to a district-level MES, to optimize the technical operation as well as maximize the utility function for each consumer. As consumers demand constant and real-time transparency as well as accurate billing on their energy consumption for a sustained demand reduction (Darby 2006), blockchain technology is adopted here for instant and transparent settlement.|$|R
