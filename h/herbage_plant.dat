Species populations, community structure and habitat attributes were measured at six sites comprising of 3 habitat types (2 sites per habitat); namely Acaciagrassland, North-facing and South-facing sloped sites. Seasonal variation was investigated at the Acacia sites during late summer (April) and winter months (July). Five habitat attributes were measured; percentages of total cover and <b>herbage,</b> <b>plant</b> litter depth (cm), height of dominant vegetation type measured (m) and edaphic condition were recorded at 15 randomly selected traps per site. Almonds (Prunus dulcis), baobabs (Adansonia digitata), mopane (Colophospermum mopane), and Acacia tortilis seeds {{were used in the}} predation and dispersal experiment. North- and South-facing sites were dominated by Aethomys sp. while Acacia sites were dominated by Mastomys natalensis. Seed predation was high at the North-facing slopes, with a significant difference in predation on A. tortilis seeds. Seed dispersal activity was low; no, scatter hoarding was identified; only larder hoarding was observed by Aethomys sp. and M. natalensis at North-facing sites and Acacia sites respectively. Trampling by megaherbivore activity impacted vegetation structure and has negatively affected rodent population and ground activity, particularly at the Acacia sites...|$|E
40|$|Many grazing {{animals are}} solely or mostly {{dependent}} for their dietary needs and essential minerals on the forage available, either {{in its natural}} state or conserved as hay or silage. A soil and plant survey {{was carried out in}} May 2014, incorporating 100 sampling points, in the area of Manjača and Vlašić Mountains in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Main investigated soil types in the area were Cambisol, Fluvisol, and Leptosol, while botanical composition consisted of wide range of species, mainly of the families Poaceae, Leguminosae, Plantaginaceae, Scrophulariaceae, Asteraceae, Fabaceae, Polygonaceae, Violaeeae, Lamiaceae, Euphorbiaceae,. In total sixty one different species of legumes, herbs and grasses were identified, of which some were categorized as worthless and harmful as animal feed. This study was conducted to investigate the nutrient and trace element status of soil and <b>herbage</b> <b>plants</b> in the sampling area, and to examine the concentrations observed for their potential influence on animal performance. Soil parameters, such are texture, trace element concentrations, pH, SOC, and plant type were considered as a factors affecting trace element concentrations in the forage plants. The soil pH varied from strongly acidic to moderately alkaline. Percentage of SOC varied from 0. 5 % to 12. 3 %. Soil texture analysis showed that most of the soil samples were high in silt content. The average concentrations of sodium, phosphorus, zinc, selenium, copper, cobalt, and boron were low in both soil and <b>herbage</b> <b>plants.</b> Plant potassium, calcium, magnesium, molybdenum, and manganese concentrations were sufficiently high to meet the requirements of animals, while iron concentrations were even elevated in same sampled areas. High levels of molybdenum have been found in both soil and plants, which may be plant toxic, however, effect on animal is not determined. In conclusion, imbalances observed in natural pastures of Manjača and Vlašić area, caused by low soil trace element status, and other soil and plant properties, could impair animal performance in the studied area.

40|$|General Description: A clump-forming {{perennial}} herb {{with both}} hairy and glandular <b>herbage.</b> <b>Plants</b> have one to many erect stems, generally 6 to 12 inches tall, from a taproot and branched rootstock. The {{leaves of the}} basal cluster are largest (up to 5 inches long), the blade being about twice {{the length of the}} petiole. The blades are about twice as long as broad and are divided into 4 to 9 paired lobes, each lobe being again incised up to two thirds of the way to the middle. The stem leaves gradually become smaller upward. Each stem has a 2 to 5 inch, branched, tightly packed cluster of flowers. The flowers are restricted to the upper side of the branches. Flowers are about 1 / 4 inch long with white petals and exerted stamens with conspicuous purple filaments which turn brown with age. The capsules develop within the persistent flowers, producing 15 - 20 small black seeds. Identification Tips: Phacelia lenta can be distinguished from other members of the genus occurring within its range by the following combination of characters: a clump-forming perennial with glandular herbage, bipinnatifid leaves, persistent white corollas, and long-exserted stamens with purple filaments. Phenology: Flower bud formation probably begins by mid-April, with most plants reaching full bloom by mid-May. Some individuals may have flowers present as late as mid-June. Fruit capsules begin to develop in early June. In the more advanced individuals, dehiscence may occur as early as late June. Range: The taxon is currently known only from Douglas County, WA, from an area approximately 12 x 8 miles. The type specimen was collected from the “Bare hills of Columbia River, Washington Territory. ” It is impossible to ascertain whether this was from Douglas County or elsewhere along the Columbia River. However, recent searches of suitable habitat have not located the taxon outside of Douglas County. The species is restricted to the Columbia Basin physiographic province. Habitat: Phacelia lenta is endemic to a small area of the arid Columbia Basin region. It occurs on cliff crevices and adjacen...|$|R
40|$|Forage {{digestibility}} of berseem clover (Trifolium Alexandrinum L.) {{is influenced}} by plant cell wall composition. This {{study was conducted to}} evaluate the effects of different cutting treatments on cell-wall components of the <b>herbage</b> and <b>plant</b> fractions in two Mediterranean berseem genotypes during growth and {{to examine the relationship between}} digestibility and cell wall components in these plant fractions. Cutting treatments were initiated at sixth internode elongation (A) and early flowering (B) and there was an uncut control treatment (C). Spring growth of genotypes of Egyptian (cv. Giza 10) and Italian (cv. Sacromonte) origins was harvested in each of two years beginning 196 days after sowing and thereafter every 6 days (twelve harvests in total) to measure cell wall components. Neutral detergent fibre (NDF), acid detergent fibre (ADF) and acid detergent lignin (ADL) concentrations were determined for leaf, stem, and total forage of each cultivar at each harvest. Without defoliation, NDF, ADF and ADL concentrations of herbage increased linearly to a maximum of 528, 375 and 84 g kg- 1 DM, respectively, by 220 days after planting, when plant height reached maximum values, then plateaued until 257 days after planting. Plant parts differed in cell-wall concentration, with stems being of higher fibre components than leaves, in the two cutting treatments. <b>Herbage</b> and <b>plant</b> fraction fibre concentrations were negatively correlated with digestibility for all cutting treatments. Defoliation induced a reduction in fibre concentrations and plant height, although a rapid regrowth was observed after cutting, in both treatments A and B. However, delaying defoliation to the early flowering stage (B) increased fibre components concentrations both at cutting time and during the growing season and significantly reduced the regrowth height. Conversely, plants cut at the sixth internode elongation (treatment A) showed lower concentrations of fibre fractions than initiating cutting at early flower (treatment B). Therefore, harvest management in which cuts are applied at the stage of sixth internode elongation appears to be the most favourable for obtaining forage of lower fibre content in berseem clover grown in Mediterranean regions...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT An {{intensive}} grazing in the dwarf-late (DL) elephant grass pasture in a rainy season was conducted under the rotational grazing system. Four paddocks of DL elephant grass pasture, {{which had a}} 5 (20 m × 25 m) of area/paddock, were grazed at 3 cycles of one-week grazing with 3 -week rest period by 3 heads of breeding beef cows from May to November 2003. The plant height, leaf area index and ratio of leaf blade to stem were the highest, while tiller number increased and herbage mass tended to increase as grazing accured, except for the first grazing cycle. Herbage consumption, rate of herbage consumption and dry matter intake tended to decrease in three paddocks from the first to the third cycle. The average of dry matter intake was 10. 2 - 14. 5 g DM/kg/LW/day over the four paddocks and the average daily gain was 0. 09 kg/head day. The carrying capacities was estimated at 1016 (annual total 1224 CD/ha). Thus, DL elephant grass pasture can expand the grazing period for beef cows in a rainy season.

40|$|A grazing {{strategy}} {{is a plan}} for accomplishing a set of objectives based on comprehensive knowledge of available resources, and the production and marketing environment. Management can be greatly simplified when grazing strategies are based on clearly stated and prioritized resource-management and livestock-production objectives (Fig. I). Decisions on {{when and how to}} use plant resources have profound effects on the success of grazing strategies. Plant resources can be used for livestock production or wildlife cover and ecosystem functions such as hydrologic condition and site stability. While many rangelands in the central and northern Great Plains are dominated by grasses and grass-like species, shrubs and forbs also are potentially valuable sources of nutrients and cover in these ecosystems. All of the above-ground, non-woody growth of plants is collectively called herbage, regardless of palatability. Livestock and wildlife also may consume browse, defined as the palatable portions of woody plant growth. Forage is composed of palatable <b>herbage</b> and woody <b>plant</b> growth that are accessible to the grazing animal. Efficient use of <b>herbage</b> and woody <b>plant</b> growth can be evaluated only when all management objectives related to plant resources are clearly understood (Fig. I). For example, if sustaining a prairie-grouse population is one of the resource-management objectives, uneven distribution of grazing may leave enough standing herbage in parts of pastures to provide adequate nesting cover. In contrast, if livestock production is the major objective, uniform grazing distribution becomes important. If adequate distribution cannot be accomplished with strategically-placed water or salting locations, cross fencing areas into smaller pastures and/or increasing livestock density with rotation-grazing systems may be effective methods of accomplishing livestock production objectives. Grazing systems define periods of grazing and non-grazing. They are important tools for executing grazing strategies. When different grazing systems have similar likelihood of accomplishing a prioritized set of objectives, the simplest system generally is the most economically and ecologically efficient...|$|R

Four 0. 05 of DL elephant grass pastures (20 × 25 m) were established on May 2003. They were rotationally grazed for 1 week, followed by a 3 -week rest period by three breeding or raising beef cattle for three and six cycles during {{the first and second}} years of establishment respectively. Before grazing, the plant height, leaf area index and the ratio of leaf blade to stem were at the highest, while tiller number increased and herbage mass tended to increase, except for the first grazing cycle both two years and for one paddock in the second year. Herbage consumption, the rate of herbage consumption and dry matter intake tended to decrease in three paddocks from the first to the third cycle in the first year, but increase as grazing occurred in the second year. Dry matter intake averaged 10. 2 - 14. 5 and 15. 4 – 23. 2 g DM/kg/live weight (LW) /day over the four paddocks in the first and second year, respectively, and average daily gains were 0. 09 and 0. 35 kg/head/day in the first and second year respectively.

In this review, effects of synthesis of conjugated linoleic (CLA) and linolenic (CLNA) acid isomers in the rumen, effects of the lipids in <b>herbage,</b> and <b>plant</b> endogenous factors on synthesis of nutraceutical fatty acids are discussed. Discovery of beneficial FA in ruminant products, such as CLA and other omega- 3 FA, stimulated many studies in the last 20 years, including those on the roles of minor FA intermediates on rumen BH and mammary gland Metabolism. Much of this research was targeted at identifying the intermediates formed during BH as well as the rumen microbial ecology involved in these processes. However, shifting the research to feedstuff endogenous factors which influence lipolysis (LP) and losses of polyunsaturated FA in the rumen may be of interest in identifying nutritional strategies to manipulate FA profiles in ruminant products. The presence of FA with healthful properties in milk or meat from ruminants can be enhanced by inclusion of fresh forages in their diet. Hence, there is increasing interest in the crucial role of endogenous LP, plant secondary metabolites (PSM) and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) on ruminal BH. To better understand the pathways through which PSM or PPO impact FA metabolism, characterization of lipids in fresh forages suggests the important role of the diet matrix on the ruminal fate of lipids.

40|$|The {{investigation}} {{which has}} been dealt with in this paper {{is a continuation of}} earlier work carried out in 1932 on species of grasses grown on separate plots and exposed to the same climatic conditions while being subjected to the following system of cutting: A portion of each plot was cut at monthly intervals, another portion of the plot was cut at two-monthly intervals, a third portion at three-monthly intervals, and so on, up to twelve months, when a sample of twelve months’ growth was taken off each plot. The grass resulting from each cutting was weighed when air-dry and sampled for analytical purposes. The constituents determined were crude protein, crude fibre, phosphorus, calcium, potassium, magnesium, sodium, and chlorine, while the determination of soluble or silica-free ash was included {{towards the end of the}} investigation. Detailed data relating to all the cuts obtained from individual species from February, 1933, to February, 1934, are tabulated in an appendix. Average values for all the species combined have been chosen as a basis for discussion. (1) Grasses cut at monthly intervals are highest in percentage phosphorus and crude protein and lowest in percentage crude fibre. With decreased frequency of cutting the crude fibre content rises to a maximum at maturity, while the phosphorus and crude protein contents drop markedly to minima in the old mature herbage cut prior to the commencement of new growth in the following season. (2) The different frequencies of cutting do not appreciably influence the lime and magnesia contents of the herbage. (3) Pure species grown on the same soil and exposed to the same climatic conditions show appreciable differences in mineral and protein content when harvested after definite intervals, e. g. one month. (4) Fluctuations in the chemical composition of species cut at, say, monthly intervals during the growing season are indicated. These variations are attributed mainly to the stage of growth attained by the species and to the rainfall in so far as it influences the stage of growth. (5) Rainfall is the most important factor governing the yield from monthly cuts. (6) During dry seasons the phosphorus content of herbage cut at monthly intervals tends to be low. At the same time the percentage lime is high. The crude protein content does not appear to be adversely affected by drought. (7) The percentage of mineral constituents and crude protein are low and crude fibre high during seasons of plentiful rain. (8) Cutting at monthly intervals impairs the persistency of most species, Pennisetum ciliare and Cynodon dactylon being the only grasses not visibly affected by the severe treatment. (9) The highest yield of dry matter is obtained from pasture species by cutting at two-monthly intervals during the growing season. The evidence suggests that while the yield from fewer cuts or a single harvest may not be much smaller the herbage will definitely be of lower nutritive value. (10) The aggregate production of crude protein and phosphate is highest by cutting at two-monthly intervals. (11) The difference in nutritive value between herbage cut at monthly and two-monthly intervals becomes insignificant during seasons of dry weather conditions. (12) The date on which a system of cutting is initiated is found to exercise a determining influence on the productiveness of <b>herbage</b> <b>plants</b> in the course of the growing season. The production of dry matter seems to be depressed by a first cut during the period when active growth commences. (13) The practical suggestion which is a corollary to this investigation is that an attempt should be made to prevent natural pastures from growing undisturbed during the entire season if economic utilization of such pasture is to be made. Provided the effects of periodic cutting are at all comparable with grazing by animals this object appears to be attainable by following a system of management in which the pasture is grazed down at least once every two months during the active growing season depending, of course, on the prevailing climatic conditions and the botanical composition of the pasture.

The long-term objective {{of this study is}} to assess and estimate cover crop effectiveness such as green manure, weed depression and soil conservation. In this paper, spatial distribution of herb species and herbage mass was estimated. A ground based hyperspectral imaging, which is useful for acquiring field information, was employed to monitor the cover crop field (bristle oat and hairy vetch). In order to generate the maps of <b>herbage</b> mass, first, <b>plant</b> portions were extracted from hyperspectral images by NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) threshold. Next, they were classified into plant species using linear discriminant models. Finally, the herbage mass of each plant species was estimated individually using partial least squares regression model, and mapped with gradient colors depending on the estimated value. The results show that the success rate of plant area extraction was 100 % and the success rate of the plant species classification was 78. 7 %. With regards to the result of the herbage mass estimation, the model that used both plant pixel spectra and plant cover rate as explanatory variables had the highest and most stable accuracy than the other models. The maps of <b>plant</b> species and <b>herbage</b> mass reflected the actual spatial distribution on the field. It was demonstrated that the hyperspectral imaging system developed in this study is a useful technique for monitoring the cover crop...|$|R
40|$|Historical {{stocking}} {{methods of}} continuous, season-long grazing of pastures with little account of growing conditions have caused some degradation within grazed landscapes in northern Australia. Alternative stocking {{methods have been}} implemented to address this degradation and raise the productivity and profitability of the principal livestock, cattle. Because information comparing stocking methods is limited, an evaluation was undertaken to quantify the effects of stocking methods on pastures, soils and grazing capacity. The approach was to monitor existing stocking methods on nine commercial beef properties in north and south Queensland. Environments included native and exotic pastures and eucalypt (lighter soil) and brigalow (heavier soil) land types. Breeding and growing cattle were grazed under each method. The owners/managers, formally trained in pasture and grazing management, made all management decisions affecting the study sites. Three stocking methods were compared: continuous (with rest), extensive rotation and intensive rotation (commonly referred to as 'cell grazing'). There were two or three stocking methods examined on each property: in total 21 methods (seven continuous, six extensive rotations and eight intensive rotations) were monitored over 74 paddocks, between 2006 and 2009. Pasture and soil surface measurements {{were made in the}} autumns of 2006, 2007 and 2009, while the paddock grazing was analysed from property records for the period from 2006 to 2009. The first 2 years had drought conditions (rainfall average 3. 4 decile) but were followed by 2 years of above-average rainfall. There were no consistent differences between stocking methods across all sites over the 4 years for <b>herbage</b> mass, <b>plant</b> species composition, total and litter cover, or landscape function analysis (LFA) indices. There were large responses to rainfall in the last 2 years with mean herbage mass in the autumn increasing from 1970 kg DM ha(- 1) in 2006 - 07 to 3830 kg DM ha(- 1) in 2009. Over the same period, ground and litter cover and LFA indices increased. Across all sites and 4 years, mean grazing capacity was similar for the three stocking methods. There were, however, significant differences in grazing capacity between stocking methods at four sites but these differences were not consistent between stocking methods or sites. Both the continuous and intensive rotation methods supported the highest average annual grazing capacity at different sites. The results suggest that cattle producers can obtain similar ecological responses and carry similar numbers of livestock under any of the three stocking methods...|$|R
40|$|It {{has always}} been {{difficult}} to find forage legumes with the production characteristics that can help maximise animal performance, and that are also adapted to the alternating wet and dry seasons of the subhumid zone of africa. Among the characters in demand are drought tolerance, good <b>herbage</b> production and <b>plant</b> persistence, either through regeneration after burning or heavy grazing or through self-seeding. Ideally they should also provide a good quality, standing hay crop that will help sustain aniamls through the dry season. Another important attribute is disease resistance, because the wet season usually provides conditions ideal for disease development and advancement. Stylosanthes spp. have many of the qualities demanded by African conditions but disease, in particular anthrracnose, caused by the fungus Colletotrichum gloeosporoides, has restricted their use. One species, S. hamata cv Verano, a selection made by scientists from Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, combines disease resistance with the other favourable agronomic characteristics. This species has been widely planted in the tropics and {{has the potential for}} even further spread. However, whether Verano's disease resistance will be maintained is uncertain; if new virulent strains of anthracnose arise, they could nullify all the advantages of Verano-based pasture improvement. Because if this threat, ILCA scientists have screened a range of potentially useful Stylosanthes spp. that could either outperform, or substitute for Verano if its disease resistance breaks down. This paper gives details of their agronomic performance and disease resistance, and identifies four accessions that show promise for the subhumid zone...|$|R

This {{study was conducted to}} investigate the morphological, agronomic and oil content characteristics of Iranian mint landraces using twelve landraces, three of which belong to Mentha longifolia, and the remaining, Mentha spicata L, originated from central regions of Iran. Days to 50 % and 100 % flowering, plant height, number of lateral branches, leaf length, leaf width, <b>herbage</b> yield per <b>plant,</b> number of nodes per main stem, number of nodes per lateral branch, spike length of main stem, number of spikes per plant, height of lateral branches and spike length of lateral branches were recorded and used in this study. The results showed the significant differences among landraces for all tested traits {{with the exception of the}} number of nodes per lateral branch. Two accessions, including Mzin 3 with 1. 9 ml/ 100 g essential oil content, and Mzin 6 with 2. 1 ml/ 100 g essential oil content, produced the highest essential oil content. Mzin 3, with 15. 9 g/plant herbage dry yield and Mzin 6 8. 1 g/plant, produced the highest and lowest herbage yield. Genotypic and phenotypic coefficients of variation were high for the spike length of the main stem (32. 3 %, 29. 7 %), the number of spikes per plant (41. 7 %, 28. 5 %), and the essential oil content (38. 5 %, 34. 1 %), and was low for days to 50 % flowering (11. 9 %, 10. 7 %), days to 100 % flowering (9. 2 %, 6. 5 %) and number of node...|$|R
40|$|A {{meta-analysis}} {{based on}} experiments in organically cultivated grasslands in Norway {{was conducted to}} quantify the effects of management factors on herbage yield and feed quality. A dataset was collected that included 496 treatment means from experiments in five studies carried out at eight locations with the latitude range of 58. 8 to 69. 6 N between 1993 and 2010. We tested the effect of harvesting system (two vs. Three cuts annually), plant developmental stage at the first cut, growth period (temperature sum) and the <b>herbage</b> clover proportion. <b>Plant</b> maturity at the first cut and herbage clover proportion explained {{to a large extent}} herbage yield and quality of the first cut and annual yield. The timing of the first cut influenced also the yield and herbage quality of the second cut. The analysis confirmed the importance of legumes performance for herbage yield and quality from grasslands in organic production. Estimated annual herbage DM yield harvested at standardized plant development stage and at average clover proportion was 9 %higher in the two—compared to the three-cut system. The crude protein concentration and in vitro dry matter digestibility was 17 and 3 % higher and the NDF concentration 7 % lower in the annual herbage from the three-cut than from the twocut system, respectively. The empirical equations developed in this study may be applied to explore different options for grassland management as basis for ration and production planning and in scenario analysis of economic performance of individual and model farms. The equations do also reveal in numeric terms the tradeoffs in management practice between high yields, yield digestibility, NDF and crude protein content in organic forage production relying on red clover N 2 fixation as the engine in the system...|$|R

40|$|Asexual Epichloё endophytes {{colonise}} agricultural {{forage grasses}} {{in a relationship}} which is mutually beneficial and provides the host plant with protection against herbivorous insects. The endophyte strain AR 37 (Epichloё festucae var. lolii) produces epoxy-janthitrem alkaloids {{and is the only}} endophyte known to provide ryegrass with resistance against porina larvae (Wiseana cervinata (Walker)), a major pasture pest in cooler areas of New Zealand. This study examined the effect of temperature on concentrations of epoxy-janthitrems in AR 37 -infected ryegrass and determined how the resulting variations in concentration affected consumption, growth and survival of porina larvae. Twenty replicate pairs of perennial (Lolium perenne L.) and Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) plants with and without endophyte were prepared by cloning, with one of each pair grown at either high (20 °C) or low (7 °C) temperature. After 10 weeks, <b>herbage</b> on each <b>plant</b> was harvested, divided into leaf and pseudostem, then freeze dried and ground. Leaf and pseudostem material was then incorporated separately into semi-synthetic diets which were fed to porina larvae in a bioassay over 3 weeks. Epoxy-janthitrem concentrations within the plant materials and the semi-synthetic diets were analysed by HPLC. AR 37 -infected ryegrass grown at high temperature contained high in planta concentrations of epoxy-janthitrem (30. 6 µg/g in leaves and 83. 9 µg/g in pseudostems) that had a strong anti-feedant effect on porina larvae when incorporated into their diets, reducing their survival by 25 - 42 % on pseudostems. In comparison, in planta epoxy-janthitrem concentrations in AR 37 -infected ryegrass grown at low temperature were very low (0. 67 µg/g in leaves and 7. 4 µg/g in pseudostems) resulting in a small anti-feedant effect in perennial but not in Italian ryegrass. Although alkaloid concentrations were greatly reduced by low temperature this reduction did not occur until after 4 weeks of exposure. Alkaloid concentrations were slightly lower in Italian than in perennial ryegrass and concentrations were higher in the pseudostems when compared with the leaves. In conclusion, epoxy-janthitrems expressed by the AR 37 endophyte show strong activity against porina larvae. However, when ryegrass plants are grown at a constant low temperature {{for an extended period of}} time in planta epoxy-janthitrem concentrations are greatly reduced and are les...|$|R
40|$|An {{increased}} {{understanding of}} the competitive interactions between tree species and understorey pastures {{is required for the}} development of deciduous tree based silvo-pastoral systems. In particular, the shade tolerance of pasture species likely to be used under trees in New Zealand needs to be determined. This thesis examines the effects of light intensity and quality on the growth of pasture species in a series of glasshouse experiments, and under the shade of alder trees pruned to different heights. The shoot dry weight per plant of all grass and legume species examined showed a linear increase (P 0. 05) on the shoot dry weight production of the pasture species examined. Similarly, the interaction between PAR x R:FR and species was not significant (P> 0. 05) for most morphological characteristics when plants were not defoliated. Perennial ryegrass, Wana cocksfoot and Yorkshire fog (Holcus lanatus L.) at low PAR had similar yields, that higher than white clover and lotus, which were similar. However, when plants were defoliated weekly or three-weekly, Wana cocksfoot out produced Nui perennial ryegrass at low PAR/R:FR due to its ability to maintain higher leaf area and higher leaf dry weight, higher SLA, and more tillers per <b>plant.</b> <b>Herbage</b> mass of swards in heavy and medium shade created by pruning alder trees was about 50 % and 70 %, respectively, of that of light shade (P Yorkshire fog>perennial ryegrass.

Additionally, cocksfoot and lotus are both tolerant of the low to medium soil fertility and seasonal dry periods likely to be encountered on the hill country where deciduous trees are also used to control soil erosion. Shade had a marked effect on tillering as well as on shoot dry weight, and is the most significant factor determining the understorey pasture production. However, the decrease in pasture production due to shading can be managed by appropriate pruning practices and choice of appropriate pasture species...|$|R
40|$|Alfalfa is {{the most}} {{important}} forage legume grown in the US. However, production potential is limited by poor plant persistence due to defoliation and freeze stress induced by harvesting and winter temperatures, respectively. Defoliation reduces alfalfa taproot sucrose concentrations and starch reserves. These are used to provide the carbon necessary for <b>herbage</b> regrowth and <b>plant</b> survival. Injury to alfalfa plants exposed to freezing temperatures results in significant losses in herbage yield as well as plant persistence. Our objectives were to (1) understand how sucrose deprivation of cultured cells influenced cell growth, carbohydrate metabolism, and regulation of sucrose concentration responsive genes, (2) determine if genetic differences in defoliation stress tolerance and winter hardiness between dormant and nondormant alfalfa was retained by suspension cells derived from these contrasting cultivars. In Exp. 1 and 2, 8 d-old cell suspensions grown in B 5 g media were subcultured into two B 5 g media formulations containing either sucrose or mannitol. Cell suspensions were derived from cultivars that had reduced herbage growth in autumn and were winter hardy (fall dormant) or from cultivars with extensive fall herbage growth, but that winter killed (fall nondormant). In sucrose-containing media, cells from nondormant plants exhibited higher cell growth rates, greater starch concentrations, and higher dark respiration rates when compared to cells from dormant plants. Mannitol-containing media reduced cell growth rates, starch concentrations, and dark respiration rates, but increased α-amylase activities increased significantly. The relative abundance of β-amylase RNA increased in cells from sucroserich media. Five differentially expressed sucrose-starvation-related transcripts were isolated and their nucleotide sequences determined. In Exp. 3, 10 -d-old cell suspensions grown in B 5 h liquid media were acclimated at 2 °C for 14 d and exposed freezing temperatures in a stepwise fashion at the rate of – 5 °C per hour. Acclimated cells of dormant cultivar 5262 survived freezing temperatures as low as – 25 °C, whereas unacclimated dormant cells were killed. Acclimated nondormant cells of 5929 survived 0 and – 5 °C but were killed thereafter. Increased sugar and starch concentrations, changes in polypeptide composition are some of the features of these suspension cells that are consistent with known differences between dormant and nondormant plants in the field. ...|$|R
