60|$|But {{at the end}} {{of three}} months we began to get anxious. Things were going so slow. Dick and Aunt Tommy didn't seem a bit further ahead than at first. <b>Jill</b> <b>said</b> it was because Aunt Tommy didn't {{encourage}} Dick enough.|$|E
60|$|Jill and I {{fixed up}} what I {{was to say}} and Jill made me say {{it over and over}} again to be sure I had it right. I told her--sarcastically--that she'd better say it herself and then it would be done properly. <b>Jill</b> <b>said</b> she would if it were Aunt Tommy, but when it was Dick it was better for a man to do it. So of course I agreed.|$|E

60|$|Aunt Tommy is {{all white}} and dimpled. She has curly {{red hair and}} big jolly brown eyes and {{scrumptious}} freckles. I do like freckles in a girl, although Jill goes wild if she thinks she has one on her nose. When we talked of writing this story <b>Jill</b> <b>said</b> I wasn't to say that Aunt Tommy had freckles because it wouldn't sound romantic. But I don't care. She has freckles and I think they are all right.|$|E
60|$|I {{suppose it}} is time I {{explained}} who Dick and Aunt Tommy are. Dick is our minister. He hasn't been it very long. He only came a year ago. I shall never forget how surprised Jill and I were that first Sunday we went to church and saw him. We had always thought that ministers had to be old. All the ministers we knew were. Mr. Grinnell, the one before Dick came, must have been as old as Methuselah. But Dick was young--and good-looking. <b>Jill</b> <b>said</b> she thought it a positive sin for a minister to be so good-looking, it didn't seem Christian; {{but that was just}} because all the ministers we knew happened to be homely so that it didn't appear natural.|$|E
60|$|Dick came to Owlwood--that's our place; I hate these explanations--quite a lot, {{even before}} Aunt Tommy came. He and Father were chums; {{they had been}} in college {{together}} and Father said Dick was the best football player he ever knew. Jill and I soon got acquainted with him and this was another uncanny thing. We had never thought it possible to get acquainted with a minister. <b>Jill</b> <b>said</b> she didn't think it proper for a real live minister to be so chummy. But then Jill was a little jealous because Dick and I, being both men; were better friends than he and she could be. He taught me to skate that winter and fence with canes and do long division. I could never understand long division before Dick came, although I was away on in fractions.|$|E

Lauren said Jill didn't give her time to adjust before she went on the attack. <b>Jill</b> <b>said</b> she was not on the attack; she {{wanted to be part of}} the family but Lauren wouldn't even show her photographs of Neil. Lauren reminded her about her lawsuit and threatened to get a restraining order. Jill claimed all she cared about was being part of the family. Lauren knocked her down into an empty grave and asked if she felt closer to Daddy now. However, despite all these events, Jill and Lauren reconciled and remain close to date.|$|E
