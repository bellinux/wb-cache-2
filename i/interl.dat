40|$|Introduction In {{recent years}} Knowledge Management (KM) {{has become an}} {{important}} success factor for enterprises. Increasing product complexity, globalization, virtual organizations or customer orientation are developments that ask for a thorough and systematic management of knowledge - within an enterprise and between several cooperating enterprises. Obviously, KM is a major issue for human resource management, enterprise organization and enterprise culture - nevertheless, information technology (IT) plays the crucial enabler for many aspects of KM. As a consequence, KM is an inherently interdisciplinary subject. IT-supported KM solutions are built around some kind of organizational memory [ABH+ 98] that integrates informal, semi-formal and formal knowl- edge {{in order to facilitate}} its access, sharing and reuse by members of the organization(s) for solving their individual or collective tasks [DCGR 99].

This has been addressed by others as an application of grammatical inference. We describe an approach based on stochastic grammatical inference which scales more naturally to large data sets and produces models with richer semantics. We adopt an algorithm that produces stochastic finite automata and describe modifications that enable better interactive control of results. Our experimental evaluation uses four document collections with varying structure. Keywords: stochastic grammatical inference, text database structure 1. Introduction 1. 1.

Fortunately, RST [Mann-Thoml) son 1987] is capable of representing <b>interl)</b> aragraph structure ms well ms intraparagraph structure, tlowever, RST does not specify how to build large structures representing multiparagraph text. This paper presents an algorithm to construct such nmltiparagraph structures representing a critique of a student's performance in troubleshooting the HAWK radar, as determined by MACH-III. This critique is based on the functional hierarchy tree (FH tree), which is the heaxt of the expert system component of MACH-III [Kurland et al 1989]. Each student action is judged based on the structure of the FH tree, and where the student is currently located in that tree. The generated critique thus needs to describe each action and how that action helps or hinders proper navigation through the FH tree. Functional hierarchy is a new paradigm for organizing expert system knowledge bases, based on the procedural abstraction principles of Liskov and Gutag [Liskov-Gutag 1986].

40|$|In {{this paper}} an attempt {{is made to}} widen the {{perspective}} under which interorganizational etworks are generally seen. It is argued that both {{in the economy and}} in policy making, network phenomena are in fact becoming more prominent. This is linked to functional differentiation, a core process of societal modernization, which implies the existence of partly autonomous societal subsystems. Their emergence is closely connected with the ascen-dance of formal organizations, which in turn enjoy a certain measure of autonomy. In this structural context, interorganizational etwork following a logic of negotiation, which extends to "constitutional " issues can provide a solution to coordination problems typical of modem societies. The Ascendance of Networks The world is composed of networks, not groups, says Barry Wel lman (1988 : 31). Our discipline, the sociology of organizations, eems to have discovered this fact roughly 20 years ago, when "interorganizational re a-tions " became an important new topic. 1 The new perspective called {{attention to the fact that}} the environment of organizations i filled with other or-ganizations, o that for many of them, other organizations (and not amor-phous publics) are the most relevant interact ion partners. 2 So the organization became the "focal organization, " and research on interor-ganizational relations developed.

40|$|Patients {{with chronic}} kidney disease (CKD), {{irrespective}} of initial etiology, have a risk of cardiovascular morbidity (CVD) and mortality that is many-fold {{higher than that of}} a similar person without CKD. While traditional risk factors, such as hyperlipidemia, certainly contribute, these factors cannot by themselves explain the burden of CVD. Recent data suggest that endocrine signaling of fat mass may lead to the complex of CVD risk factors known as the metabolic syndrome. In the following work, we test the hypothesis that an uremic metabolic syndrome caused by aberrant adipose tissue signaling may contribute to inflammation and metabolic disturbances in CKD. Study I. In a cross-sectional study of 187 incident patients starting dialysis therapy we measured several inflammatory cytokines and adipokines and related these to total and truncal fat mass as estimated by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). We found that truncal, but not non-truncal, fat mass was associated with circulating levels of both <b>interl</b> eukin(IL) - 6 and C-reactive protein (CRP). Study II. In a study of 197 incident CKD patients evaluated shortly before the start of dialysis, we showed that patients with elevated fat mass, although having elevated inflammatory markers, are less likely to need recombinant erythropoietin (epoetin), and that epoetin dose is associated with circulating levels of leptin. Study III. This is a post hoc, cross-sectional study comparing 239 CKD patients with varying degrees of renal function impairment with an age- and gender-matched randomly selected control group of 24 individuals. We explored the role of decreased renal function on the adipokine resistin, apparently able to inhibit hepatic insulin action in mice We also investigate possible links with inflammation (CRP, IL- 6) and the insulin resistance (QUICKI, HbA 1 c%) present in patients with CKD. While resistin is strongly related to renal function and inflammation, we could find no links to surrogate markers of insulin resistance. Study IV. In a longitudinal study of 158 CKD, patients with varying degrees of renal failure, we explored the relationship between changes in body fat (DEXA) and tissue resident macrophages (assessed by measuring sCD 163), as well as links to systemic inflammation (IL- 6, CRP). We concluded that an increase in fat mass is associated with increased sCD 163, a surrogate marker of macrophages, and more inflammation in CKD patients. Study V. Again using a cross-sectional design of 189 prevalent CKD patients, we investigated putative links between the adipokine visfatin and insulin resistance in CKD. We conclude that while a reduced renal function and inflammation both independently predict visfatin levels, visfatin is not associated with QUICKI or HbA 1 c%. However, increased circulating visfatin was associated with endothelial adhesion molecules (sVCAM- 1) and a higher mortality rate. Study VI. Using a Mendelian randomization approach in a cohort of 198 incident CKD patients starting dialysis, we show significant differences in serum lipids between functional genotypes of alpha 2 Heremans-Schmid glycoprotein (AHSG) as well as a significant association between AHSG and fat mass (DEXA). Conclusions. In patients with chronic renal disease, total and, especially, truncal fat mass is associated with increased circulating levels of several cytokines and adipokines that have may influence cardiovascular health and outcome. Thus, further studies are needed to evaluate the impact of fat mass and adipokines on outcome in this patient group...|$|E
