5|$|Diederichs {{requested}} reinforcements from Germany, and the Kaiser authorized {{a second}} Division to deploy to the East Asia station.

Prinzess Wilhelm and Kaiser moved into the harbor to provide artillery support. General Chang, who had been placed under house arrest, was discovered to have been attempting to subvert the German occupation; Dierderichs therefore placed him under arrest aboard Prinzess Wilhelm. A brief skirmish ensued, which quickly resulted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Chinese</b> rout.

5|$|The composer's {{early works}} in {{conventional}} classical style were well received, {{but it was}} for his light orchestral pieces that he became best known. One of his earliest works in the genre, In a Monastery Garden (1915), sold over a million copies and brought him to widespread notice; his later musical depictions of exotic scenes caught the public imagination and established his fortune. Such works as In a Persian Market (1920), <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>Chinese</b> Temple Garden (1923), and In the Mystic Land of Egypt (1931) became best-sellers in print and on records; by the late 1920s he was Britain's first millionaire composer. His celebrations of British scenes were equally popular: examples include Cockney Suite (1924) with its scenes of London life, and his ceremonial music for royal events. His works were frequently recorded during his heyday, and {{a substantial part of}} his output has been put on CD in more recent years.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{record of}} diplomatic contact between present-day Malaysia and Vietnam {{dates back to}} 1469. Soldiers of Vietnamese Later Le dynasty had captured a Malaccan tributary mission {{en route to the}} Chinese Ming dynasty, killing some of them, and castrating and enslaving the survivors. Tonkin expressed their intent to conquer Malacca; this intent was conveyed to the Chinese emperor in a later mission in 1481. The Chinese emperor ordered Malacca to raise soldiers {{in the event of a}} similar attack. Malacca defeated the Vietnamese during an invasion of Lan Xang as reported <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Chinese</b> account. The Malay Annals also mention a Cham prince taking some of his followers to form a small Cham colony in Malacca when Vietnam invaded Champa in 1471, and deploying military assistance to Johor to fend off a botched military conquest in the 1590s. In the mid 17th-century, the Cham vassal states Panduranga and Kelantan cultivated close diplomatic ties when they led a long-term diplomatic mission to Kelantan to learn more about Malay culture and Islam. Subsequent Champa kings after Po Rome, beginning with his son Po Saut, periodically received Malay Muslim missionaries from Kelantan in the 17th and 18th centuries.|$|E
