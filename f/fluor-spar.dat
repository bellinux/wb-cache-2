2500|$|In his 1852 {{paper on}} the [...] "Refrangibility" [...] (wavelength change) of light, George Gabriel Stokes {{described}} the ability of fluorspar and uranium glass to change invisible light beyond the violet end of the visible spectrum into blue light. He named this phenomenon fluorescence : [...] "I am almost inclined to coin a word, and call the appearance fluorescence, from <b>fluor-spar</b> , as the analogous term opalescence {{is derived from the}} name of a mineral." [...] The name was derived from the mineral fluorite (calcium difluoride), some examples of which contain traces of divalent europium, which serves as the fluorescent activator to emit blue light. In a key experiment he used a prism to isolate ultraviolet radiation from sunlight and observed blue light emitted by an ethanol solution of quinine exposed by it.|$|E

The synthetic <b>fluor-spars</b> tested were prepared from waste fluosilicic acid generated during the processing of fluorapatite ore. The cupola trials showed the synthetic products to be the equivalent of natural fluorspar from an operational standpoint. However, wet scrubber sampling showed that substantial losses of volatilized fluorine occurred from the cupola during operation. The losses during synthetic fluorspar trials considerably exceeded those from natural fluorspar trials. Laboratory viscosity testing, using a high-temperature rotational viscometer, confirmed this finding and indicated that fluorspar volatility in slags is related to slag basicity. Synthetic fluorspar is accordingly recommended more for highly basic cupola operation (> 1. 3 basicity) than for neutral or acid operation, because of the increased potential for pollution and baghouse filter detezioration...|$|R
