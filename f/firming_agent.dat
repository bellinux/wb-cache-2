40|$|Abstract. The main {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to investigate curling mechanism and moisture-density properties of c-type <b>firming</b> <b>agent</b> stabilized sludges.

In order to evaluate effects of agents on stabilized sludges, the moisture-density tests were performed and testing results were analyzed. Through this study, the following conclusions were made: 1) SiO 2 and Ai 2 O 3 are their major constituents which take 70 ~ 90 % of the total mass of a sludge; 2) addition of vermiculite or DK Powders could significantly improve performance of the stabilized sludges...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: White button {{mushroom}} (Agaricus bisporus) {{is one of}} the main horticultural crops which differ from other crops significantly. It is devoid of the protective cuticle and reserves carbohydrates. For this reason mushroom is perishable product and its texture is damaged fast after harvesting. In this study, the effects of three edible polysaccharide coatings including High Methoxy Pectin (HMP), Commercial starch(% 3) and Carboxy Methyl Cellulose(% 0. 17) were investigated on the shelf life of mushroom. Ascorbic acid (as antioxidant and reducing pH agent) and CaCl (<b>firming</b> <b>agent)</b> were used as pretreatments. Physicochemical and sensory 2 properties including weight, moisture, reducing sugars, texture and color were assayed during storage in refrigerator (4 °C) at 1, 7 and 14 day of storage.

The {{aim of this study}} was to determine, the effect of different doses of calcium chloride on biochemical and color properties of fresh-cut green bean. Fresh-cut green beans were dipped for 90 seconds in 0. 5 %, 1 %, 2 % and 3 % solution of calcium chloride at 25 &# 176;C. The fresh-cut green bean samples were packaged in polystyrene foam dishes, wrapped with stretch film and stored in a cold room at 5 &# 177; 1 &# 176;C temperature and 85 - 90 % RH. Calcium chloride treatments did not retain the green color of samples. Whiteness index, browning index and total color difference (&# 916;E) values of CaCl 2 treated samples were high. Saturation index and hue angle were low compared to the control, especially at higher doses of CaCl 2. Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) enzyme activity in samples treated with CaCl 2 at 3 % doses, was low at the 7 th days of storage than with other treatments. Fructose and sucrose content of samples increased in all treatment groups whereas glucose level decreased during the first 4 th days of storage...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to increase the post harvest life of mango fruit at ambient temperature during storage to boost export of this very tasty and delicious fruit in the international market. Different combinations of Bee wax with polysaccharide based coatings such as CMC, Guar gum, vegetable oil having CaCl 2 as <b>firming</b> <b>agent,</b> fungicide like NaOCL and 2, 4, 5 -T as anti ripening agent were employed on hard green, matured, unripened, and uniform sized of Dushehari, Sindhri and Chaunsa White the three very important commercial varieties of mango. Coated fruit was either packed in export quality carton boxes, polyethylene, and wooden alone or in polyethylene-carton and polyethylene-wooden combinations containing KMnO 4 sachet to absorb or remove ethylene. The effect of surface coating and packaging on the keeping quality of mango was investigated after an interval of 3 days at ambient temperature (32 - 35 oC with 53. 6 78. 8 % RH), (35 - 44 oC with 55. 9 - 69. 7 % RH) and (28 - 33 oC with 56. 7 - 69. 7 % RH) respectively during storage. The data obtained was statistically analyzed for Analysis of Variance (ANOV A) by using 2 -Factorial Complete Randomized Design (CRD) and Duncan,s Multiple Range Test (DMRT) was applied to compare the mean values obtained. Results revealed that treatments, storage and their interactions had highly significant effect on keeping quality of mango during storage. It was observed that coating (CMC-WAX + 2, 4, 5 -T+ H 3 BO 3 -CaCl 2) mixture had shown the best results and maintained 90 % green color, firm texture followed by (CMC-W AX + NaOCI), (CMC+ Wax+ KMnO 4) and (CMC +Wax + CaCl 2 + 2, 4, 5 -T) in which majority of the samples were still green with creamy white pulp even after one month of storage. On the other hand in control sample 70 - 75 % fruit were ripened with full yellow color within a week and blackening of the skin at stem end and rotting in some of the samples was started within 12 days of their storage and due to its unattractive skin, brown pulp color and poor taste fruit was unacceptable after 16 days of storage. Whereas treated fruit without rotting were green even after 21 st day of their storage. Therefore, increasing of the storage life of treated Sindhri mango up to 25 days and Chaunsa White more than 30 days is very encouraging as compared to its own original life only 4 to 6 days. It was also investigated that mango packed in polyethylene or coated fruit having with other protective chemicals packed in polyethylene within carton or wooden boxes played a very effective and vital role to control compositional changes by delaying the ripening process and with a minimum quality loss. It was observed that Chaunsa White treated with Wax-CMC coating having ethylene absorbent, fungicide and antiripening agents having NaOCI, KMnO 4. 2, 4, 5 -T or 2, 4, 5 -T with CaCl 2 and H 3 BO 3 packed in polyethylene or all these combinations along with polyethylene packaged in carton or wooden had lower weight loss, slower increase of TSS, pH, higher retention of acidity, slower increase in AA, RS, TIS, SUC, TS, SAR, or lower score of SKC, FLC, T AS and higher TEX and slower increase of FLA score respectively as compared to fruit packed in carton/wooden box alone or polyethylene packed fruit in carton/wooden without chemical treatments were comparatively less effective...|$|E

Cultural assimilation emerges as an equilibrium phenomenon.

Moreover, the valuation effects vary according to the objective functions of institutions' administrators. Thus, other shareholders do not necessarily benefit from relationships between institutions and managers, and they could be hurt when the institutional <b>agents</b> watching <b>firm</b> <b>agents</b> have conflicts of interest with other shareholders...|$|R
