40|$|Dielectric {{relaxation}} {{measurements of}} a typical small molecular glassformer, <b>dipropyleneglycol</b> dibenzoate show the presence of two secondary relaxations. Their dynamic properties differ in the equilibrium liquid and glassy states, {{as well as the}} changes during structural recovery after rapid quenching the liquid to form a glass. These differences enable us to identify the slower secondary relaxation as the genuine Johari-Goldstein (JG) beta-relaxation [G. P. Johari and M. Goldstein, J. Chem. Phys. 53, 2372 (1970) ], acting as the precursor of the primary alpha-relaxation. Agreement between the JG beta-relaxation time and the independent relaxation time of the coupling model leads to predicted quantitative relations between the JG beta-relaxation and the alpha-relaxation that are supported by the experimental data.

40|$|Purpose: To {{study the}} {{characteristics}} of sodium carboxymethyl chitosan (SCM-chitosan) as a fixative for eau de cologne product. Methods: SCM-chitosan was prepared by carboxymethylation reaction of chitosan with monochloroacetic acid. The solubility of SCM-chitosan was investigated in water and ethanol. Sixteen perfume compounds which consisted of four chemical types- alcohols, ketones, aldehydes and ethers- were selected for eau de cologne preparation. The turbidity of the products prepared was monitored over 21 -day aging period. Those showing no turbidity were selected for fixative studies with SCM-chitosan. The fixative effect of SCM-chitosan was evaluated by head space gas chromatography at different temperatures (25, 35 and 53 °C). Results: The prepared SCM-chitosan was soluble in water but insoluble in ethanol. The optimum ratio between water and ethanol that could completely dissolve 0. 1 % SCM-chitosan was 2 : 3 v/v. SCM-chitosan showed significant fixative effect (3. 9 - 92. 2 %) on p-cresyl methyl ether (10 % in <b>dipropyleneglycol).</b> Fixative efficiency increased from 3. 9 % at 25 °C to 42. 1 % at 35 °C and 92. 2 % at 53 °C. However, products containing benzyl alcohol, ethyl acetoacetate and 94085 floral-fruity showed precipitation after 21 days. Conclusion: The results obtained indicate that SCM-chitosan {{could be used as}} a potential fixative for eau d...|$|E
40|$|In this work, {{a number}} of chain {{extended}} moisture-curable urethane prepolymers were synthesized {{in order to develop}} isocyanate terminated urethane prepolymer formulations that would simultaneously display both high adhesive strength and low viscosity. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1 H-NMR), size exclusion chromatography (SEC), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and Brookfield viscometry were utilized for characterizing the prepared urethane prepolymers. In addition, the adhesion strength of the cured prepolymers was determined by tensile shear strength test according to the DIN EN (Deutsches Institut für Normung, the German Institute for Standardization) 1465 standard. Especially, the role of different types of linear (butanediol, pentanediol) and branched chain extenders (<b>dipropyleneglycol</b> (di-PPG), tripropyleneglycol (tri-PPG) and the influence of their dosage on the degree of microphase separation between hard segments (HS) and soft segments (SS) in urethane prepolymers were studied. Furthermore, the benefits of utilizing either a one-step versus a two-step polymerization process were investigated. The results revealed that the extent of phase separation of different urethane prepolymers was dependent on the extent of hydrogen bonding interactions which was extensively studied by attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR). The incorporation of branched chain extenders (di-PPG and tri-PPG) did not result in notable phase separation between hard segments and soft segments, while linear chain extenders (pentanediol and butanediol) readily promoted phase separation. The degree of phase separation was particularly pronounced for butanediol, and when the linear chain extender ratio was higher than or equal to 0. 74. Compared with a two-stage process, one-stage process produced more randomly distributed polymer chains with highly dispersed hard segments. Thus, urethane prepolymers exhibiting strong adhesive strength with simultaneously low viscosity were successfully developed by systematic adjustment of structural parameters...|$|E
