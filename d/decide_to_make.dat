25|$|There are {{instances}} where the programmer performing the optimization must <b>decide</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the software better for some operations {{but at the}} cost of making other operations less efficient. These trade-offs may sometimes be of a non-technical naturenbsp&— such as when a competitor has published a benchmark result that must be beaten in order to improve commercial success but comes perhaps with the burden of making normal usage of the software less efficient. Such changes are sometimes jokingly referred to as pessimizations.|$|E
25|$|Vaginal tears {{can occur}} during childbirth, most {{often at the}} vaginal opening as the baby's head passes through, {{especially}} if the baby descends quickly. Tears can involve the perineal skin or extend to the muscles and the anal sphincter and anus. The midwife or obstetrician may <b>decide</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a surgical cut to the perineum (episiotomy) to make the baby's birth easier and prevent severe tears that {{can be difficult to}} repair. A 2017 Cochrane review compared episiotomy as needed (restrictive) with routine episiotomy to determine the possible benefits and harms for mother and baby. The review found that restrictive episiotomy policies appeared to give a number of benefits compared with using routine episiotomy. Women experienced less severe perineal trauma, less posterior perineal trauma, less suturing and fewer healing complications at seven days with no difference in occurrence of pain, urinary incontinence, painful sex or severe vaginal/perineal trauma after birth.|$|E

Parker and Stone originally conceived the episode [...] "Damien", which involves a boxing match between Jesus and Satan, as the first season's Christmas episode. Although they had long planned to feature Mr. Hankey in the show, they did not <b>decide</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> him a Christmas character until halfway through the filming of [...] "Damien".

They resumed sessions at IBC in January 1969, block booking Monday to Thursday, but had to do gigs every weekend to stop going further into debt. A major tour was booked for the end of April, and the group's management insisted that the album would have to be finished by then, as it had been well over a year since The Who Sell Out. Lambert wrote a script, Tommy (1914–1984) which he professionally printed, and gave copies to the band, which helped them focus the storyline, and also <b>decide</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the album a double. The group were still coming up with new material; Lambert insisted that the piece should have a proper overture, while Townshend wrote [...] "Pinball Wizard" [...] so that Nik Cohn, a pinball fan, would give the album a favourable review in the New York Times. Lambert wanted an orchestra to appear on the album, but Townshend was strongly against the idea, and time and budget constraints meant it could not happen anyway.|$|E

[...] "Damien" [...] first aired on Comedy Central in the United States on February 4, 1998.

Before [...] "Damien" [...] even ran, Mike Duffy of Detroit Free Press said the episode was [...] "certain to become one of the show's signature moments".

During their journey, they become the protectors of a local village. The pair eventually become the heirs to the mystical Mana Sword. The main campaign was delivered in chapters. The original main campaign, which involved a battle with the hostile Folon, lasted for twenty chapters. Following this, new campaign missions were issued following the characters' mission to confront threats using the Mana Sword. At the end of the game, the Champions confront Folon at the Mana Tree, along with Vibra and Toryu. After their final confrontation, Foron willingly disperses after she and Mana explain why they summoned the Champions: to bring them together through circumstance and pave the way for peace between the Rasta and Daruka.
