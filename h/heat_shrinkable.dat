40|$|First of all, I want to {{introduce}} LS Cable briefly. LG-Cable changes the name of company to LS-Cable because the ownership of company is changed in 2005. LS Cable produces not only cables but also various products like heat pipe, refrigerator, injection machine, etc. Since 2001, LS Cable has tried to enhance R&D processes and manufacturing processes by applying TRIZ. Therefore, LS Cable opened TRIZ education course and have taught full process of TRIZ to research engineers. And TRIZ has been adapted to practical engineering projects. Several successful results were achieved through co-work with TRIZ team and research engineers.

40|$|The {{electrical}} properties of a widely used stress control tube for medium voltage heat-shrink joints are {{examined in this}} master thesis by using non-destructive laboratory methods. They were determined by use of time domain dielectric response test while changing the DC electric field, temperature and level of humidity. In {{order to determine the}} physical and mechanical characteristics of the material at different aging stages and conditions, both differential scanning calorimetry and tensile test measurements were performed on stress control tube samples. Two types of test samples were prepared. For dielectric response tests, Raychem JSCR 42 / 16 stress control tube was shrunk on a cylindrical rod, consisting of two metal electrodes, separated by a PTFE (Teflon) insulating rod. For differential scanning calorimetry and tensile tests, the stress control tube was shrunk on a cylindrical PTFE rod only, with the same diameter as for the dielectric response tests without the presence of metal electrodes. Tensile test measurements were performed in order to characterize and compare the mechanical properties of the stress control tube material at different aging stages. Differential scanning calorimetry measurements were used to estimate aging degree by assessment of thermal resistivity of the material and antioxidants consumption when exposed to high temperatures for a certain period of time. To calculate the conductivity, dielectric response measurements were performed in time domain at different voltage levels up to 20 kV and charging and discharging time duration of 10800 s. They were conducted by placing the test object in a climate chamber in order to examine the influence of temperature and humidity. The measurements were performed on unaged and thermally aged <b>heat</b> <b>shrinkable</b> stress control tubes. The aging process was obtained in heat cabinets at 98 °C dry air, 98 °C wet air and 150 °C dry air conditions. Results from the analysis show that conductivity has not significant dependency of the electric field up to 0. 2 kV/mm at different temperatures, aging degree and humidity. It was revealed that conductivity is more temperature dependent, as a significant increase was observed when the temperature was elevated at higher values. Conductivity was found out to be strongly dependent on humidity, especially when combined with high aging degree. <br/...|$|E

The {{standard of living}} is also growing, which increases demandof energy in near future. Fossil fuels are currently the main resource to provide energy whichare not unlimited. Problems on fossil fuels energy are not only lack of resource but alsocreating the environmental problems. Oil based energy waste such as carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO 2) block heat in atmosphere and accelerate earth surface temperatureto trigger global warming. From this point of view, we need a suitable energy substitute assoon as possible. Dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC) using the principle of natural photosynthesis are nowcurrently at the verge of commercialization having similar photoconversion efficiency ascompared to amorphous silicon solar cells. DSSCs or well known as Gr?tzel cells, consist ofn-type semiconductor such as titanium dioxide (TiO 2), tungsten oxide (WO 3), zinc oxide(ZnO) or tin dioxide (SnO 2), with the light absorber. The structure is different from all solarcell mentioned above where light is being absorbed by the semiconductor materials itself. Relatively low cost and easy manufacturing process make DSSCs one of candidates forfuture solar energy resources. DSSCs reached up to 13 % of efficiency in recent days. Thereare several barriers in DSSCs commercialization, for instance, utilization of only visibleregion of solar spectra, high cost of transparent conductive Oxide (TCO) glass, and so on. Our final goals are to extend the photo sensitivity of DSSCs to far-red and NIR area, tochange the structure of DSSCs into back-contact DSSC in order to totally remove the TCOparts, and to fabricated cylindrical structure for harvesting more light in a day and decreasingwind resistance. Chapter 1 deals with our research motivation, kinds of renewable energy, review aboutphotovoltaics cell and propose of our present work. In chapter 2, the detail about the structureand working principle of DSSCs are discussed. The main components in DSSCs areexplained in details and barriers of DSSCs commercialization also are discussed. In chapter 3, the DSSCs characteristics and cells performance calculation are deliberated. Allexperiments conducted in this thesis are described in this chapter. Chapter 4 described the new dyes. Phosphorus-phthalocyanine dye was used to cover IR region. Without conventional anchoring groups such as carboxylic acid (-COOH), phosporusphthalocyaninedyes could be attached onto titania surface with P-O-Ti linkage. Furthermore,modification of the side chain at α-position of the sensitizer was done to optimize theHOMO-LUMO level. In chapter 5, novel DSSC structure are discussed. Titanium sheet with micro holes (FTSMH) was utilized as photo-anode and as counter electrode to completely eliminate TCO fromDSSCs in flat {{as well as in}} cylinder structure. In flat back-contact DSSC, hydrogen peroxidetreatment was used to modifu the titanium surface to make TiO 2 nanosheets, which leads toenhancement of short circuit current and open circuit voltage. Reduction of electrolytic gapwas carried out to optimize IPCE in 300 - 400 nm wavelength region.

40|$|Proteomics {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the recognition of diseases and the understanding of biological processes. Sample preparation is a bottleneck in systems for chemical analysis and it is a required step in proteomics in order to remove interferences and preconcentrate the proteins. In addition, protein reduction and alkylation before digestion is a required step in proteomics to facilitate protein unfolding and increase the efficiency of enzymes in digesting proteins. The purpose of this study was to develop new techniques to address some of the shortcomings of current sample preparation methods, and provide short sample preparation time. Much research in recent years has focused on porous monolithic materials since they are highly permeable to liquid flow and show high mass transfer compared with common packed beds. This study has focused on the use of organic polymer- and inorganic silica-based monolithic materials for protein sample preparation. The organic polymer monolith used in this study was a butyl methacrylate-co-ethylene dimethacrylate (BuMA-co-EDMA) monolith that was fabricated inside the borosilicate tube using photoinitiated polymerisation. The porous properties of the fabricated monolith were controlled by adjusting the composition of the porogenic solvent in the polymerisation mixture. The results indicated that using MeOH/ 1 -propanol as a porogenic solvent produced a polymer-based monolith with high surface area (56. 89 m² g¯¹); however, it lacked the desired permeability and porosity when fabricated inside a glass microchip. Evaluation of its performance was carried out by extraction of four standard proteins that were insulin, cytochrome C, myoglobin, and hemoglobin and the extraction recovery was in the range (79. 1 - 98. 4 %). A monolithic silica rod was fabricated without cracks inside a <b>heat</b> <b>shrinkable</b> tube and then compared with the same material whose surface has been modified with octadecyl groups in order to use them for preconcentration/extraction of proteins. Their performance was evaluated using eight standard proteins, namely insulin, cytochrome C, lysozyme, myoglobin, β-lactoglobulin, ovalbumin, hemoglobin, and bovine serum albumin. The results show that recovery of the proteins was achieved by both columns with variable yields; however, the octadecylated silica monolith gave higher recoveries (92. 7 - 109. 7 %) than the non-modified silica monolith (25. 5 - 97. 9 %). This was followed by a new process for the fabrication of a silica-based monolith inside a glass microchip, which was successfully developed for use in microchip-based solid phase extraction of proteins. This was achieved by placement of the monolithic silica disk inside the extraction chamber in the base plate of the microchip, followed by thermal bonding of the two plates of the glass microchip at 575 °C for 3 hours. By doing this, the problem of shrinkage in the silica skeleton during preparation was avoided completely. The monolithic silica disk inside the glass microchip was subsequently modified with octadecyl groups for increased protein binding capacity. The performance of the microchip was evaluated using the extraction of standard proteins mixed with a high concentration of the detergent 3 -[(3 -cholamidopropyl) dimethylammonio]- 1 -propanesulfonate (CHAPS). The results show that the octadecylated silica monolith was permeable, has the ability to remove impurities, and achieved a high extraction recovery of the proteins (94. 8 - 99. 7 %) compared with conventional octadecylated silica particles (48. 3 - 91. 3 %). The intra-batch and inter-batch RSDs were in the range of 2. 0 - 4. 5 % and 2. 9 - 6. 4 %, respectively. Comparison between the fabricated device and a commercial cartridge for the preconcentration of proteins in skimmed cows milk and hen egg white showed the ability of the device to successfully enrich protein mixtures from more realistic samples. This new microfluidic device for protein extraction may find an application in the area of proteomic research. A novel approach for immobilisation of the reducing reagent on the surface of the silica-based monolith in order to use it for protein reduction and alkylation was successfully developed. This was carried out by silanisation of the surface of the silica-based monolith with (3 -aminopropyl) triethoxysilane (APTES), followed by immobilisation of the reducing reagent, tris (2 -carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP) on the surface of the amino-bonded silica monolith. The fabricated monolith was characterised using IR spectroscopy, EDX analysis, BET model, and measuring the contact angle of deionised water. The fabricated monolith was evaluated for its use in protein reduction and alkylation in one single step at 60 °C by injection of a mixture consisting of 40 μL denatured protein and 60 μL iodoacetamide solution into the fabricated microchip, followed by using MALDI-TOF-MS instrument for qualitative confirmation. The results show that the fabricated microchip-based silica monolith has the ability to reduce and alkylate insulin in 30 min, and lysozyme in 45 min. Although this method was shown to require sample desalting to remove denaturant (urea) and the performance of the fabricated monolith had low intra-chip reproducibility, the method was simple, reduced the risk of contamination, decreased the number of processing steps, and results in lower amounts of the sample and reagents compared with the conventional techniques for proteomics sample preparation. More work is required to fully optimise this approach to protein sample preparation...|$|E
