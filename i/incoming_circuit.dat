40|$|The diploma {{thesis is}} focused on the {{features}} description of electronics switches for digital switching arrays and on the design of program for optimal calculation of switching points and the figure of switches in digital switching arrays investigation. The electronics switches types, used for time circuit separation, are described in the preamble. These switches are the base of digital switching arrays and in principal two types are defined: the switch S and switch T. The switch S allows the interconnection only of the same channel intervals from <b>incoming</b> <b>circuit</b> with random outgoing circuit. The switch S is being used in multistage switching arrays in combination with the switches T because it can not be used separately. The switch T allows exchanging the time position of <b>incoming</b> <b>circuit</b> to different time position of outgoing circuit depending on connection needs. The time switch can substitute the space switch under specific work conditions. In practice, the time switch with controlled reading and writing is used. The following part of diploma thesis {{is focused on}} the designs and calculations of optimal switching points of digital switching array which is the executive unit of switching systems. These systems directly interconnect the signals from digital multiplexes and make the basic assumptions for telecommunication networks integration. The digital switching array means the equipment which is able to connect the channels of digital multiplexes carrying the information in encoding form. The multiplexes are the most often with pulse coded modulation or adaptive delta modulation. The digital switching arrays are divided into the time and space one. The switching arrays of digital switching systems can be made by time switching array T whose realization is limited to specific capacity or by the connection of multistage arrays. Single stages sequenced one behind each other are made by the switches T and S. The space array S does not allow making the digital switching array of switching centre. The program which determines possible proposals of switching arrays from defined figure of inputs and calculates the optimal figure of switching points and switches is a part of diploma thesis...|$|E

40|$|Wavelength-division {{multiplexing}} {{is emerging}} as the dominate technology in future all-optical networks. To efficiently use the wavelengths, wavelength converters are employed for a circuit-switched optical network in which a circuit can change its wavelength to resolve wavelength conflicts and to reuse the wavelengths. To improve the efficiency, a few converters are provided and shared by the <b>incoming</b> <b>circuits</b> in the share-per-node or the share-per-link wavelength-convertible switch. A heuristic algorithm for dynamic routing is used {{to reduce the number}} of converters. Performance gain in call blocking probability and fairness and in the reduction of the number of converters are shown. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|This memo {{describes}} how to carry dual-tone multifrequency (DTMF) signaling, other tone signals and telephony events in RTP packets. 1 Introduction This memo defines two payload formats, one for carrying dual-tone multifrequency (DTMF) digits, other line and trunk signals (Section 3), {{and a second}} one for general multi-frequency tones in RTP [1] packets (Section 4). Separate RTP payload formats are desirable since low-rate voice codecs cannot be guaranteed to reproduce these tone signals accurately enough for automatic recognition. Defining separate payload formats also permits higher redundancy while maintaining a low bit rate. The payload formats described here {{may be useful in}} at least three applications: DTMF handling for gateways and end sytems, as well as "RTP trunks". In the first application, the Internet telephony gateway detects DTMF on the <b>incoming</b> <b>circuits</b> and sends the RTP payload described here instead of regular audio packets. The gateway likely has the necessary digi [...] ...|$|R
50|$|As in {{previous}} designs, supervision of incoming calls is handled by relay sets known as <b>incoming</b> trunk <b>circuits.</b> Unlike {{in previous}} designs, {{this work is}} also done in the trunk circuit for outgoing calls, {{so there are no}} junctor circuits. Since different outgoing trunks are connected to different places and are used for different calls, their relay sets can be specialized for a particular kind of signalling or call metering (see automatic message accounting) or other peculiarity. Thus a TSPS trunk can give complete control to an operator, while an E and M signaling trunk can do the kind of signaling required of a private long-distance line, while a local outgoing trunk can be simpler.|$|R
50|$|Previous systems use relays in the <b>incoming</b> trunk <b>circuit</b> {{to control}} ringing and to return busy tone. 5XB uses a ringing {{selection}} switch (RSS): a crossbar switch with ten verticals, serving ten trunks. The various levels provide various tones, and ringing current of various durations and cadences (especially valuable for party lines). Levels 0 and 1 {{are used as}} discriminating levels to set polarity for selective ringing on tip side or ring side. An especially sensitive wire spring RT relay is used to detect off-hook from a line being rung, release the RSS hold magnet, and engage the shielded supervision relay so reverse battery answer supervision would {{be returned to the}} originating end.|$|R
40|$|In a {{joint effort}} of Nikhef (Amsterdam) and the University of Bonn, the Gossipo- 3 {{integrated}} circuit (IC) has been developed. This circuit is a prototype of a chip dedicated for read-out of various types of position sensitive Micro-Pattern Gas detectors (MPGD). The Gossipo- 3 {{is defined as a}} set of building blocks to be used in a future highly granulated (60 μm) chip. The pixel circuit can operate in two modes. In Time mode every readout pixel measures the hit arrival time and the charge deposit. For this purpose it has been equipped with a high resolution TDC (1. 7 ns) covering dynamic range up to 102 μs. Charge collected by the pixel will be measured using Time-over- Threshold method in the range from 400 e- to 28000 e- with accuracy of 200 e- (standard deviation). In Counting mode every pixel operates as a 24 -bit counter, counting the number of <b>incoming</b> hits. The <b>circuit</b> is also optimized to operate at low power consumption (100 mW/cm 2) that is required to avoid the need for massive power transport and cooling systems inside the construction of the detector...|$|R
50|$|The Flexible Plug and Play project, {{according}} to the submission documents, will test a number of so called smart devices on a distribution network {{in order to improve}} its efficiency and to allow more power to flow through it without reinforcement.1) Dynamic Line Rating device. The maximum current an overhead power line can carry is an ever changing value affected by the weather. However, in distribution networks the conventional approach is to operate lines with static or seasonal limits. In theory dynamic line rating allows constant monitoring of a line’s capacity. Knowing the limits of a section of the network at any moment will help to operate the network at its peak.2) Automatic Voltage Control. An AVC device monitors voltage levels and automatically adjusts them within pre set limits. In the Flexible Plug and Play project it is envisaged AVCs will be working as part of an Automatic Network Management system.3) Modern Protection Relay. The existing network uses directional over-current (DOC) protection relays which cannot handle reverse power flows. It’s said the modern protection relay will be designed to overcome this problem. It will be tested at the March and Peterborough sub stations.4) Frequent Use Switches. The distribution network in the test area uses isolator switches at Normally Open Points (NOPs) however, they are not designed for frequent use and have to be reset manually. Frequent Use Switches would be controlled remotely, allowing different network configurations to be used.5) Quadrature Booster transformer. Quad Boosters are common on transmission networks but not on distribution grids. According to the Flexible Plug and Play progress report dated June 2012 a Quad Booster could be fitted at the British Sugar factory site in Wissington. Apparently the Combined Heat & Power plant operated by British Sugar has seasonal limits on generation export due to the suboptimal loading of the three <b>incoming</b> 33kV <b>circuits.</b> The Quadrature Booster will be connected to one of the circuits to ensure load balancing and it will enable the export of additional generation from the CHP unit onto the electricity grid.|$|R
40|$|Oaky Creek Coal Mine uses Jiffy Drive Conveyors {{to extend}} the {{production}} and development conveyor systems underground temporarily whilst waiting for permanent conveyor systems to be manufactured. The existing Jiffy Drive starters are enclosed in a flameproof enclosure that conformed to AS 3800 which was needed when located in ERZ (Explosive Risk Zone) designated areas. Additionally an Austdac control panel had to be mounted separately to the starting panel in a NERZ (Non Explosive Risk Zone) as it was not located in a flameproof enclosure. Due their age and changes in mining technology Oaky Creek Coal {{decided it was time}} to overhaul one of their Jiffy Drive Conveyor starting panels named JD 21 into an IP 56, 316 stainless steel enclosure that also incorporated the Austdac control system. Because of the high standard of work and vast industry experience Comlek was chosen to overhaul the design, manufacture and factory acceptance test (FAT) JD 21. With JD 21 in this configuration it will result a modern, reliable product that does not require constant maintenance to ensure that it conforms to the flameproof standard. The main objective for the project is to design a new enclosure for JD 21 that segregates the <b>incoming</b> mains <b>circuit</b> breaker and the control system out of 316 stainless steel. As a part of the new design JD 21 will make use of a PLC that will reduce the number of components required in the control circuit. It will be programmed to work with a Human Machine Interface (HMI) panel view, which will reduce the amount of indication and push button switches needed. There will be an extra cubicle added to the enclosure that will house and Austdac signal generator panel that will allow dupline signal transmission and receiving from field instruments located on the conveyor itself. Upon completion of the project Comlek will handover one fully operational, fully factory acceptance tested (FAT) Jiffy Drive Starter with designation and signage to suit JD 21. Oaky Creek Coal will receive a dossier that includes a user manual and all relevant drawings and schematics of JD 21...|$|R
