40|$|The main {{scope of}} this paper is to present a set of <b>enabling</b> <b>services</b> that support the {{establishment}} and management of Virtual Enterprises and the integration and interoperation of business processes.

The appropriate <b>enabling</b> <b>services</b> are identified, analyzed and certain details regarding their design is given. These <b>enabling</b> <b>services</b> are the VE contract manager, the BP administrator, and the BP controller. Underlying services needed for the integration and execution of shared business processes are also proposed.
