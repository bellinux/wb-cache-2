5|$|A {{standard}} analogy for compactification is {{to consider}} a multidimensional object such as a garden <b>hose.</b> If the <b>hose</b> is viewed from a sufficient distance, {{it appears to have}} only one dimension, its length, but as one approaches the <b>hose,</b> one discovers that it contains a second dimension, its circumference. Thus, an ant crawling inside it would move in two dimensions.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} to self-contained breathing systems is to supply breathing gases {{from the surface}} through a <b>hose.</b> When combined with a communication cable, a pneumofathometer <b>hose</b> and a safety line {{it is called the}} diver's umbilical, which may include a hot water <b>hose</b> for heating, video cable and breathing gas reclaim line. More basic equipment that uses only an air <b>hose</b> is called an airline or hookah system. This allows the diver to breathe using an air supply <b>hose</b> from a cylinder or compressor at the surface. Breathing gas is supplied through a mouth-held demand valve or light full-face mask. It is used for work such as hull cleaning and archaeological surveys, for shellfish harvesting, and as snuba, a shallow water activity typically practised by tourists and those who are not scuba-certified.|$|E

50|$|The {{traditional}} {{solution is}} to use metal pipes to transfer water but these are costly to deliver and assemble. Thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) covered <b>hoses</b> and Nitrile rubber (NBR) covered <b>hoses</b> {{have a lot of}} advantages compared to metal pipes. It is easy to deliver, assemble and disassemble <b>hoses</b> and long sections of NBR- and TPU-covered <b>hoses</b> reduce the possibility of leakage in connecting parts. These large-diameter NBR- and TPU-covered <b>hoses</b> are called fracking <b>hoses.</b>|$|R
40|$|Single and {{two-phase}} {{heat transport}} {{systems for the}} thermal control of large space facilities require fluid lines that traverse joints and either rotate or move in some other manner. Flexible <b>hoses</b> are being considered as one means of traversing these joints. To test the resilience of flexible <b>hoses</b> to bending stress, a test assembly was constructed {{to determine the number}} of flexing cycles the <b>hoses</b> could withstand before losing their ability to maintain a constant pressure. Corrugated metal <b>hoses</b> and Teflon <b>hoses</b> were tested at different pressures with nitrogen gas. The metal <b>hoses</b> had lives ranging from 30, 000 to 100, 000 flexing cycles. But, even after 400, 000 cycles, the Teflon <b>hoses</b> remained essentially intact, though some leakage in the convoluted Teflon is noted...|$|R
50|$|Big tricoise {{wrenches}} {{are placed}} in fire trucks, and are mainly used to fasten the big <b>hoses,</b> e.g. ∅110 mm <b>hoses</b> to feed the pumper tank from the hydrant (∅100 mm for the clutch). Small tricoise are made of brass and hang at the fire belts; {{they are used to}} fasten the small <b>hoses,</b> e.g., ∅70mm to ∅22mm <b>hoses</b> (∅65mm to ∅20mm clutches).|$|R
5|$|Hard suction <b>hose</b> {{can also}} be used to extend the range of a water tender's dumping capability, if the {{fittings}} of the hard suction <b>hose</b> match those of the tender dumping water. This could be used to fill a portable dump tank not immediately adjacent to the water tender, from which another fire engine can draft. Since water movement during dumping relies on gravity, rather than mechanical pressurization, hard suction <b>hose</b> is useful for this task.|$|E
5|$|Around 1954, NATC {{modified}} the sole surviving XAJ-1 to conduct inflight refueling tests using the probe and drogue configuration. The turbojet engine was removed and the fuel <b>hose</b> and its drogue extended {{out from the}} jet's former exhaust opening. Aircraft in service retained the turbojet and had their bomb bay doors modified to accommodate the <b>hose</b> and drogue. They were refueling aircraft during late 1954.|$|E
5|$|Dead trees pose {{a safety}} risk, {{especially}} during high winds and severe storms, and removing dead trees involves a financial burden, whereas {{the presence of}} healthy trees can clean the air, increase property values, and reduce {{the temperature of the}} built environment and thereby reduce building cooling costs. During times of drought, trees can fall into water stress, which may cause a tree to become more susceptible to disease and insect problems, and ultimately may lead to a tree's death. Irrigating trees during dry periods can reduce the risk of water stress and death. Irrigation can be accomplished by use of a garden <b>hose,</b> soaker <b>hose,</b> sprinkler, or modified five-gallon bucket.|$|E
40|$|On this study, {{usefulness}} of new various sizes in girth of panty <b>hoses</b> was examined with wearing test of panty <b>hoses</b> (of new size and present size) and measurement of body size. The reserch about consciousness for panty <b>hoses</b> (for example, the price, {{the way of}} buying, and so on) was also carried out to {{women who have been}} wearing the panty <b>hoses</b> in daily life. The results were summarized as follows. 1. New vafious sizes in circumference of panty <b>hoses</b> is prefered to present size of them, and usefullness of new size is proved. 2. It is recognized that the discontent with the length of panty <b>hoses</b> is still remaind under the new size products. Therefore, the development of various sizes toward the length of panty <b>hoses</b> is desired. 3. The good fitness is precious factor for the consumer next to the price and color. 4. It is important that the information and knowledge of the size of panty <b>hoses</b> must be diffused for the consumer...|$|R

5|$|On 12 February 2003, Dechaineux was {{operating}} near her maximum safe diving depth {{off the coast}} of Western Australia when a seawater <b>hose</b> burst. The high-pressure seawater flooded the lower engine room before the <b>hose</b> was sealed off: it was estimated that if the inflow had continued for another twenty seconds, the weight of the water would have prevented Dechaineux from returning to the surface. The RAN recalled the Collins-class submarines to base after the incident; after engineers were unable to determine any flaws in the pipes that could have caused the incident, the maximum safe diving depth of the class was reduced.|$|E
5|$|When Engine Co. 22 arrived, it {{was ordered}} to pump water on the {{warehouse}}. The company's firefighters entered the warehouse and dragged a <b>hose</b> up a staircase to direct water onto the fourth floor. When heavy black smoke began coming down the stairway, Foreman Garrett B. Lane ordered his firemen to evacuate. Fireman Francis Hart, Jr., became trapped while trying to collect the <b>hose</b> {{and was forced to}} flee to the roof and escape over neighboring rooftops.|$|E
5|$|Before Rommel was {{assigned}} {{defense of the}} Atlantic Wall, obstacles to amphibious landing were being built upon the beaches of Belgium and France. On February 3, 1944 {{during a visit to}} the beach at Neufchâtel-Hardelot, Rommel was shown a method by which local troops employed a high pressure water <b>hose</b> to quickly create a hole in beach sand, one which could be used to set high wooden stakes (Hochpfähle) into the beach as an obstacle to landing craft. The water <b>hose</b> method took three minutes, fifteen times faster than using a pile driver. Rommel ordered such methods to be used to place wooden beams, metal rails and other obstructions along the beaches of Normandy. Nearly 11,000 were emplaced in the south part of Normandy's coastline where the Allies would eventually land.|$|E
40|$|A new {{physical}} {{model of the}} <b>hosing</b> instability that includes relativistic laser pulses and moderate densities is presented and derives the density dependence of the <b>hosing</b> equation. This is tested against two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. These simulations further examine the feasibility of using multiple pulses to mitigate the <b>hosing</b> instability in a Nd:glass-type parameter space. An examination {{of the effects of}} planar versus cylindrical exponential density gradients on the <b>hosing</b> instability is also presented. The results show that strongly relativistic pulses and more planar geometries are capable of mitigating the <b>hosing</b> instability which is in line with the predictions of the {{physical model}}...|$|R

5|$|Homer and Bart {{arrive at}} the school during the school-dance to steal the grease in the school's kitchen which Bart told him about. They sneak {{into the kitchen and}} plants a <b>hose</b> in the fryer to suck it into the car, but Willie spots them and {{attempts}} to stop them, claiming the grease to be his retirement plan. Homer tries to escape, but Willie grabs his legs and strangles him with the <b>hose</b> sucking the grease, which explodes due to the increased pressure, causing the grease to flood into the dance hall. A grease fight begins among the students, where Alex eventually joins in after being told by Lisa to act her own age.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hose</b> Company #12, {{and later}} <b>Hose</b> Company #11, hired the first African-American firefighters in the city. One of these {{stations}} was located at 20th and Lake Streets. One {{of the first}} African-American firefighters in Omaha was James C. Greer, Sr. {{who was a member}} of the Omaha Fire Department from May 5, 1906, to August 1, 1933, and was a captain in the department for many years. Horse-drawn wagons were in use when he was assigned to the old No. 11 Station at Thirtieth and Spaulding Streets. He later served at the No. 4 Station at Sixteenth and Izard Streets. He retired as senior captain from the Omaha Fire Department in 1933. His son Richard N. Greer served as a volunteer for the fire department in the 1950s.|$|E

5|$|The mob lit garbage on {{fire and}} stuffed it through the broken windows as the police grabbed a fire <b>hose.</b> Because it had no water pressure, the <b>hose</b> was {{ineffective}} in dispersing the crowd, and seemed only to encourage them. When demonstrators broke through the windows—which had been covered by plywood by the bar owners to deter the police from raiding the bar—the police inside unholstered their pistols. The doors flew open and officers pointed their weapons at the angry crowd, threatening to shoot. The Village Voice writer Howard Smith, in the bar with the police, took a wrench from the bar and stuffed it in his pants, unsure if {{he might have to}} use it against the mob or the police. He watched someone squirt lighter fluid into the bar; as it was lit and the police took aim, sirens were heard and fire trucks arrived. The onslaught had lasted 45minutes.|$|E
