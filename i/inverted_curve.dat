50|$|A {{hard wire}} {{intercom}} {{appears to have}} been provided between Sieber and the engineers in the launch bunker using a system similar to that used in the manned glider flights. Around 1100 am, the M23 was ready for take-off. Low stratus clouds lay over the Ocksenkopf. The Walter liquid-fueled rocket motor built up to full thrust and Sieber pushed the button to ignite the four solid boosters. With a roar, the M23 rose out of a cloud of steam and rocket smoke straight up, displaying its camouflage paintwork. At an altitude of about 100 to 150 m, the Natter suddenly pitched backwards into an <b>inverted</b> <b>curve.</b> Initially it climbed at about 30° to the vertical. At about 500 m the cockpit canopy was seen to fly off. The Natter continued to climb at high speed at an angle of 15° from the horizontal and disappeared into the clouds. The Walter motor stalled about 15 seconds after take-off. It is estimated the Natter reached 1500 m, at which point it nose-dived and hit the ground with great force about 32 seconds later, some kilometres from the launch site. Unknown at the time, one of the Schmidding boosters failed to jettison and its remains were dug up at the crash site in 1998.|$|E

40|$|For decades, many {{financial}} {{economists have}} suspected that an <b>inverted</b> yield <b>curve</b> predicts recession. This paper explores {{the accuracy of}} this belief by testing multiple variables and seeing if they result in a recession. The dependent variable tested is probability of a recession; independent variables tested are: three-month Treasury-bill minus ten-year Treasury note; controls include: three-month Treasury-bill yield to maturity, ten-year Treasury-note yield to maturity, number of months since last recession, equal-weighted return on the S 2 ̆ 6 P 500, value-weighted return minus equal-weighted return, return on the S 2 ̆ 6 P 500, rate of inflation, and {{the interaction between the}} difference between the three-month Treasury-bill and the ten-year Treasury-note. The null hypothesis {{is that there is no}} relationship between the variables and the likelihood of a recession. Failing to reject the null illustrates that there is a relationship between the <b>inverted</b> yield <b>curve</b> and the likelihood of a recession. Using logistic regression models, I find that when the previous month is not part of a recession, we fail to reject the null hypothesis because there is a relationship between the <b>inverted</b> yield <b>curve</b> and the likelihood of a recession. Consequently, the <b>inverted</b> yield <b>curve</b> is like â€˜famine, the third horsemen of the apocalypse. â€™ My model shows that all the other variables are significant in revealing that the <b>inverted</b> yield <b>curve</b> is not the only predictor of a recession...|$|R

40|$|Theory predicts {{democracy}} should reduce corruption. Yet, numerous {{scholars have}} found empirically that corruption decreases {{at high levels}} of democracy but actually increases at low levels. A key weaknesses of studies that aim to explain this inverted curvilinear relationship, however, {{is that they do}} not disaggregate the complex concept of democracy. By contrast, this working paper disaggregates democracy theoretically and empirically. Our theoretical framework shows how components of democracy affect costs and benefits of engaging in corruption and, therefore, the level of corruption overall. Whereas other studies examine only how democratic accountability imposes costs on those engaging in corruption and thus illuminate only the downward curve of the relationship, we also examine the transaction costs and political support benefits of corruption and therefore can explain the initial uptick in corruption at low levels of democracy. Using measures of democratic components from Varieties of Democracy, we examine 173 countries from 1900 to 2012 and find that freedoms of expression and association exhibit the inverted curvilinear relationship with corruption, and that judicial constraints have a negative linear relationship. Moreover, the introduction of elections and the quality of elections act jointly, but each in a linear fashion. The mere introduction of elections increases corruption, thus accounting for the upward sloping segment of the <b>inverted</b> <b>curve.</b> Once the quality of elections begins to improve, corruption decreases, resulting in the downward-sloping segment of the curve.

25|$|The {{opposite}} position (short-term {{interest rates}} higher than long-term) can also occur. For instance, in November 2004, the yield curve for UK Government bonds was partially inverted. The yield for the 10-year bond stood at 4.68%, but was only 4.45% for the 30-year bond. The market's anticipation of falling interest rates causes such incidents.
