40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the relationships between}} stock fundamental ratios and idiosyncratic volatility from 1993 to 2010 for Australian Securities Exchange listed companies. The portfolio analysis results show that high idiosyncratic volatility companies tend to be small (measured by size), highly leveraged (measured by <b>interest</b> <b>cover</b> <b>ratio),</b> low profitability (measured by return on equity and earnings per share), low valuation (measured by price to earnings ratio) companies. The regression analysis results show that dividend yield is positively related to the idiosyncratic volatility. Price to earnings ratio and return on equity are negatively related to the idiosyncratic volatility. The relationships between the idiosyncratic volatility and the stock fundamental ratios remain robustness in presence of size. JEL classification: G 1...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} new {{technique}} to compute non-dominated solutions, with an error {{that can be made}} as low as the user wants, in multiple objective linear fractional programming (MOLFP), using reference points. The basic idea is to divide, by the approximate ‘middle’, the non-dominate region in two sub-regions and to analyze each of them {{in order to try to}} discard one. The process is repeated with the remaining region and it ends when the regions are so little that the differences among their non-dominated solutions are lower than a predefined error. The results of several tests to the technique performance are reported. We also report a financial planning model with multiple linear fractional objectives, and propose a straightforward computational tool implementing the above mentioned technique to help the decision maker (DM) finding the most preferred non-dominated solution. The financial planning model includes three objective functions: (1) the maximization of the company net present value; (2) the maximization of the average <b>interest</b> <b>cover</b> <b>ratio</b> during the planning period; and (3) the maximization of a productivity ratio. The management of the company has to evaluate a set of investment projects, simultaneously considering a series of financing decisions like: the balance of funds, dividend distribution policy, debt and equity issuing limitations. We tested the model with a set of 10 projects over a 6 year planning period resulting on a problem with 45 decision variables and 38 constraints. The computation technique proved to be fast enough to deal with this model in an interactive way, using a desktop computer...|$|E

Its necessitate that the R & D expenditures must be accounted in the comprehensive income statement, and none of the intangible assets are considered from the R & D research phases must be accounted as an asset in the statement of financial position. For the data collection, the total samples size contains of 105 firms with 525 observations, from the audited financial statements of the public listed companies at Colombo Stock Exchange, which are engaged with the R & D activities over the period of last five financial years between 2010 / 2011 and 2014 / 2015. Those samples are adopted with the random and stratified sampling techniques as well as the multivariate quantitative technique is selected as the research technique to measure the financial performance of the firm by using the selected accounting based indicators. Such as; <b>Interest</b> <b>cover</b> <b>ratio</b> (ICR), Price-earnings ratio (PER), Capital structure gearing ratio (CSGR), Return on invested capital employed (ROICE), Earnings per share stock (EPSS), Dividend yield ratio (DYR), Return on assets ratio (ROAR), Asset turnover ratio (ATR) and Dividend cover ratio (DCR). The results could be concluded as; the expensed R & D positively associates with DCR, negatively associates with EPSS, positively associates with CSGR with does not have any substantial impact and negatively associates with ROAR, ROICE, DYR and PER. On the other hand the capitalised R & D has substantial negative association on ROAR, ROICE and EPSS; meanwhile it’s positively associates with CSGR but does not have any substantial impact and negatively associates with DYR, DCR and PER...|$|E

40|$|Contrary to the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH), styles-based {{variables}} of value, size and momentum {{have been well}} documented to show strong associations with cross-sectional equity returns on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (Hoffman, 2012; C. Muller & Ward, 2013) and on international stock exchanges (Carhart, 1997; Fama & French, 1992). Yet little research has exclusively focused on style-based variables and the JSE listed property sector. It is worth noting the total market value of property stocks or {{real estate investment trusts}} (REITs) has grown rapidly both in South African and Internationally. In 1995 the market capitalisation of the JSE listed property sector was R 15 billion, but by November 2015 this had grown to a market capitalisation of R 665 billion (iNET Bridge, 2015). This research study examined the effects of 22 style-based variables on all JSE listed property companies over the period December 1995 to December 2015. The style-based variables included property specific variables, such as geography location, sector allocation, and vacancy percentage. Since such data was not readily available from financial data libraries, a database was created directly from the financial statements reported by each company. The same methodology and graphical time series approach as C. Muller and Ward (2013) was used to evaluate the performance of the examined styles. The study found that portfolios constructed on the basis of ranked style-variables exhibited significant effects over the period. Most notably, both the size (market capitalisation) and value (earnings yield) effects showed significant excess returns and linear relationships, but persistence has not been evident after 2010. Other style-variables that exhibited effects over the period were: total geographic concentration, price to NAV, vacancy percentage of portfolio, value traded, value traded as a percentage of market capitalisation, <b>interest</b> <b>cover</b> <b>ratio,</b> loan to value and geographic international percentage. Furthermore, the study found no evidence of the momentum effect, which was found to be the best performing strategy by C. Muller and Ward (2013) for general equities.

40|$|ABSTRACT] In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the urban environment, the vegetation information is very important. This information should be constructed as the expression of real vegetation, not as that of scale or usage, and also updated to accommodate the change of vegetation. The vegetation <b>cover</b> <b>ratio</b> in a pixel using the remote sensing data simulated by airborne MSS data with high resolution was examined. In this examination a correct vegetation coverage is needed to establish assumption algorithm of vegetation <b>cover</b> <b>ratio</b> in a pixel. This map was constructed by airborne MSS data of high resolution and airborne photograph, which is verified by field investigation. The remote sensing data of low resolution was simulated by high resolution airborne data. The vegetation <b>cover</b> <b>ratio</b> in a pixel {{is defined as the}} ratio of correct vegetation in one pixel of simulated data. On the view point of mixel, the relationship between the vegetation <b>cover</b> <b>ratio</b> in a pixel and the mean NVI (normalized vegetation index) was investigated. This investigation was seen that the relationship between the vegetation <b>cover</b> <b>ratio</b> in a pixel and the mean NVI was linear. On the basis of this relationship, the vegetation <b>cover</b> <b>ratio</b> in a pixel can be assumed by NVI of remote sensing data...|$|R
40|$|Eleven sites, {{representing}} different urban morphologies across central Beijing, {{are used}} to simulate urban heat island effects and explore the relationship between urban planning indicators and climate indicators such as daily maximum and minimum surface temperatures. The results indicate that mesoscale urban planning indicators can explain {{the majority of the}} urban climate differences among the sites. For example, green <b>cover</b> <b>ratio</b> and floor area ratio can explain 94. 47 - 98. 57 % of the variance for daily maximum surface temperature, green <b>cover</b> <b>ratio</b> and building height can explain 98. 94 - 99. 12 % of the variance for daily minimum surface temperature, and floor area <b>ratio,</b> green <b>cover</b> <b>ratio</b> and building density together can explain 99. 49 - 99. 69 % of the variance for time of peak surface temperature. Furthermore, green <b>cover</b> <b>ratio</b> is identified as the most significant urban planning indicator affecting the urban thermal environment. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|For 3 -D {{building}} reconstructions {{of urban}} areas, {{we present a}} fully automatic shape recovery method that uses 3 -D points acquired from aerial image sequences. This paper focuses on shape recovery of flat rooftops that are parallel to the ground. We recover each rooftop from a set of 3 -D points located at nearly the same height. Such 3 -D point sets are made by merging point sets under the MDL (Minimum Description Length) principle, which finds suitably concise point sets for 3 -D building models. Often, only parts of rooftop shapes can be recovered because of the 3 -D position errors being generated in the points. To refine the recovered shapes, we merge the parts under a heuristic condition in which shapes will have a pair of orthogonally oriented edges. To optimize parameters and estimate the viability of our method, we defined a success rate, called the <b>cover</b> <b>ratio,</b> as {{the area in which}} the recovered shape and a correct shape (given as reference data) overlap to the combined area of the recovered and correct shapes. Experimental results showed that our method achieved a <b>cover</b> <b>ratio</b> of 75. 25 %, and through improved <b>cover</b> <b>ratio</b> we also confirmed effectiveness of shape refinement. We also found that even if only one-ninth of the reference data could be used in the optimization of parameters, the <b>cover</b> <b>ratio</b> was 70. 96 %. The experimental results we obtained showed that our point-based method was effective in enabling the recovery of buildings in urban areas...|$|R
