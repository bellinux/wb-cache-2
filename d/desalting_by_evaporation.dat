40|$|A {{comprehensive}} study {{to find the}} optimal sample preparation conditions for two-dimensional electrophoresis (2 -DE) analysis of Prorocentrum triestinum, a model causative agent of harmful algal blooms (HABs) was carried out. The four major sample preparation steps for 2 -DE: (a) cell disruption: i. e. sonication and homogenization with glass beads; (b) protein extraction: i. e. sequential and independent extraction procedures; (c) pre-electrophoretic treatment: these included (i) treatment with RNAase/DNAase or benzonase; (ii) ultracentrifugation to sediment large macromolecules such as DNA; (iii) <b>desalting</b> and concentration <b>by</b> ultrafiltration through a Microcon centrifugal filter device (MWCO: 3000 daltons); and (iv) <b>desalting</b> <b>by</b> a micro BioSpin chromatography column (MWCO: 6000 daltons); and (d) rehydration buffers, reducing agents and sample application in the first dimension isoelectric focussing were studied. Our results showed that sonication is easy to perform and resulted in a higher protein yield. Among the four extraction buffers, the urea containing buffers resulted in the extraction of the highest amount of protein while tris(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane buffers and trichloroacetic acid (TCA) /acetone precipitation allowed detection of a higher number of protein species (i. e. protein spots). <b>Desalting</b> <b>by</b> BioSpin and ultrafiltration have improved the 2 -DE resolution of the water soluble fraction but have less effect on urea containing fractions. TCA/acetone precipitation was able to desalt all protein fractions independent of the extraction media, however extended exposure to this low pH medium has caused protein modification. Introduction of either DNase/RNase or benzonase treatment did not improve the discriminatory power of the 2 -DE but this treatment did yield 2 -DE with the clearest background. Proteolytic digestion was inhibited by addition of a protease inhibitor cocktail. Taken overall, a combination of sequential extraction and <b>desalting</b> <b>by</b> BioSpin chromatography for sample treatment before first dimension of 2 -DE gave best results based on its simplicity and minimal protein loss. Finally, triscarboxyethylphosphine (TCEP) has performed well as a reducing agent in both the rehydration and equilibration buffers. The rehydration buffer found to be best {{in this study was}} 8. 0 M urea, 2 % 3 -[(3 -cholamidoprphyldimethylamino]- 1 -propanesulfonate, 4 mM TCEP and 1 % immobilized pH gradient buffer. Subsequently, we applied this finding and performed 2 -DE analysis on the soluble protein fractions extracted from light-starved cultured algal cells (nonblooming) and cultured cells grown under optimal conditions (blooming). 2 -DE maps of these algal cultures were visibly different and many differentially expressed proteins were found.
