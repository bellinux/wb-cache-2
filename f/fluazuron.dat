50|$|Synthetic {{chemical}} pesticides specific for ticks (acaricides) {{are suspended}} {{in water for}} application to the hair coat of domestic animals. Cattle can be immersed in dip-baths containing dipwash, or soaked using a pressurized spray-race made of metal tubing and nozzles. Sheep can be treated in smaller dips or showers. Acaricides {{can be applied to}} dogs in watery shampoo formulations. Acaricide-active ingredients are usually soluble in oil. This makes them suitable for concentrated oily formulations which spread from a pour-on applicator over the hair coat. Alternatively, some acaricides are incorporated in polyvinylchoride plastic ear tags for cattle, or collars for dogs. 7 Modern acaricides belong to the general classes of organophosphates (example chlorfenvinphos), formamidines (example amitraz), synthetic pyrethroids (example flumethrin), phenylpyrazoles (example fipronil), and benzylphenyl ureas (example <b>fluazuron).</b> 2 When correctly applied, they can be highly effective. Problems with acaricides are: danger of acute poisoning of treated animals and human staff; residues contaminating meat and milk; environmental contamination especially water sources; resistance that ticks acquire to acaricides; and cost of application. Cost and contamination can be reduced by seasonal timing of application (strategic treatment) based on ecological knowledge. Prediction of best times for treatment can be made using computerized models of the population dynamics of ticks. Farmers lacking sufficient cash to purchase manufactured synthetic acaricides often use various herbal treatments, locally available. Nicotine as treated tobacco leaf is an example, but such unregistered preparations require careful use to avoid poisoning or skin damage.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Aiming to {{characterize}} the potential off-target effects of <b>fluazuron</b> on ticks, biochemical {{analyses were conducted to}} evaluate changes in the carbohydrate metabolism of Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus ticks after exposure to <b>fluazuron.</b> Hemolymph and fat body were collected from female ticks before and after (4, 8 and 15 days) exposure to <b>fluazuron.</b> Spectrophotometric analyses were done to quantify glucose concentration and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in the hemolymph and the concentration of glycogen in the tick’s fat body. High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) was employed to determine the concentration of carboxylic acids in the hemolymph and to evaluate changes in intermediary metabolic processes requiring oxygen consumption. Increases in the levels of LDH activity and lactic acid concentration indicated that <b>fluazuron</b> enhanced fermentative metabolism in ticks. Exposure to <b>fluazuron</b> was also found to increase glucose concentrations in the hemolymph over time, although no significant differences were noted daily. In addition to expanding the body of knowledge about the mode of action of <b>fluazuron,</b> investigations into these mechanisms may also be useful in discovering new and as yet unexplored secondary effects...|$|E

40|$|Objective. To {{demonstrate}} {{the effect on}} the tick population of the use of <b>fluazuron</b> in grazing cattle. Materials and methods. Case study performed in Fusagasuga (Cundinamarca, Colombia); three groups of 25 heifers each were formed, G 1 = two applications of <b>Fluazuron</b> separated 60 days, G 2 = <b>fluazuron</b> applied only on study day 0 and G 3 = treated with a spray of chlorpyriphos. Periodically tick count was done in five animals of each group and the degree of contamination of pastures with tick larvae was determined by dragging. Results. Infestation levels between the groups were not homogeneous, and the paddocks also showed different levels of larval infestation. The compound was useful for protecting animals from tick infestation for more than eight weeks. Given the soil temperature in the region, the adult larva period is fulfilled between 50 and 65 days. Conclusion. The effect of treatment of cattle with <b>fluazuron</b> on larval contamination of pastures will only be reflected almost two months after treatment. Strategic design schemes must consider this component, of the soil temperature...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{most common}} {{treatments}} for scabies in human and veterinary settings are topical 5 % permethrin or systemic treatment with ivermectin. However, these treatments {{have very little}} activity against arthropod eggs, and therefore repeated treatment is frequently required. In-vitro, biochemical and molecular {{studies have demonstrated that}} human mites are becoming increasingly resistant to both acaricides. To identify alternate acaricides, we undertook a pilot study of the in vivo activity of the benzoylphenyl urea inhibitor of chitin synthesis, <b>fluazuron,</b> in pigs with sarcoptic mange. Findings: Pigs (n = 5) were infested with S. scabei var suis, and randomised to treatment at the start of peak infestation with <b>fluazuron</b> at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day per os for 7 days (n = 3) or no treatment (n = 2). Clinical scores, skin scrapings for mite counts and blood sampling for pharmacokinetic analysis were undertaken. <b>Fluazuron</b> was well absorbed in treated pigs with measureable blood levels up to 4 weeks post treatment. No adverse effects were observed. Modest acaricidal activity of the compound was observed, with a reduction in severity of skin lesions in treated pigs, as well as a reduction in number of scabies mite's early life stages. Conclusions: The moderate efficacy of <b>fluazuron</b> against scabies mites indicates a lead to the development of alternate treatments for scabies, such as combination therapies that maybe applicable for human use in the future...|$|E

40|$|Small {{stock farming}} and {{production}} accounted for approximately 8. 4 % of total animal product based agricultural output in the 2011 / 2012 season in South Africa. Large scale commercial farming aside, small stock farming also takes on {{an important role}} in poorer and developing rural areas of South Africa, where small stock are kept for a combination of economic and non-economic reasons including financial investment or security, food and resource production, as well as religious or traditional reasons. Blowflies are Dipterids with complex life cycles and complete metamorphoses, causing damage to hides and frequent death in their ovine hosts, as a result of cutaneous myiasis caused by the larval stages. All economically important blowfly species causing veterinary myiasis belong to the superfamily Oestroidea, which contains the three major families Oestridae, Calliphoridae and Sarcophidae. The two most significant blowfly genera in South Africa, Lucillia and Chrysomya, both belong to the family Calliphoridae. Chemical means of preventing and treating blowfly strike by topical application remains the most widely used method and appears to be indispensable at this stage. New molecules or formulations effective against blowfly strike are constantly being sought and form part of an active field of research. Bayer currently manufactures and markets Drastic Deadline Extreme ®, a pour-on formulation containing flumethrin and <b>fluazuron</b> for the control of blue ticks (Rhipicephalus decoloratus) in cattle; its possible action against blowflies in sheep was investigated in an in-vitro model, subsequent to a pilot pharmacokinetic study evaluating the kinetics of <b>fluazuron</b> when applied topically to sheep in this particular combination. The first objective of the project was to determine whether <b>fluazuron</b> has any effect at all on the development of blowfly larvae. An active ingredient from the same family of compounds, namely triflumeron, has been successfully used for several years to control blowfly strike in sheep in South Africa (Zapp ® Pour on - Bayer), but it was uncertain whether or not <b>fluazuron</b> would be effective. Raw <b>fluazuron</b> was applied to six pieces of beef according to a dose calculation based on the registered dose of the test product in cattle, while another six pieces were treated with saline in a similar fashion (n= 6). Each piece of beef was placed in its own container along with six late instar larvae and placed in the incubator at 35 °C for a further nine days. In this instance, the treated group demonstrated significant development defects with regard to pupation (uneclosed pupae) when analysed using the Mann-Whitney non-parametric t-test (p = 0. 002).

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to evaluate the efficacy of pour-on formulations of <b>fluazuron</b> and ivermectin in different therapeutic protocols for treatment of demodicosis by means of quantifying mites with skin scraping, histological and clinical evaluation in dogs. Eighteen dogs with skin scrapings positive for Demodex canis were evaluated, divided into three groups. All the animals were treated every 14 days, completing 6 treatments for each animal (days 0, 14, 28, 42, 56 and 70). In group 1, pour-on 2. 5 % <b>fluazuron</b> was used at the dose of 20 mg/kg; in the group 2 pour-on 2. 5 % <b>fluazuron</b> at a dose of 20 mg/kg in association with pour-on 0. 5 % ivermectin at the dose of 0. 6 mg/kg; and in group 3, pour-on 0. 5 % ivermectin alone was used, at the dose of 0. 6 mg/kg. The treatment was evaluated and monitored through skin scrapings and clinical follow-up of the lesions every 14 days for 84 days, and through histopathological examination at the end of each treatment protocol. The success rate was defined as the percentage of dogs in each group that had negative skin scrapings after the treatment: this was 16. 67 % for group 1, and 50 % for groups 2 and 3. The reduction in mite counts reached effectiveness of 67. 66 %, 88. 99 % and 84. 29 % for groups 1, 2 and 3 respectively. The Wilcoxon test showed that there was a significant difference between the number of mites before and after treatment in groups 2 and 3. The histopathological examination revealed that only group 1 showed no significant difference in the intensity of infestation between days 0 and 84. Clinically, there was no significant difference between the evaluation before and after treatment in the three groups. pour-on 2. 5 % <b>fluazuron</b> and pour-on 0. 5 % ivermectin were not effective for treating canine demodicosis, either in association or as single therapy, when applied every 14 days for a period of 70 days.

Six tick-free cattle {{were placed on the}} pasture and treated 7 days later (Day 0) with the pour-on. They were retreated on Days 63, 126 and 189 and monthly tick counts were done. Mean numbers of adult R. decoloratus and/or R. microplus decreased from 53 and 14 on Days 56 and 112 respectively to 2 or less on all other occasions including Day 254. Compared to the numbers of R. decoloratus and/or R. microplus [GRAPHICS]. larvae collected from vegetation in the previous year, larval numbers declined by 40. 7 % on Day 28, and thereafter reduction remained between 84 % and 100 %. Pairs of tracer calves placed on the pasture for 7 days each month were then held in pens and adult ticks that detached collected. Reduction in the numbers of R. decoloratus collected from tracer animals was 75 % on Day 56 and remained above 93 % except for Day 224 when it temporarily decreased to 78. 5 %. Reduction in the numbers of R. microplus was 97. 5 % on Day 28 and remained above 98 % until the conclusion of the study on Day 254. Treatment with the pour-on formulation of <b>fluazuron</b> and flumethrin resulted in a marked decrease in the numbers of R. decoloratus and/or R. microplus on treated cattle followed by a reduction in the numbers of larvae questing on the vegetation and ticks picked up by tracer calves.

40|$|Commercial feedlots for {{beef cattle}} {{finishing}} are {{potential sources of}} a range of trace chemicals which have human health or environmental significance. To ensure adequate protection of human and environmental health from exposure to these chemicals, the application of effective manure and effluent management practices is warranted. The Australian meat and livestock industry has adopted a proactive approach to the identification of best management practices. Accordingly, this review was undertaken to identify key chemical species that may require consideration in the development of guidelines for feedlot manure and effluent management practices in Australia. Important classes of trace chemicals identified include steroidal hormones, antibiotics, ectoparasiticides, mycotoxins, heavy metals and dioxins. These are described in terms of their likely sources, expected concentrations and public health or environmental significance based on international data and research. Androgenic hormones such as testosterone and trenbolone are significantly active in feedlot wastes, but they are poorly understood in terms of fate and environmental implications. The careful management of residues of antibiotics including virginiamycin, tylosin and oxytetracycline appears prudent in terms of minimising the risk of potential public health impacts from resistant strains of bacteria. Good management of ectoparasiticides including synthetic pyrethroids, macrocyclic lactones, <b>fluazuron,</b> and amitraz is important for the prevention of potential ecological implications, particularly towards dung beetles. Very few of these individual chemical contaminants have been thoroughly investigated in terms of concentrations, effects and attenuation in Australian feedlot wastes. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|This {{manuscript}} {{provides a}} summary of the results presented at a symposium organized to accumulate information on factors that influence the prevalence of acaricide resistance and tick-borne diseases. This symposium was part of the 19 th International Conference of the World Association for the Advancement of Veterinary Parasitology (WAAVP), held in New Orleans, LA, USA, during August 10 - 14, 2003. Populations of southern cattle ticks, Boophilus microplus, from Mexico have developed resistance to many classes of acaricide including chlorinated hydrocarbons (DDT), pyrethroids, organ ophosphates, and formamidines (amitraz). Target site mutations are the most common resistance mechanism observed, but there are examples of metabolic mechanisms. In many pyrethroid resistant strains, a single target site mutation on the Na+ channel confers very high resistance (resistance ratios: > 1000 x) to both DDT and all pyrethroid acaricides. Acetylcholine esterase affinity for OPs is changed in resistant tick populations. A second mechanism of OP resistance is linked to cytochrome P 450 monooxygenase activity. A PCR-based assay to detect a specific sodium channel gene mutation that is associated with resistance to permethrin has been developed. This assay can be performed on individual ticks at any life stage with results available in a few hours. A number of Mexican strains of B. microplus with varying profiles of pesticide resistance have been genotyped using this test. Additionally, a specific metabolic esterase with permethrin-hydrolyzing activity, CzEst 9, has been purified and its gene coding region cloned. This esterase has been associated with high resistance to permethrin in one Mexican tick population. Work is continuing to clone specific acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and carboxylesterase genes that appear to be involved in resistance to organophosphates. Our ultimate goal is the design of a battery of DNA- or ELISA-based assays capable of rapidly genotyping individual ticks to obtain a comprehensive profile of their susceptibility to various pesticides. More outbreaks of clinical bovine babesisois and anaplasmosis have been associated with the presence of synthetic pyrethroid (SP) resistance when compared to OP and amidine resistance. This {{may be the result of}} differences in the temporal and geographic patterns of resistance development to the different acaricides. If acaricide resistance develops slowly, herd immunity may not be affected. The use of pesticides for the control of pests of cattle other than ticks can affect the incidence of tick resistance and tick-borne diseases. Simple analytical models of tick- and tsetse-bome diseases suggest that reducing the abundance of ticks, by treating cattle with pyrethroids for example, can have a variety of effects on tick-bome diseases. In the worst-case scenario, the models suggest that treating cattle might not only have no impact on trypanosomosis but could increase the incidence of tick-bome disease. In the best-case, treatment could reduce the incidence of both trypanosomosis and tick-bome diseases Surveys of beef and dairy properties in Queensland for which tick resistance to amitraz was known were intended to provide a clear understanding of the economic and management consequences resistance had on their properties. Farmers continued to use amitraz as the major acaricide for tick control after the diagnosis of resistance, although it was supplemented with moxidectin (dairy farms) or <b>fluazuron,</b> macrocyclic lactones or cypermethrin/ chlorfenvinphos.

40|$|In Australia, {{the cattle}} tick Rhipicephalus microplus has become endemic in the {{tropical}} and subtropical coastal regions of Western Australia, Northern Territory and Queensland (QLD), with outbreaks occurring in north-eastern areas of New South Wales (NSW). The heavy reliance {{on the use of}} acaricides to control this parasite has resulted in the emergence of acaricide resistance to the majority of acaricides, including <b>fluazuron.</b> Acaricide resistance poses a serious threat to the livestock industry and the chemical companies by limiting the effectiveness of chemical tick control measures. Population genetics studies can be performed to understand patterns of tick dispersal and the subsequent spread of resistance, and also to monitor the effectiveness of management strategies that are intended to delay the emergence of resistance. Before this study, there was no information about the population structure of R. microplus in Australia. Therefore, we used thirteen microsatellites to examine the genetic structure of paired susceptible and amitraz-resistant field isolates that were collected from three regions in QLD (southern, northern and central Queensland) and two locations in northern NSW. While all QLD populations exhibited high variability (Ho 0. 67 - 0. 74; with 7. 00 - 9. 82 alleles per locus), three of the four NSW populations showed very low variability (Ho 0. 35 - 0. 48; with 2. 36 - 3. 55 alleles per locus). This is unsurprising given that the NSW populations are outbreaks south of a tick quarantine line and so the low variability is likely to be due to strong founder effects and genetic drift. Except for the susceptible population from southern QLD, all sampled populations showed evidence of past bottlenecks, a likely consequence of the use of acaricides. The significant genetic differentiation of most populations indicated limited tick gene flow and hence likely limited cattle exchange, even between locations from the same region across distances as low as 4. 2 km. There was no clear pattern of differentiation by region or by resistance status, precluding a conclusion on whether resistance arose independently in each region or was spread with tick dispersal. Parasite mating behaviour has an impact on the parasite’s genetic variation and may affect its population structure. Previous studies showed that R. microplus males could have multiple matings with one or several females; however, multiple paternity was not previously confirmed in this species. Using a highly polymorphic microsatellite marker (BmM 1), we were able to confirm multiple paternity among the progeny of ten out of fifteen ticks collected from three cows. The presence of five unique alleles among the progeny, or three unique alleles that could not have been contributed by the female, revealed that the female was successfully fertilised by more than one male. We observed higher heterozygosity levels (average Ho = 0. 8; range 0. 60 – 1. 00) in those progeny sired by more than one male, compared with heterozygosity levels of those sired by a single male (average Ho = 0. 73; range 0. 28 – 1. 00). Multiple paternity reduces the chances of inbreeding and helps to maintain heterozygosity in a population. This observation may contribute to the high diversity we found when we analysed the genetic diversity in two laboratory reference strains (Ho across seven microsatellite loci for NRFS = 0. 64; for Ultimo, Ho = 0. 65). Although many management strategies have been developed in the past to control this tick, their effectiveness has seldom been tested in the field. The rotation of acaricides is one such strategy and it relies on the principle that a tick resistant to one product is not resistant to the second product and that the effect is augmented where there is a fitness cost associated with resistance to one or other of the products used. Hence, the greatest efficacy of this strategy relies on the existence of a fitness cost. Measurement of fitness under field conditions may be complicated by the confounding effect of gene flow from external susceptible populations. Using seven microsatellites and a SNP that is associated with the expression of synthetic pyrethroid resistance, we genotyped tick larvae that were collected at three specific times (Generation 1, Winter 2004 and Winter 2005) from animals that were initially infested with equal proportions of fully susceptible larvae (NRFS laboratory reference strain) and larvae resistant to amitraz and synthetic pyrethroids (Ultimo laboratory reference strain) and subsequently treated with spinosad, amitraz, and a rotation between these two. Under these different levels of selection, we were able to empirically examine the degree of admixture between the amitraz resistant and susceptible ticks to determine if there was a significant or constant fitness cost associated with amitraz resistance. The frequency of the resistance allele in the populations collected in the first generation (no treatment) ranged from 0. 47 to 0. 67, however there was not a clear trend in changes to this frequency in later generations, which was expected because the marker was not under selection pressure. A comparison of the level of mortality in the three treatment groups indicated the existence of a fitness cost to amitraz resistance, noted in the rotation groups where the ticks received less than half the number of amitraz treatments than the amitraz groups. The absence of a fitness cost in the populations from the first generation but its presence in populations collected at subsequent time-points suggested a possible relationship between the fitness cost and environmental conditions, possibly related to lower temperatures. Similar levels of admixture related to the relative contribution of the susceptible and resistance strain were found in all the populations and treatments in both Generation 1 (10. 0 % - 28. 6 %) and Winter 2004 (36. 7 % - 50. 0 %); however, Structure analysis revealed a third cluster in the populations from Winter 2005 that did not follow an specific trend towards the susceptible or resistance strain and likely represented interbreeding between the strains with genetic drift. The molecular confirmation of the fitness cost associated with amitraz resistance, previously detected in the field trials, has implications related to the acaricide control strategies for this tick. Mutations in the para-sodium channel gene in American and Australian R. microplus ticks have been associated with synthetic pyrethroid resistance. In particular, a non-synonymous change at nucleotide position 190, which results in a leucine to isoleucine amino acid substitution (L 64 I) was previously described in Australian ticks. Using this L 64 I SNP, we conducted a survey among fifteen field populations from QLD and NSW with different levels of resistance to the synthetic pyrethroids, cypermethrin and flumethrin. There was a strong relationship (adjusted R 2 = 95. 5 %) between homozygous individuals carrying this mutation and their percentage survival after exposure to a discriminating concentration of cypermethrin in a larval packet test. However, the genotyping of these samples revealed that populations that were resistant only to flumethrin did not have the L 64 I homozygous genotype. Subsequently, we sequenced a 167 bp region that included the domain II S 4 - 5 linker of the same gene in field populations with flumethrin resistance. Importantly, we found a new mutation that resulted in a glycine to valine substitution (G 72 V). Although the frequency of the G 72 V homozygous genotype in each flumethrin resistant population was moderately related to its percentage of survival to flumethrin in the larval packet test (adjusted R 2 = 73. 5 %), this relationship was stronger when heterozygous individuals carrying both L 64 I and G 72 V were added to G 72 V homozygotes individuals (adjusted R 2 = 93. 4 %). This stronger relationship suggested an interaction between the two mutations in the same gene such that flumethrin resistance might be conferred by either two copies of the G 72 V mutation or by being a L 64 I and G 72 V heterozygote...|$|E
