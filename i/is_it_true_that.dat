2500|$|During {{his early}} life, Emerson seems {{to develop a}} {{hierarchy}} of races based on faculty to reason or rather, whether African slaves were distinguishably equal to white men based {{on their ability to}} reason. In a journal entry written in 1822, Emerson wrote about a personal observation: [...] "It can hardly be true that the difference lies in the attribute of reason. I saw ten, twenty, a hundred large lipped, lowbrowed black men in the streets who, except in the mere matter of language, did not exceed the sagacity of the elephant. Now <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> these were created superior to this wise animal, and designed to control it? And in comparison with the highest orders of men, the Africans will stand so low as to make the difference which subsists between themselves & the sagacious beasts inconsiderable." ...|$|E

60|$|Despite his {{conviction}} that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> useless to struggle longer against such injustice, he lived through the night, and came down late to breakfast, which he found stale, and without the compensating advantage of finding himself alone at the table. Some ladies had lingered there to clear up on the best authority the distracting rumors concerning him which they had heard the day before.

Bartley gave a sarcastic confirmation to all these reports, and went out to the printing-office to gather up some things of his. He found Henry Bird there, looking pale and sick, but at work, and seemingly in authority. This was what Bartley had always intended when he should go out, but he did not like it, and he resented some small changes that had already been made in the editor's room, in tacit recognition of his purpose not to occupy it again.|$|R
