500|$|Eventually, the Skinkers found {{a man in}} London {{willing to}} marry Tannakin. On {{the day of the}} wedding, and despite all efforts to improve her appearance, her face was as pig-like as ever. With the wedding service concluded, the newly-wed couple retired to the bedroom. When they lay in bed {{together}} for the first time, Tannakin reached for her husband's arm, saying that she would release him from his vows provided that he would look at her in the face. <b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at her, and saw [...] "a sweet young Lady of incomparable beauty and feature, the like to whom to his imagination he never had in his whole life time beheld". He reached to kiss her, but she refused, saying: ...|$|E
60|$|This time <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at her. The old dagger {{was drawn}} in her.|$|E
60|$|Receiver to ear, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at Paula. Graham, {{bending over}} her but not {{touching}} her, met his eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... (2) [...] Thus far {{escaped from}} death or chain [...] Ah! {{wherefore}} did <b>he</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>look?</b> [...] For her his eye must seek in vain, [...] Since fatal was the gaze he took. [...] Sad proof, etc.-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... (3) [...] Ah! {{wherefore}} did <b>he</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> [...] So far {{escaped from}} death or chain? [...] Since fatal was the gaze he took [...] For her his eye but sought in vain, [...] Sad proof, etc.-- ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> {{for some}} {{explanation}} from the walls. She gets a peep at him at last. Oh, what a grandly set-up man! Oh, the stride of him. Oh, the noble rage of him. Oh, Samson {{had been like}} this before that woman took him in hand.|$|R
60|$|Billy couldn't {{think of}} {{anything}} to say. <b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> up and down the canyon in search of the enemy.|$|E
60|$|But when Boabdil was {{crossing}} the mountains <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> {{at the city}} he had lost, and burst into tears.|$|E
60|$|Bub gave a gasp. He came {{up beside}} her {{and stared at the}} money. Then <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at Sarah Judd.|$|E
50|$|Sir Anthony, Donald, Freyja, Captain Brieux and Oomiak, {{are allowed}} to depart in peace, {{promising}} not to tell the Outside World about Astragard. As Ivarsson heads back <b>to</b> Astragard, <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> back {{just in time to}} see his four friends move further and further away until they vanish into the Arctic mist.|$|R
60|$|At {{first the}} Indian pretended not <b>to</b> hear, then <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> back <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at them, but without {{stopping}} his pony.|$|R
60|$|Before <b>he</b> could <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>look,</b> {{the cutter}} {{seemed to be}} blown up by a bomb. He rose {{in the air like}} a vaulter, and when he fell the light went out.|$|R
6000|$|... "So 'tis, with 'Flucker, the baddish boy,' in tow, {{as large}} as life," [...] added another, with a {{pleasant}} laugh as <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look.</b>|$|E
60|$|The {{little one}} was Joe, and {{directly}} Wright {{spoke to him}} <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at me, and his thin mouth slanted down as he looked. Brick eyed me, too, and I {{saw that he was}} heavy, not a hard-riding cowboy.|$|E
60|$|At {{the doorway}} <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> back at her, {{standing}} {{in all her}} sweet stateliness in the twilight duskness, and the keen realization of all he had lost made him bow {{his head with a}} quick pang of regret.|$|E
5|$|Laura {{takes an}} {{overdose}} of sleeping pills. Dying, she begs to be with Simón again and the children's spirits appear, with Simón among them. Simón tells Laura that his wish was for her to stay {{and take care of}} the orphans, she then happily tells them a story. Sometime later, Carlos visits a memorial to Laura, Simón and the orphans. Carlos returns to the orphans' old bedroom and finds a medallion that he had given <b>to</b> Laura. <b>He</b> <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> as the door opens, and he smiles.|$|R
50|$|Like the London self-portrait, the {{painting}} is dominated by black and dark brown hues, with red overtones. De Leeuw {{is presented as a}} serious young man with a rather intense gaze. He is wearing a black chaperon and black fur lined jacket. <b>He</b> <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at the viewer while holding a gold ring band with a red jewel, a symbol of his profession, although some have suggested that it might indicate a recent marriage engagement, or even, given his direct gaze, that the painted is meant for his intended.|$|R
60|$|Satisfying {{himself that}} no bones were broken, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> {{abruptly}} <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for his companion, whose motionless legs {{sticking out of}} the drift were the only visible portions of his body.|$|R
6000|$|... "'A Daniel come to judgment' indeed," [...] {{reflected}} Hadden, who {{had been}} watching this savage comedy with interest; [...] "our love-sick friend has got more than he bargained for. Well, that comes of appealing to Cæsar," [...] and <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at the two suppliants.|$|E
6000|$|... "She is gone home," [...] said Deronda, coldly, as if {{he wished}} to say no more. But then, from a fresh impulse, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> {{markedly}} at Grandcourt, and added, [...] "But it is possible you know her. Her home is not far from Diplow: Offendene, near Winchester." ...|$|E
60|$|Then <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> back up {{the road}} in the {{direction}} from which his pursuers were coming. They were not in sight--they had not seen his ruse. The water in the river was of sufficient depth to completely cover the car--no sign of it appeared above the surface.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, do less!" [...] said Hilary, with imperfectly {{sustained}} passion. <b>He</b> <b>turned,</b> <b>to</b> avoid <b>looking</b> at Louise, and {{his eyes}} fell on a strange-looking note-book on the table where Maxwell had sat. [...] "What's this?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> the window, <b>looked</b> at his nails, and {{appeared}} to be suddenly reminded of duties elsewhere....|$|R
50|$|The Fog Warning is a {{painting}} with a narrative, though its tale is disturbing rather than charming. As {{indicated by the}} halibut in his dory, the fisherman in this picture has been successful. But the hardest task of the day, the return to the main ship, is still ahead of him. <b>He</b> <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at the horizon, measuring {{the distance to the}} mother ship, and to safety. The seas are choppy and the dory rocks high on the waves, making it clear that the journey home will require considerable physical effort. But more threatening is the approaching fog bank, whose streamers echo, even mock, the fisherman's profile.|$|R
60|$|Even now Blood had no {{eyes for}} that. <b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at Miss Bishop, marvelling a little, after {{the manner in}} which {{yesterday}} she had avoided him, that she should now venture upon the quarter-deck. Her presence at this moment, and considering the nature of his altercation with Wolverstone, was embarrassing.|$|E
60|$|As {{he came in}} out of {{the barn}} on this spring day, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> up at the roof with a curse. Something had angered him. He did not stop to comb his hair after washing at the pump, but came into the neat kitchen and surlily took a seat at the table.|$|E
6000|$|Mary Louise {{followed}} {{him through the}} outer office and into a smaller room beyond, the door of which Mr. Conant carefully closed after them. Then <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> steadily at the girl, who thought {{he did not seem}} especially delighted at her appearance in Dorfield. Indeed, his first words proved this, for he asked sternly: ...|$|E
5|$|Azar and {{a healer}} provide {{alternative}} treatment for Waterston, who fully recovers. He announces {{that he still}} wants a relationship with Scully, but she realizes {{she is no longer}} the same person she was those many years ago and rejects him. As she sits outside the hospital on a bench, Scully thinks that she sees the mysterious woman again, but it <b>turns</b> out <b>to</b> be Mulder. Later, the two agents sit in Mulder's apartment talking about {{the events of the last}} few days. Mulder begins to speak more existentially about what transpired, implying that fate has brought them together but, when <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at Scully, <b>he</b> sees that she has fallen asleep.|$|R
60|$|For {{a moment}} Edward did not answer. Then <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> rather lazily <b>to</b> <b>look</b> {{at his friend}} and smiled.|$|R
60|$|Edgar {{laughed as}} he shook the {{man by the}} hand, and as <b>he</b> rode off <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at the scene around him.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Aha!' said Sir Christopher, as <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at Caterina, 'what do {{you think}} of this, Maynard? Did you ever see Tina look so pretty before? Why, that little grey gown has been made out of a bit of my lady's, hasn't it? It doesn't take {{anything}} much larger than a pocket-handkerchief to dress the little monkey.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Laugh, ye satyr!” growled the major, {{wiping the}} tears from his own eyes. “It’s lucky you have no hair nor whiskers—any more than an egg—or you’d be writhing in agony before now.” <b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> wonderingly at the crowing baby in Mildred’s arms. “It’s a female Sandow!” he averred. “The grip of her hands is {{something}} marvelous!” ...|$|E
6000|$|... (1) {Ah! {{wherefore}} did he {{turn to look}} [...] {I {{know not}} why <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> [...] Since fatal was the gaze he took? [...] So far escaped from death or chain, [...] To search for her and search in vain: [...] Sad proof in peril and in pain [...] How late will Lover's hope remain.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{a splendid}} view, Dick," [...] Jack Archer said; [...] "but," [...] <b>he</b> added, <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at the fleet of {{transports}} again, [...] "I shouldn't {{like to be}} on board one of those ships if it came on to blow. It must be a rocky bottom and no holding-ground." ...|$|R
60|$|Coming {{out on the}} {{shoulder}} of the mountain just above the woods, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> round <b>to</b> <b>look</b> back. It was a splendid panorama of tropical vegetation, rounded knolls, picturesque mounds, green patches, and rugged cliffs, extending downwards to Bounty Bay with its fringe of surf, and beyond--all round--the sleeping sea.|$|R
50|$|In {{the third}} movement, Orpheus {{arrives at the}} gates of the Underworld, singing a song so {{powerful}} it makes the Stones weep. The Lord of the Underworld tells him that he may take Eurydice back, but only if <b>he</b> does not <b>turn</b> around <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at her. Eurydice is then faced with the decision to either stay with her father or go back with her husband. At her father's insistence, she follows Orpheus. But as she catches up to him, she calls out his name, and <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at her, causing her to die a second death. Meanwhile, her father has decided that he wants to forget everything, and dips himself in the river again. When Eurydice returns, her father is lying silent on the ground, having lost all of his language and memory forever.|$|R
