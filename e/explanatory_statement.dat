Direct review {{means that the}} Supreme Court hears cases directly upon appeal without the case first going to the Court of Appeals. Other direct review items include state agency decisions such as the placement of prisons, placement of energy production facilities, locations of sites for solid waste disposal, and some labor law injunctions. Additionally, the court has original jurisdiction in, writs of mandamus, writs quo warranto, writs of habeas corpus, reapportionment of state legislative districts, and challenges to ballot measures such as their titles, the fiscal impact statement, and the <b>explanatory</b> <b>statement</b> as listed in the Voter’s Pamphlet.|$|E
500|$|Judges are {{required}} to interpret laws {{in the light of}} section 9A(1) of the Interpretation Act, which requires an interpretation that would [...] "promote the purpose or object" [...] underlying written law is to be [...] "preferred" [...] over an interpretation that would not, thus mandating a purposive interpretation. The Interpretation Act provides for the types of extrinsic materials and the circumstances under which such extrinsic materials can be referred to, to aid judges in determining the purpose of the statute. Thus, when determining the purpose of a statutory provision, a judge can refer to relevant extrinsic materials such as the <b>explanatory</b> <b>statement</b> relating to the bill in which the provision appears and the speech made in Parliament by a minister moving a motion for the second reading of the bill, when circumstances call for it.|$|E
500|$|Knox and Linderman {{were both}} {{personally}} familiar with mining {{conditions in the}} Far West. They knew {{that the amount of}} bullion produced was only going to increase, and would likely drop the price of silver below the level ($1.2929 per troy ounce) at which the metal in a silver dollar was worth more as bullion than as money. In his <b>explanatory</b> <b>statement</b> accompanying his draft bill, Knox explained the discontinuance of the silver dollar would mean the United States was no longer a bimetallic nation. Boutwell, in his 1872 annual report, urged Congress to end the coinage of silver from private deposits, lest the government take a loss from paying out gold in exchange for the silver dollars, and ultimately having to melt them when they could not be circulated. According to Nugent, [...] "Were Knox, Linderman, Boutwell, Sherman, and others aware of what they were doing when they planned to drop the silver dollar? [...] It is inconceivable that they were not; Knox's statement was explicit. But did they urge it because they feared a drop in silver prices? [...] No one made an explicit statement to that effect, but it was undoubtedly the case." ...|$|E

40|$|Executive Summary Explanatory Memoranda now {{accompany}} every government Bill {{introduced into}} the Parliament, but this {{has not always been}} the case. From 1901 to 1982, there was no easy way of knowing if an Explanatory Memorandum had been produced for a particular Bill. An online Index to Explanatory Memoranda (the Index), produced by the Parliamentary Library, now makes it possible for legislators and researchers to know if a Memorandum was produced. In {{the first half of the}} 20 th century, Memoranda more commonly took the form of Comparative Memoranda, that is, documents that set out the text of a principal Act as it would appear if the current Bill was passed and identified the additions or deletions made by the Bill to that Act. From the 1950 s, Explanatory Memoranda in the modern sense have been more common. These are documents that assist members of Parliament, officials and the public to understand the objectives and detailed operation of the clauses of a Bill. <b>Explanatory</b> <b>Statements</b> are similar to Explanatory Memoranda, but the term is used for documents that explain the purpose of Commonwealth Regulations rather than Bills. These have been supplied by government departments to the Senate Regulations and Ordinances Committee since 1932.

40|$|As rumors {{travel from}} person to person, {{information}} is lost during the transmissions. Discussion, however, increases retention of the original account and organizes later transmissions. This organization then decreases the attentional load of the listeners, thus allowing them to attend to and retain a more complex message. Further, the information that is lost tends to be <b>explanatory</b> <b>statements</b> (instead of event <b>statements).</b> Such <b>explanatory</b> <b>statements</b> make ratings of a negative event more neutral, but are lost when the listener 2 ̆ 7 s attentional load is increased, and the central (event-based) message {{is more likely to}} be retained. With this in mind, the effects of discussion among eyewitnesses and subsequent listeners (non-eyewitnesses) were examined. Participants were exposed to the negative events of an actor 2 ̆ 7 s drunken night mitigated by such things as he did not know he was drunk. Half the participants discussed, the other half did not. All participants made audio recordings of their versions of the story and rated the actor. A second-generation then got those recordings and followed the same procedure. Discussion increased accuracy of individual reports (except in the second-generation following first-generation discussion). Nevertheless, this advantage was dampened by looking at the full amount of information transmitted by a pair (their pooled accuracy) which showed no difference between discussers and non-discussers. This reduces validity of arguments both for and against eyewitnesses discussing with each other; it does not seem to affect the amount of information available to, or used by, the jury. Ordering of subsequent transmissions was always highly similar to the original and accounted for a significant portion of the central-peripheral bias...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a comparison between}} the beam and shell theory for the application on wing box mass estimation in preliminary aircraft wing design.

In addition the differences in local and integral values of the x-normal, y-normal, xy-shear and von Mises stress are analyzed. Afterwards, certain geometries are selected and a realistic aerodynamic load is applied. For those wings a sizing of the skin and spar thickness is performed using both, the beam and shell theory. The sizing is performed with constant aerodynamic loads as well as with aeroelastic loads. Finally, <b>explanatory</b> <b>statements</b> for the differences in mass estimation and for different aeroelastic behaviour between both theories are discussed...|$|R
