50|$|During World War II, German {{aircraft}} commonly fitted a {{more advanced}} version that pushed back flush against the wing by air pressure to reduce drag, popping out when the angle of attack increased during slower flight. Notable slats of that time belonged to the German Fieseler Fi 156 Storch. These were similar in design to retractable slats, but were <b>fixed</b> non-retractable <b>slots.</b> The slotted wing allowed this aircraft to take off into a light wind in less than 45 m (150 ft), and land in 18 m (60 ft). Aircraft designed by the Messerschmitt company employed automatic, spring-loaded leading-edge slats as a general rule, except for the Alexander Lippisch-designed Messerschmitt Me 163B Komet rocket fighter, which used <b>fixed</b> <b>slots</b> built integrally with, and just behind the wing panel's outer leading edges instead.|$|R

From 5 January 1974 the programme moved to a Sunday afternoon slot and renamed Glen Michael's Cartoon Cavalcade. For a period between September 1985 - April 1986 the series went out on a Saturday morning at 11.15, before return to Sunday afternoon.

50|$|Partial-span slots {{are usually}} found {{only on the}} {{outboard}} portion of the wing where they ensure airflow over {{that portion of the}} wing will remain unstalled at higher angles of attack than the inboard portions of the wing. This ensures the wing root stalls first and contributes to docile stall behaviour and maintaining aileron control throughout the stall. Using slots in this manner produces a similar result to employing washout on a wing, but through a different means. Examples of aircraft with partial-span, <b>fixed</b> <b>slots</b> are the Stinson 108, Bristol Beaufort, Lockheed Hudson, and Dornier Do 28D-2 Skyservant.|$|R

40|$|Most demand {{assignment}} {{time division}} multiple access (TDMA) satellite access protocols use centralizedcontrol access schemes, rather than distributed ones, because their simplicity and robustness usually compensates for the longer allocation delay.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{introduces}} the Discrete Dithered Desyn-chronization (D 3 SYNC) algorithm {{which is a}} decentralized Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) technique in which a set of network nodes computes iteratively a conflict-free schedule so that each node obtains {{a portion of a}} frame that is an integer multiple of a <b>fixed</b> <b>slot</b> size. The algorithm is inspired by the dynamics of Pulse Coupled Oscillators (PCO), but unlike its predecessors that divide arbitrarily the frame among the nodes in the network, the D 3 SYNC allocates discrete resources among the network nodes.
