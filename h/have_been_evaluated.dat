5|$|The {{plan for}} the {{extension}} to Camberwell was kept alive throughout the 1930s and, in 1940, the permission was used to construct sidings beyond Elephant & Castle. After the Second World War, the plans were revised again, with stations located under Walworth Road and Camberwell Green, and the extension appeared on tube maps in 1949. Rising construction costs caused by difficult ground conditions and restricted funds in the post-war austerity period led the scheme to be cancelled again in 1950. Various proposals <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>evaluated</b> since, including an extension to Peckham considered in the early 1970s, but the costs have always out-weighed the benefits.|$|E

25|$|Once policy {{alternatives}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>evaluated,</b> {{the next}} step is to decide which policy alternative should be implemented. This is shown as step 5 in Figure 1. At one extreme, comparing the policy alternatives can be relatively simple if all the policy goals can be measured using a single metric and given equal weighting. In this case, the decision method is an exercise in benefit cost analysis (BCA).|$|E

In the United States, no barrier methods for use during oral sex <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>evaluated</b> as effective by the Food and Drug Administration. However, a barrier protection like a condom for fellatio or dental dam for cunnilingus can offer some protection from contact when practicing oral sex.|$|E
25|$|The Cochrane review {{suggests}} cannabinoids {{be reserved}} for people with symptoms that are not controllable by other means, who <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>evaluated</b> by EEG-video monitoring to confirm diagnosis, and {{are not eligible for}} better established treatments such as surgery and neurostimulation. A second review described four placebo-controlled trials of cannabadiol including 48 people with a disease that was not manageable by other means. Three out of four trials reported some reduction in seizures, but no comparison with placebo was possible due to the small {{number of people in the}} trials. The drugs were well tolerated. A third review found that no reliable conclusions about the effect of cannabis on epilepsy could be drawn due to the poor quality of available data, but further research may be warranted because of the good safety profile observed in small clinical trials.|$|E

2500|$|The {{greatest}} {{successes in}} chiral modification of metal surfaces {{have come from}} the use of cinchona alkaloids, though numerous other classes of natural products <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>evaluated.</b> [...] These alkaloids have been shown to enhance the rate of substrate hydrogenation by 10–100 times, such that less than one molecule of cinchona alkaloid is needed for every reactive site on the metal and, in fact, the presence of too much of the chiral modifier can cause a decrease in the enantioselectivity of the reaction.|$|E
2500|$|A tapir ( [...] , [...] , or [...] ) is a large, herbivorous mammal, {{similar in}} shape to a pig, with a short, prehensile nose trunk. Tapirs inhabit jungle and forest regions of South America, Central America, and Southeastern Asia. The five extant species of tapirs are the Brazilian tapir, the Malayan tapir, the Baird's tapir, the kabomani tapir, and the {{mountain}} tapir. The four species that <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>evaluated</b> (the Brazilian, Malayan, Baird's and mountain tapir) are all classified as endangered or vulnerable.
