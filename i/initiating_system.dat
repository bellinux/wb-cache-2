5000|$|Ternary Initiators: A ternary {{initiator}} is {{the combination}} of several types of initiators into one <b>initiating</b> <b>system.</b> The types of initiators are chosen based on the properties they are known to induce in the polymers they produce. For example, poly(methyl methacrylate) has been synthesized by the ternary system benzoyl peroxide-3,6-bis(o-carboxybenzoyl)-N-isopropylcarbazole-di-η5-indenylzicronium dichloride (Figure 7). [...] This type of <b>initiating</b> <b>system</b> contains a metallocene, an initiator, and a heteroaromatic diketo carboxylic acid. Metallocenes in combination with initiators accelerate polymerization of poly(methyl methacrylate) and produce a polymer with a narrower molecular weight distribution. The example shown here consists of indenylzirconium (a metallocene) and benzoyl peroxide (an initiator). Also, initiating systems containing heteroaromatic diketo carboxylic acids, such as 3,6-bis(o-carboxybenzoyl)-N-isopropylcarbazole in this example, are known to catalyze the decomposition of benzoyl peroxide. Initiating systems with this particular heteroaromatic diket carboxylic acid are also known to have effects on the microstructure of the polymer. The combination {{of all of these}} components—a metallocene, an initiator, and a heteroaromatic diketo carboxylic acid—yields a ternary <b>initiating</b> <b>system</b> that was shown to accelerate the polymerization and produce polymers with enhanced heat resistance and regular microstructure.|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} to frequency, voltage varies widely throughout electric systems, {{because it is}} the voltage difference between two devices that largely determines the direction and magnitude of the current (hence the power) that flows between them. Therefore voltage is a more local phenomenon, and grid-friendly devices that respond to voltage will support more local aspects of the electric delivery system. However, load types such as thermally protected induction motors and power electronics can respond poorly to significant voltage changes. When a sufficient fraction of the power demand in a region is composed of such loads, their collective response can lead to fault-induced delayed voltage recovery behavior, which may have adverse effects on transmission system reliability and may require mitigation to avoid <b>initiating</b> <b>system</b> outages.|$|E
