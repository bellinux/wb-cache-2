Such visualization is achieved by tools that {{vary depending on the}} underlying data or the task at hand. While some tools <b>distort,</b> <b>filter</b> or enhance the explored information little or no work has focused on the separation of style definitions and their mapping to scene objects. We target this separation based on a context rich scenegraph. Our research allows the definition of visualization tools independent on the data to be visualized or the application that will use them. We show how contextual information may add another hierarchical dimension to scene objects, and how this may in turn be used by hierarchical style definitions –not unlike those of Cascading Stylesheets. We compare differences with previous work, we show a complex application example and we discuss the contribution of our work to AR. are applied should be separate concerns, which can be designed and maintained independently. The application code should only control the mapping of styles to objects fitting a particular characterization, without having to touch the objects directly. In this way, a data driven application becomes feasible which allows content, styles and behavior to be varied independently in order to address a wide range of possible applications using the same AR system. This separation relies on two simple techniques: Index Terms—Augmented reality, information filtering, layout technique...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} an {{algorithm}} for identifying a parametrically described destructive unknown {{system based on}} a non-gaussianity measure. It is known that under certain conditions the output of a linear system is more gaussian than the input. Hence, an inverse filter is searched, such that its output is minimally gaussian. We use the kurtosis {{as a measure of}} the non-gaussianity of the signal. A maximum of the kurtosis {{as a function of the}} deconvolving filter coefficients is searched. The search is done iteratively using the gradient ascent algorithm, and the coefficients at the maximum point correspond to the inverse filter coefficients. This filter may be applied to the distorted signal to obtain the original undistorted signal. While a similar approach has been used before, it was always directed at a particular kind of a signal, commonly of impulsive characteristics. In this paper a successful attempt has been made to apply the algorithm to a wider range of signals, such as to process distorted audio signals and destructed images. This innovative implementation required the revelation of a way to preprocess the distorted signal at hand.

40|$|AbstractThe single-channel {{conductance}} varies significantly {{between different}} {{members of the}} inward rectifier (Kir) family of potassium channels. Mutations at three sites in Kir 6. 2 {{have been shown to}} produce channels with reduced single-channel conductance, the largest reduction (to 40 % of wild-type) being for V 127 T. We have used homology modeling (based on a KcsA template) combined with molecular dynamics simulations in a phosphatidycholine bilayer to explore whether changes in structural dynamics of the filter were induced by three such mutations: V 127 T, M 137 C, and G 135 F. Overall, 12 simulations of Kir 6. 2 models, corresponding to a total simulation time of 27 ns, have been performed. In these simulations we focused on distortions of the selectivity filter, and on the presence/absence of water molecules lying behind the filter, which form interactions with the filter and the remainder of the protein. Relative to the wild-type simulation, the V 127 T mutant showed significant distortion of the filter such that ∼ 50 % of the simulation time was spent in a closed conformation. While in this conformation, translocation of K+ ions between sites S 1 and S 2 was blocked.

Photographs of celebrities in the magazines have been shot and styled as commodities for mass consumption. It is this <b>distorting</b> <b>filter</b> that Aline Giordano choses to disregard in her own photographic style. Indeed, she does not see the ‘celebrity skin’ rather she is interested in the individual and artist beneath it. Aline Giordano is a fanzine photographer and has been shooting and publishing photographs for her music fanzine since the beginning of the 1990 s. She shoots the ordinariness that surrounds her at concerts, and has a special interest in shooting those artists on the ‘fringes’. The result of being drawn towards the fringes and photographing them comes to life in her ‘half-lit realism’ photography. ‘It’s dark but then it’s rarely shiny and cosy at the fringes’, she admits. Through her photographs and written contextualisation Aline Giordano argues that fanzine photography contributes to the re-writing of popular music history by providing complementing visual data taken with different, amateur and sometimes anti-expert production methods in line with the fanzine ethos. The exhibition explores the roles and functions of fanzine photographs in the critical discourse of popular music and how they convey different meanings to the mainstream stories. Aline Giordano personally met and interviewed most of the subjects she has photographed. By contextualising her photographs with her personal experiences she produces a naturally authentic piece that places itself as the embodiment of what Professor Chris Atton, leading expert in fanzine culture, describes as ‘the anti-intellectualism of much fanzine writing’. Her account of her encounter with Courtney Love, the late Vic Chesnutt and Mark Linkous is truly moving.

When smoothing scatterplots the Whittaker smoother is a valuable tool that produces enhanced images that are not distorted by the large number of points.

40|$|Gas-path {{measurements}} used {{to assess}} the health condition of an engine are corrupted by noise. Generally, a data cleaning step occurs before proceeding with fault detection and isolation. Classical linear filters such as the EWMA filter are traditionally used for noise removal. Unfortunately, these low-pass <b>filters</b> <b>distort</b> trend shifts indicative of faults, which increases the detection delay. The present paper investigates two new approaches to nonlinear filtering of time series. On the one hand, the synthesis approach reconstructs the signal as a combination of elementary signals chosen from a predefined library. On the other hand, the analysis approach imposes a constraint on the shape of the signal (e. g., piecewise constant). Both approaches incorporate prior information about the signal in a different way, but they lead to trend filters that are very capable at noise removal while preserving at the same time sharp edges in the signal. This is highlighted through the comparison with a classical linear filter on a batch of synthetic data representative of typical engine fault profiles. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Synthetic {{aperture}} radar (SAR) {{images are}} subject to prominent speckle noise, which is generally considered a purely multiplicative noise process. One interesting property of this multiplicative noise is that {{the ratio of the}} standard deviation to the signal value, the "coefficient of variation," is theoretically constant at every point in a SAR image. We use this property in conjunction with a new nonlinear filter structure based on mathematical morphology, the value-and-criterion structure, to design a filter that removes speckle noise from SAR images without blurring edges. First, the sample coefficient of variation at each point in the image is computed. In areas where there are changes in the signal, the sample coefficient of variation will be greater than the expected theoretical value. By using the new filter structure, a low-pass filter to remove speckle noise can be directed to operate only over regions where the coefficient of variation is close to the expected value. These regions are less likely to contain significant features or edges which would be <b>distorted</b> by low-pass <b>filtering.</b> We demonstrate the effectiveness of this new filtering method by comparing it to established speckle noise removal techniques on both phantom images with simulated speckle noise and real SAR images...|$|R

40|$|Lithification with related diagenetic {{phenomena}} is {{an important}} step in a complex transition from living communities to fossil assemblages and a major taphonomic <b>filter</b> <b>distorting</b> the record of past biodiversity. Apart from direct diagenetic culling of fossils, cementation of fossiliferous deposits induces changes in sampling procedures used to extract paleontological data. This study explores the effects of this methodological shift on recorded fine-scale paleoecological patterns by using subfossil mollusk assemblages occurring in the unlithified and recently cemented storm-beach carbonate sands at Sand Dollar Beach, San Salvador Island, Bahamas, which experienced limited diagenetic alteration. Results show that consistent differences in relative abundance patterns of particular taxa can be observed between unlithified and lithified samples due to collection failure. Magnitude of this distortion is controlled in a large part by a degree of transport-related size sorting, with well-sorted assemblages dominated by small gastropods being more affected. This bias, however, is of limited importance and can be mitigated by selective exclusion of the smallest size classes (, 5 mm) from the analysis. Moreover, unlithified and poorly lithified deposits record very similar rarefied richness estimates and patterns of diversity partitioning. This contrasts strongly with earlier estimates of lithification-related diversity loss, suggesting greater impor-tance of diagenetic over methodological filters in creating lithification bias observed in the older rock record. Poorly lithified carbonate rocks—present in many late Neogene successions—may yield biodiversity data directly comparable to those recorded by unlithified sediments if careful collecting methods based on bulk samples are employed...|$|R

We conclude, based on color, positional, and statistical data, that the most likely mechanism for the creation of these structures is through an interaction with the gravitational potential of the cluster, possibly coupled with effects of high speed interactions with large cluster ellipticals.

40|$|Goal: This study {{tests and}} validates a new method to remove power line {{interference}} from monopolar EMGs detected by multichannel systems: the filtered virtual reference (FVR). FVR is {{an adaptation of}} the virtual reference (VR) method, which consists in referencing signals detected by each electrode in a grid to their spatial average. Signals may however be distorted with the VR approach, in particular when the skin region where the detection system is positioned does not cover the entire muscle. Methods: Simulated and experimental EMGs were {{used to compare the}} performance of FVR and VR in terms of interference reduction and distortion of monopolar signals referred to a remote reference. Results: Simulated data revealed the monopolar EMG signals processed with FVR were significantly less <b>distorted</b> than those <b>filtered</b> by VR. These results were similarly observed for experimental signals. Moreover, FVR method outperformed VR in removing power line interference when it was distributed unevenly across the signals of the grid. Conclusion: Key results demonstrated that FVR improves the VR method as it reduces interference while preserving the information content of monopolar signals. Significance: Although the actual distribution of motor unit action potential is represented in monopolar EMGs, collecting high quality monopolar signals is challenging. This study presents a possible solution to this issue; FVR provides undistorted monopolar signals with negligible interference and is insensitive to muscle architecture. It is therefore relevant for EMG applications benefiting from a clean monopolar detection (e. g., decomposition, control of prosthetic devices, motor unit number estimation...|$|R
