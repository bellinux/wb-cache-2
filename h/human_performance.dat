40|$|This is {{a working}} paper. This paper investigates the geo-political and {{international}} economic aspects of <b>human</b> rights <b>performance</b> using a pooled cross-section time-series data set. We start with simple descriptive {{accounts of the}} recent geographic history of <b>human</b> rights <b>performance.</b> We then test for basic economic effects of income and then apply tools from the spatial economics literature to examine {{the degree to which}} clusters of relative <b>human</b> rights <b>performance</b> exist. Using spatial weighting models we analyse the spatial impact of proximity and <b>human</b> rights <b>performance</b> of neghbours on overall levels of <b>human</b> rights <b>performance.</b> Unlike previous studies, our approach treats this spatial impact as partly endogenous: one country’s <b>human</b> rights <b>performance</b> may affect its neighbours through a variety of potential geographical spillover mechanisms. The spatial weighting models take into account size and distance of neighbours in order to compare each country’s <b>human</b> rights <b>performance</b> with what would be predicted by regression on a weighted average of its neighbours’ performance. The findings sugest that there are (a) geographical clusters of <b>human</b> rights <b>performance</b> and (b) size and proximity effects for <b>human</b> rights <b>performance,</b> both of which have significant implications for the promotion and protection of human rights...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the main}} {{problems}} with the automatic generation of expressive musical <b>performances</b> is that <b>human</b> performers use musical knowledge that is not explicitly noted in musical scores. Moreover, this knowledge is tacit, difficult to verbalize, and therefore it must be acquired {{through a process of}} observation, imitation, and experimentation. For this reason, AI approaches based on declarative knowledge representations have serious limitations. An alternative approach is that of directly using the knowledge implicit in examples from recordings of <b>human</b> <b>performances.</b> In this paper, we describe a case-based reasoning system that generates expressive musical performances based on examples of expressive <b>human</b> <b>performances.</b> 1 Introduction One of the major difficulties in the automatic generation of music is to endow the resulting piece with the expressivity that characterizes <b>human</b> <b>performances.</b> Following musical rules, whatever sophisticated and complete they are, is not enough to a [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Improving <b>human</b> {{resources}} <b>performance</b> (HRP) is {{the most}} important task of the century. However, we have few measures or management interventions to make such improvement possible; although we cannot identify the pattern to be followed by human resources because systems and processes in an organization are often regarded as a kiss of death to encouraging creativity. For improving <b>human</b> resource <b>performance,</b> at first, HRP needs to be measured and then the future of HRP needs to be defined. Therefore, in this paper, we seek to present a hybrid method for measuring and predicting the HRP, which can be used in human resources development. A hybrid method is created through a twophase algorithm for measurement and prediction of HRP as the <b>Human</b> resources <b>performance</b> console (HRPC). HRPC calculates and predicates HRP in any period, thus it has been created to help managers. Nevertheless, the Hybrid method is tested and validated in Alupan company.

40|$|A {{great deal}} of current {{robotics}} research studies the modeling of human reaction skills: learning control mappings to represent a person's task-performance strategies. The important related problem of modeling human action skills has received less attention. Action learning is the characterization of the state space or action space explored during typical <b>human</b> <b>performances</b> of a given task. Action models learned from <b>human</b> <b>performances</b> typically represent some form of prototypical performance, and also characterize how the human's performances vary stochastically or due to external influences. They are used for gesture recognition, for realistic computer animations of human motion, for study of an expert performer's motion (e. g., Tiger Woods' golf swing), for generating feed-forward or reference robot control signals, and for evaluating the naturalness of the performances generated in real and simulated systems by reaction-skill models.

40|$|Although <b>human</b> musical <b>performances</b> {{represent}} one of {{the most}} valuable achievements of mankind, the best musicians perform imperfectly. Musical rhythms are not entirely accurate and thus inevitably deviate from the ideal beat pattern. Nevertheless, computer generated perfect beat patterns are frequently devalued by listeners due to a perceived lack of human touch. Professional audio editing software therefore offers a humanizing feature which artificially generates rhythmic fluctuations. However, the built-in humanizing units are essentially random number generators producing only simple uncorrelated fluctuations. Here, for the first time, we establish long-range fluctuations as an inevitable natural companion of both simple and complex <b>human</b> rhythmic <b>performances.</b> Moreover, we demonstrate that listeners strongly prefer long-range correlated fluctuations in musical rhythms. Thus, the favorable fluctuation type for humanizing interbeat intervals coincides with the one generically inherent in <b>human</b> musical <b>performances...</b>|$|R

Shah argues there is one imitation game which Turing described could be practicalised in two different ways: a) one-to-one interrogator-machine test, and b) simultaneous comparison of a machine with a human, both questioned in parallel by an interrogator. Since the Turing test is a test of indistinguishability in performance capacity, the verbal version generalises naturally to all of <b>human</b> <b>performance</b> capacity, verbal as well as nonverbal (robotic).|$|E
