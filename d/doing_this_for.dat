25|$|Bubble sort is {{a simple}} sorting {{algorithm}}. The algorithm starts {{at the beginning of}} the data set. It compares the first two elements, and if the first is greater than the second, it swaps them. It continues <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> <b>for</b> each pair of adjacent elements to the end of the data set. It then starts again with the first two elements, repeating until no swaps have occurred on the last pass. This algorithm's average time and worst-case performance is O(n2), so it is rarely used to sort large, unordered data sets. Bubble sort can be used to sort a small number of items (where its asymptotic inefficiency is not a high penalty). Bubble sort can also be used efficiently on a list of any length that is nearly sorted (that is, the elements are not significantly out of place). For example, if any number of elements are out of place by only one position (e.g. 0123546789 and 1032547698), bubble sort's exchange will get them in order on the first pass, the second pass will find all elements in order, so the sort will take only 2n time.|$|E

Rock band Spymob further assisted production with guitar and drums. Production revolved around heavy rock, funk and soul music, which was first introduced in their debut album, In Search Of.... Hugo described the album as going back to the band's roots, combining a classic rock sound with a 1970s funk swing. The typical process of recording was described as [...] "Williams arrives at the studio, ideas in full flower, and lays down both a beat (either programmed or played on an assortment of buckets) and vocals." [...] Hugo then would add extra instrumentation. In an interview with MTV, Williams said that the band [...] "didn't care about genres; we're not <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> <b>for</b> the money.

This happened to us and Layne’s family, not them. This is actually our lives. If we’re okay with it, why can’t you be? This happened to us, this didn’t happen to you. But this album isn’t about that, it’s a bigger universal point. We’re all going to fucking die, we’re all going to lose somebody, and it fucking hurts. How do you move on? This record is us moving on, and hurting. That, to me, is a victory. I already feel like I’ve won." [...] "Sometimes people ask us, ‘Wouldn’t Layne have been pissed off that we did this?’ And I tell them {{it would have been the}} opposite: he would have been pissed off that it took us so long to do this. We’re not <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> <b>for</b> money; there is no money in the music business anymore. Jerry and I funded the whole album, and we spent lots of our own money, because we believe in this.

[...] And Cantrell added: [...] "We’ve toured around the world, we’ve lost some friends, we buried a dear friend, and somebody that you just can’t fucking replace, and then we’ve chosen by circumstance to get together again.
