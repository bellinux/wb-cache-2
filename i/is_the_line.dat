5|$|In the 1940s and 1950s, several {{companies}} started a competing bus service. There were accusations that the route was cross-subsidized and that price dumping was occurring {{along the route}} from Sandnes to Ålgård. In the early 1950s, discussion started about closing the line, and on 1 November 1955, all passenger transport was terminated, after a decision in parliament on 26 May 1955. This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> with the most frequent passenger traffic in Norway to have been closed.|$|E
5|$|The {{electric}} field was formally {{defined as the}} force exerted per unit charge, but the concept of potential allows for a more useful and equivalent definition: the {{electric field}} is the local gradient of the electric potential. Usually expressed in voltspermetre, the vector direction of the field <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> of greatest slope of potential, and where the equipotentials lie closest together.|$|E
5|$|Europa orbits Jupiter in {{just over}} {{three and a half}} days, with an orbital radius of about 670,900km. With an {{eccentricity}} of only 0.009, the orbit itself is nearly circular, and the orbital inclination relative to Jupiter's equatorial plane is small, at 0.470°. Like its fellow Galilean satellites, Europa is tidally locked to Jupiter, with one hemisphere of Europa constantly facing Jupiter. Because of this, there is a sub-Jovian point on Europa's surface, from which Jupiter would appear to hang directly overhead. Europa's prime meridian <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> intersecting this point. Research suggests that the tidal locking may not be full, as a non-synchronous rotation has been proposed: Europa spins faster than it orbits, or at least did so in the past. This suggests an asymmetry in internal mass distribution and that a layer of subsurface liquid separates the icy crust from the rocky interior.|$|E

5|$|From the 8th century AD onward, astronomers {{developed}} {{methods for}} approximating and calculating the direction to Mecca (qibla)—and its distance—from any {{location on the}} Earth. From the 9th century onward they were using spherical trigonometry and map projection methods to determine these quantities accurately. The calculation is essentially {{the conversion of the}} equatorial polar coordinates of Mecca (i.e. its longitude and latitude) to its polar coordinates (i.e. its qibla and distance) relative to a system whose reference meridian is the great circle through the given location and the Earth's poles, and whose polar axis <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> through the location and its antipodal point.|$|E
