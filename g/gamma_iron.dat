50|$|A primary {{requirement}} for forge welding {{is that both}} weld surfaces need to be heated to the same temperature and welded before they cool too much. When steel reaches the proper temperature, it begins to weld very readily, so a thin rod or nail heated to the same temperature will tend to stick at first contact, requiring it to be bent or twisted loose. One of the simplest ways to tell if iron or steel is hot enough is to stick a magnet to it. When iron or steel cross the A2 critical temperature, it begins to change into the allotrope called <b>gamma</b> <b>iron.</b> When this happens, the steel or iron becomes non-magnetic. In steel, the carbon begins to mix with <b>gamma</b> <b>iron</b> at the A3 temperature, forming a solid solution called austenite. When it crosses the A4 critical temperature, it changes into delta iron, which is magnetic. Therefore, a blacksmith can tell when the welding temperature is reached by placing a magnet {{in contact with the}} metal. When red or orange-hot, a magnet will not stick to the metal, but when the welding temperature is crossed, the magnet will again stick to it. The steel may take on a glossy or wet appearance at the welding temperature. Care must be taken to avoid overheating the metal {{to the point that it}} gives off sparks from rapid oxidation (burning), or else the weld will be poor and brittle.|$|E
50|$|Concentrations of {{polyphosphates}} or phosphonates with zinc and chromates {{or similar}} compounds have been maintained in cooling systems to keep heat exchange surfaces clean so {{a film of}} <b>gamma</b> <b>iron</b> oxide and zinc phosphate may inhibit corrosion by passivating anodic and cathodic reaction points. These increase salinity and total dissolved solids, and phosphorus compounds may provide the limiting essential nutrient for algal growth contributing to biofouling of the cooling system or to eutrophication of natural aquatic environments receiving blowdown or OTC water. Chromates reduce biofouling in addition to effective corrosion inhibition, but residual toxicity in blowdown or OTC water has encouraged reduced chromate concentrations and use of less flexible corrosion inhibitors. Blowdown may also contain chromium leached from cooling towers constructed of wood preserved with chromated copper arsenate.|$|E
50|$|The {{temperature}} {{required to}} forge weld is typically 50 to 90 {{percent of the}} melting temperature. Iron can be welded when it surpasses the critical temperature (the A4 temperature) where its allotrope changes from <b>gamma</b> <b>iron</b> (face-centered cubic) to delta iron (body-centered cubic). Since the critical temperatures are affected by alloying agents like carbon, steel welds at a lower temperature-range than iron. As the carbon content in the steel increases, the welding temperature-range decreases in a linear fashion. Iron, different steels, and even cast-iron can be welded to each other, provided that their carbon content is close enough that the welding ranges overlap. Pure iron can be welded when nearly white hot; between 2500 F and 2700 F. Steel with a carbon content of 2.0% can be welded when orangish-yellow, between 1700 F and 2000 F. Common steel, between 0.2 and 0.8% carbon, is typically welded at a bright yellow heat.|$|E

5000|$|Steel {{contains}} {{a relatively small}} percentage of carbon, which can migrate freely within the <b>gamma</b> <b>iron.</b> When austenized steel is exposed to air {{for long periods of}} time, the carbon content in the steel can be lowered. This is the opposite from what happens when steel is heated in a reducing environment, in which carbon slowly diffuses further into the metal. In an oxidizing environment, the carbon can readily diffuse outwardly, so austenized steel is very susceptible to decarburization. This is often used for cast steel, where a high carbon-content is needed for casting, but a lower carbon-content is desired in the finished product. It is often used on cast-irons to produce malleable cast iron, in a process called [...] "white tempering." [...] This tendency to decarburize is often a problem in other operations, such as blacksmithing, where it becomes more desirable to austenize the steel for the shortest amount of time possible to prevent too much decarburization.|$|E

This examination is based on the simulation of EAS at primary energies of 10 20 eV (100 EeV) beyond the GZK cut-off, using the AIRES (AIRshower Extended Simulations) program. AIRES uses a set of programs and subroutines to simulate particle showers produced after the incidence of high energy cosmic rays on the earth's atmosphere and to manage all the data associated with these simulations (Sciutto, 1999, 2001). The following simulations assume a primary high energy proton, <b>gamma</b> or <b>iron</b> entrance in the earth's atmosphere and present the longitudinal and lateral behaviour of the created EAS. Two conclusions can be drawn: 1. Gamma primary produces fewer particles, gamma rays and muons on ground than proton or iron nuclei and 2.

In the present study, we show that IFN gamma also downregulates the intracellular concentration of ferritin, the major iron storage protein in the cell. By radioimmunoassay, the mean ferritin content of nonactivated monocytes was 361 +/- 107 fg/monocyte (mean +/- SEM) whereas the mean ferritin content of IFN gamma-activated monocytes was 64 +/- 13 fg/monocyte, an 82 % reduction with activation (P < 0. 01, t test). Consistent with its downregulating effect on these <b>iron</b> proteins, IFN <b>gamma</b> treatment also results in decreased iron incorporation. IFN gamma-activated monocytes incorporated 33 % less iron from 59 Fe-transferrin than nonactivated monocytes (P < 0. 05, t test).

Ferritin in IFN gamma-activated monocytes is saturated with approximately three times as much 59 Fe as ferritin in nonactivated monocytes. We have also explored the effect of iron transferrin on transferrin receptor expression and intracellular ferritin content in human monocytes.

40|$|The mass {{composition}} of high energy cosmic rays above $ 10 ^{ 17 }$ eV {{is a crucial}} issue to solve some open questions in astrophysics such as the acceleration and propagation mechanisms. Unfortunately, the standard procedures to identify the primary particle of a cosmic ray shower have low efficiency mainly due to large fluctuations and limited experimental observables.
