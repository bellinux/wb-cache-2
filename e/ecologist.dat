5|$|Florida International University <b>ecologist</b> Suzanne Koptur {{reported}} {{the presence of}} extrafloral nectaries on F. aurea figs in the Florida Everglades. Extrafloral nectaries are structures which produce nectar but are not associated with flowers. They are usually interpreted as defensive structure and are often produced in response to attack by insect herbivores. They attract insects, primarily ants, which defend the nectaries, thus protecting the plant against herbivores.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, marine {{biologist}} and <b>ecologist</b> Rachel Carson's book Silent Spring helped {{to mobilize the}} environmental movement by alerting the public to toxic pesticides, such as DDT, bioaccumulating in the environment. Carson used ecological science to link the release of environmental toxins to human and ecosystem health. Since then, ecologists have worked to bridge {{their understanding of the}} degradation of the planet's ecosystems with environmental politics, law, restoration, and natural resources management.|$|E
5|$|Controversy over Kampoeng Rawa had {{developed}} by late 2012, when the Water Resource Management Agency {{declared that the}} site was illegally located in the green belt around Lake Rawa Pening. In 2013, the <b>ecologist</b> Sudharto of Diponegoro University stated that the area around Rawa Pening had to be clear of all buildings, otherwise the water flow and ecosystem would be disturbed. It was {{also found that the}} permits for the establishment had not been obtained. However, the Regent of Semarang, Sudharto, was supportive of Kampoeng Rawa, stating that the complex not only improved the welfare of the farmers and fishermen, but stopped feuds over the use of rice paddies in the area.|$|E

40|$|The popular {{stereotype}} of <b>ecologists</b> appears somewhat {{at odds with}} the ideal of the objective, detached, morally disinterested researcher. <b>Ecologists</b> tend to subscribe to this ideal, as do most natural scientists. This puts the stereotype into question. To what extent and in what respects can <b>ecologists</b> be regarded as motivated by environmentalist values? What other values might contribute to their motivations? The answers to those questions have bearing on how policy makers perceive the input they receive from <b>ecologists</b> and it has long-term implications for the funding of ecological research. To obtain some answers I analysed over fifty randomly selected publications of <b>ecologists</b> for explicit and implicit value statements. The analysis revealed an abundance of value statements. However, no bias was evident towards a conservationist or ecocentric environmental ethic such as suggested by the stereotype. I will suggest some explanations and ramifications of these results that take into account the <b>ecologist's</b> professional situation. Ecology, values, science, discourse, ecocentrism...|$|R
25|$|The {{perception}} of the landscape in historical ecology differs from other disciplines, such as landscape ecology. Landscape <b>ecologists</b> often attribute the depletion of biodiversity to human disturbance. Historical <b>ecologists</b> recognize {{that this is not}} always true. These changes are due to multiple factors that contribute to the ever-changing landscape. Landscape ecology still focuses on areas defined as ecosystems. In this, the ecosystem perpetually returns to a state of equilibrium. In contrast, historical <b>ecologists</b> view the landscape as perpetually changing. Landscape <b>ecologists</b> view noncyclical human events and natural disasters as external influences, while historical <b>ecologists</b> view disturbances {{as an integral part of}} the landscape's history. It is this integration of the concept of disturbance and history that allows for landscape to be viewed as palimpsests, representing successive layers of change, rather than as static entities.|$|R
5|$|In August 2011, the Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel (WGEEP) {{designated}} the entire Western Ghats as an Ecologically Sensitive Area (ESA) and assigned {{three levels of}} Ecological Sensitivity to its different regions. The Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel, headed by <b>ecologist</b> Madhav Gadgil, was a committee appointed by the Union Ministry of Environment and Forests to assess the biodiversity and environmental issues of the Western Ghats. Gadgil Committee and its successor Kasturirangan Committee recommended suggestions to protect the Western Ghats. Gadgil report was criticized as being too environment-friendly and Kasturirangan report was labelled as being anti-environmental.|$|E
5|$|Males perch after {{emerging}} from their nest. They pick out an area {{close to a}} nest with females inside and guard the territory around it so as {{to have a better}} chance of mating. They tend to perch on many different substrates such as stumps, pebbles, wood, weeds, grass blades and low tree branches. Males assume an alert posture, ready for a challenge from another male, or from a predator. One study by a behavioral <b>ecologist,</b> John Alcock, showed that a large majority of the marked wasps returned to the same perch day after day, and two males swapped between two different sites. The species rarely perches on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Old, vague {{accounts}} of several different now-extinct Mascarene parrots have created much confusion for {{the scientists who}} subsequently examined them. In 1967, American ornithologist James Greenway speculated that 17th- and 18th-century reports of then-unidentified grey parrots on Mauritius referred to the broad-billed parrot. In 1987, English <b>ecologist</b> Anthony S. Cheke correlated the L. bensoni subfossils with the grey parrots reported from Mauritius and Réunion, which had previously been ignored, or considered references to broad-billed parrots. Further study of contemporary accounts indicates that the broad-billed parrot was not grey, but had multiple colours.|$|E

40|$|Economists and <b>ecologists,</b> in general, {{have offered}} differing {{opinions}} about the seriousness of climate change {{and the need for}} rapid reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Economists have tended to urge caution, focusing on the potential for large-scale cutbacks to upset the economy. <b>Ecologists</b> have tended to focus on the potential for catastrophic losses from climate change, and have urged extensive shifts in policy. This paper uses the tools of cost benefit analysis and the decision sciences to examine why members of the two disciplines often reach different conclusions. First, economists and <b>ecologists</b> start from different perspectives about {{what is the point of}} reference against which policies should be judged.

5|$|Phil England {{writes in}} The <b>Ecologist</b> that the {{strength}} of the book is the rigour of the research and the detailed focus on key incidents. He said, however, that the climate change chapter is only 50 pages long, and recommends several other books for readers who want to get a broader picture of this aspect: Jim Hoggan’s Climate Cover-Up, George Monbiot’s Heat: How to Stop the Planet Burning and Ross Gelbspan’s The Heat is On and Boiling Point. England also said that there is little coverage about the millions of dollars which Exxon Mobil has put into funding groups actively involved in promoting climate change denial and doubt.|$|E
5|$|The {{spotted hyena}} {{is the most}} {{carnivorous}} member of the Hyaenidae. Unlike its brown and striped cousins, the spotted hyena is a predator, not a scavenger; this has been shown since the 1960s. One of the earliest studies to demonstrate their hunting abilities was done by Hans Kruuk, an African wildlife <b>ecologist,</b> and he showed through a 7-year study of hyena populations in Africa that spotted hyenas hunt as much as lions, and with later studies this {{has been shown to}} be the average in all areas of Africa. However spotted hyenas remain being mislabeled as scavengers, often even by ecologists and wildlife documentary channels.|$|E
5|$|During {{the eighteenth}} and nineteenth centuries, the mound of Cubzac was slashed all around to provide stone for Bordeaux's {{construction}} and the ballast of some river banks, creating deep excavations in the limestone. In 1898, André Cousteau, uncle of the researcher and <b>ecologist</b> Jacques Cousteau, started using the caves to make a sparkling wine based on traditional Champagne-making techniques. The wine, treated in a closed tank, bottled, and kept neck down many months at constant temperature, became bubbly and had its impurities accumulate near the cap. Once this deposit was removed, the bottles were resealed by force, and the corks muzzled. In 1920, the Cousteau property was sold to the Société Anonyme Gay-Mousse. In 1966, the caves where entrusted to Monsieur Lateyron who, one year later, created the Café de Paris.|$|E

5|$|In 1987, the British <b>ecologist</b> Anthony S. Cheke {{proposed}} that the last two types mentioned were male and female Newton's parakeets, and that the differences between them were due to sexual dimorphism. The last bird mentioned had earlier been identified as introduced grey-headed lovebirds (Agapornis canus) by A. Newton, but Cheke did not find this likely, as their beaks are grey. Alexandre Pingré also mentioned green birds, perhaps with some red colours, but his account is partially unintelligible and therefore ambiguous. A red shoulder patch is also present on the related Alexandrine parakeet. None of the existing Newton's parakeet specimens have red patches. The single known male specimen may have been immature, judged on the colour of its beak, and this may also explain {{the absence of the}} red patch. When Psittacula are bred by aviculturalists, blue is easily produced from green; the production of blue may suppress red colouration, so blue morphs may have lacked the red patch.|$|E
5|$|An {{examination}} of a hunting tradition in northern Europe follows, where falcons assist humans in hunting by catching wild game, such as rabbits and pheasants. Further collaboration with man and animal is highlighted, {{this time with}} cheetahs. To demonstrate the cheetah's speed and effectiveness, a chase between a group of cheetahs and ostriches is arranged, in which the birds are hunted down and killed. The next animal collaborators are dogs, which hunt wild boar in Patagonia and a puma which has attacked a herd of sheep and a shepherd. In cities, however, stray dogs are the ones hunted by dog catchers, which the narrator claims demonstrates that the hunt is still active, but the prey has changed. Indios also use dogs to hunt monkeys, but their efforts are compared to mercenaries hunting the Indios themselves to clear them from their native land for development. In one such instance, mercenaries retaliate against a death of a workman by hunting down a group of Indios, one of which they torture, castrate and murder. Various scenes of wildlife are then shown, after which orangutans are hunted {{to be sold to}} zoos. The film then ends with the coexistence of man and animal between Erik Zimen, an <b>ecologist,</b> and wolves, the group of animals he wishes to save.|$|E
5|$|In 1846, the Swedish {{zoologist}} Carl Jakob Sundevall {{moved the}} bluebuck and its closest relatives to the genus Hippotragus; he had originally named this genus for the roan antelope (H. equinus) in 1845. This revision was commonly accepted by other writers, {{such as the}} British zoologists Philip Sclater and Oldfield Thomas, who restricted the genus Antilope to the blackbuck (A. cervicapra) in 1899. In 1914, the name Hippotragus was submitted for conservation (so older, unused genus names could be suppressed) to the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) with the bluebuck as type species. However, the original 1845 naming of the genus with the roan antelope as single species was overlooked and later suppressed by the ICZN, leading to some taxonomic confusion. In 2001, the British <b>ecologist</b> Peter J. Grubb proposed that the ICZN should rescind its suppression of the 1845 naming and make the roan antelope the type species of Hippotragus, since too {{little is known about}} the bluebuck for it to be a reliable type species. This was accepted by the commission in 2003.|$|E

5|$|Several {{causes for}} the decline and sudden {{disappearance}} of the hoopoe starling have been proposed, all connected to the activities of humans on Réunion, who it survived alongside for two centuries. An oft-repeated suggestion is that {{the introduction of the}} common myna (Acridotheres tristis) led to competition between these two starling species. The myna was introduced to Réunion in 1759 to combat locusts, and became a pest itself. However, the hoopoe starling coexisted with the myna for nearly 100years and they may not have shared habitat. The black rat (Rattus rattus) arrived on Reunion in the 1670s, and the brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) in 1735, multiplying rapidly and threatening agriculture and native species. Like the hoopoe starling, the rats inhabited tree cavities and would have preyed on eggs, juveniles, and nesting birds. During the mid-19th century the Réunion slit-eared skink (Gongylomorphus borbonicus) became extinct due to predation by the introduced wolf snake (Lycodon aulicum), which may have deprived the bird of a significant food source. Hoopoe starlings may have contracted diseases from introduced birds, a factor known to have triggered declines and extinctions in endemic Hawaiian birds. According to <b>ecologist</b> Anthony S. Cheke, this was the chief cause of the hoopoe starling's extinction; the species had survived for generations despite other threats.|$|E
5|$|Varner's second monograph, Personhood, Ethics, and Animal Cognition: Situating Animals in the Two-Level Utilitarianism of R. M. Hare, was {{published}} in 2012 by Oxford University Press. Varner {{had been working on}} questions about R. M. Hare and animals since 2001, when he taught a graduate class exploring the subject; given that Peter Singer was a student of Hare, Varner was interested in exploring whether Hare's philosophy endorsed Singer's conclusions about animal liberation. A project entitled Harey Animals: Situating Animals in the Two-Level Utilitarianism of R. M. Hare was submitted to Oxford University Press, but this was subsequently split into two books; Personhood, Ethics, and Animal Cognition was the first, while the second, the forthcoming Sustaining Animals: Envisioning Humane, Sustainable Communities, in under contract with the publisher. While Personhood, Ethics, and Animal Cognition addresses theoretical issues in Hare's philosophy, Sustaining Animals is more practically focussed, exploring the applicability of the Harean philosophy developed in Personhood, Ethics, and Animal Cognition to real-world issues concerning human-animal relationships. Varner is also co-authoring a textbook under contract with Cambridge University Press entitled Environmental Ethics for Environmentalists with the University of Guelph <b>ecologist</b> Jonathan Newman and the Guelph philosopher Stefan Linquist.|$|E

Jesús Rodríguez Almeida took his place as Attorney General. On January 8, Mancera registered as a precandidate for Mayor of Mexico City, {{as a member of}} the PRD. On January 19, he became the official Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) candidate for Mayor of Mexico City, running against Alejandra Barrales, Gerardo Fernández Noroña, Martí Batres and Joel Ortega Cuevas, representing the leftist Progressive Movement coalition, which is formed by the PRD party, the Labor Party, and the Citizen's Movement Party. The adversaries of Mancera were Beatriz Paredes Rangel, for the Commitment to Mexico coalition, an alliance of political parties Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) and <b>Ecologist</b> Green Party of Mexico (PVEM), Isabel Miranda de Wallace for the National Action Party (PAN), and Rosario Guerra for the New Alliance Party (PANAL). According to surveys made in late January, Mancera was between 18 and 30 points ahead of Paredes. However, the following month, electoral preferences that favored him decreased by nine points. Electoral preference for Mancera then increased from 36% in March to 41% in April in an El Universal daily poll. In May, Mancera favorability increased to 57.5%; in the same month, Adolfo Hellmund, Luis Mandoki, and Costa Bonino, in the house of Luis Creel, borrowed six million dollars on behalf of Mancera and López Obrador, but both politicians disassociated themselves from the incident, and Mancera filed a complaint against the people responsible for using his name without authorization with the Attorney General of Mexico City.|$|E

30|$|Although <b>ecologists</b> {{and economists}} have often {{addressed}} similar concerns (i.e. {{how to reduce}} the impacts of invasive species), they have rarely worked together. This stems in part {{from a lack of}} understanding between the disciplines. In particular, <b>ecologists</b> may be unwilling to consider ecosystem components/qualities (e.g. biodiversity) in monetary terms. On the economist side, there is often a lack of willingness to work with ecological systems because they are so complex, in many cases are poorly understood even by <b>ecologists,</b> and because the relationships among ecosystem components may not fit into traditional economic models.|$|R
50|$|The second form of {{cultural}} ecology introduced decision theory from agricultural economics, particularly {{inspired by the}} works of Alexander Chayanov and Ester Boserup. These cultural <b>ecologists</b> were concerned with how human groups made decisions about how they use their natural environment. They were particularly concerned {{with the question of}} agricultural intensification, refining the competing models of Thomas Malthus and Boserup. Notable cultural <b>ecologists</b> in this second tradition include Harold Brookfield and Billie Lee Turner II. Starting in the 1980s, cultural ecology came under criticism from political ecology. Political <b>ecologists</b> charged that cultural ecology ignored the connections between the local-scale systems they studied and the global political economy. Today few geographers self-identify as cultural <b>ecologists,</b> but ideas from cultural ecology have been adopted and built on by political ecology, land change science, and sustainability science.|$|R
