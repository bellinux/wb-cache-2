At the start of their trip, they try going through Old Man Pressman's (Stewie) junkyard, only to be chased out by Pressman and his dog Chopper (Brian). As they travel further down the tracks, they are chased across a bridge by a train, which ends up running over Joey's legs, as does another train that follows closely behind, which effectively cripples him.

5|$|The highway enters Geneseo {{from the}} south, taking the name Genesee Street {{as it passes}} {{the western edge of}} the campus of SUNY Geneseo. At the edge of the campus, the route crosses the Genesee River and exits Geneseo. Past the river in the town of York, NY63 begins to curve {{northwest}} up and out of the Genesee River valley until it runs east–west once again at the hamlet of Piffard. The major junction in York is the community of Greigsville, where NY63 reconnects with NY36. This next section of highway has become a major shortcut for traffic heading to the Buffalo area, despite remaining a two-lane road through open rural country, since it is both physically shorter than <b>going</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> to the New York State Thruway as well as toll-free. Most of this Buffalo-bound traffic follows NY36 north from Mount Morris and turns on to NY63 here. Signage along this route reflects this use.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: During {{the past}} fifty years {{there has been}} extensive, continuous, and growing {{interaction}} between logic and computer science. In fact, logic has been called "the calculus of computer science". The argument is that logic plays a fundamental role in computer science, similar to that played by calculus in the physical sciences and traditional engineering disciplines. Indeed, logic {{plays an important role in}} areas of computer science as disparate as architecture (logic gates), software engineering (specification and verification), programming languages (semantics, logic programming), databases (relational algebra and SQL), artificial intelligence (automated theorem proving), algorithms (complexity and expressiveness), and theory of computation (general notions of computability).
