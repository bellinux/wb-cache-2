40|$|Bile acid (BA) sequestrants, lipid-lowering agents, may be {{prescribed}} as a monotherapy or combination therapy {{to reduce the}} risk of coronary artery disease. Over 33 % of adults in the United States use complementary and alternative medicine strategies, and we recently reported that grape seed procyanidin extract (GSPE) reduces <b>enterohepatic</b> BA <b>recirculation</b> as a means to reduce serum triglyceride (TG) levels. The current study was therefore designed to assess the effects on BA, cholesterol and TG homeostatic gene expression following co-administration with GSPE and the BA sequestrant, cholestyramine (CHY). Eight-week old male C 57 BL/ 6 mice were treated for 4 weeks with either a control or 2 % CHY-supplemented diet, after which, they were administered vehicle or GSPE for 14 hours. Liver and intestines were harvested and gene expression was analyzed. BA, cholesterol, non-esterified fatty acid and TG levels were also analyzed in serum and feces. Results reveal that GSPE treatment alone, and co-administration with CHY, regulates BA, cholesterol and TG metabolism differently than CHY administration alone. Notably, GSPE decreased intestinal apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (Asbt) gene expression, while CHY significantly induced expression. Administration with GSPE or CHY robustly induced hepatic BA biosynthetic gene expression, especially cholesterol 7 α-hydroxylase (Cyp 7 a 1), compared to control, while co-administration further enhanced expression. Treatment with CHY induced both intestinal and hepatic cholesterologenic gene expression, while co-administration with GSPE attenuated the CHY-induced increase in the liver but not intestine. CHY also induced hepatic lipogenic gene expression, which was attenuated by co-administration with GSPE. Consequently, a 25 % decrease in serum TG levels was observed in the CHY+GSPE group, compared to the CHY group. Collectively, this study presents novel evidence demonstrating that GSPE provides additive and complementary efficacy as a lipid-lowering combination therapy in conjunction with CHY by attenuating hepatic cholesterol synthesis, enhancing BA biosynthesis and decreasing lipogenesis, which warrants further investigation...|$|R

40|$|Enterohepatic {{recycling}} occurs by {{biliary excretion}} and intestinal reabsorption of a solute, sometimes with hepatic conjugation and intestinal deconjugation. Cycling is {{often associated with}} multiple peaks and a longer apparent half-life in a plasma concentration-time profile. Factors affecting biliary excretion include drug characteristics (chemical structure, polarity and molecular size), transport across sinusoidal plasma membrane and canniculae membranes, biotransformation and possible reabsorption from intrahepatic bile ductules. Intestinal reabsorption to complete the enterohepatic cycle may depend on hydrolysis of a drug conjugate by gut bacteria. Bioavailability is also affected by the extent of intestinal absorption, gut-wall P-glycoprotein efflux and gut-wall metabolism. Recently, there has been a considerable increase in our understanding of the role of transporters, of gene expression of intestinal and hepatic enzymes, and of hepatic zonation. Drugs, disease and genetics may result in induced or inhibited activity of transporters and metabolising enzymes. Reduced expression of one transporter, for example hepatic canalicular multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) 2, {{is often associated with}} enhanced expression of others, for example the usually quiescent basolateral efflux MRP 3, to limit hepatic toxicity. In addition, physiologically relevant pharmacokinetic models, which describe <b>enterohepatic</b> <b>recirculation</b> in terms of its determinants (such as sporadic gall bladder emptying), have been developed.

In this study, we used 32 vitexin- 2 -O-xyloside (VOX), an apigenin- 8 -C-glucoside- 2 -O-xyloside, purified from seeds of Swiss 33 chard (Beta vulgaris cicla), to investigate VOX absorption into portal blood compared to its 34 aglycone, apigenin. We used a rat model in which we ligated the ileo- and colo-caecal junctions, 35 then administered apigenin or VOX directly into the caecum. Blood samples were drawn from the 36 portal vein at timed intervals over 40 min. The kinetic profile of appearance in portal blood of the 37 compounds and their metabolites was evaluated by HPLC-ESI-MS. Apigenin was found in portal 38 blood both as the aglycone and as an apigenin-glucuronide derivative. The VOX was found 39 unchanged and as a reduced monoglycoside, which underwent glucuronidation.

40|$|Hepatic {{sulfation}} {{is thought}} to promote fecal excretion of lithocholate in humans by impairing the <b>enterohepatic</b> <b>recirculation</b> of the compound. Sulfatases produced by the gut flora may, at least in part, counteract this process. To investigate this interaction, female germfree rats, which are known to excrete considerable amounts of sulfated bile salts, were selectively associated with a bile salt desulfating flora. In these rats nearly all cecal, colonic, and fecal bile salt sulfate esters were hydrolyzed, resulting in a decrease of total fecal bile salt excretion of greater than 25 % compared with gnotobiotic rats without a bile salt desulfating flora. Desulfation of allochenodeoxycholate, the major sulfated bile salt in germfree rats, led to an enhanced recirculation and 12 alpha-hydroxylation of the compound in the liver, resulting in an increased fecal output of allocholate. Microbial desulfation of intraperitoneally injected [24 - 14 C]taurolithocholate- 3 -sulfate caused a fivefold decrease of the fecal plus urinary excretion rate of the isotope to approximately that found for unsulfated [24 - 14 C]taurolithocholate. Coassociation of the gnotobiotic rats with a microflora that normalized the small intestinal transit time and cecal size led to a rise of total fecal bile salt excretion of greater than 30 % and a twofold accelerated excretion of both sulfated and unsulfated injected [24 - 14 C]taurolithocholate. We conclude that in rats the gut flora rapidly desulfates intestinal bile salt sulfates, enhancing the <b>enterohepatic</b> <b>recirculation</b> and subsequent hydroxylation of the desulfated bile salts.

Methods: To determine whether mycophenolic acid kinetics vary after renal transplantation and to examine the potential role of <b>enterohepatic</b> <b>recirculation,</b> we investigated the kinetics of mycophenolic acid and mycophenolic acid glucuronide on days 2, 5, and 28 after transplantation in 10 kidney transplant recipients (male/female ratio, 1. 5; mean age, 41. 7 +/- 5. 0 years) given 1 g mycophenolate mofetil twice a day. To facilitate therapeutic drug monitoring, we examined a limited sampling strategy for estimating 12 -hour mycophenolic acid [AUC(0 - 12) ]. Results: The mean +/- SE AUC(0 - 12) for mycophenolic acid on day 28 was 38. 5 +/- 1. 6 mg. h/L, with a secondary peak 4 to 8 hours after dosing that was attributable to <b>enterohepatic</b> <b>recirculation.</b> Marked variability was shown in the kinetic profile of mycophenolic acid among patients across the three sampling days. Mycophenolic acid AUC(0 - 12) was positively predicted by both serum creatinine (P =. 01) and serum albumin (P =. 03) but not by time after transplantation, body weight, or trough concentration. Limited sampling (at 0, 1, 3, and 6 hours) accounted for 84. 1 % of the variability in the mycophenolic acid AUC(0 - 12) data and predicted the AUC(0 - 12) closely (r(2) = 0. 954) when evaluated in 10 different kidney transplant recipients.

The present review summarizes the main experimental evidence carried out by our research group {{over the past two}} decades, in the attempt to investigate systematically the relationships between structural properties and biological effects of bile acids in humans. Hydrophobic bile acids (chenodeoxycholic acid, deoxycholic acid), but not hydrophilic acids (ursodeoxycholic acid), significantly suppressed hepatic activity of HMG-CoA reductase, the limiting step of cholesterol synthesis, and in vivo cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylation, the limiting step of bile acid synthesis. The output of biliary cholesterol and phospholipid was also directly related to the hydrophobicity of the bile acid pool. Finally, treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid, but not with ursodeoxycholic acid, significantly decreased gall-bladder emptying rates. When turning to the in vitro model of HepG 2 cells, hydrophobic bile acids were found to induce greater cytotoxic and pro-apoptotic effects.

In contrast, MPAG and AcMPAG AUCs as well as predose MPAG concentrations significantly decreased. Six months after cyclosporin withdrawal, MPA AUC and predose values tended to return to initial values, whereas metabolite concentrations remained low.

Results Individual concentration–time profiles showed evidence of an absorption lag time and <b>enterohepatic</b> <b>recirculation</b> of MPA in some patients on some occasions. The best base model had bi-exponential elimination with a typical population (SE%) apparent clearance (CL/F) of 29 l/h (5 %) and apparent volume of the central compartment of 65 l (7 %). CL/F decreased significantly with increasing serum albumin (1. 42 l/h reduction in total plasma CL/F with each 1 g/l increase in albumin) and was 27 % greater in patients receiving cyclosporine than in those receiving tacrolimus. Evaluation of the final model showed close agreement between pairs of bootstrapped and final model parameter estimates (all difference...|$|E
40|$|Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), a prodrug of {{mycophenolic acid}} (MPA), is {{increasingly}} {{used in the}} prophylaxis of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT). Few pharmacokinetic data are available {{about the use of}} MMF for this indication. This case series aimed at analyzing the pharmacokinetics of MMF in a population of HCT recipients representative for everyday practice. From 15 HCT recipients, serial plasma samples were taken after twice-daily oral intake of MMF. Plasma concentrations of total MPA and its glucuronide metabolites, as well as free MPA, were quantified. Median apparent oral MPA clearance (CL/F), apparent half-life, and total MPA area under the curve for hours 0 to 12 (AUC 0 - 12, normalized to 1000 mg MMF) were, respectively, 56 L/h (range: 29 - 98 L/h), 2. 3 hours (range: 0. 8 - 5. 7 hours), and 18. 0 mg*h/L (range: 10 - 35 mg*h/L). Total MPA concentrations were below 2 mg/L 8 hours after MMF administration, indicating reduced <b>enterohepatic</b> <b>recirculation.</b> Median free MPA AUC 0 - 12 (normalized to 1000 mg MMF) was 224 microg*h/L (range: 56 - 411 microg*h/L). Because of high CL/F, total MPA exposure in HCT recipients is low and apparent half-life is short in comparison with reference values from renal transplantation. Exposure may be improved in HCT recipients by higher or more frequent MMF dosin...|$|E
40|$|Increased small {{intestinal}} permeability caused by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) {{is probably a}} prerequisite for NSAID enteropathy, a source of morbidity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. This increased small {{intestinal permeability}} may be a summation of a local effect during drug absorption, a systemic effect after absorption, and a local effect of the drug excreted in bile, but the relative contribution made by these factors is unknown. We assessed the effect of indomethacin and nabumetone on intestinal permeability. The principal active metabolite of nabumetone, 6 -methoxy- 2 -naphthylacetic acid, {{is not subject to}} appreciable <b>enterohepatic</b> <b>recirculation.</b> Twelve volunteers were studied before and after one week's ingestion of indomethacin (150 mg/day) and nabumetone (1 g/day) with a combined absorption/permeability test. Neither drug had a significant effect on the permeation of 3 - 0 -methyl-D-glucose, D-xylose, and L-rhamnose. Indomethacin increased the permeation of radioactive 51 chromium ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid (51 Cr EDTA) significantly from baseline (mean (SEM) 0. 63 (0. 09) % v 1. 20 (0. 14) %, p less than 0. 01) but nabumetone did not (0. 70 (0. 10) % p greater than 0. 1). These results were supported by the 51 Cr EDTA/L-rhamnose urine excretion ratios, which reflect changes in intestinal permeability. They suggest that NSAIDs increase intestinal permeability during absorption or after biliary excretion and that the systemic effect is of minor importance...|$|E
40|$|Case-control {{studies in}} diverse populations {{around the world}} have {{reported}} a lower risk of breast cancer in association with higher intake of dietary fibre and complex carbohydrates. Although this has not been confirmed in prospective studies in the USA, the observations have prompted the hypothesis that prolonged use of dietary fibre supplements might reduce breast cancer risk in high-incidence populations. Several possible mechanisms of action have been suggested, all involving a reduction of bioactive oestrogen levels in the blood. The various mechanisms are not necessarily mutually exclusive. First, a high-fibre diet might reduce circulating oestrogen levels by reducing the <b>enterohepatic</b> <b>recirculation</b> of oestrogen. Second, many plants and vegetables contain isoflavones and lignans capable of conversion in the bowel into weak oestrogens that may compete with oestradiol for target binding-sites. Third, a high-fibre diet is less often associated with obesity, which tends to increase availability of the biologically active 16 -alpha metabolites of oestrone. Fourth, a high-fibre diet usually has a lower content of fat and a higher content of antioxidant vitamins, which may protect against breast cancer risk. Finally, diets rich in fibre and complex carbohydrates have been shown to improve insulin sensitivity, with an associated reduction in circulating oestrogen levels. Synergism between these effects offers a possible mechanism by which a high fibre intake might suppress breast cancer growth in women...|$|E
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the disposition and metabolism of sulfasalazine (SASP) in eight adults with and without inflammatory bowel disease. SASP is poorly absorbed (< 12 %) and the half-time measured in the serum, 10. 2 h, is probably the half-time of absorption and therefore an overestimate of the true half-time. The apparent volume of distribution is low (< 9 l). Renal and biliary clearance rates are low (5. 5 and 2. 1 ml min - 1 respectively) probably due to {{a high degree of}} protein binding. Of the absorbed SASP, two thirds is excreted in the urine and one third in the bile. Most of the SASP reaches the colon and is there split by bacteria, forming sulfapyridine (SP) and 5 -aminosalicylic acid (5 -ASA). SP is almost completely absorbed and, with its metabolites, is excreted in the urine (SP renal clearance rate 32. 1 ml min - 1). There is no <b>enterohepatic</b> <b>recirculation.</b> Of the 5 -ASA released in the colon at least 25 % is absorbed and rapidly eliminated in the urine after acetylation. At least 50 % is eliminated in the faeces. There are no differences in disposition characteristics when comparing patients with and without inflammatory bowel disease but the metabolism of SASP is markedly reduced in patients taking antibiotics and after removal of the large bowel...|$|E
40|$|The {{gallbladder}} is conventionally {{regarded as}} an absorptive organ such that dilute hepatic bile is both stored and concentrated. We studied 35 patients who had recovered from a percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder drainage performed for acute cholecystitis. After an overnight fast, gallbladder bile was dark brown in color and had a wide scatter in the lipid composition. Two hours after a meal, the gallbladder bile was opalescent white in color and had the composition of an extracellular fluid. This phenomenon was uniformly observed in all 35 patients and was also consistently reproducible when five patients were repeatedly studied. We used normal dog gallbladder epithelial cell monolayers grown in culture and examined sodium flux. Control gallbladder cells absorbed sodium. When secretin (0. 5 - 2. 5 x 10 - 7 M) was added, there was a prompt reversal of sodium flux, resulting in net secretion. We conclude that secretion is a physiological function of the gallbladder mucosa. After feeding, the neural and humoral factors divert stored and newly secreted bile into the duodenum and induce active de novo secretion thus producing a gallbladder bile that is opalescent white with no lipids. Our results also have important implications {{on the origin of}} the pathological 'white bile,' the pathogenesis and treatment of gallbladder sludge, as well as the kinetic analysis of compounds undergoing <b>enterohepatic</b> <b>recirculation.</b> link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
