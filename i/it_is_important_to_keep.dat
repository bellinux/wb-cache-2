25|$|The {{catalyst}} protonates the Alkenes (Propene, Butene) {{to produce}} reactive carbocations, which Alkylate Isobutane. The reaction {{is carried out}} at mild temperatures (0 and 30nbsp&°C) in a two-phase reaction. Because the reaction is exothermic, cooling is needed: SAAU plants require lower temperatures so the cooling medium needs to be chilled, for HFAU normal refinery cooling water will suffice. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> a high ratio of Isobutane to Alkene {{at the point of}} reaction to prevent side reactions which produces a lower octane product, so the plants have a high recycle of Isobutane back to feed. The phases separate spontaneously, so the acid phase is vigorously mixed with the hydrocarbon phase to create sufficient contact surface.|$|E
25|$|Storage of {{butadiene}} as a compressed, liquified gas {{carries a}} specific and unusual hazard. Over time, polymerization can begin, creating a crust of solidified material (popcorn polymer, {{named for its}} appearance) inside the vapor space of the cylinder. If the cylinder is then disturbed, the crust can contact the liquid and initiate an auto-catalytic polymerization. The heat released accelerates the reaction, possibly leading to cylinder rupture. Inhibitors are typically added to reduce this hazard, but butadiene cylinders should still be considered short-shelf life items. The hazard presented by popcorn polymer is also present in bulk commercial storage tanks. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the oxygen concentration in the tanks and any process wash water low {{in order to reduce}} the rate of polymerization.|$|E

Other relatively common {{causes of death}} due to GHB ingestion include aspiration of vomitus, positional asphyxia, and trauma sustained while intoxicated (e.g., motor vehicle accidents while {{driving under the influence}} of GHB). The risk of aspiration pneumonia and positional asphyxia risk can be reduced by laying the patient down in the recovery position. People are most likely to vomit as they become unconscious, and as they wake up. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the victim awake and moving, who must not be left alone due to the risk of death through vomiting.

25|$|While using a gas stove, it is {{advised to}} also use {{ventilation}}. Studies {{show that in}} homes with gas stoves, if ventilation is used while using gas stoves, then children have lower odds of asthma, wheezing and bronchitis as compared to children in homes that never used ventilation. If venting isn’t possible, then replacing gas stoves with electric stove could be another option. Replacing gas stoves with electric ranges could greatly reduce the exposure to indoor NO2 and improve the respiratory function of children with asthma. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> gas stoves and heaters in good repair so they are not polluting extra NO2. 2015 International Residential Code that requires that vent hoods are used for all stoves and set standards for residential buildings. This requires that all range hoods have a vent that discharges outside. You can also prevent NO2 exposure by avoiding cigarette smoking and not idling your car whenever possible.|$|E
25|$|When a nucleon {{such as a}} proton or neutron {{is added}} to a nucleus, the nuclear force attracts it {{to all the other}} nucleons of the nucleus (if the atom is small enough), but {{primarily}} to its immediate neighbours due to the short range of the force. The nucleons in the interior of a nucleus have more neighboring nucleons than those on the surface. Since smaller nuclei have a larger surface area-to-volume ratio, the binding energy per nucleon due to the nuclear force generally increases with the size of the nucleus but approaches a limiting value corresponding to that of a nucleus with a diameter of about four nucleons. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> in mind that nucleons are quantum objects. So, for example, since two neutrons in a nucleus are identical to each other, the goal of distinguishing one from the other, such as which one is in the interior and which is on the surface, is in fact meaningless, and the inclusion of quantum mechanics is therefore necessary for proper calculations.|$|E

500|$|For one-page {{drawings}} of either style, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> {{the number of}} crossings small {{as a way of}} reducing the visual clutter of the drawing. Minimizing the number of crossings is NP-complete, but may be approximated with an approximation ratio of [...] where [...] is the number of vertices. Minimizing the one-page or two-page crossing number is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by the cyclomatic number of the given graph, or by a combination of the crossing number and the treewidth of the graph. Heuristic methods for reducing the crossing complexity have also been devised, based e.g. on a careful vertex insertion order and on local optimization.|$|E
500|$|From 1848 to 1864, Denmark and the German Confederation {{fought over}} control of the two duchies of Schleswig and Holstein. Historically, the duchies had been ruled by Denmark since medieval times, but there {{remained}} a large German majority. This majority was sparked to rebellion after Frederick VII of Denmark announced on 27 March 1848 the duchies would {{become an integral part of}} Denmark under his new liberal constitution. Prussia soon became involved, supporting the uprising and beginning the First Schleswig War. Ernest sent 8,000 men initially, adding to the army sent by the German Confederation. He also desired to be given a military job during the war, but was refused, as it was [...] "extremely difficult to offer me a position in the army of Schleswig-Holstein corresponding to my rank", according to his memoirs. He agreed to a smaller command, coming to lead a Thuringian contingent; he commented in a letter to his brother that [...] "I should have declined any other command of the kind, but I could not refuse this one, as, in the present condition of our States, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the executive power in our hands".
