Three wires, having ratios of length to diameter in the approximate proportion 1 : 5 : 10, were tested in the vertical position. Due to time limitations, only the shortest of these was tested in a horizontal position. A check was made {{to determine whether the}} results were influenced by the geometry of the <b>enclosing</b> <b>vessel.</b> For pressures at which the molecular mean free path is smaller than the wire diameter, the results appear to satisfy a relation of a form derived for free-molecule heat conduction. Small departures from this behavior at the higher pressures are attributed to the effects of natural convection. The Nusselt number was found not to be uniquely related to the product of the Grashof and Prandtl numbers, as has been proposed, for values of this product below 10 [^- 5].

40|$|Summary. The {{requirement}} for sterility in plant tissue cultures avoidance of dehydration can impose sealing requirements that severely limit {{the rate of}} gas exchange {{in and out of}} the culture vessel. Conditions within the culture vessel such as the depth of any water cover, the presence of gelling agents, the bulk and porosity of the tissue and the temperature also strongly influence in vitro rates of gas exchange, primarily driven by diffusion. This article uses elements of Fick’s Law of Diffusion to identify key factors limiting gas exchange between culture and its immediate surroundings. In particular, it identifies static liquid media, gelling agents, large tissue mass and warm temperatures as imposing severe limits on diffusive flux for gases such as O 2, CO 2 and ethylene. The principle barrier to diffusive exchange of gases between the in vitro and ex vitro atmospheres is the wall of the <b>enclosing</b> <b>vessel.</b> This is invariably made of glass or plastic that is gas-impermeable and well-sealed against evaporative drying or entry of micro-organisms. Cultures enclosed in this way will, inevitably, asphyxiate unless a compensating pathway for diffusive gas exchange is contrived or replaced by some system of convective flow that carries gases to and from the tissue. Supplementing diffusive aeration with convective flow is the basis of most successful hydroponics systems for whole plants and may be a prerequisite for securing levels of aeration suitable for autotrophic cultures. The paramount consideration is the extent to which the total rate of consumption or production of a particular gas by the cultured tissues is matched by the maximum rates of gas transport imposed by the culture itself, its immediate surroundings and the ventilation and sealing system of the culture enclosure...|$|E

40|$|The flow {{development}} and heat transfer in a differentially heated cavity containing a non-Newtonian fluid is studied using CFD techniques. Investigations {{are made for}} a fluid obeying a power-law type behaviour, for a nominal Rayleigh number of 105. Both dilatant and pseudoplastic regimes are considered and the Nusselt number is obtained {{for a range of}} power-law index values. The results, given in a graphical and tabular form, suggest that deviations from Newtonian stress-strain behaviour can lead to large changes in overall heat transfer. These changes are due to the behaviour of the wall boundary layers. In the dilatant, or shear-thickening regime, the isothermal wall layers are thick and slow-moving; as a consequence, buoyancy induced flow affects the whole of the cavity volume. In contrast, the pseudoplastic (or shear-thinning) regime leads to thin, fast-moving wall layers whose effect does not propagate to the core of the cavity which remains stagnant. This behaviour, which is directly attributable to the local value of the fluid viscosity, causes the average Nusselt number to decrease with the power-law index, n. Pseudoplastic fluids are therefore better at conducting heat than Newtonian fluids, and conversely dilatant fluids are worse. The information contained in this paper is of general interest to workers in heat transfer, but is more specifically relevant to researchers in non-Newtonian fluids.

40|$|Many of the wastes {{generated}} by the DOE complex are both hazardous and radioactive. Mixed wastes must be treated to remove the hazardous waste component before they are disposed as radioactive waste. This paper discusses {{the development of a}} treatment process for mixed wastes that exhibit the reactive hazardous characteristic. Specifically, these wastes react readily and violently with water. Wastes such as lithium hydride (LiH), sodium metal, and potassium metal are the primary wastes in this category. Besides their tendency to react with water, the wastes also produce alkaline hydroxides and hydrogen gas as products of the reactions. If in aqueous form and if the pH exceeds 12. 5, the alkaline hydroxides must be further processed to lower the pH to the range of 2 [...] 12. 5 to remove the corrosive hazardous characteristic. The hydrogen gas formed during treatment is not considered a RCRA hazardous waste, but the hydrogen poses a substantial safety hazard because it can form explosive mixtures with air. Tritium may also be substituted for hydrogen in the LiH. If tritium is present, special processing may be necessary to avoid exhausting tritium into the environment. Because of the requirement to control environmental exposure to radioactivity contained in the wastes, the process design requires a reaction within <b>enclosed</b> <b>vessels.</b> These vessels require inert gas purging with subsequent off-gas scrubbing and high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration before discharge to the atmosphere.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. This {{study was}} {{designed}} to assess the relative contributions of intimal hyperplasia and stent compression to the lumen narrowing seen after intracoronary stenting and to determine whether the lumes enlargement produced by angioplasty of in-stent restenosis results primarily from compression or extrusion of intimal hyperplasia through the stent or from additional stent expansion. Background. Palmaz-Schatz stent placement outwardly displaces plaque and eliminates elastic vessel recoil to provide a large and smooth lumen. Some degree of late lumen narrowing occurs within each stent and causes significant restenosis (≥ 50 % stenosis) in 25 % to 30 % of treated lesions. It has not been clear, however, whether this narrowing results from stent compression (crush) or from in-stent intimal hyperplasia. Because the Palmaz-Schatz stent has a distinct radiographic shadow, it is possible to determine the late diameter of both the stent and the <b>enclosed</b> <b>vessel</b> lumen to assess the relative contributions of these two processes. Methods. From cineangiograms, initial (after stenting) and late (follow-up) lumen and stent diameters were examined in 55 patients (59 stents, group I) who had both immediate and 6 -month (192 ± 117 days) angiography. Lumen and stent diameter were also examined before and after dilation in 30 patients (30 stents, group II) who underwent angioplasty of severe in-stent restenosis. Results. Late loss in minimal lumen diameter was 0. 99 ± 0. 87 mm for group I despite only a slight (0. 03 ± 0. 23 -mm) reduction in the corresponding stent diameter. After redilation for in-stent restenosis, the acute gain in minimal lumen diameter was 1. 51 ± 0. 82 mm for group II, again without appreciable increase (0. 06 ± 0. 20 mm) in stent diameter. Conclusions. Restenosis after intracoronary Palmaz-Schatz stenting appears to be due predominantly to lumen encroachment by intimal hyperplasia within the stent, with minimal contribution of stent compression. Lumen enlargement after coronary angioplasty of in-stent restenosis appears to be due primarily to compression or extrusion of intimal hyperplasia the ough the stent, or both, rather than to further stent expansion...|$|R
40|$|Anthropogenic climate change, caused {{primarily}} by excessive {{emissions of carbon}} dioxide, {{has led to a}} renewed interest in char, the solid product of pyrolysis. When applied to soil as biochar it can both sequester carbon and improve soil function. To make its manufacture environmentally friendly and economically viable it is important to maximise char yield, which can be done by promoting secondary reactions. This research shows that secondary reactions, which are enhanced by prolonged vapour-phase residence time and concentration, not only increase the char yield but are the source {{of the majority of the}} char formed. All four biomass constituents (extractives, cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin) undergo secondary reactions concurrent with primary reactions over the entire pyrolysis range ≈ 140 to 500 °C, which makes it practically impossible to separate them. Secondary char formation was confirmed to be exothermic which affects the overall heat of pyrolysis. Impregnating the feedstock with the elements K, Mg and P, which are plant macro-nutrients naturally present in biomass, resulted in the catalysis of secondary char formation. The results reveal that a first order reaction model does not describe pyrolysis accurately when char formation is enhanced by catalysis and secondary reactions. Secondary char can be enhanced by increasing the particle size but there is a limit due to increased cracking and fracturing of the pyrolysing solid. This limitation is overcome by pyrolysis in an <b>enclosed</b> <b>vessel,</b> termed autogenous pressure pyrolysis, which was discovered to cause significant changes in the volatile pyrolysis products; indicating the co-production of a high quality liquid. This process, however, negatively affects the char properties relevant for biochar like the surface area, similar to self-charring and co-carbonisation of condensed volatile pyrolysis products. To increase research capabilities a unique high temperature/ high pressure reactor (600 °C at 20 MPa) was designed to allow the detailed characterisation of all three pyrolysis product classes under extreme pyrolysis conditions.
