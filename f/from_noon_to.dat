25|$|In the mid-1990s, popular hosts Ed Coleman and Dave Sims {{had their}} show cancelled. WFAN then {{announced}} that New York Daily News columnist Mike Lupica and WNBC-TV sports anchor Len Berman would co-host the new midday program. The show seemed {{all set to}} go when, at the last minute, Berman decided {{to back out of}} the show. He cited {{that he would have to}} work a near 14-hour day, combining his 10 a.m. start on radio with his WNBC-TV duties, which consisted of him appearing on all three of the station's evening newscasts. WFAN would not let Berman out of his contract, and as a result, the slot was split into two shows: Lupica hosted from 10 a.m. to noon, while Berman hosted <b>from</b> <b>noon</b> <b>to</b> 2 p.m. The split format did not work, and eventually Berman's show would be cancelled and Lupica's show soon followed.|$|E
25|$|The ship's log {{recorded}} {{that land}} was sighted at 6 a.m. on Thursday 19 April 1770. Cook's log used the nautical date, which, during the 18thcentury, assigned the same date to all ship's events <b>from</b> <b>noon</b> <b>to</b> noon, first p.m. and then a.m. That nautical date began twelve {{hours before the}} midnight beginning of the like-named civil date. Furthermore, Cook did not adjust his nautical date to account for circumnavigation of the globe until he had travelled a full 360° relative to the longitude of his home British port, either toward the east or west. Because he travelled west on his first voyage, this a.m. nautical date was the morning of a civil date 14 hours slow relative to his home port (port−14h). Because the south-east coast of Australia is now regarded as being 10 hours fast relative to Britain, that date is now called Friday, 20 April.|$|E

30|$|Finally, if the {{interface}} {{is given a}} previously unseen query such as List fares for all flights leaving after <b>noon</b> <b>from</b> BOS <b>to</b> BWI, it will correctly translate it, since it already “understands” the meaning of fare, flight, leave, <b>noon,</b> <b>from</b> and <b>to.</b> However, with this customization information, {{the current version of}} {{the interface}} {{would not be able to}} answer the query List fares for all flights departing after <b>noon</b> <b>from</b> BOS <b>to</b> BWI, because it does not “understand” the meaning of departing. The new version under development includes a synonym dictionary that will permit answering this query; however, it would not correctly answer the query List fares for all flights flying after <b>noon</b> <b>from</b> BOS <b>to</b> BWI because, in general fly is not considered synonym of leave.|$|R

500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} at Conway Studios in Los Angeles, {{and the band}} stayed at the Sunset Marquis Hotel during the sessions. [...] Nimrod took four months to record; Armstrong partially attributed the lengthy recording time to spending [...] "a little too much time" [...] playing pool and foosball during the sessions. [...] The recording schedule, which lasted <b>from</b> <b>noon</b> <b>to</b> {{two in the morning}} every day, became frustrating for the group members, who began drinking heavily. [...] Bassist Mike Dirnt recalled, [...] "One night one of us was walking down the halls knocking on people's doors while naked."

Hawkins stated that [...] "we basically played each of these songs 100 different times, trying every little thing every different way" [...] and that it was the first time since The Colour and the Shape [...] "that Dave had to deal with someone in the room questioning all his ideas", given the more laid-back approach of previous producer Nick Raskulinecz. Grohl claimed the choices were for the [...] "most powerful, dramatic songs", and that there was an effort to [...] "make everything sound as natural as possible – just like on the albums we grew up listening to", citing 1970s artists such as Neil Young and Wings as a major influence. Shiflett added that for the first time he played lead guitar in some tracks while Grohl [...] "usually works out all the bits" [...] of composition.|$|E
