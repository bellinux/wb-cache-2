40|$|Gilt progeny {{growth and}} health {{performance}} {{is seen as}} a constraint in production systems. Progeny born to gilts (<b>first</b> <b>litter</b> <b>sows)</b> are usually smaller in birth weight and may have insufficient immunoglobulin protection. The rearing ability of gilts compared to older sows is also observed to be lower, however, factors such as piglet birth weight and suckling demand can affect litter gains from gilts and sows. The project reported here investigated the outcomes from cross-fostering litters of gilt progeny onto older parity sows, and vice versa: heavier sow progeny onto gilts or primiparous sows. These were compared with fostered and un-fostered piglets within gilts and sows. Two hundred and forty gilts and sows (parity 3 - 7) were allocated after farrowing to one of six treatments: Gilts with birth progeny (GB); gilts with fostered gilt progeny (GG); gilts with fostered sow progeny (GS); sows with birth progeny (SB); sows with fostered gilt progeny (SG); and sows with fostered sow progeny (SS). The progeny were followed through to weaning and post-weaning growth, feed efficiency and mortality assessments were made until 21 weeks of age when they were slaughtered. There was no overall net benefit to the weaned population by litter swapping progen...|$|R
40|$|Management and {{biological}} factors combine to limit litter size in swine herds. With present technology, improving litter size depends upon {{increasing the number}} born in the <b>first</b> <b>litter</b> and prolonging <b>sow</b> longevity. Methods for improving size of the <b>first</b> <b>litter</b> rely on {{increasing the number of}} eggs ovulated and include flushing (increased feed for at least 10 days before breeding), selecting breeds with high ovulation rates, and delaying breeding until after the pubertal or first estrus.

40|$|Our {{objective}} was to investigate follicle development in sows during and after different Altrenogest treatments post-weaning and relate this to subsequent ovulation rate and embryonic development. Primiparous UPB sows (n = 47) {{were randomly assigned to}} (weaning = Day 0) : control (no Altrenogest, n = 12), RU 8 - 15 (15 mg of Altrenogest, Day- 1 till Day 7, n = 12), RU 8 - 20 (20 mg of Altrenogest, Day- 1 till Day 7, n = 12) or RU 15 - 15 (15 mg of Altrenogest, Day- 1 till Day 14, n = 11). From weaning onwards, trans-abdominal ultrasound was performed daily. Sows were slaughtered on Day 4 or 5 after ovulation. Follicle size increased during Altrenogest treatment and reached a plateau around Day 6, regardless of dose (4. 6 ± 1. 5, 4. 6 ± 1. 6 and 4. 6 ± 1. 6 mm for RU 8 - 15, RU 8 - 20 and RU 15 - 15, respectively). This increase resulted in larger follicles (P = 0. 0002) {{at the onset of the}} follicular phase (i. e. time of weaning for control sows and 24 h after last administration of Altrenogest for treated sows); 4. 8 ± 1. 8, 4. 8 ± 1. 4, 4. 9 ± 0. 9 mm and 2. 9 ± 0. 8, for RU 8 - 15, RU 8 - 20, RU 15 - 15 and controls, respectively. Pre-ovulatory follicle size tended (P = 0. 07) to be larger for treated animals (7. 9 ± 2. 4, 7. 9 ± 0. 7, 8. 6 ± 1. 3 and 6. 9 ± 0. 9 mm for RU 8 - 15, RU 8 - 20, RU 15 - 15 and controls, respectively). The interval follicular phase-oestrus was shorter (P = 0. 005) for treated animals. Treatment did not affect ovulation rate or early embryonic development. However, for treated animals, the increase in follicle size during treatment was positively related with ovulation rate (P = 0. 05). In conclusion, post-weaning treatment with Altrenogest of <b>first</b> <b>litter</b> <b>sows</b> influenced follicle size and shortened the follicular phase, but did not affect ovulation rate or early embryonic development...|$|R
40|$|Mangalica pig has {{a special}} {{significance}} in Hungary, because as a native breed it is substantial to preserve and keep in breeding. The professional membership and coordination of the breeding is performed by the National Association of Mangalica Breeders (NAMB) since 1994. The breed has three colour varieties – blonde, swallow-bellied and red – which are independent breeds verified {{by the results of}} gene-preservation researches. The paper compares prolificacy and rearing performances of the three mangalica breeds and also the determinants influencing the examined indicators among the years 2000 and 2011 on the basis of data from NAMB and National Food Chain Safety Office (NFCSO). It was analysed partly the number of days between two litters, the frequency of litter and the age at <b>first</b> <b>litter</b> of mangalica <b>sows</b> and the other hand the average results of one-day old piglets and the piglets reared to 21 days of age. Mangalica breeds have lower parameters in all indicators compared to a modern pig breed (e. g.

40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to {{evaluate}} the status of breeding work in the reserve stock for selective breeding in Czech Landrace pigs. Evaluation covers the reproductive and productive indicators. The sows of the base stock are split into four groups by age structure: gilts, <b>sows</b> with risk <b>litters,</b> <b>sows</b> with production <b>litters</b> and <b>sows</b> with <b>litter</b> 6 or more. Evaluation covers reproductive indicators, i. e. fertility (number of piglets born, number of live-born piglets and number of surviving piglets) and milk production. The enterprise under evaluation achieved an average of 13 live-born piglets and 11 surviving piglets per sow and litter; the farrowing interval is seven days longer compared with what is normally reported as the best time. Evaluation covers the results of individual performance in gilts and male pigs according to the methodology for field tests. For individual performance, the assessment covers the average daily gain (g), the average backfat thickness (mm) and lean meat percentage (%).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is the {{evaluation}} of performance of basic herd in breeding of ZVPP Doublovičky of Agricultural Company Kosova Hora a. s. The age structure of the herd {{and the results of}} rearing piglets were evaluated. The results of rearing piglets were compared with PIC breeding aims. Basic herd was consisted of 480 - 530 sows. The herd was divided into 4 groups for assessing the age structure of herd - gilts, sows on 1 st and 2 nd litters, 3 rd to 5 th litters, 6 th and higher <b>litters.</b> <b>Sows</b> on the 6 th and higher litters had the majority (35, 9 %). It was also evaluated the decommissioning of sows. The most common reason was the age or musculoskeletal disorders for exclusion. Indicators of fertility were evaluated too - the total number of born, the number of live born and weaned piglets. For this monitoring the basic herd was divided into reproductive and productive herd. Comparing with the objectives of PIC, the results of monitored sows were about 0. 8 - 1 piglet smaller than the PIC breeding aims. Fertility was also monitored according to parity number. The highest number of live born piglets was on the fourth litter. Losses of live born piglets to weaning were 11. 2 %. Most gilts were embedded first in the age of 216 - 225 days. In the pursued breeding piglets were weaned mostly around the 20 th day.

50|$|The {{breeding}} season lasts from July to January in Victoria, {{and may be}} longer further to the north. Females typically give birth to two litters of up to four young in a season, {{and are able to}} mate again shortly after the <b>first</b> <b>litter</b> is born. The second litter then enters embryonic diapause, and is not born until the <b>first</b> <b>litter</b> has finished weaning at about 105 days. Multiple paternity is common, even within litters, as the females are sexually promiscuous. The young remain in the pouch for the first 65 days of life, and the maximum lifespan is about five years.|$|R
50|$|Female snowshoe hares {{can become}} {{pregnant}} anytime after the 35th day of gestation. The second litter {{can therefore be}} conceived before the <b>first</b> <b>litter</b> is born (snowshoe hares have twin uteri). Pregnancy rates ranged from 78 to 100% for females {{during the period of}} <b>first</b> <b>litter</b> production, 82 to 100% for second litters, and for the periods of third and fourth litters pregnancy rates vary with population cycle. In Newfoundland, the average number of litters per female per year ranged from 2.9 to 3.5, and in Alberta the range was from 2.7 to 3.3. The number of litters per year varies with phase of population cycle (see below). In Alberta the average number of litters per year was almost 3 just after a population peak and 4 just after the population low. Females normally first breed as 1-year-olds. Juvenile breeding is rare and has only been observed in females from the <b>first</b> <b>litter</b> of the year and only in years immediately following a low point in the population cycle.|$|R

40|$|The {{individual}} differences between sows in ability to become pregnant were investigated. Data from {{a sample of}} 10 Danish sow herds {{with a total of}} 5786 sows was analyzed. The purpose was to estimate variance between sows in ability to become pregnant. The results indicated a low variability between sows in this ability. 7 % of the total variance could be accounted for as the difference between sows. Compared to other production traits, such as litter size and growth rate this repeatability is slightly lower. The difference in pregnancy rate between sows with different number of failures to become pregnant was calculated using the estimates of the model. When mated for her subsequent <b>litter</b> a <b>sow</b> needing 2 rematings to become pregnant with her <b>first</b> <b>litter,</b> is expected to have a pregnancy rate 5 % lower than a sow without rematings. These results should be taken into account when comparing different culling strategies. Remating had, in general, a negative effect on pregnancy rate, but this effect could not be ascribed to the individual sow. Sows with poor results when remated gave good results when mated regularly. The relationships between pregnancy rate and both remating and parity differed significantly between herds...|$|R

40|$|I {{investigated}} {{the relationship between}} food abundance and black bear reproductive success. Black bear reproductive potential had been hypothesized {{to be related to}} natural food abundance in other studies but the effect had not been tested. ^ Pregnant females should select dens of maximum thermal efficiency to conserve body fat used for thermoregulation. If this were so they could allocate more depot fat to lactation. I examined data on natal den type (open nest, brushpile, covered) and subsequent survival of cubs in Massachusetts and Minnesota over 11 and 13 years, respectively. I could not detect any differences in cub survival but the power of tests was low (power = 0. 139 to 0. 258). ^ I could not predict either litter size or MFYS from environmental and harvest variables. When natural food abundance was low black bears used cornfields intensely and did not differ in body weight from high food years. Litter size and MFYS were related to <b>litter</b> order; <b>first</b> <b>litters</b> were smaller and had lower survival than subsequent litters. Sixty percent of Massachusetts females had their <b>first</b> <b>litter</b> at 3 years old. Twelve of 20 <b>first</b> <b>litters</b> were of single cubs and 10 of 12 <b>first</b> <b>litters</b> were totally lost. ^ I hypothesized that female black bears operated according to the life history theory of tradeoffs between present and future reproduction. Having cubs is not very costly to bears, raising them is. Thus, females had cubs at an early age (3 years old) but often could not find enough food in spring to both lactate and continue structural growth. Thus, <b>first</b> <b>litters</b> were usually lost. ^ I provide the first direct test of the hypothesis of the effect of diet quality on milk composition and cub survival in free-ranging bears. Milk composition differed between years of varying spring diet quality. Milk fat was lower when diet fat was low but MFYS was not different between the high fat and low fat years. I conclude that in Massachusetts, and likely most of eastern North America, natural food abundance has little effect on bear reproduction because bears can access alternate food sources. ...|$|R
