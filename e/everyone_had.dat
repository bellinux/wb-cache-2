5|$|Ed Brubaker's uncle, John Paxton, was a noted Hollywood screenwriter in the 1930s and 1940s {{known for}} Murder, My Sweet, Crossfire, The Wild One and On the Beach. His wife, Sarah Jane Paxton, worked public {{relations}} for 20th Century Fox at the same time. They told Brubaker stories about their experiences, and he developed a lifelong fascination with the time and setting. In particular, {{he was drawn to}} the false personas he felt <b>everyone</b> <b>had</b> to put forward to succeed.|$|E
5|$|Several {{scenes in}} the episode were filmed at a Canadian Airlines {{operations}} center in Richmond, British Columbia. The crew were given permission by the airline to use their flight simulators, leading to the production being delayed while <b>everyone</b> <b>had</b> a turn simulating flights over Canada. The problematic command center set was constructed and filmed at an amphitheater in Vancouver, whose sloping surfaces helped to suggest computer terminals without needing much construction, although false computer monitors were added for shots when {{they would be in}} view.|$|E
5|$|At 20:15, {{the camp}} was secured from the Japanese and Prince fired his flare to signal {{the end of the}} assault. No gunfire had {{occurred}} for the last fifteen minutes. However, as the Rangers headed towards the meetup, Cpl. Roy Sweezy was shot twice by friendly fire, and later died. The Rangers and the weary, frail, and disease-ridden POWs {{made their way to the}} appointed Pampanga River rendezvous, where a caravan of 26carabao carts waited to transport them to Plateros, driven by local villagers organized by Pajota. At 20:40, once Prince determined that <b>everyone</b> <b>had</b> crossed the Pampanga River, he fired his second flare to indicate to Pajota and Joson's men to withdraw. The Scouts stayed behind at the meetup to survey the area for enemy retaliatory movements. Meanwhile, Pajota's men continued to resist the attacking enemy until they could finally withdraw at 22:00, when the Japanese forces stopped charging the bridge. Joson and his men met no opposition, and they returned to help escort the POWs.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} days, houses were wooden boards fronted by a four-board-high fence which was fronted with a boardwalk. Most {{of the streets}} were dirt roads. Winters were bitterly cold, and teams of horses {{dragging}} V-shaped wooden plows cleared the streets. In {{the center of town}} was the community pump, from which the village would draw water at stipulated hours. Water was pumped from the mine twice a day through a big open pipe. <b>Everyone</b> <b>had</b> to carry water home during pumping time. There was no shutoff valve, so buckets, tubs and barrels were used for water storage. Later, a water tower was built to hold water drawn from a deep well. St. Bernard dogs helped carry the water from the well to the homes. Running water and bathtubs came only after ditches were dug for pipes to provide water from Gilbert around 1916. Kerosene lamps provided the means of lighting until 1916, when power lines were installed. Initially, the only telephone was at the Elba mine office.|$|E
5|$|The {{mandatory}} pit stops, {{during which}} all drivers {{need to change}} into a second car, started on lap 17. Everyone came in at this point except the two NEXTEV TCR drivers Piquet and Charles Pic. D'Ambrosio managed {{to get ahead of}} Buemi into second place thanks to swift work from his crew. Piquet benefited from his late stop by moving ahead into eighth after <b>everyone</b> <b>had</b> pitted and having more power left to use {{towards the end of the}} race. Heidfeld ran into additional trouble during the second half of the race, losing two positions during the final laps to both Loïc Duval (Dragon Racing) and the fast running Piquet, who managed to finish fifth from thirteenth on the grid, even closing on Duval on the final lap. Meanwhile, di Grassi won comfortably from d'Ambrosio, the gap being more than twelve seconds.|$|E
5|$|On May 3, 1969, while Hendrix {{was passing}} through customs at Toronto International Airport, {{authorities}} detained him after finding {{a small amount}} of what they suspected to be heroin and hashish in his luggage. Four hours later, he was formally charged with drug possession and released on $10,000 bail. He was required to return on May 5 for an arraignment hearing. The incident proved stressful for Hendrix, and it weighed heavily on his mind during the seven months that he awaited trial, which took place in December of that year. For the Crown to prove possession they had to show that Hendrix knew the drugs were there. During the jury trial he testified that a fan had given him a vial of what he thought was legal medication, which he put in his bag not knowing what was in it. He was acquitted of the charges. Mitchell and Redding later revealed that <b>everyone</b> <b>had</b> been warned about a planned drug bust the day before flying to Toronto; both men also stated they believed that the drugs had been planted in Hendrix's bag without his knowledge.|$|E

5|$|The most bitter {{legal battle}} began in 1809. Evans sued Samuel Robinson—a miller near Baltimore who was using Evans's {{improvements}} {{without a license}} to produce a very modest amount of flour—for damages of $2,500. That sum was deemed unjustifiably high and harsh by many, and Evans's actions rallied the Baltimore community against him, and when the case was finally heard in 1812 many appeared {{in support of the}} defendant. Evans's detractors presented evidence and witnesses at the trial to press the argument that Evans did not truly invent much of what his patents protected. Although the hopper-boy was undoubtedly original, the use of bucket chains and Archimedean screws had been used since ancient times and Evans had only modified some of their features and adapted them for use in a milling context. A now retired Thomas Jefferson weighed into the debate in letters to both Evans and his detractors, questioning the philosophy of patent law and what truly defined 'invention' and 'machine' (and to some extent the validity of his claims) but ultimately defended the purpose of patent law, which was to incentivize innovation by rewarding inventors for their development and sharing of new technology. And Jefferson noted that though Evans's designs consisted of devices that had long existed beforehand, <b>everyone</b> <b>had</b> access to these and yet only Evans had thought to modify and use them in conjunction to build an automatic mill. Ultimately the jury found in favor of Evans, but it was a pyrrhic victory as Evans had put most of the milling community offside in the process, and ultimately reduced his claim against Robinson to $1,000. In response, prominent Evans critic Isaac McPherson, made submission to Congress {{in the wake of the}} trial entitled Memorial to the Congress of Sundry Citizens of the United States, Praying Relief from the Oppressive Operations of Oliver Evans' Patent, seeking to limit the compensation Evans could seek for his patent's use or for Congress to void it altogether. Although the Senate drafted a bill that would roll-back some of Evans's patent rights, it did not pass, and he continued to vigorously pursue his patent fees. It would not be until the Patent Act of 1836 that many of these issues, including what constituted originality in the context of a patent, would be addressed.|$|E

25|$|One {{suggestion}} {{has been}} that Judas expected Jesus to overthrow Roman rule of Judea.

If any member hurt himself during or after the execution of a movement, the movement was deemed a failure.

25|$|Maynard {{developed}} many clever ways {{to improve}} his property and his city. For example, he obtained the right to host the post office at his store; as a result, <b>everyone</b> <b>had</b> {{to come to his}} establishment to get their mail. He sold a lot cheaply to blacksmith Lewis Wyckoff; people needing smithing therefore came to Seattle instead of its rival Port Madison. Perhaps his greatest coup was persuading Henry Yesler to set up a steam sawmill on land sliced from the north part of Maynard's claim and the south part of Boren's. This sawmill helped establish Seattle's economic ascendancy.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the Japanese occupation, the Government of Hong Kong held a {{monopoly}} on the purchase and distribution of food and raw materials including rice and cotton yarn. Price controls by the Government were not eliminated until 1953. The period can best be summarised by low resources and an endless increase in population. Many mainlanders would cross the border to Hong Kong and establish illegal huts on rooftops and edge of mountains. The integration of different groups from China and original tenants of Hong Kong would also create a society in which <b>everyone</b> <b>had</b> to wrestle with the overwhelming number of language dialects.|$|E

25|$|Another {{dominant}} {{message that}} was found in Protestant propaganda {{was the idea that}} every person should be granted access to the Bible to interpret it for themselves; this was the primary reason why Luther translated and published numerous copies of the New Testament during the Reformation years. Protestants questioned the belief that the Pope had the sole authority to interpret scripture. This can be seen in Luther’s publication titled To the Christian Nobility of the German Nation, which criticized the Catholic belief that the Pope was supreme and could interpret scripture however he saw fit. To combat this, Luther put forth arguments from the Bible that indicated that <b>everyone</b> <b>had</b> the ability to interpret scripture and not just the Pope.|$|E
25|$|The {{program is}} {{designed}} to train astronauts to travel to travel to the moon between 2018 and 2020.

She had to spend two weeks (15 days) in an environment in Utah which NASA scientists believe to be similar to that of Mars and work up to 15 hours a day. According to the robotic spacecrafts which have been sent to Mars, the area where the MDRS is situated has a striking resemblance to the Martian landscape. The red Utah rocks contain just as much iron as the rocks on Mars do.

The analogue clock in the front dome was flanked either side by small square controllable air vents. The dashboard was improved and made use of a panel of rocker switches {{in front of the}} driver with each switch designation lighting for night time operation. Previous dashboards hid the switches in places inaccessible whilst moving. Ventilation was again improved though using the same design of moulded air output & light assembly as {{the final version of the}} Panorama I. The racks were trimmed with laminate instead of using vinyl like material from the previous design.|$|E
