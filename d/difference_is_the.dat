5|$|The most {{significant}} and obvious <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> constant flicker of the ghosts, which is frequently {{cited as the}} game's primary flaw.|$|E
5|$|Another <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{manner in}} which random battles are encountered. Like other Final Fantasy games, random battles occur on the world map. However, in Final Fantasy Tactics, random battles only occur in pre-set locations, marked in green on the world map. Passing over one of these spots {{may result in a}} random encounter. Another major aspect of battles is magical attacks. Certain magical attacks cause area of effect damage, and many of the more {{powerful}} magical attacks require several turns of charging. Hit Points of enemy units are also visible to the player (except in the case of certain bosses), allowing the player to know exactly how much damage they still have to inflict on a particular unit.|$|E
5|$|Prior {{to modern}} times, horse breeds {{throughout}} Europe were known {{primarily by the}} name of the region where they were bred. The Lusitano takes its name from Lusitania, an ancient Roman name for the region that today is Portugal. A very similar horse, the Spanish Andalusian, originally described the horses of distinct quality that came from Andalusia in Spain. Some sources state that the Andalusian and the Lusitano are genetically the same breed, and the only <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> country in which individual horses are born. The Lusitano is also known as the Portuguese, Peninsular, National or Betico-lusitano horse.|$|E

2500|$|Phonological <b>differences</b> between <b>the</b> dialects <b>are</b> rare, and {{in general}} sporadic. <b>The</b> only regular <b>differences</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> following: ...|$|R
50|$|Mandatory {{labelling}} or labeling (see spelling <b>differences)</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{requirement of}} consumer products to state their ingredients or components.|$|R
5|$|The {{interaction}} between the Ganymedian magnetosphere and Jovian plasma is in many respects {{similar to that of}} the solar wind and Earth's magnetosphere. The plasma co-rotating with Jupiter impinges on the trailing side of the Ganymedian magnetosphere much like the solar wind impinges on the Earth's magnetosphere. The main <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> speed of plasma flow—supersonic in the case of Earth and subsonic in the case of Ganymede. Because of the subsonic flow, there is no bow shock off the trailing hemisphere of Ganymede.|$|E
5|$|They have {{membranes}} {{composed of}} glycerol-ether lipids, whereas bacteria and eukaryotes have membranes composed mainly of glycerol-ester lipids. The <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{type of bond}} that joins the lipids to the glycerol moiety; the two types are shown in yellow in the figure at the right. In ester lipids this is an ester bond, whereas in ether lipids this is an ether bond. Ether bonds are chemically more resistant than ester bonds. This stability might help archaea to survive extreme temperatures and very acidic or alkaline environments. Bacteria and eukaryotes do contain some ether lipids, but in contrast to archaea these lipids are not {{a major part of}} their membranes.|$|E
5|$|Chi's {{character}} is voiced by Rie Tanaka, and Georgette Rose in its English counterpart. The anime and manga storylines are essentially the same, but they differ slightly. These differences include {{the events in}} the ending, other things such as describing Elda's memory loss, and her special program. In the anime for example, it is explained that Hibiya reset Elda's memories after her husband's death rather than Elda losing them when she took Freya's program in. Another <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> special program that was placed into Elda in the anime, this program appears to have an alternate effect. If Chi finds the Person just for her, all persocoms would be granted the ability to feel emotion. The reason for this is since Ichiro Mihara was the creator of persocoms, he viewed them all as his children. His wish was that if Chi were able to find someone who loved her in return, all his children would be able to share in this happiness by being able to feel emotions the way humans do.|$|E
25|$|The Galician-speaking areas also abide the Spanish naming customs. Main <b>differences</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> {{usage of}} Galician given names and surnames.|$|R
5000|$|The 12" [...] single was {{released}} {{as a series}} of five separate records, though <b>the</b> only <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> design of the sleeve.|$|R
25|$|M3 Mk. A – A {{modified}} M5. <b>The</b> only <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> {{variety of}} machine guns {{were used in}} place of the M49 mount.|$|R
25|$|The only <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{requirement}} {{to satisfy the}} conditions (such as showing marriage status or satisfying entrepreneur requirements) before the two-year period ends.|$|E
25|$|Gate A17 {{also has}} a parking {{position}} designated as A17A that utilizes the same Jetway, The only <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> parking position of the aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Another main <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{size of the}} ball. A smaller ball to the men's {{version is}} often used to {{minimise}} hand injuries when (marking) the ball.|$|E
30|$|Lack of top {{management}} commitment and support {{as well as}} organizational cultural <b>difference</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> next two the most independent barrier to JIT production.|$|R
50|$|Learning level {{descriptors}} vary across qualifications frameworks, {{and understanding}} <b>the</b> similarities and <b>differences</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{first step in}} establishing world reference levels for learning.|$|R
5000|$|M3 Mk. A - A {{modified}} M5. <b>The</b> only <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> {{variety of}} machine guns {{were used in}} place of the M49 mount.|$|R
25|$|Gate B7 {{also has}} a parking {{position}} designated as Gate B7A that utilizes the same Jetway, The only <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> parking position of the aircraft.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} German gemshorn works {{nearly the}} same way as an ocarina. The only <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> material it is made from: the horn of a chamois, goat, or other suitable animal.|$|E
25|$|The 100-won coins have {{exactly the}} same shape as the U.S. quarter, the only <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> composition, with the 100-won coin struck in cupronickel rather than the U.S. quarter's cupronickel-clad composition.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> race <b>was</b> <b>the</b> closest Senate {{election}} of 2006 {{in terms of}} absolute vote difference; the closest race by percentage <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Virginia senate election.|$|R
30|$|The {{main reasons}} behind these <b>differences</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> same as with {{conventional}} oil studies, i.e. URR assumptions, applied forecast models, {{and the historical}} production data.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> SA-150 <b>was</b> {{followed}} by further developed SA-151 which {{was produced in}} 1990-1991. <b>The</b> major <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> platform that <b>was</b> widened by 100 mm.|$|R
25|$|Variables of {{this type}} {{are very similar to}} static storage {{duration}} objects. The main <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> creation time is just prior to thread creation and destruction is done after the thread has been joined.|$|E
25|$|The new $5 bills {{remain the}} same size and use the same—but enhanced—portraits and {{historical}} images. The most noticeable <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> light-purple coloring of the center of the bill, which blends into gray near the edges.|$|E
25|$|All other gaps {{relate to}} the {{difference}} between existing sales (market share) and total sales of the market as a whole. The <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> competitor share. These gaps therefore, relate to competitive activity.|$|E
5000|$|Bonus stages {{are often}} {{confused}} with secret levels, however, {{in the majority}} of games, they are two distinct things. <b>The</b> key <b>differences</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> following: ...|$|R
50|$|Another <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> {{number of}} tracks per album, the UK version {{consisted}} of 16 to 18 tracks, whereas the US version only had 12 tracks.|$|R
3000|$|The proof follows {{along the}} lines of the proof of Proposition 7. <b>The</b> main <b>differences</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> power of each part of the codeword; here, X [...]...|$|R
25|$|Six {{modified}} {{versions of}} the Pacific class were built for the Hong Kong Marine Police as the Protector class. The main <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> installation of a pump-jet engine to supplement the main propulsion.|$|E
25|$|Heavy Ion Beams There {{are also}} {{proposals}} to do inertial confinement fusion with ion beams instead of laser beams. The main <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{mass of the}} beam has momentum, whereas lasers do not.|$|E
25|$|Verb {{conjugation}} {{is slightly}} different, {{but there is}} a great variety amongst dialects. Medieval conjugations were much closer. A characteristic <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> ending of the second person plural, which is -u in Catalan but -tz in Occitan.|$|E
50|$|The MOGA Pro Power was {{released}} November 4, 2013. The design remained {{similar to the}} original MOGA Pro. <b>The</b> main <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> added built-in phone charger.|$|R
50|$|There {{was also}} an {{alternative}} historical version, used by the Patriarch of Aquileia in wartime. <b>The</b> only <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> background, which <b>was</b> red instead of blue.|$|R
50|$|At {{this point}} the {{accounts}} of Diodorus Siculus and Plutarch begin to diverge significantly. <b>The</b> most important <b>differences</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> circumstances of the surrender of Dionysius to Timoleon.|$|R
