5|$|On June 6, 1944, and afterward, {{most of the}} American {{airborne}} landings in Normandy {{were flown}} into areas that were not studded with Rommelspargel. Some flights, however, came up hard against the defense. Accompanying the 82nd Airborne Division, Tito Moruza landed on D-Day with orders to don civilian clothing and make his way to Paris to seize Gestapo papers. His glider hit a wooden pole defense which tore into the three soldiers sitting next to him, mortally wounding them. More casualties were inflicted <b>during</b> <b>delivery</b> of glider infantry reinforcements when some 16–18 gliders landed {{in a field of}} Rommelspargel and the troops that crawled from the wrecked gliders were immediately targeted by German small arms fire. Of 250 troops landing, some 50–60 survived.|$|E

40|$|IDS Number: BIB 31 ISSN: 1050 - 4729 ISBN: 978 - 1 - 4244 - 1646 - 2 This paper {{presents}} a new available feature on the childbirth simulator BirthSIM. This feature offers a risk-free training for novice obstetricians {{to proceed to}} forceps extractions. The different forces involved <b>during</b> <b>deliveries</b> are described and modeled. The choice of a control strategy in order to reproduce all these forces is explained and argued. This paper also introduces the concepts of simple and double synchronization <b>during</b> <b>deliveries.</b> Its application allows to minimize the amount of forces exerted with forceps <b>during</b> an instrumental <b>delivery</b> {{to make it as}} safe as possible. Simulations of forceps extraction carried out by two junior obstetricians are provided and analyzed. The corresponding results are compared to the literature and to the results obtained by an expert...|$|R

25|$|Because bicycle thefts are {{prevalent}} in many cities, a lock {{to secure the}} bike <b>during</b> <b>deliveries</b> is essential. Simple chain and padlocks are often used, with the locked chain worn around the waist like a belt while riding. U-locks are also popular.

25|$|A {{body mass}} index (BMI) over 27 causes a 33% {{decrease}} in likelihood to have a live birth after the first cycle of IVF, compared to those with a BMI between 20 and 27. Also, pregnant women who are obese have higher rates of miscarriage, gestational diabetes, hypertension, thromboembolism and problems <b>during</b> <b>delivery,</b> as well as leading to {{an increased risk of}} fetal congenital abnormality. Ideal {{body mass index}} is 19–30.|$|E
25|$|According to 1998 figures, {{the female}} infant {{mortality}} rate was {{higher than that of}} male children. The maternal mortality rate was also high, as only 20 percent of women were assisted by a trained provider <b>during</b> <b>delivery.</b> Only 9 percent of women used contraceptives in 1985, but by 2000 this figure had increased substantially, and as of 2012/13, the contraceptive prevalence rate was 35.4%.

Our novel method of intermittent wrapping of the uterus <b>during</b> cesarean <b>delivery</b> {{seems to be a}} successful additional approach in the management of uterine atony <b>during</b> cesarean <b>delivery</b> and may be an alternative treatment option to other compressing procedures in order to avoid high blood loss and last but not least postpartum hysterectomy...|$|R
25|$|The Mi-26S was a {{disaster}} response version hastily developed during the containment efforts of the Chernobyl nuclear accident in 1986. Thirty Mi-26 were used for radiation measurements and precision drops of insulating material to cover the damaged No. 4 reactor. It was also equipped with a deactivating liquid tank and underbelly spraying apparatus. The Mi-26S was operated in immediate proximity to the nuclear reactor, with a filter system and protective screens mounted in the cabin to protect the crew <b>during</b> <b>delivery</b> of construction materials to the most highly contaminated areas.|$|E
25|$|In August 2014, MPI {{discovered}} that some traction motor bearings had been shipped improperly to their factory, causing early failures. Locomotives already {{delivered to the}} MBTA were repaired on site, while half of the locomotives were redirected to Altoona Works <b>during</b> <b>delivery</b> for replacement bearings to be installed. The issues were not disclosed to the press until January 2015. While the repairs were performed under warranty {{at no cost to}} the MBTA, they constituted an additional delay that prevented some of the units from entering service prior to the end of 2015. The multiple delays and early mechanical issues have raised concern from industry commentators about the MBTA's procurement process and the overall quality of the locomotives.|$|E
25|$|Most {{babies are}} born head first; however about 4% are born feet or buttock first, known as breech. During labour a woman can {{generally}} eat and move around as she likes, but pushing is not recommended during the first stage or <b>during</b> <b>delivery</b> of the head, and enemas are not recommended. While making a cut {{to the opening of}} the vagina, known as an episiotomy is common, it is generally not needed. In 2012, about 23 million deliveries occurred by a surgical procedure known as Caesarean section. Caesarean sections may be recommended for twins, signs of distress in the baby, or breech position. This method of delivery can take longer to heal from.|$|E

25|$|Muralitharan's {{career was}} beset by {{controversy}} over his bowling action {{for much of}} his international career. Due to an unusual hyperextension of his congenitally bent arm <b>during</b> <b>delivery,</b> his bowling action was called into question {{on a number of occasions}} by umpires and sections of the cricket community. After biomechanical analysis under simulated playing conditions, Muralitharan's action was cleared by the International Cricket Council, first in 1996 and again in 1999. Former Australian Test player Bruce Yardley, who himself was an off spinner in his day, was assigned with the task of ensuring Muralitharan bowled all his deliveries with the same vigour as he would do so in match conditions when tested in 2004. Muralitharan had not commenced bowling the doosra at this time. The legality of his doosra was first called into question in 2004. This delivery was found to exceed the ICC elbow extension limit by nine degrees, five degrees being the limit for spinners at that time. Based on official studies into bowling actions, which revealed that 99% of bowlers whose actions were examined exceeded the elbow flexion limits, ICC revised the limits applying to all bowlers in 2005. The new limit of 15-degrees, one degree greater than Muralitharan was bowling his doosra, allowed him to continue without being called for throwing from then on.|$|E
500|$|Special Operations Command {{first became}} {{involved}} in Somalia in 1992 as part of Operation Provide Relief. C-130s circled over Somali airstrips <b>during</b> <b>delivery</b> of relief supplies. Special Forces medics accompanied many relief flights into the airstrips throughout southern Somalia to assess the area. They were the first U.S. soldiers in Somalia, arriving before U.S. forces who supported the expanded relief operations of Restore Hope. The first teams into Somalia were CIA Special Activities Division paramilitary officers with elements of JSOC. They conducted very high risk advanced force operations prior to the entry of the follow on forces. The first casualty of the conflict came from this team and was a Paramilitary officer and former Delta Force operator name Larry Freedman. Freedman was awarded the Intelligence Star for [...] "extraordinary heroism" [...] for his actions.|$|E
500|$|HIV can be {{transmitted}} from mother to child during pregnancy, <b>during</b> <b>delivery,</b> or through breast milk, resulting in the baby also contracting HIV. This is the third most common way in which HIV is transmitted globally. In the absence of treatment, the risk of transmission before or during birth is around 20% and in those who also breastfeed 35%. As of 2008, vertical transmission accounted for about 90% of cases of HIV in children. With appropriate treatment the risk of mother-to-child infection {{can be reduced to}} about 1%. Preventive treatment involves the mother taking antiretrovirals during pregnancy and delivery, an elective caesarean section, avoiding breastfeeding, and administering antiretroviral drugs to the newborn. [...] Antiretrovirals when taken by either the mother or the infant decrease the risk of transmission in those who do breastfeed. However, many of these measures are not available in the developing world. If blood contaminates food during pre-chewing it may pose a risk of transmission.|$|E

500|$|Whales {{are fully}} aquatic creatures, {{which means that}} birth and {{courtship}} behaviours {{are very different from}} terrestrial and semi-aquatic creatures. Since they are unable to go onto land to calve, they deliver the baby with the [...] fetus positioned for tail-first delivery. This prevents the baby from drowning either upon or <b>during</b> <b>delivery.</b> To feed the new-born, whales, being aquatic, must squirt the milk into the mouth of the calf. Being mammals, they have mammary glands used for nursing calves; they are weaned off at about 11 months of age. This milk contains high amounts of fat which is meant to hasten the development of blubber; it contains so much fat that it has the consistency of toothpaste. Females deliver a single calf with gestation lasting about a year, dependency until one to two years, and maturity around seven to ten years, all varying between the species. This mode of reproduction produces few offspring, but increases the survival probability of each one. Females, referred to as [...] "cows", carry the responsibility of childcare as males, referred to as [...] "bulls", play no part in raising calves.|$|E
