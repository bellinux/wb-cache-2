40|$|Although {{several studies}} {{have been carried out}} on the {{nutritional}} composition of buffalo milk, information about other products, <b>except</b> <b>Mozzarella,</b> are still scarce. The aim of this paper was the evaluation of chemical-physical parameters and the nutritional composition of buffalo yoghurt marketed in Italy. The investigation pointed out that buffalo yoghurt marketed in Italy is characterized by a homogeneous composition, with the exception of fat and apparent viscosity, which values were characterized by a high variability. This is probably attributable to the variability of the milk used in the production process, due to both breed and lactation period of buffalo as well as to variations in yoghurt manufacturing. The little differences noticed among the samples for the other parameters are probably due to the use of different strains of streptococci and lactobacilli in each manufacturing company. The sensory analysis evinced a good appreciation of the examined products. The analysis of volatile compounds allowed to distinguish 4 main groups of molecules: aldehydes, ketones, alcohols and acids. The volatiles present in higher quantity were 3 -hydroxy- 2 -butanone and acetaldehyde, which are mainly responsible for the typical flavour of yoghurts...|$|E
40|$|Low-fat Mozzarella with 6 fat was {{produced}} by using fat replacers at three levels of protein concentrations including 35 (Dairy-Lo), 53 (Simpless) and 90 (LSI 907). The effects of fat substitution and cream homogenization on rheological and sensory properties of cheese were investigated after 1, 7, 14 and 28 days of storage at 4 C. Data showed that meltability and stretchability increased on 14 th day, then reduced while hardness decreased on 28 th day of storage. It was quite obvious that the lowest moisture content was belonged to full-fat cheese and the highest one was belonged to low-fat cheese which {{was produced}} by homogenized cream. Results showed that addition of fat replacers, rather than the actual properties of fat, probably had the greatest influence on the composition, rheological and sensory properties of low fat <b>Mozzarella.</b> <b>Except</b> stretchability, homogenization had a favorable effect on rheological properties. Practical Aplications: Due to increasing rate of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and especially obesity, {{it has become more}} important to reduce dietary intake. But cheese is a good source of protein and calcium. So by reducing in fat content of cheese, it could be easier to access healthier food without any concern about high calorie intake. Whey protein fat replacer has known as an appropriate substitute for fat in low fat Mozzarella. It could be possible to reduce fat content of Mozzarella without undesirable rheological and sensory properties besides protein and calcium intake by whey protein concentrate substitution. It could be better to use promoting technique such as homogenization. Â© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R
