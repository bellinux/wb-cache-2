5|$|After {{their arrival}} in the United Kingdom, the {{battalion}} was transported by rail {{to the south of}} England where it set up a camp at Lopcombe Corner, on Salisbury Plain in Wiltshire. Amidst the backdrop of the Battle of Britain, the battalion's personnel used their integral Vickers machine-guns and Bren guns to provide self-defence against air attack and to bolster the anti-aircraft defences of local areas. They also undertook training exercises and formed a mobile striking force tasked with rapidly responding {{in the event of an}} invasion. In September, the 18th Brigade was transferred to the 9th Division. On 14 October the battalion moved to Meeanee Barracks in Colchester, Essex, where it took over responsibility for a defence sector from a British officer training battalion. The 2/9th remained in Colchester until 10 November when orders came for the 18th Brigade to hand over to the 25th Brigade, and the 2/9th was relieved by the 2/31st Battalion. With the threat of invasion passing as winter came, the decision was made to redeploy the Australians to North Africa where they might be actively employed in combat operations. Following this, preparations for embarkation began as orders were received for the battalion to <b>entrain</b> for Glasgow where, on 15 November 1940, it boarded HMT Strathaird.|$|E
25|$|Air entraining agents add and <b>entrain</b> tiny {{air bubbles}} in the concrete, which reduces damage during {{freeze-thaw}} cycles, increasing durability. However, entrained air entails a trade off with strength, as each 1% of air may decrease compressive strength 5%. If too much air becomes {{trapped in the}} concrete {{as a result of}} the mixing process, Defoamers can be used to encourage the air bubble to agglomerate, rise to the surface of the wet concrete and then disperse.|$|E

25|$|An {{avalanche}} (also {{called a}} snowslide) is a rapid flow of snow down a sloping surface. Avalanches are typically triggered in a starting zone from a mechanical {{failure in the}} snowpack (slab avalanche) when the forces on the snow exceed its strength but sometimes only with gradually widening (loose snow avalanche). After initiation, avalanches usually accelerate rapidly and grow in mass and volume as they <b>entrain</b> more snow. If the avalanche moves fast enough some of the snow may mix with the air forming a powder snow avalanche, which {{is a type of}} gravity current.|$|E
25|$|The spiral troughs {{in the ice}} cap {{are formed}} by {{katabatic}} winds that <b>entrain</b> surface ice eroded from the equator-facing sides of the troughs, likely aided by solar ablation (sublimation), which is then redeposited on the colder pole-facing slopes. The troughs are roughly perpendicular to the wind direction, which is shifted by the Coriolis effect, leading to the spiral pattern. The troughs gradually migrate towards the pole over time; the central troughs have moved about 65km in the last 2 million years. Chasma Boreale is a canyon-like feature older than the troughs, and in contrast is aligned parallel to the wind direction.|$|E
25|$|Although {{primarily}} {{composed of}} flowing snow and air, large avalanches {{have the capability}} to <b>entrain</b> ice, rocks, trees, and other surficial material. However, they are distinct from mudslides which have greater fluidity, rock slides which are often ice free, and serac collapses during an icefall. Avalanches are not rare or random events and are endemic to any mountain range that accumulates a standing snowpack. Avalanches are most common during winter or spring but glacier movements may cause ice and snow avalanches at any time of year. In mountainous terrain, avalanches are among the most serious objective natural hazards to life and property, with their destructive capability resulting from their potential to carry enormous masses of snow at high speeds.|$|E
40|$|Here {{we present}} two {{experiments}} investigating the implicit orienting of attention over time by entrainment to an auditory rhythmic stimulus. In the first experiment, participants {{carried out a}} detection and discrimination tasks with auditory and visual targets while listening to an isochronous, auditory sequence, which acted as the <b>entraining</b> stimulus. For the second experiment, we used musical extracts as <b>entraining</b> stimulus, and tested the resulting strength of entrainment with a visual discrimination task. Both experiments used reaction times as a dependent variable. By manipulating the appearance of targets across four selected metrical positions of the auditory <b>entraining</b> stimulus {{we were able to}} observe how <b>entraining</b> to a rhythm modulates behavioural responses. That our results were independent of modality gives a new insight into cross-modal interactions between auditory and visual modalities in the context of dynamic attending to auditory temporal structure...|$|R

25|$|Early in April 1915, the Northumbrian Division was {{informed}} that it would shortly be sent to France, and on 16 April it began to <b>entrain</b> for the ports of embarkation (Southampton and Folkestone). The division completed its concentration {{in the vicinity of}} Steenvoorde on 23 April. It was thrown into action the very next day at the Battle of St Julien, taking up positions along the Yser Canal and then counter-attacking. The infantry of the division were involved in bitter fighting. Meanwhile, the divisional engineers were left at Steenvorde, but from 26 April they were sent up each night to work on a new defence line near Hill 60, to which the division retired on the night of 2–3 May.|$|E
25|$|The {{conversion}} of marshland to upland for agriculture {{has in the}} past century been overshadowed by conversion for urban development. Coastal cities worldwide have encroached onto former salt marshes and in the U.S. the growth of cities looked to salt marshes for waste disposal sites. Estuarine pollution from organic, inorganic, and toxic substances from urban development or industrialisation is a worldwide problem and the sediment in salt marshes may <b>entrain</b> this pollution with toxic effects on floral and faunal species. Urban development of salt marshes has slowed since about 1970 owing to growing awareness by environmental groups that they provide beneficial ecosystem services. They are highly productive ecosystems, and when net productivity is measured in g m−2 yr−1 they are equalled only by tropical rainforests. Additionally, they can help reduce wave erosion on sea walls designed to protect low-lying areas of land from wave erosion.|$|E
25|$|Heavy rains fell in December 1999 {{along the}} north-central coast of Venezuela, {{culminating}} {{in a period of}} extreme intensity from 14 to 16 December. Starting around 8 PM local time (AST) on 15 December, runoff entered channels and rushed towards the sea, picking up and depositing sediments on its way. Generally after this first wave of flooding, from the coast to just past the crest of the Sierra de Avila, these rains triggered thousands of shallow landslides that stripped soil and rock off of the landscape and sent them slipping down the mountainside. Additional water liquefied these landslides into debris flows, which are granular flows in which water mixes with high concentrations of rock and mud. The first eyewitness accounts of debris flows were from 8:30 PM on the 15th, and the final debris flows were reported between 8 and 9 AM on 16 December. Many catchments released multiple debris flows, some of which carried large boulders and tree trunks onto the alluvial fan deltas. Starting between 7 and 9 AM on the 16th and continuing until late that afternoon, a new wave of floods occurred. These floodwaters were less concentrated in sediment and were therefore able to <b>entrain</b> new material and incise new channels into the flood and debris flow deposits from the previous days.|$|E
40|$|Concrete patch repair {{has long}} been used to repair the damaged {{concrete}} structures. In cold regions, freeze– thaw cycle {{is one of the}} major damage factors. Not only the material itself is damaged by freeze–thaw cycles, but also the adhesive interface, which is regarded as the weakest part of composite system, degrades under freeze–thaw cycles. Air <b>entraining</b> agent {{has long been}} used to increase the freeze–thaw resistance of concrete materials. However, the effect of air <b>entraining</b> agent on the adhesive interface under freeze–thaw cycles has not been explored. The degradation mechanism and failure mode of concrete repair system have not been studied, either. In this study, to investigate the effects of water–cement ratio of substrate concrete and air <b>entraining</b> agent in substrate concrete and repairing mortars, three kinds of substrate concrete were casted and repaired by two kinds of ordinary Portland cement mortar. With certain number of freeze–thaw cycles up to 150 cycles, through splitting prism test, the splitting tensile strength and failure mode of composite specimens were experimented. The relative dynamic elastic modulus and splitting tensile strength of substrate concretes and repairing mortars were obtained as well. Results showed that air <b>entraining</b> agent in the repairing mortar greatly influenced the adhesive tensile strength under freeze–thaw cycles. The water–cement ratio and air <b>entraining</b> agent of substrate concrete insignificantly affected the adhesive interface, but affected the splitting tensile strength and the freeze– thaw resistance of substrate concrete, and thus affected the failure mode of composite specimens...|$|R

This paper made a {{study on}} the effect of {{different}} vibrating parameters on the air content and compressive strength of concrete by the test of using the combining method of vibrating and forced mixing, and compared it with common forced mixing and mixing with air <b>entraining</b> agent. It indicated that the blade of the mixer, also as the vibrating source of vibrating mixing, had a significant effect on the air content of fresh concrete and compressive strength of hardened concrete; the air content of the fresh concrete could be up to 3. 0 %~ 3. 5 % when the vibrating strength was 4 ~ 8, and meanwhile the compressive strength of the hardened concrete was higher; different with improving the air content by adding air <b>entraining</b> agent, the vibrating mixing could increase the air content in the concrete by more retained air from bubbles refined in the mixing process and make the diameters of pores inside in the decreasing direction. In this case, it could not only improve the air <b>entraining</b> effect to achieve the high value of air content required by the construction, but it also could increase the compressive strength of the concrete comparing with the forced mixing with air <b>entraining</b> agent...|$|R

2500|$|Mixing {{also plays}} an {{important}} role in the limitation of primary production by nutrients. [...] Inorganic nutrients, such as nitrate, phosphate and silicic acid are necessary for phytoplankton to synthesise their cells and cellular machinery. [...] Because of gravitational sinking of particulate material (such as plankton, dead or fecal material), nutrients are constantly lost from the photic zone, and are only replenished by mixing or upwelling of deeper water. [...] This is exacerbated where summertime solar heating and reduced winds increases vertical stratification and leads to a strong thermocline, since this makes it more difficult for wind mixing to <b>entrain</b> deeper water. [...] Consequently, between mixing events, primary production (and the resulting processes that leads to sinking particulate material) constantly acts to consume nutrients in the mixed layer, and in many regions this leads to nutrient exhaustion and decreased mixed layer production in the summer (even in the presence of abundant light). [...] However, as long as the photic zone is deep enough, primary production may continue below the mixed layer where light-limited growth rates mean that nutrients are often more abundant.|$|E
