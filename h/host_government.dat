For a camp to be recognized by UNRWA, {{there must be an}} agreement between the <b>host</b> <b>government</b> and UNRWA governing use of the camp. UNRWA does not itself run camps, has no police powers or administrative role, but simply provides services in the camp. Refugee camps, which developed from tent cities to dense urban dwellings similar to their urban surroundings, house around one third of all registered Palestine refugees.|$|E
25|$|While the {{peacekeeping}} force is being assembled, {{a variety of}} diplomatic activities are being undertaken by UN staff. The exact size and strength of the force must be agreed to {{by the government of}} the nation whose territory the conflict is on. The Rules of Engagement must be developed and approved by both the parties involved and the Security Council. These give the specific mandate and scope of the mission (e.g. when may the peacekeepers, if armed, use force, and where may they go within the host nation). Often, it will be mandated that peacekeepers have <b>host</b> <b>government</b> minders with them whenever they leave their base. This complexity has caused problems in the field.|$|E

25|$|In {{times of}} {{relative}} peace, {{the process of}} mine removal {{is referred to as}} demining. This is a thorough, time-intensive process that seeks to locate all mines so that the land or sea area may be safely returned to normal use. It is vital that this process be exhaustive. Even if only a small handful of mines remain undiscovered, incomplete demining can actually lead to an increase in civilian mine casualties as local people re-occupy an area they previously avoided in the belief that it has been made safe. In this context demining is one of the tools of mine action. Coordinated by Mine Action Coordination Centers run by the United Nations or a <b>host</b> <b>government,</b> civilian mine clearance agencies are tasked with the demining. In post-conflict areas, minefields are often contaminated with a mixture of explosive remnants of war (ERW) that includes unexploded ordnance as well as landmines. In that context, the humanitarian clearance effort {{is often referred to as}} battle area clearance.|$|E
25|$|Each {{country office}} (190 countries) carries out UNICEF's mission through a unique {{programme}} of cooperation developed with the <b>host</b> <b>government.</b> This five-year programme focuses on practical ways {{to realize the}} rights of children and women. Regional offices guide this work and provide technical assistance to country offices as needed. Overall management and administration of the organization takes place at headquarters, where global policy on children is shaped. Guiding and monitoring all of UNICEF's work is a 36-member Executive Board made up of government representatives. They establish policies, approve programmes and decide on administrative and financial plans and budgets. Executive Board’s work is coordinated by the Bureau, comprising the President and four Vice-Presidents(Total 5), each officer representing {{one of the five}} regional groups. These five officers, each one representing one of the five regional groups, are elected by the Executive Board each year from among its members, with the presidency rotating among the regional groups on an annual basis. As a matter of custom, permanent members of the Security Council do not serve as officers of the Executive Board. Office of the Secretary of the Executive Board supports and services the Executive Board. It is responsible for maintaining an effective relationship between the Executive Board and the UNICEF secretariat, and helps to organize the field visits of the Executive Board.|$|E
500|$|Almost unanimously, {{the army}} applauded the Night of the Long Knives, {{even though the}} generals Kurt von Schleicher and Ferdinand von Bredow were among the victims. The ailing President Hindenburg, Germany's highly revered {{military}} hero, sent a telegram expressing his [...] "profoundly felt gratitude" [...] and he congratulated Hitler for [...] "nipping treason in the bud". General von Reichenau {{went so far as}} to publicly give credence to the lie that Schleicher had been plotting to overthrow the government. In his speech to the Reichstag on July 13 justifying his actions, Hitler denounced Schleicher for conspiring with Ernst Röhm to overthrow the government; Hitler alleged both were traitors working in the pay of France. Since Schleicher was a good friend of the French Ambassador André François-Poncet, and because of his reputation for intrigue, the claim that Schleicher was working for France had enough surface plausibility for most Germans to accept it. François-Poncet was not declared persona non grata as would have been usual if an Ambassador were involved in a plot against his <b>host</b> <b>government.</b> The army's support for the purge, however, would have far-reaching consequences for the institution. The humbling of the SA ended the threat it had posed to the army but, by standing by Hitler during the purge, the army bound itself more tightly to the Nazi regime. One retired captain, Erwin Planck, seemed to realise this: [...] "if you look on without lifting a finger," [...] he said to his friend, General Werner von Fritsch, [...] "you will meet the same fate sooner or later." [...] Another rare exception was Field Marshal August von Mackensen, who spoke about the murders of Schleicher and Bredow at the annual General Staff Society meeting in February 1935 after they had been rehabilitated by Hitler in early January 1935.|$|E

2500|$|The United States had pumped $202 {{million in}} foreign aid into Laos since 1955. The Pathet Lao were electioneering on a {{platform}} of peace, national unity, and a cleanup of corruption. Prince Phetsarath Ratanavongsa blamed Americans for inflation of the Lao kip, as well as causing governmental fraud. Worried that the non-communists who were favored by America were going to do poorly, Parsons began a crash rural aid program; he named it Booster Shot. Programs were selected to give [...] "immediate and tangible political benefits" [...] to those Lao politicians the U.S. favored. Central Intelligence Agency officer Rufus C. Phillips was placed in charge. He hired ten man teams to carry out Booster Shot. Each team had two specialists in each of five fields—farming, schools, public works, health, and information. In contrast to the usual low-key approach that allowed credit for the aid to redound to <b>host</b> <b>government,</b> Booster Shot was high profile. While the State Department had envisioned air drops from unmarked aircraft, newly arrived ambassador Horace H. Smith took charge and not only insisted on using obviously American aircraft, but on affixing U.S. symbols on the aid packages. Bulldozers were parachuted with both American and Lao flags streaming from them. Smith wanted the U.S. help to be evident to the Lao populace.|$|E

The original publication is available at [URL] success of Chinese-led SEZs in Africa is important to both the Chinese <b>government</b> and the <b>host</b> <b>governments.</b> Even though these zones are operating under market conditions, the role of both sides in creating effective institutional arrangement for SEZs is crucial. The Chinese-led SEZ programme was initiated in 2006 and 2007, and {{was intended to be}} implemented before 2009. Even though the Chinese <b>government</b> and <b>host</b> <b>governments</b> showed their willingness to push forward SEZ programmes vigorously, most of them have not materialised yet. Most of the SEZs have been under construction and are not yet operating. This paper first provides the brief background of the establishment of SEZs in Africa, then the focus moves to stakeholders involved in the programme. Finally, the paper explores the current situations and navigates the role of the <b>host</b> <b>governments</b> to make the SEZs work. To help the Chinese-led SEZs in Africa to become successful, the <b>host</b> <b>governments</b> must remain actively involved in the SEZs, because their support is more significant than any other aspect. Furthermore, they should provide consistent policies and effective incentives for the investors. On the other hand, the <b>host</b> <b>governments</b> should impose firm requirements in terms of technology transfer and basic working conditions so that their countries can reap the benefits of Chinese investment.
