40|$|The {{main tasks}} of central banks are to secure price and {{financial}} stability. These objectives can, {{in times of}} crises, conflict with one another, and the central bank may have to renounce {{one of them in}} order to secure the other. In a monetary union, this trade-off can be exacerbated by the presence of highly indebted countries or by the risk of loose fiscal policies. This paper offers a simple theoretical model that captures the trade-off. Different fiscal institutions are compared in order to evaluate their impact on the conduct of monetary policy. More specifically, the fiscal criteria of the Maastricht Treaty and the Pact for Stability and Growth in Europe are analyzed in light of this model. Fiscal mechanisms exist to help prevent or minimize the risk of fiscal crises and the corresponding risk of central bank financing and inflation.

This article attempts {{to assess the}} future <b>fiscal</b> <b>implications</b> of the National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013, for the Indian economy. The results, under the baseline scenario based on the projected debtâ€“GDP ratio, indicate a modest increase till 2021 â€“ 22 and then debt/GDP declines towards {{the current level of}} 70 % in 2012 â€“ 13, signifying fiscal sustainability. The dynamics of the projected baseline debtâ€“GDP ratio are largely shaped by the provisions of the Act and underlying demographic factors during the projection horizon. Sensitivity analysis under different assumptions about productivity growth, the interest on government borrowing and primary deficitâ€“GDP ratios show mixed results and hence provide necessary policy pointers towards restoring fiscal sustainability under the Act. Keeping the primary deficitâ€“GDP ratio below 1. 5 per cent through periodic upwards revisions in the issue price of food grains, as envisaged in the Act, coupled with higher productivity growth and lower interest on government debt, would ensure long-term fiscal sustainability of the Act.

40|$|Under {{ordinary}} circumstances, the <b>fiscal</b> <b>implications</b> {{of central}} bank policies {{tend to be}} seen as relatively minor and escape close scrutiny. The global financial crisis of 2008, however, demanded an extraordinary response by central banks which brought to light the immense power of central bank balance sheet policies as well as their major <b>fiscal</b> <b>implications.</b> Once the zero lower bound on interest rates is reached, expanding a central bank's balance sheet becomes the central instrument for providing additional monetary policy accommodation. However, with interest rates near zero, the line separating fiscal and monetary policy is blurred. Furthermore, discretionary decisions associated with asset purchases and liquidity provision, as well as with lender-of-last-resort operations benefiting private entities, can have major distributional effects that are ordinarily associated with fiscal policy. In the euro area, discretionary central bank decisions can have immense distributional effects across member states. However, decisions of this nature are incompatible with the role of unelected officials in democratic societies. Drawing on the response to the crisis by the Federal Reserve and the ECB, this paper explores the tensions arising from central bank balance sheet policies and addresses pertinent questions about the governance and accountability of independent central banks in a democratic society...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographyIn {{this paper}} we {{estimate}} the <b>fiscal</b> <b>implications</b> {{of the free}} trade agreement signed between the United States of America and the five Central American countries of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua. Of the five possible effects on fiscal revenue (direct, indirect, elasticity, substitution and induced), in this paper we estimate the first three. The fourth effect is most likely negligible, whereas the estimation of the fifth one would be plagued by uncertainty, so we do not attempt it here. We use comparative statics to estimate the impact. We find the adverse impact of tariff elimination on fiscal revenue is relatively small in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, whereas the greatest impact is in Honduras, where it accounts for almost a five percent loss of tax revenue in only {{the first year of the}} Agreement. The loss of revenue from internal indirect taxes is much smaller for all five countries. After summing the two adverse effects direct and indirect), we find the country least adversely affected by the agreement is Costa Rica. In the first year of the Agreement, the adverse impact is expected to amount to 0. 28 % of GDP. The country most adversely affected is Honduras, whose revenue is forecast to decline 0. 82 % of GDP in the first year of the Agreement. When we calculate the increase in revenue from indirect taxes due to higher imports, we fail to find significant effect in terms of GDP. Despite the fact that in El Salvador and Guatemala the revenue increases almost 0. 2 % of GDP, under the most optimistic growth scenario, it is not enough to compensate for the loss of fiscal revenue due to the CAFTA. After accounting for the positive and negative revenue implications, we conclude that there would be a net loss of fiscal revenue due to the CAFTA in all countries. Given that in most cases the fiscal revenue loss is small, the only country that could have serious fiscal problems due to the CAFTA is Honduras. Even under our most optimistic growth scenario, the loss is estimated to be 0. 73 % of GDP at the beginning of the transition period that lasts twenty years, rising to 0. 78 % at the end of the period. Honduras is also the economy with the highest level of fiscal vulnerability of the five countries, which means that it is less prepared to mitigate the <b>fiscal</b> <b>implications</b> of the CAFTA. The optimistic growth scenario leads countries to balance-of-payments crises. Our most pessimistic scenario assumes some major disruptions to the country (economic, political and/or institutional). Therefore, a moderate growth scenario is perhaps the most plausible for the growth rate of GDP for Central America in the future. Accordingly, we conclude that the <b>fiscal</b> <b>implications</b> of the CAFTA from the moderate growth scenario are the most probable. The Central American countries should use both a reduction of expenditure and an increase in revenue as their main policy to neutralize the adverse <b>fiscal</b> <b>implications</b> of the CAFTA. In addition, economic policies that relax the external constraint on growth would dampen slightly the negative fiscal impact of the CAFTA...|$|R
