5|$|Sameer {{decides to}} leave Goa, and Sunny taunts {{him that he}} <b>got</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> Rani through Sameer's mistakes. Sameer {{says that he has}} had enough dreaming, and wishes Sunny happiness. Sunny taunts Sameer again, and Sameer loses his temper. He chases Sunny through the crowd at a cricket stadium where India and Pakistan are playing a {{friendly}} match. Sameer breaks through security, takes the microphone from guest of honour Kapil Dev and apologises to Rani and her parents. He asks her to marry him in front of the crowd, and Rani runs onto the field and embraces him, thus reuniting with him.|$|E
5|$|In late August, Montgomery sailed {{north from}} Fort Ticonderoga with about 1,200 men. After {{successfully}} besieging Fort Saint-Jean, he captured Montreal on November 13. The two men joined forces in early December, {{and with their}} combined force of about 1,200 soldiers, they attacked Quebec on December 31, 1775. The colonial forces suffered a disastrous defeat {{at the hands of}} General Guy Carleton, governor of Quebec and commander of the British forces. Montgomery was killed leading an assault along with all but one of his officers; his men never <b>got</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the walls. Arnold's force made a descent into the lower town. Early in the battle, Arnold was wounded in the leg, but stayed on the battlefield encouraging his troops on. Daniel Morgan's rifle company, the most successful of the American troops, fought inside the city until Morgan was cornered and forced to surrender. Many others were killed or wounded, and hundreds were taken prisoner.|$|E
5|$|The Bulldogs were {{scheduled}} to play their second game against the Rochester Jeffersons, but faced the Toledo Maroons after that match was cancelled. For the second game in a row the Bulldogs scored over 40 points in a shutout as Martin and Guyon dominated on offense. Martin scored the first touchdown of {{the game with a}} run in the first quarter. In the second quarter, Hendren scored a rushing touchdown, and end Tom Whelan caught a touchdown pass from Grigg. In the third quarter, Martin caught a touchdown pass from Grigg, and Grigg rushed for another. The Bulldogs' final score was a rushing touchdown from back Pete Calac in the fourth quarter. The final score was 48–0. The Maroons never <b>got</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> scoring and did not make a single a first down.|$|E

5|$|In August 1979, Atari {{produced}} an arcade game {{version of the}} concept called Lunar Lander. This version featured monochrome vector graphics and allowed the player to rotate the ship right or left and fire thrusters controlled with a proportional throttle control system using a joystick with a spring. Like Moonlander, both a graphical display of a repeating mountainous surface {{as well as a}} text readout of the ship's speed, altitude, and remaining fuel are displayed. Once a game begins, it only ends when a player runs out of fuel, rather than due to a time limit; players can insert quarters to add fuel to their current game. Bonus points are awarded for landing on difficult parts of the map. The game features four levels of difficulty in controlling the ship. Lunar Lander was Atari's first vector graphics game and the first multiple-perspective video game; when the lander <b>got</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the surface, the view changed to a close-up view of the lander. The vector engine was inspired by Space Wars (1978) and created by Rick Moncrief and Howard Delman, who developed Lunar Lander alongside Rich Moore. The idea for the game came from Delman, who had seen a graphical version of the game, likely Moonlander, a few years prior. At least one other arcade game based on the Lunar Lander concept was developed around the same time, Lunar Rescue by Taito.|$|E

25|$|He {{qualified}} for the 1997 K-1 GP when he beat James Warring at the K-1 Grand Prix '97 1st Round on September 7, 1997. At {{the beginning of the}} fight, Warring pretended that he wanted to sportsmanly touch gloves with Aerts and then attempted to sneakily punch him with a right overhand when he <b>got</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> him. Aerts was able to dominate the rest of the fight before knocking him cold with a right high kick in round three.|$|E
25|$|On July 28, 1863, Ferguson was {{promoted}} to brigadier-general. He was subsequently recommended for promotion to Major-General, but Joseph Wheeler quickly objected. During Sherman's March to the Sea, Ferguson and his cavalrymen harassed the flank of the United States Army. When Sherman <b>got</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> Savannah, Ferguson's men left their horses and covered the Confederate retreat. He was then ordered to Danville, Virginia, but before arriving was ordered to go to Charlotte, North Carolina. From Charlotte he escorted Jefferson Davis into Georgia, where his unit was disbanded.|$|E

Boesel {{was part of the}} winning team at the 1988 Daytona 24 Hours, a race which was also won by fellow Brazilians Christian Fittipaldi (twice, in 2004 and 2014), Oswaldo Negri (2012), Kanaan (2015) and Pipo Derani (2016). Fittipaldi also won the United SportsCar Championship in 2014 and 2015, {{alongside}} Portuguese team-mate João Barbosa. Also the Mil Milhas Brasil, an endurance race, has the longest history in the Brazilian racing events.|$|E

25|$|Spitzer {{devised a}} plan to set up his own {{sweatshop}} in the city's garment district, where he turned out shirts, pants and sweaters, and hired 30 laborers. The shop manager eventually <b>got</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the Gambinos, and officials were able to plant a bug in their office. The Gambinos, rather than being charged with extortion – which was hard to prove – were charged with antitrust violations. Joseph and Thomas Gambino, the latter being an extremely high-ranking member, and two other defendants took the deal and avoided jail by pleading guilty, paying $12 million in fines and agreeing {{to stay out of}} the business.|$|E
25|$|Wainwright first {{played for}} Yorkshire in 1888, and {{immediately}} established {{his place in}} the side, chiefly through an innings of 105 against the Australians. He developed slowly {{over the next couple of}} years, but his performance on a sticky wicket at Sheffield in 1891 was the performance that established Wainwright as a deadly soft-wicket bowler. Wainwright showed no advancement as a batsman until 1893, when he <b>got</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> doing the double and played his first Test at Lord's without success. Wainwright was Yorkshire's leading wicket-taker in 1892, though they fared only modestly, and in 1893, aided by some bad wickets due to a dry spring, he took 90 wickets for 12.55 each, to help Yorkshire win its first Championship. By this time, he and Bobby Peel were the finest slow bowling partnership in county cricket, and they were often unplayable when the wicket helped them.|$|E
25|$|The {{day of the}} murder, an {{eyewitness}} came forward and told investigators that she allegedly saw {{the two young men}} involved in Bermúdez Zacarías' murder. She said that the two men were of slim complexion and may have been 24–25 years old; according to her description, one was fully dressed in black and that the other had dark pants and a white sweater. The woman saw them as she was driving through the street where Bermúdez Zacarías was murdered. When she first saw the two men, she did not think they were suspicious because she thought they were construction workers from a nearby site. As she was driving down the street, she saw Bermúdez Zacarías on the road and thought that he had fainted. When she <b>got</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the body, she noticed a pool of blood. She turned back to look at the two men, who kept walking down the street in an opposite direction.|$|E

25|$|Mining was {{intended}} to destroy fortifications and the troops in them and to prevent the opponent from doing the same. Mining had to be conducted under conditions, which concealed the effort from the opponents, to prevent counter-mining. Excavated material in the Loos area was chalk and thus easily seen; some of the material {{was used in the}} front line but most had to be removed by large carrying-parties and dumped out of sight of German ground observers and the crews and cameras of reconnaissance aircraft. A shaft was dug well back in the defensive system and then a gallery was driven forward, with branch galleries dug at intervals. As the main gallery <b>got</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> German defences, the need for silence became paramount, to elude the Germans conducting a similar mining operation. Plans of the mine workings were kept, on which rival German works were plotted, based on mines already sprung and the reports of listeners.|$|E
25|$|Cao Cao was {{impressed}} {{when he heard}} about Xu Shu and was eager to recruit Xu as an adviser. He invited Xu Shu's mother to meet him and asked her to write a letter to her son, requesting that her son come to join him. Xu Shu's mother refused, denounced Cao Cao as a treacherous villain, and threw an ink stone at him. The furious Cao Cao ordered Xu Shu's mother to be executed but changed his mind when Cheng Yu reminded him that Xu Shu would be more determined to help Liu Bei oppose him if he killed his mother. Cao Cao then had Xu Shu's mother detained and asked Cheng Yu to pretend to be Xu Shu's sworn brother to win the trust of Xu's mother. After some time, Cheng Yu <b>got</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> Xu Shu's mother and learnt to mimic her handwriting. He wrote a letter to Xu Shu in the handwriting of Xu's mother, telling Xu that she was in trouble and urging him to come to the imperial capital Xu (許; present-day Xuchang, Henan) quickly. Xu Shu was a filial son so he immediately left for Xu after reading the letter.|$|E
25|$|In 109 BC, Emperor Wu started {{yet another}} {{territorial}} expansion campaign. Nearly a century earlier, a Chinese General named Wiman {{had taken the}} throne of Gojoseon and had established Wiman Joseon at Wanggeom-seong (王險), modern Pyongyang), which became a nominal Han vassal. When Wiman's grandson King Ugeo (衛右渠, 위우거) refused to permit Jin's ambassadors to reach China through his territories, Emperor Wei sent an ambassador She He (涉何) to Wanggeom to negotiate a right of passage with King Ugeo, but King Ugeo refused and had a general escort She back to Han territory. When they <b>got</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> Han borders, She assassinated the general and claimed to Emperor Wu that he had defeated Joseon in battle. Emperor Wu, unaware of his deception, made him the military commander of the Commandery of Liaodong (modern central Liaoning). King Ugeo, offended, made a raid on Liaodong and killed She. In response, Emperor Wu commissioned a two-pronged attack (one by land and one by sea) against Joseon. Initially, Joseon offered to become a vassal, but peace negotiations broke down by the Chinese forces' refusal to let a Joseon force escort its crown prince to Chang'an {{to pay tribute to}} Emperor Wu. Han took over the Joseon lands in 108 BC and established four commanderies.|$|E

25|$|At zero {{hour the}} {{creeping}} bombardment began and infantry {{crawled out of}} their trenches, the first men pulling the following troops over the parapet. The British began to follow the creeping barrage, a moderate German counter-barrage fell short of Snag Trench and massed machine-gun fire began from the flanks, causing many casualties as the British troops struggled through the mud at walking-pace. The remaining men of the 1/8th DLI <b>got</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> Butte Trench, where they were also hit by British artillery and Stokes mortar fire and then retired to Snag Trench, leaving wounded and stragglers in shell-holes. On the right flank, a supporting Australian attack failed when the Australian artillery barrage fell behind the front line and a machine-gun barrage was so inaccurate that bullets hit the DLI trenches. In the centre the 1/6th DLI was held up {{on the right and}} on the left managed to overrun Gird Trench and form a strong point. The attack of the 1/9th DLI on the left flank, took the quarry, overran the butte and established a machine-gun position, advanced to Gird Trench and dug in on the Albert–Bapaume road. By noon, the 1/6th DLI were held up in Maxwell Trench and the 1/9th DLI had consolidated at the quarry, Gird Trench, Gird Support Trench and Butte Alley.|$|E
25|$|On 9 May 1795 Strachan, in , was {{in command}} of a {{squadron}} that attacked and destroyed a French convoy in Cartaret Bay. The British squadron spotted a convoy of 13 vessels and immediately gave chase. Twelve of the quarry escaped and <b>got</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the shore where a small shore battery, their own armed escorts, and a brig and a lugger offered some protection. Strachan sent in the boats from the vessels in his squadron while Melampus and the ships provided covering fire. The French crews abandoned their vessels at {{the approach of the}} British and eventually the shore battery also stopped firing. The cutting out party retrieved all the vessels, save a small sloop, which was hard ashore and which they burnt. Melampus had eight men wounded and in all the British lost one man killed and 14 wounded. They captured a gun brig and a gun lugger, each armed with three 18-pounder guns. They also captured the convoy, which consisted of: Prosperitte (80 tons and carrying cordage), Montagne (200 tons and carrying timber, lead and tin plates), Catharine (200 tons and carrying ship timber), Hyrondelle (220 tons and carrying ship timber and pitch), Contente (250 tons, carrying powder), Nymphe (120 tons carrying fire wood), Bonne-Union (150 tons), Fantazie (45 tons carrying coals), Alexandre (397 and carrying ship timber, cordage, hemp and cannon), and Petit Neptune (113 tons and carrying ship timber). A later prize money report added the names of two more vessels, Crachefeu and Eclair. Crachefeu was the gun-brig and Eclair the gun-lugger; the Royal Navy took both into service.|$|E
25|$|Racing resumed on lap 38 and López <b>got</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> Buemi {{but could}} not get ahead of Buemi. Di Grassi elected to make a pit stop and aimed to record the race's fastest lap. Frijns, Dillmann and Gutiérrez were issued five-second time {{penalties}} after they were observed speeding under full course yellow flag conditions. Bird recorded the race's fastest lap on lap 42, completing a circuit in one minute and 2.422 seconds, earning him one championship point. With two laps of the race remaining, di Grassi locked his brakes and crashed at turn eight with the front-end of his car. As was the case the previous year, the event finished behind the safety car and Buemi secured the victory. López finished second, 0.707 seconds behind, achieving his first Formula E podium, and Heidfeld took his second consecutive third-place finish. Abt caused confusion when his car stopped on track halfway before the start/finish line with a battery management system failure; drivers behind him were hesitant to pass him {{for fear of being}} issued with a penalty, creating a large blockade on the narrow backstraight. Rosenqvist finished fourth with Prost fifth. Frijns was demoted to sixth after his time penalty was applied, with Piquet, Dillmann, Evans and Sarrazin rounded out the top ten points-scoring positions. Gutiérrez finished eleventh after his time penalty was enforced with Turvey, Abt, Conway, Carroll and Bird the last of the classified finishers. It was Buemi's fifth victory of the season, his first in Paris, and the eleventh of his career. There were three lead changes in the race; three drivers reached the front of the field. Buemi led twice for a total of 44 laps, more than any other driver.|$|E
