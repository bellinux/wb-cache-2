The estimators of parameters of the <b>distributed</b> <b>lags</b> models and the autoregressive <b>distributed</b> <b>lags</b> models enable to create the estimators of these basic characteristics. It is obvious that the values of estimators depend on the form of the time series transformation. The methodology of selection of suitable transformation of time series is based on the principle of maximization of the likelihood function. The computation of basic characteristics of the lags in the econometric model is illustrated on the example of the analysis of relationship between the interest rates on new granted credits and 1 R PRIBOR. This analysis revealed some changes in character of dependency of time series and changes of values of estimators of basic lag characteristics in the period since 1993.

50|$|In an {{infinite}} <b>distributed</b> <b>lag</b> model, {{an infinite}} number of lag weights need to be estimated; clearly this can be done only if some structure is assumed for the relation between the various lag weights, with the entire infinitude of them expressible in terms of a finite number of assumed underlying parameters. In a finite <b>distributed</b> <b>lag</b> model, the parameters could be directly estimated by ordinary least squares (assuming the number of data points sufficiently exceeds the number of lag weights); nevertheless, such estimation may give very imprecise results due to extreme multicollinearity among the various lagged values of the independent variable, so again {{it may be necessary to}} assume some structure for the relation between the various lag weights.|$|E

In the first equation, the dependent variable {{is assumed to be}} affected by values of the independent variable arbitrarily far in the past, so the number of lag weights is infinite and the model is called an infinite <b>distributed</b> <b>lag</b> model. In the alternative, second, equation, there are only a finite number of lag weights, indicating an assumption that there is a maximum lag beyond which values of the independent variable do not affect the dependent variable; a model based on this assumption is called a finite <b>distributed</b> <b>lag</b> model.|$|E

50|$|Structured <b>{{distributed}}</b> <b>lag</b> models {{come in two}} types: finite and infinite. Infinite distributed lags {{allow the}} value of the independent variable at a particular time to influence the dependent variable infinitely far into the future, or to put it another way, they allow the current value of the dependent variable to be influenced by values of the independent variable that occurred infinitely long ago; but beyond some lag length the effects taper off toward zero. Finite distributed lags allow for the independent variable at a particular time to influence the dependent variable for only a finite number of periods.|$|E

Specification of the regression equation is very straightforward: one includes as explanators (right-hand side variables in the regression) the one-period-lagged value of the dependent variable and the current value of the independent variable: ...|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} between antibiotic consumption and selection of resistant strains {{has been studied}} mainly by employing conventional statistical methods. A time delay in effect must be anticipated and this has rarely been {{taken into account in}} previous studies. Therefore, <b>distributed</b> <b>lags</b> time series analysis and simple linear correlation were compared in their ability to evaluate this relationship. Data on monthly antibiotic consumption for ciprofloxacin, piperacillin/tazobactam, carbapenems and cefepime as well as Pseudomonas aeruginosa susceptibility were retrospectively collected for the period April 2006 to July 2007. Using <b>distributed</b> <b>lags</b> analysis, a significant temporal relationship was identified between ciprofloxacin, meropenem and cefepime consumption and the resistance rates of P. aeruginosa isolates to these antibiotics. This effect was lagged for ciprofloxacin and cefepime [1 month (R= 0. 827, P= 0. 039) and 2 months (R= 0. 962, P= 0. 001), respectively] and was simultaneous for meropenem (lag 0, R= 0. 876, P= 0. 002). Furthermore, a significant concomitant effect of meropenem consumption on the appearance of multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa strains (resistant to three or more representatives of classes of antibiotics) was identified (lag 0, R= 0. 992, P< 0. 001). This effect was not delayed and it was therefore identified both by <b>distributed</b> <b>lags</b> analysis and the Pearson's correlation coefficient. Correlation coefficient analysis was not able to identify relationships between antibiotic consumption and bacterial resistance when the effect was delayed. These results indicate that the use of diverse statistical methods can yield significantly different results, thus leading to the introduction of possibly inappropriate infection control measures...|$|R

50|$|The {{underlying}} {{theory of}} adstock {{is that the}} exposure to television advertising builds awareness in the consumer markets, resulting in sales. Each new exposure to advertising increases awareness to a new level. The decay effect of adstock eventually reduces awareness to its base level, unless or until this decay is reduced by new exposures. This decay effect can be mathematically modelled and is usually {{expressed in terms of}} the ‘half-life’ of the advertising. A ‘two-week half-life’ means that it takes two weeks for the awareness of an advertising to decay to half its present level. Every Ad copy is assumed to have a unique half-life. Some academic studies have suggested half-life range around 7- 12 weeks, while industry practitioners typically report half- lives between 2-5 weeks, with the average for Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) Brands at 2.5 weeks. Adstock half-life can be estimated through a <b>distributed</b> <b>lag</b> model response with lags of the TV Gross Ratings Point (GRP) variable, using Least Squares.|$|E
