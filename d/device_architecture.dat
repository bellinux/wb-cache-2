50|$|The {{foundation}} for UPnP networking is IP addressing. Each device must implement a DHCP client {{and search for}} a DHCP server when the device is first connected to the network. If no DHCP server is available, the device must assign itself an address. The process by which a UPnP device assigns itself an address is known within the UPnP <b>Device</b> <b>Architecture</b> as AutoIP. In UPnP <b>Device</b> <b>Architecture</b> Version 1.0, AutoIP is defined within the specification itself; in UPnP <b>Device</b> <b>Architecture</b> Version 1.1, AutoIP references IETF RFC 3927. If during the DHCP transaction, the device obtains a domain name, for example, through a DNS server or via DNS forwarding, the device should use that name in subsequent network operations; otherwise, the device should use its IP address.|$|E

40|$|Conductive polymer {{electrodes}} have exceptional {{promise for}} next-generation bioelectronics and energy conversion devices due to inherent mechanical flexibility, printability, biocompatibility, and low cost. Conductive polymers uniquely exhibit hybrid electronic-ionic transport properties that enable novel electrochemical <b>device</b> <b>architectures,</b> {{an advantage over}} inorganic counterparts. Yet critical structure-property relationships to control the potential-dependent rates of charge transfer at polymer/electrolyte interfaces remain poorly understood. Herein, we evaluate the kinetics of charge transfer between electrodeposited poly-(3 -hexylthiophene) films and a model redox-active molecule, ferrocenedimethanol. We show that the kinetics directly follow the potential-dependent occupancy of electronic states in the polymer. The rate increases then decreases with potential *(both normal and inverted kinetic regimes), a phenomenon distinct from inorganic semiconductors. This insight can be invoked to design polymer electrodes with kinetic selectivity toward redox active species and help guide synthetic approaches {{for the design of}} alternative <b>device</b> <b>architectures</b> and approaches...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} optimization {{techniques for}} 20 nm channel length novel Si/SiGe heterojunction p-i-n p-channel tunnel field-effect transistors using extensive device simulations. Three different <b>device</b> <b>architectures</b> are compared. It is shown that {{depending on the}} Ge mole fraction in SiGe and the gate voltage, the tunneling could be from the channel to source or within the source only. Due to this, a very careful optimization of the Ge mole fraction is required to achieve optimum performance. It is also shown {{for the first time}} that a vertical gate induced source tunneling is present in the devices and that this could be utilized for improving ON state current by increasing the gate-source overlap. Of the three <b>device</b> <b>architectures</b> compared, the structure with SiGe channel and Si source/drain is found to give better ON state current.

Presently, {{collective}} {{understanding of}} the involved processes and requisite components {{that may lead to}} maturation of organic photovoltaic devices from bench top concept to disruptive solar energy conversion technology have not affected efficiencies within the balance of systems threshold.
