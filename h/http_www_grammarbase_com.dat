These classes of interest can be classes of applications (e.g. <b>HTTP,</b> FTP, <b>WWW,</b> DNS and P 2 P), applications (e.g. Skype [310], YouTube [488] and Netflix [331]), or class of service [390]. A class of service, for instance based on QoS, encompasses all applications or classes of applications that have the same QoS requirements.

40|$|Imaging methods with {{elemental}} contrast are {{of great}} value for the investigation of historical paintings, as they allow for study of sub surface layers that provide insight into a painting s creation process. Two {{of the most important}} methods are neutron activation autoradiography NAAR and scanning macro XRF MA XRF. Given the differences between these methods in the fundamental physical phenomena exploited, a theoretical comparison of their capabilities is difficult and until now a critical comparison of their use on the same painting is missing. In this paper, we present a study of Rembrandt van Rijn s painting Susanna and the Elders from the Gemäldegalerie in Berlin employing both techniques. The painting features a considerable number of overpainted features and a wide range of pigments with different elemental tracers, including earth pigments Mn Fe, Azurite Cu, lead white Pb, vermilion Hg and smalt Co, As. MA XRF can detect all elements above Si Z 14, suffers from few spectral overlaps and can be performed in a few tens of hours in situ, i. e. in a museum. NAAR requires the stay of the painting at a research facility for several weeks, and inter element interferences can be difficult to resolve. Also, {{only a limited number of}} elements contribute to the acquired autoradiographs, most notably Mn, Cu, As, Co, Hg and P. However, NAAR provides a higher lateral resolution and is less hindered by absorption in covering layers, which makes it the only method capable of visualizing P in lower paint layers.

40|$|This {{issue of}} Acta Crystallographica Section F is {{dedicated}} towards structural investigations on proteins associated with molecular parasitology, specifically research linked to protozoan pathogens. It {{is in line}} with the previous special sections or issues contributed by the RIKEN UK structural genomics consortium December 2009, the Joint Center for Structural Genomics in October 2010 Weiss amp; Einspahr, 2010 [Weiss, M. S. amp; Einspahr, H. 2010. Acta Cryst. F 66, 1406. ] and the Seattle Structural Genomics Center for Infectious Diseases in September 2011 Weiss amp; Einspahr, 2011 [Weiss, M. S. amp; Einspahr, H. 2011. Acta Cryst. F 67, 1159. ]. In contrast to the previous issues however, it is thematically much more focused on protozoan pathogens. Interest in these primitive eukaryotic organisms is often to exploit them as model systems and many significant advances have resulted from such research. As examples there are the fundamentally important discoveries relating to RNA editing, antigenic variation and the occurrence of glycosylphosphatidylinositol tags that anchor proteins on the cell surface, all accrued from research with the African trypanosome. However, a major impetus to study protists is the drastic toll they take on human life. The World Health Organization provide documentation and sobering statistics on the diseases and their impact on human health. For example <b>http</b> <b>www.</b> who. int mediacentre factsheets fs 375 en is their recently updated information sheet on Leishmaniasis. Researchers have sought to understand the processes that allow pathogens to exist, to invade a host, to evade the immune response, and to cause debilitating and often fatal diseases.

30|$|Transmission control {{protocol}} (TCP) [1] is a connection-oriented unicast transport protocol that offers the following features: explicit and acknowledged connection initiation and termination; end-to-end reliability; in-order, and not duplicated data delivery; flow control; congestion avoidance; and out-of-band indication of urgent data. These multifold characteristics of TCP make it {{by far the}} most used transport protocol in Internet applications such as <b>www</b> (<b>HTTP),</b> mail (SMTP), file transfer (FTP) and remote access service (Telnet). In fact, TCP was originally designed to perform well in wired networks where the network congestion is the main reason for packet loss and it deals with this effectively by making corresponding transmission adjustment to its congestion window. At the present time, the Internet spans a very large base of heterogeneous networks such as wired and wireless, and ensuring that TCP provides efficient services for such a complex environment is a continuing mission of researchers.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present new {{modeling}} and analysis technique for characterizing the steady state {{performance of a}} TCP flow. We invert the loss process in our model, by treating loss events arriving at the source as a Poisson stream rather than packets going out on the network with some loss probability p. This enables us to model the window size behavior as a Poisson Counter driven Stochastic Differential Equation and perform analysis. We use the data collected in [1] to validate our modeling and analysis technique. Results indicate that our model is able to capture the behavior of TCP throughput quite accurately. Our technique enables simple fluid analysis of TCP and other TCP-like congestion control mechanism. I.

40|$|Euphorbia ingens is {{the largest}} of the {{succulent}} tree Euphorbias in Southern Africa. In South Africa, it is most abundant in the northern portion of the country, especially in the Limpopo and North West Provinces. In the mid-nineties, E. ingens were noted to show symptoms of disease, and by 2000 severe mortality had begun to occur in the Limpopo Province. Various factors have been suggested as possible causes of this mortality. We investigated the possible involvement of changes in climate in the sudden die-offs of E. ingens. Four sites within the severely affected Limpopo Province and two sites in the less affected North West Province were included. Nine linear transects were established at each site. Each tree within a transect was scored as alive or dead, and as mature or juvenile. Insect and disease symptoms, and environmental variables were also evaluated. Trees in the Limpopo Province were more severely affected by disease and insects and exhibited higher levels of mortality compared to trees in the North West Province. Analyses of weather data revealed greater upward trends in temperature and downward trends in precipitation in the Limpopo Province compared with the North West Province. Estimates of potential evapotranspiration and water balance indicated an increase in water demand while precipitation has remained the same or has decreased. The dramatic degree of mortality of E. ingens that has been observed since about 2000 appears to be linked to increasing moisture deficits resulting in tree stress, which in turn allows opportunistic fungal pathogens and insects to increase in severity, ultimately contributing to tree mortality.

Due to the dynamic nature of the Web, it becomes harder to find relevant and recent information [...] We present a new model and architecture of the Web Crawler using multiple <b>HTTP</b> connections to <b>WWW.</b> The multiple <b>HTTP</b> connection is implemented using multiple threads and asynchronous downloader module so that the overall downloading process is optimized. The user specifies the start URL from the GUI provided. It starts with a URL to visit. As the crawler visits the URL, it identifies all the hyperlinks in the web page and adds them {{to the list of}} URLs to visit, called the crawl frontier. URLs from the frontier are recursively visited and it stops when it reaches more than five level from every home pages of the websites visited and it is concluded that {{it is not necessary to}} go deeper than five levels from the home page to capture most of the pages actually visited by the people while trying to retrieve information from the internet. The web crawler system is designed to be deployed on a client computer, rather than on mainframe servers which require a complex management of resources, still providing the same information data to a search engine as other crawlers do...|$|R
