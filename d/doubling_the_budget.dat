40|$|We evaluate, for the U. S. case, {{the costs}} and {{benefits}} of three security measures designed to reduce the likelihood of a direct replication of the 9 / 11 terrorist attacks. To do so, we assess risk reduction, losses, and security costs in the context of the full set of security layers. The three measures evaluated are installed physical secondary barriers (IPSB) to restrict access to the hardened cockpit door during door transitions, the Federal Air Marshal Service (FAMS), and the Federal Flight Deck Officer (FFDO) Program. In the process, we examine an alternate policy measure: <b>doubling</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> of the FFDO program to $ 44 million per year, installing IPSBs in all U. S. aircraft at a cost of $ 13. 5 million per year, and reducing funding for FAMS by 75 % to $ 300 million per year. A break-even cost-benefit analysis then finds the minimum probability of an otherwise successful attack required for the benefit of each security measures to equal its cost. We find that the IPSB is costeffective if the annual attack probability of an otherwise successful attack exceeds 0. 5 % or one attack every 200 years. The FFDO program is costeffective if the annual attack probability exceeds 2 %. On the other hand, more than two otherwise successful attacks per year are required for FAMS to be costeffective. A policy that includes IPSBs, an increased budget for FFDOs, and a reduced budget for FAMS may be a viable policy alternative, potentially saving hundreds of millions of dollars per year with consequences for security that are, at most, negligible...|$|E

40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{a number of}} key problems commonly confronted in the literature on international demand analysis. These include data issues and requirements, multistage budgeting, outliers, group heteroskedasticity, and model selection. A two-stage demand system is fit to International Comparison Programme data for 114 countries for nine aggregate categories and eight food sub-categories of goods. Outliers are identified and omitted from the sample. Parameter estimates for the two stages are obtained with a maximum-likelihood procedure that corrects for group heteroskedasticity. Country-specific income and own-price elasticities are calculated and indicate that poor countries are more responsive to changes in income and prices than rich countries. We also find evidence for the strong version of Engel’s law; when income <b>doubles,</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> share of food declines by approximately 0. 10. 1...|$|R
