40|$|Based on two surveys – a French and a Luxembourgish one – with in-depth-interviews, {{this paper}} {{examines}} {{the implementation of}} nutritional recommendations in two European countries. Each of them has promoted at governmental level a public health campaign regarding food consumption and daily diet. In which way – and by which social categories – are the recommendations taken in and put into practice, and if so, which appropriation processes and interpretations occur? Do the social, societal and cultural differences between Luxembourg and France, in terms of standard of living and dissemination of norms account for <b>differentiated</b> <b>appropriations</b> of dietary incentives? We will first compare the overarching goals {{as well as the}} dietary norms these two programs promote, in terms of similarities versus particularities both of the recommendations’ content and of the way they are communicated. We will then examine the perception of these norms. The comparison France / Luxembourg shows that socio-cultural logics override national ones: the way in which individuals perceive the recommendations and appropriate them reflect more the social affiliation than the national one; gender and the events of the life cycle, particularly parentality, are also relevant to the reception of dietary recommendations. Transversal to all social milieus and in both national contexts, interviewees operate a selective internalisation of the perceived recommendations in a proactive yet pragmatic posture of personal responsibility. Ultimately, public dietary recommendations are only appropriated if they match people’s daily priorities and constraints, as well as the general cultural values of their social milieu. This allows us to conclude to transnational, transversal, plural and distinctive everyday-cultural models of food consumption and differing notions of a “proper” diet...|$|R

This study examined the relationship between a specific visual perceptual skill, visual discrimination (VD), and learning-to-read. The project was comprised of two components.

The potential associations among these factors and phonemic awareness, estimated verbal and nonverbal abilities, and lexical access were also considered.

40|$|We {{consider}} the Clairaut {{theory of the}} equilibrium ellipsoidal <b>figures</b> for <b>differentiated</b> non-homogeneous bodies in non-synchronous rotation adding to it a tidal deformation due {{to the presence of}} an external gravitational force. We assume that the body is a fluid formed by n homogeneous layers of ellipsoidal shape and we calculate the external polar flattenings and the mean radius of each layer, or, equivalently, their semiaxes. To first order in the flattenings, the general solution can be written as ϵ_k= H_k*ϵ_h and μ_k= H_k*μ_h, where H_k is a characteristic coefficient for each layer which only depends on the internal structure of the body and ϵ_h, μ_h are the flattenings of the equivalent homogeneous problem. For the continuous case, we study the Clairaut differential equation for the flattening profile, using the Radau transformation to find the boundary conditions when the tidal potential is added. Finally, the theory is applied to several examples: i) a body composed of two homogeneous layers; ii) bodies with simple polynomial density distribution laws and iii) bodies following a polytropic pressure-density law.

40|$|Since {{the early}} 2000 s {{nutrition}} has increasingly established itself in various European countries {{as a major}} element of public health policies. The launching at governmental level of the Programme National Nutrition Santé in France in 2001, and of the National Action Plan “Gesond iessen, méi bewegen” in Luxembourg in 2006 has generated a number of public health campaigns and the dissemination {{of a series of}} nutritional recommendations. However, while these policies were developed concomitantly in numerous European countries, the work on their institutional implementation, but also the appropriation of nutritional recommendations by individuals, has rarely been put in European comparison, even less so in the field of social sciences and sociology. Based on a mixed-methodology combining an institutional analysis of how national models and on two field surveys with in-depth interviews, this contribution will examine the political implementation and societal appropriation of nutritional recommendations in two European countries, France and Luxembourg. Based on this comparison, the paper explores the following research question: in which way – and by which social categories – are the recommendations taken in and put into practice, and if so, which appropriation processes and interpretations occur? Do the social, societal and cultural differences between Luxembourg and France (as well as within them), in terms of standard of living, cultural values and dissemination of norms, account for <b>differentiated</b> <b>appropriations</b> of dietary incentives? Which socio-cultural factors and everyday constraints favour a frontal internalisation of dietary recommendations, as opposed to a more creative appropriation or even a critical avoidance? By means of the recommendations issued in the framework of public health, we pose the more general question of how and why dietary norms are perceived and integrated by individuals. This contribution will highlight that, in France as in Luxembourg, these two nutritional policies show striking similarities in term of contents, but marked differences in their structuring and their implementation. The dissemination of recommendations is based on policies, which are received, understood and appropriated in different ways. The comparison France / Luxembourg shows that socio-cultural logics override national ones: {{the way in which the}} individuals perceive the recommendations and appropriate them reflect more the social affiliation than the national one; gender and the events of the life cycle, particularly parentality, are also relevant. The recommendations disseminated by France's PNNS and Luxembourg's GIMB primarily reach people whose dietary habits are already orientated in the ‘desired’ direction. But even those persons sort out between the information that strikes them as being more or less pertinent – they only ever appropriate a selection of the recommendations. Ultimately, it is on the basis of their priorities and personal constraints, on the one hand, as well as of the agreement between the political recommendations with the previous societal practices and values on the other, that credit is given to this or that message. In the same way, the recommendations are only appropriated (albeit, again, in a selective and pragmatic way) if they match people’s daily priorities and constraints, as well as the general cultural values of their social milieu. No matter how much cognitive effort is put into nutritional composition in everyday experience, interviewees compensate it by a personal focus on the hedonistic communicative value and community formation through eating – which always comes first in their mind. Finally, the comparison of two European countries’ political institutionalisation on the one hand, and the appropriation and the putting into practice of nutritional recommendations on the other, allows us to comprehend more general societal evolutions: namely, a globalisation of national policies and of food cultures and a differentiation of social contrasts, cutting across national frontiers – but which take on specific forms depending on the standard of living and the social structure of the societies under review. The findings revealed by this comparison between France and Luxembourg can without doubt be further extended and point to the challenges that all European societies face in the future in a context of mounting health inequalities...|$|R

30|$|This line of {{research}} highlights that the configuration of organizational factors, {{in terms of the}} alternative ways in which local governments define their public service domains, and the certain HR systems’ architecture maximize evolutionary fitness, which possibly reflects an effective outcome state (Ridder et al. 2012 a; Doty and Glick 1994).

30|$|Two {{different}} color themes {{have been used}} in the <b>figure</b> to <b>differentiate</b> the positive from negative themes. As shown in the figure, negative themes, such as “cheating” and “test anxiety,” occurred twice as much as positive themes, such as “motivation tool.” The most common themes which emerged in the short stories were “cheating,” “test anxiety,” and “motivation tool,” each occurring four times. What recurred in most of the stories was unfair assessment practices which urged students to cheat or created deliberative anxiety in them. One of the stories was about a good student who is taking a centralized exam. Even though she leaves early and takes a taxi, she arrives at the exam venue too late because the taxi driver is lost and his car breaks down. The story rightfully points out the drawback of centralized and summative assessment which can cause a great deal of anxiety and pain in the learner. The most common (4 out of 21) positive theme in the stories was related to tests spurring students to study. Although the positive theme of assessment as a motivating tool emerged from these four stories, motivation was often created in a painful and coercive manner; therefore, assessment was presented as a necessary evil in these stories which had to be practiced to discipline the student and/or to ensure that learning had taken place.|$|R

This feature has been shown to have perceptual advantages over openness or "no-hole". in this study, we investigated when and how the human brain differentiates between "hole" and "no-hole" figures. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded during a passive observation paradigm. Two pairs of simple figures (Experiment 1) and two sets of Greek letters (Experiment 2) were used as stimuli. The ERPs of "hole" and "no-hole" figures differed &# 8764; 90 ms after stimulus onset: "hole" figures elicited smaller P 1 and N 1 amplitudes than "no-hole" figures. These suggest that both P 1 and N 1 components are sensitive to the difference between "hole" and "no-hole" figures; perception of "hole" and "no-hole" <b>figures</b> might be <b>differentiated</b> early during visual processing...|$|R

As well as segmentation, the assignment of region boundaries to <b>differentiate</b> <b>figure</b> from ground is a key process whose operation can be observed in infants during the early months. Global organization of both motion and pattern information plays a role in object segmentation and integration. These two types of global processing are associated with different brain systems, have different developmental courses, and are differentially vulnerable in developmental disorders. In infancy, specific visual attributes determine the selection of a manual response (reach-and-grasp vs. surface exploration) and also the detailed kinematic parameters of each class of response. These are taken to reflect the properties of distinct visuo-motor modules whose properties emerge between 4 and 12 months of age. While these modules are a component of the dorsal cortical stream, they must interact with ventral stream processing in development and in the mature system...|$|R
40|$|An {{approach}} {{to calculate the}} weighting factors of the local criteria is considered for a decision maker (DM). As an additive, multiplicative, mini-max, non-linear, or combined convolution, these criteria {{are part of the}} integral criteria used for comparative assessment of the alternatives, their ranking, and choosing the best option. The approach is based on the method of custom arithmetic progression and on the principles of customizable assessment of criteria preference and arithmetic progression of interrelations between weight indicators of criteria. An assessment of criteria preference uses the classical method for pairwise comparison of criteria and their ranking, taking into consideration the calculated values of weight levels of these criteria. Thus, the paper discusses options both for full and for partial order of criteria priorities, whereby the same weight level of criteria is possible. In ranking all the criteria are divided into the weight groups. In the case of complete ranking each group includes only one criterion, {{in the case of a}} partial ranking the group includes the same criteria in terms of weight. In the case of customizable assessment of criteria preference a DM specifies a key <b>figure</b> to <b>differentiate</b> weighting factors of the boundary groups, i. e. a coefficient to show the superiority level of criteria weights of the most weighting group in comparison with criteria weights of the less weighting group. Thus, the criteria weighting factors of the ranked groups are members of decreasing arithmetic progression. The simple analytical expressions to calculate weighting factors of criteria that are part of the ranked series are obtained. A DM has a large set of control parameters, namely: the number of criteria, the number of criteria groups, the number of criteria in each group, the level of difference in criterion weightings of the boundary groups. These parameters allow us to conduct research activities and make recommendations on the selection of the most appropriate set of weighting factors of the local criteria. The paper gives examples to show that it is easy to use the proposed analytical expressions for calculating the weighting factors of criteria to solve practical problems. </p...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, the {{automotive}} sector requires great quality for each {{product that is}} produced, and especially regarding those pieces or parts which need to be reliable and long lasting, and that require high properties because of their use. High temperatures, high pressures or constant friction are effects that some pieces in the engine, for example, have to endure during its working life, which is of around fifteen to seventeen years. It is precisely in the automobile’s engine where pieces suffer the most aggressive effects, and therefore, where the fabrication has to be optimized to achieve its goals. Inside the engine, with its high temperatures, great movement and extenuating friction, the piston has to find a perfect measurement in roughness {{in order to avoid}} arriving to such aggressive conditions. This is done by maintaining the oil and the fuel separated but retaining the oil to a certain level to avoid excessive friction piston-cylinder. Therefore, the study of roughness regarding fabrication of these pieces is extremely important, and in addition to this, the realization of where it can be improved and where it cannot. This paper studies a way of differentiating the various frequencies of a surface profile. First, it analyses the primary surface properties to <b>figure</b> out what <b>differentiates</b> frequencies within a sample.

Optical films containing scatterer particles are used in these systems. Therefore, dielectric scatterer particles are greatly needed to be analyzed for their optical scattering properties, and especially for polarizing effects. Depending on the sizes relative to the wavelength and {{the shape of the}} particles various computation approaches have been developed based on electromagnetic scattering theories such as Mie scattering, T-matrix methods etc [...] . Simulation programs of these approaches have been examined and applied for spherical and nonspherical particles. In general, for the particles those a few times large in size compared to the incident wavelength, the polarization differentiation is insignificant for a spherical particle compared to a spheroid one. And, the prolate spheroids with higher aspect ratio have been able to produce most significant <b>differentiating</b> <b>figures.</b> Polarization measurements have been carried on commercially available dielectric optical films of two different set and also on the films with/without nonspherical zeolite particles prepared in the laboratory. Since the commercial films consist of spherical scatters, they show no polarization discrimination at all. On the other hand existence of zeolite particles in the film resulted in significant polarization discrimination at forward scattering angle. The results for polarization discrimination properties of the prolate spheroid particles have been compared with the spherical ones. Consequently, the discrepancy induced on the polarization that way has a good potential to be used in improvement of the brightness...|$|R
40|$|The Diadema {{field is}} located 40 km {{northwest}} {{of the city of}} Comodoro Rivadavia on the northern flank of the San Jorge basin, Argentina. A gas-bearing layer known as “Banco Verde ” horizon, which pertains to the Cretaceous-Tertiary Salamanca Formation, occurs among various hydrocarbon-producing horizons, at an average depth of 500 meters below surface. Gas was produced from the Banco Verde horizon approximately between 1950 and 2000. During that period of time, reservoir pressure dropped from 25 bar (initial pressure) to about 5 bars. A portion of the depleted gas reservoir was then converted for natural gas storage purposes. Gas storage operations are carried out in the so-called Repsol-YPF licensed block. Nine operation wells are used for gas injection and withdrawal. Gas is injected into the reservoir during summer using the gas pipeline pressure. Then, it is withdrawn during winter and sent back to the pipeline using compressors. Due to the presence of hydrocarbons in the aquifers occurring above the Underground Gas Storage Diadema (UGSD), geochemical and isotopic determinations were performed to determine the source and monitor the proportions of the mixture of native gas and stored gas. Original reservoir gas, gas injected into the storage facility, gas occurring in overlying aquifers (Río Chico and Patagonia Formations), and gas from oil reservoirs occurring beneath UGSD were sampled.
