40|$|The {{importance}} of electrical heating technology {{on a global}} scale is significant. Resistive heating {{is one of the many}} methods that can be used in electrical heating appliances. In direct resistive <b>heating</b> <b>electric</b> current flows directly through the charge. During <b>indirect</b> resistance <b>heating</b> <b>electric</b> current flows through the heating element, where the Joule losses (resistance losses) are arising and from them the charge is heated. In the first five chapters of the bachelor thesis are discussed various methods of heat transfer. The sixth chapter contains basic information about direct resistance heating. In the following chapters I have analyzed only indirect resistance heating. In the seventh and eighth chapters are listed and described parts of the electrical resistance furnace. In the ninth chapter is a general calculation of crucible furnace for melting aluminum followed by real calculation for crucible furnace according to the specified parameters...|$|R

25|$|Advantages of <b>electric</b> <b>heating</b> methods {{over other}} forms include {{precision}} control of temperature {{and distribution of}} heat energy, combustion not used to develop heat, {{and the ability to}} attain temperatures not readily achievable with chemical combustion. <b>Electric</b> <b>heat</b> can be accurately applied at the precise point needed in a process, at high concentration of power per unit area or volume. <b>Electric</b> <b>heating</b> devices can be built in any required size and can be located anywhere within a plant. <b>Electric</b> <b>heating</b> processes are generally clean, quiet, and do not emit much byproduct heat to the surroundings. Electrical heating equipment has a high speed of response, lending it to rapid-cycling mass-production equipment.|$|R

25|$|The {{limitations}} {{and disadvantages of}} <b>electric</b> <b>heating</b> in industry include the higher cost of electrical energy compared to direct use of fuel, and the capital cost of both the <b>electric</b> <b>heating</b> apparatus itself and the infrastructure required to deliver large quantities of electrical energy {{to the point of}} use.

In other processes, heat is produced within the workpiece by induction or dielectric losses. As well, heat can be produced then transferred to the work by conduction, convection or radiation.|$|R
30|$|Home heating {{is usually}} {{accomplished}} {{with a single}} furnace. These will either heat air and force it through ducts, or heat water and pump it through pipes and radiators. Furnaces can be fueled with natural gas, furnace oil, or <b>electric</b> <b>heat.</b> <b>Electric</b> <b>heat</b> can also be delivered by electric resistance heaters located in each room of the home. This study employs a 100 % efficiency for all <b>electric</b> <b>heating</b> systems regardless of type. Natural gas furnaces are modelled to be 96 % efficient, better than the 90 % used in the National Energy Use Database [44]. Oil-fired furnaces are given an efficiency rating of 80 %, which is slightly higher than the 78 % average seen in NRCan and Statistics Canada data sets [44].|$|R

5000|$|In {{common with}} {{other forms of}} direct <b>electric</b> <b>heating,</b> storage heaters are not {{necessarily}} environmentally friendly because the source of electricity may be generated using fossil fuels, with up to two-thirds {{of energy in the}} fuel lost at the power station and in transmission losses. In Sweden the use of direct <b>electric</b> <b>heating</b> has been restricted since the 1980s for this reason, and there are plans to phase it out entirely - see Oil phase-out in Sweden - while Denmark and Germany have banned the installation of <b>electric</b> space <b>heating</b> in new buildings for similar reasons (though in Germany the ban was lifted in 2013).|$|R

2500|$|<b>Electric</b> <b>heating</b> is {{a process}} in which {{electrical}} energy is converted to heat. Common applications include space heating, cooking, water heating and industrial processes. An electric heater is an electrical device that converts <b>electric</b> current to <b>heat.</b> The heating element inside every electric heater is an electrical resistor, and works on the principle of Joule heating: an electric current passing through a resistor will convert that electrical energy into heat energy. Most modern <b>electric</b> <b>heating</b> devices use nichrome wire as the active element; the heating element, depicted on the right, [...] uses nichrome wire supported by ceramic insulators.|$|R
