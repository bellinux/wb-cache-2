30|$|The payload assumed {{for each}} flight could be {{calculated}} based on the aircraft’s maximum payload multiplied by a flight’s weight load factor. While flight schedules contain <b>information</b> on <b>payload</b> <b>capacity</b> available on each flight, actual passenger numbers and the (total) payload transported had to be estimated. For this purpose, each flight in the schedules was supplemented by load factor data from different sources. The sources used to determine both seat load factors and overall weight load factors include the ICAO Traffic by Flight Stage databank and ICAO’s Air Carrier statistics [19]. By combining such data with the available seats and <b>payload</b> <b>capacities</b> from the schedules, an estimation of the relevant transport performance for the years 2004 – 2008 could be provided.|$|R
30|$|In {{the digital}} era, {{copyright}} protection of multimedia data (e.g., images, audios, and videos) {{is an important}} issue for content owners and service providers. Digital watermarking technology has received considerable attention owing to its potential application to the protection of intellectual property rights, content authentication, fingerprinting, and covert communications. Watermarking technology generally takes four factors (i.e., imperceptibility, security, robustness, and capacity) into consideration [1, 2]. An ideal watermarking algorithm minimizes perceptual distortion due to signal alteration while embedding a sufficient quantity of information within a host signal to ensure resistance against malicious attacks. The fact that the requirements of capacity, robustness, and imperceptibility are contradictory necessitates a tradeoff in the design of various watermarking schemes. For example, medical information systems are primarily intended to provide security and ensure the integrity of <b>information,</b> whereas <b>payload</b> <b>capacity</b> is of paramount importance in air traffic control systems. The annotation watermarking of music products emphasizes imperceptibility and robustness.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{demonstrated}} {{the feasibility of}} embedding unperceivable code sequence by modulating dot gains through laser intensity modulation for halftone images. From a communication systems point of view, a printer and a document scanner form the physical layer of a communication channel, where information can be hidden in halftone images and reliably transmitted and extracted. In the proposed approach, we will leverage our previous results in embedding unperceivable banding signals to halftone images and develop an integrated embedding and detection algorithm to embed and extract <b>information</b> with high <b>payload</b> <b>capacity.</b> Specifically, we will characterize the embedding capacity and detection rate associated with the proposed algorithm. Preliminary experimental results will be presented...|$|R
