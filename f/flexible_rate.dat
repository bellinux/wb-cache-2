40|$|The paper {{reviews the}} extent to which a decade of {{analysis}} and experience has altered thinking about the choice of an exchange rate system. The advantages of <b>flexible</b> <b>rates</b> are viewed to have been exaggerated. They do not permit governments to have permanently higher rates of economic activity at the expense of higher inflation as some thought. Further, the slow speed of adjustment to relative price changes limits the contribution of <b>flexible</b> <b>rates</b> to external adjustment in the short-run, and the degree of insulation from external influences that they provide. Finally, <b>flexible</b> <b>rates</b> tend to be fluctuating rates, and, although there is little empirical evidence so far showing that the fluctuations have had adverse effects on trade and capital flows, the exchange rate instability more than any other factor has led to a certain disillusionment with the floating rate system. Notwithstanding the drawbacks of <b>flexible</b> <b>rates,</b> there will be a continuing need for exchange rate flexibility over the next few years, and some analysis is given of the problems of achieving greater stability under <b>flexible</b> <b>rates</b> or the requisite amount of flexibility under pegged rates. ...|$|R
40|$|I {{evaluate}} {{the response of}} an economy to adverse shocks under fixed and <b>flexible</b> exchange <b>rate</b> regimes in a center-periphery model focusing on financial distress and trade links across countries. I find that under fixed rates, since the central bank is forced {{to raise interest rates}} to defend the peg, shocks to the economy have strong real effects. Under <b>flexible</b> <b>rates,</b> on the contrary, the central bank can mitigate the effects of the shocks by adopting a counter-cyclical monetary policy that stabilizes asset prices and firms’ balance sheets. Moreover, fixed rates amplify the impact of financial accelerator effects on the real economy. I show that <b>flexible</b> <b>rates</b> outperform fixed rates even when debt is denominated in foreign currency. To analyze the role of trade links, I then consider the case where the two periphery countries have different exchange rate regimes {{at the time of the}} shock. I find that the country on <b>flexible</b> <b>rates,</b> aside from reducing financial distress, has a competitive advantage in the center market. However, the timing of the devaluation is essential. In the event of an initial defense of the exchange rate peg, the country sacrifices most of the beneficial effects of <b>flexible</b> <b>rates.</b> Furthermore, the longer the defense before the abandonment, the larger the financial distress...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} the {{conventional}} wisdom has held that fixed rates provide more fiscal discipline than do <b>flexible</b> <b>rates.</b> In this paper we show that this wisdom need not hold in a standard model in which fiscal policy is endogenously determined by a maximizing fiscal authority. The claim that fixed rates induce more discipline stresses that sustained adoption of lax fiscal policies must eventually lead to an exhaustion of reserves and thus to a politically costly collapse of the peg. Hence, under fixed rates bad behavior today leads to punishment tomorrow. Under <b>flexible</b> <b>rates</b> bad behavior has costs as well. The difference is in the intertemporal distribution of these costs: <b>flexible</b> <b>rates</b> allow the effects of unsound fiscal policies to manifest themselves immediately through movements in the exchange rate. Hence, bad behavior today leads to punishment today. If fiscal authorities are impatient, <b>flexible</b> <b>rates</b> - by forcing the costs to be paid up-front - provide more fiscal discipline and higher welfare for the representative private agent. The recent experience of Sub- Saharan countries supplies some preliminary evidence that matches the predictions of the model. ...|$|R

First, our microstructural model provides a qualitatively new explanation for the puzzle. Second, we test implications of our model using Europe's recent shift to rigidly fixed rates (EMS to EMU). In the model, shocks to order flow induce volatility under <b>flexible</b> <b>rates</b> because they have portfolio-balance effects on price, whereas under fixed rates the same shocks do not have portfolio-balance effects. These effects arise in one regime {{and not the other}} because the elasticity of speculative demand for foreign exchange is (endogenously) regime-dependent: low elasticity under <b>flexible</b> <b>rates</b> magnifies portfolio-balance effects; under credibly fixed rates, elasticity of speculative demand is infinite, eliminating portfolio-balance effects.
