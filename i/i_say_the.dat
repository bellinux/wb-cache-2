The administrators had {{numerous}} opportunities {{to reach a}} compromise but displayed {{little interest in the}} welfare of the players. It wasn't really surprising then that more than 50 players from around the world signed lucrative WSC contracts and a revolution was born. About half of the WSC players were from Australia and this high ratio can, in part, be attributed to Bradman's tight-fisted approach to the ACB's money.|$|E

500|$|Both {{newspapers}} {{went into}} gradual decline under their new proprietors. James Gordon Bennett, Jr.—"a swaggering, precociously dissolute lout who rarely stifled an impulse"—had a mercurial reign. He launched the New York Telegram, an evening paper, {{in the late}} 1860s and kept the Herald the most comprehensive source of news among the city's newspapers. [...] Bennett also bankrolled Henry Morton Stanley's trek through Africa to find David Livingstone, and scooped the competition on the Battle of Little Big Horn. However, Bennett ruled his paper with a heavy hand, telling his executives {{at one point that}} he was the [...] "only reader of this paper": [...] "I am the only one to be pleased. [...] If I want it turned upside down, it must be turned upside down. [...] I want one feature article a day. If <b>I</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> feature is black beetles, black beetles it's going to be." [...] In 1874, the Herald ran the infamous New York Zoo hoax, where {{the front page of the}} newspaper was devoted entirely to fabricated story of animals getting loose at the Central Park Zoo.|$|E

[...] This is a {{reference}} to Ralph Macchio, an actor who appeared in the 1983 drama film The Outsiders, which also starred Rob Lowe. The line was improvised by actor Chris Pratt. In another scene, Ben tells Leslie the song he played after getting sworn in as an 18-year-old mayor was [...] "Whoomp! (There It Is)", a 1993 hip hop song by the duo Tag Team. The episode features several quotes from author and outdoorsman Jack London. Among them, which Leslie reads from her master plan proposal, is, [...] "You can't wait for inspiration. You have to go after it with a club," [...] and [...] "So <b>I</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> function of man is to live, not to exist. I would rather that my spark should burn out in a brilliant blaze than it should be stifled by dry-rot." [...] The original script included about one dozen different London quotes, but most were cut from the final draft. [...] Schur said he used London quotes because he believed the author was one both Leslie and Ron would admire. At {{one point in the}} episode, while discussing April's birthday, Leslie says, [...] "Damn the wheel of the world! Why must it continually turn over?" [...] to which Ron replied approvingly, [...] "Jack London." [...] The line was improvised by actor Nick Offerman.|$|E

[...] That same week, he wrote to Bernard, [...] "A starry sky is something I should {{like to try to}} do, just as in the daytime I am going to try to paint a green meadow spangled with dandelions."

2500|$|Ramadan denies {{contacts}} with terrorists or other Islamic fundamentalists and {{the charges of}} anti-Semitism and double talk, attributing the charges to misinterpretation and an unfamiliarity with his writings. He stated: [...] "I have often been accused of this 'double discourse', and {{to those who say}} it, I say – bring the evidence. I am quite clear in what <b>I</b> <b>say.</b> <b>The</b> problem is that many people don't want to hear it, particularly in the media. Most of the stories about me are completely untrue: journalists simply repeat black propaganda from the internet without any corroboration, and it just confirms what they want to believe. Words are used out of context. There is double-talk, yes, but there is also double-hearing. That is what I want to challenge." [...] In answer to criticism of his response to 11 September, Ramadan replied that two days after the attacks he had published an open letter, exhorting Muslims to condemn the attacks and the attackers, and not to [...] "hide behind conspiracy theories."
