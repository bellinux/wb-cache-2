2500|$|Studd {{continued}} from Eton to Trinity College, Cambridge, {{where he}} graduated in 1883. In 1884 after his brother George was taken seriously ill Charles was confronted by the question, [...] "What is all the fame and flattery worth ... when a man comes to face eternity?" [...] <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> that since his conversion six years earlier {{he had been in}} [...] "an unhappy backslidden state". As a result of the experience he said, [...] "I know that cricket would not last, and honour would not last, and nothing in this world would last, but it was worthwhile living for the world to come." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many of Aderca's {{political}} articles, {{including some}} of his earliest, display his rejection of antisemitism. In his Lumea de mâine interview, Aderca spoke at length of his main stylistic themes, recognizing [...] "revolt" [...] as the main subject of his books. He defined this in relation to social alienation and antisemitic prejudice, referring to himself in the third person: Throughout his life [...] was chased around [...] by a gang of vigilantes in cahoots with executioners, who sought to end his life. What injustice had he or his ancestors committed, that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> and repent for? A mystery. To which supreme command and to what sort of ineffable order would his elimination from this luminous world have been an answer? A mystery. And that this physical and moral assassination {{could not have been}} effected yet—therein lies the deepest mystery, the strange and awesome wonder of each day's morning.|$|E
60|$|She {{gave him}} a {{penetrating}} glance, and <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit,</b> inwardly, that a certain satisfaction followed Miss Grower's approval.|$|E
50|$|Juri {{was pretty}} {{active in the}} first week or two when Avara was released, but <b>had</b> <b>to</b> switch to a new ISP (for reasons {{unrelated}} to Avara) at about that time. Unfortunately the connections from that ISP were totally inadequate for Avara, so he couldn't play anymore. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit,</b> however, that after two years of playing the game every single day, he was pretty tired of it too.|$|R
50|$|After {{the winding}} up, Desai vehemently defended his action in Parliament. <b>He,</b> however, <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> {{later that the}} reasons earlier stated were not correct.|$|R
5000|$|Rosmira, {{still in}} {{disguise}} as [...] "Eurimene",tells Queen Partenope that [...] "he" [...] challenged Arsace to a duel because [...] "he" [...] {{was sent by}} Princess Rosmira to avenge her honour on the man who promised to marry her but jilted her at the altar. The horrified Partenope asks Arsace {{if this is true}} and <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> it is. Partenope declares she will <b>have</b> nothing more <b>to</b> do with him; Armindo is looking better and better to her as prospective husband.|$|R
60|$|They {{talked of}} ways and means, and <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> {{that he had}} little money. But the new book would bring in a good deal, David supposed.|$|E
60|$|She told Matthew {{the story}} the next morning. Matthew was confounded and puzzled; he could not so quickly lose faith in Anne but <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> that {{circumstances}} were against her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps I will," [...] murmured Dick. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> {{to himself}} that Minnie was very cordial {{and that she was}} by no means bad looking. He did not wonder why Flockley and Koswell were so anxious to call upon her.|$|E
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>admitted</b> <b>to</b> using {{playing tennis}} as a {{networking}} tool.|$|R
50|$|The plot {{involved}} {{a young man}} (Minoru Takada) who turns down a receptionist job after graduating college because he feels it isn't good enough for him, but needs to fool his mother (Utako Suzuki) and fiancee (Tanaka) into thinking <b>he</b> <b>has</b> a job. After he marries the financee <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>to</b> her that he is unemployed so she takes {{a job in a}} bar. After an argument with her he apologizes for being irresponsible. He goes back to the company he turned down to accept the receptionist job, but they give him a salaried position instead.|$|R
25|$|The usual source {{which is}} quoted in this instance, is Melis Stoke, a chronicler {{in the service}} of count Floris V of Holland, but {{although}} he tries to back up the Hollandic claims on the Frisian territories, he lacks sound arguments. He suspects the counts of Holland obtained their rights as heirs to one Gerolf, Count in Friesland (the operative word here being in), who had been count of Holland during the Franconian period, which was at that time a part of Greater Frisia, but even there <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> it is only as suspicion.|$|R
60|$|He {{assured her}} that the birds {{would love to have}} her, though I am not so certain of it myself. Also that there were very few birds in winter. 'Of course they might want your clothes,' <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> rather falteringly.|$|E
6000|$|It was true, but {{he would}} have {{preferred}} not to answer. Grizel's questions, however, were all so straight in the face, that there was no dodging them. [...] "I have on twa suits o' clothes, and a' my sarks," [...] <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit,</b> sticky and sullen.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dick {{has friends}} who would {{carefully}} investigate matters if <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> his debts, {{and they might}} find out enough to cause us trouble. Then, we're engaged in another business of first importance that can't be neglected while we make plans for our private benefit. If we fail, the consequences would be unpleasant--to say the least." ...|$|E
50|$|Genius - Genius is Captain Biceps {{faithful}} sidekick. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> a fine {{sense of}} organization: He prepares their missions like nobody else {{and he knows}} exactly what’s going on. But his rather school- like answers to the problem are never quite as efficient as those of his boss. Genius Boy is both appalled by his boss’s stupidity and always mystified by his unorthodox methods, which <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit,</b> are pretty darn efficient. Even though he never reaps the recognition he deserves (Captain Biceps will never ever admit that his sidekick might be smart {{have come up with}} a good idea), Genius Boy remains Captain Biceps’ faithful and devoted assistant.|$|R
25|$|Friedman {{spent much}} of his free time trying to {{decipher}} the famous Voynich Manuscript, written sometime between 1403–1437. However, after four decades of study <b>he</b> finally <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> defeat, contributing no more than an educated guess as to its origins and meaning.|$|R
25|$|<b>He</b> <b>had</b> been <b>admitted</b> <b>to</b> {{hospital}} under a false name, {{and with}} a fictitious complaint.|$|R
60|$|He {{had never}} {{expected}} to feel grateful to the little firebrand who employed him, but <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> that the millionaire, in their late conversation, had shown forethought. The thought struck him that but for Mr. Peters' advice he might by now be in an extremely awkward position; for his was not a swiftly inventive mind.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Campbell had none. In fact, {{after about}} twenty minutes of cross-examination, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> that he had given but little thought to the {{interview}} with the lady at the time, and certainly not {{in connection with the}} murder of Lady Donaldson, until he had read in the papers that a young lady had been arrested.|$|E
6000|$|... "I asked Sergeant O'Donnell {{particularly}} about that, and even <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> {{that there was}} no evidence whatever to implicate the girl or show that the relations between her and Mr. Torrance had been anything that was not right; and you know yourself how anxious O'Donnell has been to dig up evidence of any kind derogatory to either of them." ...|$|E
500|$|Danny Boyle, the film's director, {{speaking}} on the creative liberties he took with portraying Steve Jobs said, [...] " [...] was what Shakespeare used to do. He would {{take some of the}} facts about a man of power and he would guess at a lot of the rest and just gotten away at actually getting at the human in it. And that's what's wonderful about the writing I think, is that it acknowledges the people who disliked Steve Jobs, the people he hurt. But in the end, he brings it back to a very simple father-daughter relationship that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> made {{some of the most beautiful}} things in the world." ...|$|R
50|$|Park {{is known}} to be a {{collector}} of shoes, particularly sneakers. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>admitted</b> <b>to</b> owning more than 1800 pairs of footwear.|$|R
60|$|Brought to bay in this fashion, <b>he</b> would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> read 'The Pied Piper of Hamelin', {{and not a}} {{syllable}} more, and Miss Beezley {{would look}} {{at him for a}} moment and sigh softly. The Babe's subsequent share in the conversation, provided the Dragon made no further onslaught, was not large.|$|R
60|$|When Eric betook {{himself to}} the orchard the next evening <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> that he felt rather nervous. He {{did not know how}} the Gordons would receive him and {{certainly}} the reports he had heard of them were not encouraging, to say the least of it. Even Mrs. Williamson, when he had told her where he was going, seemed to look upon him as one bent on bearding a lion in his den.|$|E
60|$|When she {{had passed}} him he again studied her back, swiftly and covertly. No, sir. No {{question}} about it. It couldn't be denied by any one {{now that the}} girl was a freak, for, charitable though Our Mr. Wrenn was, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> {{that there was no}} sign of the midback ridge and little rounded knobbinesses of corseted respectability. And he had a closer view of the texture of her sage-green crash gown.|$|E
60|$|Month {{by month}} the Fair Emily crept down south. The Great Bear and other constellations {{gave way to}} the stars of the {{southern}} skies, and Mr. Chalk tried hard not to feel disappointed with the arrangement of those in the Southern Cross. Pressed by the triumphant Brisket, to whom he voiced his views, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> that it was at least as much like a cross as the other was a bear.|$|E
50|$|Brown was {{released}} by the Giants on October 25, 2016, after it was made public that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>admitted</b> <b>to</b> abusing his wife.|$|R

2500|$|White drew {{similarly}} in Parr–Farrand, England 1971. From {{the diagram}} at above right, play continued 1.Rd5 Bf6 2.Rxf5! On 2...gxf5 3.Kf4, White's king will capture Black's f-pawn, then retreat to h1, reaching a bishop and opposite-colored [...] draw. Instead, Black tried 2...Ke7 3.Rb5 Ke6, [...] "but <b>he</b> soon <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> that the draw was inevitable." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> {{that she}} was better able to care for herself in the {{wilderness}} than most men--even Western men--and though {{he had not yet}} witnessed a display of her skill with a rifle, he was ready to believe that she could shoot as well as her sire. Nevertheless, he liked her better when engaged in purely feminine duties, and he led the talk back to subjects concerning which her speech was less blunt and manlike.|$|E
6000|$|This {{was one of}} {{them and}} Tommy knew it. [...] "Wait till you see the west town end," [...] he said bravely; [...] "it's grand." [...] But when they were in the west town end, and <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> it, [...] "Wait till you see the square," [...] he said, and when they were in the square, [...] "Wait," [...] he said, huskily, [...] "till you see the town-house." [...] Alas, this was the town-house facing them, and when they knew it, he said hurriedly, [...] "Wait till you see the Auld Licht Kirk." ...|$|E
6000|$|Here Uncle Chris {{paused in}} order to devote {{a couple of seconds}} to thought. He had said it was [...] "like this," [...] and he gave his {{moustache}} another pull as though he were trying to drag inspiration out of it. His blue eyes were as frank and honest as ever, and showed no trace of the perplexity in his mind, but <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> to himself that, if he managed to satisfy his hearer that all was for the best and that he had acted uprightly and without blame, he would be doing well.|$|E
