50|$|The Plate tectonic theory {{indicates}} Australia {{has moved}} northwards {{at a rate}} of 7 cm per year, starting during the Cenozoic. Eastern Australia experienced a period of tectonic uplift, which moved the drainage divide in Queensland 400 km inland. Also during this time, Queensland experienced volcanic eruptions leading to central and shield volcanoes and basalt flows. Some of these became high islands. After the Coral Sea Basin formed, coral reefs began to grow in the Basin, but until about 25 million years ago, northern Queensland was still in temperate waters south of the tropics—too cool to support coral growth. The <b>Great</b> <b>Barrier</b> <b>Reef's</b> development history is complex; after Queensland drifted into tropical waters, it was largely influenced by reef growth and decline as sea level changed.|$|R

In this work, microfacies, depositional environment, and diagenetic processes affected the Mauddud member in a field in the Persian Gulf are investigated. Based on the studies of available cores and thin sections of 3 wells, five types of microfacies, namely MF 1 to MF 5, have been identified in the Mauddud member. These microfacies have been deposited in 2 facies belt including a vast lagoon and local bioclastic shoal. Based on the lack of <b>great</b> <b>barrier</b> <b>reefs</b> and calciturbidities and gradual change of microfacies into each other, it is concluded that the Mauddud member was deposited on a shallow marine homoclinal ramp. Several diagenetic processes such as bioturbation, micritization, dissolution, cementation, dolomitizetion, and compaction have influenced this member. Among all, dissolution increased porosity and thereby reservoir quality, while cementation and compaction decreased reservoir characteristics. Finally, it was found out that matrix porosity was the main type of porosity in the studied interval...|$|R

40|$|The {{state and}} {{trend of the}} <b>Great</b> <b>Barrier</b> <b>Reef’s</b> (GBR) {{ecological}} health remains problematic, resulting in the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) raising concerns regarding GBR governance (UNESCO, 2015). While UNESCO’s concerns triggered separate strategic assessments by the Australian and Queensland governments, independent and integrated review of the key risks within the overall system of governance influencing GBR outcomes is needed.

5|$|Spawning is {{generally}} driven by environmental {{factors such as}} changes in the water temperature, and their release is triggered by lighting conditions such as sunrise, sunset or the phase of the moon.

This route was comparatively well mapped – the first part largely mirroring that of James Cook in his first voyage in the Pacific from 1768 to 1771, and the remainder from Batavia being the traditional route of Dutch East Indiamen returning to Europe.

40|$|An unstructured-mesh, finite element, depth-integrated {{model of}} the hydrodynamics of the whole <b>Great</b> <b>Barrier</b> <b>Barrier</b> <b>Reef</b> (GBR), Australia, has been {{developed}} and implemented on a parallel computer.

This enables our model to simulate motions characterized by a wide range of space and time scales. Large scale currents, i. e. the tides, the wind-induced circulation and the bifurcation of the East Australian Current, are reproduced with an accuracy that is comparable to that achieved by today’s large-scale models of the GBR. The model is also successful at representing small-scale processes, such as tidal jets, their instabilities, as well as the eddies developing in the wake of islands and headlands.

40|$|Seagrass are {{sensitive}} to environmental changes and can be monitored to detect human influences to coastal ecosystems. Measurable changes in seagrass abundance, distribution and condition provide resource managers with advance signs of deteriorating ecological conditions caused by poor water quality. For this reason, seagrasses are considered biological sentinels. The <b>Great</b> <b>Barrier</b> <b>Reef's</b> (GBR) inshore seagrasses are being monitored {{as part of the}} Reef Rescue Marine Monitoring Programme (MMP). Information from the program is being used to assess the long-term effectiveness of management actions in reversing decline in water quality of the GBR Marine Park. Since 2005, inshore seagrasses have been monitored across the six Natural Resource Management regions (NRMs) adjacent to the GBR World Heritage Area, south of Cooktown. Inshore seagrasses are currently monitored subregionally (habitats) at 30 sites using Seagrass-Watch as the basis. Results from the monitoring report annually on seagrass status and are incorporated into a report card for the health of the GBR. Seagrass community status is assessed using measures of seagrass abundance and reproductive effort, while epiphyte abundance and seagrass leaf tissue C:N:P elemental ratios (atomic) indicate the WQ environment. Modifiers such as edge mapping, in situ canopy temperature and in situ light are also used to interpret the data. The environmental status indicates progressive degraded water quality where plants were growing in low light environments, with relatively large phosphorus pool and excessive nitrogen pool. Further refinement of the indicators will enable greater use of these metrics for water quality management of the GBR...|$|R

40|$|The {{state and}} {{trend of the}} <b>Great</b> <b>Barrier</b> <b>Reef’s</b> (GBR’s) {{ecological}} health remains problematic, influencing United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) statements regarding GBR governance. While UNESCO’s concerns triggered separate strategic assessments by the Australian and Queensland governments, {{there has been no}} independent and integrated review of the key risks within the overall system of governance influencing GBR outcomes. As a case study of international significance, this paper applies Governance Systems Analysis (GSA), a novel analytical framework that identifies the governance themes, domains and subdomains most likely to influence environmental and socio-economic outcomes in complex natural systems. This GBR-focussed application of GSA identifies governance subdomains that present high, medium, or low risk of failure to produce positive outcomes for the Reef. This enabled us to determine that three “whole of system” governance problems could undermine GBR outcomes. First, we stress the integrative importance of the Long Term Sustainability Plan (LTSP) Subdomain. Sponsored by the Australian and Queensland governments, this subdomain concerns the primary institutional arrangements for coordinated GBR planning and delivery, but due to its recent emergence, it faces several internal governance challenges. Second, we find a major risk of implementation failure in the achievement of GBR water quality actions {{due to a lack of}} system-wide focus on building strong and stable delivery systems at catchment scale. Finally, we conclude that the LTSP subdomain currently has too limited a mandate/capacity to influence several high-risk subdomains that have not been, but must be more strongly aligned with Reef management (e. g. the Greenhouse Gas Emission Management Subdomain). Our analysis enables exploration of governance system reforms needed to address environmental trends in the GBR and reflects on the potential application of GSA in other complex land and sea-scapes across the globe...|$|R
