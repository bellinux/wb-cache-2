50|$|In the 1970s the {{northern}} building was rented by Andronicos Stylianou who operated a successful barber shop from the premises for thirty years. At {{the time he}} was to move in the owners were required by the Cairns City Council to replace a timber stud frame wall with <b>horizontal</b> <b>boarding.</b> This wall had windows which were removed at the same time. This was replaced with cement block wall with window openings and louvres in the block wall with metal frames. At the time, the roof ceiling was supported and the corrugated roof replaced. While he built an internal wall to assist business operations, this was later removed after he had left.|$|E
50|$|The house {{originally}} {{had a single}} room underneath a gable roof {{on either side of}} the breezeway, but as Snow prospered, rooms were added on either side underneath a shed roof. Enclosed stairways lead from the central rooms to the upper floor. The open central breezeway was eventually enclosed and the exterior covered in clapboard. The rearmost portion of the dogtrot was left open, forming a recessed porch. The main entrance consists of a double-leaf door with simple sidelights and transom. The interior log walls are covered with <b>horizontal</b> <b>boarding</b> and a chair rail and baseboard. The house also features primitive Federal fireplace mantels. In the 1960s, the entry was replaced with a modern stoop.|$|E
50|$|The landsh√∂vdingehus {{built around}} 1880-1890 {{attempted}} {{to imitate the}} more high-status stone houses. They used <b>horizontal</b> <b>board</b> panelling and rich profiling. Often they were decorated with bay or dormer windows, corner towers and/or rustication of the brick wall.|$|R
50|$|Orthogonal midplanes connect {{vertical}} {{cards on}} one side to <b>horizontal</b> <b>boards</b> on the other side.One common orthogonal midplane connects many vertical telephone line cards {{on one side}}, each one connected to copper telephone wires, to a horizontal communications card on the other side.|$|R
5000|$|A [...] "virtual midplane" [...] is an {{imaginary}} plane between vertical cards {{on one side}} that directly connect to <b>horizontal</b> <b>boards</b> on the other side; the card-slot aligners of the card cage and self-aligning connectors on the cards hold the cards in position.|$|R
50|$|The side {{elevations}} are of {{a similar}} design, with the south side having a single-storeyed skillion-roofed awning over a promenade or verandah. The walls comprise 9 bays, which reflect the internal layout of the building, with the bay at the western end for the 2 storey entrance/store/bio-box area, 7 bays to the auditorium, and 1 bay at the eastern end for the stage area. The walls are constructed of timber framing. There are 7 external concrete buttresses along each wall, between which there are 5 pairs of timber bi-fold doors with skylight over. On either side, beneath the roof line, there are 7 high level panels of later metal vertical louvres providing cross-ventilation to the auditorium, with remnant panels of timber lattice above, which have been sheeted {{from the inside of}} the auditorium. Above the doors on the north side there is <b>horizontal</b> <b>boarding</b> (chamfers). On the south side, beneath the verandah awning, there is exposed stud framing above the doors. The verandah has a store at the western end, is open for the length of the auditorium and has toilets at the eastern end. The walls to the stage area are clad in <b>horizontal</b> <b>boarding.</b> The rear (eastern) elevation is of timber framing clad in vertical sheets of corrugated iron. There are 2 windows at the northern end of this rear wall, one {{to the rear of the}} stage and another to a supper room located beneath the stage. There is also a fire-escape door to the sub-floor supper room. There is a modern lean-to extension at the southern end of the rear wall, clad in vertical metal sheeting, containing changing rooms.|$|E
50|$|During {{the time}} of their {{management}} extensive alterations were carried out on the residence. Local Warwick architects, Wallace and Gibson undertook extensions of the house in 1898-1899. The architects, a partnership of William Wallace and Richard Gibson, designed many buildings in and around Warwick including St George's Masonic Hall and the Barnes & Co department store in Palmerin Street. The extensions at Canning Downs comprised the addition of timber wings abutting either side of the principal residence. Both of which were rectangular planned with hipped corrugated iron roofs and discrete verandah awnings on the front and side elevations. The wings were timber framed and clad with chamfered <b>horizontal</b> <b>boarding,</b> with decorative timber features including cross-braced balustrading and fretwork column brackets.|$|E
50|$|Internally, the {{residence}} {{has a large}} living area facing the southeast and northeast verandahs, with two bedrooms to the southwest and two bedrooms to the northwest. Ceilings and walls are unpainted, and the original attic space has been closed and the access stair removed. The ceiling of the living space has been altered and now consists of plywood sheeting with timber battens, and some internal walls may have been altered and partially re-lined. Door heads are not of a uniform height, and the main bedroom has French doors opening from the central hallway, also suggesting some alteration to internal walls. The exterior walls have wide <b>horizontal</b> <b>boarding,</b> and the internal walls have vertical boarding. The bedroom ceilings vary, with some comprising raked cornices with joists supporting floorboards for the attic above, and others finished with timber boarding.|$|E
50|$|The {{house is}} {{constructed}} from concrete block with <b>horizontal</b> <b>board</b> and batten siding.

It has a {{continuous}} brick foundation that is 5-6 feet above grade, and features a distinctive cross shape design motif; heart pine, simple drop, <b>horizontal</b> <b>board</b> siding; and a deck hipped roof covered with asbestos tile.|$|R
40|$|Thalli of four saxicolous lichens on slate rock {{fragments}} were transplanted {{from rock}} surafces to <b>horizontal</b> <b>boards</b> {{and then to}} south-east-facing and north-west-facing rock surfaces. The radial growth rate of Physcia orbicularis and Parmelia conspersa thalli declined after transplatation to north-west-facing rock surfaces and was unchanged after transplantation to south-east-facing rock surfaces cmpared with growth rates on the boards. The radial growth rate of P. glabratula ssp. fuliginosa thalli declined after transplantation to south-east-facing rock surfaces and was unchanged after transplantation to north-west-facing rock surfaces compared with grwoth rate on the boards. The radial growth rate of P. saxatilis thalli was similar on the <b>horizontal</b> <b>boards,</b> south-east-facing and north-west-facing rock surfaces. These results are dsicussed {{in relation to the}} aspect distribution of the four lichens in South Gwynedd, Wales...|$|R
