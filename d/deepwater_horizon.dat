5|$|June 30, 2010– Tropical Storm Alex {{passes through}} the area {{affected}} by the <b>Deepwater</b> <b>Horizon</b> oil spill, causing tarballs from the spill as large as apples to wash onshore portions of the panhandle from high storm tides created by the storm.|$|E
5|$|Following the April 2010 {{destruction}} of the <b>Deepwater</b> <b>Horizon</b> while drilling the Macondo well, and the resulting oil spill, all appraisal activities at 33 wells under exploration in the Gulf of Mexico, including Tiber, were placed on hold. At least two rigs that might otherwise {{have been used for}} developing Tiber are also in use on the relief wells for the ruptured well.|$|E
5|$|Hydrocarbon {{exploration}} {{in deep water}} occasionally results in significant environmental degradation resulting mainly from accumulation of contaminated drill cuttings, but also from oil spills. While the oil gusher involved in the <b>Deepwater</b> <b>Horizon</b> oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico originates from a wellhead only 1500meters below the ocean surface, it nevertheless illustrates the kind of environmental disaster that can result from mishaps related to offshore drilling for oil and gas.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} of a two-part {{interview}} with The Wall Street Journal, Grisham claimed that although he usually attempts to include humor in his submitted drafts, it is usually removed during the editorial process. However, in this case much of the humor survived editing. In {{the second part of the}} interview the following week, Grisham noted that his inspirations for the book included television advertisements and the <b>Deepwater</b> <b>Horizon</b> oil spill.|$|E
5|$|The school {{operates}} the F.G. Walton Smith research vessel. Designed to met the school's specifications, the catamaran {{was put on}} water in 2000. It {{is equipped with a}} special sea water flow system that can take samples. The on-board lab can perform chemical analysis of those water samples. It also has transducers for measuring ocean currents, sub-bottom profiling, and deep water bathymetry. In response to the <b>Deepwater</b> <b>Horizon</b> oil spill, the vessel was reassigned to environmental monitoring of affected areas and to track underwater plumes of oil.|$|E
5|$|The {{storm was}} {{expected}} to impact operations regarding the <b>Deepwater</b> <b>Horizon</b> Oil Spill, with both containment and cleanup operations being affected by repercussions from the storm (such as wave action and wind direction). Although Alex stayed relatively away from the site, the storm caused BP to delay plans to increase oil capture from the leak by a week. Tarballs from the spill as large as apples washed onshore around Grand Isle, {{as well as other}} parts of Louisiana, Alabama and Florida, from high storm tides created by the hurricane.|$|E
5|$|As waterbirds {{that feed}} on fish, {{pelicans}} are highly susceptible to oil spills, both directly by being oiled {{and by the}} impact on their food resources. A 2007 report to the California Fish and Game Commission estimated that, during the previous 20 years, some 500–1000 brown pelicans had been affected by oil spills in California. A 2011 report by the Center for Biological Diversity, {{a year after the}} April 2010 <b>Deepwater</b> <b>Horizon</b> oil spill, said that 932 brown pelicans had been collected after being affected by oiling and estimated that ten times that number had been harmed {{as a result of the}} spill.|$|E
5|$|Fluor {{built the}} Aladdin Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas in 2001 for $1.4 billion. In 2004, {{the company was}} awarded a $1.1 billion project with AMEC to help rebuild the water, power and civic {{infrastructure}} of Iraq after the Iraq War. Fluor has also built a rail line in Europe and missile sites in Arizona. The company provided disaster recovery services in Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina. In 2010 Fluor provided workers to clean up oil tar on beaches in Florida and Alabama after the <b>Deepwater</b> <b>Horizon</b> oil spill. In December 2012, Fluor was awarded a $3.14 billion contract {{to build a new}} Tappan Zee Bridge over the Hudson River.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Depression Five was an Atlantic {{tropical}} cyclone {{that lasted for}} 12hours, although its remnants persisted for almost another week. Its precursor was from a non-tropical trough east of Florida, and on August10 it developed in the southeastern Gulf of Mexico. It was the fifth depression of the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season. The system was declassified as a {{tropical cyclone}} the following day, a remnant circulation later moved over Louisiana and Mississippi, producing heavy rainfall and causing flooding. Along the Florida coast, the system produced heavy waves that contributed to two deaths. Moving inland, {{the remnants of the}} depression reached central Alabama before turning southward. The system nearly redeveloped into a tropical cyclone on August16 after it again reached the Gulf of Mexico, but it became disorganized and turned northward into Mississippi. The depression twice caused BP to delay work in building a relief well to combat the <b>Deepwater</b> <b>Horizon</b> oil spill.|$|E

25|$|In 2012, Hudson {{was cast}} in the {{recurring}} role on Fox teen comedy series, Glee as Cassandra July, Rachel Berry's dance teacher at the fictitious New York Academy of the Dramatic Arts (NYADA). Hudson later went on to play supporting roles in smaller films, including Wish I Was Here and Good People. In 2016, she starred in the romantic comedy Mother's Day, opposite Jennifer Aniston and Julia Roberts, and played Mark Wahlberg's character's wife in the drama <b>Deepwater</b> <b>Horizon,</b> based on the <b>Deepwater</b> <b>Horizon</b> explosion.|$|E
25|$|In November 2010, Jindal {{published}} the book Leadership and Crisis, a semi-autobiography significantly influenced by his {{experiences with the}} most recent Gulf Oil Spill caused by the <b>Deepwater</b> <b>Horizon</b> explosion.|$|E
25|$|In May 2010, the United States Department of the Interior {{called for}} an end to {{drilling}} in the area of the <b>Deepwater</b> <b>Horizon</b> spill. Despite pushback from oil companies and states, the Supreme Court ruled to keep the moratorium in place until October 2010. BP agreed to financial compensation for the damage they caused, including payouts to the <b>Deepwater</b> <b>Horizon</b> Oil Spill Trust. Regulations drafted after the accident required oil companies to update their safety equipment, including blowout preventers. This measure was criticized as too costly to integrate and thus harmful to industry and job growth, so it has been weakly enforced.|$|E
25|$|Mrs. Schmidt {{offered the}} prize purse of the Wendy Schmidt Oil Cleanup X CHALLENGE, a {{challenge}} {{award for the}} efficient capturing of crude oil from seawater motivated by the <b>Deepwater</b> <b>Horizon</b> oil spill.|$|E
25|$|On June 5, 2017, Sessions {{issued a}} memo {{preventing}} the Justice Department's future lawsuit settlements from including funding for third-parties, such {{as had been}} included for the cleanup of the <b>Deepwater</b> <b>Horizon</b> oil spill and the Volkswagen emissions scandal.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, Lagasse {{appeared}} in a commercial {{to raise awareness of}} the <b>Deepwater</b> <b>Horizon</b> oil spill. Also starring in the commercial were Sandra Bullock, Peyton and Eli Manning, Jack Del Rio, Drew Brees, James Carville, Blake Lively, and John Goodman.|$|E
25|$|The {{quantity}} of oil spilled during accidents has {{ranged from a}} few hundred tons to several hundred thousand tons (e.g., <b>Deepwater</b> <b>Horizon</b> oil spill, SS Atlantic Empress, Amoco Cadiz). Smaller spills have already proven {{to have a great}} impact on ecosystems, such as the Exxon Valdez oil spill.|$|E
25|$|Oil and gas {{exploration}} also damage deep-water coral. A {{study conducted}} in 2015 found that injury observed in populations in the Mississippi canyon in the Gulf of Mexico increased from 4 to 9 percent before the <b>Deepwater</b> <b>Horizon</b> oil spill to 38 to 50 percent after the spill (Etnoyer et al., 2015).|$|E
25|$|Vice Admiral Thad Allen in 2005 {{was named}} Principal Federal Officer to oversee {{recovery}} {{efforts in the}} Gulf Region after Hurricane Katrina. After promotion to Admiral, {{on the eve of}} his retirement as Commandant, Allen again received national visibility after being named National Incident Commander overseeing the response efforts of the <b>Deepwater</b> <b>Horizon</b> oil spill.|$|E
25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the <b>Deepwater</b> <b>Horizon</b> oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, there were reports in the press that BP was reconsidering rebranding itself as Amoco in the US. Some independently owned BP stations, including former Amoco stations, switched to a different brand due to the public relations fallout {{as a result of the}} oil spill.|$|E
25|$|The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration {{within the}} United States Department of Commerce {{developed}} a graphic {{of the largest}} oil spills impacting U.S. waters up since 1969. Since 2000, the largest spill has been the <b>Deepwater</b> <b>Horizon</b> spill of 2010. With the exception of Kalamazoo River (2010), all other major spills have occurred around the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, {{still active}} {{at the age}} of 91, Seeger co-wrote and {{performed}} the song God's Counting on Me, God's Counting on You with Lorre Wyatt, commenting on the <b>Deepwater</b> <b>Horizon</b> oil spill. A performance of the song by Seeger, Wyatt, and friends was recorded and filmed on the Sloop Clearwater in August and released as a single and video produced by Richard Barone and Matthew Billy on election day November 6, 2012.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Deepwater</b> <b>Horizon</b> {{oil spill}} in April 2010 {{initiated}} {{a sharp decline in}} share prices, and BP's shares lost roughly 50% of their value in 50days. BP's shares reached a low of $26.97 per share on 25 June 2010 totalling a $100 billion loss in market value before beginning to climb again. Shares reached a post-spill high of $49.50 in early 2011 and as of April 2012 shares remain down approximately 30% from pre-spill levels.|$|E
25|$|The {{oil and gas}} sector {{companies}} are among {{one of the groups}} that are the biggest spenders on lobbying, especially with the recent <b>Deepwater</b> <b>Horizon</b> oil spill putting restrictions on their ability to do offshore drilling. During the 2008 elections, oil companies spent a total of $132.2 million into lobbying for law reform. The three biggest spenders from the oil and gas sector group are Koch Industries ($1,931,562), Exxon Mobil Corporation ($1,337,058) and Chief Oil & Gas ($1,192,361).|$|E
25|$|Secondly, the {{anti-pollution}} and rubbish-recycling industries can be profitable; {{additional income}} {{is generated by}} low-wage workers cleaning up the environment {{after it has been}} fouled up by rich people. After the largest oil spill in history, the 2010 <b>Deepwater</b> <b>Horizon</b> disaster in the Gulf of Mexico, J.P. Morgan analysts concluded that the business generated by clean-up work would very likely be larger than the financial losses to tourism or fishing, resulting in a net increase in GDP.|$|E
25|$|Burning surface oil {{can also}} be a source for {{pollution}} such as soot particles. During the cleanup and recovery process, it will also generate air pollutants such as nitric oxides and ozone from ships. Lastly, bubble bursting {{can also be}} a generation pathway for particulate matter during an oil spill. During the <b>Deepwater</b> <b>Horizon</b> oil spill, significant air quality issues were found on the Gulf Coast, which is the downwind of DWH oil spill. Air quality monitoring data showed that criteria pollutants had exceeded the health-based standard in the coastal regions.|$|E
25|$|Crude oil {{and refined}} fuel spills from tanker ship {{accidents}} have damaged vulnerable ecosystems in Alaska, the Gulf of Mexico, the Galapagos Islands, France, the Sundarbans, Ogoniland, {{and many other}} places. The quantity of oil spilled during accidents has ranged from a few hundred tons to several hundred thousand tons (e.g., <b>Deepwater</b> <b>Horizon</b> Oil Spill, Atlantic Empress, Amoco Cadiz), but volume is a limited barometer of damage or impact. Smaller spills have already proven {{to have a great}} impact on ecosystems, such as the Exxon Valdez oil spill because of the remoteness of the site or the difficulty of an emergency environmental response.|$|E
25|$|Kate Garry Hudson (born April 19, 1979) is an American actress. She rose to {{prominence}} in 2000 for playing Penny Lane in Almost Famous, {{for which she}} won a Golden Globe and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Her other films include How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days (2003), Raising Helen (2004), The Skeleton Key (2005), You, Me and Dupree (2006), Fool's Gold (2008), Bride Wars (2009), Nine (2009), The Killer Inside Me (2010), The Reluctant Fundamentalist (2012), Wish I Was Here (2014), Kung Fu Panda 3 (2016) and <b>Deepwater</b> <b>Horizon</b> (2016).|$|E
25|$|Mussel Watch consults {{with experts}} to {{determine}} appropriate contaminants to monitor; these include dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAHs), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). As of 2008, Mussel Watch monitors approximately 140 analytes. In addition {{to the effects of}} contaminants, Mussel Watch is able to assess the effects of natural disasters, such as the 2005 Hurricane Katrina, and environmental disasters, such as the 2010 <b>Deepwater</b> <b>Horizon</b> oil spill. Data collected by Mussel Watch {{can also be used to}} monitor the effectiveness of coastal remediation. The Mussel Watch Program utilized its 20 years of monitoring data to effectively analyze the impacts of Hurricane Katrina and has affected regulatory decisions based on the data it has collected on bivalve parasites.|$|E
25|$|NOAA awarded TDI-Brooks International with {{a five-year}} {{contract}} to analyze sediment and bivalve tissue chemistry from September 21, 2009 to September 20, 2014. TDI-Brooks has also conducted the testing for the previous ten years from 1999-2009. TDI-Brooks and their affiliate B Laboratories conducts the organic chemical analysis, Rutgers University is subcontracted to conduct the histopathology analysis, and Texas A is subcontracted to conduct the metal and nutrient analysis. Due to the <b>Deepwater</b> <b>Horizon</b> oil spill the resources at these labs were shifted towards chemical analyses of the high-priority samples for the Gulf of Mexico. This caused significant delays, in some cases {{of more than a}} year, of analysis results for the Mussel Watch Program.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to the April 2010 <b>Deepwater</b> <b>Horizon</b> oil spill at an offshore drilling rig in the Gulf of Mexico threatening the coast of Louisiana, Vitter introduced legislation along with Jeff Sessions of Alabama to increase the liability cap of an oil company from $75 million to its most recent annual profits (or $150 million if greater). In the case of BP, {{the owner of the}} oil lease, its liability would be $20 billion. Vitter later introduced an amendment that would remove the cap entirely for this particular spill. Competing Democratic proposals would have raised the liability to $10 billion regardless of profits or removed the cap altogether. Sessions argued that large caps unrelated to company profits would harm smaller companies.|$|E
25|$|Energy {{production}} boomed {{during the}} Obama presidency. An increase in oil production was driven largely by a fracking boom spurred by private investment on private land, and played {{only a small}} role in this development. The Obama administration promoted the growth of renewable energy, and solar power generation tripled during Obama's tenure. Obama also issued numerous energy efficiency standards, contributing to a flattening of growth of the total U.S. energy demand. In May 2010, Obama extended a moratorium on offshore drilling permits after the 2010 <b>Deepwater</b> <b>Horizon</b> oil spill, which is {{generally considered to be}} the worst oil spill in U.S. history. In December 2016, Obama invoked the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to ban offshore oil and gas exploration in large parts of the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans.|$|E
25|$|Solidifying: Solidifiers are {{composed}} of tiny, floating, dry ice pellets, and hydrophobic polymers that both adsorb and absorb. They clean up oil spills by changing the physical state of spilled oil from liquid to a solid, semi-solid or a rubber-like material that floats on water. Solidifiers are insoluble in water, therefore {{the removal of the}} solidified oil is easy and the oil will not leach out. Solidifiers have been proven to be relatively non-toxic to aquatic and wild life and have been proven to suppress harmful vapors commonly associated with hydrocarbons such as Benzene, Xylene, Methyl Ethyl, Acetone and Naphtha. The reaction time for solidification of oil is controlled by the surface area or size of the polymer or dry pellets as well as the viscosity and thickness of the oil layer. Some solidifier product manufactures claim the solidified oil can be thawed and used if frozen with dry ice or disposed of in landfills, recycled as an additive in asphalt or rubber products, or burned as a low ash fuel. A solidifier called C.I.Agent (manufactured by C.I.Agent Solutions of Louisville, Kentucky) is being used by BP in granular form, as well as in Marine and Sheen Booms at Dauphin Island and Fort Morgan, Alabama, to aid in the <b>Deepwater</b> <b>Horizon</b> oil spill cleanup.|$|E
25|$|On 1 October 2010, Bob Dudley {{replaced}} Tony Hayward as the company's CEO {{after the}} <b>Deepwater</b> <b>Horizon</b> oil spill. After {{the oil spill}} BP announced a divestment program to sell about $38 billion worth of non-core assets by 2013 to compensate its liabilities related to the accident. In July 2010, it sold its natural gas activities in Alberta and British Columbia, Canada, to Apache Corporation. It sold its stake in the Petroperijá and Boquerón fields in Venezuela and in the Lan Tay and Lan Do fields, the Nam Con Son pipeline and terminal, and the Phu My 3 power plant in Vietnam to TNK-BP, forecourts and supply businesses in Namibia, Botswana, Zambia, Tanzania and Malawi to Puma Energy, the Wytch Farm onshore oilfield in Dorset and a package of North Sea gas assets to Perenco, natural-gas liquids business in Canada to Plains All American Pipeline LP, natural gas assets in Kansas to Linn Energy, Carson Refinery in Southern California and its ARCO retail network to Tesoro, Sunray and Hemphill gas processing plants in Texas, together with their associated gas gathering system, to Eagle Rock Energy Partners, the Texas City Refinery and associated assets to Marathon Petroleum, the Gulf of Mexico located Marlin, Dorado, King, Horn Mountain, and Holstein fields as also its stake in non-operated Diana Hoover and Ram Powell fields to Plains Exploration & Production, non-operating stake in the Draugen oil field to Norske Shell, and the UK's liquefied petroleum gas distribution business to DCC.|$|E
