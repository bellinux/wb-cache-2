25|$|To {{create a}} {{population}} inversion under these conditions, {{it is necessary}} to selectively remove some atoms or molecules from the system based on differences in properties. For instance, in a hydrogen maser, the well-known 21cm wave transition in atomic hydrogen, where the lone electron flips its spin state from parallel to the nuclear spin to antiparallel, can be used to create a population inversion because the parallel state has a magnetic moment and the antiparallel state does not. A strong <b>inhomogeneous</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> will separate out atoms in the higher energy state from a beam of mixed state atoms. The separated population represents a population inversion which can exhibit stimulated emissions.|$|E
25|$|In 1922, Otto Stern and Walther Gerlach shot silver atoms {{through an}} (<b>inhomogeneous)</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field.</b> In {{classical}} mechanics, a magnet thrown through {{a magnetic field}} may be, depending on its orientation (if it is pointing with its northern pole upwards or down, or somewhere in between), deflected a small or large distance upwards or downwards. The atoms that Stern and Gerlach shot through the magnetic field acted in a similar way. However, while the magnets could be deflected variable distances, the atoms would always be deflected a constant distance either up or down. This implied that {{the property of the}} atom which corresponds to the magnet's orientation must be quantised, taking one of two values (either up or down), as opposed to being chosen freely from any angle.|$|E
25|$|If, {{instead of}} hitting a {{detector}} screen, {{one of the}} beams of atoms {{coming out of the}} Stern-Gerlach apparatus is passed into another (<b>inhomogeneous)</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> oriented in the same direction, all of the atoms will be deflected the same way in this second field. However, if the second field is oriented at 90° to the first, then half of the atoms will be deflected one way and half the other, so that the atom's spin about the horizontal and vertical axes are independent of each other. However, if one of these beams (e.g. the atoms that were deflected up then left) is passed into a third magnetic field, oriented {{the same way as the}} first, half of the atoms will go one way and half the other, even though they all went in the same direction originally. The action of measuring the atoms' spin with respect to a horizontal field has changed their spin with respect to a vertical field.|$|E
