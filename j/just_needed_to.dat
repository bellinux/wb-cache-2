Ichikawa had heard that Curtis was very thin, so he decided to use him, as the {{characters}} in the story have eaten very little. Ichikawa specifically told each actor how he wanted them to react, and would not rehearse. Ichikawa expressed that the narrator (Tamura) could not be a cannibal because then he would have crossed the ultimate low. Ichikawa consulted with his wife, Natto Wada, and they decided against having him eat human flesh. As a result, Tamura never eats any in the film because his teeth are falling out.|$|E
25|$|The 2006 Trojans {{came out}} strong, easily {{defending}} their top 10 status throughout the year. As the season progressed, USC began to display marked inconsistencies, as their margins of victory began to slip. The first setback {{proved to be}} a 31–33 loss to unranked Oregon State, in which the Beavers were able to repeatedly capitalize on several Trojan turnovers. Even though USC dropped initially in the polls, they worked their way back up. After defeating both Cal and Notre Dame, they held the number 2 spot heading into the final week of the season. The Trojans were considered to be a virtual lock for the National Championship Game against Ohio State and <b>just</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> beat UCLA. USC was shocked in the final game of the season, losing to crosstown rival UCLA 13–9. This eliminated the Trojans from championship contention and opened the door for Florida to become Ohio State's opponent. The Trojans did earn a Rose Bowl bid and defeated Michigan 32-18. It was the Trojans fifth straight BCS Bowl appearance.|$|E

500|$|Leng, {{the first}} author to write purely on Harrison's career rather than on his {{standing}} as a musical celebrity, considers Dark Horse to be a [...] "remarkably revealing album" [...] and writes: [...] "Any voyeur who {{wanted to know the}} intimate details of his personal life didn't need to buy National Enquirer, they <b>just</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> hear this disc." [...] While bemoaning the state of Harrison's voice and the [...] "sonic patchwork" [...] nature of the set, Leng notes that both [...] "So Sad" [...] and [...] "Far East Man" [...] were received positively when first released on albums by Alvin Lee & Mylon LeFevre and Ron Wood, respectively. The difference in winter 1974–75, Leng continues, was that, by championing Ravi Shankar's Indian music segments during the tour and neglecting his duties as an ex-Beatle in America, Harrison had [...] "committed the cardinal counterculture sin – he had rejected 'rock 'n' roll'".|$|E

And boy, was it." [...] He also praised the Peggy/Jarvis dynamic, the MCU tie-ins and connections the series included, such as the Black Widow program, and the strong portrayals of the season's supporting characters. Amy Ratcliffe at Nerdist called the season [...] "a memorable splash" [...] a noted {{that the lack of}} filler in the short season lead to [...] "action-packed but not overstuffed" [...] episodes. She praised the [...] "period aspect that's defined so well by music, sets, and costumes" [...] as placing the series [...] "head and shoulders above others", and called the cast [...] "eminently talented". On the other hand, Lowry ultimately found the series [...] "just didn't have legs", saying that after the premiere it [...] "meandered through several episodes that merely seemed to inch the story along, rallying only slightly in the not wholly satisfying conclusion." [...] He felt that outside of Atwell's Carter and D'Arcy's Jarvis that characters were not developed enough, and said that the MCU tie-in with Toby Jones' Arnim Zola made the series seem like [...] "a footnote".|$|E

500|$|Prior to {{the start}} of his {{freshman}} year, Frazier recorded a team-high 34-inch vertical in Penn State's preseason workouts. He also matched the 2009 NBA Draft Combine record, and surpassed the event's best lane agility time. Frazier did not participate in Penn State's exhibition opener against Slippery Rock. Coach DeChellis said, [...] "Billy Oliver, Sasa , Tim Frazier, Jermaine Marshall, they haven't played in this yet, so it was important just to get out there." [...] In his first official appearance against Pennsylvania, Frazier added 2 points and 1 rebound in a scoreless performance. He was only allowed 8 minutes of play time. He scored his first points against Robert Morris the following contest, with a game-high 19 points off the bench. He shot 6-of-11 from the field, and 4-of-5 on three-pointers. Frazier also contributed 3 assists, 2 rebounds, and 1 steal in 30 minutes on the court. DeChellis said, [...] "(Tim) is a hard guy to contain. If he starts making perimeter shots, then we're that much better. We've seen him where he can make shots in practice and do pretty well. We <b>just</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> get him some confidence and get him into the flow." [...] The game would remain a season-high for him under the scoring category. Frazier was awarded his first start as a shooting guard on November 22, 2009 against Davidson; he registered 7 points, 5 rebounds, 3 assists, and 3 steals. He recorded a season-high 34 minutes. He finished the 2009–10 season averaging 5.0 points, 2.3 rebounds, 2.4 assists, 0.7 steals, and 1.7 turnovers. He played in all 31 regular season games.|$|E

Working with him [...] is just putting us fucking upside down. He's cracking the whip". After recording all the instrumental parts for the record, Moreno decided to record his vocals separately, and finished recording the album with former Far guitarist Shaun Lopez as producer. According to an interview with Abe Cunningham, there were tensions involved with the recording of Saturday Night Wrist that were related to the band members' personal lives.

The series was notorious in the writing community at the time; O'Brien recalls [...] "everyone wanted to be on that show, but they never hired." [...] O'Brien {{was one of the first}} hires after the show's original crew. With the help of old Groundlings friend Lisa Kudrow, O'Brien purchased an apartment in Beverly Hills. He and Kudrow became involved as well, and Kudrow believed he should begin performing rather than writing. O'Brien disagreed, feeling that Kudrow was being overly flattering and that asserting he was happy as a writer. In his speech given at Class Day at Harvard in 2000, O'Brien credited The Simpsons with saving him, a reference to the career slump he was experiencing prior to his being hired for the show.|$|E

Fleetwood and Olsen collaborated on a number of drumming innovations. [...] "It was all about 'plastic puke.' First off, for the kick drum I had Mick use a real skin, not a plastic head. All the bass drum sounds had snap and rack and warmth, but the snare drum on the whole album was a plastic puke." [...] The album had reached No. 1 come November 1976, and at this time Fleetwood Mac became self-managing, with Fleetwood himself arguing that an external manager would be less apt at holding together such a group of dynamic personalities. He put forward an idea of promising to reimburse any losses suffered by promoters should they occur, in an attempt to raise the group's profile and earn more contracts and gigs. [...] "Self-management was the right decision," [...] remembered freelance Rolling Stone writer John Grissim. [...] "Mick Fleetwood had great leadership skills... {{had a great deal of}} experience – nine years. They were business-like, they always delivered the product and had the right lawyers and accountants for the job. They didn't need what Van Morrison called 'pressure mongers,'...they <b>just</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> get on and make a really good album."

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Intel's market share was being seriously eroded by upstart {{competitors}} such as Advanced Micro Devices (now AMD), Zilog, {{and others who}} had started to sell their less expensive microprocessors to computer manufacturers. This was because, by using cheaper processors, manufacturers could make cheaper computers and gain more market share in an increasingly price-sensitive market. In 1989, Intel's Dennis Carter visited MicroAge's headquarters in Tempe, Arizona, to meet with MicroAge's VP of Marketing, Ron Mion. MicroAge {{had become one of}} the largest distributors of Compaq, IBM, HP, and others and thus was a primary although indirect driver of demand for microprocessors. Intel wanted MicroAge to petition its computer suppliers to favor Intel chips. However, Mion felt that the marketplace should decide which processors they wanted. Intel's counterargument was that it would be too difficult to educate PC buyers on why Intel microprocessors were worth paying more for ... and they were right. [...] But Mion felt that the public didn't really need to fully understand why Intel chips were better, they <b>just</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> feel they were better. So Mion proposed a market test. Intel would pay for a MicroAge billboard somewhere saying, [...] "If you're buying a personal computer, make sure it has Intel inside." [...] In turn, MicroAge would put [...] "Intel Inside" [...] stickers on the Intel-based computers in their stores in that area. To make the test easier to monitor, Mion decided to do the test in Boulder, Colorado, where it had a single store. Virtually overnight, the sales of personal computers in that store dramatically shifted to Intel-based PCs. Intel very quickly adopted [...] "Intel Inside" [...] as its primary branding and rolled it out worldwide.|$|E
2500|$|Guitarist Brad Delson {{experimented with}} an EBow when {{the band was}} piecing {{together}} [...] "The Little Things Give You Away". The band decided {{not to use the}} effect for the solo in that song and instead ended up creating [...] "No More Sorrow" [...] out of the effect. In [...] "Given Up", he jingles the keys that are heard while several clap sounds are overlaid in the intro of the song (as mentioned in the lyric book: Brad added the sounds on the intro song: multiple tracks of claps - and keys jingling.). Shinoda and Delson teamed up with David Campbell to add string elements to six songs; [...] "Leave Out All the Rest", [...] "Shadow of the Day", [...] "Hands Held High", [...] "The Little Things Give You Away", as well as the two b-sides [...] "No Roads Left" [...] and [...] "Blackbirds" [...] (which was instead later used in the iPhone game 8-Bit Rebellion! as well as being included as a bonus track for A Thousand Suns), respectively. All scratching elements by Joe Hahn that existed in the previous two studio albums are largely absent because of the low mixing, except on the songs [...] "What I've Done", [...] "Wake", [...] "The Little Things Give You Away", [...] "Valentine's Day" [...] and [...] "In Pieces". Hahn contributes more with programming, electronics, and other elements to many of the songs. The church organ and military drumbeat on [...] "Hands Held High" [...] were originally to be used as the backdrop to melodic vocals, but Rubin recommended that the band try the opposite approach according to the album booklet. For the album, the band recorded fifty to sixty songs in August 2006. Their previous albums took only about three to six months to complete, while this one took 14 months. They spent over six months writing the songs. In previous albums, they composed an average of 40 songs, but they made over 100 this time. [...] "Shadow of the Day" [...] is one of two songs (the other being [...] "No Roads Left") to have Bennington playing the guitar. During live performances, Shinoda is generally playing the keyboard for [...] "Shadow of the Day", while Bennington plays rhythm guitar. Shinoda stated in an interview: [...] "We were looking back at the things that we had done in the past... and I think we just figured that we had exhausted that sound.
