50|$|Year-round {{transportation}} of mail, passengers, and light freight {{has always been}} a problem in remote areas of Siberia and Eastern Europe. Many communities are surrounded by deep snow, hummock ice, marshes that remain unfrozen, and natural waterways choked by weeds. The constantly changing conditions faced by these communities required the development of a vehicle capable of traveling over a widely varied surface at high speeds in order to deliver mail and supplies, as well to transport passengers, and provide <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> <b>relief</b> and evacuation to hospitals. To satisfy these requirements, the Tupolev Design Bureau developed an amphibious aerosledge with the appearance of a powered speedboat, powered by a single radial engine mounted behind the cabin in a pusher configuration. Development of the A-3 began in 1961, with the first production A-3 being delivered in 1964. Production of the A-3 continued until the early 1980s. Though early production A-3's were manufactured near Moscow, the majority of A-3 production took place in Ukraine, at the Tyachivski Transcarpathian helicopter plant. By the time production ceased in 1983 over 800 A-3 Aerosledges had been produced. Also Nikolay Kamov developed such like the Aerosled K30.|$|E

40|$|Cholera, {{a disease}} {{with a long}} history, {{continues}} to devastate populations around the world. Due to the route of transmission of Vibrio cholerae, the bacterial pathogen that causes the disease, cholera only seems to affect developing countries, giving rise to a health disparity. For developed countries with adequate water and sewage treatment systems, the threat of cholera is irrelevant. Meanwhile, developing countries which have underlying vulnerabilities of poverty and lack basic access to clean water and proper sanitation are disproportionately affected. There are many factors that put different populations at risk for cholera outbreaks. Epidemiological studies of cholera outbreaks show {{that the combination of}} poverty with the effects of conflict or natural disaster produces the most vulnerable population of refugees or internally displaced persons (IDP). Not only are these populations more susceptible to the risk of cholera outbreak, but they are more vulnerable to its devastating effects. Refugee and IDP camps experience higher attack rates and case fatality rates (CFR) due to the scarcity of resources (Brown, Jacquier, Bachy, Bitar, & Legros, 2002). Cholera outbreaks in displaced populations present a public health hazard in an emergency context. If these outbreaks are not properly managed, they can develop into epidemics and pandemics. Thus, it is important to implement a swift and effective strategy to manage cholera outbreaks in refugee and IDP camps. To do this there are two main objectives: control transmission of the disease and <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> <b>relief.</b> Control of transmission must be accomplished through short- and long-term solutions: a supply of adequate water and sanitation combined with a public health campaign to promote knowledge and proper practices. <b>Emergency</b> <b>medical</b> <b>relief</b> would consist of establishment of cholera treatment centers (CTC) that would provide urgent intervention to efficiently diagnose and treat cases of cholera to reduce fatality rates...|$|E

H 577 P LMS 2017 Hexviii, 149 pages :illustrationsEmerging and re-emerging {{epidemic}} diseases pose an on-going {{threat to}} global public health security. Recent examples of epidemics, including {{the outbreak of}} Ebola virus disease, cholera and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), have caused physical and psychological pain of millions of people. Epidemic outbreaks are also very common {{in the aftermath of}} natural disasters and bioterrorist actions. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) 's Twelfth General Programme of Work, the improvement of prevention, preparedness, response and recovery activities is set as one of the WHO's five strategic imperatives. In response to a large-scale epidemic, satisfying medical needs is crucial to the success of humanitarian-oriented operations and management. However, it differs from the general business logistics problems in many ways. This research underscores the importance of humanitarian medical allocation, and aims to explore a novel approach for improving humanitarian allocation of medical reliefs for response to unconventional large-scale epidemics, and draw managerial insights for health care practice. Several methods are adopted, including stochastic dynamic programming, linear programming, epidemic diffusion models and game theory. This inter-disciplinary research would contribute to the decision analysis of humanitarian medical allocation. Specifically, three sub-topics are conducted focusing on humanitarian medical allocation in one area, allocation in multiple areas and allocation with cross-sector cooperation, respectively. (1) In the sub-research of humanitarian medical allocation in one area, this research proposes a model of time-varying allocation of <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> <b>relief</b> for response to large-scale epidemics. Based on the trend of epidemic disease spreading, a stochastic dynamic programming model is developed to optimize the temporal allocation policy of <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> <b>relief</b> in each time period. This new formulation is closer to the real logistics practice during epidemic outbreaks than the traditional ones. Additionally, this research obtains a general form of the optimal medical allocation decision in each time period and further develops a case study based on real data to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model. According to the above analytical and numerical studies, some properties are provided and their implementations for policy makers are discussed. (2) In the sub-research of humanitarian medical allocation in multiple areas, we present a novel model of emergency medical logistics for quick response to public health emergencies. The proposed methodology consists of two recursive mechanisms: (i) the time-varying forecasting of medical relief demand and (ii) relief distribution. The medical demand associated with each epidemic area is forecast according to a modified susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) model. A linear programming approach is then applied to facilitate distribution decision-making. Both the physical and psychological situations of those affected are considered. The modified SEIR model contributes to forecasting by considering not only physical factors, such as the differences in the infection conditions of survivors and the spatial interaction relationships among epidemic areas, but also the psychological demand of exposed and undiagnosed individuals. In the distribution model, psychological fragility is formulated and discussed in detail, unlike previous studies. The relationship between emergency medical logistics and the psychological effects on affected people is highlighted as well. Numerical studies are conducted. Results show that the consideration of survivor psychology significantly reduces the psychological fragility of affected people, but it barely influences physical fragility. (3) Typically, humanitarian logistics engages a large number and variety of sectors, including central governments, local governments, the military, international organizations and private companies. Modern information technologies provide potential opportunities to share information among different sectors, and to work together to pursue effective and efficient relief operations. However, each of these sectors may have different missions and capacities. In this sub-research of cross-sector cooperation in allocation, a series of cross-sector decision models are developed to discuss different types of cooperation and information sharing between public and private sectors. The basic model, which consists of a public sector (usually the government) and a private sector, is formulated to obtain the optimal decisions of the two sectors. Then this research presents three more cooperation mechanisms: semi-cooperation with a private leader, semi-cooperation with a government leader, and full cooperation. The optimal solutions of these four models are provided and compared. By solving and comparing their optimal solutions, this sub-research makes the first step to understand the differences among these four mechanisms. The results illustrate that full cooperation is not always the best choice, while semi-cooperation with information sharing would also achieve potential advantages, even if two sectors made their own decisions separately.

30|$|Focus group {{participants}} routinely expressed {{a need for}} high quality, free hospitals, and medical services in their communities. Since 2010, Haiti experienced an influx of <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> facilities and <b>relief</b> aid, {{and many of the}} emergency providers did not begin pulling out until 2013 to 2015. As a result, the current clinics and hospitals in the area no longer meet the community’s expectations of what medical services should cost, if anything, as well as the comprehensiveness of the treatment. This prolonged accessibility of free, or low cost, western medical services offered by aid agencies appears to have shifted expectations about the cost of medical treatment while simultaneously reducing patronage to local Haitian doctors. This sudden departure of <b>medical</b> <b>relief</b> has also caused the local MSPP clinic to become inundated with more emergency patients. Consequently, staff and health care professionals are overworked and receive the same amount of resources despite having more patients, according to a key informant that works within the local MSPP.
