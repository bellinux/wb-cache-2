40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this paper explores and models the interactions needed {{for the development of a}} collaborative and adaptive Geographical Information Sys-tem (GIS). The proposed framework is based on a multi-dimensional contextual ap-proach that makes the difference between the user, <b>geographical</b> and <b>device</b> contexts. The spatial distribution of the GIS functional components allows for the characteri-sation of different geographical context configurations. These configurations act as a support for the derivation of user groups. The interfaces and functionalities offered by the adaptive GIS are modeled at the group level, and derived from the interface usages and habits. The spatial behaviours that denote user experiences within a group are shared with other users within that group. Such an approach provides an adaptive and collaborative environment that favours exchanges and enrichments of the quality of services offered to the users acting in such a GIS environment. The framework is applied and experimented in the context of maritime navigation. Key words: Adaptive and mobile GIS, collaborative filtering, context-awareness...|$|R
40|$|Architecture and Landscape Architecture {{are often}} {{regarded}} as different yet complementary disciplines. This thesis proposes an expanded relationship between both disciplines, enhancing {{strategies for the}} creation of urban spaces. A preoccupation with blurring the boundaries between architecture and landscape architecture has been present in the theory and practice of both disciplines throughout history. A concern with architecture conceived as landscape has recently regained prominence through contemporary projects such as the Oslo Opera House. This has led to the following question: Is it possible to design more vibrant and engaging urban spaces through design strategies that blur the traditional distance between architecture and landscape? This thesis identifies and explores two landscape devices {{that can be used to}} transform urban space and create an architecture as landscape -­&# 8208; the concepts of the analogue and the illusion. This research demonstrates that these concepts can be deployed specifically to enrich the urban realm. Landscapes that have been hidden or lost as result of the development of the city can be recovered and reinstated to again play a fundamental role in urban space. Specifically, through analogue the intention is to translate to urban environments, spatial and formal relationships that exist in natural landscapes through the use of <b>geographical</b> <b>devices.</b> On the other hand, illusion is implemented to prompt the visual perception of spatial configurations that have been lost. A series of case studies from art, architectural and landscape architectural works have been studied that demonstrate the research concerns through analogue and illusion. They cover key historical and current examples that unfold strategies to inform the design studies. With this approach of research by design, the design practice itself becomes the mechanism through which relationships between architecture and landscape are examined and reformulated. The design studies are located in selected areas of the City of Sydney, specifically Bondi Beach and Barangaroo, which have been chosen because they are sites characterized by complex interaction between geography and urban form. In this way, the central formulations of the thesis are demonstrated by design studies as well as through the written text...|$|R

40|$|When navigating, {{people often}} {{rely upon a}} variety of {{geographic}} information sources to guide them to their destinations. These include maps, descriptions, or a combi-nation of these as displayed traditionally on paper or through high-tech (handheld and in-vehicle) navigation devices. Maps provide a graphic representation of an en-vironment and can vary in level of spatial (e. g., granularity) and labeling (e. g., label addition/removal) details. Likewise, written descriptions of an environment also vary in their levels of spatial (e. g., inclusion or exclusion of spatial information) and label-ing (e. g., label addition/removal) detail. Importantly, experience within and memory for an environment may change {{as a function of}} these variations. The present exper-iments examine the interactions of spatial and labeling detail in generating and using mental representations of college campuses. The results of four experiments demon-strate that reducing spatial details through graphic generalization can increase memory for verbally presented information. Results additionally demonstrate the importance of balancing spatial and verbal detail in maps and descriptions in correspondence with human working memory constraints. Accordingly, we present a limited model of appropriate spatial and verbal generalization strategies, with particular regard to implementation in <b>geographical</b> positioning <b>devices...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of minority family businesses in emerging markets has several {{theoretical and practical}} implications. First, a practical consequence of institutional weakness sug-gests that family businesses perform both wealth-creation and wealth-preservation tasks in an emerging market. Legal protection for property rights and financial institutions specializing in wealth reallocation and preservation are often ineffective in emerging markets. Lacking such security, the family business unit necessarily becomes {{something more than a}} value-creation device; it may also serve as a wealth-protection and inter-generational and/or <b>geographical</b> transmission <b>device</b> used to preserve and transfer wealth through various informal and often nontransparent means. Consequently, the financial goals of the family firm are subject to frequent trade-offs between entrepre-neurial activities that generate new wealth and more defensive activities that preserve, hide, or allow for the geographic or intergenerational transmission of wealth. The occurrence of minority family businesses in small-scale activities such as retailing, restaurants, and garment manufacture is common in both mature and emerging market (Light & Bhachu, 1993). However, in emerging markets, private and closely held firms owned by members from minority populations frequently dominate the economy or at least a significant part of it. In many countries of Africa, Southeast Asia, South America, and the Caribbean, minorit...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: High inter- and intra-laboratory {{variability}} {{exists for}} the single-breath diffusing {{capacity of the}} lung for carbon monoxide (DL,CO) test. To detect small changes in diffusing capacity in multicentre clinical trials, accurate measurements are essential. The present study assessed whether regular DL,CO simulator testing maintained or improved instrument accuracy and reduced variability in multicentre trials. The 125 pulmonary function testing laboratories that participated in clinical trials for AIR 1 Inhaled Insulin validated and monitored the accuracy of their DL,CO measuring devices using a DL,CO simulator, which creates known target values for any device. Devices measuring a simulated DL,CO different from target by. 3 mL?min- 1 ?mmHg- 1 failed testing and were serviced. Device accuracy was assessed over time and with respect to differences in several variables. Initially, 31 (25 %) laboratories had a DL,CO device that failed simulator testing. After fixing or replacing devices, 124 (99 %) laboratories had passing devices. The percentage of failed tests significantly decreased over time. Differences in <b>geographical</b> region, <b>device</b> type, breath-hold time, temperature and pressure were not associated with meaningful differences in DL,CO device accuracy. Regular diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide simulator testing allows pulmonary function testing laboratories to maintain the accuracy of their diffusing capacity measurements, leading to reduced variability across laboratories in multicentre clinical trials...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The popularization of <b>geographical</b> {{position}} <b>devices</b> (e. g. GPS) creates {{new opportunities}} for analyzing behavior of moving objects. However, such analysis are hindered {{by a lack of}} semantic information associated to the basic information provided by GPS. Previous works propose semantic enrichment of trajectories. Through the semantic enrichment, we could check which trajectories have a given moving sequence in an application. Often, this sequence is expressed according to the semantic application, using the approach of semantic trajectories proposed in the literature. This trajectory can be represented as a sequence of predicates that holds in some time interval. However, the solutions for querying moving sequence proposed by previous works have a high computational cost. In this paper, we propose an expressive query language to semantic trajectories that allows temporal constraints. To evaluate a query we will use model checking based on timed automata, that can be performed in polynomial time. As this model checking algorithm is not implemented yet, we propose to use UPPAAL tool, that can be more expensive theoretically, but we expected that will be e cient for our approach. In addition, we will present a query example that demonstrates the expressive power of our language. Although in this paper we will focus on semantic trajectories data, our approach is general enough for being applied to other purposes...|$|R

40|$|Our {{understanding}} of the annual life-cycle movements of small migratory birds has advanced rapidly {{with the advent of}} light-weight <b>geographical</b> positioning <b>devices</b> (i. e., geolocators), yet the effects of geolocators on reproduction and survival have not been adequately quantified. We tested for impacts of attaching a 1 -g geolocator (using a harness around the legs and back, anterior to the tail) to adult Tree Swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) on parental feeding behavior, nestling growth and size, fledging success, and return rates between 2011 and 2012. At one breeding site, we compared feeding visits, nestling growth, and nestling size between paired nest boxes where one parent was marked at the 'geolocator' box with a 'control' nest box where neither parent was marked. We detected no differences between geolocator and control nests in either the frequency of feeding visits to nestlings or {{the amount of time spent}} at nests. Birds marked with geolocators fed nestlings as frequently as their unmarked mates. Likewise, nestlings raised at geolocator nests grew at similar rates to those at control nests, and had similar structural size and body mass at fledging. At three widely-separated sites across the Tree Swallow breeding range in Canada, we also found that fledging success was similar for geolocator and control nests. Although we found no evidence for short-term negative impacts of geolocators, the return rates of geolocator-marked Tree Swallows tended to be significantly lower than those of unmarked control birds. Thus, we found little evidence for short-term impacts of geolocators on reproduction but our study does suggest that long-term impacts of geolocators could be manifested in terms of lower survival, higher emigration rates, or lower breeding propensity. © 2013 Dt.

This is supported by a highly configurable Trust-function that build a graph G = (V,E) where E denotes similarity between the connected users and the clustering algorithm Chinese Whispers. It was also discovered that different user activities and certain terminal usage patterns are strongly correlated, showing that user patterns differs between <b>devices.</b> <b>Geographical</b> location is discarded as a parameter for potential future methods since all results from the two networks are highly aligned and no deviation in user behavior is detected due to location. i i...|$|R

40|$|Location-based {{services}} (LBS) are {{services offered}} through a mobile device that {{take into account}} a <b>device’s</b> <b>geographical</b> location. To provide position information for these services, location is a key process. GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) can provide sub-meter accuracy in open-sky areas using satellite signals. However, for indoor and dense urban environments, the accuracy deteriorates significantly because of weak signals and dense multipaths. The situation becomes worse in indoor environments where the GNSS signals are unreliable or totally blocked. To improve the accuracy of indoor positioning for location-based services, an improved WiFi/Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR) integrated positioning and navigation system using an adaptive and robust filter is presented. The adaptive filter is based on scenario and motion state recognition and the robust filter {{is based on the}} Mahalanobis distance. They are combined and used in the WiFi/PDR integrated system to weaken the effect of gross errors on the dynamic and observation models. To validate their performance in the WiFi/PDR integrated system, a real indoor localization experiment is conducted.

40|$|International audienceReducing {{conditions}} with elevated sulfide and methane concentrations in ecosystems such as hydrothermal vents, cold seeps or organic falls, {{are suitable for}} chemosynthetic primary production. Understanding processes driving bacterial diversity, colonization and dispersal is of prime importance for deep-sea microbial ecology. This study provides a detailed characterization of bacterial assemblages colonizing plant-derived substrates using a standardized approach over a geographic area spanning the NorthEast Atlantic and Mediterranean. Wood and alfalfa substrates in colonization devices were deployed for different periods at 8 deep-sea chemosynthesis-based sites in four distinct geographic areas. Pyrosequencing of a fragment of the 16 S rRNA-encoding gene was used to describe bacterial communities. Colonization occurred within the first 14 days. The diversity was higher in samples deployed for more than 289 days. After 289 days, no relation was observed between community richness and deployment duration, suggesting that diversity may have reached saturation sometime in between. Communities in long-term deployments were different, and their composition was mainly influenced by the <b>geographical</b> location where <b>devices</b> were deployed. Numerous sequences related to horizontally-transmitted chemosynthetic symbionts of metazoans were identified. Their potential status as free-living forms of these symbionts was evaluated based on sequence similarity with demonstrated symbionts.

The profiles are used for data prefetching, selection of most suitable wireless network and cache management on the mobile device in order to optimally utilize the device's storage capacity and available bandwidth. Some of the inherent characteristics of mobile devices due to user movements are – non-persistent connection, limited bandwidth and storage capacity, changes in mobile <b>device's</b> <b>geographical</b> location and connection (eg. connection can be from GPRS to WLAN to Bluetooth). New research is being carried out in making mobile devices work more efficiently by reducing and/or eliminating their limitations. The focus {{of this research is}} to propose, evaluate and test a new user profiling technique which specifically caters {{to the needs of the}} mobile device users who are required to access large amounts of data, possibly more than the device storage capability during the course of the day or week. This work involves the development of an intelligent user profiling system along with mobile device caching system which will first allocate weight (priority) to the different sets and subsets of the total given data based on user's location, user's appointment information, user's preferences, device capabilities and available networks. Then the profile will automatically change the data weights with user movements, history of cached data access and characteristics of available networks. The Adaptive User and Device Profiles were designed to handle broad range of the issues associated with: •Changing network types and conditions •Limited storage capacity and document type support of mobile devices •Changes in user data needs due to their movements at different times of the day Many research areas have been addressed through this research but the primary focus has remained on the following four core areas.
