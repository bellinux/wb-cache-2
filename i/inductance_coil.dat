40|$|A superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage (SMES) {{includes}} a high <b>inductance</b> <b>coil</b> that {{can act as}} a constant source of direct current. A SMES unit connected to a power system is able to absorb and store both active and reactive power from this system and to inject these powers into this system when they are needed.

A SMES is always associated with a power conversion system consisting of two identical converters connected by a de link capacitor. This paper presents an efficient system, based on a SMES unit, to improve transient stability by regulating the dc link voltage to reduce the voltage and frequency fluctuations that occur after disturbances or rapid load changes.

The effects of the distance on the microstructures and optical properties of silicon films were systematically investigated in our work. The investigation was conducted in the ICP-chemical vapor deposition process {{with a mixture of}} SiH 4 /H 2 as the source gas at a low temperature of 240 °C. Characterization of the films with X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy revealed that the crystallinity and crystallite size firstly increased and then decreased with increasing the distance. The maximum was reached at the distance of 5 cm. By SEM measurements, the film morphologies were shown to be consistent with the XRD and Raman analysis results. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic analysis showed the hydrogen was predominantly incorporated in the silicon films in the mono-hydrogen (Si–H) bonding configuration. With increasing the distance, the hydrogen content in the silicon films exhibited similar behavior with crystallinity of silicon films. Based on the results, a gas-phase transport process was suggested for the deposition of silicon films in ICP-CVD system. Furthermore, the Tauc's optical band gap achieved the maximum of 1. 68 eV with the distance of 5 cm. Besides the effect of hydrogen content, the quantum size effect might also be responsible for higher band gap in crystalline silicon films...|$|E
40|$|In {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI), rapidly changing gradient fields are applied to encode the {{magnetic resonance}} signal with spatial position; however eddy currents are induced in the surrounding conducting structures depending on the geometry of the conductor and the excitation waveform. These alternating fields change the spatial profile of the current density within the coil track with the applied frequencies of the input waveform and by their proximity to other conductors. In this paper, {{the impact of the}} conductor width and the excited frequency over the parameters that characterise the performance of split transverse and longitudinal gradient coils are studied. Thirty x-gradient coils were designed using a "free-surface" coil design method and the track width was varied from 1 mm to 30 mm with an increment value of 1 mm; a frequency sweep analysis in the range of 100 Hz to 10 kHz was performed using the multi-layer integral method (MIM) and parameters such as power loss produced by the coil and generated in the cryostat, <b>inductance,</b> <b>coil</b> efficiency (field strength/operating current), magnetic field profile produced by the coil and the eddy currents were studied. An experimental validation of the theoretical model was performed on an example coil. Coils with filamentary conductor segments were also studied to compare the simulated parameters with those produced by coils with a finite track. There was found to be {{a significant difference between the}} parameters calculated using filamentary coils and those obtained when the coil is simulated using finite size tracks. A wider track width produces coil with superior efficiency and low resistance; however, due to the skin effect, the power loss increases faster in wider tracks than in those generated in coils with narrow tracks. It was demonstrated that rapidly changing current paths must be avoided in order to mitigate the power loss and the spatial asymmetry in the current density profile. The decision of using narrow or wider tracks in split coils should be carefully investigated using a temperature analysis which includes skin and proximity effect...|$|E
