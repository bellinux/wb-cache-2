5|$|Patton was {{a staunch}} fatalist, and {{believed}} in reincarnation. He believed that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been a military leader {{killed in action}} in Napoleon's army in a previous life, or a Roman legionary.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> had {{business}} with J. Bruce Ismay, {{chairman of the}} White Star Line; in any case, Ismay had invited Hays to join him on the RMS Titanic. Hays, his wife, Clara, his daughter, Orian (see source note), his son-in-law, Thornton Davidson, his secretary, Mr. Vivian Payne, and a maid, Miss Mary Anne Perreault, shared a deluxe suite (cabin B69) on the Promenade Deck.|$|E
5|$|Had Napoleon {{succeeded in}} {{destroying}} the existing coalition forces south of Brussels {{before they were}} reinforced, <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been able to drive the British back to the sea and knock the Prussians out of the war. Crucially, this would have bought him time to recruit and train more men before turning his armies against the Austrians and Russians.|$|E
60|$|And now he sat {{looking at}} the fence, wishing,--wishing;--no, {{certainly}} not wishing that Graham's hurt had been more serious; but wishing that in falling from his horse <b>he</b> <b>might</b> utterly <b>have</b> fallen out of favour with that sweet young female heart; or rather wishing, could he so have expressed it, that <b>he</b> himself <b>might</b> <b>have</b> had the fall, and the broken bones, and all the danger,--so that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> also <b>have</b> had the interest which those eyes and that voice had shown.|$|R
6000|$|... 'There's nothin' we {{can trace}} 'ome to 'im {{in so many}} words, but we think <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>'ave</b> saved us the font business. Now, in regard to that votin' business--' ...|$|R
30|$|<b>He</b> <b>might</b> (still/*already) <b>have</b> won.|$|R
5|$|It is also unknown {{under which}} Hellenized name the ancient {{historian}} Manetho listed Khaba. <b>He</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> {{been the same}} person as the listed Mesôchris or Sôÿphis, but this in turn is doubted by Wolfgang Helck and Eberhard Otto. They connect both names with king Sanakht.|$|E
5|$|Palairet {{missed all}} of the 1899 season through appendicitis; Baily's Magazine of Sports & Pastimes {{suggested}} that but for this <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> appeared for England against Australia that summer. He returned in 1900, scoring 947 runs {{at an average of}} 35.07. His only century came against Hampshire, when he scored 161 runs, and shared a partnership of 262 with Charles Bernard.|$|E
5|$|Whalebone was foaled in 1807 out of {{the mare}} Penelope, who was a {{daughter}} of Prunella. He raced for six years and won the Derby in 1810. He later sired two Derby winners, Lap-dog and Spaniel and Caroline, winner of the Oaks. <b>He</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been the sire of Derby winner Moses, but Moses' parentage is uncertain due to his dam being covered by two stallions.|$|E
60|$|Jolyon thought <b>he</b> <b>might</b> not <b>have</b> {{the chance}} of saying it after.|$|R
60|$|We {{laughed at}} this, for by our {{reckoning}} <b>he</b> <b>might</b> almost <b>have</b> been our father.|$|R
60|$|Harris, {{the author}} of Hermes, and Lowth, were others in whose {{friendship}} <b>he</b> <b>might</b> justly <b>have</b> prided himself.|$|R
5|$|Władysław {{used the}} title of the King of Sweden, {{although}} he had no control over Sweden whatsoever and never set foot in that country. However, he continued his attempts to regain the Swedish throne, with similar lack of results as his father. <b>He</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been willing to trade his claim away, but the offer was never put down in the negotiations.|$|E
5|$|Constantine XI died without {{producing}} an heir, and had Constantinople not fallen <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been succeeded by {{the sons of}} his deceased elder brother, who were taken into the palace service of Mehmed II {{after the fall of}} Constantinople. The oldest boy, re-christened as Has Murad, became a personal favorite of Mehmed and served as Beylerbey (Governor-General) of the Balkans. The younger son, renamed Mesih Pasha, became Admiral of the Ottoman fleet and Sancak Beg (Governor) of the Province of Gallipoli. He eventually served twice as Grand Vizier under Mehmed's son, Bayezid II.|$|E
5|$|Eight Union sailors {{were killed}} and 44 were wounded while the Confederates lost none. (Captain Joseph Dixon of the river {{batteries}} had been killed the previous day during Carondelets bombardment.) On land the well-armed Union soldiers surrounded the Confederates, while the Union boats, although damaged, still controlled the river. Grant realized that any success at Fort Donelson {{would have to be}} carried by the army without strong naval support, and he wired Halleck that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> to resort to a siege.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>might,</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> {{thought it}} worth his while, {{have found some}} respectable French family and boarded her out. There was a man he had known for years at Oxford, a cabinetmaker; the wife a most worthy woman. He could have gone over there from time to time, his {{notebook}} in his pocket, and have interviewed her.|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>might</b> also <b>have</b> {{been with}} more certainties {{the father of}} another Caecilius Metellus, the father of Quintus Caecilius Metellus.|$|R
50|$|Augustine of Hippo {{does not}} name the thief, but wonders if <b>he</b> <b>might</b> not <b>have</b> been baptized at some point.|$|R
5|$|Florence Harding became deeply {{involved}} in her husband's career, both at the Star and once he entered politics. Exhibiting her father's determination and business sense, she helped turn the Star into a profitable enterprise through her tight management of the paper's circulation department. She has been credited with helping Harding achieve more than <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> alone; {{some have suggested that}} she pushed him {{all the way to the}} White House.|$|E
5|$|Fossett {{took off}} with enough fuel for four to five hours of flight, {{according}} to spokesperson Major Cynthia S. Ryan, Public Information Officer with the Civil Air Patrol (CAP). Searchers with CAP were told that Fossett had gone out for a short flight over favorite territory, possibly including the areas of Lucky Boy Pass and Walker Lake. At one point {{it was suggested that}} <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been out scouting for potential sites to conduct a planned land speed run.|$|E
5|$|He was {{commissioned}} second lieutenant in The Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own) {{at the start}} of the First World War and departed for the Western Front a few weeks later. In February 1915, he was attached to the Royal Flying Corps and soon became No. 2 Squadron's senior observer. In August 1915, while on a photographic reconnaissance mission, his aircraft was shot down in northern France, near Lille. At the time of his death, it was suggested that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been the first undergraduate to see action in the war.|$|E
60|$|It crossed Pigling's {{mind that}} if HE {{had asked for}} a lift, too, <b>he</b> <b>might</b> still <b>have</b> been in time for market.|$|R
60|$|There was {{no change}} in her face, but Swithin's pale eyes bulged as though <b>he</b> <b>might</b> {{suddenly}} <b>have</b> been afflicted with insight.|$|R
60|$|Lancey {{admitted}} that <b>he</b> <b>might,</b> perhaps, <b>have</b> {{been a little}} harsh in expressing himself, and then went off {{to prepare for the}} journey.|$|R
5|$|Heraclius the Elder is next {{mentioned}} in 608 as Patrician and Exarch of Africa. According to Patriarch Nikephoros, Heraclius the Elder {{had been appointed}} to the position by Maurice prior to the latter's deposition and death in 602. <b>He</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> replaced Innocentius, a temporary exarch appointed between 598 and 600. The appointment suggests that Heraclius the Elder enjoyed the favor of Maurice and would have reason to remain loyal to him. Heraclius the Elder and his African court notably lamented the death and execution of Maurice and posthumously praised the fallen emperor.|$|E
5|$|John Cabot was {{sponsored}} by Henry VII on his voyage in 1497, {{looking for a new}} route to the Orient. Having discovered North America instead, on his return Cabot spoke of the great quantities of cod to be found near the new land. In 1498 Cabot set sail again from Bristol with an expedition of five ships and is believed to have never returned from this voyage, although recent research conducted at the University of Bristol, suggests that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have.</b>|$|E
5|$|John {{initially}} attended local schools. When he was aged 10, {{his family}} scraped together {{the money to}} send him to Midland District Grammar School in Kingston. Macdonald's formal schooling ended at 15, a common school-leaving age at a time when only children from the most prosperous families were able to attend university. Nevertheless, Macdonald later regretted leaving school when he did, remarking to his secretary Joseph Pope that if he had attended university, <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> embarked on a literary career.|$|E
60|$|Was {{there any}} hope? In {{the agony of}} her soul she had confided last night in one; with {{scarcely}} a bewildering hope that he could save her. <b>He</b> <b>might</b> not <b>have</b> the power, the opportunity, the wish. <b>He</b> <b>might</b> shrink from mixing himself up with such characters and such transactions; <b>he</b> <b>might</b> not <b>have</b> received her hurried appeal in time to act upon it, even if the desire of her soul were practicable. A thousand difficulties, a thousand obstacles now occurred to her; and she felt her hopelessness.|$|R
60|$|He was dumb for a time, {{astonished}} beyond measure, as <b>he</b> well <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been. <b>He</b> doubted his ears. He was outraged.|$|R
25|$|He never {{mentioned}} {{his mother in}} his verses and <b>he</b> <b>might</b> not <b>have</b> known much about her. Perhaps she also had been a slave.|$|R
5|$|Perhaps no {{work of art}} so {{imperfect}} ever announced {{such power}} in the artist—perhaps no artist so powerful ever rested his fame on so imperfect a production—as Thalaba. The author calls it a metrical romance; <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> called it a lyrical one; for the story is told, as in an ode, by implication; not directly, as in an epopoeia. It is a gallery of successive pictures. Each is strikingly descriptive... but the personages, like the figures of landscape-painters, are often almost lost in the scene: they appear as the episodical or accessory objects.|$|E
5|$|Ric {{is having}} second {{thoughts}} about allowing Maddy to be interviewed. He explains to Michael that he doesn't think that she {{is ready for the}} position. Maria overhears the pair's conversation and chips in saying that she feels that Maddy is perfect. Michael knows Maria is right but Ric thinks <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> made a mistake and he explains to Maddy that he is withdrawing her interview offer. Maddy is devastated.|$|E
5|$|The {{exterior}} iconography {{includes two}} notable whimsical elements. A downspout {{on the east}} wall features a relief of a bulldog head; a decades-old myth relates that Cram placed it there to recognize Yale University, whose mascot is the bulldog. (Cram was not a Yale alumnus and in fact did not attend college, so {{it is unclear what}} interest <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> had promoting Yale.) A sculptor who worked on the chapel during its construction placed small carvings of his face and Cram's at the bottoms of crockets flanking the main entrance; Cram is identifiable by his glasses.|$|E
60|$|But Leonard {{had burned}} {{the boat in}} which <b>he</b> <b>might</b> now <b>have</b> {{embarked}} on a sea of glory. He could only shake his head feebly.|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>might</b> well <b>have</b> been {{doubtful}} of her humor. He {{seemed to}} decide that she was jesting, for he answered lightly, [...] "Why, you began it." ...|$|R
