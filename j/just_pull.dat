[...] In 2002, Gossard said, [...] "It was 'over-rocked', we were novices in the studio and spent too long recording, doing different takes, and killing the vibe and overdubbing tons of guitar. There's a lot of reverb on the record." [...] In 2006, Vedder said, [...] "I can listen to the early records [...] the first record...it's just the sound of the record.

I always had a fascination with ancient history, Roman especially, and early English, and I kept imagining her getting her head chopped off, for my whole life. Then, I told my friend Joe, who did the art. He always had an obsession with Marie Antoinette too. She was also decapitated. We also thought about Jayne Mansfield, just {{the idea of a}} woman having her mouth and eyes and ears taken away from her. And, hand grenades, the top comes off. You <b>just</b> <b>pull</b> out the pin and it explodes. So, if you take away someone's mouth and their eyes and their senses and their brain, they explode. I saw a grenade in my head, I saw taking out the clip, and then I thought of a human body and what happens if you take out the clip." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Russian Roulette" [...] {{begins with}} a [...] "searing" [...] guitar solo that later {{transitions}} into a [...] "pulsing" [...] beat which stays constant {{until the end of}} the song. The single opens with the lyrics, [...] "Take a breath/ Take it deep/ Calm yourself/ He says to me/ If you play/ You play for keeps/ Take the gun/ And count to three." [...] The metaphor about the game of Russian roulette is also present in the chorus in which Rihanna sings, [...] "And you can see my heart beating/ You can see it through my chest/ I said I'm terrified, but I'm not leaving/ I know that I must pass this test/ So <b>just</b> <b>pull</b> the trigger." [...] In the upcoming verse, the character that the singer portrays in the song it's scared that the man talking to her will always have a power over, [...] "Say a prayer to yourself/ He says close your eyes/ Sometimes it helps/ And then I get a scary thought/ That he's here means he's never lost." [...] "Russian Roulette" [...] ends with a sound of a gun shot, which according to Michaelangelo Matos of The A.V. Club extends the drama accompanied by [...] "harrowing scenarios and tremulous vocals".|$|E
500|$|... "Borderland" [...] first premiered on UPN in the United States on October 29, 2004. The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from television critics.

Maureen Ryan for the Chicago Tribune praised the return of Brent Spiner to Star Trek, saying [...] "Surprise, fear, elation, self-control; they're all given masterful life by Spiner {{in the space of}} a few seconds." [...] The reviewer at IGN thought that the episode was a return to the quality of [...] "", and praised the abilities of Spiner. The teaser trailer was compared to that of a Quentin Tarantino film, and a score of 3/5 was given saying [...] "Executive Producer Manny Coto has a long way to go if he has any hope of making up for Enterprise's transgressions the past three years but if this three episode story arc lives up to the promise shown in Borderland, he might <b>just</b> <b>pull</b> it off." [...] Stephanie Vander Weide of Television Without Pity gave the episode a [...] "C" [...] grade rating. She said that she liked the premise of the episode, but felt that the execution was sub-par, describing the augments as [...] "Khannabees" [...] and expressing her disappointment in the actions of Captain Archer. The mini-arc featuring the episodes [...] "Borderland", [...] "Cold Station 12" [...] and [...] "The Augments" [...] were subsequently ranked the sixth best story of Enterprise by Den of Geek writer James Hunt.|$|E

500|$|The US ran a {{propaganda}} campaign through the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) {{to enhance the}} size of the southward exodus. The program was directed by Colonel Edward Lansdale, who masqueraded as the assistant US air attaché in Saigon while leading a covert group that specialised in psychological warfare. Lansdale had advised Diem that it was imperative to maximise the population in the south in preparation for the national reunification elections. When Diem noted the limited ability of the south to absorb refugees, Lansdale assured him that the US would bear the burden. Diem thus authorised Lansdale to launch the propaganda campaign. According to the historian Seth Jacobs, the campaign [...] "ranked with the most audacious enterprises in the history of covert action". Lansdale recollected that [...] "U.S. officials {{wanted to make sure that}} as many persons as possible, particularly the strongly anti-communist Catholics, relocated in the South". While many Diem supporters claimed that the mass exodus was proof of the popularity of Diem and the people's hatred of communism, the CIA operative Chester Cooper said [...] "the vast movement of Catholics to South Vietnam was not spontaneous". However, while Lansdale is often credited by historians—usually those critical of his influence—with the large exodus of refugees due to superstition, he rejected the notion that his campaign had much effect on popular sentiment, saying in later years: [...] "People don’t <b>just</b> <b>pull</b> up their roots and transplant themselves because of slogans. They honestly feared what might happen to them, and their emotion was strong enough to overcome their attachment to their land, their homes, and their ancestral graves. So the initiative was very much theirs—and we mainly made the transportation possible." [...] Some northerners who stayed behind and were interviewed half a century later said that they had not come across any pro-migration propaganda and said that their decisions were based on discussions with fellow locals. They said that concerns over the possible effects of communist rule were discussed among themselves independent of outside information.|$|E

He had an anger in him that was unbelievable. The number of meals I've had thrown on the floor or in my lap. He'd pick up the tablecloth and <b>just</b> <b>pull</b> it off the table, and all the food would go flying. He had tantrums, a lot. But then he was calm and sweet. Very sweet, very lovable.

2500|$|The musicians {{on these}} {{recordings}} included Harrison on guitars and bass; Temple members such as Yamuna on lead vocals; and other devotees on backing vocals, mridanga, harmonium, tambura and kartal. Harrison was much impressed with Yamuna's voice and suggested she could become [...] "a famous rock star". In a 1982 discussion with Mukunda, Harrison said: [...] "I {{liked the way}} [...] sang with conviction, and she sang [...] like she'd been singing it a lot before. It didn't sound like the first [...] tune she'd ever sung." [...] Discussing Harrison's role in the studio, Gurudas, Yamuna's husband, has compared him with the Hare Krishna movement's leader, saying: [...] "George was like Prabhupada, {{he could be a}} ringmaster – he could <b>just</b> <b>pull</b> everything together." ...|$|E
2500|$|More {{than nine}} {{helicopters}} eventually joined the chase; {{the high degree}} of media participation caused camera signals to appear on incorrect television channels. The chase was so long that one helicopter ran out of fuel, forcing its station to ask another for a camera feed. Radio station KNX also provided live coverage of the low-speed pursuit. USC sports announcer Pete Arbogast and station producer Oran Sampson contacted former USC coach John McKay to go on the air and encourage Simpson to end the pursuit. McKay agreed and asked Simpson to pull over and turn himself in instead of committing suicide; [...] "My God, we love you, Juice. <b>Just</b> <b>pull</b> over and I'll come out and stand by you all the rest of my life", he promised. LAPD detective Tom Lange, who had previously interviewed Simpson about the murders on June 13, realized that he had Simpson's cellular phone number and called him repeatedly. A colleague hooked a tape recorder up to Lange's phone and captured a conversation between Lange and Simpson in which Lange repeatedly pleaded with Simpson to [...] "throw the gun out [...] the window" [...] {{for the sake of his}} mother and children. Simpson apologized for not turning himself in earlier that day and responded that he was [...] "the only one who deserved to get hurt" [...] and was [...] "just gonna go with Nicole." [...] Cowlings' voice is overheard in the recording (after the Bronco had arrived at Simpson's home surrounded by police) pleading with Simpson to surrender and end the chase peacefully. During the pursuit and without having a chance to hear the taped phone conversation, Simpson's friend Al Michaels interpreted his actions as an admission of guilt.|$|E
