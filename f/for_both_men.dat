5|$|Alpine {{skiing is}} an Olympic sport, contested at the Winter Olympic Games. The first Winter Olympics, held in 1924, {{included}} nordic skiing, {{but the first}} alpine skiing events were not held until 1936 in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany. A combined event was held <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>men</b> and women in 1936. The International Ski Federation (FIS) decided that ski instructors could not compete in 1936 because they were professionals, and the Olympics were meant for amateur athletes. Because of this, Austrian and Swiss skiers boycotted the events, although some Austrians decided to compete for Germany.|$|E
5|$|Australia's strongest ever {{performance}} in swimming {{was at the}} 1956 Olympics on home soil in Melbourne. Australia claimed eight of the thirteen gold medals available, including both relays and a clean sweep of the medals in the 100m freestyle, considered the blue-riband event <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>men</b> and women. This {{is the only time}} that Australia has topped the medal tally in swimming, and the tally of gold medals has not been surpassed despite the expansion of the swimming program to its current 32 events.|$|E
5|$|Due to World War II, no {{games were}} held in 1940 or 1944. Two new alpine events were added in 1948: {{downhill}} and slalom. Combined events were also held in 1948, but were dropped after that and not contested again at the Olympics until 1988. The giant slalom debuted at the Olympics in 1952 and the Olympic program was three events <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>men</b> and women through 1984.|$|E

5|$|In the {{earliest}} days of the Vietnam War, North Vietnam supplied the Viet Cong in the South by two methods. The first was to extend the Ho Chi Minh Trail southward into the tri-border region of Laos/Cambodia/South Vietnam. The Trail, a labyrinth of paths, roads, river transportation systems and way-stations, was constantly being expanded and improved. It served as a logistical jugular vein, <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>men</b> and material, for the North Vietnamese war effort against South Vietnam. The second method was to transport supplies by sea.|$|E

5|$|Aside {{from the}} team sport of football, which had 16 participants, fencing and wrestling were the sports in which Egypt had the most participants, sending 12 representatives to each. Of them, wrestling was almost {{exclusively}} male with only one female, Rabab Eid, taking part. The sport with the most Egyptian female participation was synchronized swimming, an all-woman tournament at the Olympics, with eight, while the nation sent six women to fencing, the highest amount for a mixed sport. Among tournaments with the potential <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>men</b> and women to take part, Egypt qualified females, but not males, for badminton, and males, but not females, for track and field athletics, boxing, canoeing, equestrian, football, judo, and sailing.|$|E

With 25 metres left, Morgan took {{her head out}} of the water, and seeing the American a body length in front, dug deep to re-establish a lead of 0.7 of a second going into the final changeover. Crapp then extended the lead over the United States to 2.2 seconds to secure gold in a world record time of 4 minutes 17.1 seconds. The Melbourne Olympics was the only time that Australia has made a clean sweep of the 100-metre freestyle and the relay events <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>men</b> and women. This feat has only been equalled by the Americans at the 1920 Summer Olympics. The victory was Australia's only victory in a female swimming relay at the Olympics until the 2004 Summer Olympics.|$|E
5|$|The early women’s {{movement}} in China focused on eradicating {{the assumption that}} women were inferior to men. The early reformers believed that women needed help to improve their own attitudes about themselves, since even the women generally considered themselves to be inferior to men. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) had shown an early interest in protecting the rights of women. During the 2nd National Congress in 1922, the CCP issued a statement arguing {{for the end of}} Chinese traditions that repress women. The CCP also released a formal letter ensuring equality under the law <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>men</b> and women, and guaranteed equal pay for both genders during the 3rd National Congress.|$|E
5|$|According to Dyer in 1982, {{exclusion}} of netball from the Summer Olympics {{is part of}} the historical pattern of the slow growth and gradual acceptance of women's sports. Women first competed in the 1900 Summer Olympics in only three sports: tennis, croquet and golf. Women's cycling was excluded for many years despite having world championships organised by 1958. Field hockey, a sport included for men as early as 1908, was not open to competition by women until 1980. By the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, there were 159 medal events for men, but only 86 for women, and 12 <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>men</b> and women, and as late as 1996, 26 countries sent no women to the Olympics. There were still sports that excluded women at the 2000 Summer Olympics, such as boxing, wrestling and baseball. At the 2012 Summer Olympics, every country but Nauru did, and both men and women competed in 34 sports.|$|E

5|$|Freestyle {{skiing is}} one of the six skiing {{disciplines}} contested at the Winter Olympic Games, and one of the youngest. In 1924, the first Winter Olympics featured Nordic skiing disciplines (cross-country skiing, ski jumping, and Nordic combined), while alpine skiing was first contested in 1936. Only at the 1992 Winter Olympics, in Albertville, France, were freestyle skiing events first held as official medal events. Before that, freestyle skiing was contested at the 1988 Winter Olympics as a demonstration sport, consisting of events <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>men</b> and women in three variants: moguls, aerials and ski ballet. In Albertville, moguls was the first-ever official freestyle skiing medal event; aerials and ski ballet were also held but still as demonstration events. The growing popularity of aerials convinced the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to add this freestyle discipline to the 1994 Winter Olympics official program. Moguls and aerials have thus been contested at every Winter Games since. Ski cross inclusion in the Winter Olympics program was approved at an IOC Executive Board meeting in November 2006, and the first events were held at the 2010 Winter Olympics.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Copeland {{initially}} made $210 {{per week}} {{while working for}} WWF without an official contract. The company also paid for his outstanding college debt, which was around $40,000. After a Grand Prix Wrestling tour {{in the summer of}} 1997, De Marco urged Copeland to go to Calgary, where Hart was informally training wrestlers while recovering from knee surgery. He spent his tour earnings on a plane ticket and landed with no money or place to stay. He called Johnny Smith, whom he would met twice, and Smith agreed to give him food and shelter. Smith also drove Copeland to and from the gym and Hart's house, where he trained alongside Ken Shamrock, Test, Mark Henry and Kurrgan. Copeland returned to the Maritimes for another Grand Prix tour before going back to Hart's house, bringing Christian with him. After this camp, Hart was impressed enough to put in a good word <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>men</b> at the WWF.|$|E
5|$|Lowland Scotland {{was part}} of the pattern of late {{marriage}} <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>men</b> and women (between the mid and late 20s), with a relatively large proportion of the population remaining unmarried. In the Highland and Islands marriage ages may have been lower and more closely resembled Gaelic Ireland. Throughout the period, women could legally marry from the age of 12 and boys from 14. However, while many girls from the social elite married in their teens, most in the Lowlands only married after a period of life-cycle service, in their twenties. Normally marriage followed handfasting, a period of betrothal, which in the Highlands may have effectively been a period of trial marriage, in which sexual activity may have been accepted as legitimate. Marriages, particularly higher in society, were often political in nature and the subject of complex negotiations over the tocher (dowry). Some mothers took a leading role in negotiating marriages, as Lady Glenorchy did for her children in the 1560s and 1570s. They could also act as matchmakers, finding suitable and compatible partners for others.|$|E

5|$|On 9 July 1386, at the Palais de Justice in Paris the two claimants {{faced each}} other {{for the first time since}} their {{confrontation}} at Argentan several months before. Each stepped before the Parlement in turn and presented their case for the King and court, Carrouges throwing down his gauntlet in challenge and Le Gris picking it up signifying his acceptance of the duel. Le Gris also embellished his case by insisting that should he be proven innocent of the offence, he would sue Carrouges or his estate for 40,000 livres. Following the declarations a number of high-ranking noblemen stepped forward to act as seconds in the duel <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>men,</b> including Waleran of Saint-Pol for Carrouges and Philip of Artois, Count of Eu for Le Gris. After hearing the challenges and accusations, the Parlement and King debated the case and decided that a full hearing of the evidence from witnesses would be held to determine guilt. If the case could not be decided by normal means, then a judicial duel would be held to adjudicate the dispute, God choosing the victor.|$|E
5|$|On 9 July 1386, {{the second}} stage in the legal process began when both Carrouges and Le Gris, with their followers, {{presented}} themselves before the Parlement of Paris at the Palais de Justice to issue the formal challenge. This involved reciting their accusations and throwing down a gauntlet signifying their intention to fight. The declarations were pronounced {{in front of the}} King, his brother Louis of Valois and the entire Parlement, who decided to initially hear the case as an ordinary criminal one and defer their decision on whether to permit the judicial duel until both sides had given testimony. Attempts had been made to persuade Le Gris to insist on a church trial, but these proved unsuccessful as Le Gris wished to counter the accusation with a lawsuit against his opponent claiming 40,000 livres for defamation. Following the declarations a number of high-ranking noblemen stepped forward to act as seconds in the duel <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>men,</b> including Waleran of Saint-Pol for Carrouges and Philip of Artois, Count of Eu for Le Gris.|$|E
