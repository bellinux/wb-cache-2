2500|$|Activity {{anorexia}} (AA) is {{a condition}} where rats begin to exercise excessively while simultaneously cutting down on their food intake, similar to human anorexia nervosa or hypergymnasia. When given free access to food and an exercise wheel, rats normally develop a balanced routine between exercise and food intake, which turns them into fit rats. However, if food intake is restricted and wheel access is unrestricted, rats begin to exercise more and eat less, resulting in excessive weight loss and, ultimately, death. The running cycles shift so {{that most of the}} running is done in hours before feeding is scheduled. In other conditions, AA does not develop. Unrestricted food access and restricted wheel access will not cause any significant change in either feeding or exercise routine. Also, if rats are restricted both in food intake and wheel access, they will adjust accordingly. In fact, if rats are first trained to the <b>feeding</b> <b>schedule</b> and then given unrestricted access to a running wheel, they will not develop AA behavior. Results support the notion that the running interferes with adaptation to the new <b>feeding</b> <b>schedule</b> and is associated with the reward system in the brain. One theory is that running simulates foraging, a natural behavior in wild rats. Laboratory rats therefore run (forage) more in response to food shortages.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Periodic {{parenteral}} hyperalimentation, the in-terruption {{of feeding}} {{for a period}} of time each day, parallels the fasted vs fed state in the meal eater. The fasted state appears to be more physiologic and seems to be associated with an increase of visceral proteins. Intravenous hyperalimentation data that have been published seem to confirm this fact. The purpose of this study was to compare the effect of continuous enteral hyperalimentation and interrupt enteral hyperalimen-tation on the visceral protein compartment. Two groups of 10 afebrile matched control patients (group 1) were on continuous enteral hyperalimentation for 19 &plusmn; 6 days with no improvement in serum albumin or serum transferrin levels. No changes were made in the <b>feeding</b> <b>schedules</b> of 10 of the patients. <b>Feeding</b> <b>schedules</b> of the other 10 patients were changed to an 8 -hr interrupt enteral hyperalimentation with calories, protein, an...|$|R
40|$|Like agriculture, {{decisions}} regarding aquacultural production are complex.

This paper extends existing research by demonstrating general solutions for optimal <b>feeding</b> <b>schedules</b> and harvesting time under conditions of piecewise-continuous, weight-dependent prices. The solutions are characterized by idiosyncratic responses to marginal changes in exogenous parameters. For instance, a 1 % decline in the interest rate can induce a 70 % increase in the optimal weight.

50|$|Historically, mothers {{used to be}} told to {{maintain}} a strict schedule for breast feeding, limiting the time at breast and the frequency. As a result, many mothers had low milk supply (as breast milk is a supply-demand phenomenon), and therefore their babies “failed to thrive.” Not surprisingly, the amount of formula available skyrocketed, as did the availability of strained or mashed “baby foods.” By the 1930s, a variety of Gerber purees were available for purchase.

[...] In rare cases hypoglycemia may {{continue to be a}} problem in mature, usually very small, Yorkies. It is often seen in Yorkie puppies at 5 to 16 weeks of age. [...] Very tiny Yorkie puppies are especially predisposed to hypoglycemia because a lack of muscle mass makes it difficult to store glucose and regulate blood sugar. [...] Factors such as stress, fatigue, a cold environment, poor nutrition, and a change in diet or <b>feeding</b> <b>schedule</b> may bring on hypoglycemia. [...] Low blood sugar can also be the result of a bacterial infection, parasite, or portosystemic liver shunt. [...] Hypoglycemia causes the puppy to become drowsy, listless (glassy-eyed), shaky, uncoordinated, since the brain relies on sugar to function. During a hypoglycemic attack, the puppy usually has very pale or grey gums. The puppy also may not eat unless force-fed. [...] Hypoglycemia and dehydration seem to go hand-in-hand, and force-feeding or injecting fluids may also be necessary. Additionally, a hypoglycemic Yorkie may have a lower than normal body temperature and, in extreme cases, may have a seizure or go into a coma. A dog showing symptoms should be given sugar in the form of corn syrup or Nutri-Cal and be treated by a veterinarian immediately, as prolonged or recurring attacks of hypoglycemia can permanently damage the dog's brain.

Birds were randomly assigned to 15 dietary treatments, including four replicates (seven hens and one rooster/treatment), and fed conventional diet (11. 7 MJ kg- 1 of metabolisable energy, 14 % crude protein).

Similarly, also using the evaluation index and sub-ordinate function methods, the higher scores were obtained by birds fed more than once a day.

To assess the impact of meal size and feeding frequency on biochemical markers, a prospective intervention study was developed {{to determine the effects of}} various feeding schedules on selected blood and urine variables during four feeding phases. Blood and urine samples were collected weekly during a 6 -week standard <b>feeding</b> <b>schedule</b> (average six meals per day over eight hours), a 6 -week continuous <b>feeding</b> <b>schedule</b> (twelve meals per day over twelve hours), a 3 -week recovery period (same as standard <b>feeding</b> <b>schedule),</b> and a 6 -week bulk <b>feeding</b> <b>schedule</b> (two meals per day over six hours). Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to compare postprandial mean blood and urine data collected over a 21 -week period from six bottlenose dolphins at the U. S. Navy Marine Mammal Program in San Diego, California. Most changes were observed during the bulk feeding intervention including significantly increased levels of serum gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, triglyceride and urine creatinine as well as significantly decreased levels of urine uric acid and uric acid/creatinine. Serum cholesterol significantly increased during the continuous feeding intervention when compared to the standard <b>feeding</b> <b>schedule.</b> Significance was also observed when comparing estimated glomerular filtration rates among the four feeding phases. Findings were consistent with human studies assessing meal size and frequency as determinants of chronic health. Findings were also consistent with studies assessing the effects of high-protein diets on both animals and humans.

Food intake rates, frequency of aggressive interactions, and baseline levels of corticosterone were measured.

These findings are supported by a previous study that showed that red knots {{take a long time to}} adjust to the newly offered, predictable conditions of their aviary environment. The frequency of conflicts in the different groups and (size-corrected) body mass were not correlated with average corticosterone level. The results are examined in the light of literature showing that increases in corticosterone in response to acute, unpredictable events mediate behavioral responses such as increased explorative behavior and memory. For red knots that have to find their food on the temperate-zone mudflats in Western Europe, an increased circulating corticosterone level may be adaptive during periods when the patchily distribution of buried bivalves and the burying behavior of such prey presents them with a variable and unpredictable food supply. ...|$|R
