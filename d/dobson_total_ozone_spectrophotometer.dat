The results showed significant differences among the recalculated data and those original ones published in the bulletins Ozone Data for the World. In the period 1962 - 1979 they reached 10 - 19 D.

40|$|A {{seasonal}} trend analysis of published Dobson (including stations' newly revised and Brewer-simulated <b>Dobson)</b> <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> data through 1991 from {{a network of}} 56 stations has been performed, using three different data periods. The trend results for the longest data period 1964 - 1991 indicate substantial negative trends in ozone in the higher northern latitudes during the winter and spring seasons, some evidence of negative trend in the higher southern latitudes (30 deg S - 55 deg S) during all seasons, and trends close to zero for all seasons over the 30 deg S - 30 deg N latitude range.

From the Dobson data {{it is estimated}} that the overall global trend in <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> is - 0. 26 + or - 0. 92 percent per decade, which indicates no significant overall trend; and for the total ozone-solar flux relationship there is a 1. 18 + or - 0. 66 percent change in <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> from solar cycle minimum to maximum that reveals a positive relationship. Analysis of the Umkehr data reveals a negative trend of - 0. 30 + or - 0. 17 percent per year in the layers 7 snd 8. The relationship between Umkehr data and solar flux in layers 6 and 7 is 2. 57 + or - 1. 25 percent and 3. 40 + or - 2. 16 percent change from solar cycle minimum to maximum; however, no significant relationship is detected in the higher layers 8 and 9.

40|$|Approximately {{seven and}} one half months of stratospheric ozone {{profiles}} have been processed from the LIMS (Limb Infrared Monitor of the Stratosphere) experiment on the Nimbus 7 satellite.

Topics covered include the ozone channel characteristics, precision, systematic uncertainties, and comparisons {{with data from}} balloon and rocket underflights, Umkehr soundings, and Dobson measurements. Comparisons with <b>Dobson</b> <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> are made by integrating combined LIMS plus balloon profiles. The estimated on-orbit precision is 0. 02 - 0. 16 ppmv. Simulations of the experiment indicate potential systematic uncertainties ranging from 15 percent in the 1 -mbar region to an upper limit of 40 percent at 100 mbar and 0. 1 mbar.

40|$|<b>Total</b> <b>ozone</b> data {{obtained}} with a Dobson instrument at Syowa Station are compared with Nimbus 7 <b>Total</b> <b>Ozone</b> Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) version 6 data for 1979 through March 1988. Generally speaking TOMS data show larger {{values of a}} few percent compared with Dobson data. Monthly averaged differences demonstrate a clear seasonal variation of summer maximum. This behavior {{was the same as}} my previous work in which Dobson data were compared with TOMS version 5 data over Syowa Station. My previous work also revealed a long term trend of difference due to TOMS version 5 data which have been affected by the deterioration of the diffuser plate attached to the TOMS instrument. No such long term trend is recognized in the present result which shows the superiority of the new calibration method adopted in the TOMS version 6 data analysis. However, the clear seasonal variation of difference between <b>Dobson</b> <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> data and new version of TOMS data suggests a problem which may inherently exist in the TOMS data or Dobson data.

40|$|A {{detailed}} {{statistical analysis}} of monthly averages of ozonesond readings is performed to assess trends in ozone in the troposphere and the lower to midstratosphere. Regression time series models, which include seasonal and trend factors, are estimated for 13 stations located mainly in the midlatitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. At each station, trend estimates are calculated for 14 'fractional' Umkehr layers covering the altitude range from 0 to 33 km. For the 1970 - 1982 period, the main findings indicate an overall negative trend in ozonesonde data in the lower stratosphere (15 - 21 km) of about - 0. 5 percent per year, and some evidence of a positive trend in the troposphere (0 - 5 km) of about 0. 8 percent per year. An in-depth sensitivity study of the trend estimates is performed with respect to various correction procedures used to normalize ozonesonde readings to <b>Dobson</b> <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> measurements.

40|$|During {{deliberations}} of the International Ozone Trends Panel (IOTP) {{it became}} obvious that satellite determinations of global ozone amounts by themselves could not provide the necessary confidence in the measured trends. During the time of the deliberations of the IOTP, Bojkov re-examined the records of serveral North American Dobson stations and Degorska re-examined the records of the Belsk station. They were able {{to improve the quality of}} the data sets, thus improving the precision of their <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> data sets.

40|$|The {{morphology}} {{of temperature}} {{trends in the}} south polar stratosphere from 1979 - 1985 is detailed. A significant cooling {{has occurred in the}} stratosphere over this period. South polar October mean temperatures have declined 18 K at 24 km over the seven-year period. A large fraction of this decline occurs as a result of including 1979 temperatures in the trend. The years 1979 and 1982 differ from other years in that they include large mid-October wave events which produce significantly warmer polar temperatures. Nevertheless, a significant temperature decline has still occurred in the stratosphere even when the dynamically active years are not included. Comparing two relatively dynamically quiet years, 1980 and 1985, the largest temperature decrease in the 30 mb temperature field occurs not at the pole but in the subpolar temperature maximum centered near 60 deg S.

From the ozonesonde observations, the injection of ozone from the stratosphere to the troposphere through the tropopause gap was deduced. The decreased ozone concentration in the lower stratosphere, similar to as same as the Antarctic ozone hole, was observed south of 60 °S.

In addition to standard evaluation techniques, STL-decomposition methods (Seasonal Trend decomposition of time series based on LOcally wEighted Scatterplot Smoothing, LOESS) are used to address temporal variability and trends in the Dobson data. The LOESS-smoothed trend components show a decline of <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> between the 1970 s and 2000 s and a "stabilization" at lower levels in recent years, which is also confirmed by linear trend analysis. Methods from statistical extreme value theory (EVT) are used to characterize days with high and low <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> (termed EHOs and ELOs, respectively) at each station and to analyze temporal changes in the frequency of ozone extremes and their relationship to dynamical features such as the North Atlantic Oscillation and El Niño Southern Oscillation. A comparison of the "fingerprints" detected in the frequency distribution of the extremes with those for standard metrics (i. e., the mean) shows that more "fingerprints" are found for the extremes, particularly for the positive phase of the NAO, at all five US monitoring sites. Results from the STL-decomposition support the findings of the EVT analysis. Finally, we analyze the relative influence of low and high ozone events on seasonal mean column ozone at each station.

A statistical model for a trend analysis of the ozone time series has been used. The model included terms for seasonal variations in mean ozone and seasonal variations in ozone trends as well as the effect of some meteorological factors. An attempt to assess stratospheric temperature and ozone-temperature trends in the troposphere and lower and mid-stratosphere has also been made.

The Dobson observations employed are those routinely submitted to the World Ozone and Ultraviolet Data Centre (WOUDC) of the World Meteorological Organization, whereas the effective temperatures have been extracted from two sources: the European Space Agency, ESA, Ozone Climate Change Initiative, Ozone-CCI, GODFIT version 3 (GOME-type Direct FITting) algorithm applied to the GOME 2 /MetopA, GOME 2 A, observations {{as well as the}} one derived from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) outputs.

Both GODFIT_v 3 and ECMWF T eff s are found to be unbiased against the ozonesonde observations and to agree with high correlation coefficients, especially for latitudes characterized by high seasonal variability in T eff. The validation analysis shows that, when applying the GODFIT_v 3 effective temperatures in order to post-process the Dobson TOC, the mean difference between Dobson and GOME 2 A GODFIT_v 3 TOCs moves from 0. 63 [*]±[*] 0. 66 to 0. 26 [*]±[*] 0. 46  % in the Northern Hemisphere and from 1. 25 [*]±[*] 1. 20 to 0. 80 [*]±[*] 0. 71  % in the Southern Hemisphere.

40|$|Data {{from the}} <b>Total</b> <b>Ozone</b> Mapping Spectrometer on the Nimbus- 7 {{are used to}} map the climatological <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> within and around {{tropical}} cyclones. A tropical cyclone numerical model is used to interpret <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> patterns. The <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> maps are used to diagnose storm intensity and to differentiate between intesifying and weakening tropical cyclones. The tropical cyclone intensity versus <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> anomaly distribution is examined and examples of mapping the <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> of tropical cyclones in the period 1979 - 1982 are presented...|$|R

40|$|<b>Total</b> <b>ozone</b> values {{measured}} by the <b>Total</b> <b>Ozone</b> Mapping Spectrometer during January, February, and March 1989 are analyzed. During this period, polar <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> values did not reveal clear depletions, although average winter <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> values indicate that a 2 - 6 percent ozone reduction has occurred in northern mid to high latitudes over the last 10 years. Rapid <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> increases were seen during mid-February, resulting from a wave 2 major stratospheric warming. In order to track polar air over the warming period, <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> trends are further analyzed using Ertel's potential vorticity...|$|R
40|$|NOAA’s {{program of}} long term {{monitoring}} of the vertical distribution of ozone with Electrochemical Concentration Cell (ECC) ozonesondes has undergone a number of changes over the 50 year record. In order to produce a homogenous data set, these changes must be documented and where necessary, appropriate corrections applied. This is the first comprehensive and consistent reprocessing of NOAA’s ozonesonde data records that corrects for these changes using the rawest form of the data (cell current and pump temperature) in native resolution {{as well as a}} point by point uncertainty calculation that is unique to each sounding. The reprocessing is carried out uniformly at all eight ozonesonde sites in NOAA’s network with differences in sensing solution and ozonesonde types accounted for in the same way at all sites. The corrections used to homogenize the NOAA ozonesonde data records greatly improve the ozonesonde measurements with an average one sigma uncertainty of ± 4 – 6  % in the stratosphere and ± 5 – 20  % in the troposphere. A comparison of the integrated column ozone from the ozonesonde profile with co-located <b>Dobson</b> <b>spectrophotometers</b> <b>total</b> column <b>ozone</b> measurements shows agreement within ± 5  % for >  70  % of the profiles. Very good agreement is also found in the stratosphere between ozonesonde profiles and profiles retrieved from the Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet Instruments (SBUV) ...|$|R
