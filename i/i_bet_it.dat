'I'm proud to be guilty, I've been a bad boy again.' Around that time, I fell under the spell of Merle Haggard's songwriting. There was a period there when he just seemed to be churning out some really great stuff.

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 73, based on 14 reviews, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews". Pitchfork said the album evoked a [...] "recipe of fairground waltzes, ghosted lullabies, and woodland hymnals" [...] and compared {{the work of}} the duo to Mazzy Star, Spiritualized and Slowdive. AllMusic said the album is [...] "one of the most mystical indie-pop surprises to arrive in 2006." [...] Giving the album a positive review, LAS Magazine said the album was made for [...] "made for gray days indoors or late August afternoons spent lying in golden fields staring at blue skies," [...] while comparing it to Yo La Tengo's album And Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside-Out. Almost Cool said [...] "it sounds like a late summer album, but it's just dark enough that <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> <b>it</b> will sound nice looking out the window to a dusting of snow on the ground as well." [...] Dusted Magazine said it is [...] "a dream of an album."

6000|$|At another camp, a packer {{was telling}} of an immense nugget {{that had been}} {{discovered}} somewhere on the upper waters of Birch Creek.

On the very high ground next to Birch, you can look down over that lake and <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> <b>it's</b> sixty miles long. It must reach nearly to Teslin Lake." [...] There was something pretty fine in the thought of being in a country where lakes sixty miles long were being discovered and set forth on the maps of the world. Up to this time Atlin Lake itself was unmapped. To an unpractical man like myself it was reward enough to feel the thrill of excitement which comes with such discoveries.|$|R

30|$|By advocating {{empirical}} linguistics research, I do {{not mean}} to undermine the value of a traditional study of language and the power of human intuition. As is the case in biology, the two approaches to the study of language should complement, rather than contradict, each other. The depth of treatment of indirect reports in Capone (2010, 2012, 2014), for instance, cannot be easily quantified today, yet <b>I</b> <b>bet,</b> <b>it</b> will guide some quantitative research of the future—form grounds for novel, quantitative analysis. The other way round, the results of quantitative research can well serve to inform classical linguistic propositions. For instance, the Zipf kind of relationship describing the distribution of many types of linguistic data, characterizes most of self-organizing systems, indicating strongly that language is a self-organizing system, too. This in turn, lets one eliminate some, and support other theories of language.|$|E
40|$|Transcription begins] 19 December 1944 Somewhere in Germany My most {{precious}} jewel, Thank goodness, I’ve just finished distributing all the PX {{supplies to the}} battery so now I can sit quietly, I hope, and write my darling a letter. The mailman was very kind to me today, bringing me two air mail letters from you dated 9 and 10 of Dec., a letter from Sylvan, {{a letter from the}} Hamburgs, and believe it or not, an EMF message from you dated 5 Nov. The long time for transmission was no doubt due to the fact I moved about so quickly. Darling, your letter explaining your new set-up was very enlightening and modestly I say, “I’m darn proud of you. ” Sweetheart, I have so many mixed emotions concerning you. I respect your opinion, I’m crazy about your cooking, I admire your ability to handle children, to understand peoples [sic] for what they are, and last but not least, your ability to be a perfect lover. Seriously, it’s very easy to love you—requires absolutely no effort on my part whatsoever. Sweetheart, you do have a big job and loads of responsibility but I’m happy that you have been given the opportunity to run your own nursery in the way {{you want it to be}} run. Golly, <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> <b>it</b> was some job putting your nursery into operation. I got fatigued merely reading about all the work that had to be done on the house. Your thumbnail sketches describing your help is [sic] excellent. I feel I would know them were I to meet them on the street. I particularly liked your description of Mrs. Kramer and the reference to her eating all the food. Sweetheart, I do wish that you consider your health along with your job. After all, when I come home I want to find a virile, healthy wife who is capable of making “violent love. ” If you think that your evening work at the Recreation Center is too much in addition to your present job, I wish that you [would] quit this work. Remember, I want you to keep busy but please don’t sacrifice health to obtain the objective. Today I went into town to get a shower or bath. I sat in that bath tub for 40 minutes—it was de-lovely. After the bath I went about the town to purchase some Christmas tree decorations, but I couldn’t find any. You might be interested to know that the stores in the town close for 2 hrs. every afternoon (just like Mexico—remember how we used to spend our siesta!). I acquainted myself with a young man who was a manager in the department store and after speaking with him for an hour he said, “You speak the best German I have yet heard an American speak. ” (I don’t imagine he spoke with many Americans.) Leaving the store I bump[ed] into our boy, Capt. Shaw 2 ̆ 6 Forest (B Btry) conversing with a rather nice looking woman (40 years). They introduced me to her and [I] learned that she was a native of Holland, got a college education in England, and taught English in Holland. At the present time she was [sic] working with the Americans in the office of civil affairs. She spoke English perfectly and naturally excellent German. I spoke both German and French to her and surprisingly she understood me perfectly. Gee, maybe I am getting good. Who knows? There’s a rather strained feeling existing in some parts of Holland but which isn’t apparent in our section. Contrary to France and some of the other formerly occupied countries, there are still left in Holland many young [D]utch men. These young men have seen the young girls swept off their feet by the dashing Americans who have food and sweets and resent it. (I don’t blame them.) The Dutch, you know, are very moralistic peoples so the church (Catholic) has come out forbidding that Dutch girls go out with American soldiers. It’s a local problem which doesn’t mean much one way or another especially to me. It’s interesting tho. I purchased some Dutch cards which I’m sending you. They should be cute in the nursery. Sylvan’s letter (12 Dec.) indicates that he has has [sic] received our photo Xmas cards and like them. He tells that he has heard all about the “Railsplitters” and is surprised at the record. He wishes us both a happy New Year and that we be together next year—amen! Darling, these people who have the attitude concerning the war, i. e., Mrs. Hicks, disgust me. In fact I have to control myself from “vomiting. ” When will the American people wake up? Please pass on my opinion of these people if the situation presents itself. Sometimes I wonder, “Have these kids out here died in vain?” When will the damned American people realize that this is total war? I’m glad you sent a package to Capt. Shaw. He’s a good Joe. When you mentioned spare ribs—you made my mouth water. I remember those delicious spare ribs, honey, you could put out—mmm! Darling, other than the above nothing happened. We just rolled dice to see who takes out the letters—the regular mail has gone out. Shelton lost. Goodnight, darling. I love you with my whole being. Vic [Transcription ends...|$|E

Rather hard upon your audience, you may say; but without wishing to be personal, <b>I</b> dare <b>bet</b> <b>it</b> is more interesting than your usual small talk.

I had met some one at a table d'hote or elsewhere who made some remark about the prehistoric remains in the valley of the Somme. I knew all about those, and showed him that I did. I then threw out some allusion to the rock temples of Yucatan, which he instantly picked up and enlarged upon. He spoke of ancient Peruvian civilization, and I kept well abreast of him. I cited the Titicaca image, and he knew all about that. He spoke of Quaternary man, and I was with him all the time.

And when it comes to beauty--and goodness, too--she lays over them all. I hain't ever seen her since that time that I see her go out of that door; no, I hain't ever seen her since, but I reckon I've thought of her a many and a many a million times, and of her saying she would pray for me; and if ever I'd a thought it would do any good for me to pray for HER, blamed if I wouldn't a done it or bust.|$|R
