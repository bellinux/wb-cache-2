40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new learning algorithm for {{the diagnosis of}} breast cancer. The proposed algorithm with novel network architecture can memorize training patterns with 100 % retrieval accuracy as well as achieve high generalization accuracy for patterns which it has never seen before. The grey-level and BI-RADS features (radiologists’ interpretation) from digital mammograms are extracted and used to train the network with the proposed learning algorithm. The new learning algorithm has been implemented and tested on a DDSM Benchmark database. The proposed approach has out performed other existing approaches interms of classification rate, generalization and memorization abilities, number of iterations, fast and <b>guaranteed</b> <b>training.</b> Some promising results and a comparative analysis of obtained results are included in this paper...|$|E
40|$|Training neural {{networks}} is a challenging non-convex optimization problem, and backpropagation or gradient descent can {{get stuck in}} spurious local optima. We propose a novel algorithm based on tensor decomposition for <b>guaranteed</b> <b>training</b> of two-layer {{neural networks}}. We provide risk bounds for our proposed method, with a polynomial sample complexity in the relevant parameters, such as input dimension and number of neurons. While learning arbitrary target functions is NP-hard, we provide transparent conditions on the function and the input for learnability. Our training method is based on tensor decomposition, which provably converges to the global optimum, under a set of mild non-degeneracy conditions. It consists of simple embarrassingly parallel linear and multi-linear operations, and is competitive with standard stochastic gradient descent (SGD), in terms of computational complexity. Thus, we propose a computationally efficient method with guaranteed risk bounds for training neural networks with one hidden layer. Comment: The tensor decomposition analysis is expanded, and the analysis of ridge regression is added for recovering the parameters of last layer of neural networ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractEmigration {{has contributed}} to a {{shortage}} of doctors in many sub-Saharan African countries. Specialty training is highly valued by doctors and a potential tool for retention. Yet not all types of training may be valued equally. In the first study to examine preferences for postgraduate training in depth, we carried out a discrete choice experiment {{as part of a}} cross-sectional survey of all Malawian doctors within seven years of graduation and not yet in specialty training. Over August 2012 to March 2013, 148 doctors took part out of 153 eligible in Malawi. Despite evidence that specialty training is highly sought after, Malawian junior doctors would not accept all types of training. Doctors preferred timely training outside of Malawi in core specialties (internal medicine, general surgery, paediatrics, obstetrics & gynaecology). Specialty preferences are particularly strong, with most junior doctors requiring nearly double their monthly salary to accept training all in Malawi and over six-fold to accept training in ophthalmology (representing a bundle of unpopular but priority specialties). In contrast, the location of work before training did not significantly influence most doctors' choices when <b>guaranteed</b> specialty <b>training.</b> Using a latent class model, we identified four subgroups of junior doctors with distinct preferences. Policy simulations showed that these preferences could be leveraged by policymakers to improve retention in exchange for <b>guaranteed</b> specialty <b>training,</b> however incentivising the uptake of training in priority specialties will only be effective in those with more flexible preferences. These results indicate that indiscriminate expansion of postgraduate training to slow emigration of doctors from sub-Saharan African countries may not be effective unless doctors' preferences are taken into account...|$|R
30|$|One of {{the major}} aspects of ANN is the {{training}} process, which can be either supervised or unsupervised. In this study, the former was used for prediction approach. It is the most widely applied in geophysical fields (van der Baan and Jutten 1992; Poulton 2002). Supervised learning, i.e. guided learning by “teacher”; requires a training set which consists of input vectors and a target vector associated with each input vector. The advantage of supervised training is that the output can be interpreted based on the training values.

40|$|Empirical risk {{minimization}} offers well-known learning <b>guarantees</b> when <b>training</b> {{and test}} data {{come from the}} same domain.

In this work we give uniform convergence bounds for algorithms that minimize a convex combination of source and target empirical risk. The bounds explicitly model the inherent trade-off between training on a large but inaccurate source data set and a small but accurate target training set. Our theory also gives results when we have multiple source domains, each of which may have a different number of instances, and we exhibit cases in which minimizing a non-uniform combination of source risks can achieve much lower target error than standard empirical risk minimization. ...|$|R

40|$|This licentiate report {{attempts}} {{to add to}} our knowledge of how the competence of skilled workers {{can be incorporated into}} modern manufacturing systems, without depriving them of the status that they had earned through their previous specialised skills and knowledge. The work is concentrated on establishing a theoretical basis for a model of how the computer can support this work: the Operator's Computer approach has been applied in three case-studies, thus taking it over the threshold into the Swedish engineering industry. The work has shown that the operator's computer serves as a tool for communication in two directions: -	as a link between man and machine (programming the robot[s] and manufacturing process[es]) : -	as a link for coordinating the operator's skills, knowledge and experience with those of other personnel categories (working with the designers and the work planners). The report emphasises that when new technology is to be introduced, it should be considered as a matter of conscious policy, which part the practical knowledge and experience should play, and how it should be valued and best utilised. It is shown that the practical knowledge and skills of the skilled workers, with a significant content of tacit knowledge, can be incorporated into the new production system by <b>guaranteeing</b> <b>training</b> to the workers and ensuring that they are given a new skilled role to play and a proper place in a cross functional working team. The question is how this practical, but unarticulated, knowledge can be transferred from individuals to machines and organisations, refined into articulated as well as scientific knowledge and contribute to further development of technology. This is an area in which the targetboard model of knowledge intensive engineering teams can be helpful. It also shows that the belief is no longer true, that the development of the production technology and corresponding ways to organising the work should inevitably deskill the work. On the contrary, the computer puts reskilling back on to the agenda by: -	eliminating the operators' constant tie to the machine; -	releasing human skills and resources for more advanced work; -	bringing different tasks together and enriching the work content, and -	facilitating decentralising of responsibilities and authorisations...|$|R
