5|$|A close {{binary star}} system occurs when two stars orbit {{each other with}} an average {{separation}} that is of the same order of magnitude as their diameters. At these distances, more complex interactions can occur, such as tidal effects, transfer of mass and even collisions. Tidal interactions <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>close</b> binary system can result in modification of the orbital and rotational parameters. The total angular momentum {{of the system is}} conserved, but the angular momentum can be transferred between the orbital periods and the rotation rates.|$|E
5|$|Albert and his elder brother, Ernest, {{spent their}} youth <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>close</b> {{companionship}} marred by their parents' turbulent marriage and eventual separation and divorce. After {{their mother was}} exiled from court in 1824, she married her lover, Alexander von Hanstein, Count of Polzig and Beiersdorf. She presumably never saw her children again, and died of cancer {{at the age of}} 30 in 1831. The following year, their father married his own niece, his sons' cousin Princess Antoinette Marie of Württemberg; their marriage was not close, however, and Antoinette Marie had little—if any—impact on her stepchildren's lives.|$|E

5|$|Amalthea is <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>close</b> {{orbit around}} Jupiter and {{is within the}} outer edge of the Amalthea Gossamer Ring, which is formed from dust ejected from its surface. From its surface, Jupiter would appear 46.5 degrees in diameter. Amalthea is the largest of the inner {{satellites}} of Jupiter. Irregularly shaped and reddish in color, it is thought to consist of porous water ice with unknown amounts of other materials. Its surface features include large craters and ridges.|$|E
5|$|Arriving in Brisbane for the Commonwealth Games, Brooks {{and some}} of his fellow sprinters shaved their heads, {{something}} that received much attention from the Australian public. He won his heat of the 100m freestyle in a Commonwealth and Commonwealth Games record of 51.09s. He swam slower in the final, but his time of 51.14s was enough to secure the gold medal <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>close</b> contest. Just 0.43s separated him and the bronze and silver medallists Greg Fasala and Michael Delany, both of Australia.|$|E
5|$|Each team progressed {{through four}} rounds {{to reach the}} final. Manchester City were a First Division team chasing a league and cup double; Bolton Wanderers were a mid-table Second Division team. Consequently, most {{observers}} anticipated a Manchester City win. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>close</b> match featuring strong defensive play, Manchester City won 1–0. The goal, scored by Billy Meredith, was disputed by those with Bolton sympathies, who believed Meredith to be offside. The victory gave Manchester City their first major honour.|$|E

5|$|Many {{expected}} Jeter {{would win}} the AL MVP Award for 2006. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>close</b> vote, Jeter {{finished second in the}} voting to Justin Morneau of the Twins. It was his sixth top-10 finish in the MVP balloting in 11 full seasons through 2006. Though he lost the MVP Award, he won the Hank Aaron Award, given for superior offensive performance. He also won his third consecutive Gold Glove Award.|$|E
5|$|McCain's {{comeback}} plan {{paid off}} {{when he won the}} New Hampshire primary on January 8, defeating former Governor of Massachusetts Mitt Romney <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>close</b> contest, to once again become one of the front-runners in the race. In mid-January, McCain placed first in the South Carolina primary, narrowly defeating Mike Huckabee. Pundits credited the third-place finisher, Tennessee's former U.S. Senator Fred Thompson, with drawing votes from Huckabee in South Carolina, thereby giving a narrow win to McCain.|$|E

5|$|Nixon {{entered his}} name on the New Hampshire primary ballot on January 5, 1972, {{effectively}} announcing his candidacy for reelection. Virtually assured the Republican nomination, the President had initially expected his Democratic opponent to be Massachusetts Senator Ted Kennedy (brother of the late president), but he was largely removed from contention after the 1969 Chappaquiddick incident. Instead, Maine Senator Edmund Muskie became the front runner, with South Dakota Senator George McGovern <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>close</b> second place.|$|E
5|$|Pest {{control of}} the jack jumper ant is {{successful}} in maintaining their populations around suburban habitats. Chemicals like bendiocarb, chlorpyrifos, diazinon and permethrin are effective against them. Spraying of Solfac into nests is an effective way of controlling nests if they are <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>close</b> range of areas with considerable amounts of congestion and human activity. Pouring carbon disulfide into nest holes and covering entrances up with soil is another method of removing colonies. The Australian National Botanic Gardens has an effective strategy of marking and maintaining jack jumper nests.|$|E

5|$|Sixty-year-old Crawford {{had been}} {{reluctant}} to volunteer, but he did so {{at the request of}} General Irvine. Williamson, although popular with the militia, was in disfavor with regular army officers such as Irvine because he had allowed the Gnadenhütten massacre. Hoping to avoid a repetition, Irvine made it known that he favored Crawford's election as commander. The election, which was acrimonious, ended <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>close</b> vote: Crawford received 235 votes to Williamson's 230. Colonel Crawford took command, and Williamson became second-in-command with the rank of major. The other majors included John B. McClelland, Thomas Gaddis, and either James Brenton or Joseph Brinton.|$|E

Expectations were high for the Hokies to repeat their ACC championship performance the next year, and a preseason poll of media covering ACC football resulted in Virginia Tech being picked to face Florida State in the inaugural ACC Championship Game.|$|E
50|$|Outgassing can be {{significant}} if it collects <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>closed</b> environment where air is stagnant or recirculated. For example, new car smell consists of outgassed chemicals released by heat <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>closed</b> automobile. Even <b>a</b> nearly odorless material such as wood may {{build up a}} strong smell if kept <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>closed</b> box for months. There is some concern that plasticizers and solvents released from many industrial products, especially plastics, may be harmful to human health. Long-term exposure to solvent vapors can cause chronic solvent-induced encephalopathy (CSE). Outgassing toxic gases are of great concern {{in the design of}} submarines and space stations, which must have self-contained recirculated atmospheres.|$|R

5|$|Ultra-stripped supernovae {{occur when}} the {{exploding}} star has been stripped (almost) {{all the way to}} the metal core, via mass transfer <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>close</b> binary. As a result, very little material is ejected from the exploding star (~0.1 MSun). In the most extreme cases, ultra-stripped supernovae can occur in naked metal cores, barely above the Chandrasekhar mass limit. SN 2005ek might be an observational example of an ultra-stripped supernova, giving rise to a relatively dim and fast decaying light curve. The nature of ultra-stripped supernovae can be both iron core-collapse and electron capture supernovae, depending on the mass of the collapsing core.|$|E
