5|$|I {{had that}} beat {{actually}} {{before she got}} to the studio. So she came in, she heard that beat and was like, 'Yeah, that's what I want.' That {{was one of the first}} records we had. I didn't really know what to do for her because I didn't hear nothing else that was on the album, but I <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> like she didn't have that bounce on her album.|$|E
5|$|It {{had a big}} impact. He was a {{founding}} member and really created the vocal style we are known for. <b>Just</b> <b>felt</b> like part of the band died too. Like when he died, it was just weird to think about doing shows or recording without him around, {{even if he was}} no longer in the band. He was a good person and definitely deserves to be remembered.|$|E
5|$|Absolutely. There's a {{song called}} 'Army of Me,' {{which is sort of}} a 'Fighter 2.0.' There is a new {{generation}} of fans from a younger demographic that might not have been with me all the way but that watch me on the show now. I feel like every generation should be able to enjoy and have their piece of 'Fighter' within. This time, the way it musically came together it <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> right for this time and this generation. There's {{always going to be a}} fighter in me getting through some obstacle and some hurdle. All these 6-year-olds who know me from pushing my button and turning around in a big red chair who weren't around for the actual 'Fighter,' this is my chance to recharge it, rejuvenate it and do something modernized for them.|$|E
6000|$|Maisie, with Sir Claude's hands {{still on}} her shoulders, <b>felt,</b> <b>just</b> as she <b>felt</b> the fine {{surrender}} in them, that {{over her head}} he looked {{in a certain way}} at Mrs. Wix. [...] "You needn't do that," [...] she heard him say. [...] "She has means." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pooh, what's {{thirty miles}} an hour!" [...] {{declared}} the fun-loving Rover, who <b>just</b> then <b>felt</b> like [...] "letting out." [...] "You know this machine can make fifty and better, Dick." ...|$|R

5|$|Bonass {{came into}} the team at outside-right for the fifth game of the new season, before {{reverting}} to outside-left against Sheffield Wednesday on 17 September, which coincided with Chesterfield's first win. Two weeks later, he scored the only goal of the game at home to West Ham United direct from a corner kick. He kept his place {{to the end of}} the year, but then played only three times before the end of February when he submitted a transfer request. The Derbyshire Times reported no disharmony between club and player, who <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> that different surroundings might help a return to form. He moved on to London club Queens Park Rangers (QPR) in June, and played in all three of their matches before the 1939–40 Football League season was abandoned when war broke out.|$|E
25|$|In small circles Kohl was {{fascinating}} {{and a perfect}} host; the larger the crowd, the vaguer, weaker and paler he appeared. His gaze into TV cameras made him look helpless. When attacked, e.g. in election campaigns, he became a good fighter. But in general he was no great orator, his speeches were lengthy and verbose. Additionally, the catholic with his Palatinate dialect, a folksy man who had culture but was simply no intellectual - to North German journalists (like from the important newspapers made in Hamburg) he <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> foreign, more than any previous CDU chairman.|$|E
25|$|Whether Norie-Miller {{simply did}} not take to {{political}} life, or found it clashed too greatly with his business responsibilities or if he <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> {{he was too old}} at 76 to give Parliament its proper attention, he decided not to contest the 1935 general election in November that year. There had clearly been some confusion about his candidacy and its joint support by local Liberal and Conservative Associations. Shortly before the election, a Captain Harry Houldsworth, looked set to contest the seat as a National Conservative but suddenly withdrew claiming he had misunderstood the local position and in the belief that Norie-Miller wished to continue. There was division in the Conservative ranks about whether to renew support for Norie-Miller. On 26 October, Norie-Miller did withdraw from the electoral race, citing medical reasons and the confusion of the position but the Unionists did not re-select Captain Houldsworth as their man, turning instead to Thomas Hunter, who was described in The Times newspaper as the Lord Provost of Perth and who could also rely on Liberal support. So no Liberal candidate of any stripe contested the 1935 general election in Perth which was won by the Unionists in a straight fight with Labour.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh," [...] said Grace, [...] "I liked you! I {{was young}} and felt I was {{entitled}} to love a man who loved me, if I wanted, but couldn't use my right. Then, not long since, when you were so grave and <b>just,</b> I <b>felt</b> I had been cheated worse." ...|$|R
500|$|Appearing on Nikita {{would be}} Q's first {{television}} role. During {{an interview with}} IGN, Q explained {{that she had not}} been on television before [...] "not because I didn't want to. I just never thought about it," [...] adding [...] "When this came up, everything <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> right. I knew McG and when Wonderland came on he was like, 'This is you, we're not doing this without you.' and I went 'That's very sweet!' So it felt right." ...|$|E
500|$|The band {{decided to}} forgo working with Butch Vig, who had {{produced}} the group's previous albums, and selected Flood and Alan Moulder as co-producers. Corgan explained, [...] "To be completely honest, I {{think it was}} a situation where we'd become so close to Butch that it started to work to our disadvantage... I <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> we had to force the situation, sonically, and take ourselves out of normal Pumpkin recording mode. I didn't want to repeat past Pumpkin work." ...|$|E
500|$|Chabon was {{ambivalent}} about his new-found fame. He turned down offers {{to appear in}} a Gap ad and to be featured as one of Peoples [...] "50 Most Beautiful People." [...] He later said, of the People offer, [...] "I don't give a shit ... I only take pride in things I've actually done myself. To be praised for something like that is just weird. It <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> like somebody calling and saying, 'We want {{to put you in}} a magazine because the weather's so nice where you live.' " ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Margaret, {{looking into}} the fire. [...] "That is <b>just</b> what I <b>felt</b> about them all the evening.... Particularly Dr. Tumpany." ...|$|R

500|$|In August that year, Harrison {{set off for}} {{a driving}} holiday around Europe without Boyd, a trip that Huntley {{describes}} as [...] "the first publicly visible signs" [...] of problems in the Harrisons' marriage. While in Portugal, Harrison stayed with his musician friend Gary Wright, who, Huntley suggests, [...] "play the diplomat" [...] by telling the press: [...] "He's writing lots of new things {{and he seems to}} be having a good time... Sometimes he takes Pattie with him, but I feel he <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> like a holiday and wanted to get away." ...|$|E
500|$|Many of {{the songs}} are written {{from the point of}} view of a protagonist, which emerged from an early idea of turning the record into a concept album - as guitarist Stone Gossard explained, [...] "we did {{consider}} using narration to thematically unify the album, but ultimately a less conceptual structure <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> right." [...] Vedder added that using characters in the tracks helped with the themes, as the stories could [...] "transmit an emotion or a feeling or an observation of modern reality rather than editorializing, which we've seen plenty of these days".|$|E
500|$|American reggae and hip hop artist Matisyahu regards It Was Written {{as one of}} his {{influences}} as well. He {{cites the}} introduction of It Was Written, in which slaves rebel against their owner, as having a major influence on him. According to The Washington Post, [...] "Matisyahu, too, felt enslaved. By what? He didn't know. <b>Just</b> <b>felt</b> the chains. The lyrics rocked him. The beat did, too." [...] Matisyahu stated that after listening to It Was Written, [...] "I connected with hip-hop, the hardness of it, the driving beat. It’s music with space, that has gaps in every little thing that happens." ...|$|E

500|$|Magma {{was officially}} {{released}} through Roadrunner Records to a generally favorable critical reception, scoring a 79 on Metacritic. The album marked {{a change in}} style for the band, with Joe Duplantier experimenting with clean vocals, and with Mario commenting that [...] "this time, we <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> all together that we wanted something straight to the point more. We wanted to change the dynamic." [...] The band will tour North America with Tesseract from mid-July through October 2016 {{in support of the}} album. In 2016, the band will tour the United Kingdom with Alter Bridge, Volbeat, and Like a Storm.|$|E
500|$|Screenwriters Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, who {{had worked}} on the two {{previous}} Transformers films, declined to return for the third film, with Kurtzman declaring that [...] "the franchise is so wonderful that it deserves to be fresh, all the time. We <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> like we'd given it a lot and didn't have an insight for where {{to go with it}} next". Revenge of the Fallens co-writer Ehren Kruger became the sole screenwriter for Dark of the Moon. Kruger had frequent meetings with Industrial Light & Magic's (ILM) visual effects producers, who suggested plot points such as the scenes in Chernobyl.|$|E
500|$|... "It's confusing. I felt {{a little}} let down with my {{releases}} from Aphrodite. I was caught out {{like a lot of}} artists were, with record companies figuring out how to do single releases these days. I remember doing a promo for one of the last singles and it <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> really old-fashioned. I'm pretty computer-savvy, something didn't feel right, but no one said anything to me. You get Britney releasing [...] "Hold It Against Me" [...] and Gaga's [...] "Born This Way" [...] available on iTunes the day you hear it first. That's how it should be. And there's me waiting for a mid-week chart figure like it's 1989." ...|$|E

6000|$|In {{this view}} {{it did seem}} improbable, and Mrs. Lapham was shaken. She could only say, [...] "Penelope <b>felt</b> <b>just</b> the way I did about it." ...|$|R
500|$|After the match, St Johnstone {{caretaker}} manager Sandy Stewart {{declared his}} interest in becoming the permanent manager but admitted {{he had already been}} offered the job as assistant manager to Owen Coyle at Burnley, which he later confirmed. Reflecting on his decision to go to Burnley, Stewart mentioned: [...] "It was a tricky decision... but, football-wise, I <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> it was too good an opportunity to turn down." [...] Dunfermline manager Stephen Kenny praised his team's efforts after the game but admitted that poor defending had resulted in the defeat. Kenny was sacked as manager a week later due to continuing poor league results and was replaced by player Jim McIntyre.|$|E
500|$|Blige further {{revealed}} that the song would be released as a single but was delayed due to Beyoncé's pregnancy at that time adding that, [...] "whenever she's ready, if she's ever ready, I'm ready and it'll be great." [...] During an interview with Rap-Up magazine, Garrett further spoke about the collaboration, saying, [...] "I initially did the record for Beyoncé and then we <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> {{it would be an}} even bigger record with Beyoncé and Mary J. Blige... Both these women are two iconic female figures in the world, and what would be better than putting those two on a record? We felt it would be a really iconic move." ...|$|E
500|$|I've {{been in a}} {{reflective}} state of mind. I've done lot of soul searching and I <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> in a romantic mood when I was writing for [...] so that's what I wrote about... I decided that I {{wanted to work with}} a whole bunch of different producers. [...] Björk's album was one of my favorite for years—it's brilliantly produced. And I also wanted to work with Massive Attack. So obviously, he was on the list. Nellee was the last person I worked with, and it wasn't until then that I got a grip of what the sound of the whole record was, so I had to go back and redo a lot.|$|E
6000|$|That was, oddly enough, <b>just</b> how I <b>felt.</b> [...] "Do you not not know, sweetest, why I {{kiss you}} in that way? Because I love you." ...|$|R

60|$|Joe's heart {{went out}} to him in sudden gratitude, for the strange feeling came to him that of those on board, to 'Frisco Kid, and to 'Frisco Kid only, could he look for help in time of need. Already a dislike for French Pete was growing up within him. Why, he could not say; he <b>just</b> simply <b>felt</b> it.|$|R
