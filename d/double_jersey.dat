40|$|Abstract – The aim of {{the study}} is to clarify the EMF {{shielding}} effectiveness (SE) of textiles with metallized yarns depending on their combinations and the position of samples with respect to the radiation source. For developing of the samples 3 types of metallized threads were used. Single and <b>double</b> <b>jersey</b> samples were made with manual flat knitting machines (gauges E 7 and E 10). To measure SE, two methods were used. The samples were placed between the radiation source and the detector and radiated with frequencies of 1. 161 GHz and 870 MHz. The average result of SE is 92 % for all knitted fabrics produced in this study...|$|E
30|$|In {{order for}} a better {{performance}} {{it is inevitable that}} mechanical parameters should tend to maximum value. Thus, the fitness function is defined as reverse value of mechanical properties. Generally, the number of individuals remained constant in each generation and the best surviving ones and the ones with lower fitness value were eliminated in each generation. In the chromosome producing, the first and the second genes which were related to knit ratio and miss ratio, got a value of two totally. Therefore, for <b>double</b> <b>jersey</b> fabrics with 100  % knit, two was considered for the first gene and zero for the second gene. Consequently, for single jersey fabrics with 100  % knit, one and zero were considered for the first and the second genes correspondingly.|$|E

40|$|Compact yam {{production}} {{technology has}} been introduced during {{the decade of the}} nineties in the textile production chain. The compact spun yams when compared to the conventional ring spun yams are less hairy and they offer higher breaking strength and elongation. This particular performance is in general desirable from the end product point of view. However, the specific structure of the compact spun yams may affect the micromechanical behaviour of the produced fabric resulting in different hand feeling. The present work focuses on the evaluation of the micromechanical properties of fabric samples made of conventional and compact spun yams. The measurements were made using the Kawabata Evaluation System for Fabrics. The results cover three types of knitted structures: Single Jersey, <b>Double</b> <b>Jersey</b> and Interlock.

40|$|This {{study was}} to develop a new {{structure}} of <b>double</b> <b>jersey</b> warp knitted fabric with effective water absorption and transport property which contributes to comfortable wear condition. Objective measurements in terms of vertical wicking, wetting time, air resistance, water vapor permeability as well as fabric handle were utilized to evaluate the comfort property of fabrics. This study demonstrated that the fabric knitted in plant structure had faster initial water transport rate, faster water absorbency speed, quicker vertical wicking rate, lower air resistance and better handle than the conventional control fabric. Furthermore, sweating manikin test suggests that polo-shirt made with plant structured fabric had lower evaporative resistance and thermal resistance against conventional warp knitted garment under 2. 2 m/s wind speed. Besides, wear trial was performed in hot and normal office condition. The subjective test result suggested that plant structured garment is more comfortable than the conventional garment in terms of skin temperature and humidity under sitting and walking.

40|$|Highquality {{sportswear}} {{should meet}} certain criteria. Sportswear should be comfortable, which means to enable {{freedom of movement}} and a nice touch. The customer expects his clothing to be endurable, that is during its “existence”, to remain the same dimension and be resistant to attrition. One of the main requirements about the sportswear is managing the moisture-fast evaporation and drying, so the body will feel dry and comfortable. The athletes who wear clothes with optimal comfort attain better results. Over the last few years, there has been growing interest in knitted fabrics due to its simple production technique, low costs and high level of clothing comfort. In this paper {{the influence of the}} structural properties and the raw content on the thermo physiological comfort, that is, influence on the air permeability, water vapour permeability and thermal characteristics were investigated, as well as the impact on physical-mechanical properties of knitted fabrics for sportswear. The results showed that every knitted structure has different characteristics concerning the thermo-physiological comfort. The knitted structures with higher tightness factor and lower porosity have lower air permeability and water vapour permeability. <b>Double</b> <b>jersey</b> knitted structures, such as interlock and rib have remarkably higher values of thermal conductivity. Knitted structures with higher weight per unit area have higher values of thermal absorptivity. The raw material content has significant influence on the thermal characteristics and water vapour permeability, while its influence on the air permeability is lower concerning the structural characteristics. The results obtained showed that PES single jersey and rib 1 : 1 cotton knitted structure are marked with the best comfort for underwear; wool and PAN single jersey structures for outer wear against weather influences, and the two-layered knitted structures of cotton/PES will provide the best comfort for tracksuits.

50|$|Jersey is a {{knit fabric}} used {{predominantly}} for clothing manufacture. It was originally made of wool, {{but is now}} made of wool, cotton, and synthetic fibres. Since medieval times Jersey, Channel Islands, where the material was first produced, had been an important exporter of knitted goods and the fabric in wool from Jersey became well known. The fabric {{can be a very}} stretchy single knitting, usually light-weight, jersey with one flat side and one piled side. When made with a lightweight yarn, this is the fabric most often used to make T-shirts. Or it can be a <b>double</b> knitted <b>jersey</b> (interlock jersey), with less stretch, that creates a heavier fabric of two single jerseys knitted together to leave the two flat sides on the outsides of the fabric, with the piles in the middle. Jersey is considered to be an excellent fabric for draped garments, such as dresses, and women's tops.|$|R
