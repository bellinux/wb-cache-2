5|$|Only six times—in the 1932, 1933, 1961, 2005, 2007, and 2017 {{hurricane}} seasons—has {{more than}} one Category5 recorded hurricane formed. Only in 2005 have more than two Category5 hurricanes formed, and only in 2007 and 2017 <b>did</b> <b>more</b> than one make landfall at Category5 strength.|$|E
5|$|Designed without {{expansion}} joints, Time {{is one of}} a {{small number}} of outdoor sculptures made of reinforced pebble/concrete aggregate, few of which have been created since the 1930s. In 1936, Times weather-related cracks were repaired; further work occurred in 1955. The sculpture's subsequent repairs were followed by a rededication celebration in 1966. Although the sculpture received regular maintenance, early repair crews often <b>did</b> <b>more</b> harm than good, by using techniques such as sandblasting and patching cracks with rigid materials.|$|E
5|$|In {{her first}} year of service, Australia visited as many major Australian ports as {{possible}}, to expose the new navy to the widest possible audience and induce feelings of nationhood: naval historian David Stevens claims that these visits <b>did</b> <b>more</b> to break down state rivalries and promote the unity of Australia as a federated commonwealth than any other event. During late 1913, footage for the film Sea Dogs of Australia was filmed aboard the battlecruiser; the film was withdrawn almost immediately after first screening in August 1914 because of security concerns.|$|E

5|$|In late 2013 {{multiple}} copyright strikes {{were issued}} by Youtube against Dunne's videos {{for use of}} his own music, as well as against other users who had used his music in their videos with permission. All of the strikes were initiated by INDMUSIC, on behalf of TuneCore, the company that distributed Miracle of Sound's songs at the time. Though the incident was resolved successfully, Dunne commented that although TuneCore {{was trying to help}} artists, their efforts <b>did</b> <b>more</b> damage than good and that he depends on let's plays and gaming videos to spread and popularize his music by word of mouth.|$|E
5|$|John Sadler has {{described}} this expedition as 'like {{so many of}} its predecessors, fail to yield any significant results,' neither forcing the Scots onto a battlefield nor making any major territorial gains. Brown too {{has described}} the campaign as 'utterly futile.' Sadler has ascribed the Scottish success in part to their reliance on a Fabian strategy to wear out the English whilst avoiding direct confrontation. Henry's lacklustre campaign was condemned by contemporary observers, with Welsh chronicler Adam of Usk saying that the Scots <b>did</b> <b>more</b> damage to the English than {{had been done to}} them. Likewise, the Scotichronicon suggested that 'nothing worthy of remembrance was done' by their enemies.|$|E
5|$|Tensions {{between the}} older {{citizens}} of the Most Holy Redeemer Parish and the gays entering the Castro District were growing, however, and in 1973, when two gay men tried to open an antique shop, the Eureka Valley Merchants Association (EVMA) attempted {{to prevent them from}} receiving a business license. Milk and a few other gay business owners founded the Castro Village Association, with Milk as the president. He often repeated his philosophy that gays should buy from gay businesses. Milk organized the Castro Street Fair in 1974 to attract more customers to the area. More than 5,000 attended, and some of the EVMA members were stunned; they <b>did</b> <b>more</b> business at the Castro Street Fair than on any previous day.|$|E

5|$|The Grimaldi's {{occupation}} of their palace is also unusual because, unlike other European ruling families, {{the absence of}} alternative palaces and land shortages have resulted {{in their use of}} the same residence for more than seven centuries. Thus, their fortunes and politics are directly reflected {{in the evolution of the}} palace. Whereas the Romanovs, Bourbons, and Habsburgs could, and frequently did, build completely new palaces, the most the Grimaldi could achieve when enjoying good fortune, or desirous of change, was to build a new tower or wing, or, as they <b>did</b> <b>more</b> frequently, rebuild an existing part of the palace. Thus, the Prince's Palace reflects the history not only of Monaco, but of the family which in 1997 celebrated 700 years of rule from the same palace.|$|E
5|$|The {{subsequent}} Life article <b>did</b> <b>more</b> than {{provide the}} public with {{an image of the}} group, looking more like bankers than irascible. It placed the picture larger and before the pictures of the Metropolitans competition winning art works. It also reiterated the word advanced, echoing the Madison Avenue advertising speak of the day. The picture caption also referred to the protest as in keeping with avant-garde tradition, mentioning the Salon des Refusés of 1863 and the Ashcan School.|$|E
5|$|Things were {{different}} in the county matches. As Bradman wanted to keep Lindwall and Miller fresh for the Tests, he generally gave them a lighter workload against the weaker opposition in the county matches, and the three spinners Ring, Johnson and McCool <b>did</b> <b>more</b> of the work, especially as the 55-over rule did not apply outside the Tests. Ring did the second-most bowling outside the Tests, despite not being in Bradman's first-choice team. Bradman even used Hamence, a reserve batsman, to open the bowling at times, in order to rest his bowlers, {{and in the second}} match against Yorkshire, decided to bat for an extended period instead of going for a win, so that his bowlers could recuperate.|$|E

5|$|Well {{before the}} design was finalised, four ships were ordered in July 1943. Africa was {{originally}} ordered as an unnamed Audacious-class carrier, but {{the order was}} modified to a Malta-class ship on 12 July 1943. Malta, New Zealand and Gibraltar were all ordered three days later. New Zealand was originally ordered from Cammell Laird, but the contract was transferred to Harland and Wolff on 22 July 1944. The Admiralty ordered Vickers not to order any more material on 27 April 1944 and given that final drawings were never issued to the builders, {{it is unlikely that}} any of them actually <b>did</b> <b>more</b> than preliminary work. None of the ships were ever laid down and all of them were cancelled before the end of 1945.|$|E
5|$|White {{said that}} The Troubles in Northern Ireland induced {{him to write}} about the sort of world he would like to live in, and that he disliked war and militarists. As a youth he wanted to become a doctor, but had to go out to work. Hence he relied on {{epidemics}} and natural disasters to provide the conflicts that stories need to make them interesting. He credited his wife, who was an intensive care nurse at the height of The Troubles, for advice on medical details and for pointing out how padres often <b>did</b> <b>more</b> good than doctors for disturbed patients, which inspired The Genocidal Healer.|$|E
5|$|Although Scotland {{increasingly}} {{adopted the}} English language and wider cultural norms, its literature developed a distinct {{national identity and}} began to enjoy an international reputation. Allan Ramsay (1686–1758) laid the foundations of a reawakening of interest in older Scottish literature, as well as leading the trend for pastoral poetry, helping to develop the Habbie stanza as a poetic form. James Macpherson was the first Scottish poet to gain an international reputation, claiming to have found poetry written by Ossian, he published translations that acquired international popularity, being proclaimed as a Celtic equivalent of the Classical epics. Fingal written in 1762 was speedily translated into many European languages, and its deep appreciation of natural beauty and the melancholy tenderness of its treatment of the ancient legend <b>did</b> <b>more</b> than any single work {{to bring about the}} Romantic movement in European, and especially in German, literature, influencing Herder and Goethe. Eventually {{it became clear that the}} poems were not direct translations from the Gaelic, but flowery adaptations made to suit the aesthetic expectations of his audience.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-1980s, Valiente {{began writing}} an {{autobiography}} {{in which she}} focused on her own place within Wiccan history. It would be published by Hale in 1989 as The Rebirth of Witchcraft. In this work she did not dismiss the Murrayite witch-cult theory, but she did undermine the belief that Wicca was the survival of it by highlighting the various false claims made by Gardner, Cochrane, and Sanders, instead emphasising what she perceived as the religion's value for the modern era. She also provided a foreword for Witchcraft: A Tradition Renewed, a book published in 1990 by Hale. It had been written by Evan John Jones, {{a former member of}} the Clan of Tubal Cain who also lived in Brighton. Heselton has expressed the view that Valiente likely <b>did</b> <b>more</b> than this, and that she wrote a number of the chapters herself.|$|E
5|$|Scottish {{artists in}} the later eighteenth century were {{strongly}} influenced by the Enlightenment, which stressed rationalism and human inquiry, of which Scotland was a major centre of influence. Artists like Alan Ramsey formed The Select Society, with philosophers David Hume and Adam Smith and produced his Dialogue on Taste, which made a major contribution {{to the study of}} aesthetics. Scotland also played a major part in the origins of the Romantic movement through the publication of James Macpherson's Ossian cycle, which was proclaimed as a Celtic equivalent of the Classical epics. Fingal, written in 1762, was speedily translated into many European languages, and its deep appreciation of natural beauty and the melancholy tenderness of its treatment of the ancient legend <b>did</b> <b>more</b> than any single work to bring about the Romantic movement in European, and especially in German literature, influencing Herder and Goethe.|$|E
5|$|The Grameen Bank {{encourages}} {{its members}} to create a positive impact by becoming {{actively involved in the}} politics of their country. According to Muhammad Yunus's book, Banker to the Poor, Yunus commissioned his bank staff to encourage Grameen borrowers to vote; however, the staff were not to influence the voters' decisions on which political party to support. While all Grameen groups are required to exhibit a form of democracy (such as electing a chairperson and secretary), the Grameen staff were surprised to find that borrowers were thrilled with the opportunity to display their voting rights as citizens of Bangladesh in the 1991 national election. The work of the Grameen staff initiated a sharp increase in political activity which continued into the 1992, 1996, and 1997 elections. Since the Grameen Bank caters to women, the 1996 elections received more women voting than men, which led to the removal of political parties opposing women's rights. Not only <b>did</b> <b>more</b> women participate in political activism, but over 1,750 Grameen members, 268 male and 1,485 female, were elected to local offices in 1997.|$|E
