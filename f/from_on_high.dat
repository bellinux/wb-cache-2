The tape {{went on to}} sell over 1,000 copies in the Eugene and Portland areas, enabling the band to self-produce their debut LP Ferociously Stoned the following year. Fusing punk rock and jazz horns with funk grooves, the album garnered favorable comparisons to contemporaries Faith No More and the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Before it was even officially released, Ferociously Stoned became a regional best-seller, setting a record for advance sales in Eugene's record stores and then remaining {{for over a year}} on The Rockets Northwest Top Twenty list, helping expand the Daddies' touring reach to as far as Alaska and Los Angeles by 1992.|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to find out changing of hepatic glucose output in dependence of high monounsaturated and high polyunsaturated fat diet and possible direct action of insulin in hepatocytes. Hepatocytes were isolated by a collagenase perfusion technique and cultured for 24 h in M 199 serum-free medium. The glucose production in hepatocytes isolated <b>from</b> rats <b>on</b> <b>high</b> polyunsaturated fat diet, as well as those isolated <b>from</b> rats <b>on</b> <b>high</b> monounsaturated fat diet was significantly higher than in standard controls. Insulin significantly decreased glucose production but only in hepatocytes obtained <b>from</b> rats <b>on</b> <b>high</b> monounsaturated fat diet. On the other side energy expenditure was significantly <b>higher</b> in rats <b>on</b> <b>high</b> monounsaturated fat diet and significantly lower in rats <b>on</b> <b>high</b> polyunsaturated fat diet comparable with animals on standard diet. Monounsaturated fat in Mediterranean diet could have beneficial effect on the development of the metabolic syndrome by increasing insulin sensitivity and energy expenditure...|$|R

The word had been passed down <b>from</b> <b>on</b> <b>high,</b> probably from Mubarak himself, {{that there was no way}} that Batouti, the co-pilot, could have done this.

2500|$|Although many {{accused him}} of denying the divinity of Christ. The {{skepticism}} came because of the unorthodox views he held. He believed that Jesus fulfilled all the law under the Mosaic dispensation and after the last ritual (John's Baptism in water) He became clothed with power <b>from</b> <b>on</b> <b>high</b> {{to carry out his}} gospel ministry. He believed the outward manifestation of Jesus was unique to the Jews and that Jesus taught the imminent end of the age of Moses along with all physical outward ordinances, types and shadows. He believed Jesus to be the Christ or Son of God through perfect obedience to the Inner Light, and most commonly referred to him as our [...] "great pattern", encouraging others that they needed to grow in love and righteousness as he did to experience the gospel state.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{possible}} that the name of Daniel was chosen for the hero of the book because of his reputation as a wise seer in Hebrew tradition. Ezekiel, who lived during the Babylonian exile, mentioned him in association with Noah and Job (Ezekiel 14:14) as a figure of legendary wisdom (28:3), and a hero named Daniel (more accurately Dan'el, but the spelling is close enough for the two to be regarded as identical) features in a late 2nd millennium myth from Ugarit. [...] "The legendary Daniel, known from long ago but still remembered as an exemplary character... serves as the principal human [...] "hero" [...] in the biblical book that now bears his name"; Daniel is the wise and righteous intermediary who is able to interpret dreams and thus convey the will of God to humans, the recipient of visions <b>from</b> <b>on</b> <b>high</b> that are interpreted to him by heavenly intermediaries.|$|E
2500|$|Gilpin's {{watercolour}} {{technique has}} been compared to that of Alexander Cozens. Both texture and composition were important in a [...] "correctly picturesque" [...] scene. The texture should be [...] "rough", [...] "intricate", [...] "varied", or [...] "broken", without obvious straight lines. The composition should work as a unified whole, incorporating several elements: a dark [...] "foreground" [...] with a [...] "front screen" [...] or [...] "side screens", a brighter middle [...] "distance", and at least one further, less distinctly depicted, [...] "distance". A ruined abbey or castle would add [...] "consequence". A low viewpoint, which tended to emphasise the [...] "sublime", was always preferable to a prospect <b>from</b> <b>on</b> <b>high.</b> While Gilpin allowed that nature was good at producing textures and colours, it was rarely capable of creating the perfect composition. Some extra help from the artist, perhaps {{in the form of a}} carefully placed tree, was usually required.|$|E

The sketches starred Bruce McCulloch as Rod (the drummer), Mark McKinney as Herman (the bass player), and Kevin McDonald as the lead guitarist. A recurring theme was Rod's and Herman's abusive treatment of McDonald's character, {{the only one with}} talent.

2500|$|Quintus Smyrnaeus' The Fall of Troy tells that, while Endymion {{slept in}} his cave beside his cattle, [...] "Selene watched him <b>from</b> <b>on</b> <b>high,</b> and slid from heaven to earth; for passionate love drew down the immortal {{stainless}} Queen of Night." [...] The eternally sleeping Endymion was proverbial, but exactly how this eternal sleep came about and what role, if any, Selene {{may have had}} in it is unclear. According to the Catalogue of Women, Endymion {{was the son of}} Aethlius (a son of Zeus), and Zeus granted him the right to choose when he would die. A scholiast on Apollonius says that, according to Epimenides, Endymion, having fallen in love with Hera, asked Zeus to grant him eternal sleep. However, Apollodorus says that because of Endymion's [...] "surpassing beauty, the Moon fell in love with him, and Zeus allowed him to choose what he would, and he chose to sleep for ever, remaining deathless and ageless". Cicero seems to make Selene responsible for Endymion's sleep, so that [...] "she might kiss him while sleeping".|$|E

There was then a morning service, prayers and lessons, and a communion service. The choir, choirmaster and organist were supplied by the Parish Church. The choir sang the Venite, Te Deum and Jubilate, and Psalms 84, 122 and 132. The congregation joined in with the hymns Christ is our corner stone, We love the place, O God, and Pour out thy spirit <b>from</b> <b>on</b> <b>high.</b> Bearing {{in mind that the}} local population was very poor and had had little opportunity in their lives to attend church, the Bishop's sermon was based on Second Epistle to the Corinthians 4:18: [...] "We look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen, for the things which are seen are temporal, and the things which are not seen are eternal," [...] and he spoke at length about life after death and Jesus' work with the poor. Psalm 100 was sung, and the collection made £201 4s 11d.|$|E
