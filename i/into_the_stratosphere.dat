5|$|Above the troposphere, the {{atmosphere}} is usually divided <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>stratosphere,</b> mesosphere, and thermosphere. Each layer has a different lapse rate, defining {{the rate of change}} in temperature with height. Beyond these, the exosphere thins out into the magnetosphere, where the geomagnetic fields interact with the solar wind. Within the stratosphere is the ozone layer, a component that partially shields the surface from ultraviolet light and thus is important for life on Earth.

5|$|Aside {{from the}} {{hypothesized}} fire and/or nuclear winter effects, the impact would have inhibited photosynthesis {{by creating a}} dust cloud that blocked sunlight {{for up to a}} year.

5|$|The {{basic idea}} of {{numerical}} weather prediction is to sample {{the state of the}} fluid at a given time and use the equations of fluid dynamics and thermodynamics to estimate the state of the fluid at some time in the future. The main inputs from country-based weather services are surface observations from automated weather stations at ground level over land and from weather buoys at sea. The World Meteorological Organization acts to standardize the instrumentation, observing practices and timing of these observations worldwide. Stations either report hourly in METAR reports, or every six hours in SYNOP reports. Sites launch radiosondes, which rise through the depth of the troposphere and well <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>stratosphere.</b> Data from weather satellites are used in areas where traditional data sources are not available. Compared with similar data from radiosondes, the satellite data has the advantage of global coverage, however at a lower accuracy and resolution. Meteorological radar provide information on precipitation location and intensity, which can be used to estimate precipitation accumulations over time. Additionally, if a pulse Doppler weather radar is used then wind speed and direction can be determined.|$|E

40|$|The {{distribution}} {{and evolution of}} stratospheric CO 2  in response to the observed annual cycle, interannual variations, and long-term trends in tropospheric CO 2  is simulated with the GISS 23 layer stratospheric general circulation model. Carbon dioxide is a tracer of stratospheric transport which has essentially no local sources or sinks but still displays gradients due to the forcing at the surface. Consequently, observations of stratospheric CO 2, until recently limited to a few flask samples, but now included as high frequency in situ sampling in aircraft campaigns, provide a test of tracer transport in stratospheric simulations independent of model chemistry. In our model, CO 2  enters <b>the</b> <b>stratosphere</b> primarily through <b>the</b> tropical tropopause, where air parcels are effectively labeled in time by their CO 2 values (although not uniquely because of the cycles in tropospheric concentration). Parcels of differing ages are subsequently mixed in <b>the</b> <b>stratosphere.</b> Only when <b>the</b> growth is purely linear can the CO 2  offset in a parcel relative to the troposphere be interpreted as the average time since stratospheric air was last {{in contact with the}} troposphere, i. e., the “age” of <b>the</b> <b>stratosphere.</b> Our model is in qualitative agreement with multiyear averages of balloon soundings at northern mid- and high latitudes; <b>the</b> <b>stratosphere</b> at 30 km at mid-latitudes is about 4 years (6 ppm of CO 2) behind the troposphere.

Because this region is a transition between transport regimes characterized by different scales of dynamics, it is especially difficult to model realistically. Through comparisons of observations of ozone, carbon dioxide and water vapor with results from a chemistry and transport model using winds from a global meteorological assimilation system, we have established that the model provides a good representation of several important aspects of constituent behavior.

The data sets tend to agree that the annual average net mass flux for the Northern Hemisphere is about 1 P 10 kg/s.
