40|$|Aviation as a {{multitude}} of activities is meant to satisfy needs of its customers to overcome distance and time between any departure and arrival point in the world. Airlines and other aircraft operators (governments, armed forces, general aviation, and business aviation) differ in their structure depending on their size and services they provide. Some departments {{are to be found}} in larger airlines only. However, core departments, to every airline or aircraft operator, are flight operations department and engineering department. Sophistication and the size of these departments depend on the size of the system they are incorporated in. Business logistics of an airline consist of numerous distinctive activities and functions. These activities have to be planned and completed in synchronisation. The paper presents an overview to intelligent systems for the support to these activities with particular stress on flight operations and maintenance functions in a medium sized airline. Authors show how the approach to documentation management, as a part of logistics in the production of transportation service, has evolved since the early 1990 s when aviation has started to recognise the value of <b>digital</b> <b>technical</b> <b>data.</b> In light of this, authors analyse conceptual framework adopted by today's aircraft manufacturers towards their logistics activities supported by Internet as a new means of transferring data. The advent of new sophisticated pilot-machine interfaces and aircraft systems tends to increase the volume of the documentation describing these tools drastically. The paper communicates how operational documentation has to change to move towards a more easy and modern media. Intelligent systems that prove aviation entering a period where the "written book" is going to be complemented if not largely supplemented by the "electronic book" are presented from the early beginnings of digital data application to the most recent achievements...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe Rapid Acquisition of Manufactured Parts (RAMP) {{program is a}} Navy initiative {{to address the problems}} of high cost, growing leadtime and diminishing sources for spare parts. RAMP addresses this by developing <b>digital</b> parts <b>technical</b> <b>data</b> and computer integrated manufacturing (CIM) capability within the Navy and integrating this capability into the Navy's supply and weapons acquisition systems. Management will require timely, accurate cost and operational data to evaluate the efficiency of the RAMP facility and its effectiveness in achieving program goals. Traditional accounting and performance measurement systems produce inadequate data in a CIM environment. This thesis derives objectives for the facility from program goals and proposes measurements to assess the achievement of these. The measurements emphasize flexibility, quality, efficiency and support of RAMP program goals. [URL] United States Nav...|$|R
50|$|A <b>Technical</b> <b>Data</b> Management System (TDMS) is {{essentially}} a Document management system (DMS) pertaining to the management of technical and engineering drawings and documents. Often the data are contained in 'records' of various forms, such as on paper, microfilms or <b>digital</b> media. Hence <b>technical</b> <b>data</b> management is also concerned with record management involving <b>technical</b> <b>data.</b> Proper <b>Technical</b> Document Management Systems are essential for executions within large organisations with large scale projects involving engineering. For example, TDMS is a vital function for the successful management of Integrated Steel Plants (ISP), Automobile factories, Aero-space facilities, Infrastructure companies, City Corporations, Research Organisations, etc. In such organisations, Technical Archives or Technical Documentation Centres are created as central facilities for effective management of <b>technical</b> <b>data</b> and records.TDMS functions are {{similar to that of}} conventional archive functions in concepts, except that the archived materials in this case are essentially engineering drawings, survey maps, technical specifications, plant and equipment data sheets, feasibility reports, project reports, operation and maintenance manuals, standards, etc.|$|R

In order to handle and to find the hidden knowledge from huge data storage, data mining is very helpful right now. Text mining, network mining, multimedia mining, trend analysis are few applications of data mining. In text mining, there are variety of methods are proposed by many researchers, even though high precision, better recall are still is a critical issues. In this study, text mining is focused and conceptual mining model is applied for improved clustering in the text mining. The proposed work is termed as Meta data Conceptual Mining Model (MCMM), is validated with few world leading <b>technical</b> <b>digital</b> library <b>data</b> sets such as IEEE, ACM and Scopus.

30|$|Bert and Storaune (2009) {{studied a}} case study of drill string failure {{analysis}} in deep wells. A deep-well drill string failure study was conducted, which included a review of drill string-inspection reports, daily drilling reports, <b>digital</b> <b>data,</b> <b>technical</b> literature, and engineering analysis for the two wells. They considered a cumulative fatigue analysis (CFA) modeling technique taking into account specific well conditions. Their model indicated that drill string failures would occur across shallow doglegs mainly because of high hang-down loads combined with slow ROP. The results of the study {{led to the development of}} new deep-well design criteria and implementation of new drilling guidelines. The new guidelines included the use of look-ahead CFA modeling when approaching drill string endurance limits to minimize drill pipe-fatigue failures. Look-ahead CFA modeling and the new drilling guidelines were used on two subsequent deep wells in the area, leading to successful drilling to total depth (TD) of 18, 000  ft TVD without failure. One of the wells had a 1.4 °/ 100 -ft DLS (calculated based on 100 -ft survey spacing) at 1, 500  ft, and drill pipe shuffling was required to prevent drill string failure in the deep-hole section. The drill string-fatigue failure prevention guidelines apply to deep wells drilled worldwide (Bert and Storaune 2009).|$|R
