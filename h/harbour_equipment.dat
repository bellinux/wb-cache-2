2500|$|The Bombardons {{were large}} [...] by [...] cross-shaped {{floating}} breakwaters fabricated in steel that were anchored outside the main breakwaters {{that consisted of}} Gooseberries (block ships) and Phoenixes (concrete caissons). 24 bombardon units, attached to one another with hemp ropes, would create a [...] breakwater. During the storms {{at the end of}} June 1944 some Bombardons broke up and sank while others parted their anchors and drifted down onto the harbours, possibly causing more damage to the harbours than the storm itself. The design of the Bombardons was the responsibility of the Royal Navy while the Royal Engineers were responsible for the design {{of the rest of the}} Mulberry <b>harbour</b> <b>equipment.</b>|$|E
50|$|Assembling two Mulberry {{harbours}} the {{day after}} the landings on 7 June 1944 {{was one of the most}} remarkable engineering feats in history.A total of 1,500,000 tons of <b>harbour</b> <b>equipment</b> had to be brought across the channel in an operation involving 150 Allied tugs, and by D-Day 'plus 12', most of Lochner's concrete breakwaters were in position.|$|E
50|$|The {{appearance}} of the Schlachte on the woodcut (pictured) from c. 1550 clearly shows a quayside with timber reinforcement although a little later a stone structure was substituted. In 1557, the Schlachte officially {{became part of the}} city of Bremen. From 1600 to 1830, there was little change in the {{appearance of}} the Schlachte and the rare changes <b>harbour</b> <b>equipment</b> were to the great cranes. It stretched 450 m from St Martini Church to the Kornhaus. On the town side, it was bordered by a row of half-timbered houses.|$|E
25|$|Following {{restoration}} in the 1990s, this Victorian work yard {{is now a}} Scheduled Monument {{that includes}} several listed buildings. The <b>harbour</b> and its <b>equipment</b> are still actively maintained, and host a cooperative of boat builders.|$|R
50|$|In June 1943 the War Office {{set up a}} {{committee}} of civil engineers to advise {{on the design of}} the artificial <b>harbours</b> and the <b>equipment</b> to be used in them. Despite their early submissions to the War Office, neither Maunsell nor Hughes were appointed to the committee.|$|R
5000|$|In 1895, {{the name}} was changed to S. Luke and Co. Ltd, with {{directors}} Samuel Luke, Charles M. Luke, and John P. Luke (1882-1935). Products included 11 hydraulic cranes for Wellington <b>Harbour</b> Board, 1897 <b>equipment</b> for the Cape Palliser lighthouse, dairy machines, boilers, cooking ranges, (for which they held a patent) and gold dredges. One of the firm's [...] engines powered its machinery. Staff numbers ranged from 80 to 150.|$|R
50|$|The Bombardons {{were large}} 200 ft by 25 ft cross-shaped {{floating}} breakwaters fabricated in steel that were anchored outside the main breakwaters {{that consisted of}} Gooseberries (block ships) and Phoenixes (concrete caissons). 24 bombardon units, attached to one another with hemp ropes, would create a 1 mi breakwater. During the storms {{at the end of}} June 1944 some Bombardons broke up and sank while others parted their anchors and drifted down onto the harbours, possibly causing more damage to the harbours than the storm itself.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the efforts {{that have been}} made during the development of a set of harbour training simulators to improve their quality. The paper focuses on two main research lines: the improvement of complex physical systems involved in the simulation and the analysis of hardware architecture solutions. Cable-based hoist systems and bulk materials are systems present in different <b>harbour</b> <b>equipment</b> and are usually simulated with poor quality due to their complexity. In this paper physics-based models for the interactive simulation of these systems are proposed and applied to real cases. Also, different hardware simulator architectures are analysed and different approaches are proposed to the problem of choosing the devices for a simulator...|$|E
40|$|Microbial anodes were {{constructed}} with stainless steel electrodes under constant polarisation. The seawater medium was inoculated {{with a natural}} biofilm scraped from <b>harbour</b> <b>equipment.</b> This procedure led to efficient microbial anodes providing up to 4 A/m 2 for 10 mM acetate oxidation at − 0. 1 V/SCE. The whole current {{was due to the}} presence of biofilm on the electrode surface, without any significant involvement of the abiotic oxidation of sulphide or soluble metabolites. Using a natural biofilm as inoculum ensured almost optimal performance of the biofilm anode {{as soon as it was}} set up; the procedure also proved able to form biofilms in fully aerated media, which provided up to 0. 7 A/m 2. The current density was finally raised to 8. 2 A per square meter projected surface area using a stainless steel grid. The inoculating procedure used here combined with the control of the potential revealed, for the first time, stainless steel as a very competitive material for forming bioanodes with natural microbial consortia...|$|E
50|$|A more {{accurate}} system named Hi-Fix was developed using signalling in the 1.6 MHz range. It {{was used for}} specialised applications such as precision measurements involved with oil-drilling and by the Royal Navy for detailed mapping and surveying of coasts and <b>harbours.</b> The Hi-Fix <b>equipment</b> was leased for a period with temporary chains established to provide coverage of the area required, Hi-Fix was commercialised by Racal Survey in the early 1980s. An experimental chain was installed with coverage of central London and receivers placed in London buses and other vehicles to demonstrate an early vehicle location and tracking system. Each vehicle would report its location automatically via a conventional VHF two-way radio link, the data added to a voice channel. A forerunner to a system employed by London black cabs in the 1990s using GPS and now {{the widespread use of}} GSM, 3G and Wi-Fi geolocation applications.|$|R
40|$|Purpose – Construction {{plant and}} <b>equipment</b> <b>harbour</b> {{significant}} {{health and safety}} hazards. One particular item, the mini-excavator, presents a hazard from its inherent instability and tendency to overturn during use. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to investigate turnover incidents to observe prominent factors and contribute to development of best practice guidance for improving health and safety relating to mini-excavator use. Design/methodology/approach – Comprehensive documentary data from eight case study incidents, along with anecdotal data from a further three, were qualitatively analysed in terms of: machine weight, machine activity, ground type/topography, operator competence, type of overturn, damage to property, and injury to person(s). Results were presented to experts in the field for comment and conclusions/recommendations accordingly developed. Findings – Observed prominent casual factors include: inadequate assessment of risk and non-adherence to safe working practice, working on poor ground, and working on inclined surfaces. The use of sealed operator cabs and proprietary seat restraint mechanisms seem to mitigate risk of personal injury to operators during overturn incidents. A need for cyclic training to reiterate good operator and banksman practice is emphasised, while construction managers should also be aware of the risks, and help implement risk controls. Research limitations/implications – Findings will inform construction plant management research generally, and the subject of mechanised workplace transport stability specifically. Practical implications – Best practice protocol will inform health and safety management of mini-excavators at the workplace. Originality/value – Academic research into mini-excavator stability is embryonic; this paper furthers evolving knowledge in the field...|$|R
