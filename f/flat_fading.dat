50|$|SFN {{transmission}} {{can be considered}} as a severe form of multipath propagation. The radio receiver receives several echoes of the same signal, and the constructive or destructive interference among these echoes (also known as self-interference) may result in fading. This is problematic especially in wideband communication and high-data rate digital communications, since the fading in that case is frequency-selective (as opposed to <b>flat</b> <b>fading),</b> and since the time spreading of the echoes may result in intersymbol interference (ISI). Fading and ISI can be avoided by means of diversity schemes and equalization filters.|$|E

50|$|Since {{different}} frequency {{components of}} the signal are affected independently, {{it is highly unlikely}} that all parts of the signal will be simultaneously affected by a deep fade. Certain modulation schemes such as orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) and code division multiple access (CDMA) are well-suited to employing frequency diversity to provide robustness to fading. OFDM divides the wideband signal into many slowly modulated narrowband subcarriers, each exposed to <b>flat</b> <b>fading</b> rather than frequency selective fading. This can be combated by means of error coding, simple equalization or adaptive bit loading. Inter-symbol interference is avoided by introducing a guard interval between the symbols. CDMA uses the rake receiver to deal with each echo separately.|$|E
50|$|In {{a recent}} study, a novel {{collaborative}} multi-user transmission and detection scheme called collaborative CDMA {{has been investigated}} for the uplink that exploits the differences between users' fading channel signatures to increase the user capacity well beyond the spreading length in MAI-limited environment. The authors show {{that it is possible}} to achieve this increase at a low complexity and high bit error rate performance in <b>flat</b> <b>fading</b> channels, which is a major research challenge for overloaded CDMA systems. In this approach, instead of using one sequence per user as in conventional CDMA, the authors group a small number of users to share the same spreading sequence and enable group spreading and despreading operations. The new collaborative multi-user receiver consists of two stages: group multi-user detection (MUD) stage to suppress the MAI between the groups and a low-complexity maximum-likelihood detection stage to recover jointly the co-spread users' data using minimal Euclidean-distance measure and users' channel-gain coefficients.|$|E
5000|$|Narrowband RF (radio frequency) {{channels}} {{with low}} power and long wavelengths (i.e., low frequency) are affected primarily by <b>flat</b> <b>fading,</b> and PPM is better suited than M-FSK {{to be used}} in these scenarios. One common application with these channel characteristics, first used in the early 1960s with top-end HF (as low as 27 MHz) frequencies into the low-end VHF band frequencies (30 MHz to 75 MHz for RC use depending on location), is the radio control of model aircraft, boats and cars, originally known as [...] "digital proportional" [...] radio control. PPM is employed in these systems, with the position of each pulse representing the angular position of an analogue control on the transmitter, or possible states of a binary switch. The number of pulses per frame gives the number of controllable channels available. The advantage of using PPM for this type of application is that the electronics required to decode the signal are extremely simple, which leads to small, light-weight receiver/decoder units. (Model aircraft require parts that are as lightweight as possible). Servos made for model radio control include some of the electronics required to convert the pulse to the motor position - the receiver is required to first extract the information from the received radio signal through its intermediate frequency section, then demultiplex the separate channels from the serial stream, and feed the control pulses to each servo.|$|E
