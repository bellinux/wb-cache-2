40|$|The {{subject of}} this study is the {{analysis}} of three different diffuser configurations in a centrifugal compressor stage for a jet engine application. The nominal geometric configuration of the diffusing system contained a unique type of passage diffuser, a pipe diffuser, and a <b>deswirler</b> with axial prismatic vanes. In the second configuration, the pipe diffuser was radially truncated by approximately half its diametral extent. In a third step, the downstream <b>deswirler</b> was redesigned. To adapt the <b>deswirler</b> to the new diffuser, a tandem design with two stator rows was introduced. For the experimental investigations, a state-of-the-art centrifugal compressor test rig was used. It is located at the Institute of Jet Propulsion and Turbomachinery and was built up in cooperation with General Electric Aviation. In this study, the effects of the three configurations on the stage performance are investigated. These differences are explained by local flow phenomena. For this purpose, detailed measurements with multi-hole probes, unsteady pressure transducers and particle image velocimetry (PIV) have been performed. Finally, the impact on the whole system of a jet engine is analyzed. It was found that the diffuser truncation increases the centrifugal stage performance by 0. 3 % and enlarges the surge margin by 10 %. PIV measurements show a significantly decreased flow separation in the diffuser passage. The changed flow direction due to the diffuser truncation implies, however, an increased incidence flow angle to the <b>deswirler</b> causing extensive losses. This higher incidence angle was the motivation for the <b>deswirler</b> redesign. The first row of this tandem <b>deswirler</b> was introduced into the channel bend {{for the first time in}} a test rig. It is shown that the tandem <b>deswirler</b> has lower total pressure losses and thus an improved static pressure rise compared to the nominal <b>deswirler.</b> These lower <b>deswirler</b> losses result in an additional increase of the centrifugal compressor stage efficiency of 1 %. Moreover, the relative position of the two tandem rows is investigated. An optimal clocking position regarding stage efficiency and static pressure rise was found. This study gives fundamental insight into the aerodynamic mechanisms of the influence of three geometric configurations in a centrifugal compressor stage, especially in the pipe diffuser and the <b>deswirler.</b> Thus, this study is highly beneficial in furthering knowledge of the fundamental principles of the flow phenomena in the diffusing system of a centrifugal compressor...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{represents}} an experimental {{investigation of a}} compact aero engine centrifugal compressor stage with pipe-diffuser and tandem <b>deswirler</b> in which the vanes of the first deswirl row are immerged into the diffuser channel. This geometrical arrangement eliminates a vaneless space between diffuser and <b>deswirler,</b> which is present in current conventional centrifugal compressor stages and can result into much lower outer stage diameters. In addition to the nominal centered alignment of the first deswirl row vanes within the diffuser channel, {{a variation of the}} circumferential positioning of the <b>deswirler</b> towards diffuser suction and pressure side was conducted. Furthermore, a bleed extraction between impeller and diffuser was varied. For a comparison of the compact compressor stage to conventional stage designs, additionally three compressor stages with vaneless space between diffuser and <b>deswirler</b> were experimentally investigated, whereas each stage contained a different deswirl system. Impeller and diffuser inlet geometry of all four stages were the same. The study demonstrates that the compact centrifugal compressor stage reaches similar performance values in terms of pressure build-up and efficiency as the stages with decoupled deswirlers. In comparison to a conventional stage with simple one row prismatic deswirl vanes, the compact stage even shows a significant increase in performance. However, the compact stage looses surge margin compared to all three reference stages. Also, a shift of the characteristics of the different stage components was detected. The impeller of the compact stage shows a slightly higher pressure build-up and slightly lower work input. Furthermore, the diffuser inlet shows a significant increase in pressure build-up which is linked to the loss in surge margin. Within the diffuser channel the pressure build-up is lower due to the lower dynamic head at the channel inlet. This results from the increased diffusion at the diffuser inlet. The three-dimensionally designed deswirlers of the compact stage and of two reference stages are showing equal characteristics, whereas the pressure build-up of the <b>deswirler</b> of the last reference stage with prismatic vanes is significantly decreased and the total pressure loss increased. With a total-to-static stage balancing, a variation of the circumferential positioning of the <b>deswirler</b> to the diffuser of the compact compressor stage shows very small changes in pressure build-up and efficiency. However, the surge margin increases from suction to pressure sided positioning of the <b>deswirler</b> relative to the diffuser. With a total-to-total balancing of the stage, the pressure sided positioning of the <b>deswirler</b> relative to the diffuser shows the smallest losses but also the highest Mach-numbers at the stage exit...|$|E
40|$|In {{the work}} {{presented}} here, a detailed aerodynamic analysis of an aero engine centrifugal compressor is given. Steady and unsteady 3 D-RANS simulations, {{as well as}} extensive experimental data {{have been used for}} the analysis. The compressor investigated contains a close-coupled pipe-diffuser. A radial-axial <b>deswirler</b> guides the air into the combustion chamber. The investigation presented gives a detailed insight in the loss mechanisms as well as their origin within the centrifugal compressor. In the past, the aerodynamic loss mechanisms within the centrifugal compressor were discussed on a phenomenological basis. In this work, the loss mechanisms are identified by analyzing the irreversible entropy production. The single loss mechanisms are quantified, enabling consolidated statements on the potential improvement, as well the approach on how to reduce the losses induced. An investigation of four different diffuser concepts is given, representing the time-wise evolution of the diffusion system towards a higher efficiency, increased stall margin and smaller outer diameter. Within the original diffusion system, a flow separation in the pipe-diffuser results in a thick shear layer {{with a high level of}} entropy production. By truncating the pipe diffuser, the large flow separation is prevented. The original downstream <b>deswirler</b> is not matched with the truncated pipe-diffuser's discharge flow. In order to increase the compressor’s efficiency, two 3 D <b>deswirler</b> designs using a single row and tandem rows respectively, are compared. The lower efficiency found for the tandem blade design is not in agreement with the established design rules for two-dimensional compressor blades with a high diffusion factor. This outcome can be traced back to the high impact of the end-wall effects for the low-aspect-ratio <b>deswirler</b> designs investigated. The unsteady investigation demonstrates the change in loss production due to unsteadiness. The decrease in isentropic efficiency due to unsteadiness within the impeller is traced back mainly to the unsteady tip clearance flow, induced by the diffusor’s potential field. Within the diffuser, counteracting unsteady mechanisms are found and discussed in detail...|$|E
