50|$|They are {{commonly}} used in speaker crossover design (due to the moderately large voltages and currents, {{and the lack of}} easy access to a power supply), filters in power distribution networks (due to the large voltages and currents), power supply bypassing (due to low cost, and in some cases, power requirements), as well as a variety of discrete and home brew circuits (for low-cost and simplicity). Passive filters are uncommon in monolithic integrated circuit design, where active devices are inexpensive compared to resistors and capacitors, and inductors are prohibitively expensive. Passive filters are still found, however, in <b>hybrid</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>circuits.</b> Indeed, it may be the desire to incorporate a passive filter that leads the designer to use the hybrid format.|$|E
50|$|Thick film {{technology}} {{is often used}} as the interconnecting medium for <b>hybrid</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>circuits.</b> The use of screen printed thick film interconnect provides advantages of versatility over thin film although feature sizes may be larger and deposited resistors wider in tolerance. Multi-layer thick film is a technique for further improvements in integration using a screen printed insulating dielectric to ensure connections between layers are made only where required. One key advantage for the circuit designer is complete freedom {{in the choice of}} resistor value in thick film technology. Planar resistors are also screen printed and included in the thick film interconnect design. The composition and dimensions of resistors can be selected to provide desired values. The final resistor value is determined by design and can be adjusted by laser trimming. Once the hybrid circuit is fully populated with components, fine tuning prior to final test may be achieved by active laser trimming.|$|E

50|$|A {{common problem}} {{nowadays}} are 'dead' voice chips, {{in which one}} or more of the 6 available notes fail and sound silent, quiet, or crackly. The Juno-106 contains a custom <b>hybrid</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>circuit</b> for each of its six voices, the Roland 80017A VCF/VCA IC. Over time, these ICs tend to become intermittent or fail outright. Because they are no longer manufactured, third-party substitutes have become available. In recent years, some people have successfully repaired these hybrid ICs by removing the conformal coating of resin that is sometimes implicated in their failure. Numerous videos demonstrating this can be found on the internet.|$|R
