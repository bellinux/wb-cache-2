5|$|Evidence {{of attack}} {{may be found}} in the form of tiny piles of book-dust and specks of <b>frass.</b> Damage may be {{concentrated}} in the spine, the projecting edges of pages and the cover. Prevention of attack relies on keeping books in cool, clean, dry positions with low humidity, and occasional inspections should be made. Treatment can be by freezing for lengthy periods, but some insect eggs are very resistant and can survive for long periods at low temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere in town, {{a trio of}} {{teenagers}} drink beer and huff fumes generated from heated manure. One of them sees a roach crawl into an open wound on his wrist, and {{in an attempt to}} extricate the insect, he begins to frantically slice his skin with a razor, leading him to sever an artery and ultimately bleed to death. At the scene, Mulder talks over the phone with Scully, who explains that it is likely a case of drug-induced delusional parasitosis, though Mulder finds a cockroach on the underside of a piece of furniture, indicating that roaches were at least present. When he attempts to capture it for analysis, the insect crumbles in his hand and the sharp pieces cut his fingers in the process, leading him to believe that the brittle casing was made of metal. Sheriff <b>Frass</b> purports that the government, under the guise of the USDA, has been breeding killer cockroaches in a nearby facility. Immediately afterwards, the medical examiner is found dead in a bathroom stall, initially covered with cockroaches that disappear from the scene before more than one person can witness them. Scully attributes the medical examiner's death to a cerebral aneurysm induced by overstraining while defecating. Mulder and Sheriff <b>Frass</b> find a seemingly dead cockroach on a sink in the bathroom, and Mulder again attempts to capture it (albeit more gingerly this time), but it proves to be alive and escapes down the drain.|$|E
5|$|Mulder goes to {{investigate}} the facility Sheriff <b>Frass</b> mentioned. Before breaking in, he and Scully discuss the odd behavior of the roaches, with Scully hypothesizing that the roaches could be an invasive species. Inside the facility, which resembles a typical house, Mulder sees the walls rippling and is quickly surrounded by roaches. He is then confronted by Dr. Bambi Berenbaum (Bobbie Phillips), a researcher from the Department of Agriculture who is studying cockroaches to develop more effective methods of pest control. Berenbaum has great interest in insects and, incidentally, believes that some UFOs are actually insect swarms flying through electrically charged airspaces. Yet another death occurs in Mulder's hotel, with the individual being found covered in roaches that quickly flee. At this point, Mulder believes that the individual simply died of fright, though Scully begins to wonder {{what is going on}} and decides to head up there herself.|$|E
5000|$|Necaxa {{was founded}} on 21 August 1923. It began when Englishman William H. <b>Frasser,</b> an {{engineer}} {{and owner of the}} Light and Power Company (Compañía de Luz y Fuerza [...] ) in the state of Puebla, founded a football team. <b>Frasser,</b> as a student was a football player in the United Kingdom and was a strong advocate for the sport. <b>Frasser</b> consolidated the teams of the Light and Power Company and the Street Car operators Compañia de Luz y Fuerza and Tranvías into one.|$|R

25|$|The one {{exception}} to the supposed 'look but don't touch'-policy was the so-named boat no. 10, which was slowly appearing due to apparent soil erosion. For five days, archaeologists carefully examined the midsection of the ship. They uncovered wooden planks, disintegrated rope, and reed bundles. Wood-eating ants had reduced much of the ship's hull to <b>frass</b> (ant excrement), but the <b>frass</b> had retained {{the shape of the}} original hull. The midsection of this boat revealed the construction methods used and confirmed the oldest ‘planked’ constructed boat yet discovered. The boat's construction revealed it had been constructed from the outside in, as there was no internal frame. Averaging 75ft long and 7–10ft wide at their greatest width, these boats were only about two feet deep, with narrow prows and sterns. Several boats were white-plastered, as were the Abydos tombs, and no. 10 was painted yellow.|$|E
25|$|At least 20 {{species of}} roundheaded borers {{of the family}} Cerambycidae feed on the wood of spruce, fir, and hemlock (Rose and Lindquist 1985). Borers rarely bore tunnels in living trees, {{although}} when populations are high, adult beetles feed on tender twig bark, and may damage young living trees. One {{of the most common}} and widely distributed borer species in North America is the whitespotted sawyer (Monochamus scutellatus). Adults are found in summer on newly fallen or recently felled trees chewing tiny slits in the bark in which they lay eggs. The eggs hatch in about 2 weeks, and the tiny larvae tunnel to the wood and score its surface with their feeding channels. With the onset of cooler weather, they bore into the wood making oval entrance holes and tunnel deeply. Feeding continues the following summer, when larvae occasionally return {{to the surface of the}} wood and extend the feeding channels generally in a U-shaped configuration. During this time, small piles of <b>frass</b> extruded by the larvae accumulate under logs. Early in the spring of the second year following egg-laying, the larvae, about 30mm long, pupate in the tunnel enlargement just below the wood surface. The resulting adults chew their way out in early summer, leaving round exit holes, so completing the usual 2-year life cycle.|$|E

500|$|In Miller's Falls, Massachusetts, an exterminator {{inspects}} {{the basement}} of Dr. Jeff Eckerle, having been hired to eradicate a cockroach infestation. The exterminator sprays a roach, knocks {{it down to the}} ground, and attempts to crush it underfoot. However, upon doing so, he begins to succumb to anaphylaxis, clutching his heart and collapsing against a wall, while the roach crawls out from under his boot, unscathed. When Eckerle returns, he finds the exterminator's body covered with roaches. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) is coincidentally nearby, investigating reported UFO sightings in Miller's Grove. While on the phone with Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), Mulder is approached by the local sheriff, <b>Frass,</b> who reveals that a series of [...] "roach attacks" [...] have taken place in the town. <b>Frass</b> allows Mulder onto the scene at Eckerle's residence.|$|E

2500|$|Larvae are {{cylindrical}} and elongate {{and can be}} [...] {{long and}} [...] wide. Larvae first create a feeding gallery in the cambial region, but more mature larvae tunnel to the heartwood as they feed. Larvae go through at least five instars over 12 years; which can vary due to host or temperature conditions. Larvae expel <b>frass</b> from their tunnels near the original oviposition site. A larva can consume up to 1,000 cubic cm of wood in its lifetime. Asian long-horned beetle larvae do not pupate before they reach a critical weight, so additional larval instars can occur.|$|E
2500|$|Tree {{infestation}} can {{be detected}} by looking for exit holes 3/8 to 3/4inches in diameter (1–2cm) often in the larger branches of the crowns of infested trees. Sometimes sap can be seen oozing from the exit holes with coarse sawdust or [...] "frass" [...] in evidence {{on the ground or}} lower branches. Dead and dying tree limbs or branches and yellowing leaves when there has been no drought also indicate A. glabripennis infestation. Traps can also be used containing a pheromone and a plant kairomone to attract nearby adults. Some acoustic sensors can also differentiate larval feeding within trees. Dogs can also be trained to detect the smell of <b>frass</b> on trees.|$|E

50|$|Contact with <b>frass</b> causes {{plants to}} secrete {{chitinase}} {{in response to}} its high chitin levels. <b>Frass</b> is a natural bloom stimulant, and has high nutrient levels. <b>Frass</b> contains abundant amoebae, beneficial bacteria, and fungi. Accordingly, it is a microbial inoculant, in particular a soil inoculant, a source of desirable microbes, that promotes the formation of compost.

50|$|The larvae feed on Hydrangea arborea. They {{mine the}} leaves of their host plant.

The early gallery mine is much contorted in a small area and contains black <b>frass.</b> It ends in an elongate mine with blackish dispersed <b>frass.</b>|$|E
50|$|The larvae feed on Tristaniopsis collina. They {{mine the}} leaves of their host plant.

Later the mine widens gradually and becomes more contorted, with blackish or brownish <b>frass</b> coiled or in loose pellets filling about two thirds of mine width. The exit hole is located on the leaf upperside. Mines in the thinner leaves of Pistacia terebinthus consist of a narrow gallery throughout.
