50|$|There {{are several}} types of liners used in {{leachate}} control and collection. These types include geomembranes, geosynthetic clay liners, geotextiles, geogrids, geonets, and geocomposites. Each style of liner has specific uses and abilities. Geomembranes are used to provide a barrier between mobile polluting substances released from wastes and the groundwater. In the closing of landfills, geomembranes are used to provide a low-permeability cover barrier to prevent the intrusion of rain water. Geosynthetic clay liners (GCLs) are fabricated by distributing sodium bentonite in a uniform thickness between woven and non-woven geotextiles. Sodium bentonite has a low permeability, which makes GCLs a suitable alternative to clay liners in a composite liner system. Geotextiles are used as separation between {{two different types of}} soils to prevent contamination of the lower layer by the upper layer. Geotextiles also act as a cushion to protect synthetic layers against puncture from underlying and overlaying rocks. Geogrids are structural synthetic materials used in slope veneer stability to create stability for cover soils over synthetic liners or as soil reinforcement in steep slopes. Geonets are synthetic drainage materials that are often used in lieu of sand and gravel. Radz can take 12 in of drainage sand, thus increasing the landfill space for waste. Geocomposites are a combination of synthetic materials that are ordinarily used singly. A common type of <b>geocomposite</b> is a geonet that is heat-bonded to two layers of geotextile, one on each side. The <b>geocomposite</b> serves as a filter and drainage medium.|$|E

50|$|Work {{began in}} 2010, when the {{downstream}} {{face of the}} main dam was cleaned and loose concrete, efflorescence and other surface deposits were removed. The concrete face was then protected from further deterioration by using a cementitious repair mortar and siloxane waterproofer. The remedial works on the upstream face included the installation of a PVC <b>geocomposite</b> membrane, geonet drainage layer and associated drainage system to the upstream face of the main dam and the auxiliary overflow. The geomembrane is sealed on the concrete face along the foundation line and on the parapet wall 300 mm above the crest level to cover the joint between the upstream face and the parapet wall. The geomembrane covers a total surface area of 1,100m2.|$|E
50|$|When a {{geotextile}} {{is used on}} one or {{both sides}} of a geonet, the separation and filtration functions are always satisfied, but the drainage function is vastly improved in comparison to geotextiles by themselves. Such <b>geocomposites</b> are regularly used in intercepting and conveying leachate in landfill liner and cover systems and for conducting vapor or water beneath pond liners of various types.

40|$|A pullout {{apparatus}} {{was constructed}} {{to investigate the}} pullout response o f a conventional geogrid and a combined drainage/reinforcement <b>geocomposite</b> in a marginal fill under both consolidated and unconsolidated test conditions. The affect of confining stress, pullout rate and soil moisture content on the pullout response was investigated. The dissipation of pore water pressure in the soil mass around the geosynthetic strip was also studied. Pullout testing of the <b>geocomposite</b> was conducted in a standard and a small pullout cell. The pullout-displacement response for the conventional geogrid was jagged and irregular, which was attributed to surface roughness o f the geogrid. In contrast the <b>geocomposite</b> displayed a smooth pullout-displacement response. Higher confining stresses decreased the pullout resistance of the conventional geogrid but increased the pullout resistance o f the <b>geocomposite.</b> Increased moisture content was shown to decrease pullout resistance for all test parameters while increased pullout rate resulted in higher peak pullout resistances. Pullout resistance in consolidated samples {{was influenced by the}} volume o f water drained from the soil mass and the time allowed for consolidation. In unconsolidated tests the interface shear resistance ratios were found to be higher for the <b>geocomposite,</b> the ratio doubling for the <b>geocomposite</b> at high confining stress. Some interface shear resistance ratios for the <b>geocomposite</b> tests were in excess o f 1. 0 indicating a greater shear resistance at the soilgeosynthetic interface than for the soil alone. Interface shear resistance ratios for the <b>geocomposite</b> decreased for consolidated samples which was attributed to the improvement in the soils strength following consolidation being greater than the corresponding increase in peak pullout resistance. Higher rates o f pore pressure dissipation at high confining stress were attributed to larger hydraulic gradients in the soil near the <b>geocomposite</b> strip. Pore water pressure and soil moisture content both reduced by the greatest magnitude immediately in front o f the drain, with smaller reductions further away from the drain.

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} an RCC dam project {{where an}} exposed geomembrane system {{was installed in}} 2002 and has been successfully performing for now 13 years. The RCC dam, Miel I, is located in Colombia with 188 m high, and the dam is used for power production. The RCC mix has a cement content of 85 to 160 kg/m 3. To meet contractual schedule, the original design of an upstream face made of slip formed reinforced concrete was changed to a Carpi drained exposed PVC <b>geocomposite</b> system, placed on a 0. 4 m thick zone of RCC material enriched with cement grout and vibrated. Placement of the <b>geocomposite</b> system in horizontal stages allowed starting dam impoundment while RCC placement was still ongoing at higher elevation.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{behaviour}} of initially unsaturated soil–geocomposite layers in slopes {{subject to}} infiltration is investigated using numerical experiments. The post-infiltration performance is also studied. A series of transient finite element analyses of soil–geocomposite layers is conducted {{for a variety}} of soils, slopes and infiltration rates. The influence of these variables on the effectiveness of geocomposites as a drainage material and as a capillary barrier is discussed. The effect of entrapped air within a geotextile is also examined. This study shows that the <b>geocomposite</b> drains more water with a decrease in slope angle and an increase in infiltration rate (i. e. the <b>geocomposite</b> works as a capillary barrier for smaller infiltration rates and steeper slope of the soil–geocomposite layers). It is also shown that the soil immediately above the <b>geocomposite</b> becomes wet before the <b>geocomposite</b> starts draining water, and it remains wet for a relatively long period of time after the infiltration event...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{focus of}} this paper is on {{applications}} (e. g. some leachate collection layers in landfills) where a drainage system consists of a <b>geocomposite</b> overlain by a sand layer.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Marginal soils can be {{improved}} by introducing permeable geosynthetics as drainage layers. However, clogging of the geotextile pores causes significant reduction in drain capacity, which {{in the long run}} affects stability of the earth structures built up with poorly drained backfills. This paper reports performance of a geosynthetic drain layer placed within two fine-grained soil slurries. A multipurpose consolidation test device has been developed for this purpose. Test results demonstrated that thick <b>geocomposite</b> layers are good enough in draining out water escaped during consolidation. In order to reduce clogging, a combination thin sand mat and geosynthetic drain layer, which is called hybrid system, has been tested. Thin sand mat has been found effective in preventing finer grains from clogging the <b>geocomposite</b> layer. Bearing capacity tests on model embankments proved that hybrid system generates frictional interaction with the rough surface of the <b>geocomposite.</b> This study shows that hybrid system performs well as anti-clogging drain layer within fine-grained soil. ...|$|E

40|$|Hydraulic {{transmissivity}} is {{the most}} important design parameter of <b>geocomposites</b> used for in-plane drainage applications. This paper presents an in-depth investigation of the hydraulic behaviour of drain-tube planar <b>geocomposites</b> (DTPGs) and characterises the locations and causes of head losses based on a multiscale experimental approach using three different apparatus. In particular, a transmissivity rig that accommodates specimens up to 1 m 2 was developed to define the minimum representative surface area required to characterise DTPGs. The experimental data acquired in this study support a theoretical relationship linking head losses that occur within DPTGs to flow rate. This relationship is used to analyse the results obtained with other transmissivity rigs and to identify the key locations where head losses develop. In addition, evidence that Colebrook’s equation can be applied to corrugated tubes is presented. Based on this study, it is concluded that the measured DTPG transmissivity is significantly affected by specimen length and by the experimental device used to make the measurement. For example, the DTPG transmissivity measured in accordance with ASTM D 4716 - 08 was found to be 14 % lower than the actual DTPG transmissivity...|$|R
