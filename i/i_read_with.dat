2500|$|In 1933, Gavin, who had {{no desire}} to become an {{instructor}} for new recruits, was posted to the 28th and 29th Infantry Regiment at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, under the command of General Lesley J. McNair. He spent most of his free time in, as he called it, the [...] "excellent library" [...] of this fort, while the other soldiers spent most of their time partying, shooting, and playing polo. One author in particular impressed Gavin: J.F.C. Fuller. Gavin said about him: [...] " [...] saw clearly the implications of machines, weapons, gasoline, oil, tanks and airplanes. <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>with</b> avidity all of his writings." ...|$|E
2500|$|Crabbe's {{experience}} as Chaplain at Belvoir was not altogether happy. He {{was treated with}} kindness by the Duke and Duchess, but his slightly unpolished manners and his position as a literary dependent made his relations {{with others in the}} Duke's house difficult, especially the servants. However, the Duke and Duchess and many of their noble guests shared an interest in Crabbe's literary talent and work. During his time there, his poem The Village was published in May 1783, achieving popularity with the public and critics. Samuel Johnson said of the poem in a letter to Reynolds [...] "I have sent you back Mr. Crabbe's poem, which <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>with</b> great delight. It is original, vigorous, and elegant." [...] Johnson's friend and biographer James Boswell also praised The Village. It was said at the time of publication that Johnson had made extensive changes to the poem, but Boswell responded by saying that [...] "the aid given by Johnson to the poem, as to The Traveller and Deserted Village of Goldsmith, were so small as by no means to impair the distinguished merit of the author." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Darwin proved {{unable to}} persevere at medical studies, his father {{sent him to}} Christ's College, Cambridge, for a Bachelor of Arts degree {{as the first step}} towards {{becoming}} an Anglican parson. Darwin was at first uncertain, he later wrote: [...] "from what little I had heard and thought on the subject I had scruples about declaring my belief in all the dogmas of the Church of England; though otherwise I liked the thought of being a country clergyman. Accordingly <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>with</b> care 'Pearson on the Creed' and a few other books on divinity; and as I did not then in the least doubt the strict and literal truth of every word in the Bible, I soon persuaded myself that our Creed must be fully accepted. It never struck me how illogical it was to say that I believed in what I could not understand and what is in fact unintelligible. I might have said with entire truth that I had no wish to dispute any dogma; but I never was such a fool as to feel and say 'credo quia incredibile'. He was particularly convinced by the reasoning of the Revd. John Bird Sumner's Evidences of Christianity which set out the logic that the unbelief of sceptics gave them the dilemma that if Christianity were untrue, then either [...] "Jesus did not live, or he actually lived, but was not the Son of God, hence an imposter." [...] The Gospels made this highly improbable, as his miracles had convinced unbelievers, hence we had [...] "no right to deny" [...] that such events were probable. Jesus's religion was [...] "wonderfully suitable... to our ideas of happiness in this & the next world" [...] and there was [...] "no other way... of explaining the series of evidence & probability." ...|$|E

6000|$|All this, and a {{great deal}} more, had <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>with</b> {{profound}} interest, many years before my visit to the Cape, and the whole subject had made a deep impression on my memory--especially the figure of the gallant Bishop returning from his raid on the men-stealers with the little wearied Dauma on his shoulders! ...|$|E
60|$|At first <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>with</b> some {{constraint}} and shyness, but presently {{warming to}} my task and growing interested, I became animated and vivacious in my manner, {{so that when}} I ceased I saw her sitting there, her hands clasped about one knee, her eyes upon my face, her lips parted a little, the very picture of interest.|$|E
60|$|Since this {{paragraph}} was composed, <b>I</b> have <b>read</b> <b>with</b> so much pleasure, in Burnet's Theory of the Earth, a passage expressing corresponding sentiments, excited by objects {{of a similar}} nature, that I cannot forbear to transcribe it.|$|R

6000|$|... 'Oh yes,' said Elizabeth, {{speaking}} slowly, and pausing now and then; 'I {{remember her}} well; I sometimes fancy I {{can hear her}} voice and her step at night, when she used {{to come up to}} the nursery to see us in bed.

60|$|I owe you many {{apologies for}} having so long {{deferred}} thanking {{you for your}} poems, and your obliging letter accompanying them, which I received early in March.

Still I think <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>with</b> some sense of {{literature}} and the difference between authors. I don't suppose that people generally do that; I have met people who had read books without troubling themselves to find out even the author's name, much less trying to decide upon his quality.

60|$|They {{are both}} clever books; one in {{imitation}} of the days of chivalry; the other (by Horace Smith, {{one of the authors}} of the Rejected Addresses) dated in the time of the Civil Wars, and introducing historical characters. <b>I</b> <b>read</b> both <b>with</b> great interest during the journey.|$|R
