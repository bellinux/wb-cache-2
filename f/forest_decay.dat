50|$|Some {{reservoirs}} {{in tropical}} regions produce {{substantial amounts of}} methane. This is due to plant material in flooded areas decaying in an anaerobic environment, and forming methane, a greenhouse gas. According to the World Commission on Dams report, where the reservoir is large compared to the generating capacity (less than 100 watts per square metre of surface area) and no clearing of the forests in the area was undertaken prior to impoundment of the reservoir, greenhouse gas emissions from the reservoir may be {{higher than those of}} a conventional oil-fired thermal generation plant. There is a lack of knowledge in the scientific community regarding reservoir GHG emissions, producing many diverging positions. To resolve this situation, the International Energy Agency is coordinating an analysis of actual emissions.

Such treatments have the immediate effect of reducing forest carbon stocks but likely reduce future carbon losses through the combustion and mortality caused by high-severity wildfires. Assessing the long-term impact of fuel treatment on the carbon balance of fire-prone forests has been difficult because of uncertainties regarding treatment and wildfire impacts on any given landscape. In this study we attempt to remove some of the confusion surrounding this subject by performing a sensitivity analysis wherein long-term, landscape-wide carbon stocks are simulated under a wide range of treatment efficacy, treatment lifespan, fire impacts, forest recovery rates, <b>forest</b> <b>decay</b> rates, and the longevity of wood products.

40|$|Litter {{decomposition}} is an enzymatically-complex {{process that}} is mediated by a diverse assemblage of saprophytic microorganisms. It is a globally important biogeochemical process that can be suppressed by anthropogenic N deposition. In a northern hardwood forest ecosystem located in Michigan, USA, 20 years of experimentally increased atmospheric N deposition has reduced <b>forest</b> floor <b>decay</b> and increased soil C storage. Here, we paired extracellular enzyme assays with shotgun metagenomics to assess if anthropogenic N deposition has altered the functional potential of microbial communities inhabiting <b>decaying</b> <b>forest</b> floor. Experimental N deposition significantly reduced the activity of extracellular enzymes mediating plant cell wall decay, which occurred concurrently with changes in the relative abundance of metagenomic functional gene pathways mediating the metabolism of carbohydrates, aromatic compounds, as well as microbial respiration. Moreover, experimental N deposition increased the relative abundance of 50 of the 60 gene pathways, the majority of which were associated with saprotrophic bacteria. Conversely, the relative abundance and composition of fungal genes mediating the metabolism of plant litter was not affected by experimental N deposition. Future rates of atmospheric N deposition have favored saprotrophic soil bacteria, whereas the metabolic potential of saprotrophic fungi appears resilient to this agent of environmental change.

40|$|Abstract Background Coarse {{and fine}} woody debris are {{substantial}} forest ecosystem carbon stocks; however, {{there is a}} lack of understanding how these detrital carbon stocks vary across forested landscapes. Because forest woody detritus production and decay rates may partially depend on climatic conditions, the accumulation of coarse and fine woody debris carbon stocks in forests may be correlated with climate. This study used a nationwide inventory of coarse and fine woody debris in the United States to examine how these carbon stocks vary by climatic regions and variables. Results Mean coarse and fine woody debris forest carbon stocks vary by Köppen's climatic regions across the United States. The highest carbon stocks were found in regions with cool summers while the lowest carbon stocks were found in arid desert/steppes or temperate humid regions. Coarse and fine woody debris carbon stocks were found to be positively correlated with available moisture and negatively correlated with maximum temperature. Conclusion It was concluded with only medium confidence that coarse and fine woody debris carbon stocks may be at risk of becoming net emitter of carbon under a global climate warming scenario as increases in coarse or fine woody debris production (sinks) may be more than offset by increases in <b>forest</b> woody detritus <b>decay</b> rates (emission). Given the preliminary results of this study and the rather tenuous status of coarse and fine woody debris carbon stocks as either a source or sink of CO 2, further research is suggested in the areas of <b>forest</b> detritus <b>decay</b> and production. </p...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2008 Presentation date: 2008 - 03 - 20 This study {{considers}} trade-offs between {{timber harvest}} and carbon sequestration on National Forest {{and other public}} lands by contemporaneously linking a model of public harvest and inventory to a carbon accounting system. The public harvest model treats three harvest scenarios. The first minimizes the cost of meeting harvest requests that approximate current harvest policy. The second and third models represent two extremes of harvest policy: maximum strict even-flow scheme and noharvest. The current harvest scenario results in a maximum average net carbon sequestration of approximately 35 Teragrams per decade. The maximum strict evenflow scenario results in a maximum of 19 Teragrams of net carbon sequestration on an average decadal basis, because of losses to <b>forest</b> product <b>decay</b> and reduced understory growth.

40|$|The use of co‐occurrence {{patterns}} to investigate interactions between micro‐organisms has provided novel insight into organismal interactions within microbial communities. However, anthropogenic impacts on microbial co‐occurrence patterns and ecosystem function remain an important gap in our ecological knowledge. In a northern hardwood forest ecosystem located in Michigan, USA, 20  years of experimentally increased atmospheric N deposition has reduced <b>forest</b> floor <b>decay</b> and increased soil C storage.

When compared to the ambient treatment, the forest floor bacterial community under experimental N deposition was less rich, more phylogenetically dispersed and exhibited a more clustered co‐occurrence network topology.

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{analyzed}} the effects of silvicultural treatments on carbon (C) budgets in Pinus taeda L. (loblolly pine) plantations in the southeastern United States. We developed a hybrid model that integrated a widely used growth and yield model for loblolly pine with published allometric and biometric equations to simulate in situ C pools. The model used current values of forest product conversion efficiencies and <b>forest</b> product <b>decay</b> rates to calculate ex situ C pools. Using the model to evaluate the effects of silvicultural management systems on C sequestration over a 200 year simulation period, we concluded that site productivity (site quality), which can be altered by silviculture and genetic improvement, was the major factor controlling stand C density. On low productivity sites, average net C stocks were about 35 % lower than in stands with the default average site quality; in contrast, on high quality sites, C stocks were about 38 % greater than average productivity stands. If woody products were incorporated into the accounting, thinning was C positive because of the larger positive effects on ex situ C storage, rather than smaller reductions on in situ C storage. The use of biological rotation age (18 years) was not suitable for C sequestration, and extended rotation ages were found to increase stand C stock density. Stands with an 18 -year-rotation length had 7 % lower net C density than stands with a 22 -year-rotation length; stands with a 35 -year-rotation length had only 4 % more C than stands harvested at age 22 years. The C sequestered in woody products was an important pool of C storage, accounting for ~ 34 % of the average net C stock. Changes in decomposition rate, associated with possible environmental changes resulting from global climate change, affected C storage capacity of the <b>forest.</b> When <b>decay</b> rate was reduced to 10 % or increased to 20 %, the C stock in the dead pool (forest floor and coarse woody debris) was reduced about 11. 8 MgC∙ha− 1 or increased about 13. 3 MgC∙ha− 1, respectively, compared to the average decay rate of 15 %. The C emissions due to silvicultural and harvest activities were small (~ 1. 6 % of the gross C stock) compared to the magnitude of total stand C stock. The C model, based on empirical and biological relationships, appears appropriate for use in regional C stock assessments for loblolly pine plantation ecosystems in the southern U. S...|$|R

In the present research we investigated the correlation between the decay of logs, the decomposer microorganisms and their activities, in terms of GHG production and enzymes, in a black pine (Pinus nigra Arnold ssp. nigra) degraded forest. The decomposition of deadwood was visually assessed using a five-class system, and for each decay class four wood samples were collected.
