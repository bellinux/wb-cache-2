5|$|I sent MalcolmX {{some rough}} {{chapters}} to read. I was appalled {{when they were}} soon returned, red-inked in many places where he had told of his almost father-and-son relationship with Elijah Muhammad. Telephoning MalcolmX, I {{reminded him of his}} previous decisions, and I stressed that if those chapters contained such telegraphing to readers of what was to lie ahead, then the book would automatically be robbed of some of its building suspense and drama. MalcolmX said, gruffly, 'Whose book is this?' I told him 'yours, of course,' and that I only made the objection in my position as a writer. But late that night MalcolmX telephoned. 'I'm sorry. You're right. I was upset about something. Forget what I wanted changed, let what you already had stand.' I never again gave him chapters to review unless <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> Several times I would covertly watch him frown and wince as he read, but he never again asked for any change in what he had originally said.|$|E
500|$|... "Thank you, mister President-elect, for {{inviting}} me to your inauguration gala. I {{would like to take}} a moment from this very public ceremony to speak of something very personal. It concerns a dear friend of mine who is no longer with us. His name is Ryan White. He was a hemophiliac who was diagnosed with the AIDS virus when he was eleven. He died shortly after turning eighteen, the very time most young people are beginning to explore life's wonderful possibilities. My friend Ryan was a very bright, very brave, and very normal young man who never wanted to be a symbol or a spokesperson for a deadly disease. Over the years, I've shared many silly, happy, and painful moments with Ryan and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> {{at the end of his}} brief but eventful journey. Ryan is gone and just as anyone who has lost a loved one to AIDS, I miss him deeply and constantly. He is gone, but I want his life to have meaning beyond his passing. It is my hope, President-elect Clinton, that you and your administration commit the resources needed to eliminate this awful disease that took my friend, and ended so many promising lives before their time. This song is for you Ryan". - Michael Jackson, January 1993.|$|E
2500|$|Former Chelsea manager André Villas-Boas said, [...] "Daniel {{offers a}} few of the {{characteristics}} I had with Hulk when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> in Porto... He is an extremely quick player, and he has technique at pace." ...|$|E

6000|$|Eliz. What? is he captive? Why then--what of that? There {{are friends}} will rescue him--there's gold for ransom-- We'll sell our castles--live in bowers of rushes-- O God! that <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> in the dungeon! ...|$|R

2500|$|In an {{interview}} for [...] "Hotspur" [...] magazine, Merv reveals he has supported Tottenham Hotspur since the early 1980s. [...] "I went to a mate's house to watch the FA Cup Final, everyone {{in the house was}} supporting the other team except the guy I sat next to. He was English, and I told him <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> 100 per cent. Spurs won and I've supported them ever since." ...|$|E
2500|$|I had {{the honor}} to be Archbishop Elko's {{assistant}} for 3 years. He was a true son of Mary and loved our Lord and lived the life. In the last 2 years <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>with</b> <b>him,</b> we created a mission project entitled: [...] "ROSARIES AROUND THE WORLD". We shipped to over 40 countries {{and a total of}} over 1,000,000 Rosaries and Scapulars. They went from St. Mother Teresa to Fr. Malachy Brogan, OFM. He wrote me once saying: [...] "Jim, the Rosaries you sent are now found {{in the hands of the}} praying, the dying and the dead." [...] This was funded in total by the good Archbishop's brother and blessed by Archbishop Elko and St. Pope John Paul II.|$|E
2500|$|After 1995 Hussein became {{increasingly}} critical of Saddam's rule in Iraq. On 4November 1995 Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated by a Jewish extremist, who aimed to undermine Rabin's peace efforts with the Palestinians. Due to the close relationship forged with Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin during the negotiations of the treaty, Hussein {{was invited to}} give a speech during Rabin's funeral. The funeral, held in Jerusalem, was the first time Hussein had been in Jerusalem since 1967. Hussein drew parallels between Rabin's assassination and his grandfather's assassination in 1951: [...] "We are not ashamed, nor are we afraid, nor are we anything but determined to continue the legacy for which my friend fell, as did my grandfather in this city when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> and but a boy." ...|$|E
5000|$|Fifth Logion: [...] "Jesus saith, Wherever {{there are}} two, {{they are not}} without God; and {{wherever}} there <b>is</b> one alone, <b>I</b> say <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> Raise the stone and there thou shalt find me; cleave the wood, and there am I." ...|$|R

[...] "You know that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> always <b>with</b> <b>him</b> to {{the full extent of}} the time allowed, and that <b>I</b> should <b>be</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> all day long, if I could. And when I come away from him, you know that my {{thoughts}} <b>are</b> <b>with</b> him." ...|$|R
2500|$|Ram {{was trained}} by Ronen Moralli at the Israel Tennis Centers in Jerusalem. [...] "My first {{inspiration}} was Jo Jo Lizmi, the famous Jerusalem tennis coach, who showed {{me all the}} basic techniques. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> {{four or five years}} and he taught me everything – how to hold the racket, forehand, and backhand. He was very tough." [...] "But the man who really developed my game was Ronen Moralli", says Ram. [...] "He was with me in Jerusalem from when I was 10 years old, but then he moved to Wingate as the national coach." [...] Moralli recalls: [...] "When I worked with Andy at the Jerusalem Tennis Center he was very very energetic and full of passion. [...] His technical abilities weren't as good as the other kids, but he had an understanding of the game. It was something spectacular. [...] He knew when to come to the net, when to stay back. [...] This is something you are born with. [...] Either you have it or you don't. [...] You can teach it, but only up to a certain point, and Andy was born with it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Warhol was gay. Interviewed in 1980, he {{indicated}} {{that he was still}} a virgin—biographer Bob Colacello who was present at the interview felt it was probably true and that what little sex he had was probably [...] "a mixture of voyeurism and masturbation—to use his [...] word abstract". Warhol's assertion of virginity would seem to be contradicted by his hospital treatment in 1960 for condylomata, a sexually transmitted disease. It has also been contradicted by his lovers, including Warhol muse BillyBoy who has said they had sex to orgasm: [...] "When he wasn't being Andy Warhol and when you were just alone with him he was an incredibly generous and very kind person. What seduced me was the Andy Warhol who I saw alone. In fact when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> in public he kind of got on my nerves….I'd say: 'You're just obnoxious, I can't bear you." [...] Asked if Warhol was only a voyeur, Billy Name also denied it, saying: [...] "He was the essence of sexuality. It permeated everything. Andy exuded it, along with his great artistic creativity….It brought a joy to the whole art world in New York." [...] "But his personality was so vulnerable that it became a defense to put up the blank front." [...] Warhol's lovers included John Giorno, Billy Name, Charles Lisanby, and Jon Gould. His boyfriend of 12 years was Jed Johnson, whom he met in 1968, and who later achieved fame as an interior designer.|$|E
2500|$|Celebrities of the post-2000 era, like Madhur Bhandarkar, {{say that}} they take at least three or four turns in Carter Road even today just to see Khanna. The younger {{generation}} stars like Imran Khan still regard Rajesh Khanna as someone who would take the top slot as the most romantic hero of all time. Shahrukh Khan idolises Rajesh Khanna and has opined; [...] "Rajesh Khanna, you can’t touch". Anupam Kher said [...] "Kishore Kumar, Sanjeev Kumar, S. D. Burman, R. D. Burman, Rajesh Khanna and Smita Patil {{changed the face of}} Indian cinema. They’re remembered by the films that they did." [...] Actor Tom Alter confessed [...] "I still dream of being Rajesh Khanna. For me, in the early 1970s, he was the only hero – romantic to the core, not larger than life, so Indian and real – he was my hero; the reason I came into films and he still is." [...] Actor Irrfan Khan stated in an interview, [...] "The kind of craze witnessed by Rajesh Khanna has not been duplicated by anyone. He was the biggest and the most real star Bollywood has produced. I'd say stardom is that feeling of being possessed by your idol; you are so overwhelmed with euphoria you lose touch with reality." [...] The trend of wearing guru kurtas and belts on shirts became famous in the seventies and eighties because of Khanna. Javed Akhthar, in an interview, told about his experience with Khanna's stardom: [...] "Bangalore used to have a state lottery and the government asked him to draw the lucky number. They organised it in a stadium. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> as we were discussing some scripts. I don't know if I will experience that again, the sound of 50,000 people gasping (when they saw him). He was like Caesar. It was unbelievable".|$|E

6000|$|... 'No,' said Birkin, 'he is justified. He {{is not a}} bully. He is only insisting to {{the poor}} stray that she shall {{acknowledge}} him {{as a sort of}} fate, her own fate: because you can see she is fluffy and promiscuous as the wind. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> entirely. He wants superfine stability.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In some ways, {{it might}} <b>be</b> better if <b>I</b> went home at once," [...] {{he said at}} last. [...] "I could come back and join {{you as soon as}} I saw how things were going. The Colonel would be safe from any further {{persecution}} if <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>with</b> <b>him,</b> but, all the same, I'm inclined to stay away." ...|$|R
60|$|HON. Knew him! I {{was a great}} {{companion}} of his; <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> most an end: when he first began to think upon what would come upon us hereafter, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E

6000|$|... "We {{talked for}} an hour after luncheon," [...] Maraton admitted. [...] "Your uncle's is a very sane point of view. I know just how he regards me--a sort of {{dangerous}} enthusiast, a firebrand with the knack of commanding attention. The worst of it <b>is</b> that when <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>with</b> <b>him,</b> he almost {{makes me feel like}} that myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Seems to me {{that girl}} Ruler of yours is making a big fuss over nothing," [...] remarked Scraps, tossing her yarn {{hair out of her}} eyes with a jerk of her patched head.

60|$|One day, it <b>was</b> when <b>I</b> had <b>been</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> about {{eighteen}} months, {{he said to}} me suddenly.|$|R
6000|$|... “Nat, what Dave says is {{absolutely}} true—I know he wasn’t near Leesburgh last week, for <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> {{every day and}} every evening,” said Ben.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then disbelieve it. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> yesterday, and I'll {{tell you}} who was there before me;--only don't you go to Robinson and say I said so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ay, ay, {{just the}} same. It was he {{relieved}} Cuddieburn, and defended Chingalore, and defeated the great Mahratta chief, Ram Jolli Bundleman. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> {{in most of}} his campaigns.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is true," [...] replied Beechnut, [...] "but {{those things}} will be as likely to happen if <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> {{as if he were}} alone. It seems to me that when a boy gets as old as Stuyvesant, the only {{advantage}} of having some one <b>with</b> <b>him</b> when he <b>is</b> traveling is to keep him from doing careless or foolish things,--and Stuyvesant can take care of himself in that respect." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Stress upon them? Damn it, I'm {{as good as}} he is!" [...] Miller exclaimed irritably. [...] "There's no harm in Tallente's ratting, quitting {{his order}} and coming amongst us Democrats, but what I do object to is his {{bringing}} the mannerisms and outlook of Eton and Oxford amongst us. When <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>with</b> <b>him,</b> he always makes me feel that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> doing the wrong thing and that he knows it." ...|$|R
60|$|I remained, {{while the}} others filed out, and at length <b>I</b> <b>was</b> alone <b>with</b> <b>him</b> and Jules, his clerk.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's a fact," [...] said Billy Dill. [...] "He {{was always}} drawing jest such things when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> He {{said he was}} bound to find that {{treasure}} some day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Captain Drake! God forgive me, sir; but--Captain Drake in the South Seas? He saw them, sir, {{from the}} {{tree-top}} over Panama, when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>with</b> <b>him,</b> and I too; but sailed them, sir?--sailed them?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{his action}} was so {{different}} from what I had expected, it amazed me. Just now, when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>with</b> <b>him,</b> I learned, I guessed, what stayed his hand. I believe you ought to know." ...|$|E
