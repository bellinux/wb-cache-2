25|$|Also {{known as}} a {{continuing}} misrepresentation, lying <b>by</b> <b>omission</b> occurs when an important fact is left out in order to foster a misconception. Lying <b>by</b> <b>omission</b> includes the failure to correct pre-existing misconceptions. For example, when the seller of a car declares it has been serviced regularly but does not tell that a fault was reported at the last service, the seller lies <b>by</b> <b>omission.</b> It {{can be compared to}} dissimulation.|$|R

40|$|Damaged DNA binding (DDB) {{protein is}} an {{important}} gene in the repair of damaged DNA. DDB is a heterodimer (DDB 1 and DDB 2) protein, murine DDB 2 has 10 exons about 1. 5 kb in size (Genbank Accession No. AY 027937). Here we identified five DDB 2 variants (M 1 -M 5) from various mouse tissues that are generated by alternative splicing. We used reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) to identify splicing variants and isolated PCR products using an agarose-gel PCR purification kit. All isolated PCR products were cloned {{and the structure of}} splicing variants was confirmed by sequencing. The first splicing variant M 1 was generated <b>by</b> <b>omission</b> of exon 4. The second splicing variant M 2, <b>by</b> <b>omission</b> of exons 4 - 5. The third variants M 3 was generated <b>by</b> <b>omission</b> from the middle of exon 1 to exon 6 and was expressed in the heart. Fourth variants M 4 was generated <b>by</b> <b>omission</b> of exon 2 and exons 4 - 7. M 5, the last splicing variant was generated <b>by</b> <b>omission</b> of exons 4 - 7. M 4 and M 5 were expressed in the spleen. Analysis of tissue distribution by RT-PCR indicates that M 1 is most highly expressed in the mouse brain. These results indicated that murine DDB 2 has five splicing variants and splicing variants expression patterns were different depending on mouse tissue. Further functional studies of each splicing variants will provide more information about the molecular mechanism of DDB 2 function and DDB 2 gene expression regulation...|$|R

40|$|Are {{beneficial}} omissions {{treated the}} same as beneficial commissions of the same magnitude? Does it actually matter? In this Article I argue that while scholarship has {{paid attention to the}} omission bias in the context of harms (i. e., the discounting of harms caused <b>by</b> <b>omissions</b> relative to harms caused by commissions), it has not considered the omission bias in the context of benefits (i. e., the discounting of benefits caused <b>by</b> <b>omissions</b> relative to benefits caused by commissions).
