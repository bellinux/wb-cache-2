5|$|According to the Bills of Mortality, {{there were}} in total 68,596 deaths in London from the plague in 1665. Lord Clarendon <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> true number of mortalities was {{probably}} twice that figure. The next year, 1666, saw further deaths in other cities but on a lesser scale. Dr Thomas Gumble, chaplain to the Duke of Albermarle, both of whom had stayed in London {{for the whole of}} the epidemic, <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> total death count for the country from plague during 1665 and 1666 was about 200,000.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> group {{containing}} the dodo and the Rodrigues solitaire diverged from genera like Goura about 1.5 million years ago. However, that estimate appears highly unlikely. It was <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{relatives of the}} two species moved to the island about 35 million years ago, when a land bridge between Nazareth (Rodrigues) or St. Brandon banks and Mauritius formed.|$|E

5|$|After the war ended, {{service members}} {{returned}} to the area, spurring an enormous population explosion which dwarfed the 1920s boom. The 1960 Census counted 83,648 people in the city, about 230% of the 1950 figure.

5|$|Austrian losses {{amounted}} to 12 {{percent of total}} forces engaged, high for an eighteenth-century siege; the losses were due to sorties in which the French were able to inflict heavy damages. Gaston Bodart estimated that of the 40,000 men who participated on the Coalition side, 4,800 were lost. Based on Moreau's Memoirs, John Philippart <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Austrian losses were lower: 3,000 troops killed or wounded and 1,000 taken prisoner.|$|E

5|$|Ferry {{passengers}} {{would face}} a lengthier trek {{to reach the}} new pier. By relocating the new piers 300 m away, it is <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Star Ferry could lose perhaps 13 {{percent or more of}} passengers due to its inconvenience. On the Tsim Sha Tsui side of the harbour, the proposed relocation of the bus terminus which acts as a feeder for the ferry is forecast to further reduce passenger numbers by one-fifth.|$|E
