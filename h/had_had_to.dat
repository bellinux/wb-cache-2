5|$|From arms caches {{hidden in}} 1939, the Home Army obtained: 614 heavy machine guns, 1,193 light machine guns, 33,052 rifles, 6,732 pistols, 28 antitank light field guns, 25 antitank rifles, and 43,154 hand grenades. However, {{due to their}} {{inadequate}} preservation, which <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be improvised in {{the chaos of the}} September Campaign, most of the guns were in poor condition. Of those that had been buried in the ground and had been dug up in 1944 during preparations for Operation Tempest, only 30% were usable.|$|E

5|$|A {{decreased}} budget led to Nokomis {{losing its}} Saturday operating hours in 2004. The Nokomis East Neighborhood Association, Thrivent Financial for Lutherans, {{and members of}} the community subsequently put funds towards keeping the library open on Saturdays until in mid-2005 when money was reallocated in the budget for continued Saturday operation. Further budget woes continued to plague the Minneapolis Public Libraries as of early 2007, by which point the system <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> temporarily close three different branches in part due to a loss of local government aid. A merger with the Hennepin County Libraries was approved by both systems' boards along with the Minneapolis City Council and Nokomis reopened at 10 am on January 2, 2008, as a Hennepin County Library. It remained the only building in the newly expanded 41-library system to be named for a fictional character.|$|E

Kaney applied to strike out the claim before filing a defence, on the basis that the claim could not possibly succeed given the binding authority of the Court of Appeal decision of Stanton v Callaghan in 1998 that expert witnesses could not be sued for negligence when preparing a joint statement with the opposing side's expert witness.|$|E
5|$|Including {{the victory}} over Leeds in 1975, Bayern Munich {{had won the}} European Cup on three {{occasions}} going into the 1999 final. With three victories in a row from 1974 to 1976, they became only the third team to achieve such a feat after Real Madrid (1956 to 1960) and Ajax (1971 to 1973). They had also finished as runners-up twice: in 1982 against Aston Villa and 1987 against Porto. Although Bayern had been waiting 23 years for a European Cup title, Manchester United <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> wait even longer, their only victory having come in 1968. Their manager then was Matt Busby, who had been seriously injured in the Munich air disaster, which killed eight of his players {{on the way back}} from a European Cup tie in Belgrade 10 years earlier, before rebuilding the team to become European Cup winners. Busby died in 1994; the day of the 1999 Champions League final would have been his 90th birthday.|$|E

In {{the first five years of}} US Post Office air mail service the average forced landing was every 800 miles and a pilot was killed about every 80,000 miles. Thirty-five pilots died during the Postal Service's operation of air mail flights; most deaths were between 1920 and 1925.|$|E

5|$|The Committee {{also played}} an {{important}} political role. By providing an alternative supply of food, the CNSA prevented the German administration of Belgium {{from being able to}} use food as a bargaining tool to force Belgians to work in war industries and contributed to the passive resistance movement within occupied Belgium. However, the CNSA and CRB's activities meant that the Germans benefitted from having seven million Belgians and two million Frenchmen in their territory fed and consequently did not face major food riots or other disruption that might have arisen if the Germans <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> feed the population of the occupied territories. The Germans also exploited their deal agreeing to give impunity to CNSA food shipments by seizing food produced in Belgium.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the army}} was summoned to {{assemble}} at York on 24 June, it did not approach Scotland until mid-August. This {{was due to the}} gradual arrival of army supplies (in some cases, with much delay — the King's own tents, for example, were not despatched from Westminster until halfway through July). Brown suggests that Henry was well aware of the delays these preparations would cause the campaign. At some point before the army left for Scotland, the muster was met by the Constable of England, Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland, and the Earl Marshal, Ralph Neville, Earl of Westmorland. Individual leaders of each retinue present were then paid a lump sum to later distribute in wages to their troops: Men-at-arms reived one shilling a day, archers half that, but captains and leaders do not apear to have been paid at a higher rate. The army left York on 25 July and reached Newcastle-upon-Tyne four days later; it was plagued by shortages of supplies, particularly food, of which more <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be requested before even leaving York. As the campaign progressed, bad weather exacerbated the problem of food shortages, and Brown has speculated that this was an important consideration in the short duration of the expedition.|$|E
5|$|As a {{promotion}} for the film, Warner Bros. Entertainment released , {{a series of}} narrated animations of the original comic book. The first chapter was released for purchase {{in the summer of}} 2008 on digital video stores, such as iTunes Store and Amazon Video on Demand. DC Direct released action figures based on the film in January 2009. Director Zack Snyder also set up a YouTube contest petitioning Watchmen fans to create faux commercials of products made by the fictional Veidt Enterprises. The producers also released two short video pieces online, which were intended to be viral videos designed as fictional backstory pieces, with one being a 1970 newscast marking the 10th anniversary of the public appearance of Dr. Manhattan. The other was a short propaganda film promoting the Keene Act of 1977, which made it illegal to be a superhero without government support. An official viral marketing web site, The New Frontiersman, is named after the tabloid magazine featured in the graphic novel, and contains teasers styled as declassified documents. After the trailer to the film premiered in July 2008, DC Comics president Paul Levitz said that the company <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> print more than 900,000 copies of Watchmen trade collection to meet the additional demand for the book that the advertising campaign had generated, with the total annual print run expected to be over one million copies. DC Comics reissued Watchmen #1 for the original cover price of $1.50 on December 10, 2008; no other issues are to be reprinted.|$|E

5|$|However, the {{financial}} crisis of 2007–08 ended this period of stability, and, on 16 April 2007, the governor (at that time Mervyn King), was obliged to write the first MPC open letter to the chancellor (Gordon Brown), explaining why the inflation had deviated from the target of 2% per year {{by more than one}} percentage point (3.1%). By February 2013, he <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> write 14 such letters to chancellors. Between October 2008 and March 2009 the base rate was cut six times to an all-time low of 0.5% in order to avoid deflation and spur growth. In March 2009, the MPC launched a programme of quantitative easing, initially injecting £75 billion into the economy. By March 2010, it had also increased the amount of money set aside for quantitative easing to £200 billion, a figure later increased by a further £75 billion in the months following October 2011. The MPC announced two further £50 billion rounds of quantitative easing in February and July 2012, bringing the total to £375 billion whilst simultaneously keeping the base rate at 0.5%. In March 2013, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, called on the MPC to follow its American counterpart (the Federal Reserve Board) in committing itself to keeping interest rates low for a prolonged period of time via appropriate forward guidance, which it did on 7 August.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{interior}} design of Norfolk House was {{to define the}} London town house for the next century. The floor plan {{was based on an}} adaptation of one of the secondary wings he had built at Holkham Hall. A circuit of reception rooms centred on a grand staircase, with the staircase hall replacing the Italian traditional inner courtyard or two-storey hall. This arrangement of salons allowed guests at large parties to circulate, having been received {{at the head of the}} staircase, without doubling back on arriving guests. The second advantage was that while each room had access to the next, it also had access to the central stairs, thus allowing only one or two rooms to be used at a time for smaller functions. Previously, guests in London houses <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> reach the principal salon through a long enfilade of minor reception rooms. In this square and compact way, Brettingham came close to recreating the layout of an original Palladian Villa. He transformed what Andrea Palladio had conceived as a country retreat into a London mansion appropriate for the lifestyle of the British aristocracy, with its reversal of the usual Italian domestic pattern of a large palazzo in town, and a smaller villa in the country. As happened so often in Brettingham's career, Robert Adam later developed this design concept further, and was credited with its success. However, Brettingham's plan for Norfolk House was to serve as the prototype for many London mansions over the next few decades.|$|E
