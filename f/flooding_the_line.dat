2500|$|In April 1856 a {{rail line}} reached the port, {{crossing}} the almost empty plain from Adelaide. By 1876 {{it was a}} thriving seaport and the principal artery from South Australia, {{to the rest of}} the country and to the World. To service the numerous stores and warehouses, many railway lines were built around the wharf areas, along streets, and connecting with the main lines from Adelaide. A horse tram line was constructed from Port Adelaide to Albert Park in 1879. This line was built in [...] broad gauge to accommodate steam locomotives. Some of the line was raised on embankments to avoid swampy ground and <b>flooding.</b> <b>The</b> <b>line</b> used horse trams until 1914, when conversion to electric operation began. [...] It reopened on 3 April 1917. From 1917 until its closure in 1935, the Port Adelaide tram system was not connected to the rest of Adelaide's light rail network.|$|E
50|$|On March 18, 1968, <b>the</b> Neponset River <b>flooded</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> at Milton station. Restoration {{work began}} at 6:00 am on March 21 as the waters receded; service was resumed by 4:30 pm.|$|R
50|$|The {{operation}} of Nansatsu Line was suspended on June 21, 1983 {{due to a}} <b>flood.</b> <b>The</b> <b>line</b> was abandoned and officially closed on March 18, 1984. Only <b>the</b> Ibusuki-Makurazaki <b>Line</b> has served <b>the</b> station since then.|$|R
5000|$|... 11: Blaenau's {{railways}} hit {{rock bottom}} in 1960 when [...] closed. Double-figure daily usage figures and rising costs made their own case, but the decision to dam Afon Tryweryn and <b>flood</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> west of Bala sealed the station's fate.|$|R
50|$|There {{was also}} a plan to set timed {{explosives}} on the London Underground in order to cause <b>the</b> river to <b>flood</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines.</b> <b>The</b> likely quantity of explosive required to rupture many metres of reinforced concrete and bedrock widely enough to allow water to flow into the tunnel system at any significant rate is so large as {{to make this a}} very unrealistic plan.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>line</b> only {{operated}} {{for four}} years. In June 1918, <b>the</b> <b>line</b> was damaged by <b>flooding</b> and <b>the</b> <b>line</b> was abandoned on December 31, 1920.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Paddy Mails" [...] ceased {{running in}} May 1932 due {{to parts of}} the bridges between Orgreave and Treeton being washed away when <b>the</b> River Rother <b>flooded.</b> <b>The</b> <b>line</b> was {{repaired}} but the [...] "Paddy Mails" [...] were not re-introduced, being replaced by [...] "Pit Buses" [...] operated by Sheffield Corporation along the main routes from the city centre and the local area.|$|R
5000|$|The {{building}} of the Llyn Celyn reservoir necessitated <b>the</b> <b>flooding</b> of <b>the</b> <b>line.</b> A diversion was considered but never built. A short section from [...] to [...] remained opened but was eventually closed in 1965.|$|R
50|$|In 1974, {{construction}} of the Eibenstock Reservoir was commenced and <b>flooded</b> <b>the</b> railway <b>line</b> between Blauenthal and Sch√∂nheide Ost. The following year the narrow-gauge railway was abandoned, and only a short stretch has been retained as a museum piece.|$|R
50|$|Heavy rain in December 1994 {{resulted}} in the River Kelvin bursting its banks at Kelvinbridge and the resultant torrent through the disused Glasgow Central Railway tunnel <b>flooded</b> <b>the</b> Argyle <b>Line</b> trapping Class 314 Units at Glasgow Central Low Level.|$|R
50|$|Shafts can be sunk either dry or for {{methods such as}} the caisson method {{they can}} be sunk wet. Sinking a dry shaft means that any water that flows into the {{excavation}} is pumped out to leave no significant standing or flowing water {{in the base of}} the shaft. When wet sinking a shaft the shaft is allowed to <b>flood</b> and <b>the</b> muck is excavated out of the base of the shaft underwater using a grab {{on the end of a}} crane or similar excavation method. Because <b>the</b> shaft is <b>flooded,</b> <b>the</b> <b>lining</b> can not be constructed at the excavation level of the shaft so this method only suits methods where <b>the</b> <b>lining</b> is installed before shaft sinking (such as the use of sheet piles) or where <b>the</b> <b>lining</b> is sunk down with the shaft such as the caisson method.|$|R
50|$|In May 1939 A R (Bob) Foster entered {{one in the}} North West 200, but it <b>flooded</b> on <b>the</b> start <b>line.</b>|$|R
50|$|The first {{bridge was}} opened over the Nepean in 1856 and was washed away the {{following}} year in a <b>flood.</b> <b>The</b> railway <b>line</b> was extended to Penrith in 1863, a school was established in 1865 and in 1871 the area became a municipality. It officially became a city in 1959.|$|R
50|$|Einasleigh had a {{stationmaster}} until 1927 when <b>the</b> <b>line</b> {{was closed}} by <b>flooding.</b> After <b>the</b> <b>line</b> was reopened, a gatekeeper - probably a station mistress {{as it was}} in later years - was appointed as from 1928. After a new house was built in the 1970s, maintenance fettlers occupied this house. <b>The</b> <b>line</b> is now chiefly a tourist attraction known as the Gulflander.|$|R
50|$|The {{town was}} {{served by a}} railway branch line from Cootamundra, which {{operated}} from 1903 until 1984, when services were suspended due to <b>flooding.</b> Although <b>the</b> <b>line</b> is not formally closed, {{it is unlikely to}} see service again with sections of track lifted during upgrades to the Hume Highway near Gundagai.|$|R
5|$|Network Rail's {{plans for}} {{electrification}} of the Great Western Main Line include provision for <b>flood</b> defences where <b>the</b> <b>line</b> is in {{proximity to the}} Holy Brook.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>line</b> was {{technically}} innovative, {{in response}} to the terrain and conditions. The country was flat but difficult for conventional railway tracks due to flooding, lack of suitable timber for sleepers and termite attack. In 1884 Phillips patented a system for taking railways across such country which utilised special U-section steel sleepers laid directly on <b>the</b> ground. During <b>floods</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> could be submerged without washing out the ballast and embankments normally used, so that it could quickly be put back into service when the waters subsided. The steel sleepers were also impervious to termite attack, and although initially more expensive than timber sleepers, were cheaper to lay and maintain. The bridges along <b>the</b> <b>line</b> were also designed to be submersible. This system was particularly suited to the Gulf country and was specified for the Normanton to Croydon line with Phillips engaged to supervise the construction.|$|R
5000|$|The station {{closed in}} December 1964 when {{services}} were truncated at Strata Florida, following <b>flood</b> damage to <b>the</b> <b>line</b> at Llanilar. Formal closure was confirmed two months later.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>line</b> from Florence to Marion was {{abandoned}} in 1969. [...] In 1992, <b>the</b> <b>line</b> from Marion to McPherson {{was sold to}} Central Kansas Railway. In 1993, after heavy <b>flood</b> damage, <b>the</b> <b>line</b> from Marion to McPherson {{was abandoned}}. In 2001, the railway from Lyons to 3 mi west of Conway was abandoned. [...] In 2001, Kansas and Oklahoma Railroad (K&O) took over operations of Central Kansas Railway.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>line</b> was {{previously}} closed from 27 December 2015 for seven weeks, after the formation was damaged by floodwater {{in more than}} 100 places following heavy rain on Boxing Day. [...] Previous episodes in 2004 & 2005 also resulted in prolonged closures whilst the trackbed & embankments were rebuilt - <b>the</b> 2004 <b>floods</b> putting <b>the</b> <b>line</b> out of action from early February until 22 May that year.|$|R
50|$|Radiological hazards are {{a fact of}} {{life for}} American college campuses located near nuclear {{facilities}}. These facilities require the development of a comprehensive public safety plan to prepare for radiological emergencies that may occur near a university population. A common factor in campus nuclear emergency preparedness plans is the establishment of a widely available method of information, typically radio stations assigned to inform the public of pertinent news and safety recommendations. The State University of New York at Oswego, located within the ten-mile zone of local nuclear power plants, has also established a safe-distance congregation center {{in the event of an}} evacuation, with arranged transportation for students without transportation. Campus officials may also need to manage <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> of communication, ensuring that while students have enough information on the emergency, they are also prevented from <b>flooding</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> of communication and hindering response activities.|$|R
50|$|A track {{connection}} still exists with <b>the</b> main <b>line</b> (now <b>the</b> Framingham/Worcester Line); catenary is installed {{up to the}} junction for offloading trolleys delivered by the railroad onto the light rail network. On October 20, 1996, severe <b>flooding</b> overflowed <b>the</b> banks of the Muddy River and <b>flooded</b> <b>the</b> Green <b>Line</b> subway from <b>the</b> western portals to Boylston. From October 23 to 25, a commuter rail shuttle was run from a temporary platform at Riverside to South Station using the old {{track connection}}.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>line</b> saw a {{resurgence}} of traffic during the restrictions and petrol rationing after the Second World War however passenger trains were withdrawn in June 1958. This was five years before the publication of The Reshaping of British Railways {{which led to the}} closure of many similar routes. <b>Flooding</b> caused <b>the</b> <b>line</b> to be closed entirely between Christow and Exeter in 1961, following which the gradual withdrawal of freight saw <b>the</b> <b>line</b> finally close in 1967.|$|R

50|$|Today, {{the main}} access road {{traversing}} the plateau {{from east to}} west is the Waterfall Way. It was not until the 1860s that permanent settlement occurred in the district. The dairy industry became a mainstay of the Dorrigo Plateau and today tourism is becoming more important. On 23 December 1924, the Glenreagh to Dorrigo railway opened. Due to <b>flood</b> damage, <b>the</b> <b>line</b> closed on 28 October 1972.|$|R
50|$|The posts on {{the canopy}} between the Forks Market and Johnston Terminal have bands {{on them to}} commemorate the peak water levels of major <b>floods.</b> Starting from <b>the</b> bottom of the posts, the bottom marker {{represents}} <b>the</b> 1950 <b>flood,</b> <b>the</b> middle marker represents both the 1852 and 1997 <b>floods,</b> and <b>the</b> top <b>the</b> <b>flood</b> of 1826. <b>The</b> <b>flood</b> <b>line</b> markers {{on one of the}} posts have historic plaques with information on <b>the</b> <b>floods</b> they represent.|$|R
50|$|Most of the Timber Trail's {{southern}} section {{follows the}} Ellis & Burnand tramway. Their timber sawmill at Ongarue was fed with logs (especially rimu) by a gradually growing network of tramways from 1903 until <b>floods</b> damaged <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> in 1958. From then until closure in 1966 the tramway was converted {{for use by}} logging trucks. However, {{as one of the}} best preserved bush tramways, it is considered a nationally significant site.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} mount a direct assault on the Grebbeberg, the Germans had to breach <b>the</b> <b>line</b> of {{outposts}} (voorpostenlijn) which covered a 3 km wide area {{directly in front of}} the Grebbeberg, which had not been <b>flooded.</b> <b>The</b> <b>line</b> was manned by two companies of the third battalion of the 8th Infantry Regiment (III-8 RI), which was part of the 4th Division and the 2nd Corps. In the early hours of 11 May, German artillery opened fire on <b>the</b> <b>line</b> of outposts, disabling the telephone system of the Dutch defenders. Now that communication with <b>the</b> other defensive <b>lines</b> had become impossible, the Dutch were deprived of artillery support. At dawn, the SS brigade launched a direct assault on the outposts. The defensive positions at the outposts were mostly improvised and consisted of sandbags and wooden obstacles. The field of fire of the Dutch defensive positions did not overlap. German forces were able to neutralise them one by one by sending two teams of machine gunners to attack a single position. One team would provide covering fire while the other would use the blind spots to launch a flanking attack.|$|R
50|$|Today <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> are {{accessible}} {{for most of}} their length, but overgrown and derelict in places. The moat is used for fishing. In May 2006 the moat experienced some <b>flooding.</b> Most of <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> are designated as a scheduled ancient monument. In 2010 <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> were given a Green Flag Award.|$|R
50|$|The A21 {{passes on}} a viaduct near Haysden Water. Immediately {{to the east}} of this viaduct, and roughly {{parallel}} to it, is <b>the</b> Medway <b>flood</b> barrier. <b>The</b> railway <b>line</b> from Tonbridge towards Redhill, Surrey also passes through the park.|$|R
50|$|A {{fierce and}} {{prolonged}} storm {{took place in}} December 1910, culminating in a breach of the sea wall during the night of 15 December. 2000 acres (800 hA) of land were <b>flooded,</b> including <b>the</b> railway <b>line</b> north of Ferry. Part of <b>the</b> <b>line</b> {{was said to be}} under 12 feet of water.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>line</b> {{was built}} by Robert M. Widney to convey {{potential}} buyers to a new tract of land which he and W.E. Willmore were developing, at first called Willmore City but later renamed Long Beach. Originally a horse-drawn car, {{on the first day}} of service (October 31, 1882) the vehicle broke its wooden rails, forcing the men passengers to push it to a sound section of track, after which <b>the</b> <b>line</b> was popularly known as the G.O.P. ("Get Out and Push") Railroad. In 1883 <b>floods</b> washed <b>the</b> <b>line</b> out twice.|$|R
50|$|Passenger {{services}} ran until <b>flooding</b> {{severely damaged}} <b>the</b> <b>line</b> south of Aberystwyth in December 1964. A limited service continued running from Carmarthen to Tregaron {{for a few}} months after <b>the</b> <b>line</b> was severed, however this was the era of the Beeching Axe and <b>the</b> <b>line</b> was closed to passengers in February 1965.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: By {{the example}} of <b>the</b> extreme <b>flood</b> of <b>the</b> Elbe river in summer 2002 modern methods of {{analysing}} <b>the</b> <b>flood</b> event on <b>the</b> basis of high-resolution satellite data, laser scanner elevation models and terrestrial surveys are presented. For this purpose, an IKONOS satellite image mosaic consisting of 6 partial images, each of them being panchromatic and multispectral images, was computed for the area of Dresden after orthorectification. <b>The</b> <b>flood</b> <b>line</b> was mapped in this image mosaic that had been taken shortly after <b>flood</b> peak. On <b>the</b> basis of a DTM with 1 m grid spacing, deducted from laser scanner data, {{the position of the}} water surface level was computed by overlay with <b>the</b> <b>flood</b> <b>line.</b> This method was compared with terrestrial measurements on cross-section profiles of the Elbe at the crest of <b>the</b> <b>flood,</b> and assets and disadvantages were explained. Conclusively, a new flood plain is com-puted on the basis of <b>the</b> <b>flood</b> event and of hydrologic model computations...|$|R
25|$|In the 1990s the {{operator}} of interstate freight, the National Rail Corporation, {{made the decision}} to divert Sydney- Perth traffic from the Blue Mountains section, to travel via <b>the</b> Main South <b>line</b> to Cootamundra, and then via <b>the</b> cross country <b>line</b> to Parkes. This resulted in reduced goods traffic and subsequent reduction of <b>the</b> <b>line</b> between Wallerawang and Tarana from double to single track. Significant <b>flooding</b> saw <b>the</b> <b>line</b> cut between Nyngan and Bourke in April 1989, and the army destroyed a section of track north of Nyngan to relieve <b>flood</b> waters surrounding <b>the</b> town. It was not financially viable to repair and maintain <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>line</b> was thus abandoned between Nyngan and Bourke.|$|R
50|$|Passenger {{services}} {{ran through}} to Aberystwyth until <b>flooding</b> severely damaged <b>the</b> <b>line</b> south of Aberystwyth in December 1964. A limited service continued running from Carmarthen to Tregaron {{for a few}} months after <b>the</b> <b>line</b> was severed, however this was the era of the Beeching Axe and <b>the</b> <b>line</b> was closed to passengers in February 1965.|$|R
