40|$|In {{military}} aviation, Technical Publications (TP) {{are fundamental}} {{for the establishment}} of a maintenance strategy and provisioning of information support and maintenance services. They are also under the supervision of military authorities. For complex technical systems such as aircraft, technical publications often contain essential information such as indenture levels, repair and replacement instructions, spare part information, configuration information, required tools and item-related maintenance information. The manufacturer is faced with the challenge of coordinating the production of the complete TP-package. Authors and illustrators must write, draw and supply meta-data to every piece of information. They must do so according to detailed specifications (e. g. ASD S 1000 D) and writing guides. There is also complex cross-reference handling within the TP-package to consider, e. g. from maintenance instructions to <b>illustrated</b> <b>parts</b> <b>catalogues.</b> Cross-references exist within the content in the same publication, to other publications and/or to external information sources, e. g. databases. The information contained in the final TP-package is equivalent to, literally, tens of thousands of A 4 -pages. Paper-based deliveries, when occurring, are in themselves a logistic feat. The need for context-based adaptation of this complex information content to different actors' requirements is also challenging and need to be considered when establishing an efficient information logistic solution for provision of TP. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of some of the challenges and issues for establishing development and provisioning of Interactive Electronic Technical Publications (IETP[1]). Some important aspects and requirements on integration of IETP for both provider and user are also highlighted. The scope of the overview is restricted to an eMaintenance context related to military aviation. Godkänd; 2010; 20100506 (raka...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} improve their service and to make their {{customers}} more successful, every company needed to increase ease of access to equipment information and empower customers to help themselves. With an electronic spare part catalogue-system equipment manufacturers and assemblers are able to rapidly create comprehensive, easy to use electronic parts and service manuals. This study gives an overview about the system-design of electronic spare <b>part</b> <b>catalogues.</b> The author describes a way how to customize spare <b>part</b> <b>catalogue</b> publishing software {{in order to get}} a easy to use and full digital workflow. The solution is a small software called EPC-Assistant (EPC=Electronic <b>Part</b> <b>Catalogue).</b> Using standard software increases the need of customizing and workflow design. The EPC-Assistant was developed to support the needs of small business companies and was tested successfully in two German mining machinery suppliers...|$|R

40|$|At the R&D {{department}} at AerotechTelub Information and Media, we have {{carried out a}} study on new ways to search and present information to different user categories. The result {{of this study was}} a browser with a new interface - a new XML browser. The project originated in developing the next generation of spare <b>parts</b> <b>catalogues</b> for the Swedish Defence Materiel Administration (DMA). The solution presented was based on a new user interface comprising a mixture of presenting structure, interactive 3 D and text information on the same screen. The 3 D-technique that just recently was available only to those with big money and a state of the art computer is now available to anyone with standard equipment. On the way we realised that this way of presenting information gave a clear and easy-to-understand view of the objects described and opened up for a phase 2 of the study. In this second phase the user interface was further developed to allow fast access to all document types (repair manuals, functional descriptions, spare <b>parts</b> <b>catalogues</b> etc) using the structure and interactive 3 D for "vertical navigation" and filters for the different document types for "horizontal navigation"...|$|R
