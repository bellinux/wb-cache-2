40|$|The {{causes of}} ischaemic stroke in young adults are many and diverse.

Drug abuse is becoming increasingly important but the risk of stroke in pregnancy remains unclear. Isolated angiitis of the central nervous system, heritable disorders of connective tissue and other genetically determined disorders (mitochondrial cytopathies, CA-DASIL) account for a small proportion of ischaemic strokes in the young.

40|$|Background: Dissection of Extracranial Internal Carotid Artery (EICA) and Extracranial Vertebral Artery (EVA) is an amportant {{cause of}} brain {{infarction}} with miscellaneous etiologies around the world. Methods: A prospective observational clinical {{study was conducted}} in Ghaem Hospital, Mashhad, Iran between 2008 - 2016. Diagnosis of brain infarction and TIA was made by stroke neurologist. Detection of EICA and EVA dissections were made by performing CT angiography  and MR angiography  or DSA in the suspected patients. Demographic features, clinical manifestations, territorial involvement, pathophysiology and pathogenesis of dissections were assessed in all of the patients. Pathogenesis of dissections was classified as Idiopathic, Trumatic, Postural and Genetic categories. Results: Twenty eight patients (21 males, 7 females) were admitted with <b>extracranial</b> <b>arterial</b> <b>dissection.</b> Mean age of males and females with dissection was 39. 81 ± 4. 2 and 35. 71 ± 6. 1 years respectively. Influence of gender on age of the patients was not significant, p> 0. 05. Among patients with extracranial dissection only 3. 6 % had atherosclerosis risk factors and 96. 4 % had no other cause for brain infarction. 100 % of extracranial dissections in males occured in carotid territory, while 28. 6 % of females had dissection in the EVA. The influence of gender in territory of dissection was significant, p< 0. 05. Idiopathic dissections and genetic susceptibility was found in 10. 7 % and 3. 6 % of extracranial dissections respectively. 53. 5 % of the patienrs had trumatic pathogenesis for extracranial dissections and 32. 1 % developed dissection due to special neck  postures. Important details in pathophysiology and pathogenesis of extracranial dissections will be presented in the lecture. Conclusion: Stroke patients with extracranial dissections have characteristic demographic and  territorial involvement.

40|$|SUMMARY Common carotid {{blood flow}} (CCBF) was {{measured}} in 11 anesthetised patients without <b>extracranial</b> <b>arterial</b> disease (nine acute subarachnoid haemorrhages and two cases of head injury). The range-gated Doppler flowmeter with an adjustable range-gated time system and a double transducer probe {{was used to determine}} diameter, blood velocity, and blood flow of the common carotid artery. Values were, respectively, 5. 9 ± 1. 1 mm, 13. 8 ± 6. 1 cm • sec" 1 and 387 ± 183 cm 3 • min- 1. Mean cerebral blood flow (rCBF) measurements were simultaneously made by l 33 Xenon intra-arterial method, with a value of 22. 28 ± 5. 96 ml •min"l # 100 g. High correlation coefficient was found between CCBF and mean rCBF(r = 0. 73, p < 0. 001).

40|$|Purpose: Cerebral <b>arterial</b> <b>dissections</b> are {{recognized}} as a common cause of stroke. However, few studies have reported {{on the distribution of}} cerebral <b>arterial</b> <b>dissection</b> and angiographic pattern related to the presenting clinical symptom pattern. We analyzed the distribution of cerebral artery dissection along with angiographic and clinical presenting a pattern as depicted on angiograms. Materials and Methods: From January 2000 to January 2007, 133 <b>arterial</b> <b>dissection</b> patients admitted to our institutes were retrospectively reviewed. The characteristic angiographic findings of all cerebral arteries were carefully evaluated on 4 -vessel angiograms. The male-female ratio was 77 : 56 and the mean age was 51 years. According to the angiographic finding depicting the location of the dissection plane in the arterial wall, we categorized to steno-occlusive, aneurysmal, combined and unclassifiable pattern. In each dissection pattern, we evaluated presenting symptoms and presence of infarction or hemorrhage. Results: The most common symptom on presentation was headache (47 %), followed by motor weakness of arm or leg (31 %), dysarthria/aphasia (19 %) and vertigo (16 %).

40|$|Study Design: Cross-sectional case-control study. Objectives: To {{identify}} {{risk factors}} and clinical presentation of individuals with cervical <b>arterial</b> <b>dissection.</b> Background: Cervical <b>arterial</b> <b>dissection</b> is a common cause of stroke in young people and has in rare cases been associated with cervical manipulative therapy. The mechanism is considered to involve pre-existing arterial susceptibility and a precipitating event, such as minor trauma. Identification of individuals at risk or early recognition of a dissection in progress could help expedite medical intervention and avoid inappropriate treatment. Methods: Participants were individuals 55 {{years of age or}} younger from the Hunter region of New South Wales, Australia with radiologically confirmed vertebral or internal carotid artery dissection and an age- and sex-matched comparison group. Participants were interviewed about risk factors, preceding events, and clinical features of their stroke. Physical examination of joint mobility and soft tissue compliance was undertaken. Results: Twenty-four participants with cervical <b>arterial</b> <b>dissection</b> and 21 matched comparisons with ischemic stroke but not dissection were included in the study. Seventeen (71 %) of the 24 participants with dissection reported a recent history of minor mechanical neck trauma or strain, with 4 of these 17 reporting recent neck manipulative therapy treatment. Cardiovascular risk factors were uncommon, with the exception of diagnosed migraine. Among the participants with dissection, 67 % reported transient ischemic features in the month prior to their admission for dissection. Conclusion: Recent minor mechanical trauma or strain to the head or neck appears to be associated with cervical <b>arterial</b> <b>dissection.</b> General cardiovascular risk factors, with the exception of migraine, were not important risk factors for dissection in this cohort.
