5|$|All recent {{specimens}} of the Borneo shark <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>collected</b> solely from fishery landing sites at Mukah in Sarawak, despite thorough surveys across {{the rest of}} Borneo (including at the locality of the type specimen).

This species was also recorded from Borongan in the Philippines in 1895, and Java in 1933; these records cannot be substantiated {{and there have been}} no subsequent sightings from these areas.|$|E
