However, many wildcat strikers ignored {{the request of the}} UMWA and used violence to express the anger that they felt toward the Pittston Coal Company. By the time the strike had ended, over 4,000people had been arrested for their actions.|$|E

In April 1911, Heifetz {{performed}} in an outdoor concert in St. Petersburg before 25,000 spectators; {{there was such a}} sensational reaction that police officers needed to protect the young violinist after the concert. In 1914, he performed with the Berlin Philharmonic conducted by Arthur Nikisch. The conductor was very impressed, saying he had never <b>heard</b> <b>such</b> an excellent violinist.|$|E
25|$|Timbre is {{perceived}} as the quality of different sounds (e.g. the thud of a fallen rock, the whir of a drill, the tone of a musical instrument or {{the quality of a}} voice) and represents the pre-conscious allocation of a sonic identity to a sound (e.g. “it’s an oboe!"). This identity is based on information gained from frequency transients, noisiness, unsteadiness, perceived pitch and the spread and intensity of overtones in the sound over an extended time frame. The way a sound changes over time (see figure 4) provides most of the information for timbre identification. Even though a small section of the wave form from each instrument looks very similar (see the expanded sections indicated by the orange arrows in figure 4), differences in changes over time between the clarinet and the piano are evident in both loudness and harmonic content. Less noticeable are the different noises <b>heard,</b> <b>such</b> as air hisses for the clarinet and hammer strikes for the piano.|$|E

500|$|From {{the mid-1950s}} rumours began to {{circulate}} that Blyton had not written {{all the books}} attributed to her, a charge she found particularly distressing. She published an appeal in her magazine asking children {{to let her know}} if they <b>heard</b> <b>such</b> stories and, after one mother informed her that she had attended a parents' meeting at her daughter's school during which a young librarian had repeated the allegation, Blyton decided in 1955 to begin legal proceedings. The librarian was eventually forced to make a public apology in open court early the following year, but the rumours that Blyton operated [...] "a 'company' of ghost writers" [...] persisted, as some found it difficult to believe that one woman working alone could produce such a volume of work.|$|E
500|$|The overall impression, as critic Alex Ross {{writes in}} his book The Rest is Noise, was that [...] "Copland {{was no longer in}} an ingratiating mood; some sudden rage welled up in him, some urge to confront the gala Lincoln Center {{audience}} with an old whiff of revolutionary mystique." [...] Copland himself remembers, [...] "The acidulous harmonies of my score... upset a good many people, especially those who were expecting another Appalachian Spring." [...] Jacqueline Kennedy was left unable to say anything other than [...] "Oh, Mr. Copland" [...] when taken backstage during intermission to meet with the composer. When Copland later asked Verna Fine, wife of American composer Irving Fine, what this meant, Fine answered, [...] "Oh, Aaron, it's obvious. She hated your piece!" [...] In Variety, Robert J. Landry called Connotations [...] "an assault on [...] nervous systems" [...] and added, [...] "Seldom has this reviewer <b>heard</b> <b>such</b> outspoken comment in the lobbies after such dull response. It is strictly accurate to declare that an audience paying $100 a seat and in mood for self-congratulation and schmaltz hated Copland's reminder of the ugly realities of industrialization, inflation and cold war—which his music seems to be talking about." ...|$|E

500|$|The 1912 and 1913 Prom seasons are {{singled out}} by Cox as among the finest {{of this part of}} Wood's career. Among those {{conducting}} their own works or hearing Wood conduct them were Strauss, Debussy, Reger, Scriabin, and Rachmaninoff. Schoenberg's Five Pieces for Orchestra also received its first performance (the composer not being present); during rehearsals, Wood urged his players, [...] "Stick to it, gentlemen! This is nothing to what you'll have to play in 25 years' time". The critic Ernest Newman wrote after the performance: [...] "It is not often that an English audience hisses the music it does not like, but a good third of the people at Queen's Hall last Tuesday permitted themselves that luxury after the performance of the five orchestral pieces of Schoenberg. Another third of the audience was only not hissing because it was laughing, and the remaining third seemed too puzzled either to laugh or to hiss; so that on the whole it does not look as if Schoenberg has so far made many friends in London." [...] However, when Wood invited Schoenberg himself to conduct the work's second British performance, on 17 January 1914, the composer was so delighted with the result, more warmly received than had been the premiere, that he congratulated Wood and the orchestra warmly: [...] "I must say {{it was the first time}} since Gustav Mahler that I <b>heard</b> <b>such</b> music played again as a musician of culture demands." ...|$|E
500|$|By May 1941, Sinatra {{topped the}} male singer polls in Billboard and Down Beat magazines. His appeal to bobby soxers, as teenage girls {{of that time}} were called, {{revealed}} a whole new audience for popular music, which had been recorded mainly for adults up to that time. The phenomenon became officially known as [...] "Sinatramania" [...] after his [...] "legendary opening" [...] at the Paramount Theatre in New York on December 30, 1942. According to Nancy Sinatra, Jack Benny later said, [...] "I thought the goddamned building was going to cave in. I never <b>heard</b> <b>such</b> a commotion... All this for a fellow I never heard of." [...] Sinatra performed for four weeks at the theatre, his act following the Benny Goodman orchestra, after which his contract was renewed for another four weeks by Bob Weitman due to his popularity. He became known as [...] "Swoonatra" [...] or [...] "The Voice", and his fans [...] "Sinatratics". They organized meetings and sent masses of letters of adoration, {{and within a few}} weeks of the show, some 1000 Sinatra fan clubs had been reported across the US. Sinatra's publicist, George Evans, encouraged interviews and photographs with fans, and was the man responsible for depicting Sinatra as a vulnerable, shy, Italian–American with a rough childhood who made good. When Sinatra returned to the Paramount in October 1944 only 250 persons left the first show, and 35,000 fans left outside caused a near riot, known as the Columbus Day Riot, outside the venue because they were not allowed in. [...] Such was the bobby-soxer devotion to Sinatra that they were known to write Sinatra's song titles on their clothing, bribe hotel maids for an opportunity to touch his bed, and accost his person in the form of stealing clothing he was wearing, most commonly his bow-tie.|$|E

Thomas Dugdale also claimed Baldwin said to him: [...] "If we do have a war, Winston must be Prime Minister. If he is in [...] now we shan't be able to engage in that war as a united nation". The General Secretary of the Trades Union Congress, Walter Citrine, recalled a conversation he had had with Baldwin on 5 April 1943: [...] "Baldwin thought his [...] political recovery was marvellous. He, personally, had always thought that if war came Winston would be the right man for the job".|$|E

2500|$|Furtwängler's {{recordings}} {{are characterized}} by an [...] "extraordinary sound wealth [...] ", special emphasis being placed on cellos, double basses, percussion and woodwind instruments. According to Furtwängler, {{he learned how to}} obtain this kind of sound from Arthur Nikisch. This richness of sound is partly due to his [...] "vague" [...] beat, often called a [...] "fluid beat". This fluid beat created slight gaps between the sounds made by the musicians, allowing listeners to distinguish all the instruments in the orchestra, even in tutti sections. Vladimir Ashkenazy once said: [...] "I never <b>heard</b> <b>such</b> beautiful fortissimi as Furtwängler's." [...] According to Yehudi Menuhin, Furtwängler's fluid beat was more difficult but superior than Toscanini's very precise beat. Unlike Otto Klemperer, Furtwängler did not try to suppress emotion in performance, instead giving a hyper romantic aspect to his interpretations. The emotional intensity of his World War II recordings is particularly famous. Conductor and pianist Christoph Eschenbach has said of Furtwängler that he was a [...] "formidable magician, a man capable of setting an entire ensemble of musicians on fire, sending them into a state of ecstasy". Furtwängler desired to retain an element of improvisation and of the unexpected in his concerts, each interpretation being conceived as a re-creation. However, melodic line as well as the global unity were never lost with Furtwängler, even in the most dramatic interpretations, partly due to the influence of Heinrich Schenker and to the fact that Furtwängler was a composer and had studied composition during his whole life.|$|E
2500|$|The Queensland Labor Premier, Anna Bligh, {{described}} Andrews' {{criticism of}} Sudanese as [...] "disturbing". She said: [...] "It {{has been a}} long time since I have <b>heard</b> <b>such</b> a pure form of racism out of the mouth of any Australian politician." [...] Labor politician Tony Burke branded Andrews' decision as [...] "incompetent". [...] However, Andrew's actions were applauded by the former One Nation politician, Pauline Hanson. Andrews was accused of helping to fuel assaults of Sudanese. During the controversy one criticism was that Andrews justified his decision based on [...] "concerns raised by the community", however no official report or inquest has been tendered, leading to the conclusion that any 'concerns' were both unofficial, undocumented and most probably belonging to a racially intolerant minority. The Howard government had before used the race card in an election year to distract the voters from its other failures. This was most significant in the 2001 election with the infamous Tampa affair, in which the government was badly trailing in the polls before vilifying middle-eastern [...] "boat people". The strategy worked for the government by exploiting the underlying racist elements of Australian society. Andrews defended the system of having refugee quotas against the opinion expressed that intakes of refugees should be variated on the basis of global needs [...]" [...] In October 2007, Howard [...] "admitted breaking a promise to keep interest rates at record lows". During the 2004 campaign, Howard was also cited as giving the same promise, personally, on radio. Inflation figures released on 24 October indicated underlying inflation was higher than expected, which resulted in seven of eight financial companies believing there will be an interest rate rise when the reserve bank met in the middle of November, the first during an election campaign.|$|E
2500|$|.....a pianist {{who appears}} to be {{something}} really quite extraordinary. [...] I had to overcome great resistance in order to go at all, for the description I'd heard from Dr. Hoffmann and from Maurice Zam had made me very skeptical. [...] But I must say that I have never <b>heard</b> <b>such</b> a pianist before...First, [...] he does not play at all in the style you and I strive for. [...] And just as I did not judge him on that basis, I imagine that when you hear him, you too will be compelled to ignore all matters of principle, and probably will end up doing just as I did. [...] For your principles would not be the proper standard to apply. [...] What he plays is expression in the older sense of the word, nothing else; but such power of expression I have never heard before. [...] You will disagree with his tempis as much as I did. [...] You will also note that he often seems to give primacy to sharp contrasts at the expense of form, the latter appearing to get lost. [...] I say appearing to; for then, in its own way, his music surprisingly regains its form, makes sense, establishes its own boundaries. [...] The sound he brings out of the piano is unheard of, or at least I have never heard anything like it. [...] He himself seems not to know how he produces these novel and quite incredible sounds - although he appears to be a man of intelligence and not just some flaccid dreamer. [...] And such fullness of tone, achieved without ever becoming rough, I have never before encountered. [...] For me, and probably for you too, it's really too much fullness, but as a whole it displays incredible novelty and persuasiveness. [...] And above all he's only [...] old, so he's still got several stages of development before him, from which one may expect great things, given his point of departure... it is amazing what he plays and how he plays it. [...] One never senses that it is difficult, that it is technique - no, it is simply a power of the will, capable of soaring over all imaginable difficulties in the realization of an idea. - You see, I'm waxing almost poetic.|$|E

2500|$|During the Anti-Bureaucratic Revolution, Milošević urged Serbians and Montenegrins to [...] "take to the streets" [...] and {{utilized}} the slogan [...] "Strong Serbia, Strong Yugoslavia" [...] that drew support from Serbs and Montenegrins but alienated the other Yugoslav nations. To these groups, Milošević's agenda reminded {{them of the}} Serb hegemonic political affairs of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and Ranković's policies. Milošević appealed to nationalist and populist passion by speaking of Serbia's importance {{to the world and}} in a Belgrade speech on 19 November 1988, he spoke of Serbia as facing battles against both internal and external enemies. In Vojvodina, a mob of pro-Milošević demonstrators that included 500 Kosovo Serbs and local Serbs demonstrated at the provincial capital, accusing the leadership in Vojvodina of supporting separatism and for being [...] "traitors". In August 1988, meetings by supporters of the Anti-Bureaucratic Revolution were held in many locations in Serbia and Montenegro, with increasingly violent nature, with calls being <b>heard</b> <b>such</b> as [...] "Give us arms!", [...] "We want weapons!", [...] "Long live Serbia—death to Albanians!", and [...] "Montenegro is Serbia!". In the same month, Milošević began efforts designed to destabilize the governments in Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina to allow him to install his followers in those republics. By 1989, Milošević and his supporters controlled Central Serbia along with the autonomous provinces of Kosovo and Vojvodina, supporters in the leadership of Montenegro, and agents of the Serbian security service were pursuing efforts to destabilize the government in Bosnia & Herzegovina. The new government of Montenegro led by Momir Bulatović was seen by some as a satellite of Serbia. In 1989, the Serbian media began to speak of [...] "the alleged imperilment of the Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina", as tensions between Serbs and Bosnian Muslims and Croats increased over Serb support for Milošević. Efforts to spread the cult of personality of Milošević into the republic of Macedonia began in 1989 with the introduction of slogans, graffiti, and songs glorifying Milošević. Furthermore, Milošević proposed a law to restore land titles held by Serbs in the interwar period that effectively provided a legal basis for large numbers of Serbs to move to Kosovo and Macedonia to regain those lands. Beginning in 1989, Milošević gave support to Croatian Serbs who were vouching for the creation of an autonomous province for Croatian Serbs, which was opposed by Croatian communist authorities. In the late 1980s, Milošević allowed the mobilization of Serb nationalist organizations to go unhindered by actions from the Serbian government, with Chetniks holding demonstrations, and the Serbian government embracing the Serbian Orthodox Church and restored its legitimacy in Serbia.|$|E
