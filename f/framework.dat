40|$|PURPOSE. Adequate passive-fitting of {{one-piece}} cast 3 -element implant-supported <b>frameworks</b> {{is hard to}} achieve. This short communication aims to present an alternative method for section of {{one-piece cast}} <b>frameworks</b> and for casting implant-supported <b>frameworks.</b> MATERIALS AND METHODS. Three-unit implant-supported nickel-chromium (Ni-Cr) <b>frameworks</b> were tested for vertical misfit (n = 6). The <b>frameworks</b> were cast as one-piece (Group A) and later transversally sectioned through a diagonal axis (Group B) and compared to <b>frameworks</b> that were cast diagonally separated (Group C). All separated <b>frameworks</b> were laser welded. Only {{one side of the}} <b>frameworks</b> was screwed. RESULTS. The results on the tightened side were significantly lower in Group C (6. 43 +/- 3. 24 mu m) when compared to Groups A (16. 50 +/- 7. 55 mu m) and B (16. 27 +/- 1. 71 mu m) (P<. 05). On the opposite side, the diagonal section of the one-piece castings for laser welding showed significant improvement in the levels of misfit of the <b>frameworks</b> (Group A, 58. 66 +/- 14. 30 mu m; Group B, 39. 4. 8 +/- 12. 03 mu m; Group C, 23. 13 +/- 8. 24 mu m) (P<. 05). CONCLUSION. Casting diagonally sectioned <b>frameworks</b> lowers the misfit levels. Lower misfit levels for the <b>frameworks</b> can be achieved by diagonally sectioning one-piece <b>frameworks.</b> [J Adv Prosthodont 2012; 4 : 89 - 92...|$|R
