500|$|Noise testing during 1996 and 1997 {{found that}} the {{hydrodynamic}} noise signature—the noise made by a submarine passing through the water—was excessive, particularly at high speed. The shape of the hull was the main cause: although a scale model of the design had been tested during the funded study and {{was found to have}} a minimal signature, the hull shape was changed after the contract was signed, primarily by a [...] lengthening of the submarine and a redesign of the bow dome to accommodate the larger-than-expected main sonar and reduce its blind spot (the baffles). The design had not been retested, as who would pay for this could not be agreed on. Propeller cavitation, caused by water flow over control surfaces onto the propeller at certain speeds, was the other main noisemaker. Cavitation had not been a problem with earlier Swedish submarine designs or during early testing of the Type 471 design, but the propeller had to be redesigned late in the process to provide more power, and like the redesigned hull, was not retested. During the years 2000, an unusual meeting took place with a next door neighbor (Francis 'Frank' Smith)of the then HMAS Stirling Naval Base commander. He was an Aircraft Maintenance Engineer (originally trained at Government Aircraft Factories Fisherman's bend) who had been aware of the fluid dynamics issues of the Collins class for some time, purely by interest and observation on television. After a lengthy discussion, he was invited to discuss and demonstrate where possible, his observations at the Stirling Naval Base with Navy and DSTO staff who were there at that time as part of an investigative group. He showed on a white board, the aerofoil issue with the Dorsal – Sail conning tower structure showing that the Cord ratio (Length to Width) was too short and that severe turbulence / cavitation would be generated by such a design. This was demonstrated again on the white board using Aircraft aerofoil wing shapes as a basis for the discussion. That the turbulence / cavitation generated would, by natural rearward flow, move down the rear upper surface deck of the hull and be drawn into the propeller. He was also able to demonstrate that the design of the bow section would not pass a flow test for generated turbulence / cavitation, with the change in shape from circular bow section to long hull, being ill-conceived. He made several recommendations during the lecture that would be cost effective and possible. 1) To lengthen and taper the dorsal fin and create a more streamlined integration of the Dorsal to Flat upper Hull deck section. and 2) To 'fill in' the <b>hollow</b> <b>section</b> of hull aft of the bow curvature. Both these could be achieved with Carbon Fibre or Fibreglass covers as no load bearing strength would be required. Subsequent studies by the Defence Science and Technology Organization showed that the submarine's hull shape, particularly the redesigned sonar dome, the fin, and the rear of the submarine, focused the displaced water into two turbulent streams; when the seven propeller blades hit these streams, the propeller's vibration was increased, causing cavitation. These problems were fixed by modifying the casing of the submarine with fiberglass fairings.|$|E

The sections were composed of 9 square <b>hollow</b> <b>sections,</b> 2 rectangular <b>hollow</b> <b>sections</b> and 6 circular <b>hollow</b> <b>sections.</b> 66 tensile coupons were tested to determine the modulus of elasticity, 0. 2 % tensile proof stress, ultimate tensile strength and elongation at fracture of the material. The results were also compared with the American, Australian and European standards. Based on the Ramberg-Osgood expression, a new constitutive model for high strength steel material is proposed. On three of the <b>hollow</b> <b>sections,</b> strength variation and cold-forming effect were studied by testing coupons extracted from different locations of the cross-sections.

However, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) conditioned essential financing for this and similar projects on the restriction of home sales to those of [...] "the Caucasian race", as stipulated in housing rent and sales agreements and deed covenants. This did not prevent Bea and Lew Wechsler, a Jewish couple from the Bronx, from reselling a home to an African-American family. Levittown's first black couple, William and Daisy Myers, bought a home in the Dogwood <b>Hollow</b> <b>section</b> in 1957. Their move to Levittown was marked with racist harassment and mob violence, which required intervention by state authorities. This led to an injunction and criminal charges against the harassers while Myers and their supporters refused to surrender and received national acclaim for their efforts. For instance, Daisy Myers has been hailed as [...] "The Rosa Parks of the North", who helped expose the northern states' problems with racial inequality of that time. Daisy Myers later wrote a book about her family's experiences. She died Dec. 5, 2011, in York, Pa. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the American Civil Liberties Union opposed Levitt’s racist policies, and the Federal Housing Administration threatened to refuse mortgages on his next Levittown. Levitt still refused to sell to blacks, and developed plans for yet another whites-only Levittown—this one to be in Willingboro Township, N.J.—while fighting legal challenges in New Jersey courts. Ultimately the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear his case.|$|E

40|$|Structural <b>hollow</b> <b>sections</b> are {{predominantly}} square, rectangular or circular in profile. While square and circular <b>hollow</b> <b>sections</b> {{are often the}} most effective in resisting axial loads, rectangular <b>hollow</b> <b>sections,</b> with greater stiffness about one principal axis than the other, are generally more suitable in bending. Oval or elliptical <b>hollow</b> <b>sections</b> (EHS) combine the aesthetic external profile of circular <b>hollow</b> <b>sections</b> with the suitability for resisting flexure of rectangular sections, whilst also retaining the inherent torsional stiffness offered by all tubular sections. This paper examines the structural response of recently introduced stainless steel oval <b>hollow</b> <b>sections</b> (OHS) in bending and presents design recommendations. In-plane bending tests in the three-point configuration about both the {{major and minor axes}} were conducted. All tested specimens were cold-formed from Grade 1. 4401 stainless steel and had an aspect ratio of approximately 1. 5. The full moment-rotation responses of the specimens were recorded and have been presented herein. The tests were replicated numerically by means of non-linear finite element (FE) analysis and parametric studies were performed to investigate the influence of key parameters, such as the aspect ratio and the cross-section slenderness, on the flexural response. Based on both the experimental and numerical results, structural design recommendations for stainless steel OHS in bending in accordance with Eurocode 3 : Part 1. 4 have been made.

40|$|In recent years, {{hot-rolled}} elliptical <b>hollow</b> <b>sections</b> {{have attracted}} significant attention from engineers and architects owing to their complementary qualities of aesthetic appearance and structural efficiency. However, {{there is currently}} a lack of design guidance for elliptical <b>hollow</b> <b>sections</b> inhibiting more widespread use in construction. The present paper addresses this shortcoming for the fundamental loading condition of axial compression. Laboratory testing, numerical modelling {{and the development of}} design rules are described herein. The experimental programme comprised 25 tensile coupon tests and 25 stub column tests. All tested elliptical <b>hollow</b> <b>sections</b> had an aspect ratio of 2 and section sizes ranged from 150 × 75 up to 500 × 250 mm. Results, including geometric imperfection measurements and full load–end shortening curves have been presented. Non-linear finite element models were developed and validated against the generated test data. The validated numerical models were employed to perform parametric studies in order to investigate elliptical <b>hollow</b> <b>sections</b> of varying slenderness and varying aspect ratios. The resulting structural performance data have been used to establish a relationship between cross-section slenderness and cross-section compressive resistance, which demonstrates that the Class 3 slenderness limit of 90 from Eurocode 3 for circular <b>hollow</b> <b>sections</b> can be safely adopted for elliptical <b>hollow</b> <b>sections</b> based upon the proposed cross-section slenderness parameter. The equivalent semi-compact slenderness limit given in BS 5950 - 1, non-compact limiting slenderness in AISC 360 - 05 and yield slenderness limit given in AS 4100 are also valid.
