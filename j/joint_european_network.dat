40|$|Existing coastal {{observatories}} in European {{waters are}} complex systems consisting of different observational components, providing crucial operational data for assessment, model validation and assimilation purposes. However, the geographical, structural, functional and operational heterogeneities that characterise them pose an enormous challenge to their efficient exploitation as information providers on a broader, cross-border, regional scale. To address this problem, the European Union (EU) Seventh Framework Programme (FP 7) Towards a <b>Joint</b> <b>European</b> Research Infrastructure <b>Network</b> for Coastal Observatories (JERICO) project {{is creating a}} shared, pan-European framework for the networking of such observatories, promoting the identification and dissemination of best practices for their design, implementation and maintenance, as well as common data distribution and transnational access protocols to enhance their performance and sustainability. In doing so, the project is also laying down {{the foundation for the}} coastal element of the nascent European Ocean Observing System...|$|R
40|$|Data sharing, {{interoperability}} {{and quality}} check {{are only a}} short part of the activities connected to the data management. Create a procedure to harmonize and disseminate heterogeneous data, collected by different meteo-oceanographic buoys in near real-time, is a challenge. In this paper, we describe a system for data validation, conversion in a homogeneous and standard format and dissemination adopting Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) using XML (eXtensible Markup Language) and OGC’s (Open Geospatial Consortium) standards. To {{meet the needs of}} different scientific communities as RITMARE (La Ricerca ITaliana per il MARE), Jerico (Towards a <b>joint</b> <b>European</b> research infrastructure <b>network</b> for coastal observatories), Copernicus, ODIP (Ocean Data Interoperability Platform) and FixO 3 (Fixed-point Open Ocean Observatories), we decided to adopt SWE standard allowing interoperability between data in near real-time, using Sensor Model Language (SensorML) and Observations and Measurements(O&M) standards in a Sensor Observation Service (SOS). ...|$|R
40|$|Complemental to {{the first}} FCT workshop, the {{metrology}} laboratory of Ifremer Centre de Bretagne carried out a calibration experiment from the 8 th to the 12 th of October 2012. This experiment was promoted by the Jerico <b>European</b> project (<b>JOINT</b> <b>EUROPEAN</b> RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE <b>NETWORK</b> FOR COASTAL OBSERVATORIES), {{in the framework of}} a collaborative work proposed by the workpackage 4, “Maintenance and Calibration”, and the “Forum for Coastal Technologies”. The purpose of this experiment was to compare the calibration methods used by different institutes or firms within an inter-laboratory comparison (ILC). In terms of metrology, this comparison will allow the laboratories to assess their performance with respect to the calibration of their sensors. The parameters under investigation were temperature, salinity (conductivity) and dissolved oxygen. To simplify the process and to shorten the time devoted to the comparison, Ifremer proposed to carry out for each participant, a bilateral comparison (Ifremer vs participant) on one or several sensors owned by the participant. All comparisons were simultaneous. The objective (institutes performance) was achieved by comparing the calibration results of the regular calibration of the sensors of the participants with the reference calibrations performed by the coordinating laboratory, the metrology laboratory of Ifremer. The evaluation of the performance was carried out using the reported deviations and/or corrections and corresponding uncertainties of the participants with respect to the measured deviations/corrections and corresponding uncertainties by the reference laborator...|$|R

40|$|<b>Joint</b> <b>European</b> Doctorate and <b>Network</b> in Fusion Science and Engineering (Università degli Studi di Padova) This thesis work {{consists}} of three pillars. First, the isotope dependence of long-range correlation (due to, e. g. zonal flow and GAMs) has been studied in the TJ-II stellarator and ISTTOK tokamak with dual Langmuir probes. In TJ-II, {{it has been found}} that LRC slightly decreases with isotope mass, in contrast to tokamak results. In ISTTOK, GAM amplitude {{has been found to be}} higher in D than H dominated plasmas, in agreement with other tokamak results. Using biorthogonal decomposition (BOD), GAM and low frequency coherent modes were separated; their spectral and spatial structure properties were studied. In addition, measurements of Reynolds stress and Maxwell stress have been made using an electromagnetic probe during L-H transition in TJ-II. Second, macroscale flows and non-diffusive behavior of particle dynamics have been found around magnetic islands in TJ-II and RFX-mod with the analysis of long-range spatial and temporal correlation (Hurst exponent). In TJ-II, during dynamic configuration scan experiments, rational surfaces have been found to affect the development of long-range spatial and temporal correlation. In RFX-mod, LRC has been detected at both sides of the m= 0 island. The possible relation between long-range temporal correlation (Hurst exponent) and the phase angle of magnetic perturbation was also studied. Third, a new strategy for studying plasma potential asymmetries in magnetic flux surface has been developed based on edge electrode biasing and probe measurements in TJ-II.
