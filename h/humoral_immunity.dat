5|$|Immunology {{made a great}} advance {{towards the}} end of the 19th century, through rapid developments, in the study of <b>humoral</b> <b>immunity</b> and {{cellular}} immunity. Particularly important was the work of Paul Ehrlich, who proposed the side-chain theory to explain the specificity of the antigen-antibody reaction; his contributions to the understanding of <b>humoral</b> <b>immunity</b> were recognized by the award of a Nobel Prize in 1908, which was jointly awarded to the founder of cellular immunology, Elie Metchnikoff.|$|E
5|$|Until this time, cell-mediated {{immunity}} and <b>humoral</b> <b>immunity</b> {{were considered to}} be contending theories to explain effective immune response, but the former lagged behind owing to lack of advanced techniques. Cell-mediated immunity got an impetus in its recognition and study when in 1942, Merrill Chase successfully transferred immunity against tuberculosis between pigs by transferring white blood cells.|$|E
5|$|In {{the course}} of normal immune response, parts of {{pathogens}} (e.g. bacteria) are recognized by the immune system as foreign (non-self), and eliminated or effectively neutralized to reduce their potential damage. Such a recognizable substance is called an antigen. The immune system may respond in multiple ways to an antigen; a key feature of this response is the production of antibodies by B cells (or B lymphocytes) involving {{an arm of the}} immune system known as <b>humoral</b> <b>immunity.</b> The antibodies are soluble and do not require direct cell-to-cell contact between the pathogen and the B-cell to function.|$|E

5|$|When the {{adaptive}} immune system of a vertebrate encounters a virus, it produces specific antibodies that bind to the virus and often render it non-infectious. This is called <b>humoral</b> <b>immunity.</b> Two types of antibodies are important. The first, called IgM, is highly effective at neutralising viruses but is produced by {{the cells of the}} immune system only for a few weeks. The second, called IgG, is produced indefinitely. The presence of IgM in the blood of the host is used to test for acute infection, whereas IgG indicates an infection sometime in the past. IgG antibody is measured when tests for immunity are carried out.|$|E
25|$|Adaptive {{immunity}} {{can also}} be divided {{by the type of}} immune mediators involved; <b>humoral</b> <b>immunity</b> is the aspect of immunity that is mediated by secreted antibodies, whereas cell mediated immunity involves T-lymphocytes alone. <b>Humoral</b> <b>immunity</b> is called active when the organism generates its own antibodies, and passive when antibodies are transferred between individuals or species. Similarly, cell mediated immunity is active when the organisms’ own T-cells are stimulated, and passive when T cells come from another organism.|$|E
25|$|Mucosal immunity, which {{includes}} immune {{function in the}} female reproductive tract, is not as well understood as <b>humoral</b> <b>immunity.</b> This may be an issue for certain contraceptive vaccines. For instance, in the second LDH-C4 primate trial that had negative results, all of the immunized macaque monkeys developed high antibody titers against LDH-C4 in serum, but antibodies against LDH-C4 were {{not found in the}} monkeys' vaginal fluids. If antibodies against LDH-C4 do indeed inhibit fertilization, then this result highlights how the difference in the functioning of mucosal immunity from <b>humoral</b> <b>immunity</b> may be critical to the efficacy of contraceptive vaccines.|$|E
40|$|A higher {{incidence}} of malignancy as well as greater susceptibility to infection {{has been found to}} be associated with primary immunodeficiencies. An increased incidence of leukemia has been associated with X-linked infantile agammaglobulinemia-an isolated defect of <b>humoral</b> <b>immunities.</b> An increased frequency of a wide variety of malignancies have been found to accompany several different forms of primary immunodeficiency. Secondary immunodeficiencies produced by immunosuppressant therapy to facilitate renal transplantation have also been found to have far too much cancer to be explained by chance assocaition. Many experimental associations between immunity and malignancy have also been encountered, indicating that these two adaptive processes have an essential relationship that must be elucidated...|$|R

40|$|The long pentraxin (PTX) 3 is {{produced}} by macrophages and myeloid dendritic cells in response to Toll-like receptor agonists and represents a nonredundant component of <b>humoral</b> innate <b>immunity</b> against selected pathogens. We report that, unexpectedly, PTX 3 is stored in specific granules and undergoes release in response to microbial recognition and inflammatory signals. Released PTX 3 can partially localize in neutrophil extracellular traps formed by extruded DNA. Eosinophils and basophils do not contain preformed PTX 3. PTX 3 -deficient neutrophils have defective microbial recognition and phagocytosis, and PTX 3 is nonredundant for neutrophil-mediated resistance against Aspergillus fumigatus. Thus, neutrophils serve as a reservoir, ready for rapid release, of the long PTX 3, {{a key component of}} <b>humoral</b> innate <b>immunity</b> with opsonic activity...|$|R
25|$|The bursa of fabricius, {{also known}} as the cloacal bursa, is a lymphoid organ which aids in the {{production}} of B lymphocytes during <b>humoral</b> <b>immunity.</b> The bursa of fabricius is present during juvenile stages but curls up, and in the sparrow is not visible after the sparrow reaches sexual maturity.|$|E
25|$|Glucocorticoids also {{suppress}} the <b>humoral</b> <b>immunity,</b> thereby causing a humoral immune deficiency. Glucocorticoids cause B cells to express smaller amounts of IL-2 and of IL-2 receptors. This diminishes both B cell clone expansion and antibody synthesis. The diminished amounts of IL-2 also cause fewer T lymphocyte cells to be activated.|$|E
25|$|There {{are still}} {{remnants}} {{of the theory of}} the four humors in the current medical language.

40|$|Major {{histocompatibility}} complex (MHC) molecules {{play an important}} role in antigen presentation for induction of tumor as well as cellular and <b>humoral</b> <b>immunities.</b> Recent studies using anti-MHC antibodies demonstrated that antibodies specific for HLA class I molecules induced cellular activation and a type of apoptosis that may be distinct from Fas-dependent or TNFR (tumor necrosis factor-a receptor) -dependent processes. We purified a previously untested apoptosis-inducing factor from HL- 60 human leukemic cell-conditioned media to homogeneity and sequenced it. It was identified as b 2 -microglobulin (b 2 m), which has been previ-ously known as thymotaxin and is a part of the HLA class I antigen complex. b 2 m acts on both T-leukemic cells and myeloid leukemic cells to induce apoptosis, which then activates caspase 1 and 3.

40|$|Parasites vary {{geographically}} and dispersing host {{individuals may}} encounter different strains and wider varieties than their philopatric counterparts. Previously observed lower parasite counts in philopatric than dispersing birds {{have been suggested}} {{to be the result}} of local adaptation to parasites, but I suggest an alternative: these patterns may result from differing immune function. I used genetic assignment tests to infer natal philopatry of song sparrows (Melospiza melodia), and tested whether this predicted parasitism and innate and adaptive immune function. I found no relationship between parasitism and philopatry, in contrast to previous findings. In females, philopatry was associated with higher cellular innate <b>immunity</b> and lower <b>humoral</b> innate <b>immunity.</b> I also detected a negative relationship between measures of cellular adaptive <b>immunity</b> and <b>humoral</b> innate <b>immunity.</b> These results suggest a sex-specific, philopatry-mediated immune tradeoff that occurs along the cellular-humoral axis, rather than the innate-adaptive axis traditionally focused on in ecophysiological life history...|$|R
25|$|The <b>humoral</b> <b>immunity</b> instigated by {{infection}} with the wild type {{is thought to}} be a very common event. The associated neutralising activity limits the usefulness of the most commonly used serotype AAV2 in certain applications. Accordingly, the majority of clinical trials currently under way involve delivery of AAV2 into the brain, a relatively immunologically privileged organ. In the brain, AAV2 is strongly neuron-specific.|$|E
25|$|In {{patients}} with HIV, infections {{may be more}} frequent, may cause prolonged bouts of dirty brown diarrhea, and may be more commonly associated with bacteremia and antibiotic resistance. In participants of unprotected anal intercourse, campylobacteriosis is more localized to the distal end of the colon and may be termed a proctocolitis. The severity and persistence of infection in {{patients with}} AIDS and hypogammaglobulinemia indicates that both cell-mediated and <b>humoral</b> <b>immunity</b> are important in preventing and terminating infection.|$|E
25|$|The {{virus is}} known to {{instigate}} robust <b>humoral</b> <b>immunity</b> in animal models and in the human population, where up to 80% of individuals {{are thought to be}} seropositive for AAV2. Antibodies are known to be neutralising, and for gene therapy applications these do impact on vector transduction efficiency via some routes of administration. As well as persistent AAV specific antibody levels, it appears from both prime-boost studies in animals and from clinical trials that the B-cell memory is also strong. In seropositive humans, circulating IgG antibodies for AAV2 appear to be primarily composed of the IgG1 and IgG2 subclasses, with little or no IgG3 or IgG4 present.|$|E
40|$|Natural” Igs, mainly IgM, {{comprise}} part of {{the innate}} immune system present in healthy individuals, including antigen-free mice. These Igs are thought to delay pathogenicity of infecting agents until antigen-induced high affinity Igs of all isotypes are produced. Previous studies suggested that the acquired humoral response arises directly from the innate response, i. e., that B cells expressing natural IgM, upon antigen encounter, differentiate to give rise both to cells that secrete high amounts of IgM and to cells that undergo affinity maturation and isotype switching. However, by using a murine model of influenza virus infection, we demonstrate here that the B cells that produce natural antiviral IgM neither increase their IgM production nor undergo isotype switching to IgG 2 a {{in response to the}} infection. These cells are distinct from the B cells that produce the antiviral response after encounter with the pathogen. Our data therefore demonstrate that the innate and the acquired <b>humoral</b> <b>immunities</b> to influenza virus are separate effector arms of the immune system and that antigen exposure per se is not sufficient to increase natural antibody production...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, the {{amphibians}} {{have received}} much attention {{in terms of}} both phylogenetic and ontogenetic origins of immunity in lower vertebrates (for recent reviews, see Du Pasquier, 1973; Cooper, 1973). Among well-studied anuran amphibians, the correlation between the ontogeny of the immune response and the lymphoid system development has been best documented in Xenopus laevis (Horton, 1969; Kidder et al., 1973). Thus, transplantation as well as certain <b>humoral</b> <b>immunities</b> may be dependent on the lymphoid differentiation in the thymus (Horton and Manning, 1972, 1974; Turner and Manning, 1974). In mor-phological aspects, however, it seems rather peculiar that the larval Xenopus reportedly possesses a negligible amount of lymphoid tissues associated with the post-pharyngeal region of the gastro-intestinal tract, as contrasted with other species of anuran larvae where an abundant lymphocytic infiltration has been found along {{the entire length of the}} digestive tract (Du Pasquier, 1968; Horton, 1971 a, b). The importance of the lymphoid distribution along the intestinal canal has been suggested in an extensive study by Fichtelius et al. (1968) of the morphologica...|$|R
40|$|The {{interleukin}} (IL) - 12 family, {{which is}} composed of heterodimeric cytokines including IL- 12, IL- 23, and IL- 27, is produced by antigen-presenting cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells and plays critical roles in the regulation of helper T (Th) cell differentiation. IL- 12 induces IFN- production by NK and T cells and differentiation to Th 1 cells. IL- 23 induces IL- 17 production by memory T cells and expands and maintains inflammatory Th 17 cells. IL- 27 induces the early Th 1 differentiation and generation of IL- 10 -producing regulatory T cells. In addition, these cytokines induce distinct immune responses to tumors. IL- 12 activates signal transducers and activator of transcription (STAT) 4 and enhances antitumor cellular immunity through interferon (IFN) - production. IL- 27 activates STAT 1, as does IFN- and STAT 3 as well, and enhances antitumor immunity by augmenting cellular and <b>humoral</b> <b>immunities.</b> In contrast, although exogenously overexpressed IL- 23 enhances antitumor immunity via memory T cells, endogenous IL- 23 promotes protumor immunity through STAT 3 activation by inducing inflammatory responses including IL- 17 production...|$|R
25|$|The {{adaptive}} immune system, {{also known}} as the acquired immune system or, more rarely, as the specific immune system, is a subsystem of the overall immune system that is composed of highly specialized, systemic cells and processes that eliminate pathogens or prevent their growth. The adaptive immune system is one of the two main immunity strategies found in vertebrates (the other being the innate immune system). Adaptive immunity creates immunological memory after an initial response to a specific pathogen, and leads to an enhanced response to subsequent encounters with that pathogen. This process of acquired immunity is the basis of vaccination. Like the innate system, the adaptive system includes both <b>humoral</b> <b>immunity</b> components and cell-mediated immunity components.|$|E
25|$|The {{human body}} has many defense {{mechanisms}} against pathogens, {{one of which}} is <b>humoral</b> <b>immunity.</b> This defence mechanism produces antibodies (large glycoproteins) in response to an immune stimulus. Many cells of the immune system are required for this process, including lymphocytes (T-cells and B-cells) and antigen presenting cells. These cells coordinate an immune response upon the detection of foreign proteins (antigens), producing antibodies that bind to these antigens. In normal physiology, lymphocytes that recognise human proteins (autoantigens) either undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis) or become non-functional. This self-tolerance means that lymphocytes should not incite an immune response against human cellular antigens. Sometimes, however, this process malfunctions and antibodies are produced against human antigens, which may lead to autoimmune disease.|$|E
25|$|Passive {{immunity}} is {{the transfer}} of active <b>humoral</b> <b>immunity</b> {{in the form of}} ready-made antibodies. Passive immunity can occur naturally, when maternal antibodies are transferred to the fetus through the placenta, and it can also be induced artificially, when high levels of antibodies specific to a pathogen or toxin (obtained from humans, horses, or other animals) are transferred to non-immune persons through blood products that contain antibodies, such as in immunoglobulin therapy or antiserum therapy. Passive immunization is used when there is a high risk of infection and insufficient time for the body to develop its own immune response, or to reduce the symptoms of ongoing or immunosuppressive diseases. Passive immunization can be provided when people cannot synthesize antibodies, and when they have been exposed to a disease {{that they do not have}} immunity against.|$|E

25|$|Bacterial and fungal {{infection}}s {{are common in}} ALF, with one study demonstrating culture-proven infection in 80% of ALF patients. Defective cellular and <b>humoral</b> <b>immunity</b> as well as presence of indwelling catheters, coma, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and medications that suppress immunity all predispose to infection. Localizing symptoms of infection such as fever and sputum production are frequently absent and the only clues to an underlying infectious process may be worsening of encephalopathy or renal function. There must be a low threshold for obtaining frequent cultures (blood, urine, and sputum), chest radiographs, and paracentesis. Bacteria that enter through the skin, such as streptococci and staphylococci, tend to predominate. Aggressive surveillance is essential as prophylactic antibiotics have shown little benefit. Fungal infections, particularly {{in the setting of}} broad-spectrum antibiotics, are also common, and disseminated fungemia is a poor prognostic sign.|$|E
25|$|Increasingly, {{there is}} strong {{evidence}} from mouse and human-based scientific studies of a broader diversity in CD4+ effector T helper cell subsets. Regulatory T (Treg) cells, {{have been identified as}} important negative regulators of adaptive immunity as they limit and suppresses the immune system to control aberrant immune responses to self-antigens; an important mechanism in controlling the development of autoimmune diseases. Follicular helper T (Tfh) cells are another distinct population of effector CD4+ T cells that develop from naive T cells post-antigen activation. Tfh cells are specialized in helping B cell <b>humoral</b> <b>immunity</b> as they are uniquely capable of migrating to follicular B cells in secondary lymphoid organs and provide them positive paracrine signals to enable the generation and recall production of high-quality affinity-matured antibodies. Similar to Tregs, Tfh cells also play a role in immunological tolerance as an abnormal expansion of Tfh cell numbers can lead to unrestricted autoreactive antibody production causing severe systemic autoimmune disorders.|$|E
25|$|T cells (thymus cells) and B cells (bone marrow- or bursa-derived cells) are {{the major}} {{cellular}} components of the adaptive immune response. T cells are involved in cell-mediated immunity, whereas B cells are primarily responsible for <b>humoral</b> <b>immunity</b> (relating to antibodies). The function of T cells and B cells is to recognize specific “non-self” antigens, during {{a process known as}} antigen presentation. Once they have identified an invader, the cells generate specific responses that are tailored to maximally eliminate specific pathogens or pathogen-infected cells. B cells respond to pathogens by producing large quantities of antibodies which then neutralize foreign objects like bacteria and viruses. In response to pathogens some T cells, called T helper cells, produce cytokines that direct the immune response, while other T cells, called cytotoxic T cells, produce toxic granules that contain powerful enzymes which induce the death of pathogen-infected cells. Following activation, B cells and T cells leave a lasting legacy of the antigens they have encountered, in the form of memory cells. Throughout the lifetime of an animal, these memory cells will remember each specific pathogen encountered, and are able to mount a strong and rapid response if the same pathogen is detected again; this is known as acquired immunity.|$|E
