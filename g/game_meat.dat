5|$|David and her editor Jill Norman had {{discussed}} such a book {{as early as}} the 1970s, but work on other projects precluded it. After David's death, Norman found when sorting out her papers that David had written and compiled far more material on a Christmas theme than anyone else had realised. Among the papers was an introduction that David had written for the projected volume, in which she said that one of her motives for writing a book about Christmas cooking was to head off the annual last-minute requests for recipes from her friends and relations. Those she had found most frequently asked for formed the core of the book. Together with some Christmas recipes from Mediterranean Food, French Provincial Cooking, and Spices, Salt and Aromatics in the English Kitchen, and revised articles published in previous years in magazines, they were turned into a 214-page book. The chapters dealt with the social and historical side of Christmas, first courses and cold meats, soups, poultry and <b>game,</b> <b>meat,</b> vegetables and salads, sauces, pickles and chutneys, and desserts, cakes and drinks.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{the absence}} of {{contemporary}} culinary utensils such as the refrigerator, gas stovetops and ovens, the Indigenous resorted to other means to prepare their food. Upon bringing back hunted <b>game</b> <b>meat,</b> the Aborigines would preserve the meat with either millet wine or salt. Another cooking technique involved the heating up of stones by fire, which are then placed inside a vessel with other certain meats and seafood, which are cooked from the heat of the stones. Foods were mostly prepared by steaming, boiling or roasting, in order to infuse flavours together, yet preserve the original flavours. This again is contrasted with the Han, who adopted skills like stir-frying and stewing. Meat was also put on a bamboo spit and cooked over the fire.|$|E

5000|$|It {{is unclear}} if a tort of {{invasion}} of privacy exists under Australian law. The ALRC summarised the position in 2007:"In Australia, no jurisdiction has enshrined in legislation a cause of action for {{invasion of privacy}}; however, {{the door to the}} development of such a cause of action at common law has been left open by the High Court in Australian Broadcasting Corporation v Lenah <b>Game</b> <b>Meats</b> Pty Ltd (Lenah <b>Game</b> <b>Meats).</b> To date, two lower courts have held that such a cause of action is part of the common law of Australia. ..." [...] "At common law, the major obstacle to the recognition in Australia of a right to privacy was, before 2001, the 1937 High Court decision in Victoria Park Racing and Recreation Grounds Co Ltd v Taylor (Victoria Park). In a subsequent decision, the High Court in Lenah <b>Game</b> <b>Meats</b> indicated clearly that the decision in Victoria Park 'does not stand {{in the path of the}} development of … a cause of action (for invasion of privacy)'. The elements of such a cause of action — and whether the cause of action is to be left to the common law tradition of incremental development or provided for in legislation — remain open questions." ...|$|R
50|$|As to the {{question}} of privacy, the High Court subsequently declared in ABC v Lenah <b>Game</b> <b>Meats</b> Pty Ltd that Victoria Park was not a case about privacy. Rather, it was concerned with allocating the right to appropriate and control how information can be made public.|$|R
25|$|To be sure, {{the self-proclaimed}} king's realm {{amounted}} {{to just the}} immediate region around his small town. To his west and south, he was still hemmed in by Prome and Dala, ruled by Pagan princes, Thihathu of Prome and Kyawswa of Dala, respectively. To his east, the Martaban (Mottama) province was controlled by another rebel Wareru. To his north, Thawun Gyi {{was in charge of}} Toungoo (Taungoo). Since the king did not control any of their surrounding regions, the Pegu leadership believed that they would be low on the king's priority list, and their defensive preparations progressed slowly. However, to their surprise, the king managed to send a small army to Pegu. When the army showed up at their doorstep, they readily surrendered. They convinced the commander that it had been a misunderstanding all along, and that they remained loyal to the king. Their deception was successful. But later that night, the Pagan general and the staff died from eating the poisoned dried <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> offered to them by Akhamaman's men. After the death of the general, the remaining troops retreated. The king ordered another expedition but Pegu was now ready. The army could not take the well-stockaded town, and had to retreat.|$|E

The meat of females is more tender than that of males, and is the most tender during the autumn season. Wildebeest are a regular target for illegal meat hunters because their numbers make them easy to find. Cooks preparing the wildebeest carcass usually cut it into 11 pieces.

500|$|According to archeological evidence, Native Americans {{first arrived}} in the Glacier area some 10,000 years ago. The {{earliest}} occupants with lineage to current tribes were the Flathead (Salish) and Kootenai, Shoshone, and Cheyenne. The Blackfeet arrived around {{the beginning of the}} 18th century and soon dominated the eastern slopes of what later became the park, as well as the Great Plains immediately to the east. The park region provided the Blackfeet shelter from the harsh winter winds of the plains, allowing them to supplement their traditional bison hunts with other <b>game</b> <b>meat.</b> Today, the Blackfeet Indian Reservation borders the park in the east, while the Flathead Indian Reservation is located west and south of the park. When the Blackfeet Reservation was first established in 1855 by the Lame Bull Treaty, it included the eastern area of the current park up to the Continental Divide. To the Blackfeet, the mountains of this area, especially Chief Mountain and the region in the southeast at Two Medicine, were considered the [...] "Backbone of the World" [...] and were frequented during vision quests. In 1895 Chief White Calf of the Blackfeet authorized the sale of the mountain area, some , to the U.S. government for , with the understanding that they would maintain usage rights to the land for hunting as long as the ceded stripe will be public land of the United States.
