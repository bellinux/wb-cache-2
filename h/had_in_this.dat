25|$|The {{military}} historian Siborne {{stated that}} it appeared to Napoleon that Blücher had taken up a position perpendicular to the Namur road, and <b>had,</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> way, completely exposed his right flank; whence he inferred that Blücher placed great reliance upon the arrival of auxiliary forces from Wellington's army.|$|E
25|$|The {{military}} historian William Siborne postulates {{that the}} outcome of Quatre Bras and Ligny put the two Coalition armies {{in a position where}} they could unite after the concentration of each army had been accomplished; hitherto, they had been compelled to meet their opponents before they had succeeded in collecting their respective forces. If, however, Wellington had been unable to maintain his ground against Ney, and Napoleon <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> manner succeeded in beating both armies in detail; or, if the Prussian defeat had been followed up by a vigorous pursuit, the loss of the Battle of Ligny might have placed both armies in a critical position.|$|E

Onetime CBS News president Dick Salant, the executive who preceded and later succeeded Friendly in the role, wrote in his memoirs that Friendly's problem was compounded by his inability to make such a request directly to the top CBS management (William S. Paley and Frank Stanton), as previous CBS News presidents <b>had.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> case, Friendly had to go through a new supervisor at the executive level, CBS Broadcast Group president Jack Schneider.|$|E

He saw an opponent's {{weakness}} in a second. [...] Time and time again, he got a champion batsman's wicket by putting on a bowler he knew the batsman did not like." [...] The English batsman K. S. Ranjitsinhji considered Trott as a captain [...] "without a superior anywhere today". Wisden thought him, [...] "with the exception of ... incomparably the best captain the Australians had ever <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> country." [...] The sporting newspaper The Referee wrote, [...] " [...] bowlers felt he understood the gruelling nature of their work and that they had his sympathy in the grimmest of battles." [...] Some English professional cricketers thought less of Trott's captaincy; wicket-keeper William Storer said, [...] "I like a captain to have a settled plan, [...] just seemed to do whatever he thought of at the moment." ...|$|E

Powell admitted to being [...] "amazed" [...] with the film after viewing it and was very grateful at having had the privilege to portray Ziegfeld, considering {{it to be a}} very important moment in his career. He said, [...] "After seeing this film I can see that most of the characters I have played before were contrived. They had no 'folks', as the character of Ziegfeld <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> picture. Their father was a pen and their mother was a bottle of ink.

He commented about the event first by saying that the energy of the event was 100 times that of the 1933 Long Beach earthquake. In statements made in the July 22 Los Angeles Times, the shock was compared to the 1857 Fort Tejon event. He went on to say, [...] "There is no doubt that yesterday's quake is the largest Southern California has <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> century and is the largest to occur in this area since modern instruments were available. It's possible that the 1857 quake might have been more intense." [...] Charles Richter departed the lab in Pasadena in a mobile seismograph truck bound for the epicentral area to record aftershocks close to the fault, and Harry O. Wood [...] (the founder of the lab thirty years prior) visited the lab following the onset of the shocks and commented that it was still not possible to predict the location of large earthquakes.|$|E

Soon Nadson became Merezhkovsky's closest friend – in fact, the only one, apart from his mother. Later researchers suggested there was some mystery shared by the two young men, something to do with [...] "fatal illness, fear of death and longing for faith as an antidote to such fear."

2500|$|At {{the start}} of the 19th century, Louisiana was a small {{producer}} of sugar with {{a relatively small number of}} slaves, compared to Saint-Domingue and the West Indies. It soon thereafter became a major sugar producer as new settlers arrived to develop plantations. William C. C. Claiborne, Louisiana's first United States governor, said that African slave labor was needed because white laborers [...] "cannot be <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> unhealthy climate." [...] Hugh Thomas wrote that Claiborne was unable to enforce the abolition of the African slave trade, which the US and Great Britain adopted in 1808. The United States continued to protect the domestic slave trade, including the coastwise trade – the transport of slaves by ship along the Atlantic Coast and to New Orleans and other Gulf ports.|$|E
2500|$|One {{advantage}} Rachmaninoff <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> building process {{over most}} of his contemporaries was in approaching the pieces he played {{from the perspective of}} a composer rather than that of an interpreter.

You can make contact with their imaginations, knowing something of their problems and their ideals. You can give their works color. That is the most important thing for me in my interpretations, color. So you make music live. Without color it is dead." [...] Nevertheless, Rachmaninoff also possessed a far better sense of structure than many of his contemporaries, such as Hofmann, or the majority of pianists from the previous generation, judging from their respective recordings.|$|E

2500|$|In {{considering}} whether a pecuniary or proprietary interest exists, it is irrelevant whether the decision-maker was actually biased or not when exercising {{his or her}} powers. Though it may be practically possible to exercise impartiality in such a situation, it is the appearance of justice {{that lies at the}} root of this principle of natural justice. In Dimes, certiorari was granted to quash Lord Cottenham's decree due to his pecuniary interest in the outcome of the case even though, as Lord Campbell stated, [...] "o one can suppose that Lord Cottenham could be, in the remotest degree, influenced by the interest that he <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> concern". Similarly, in the Alkaff case Acting Chief Justice Terrell noted that the rule against bias applied even though, quoting the trial judge, [...] " [...] was in fact completely unbiased.

Helgren said: [...] "There are few 'good news' stories to be <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> war and wars by definition are tales of violence.
