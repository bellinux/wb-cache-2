5|$|At the Packard residence, Pete Martell (Jack Nance) is fixing {{himself a}} midnight snack.

Tojamura coyly reveals {{that he is}} actually Catherine Martell (Piper Laurie) in <b>disguise.</b> <b>The</b> two embrace as Pete emotionally dissolves.|$|E
5|$|Operation Graffham was a {{military}} deception employed by the Allies during the Second World War. It formed part of Operation Bodyguard, a broad strategic deception designed to <b>disguise</b> <b>the</b> imminent Allied invasion of Normandy. Graffham provided political support to the visual and wireless deception of Operation Fortitude North. These operations together created a fictional threat to Norway {{during the summer of}} 1944.|$|E

Half of the engineers' boats were too far west to be used (43rd Division mistakenly believing the crossing points used by the Dorsets the previous night were in British hands), slowing the evacuation process. The Germans shelled the withdrawal, believing {{it to be a}} resupply attempt. At 05:00, the operation was ceased lest the coming light enable the Germans to fire onto the boats more accurately.|$|E

5|$|Major Danuta Ślązak of the Home Army, hid {{out with}} a group of wounded {{patients}} whom she had saved from a hospital that had been set on fire by the Germans during {{the last days of the}} uprising. After the war she wrote a book about her experiences, Byłam Warszawskim Robinsonem (I was a Warsaw Robinson). A portion of her group left the hiding place after German troops called out for them to surrender and were immediately executed. The rest remained hidden and escaped detection. Eventually they used the corpses of their murdered companions to <b>disguise</b> <b>the</b> entry to their hiding place.|$|E
5|$|On 7 September 2007, {{following}} the security breach {{on the previous}} day, Taylor, Reucassel, Dominic Knight and their film crew were detained and questioned over a follow-up stunt.

For example, several relatives of Henry VIII survived the disease but were scarred by it. These include his sister Margaret, Queen of Scotland, his fourth wife, Anne of Cleves, and his two daughters: Mary I of England in 1527 and Elizabeth I of England in 1562 (as an adult she would often try to <b>disguise</b> <b>the</b> pockmarks with heavy makeup). His great-niece, Mary, Queen of Scots, contracted the disease as a child but had no visible scarring.|$|E
5|$|The {{destruction}} of the Tuileries Palace affected the aesthetic relationship between the Palais du Louvre and the Arc de Triomphe, as it could now be seen that the two structures {{were not on the}} same axis. The Palais des Tuileries had served to <b>disguise</b> <b>the</b> fact that the Palais du Louvre is skewed slightly (6.33°) relative to the Axe historique (also known as the Voie Triomphale), a seven-kilometre straight line of structures and thoroughfares, including the Place de la Concorde, Champs-Élysées, the Arc de Triomphe and the Grande Arche de La Défense.|$|E

5|$|To remain undetected, {{the player}} can perform {{techniques}} which {{make use of}} both Solid Snake's abilities and the environment, such as crawling under objects, using boxes as cover, ducking or hiding around walls, and making noise to distract enemies. An on-screen radar provides the player with location of nearby enemies and their field of vision. Snake can also make use of many items and gadgets, such as infra-red goggles and a cardboard box <b>disguise.</b> <b>The</b> emphasis on stealth promotes a less violent form of gameplay, as fights against large groups of enemies will often result in serious damage for the player.|$|E
5|$|Brummer and Bremse were {{fitted with}} masts {{similar to the}} British Arethusa-class cruisers, and {{similarly}} to the British ships, the masts could be lowered and stored on the superstructure deck. Their bow was also modeled on the Arethusa-class ships to further <b>disguise</b> <b>the</b> vessels. The ships had a complement of 16officers and 293enlisted men. They carried several smaller vessels, including one picket boat, one barge, and two dinghies. The German Navy regarded the ships as excellent sea boats, having gentle motion. The ships were highly maneuverable and had a tight turning radius, and only lost slight speed in a head sea. In hard turns, they lost up to sixty percent speed. They were very , however.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} months of the war, Goebbels' speeches and {{articles}} took on an increasingly apocalyptic tone. By the beginning of 1945, with the Soviets on the Oder River and the Western Allies preparing to cross the Rhine, he could no longer <b>disguise</b> <b>the</b> fact that defeat was inevitable. Berlin had {{little in the way of}} fortifications or artillery (or even Volkssturm units, 'civilian soldiers'), as almost everything had been sent to the front. Goebbels noted in his diary on 21 January that millions of Germans were fleeing westward. He tentatively discussed with Hitler the issue of making peace overtures to the western allies, but Hitler again refused. Privately, Goebbels was conflicted at pushing the case with Hitler since he did not want to lose the confidence of his Führer.|$|E

5|$|Nickell, Pederson, and Rossow {{looked for}} effects with {{significant}} years. They asked 83 undergraduate students to rate, {{on a scale}} from 1 to 7, how much they liked the years between 1976 and 2001, the months of the year, the seasons, times of day, and even types of pet in an attempt to <b>disguise</b> <b>the</b> aim of the study. Analysis of the data showed that participants liked the year of their birth much more than the average of the four years after they were born. The researchers also found that the year of high school graduation was also liked better than average. Of the months of the year, the most liked month was the one in which the participants were born.|$|E
5|$|Research into medieval foodways was, until around 1980, a much {{neglected}} {{field of}} study. Misconceptions and outright errors were common among historians, {{and are still}} present in {{as a part of}} the popular view of the Middle Ages as a backward, primitive and barbaric era. Medieval cookery was described as revolting due to the often unfamiliar combination of flavors, the perceived lack of vegetables and a liberal use of spices. The heavy use of spices has been popular as an argument to support the claim that spices were employed to <b>disguise</b> <b>the</b> flavor of spoiled meat, a conclusion without support in historical fact and contemporary sources. Fresh meat could be procured throughout the year by those who could afford it. The preservation techniques available at the time, although crude by today's standards, were perfectly adequate. The astronomical cost and high prestige of spices, and thereby the reputation of the host, would have been effectively undone if wasted on cheap and poorly handled foods.|$|E
5|$|Vietnamese {{migrant workers}} started to arrive from 1992 onwards {{due to the}} {{creation}} of new job opportunities by the UNTAC administration. At the same time, the UNTAC administration allowed the opening of political offices and political parties such as FUNCINPEC and the BLDP began to propagate anti-Vietnamese sentiments among the populace to shore up electorate support in the 1993 general elections. In November 1992, the Khmer Rouge which controlled northwestern parts of Cambodia, passed a resolution to target systematic killings of Vietnamese soldiers and civilians. The first guerrilla-style attacks by the Khmer Rouge on Vietnamese civilians started in December 1992, and Khmer Rouge soldiers justified the killings by claiming that some of the civilians were Vietnamese soldiers in <b>disguise.</b> <b>The</b> spate of killings by Khmer Rouge prompted some 21,000 ethnic Vietnamese to flee to Vietnam in March 1993.|$|E
