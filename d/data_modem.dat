50|$|Apple {{introduced}} its first true modems in 1984, the Apple Modem 300 & 1200 modems (V21/V22). Prior to that they offered {{a third party}} Apple-badged comparatively low-tech acoustic coupler. Those were followed by the industry standard 2400/data and combined 9600/fax (V29) AppleFax Modem in 1987. Apple introduced the internal 2400 data/fax modem card for its Macintosh Portable in 1989 as well as released its last external desktop Apple <b>Data</b> <b>Modem</b> 2400. Only standard internal modems were offered during the 1990s through 2005, with the notable exception of Apple's foray into GeoPort passive telephony modems which relied heavily upon the computer's software and processing power rather than dedicated hardware (like Apple's proprietary internal Express Modem). The Apple USB Modem is Apple's first true external modem since the Apple <b>Data</b> <b>Modem</b> 2400 was discontinued in 1992.|$|E

In 1956 six manufacturers were allowed to supply PABXs directly to users, although the equipment was both manufactured to Post Office specifications and maintained by the Post Office. Today we have answering machines, autodiallers, facsimile, <b>data</b> <b>modems,</b> etc. The recent Eurodata study {{of the growth of}} data terminals in Europe predicts that the number of terminals in Western Europe will grow from 625 000 in 1979 to 3 960 000 by 1987. ...|$|R

5000|$|The DTR {{signal is}} an {{important}} call control signal for a <b>data</b> <b>modem.</b> According to the RS232 standard, dropping DTR from active to inactive {{for at least two}} seconds tells the modem to disconnect (end) a call or data connection. When a modem is being used for automatic answering (such as with the command ATS0=1), the DTR signal confirms to the modem that the computer is available to accept a call.|$|E
5000|$|A {{fax modem}} enables a {{computer}} to transmit and receive documents as faxes on a telephone line. A fax modem is like a <b>data</b> <b>modem</b> but is designed to transmit and receive documents to and from a fax machine or another fax modem. Some, but not all, fax modems do double duty as data modems. As with other modems, fax modems can be internal or external. Internal fax modems are often called fax boards.|$|E
50|$|Error {{correction}} adds extra {{data bits}} {{to make the}} transmission of data more robust to disturbances present on the transmission channel. The ordinary user {{may not be aware}} of many applications using error correction. A typical music CD uses the Reed-Solomon code to correct for scratches and dust. In this application the transmission channel is the CD itself. Cell phones also use coding techniques to correct for the fading and noise of high frequency radio transmission. <b>Data</b> <b>modems,</b> telephone transmissions, and NASA all employ channel coding techniques to get the bits through, for example the turbo code and LDPC codes.|$|R

50|$|A modem (modulator-demodulator) is {{a network}} {{hardware}} device that modulates {{one or more}} carrier wave signals to encode digital information for transmission and demodulates signals to decode the transmitted information. The goal is to produce a signal that can be transmitted easily and decoded to reproduce the original digital <b>data.</b> <b>Modems</b> {{can be used with}} any means of transmitting analog signals, from light emitting diodes to radio. A common type of modem is one that turns the digital data of a computer into modulated electrical signal for transmission over telephone lines and demodulated by another modem at the receiver side to recover the digital data.|$|R
50|$|A {{voice modem}} is an analog {{telephone}} <b>data</b> <b>modem</b> {{with a built-in}} capability of transmitting and receiving voice recordings over the phone line. Voice modems are used for telephony and answering machine applications. Similar to the Hayes command set used for data modems, in which the host PC commands the modem via a series of commands known as AT commands, there exists a well-defined set of common voice AT commands that are somewhat consistent throughout the industry.|$|E
50|$|In 1979, he {{pioneered the}} {{development}} of the first, integrated-circuit, <b>data</b> <b>modem</b> using Metal Oxide Semiconductor (MOS) silicon switched-capacitor filters and a patented Automatic Gain Control circuit. This was the first mixed analog-digital integrated circuit/system to go into manufacture. This technology has now grown into a multi-billion dollar industry. In the 1980s Tompsett applied himself to finding a solution to a major challenge to reduce the size, power and cost of digitizing video signals from imagers and scanners. He invented an integrated, two-step recycling video analog-digital converter.|$|E

The reasoning behind the multiple chips was to address additional markets such as USB modems, e-readers, gaming devices and machine to machine commercial applications. Qualcomm also introduced software enhancements for select Mobile <b>Data</b> <b>Modem</b> (MDM) chipsets that enabled “a common Gobi software interface (API) across multiple hardware platforms.” ...|$|E
5000|$|In telephony, [...] "echo" [...] is {{very much}} like what one would {{experience}} yelling in a canyon. Echo is the reflected copy of one's voice heard some time later and a delayed version of the original. On a telephone, if the delay is fairly significant (more than a few hundred milliseconds), it is considered annoying. If the delay is very small (10s of milliseconds or less), the phenomenon is called sidetone, and while not objectionable to humans, can interfere with the communication between <b>data</b> <b>modems.</b> If the delay is slightly longer, around 50 milliseconds, humans cannot hear the echo as a distinct sound, but instead hear a chorus effect which sounds like talking in a tunnel or cave.|$|R
5000|$|Most of modems seen {{in market}} {{at this time}} support autobaud. Before {{receiving}} any input <b>data,</b> most <b>modem</b> use a default baud rate 9600 for default output baud rate. For example, the following modems have been verified for autobaud and default output baud rate 9600.|$|R
50|$|There is also {{an export}} version that {{incorporates}} Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption rather than UK Government Type 1 Crypto. The radio offers a link throughput (terminal to terminal) of 500 kbit/s. A deployment of over 200 HCDR-equipped military vehicles can automatically configure and self manage into a fully connected autonomous mesh network intercommunicating using mobile ad hoc network (MANET) protocols. The radio is an IPv4-compliant three-port router having a radio port, Ethernet port and PPP serial port. The 20-watt radio has adaptive transmit power and adaptive forward error correction and can optimally achieve ground ranges up to 15 km with omnidirectional antennas. A maritime version allows radio LAN operation within flotillas of naval ships up to 20 km apart. The radio features coded modulation with internal wide-band or narrow band radio <b>data</b> <b>modems.</b>|$|R
