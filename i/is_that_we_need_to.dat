5000|$|The main use of {{unconditional}} in Christianity is {{the assertion}} [...] "That God so loved the world..." [...] In other words, God loves the world enough to suffer for us without preconditions. There is then that postcondition of actually accepting that Grace. The two together are not {{fundamentally different from}} psychology's unconditional positive regard with the added proviso that some actions are inherently flawed and that only God knows the true nature and consequence of our actions. Whereas psychology's unconditional positive regard allows one to fail utterly since the psychologist can not demand that {{we take care of}} the whole world since he has no fundamentally better idea of how to do that than the patient. The consequence <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be in a relationship with God who does know how.|$|E
50|$|There are two {{competing}} requirements that determine the optimal beam size on the CCD detector. One requirement {{is that the}} entire energy — or {{as much of it}} as possible — of the laser beam is incident on the CCD sensor. This would imply that we should focus all the energy in the center of the active region in as small a spot as possible using only a few of the central pixels to ensure that the tails of the beam are captured by the outer pixels. This is one extreme. The second requirement <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> adequately sample the beam profile shape. As a general rule of thumb, we want at least 10 pixels across the area that encompasses most, say 80%, of the energy in the beam. Therefore, there is no hard and fast rule to select the optimal beam size. As long as the CCD sensor captures over 90% of the beam energy and has at least 10 pixels across it, the beam width measurements will have some accuracy.|$|E

5000|$|The {{title track}} [...] "Clear the Stage" [...] {{was written by}} Christian {{contemporary}} singer-songwriter Ross King who recorded the song in his 2002 album And All the Decorations, Too released on April 1, 2002. The main message conveyed in the song <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> clear the stage for God, who truly deserves it: [...] "Cause you can sing {{all you want to}} / But still get it wrong / Worship is more than a song / We must not worship something / that's not even worth it / Clear the stage and make some space / for the one who deserves it". It also addresses what are idols in our lives that we must cast away for true belief: [...] "Anything I put before my God is an idol / Anything I want with all my heart is an idol / Anything I can't stop thinking of is an idol / Anything that I give all my love is an idol". Jimmy Needham also released a music video displaying the lyrics of the song.|$|E
50|$|To {{verify the}} {{validity}} of the Debye-Hückel theory, many experimental ways have been tried, measuring the activity coefficients: the problem <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> go towards very high dilutions.Typical examples are: measurements of vapour pressure, freezing point, osmotic pressure (indirect methods) and measurement of electric potential in cells (direct method).Going towards high dilutions good results have been found using liquid membrane cells, it has been possible to investigate aqueous media 10−4 M and it has been found that for 1:1 electrolytes (as NaCl or KCl) the Debye-Hückel equation is totally correct, but for 2:2 or 3:2 electrolytes it is possible to find negative deviation from the Debye-Hückel limit law: this strange behavior can be observed only in the very dilute area, and in more concentrate regions the deviation becomes positive.It is possible that Debye-Hückel equation is not able to foresee this behavior because of the linearization of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation, or maybe not: studies about this have been started only during the last years of the 20th century because before it wasn’t possible to investigate the 10−4 M region, so it is possible that during the next years new theories will be born.|$|E

30|$|The {{advantage}} of this method <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> not solve the full linear system.

Furthermore, by applying the general anti-derivatives of Daubechies wavelets, this method can be used to solve the boundary value problems with Neumann and mixed boundary conditions. Numerical experiments on these problems are in progress and will be reported elsewhere further.|$|R
