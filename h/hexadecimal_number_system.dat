Computers only can understand data and instructions that are stored in binary form, though we input the data and instruction in decimal, text, audio, and video or image forms. So it is very crucial for people who are interested or working in the field of science and engineering to learn decimal to binary conversion and vice versa.

The modern society is familiar with decimal number system using ten digits. However digital devices and computers use binary number system instead of decimal, using only two digits i. e. 0 and 1 based on the fundamental concept of the decimal number system. Various other number systems also used this fundamental concept of decimal number system i. e. octal system and <b>hexadecimal</b> <b>number</b> <b>system</b> using eight and sixteen digits respectively. The awareness and concept of various number systems, their number representation, arithmetic operations, compliments and the inter conversion of numbers belongs to different number system is essential for understanding of computers.

In this paper the concepts of the four most common number systems, their representation, arithmetic, compliments and interconversion is taken under the consideration in tabulated form.

40|$|Abstract [...] Any {{system that}} is used for naming or {{representing}} numbers is a <b>number</b> <b>system,</b> also known as numeral system. The modern civilization is familiar with decimal <b>number</b> <b>system</b> using ten digits. However digital devices and computers use binary <b>number</b> <b>system</b> instead of decimal <b>number</b> <b>system,</b> using only two digits namely, 0 and 1 based on the fundamental concept of the decimal <b>number</b> <b>system.</b> Various other <b>number</b> <b>systems</b> also used this fundamental concept of decimal <b>number</b> <b>system,</b> for example octal <b>number</b> <b>system</b> and <b>hexadecimal</b> <b>number</b> <b>systems</b> using eight and sixteen digits respectively. The knowledge of <b>number</b> <b>systems</b> and their inter conversion is essential for understanding of computers.

The inter conversion (a process in which things are each converted into the other) of <b>number</b> <b>system</b> requires allot of time and techniques to expertise. In this paper the interconversion of four most common <b>number</b> <b>systems</b> is taken under the consideration in tabulated form.

40|$|The {{number is}} a symbol or a word used to {{represent}} a numeral, while a system is a functionally related group of elements, so as whole, a number is set/group of symbols to represent numbers/numerals. In other words, any system that is used for naming or representing numbers is a <b>number</b> <b>system,</b> also known as numeral system. Almost everyone is familiar with decimal <b>number</b> <b>system</b> using ten digits. However digital devices and computers use binary <b>number</b> <b>system</b> instead of decimal <b>number</b> <b>system,</b> having only two digits i. e. 0 and 1. Binary <b>number</b> <b>system</b> {{is based on the}} same fundamental concept of decimal <b>number</b> <b>system.</b> Various other <b>number</b> <b>systems</b> also use the same fundamental concept of decimal <b>number</b> <b>system,</b> e. g. octal <b>number</b> <b>system</b> (using eight digits) and <b>hexadecimal</b> <b>number</b> <b>systems</b> (using sixteen digits). The knowledge of <b>number</b> <b>systems,</b> their limitations, data formats, arithmetic, inter conversion and other related terms is essential for understanding of computers and successful programming for digital devices. Understanding all these <b>number</b> <b>systems</b> and particularly their inter conversion (such process in which things are each converted into the other) of <b>number</b> <b>system</b> requires allot of time and a large number of techniques to expertise. In this particular paper the intercom version of four well-known <b>number</b> <b>systems</b> is taken under the consideration in tabulated as well as graphical form.

40|$|Learning {{in a new}} domain {{is thought}} to be {{influenced}} by availability of appropriate activated schema that provide cognitive structures for storing new concepts and knowledge {{so that they can be}} retrieved readily. Ausubel (1960) showed that an advance organizer can perform the function of activating an appropriate schema. Mayer (1979 a) identified conditions under which an advance organizer could be expected to be effective. These conditions demand that the organizer be meaningful to the learner. ^ Although all college students are skilled in using the decimal <b>number</b> <b>system</b> for counting, few are able to transfer those skills to other <b>number</b> <b>systems.</b> The counting process can be reduced to three rules which are sufficient for counting in any <b>number</b> <b>system.</b> Presentation of these rules comprises an advance organizer except that it is not meaningful for many students. The decimal <b>number</b> <b>system</b> can be used as an analogy to make these rules meaningful. The problem studied was whether presentation of a decimal <b>number</b> <b>system</b> analogy would affect learning to count in the binary, octal and <b>hexadecimal</b> <b>number</b> <b>systems.</b> ^ A computer instruction program was written to provide the instruction. The subjects completed the instruction on their own as a class project over a 7 -week period. Treatment subjects received the analogy prior to presentation of the advance organizer; control subjects received the analogy immediately prior to the posttest. ^ No significant differences were found between the treatment and the control groups in posttest achievement, total time for completing the instruction, or attitude toward computer instruction. Significant differences were found in the numbers of practice exercises completed, in the time needed for each exercise, and in the time used to complete the treatment module. ^ A conclusion was that the presentation of the analogy had a positive influence on learning. The low statistical significance between the group achievement means was inferred to be due mainly to individual skills for finding the cognitive structures needed for effective learning. ...|$|R
