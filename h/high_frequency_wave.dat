5000|$|The {{spectral}} method expands the solution in trigonometric series, a chief advantage {{being that the}} resulting method is of very high order. This approach relies {{on the fact that}} trigonometric polynomials are an orthonormal basis for [...] The spectral element method chooses instead a high degree piecewise polynomial basis functions, also achieving a very high order of accuracy. Such polynomials are usually orthogonal Chebyshev polynomials or very high order Legendre polynomials over non-uniformly spaced nodes. In SEM computational error decreases exponentially as the order of approximating polynomial, therefore a fast convergence of solution to the exact solution is realized with fewer degrees of freedom of the structure in comparison with FEM.In structural health monitoring, FEM can be used for detecting large flaws in a structure, but as the size of the flaw is reduced {{there is a need to}} use a <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>wave</b> with a small wavelength. Therefore, the FEM mesh must be much finer, resulting in increased computational time and an inexact solution. SEM, with fewer degrees of freedom per node, can be useful for detecting small flaws. Non-uniformity of nodes helps to make the mass matrix diagonal, which saves time and memory and is also useful for adopting a central difference method (CDM). The disadvantages of SEM include difficulty in modeling complex geometry, compared to the flexibility of FEM.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this work}} {{is to develop a}} new {{universal}} high order subroutine for shock boundary layer interaction. First, an effective shock/discontinuity detector has been developed. The detector has two steps. The first step is to check the ratio of the truncation errors on the coarse and fine grids and the second step is to check the local ratio of the left and right slopes. The currently popular shock/discontinuity detectors can detect shock, but mistake <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>waves</b> and critical points as shock and then damp the physically important <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>waves.</b> Preliminary results show the new shock/discontinuity detector is very delicate and can detect all shocks including strong, weak and oblique shocks or discontinuity in function and the first, second, and third order derivatives without artificial constants, but never mistake <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>waves</b> and critical points, expansion waves as shock. This will overcome the bottle neck problem with numerical simulation for the shock-boundary layer interaction, shock-acoustic interaction, image process, porous media flow, multiple phase flow and anywhere the <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>waves</b> are important, but discontinuity exists and is mixed with <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>waves.</b> After detecting the shock we can then use one side high order scheme for shocks and high order central compact scheme for the rest if the shock is appropriately located.

40|$|International audienceThis study {{demonstrates}} {{the feasibility of}} the dynamic acousto-elastic effect of a continuous <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>wave</b> for investigating the material nonlinearity upon transient vibration. The approach is demonstrated on a concrete sample measuring 15 × 15 × 60 cm 3. Two ultrasonic transducers (emitter and receiver) are placed at its middle span. A continuous <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>wave</b> of 500 kHz propagates through the material and is modulated with a hammer blow. The position of the hammer blow on the sample is configured to promote the first bending mode of vibration. The use of a continuous wave allows discrete time extraction of the nonlinear behavior by a short-time Fourier transform approach, through the simultaneous comparison of a reference non-modulated signal and an impact-modulated signal. The hammer blow results in phase shifts and variations of signal amplitude between reference and perturbed signals, which are driven by the resonant frequency of the sample.

40|$|This work {{is devoted}} to the {{asymptotic}} analysis of <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>wave</b> propagation in random media with long-range dependence. We are interested in two asymptotic regimes, that we investigate simultaneously: the paraxial approximation, where the wave is collimated and propagates along a privileged direction of propagation, and the white-noise limit, where random fluctuations in the background are well approximated in a statistical sense by a fractional white noise. The fractional nature of the fluctuations is reminiscent of the long-range correlations in the underlying random medium. A typical physical setting is laser beam propagation in turbulent atmosphere. Starting from the <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>wave</b> equation with fast non-Gaussian random oscillations in the velocity field, we derive the fractional Itô-Schrödinger equation, that is a Schrödinger equation with potential equal to a fractional white noise. The proof involves a fine analysis of the backscattering and of the coupling between the propagating and evanescent modes. Because of the long-range dependence, classical diffusion-approximation theorems for equations with random coefficients do not apply, and we therefore use moment techniques to study the convergence.
