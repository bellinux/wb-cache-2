5|$|As the {{persecution}} worsened, thousands of Quakers left North Carolina for the Old Northwest, where slavery was prohibited and land was less expensive. (A large Quaker community {{that had already}} settled in what became Ohio and <b>Indiana</b> had been influential in securing a territorial ban on slavery.) In 1822 Coffin accompanied Benjamin White to <b>Indiana</b> and stayed in <b>Indiana</b> with the Whites for about a year. On his return to North Carolina, Coffin brought back reports of <b>Indiana</b> and its prosperity.

5|$|Between March 23 and March 27, 1913, <b>Indiana</b> {{and more}} than a dozen other states {{experienced}} major flooding during the Great Flood of 1913; it was Indiana's worst flood disaster up to that time. The weather system that created the unprecedented flooding arrived in <b>Indiana</b> on Sunday, March 23, with a major tornado at Terre Haute. In four days, rainfall topped nine inches in southern <b>Indiana,</b> more than half of it falling within a twenty-four-hour period on March 25. Heavy rains, runoff, and rising rivers resulted in extensive flooding in northeast, central, and southern <b>Indiana.</b> Indiana's flood-related deaths were estimated at 100 to 200, with flood damage estimated at $25 million (in 1913 dollars). State and local communities handled their own disaster response and relief. The American Red Cross, still a small organization at that time, established a temporary headquarters in Indianapolis and served the six hardest-hit <b>Indiana</b> counties. <b>Indiana</b> governor Samuel M. Ralston appealed to <b>Indiana</b> cities and other states for relief assistance and appointed a trustee to receive relief funds and arrange for distribution of supplies. Independent organizations, such as the Rotary Club of Indianapolis and others, helped with local relief efforts.|$|E

Coffin's accumulated wealth from his business interests allowed {{him to become a}} major investor in the Richmond, <b>Indiana,</b> branch of the Second State Bank of <b>Indiana,</b> where he served as director in the 1830s. Coffin's financial position and standing in the community also provided the mead to supply food, clothing, and transportation for the Underground Railroad operations in the region.|$|E

5|$|Democrats won a {{majority}} in the <b>Indiana</b> House of Representatives in the 2006 and 2008 elections. This caused <b>Indiana</b> to have a divided government, with Democrats controlling the <b>Indiana</b> House of Representatives and the Republicans controlling the governor's office and the <b>Indiana</b> Senate. This also lead to a stalemate in the budget debate, which caused Mitch Daniels call a special session of the <b>Indiana</b> General Assembly. The state was faced with a $1 billion shortfall in revenue for the 2009–11 budget years. Daniels proposed a range of spending cuts and cost-saving measures in his budget proposal. The General Assembly approved some of his proposals, but relied heavily on the state's reserve funds to pay for the budget shortfall. Daniels signed the $27 billion two-year budget into law.|$|E

Taylor became a successful lawyer in <b>Indiana,</b> and was pardoned in 1909 by Beckham's successor, Republican Augustus E. Willson.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the end of}} {{the last}} glacial period, Indiana's {{topography}} was dominated by spruce and pine forests and was home to mastodon, caribou, and saber-toothed cats. While Northern <b>Indiana</b> had been covered by glaciers, Southern <b>Indiana</b> remained unaltered by the ice's advance, leaving plants and animals that could sustain human communities. Indiana's earliest known inhabitants were Paleo-Indians. Evidence exists that humans were in <b>Indiana</b> as early as the Archaic stage (8000–6000 BC). Hunting camps of the nomadic Clovis culture have been found in <b>Indiana.</b> Carbon dating of artifacts found in the Wyandotte Caves of Southern <b>Indiana</b> shows humans mined flint there as early 2000 BC. These nomads ate quantities of freshwater mussels from local streams, as shown by their shell mounds found throughout southern <b>Indiana.</b>|$|E
