However, one substantial value of the <b>guaranteed</b> <b>annuity</b> rates was to create a floor pension (the guaranteed fund multiplied by the <b>guaranteed</b> <b>annuity</b> rate) for the GARs which those policies without GARs (non-GARs) did not have.

40|$|Variable <b>Annuities</b> with {{embedded}} <b>guarantees</b> {{are very}} popular in the US market. There exists {{a great variety of}} products with both, guaranteed minimum death benefits (GMDB) and guaranteed minimum living benefits (GMLB). Although several approaches for pricing some of the corresponding guarantees have been proposed in the academic literature, there is no general framework in which the existing variety of such guarantees can be priced consistently. The present paper fills this gap by introducing a model, which permits a consistent and extensive analysis of all types of guarantees currently offered within Variable Annuity contracts. Besides a valuation assuming that the policyholder follows a given strategy with respect to surrender and withdrawals, we are able to price the contract under optimal policyholder behavior. Using both, Monte-Carlo methods and a generalization of a finite mesh discretization approach, we find that some guarantees are overpriced, whereas others, e. g. <b>guaranteed</b> <b>annuities</b> within <b>guaranteed</b> minimum income benefits (GMIB), are offered significantly below their risk-neutral value...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: State-sponsored private {{pension schemes}} {{generally}} provide retirees with a lump sum, but {{do nothing to}} assist them with its conversion to an income stream. An optimal way to affect this conversion is to purchase a <b>guaranteed</b> term-certain <b>annuity</b> with part of the sum, while investing the remainder in a national bourse index fund. At present annuities must be purchased from commercial providers. If Government were to issue part of its public debt {{in the form of}} annuity bonds, retirees could purchase riskless annuities at lower cost, with government being involved in the pension scheme throughout all phase...|$|R
5000|$|Because {{immediate}} annuities generally {{provide a}} series of <b>guaranteed</b> payments, the <b>annuity</b> company normally matches its liabilities with government bonds and other high grade bonds, and the market yield available on these bonds largely determines the retail pricing of the annuities.

Nevertheless, I feel bound individually to do my duty the same as if it had never been done before, and to ask whether there is any just cause or impediment why these two parties--the institution and the public--should not be joined together in holy charity. As I understand the society, its objects are five-fold--first, to <b>guarantee</b> <b>annuities</b> which, it is always to be observed, is paid out of the interest of invested capital, so that those annuities may be secure and safe--annual pensions, varying from 10 to 25 pounds, to distressed railway officers and servants incapacitated by age, sickness, or accident; secondly, to guarantee small pensions to distressed widows; thirdly, to educate and maintain orphan children; fourthly, to provide temporary relief for all those classes till lasting relief can be guaranteed out of funds sufficiently large for the purpose; lastly, to induce railway officers and servants to assure their lives in some well- established office by sub-dividing the payment of the premiums into small periodical sums, and also by granting a reversionary bonus of 10 pounds per cent. on the amount assured from the funds of the institution.|$|R

Later, in 1952, CREF {{was created to}} allow professors to invest in the stock market through the nation's first variable annuity. Its core business continues to be retirement plan administration and annuity products. It is by far the largest manager of employer-sponsored 403(b) tax-sheltered annuity plans, a defined contribution retirement plan for employees of 501(c)(3) educational, religious, and charitable organizations. The company also offers 401(k) and 457 plans, Keogh plans, and Supplemental Retirement Plans.

5000|$|A pure {{life annuity}} ceases to make {{payments}} {{on the death of}} the annuitant. A <b>guaranteed</b> <b>annuity</b> or life and certain annuity, makes payments for at least a certain number of years (the [...] "period certain"); if the annuitant outlives the specified period certain, annuity payments then continue until the annuitant's death, and if the annuitant dies before the expiration of the period certain, the annuitant's estate or beneficiary is entitled to collect the remaining payments certain. The tradeoff between the pure life annuity and the life-with-period-certain annuity is that in exchange for the reduced risk of loss, the annuity payments for the latter will be smaller.|$|E
50|$|Many of Equitable's with-profits {{policies}} {{were designed to}} provide a pension for the policyholder on retirement, and the lump sum available to buy an annuity depended on the sum assured, the reversionary bonuses and the larger terminal bonus. Both types of bonus were allocated at the discretion of the directors in accordance with Article 65 of the Articles of Association, the total being intended to reflect the investment return earned over the lifetime of the policy, subject to smoothing.Between 1956 and the advent of Personal Pension Schemes in July 1988, Equitable sold policies with an option to choose at the retirement date between a fixed <b>Guaranteed</b> <b>Annuity</b> Rate (GAR) or the Current Annuity Rate (i.e. the market annuity rate at that time) (CAR).

The Equitable's Annual Regulatory Returns, submitted each year to the regulatory authorities (the Department of Trade and Industry - DTI) had set out this practice since the 1993 (when the current annuity rate first fell below the <b>guaranteed</b> <b>annuity</b> rate).

40|$|The {{variable}} annuity market in Japan is still young, but growing rapidly. Most variable annuities in Japan are sold {{with one or}} more investment guarantees, such as a Guaranteed Minimum Maturity Benefit (GMMB), which guarantees that the ultimate annuity principal will not fall below a pre-set level regardless of the underlying investment performance. Of interest to financial institutions selling variable annuities is the cost associated with such a guarantee. Although the Black-Scholes option pricing formula can be applied readily, the resulting price might be inaccurate because returns on the Japanese stock price index do not seem to behave as assumed in the formula. In this study, we propose a method for valuing investment guarantees {{on the basis of a}} GARCH-type model, which better captures the characteristics of the stock price index. A difficulty in option-pricing with GARCH is the identification of a risk-neutral probability measure. We solve this problem by considering the conditional Esscher transform.

40|$|In this paper, we {{evaluate}} a common annuity instrument {{present in the}} brazilian market, and maybe also in others high inflation markets: the participating <b>guaranteed</b> inflation <b>annuity.</b> Besides the monthly income, this sort of annuity pays the policyholder {{from time to time}} (for example: every 5 years) the positive difference between the reserve accrued by a specified fixed income fund return plus the portfolio observed “mortality return”, and the reserve evaluated using a fixed interest rate plus a predetermined “mortality return ” based on an annuity table. The monthly income grows according to the inflation rate. The actuarial factor used to calculate the initial income is based on the predetermined table and the fixed interest rate. The model makes use of multi-factor CIR and Vasicek frameworks for the term structures of interest and inflation rates, respectively. For the mortality rate modelling, we used the Lee-Carter approach estimated with brazilian population data. All experiments were carried out with Monte Carlo simulation with descriptive sampling.
