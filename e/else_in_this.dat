500|$|... "Immortality" [...] {{generally}} received positive {{reviews from}} television critics. Noel Murray of The A.V. Club graded the episode an A-, explaining that [...] "after last week’s semi-misfire, it was reassuring to see Fringe back in good form this week, with a creepy case, a great villain, and a pertinent plot twist". Andrew Hanson from the Los Angeles Times enjoyed the [...] "fun" [...] {{scenes in the}} parallel universe, and stated he would not mind watching an entire show about their Fringe Division. IGN's Ramsey Isler called the victims' method of death in [...] "Immortality" [...] "one of the nastiest in recent memory," [...] and rated the episode 8.5/10. He concluded that he was [...] "quite surprised by this episode. The storyline with the Dr. Silva [...] and his beetles didn't hold my interest at all, but everything <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> installment was fascinating material that expanded the mythos of the series far more than I could have imagined." [...] Den of Geek's Billy Grifter wrote, [...] "What this show is now quite good at is lulling us into {{a false sense of}} security, before pulling away the rug rather smartly. If you follow the show, like me, you probably got a slightly déjà vu feeling to the plot, as it rode the previously saddle worn concept of a scientist who has lost the perspective to realise that he's killing people for science." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "For {{many years}} {{physical}} anthropologists {{have found it}} more amusing to travel to distant lands and to measure small remnants of little known or romantic peoples than to tackle the drudgery of a systematic study of their own compatriots. For that reason, sections in the present book that deal with the Lapps, the Arabs, the Berbers, the Tajiks, and the Ionians may appear more fully and more lucidly treated than those that deal with the French, the Hungarians, the Czechs, or the English. What is needed more than anything <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> respect is a thoroughgoing study of {{the inhabitants of the}} principal and most powerful nations of Europe." ...|$|E

Obama said, [...] "Muslims have the same right to practice their religion as anyone <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> country. And that includes the right to build a place of worship and a community center on private property in lower Manhattan, in accordance with local laws and ordinances." [...] Obama clarified the next day that he was only speaking of legal rights and [...] "was not commenting... on the wisdom of making the decision to put a mosque there".|$|E
2500|$|Following 1976, Wynette's {{popularity}} slightly slowed, however, {{she continued}} to reach the Top 10 {{until the end of}} the decade, with such hits as [...] "Let's Get Together (One Last Time), [...] "One of a Kind" [...] (both 1977), [...] "Womanhood" [...] (1978) [...] "No One <b>Else</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> World" [...] and [...] "They Call It Makin' Love" [...] (both 1979). [...] She had a total of 20 number one hits on the U.S. country singles charts (16 solo, three with Jones, and one with Houston). [...] Along with Loretta Lynn, Dolly Parton, Barbara Mandrell, Dottie West, and Lynn Anderson, she helped redefine the role and place of female country singers.|$|E

2500|$|Lee {{starred in}} John Stagliano's enema-focused film Milk Nymphos, which in 2008 became {{the subject of}} a federal grand jury {{obscenity}} trial. The case reached federal court in Washington, D.C., and, on July 16, 2010, Lee was expected to testify as a witness on behalf of the defense. Citing concerns of personal safety, Lee requested to testify under her stage name; the prosecution objected, arguing that allowing her to do so [...] "gives some air of legitimacy to the porn star" [...] (which Lee later called [...] "incredibly insulting") and that [...] "she shouldn't be treated any differently than anyone <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> case". The case was ultimately dismissed on July 16, 2010, before Lee was scheduled to testify.|$|E
2500|$|Wild Turkey {{is known}} for being a {{favorite}} drink of journalist Hunter S. Thompson, and is mentioned in his 1972 book Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (as well as the film of the same name), and the 1973 book Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72. In Stephen King's book It, when asked what the bar whiskey is, the bartender replies, [...] "For everyone <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> dump it's Four Roses, but for you I think it's Wild Turkey." [...] David Foster Wallace's novel Infinite Jest has James Incandenza as an alcoholic filmmaker and tennis academy head who drinks Wild Turkey, {{as well as being}} referenced as Wallace's drink of choice in his biography, Every Love Story is a Ghost Story. In Scott Sigler's science fiction book Infected, main character Perry Dawsey is described several times as drinking Wild Turkey. In Patrick Neate's 2004 book City of Tiny Lights the private investigator anti-hero and narrator of the tale, Tommy Akhtar, subsists on a diet of mostly Wild Turkey and Benson and Hedges cigarettes, referring to them as [...] "Benny and the Turk". In Adrian Edmondson's 1995 novel The Gobbler, the hard-drinking central protagonist, Julian Mann, has a penchant for Wild Turkey, particularly in combination with pints of lager.|$|E

5000|$|Originally, Vs. {{was titled}} Five Against One, which {{was taken from}} the lyric [...] "One, two, three, four, five against one..." [...] from [...] "Animal". Concerning the {{original}} album title, Gossard said:"For me, that title represented a lot of struggles that you go through trying to make a record...Your own independence—your own soul—versus everybody <b>else's.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> band, and I think in rock in general the art of compromise is almost as important as the art of individual expression. You might have five great artists in the band, but if they can't compromise and work together, you don't have a great band. It might mean something completely different to Eddie. But when I heard that lyric, it made a lot of sense to me." ...|$|R
