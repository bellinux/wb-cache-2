25|$|The {{performance}} {{increase of}} the 80286 over the 8086 (or 8088) could be more than 100% per clock cycle in many programs (i.e. a doubled performance at the same clock speed). This was a large increase, fully comparable to the speed improvements around a decade later when the i486 (1989) or the original Pentium (1993) were introduced. This was {{partly due to the}} non-multiplexed address and data buses, but mainly to the fact that address calculations (such as base+index) were less expensive. They were performed by a dedicated unit in the 80286, while the older 8086 had to do <b>effective</b> <b>address</b> computation using its general ALU, consuming several extra clock cycles in many cases. Also, the 80286 was more efficient in the prefetch of instructions, buffering, execution of jumps, and in complex microcoded numerical operations such as MUL/DIV than its predecessor.|$|E

50|$|The {{instruction}} set is very symmetrical. Every instruction {{consists of a}} 9-bit opcode, a 4-bit register code, and a 23-bit <b>effective</b> <b>address</b> field, which consists in turn of a 1-bit indirect bit, a 4-bit register code, and an 18-bit offset. Instruction execution begins by calculating the <b>effective</b> <b>address.</b> It adds {{the contents of the}} given register (if non-zero) to the offset; then, if the indirect bit is 1, fetches the word at the calculated address and repeats the <b>effective</b> <b>address</b> calculation until an <b>effective</b> <b>address</b> with a zero indirect bit is reached. The resulting <b>effective</b> <b>address</b> can be used by the instruction either to fetch memory contents, or simply as a constant. Thus, for example, MOVEI A,3(C) adds 3 to the 18 lower bits of register C and puts the result in register A, without touching memory.|$|E
40|$|Abstract⎯The {{amount of}} {{information}} recorded in the prediction tables of the proposed address predictors {{turns out to be}} comparable to the current on-chip cache sizes; for instance, a last-address predictor that records 4. 096 64 -bit <b>effective</b> <b>addresses</b> uses a 32 Kbytes storage space. Area cost of address predictors is proportional to address width. To reduce their area cost, we will take advantage of the spatial-locality property of the memory references, that is, the high-order bits of several <b>effective</b> <b>addresses</b> recorded in the prediction table are equal. Then, the <b>effective</b> <b>addresses</b> are split in two parts: the high-order bits and the low-order bits. The High-Address Table records the high-order bits and the Low-Address Table records the low-order bits and a link between tables. This organization allows addresses with the same high-order bits to share one entry in the High-Address Table. We use this organization in a last-address predictor and our evaluations show that it produces significant area-cost reductions (28 %- 60 %) without performance losses.
