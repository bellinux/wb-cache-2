5000|$|TSO {{eliminated}} {{the need to}} punch cards on a <b>keypunch</b> <b>machine,</b> and send [...] card decks to the computer room to be read by a [...] card reading machine.|$|R
50|$|Mark sensing {{allowed a}} person to enter data {{to be used in}} punched-card data {{processing}} without using a <b>keypunch</b> <b>machine.</b> It was used for tasks like recording long distance calls or meter readings.|$|R
5000|$|... 1910 Under the {{management}} of E. E. Cammack, Aetna began using Hollerith punched cards machines for tabulating and hired 35 women to input mortality statistics on <b>keypunch</b> <b>machines,</b> the company's first female home office clerks.|$|R
5000|$|The 129 could store six {{programs}} in its memory, selectable by a rotary switch. Unlike earlier <b>keypunch</b> <b>machines,</b> the program cards were read into memory via the regular card-feed path, {{and were not}} wrapped around a [...] "program drum".|$|R
50|$|Data {{processing}} technicians operated {{data processing}} equipment including <b>keypunch</b> <b>machines,</b> sorters, collators, reproducers, tabulating printers, and computers; performed the administrative tasks for operating computer facility, including the handling of all classified material passing into or out of a computer system; designed, developed, tested, and maintained computer software.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1880s, the American Herman Hollerith invented data storage on punched cards that {{could then be}} read by a machine. To process these punched cards he invented the tabulator, and the <b>keypunch</b> <b>machine.</b> His {{machines}} used electromechanical relays and counters. [...] Hollerith's method {{was used in the}} 1890 United States Census. [...] That census was processed two years faster than the prior census had been. Hollerith's company eventually became the core of IBM.|$|R
50|$|Some early <b>keypunch</b> <b>machines</b> used a {{keyboard}} with 12 labeled keys to punch the correct holes in paper cards. The numbers 0 through 9 were represented by one punch; 26 letters were represented by combinations of two punches, and symbols were represented by combinations {{of two or}} three punches.|$|R

The {{woman at the}} right is seated at an IBM 026 <b>keypunch</b> <b>machine.</b> The woman at left is at an IBM 056 Card Verifier. She would re-enter the data and the '056 verifier machine would check that it matched the data punched onto the cards.|$|R
5000|$|Ironically, not all {{verifier}} operators {{appreciated the}} noise reduction. When {{used in a}} room also containing 029 <b>keypunch</b> <b>machines,</b> the verifier operators sometimes missed the auditory feedback provided by the loud [...] "thunk" [...] noise emitted by the older 056. Some were known to compensate by hitting the keys harder, sometimes actually wearing out keyboard parts.|$|R

The school had a <b>keypunch</b> <b>machine</b> and students ran their programs at the Watson lab at Columbia University. Science obtained its own computer, an IBM 1620, a year and a half later.|$|R
5000|$|Inforex Inc. {{corporation}} manufactured {{and sold}} key-to-disk {{systems in the}} 1970s and mid-1980s. The company was founded by ex-IBM engineers to develop direct data entry systems that allowed information to be entered on terminals and stored directly on disk drives, replacing punched cards and <b>keypunch</b> <b>machines</b> which had been the dominant tools for data entry {{since the turn of}} the twentieth century.|$|R
50|$|Around 1970, Digital Equipment Corporation donated {{two small}} rackmount PDP-11 minicomputers. One was {{eventually}} used {{to operate the}} club's major freight yard {{and the other was}} set up to perform user interface tasks, such as initial assignment of trains to throttles, and to throw turnouts. The computer replaced the keypad unit from an old <b>keypunch</b> <b>machine</b> which had been originally installed by Richard Greenblatt.|$|R

Her job would be to re-enter the data and the verifier machine would check that it matched the data punched onto the cards.|$|R
50|$|The {{invention}} of punch card data processing in the 1890s created {{a demand for}} many workers, typically women, to run <b>keypunch</b> <b>machines.</b> It was common practice to ensure accuracy by entering data twice, the second time on a verifier, a separate, keyboard-equipped machine, such as the IBM 056. In the 1970s, punch card data entry was gradually replaced {{by the use of}} video display terminals.|$|R
5000|$|Punched {{cards were}} widely used {{through much of}} the 20th century in {{what became known as the}} data {{processing}} industry, where specialized and increasingly complex unit record machines, organized into semiautomatic data processing systems, used punched cards for data input, output, and storage. [...] Many early digital computers used punched cards, often prepared using <b>keypunch</b> <b>machines,</b> as the primary medium for input of both computer programs and data.|$|R
5000|$|IBM was {{the largest}} {{supplier}} of unit record equipment (punched cards, <b>keypunches,</b> accounting <b>machines,</b> ...) {{in the first part}} of the 20th century.|$|R
50|$|Punched cards {{had been}} in use since the 1890s; their {{technology}} was mature and reliable. Card readers and punches developed for punched card machines were readily adaptable for computer use. Businesses were familiar with storing data on punched cards and <b>keypunch</b> <b>machines</b> were widely employed. Punched cards were a better fit than other 1950s technologies, such as magnetic tape, for some computer applications as individual cards could easily be updated without having to access a computer.|$|R
5000|$|Before text editors existed, {{computer}} {{text was}} punched into cards with <b>keypunch</b> <b>machines.</b> Physical boxes of these thin cardboard cards were then inserted into a card-reader. Magnetic tape and disk [...] "card-image" [...] files created from such card decks often had no line-separation characters at all, and assumed fixed-length 80-character records. An alternative to cards was punched paper tape. It could {{be created by}} some teleprinters (such as the Teletype), which used special characters to indicate ends of records.|$|R
50|$|The first {{attempts}} by NDRE {{to build a}} computer {{were made by the}} mathematics division in the early 1950s. There were two main intended uses: calculation of orbital mechanics for ballistic missiles and for the dimensions for Kjeller Reactor. The background was that NDRE had a <b>keypunch</b> <b>machine,</b> but there were no commercially available digital computers. In 1953 NDRE was offered a digital Ferranti computer via the Norwegian Intelligence Service and the agency thus terminated its own computer development and instead focused on software.|$|R

50|$|Batch data {{processing}} {{took advantage of}} the economies of scale in sorting and processing sequential data storage media, such as punch cards and, later, magnetic tape. Typically transactions for a recording period, such as a day or a week, would be entered onto cards from paper forms using a <b>keypunch</b> <b>machine.</b> At the close of the period, the data would be sorted using a card sorting machine, or, later a computer. The sorted data would then be used to update a master file, such as an accounting ledger or inventory file, that was kept sorted by the same key. Only one pass through the sequential files would be needed for the updates. Reports and other outputs, such as bills and payment checks, would then be generated from the master file.|$|R

50|$|In foot orienteering, {{the oldest}} form of orienteering, the first <b>control</b> <b>cards</b> were card stock with a {{perforated}} stub, the stub {{to be handed}} in at the Start as a safety check. At each control, originally, the control staff or the competitor rubber stamped the <b>control</b> <b>card</b> using a rubber stamp and inkpad kept at that control. Rubber stamps soon were replaced with ticket punches, usually with a different punch shape (circular, square, diamond, star, etc.) at each <b>control.</b> <b>Card</b> stock <b>control</b> <b>cards</b> are in limited use today, having been mostly replaced by weatherproof stock such as Tyvek. Ticket punches {{have been replaced by}} needle punches that punch a pattern of small holes in the <b>control</b> <b>card</b> (similar to a perfin).|$|R
