5|$|According to Simon Goldhill, the {{evidence}} is fundamentally inconclusive. Goldhill writes that the theatre {{can be seen as}} a social and political event analogous with the Assembly and the courtroom, and women may have been excluded. David Kawalko Roselli writes that although Goldhill's perspective is valuable, he does not sufficiently consider the theatre's ritual purpose. If women did attend the theatre, they may <b>have</b> <b>sat</b> separately from the men.|$|E
5|$|The {{committee}} has had 54 different members. Thirteen {{people have been}} chair and six deputy chair. Ten women <b>have</b> <b>sat</b> on the committee, starting with Aase Lionæs in 1949. From 2009, four of the board's five members are women. Christian Lous Lange {{is the only person}} to have both sat on the committee and been its secretary, and the only peace laureate to <b>have</b> <b>sat</b> on the committee. Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson was, however, awarded the Nobel Literature Prize. The longest-serving members are Hans Jacob Horst and Aase Lionæs, who both served for 30 years. The longest-sitting chair is Gunnar Jahn, who sat for 26 years as chair and 29 years on the committee. The longest period without any changes to the committee was the 15 years from 1949 to 1963. The shortest-sitting member was Esther Kostøl, who sat for less than a year in 1997.|$|E
5|$|Historically, the committee's {{members have}} {{represented}} seven political parties, including the Liberal Party, the Centre Party and the Christian Democratic Party. The awards in 1935 (to Carl von Ossietzky), 1973 (to Henry Kissinger) and 1994 (to Yasser Arafat) caused {{members of the}} committee to withdraw due to disagreement with the committee decision. Six people <b>have</b> <b>sat</b> as the committee's secretary, who is also director of the Norwegian Nobel Institute. Since 1990, this has been Geir Lundestad, {{professor of history at the}} University of Oslo.|$|E

5|$|This {{structure}} {{was built in}} the mid-15th century. At the southern end is a shallow raised dais on which the Lytes and favoured guests would <b>have</b> <b>sat</b> at a long table, facing the rest of the hall where the servants would have dined. The roof has arch-braced-collar trusses, with double purlins, and cusped curved windbraces. Typical of West Country design, these carved windbraces are both decorative and practical. Beneath is a cornice of pierced quatrefoils, and at the base of each main rafter is a carved wooden angel with a shield with the Lyte arms. The fireplace is 15th century, while the windows and the stained glass in them date from the early 16th century. The hall is entered from the east front porch via the screens passage, which would have divided the Hall from the kitchen and servants quarters' which would have lain {{to the left of the}} hall. The screen and gallery are not original, having been inserted by Sir Walter Jenner in 1907. He based the decoration on that of the arch from the Great Hall through to the Oriel Room. At the time of Jenner's arrival in 1907 the Great Hall was being used as a cider store.|$|E

25|$|Earls {{appear to}} <b>have</b> <b>sat</b> in Parliament {{by virtue of}} their baronies, and not their earldoms. The {{separation}} of the two dignities seems to have arisen after the advent of the usage of letters patent to create peerage dignities. In some cases, a baron who held a dignity created by a writ of summons was created an Earl, and the two dignities later separated, the barony devolving upon the heir-general, and the earldom to an heir-male.|$|E
25|$|Ibn Wahshiyya and Abu Nu'ayn tell {{a second}} {{story in which}} a Meccan {{merchant}} visiting Syria is invited to a Christian monastery where a number of sculptures and paintings depict prophets and saints.

In an 11th-century story, Muhammad is said so <b>have</b> <b>sat</b> for a portrait by an artist retained by Sassanid king Kavadh II.

Later, at the summit's official dinner hosted by President Giorgio Napolitano, US and Libyan leaders upset protocol by sitting next to Italian Prime Minister and G8 host Berlusconi. (According to protocol, Gaddafi should <b>have</b> <b>sat</b> three places away from Berlusconi).|$|E

Band members have enjoyed other artists' shows and the ship's amenities freely with the other guests. Barenaked Ladies have performed several full shows on each cruise, and the band members also commonly <b>have</b> <b>sat</b> in with other artists at their shows.|$|E
25|$|Cramer polled 772,817 votes (46.1 percent), gaining {{crossover}} {{votes of}} 61,716 more ballots {{than the number}} of registered Republicans in Florida. Chiles' 902,438 tabulation (53.9 percent) was less than half of registered Democrats, but he gained majorities in 55 counties, compared to 13 counties tilting to Cramer. Most of the Democratic electorate sat out what political analysts thought {{was one of the most}} contested Senate general elections in Florida history. Robert Sikes speculated that some primary supporters of Farris Bryant may have defected to Cramer, and a number of Republicans may <b>have</b> <b>sat</b> out the election, too.|$|E
25|$|A team of Walt Disney Imagineers led by Marty Sklar and Randy Bright {{had been}} given an {{assignment}} to create two new pavilions for Epcot's Future World section. The brainstorming sessions led to Wonders of Life and Great Movie Ride pavilions. The latter was {{to look like a}} soundstage backdrop, with a movie theater-style entrance in the middle and would <b>have</b> <b>sat</b> between the Land and Journey Into Imagination pavilions. When newly appointed CEO Michael Eisner saw the plans for the pavilion, he requested that, instead of placing the ride in an already existing park, it should be the anchor for a new park themed with Hollywood, entertainment, and show business.|$|E

25|$|Maria is {{described}} as a success in her social role as Empress, loved to dance at the balls of high society and became a popular socialite and hostess of the Imperial balls; her daughter Olga commented, “Court life had to run in splendor, and there my mother played her part without a single false step.”, and a contemporary remarked on her success: “of the long gallery of Tsarinas who <b>have</b> <b>sat</b> in state in the Kremlin or paced in the Winter Palace, Marie Feodorovna was perhaps the most brilliant”. She longed for the balls and gatherings in the Winter Palace. These also occurred at Gatchina. Alexander used to enjoy joining in with the musicians, although he would end up sending them off one by one. When that happened, Maria knew the party was over.|$|E
25|$|The {{staircase}} {{is followed}} by the Norman Porch, a square landing distinguished by its central clustered column and the intricate ceiling it supports, which is made up of four groin vaults with lierne ribs and carved bosses. The Porch was named for its proposed decorative scheme, based on Norman history. In the event, neither the planned statues of Norman kings nor the frescoes were executed, and only the stained-glass window portraying Edward the Confessor hints at this theme. Queen Victoria is depicted twice in the room: as a young woman in the other stained-glass window, and near the end of her life, sitting on the throne of the House of Lords, in a copy of a 1900 painting by Jean-Joseph Benjamin-Constant which hangs on the eastern wall. The sixteen plinths intended for the statues now house busts of prime ministers who <b>have</b> <b>sat</b> in the House of Lords, such as the Earl Grey and the Marquess of Salisbury. A double door opposite the stairs leads to the Royal Gallery, and another to the right opens to the Robing Room.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} 19thcentury, the Tinker family lived at Shepley Carr. Ebenezer Tinker was {{responsible}} for building Tinker's Monument near Hill Top above New Mill. Deeds held at the West Yorkshire Archive Centre in Wakefield suggest that the original house at Shepley Carr dates from the 16thcentury and was owned by the Armytage Family of Kirklees Hall. The house was owned by the Bentley family from 1947 until 2002 after Harry Lawton Bentley, a local textile manufacturer, bought the hamlet by auction. Family members {{still live in the}} hamlet. Shepley Carr is now owned and occupied by the Wimpenny family, who own the historic Huddersfield building firm of the same name. Locals believe that Oliver Cromwell marched his army through Shepley Carr during the English Civil War 1642–1649. Roundheads, as the soldiers were known, were probably in Kirkburton, and at Catlin or Catling (now Cat Hill) Hall near Penistone, the latter having a holding post in the cellars upon which royalist prisoners were chained. Inside the parish church at Upper Cumberworth, there is a chair that Oliver Cromwell is reputed to <b>have</b> <b>sat</b> in.|$|E
