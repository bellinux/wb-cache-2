Only Moses (Milhouse) can liberate the Hebrews. When Bart defaces the Pharaoh's sarcophagus, supposedly incited by the burning bush, he gets the other students punished. Lisa helps Milhouse produce plagues to scare the Pharaoh into freeing the Israelites; they fail. This in turn gets Lisa and Milhouse thrown in a Pyramid prison. When they escape, Milhouse gathers all the students and they attempt to leave. When they reach the sea, Lisa has an idea to get across: They simultaneously flush all the Egyptians' toilets to drain the sea. As they cross, the Pharaoh and his guards follow, but the water fills the sea back up and swallows them. They enjoy splashing each other, and then return to the shore. Pleased that they have escaped, Milhouse asks Lisa what the future holds for the Israelites, but Lisa disappoints Milhouse when she says that they have to wander the desert for forty years. Milhouse then asks if <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> smooth sailing for the Jews after that. Rather than disappoint Milhouse again with news of the ongoing anti-Semitism that will plague the Jews for many centuries, she distracts the crowd by sending them to search for manna.|$|E

500|$|Pei's {{style is}} {{described}} as thoroughly modernist, with significant cubist themes. He is known for combining traditional architectural elements with progressive designs based on simple geometric patterns. As one critic writes: [...] "Pei has been aptly described as combining a classical sense of form with a contemporary mastery of method." [...] In 2000, biographer Carter Wiseman called Pei [...] "the most distinguished member of his Late-Modernist generation still in practice". At the same time, Pei himself rejects simple dichotomies of architectural trends. He once said: [...] "The talk about modernism versus post-modernism is unimportant. It's a side issue. An individual building, the style in which <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> designed and built, is not that important. The important thing, really, is the community.

500|$|After a tank is cleaned, {{provided}} that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> prepared for entry, {{it will be}} purged. Purging is accomplished by pumping inert gas into the tank until hydrocarbons have been sufficiently expelled. Next the tank is gas freed which is usually accomplished by blowing fresh air into the space with portable air powered or water powered air blowers. [...] "Gas freeing" [...] brings the oxygen content of the tank up to 20.8% O2. The inert gas buffer between fuel and oxygen atmospheres ensures they are never capable of ignition. Specially trained personnel monitor the tank's atmosphere, often using hand-held gas indicators which measure the percentage of hydrocarbons present. After a tank is gas-free, it may be further hand-cleaned in a manual process known as mucking. Mucking requires protocols for entry into confined spaces, protective clothing, designated safety observers, and possibly the use of airline respirators.|$|E

This writing project may have been a reaction to Waugh's immediate circumstances; he was in the last weeks of his Oxford career, contemplating failure in his examinations and irritated by {{the fact that most of}} his contemporaries appeared to be on the verge of brilliant careers. On [...] 22 June 1924 he spent time working out the plot, a continuation of the supernatural theme explored in [...] "Unacademic Exercise". The basic premise was an undergraduate inheriting a country house of which nothing was left except an 18th-century folly, where he set up house and practised black magic.|$|E

It was the visitors who had led the match right from the 15th minute, but for Arsenal midfielder Paul Merson to earn his side a point after equalising well into stoppage time. The draw according to The Independent showcased the need for reinforcements: [...] "...not just to improve the squad, but also to cause a buzz in the dressing room". Arsenal were beaten 3–1 by Everton at Goodison Park three days after and lost to Aston Villa by the same scoreline. Graham dismissed any talk of crisis, saying [...] "I have been in football too long to think <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> nice and comfortable every season" [...] and felt the performance at Villa showed signs of improvement compared to the earlier league fixtures.
