40|$|Parallel {{microscopic}} experimentation (the combinatorial approach {{often used}} in solid-state science) was applied to characterize atmospheric copper corrosion behavior. Specifically, this technique permitted relative sulfidation rates to be determined for copper containing different levels of point defects and impurities (In, Al, O, and D). Corrosion studies are inherently difficult because of complex interactions between material interfaces and the environment. The combinatorial approach was demonstrated using micron-scale Cu lines that were exposed to a humid air environment containing sub-ppm levels of H{sub 2 }S. The relative rate of Cu{sub 2 }S growth was determined by measuring the change in resistance of the line. The data suggest that vacancy trapping by In and Al impurities slow the sulfidation rate.

The 2 BL comprises 52 objects with no apparent proper motion, over the magnitude range 16. 0 < bJ < 20. 0. Follow-up high signal-to-noise spectra of 36 2 BL objects and NIR imaging of 18 objects, together with data for 19 2 BL objects found in the Sloan Digital Sky survey (SDSS), show 17 objects to be stellar, while a further 16 objects have evidence of weak, broad emission features, although {{for at least one}} of these the continuum level has clearly varied.

In this paper we have focused on studying the environments of Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars in M 31 to find evidence for WR wind-ISM interactions, through imaging ionized hydrogen nebulae surrounding these stars. We have conducted a systematic survey for HII shells surrounding 48 of the 49 known WR stars in M 31. There are 17 WR stars surrounded by single shells, or shell fragments, 7 stars surrounded by concentric limb brightened shells, 20 stars where there is no clear physical association of the star with nearby H-alpha emission, and 4 stars which lack nearby H-alpha emission. For the 17 + 7 shells above, there are 12 which contain one or two massive stars (including a WR star) and that are <= 40 pc in radius. These 12 shells may be classical WR ejecta or wind-blown shells. Further, there may be excess H-alpha point source emission associated with one of the 12 WR stars surrounded by putative ejecta or wind-blown shells. There is also evidence for <b>excess</b> <b>point</b> source emission associated with 11 other WR stars. The excess emission may arise from unresolved circumstellar shells, or within the extended outer envelopes of the stars themselves. In a few cases we find clear morphological evidence for WR shells interacting with each other.

At the distance to the Galactic center (8 kpc), we are sensitive to sources with luminosities > 4 e 32 erg/s (0. 5 - 8. 0 keV; 90 % confidence) over an area of one square degree, and up to an order of magnitude more sensitive in the deepest exposure (1. 0 Msec) around Sgr A*. The positions of 60 % of our sources are accurate to < 1 " (95 % confidence), and 20 % have positions accurate to < 0. 5 ".

We demonstrate that a gamma-ray emission with spectral and morphological features closely matching the observed excess arises from a population of cosmic ray protons in the inner Galaxy, and provide proof of principle and arguments for the existence of such a population, most likely originating from local supernova remnants. Specifically, the "Galactic center excess" is readily explained by a recent cosmic-ray injection burst, with an age in the 1 - 10 kilo-year range, while the extended inner Galaxy <b>excess</b> <b>points</b> to mega-year old injection episodes, continuous or impulsive.
