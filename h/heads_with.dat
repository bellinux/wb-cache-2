5|$|Corrupt {{politicians}} are {{already beginning to}} speculate on them as possible capital for their schemes and to fill their poor <b>heads</b> <b>with</b> all sorts of vagaries. Florida is the State into which they have, more than anywhere else, been pouring. Emigration is positively and decidedly setting that way; but as yet it is mere worldly emigration, {{with the hope of}} making money, nothing more.|$|E

5|$|His accomplishments {{were not}} {{confined}} to the track. He was deeply resentful toward the treatment given toward amateur athletes.

5|$|Mantises have large, {{triangular}} <b>heads</b> <b>with</b> a beak-like snout and mandibles. They {{have two}} bulbous compound eyes, three small simple eyes, {{and a pair}} of antennae.

5|$|While {{individual}} dogs may vary, {{in general}} show-bred Labradors are heavier built, slightly shorter-bodied, {{and have a}} thicker coat and tail. Field Labradors are generally longer-legged, lighter, and more lithe in build, making them agile. In the head, show Labradors tend to have broader heads, better defined stops, and more powerful necks, while field Labradors have lighter and slightly narrower <b>heads</b> <b>with</b> longer muzzles.|$|E
5|$|Higginbotham played {{six games}} for United during the 1999–2000 season, {{including}} {{appearances in the}} UEFA Champions League and at the Maracanã Stadium in the FIFA Club World Championship. He made his full debut in a 3–0 defeat to Aston Villa at Villa Park on 13 October 1999, in what {{was described as a}} blow to the credibility of the League Cup as United had fielded a number of young players. He suffered with concussion during the match after a clash of <b>heads</b> <b>with</b> Dion Dublin. He failed to break into the first team on a regular basis as Denis Irwin, Phil Neville and Mikaël Silvestre were all preferred ahead of him at left-back.|$|E

5|$|In the Carnian {{stage of}} the Late Triassic (228.0 - 216.5 Mya), capitosauroids were joined by the superficially very similar Metoposauridae. Metoposaurids are {{distinguished}} from capitosauroids by the positioning of their eye sockets {{near the front of}} their skulls. Another group of stereospondyls, the plagiosaurs, had wide <b>heads</b> <b>with</b> external gills, and adapted to life at the bottom of lakes and rivers. By this time, temnospondyls had become a common and widespread component of semiaquatic ecosystems. Some temnospondyls, such as Cryobatrachus and Kryostega, even inhabited Antarctica, which was covered in temperate forests at the time.|$|E
5|$|Judah {{made his}} {{professional}} debut as an 18-year-old on September 20, 1996, in Miami, Florida and defeated Michael Johnson by technical knockout {{in the second}} round. On April 14, 1998, Judah defeated Angel Beltre in the second round. Judah accidentally butted <b>heads</b> <b>with</b> Esteban Flores in a fight in March 1999. Flores was cut on his forehead, and the match was halted in the third round. The bout was originally recorded as a technical draw, but the result was changed to a no contest in May 1999.|$|E
5|$|Konnan {{is known}} to be outspoken, and in the last decade, he has been openly {{critical}} of promotions that he feels have mistreated either himself personally or the talent in general. He has been particularly outspoken against what he sees as racism against Latino wrestlers in United States promotions – he butted <b>heads</b> <b>with</b> TNA over treatment of himself and Ron Killings, and WWE over issues regarding Latino wrestlers Alberto Del Rio and Rey Mysterio, but he has also come into conflict with AAA over what he alleged was non-payment of talent.|$|E

5|$|Mantises are {{an order}} (Mantodea) of insects that {{contains}} over 2,400 species in about 430 genera in 15 families. The largest {{family is the}} Mantidae ("mantids"). Mantises are distributed worldwide in temperate and tropical habitats. They have triangular <b>heads</b> <b>with</b> bulging eyes supported on flexible necks. Their elongated bodies {{may or may not}} have wings, but all Mantodea have forelegs that are greatly enlarged and adapted for catching and gripping prey; their upright posture, while remaining stationary with forearms folded, has led to the common name praying mantis.|$|E
5|$|Nick Offerman as Ron Swanson, {{the cynical}} {{director}} of the parks department and Leslie's boss. Due to his incredibly negative view of government, he regularly works to make his department as inefficient as possible. This leads him to butt <b>heads</b> <b>with</b> Leslie {{on a number of}} occasions, as her philosophy regarding government is the polar opposite. Despite that, both he and Leslie have a large amount of respect for one another. Ron has been married twice; both of his ex-wives are named Tammy. He despises and fears them greatly, as they are the only two women in the world that can control him.|$|E
5|$|Ponies often exhibit thicker manes, tails, {{and overall}} coat. They also have {{proportionally}} shorter legs, wider barrels, heavier bone, shorter and thicker necks, and short <b>heads</b> <b>with</b> broad foreheads. They may have calmer temperaments than horses {{and also a}} high level of intelligence {{that may or may not}} be used to cooperate with human handlers. Small size, by itself, is not an exclusive determinant. For example, the Shetland pony which averages , is considered a pony. Conversely, breeds such as the Falabella and other miniature horses, which can be no taller than , are classified by their registries as very small horses, not ponies.|$|E

5|$|Some frogs {{have become}} adapted for {{burrowing}} {{and a life}} underground. They tend to have rounded bodies, short limbs, small <b>heads</b> <b>with</b> bulging eyes, and hind feet adapted for excavation. An extreme {{example of this is}} the purple frog (Nasikabatrachus sahyadrensis) from southern India which feeds on termites and spends almost its whole life underground. It emerges briefly during the monsoon to mate and breed in temporary pools. It has a tiny head with a pointed snout and a plump, rounded body. Because of this fossorial existence, it was first described in 2003, being new to the scientific community at that time, although previously known to local people.|$|E
5|$|The Crusaders {{finished}} as runner-ups in the 2004 Super 12 season, {{losing the}} final to the Brumbies.

In the first test against England he was escorted off the field after suffering concussion following a clash of <b>heads</b> <b>with</b> fellow All Black Xavier Rush. He was a late withdrawal from the second England test and then played 70 minutes against Argentina before again leaving the field due to dizziness.|$|E
