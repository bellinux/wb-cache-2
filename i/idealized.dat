5|$|A simple model which predicts lyotropic phase {{transitions}} is the hard-rod model {{proposed by}} Lars Onsager. This theory considers the volume {{excluded from the}} center-of-mass of one <b>idealized</b> cylinder as it approaches another. Specifically, if the cylinders are oriented parallel to one another, {{there is very little}} volume that is excluded from the center-of-mass of the approaching cylinder (it can come quite close to the other cylinder). If, however, the cylinders are at some angle to one another, then there is a large volume surrounding the cylinder which the approaching cylinder's center-of-mass cannot enter (due to the hard-rod repulsion between the two <b>idealized</b> objects). Thus, this angular arrangement sees a decrease in the net positional entropy of the approaching cylinder (there are fewer states available to it).|$|E
5|$|Alongside {{the iconic}} cowboy, gunfighters {{have become a}} {{cultural}} image of the American people abroad, and also as an <b>idealized</b> image of violence, frontier justice, and adventure. Even outside of the Western genre, the term 'gunslinger' {{has been used in}} modern times to describe someone who is fast and accurate with pistols, either in real life or in other fictional action genre.|$|E

5|$|Farm {{animals are}} {{widespread}} {{in books and}} songs for children; the reality of animal husbandry is often distorted, softened, or <b>idealized,</b> giving children an almost entirely fictitious account of farm life. The books often depict a rural idyll of happy animals free to roam in attractive countryside, which is completely {{at odds with the}} realities of the impersonal, mechanized activities involved in modern intensive farming.|$|E
5|$|In this <b>idealized</b> and linearized model, {{there are}} many {{geometric}} parameters (wheelbase, head angle, mass of each body, wheel radius, etc.), but only four significant variables: lean angle, lean rate, steer angle, and steer rate. These equations have been verified by comparison with multiple numeric models derived completely independently.|$|E

5|$|The obverse {{features}} an <b>idealized</b> portrait of Ira Allen, one {{different from the}} one Fry had used in his statue and models. Allen wears a periwig, and below his head appears his name. The words FOUNDER OF VERMONT and UNITED STATES OF AMERICA surround his portrait.|$|E
5|$|Walter Pitts and Warren McCulloch {{analyzed}} {{networks of}} <b>idealized</b> artificial neurons and showed {{how they might}} perform simple logical functions.

One of the students inspired by Pitts and McCulloch was a young Marvin Minsky, then a 24-year-old graduate student. In 1951 (with Dean Edmonds) he built the first neural net machine, the SNARC.|$|E
5|$|According to Swami Vivekananda, Sita {{is typical}} of India – the <b>idealized</b> India. Swami Vivekananda assured if world {{literature}} {{of the past and}} world literature of the future are thoroughly exhausted, yet, it'll not be possible to find out another Sita, because Sita is unique, the character was depicted once for all. Swami Vivekananda felt there may have been several Ramas, perhaps, but never more than one Sita.|$|E
50|$|Kohut {{departed}} from the classical Freudian view, which suggested that some patients could not be analyzed given that they lacked the ability to develop transferences. He postulated that narcissistic patients are capable of presenting transferences but these are somewhat {{different from those of}} other patients, such as the neurotics. He distinguished three types, namely the <b>idealizing,</b> the mirror, or the twinship transference. His debate with Kernberg concerns mostly the <b>idealizing</b> transference, which, according to Kohut, relates to a fixation at an archaic level of normal development. Still Kernberg believed that the <b>idealizing</b> transference {{is nothing more than a}} pathological type of idealization that is produced as a response to the substantial instigation of the grandiose self in the transference.|$|R

5|$|Demosthenes grew {{interested}} in politics during his time as a logographer, and in 354BC he gave his first public political speeches. He went on to devote his most productive years to opposing Macedon's expansion. He <b>idealized</b> his city and strove throughout his life to restore Athens' supremacy and motivate his compatriots against Philip II of Macedon. He sought to preserve his city's freedom and to establish an alliance against Macedon, in an unsuccessful attempt to impede Philip's plans to expand his influence southward by conquering all the other Greek states.|$|E
5|$|Experimentation {{with real}} bikes {{has so far}} {{confirmed}} the weave mode predicted by the eigenvalues. It was found that tire slip and frame flex are not important for the lateral dynamics of the bicycle in the speed range up to 6 m/s. The <b>idealized</b> bike model {{used to calculate the}} eigenvalues shown here does not incorporate any of the torques that real tires can generate, and so tire interaction with the pavement cannot prevent the capsize mode from becoming unstable at high speeds, as Wilson and Cossalter suggest happens in the real world.|$|E
5|$|From the 1890s to the 1930s, American heiress Natalie Clifford Barney held {{a weekly}} salon in Paris to which major artistic celebrities were invited and where lesbian topics were the focus. Combining Greek {{influences}} with contemporary French eroticism, {{she attempted to}} create an updated and <b>idealized</b> version of Lesbos in her salon. Her contemporaries included artist Romaine Brooks, who painted others in her circle; writers Colette, Djuna Barnes, social host Gertrude Stein, and novelist Radclyffe Hall.|$|E

5|$|Her {{death was}} widely publicised shortly {{afterwards}} by the Polish press, which contributed to her growing fame. Plater {{became one of}} the symbols of the uprising. The symbol of the fighting girl became quite widespread both in Poland, Lithuania and abroad. Mickiewicz immortalized her in his poem, Śmierć pułkownika (Death of a Colonel), although the description of her death is a pure poetical fiction and was only loosely based on her real life. Mickiewicz has also <b>idealized</b> her personality and skills, portraying her as the ideal commander, worshiped by her soldiers. That poem has entered the elementary curriculum in the independent Poland.|$|E
5|$|In 1928, Crawford starred {{opposite}} Ramón Novarro in Across to Singapore, {{but it was}} {{her role}} as Diana Medford in Our Dancing Daughters (1928) that catapulted her to stardom. The role established her as a symbol of modern 1920s-style femininity which rivaled Clara Bow, the original It girl, then Hollywood's foremost flapper. A stream of hits followed Our Dancing Daughters, including two more flapper-themed movies, in which Crawford embodied for her legion of fans (many of whom were women) an <b>idealized</b> vision of the free-spirited, all-American girl.|$|E
5|$|In 1978, Riefenstahl {{published}} a book of her sub-aquatic photographs called Korallengärten ("Coral Gardens"), followed by the 1990 book Wunder unter Wasser ("Wonder under Water"). In her 90s, Riefenstahl was still photographing marine life and gained {{the distinction of being}} one of the world's oldest scuba divers. On 22 August 2002, her 100th birthday, she released the film Impressionen unter Wasser ("Underwater Impressions"), an <b>idealized</b> documentary of life in the oceans and her first film in over 25 years. Riefenstahl was a member of Greenpeace for eight years.|$|E

5|$|Many {{surviving}} funerary busts reached Western museums {{during the}} 19th century. Palmyra provided {{the most convenient}} Eastern examples bolstering an art-history controversy {{at the turn of}} the 20th century: to what extent Eastern influence on Roman art replaced <b>idealized</b> classicism with frontal, hieratic and simplified figures (as believed by Josef Strzygowski and others). This transition is seen as a response to cultural changes in the Western Roman Empire, rather than artistic influence from the East. Palmyrene bust reliefs, unlike Roman sculptures, are rudimentary portraits; although many reflect high quality individuality, the majority vary little across figures of similar age and gender.|$|E
5|$|Plato {{wrote about}} epikleroi in his Laws, {{offering}} <b>idealized</b> laws to govern their marriages. In mythology and history, {{a number of}} Greek women {{appear to have been}} epikleroi, including Agariste of Sicyon and Agiatis, the widow of the Spartan king Agis IV. The status of epikleroi has often been used to explain the numbers of sons-in-law who inherited from their fathers-in-law in Greek mythology. The Third Sacred War originated in a dispute over epikleroi.|$|E
5|$|The Princess {{was married}} by proxy to PedroII in 1843. Her spouse's {{expectations}} {{had been raised}} when a portrait was presented that depicted Teresa Cristina as an <b>idealized</b> beauty, but he was displeased by his bride's plain looks upon their first meeting later that year. Despite a cold beginning, the couple's relationship improved as time passed, due primarily to Teresa Cristina's patience, kindness, generosity and simplicity. These traits also helped her win {{the hearts of the}} Brazilian people, and her distance from political controversies shielded her from criticism. She also sponsored archaeological studies in Italy and Italian immigration to Brazil.|$|E
