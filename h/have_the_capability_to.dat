5|$|Following World War II, several {{searches}} {{of the waters}} around North Stradbroke and Moreton Islands failed to reveal Centaurs location. It was believed that she had sunk {{off the edge of}} the continental shelf, to a depth at which the Royal Australian Navy did not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>capability</b> <b>to</b> search for a vessel of Centaurs size. Some parties also believed that Rippon's calculated point of sinking was inaccurate, either intentionally or through error.|$|E
5|$|Plug-in {{electric}} vehicles offer users {{the opportunity to}} sell electricity stored in their batteries back to the power grid, thereby helping utilities to operate more efficiently {{in the management of}} their demand peaks. A vehicle-to-grid (V2G) system would take advantage of the fact that most vehicles are parked an average of 95 percent of the time. During such idle times the electricity stored in the batteries could be transferred from the PEV to the power lines and back to the grid. In the U.S this transfer back to the grid have an estimated value to the utilities of up to $4,000 per year per car. In a V2G system it would also be expected that battery electric (BEVs) and plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) would <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>capability</b> <b>to</b> communicate automatically with the power grid to sell demand response services by either delivering electricity into the grid or by throttling their charging rate.|$|E

5|$|As the {{deadline}} of noon approached, set {{the previous day}} {{for the release of}} the Arab prisoners, the police became convinced that the gunmen did not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>capability</b> <b>to</b> carry out their threat of blowing up the embassy, and persuaded Oan to agree to a new deadline of 14:00. The police allowed {{the deadline}} to pass, to no immediate response from the gunmen. During the afternoon, Oan altered his demands, requesting that the British media broadcast a statement of the group's grievances and for ambassadors of three Arab countries to negotiate the group's safe passage out of the UK once the statement had been broadcast. At approximately 20:00, Oan became agitated by noises coming from the Ethiopian Embassy next door. The noise came from technicians who were drilling holes in the wall to implant listening devices, but PC Trevor Lock, when asked to identify the sound, attributed it to mice. COBRA decided to create ambient noise to cover the sound created by the technicians and instructed British Gas to commence drilling in an adjacent road, supposedly to repair a gas main. The drilling was aborted after it agitated the gunmen, and instead British Airports Authority, owner of London Heathrow Airport, was told to instruct approaching aircraft to fly over the embassy at low altitude.|$|E
5|$|The station can be {{seen from}} the Earth with the naked eye and, as of , is the largest {{artificial}} satellite in Earth orbit with a mass and volume greater than that of any previous space station. The Soyuz spacecraft delivers crew members, stays docked for their half-year-long missions and then returns them home. Several uncrewed cargo spacecraft service the ISS, they are the Russian Progress spacecraft which has done so since 2000, the European Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) since 2008, the Japanese H-II Transfer Vehicle (HTV) since 2009, the American Dragon spacecraft since 2012, and the American Cygnus spacecraft since 2013. The Space Shuttle, before its retirement, was also used for cargo transfer and would often switch out expedition crew members, although it did not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>capability</b> <b>to</b> remain docked for the duration of their stay. Until another US manned spacecraft is ready, crew members will travel to and from the International Space Station exclusively aboard the Soyuz. The highest number of people occupying the ISS has been thirteen; this occurred three times during the late Shuttle ISS assembly missions.|$|E

25|$|When {{developing}} or troubleshooting the SPI bus, {{examination of}} hardware signals {{can be very}} important. Logic analyzers are tools which collect, analyze, decode, and store signals so people can view the high-speed waveforms at their leisure. Logic analyzers display time-stamps of each signal level change, which can help find protocol problems. Most logic analyzers <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>capability</b> <b>to</b> decode bus signals into high-level protocol data and show ASCII data.|$|E
25|$|Since 2010, EastEnders {{no longer}} uses tapes in the {{recording}} or editing process. After footage is recorded, the material is sent digitally to the post production team. The editors then assemble all the scenes recorded for the director to view and note any changes that are needed. The sound team also <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>capability</b> <b>to</b> access the edited episode, enabling them to dub the sound and create the final version.|$|E
25|$|To date, {{only three}} countries, the United States, Russia, and China, <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>capability</b> <b>to</b> launch humans into orbit. However, 520 astronauts {{from more than}} thirty {{different}} countries have flown in space {{and many of them}} have participated in space neuroscience research. The launch of the first living animal in orbit on Sputnik on November 3, 1957 marked the beginning of a rich history of unique scientific and technological achievements in space life sciences that have spanned more than fifty years to date.|$|E

25|$|Container cranes {{consist of}} a {{supporting}} framework that can traverse {{the length of a}} quay or yard on a rail track. Instead of a hook, they are equipped with a specialized handling tool called a spreader. The spreader can be lowered on top of a container and locks onto the container's four locking points ("corner castings") using a twistlock mechanism. Cranes normally transport a single container at once, but some newer cranes <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>capability</b> <b>to</b> pick up two to four 20-foot containers at once.|$|E
25|$|Thiopental is a {{rapid and}} {{effective}} drug for inducing unconsciousness, since it causes {{loss of consciousness}} upon a single circulation through the brain due to its high lipophilicity. Only a few other drugs, such as methohexital, etomidate, or propofol, <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>capability</b> <b>to</b> induce anesthesia so rapidly. (Narcotics such as fentanyl are inadequate as induction agents for anesthesia.) Supporters argue that since the thiopental is given {{at a much higher}} dose than for medically induced coma protocols, it is effectively impossible for the condemned to wake up.|$|E
25|$|This list {{includes}} countries with an independent capability to place satellites in orbit, including {{production of the}} necessary launch vehicle. Note: many more countries <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>capability</b> <b>to</b> design and build satellites but are unable to launch them, instead relying on foreign launch services. This list does not consider those numerous countries, but only lists those capable of launching satellites indigenously, and the date this capability was first demonstrated.

25|$|In {{addition}} to the operational missions, the VNAF 920th Training Squadron operated T-37Bs for initial jet training for its aviation cadets. American policy in Vietnam after 1970 was aimed at self-sufficiency for the VNAF so the South Vietnamese could maintain the level of security that had been won jointly by the United States and South Vietnam. The United States would continue to provide material support {{for the defense of}} South Vietnam, but it was expected that the VNAF would <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>capability</b> <b>to</b> use United States equipment effectively. If that capability could be developed, the VNAF would be judged self-sufficient.|$|E
25|$|Third {{generation}} sequencing {{technologies have}} demonstrated promising prospects {{in solving the}} problem of transcript detection as well as mRNA abundance estimation {{at the level of}} transcripts. While error rates remain high, third generation sequencing technologies <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>capability</b> <b>to</b> produce much longer read lengths. Pacific Bioscience has introduced the iso-seq platform, proposing to sequence mRNA molecules at their full lengths. It is anticipated that Oxford Nanopore will put forth similar technologies. The trouble with higher error rates may be alleviated by supplementary high quality short reads. This approach has been previously tested and reported to reduce the error rate by more than 3 folds.|$|E
