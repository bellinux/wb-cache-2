5|$|The typical {{dry weather}} at McCarran allows {{operations}} under visual flying rules 99% of the time; visibility falls to marginal and instrument-only conditions less than 1% of the time. During {{most of the}} year (approximately 56% of the time), due to prevailing winds, the airport operates in Visual Configuration 1, which <b>favors</b> 19R and 26L for arrivals and 19L and 26R for departures. Airfield capacity in Configuration 1 is constrained by bordering military airspace, high terrain to the west of McCarran, and an uphill departure from 26R. Because of the heat, 26R is favored over 19L for departures. When the winds shift in the winter (approximately 13% of the year), the airfield adopts Visual Configuration 3, which <b>favors</b> 01L and 26L for arrivals and 01L and 01R for departures. Marginal flying conditions adopt the same Configuration 1/Configuration 3 split based on the prevailing winds. Under instrument flying conditions, arrivals are preferred on 26L, and departures take off from 19L and 26R.|$|E

5|$|There is {{some debate}} over whether the Electoral College <b>favors</b> small- or large-population states. Those who argue that the College <b>favors</b> low-population states point out that such states have {{proportionally}} more electoral votes relative to their populations, because each state's number of electors is greater by two than its (proportionally allocated) number of Congressional representatives. In the most populous state, California, this results in an electoral clout 16% smaller than a purely proportional allocation would produce, whereas the least-populous states, with three electors, hold a voting power 143% greater than they would under purely proportional allocation. The proposed compact would give equal weight to each voter's ballot, regardless of what state they live in. Others, however, believe that since most states award electoral votes on a winner-takes-all system, the potential of populous states to shift greater numbers of electoral votes gives them more actual clout.|$|E

40|$|Different synonymous codons are <b>favored</b> {{by natural}} {{selection}} for translation efficiency and accuracy in different organisms. The rules governing the identities of <b>favored</b> codons in different organisms remain obscure.

Once the effect of the genomic GC content on selectively <b>favored</b> codon choice is taken into account, additional universal amino acid specific rules governing the identity of <b>favored</b> codons become apparent. Our results provide for the first time a clear set of rules governing the evolution of selectively <b>favored</b> codon usage.
