In cool years, some growers will wait until November to harvest in hopes of having a higher level of ripeness and subsequent tartaric acid.|$|E

LaGuardia, working to give {{civilian}} volunteers expanded roles in war preparations. She soon found herself in a power struggle with LaGuardia, who preferred to focus on narrower aspects of defense, while she saw solutions to broader social problems as <b>equally</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> the war effort. Though LaGuardia resigned from the OCD in December 1941, Eleanor {{was forced to resign}} following anger in the House of Representatives over high salaries for several OCD appointments, including two of her close friends.|$|E

25|$|Time. A {{key factor}} in guerrilla {{strategy}} is a drawn-out, protracted conflict that wears down {{the will of the}} opposing counter-insurgent forces. Democracies are especially vulnerable to the factor of time. The counter-insurgent force must allow enough time to get the job done.

25|$|<b>Equally</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> {{the later}} {{development}} of the Cthulhu Mythos {{was that it was}} a reprint of this story in Weird Tales that inspired Robert E.

500|$|The text {{describes}} {{types of}} songs and music, instruments and dances along with occasions of their performance. The Tripadi, states {{the text in}} chapter 4.16, was performed during harvesting and husking season, the Shatpadi was performed by folk story tellers, the Dhavala sung at marriages, while festivals such as Holi were celebrated with Mangala and Caccari genre of songs and music. The Charya, asserts the text, were songs of meditation. The text claims Gana (गान) to {{be a form of}} [...] "popular music" [...] and that Geet that is neither fast nor slow, but contains both high and low notes, where the words and musical meter are <b>equally</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> be preferred by spiritual teachers.|$|E
500|$|The name Windy Nook {{derives from}} [...] "the lofty and exposed {{nature of the}} {{situation}} it occupies". In 1784, Richard Kell began quarrying at Heworth Shore. His business expanded quickly and, {{by the turn of}} the 19th century, Kell and his family had established a second quarry at Windy Nook which was known as Kell's Quarry. This, along with a number of pre-existing, smaller quarries, provided work for the early settlers and by 1820 there existed a [...] "modern but populous village". The quarries of Windy Nook became renowned, described as <b>equally</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> the more vaunted quarries of Yorkshire and producing sandstone and 'Newcastle grindstone' of sufficient quality that stones from Kell's Quarry were used to build St Alban's Church and other local buildings.|$|E
500|$|In its advance from Avranches to Argentan, the Third Army traversed [...] in {{just two}} weeks. Patton's force was {{supplemented}} by Ultra intelligence {{for which he was}} briefed daily by his G-2, Colonel Oscar W. Koch, who apprised him of German counterattacks, and where to concentrate his forces. <b>Equally</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> the advance of Third Army columns in northern France was the rapid advance of the supply echelons. Third Army logistics were overseen by Colonel Walter J. Muller, Patton's G-4, who emphasized flexibility, improvisation, and adaptation for Third Army supply echelons so forward units could rapidly exploit a breakthrough. Patton's rapid drive to Lorraine demonstrated his keen appreciation for the technological advantages of the U.S. Army. The major U.S. and Allied advantages were in mobility and air superiority. The U.S. Army had more trucks, more reliable tanks, and better radio communications, all of which contributed to a superior ability to operate at a rapid offensive pace.|$|E

500|$|On 8 April 1630, four ships {{left the}} Isle of Wight {{carrying}} Winthrop {{and other leaders}} of the colony. [...] Winthrop sailed on the Arbella, accompanied by his two young sons Samuel and Stephen. [...] The ships {{were part of a}} larger fleet totalling 11 ships that carried about 700 migrants to the colony. [...] Winthrop's son Henry Winthrop missed the Arbella sailing and ended up on the Talbot, which also sailed from Wight. [...] Winthrop wrote a sermon entitled A Modell of Christian Charity, which was delivered either before or during the crossing. [...] It described the ideas and plans to keep the Puritan society strong in faith, while also comparing the struggles {{that they would have to}} overcome in the New World with the story of Exodus. In it, he used the now-famous phrase [...] "City upon a Hill" [...] to describe the ideals to which the colonists should strive, and that consequently [...] "the eyes of all people are upon us." [...] He also said, [...] "In all times some must be rich some poore, some highe and eminent in power and dignitie; others meane and in subjection"; that is, all societies include some who are rich and successful and others who are poor and subservient—and both groups were <b>equally</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> the colony because both groups were members to the same community.|$|E
2500|$|Like recruitment, {{turnover}} can {{be classified}} as [...] "internal" [...] or [...] "external". Internal turnover involves employees leaving their current positions and taking new positions within the same organization. Both positive (such as increased morale from the change of task and supervisor) and negative (such as project/relational disruption, or the Peter Principle) effects of internal turnover exist, and therefore, it may be <b>equally</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> monitor this form of turnover {{as it is to}} monitor its external counterpart.|$|E
2500|$|But <b>equally</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> the {{question}} of KI {{is the fact that}} radioactivity releases are not [...] "local" [...] events.

2500|$|Keller also {{discusses}} {{a primary}} {{critic of the}} long poem, Kamboureli, in her essay. Kamboureli's stance is that long poem's readers and contributors should not preference one form of long poem over another. To extend this idea, it is also <b>equally</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> say that one type of author within this genre should not be privileged over another. The textual [...] "betweeness", an idea coined by Kamboureli and discussed in Keller's essay, provides a place where writers can create their art in a genre that is by its nature less restrictive than other poetic forms. [...] This lack of restriction should be the very reason that the genre should be open to all. [...] Its hybridisms and variety will only be enhanced {{by the presence of}} women and other writers.|$|E
2500|$|Lars Bo Jensen {{has criticized}} the Hans Christian Andersen/Jenny Lind theory: [...] "...to judge Andersen from a biographical {{point of view}} only is to reduce great and {{challenging}} literature to casebook notes. Thus it is a pity to regard [...] "The Nightingale" [...] as simply the story of Andersen's passion for the singer Jenny Lind, when it is <b>equally</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> focus on what the tale says about art, love, nature, being, life, and death, or on the uniquely beautiful and highly original way in which these issues are treated. Andersen's works are great, but it has become customary to make them seem small. It has been and still is the task of interpreters of Hans Christian Andersen's life and work to adjust this picture {{and to try to}} show him as a thinking poet." ...|$|E
2500|$|All that {{is known}} about him comes from the {{writings}} of a later student at the cathedral known as Anonymous IV, an Englishman who left a treatise on theory and who mentions Léonin as the composer of the Magnus Liber, the [...] "great book" [...] of organum. [...] Much of the Magnus Liber is devoted to clausulaemelismatic portions of Gregorian chant which were extracted into separate pieces where the original note values of the chant were greatly slowed down and [...] a fast-moving upper part is superimposed. [...] Léonin {{might have been the}} first composer to use the rhythmic modes, and maybe he invented a notation for them. According to W.G. Waite, writing in 1954: [...] "It was Léonin's incomparable achievement to introduce a rational system of rhythm into polyphonic music for the first time, and, <b>equally</b> <b>important,</b> <b>to</b> create a method of notation expressive of this rhythm." ...|$|E
