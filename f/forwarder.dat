2500|$|Vasily Markelov (later {{changed to}} Margelov {{due to a}} {{spelling}} error) was born on 27 December 1906 {{in the city of}} Ekaterinoslav, the son of Belarusian immigrants Filipp Ivanovich Markelov and Agata Stepanovna.

[...] In 1913, the Markelov family returned to Belarus and settled in Kastsyukovichy, the hometown of Margelov's father, where he graduated from the local parochial school in the mid-1910s. As a teenager, he worked as a loader and a carpenter. In the same year, he became an apprentice in a tanning shop and soon became an assistant master. In 1923, Margelov became a laborer in a local bakery. There is some evidence that Margelov graduated from the School of Rural Youth and worked as a <b>forwarder</b> in local mail delivery.|$|E

Purchasing negotiation is considered an important business process for freight <b>forwarders</b> and achieving a successful negotiation outcome should help <b>forwarders</b> to manage their business more effectively. This study used the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) approach to identify the critical factors for successful purchasing negotiation for freight <b>forwarders</b> in Korea. A three-level AHP structure was constructed to examine the successful purchasing negotiation.

The <b>forwarders</b> {{play a central role}} in this development and in this study, the factors that the <b>forwarders</b> use to choose airline operators, are analyzed. The factors have been revealed from an empirical study where <b>forwarders</b> were interviewed on their preferences on the issue. The results show that although price is a major determinant in contracting, especially for the smaller <b>forwarders,</b> service and quality of services in addition to lead times play a chief role in determining the airline operator to work with on certain routes...|$|R

Grosso and Monteiro (2008) study the port selection criteria of freight <b>forwarders</b> in the port of Genoa, identifying port connectivity, cost and productivity, electronic information, and logistics as a few main criteria. To address competitiveness, Aronietis et al. (2010) use cost, capacity, hinterland connection, reliability, location, flexibility, and other evaluation criteria for Western European ports. The port selections of shippers and <b>forwarders</b> are analyzed by Langen (2007), who focuses on Australia and highlights that shippers and <b>forwarders</b> have similar views, although shippers indicate less price-elastic demand.|$|R
50|$|A freight {{exchange}} is an online service for haulage companies, logistics providers, freight <b>forwarders</b> and transport companies.

Logistics providers and freight <b>forwarders</b> can advertise their freight loads that needs delivering as well as match their freight loads to the available vehicle capacity.These systems provide a platform that allows carriers to communicate freight traffic information to fellow operators such as transporters, <b>forwarders</b> and logistics companies. They allow <b>forwarders</b> to advertise their freight either privately or publicly to a large number of freight operators that are looking for loads. They also allow freight operators to offer vehicle space. Online systems are normally subscription-based with a small charge for advertising (posting) and searching (consulting).|$|R
