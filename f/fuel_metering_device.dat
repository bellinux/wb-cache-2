50|$|Andretti, {{leading by}} 1 lap, slowed down between turns 3 and 4, {{allowing}} Guerrero to pass him. At {{first it was}} believed that Andretti was ducking into the pits for his final pit stop. However, after leading 170 of 177 laps, Andretti suddenly slowed down the frontstretch on lap 177. An electrical failure in the <b>fuel</b> <b>metering</b> <b>device,</b> part of the fuel injection system, began flooding the engine with raw fuel. After the race, it was determined that Andretti had begun to back off to protect his lead. His lower revs developed a harmonic imbalance in the engine, which led to a broken valve spring.|$|E

The 5 -mode cycle was slightly more conservative for the carbon monoxide pollutant than the 7 -mode cycle. The data were evaluated to determine which mode(s) had the greatest influence on improving general aviation piston engine emissions.

40|$|The initial {{focus of}} TEDANN is on AGT- 1500 fuel flow dynamics: that is, fuel flow faults {{detectable}} in the {{signals from the}} Electronic Control Unit`s (ECU) diagnostic connector. These voltage signals represent {{the status of the}} Electro-Mechanical Fuel System (EMFS) in response to ECU commands. The EMFS is a <b>fuel</b> <b>metering</b> <b>device</b> that delivers fuel to the turbine engine under the management of the ECU. The ECU is an analog computer whose fuel flow algorithm is dependent upon throttle position, ambient air and turbine inlet temperatures, and compressor and turbine speeds. Each of these variables has a representative voltage signal available at the ECU`s J 1 diagnostic connector, which is accessed via the Automatic Breakout Box (ABOB). The ABOB is a firmware program capable of converting 128 separate analog data signals into digital format. The ECU`s J 1 diagnostic connector provides 32 analog signals to the ABOB. The ABOB contains a 128 to 1 multiplexer and an analog-to-digital converter, CP both operated by an 8 -bit embedded controller. The Army Research Laboratory (ARL) developed and published the hardware specifications as well as the micro-code for the ABOB Intel EPROM processor and the internal code for the multiplexer driver subroutine. Once the ECU analog readings are converted into a digital format, the data stream will be input directly into TEDANN via the serial RS- 232 port of the Contact Test Set (CTS) computer. The CTS computer is an IBM compatible personal computer designed and constructed for tactical use on the battlefield. The CTS has a 50 MHz 32 -bit Intel 80486 DX processor. It has a 200 MB hard drive and 8 MB RAM. The CTS also has serial, parallel and SCSI interface ports. The CTS will also host a frame-based expert system for diagnosing turbine engine faults (referred to as TED; not shown in Figure 1) ...|$|E

50|$|Liquefied {{natural gas}} is natural gas that has been cooled to {{a point at which}} it becomes a {{cryogenic}} liquid. In this liquid state, {{natural gas is}} more than 2 times as dense as highly compressed CNG. LNG fuel systems function on any vehicle capable of burning natural gas. Unlike CNG, which is stored at high pressure (typically 3000 or 3600 psi) and then regulated to a lower pressure that the engine can accept, LNG is stored at low pressure (50 to 150 psi) and simply vaporized by a heat exchanger before entering the <b>fuel</b> <b>metering</b> <b>devices</b> to the engine. Because of its high energy density compared to CNG, it is very suitable for those interested in long ranges while running on natural gas.|$|R
50|$|The Bernoulli Principle and its corollary, the Venturi effect, are {{essential}} to aerodynamic as well as hydrodynamic design concepts. Airfoil and hydrofoil designs to lift and steer air and water vessels (airplanes, ships and submarines) are derived from applications of the Bernoulli Principle and the Venturi effect, as are the instruments that measure rate of movement through the air or water (velocity indicators). Stability indication and control mechanisms such as gyroscopic altitude indicators and <b>fuel</b> <b>metering</b> <b>devices,</b> such as carburetors, function {{as a result of}} gas or fluid pressure differentials that create suction as demonstrated and measurable by gas/fluid pressure and velocity equations derived from the Bernoulli Principle and the Venturi Effect. A simple way to demonstrate the Venturi effect is to squeeze and release a flexible hose in which fluid is flowing: the partial vacuum produced in the constriction is sufficient to keep the hose collapsed.|$|R

This bus incorporated many new technologies to increase {{the safety of the}} bus passengers as well as pedestrians boarding and leaving the bus. These technologies emphasized increased visibility between the bus driver and pedestrians or vehicles, and included the use of high intensity discharge lighting, pedestrian and vehicle detection systems, and remote-mounted cameras. Passenger safety was also stressed, with the application of seat belts and improved emergency exits and lighting. A natural gas-fueled engine was developed for powering the bus.

40|$|This work {{introduces}} two new lost cost, electronically controlled <b>fuel</b> <b>metering</b> {{systems for}} small gas turbine engines, particularly applicable in remotely piloted vehicles. The first one incorporates a diaphragm operated flat-seat bypass valve {{to maintain a}} constant differential pressure across the metering valve, which is actuated by a digital linear actuator. In the second one, both the metering and the bypass valves are controlled by two independently operated digital linear actuators. The mathematical models for the first <b>fuel</b> <b>metering</b> system, were created and used for computer simulation. Next, after preparing the experimental test set-up, the manufactured prototype was tested and the models for both the steady state and the dynamic response were validated. Three design optimization criteria, fuel flow linearity, low sensitivity to the design parameters changes and fast dynamic response were examined to improve {{the performance of the}} proposed <b>fuel</b> <b>metering</b> system. Finally, a multi-objective optimization technique was developed and implemented to obtain the best design parameters of the system. For the second <b>fuel</b> <b>metering</b> system, first the mathematical models for both the steady state and dynamic response were developed. Next, due to the flexibility offered by this system, different control strategies for controlling the digital linear actuators during the normal operation mode of the actuators and also during the back-up operation modes were introduced and investigated. Finally, to investigate the impact of different control strategies on the dynamic response of the engine, a dynamic model for the engine was also developed and used. At the end, four available <b>fuel</b> <b>metering</b> systems, including the two new ones, were compared regarding their deviation from the fuel flow linearity, dynamic response and the cost...|$|R
