500|$|Renwick {{decided to}} use the {{flashback}} structure for several reasons. He felt that the episode should be about [...] "life After Victor, which <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> more interesting and not the route people are expecting you to take." [...] He realised that most viewers would have been aware of Victor's death because of the press coverage; there would be little point in having the death be the climax of the episode because everyone already knew the outcome. However, the focus would be upon Victor's death rather than the details of the accident. Renwick's decision to kill Victor in a road accident was fuelled by the writer's concerns about reckless driving. Also, the suddenness of an accident, as opposed to death by illness, would not negate the comic tone {{of the rest of the}} episode. The twist that the person responsible for Victor's death is Margaret's new best friend was designed to add some complexity to the show.|$|E
2500|$|Randall Jarrell gave Lord Weary's Castle high praise, writing, [...] "It {{is unusually}} {{difficult}} to say which are the best poems in Lord Weary's Castle: several are realized past changing, successes that vary only in scope and intensity--others are poems that almost any living poet would be pleased to have written ... {{one or two of}} these poems, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> read as long as men remember English." ...|$|E
2500|$|Japanese Metabolist architects {{produced}} a manifesto in 1960 which outlined goals to [...] "encourage active metabolic development of our society" [...] through design and technology. In the Material and Man {{section of the}} manifesto, Noboru Kawazoe suggests that:After several decades, with the rapid progress of communication technology, every one will have a “brain wave receiver” in his ear, which conveys directly and exactly {{what other people think}} about him and vice versa. What <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> known by all the people. There is no more individual consciousness, only the will of mankind as a whole.|$|E

2500|$|On January 22, 2011 coach Spoelstra {{replaced}} Arroyo as the Miami Heat {{starting point}} guard with Mario Chalmers. According to Spoelstra [...] "It’s not an indictment on Carlos... It’s just something <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> beneficial {{for the team}} right now." [...] Although Arroyo and Chalmers shared similar statistics, the latter edged Arroyo in the popular +/- statistics. On March 1, 2011, the Heat released Arroyo {{in an effort to}} clear a roster spot for the expected addition of free-agent guard Mike Bibby. During this season, Arroyo started 42 games with the Heat, averaging 5.6 points and 2 assists per game. He also improved his 3-point shooting to a career-best 43.8 average, leading the team in that statistic.|$|E
2500|$|For {{the next}} six years, Maus did not release any new music, and spent the {{majority}} of the time in isolation. Two years were devoted to finishing his dissertation, while another two were spent learning how to build modular synthesizers. Completed and submitted in 2014, the 338-page thesis [...] "Communication and Control" [...] discussed the influence of technology on control societies, and he was thereby awarded his PhD in political science from the University of Hawaii, where his thesis advisor was Michael J. Shapiro. He immediately started building the instruments that were ultimately used for the recording of his fourth album, Screen Memories (2017). Its release was accompanied by his first solo tour with a live band. [...] It will be available exclusively as a bonus vinyl disc on a career retrospective box set. In an October 2017 interview, he indicated a desire to record an album with Rosenberg: [...] "We’re both swamped right now ... but I've been talking about it for a long time, and he's been talking about it. It’s just a question of finding the right moment, which <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> after this." ...|$|E
