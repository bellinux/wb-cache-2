500|$|Prior to the series, Bobrov {{held a press}} luncheon in Moscow. He {{refused to}} {{consider}} that either team would sweep the series. To him, Team Canada had [...] "the fire power, know-how and goaltending", but how would it adapt to international rules, two-referee system and amateur officials? He conceded that Phil Esposito would [...] "be difficult {{to move from the}} front of the net. I expect there will be some surprises for us when we meet your Canadian stars." [...] He also predicted that Valeri Kharlamov [...] "will stand out, even against your best Canadians. By North American standards, he is small but he has an excellent shot. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> effective." [...] Sinden was aware of Kharlamov and he selected Ron Ellis to the Team Canada roster especially to cover Kharlamov.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah, let her and Emma {{know that}} I am {{sure it is}} not their fault. Come again to-morrow, please; <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> better.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{think he}} will! But if he did--No, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> a staff to guide a silly, priggish heart to the deeper wisdom." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I can {{interpret}} if Mr. Merton is puzzled, Mrs. Bower, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> {{understand better}} {{if we go to}} the laird's chamber.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's what <b>he</b> does mean. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> do that always. He's {{what people}} call imperious; but that isn't bad in a man, is it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do not know," [...] he answered, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> soon be {{satisfied}} with regarding his stone likeness, and then <b>he</b> <b>will</b> go away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! I shall do well enough--there'll be Neb; {{and as for}} Rupert, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> better {{satisfied}} ashore than at sea. Rupert {{is a sort of}} {{a natural}} lawyer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} sitting with one {{who was in the}} same case with yourself," [...] said I, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> one of your friends. They called him Robin Oig." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "However, I hope he {{will not}} trouble himself about them. After having taken Cacama's place, he could hardly wish to have Cacama's wife there; and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> very glad when he hears that she has left.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then good night, monsieur. May {{the good}} God bless you and aid you to-morrow, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will!</b> <b>I</b> do <b>think</b> {{you are the}} bravest man I ever met." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Always; but of late I find a {{great change}} in him. I cannot {{discover}} {{what is the}} matter with him. He has grown melancholy. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> not live.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not a smitch. I reckon he {{got scared}} {{when he saw}} you talkin' to that {{policeman}} yesterday, an' <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> give us a wide berth for a while." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] the Major agreed, [...] "he {{is a good}} talker, {{a regular}} society man; he is no great {{favorite}} of mine; <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> {{a little too much}} for us in a small station like this." ...|$|E
60|$|Lord. And {{the same}} parson, {{that did the}} former execution, {{is still in the}} next chamber; what with candles, wine, and quidding, which he has taken in abundance, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> able to wheedle two more of you into matrimony.|$|E
6000|$|Alton {{laughed a}} little. [...] "Oh, yes," [...] he said dryly. [...] "It pays {{a man called}} Hallam and some others of his kind who got up the company. Still, {{sometime}} and somehow, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> sorry he stole poor folks' money." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{the spirit}} of the age will allow {{immortality}} to any man of these days, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will.</b> But <b>I</b> doubt whether public opinion, as now existing, will admit of hero-worship." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you've succeeded so far," [...] Mr. Fentolin remarked. [...] "Here he is, {{and here}} <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> stay until some days after your friend from Scotland Yard can get here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'At first,' said Mark; 'but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> {{give way}} {{when he has}} had {{time to look at}} the matter, and sees how good you are. That will make all the difference.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{there is}} one who will never come. At least we will not see him if he does. But, oh, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> there--when our Canadian {{soldiers}} return {{there will be a}} shadow army with them--the army of the fallen. We will not see them--but they will be there!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'He {{talked to}} the horse {{and then went to}} sleep, and he was not at all shy with his aunt after the first. He watched the children, but had not begun to play with them. Still <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> quite happy with Lucy there, and I hope it will not be for long.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, that's flat," [...] said Higgs {{after he}} had departed, [...] "and for my part I am glad of it, for somehow <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> a useful man among those Fung. Also, if he went I expect that the Sergeant would go too, and where should we be without Quick, I should like to know?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{the head}} of the house and claim my right," [...] he said and kissed her. [...] "Some day Jim will take my place and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> fill it well." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is so, Pharaoh," [...] I answered. [...] "Yet <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> conquer in {{this great}} war and that within two years you must be {{prepared}} to meet him face to face." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{was with}} Charles Westmacott {{on the lawn}} not very long ago. He seems very fond of her. He is not very bright, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> make her a good husband." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{always knew}} {{he was at the}} bottom of it," [...] Alice said decidedly. [...] "I always said it was Fred. But I hope, Frank, you or uncle don't mean to take any steps to get him into trouble. I hate him, you know, and always have; still, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> punished enough with the loss of the money he so wickedly tried to gain." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Father's letter? Oh, {{he tells}} {{me a great deal}} about his voyage, and all the funny creatures they get up with the dredge. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> sure {{to write a book about}} them, and make great discoveries. And now he is staying with Aunt Phyllis in New Zealand, and he is thinking, poor father, how well off I must be with Aunt Lilias. He little knows!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You mean," [...] said Claverhouse, {{looking at}} a {{memorandum}} book, [...] "one Hatherick--Hedderick--or--or--Headrigg. Ay, Cuthbert, or Cuddie Headrigg--here I have him. O, never fear him, if he will be but tractable. The ladies of Tillietudlem made interest with me on his account some time ago. He is to marry their waiting-maid, <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> <b>He</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> allowed to slip off easy, unless his obstinacy spoils his good fortune." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{has taken}} {{them for a}} year, monsieur. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> take them permanently. I hope so, for he gives no trouble, {{and has never been}} out late once since he came here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{like him}} very much," [...] M. du Tillet said; [...] "he {{is a new}} type to me, and a {{pleasant}} one. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> make a good companion for the young count." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The police {{should be}} notified. Chief Farnum is a clever officer and {{intensely}} patriotic, from all I have heard. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> have no difficulty in discovering {{who is responsible}} for these circulars." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, my dear; <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> {{much more}} likely to regard, not only that, but most other things, with the eyes of another person. We will now talk of more {{agreeable}} things, however; for I confess, when I do dwell on titles, I have a taste for the more princely appellations; and that a simple chevalier can scarce excite a feeling that such is the theme." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, but I {{paid him}} off {{for it in}} the hall, as you {{yourself}} saw.--I was never in better fence in my life, Joceline. That same steward fellow is not so utterly black-hearted a rogue as the most of them, Joceline. He fences well--excellent well. I will have thee try a bout in the hall with him to-morrow, though <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> too hard for thee. I know thy strength to an inch." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{ventured to}} invite another {{to enjoy the}} dinner with us," [...] {{continued}} Buster Bear. Mr. Toad's face fell. You see he was selfish. He {{wanted to be the}} only one to have the honor of dining with Buster Bear. [...] "He's a little late," [...] went on Buster, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> here soon, and I hope you will be glad to meet him. Ah, there he comes now!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'My dear, {{you must}} not call this queer. Mr. White is very much {{attached}} to your aunt Ada, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> make her very happy, and give her great opportunities of doing good.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "None whatever. Indeed, {{this is so}} {{well-known}} to Baderoon that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> {{abandon the}} attempt. But <b>he</b> <b>will</b> not abandon his designs on me. However, we must wait and see how God will order events." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will.</b> <b>He</b> couldn't {{very well}} come the next night. But {{he has the}} habit of coming, and with Mr. Beaton habit is everything--even the habit of {{thinking}} he's in love with some one." ...|$|R
