40|$|The fine {{chemicals}} and pharmaceuticals industry needs to innovate to beat international competition and resolve environmental issues. Process intensification by flow chemistry {{is the most}} promising route for this change, as it can reduce raw material and energy consumption, waste production, lead time and time-to-market. However, {{the sheer number of}} new technologies that are considered, appears to hinder its progress. Dutch contract research organization TNO has constructed a tool that can help in selecting new technologies, ensuring that only a few new technologies will have to be implemented. This tool can be used for detailing the existing roadmap, aiming to accelerate the implementation of flow chemistry in the <b>fine</b> <b>chemicals</b> <b>sector...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of efficient routes to nitrogen-containing molecules from olefin feedstocks is {{of paramount importance}} to the life science, bulk <b>chemical</b> and <b>fine</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>sectors.</b> The hydroamination reaction, the addition of an N-H bond across an unsaturated C-C bond, is therefore one of the simplest and most desirable transformation for which no general solution exists. This thesis describes the {{development of}} conceptually new metal-free intermolecular hydroamination methods designed to address key limitations in this field. The first part of the thesis describes the use of photoinduced strain-release activation to enable 1, 4 -additions and hydroamination reactions of azoles with cyclolkenones and cycloalkenes, respectively. This {{is the first time that}} nitrogen nucleophiles more basic than aniline have undergone an efficient acid-catalyzed hydroamination reaction with unactivated alkenes. The second part of this work describes the development of thermal intermolecular hydroamination reactions of hydroxylamines with strained alkenes, terminal vinylarenes, alkynes and allenes. These transformations give cheap one-step access to nitrogen-containing compounds such as N-alkylhydroxylamines, | N,N-dialkylhydroxylamines, oximes and ketonitrones. Analogous reactivity of hydrazines with alkynes gives hydrazones with complementary regioselectivity. Density functional theory studies shed light on the importance of the proton transfer step during the reaction. Taken together, these reactions are among the most operationally and conceptually simple hydroamination methods. The last section describes early work aimed at the development of an organocatalytic directed Cope-type hydroamination reaction, as well as a hydroamination/Cope-elimination tandem sequence designed to enable endergonic hydroamination reactions...|$|R
40|$|The {{crystalline}} {{solid state}} is invaluable {{to both the}} pharmaceutical and <b>fine</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>sectors.</b> The advantages primarily relate to reducibility criteria required during processing of stable solid state materials and delivering purification, which is inherently performed by the crystal growth process. A major challenge is achieving control through crystallising solids with the desired physico-chemical properties. If this can be achieved the crystalline solid is of great financial and practical benefit. One emerging methodology for manipulating the solid crystalline form is the application of co-crystals. This work relates to key steps {{in the understanding of}} rational design of co-crystals utilizing crystal engineering concepts to determine systems before then applying screening criteria to the selected sub-set. Co-crystal screening is routinely undertaken using high-throughput solution growth. We report a low- to medium-throughput approach, encompassing both a melt and solution crystallization step as a route to the identification of co-crystals. Prior to solution studies, a melt growth step was included utilizing the Kofler mixed fusion method. This method allowed elucidation of the thermodynamic landscape within the binary phase diagram and was found to increase overall screening efficiency. This led to the discovery of a number of co-crystal systems with the co-former nicotinamide, with the single crystal structures determined for the following systems; R/S ibuprofen: nicotinamide, S ibuprofen: nicotinamide, R/S flurbiprofen: nicotinamide and salicylic acid: nicotinamide. To assess the crystallization and phase behaviours of determined co-crystals the R/S ibuprofennicotinamide system was selected and successful studies were undertaken determining the aqueous ternary phase behavior and the pre-nucleation speciation in methanol. There have, as yet, been a limited number of published examples which are concerned with pharmaceutical property enhancement by co-crystals, as vast proportion of the literature concerns the growth and isolation of these novel phases. To elucidate further the pharmaceutical relevance of co-crystals the properties of the R/S ibuprofen- nicotinamide system were then assessed showing a positive profile for this material.

30|$|Textile and dyeing {{industries}} produces huge polluted {{waste water}} and drains into natural water shade, canals, rivers and lagoons etc. The dyes are pollutants of high environmental impact, {{because of their}} widespread use and their potential to toxic aromatic amines accounting approximately 50  % of worldwide production (Guettai and Amar 2005; Rys and Zollinger 1992). About 20  % of synthetic dyes are lost in the waste water stream that is also important source of pollution (Zollinger 1991). Due {{to the release of}} dyes in aquatic ecosystem a dramatic consequences caused through the toxicity, aesthetic pollution and perturbations in aquatic life. Since the modern dyes are stable in aquatic system, biological treatments for eradication of textile and dyeing effluents are ineffective (Dai et al. 1995, 1996; Chung et al. 1981). Activated carbon derived from alkali treated rice husk indicated good adsorption capacity for methylene blue in aqueous solutions (Lin et al. 2013), and for nitrogen adsorption/desorption (Liu et al. 2016). Activated carbon has several important usages including solution purification, removal of tastes and odors from domestic and industrial water supplies, vegetable and animal fats and oils, alcoholic beverages, chemicals and pharmaceuticals and in the waste water treatment. It is a versatile product with good market demand. The non-availability of high quality activated carbon in the Bangladesh market, to cater {{to the needs of the}} pharmaceutical and <b>fine</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>sector</b> has necessitated imports into Bangladesh. Despite its prolific use of activated carbons in water and wastewater industries, commercial activated carbons remain an expensive material. This has led to a search for low-cost, easily available materials as alternative adsorbent materials. Proper utilization of agro industrial by-product is very much important for economy of a nation. A wide variety of carbons have been prepared from agricultural waste such as coconut shells (Laine et al. 1989), cotton stalk (Grigis and Ishak 1999), sugarcane bagasse (Ahmedna et al. 2000), coir pith (Kadirvelu et al. 2003), straw (Namila and Mungoor 1993), rice husk (Lin et al. 2013; Liu et al. 2016). Each adsorbent has its drawbacks and advantages. Previous study reported that significant changes observed in activated carbon with gradually increased in activation temperature ranging from 600 to 800  °C (Lin et al. 2013).|$|R
40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{linkages between}} trade and {{innovation in the}} <b>chemicals</b> <b>sector,</b> building on past work at the OECD on trade and innovation. The <b>chemicals</b> <b>sector</b> {{has a long history}} of innovation and is a large trading item. It covers very diverse sub-sectors. This paper analyses and compares different trade and innovation linkages in basic industrial <b>chemicals,</b> speciality and <b>fine</b> <b>chemicals</b> and consumer <b>chemicals.</b> This <b>sector</b> has also been a subject of successive rounds of multilateral trade negotiations, and partly as a consequence tariff rates have been reduced over time. Nonetheless remaining tariffs are still non-negligible and constitute impediments to trade. Export restrictive measures on raw material inputs are also being highlighted on the trade negotiating agenda. Moreover, the <b>chemicals</b> <b>sector</b> is heavily regulated for health and environmental reasons and further legislative initiatives have been pursued, whose practical impact on innovation remains to be seen. Intellectual property has played a very important role in technology diffusion in this sector, and infringement of intellectual property continues to be a major problem. innovation, intellectual property, technical barriers to trade, emerging economies, financial crisis, Chemicals Tariff Harmonization Agreement, environmental regulations, chemicals, multilateral trade negotiations, export restrictive measures...|$|R

40|$|Due {{to their}} {{selectivity}} and specificity, catalysts {{can help to}} save energy by lowering the activation energy, to save resources and above all to prevent waste. There {{are assumed to be}} significant effects especially in the domain of <b>fine</b> <b>chemicals.</b> Typical products are pharmaceutical chemicals, pesticides, biocides, organic pigments etc. Because of their usually complex synthesis involving several reaction stages and the enantiomorphous purity, which is being demand to an increasing degree, of chiral substances occurring as racemate, large amounts of unwanted by-products are formed which may exceed the production volume of the actually desired substance by many times. The amount of waste produced will grow in correlation to the annual growth rates estimated, especially for <b>fine</b> <b>chemicals,</b> if production methods remain the same. Against this background, the question is put as to what extent advanced, highly selective catalyst systems can contribute to improving the environmental compatibility of <b>fine</b> <b>chemical</b> production processes. Within this project, after the term 'fine chemicals' was clarified, an inventory of possible catalyst systems is given. Through interviews with experts, a technical discussion which took place in September 2002 and a written questionnaire sent to specialists in April/May 2003, the expected waste reduction potential was determined for different types of reaction and <b>chemical</b> <b>sectors.</b> Based on this information, the potential for waste reduction was estimated: the amount of waste avoided equals at least 14 % of the total waste in the organic chemical industry. Recommendations are derived for how this potential can be realised, e. g. through promotions, removal of obstacles and targeting sectors with particularly high saving potentials. (orig.)
