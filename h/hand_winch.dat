5000|$|WOMBAT {{recoilless}} rifle early models carried this armament internally, using ramps and a <b>hand</b> <b>winch</b> to deploy and recover the weapon. Later models mounted it externally above the rear hatch. In this arrangement the weapon had limited-traverse (30° lateral, +7.5° −3° elevation), {{but it could}} also be demounted as in the earlier arrangement.|$|E
50|$|The boat {{is caught}} {{at an angle}} by the regular current and floats across the river. As the ferry {{approaches}} the riverbank, the ferryman cranks a <b>hand</b> <b>winch</b> to retract the cable at the boat's stern. With a few jabs of the ferryman's pole at the trip's end, the ferry slips onto its landing.|$|E
50|$|Acting as gantry, {{the lifting}} frame {{included}} {{a number of}} work platforms from which crewmen serviced the rocket. Three (later two) platforms folded flat against the lifting frame, and could be folded out from the elevated lifting frame {{with the use of}} a <b>hand</b> <b>winch.</b> Each folding platform included a safety rail of folding posts and chains.|$|E
50|$|There are {{a number}} of {{floating}} versions of the Mabey LSB in use across Iraq: Floating Piers which consist of steel Flexifloat pontoon units, Landing Piers consisting of 16 pontoon units, and Intermediate Piers which consist of 8 pontoons each. <b>Hand</b> <b>winches</b> are mounted on steel trays which are bolted to the pontoons. The anchors are connected to the <b>hand</b> <b>winches</b> and pontoons via steel chain and polypropylene ropes. Special span junction decks allow for the rotation of the floating spans as the spans deflect under live load.|$|R
50|$|Manual hoists, or <b>hand</b> <b>winches,</b> are {{typically}} {{composed of a}} drum, gear box, and crank (operating handle). A worm gear is commonly used to provide mechanical advantage as the crank is turned, which coils a single line around a smooth or helically-grooved drum. The drum line {{is connected to the}} lift lines with a clew, triangular plate with holes used for line terminations. From the clew, the lift lines run over a head block and loft blocks down to a batten. The clew may be wire-guided to limit lateral play. Drill-operable <b>hand</b> <b>winches</b> permit the handle to be removed so that an electric drill may operate the hoist.|$|R
50|$|After the Meillerwagen {{was close}} to the launch point, the Firing Platoon Truck Section took charge and removed the rockets {{camouflage}} cover and rudder protection. The control compartment batteries, alcohol-filling connection, tools, and other equipment were loaded into a box on a strut {{at the top of the}} Meillerwagens lift frame. The Meillerwagen was moved via <b>hand</b> <b>winches</b> to the firing stand and then levelled via the two extendable outriggers with end-jacks.|$|R
50|$|In 1954 the Devils Well was {{explored}} by the brothers Bill and Bob Wallace, using a bosun's chair attached by a steel cable to a <b>hand</b> <b>winch.</b> The {{distance from the}} entrance {{to the surface of the}} lake is a vertical drop of approximately 100 feet. The brothers measured the chamber containing the lake and found it to be 400 feet long and 100 feet wide. The cave also features several waterfalls of various heights.|$|E
50|$|The current {{ferry boat}} is {{constructed}} principally of wood, and {{was built in}} 1946. The hull is 10.7 m long and 5.1 m wide, with 4.95 m long landing ramps at each end. The engine house is cantilevered approximately 1.1 m out to the side. Because {{of the variation in}} the water level in Lake Hume, the ferry operates between floating landing stages which are attached to each bank. The position of the landing stages is adjusted by <b>hand</b> <b>winch</b> to suit the level of the water.|$|E
50|$|The {{bridge was}} 19 ft wide and built on {{reinforced}} concrete piles, mostly sunk {{down to a}} solid rock foundation. The superstructure was built from ironbark and spotted gum. The pedestrian crossing was 4 ft wide and the road crossing was 13 ft, sufficient for two cars to pass. The bridge rose in the middle to allow small boats to pass under it; a central span could be raised and lowered using a <b>hand</b> <b>winch</b> to allow larger vessels to pass, but the process took 25 minutes. The bridge cost approximately £23,000.|$|E
50|$|The shells, and the charges, in silk bags, for {{the main}} guns, were stored here, as was the {{ammunition}} for the other guns of the ship. These were passed through openings in the deck, leading up into the gun turret. Seamen in this room could rotate the turret above them initially using <b>hand</b> <b>winches.</b> Later on, the gun turret was driven by an auxiliary steam engine. Altogether 9-10 people worked in here.|$|R
5000|$|In a deck-level overview, from bow to stern, the LBK had a blunt rounded prow {{directly}} behind which stood two <b>hand</b> <b>winches</b> and just further aft a hatch to the under-deck level. Within 20’ the hull had achieved its full width of 21’ The foremost {{section of the}} deckhouse contained the 17’6” servery area (approximately 16’ width), where the cooked food was portioned into containers for distribution. The middle section of the deckhouse was the 25’ the galley (approximately 16’ width). Accommodation for the one officer aft, over the engines. At deck level aft was the steering shelter which, along with the various fuel tanks, was provided with 2.5" [...] plastic armour.|$|R

50|$|Portland {{had a large}} {{history of}} {{smuggling}}, and Church Ope Cove {{was one of the}} famous smuggling beaches. Into the 20th-century, fishing was still an industry that used the beach for the launching of boats. For decades, an old rusting <b>hand</b> <b>winch</b> has been left lying on the beach, and is a reminder of the fishing trade. As part of the anti-invasion measures during World War II, two pillboxes were constructed to look over Church Ope Cove. A minefield was also placed {{at the back of the}} cove.|$|E
5000|$|The castle is {{patterned}} after a tower that Stokes {{had seen and}} admired in the Roman Campagna in Italy. The castle is built of hand-hewn native granite, and the huge stones were hoisted into place with a <b>hand</b> <b>winch</b> and held in place with rock wedging and clay mortar. [...] The kitchen and dining room were on the first floor, while the second floor contained {{the living room and}} the third floor housed two bedrooms. [...] Each of the floors had a fireplace, and the second and third floors each had a balcony. The roof had a battlemented terrace.|$|E
50|$|The packing (gangue {{material}} {{used for}} filling) {{from the upper}} main gangways {{was placed in the}} exhausted cavities (the so-called 'old man' or Alter Mann). This required the erection of a wooden ceiling over the active workings so that packing material did not fall into it and onto the face workers there. If the expected supply of ore or its quality did not justify sinking the main shaft deeper, or if the workings were a long way from it, draw-shafts were sunk. These blind shafts saved having to pack the 'old man'. In the Hornstatt, 1 or 2 labourers (Knechte) worked a <b>hand</b> <b>winch</b> and lifted the ore to the next highest main gallery.|$|E
50|$|A come-a-long (comealong, come-along, power puller) is a <b>hand</b> {{operated}} <b>winch</b> with {{a ratchet}} used to pull objects. The drum is wrapped with wire rope. A similar tool {{that uses a}} nylon strap is used to straighten trees in Texas, as it straightens gradually over time, therefore not splitting the trunk.|$|R
50|$|Fri {{was built}} for sail alone; she is a Baltic coastal trader {{constructed}} out of oak in 1912 in Svendborg Denmark. She is 32 meters long with a gaff rig, <b>hand</b> <b>winches,</b> and traditional ropes and canvas sails. In 1969 she carried 60 tons of cargo on an historic passage between Northern Europe and San Francisco. In 1970 she carried fresh water to the American Indian activists who had seized and occupied Alcatraz Island from the Government. In 1971 under her new owners American David Moodie and his brothers, the Fri sailed from Hawaii to New Zealand crewed {{by a group of}} hippie consumer escapes, in search of adventure and an alternative lifestyle down-under. This epic voyage to New Zealand would result in the vessel and its owners carving their name in New Zealand peace history.|$|R
50|$|The overall {{dimensions}} of the RCL were 52 ft bow to stern, and 18 ft beam. The cargo well (or tank deck) was 35 ft long. The bow ramp was lowered and raised by two <b>hand</b> <b>winches.</b> The ramp was built of plywood faced with steel and hinged to steel receiving plates on the bow. The framework of the RCL was constructed of appropriate Canadian timbers {{and covered with a}} seven-ply marine plywood, Sylvaply weather-board. The craft weighed 25 tons, and had a carrying capacity of 35 tons It was designed to carry ordnance and troops, as well as do general lighterage work where dock facilities were not available. They were capable of carrying tanks, troops, and loaded trucks ashore in very shallow water. Watertight compartments in the hull construction enabled these boats to take a great deal of punishment without losing buoyancy.|$|R
50|$|Unfortunately, {{with only}} 16 KiBytes of core store, the Minisystem and Fortran {{compiler}} would not both fit in memory together, {{so the next}} stage would be to load the Fortran compiler tape (which was stored in another cardboard box on the shelf in the computer room). Whilst this was being read in, and spilling out the other side, the newly punched source tape could be torn off from the free end that was protruding out of the punch, and wound up using the <b>hand</b> <b>winch.</b> It would be loaded into the tape reader once the compiler had finished being read in, and the compiler tape would be wound back into a tidy reel.|$|E
50|$|After {{unsuccessful}} {{attempts in}} 1974 and 1978, {{the first time}} Everest was climbed via the Lho La was in 1979 when a Yugoslavian team ascended the West Ridge from there (without diverting onto the Hornbein Couloir). Led by Tone Skarja, a team of 40 put fixed ropes up from 5350 m on the Khumbu Glacier and used a <b>hand</b> <b>winch</b> for 200 metres to lift 6 tons of equipment. They assessed the climbing grade as between II and III, and on the upper 150 m as between IV and V, claiming {{this to be the}} highest grade V climb in the world. In 1989 six climbers in a Polish team, attempting a descent that involved climbing Khumbutse from the West Rongbuk Glacier via Lho La, were swept to their deaths on the Lho La itself as they climbed above the col.|$|E
50|$|At {{the height}} of its {{popularity}} in the late 19th century, there were three lake steamers, and visitors arrived by trains from Manchester, Leeds and Bradford. The rowing club folded after a few years, and the clubhouse {{was used by the}} Lake Hotel for refreshments but the club reformed in 1872 and is still active. Fishing developed after 30,000 fish, mostly bream, dace and perch were introduced in 1863. A variety of stalls and lock-up shops, many close to the landing stage for the ferry, were soon trading in sweets, snacks and souvenirs, and on special holidays, there were fortune tellers, conjurers and tricksters. Although photography was in its infancy there were six businesses listed in Davenport's Guide as taking photographic portraits of visitors. Other attractions included a camera obscura, a stereoscopic exhibition, and a gymnasium, which was attached to the Beach Hotel. A roundabout with galloping horses, powered successively by a <b>hand</b> <b>winch,</b> a steam engine, a gas engine and finally electricity, remained at the lake until after the Second World War.|$|E
60|$|The {{telegraph}} clanged, {{the engines}} panted, and the Rio Negro {{began to shake}} as the screw revolved. There was no movement but the racking throb, until Mayne raised his <b>hand</b> and <b>winch</b> and windlass rattled. Puffs of steam blew about, the cable rose from {{the water with a}} jar, and the warps ran slowly across the winch-drums, foul with greasy scum.|$|R
50|$|A new tram depot {{was built}} as the {{original}} depot site was sold in June 1972. The City of Ballarat provided land in the South Gardens Reserve. Six Ballarat trams which had been stored in the old depot had to be towed around Lake Wendouree to the new site. An access track was laid and the trams were <b>hand</b> <b>winched</b> into the new shed. In July 1974 a new substation was built to supply DC current to the trams. On 12 October 1974, Tram No. 27 {{was able to make}} several trips along the access track. During November and December 1974 a track was laid to join the new depot to existing tram tracks in Wendouree Parade. This was quite a complex operation as the rails had to be bent to a curve by the Melbourne & Metropolitan Tramways Board's South Melbourne workshops and transported to Ballarat. Wendouree Parade had to be dug up and the new track laid.|$|R

40|$|A mobile {{storage unit}} (MSU) is {{generally}} deployed {{in an emergency}} situation. Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) use these tent structures for temporary storage of food and non-food items during the relief and recovery phase of the emergency situation. However, according to these NGOs, the currently used MSUs {{do not meet the}} technical and functional requirements. The complexity of their structure causes assembly, transport and packaging problems. The MSU cannot be deployed on rocky and/or unlevelled surfaces, which limits the range of deployment areas. Assembly in height is necessary to connect the structural members of the main structure, which may result in unsafe situations. Sometimes the MSU is used for other purposes than storage, but the currently used MSUs do not provide the option to add secondary structures. The objective of this thesis is to design a new MSU which is an improvement of the currently used models. A morphological method which contains all parameters related to the problems is applied to design a final concept. First, multiple concepts are roughly generated, based on the requirements posed by the boundary conditions derived from a literature study. The most potentially suited concepts are selected and roughly analysed against the boundary conditions. On the selected concepts, the folding portal and the erection method of the cable structures are assessed, as the features with the highest potential to affect the erection of the MSU to be designed. These features form the basic concept for further engineering. The MSU has to withstand wind speeds of 20 m/s and 31 m/s. One model is designed in variants for two wind speeds, MSU 20 and MSU 31. Both are largely identical, but differ much in transport requirements and weight. The MSU 20 takes half as much space as the MSU 31. The geometry of the final design shows strong similarities with the currently used MSUs. All are portal structures with a saddle-shaped roof. The main differences between the MSUs are in the structure, assembly, erection, transport requirements and functionality. The main structure is prefabricated and modular, therefore fewer actions are required to assemble the MSU, and also less time. The use of a cable structure allows to assemble and erect the MSU from ground level. This enlarges the deployment range of the MSU to rocky ground as well as unlevelled surfaces. The dimensions of the MSU packages are reduced, making it possible to transport the MSUs transversally in a 20 -ft sea container. At the cross-section, extra channels ensure that add-ons, such as inner-walls, overhangs and shade nets can be fitted. A large part of this study was dedicated to the erection method of the MSU. The final method is determined, but the <b>hand</b> <b>winch</b> should be further optimised and tested to improve its performance. In conclusion, compared to the currently used MSUs, the newly designed MSU is a safer, faster to assemble, less complex, and more largely deployable concept in terms of structure.

5000|$|Old Indiantown Road - Within Timer Powers Park, {{you will}} find a {{historical}} marker sign that details Jupiter Indiantown Road as it existed from the 1900s until the late 1950s. Inscription from the sign: From 1900 until the late 1950s, the Jupiter Indiantown Road connected the communities of Jupiter and Indiantown, giving residents access to resources. Dade County governed the area in 1899, when the new road was cut. In Indiantown about that time, brothers Joe and Dessie Bowers developed citrus groves and ran a trading post exchanging goods for hides with the Seminoles. Transportation of goods on the 16-mile road took two days by oxcart. The road was improved in 1912 using mules to haul shell rock from Jupiter. Around 1916 the St. Lucie Canal intersected the road near Indiantown. A <b>hand</b> <b>winched</b> ferry provided cross passage until a one-lane turning bridge was built in 1927. Homesteads, cattle ranches, and later the Davis and Jenkins sawmill were established along the road. Also known as the Jupiter Grade Road, the Jupiter Okeechobee Road and the Central Dixie Highway, in 1936 it became State Road 29. By the late 1950s nearby paved highways replaced the historic dirt road. In 1993 the road was declared a Scenic By-Way by Martin and Palm Beach Counties.

50|$|To {{begin with}} the ore was chiselled free and carted {{to the surface of}} the open pits or shallow mines in baskets. Once shaft depths {{increased}} to between about 10-60 metres <b>hand</b> <b>winches</b> (Handhäspel) were used, operated by one or two workers (Knechten). The crude ore was placed in wooden buckets for transportation. For the rather short, horizontal gangways leading to the shaft the ore was carried in Trogs for several centuries (long before the introduction of blasting). In the 17th century the shafts reached depths of between 100 and 200 m. Ore could no longer be removed by hand and horsepower was increasingly used. The horses worked in a cone-shaped building, the Göpel or Gaipel, which housed a horse whim, a winch that was driven by the horses walking in a circle. The hauling cable (made of natural fibre) or cast-iron chain was wound up and down over a vertical axle. The cable was routed down the shaft and hauled barrels of ore up and down. Due to the shaft's incline, barrels were covered with iron runners on one side, resting partly on the side of the shaft. Above ground at the pithead the ore was emptied out and transported away by horse and cart for processing. From the 18th century shaft depths of several hundred metres were being achieved and horse whims were reaching the limits of their capability. Where the mines were lucrative and their energy consumption high as a result of shaft depth or the ingress of water, water power had been used since the 16th century. Water wheels (Kunsträder) drove piston pumps in order to keep the mine dewatered (zu Sumpfe). Reversible water wheels (Kehrräder) powered the transportation of ore or winnings. Depending on the terrain conditions the reversible wheels were located either in underground wheel houses (Radstuben) near the shaft (the cable drum being set on the same axle as the water wheel) or above ground in the valley. When using the latter method the wheel's rotation was converted into reciprocating motion using a crank mechanism (Krummen Zapfen) and transmitted over twin flat rods, several hundred metres long, to the shaft. Here, reciprocating motion was re-converted into rotary motion.|$|R
