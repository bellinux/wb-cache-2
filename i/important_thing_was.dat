5|$|Like many {{scientists}} {{working on the}} project, Woods affected a casual attitude towards the danger posed by radiation. After a morning with Willard Libby soldering a canister containing a mixture of radium salt and beryllium metal, Woods absorbed about 200 roentgens, and her {{white blood cell count}} halved. The doctors gave her a lecture on how a woman has only a fixed number of egg cells, a proposition that Woods was skeptical of. She considered that the <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> that the solder was done correctly. When the team moved to their new home at Argonne, Woods had a dormitory all to herself.|$|E

Although the mainland Chinese were invited by the Munich Olympic organizers to send an observer delegation to Munich (they declined due to the Taiwanese presence), {{it was not until}} 1975, after Brundage's departure as president, that the PRC applied to rejoin the Olympic movement. The PRC again participated at the 1980 Winter Games at Lake Placid and then the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles; the island NOC competed as the Republic of China in 1968 and 1972; when refused permission to compete under that name in 1976, after Brundage's death, it boycotted the 1976 and 1980 games, returning in 1984 as Chinese Taipei.|$|E

500|$|On arrival, Navarre {{was shocked}} by what he found. There had been no {{long-range}} plan since de Lattre's departure. Everything was conducted on a day-to-day, reactive basis. Combat operations were undertaken only in response to enemy moves or threats. There was no comprehensive plan to develop the organization and build up the equipment of the Expeditionary force. Finally, Navarre, the intellectual, the cold and professional soldier, {{was shocked by}} the [...] "school's out" [...] attitude of Salan and his senior commanders and staff officers. They were going home, not as victors or heroes, but then, not as clear losers either. To them the <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> that they were getting out of Indochina with their reputations frayed, but intact.

By December 27, 2010, Owumi had signed a lucrative deal with Al-Nasr, a team from Benghazi that played in the top Libyan league, and was arriving in the country. Despite fears of the country's instability {{in the midst of}} the budding Arab Spring and discouragement from his girlfriend Alexis Jones, he chose to remain with the team, prompted by the poor conditions in Macedonia. He later said, [...] "The most <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> to get out of the bad situation I was in, and once I had the opportunity to get some place better to play basketball, that's all I really cared about.

For players who have never played Super Metroid, IGN claims that they owe themselves as gamers to [...] "finally find out about what you've been missing all these years". In his review for GameSpot, Frank Provo found it [...] "absolutely astonishing that Nintendo let 13 years go by before making Super Metroid readily available again", but considered the most <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> that players [...] "can now play this masterpiece without having to track down the original Super Nintendo Entertainment System cartridge or fumble with legally questionable emulators". Despite admitting that the Virtual Console version was essentially [...] "nothing more than a no-frills, emulated version of a 13-year-old SNES game" [...] that was no longer cutting-edge, he was still pleased with it and reiterated his belief that Super Metroid is [...] "one of the best 2D action adventure games ever produced".|$|E

Scott's concept for the plot was [...] "to go back to where the alien creatures were first found and explain how they were created", which became the basis of his prequel series. In late 2008, Weaver hinted in an interview with MTV that she and Scott were working on an Alien spinoff film, which would focus on the chronicles of Ellen Ripley rather than on the Aliens, but the continuation of Ripley's story has not materialized. Instead, Scott worked on a prequel that explained the [...] "Space Jockey" [...] found on the derelict spacecraft from Alien, titled Prometheus, which was released in June 8, 2012. Scott and Damon Lindelof developed a story that precedes the story of Alien but is not directly connected to that franchise. According to Scott, although the film shares [...] "strands of Alien's DNA so to speak", and takes place in the same universe, Prometheus explores its own mythology and ideas. A sequel to Prometheus, titled , was released in May 19, 2017.|$|E

And he said that {{if he was going to}} be involved, he wanted me to be involved, too." [...] In September 2014, Lennertz officially signed on to compose for the series. Lennertz combined all the different style elements of the show in the music, such as mixing jazz and period elements, with orchestra and electronic elements. Lennertz said, the music is [...] "always done from a sense of being sort of in control and savvy and clever, rather than just being strong or just having a superpower or sort of being so much further along than anybody else physically.

500|$|In {{the second}} round, Washington was matched {{up with the}} top-seeded New York Rangers. After losing Game 1 by giving up two goals in a 1:30 span, Washington took a 2–0 lead in Game 2, {{only to have the}} Rangers come back and tie the score in the third period. The Capitals, however, won the game on an Ovechkin power-play goal late in the third. Game 3 was a triple-overtime contest that ended when Marian Gaborik scored to give New York a 2–1 win. The 114:41 game was the 20th longest game in NHL history, and Washington's third-longest game in {{franchise}} history. Washington evened the series in Game 4 with a one-goal win. In the win, Ovechkin was benched {{for the majority of the}} third period, where after the tilt, he noted that the most <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> that the Capitals won the game. Washington looked to be heading for their first series lead as Game 5 was coming to an end. The Capitals were leading 2–1 with 21.3 seconds remaining when Joel Ward took a double minor penalty for high-sticking. On the ensuing power play, Brad Richards scored with 6.6 seconds left in regulation to tie the game. The Rangers remained on the power play to start the overtime period, with Ward serving the second half of his double minor when Marc Staal scored to give New York the win. Facing elimination in Game 6, Washington took the lead 1:28 into the game on an Ovechkin power play tally. They did not trail in the game and won 2–1 to force Game 7. Ovechkin's goal was the 30th of his post-season career, which tied him for the Capitals all-time franchise record with Peter Bondra. In the deciding game, Brad Richards scored 1:32 into the first period helping New York to the eventual 2–1 victory and the series win. Holtby finished the playoffs with a 1.95 goals against average, a [...]935 save percentage and was praised for his [...] "breakout" [...] performance while being credited with giving the Capitals a [...] "chance to win every game." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Dillinger Escape Plan {{announced}} their departure from Relapse Records in 2009.

You listen to every single song back to front a million times, it'd be worn out to death before you moved onto another record. You'd read everything in the booklet, you'd read all the lyrics, you'd read all the notes, you'd discover something new." [...] Speaking to Kerrang! about the decision, he said: [...] "The most <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> to keep evolving and changing.
