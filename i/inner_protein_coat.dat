VP7 serves as a protein kinase, VP1 as an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, VP3 as a capping enzyme, and VP12 as a dsRNA-binding protein.|$|R
40|$|The spore coat of Dictyostelium {{is formed}} de novo from {{proteins}} secreted from vesicles and cellulose synthesized across the plasma membrane as differentiating spores rise up the stalk. The {{mechanism by which}} these events are coordinated is not understood. In the course of experiments designed to test {{the function of the}} <b>inner</b> layer <b>coat</b> <b>protein</b> SP 85 (PsB), expression of a specific partial length fragment was found to interrupt <b>coat</b> assembly after <b>protein</b> secretion and prior to cellulose synthesis in 85 % of the cells. This fragment consisted of SP 85 's N-terminal domain, containing prespore vesicle targeting information, and its Cys-rich C 1 domain. The effect of the NC 1 fusion was not cell autonomous in interstrain chimeras, suggesting that it acted at the cell surface. SP 85 -null spores presented an opposite phenotype in which spores differentiated prematurely before reaching the top of the stalk, and cellulose was slightly overproduced in a disorganized fashion. A similar though less severe phenotype occurred when a fusion of the N and C 2 domains was expressed. In a double mutant, absence of SP 85 was epistatic to NC 1 expression, suggesting that NC 1 inhibited SP 85 function. Together, these results suggest the existence of an outside-in signaling pathway that constitutes a checkpoint to ensure that cellulose synthesis does not occur until <b>coat</b> <b>proteins</b> are properly organized at the cell surface and stalk formation is complete. Checkpoint execution is proposed to be regulated by SP 85, which is in turn under the influence of other <b>coat</b> <b>proteins</b> that interact with SP 85 via its C 1 and C 2 domains...|$|R

We have previously shown that the <b>coat</b> <b>protein</b> of Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) and Tobacco necrosis virus strain DH (TNV-D[superscript H]) trigger HR in several species of Nicotiana, including Nicotiana langsdorffii. To identify structural features in the <b>coat</b> <b>protein</b> recognized by the host, we tested the capacity of eight <b>coat</b> <b>proteins</b> of the Tombusviridae to trigger a HR in N. langsdorffii.

Indeed, the <b>coat</b> <b>protein</b> has been found in tight association with the viral RNA polymerase (R. Quadt et al., 1991, Virology 182, 309 - 315). To investigate the role of the <b>coat</b> <b>protein,</b> if any, in viral RNA synthesis, we have isolated the viral RNA polymerase (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, RdRp) from mock-inoculated tobacco plants transformed with cDNAs 1 and 2, known as P 12 plants (P. E M Taschner et al., 1991, Virology 181, 687 - 693), which express the nonstructural proteins P 1 and P 2. Such an enzyme (called M-RdRp) will contain the viral subunits P 1 and P 2 but not the <b>coat</b> <b>protein.</b> As a comparison we also isolated the RdRp from virion-inoculated P 12 plants (C-RdRp). This enzyme will contain the <b>coat</b> <b>protein.</b> We found that both M-RdRp and CRdRp could synthesize minus RNA, showing that <b>coat</b> <b>protein</b> is not needed for minus-strand synthesis.
