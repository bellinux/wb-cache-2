40|$|This thesis {{presents}} algorithm {{development and}} analysis strategies for diesel engine systems incorporating variable valve actuation (VVA) {{as a means}} to enable premixed charge compression ignition (PCCI) and cylinder deactivation (CDA). The VVA system enables cylinder-independent, cycle-by-cycle control of the opening timing, closing timing, and lift for both the intake and exhaust valves. ^ PCCI is a low-temperature combustion strategy for reducing in-cylinder NOx and particulate matter (PM) formation without additional fuel penalty. This is achieved by allowing the injected diesel fuel and charge gas to premix before the mixture auto-ignites as a result of compression. This type of combustion tends to eliminate high temperature reaction zones and the fuel rich pockets which typically lead to formation of NOx and PM, respectively. However, one of the challenges in PCCI implementation is that the process does not allow direct control of the combustion timing. The crank angle of 50 % heat release, known as the CA 50, is generally a reasonable proxy for the quality of combustion in terms of maximum pressure rise rate, combustion noise, and fuel conversion efficiency. This thesis outlines the development, and validation, of a real-time capable estimation strategy for PCCI CA 50 using production-viable measurements that do not include in-cylinder pressure. The strategy is demonstrated to estimate CA 50 within 2 CAD for 65 out of 80 data points, and has an error standard deviation of 2. 55 CAD. ^ CDA is a technology that can improve the fuel economy and exhaust thermal management of compression ignition engines (diesel and natural gas), especially at low loads and engine idling conditions. At low loads, the reduction in engine displacement during CDA improves fuel efficiency primarily through a reduction in pumping work. However, with no combustion occuring in the deactivated cylinders, in-cylinder pressure drops, enabling the transport of engine lubricating oil from the crankcase into the deactivated cylinder, an undesirable result. As an example, during experiments described in this thesis, in-cylinder oil mass levels reach 72 mg to 488 mg following 20 minutes of deactivation. ^ Cylinder cool-down and oil accumulation during deactivation could possibly result in misfire or degraded combustion upon an attempt to reactivate a given cylinder. Fortunately, experiments described in this thesis demonstrate no cases of misfire at any speed/load conditions for the CDA durations tested, specifically, 100 ft-lb load at 800 rpm and 1200 rpm with deactivation intervals of 0. 5, 5, 10 and 20 minutes. Although pilot heat release in the reactivated cylinders was delayed by approximately 1 CAD after 5 minutes of CDA, the main heat release was very similar to the heat release of a continuously activated cylinder. As such, results show no first <b>fire</b> <b>readiness</b> issues at the conditions tested. The duration of time the engine could be operated in CDA mode without significant oil accumulation, and other methods to minimize oil accumulation during CDA have also been proposed. ...|$|E

The final test of 1959, Missile 40D on December 19, utilized a [...] "dry" [...] start method (engine igniter activated before propellant injection).

The PFRF (Pre Flight <b>Readiness</b> <b>Firing)</b> tests conducted on 4A and 6A also would have caused exhaust gases to go up into the boattail, and thus they probably already had internal damage at launch.|$|R

40|$|An {{analytical}} model {{was developed to}} provide additional insight {{and understanding of the}} factors that influence the simulation and prediction of leak rates from small cracks in pressurized containers. Specifically, the analysis was aimed at developing an {{analytical model}} capable of predicting the hydrogen leak rates from a crack in the combustion chamber coolant discharge manifold on main engine 1 of the Orbiter Challenger that was discovered during flight readiness firings 1 and 2. This model was based on viscous pipe flow analyses and calibrated for the crack geometry by using helium leak-rate data obtained from both low- and high-pressure tests used to simulate the flight <b>readiness</b> <b>firing</b> test conditions. In addition, this model includes the effects of crack width changes caused by different working stresses associated with the different test conditions. Because of the combination of the small crack dimensions and the wide range of pressures used for the test conditions, either laminar or turbulent viscous effects dominated the flows at all test conditions. This model was used to illustrate the sensitivity of the predicted leak rates to considerations of test conditions, viscous flow effects, and geometric features of the crack. In addition, the model was certified by comparing the hydrogen leak-rate prediction for the flight <b>readiness</b> <b>firing</b> test condition to the actual measured leak rate. The prediction was within 9 percent of the measured value...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Composite {{series of}} ENSO indices {{recorded}} over 36 months preceding major fire years in four National Parks in northern Patagonia {{were compared with}} series of these indices for individual years over the period 1950 – 1996 {{by means of an}} additive temporal phase coherence index. Logistic regressions of the dichotomous variable high vs low regional fire occurrence against the coherence index gained highest significant classificatory power using an index based on SST anomaly data between January of year – 3 to August of year – 1. Thus, warnings of extreme fire seasons could be declared as early as 3 months before the full fire season starts (i. e. early September). A regional <b>fire</b> season <b>readiness</b> index is proposed based on the periodicity of the Southern Oscillation, strong links with climate at particular regions of the globe, and empirically derived climatic controls on fine fuel buildup and coarse fuel desiccation. This long-range alerting tool could help decision-makers prepare preventative measures to mitigate the effects of large, high intensity wildfire seasons. However, it should be used with cautio...|$|R

50|$|The new orbiter was {{rolled out}} to LC-39A on a fog-shrouded morning in November 1982. On December 18, Challenger {{was given a}} PFRF (Pre Flight <b>Readiness</b> <b>Firing)</b> to verify the {{operation}} of the main engines. The PFRF lasted for 16 seconds. Although engine operation was generally satisfactory, telemetry data indicated significant leakage of liquid hydrogen in the thrust section. However, {{it was not possible to}} determine the location of the leak with certainty, so program directors decided on a second PFRF with added telemetry probes. It was known that during the test run on December 18, that recirculated exhaust gases and vibration leaked into the thrust section and this was considered a potential cause of the leak. Therefore the original planned launch in late January 1983 had to be postponed.|$|R

A powered flight analysis of the Shuttle is presented, touching upon the following areas: ascent profile and abort mode integration, sizing and design, control of load factor by a stage thrust shaping, structural load constraints, flight performance reserve and trajectory design for the orbital flight test. A discussion is presented of aerothermodynamics including aerodynamic and plume heating. Flight control and separation is considered with attention paid to liftoff, ascent to booster staging, elevon load relief, booster tailoff thrust mismatch and gimbal limitations and booster separation. Structural analysis and dynamics is examined, considering: vehicle loads and modes and the pogo effect. Propulsion aspects (hydraulics, the LH 2 recirculation system, the antigeyser system, the pressurization system, etc.), ground vibration tests, separation system verification and flight <b>readiness</b> <b>firing</b> are all described...|$|R

The launch preparations, including conduct of the Mission Verification Test, which comprises a Flight <b>Readiness</b> <b>Firing</b> prior to the actual launch, is discussed. This simulation was designed to test the readiness of the complete organization and all ground and flight equipment for commitment to the first manned orbital flight. The plan of the orbital flight program is outlined indicating how each succeeding flight is made more complex and severe to incrementally test the Space Shuttle. Completion of this four flight program readies the Space Shuttle for operations in late 1982. Payload performance to orbit is increased as the program progresses through the development flights and on into operations...|$|R
50|$|The Jupiter {{program was}} more {{successful}} also due to far better testing and preparation, for example, each missile {{was given a}} full duration static firing in Huntsville prior to delivery. A static firing stand for Thor tests was only opened in May 1958, {{at which point the}} missile's launch record stood at four successes and nine failures, including four pad explosions. For comparison, there had been only three Jupiter failures as May 1958 ended (only eight launches had taken place against Thor's thirteen) with no pad explosions. Thors were given a PFRF (Pre Flight <b>Readiness</b> <b>Firing)</b> prior to launch; these were between 5-15 seconds only as the launching facilities were not designed for a full duration firing as a static test stand was. Missile 107 had not been given a PFRF at all and its launch ended in a pad explosion.|$|R

Perhaps such words have rarely been uttered without that meaner ring in them; yet they are the implicit formula of all energetic belief.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} a test technique for revalidation of the Space Shuttle Orbiter Main Propulsion System during ground turnaround operations between flights of the Space Transportation System (STS). The Main Propulsion System consists of the three Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME's) and the Main Propulsion System (MPS) connecting the SSME's to the orbiter/ground and orbiter/External Tank (ET) interfaces. The Helium Signature Test (HST) performs an end-to-end leak check of the MPS/SSME subsystems that serves as a final validation of those systems for reuse. The test was initially developed during the ground processing flow prior to the STS- 6 launch of orbiter Challenger. The test was developed to fulfill a requirement for an overall subsystem leak check as a result of experience gained during the STS- 6 Challenger Flight <b>Readiness</b> <b>Firing</b> (FRF) series, during which leaks were encountered in the SSME's that were not detected by routine fluid joint leak checks. The HST technique is described in detail, including orbiter and test equipment configuration, and compared to other leak detection methods used to revalidate MPS/SSME systems for reuse. The HST data base accumulated since STS- 6 is summarized and future test applications are described...|$|R
40|$|Forests {{are always}} {{susceptible}} to being destroyed by fire or disease before their planned age for clearfelling. The value of trees {{at any age}} depends {{on the value of}} their current and future output to the time when they are either intentionally clearfelled, or accidentally destroyed. The value of timber, and of non-timber outputs such as water, wildlife habitat and recreation, typically depend on the age of the trees in different ways. Dynamic programming has been used to determine optimal cutting and fire protection strategies for independent forest stands. The aim {{of this paper is to}} consider and illustrate the feasibility of extending the approach to optimal integrated management of a forest consisting of interdependent stands of trees of different ages. Numerical solutions are obtained for an example application to a forest of multiple mountain ash stands in Victoria, where forests are prone to catastrophic loss from wildfire. The need for an integrated multistand approach for the management of timber production, recreation, wildlife habitat and water collection is discussed. Protection measures considered for increasing the survival probabilities of trees include networks of lookout towers for detection of <b>fires,</b> and increased <b>readiness</b> of manpower to intercept fires...|$|R
5000|$|A Navy {{investigation}} {{found that the}} [...] "entirely preventable" [...] fire had been caused by unauthorized smoking in a room where 115 gal of flammable refrigerant compressor oil was improperly stored. The room was near the aft auxiliary boiler. The ship's damage control team took nearly eight hours to discover {{the source of the}} smoke and flames. By that time, the fire had spread to eight decks and 80 compartments, and destroyed miles of electrical and fiber-optic cables. The damage control department had been found deficient in three inspections between June 2007 and April 2008. Although the carrier's commanding officer started a program to remedy the team's training and performance in the month before the fire, the report found those efforts to have been insufficient. Admiral Robert F. Willard, commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, noted in his investigation, [...] "It is apparent from this extensive study that there were numerous processes and procedures related to <b>fire</b> prevention and <b>readiness</b> and training that were not properly functioning.

5|$|Following the {{awarding}} of the contract, a preliminary design review {{was carried out in}} September 1972, followed by a critical design review in September 1976 after which the engine's design was set and construction of the first set of flight-capable engines began. Final review of all the Space Shuttle's components, including the engines, was conducted in 1979. The design reviews operated in parallel with several test milestones, initial tests consisting of individual engine components which identified shortcomings with various areas of the design, including the HPFTP, HPOTP, valves, nozzle and fuel preburners. The individual engine component tests were followed by the first test of a complete engine (0002) on March 16, 1977. NASA specified that, prior to the Shuttle's first flight, the engines must have undergone at least 65,000 seconds of testing, a milestone that was reached on March 23, 1980, with the engine having undergone 110,253 seconds of testing by the time of STS-1 both on test stands at Stennis Space Center and installed on the Main Propulsion Test Article (MPTA). The first set of engines (2005, 2006 and 2007) were delivered to Kennedy Space Center in 1979 and installed on , before being removed in 1980 for further testing and reinstalled on the orbiter. The engines, which were of the first manned orbital flight (FMOF) configuration and certified for operation at 100% rated power level (RPL), were operated in a twenty-second flight <b>readiness</b> <b>firing</b> on February 20, 1981, and, after inspection, declared ready for flight.|$|R
50|$|The Atlas D {{testing program}} {{began with the}} launch of Missile 3D from LC-13 on April 14, 1959. Engine startup {{proceeded}} normally, but it quickly {{became apparent that the}} LOX fill/drain valve had not closed properly. LOX spilled {{around the base of the}} thrust section, followed by leakage from the RP-1 fill/drain valve. The propellants then mixed and exploded on the launch stand. Because of the open LOX fill/drain valve, the Atlas's propellant system suffered a loss of fuel flow and pressure that caused the B-2 engine to operate at only 65% thrust. Due to the imbalanced thrust, the Atlas lifted at a slanted angle, which also prevented one of the launcher hold-down arms from retracting properly. Subsequent film review showed that no apparent damage to the missile resulted from either the launcher release or the propellant explosion. The flight control system managed to retain missile stability until T+26 seconds when unstable B-2 combustion from the loss of LOX resulted in an explosion that caused the booster section to rip away from the missile. The Atlas sank backwards through its own trail of fire until the Range Safety destruct command was issued at T+36 seconds. The sustainer and verniers continued operating until missile destruction. All other missile systems had functioned well during the brief flight and the LOX fill/drain valve malfunction was attributed to a breakdown of the butterfly acutator shaft, possibly during the Pre-Flight <b>Readiness</b> <b>Firing</b> a few weeks earlier, so Atlas vehicles starting with Missile 26D would use an acutator made of steel rather than aluminum. The leakage from the fuel fill/drain valve was traced to an improper procedure during the prelaunch countdown and was not connected to the LOX fill/drain valve problem. LC-13 sustained some damage due to the anomalous liftoff of Atlas 3D, this was quickly repaired and preparations began for the launch of Missile 5D.|$|R
