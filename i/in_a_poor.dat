5|$|As {{a member}} of the Joint Research and Development Committee with Spaatz, Devers took an {{interest}} in the development of helicopters, taking rides in different machines. He met with Larry Bell, the founder of Bell Aircraft. Bell's company was <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>poor</b> financial situation, and he was hoping that the Army would buy fifty of his new Bell 47 helicopters. Devers was impressed with the aircraft, and agreed to do so, although for $25,000 each rather than the $35,000 Bell was asking for, and found the money from Army Ground Forces funds. The Bell H-13 Sioux would go on {{to become one of the}} world's most recognizable helicopters.|$|E
5|$|As of 2005, the {{building}} still retained {{a number of}} original features, including its gold brocade seats, wall friezes, cornices, and ceiling roses. However, the fabric of {{the building}} remained <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>poor</b> state of repair, and in January 2008 it was announced once again that the building was to be demolished, and scaffolding was erected at the front in preparation. The building, once considered amongst the most iconic in Manchester, was not regarded as architecturally interesting, and was demolished in the spring of 2008. The pair of stone piers in the forecourt of the building, which were Grade II listed in 1998, remain.|$|E
5|$|By 1936 {{there was}} already a demand for reprints of Tintin in the Land of the Soviets, with Lesne sending a letter to Hergé enquiring if this was possible. The {{cartoonist}} was reluctant, stating that the original plates for the story were now <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>poor</b> condition and {{that as a result}} he would have to redraw the entire story were it to be re-published. Several years later, amid the German occupation of Belgium during World War II, a German-run publishing company asked Hergé for permission to republish Tintin in the Land of the Soviets, with the intent of using it as anti-Soviet propaganda, but again Hergé declined the offer.|$|E

5|$|By the 16th century Conisbrough Castle was <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>poor</b> {{state of}} repair, and a royal survey {{carried out in}} 1537 and 1538 showed that the gates, bridge {{and parts of the}} walls had {{collapsed}} in a spectacular land slippage, and that one floor of the keep had also fallen in. The collapse of the walls was a consequence of the instability of the topsoil on top of the limestone spur, which was a mixture of clay and sandstone; once the clay was washed away over time, the remaining sandstone proved extremely unstable and liable to crack.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1930s, Barrowclough was {{disenchanted with}} the state of New Zealand's {{military}} forces, which was in decline {{due to a lack of}} resources and the discontinuation of compulsory military training. In 1936, he encouraged the reformation of the National Defence League of New Zealand (NDL), a defence lobby group which aimed to encourage and revitalise New Zealand's defence preparations for war. The country's defence arrangements were <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>poor</b> state of affairs at the time but the NDL gained little traction with the Labour Government.|$|E

At a young age, Day became enamored with baseball, often playing local sandlot games or taking the long walk from his neighborhood to Maryland Ball Park where he watched the Baltimore Black Sox.|$|E

5|$|Five {{weeks after}} Suharto's birth, his mother {{suffered}} {{a nervous breakdown}} and he {{was placed in the}} care of his paternal great-aunt, Kromodirjo. Kertosudiro and Sukirah divorced early in Suharto's life and both later remarried. At the age of three, Suharto was returned to his mother, who had married a local farmer whom Suharto helped in the rice paddies. In 1929, Suharto's father took him to live with his sister, who was married to an agricultural supervisor, Prawirowihardjo, in the town of Wuryantoro <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>poor</b> and low-yielding farming area near Wonogiri. Over the following two years, he was taken back to his mother in Kemusuk by his stepfather and then back again to Wuryantoro by his father.|$|E
5|$|For Pellew, {{the victory}} was an {{encouraging}} {{sign of the}} weakness of the Dutch squadron. In October, Captain Peter Rainier seized another Dutch frigate from Batavia harbour itself and the following month Admiral Pellew led a large scale raid on the port that eliminated most of the Dutch East Indies squadron. Two ships of the line escaped Pellew's attack, but they were old and <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>poor</b> state of repair, and so were unable to defend themselves when Pellew discovered and destroyed them at Griessie in 1807.|$|E

50|$|It {{should be}} {{observed}} that while current CCD detectors allow very high image resolution, often this involves a trade-off because, {{for a given}} chip size, as the pixel count increases, the pixel size decreases. As the pixels get smaller, their well depth decreases, {{reducing the number of}} electrons that can be stored. In turn, this results <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>poorer</b> signal to noise ratio.|$|R

5|$|His horses raced at the Del Mar Racetrack, and he {{invested}} {{large sums}} of money in the hobby. Murphy had a gambling habit that left his finances <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>poor</b> state. In 1968 he stated that he lost $260,000 in an Algerian oil deal and was dealing with the Internal Revenue Service over unpaid taxes. In spite of his financial difficulties, Murphy refused to appear in commercials for alcohol and cigarettes, mindful of the influence he would have on the youth market.|$|E
5|$|Hobbs {{was born}} in Cambridge on 16 December 1882, the first of 12 {{children}} to John Cooper Hobbs, a slater, and his wife Flora Matilda Berry.

After his death in 1960 the estate passed through several hands. Despite the substantial royalties paid for performing Ravel's music, the news magazine Le Point reported in 2000 that it was unclear who the beneficiaries were.

5|$|Repairs {{were made}} to the castle between 1610 and 1611 by the captain, Sir George Bampfield, at a cost of £211. A survey in 1623 carried out by Sir Richard Morryson showed the castle to be {{equipped}} with ten iron guns – one culverin, five demi-culverins, two sakers, a minion and a falcon – and garrisoned by its captain, five gunners and three soldiers. It was <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>poor</b> condition, and one corner of the gun platform had been undermined by the sea; Morryson's team estimated the likely costs of repairs to amount to £459.|$|E
5|$|Still ruined, Bowes Castle was {{reclaimed}} by the Crown in 1361; between 1444 and 1471 it {{was controlled}} by the Neville family, powerful regional landowners, before reverting to the Crown once again. James I sold the castle in the early 17th century and the remaining fortifications were dismantled in the mid-17th century after the English Civil War. By 1928, the castle was <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>poor</b> condition, with little interest being shown in it from locals or its owner, Lady Lorna Curzon-Howe.

50|$|When I-10 {{was built}} through New Orleans, Louisiana, {{a segment of}} {{formerly}} tree-lined ground along Claiborne Avenue was destroyed to build the elevated highway; because Claiborne Avenue was the main thoroughfare <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>poorer,</b> African-American neighborhood, many in the community considered this to be racially prejudiced. While local efforts to stop this route of I-10 were unsuccessful, the disruption motivated residents to oppose further planned freeways through historic neighborhoods.|$|R
