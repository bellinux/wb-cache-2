25|$|The Class III cabinet, {{generally}} only {{installed in}} maximum containment laboratories, is {{specifically designed for}} work with BSL-4 pathogenic agents, providing maximum protection. The enclosure is gas-tight, and all materials enter and leave through a dunk tank or <b>double-door</b> autoclave. Gloves attached to the front prevent direct contact with hazardous materials (Class III cabinets are sometimes called glove box). These custom-built cabinets often attach into a line, and the lab equipment installed inside is usually custom-built as well.|$|E
25|$|The {{building}} is {{cast in the}} Greek Revival style, and its foundation and walls are constructed from sandstone. The one-story, symmetrical, rectangular building has a front gabled roof which meets the wall with a slight overhang and wide frieze below; both features are typical of the Greek Revival style. The front (east) facade is built from rock-face sandstone in regular courses, the three remaining walls feature rough-cut stone in irregular courses. Each side wall (north and south) has four windows with round, stone, arched lintels, keystones and stone sills. Each window features a full round arch and a nine over nine sash. Each of the building's four corners is adorned with stone quoins as are all of the windows. The front, <b>double-door</b> has a semi-circular transom window and a stone hood with a keystone above it.|$|E
25|$|The {{residential}} second-story is accessed thorough {{an original}} <b>double-door</b> wooden gate facing Paseo Atocha. Beyond the entrance, an imposing zaguan (hallway), with 17-foot high with exposed beams and rafters ceiling and richly stenciled decorated walls, surprised the visitor. Midpoint in the zaguan, a Roman arch, painted to simulated marble, creates a transition point and serves to visually frame a magnificent eight risers, bronze handrails, marble flared stair. At the stair's landing, {{there are two}} identical richly crafted iron grilled gates. One guards {{the entrance to the}} second floor, while the other one does the same to and from the patio. At the gate's upper portion that faces the zaguan, within a golden painted circle, the metal is curved to form the letters CV, the initials of Carlos Vives, the 1860s owner of the house. A northerly left turn at the landing guides the visitor into an impressive marble straight staircase with bronze handrails, up to the second floor.|$|E

25|$|The LCA {{had a long}} central {{well section}} fitted with three benches, one centre, one each port and starboard, for seating troops. The side benches were covered by the top deck. The well was divided from the bow by a {{bulkhead}} fitted with two vertically hinged doors. This pair of forward-opening armour-plate doors led to the ramp, which was lowered and raised by a simple arrangement of pulleys and wire. Two rollers on the leading outboard edge providing some freedom of movement for the ramp when it was grounded. Over this ramp troops could come ashore {{in two to three}} minutes, or less if the soldiers and crews were well trained. Immediately behind the bulkhead were the steering shelter on the starboard, and the Lewis gun shelter on the port. The steering shelter was fitted with a telegraph and voice pipe for communication with the stoker, a featherspray control lever, and a fold-up seat. The shelter was protected on all four sides by non-magnetic bulletproof plate surmounted by a hinged <b>double-door</b> roof. Most LCAs were fitted with a compass.|$|E
2500|$|In {{keeping with}} the era, the 1959 Galaxie was a chrome and {{stainless}} steel-bedecked vehicle with optional two-tone paint.

2500|$|This {{building}} {{was constructed in}} 1907/08 for the Swedish Methodist Episcopal Church, closely following a design in Benjamin D. and Max Charles Price's 1907 Church Plans.

2500|$|The Brabson plank {{house was}} built by either Andrew Evans or John Brabson {{sometime}} between 1790 and 1810. [...] The plank house was constructed using an odd technique known as piece-sur-piece construction, which involves stacking horizontal planks and tying them in with vertical posts. [...] In the 19th century, the plank house was moved from its original location and renovated {{for use as a}} carriage house. [...] A large <b>double-door</b> was added to the front, and the chimney was removed.
