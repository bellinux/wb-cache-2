40|$|There {{has been}} limited {{research}} to date exploring the significance of a form of respect referred to as <b>mutual</b> <b>recognition</b> respect within manager and subordinate relationships. Based on data collected from 203 manager-subordinate dyads within the Insurance industry in Malaysia, we {{examine the effects of}} <b>mutual</b> <b>recognition</b> respect on subordinate affective commitment and job satisfaction. As theorised, high and shared recognition respect in relationships (<b>mutual</b> <b>recognition</b> respect) was found to positively predict these workplace attitudes. In addition, both manager and subordinate trait emotional intelligence were positively associated with <b>mutual</b> <b>recognition</b> respect. In relationships characterised as having low <b>mutual</b> <b>recognition</b> respect, the model demonstrated a much poorer fit to the data and trait-EI was not found have a significant effect in this model.

40|$|<b>Mutual</b> <b>recognition</b> is {{generally}} not mentioned in debates about new modes of governance, though {{it is an important}} alternative to hierarchical steering in the form of harmonization. Next to its broad use in the single market, <b>mutual</b> <b>recognition</b> has been transferred to justice and home affairs, and becomes relevant also beyond the European Union. This article discusses how far <b>mutual</b> <b>recognition</b> meets the criteria of new modes of governance. Comparing <b>mutual</b> <b>recognition</b> to its alternative – harmonization and national treatment – it gives an introductory overview of the characteristics of the principle. <b>Mutual</b> <b>recognition,</b> it is shown, faces significant preconditions as rules to be mutually recognized have to be equivalent; moreover, rules {{with a high degree of}} input legitimacy are difficult to transfer. Yet, <b>mutual</b> <b>recognition</b> also offers significant advantages over its alternatives, making it an important topic for governance research...|$|R

40|$|Because <b>mutual</b> <b>recognition</b> is now {{enshrined}} in the Lisbon Treaty as a basic principle for judicial cooperation in criminal matters, a consistent interpretation and application becomes all the more important. Nevertheless, no legally binding definition of <b>mutual</b> <b>recognition</b> is provided and a quick scan of the relevant instruments cannot but lead {{to the conclusion that}} <b>mutual</b> <b>recognition</b> appears in as many shapes and sizes as there are instruments referring to it. There seems to be no common understanding of what <b>mutual</b> <b>recognition</b> is, can and cannot be and how consistency is to be guaranteed. Therefore this article critically reviews <b>mutual</b> <b>recognition</b> as a principle and assesses the inconsistencies in the application thereof. The analysis is based on two hypotheses that could clarify the divergent evolution of the principle. The first hypothesis to explain the divergent evolutions is linked to the action radius and the proposition that <b>mutual</b> <b>recognition</b> is the cornerstone of judicial cooperation only. The second hypothesis suggests that the reason for these divergent evolutions is the lack of a common understanding of what <b>mutual</b> <b>recognition</b> entails, what it means or should mean in practice. Based on a thorough analysis of the relevant policy documents, treaties and judicial cooperation instruments (including their preparatory documentation and transcripts from debates in various fora) it is recommended to no longer distinguish between police, customs and judicial cooperation and move ahead with the introduction of <b>mutual</b> <b>recognition</b> as a basic principle for international cooperation in criminal matters in its entirety. Furthermore, the suggestion is made to introduce a lex mitior principle as a new automatic correcting mechanism to temper the effect of <b>mutual</b> <b>recognition</b> {{from the perspective of the}} persons involved...|$|R
40|$|<b>Mutual</b> <b>recognition</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{appreciated}} innovations of the EU. The idea is that one can pursue market integration, indeed "deep' market integration, while respecting 'diversity' amongst the participating countries. Put differently, in pursuing 'free movement' for goods, <b>mutual</b> <b>recognition</b> facilitates free movement by disciplining the nature and scope of 'regulatory barriers', whilst allowing some degree of regulatory discretion for EU Member States. This BEER paper attempts to explain the rationale and logic of <b>mutual</b> <b>recognition</b> in the EU internal goods market, its working in actual practice for about three decades now, culminating in a qualitative cost/benefit analysis and its recent improvement in terms of 'governance' in the so-called New Legislative Framework (first denoted as the 2008 Goods package) thereby ameliorating the benefits/costs ratio. For new (in contrast to existing) national regulation, the intrusive EU procedure to impose <b>mutual</b> <b>recognition</b> is presented as well, with basic data so as to show its critical importance to keep the internal goods market free. All this is complemented by a short summary of the scant economic literature on <b>mutual</b> <b>recognition.</b> Subsequently, the analysis is extended to the internal market for services. This is done in two steps, first by reminding the debate on the origin principle (which goes further than <b>mutual</b> <b>recognition</b> EU-style) and how <b>mutual</b> <b>recognition</b> works under the horizontal services directive. This is followed by a short section on how <b>mutual</b> <b>recognition</b> works in vertical (i. e. sectoral) services markets...|$|R
40|$|The <b>mutual</b> <b>recognition</b> schemes linking Australian {{states and}} territories and New Zealand {{have contributed to}} the {{creation}} of a seamless national economy in Australia and a single economic market across the Tasman, according to a report by the Productivity Commission. This, and other findings are contained in this review of the schemes the Commission presented to Australian Heads of Government and the New Zealand Prime Minister in early February 2009. In an assessment of the two main <b>mutual</b> <b>recognition</b> schemes - the <b>Mutual</b> <b>Recognition</b> Agreement (MRA) and the Trans-Tasman <b>Mutual</b> <b>Recognition</b> Arrangement (TTMRA) - the Commission found that they brought benefits through increased mobility of labour and greater movement of merchandise between jurisdictions. The Commission found, however, that ambiguities and omissions in the legislation create frictions in the operation of the schemes. Moreover, a lack of awareness of <b>mutual</b> <b>recognition</b> means that businesses, individuals and regulators do not always use the schemes fully or appropriately. The Commission recommended a suite of administrative, regulatory and legislative changes to <b>mutual</b> <b>recognition</b> arrangements which, if implemented in the near-to-medium term, would reinvigorate the schemes and allow them to reach their full potential. <b>mutual</b> <b>recognition,</b> Australia New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement, free trade, Trans-Tasman, bilateral engagement...|$|R
40|$|The {{principle}} of <b>mutual</b> <b>recognition</b> is therefore {{nothing less than}} a specific application of that other fundamental aspect of building the Community: the {{principle of}} subsidiarity enshrined in Article 3 b of the EC Treaty as amended by the Treaty on European Union [Commission, 1994, p. 35] The principle of <b>mutual</b> <b>recognition</b> has been derived from Article 30 of the Treaty of Rome, and is claimed to be a practical example of subsidiarity. <b>Mutual</b> <b>recognition,</b> however, whilst striking down trade barriers does not create a Single Market for it results in product characteristics being determined by location of production. Furthermore, the Article 30 freedoms, embraced in the principle of <b>mutual</b> <b>recognition,</b> are not fully elaborated. Subsidiarity is inherently unsuited to the determination of product characteristics, but could usefully be applied to determine production [process] characteristics. <b>Mutual</b> <b>recognition,</b> in fact, has been used by the Commission as a form of deregulation, but by linking the concepts of <b>mutual</b> <b>recognition</b> and subsidiarity, the Commission is liable to bring the latter into disrepute...|$|R

40|$|In his 1986 White Paper on {{completing}} the single market, Lord Cockfield ailed mutual recog-nition as the miracle formula for the much needed {{liberalization of services}} markets. Twenty years later, the European Union is passing a services directive where the principle of <b>mutual</b> <b>recognition</b> is conspicuously absent, {{at a time when}} effective liberalization seems ever more necessary. How do we explain this puzzle? Why has <b>mutual</b> <b>recognition</b> been put on “trial”? We make three interrelated arguments. First, the initial draft directive overlooked the EU’s prior experience in this area which is one of “managed ” <b>mutual</b> <b>recognition.</b> Secondly, the political context had changed significantly, with enlargement exacerbating the distributional consequences of the adoption of <b>mutual</b> <b>recognition.</b> Thirdly, the final compromise succeeded precisely because it recovers the spirit of the managed <b>mutual</b> <b>recognition,</b> albeit in a mini-Paper to be published in Journal of European Public Policy 14 (5), special issue on “Mutual recognition as...|$|R

40|$|There is a stark {{contrast}} between the high official praise paid {{to the principle of}} <b>mutual</b> <b>recognition</b> as "the cornerstone of the Single Market" (European Commission 1999 : 2) and the low satisfaction with the principle’s actual operation on the ground.

On the other hand, ASEAN MRAs respect members' national sovereignty, and it is national authorities, not ASEAN institutions, who have the ultimate power to approve or disapprove the supply of services by ASEAN qualification holders. Such a mixed approach to <b>mutual</b> <b>recognition</b> can be best understood as a centralized mechanism for learning-by-doing, rather than centralized recognition per se...|$|R
40|$|In {{the course}} of the global {{financial}} regulatory reform following the recent financial crisis one could frequently read and hear, not least from the G- 20, about the importance of such devices as global guidelines, global regulatory frameworks, international cooperation, international coordination or harmonization. More and more a strong case is also made for the concept of <b>mutual</b> <b>recognition</b> or similar devices, such as an exemptive approach, often without differentiating properly between them. Moreover, the exact interplay of <b>mutual</b> <b>recognition</b> with substantive coordination or harmonization is usually not examined in depth. This paper is intended to fill the gap by providing a systematic and comprehensive analysis of the theoretical concept of <b>mutual</b> <b>recognition.</b> It will start by explaining the concept of <b>mutual</b> <b>recognition</b> and its significance in detail, contrasting it with the other concepts named above. Against the background that Professor Pierre-Hugues Verdier recently found in volume 52, issue 1 of the Harvard International Law Journal that commentators outside Europe were “increasingly advocating <b>mutual</b> <b>recognition</b> agreements as a substitute for substantive harmonization”, the paper, then, shall particularly contribute to the topical discussion of the question which requirements should be met before <b>mutual</b> <b>recognition</b> can reasonably be established in the field of global financial regulation. It is worth to have a close look at this question, even more since {{at least some of the}} support frequently cited in {{the course of}} this discussion actually refers to an exemptive approach rather than a <b>mutual</b> <b>recognition</b> approach. The die is not yet cast – the question how to solve this crucial issue in a prudent way remains open...|$|R

40|$|<b>Mutual</b> <b>recognition</b> is a {{remarkable}} innovation facilitating economic intercourse across borders. In the EU's internal goods market it has been helpful in tackling or avoiding the remaining obstacles, namely, regulatory barriers between Member States. However, there is a curious paradox. Despite the almost universal acclaim of the great merits of <b>mutual</b> <b>recognition</b> the principle has, in and by itself, contributed only modestly to the actual realisation of free movement in the single market. It is also surprising that economists have not or hardly underpinned their widespread appreciation for the principle by providing rigorous analysis which could substantiate the case for <b>mutual</b> <b>recognition</b> for policy makers. Business in Europe has shown a sense of disenchantment with the principle because of the many costs and uncertainties in its application in actual practice. The {{purpose of the present}} paper is to provide the economic and strategic arguments for employing <b>mutual</b> <b>recognition</b> much more systematically in the single market for goods and services. The strategic and the "welfare " gains are analysed and a detailed exposition of the fairly high information, transaction and compliance costs is provided. The information costs derive from the fact that <b>mutual</b> <b>recognition</b> remains a distant abstraction for day-to-da...|$|R
