40|$|The <b>Dark</b> Triad is {{composed}} of three related subclinical personality traits: narcissism (excessive self-love, need for attention), psychopathy (cold, remorseless), and Machiavellianism (manipulative, cynical). The present study uses <b>Dark</b> Triad film/television characters to examine how <b>Dark</b> Triad people view others like them. It was hypothesized that (1) participants higher in the <b>Dark</b> Triad {{are more interested in}} films/television shows with <b>Dark</b> Triad characters, (2) participants higher in the <b>Dark</b> Triad have a more positive reaction to <b>Dark</b> Triad characters, and (3) <b>Dark</b> Triad participants see themselves in <b>Dark</b> Triad characters. Gender differences in <b>Dark</b> Triad character evaluations were also examined. Participants were shown trailers for films/television shows, most of which featured a <b>Dark</b> Triad character, and asked questions about the films/shows and specific characters. Participants were given a questionnaire that assessed their <b>Dark</b> Triad characteristics. Results showed no significant relationship between <b>Dark</b> Triad scores and interest in films/shows with <b>Dark</b> Triad leads. However, participants higher in the <b>Dark</b> Triad viewed <b>Dark</b> Triad characters more positively than others. Also, <b>Dark</b> Triad participants saw themselves in <b>Dark</b> Triad characters. It was found that the ability of <b>Dark</b> Triad participants to see themselves in these characters mediated the relationship between participants’ <b>Dark</b> Triad scores and their reactions to <b>Dark</b> Triad characters. In conclusion, <b>Dark</b> Triad characters are generally disliked, but this does not affect liking of films/shows featuring them. However, people higher in the <b>Dark</b> Triad do like these characters more than others, likely because they see the characters as similar to themselves...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In a {{companion}} paper (to be presented), lattice field theory methods {{are used to}} show that in two-color, two-flavor QCD there are stable nuclear states in the spectrum. As a commonly studied theory of composite <b>dark</b> matter, this motivates the consideration of possible nuclear physics in this and other composite <b>dark</b> sectors. In this work, early Universe cosmology and indirect detection signatures are explored for both symmetric and asymmetric <b>dark</b> matter, highlighting the unique features that arise from considerations of <b>dark</b> nuclei and associated <b>dark</b> nuclear processes. The present day <b>dark</b> matter abundance may be composed of <b>dark</b> nucleons and/or <b>dark</b> nuclei, where the latter are generated through <b>dark</b> nucleosynthesis. For symmetric <b>dark</b> matter, indirect detection signatures are possible from annihilation, <b>dark</b> nucleosynthesis, and <b>dark</b> nuclear capture and we present a novel explanation of the galactic center gamma ray excess based on the latter. For asymmetric <b>dark</b> matter, <b>dark</b> nucleosynthesis may alter the capture of <b>dark</b> matter in stars, allowing for captured particles to be processed into nuclei and ejected from the star through <b>dark</b> nucleosynthesis in the core.

The race weekend was marked by the deaths of Austrian driver Roland Ratzenberger and of three-time world champion Ayrton Senna in separate accidents. Other incidents saw driver Rubens Barrichello injured and several mechanics and spectators injured. In terms of driver fatalities, this was Formula One's <b>darkest</b> weekend since two drivers were killed at the 1960 Belgian Grand Prix.|$|E
5|$|Hancock {{served in}} Congress {{through some of}} the <b>darkest</b> days of the Revolutionary War.

Hancock wrote innumerable letters to colonial officials, raising money, supplies, and troops for Washington's army. He chaired the Marine Committee, and took pride in helping to create a small fleet of American frigates, including the USS Hancock, which was named in his honor.|$|E
40|$|<b>Dark</b> {{energy in}} the {{universe}} {{is assumed to be}} vacuum energy. The energy-momentum of vacuum is described by a scale-dependent cosmological constant. The equations of motion imply for the density of matter (dust) the sum of the usual matter density (luminous matter) and an additional matter density (<b>dark</b> matter) similar to the <b>dark</b> energy. The scale-dependent cosmological constant is given up to an exponent which is approximated by the experimentally decided density parameters of <b>dark</b> matter and <b>dark</b> energy. This yields that <b>dark</b> matter is one third of <b>dark</b> energy for all times implying an explanation of the coincidence of <b>dark</b> matter and <b>dark</b> energy.

40|$|We have {{considered}} a cosmological model of holographic <b>dark</b> energy interacting with <b>dark</b> matter and another unknown component of <b>dark</b> {{energy of the}} universe. We have assumed two interaction terms $Q$ and $Q'$ in order to include the scenario in which the mutual interaction between the two principal components (i. e., holographic <b>dark</b> energy and <b>dark</b> matter) of the universe leads to some loss in other forms of cosmic constituents. Our model is valid {{for any sign of}} $Q$ and $Q'$. If $QQ'$, then <b>dark</b> matter energy receives from <b>dark</b> energy and from the unknown component of <b>dark</b> energy. Observation suggests that <b>dark</b> energy decays into <b>dark</b> matter. Here we have presented a general prescription of a cosmological model of <b>dark</b> energy which imposes mutual interaction between holographic <b>dark</b> energy, <b>dark</b> matter and another fluid. We have obtained the equation of state for the holographic <b>dark</b> energy density which is interacting with <b>dark</b> matter and other unknown component of <b>dark</b> energy. Using first law of thermodynamics, we have obtained the entropies for holographic <b>dark</b> energy, <b>dark</b> matter and other component of <b>dark</b> energy, when holographic <b>dark</b> energy interacting with two fluids (i. e., <b>dark</b> matter and other component of <b>dark</b> energy). Also we have found the entropy at the horizon when the radius ($L$) of the event horizon measured on the sphere of the horizon. We have investigated the GSL of thermodynamics at the present time for the universe enveloped by this horizon. Finally, it has been obtained validity of GSL which implies some bounds on deceleration parameter $q$. Comment: 10 page...|$|R
