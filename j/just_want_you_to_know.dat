[...] The songwriter also told Q that year that the abundance of infant and childbirth imagery on the album and his newfound fatherhood were coincidental. [...] However, Azerrad argued {{that much of the}} album contains personal themes, noting that Grohl held a similar view. [...] Grohl said, [...] "A lot of {{what he has to say}} is related to a lot of the shit he's gone through. [...] And it's not so much teen angst anymore. [...] It's a whole different ball game: rock star angst." [...] Cobain downplayed recent events ("I really haven't had that exciting a life") and told Azerrad that he did not want to write a track that explicitly expressed his anger at the media, but the author countered that [...] "Rape Me" [...] seemed to deal with that very issue. [...] While Cobain said the song was written long before his troubles with drug addiction became public, he agreed that the song could be viewed in that light. [...] "Serve The Servants" [...] contains comments about Cobain's life, both as a child and as an adult. [...] The opening lines [...] "Teenage angst has paid off well/Now I'm bored and old" [...] were a reference to Cobain's state of mind in the wake of Nirvana's success. [...] Cobain dismissed the media attention given to the effect his parents' divorce had on his life with the line [...] "That legendary divorce is such a bore" [...] from the chorus, and directly addressed his father with the lines [...] "I tried hard to have a father/But instead I had a dad/I <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that I don't hate you anymore/There is nothing I could say that I haven't thought before". [...] Cobain said he wanted his father to know he did not hate him, but had no desire to talk to him.|$|E

She pointed out that it irritated Emily when people asked her if she was Katie Couric's sister. She told the mourners, [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> I will always be proud to say 'I am Emily Couric's sister'."

2500|$|While CEO of WorldCom, he was {{a member}} of the Easthaven Baptist Church in Brookhaven, Mississippi. As a {{high-profile}} member of the congregation, Ebbers regularly taught Sunday School and attended the morning worship service with his family. His faith was overt, and he often started corporate meetings with prayer. When the allegations of conspiracy and fraud were first brought to light in 2002, Ebbers addressed the congregation and insisted on his innocence. [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> you aren't going to church with a crook," [...] he said. [...] "No one will find me to have knowingly committed fraud." ...|$|E

2500|$|By the {{beginning}} of 2007, Lords became unexpectedly pregnant. She first announced her pregnancy in June: [...] "I kind of thought the children thing was off the table. Now I’m expecting a boy! We're stunned and thrilled. [...] I <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>know,</b> these 36-Ds are mine. I haven’t had a boob job. I am 5 1/2 months pregnant! But now I’m starting to show. And my husband is happy with the changes in my figure." [...] On October 7, 2007, {{at the age of}} 39, she gave birth to a son, Joseph Gunnar Lee, her first child with her husband of five years, Jeff Lee.|$|E
2500|$|About {{six months}} after its British release, Scissor Sisters was {{released}} in the US. To publicize it the band appeared on the popular morning television show Live with Regis and Kelly, an event that Shears later recalled: [...] "Kelly Ripa loved us, after {{the first time we}} played, she gave me a hug and whispered in my ear, 'I <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that this is my favorite music performance we've ever had.' It was amazing." [...] Nonetheless, neither the band nor the album proved to be a big commercial success in the US: major chain store Wal-Mart refused to stock it, claiming on its website that it contained [...] "a snarling, swaggering attack on conservatism" [...] {{in the form of the}} song [...] "Tits on the Radio".|$|E
2500|$|Sometime afterward, Bobby Kennedy {{obtained}} King's {{release from}} prison. Martin Luther King, Sr. was so {{grateful for the}} release that he voted for Kennedy and said [...] "I'll take a catholic or the devil himself if he'll wipe the tears from my daughter-in-law's eyes." [...] According to Coretta, Kennedy said [...] "I want to express my concern about your husband. I know this must be very hard on you. I understand you are expecting a baby, and I <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that I was thinking about you and Dr. King. If there is anything I can do to help, please feel free to call on me." [...] Kennedy's contact with King was learned about quickly by reporters, with Coretta admitting that it [...] "made me feel good that he called me personally {{and let me know}} how he felt." ...|$|E

2500|$|It was a {{very hard}} {{thing for me to}} do because I liked him but I really felt what he did was awful and that unless I felt myself if I didn’t say something, I’d be a hypocrite. I also felt that if {{somebody}} who was supportive of him didn’t say something, it would not be good. And so it got a lot of attention. I got a call from Erskine Bowles who was Chief of Staff about three or four days later saying {{that he was going to}} express an opinion which wasn’t universally held at the White House– he thought I helped the president by bursting the boil, that was the metaphor he used. The following Sunday morning, I'm at home and the phone rings, it’s the White House. And it’s now about a week and a couple of days since I made the speech. The president says, it was the president, [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that there’s nothing you said in that speech that I don’t agree with. And I want you to know that I’m working on it." [...] And we talked for about forty-five minutes. It was amazing.|$|E
2500|$|On 28 October, after {{performing}} on V Graham Norton {{to promote the}} Singles compilation, Anderson {{made the decision to}} call it a day. This decision coincided with the release of the band's biography, Love and Poison on 3 November. On 5 November, the band announced {{that there would be no}} more projects under the Suede name for the foreseeable future – effectively announcing the end of the band, as they stated on their website: [...] "There will not be a new studio album until the band feel that the moment is artistically right to make one." [...] Anderson also made a personal statement saying: [...] "There has been speculation about record sales and chart positions, but the bottom line is I need to do whatever it takes to get my demon back." [...] Suede's last concert at the London Astoria on 13 December 2003 was a two-and-a-half-hour marathon show, split into two parts plus encore. Anderson made an announcement, saying, [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>know.</b> There will be another Suede record. But not yet." [...] Later, Osman would reveal that as they were walking to the studio set, Anderson whispered into his ear: [...] "Let's not do this anymore." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the success}} of their {{previous}} album, The Real Thing and its subsequent tour, Faith No More took a break {{for a year and a}} half before beginning work on the follow-up, Angel Dust. During this time Mike Patton rejoined his high-school band Mr. Bungle to record their eponymous début album. This situation had an effect on the band, since drummer Mike Bordin thought the writing process was like the state of a [...] "magic slate" [...] having been [...] "completely covered in writing; there was not any more room for any more writing on that slate, so we all went and said all right, and erased everything, and started writing new stuff," [...] and Patton was creatively revitalized. They decided not to [...] "play it safe" [...] and instead took a different musical direction, much to the dismay of guitarist Jim Martin. [...] Martin also didn't like the title of the album as chosen by keyboardist Roddy Bottum. [...] In an interview taken while they were in the studio he said that [...] "Roddy [...] wanted to name it Angel Dust, I don't know why, I <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that if it's named Angel Dust, it didn't have anything to do with me.|$|E

I used to sit on the porch, in town, and I--I couldn't get over the feeling that you'd simply run up to the drug store and would be right back, and till after it got dark I'd catch myself watching, looking up the street, and you never came, and the house was so empty and still that I didn't like to go in. And sometimes I fell asleep there, in my chair, and didn't wake up till after midnight, and the house----Oh, the devil! Please get me, Carrie.

I 'm some man of affairs, if anybody should ride up on a {{vegetable}} wagon an' ask you. Now, I 'm goin' to tell you, though I can't see why the Glen Ellen folks didn't beat me to it. I guess they was asleep. Nobody'd a-overlooked a thing like it in the city. You see, it was like this: you know that fancy brickyard they're gettin' ready to start for makin' extra special fire brick for inside walls? Well, here was I worryin' about the six horses comin' back on my hands, earnin' me nothin' an' eatin' me into the poorhouse. I had to get 'm work somehow, an' I remembered the brickyard. I drove the colt down an' talked with that Jap chemist who's been doin' the experimentin'. Gee! They was foremen lookin' over the ground an' everything gettin' ready to hum. I looked over the lay an' studied it. Then I drove up to where they're openin' the clay pit--you know, that fine, white chalky stuff we saw 'em borin' out just outside the hundred an' forty acres with the three knolls. It's a down-hill haul, a mile, an' two horses can do it easy. In fact, their hardest job'll be haulin' the empty wagons up to the pit. Then I tied the colt an' went to figurin'.|$|E

I felt very strongly what I expressed to you last year; I couldn't think of anything else. I tried to forget--energetically, systematically. I tried to take an interest in somebody else. I tell you this because I want you to know I did my duty. I didn't succeed. It was for the same purpose I went abroad--as far away as possible. They say travelling distracts the mind, but it didn't distract mine. I've thought of you perpetually, ever since I last saw you. I'm exactly the same. I love you just as much, and everything I said to you then is just as true. This instant at which I speak to you shows me again exactly how, to my great misfortune, you just insuperably charm me. There--I can't say less. I don't mean, however, to insist; it's only for a moment. I may add that when I came upon you a few minutes since, without the smallest idea of seeing you, I was, upon my honour, in the very act of wishing I knew where you were." [...] He had recovered his self-control, and while he spoke it became complete. He might have been addressing a small committee--making all quietly and clearly a statement of importance; aided by an occasional look at a paper of notes concealed in his hat, which he had not again put on. And the committee, assuredly, would have felt the point proved.|$|E
