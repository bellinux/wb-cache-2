Alfred Lotka's predator-prey equations, G.

40|$|The spatial {{organization}} of ecological units that constitute river floodplains was modeled using a recent image synthesis method. The model combined a purely spatial process, the stochastic pyramid, with analytical descriptions of <b>ecological</b> <b>successions</b> observed on each landform of the fluvial landscape. Because the stochastic pyramid is a generator of non-homogeneous, anisotropic, multicolored and random patterns, based on concepts of mosaics, {{it could be}} articulated {{with a series of}} diagrams which related the seral successional states to the spatial configuration of ecological units. Modeling was performed in two steps. A priori probabilities were determined to transpose theoretical diagrams onto a processing image containing only the channel network of a real map; then after a random draw, a randomly textured image was obtained, this image was then transformed by the controlled stochastic pyramid {{in order to create a}} partition of wider regions without texture. As a result of this transformation, each colored pixel tended to expand and to incorporate its neighboring pixels that were randomly deleted.

Many scientists and conservation groups opposed the logging plan, contending that the removal of trees from this area would harm species such as black-backed woodpeckers and affect other cavity-nesting birds that follow in the wake of the woodpeckers. Other species of wildlife were also considered be at risk from salvage logging, such as frogs that inhabit forested streams and deer.

5|$|The {{discipline}} of plant ecology was pioneered {{in the late}} 19th century by botanists such as Eugenius Warming, who produced the hypothesis that plants form communities, and his mentor and successor Christen C. Raunkiær whose system for describing plant life forms is still in use today. The concept that the composition of plant communities such as temperate broadleaf forest changes by a process of <b>ecological</b> <b>succession</b> was developed by Henry Chandler Cowles, Arthur Tansley and Frederic Clements. Clements is credited {{with the idea of}} climax vegetation as the most complex vegetation that an environment can support and Tansley introduced the concept of ecosystems to biology. Building on the extensive earlier work of Alphonse de Candolle, Nikolai Vavilov (1887–1943) produced accounts of the biogeography, centres of origin, and evolutionary history of economic plants.|$|E

40|$|Ecological {{stoichiometry}} {{suggests that}} plant Nitrogen (N) -to-Phosphorus (P) ratios respond {{to changes in}} both soil N:P stoichiometry and soil N and P availability. Thus we would expect that soil and plant N:P ratios be significantly related along natural gradients of soil development such as those associated with primary <b>ecological</b> <b>successions.</b> Here we explicitly search for linkages between plant and soil N:P stoichiometry along four primary successions distributed across Europe. We measured N and P content in soils and plant compartments (leaf, stem and root) of 72 wild plant species distributed along two sand dune and two glacier successions where soil age ranges from few to thousand years old. Overall we found that soil N:P ratios strongly increased along successional stages, however, plant N:P ratios were neither related to soil N:P stoichiometry nor to changes in soil N and P availability. Instead changes in plant nutrient stoichiometry were "driven" by plant-functional-group identity. Not only N:P ratios differed between legumes, grasses and forbs but each of these plant functional groups maintained N:P ratios relatively constant across pioneer, middle and advanced successional stages. Our evidence is that soil nutrient stoichiometry {{may not be a}} good predictor of changes in plant N:P stoichiometry along natural primary <b>ecological</b> <b>successions,</b> which have not reached yet a retrogressive stage. This could be because wild-plants rely on mechanisms of internal nutrient regulation, which make them less dependent to changes in soil nutrient availability under unpredictable environmental conditions. Further studies need to clarify what underlying evolutionary and eco-physiological mechanisms determine changes in nutrient stoichiometry in plant species distributed across natural environmental gradients...|$|R
5|$|The {{remaining}} ecological zones, {{with their}} progression from shoreline to climax forest, are a classic {{illustration of the}} concept of <b>ecological</b> <b>succession.</b> Much of this progression is due to the changing nature of Presque Isle and its shifting shoreline and dunes. The shoreline, the second zone, is formed by wave action and is in equilibrium between erosion and deposition, with the initial plants stabilizing the sand of the new shoreline. The newly formed sandy plain and the ponds formed in it are the third zone. The ponds start as trapped pockets of lake water and can erode away or be filled by wind-blown sand or drifting dunes. The new ponds provide habitat for plants and animals: for example, the state park is home to 89 species of Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) and Lepidoptera, including 35 different butterflies, as well as 84 different sorts of spiders.|$|E
5|$|During the {{regrowth}} of {{pine trees}} after disturbance like clearcutting or wildfire, there appears an orderly sequence of mycorrhizal fungi as one species {{is replaced by}} another. A study on the <b>ecological</b> <b>succession</b> of ectomycorrhizal fungi in Canadian jack pine forests following wildfire concluded that S.brevipes is a multi-stage fungus. It appears relatively early during tree development; fruit bodies were common in 6-year-old tree stands, and the fungus colonized the highest proportion of root tips. The fungus persists throughout {{the life of the}} tree, having been found in tree stands that were 41, 65, and 122 years old. There is, however, a relative reduction in the prevalence of the fungus with increasing stand age, which may be attributed to increased competition from other fungi, and a change in habitat brought about by closure of the forest canopy. Generally, S.brevipes responds favorably to silvicultural practices such as thinning and clearcutting. A 1996 study demonstrated that fruit bodies increased in abundance as the severity of disturbance increased. It has been suggested that the thick-walled, wiry rhizomorphs produced by the fungus may serve as an adaptation that helps it to survive and remain viable {{for a period of time}} following disturbance.|$|E
5|$|Erosion can be {{the result}} of {{material}} movement by the wind. There are two main effects. First, wind causes small particles to be lifted and therefore moved to another region. This is called deflation. Second, these suspended particles may impact on solid objects causing erosion by abrasion (<b>ecological</b> <b>succession).</b> Wind erosion generally occurs in areas with little or no vegetation, often in areas where there is insufficient rainfall to support vegetation. An example is the formation of sand dunes, on a beach or in a desert. Loess is a homogeneous, typically nonstratified, porous, friable, slightly coherent, often calcareous, fine-grained, silty, pale yellow or buff, windblown (Aeolian) sediment. It generally occurs as a widespread blanket deposit that covers areas of hundreds of square kilometers and tens of meters thick. Loess often stands in either steep or vertical faces. Loess tends to develop into highly rich soils. Under appropriate climatic conditions, areas with loess are among the most agriculturally productive in the world. Loess deposits are geologically unstable by nature, and will erode very readily. Therefore, windbreaks (such as big trees and bushes) are often planted by farmers to reduce the wind erosion of loess.|$|E

The genus Frankia encompasses a diverse group of soil actinomycetes that have in common the formation of multilocular sporangia, filamentous growth, and nitrogenase-containing vesicles enveloped in multilaminated lipid envelopes. The relatively constant morphology of vesicles in culture is modified by plant interactions in symbiosis to give a diverse array of vesicles shapes. Recent studies of the genetics and molecular genetics of these organisms have begun to provide new insights into higher-plant-bacterium interactions that lead to productive N 2 -fixing symbioses. Sufficient information about the relationship of Frankia strains to other bacteria, and to each other, is now available to warrant the creation of some species based on phenotypic and genetic criteria...|$|R
2500|$|Historical ecologists {{recognize}} that landscapes undergo continuous alteration {{over time and}} these modifications are part of that landscape's history.

Landscape transformations are <b>ecological</b> <b>successions</b> driven by human impacts. [...] Primary landscape transformations occur when human activity results in a complete turnover of species and major substrate modifications in certain habitats while secondary landscape transformations involve human-induced changes in species proportions. The stages of landscape transformation demonstrate the history of a landscape. These stages can be brought on by humans or natural causes. Parts of the Amazon rainforest exhibit different stages of landscape transformation such as the impact of indigenous slash-and-burn horticulture on plant species compositions. Such landscape transformation does not inherently reduce biodiversity or harm the environment. There are many cases in which human-mediated disturbance increases biodiversity as landscapes transform over time.|$|R

The results of the experiments show that there are few significant differences in the ability of the vegetation types studied to control runoff or soil erosion. Of the plant properties considered, only plant canopy cover showed a significant relationship with soil loss and runoff with the greatest reduction in soil loss taking place at canopy covers greater than 30 %.

40|$|International audienceA Markovian {{extinction}} {{model that}} takes into account age structure of local populations allows consideration of the effects of demography and successional dynamics on the evolution of migration. Analytical expressions for the evolutionarily stable (ES) rates of dispersal are given for cases in which newly recolonized sites attain carrying capacity within a single season. Using a low-fecundity numerical model, we find that an increase of the level of site saturation increases the dispersal rate. <b>Ecological</b> <b>successions</b> and unequal local extinction rates between newly colonized sites and established populations strongly affect the ES dispersal rate. The frequency of genetic modifiers that enhance the rate of dispersal evolves negative correlations with deme age, with high-migration genotypes predominant among colonizers while progressively declining in frequency as a deme ages. This suggests that between-deme selection (colonization) favors migrants while within-deme selection favors low dispersers, which allows the coexistence of types with different dispersal rates. Because of the interaction between the two levels of selection, the relation between the ES dispersal rate and the deme maximal lifetime is nonmonotone. We suggest that life-history traits other than dispersal might also experience antagonistic selective forces at the between- and within-deme levels...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{responsible for}} species replacement during <b>ecological</b> <b>successions</b> is a long-standing and open debate.

In Catalonia, distribution models suggested that the apparent exclusion of S. melanocephala from the open and forest ends of the gradient may be explained entirely by the preference of S. melanocephala for mid-successional shrublands. However, a joint analysis of both data sets revealed that: 1) S. melanocephala was more evenly distributed along the vegetation gradient in Greece, suggesting ecological release in the low-diversity area; and 2) a distribution model assuming interspecific competition (based on the distribution of Sylvia species showing a negative co-occurrence pattern with S. melanocephala) had a significantly higher predictive ability than a distribution model based on habitat variables alone. Our study supports the view that species turnover along ecological gradients generally results from a combination of intrinsic preferences and interspecific competition [Current Zoology 57 (3) : 307 – 317, 2011]...|$|R

Following the size-grain hypothesis, smaller ant species are likely to be advantaged in more complex habitats compared to larger species. Habitat complexity can act as an environmental filter based on species size and morphological traits, therefore affecting the overall structure and diversity of ant assemblages. In natural and semi-natural ecosystems, habitat complexity is principally regulated by <b>ecological</b> <b>successions</b> or disturbance such as fire and grazing. Urban ecosystems provide an opportunity to test relationships between habitat, ant assemblage structure and ant traits using novel combinations of habitat complexity generated and sustained by human management. We sampled ant assemblages in low-complexity and high-complexity parks, and high-complexity woodland remnants, hypothesizing that (i) ant abundance and species richness would be higher in high-complexity urban habitats, (ii) ant assemblages would differ between low- and high-complexity habitats and (iii) ants living in high-complexity habitats would be smaller than those living in low-complexity habitats. Contrary to our hypothesis, ant species richness was higher in low-complexity habitats compared to high-complexity habitats. Overall, ant assemblages were significantly different among the habitat complexity types investigated, although ant size and morphology remained the same.

However, studies of environmental change from such systems are rare. Sediment cores from the northern Macquarie Marshes, Murray-Darling Basin, provide a high-resolution (decadal-centennial scale) multi-proxy record of the past diversity and <b>ecological</b> <b>successions</b> of a wetland system from semi-arid inland Australia. In Loudens Lagoon on the eastern Marshes, a hiatus separates the Late Pleistocene-age sediments (50 - 27 ka BP) from late Holocene sediments (c. 2. 3 ka BP) which are barren of microfossils until the 13 th century AD. Charophytes and emergent vegetation are recorded from c. 1200 AD and become richer in recent times, with a concomitant increase of dry-tolerant Chenopodiaceae, indicating variable water cover at the site. The approximately 500 -year old record from adjacent 2 ̆ 7 Bora Lagoon 2 ̆ 7 indicates that, by comparison, this site was more frequently inundated. The charophytes Sphaerochara (=Tolypella sect.

Between the 1940 s and 1960 s, charophytes indicating shallow water are diverse and abundant, with diatoms appearing c. 1955 AD. The reduction in charophytes and change in the diatom assemblages indicates increasing turbidity and pH after 1965 AD. The increased sedimentation rate and turbidity between the 1940 s and 1970 s are related to land use change.
