Thus in many instances I have been forced to replace yet undiscovered concepts by their closest twentieth-century equivalents. Such words as peltast, androgyn, and exultant are substitutions of this kind, and are intended to be suggestive rather than definitive.|$|E

500|$|The {{screenplay}} {{was modified}} {{from its original}} draft form during the film's shooting. [...] Price himself suggested numerous dialogue changes for his character. [...] In the script, when Francis Barnard is first introduced to Nicholas, the young man asks about loud, strange noises he had heard a few moments earlier. [...] Don Medina responds: [...] "Uh...an apparatus, Mr. Barnard. (turning) What brings you to us?" [...] Price penciled in the suggestions [...] "that must be kept in constant repair" [...] and [...] "that cannot be stopped". [...] Later in the screenplay, when Nicholas recalls his father's chamber of torture, Price devised alternate explanations for Sebastian Medina's violence. [...] During Nicholas' death scene, after falling {{to the bottom of}} the pit the character originally had dialogue at the point of dying, asking in a voice of horror, [...] "Elizabeth. [...] What <b>have</b> <b>I</b> <b>done</b> to you? [...] (beat) [...] What <b>have</b> <b>I</b> <b>done</b> to you?" [...] The camera was to then cut directly to Elizabeth's face trapped in the iron maiden. [...] Corman decided to jettison the lines, believing that the film should remain purely visual at that point and dialogue would ruin the power of the scene.|$|E
500|$|The Conservative leader Stanley Baldwin privately {{wrote to}} MacDonald {{offering}} {{to withdraw the}} motion of censure {{in exchange for the}} government's support for the appointment of a Select Committee. MacDonald consulted with Jimmy Thomas and Hastings (whose reply was simply [...] "Go to hell") and decided to reject the offer. Although the motion of censure failed, the motion to appoint a Select Committee passed the House over the opposition of the government, and the Labour government was forced out of office. Hastings was embittered by the disaster, and considered immediately quitting politics altogether, although he did not do so. His plight was depicted on the cover of Time Magazine, along with a quotation ("What <b>have</b> <b>I</b> <b>done</b> wrong?") from his speech.|$|E
500|$|In December 1941, O'Hara married American film {{director}} William Houston Price (dialogue director in The Hunchback of Notre Dame). She lost her virginity to Price {{on her wedding}} night and immediately regretted it, and recalled thinking to herself [...] "What the hell <b>have</b> <b>I</b> <b>done</b> now". It was soon after the honeymoon that she realized Price was an alcoholic. The couple had one child, a daughter, Bronwyn Bridget Price (born 30 June 1944). O'Hara's marriage to Price steadily declined throughout the 1940s due to his alcohol abuse, and she often wanted to file for divorce but felt guilty due to her Catholic beliefs. Price himself eventually realized that his marriage was over and filed for divorce in July 1951 {{on the grounds of}} [...] "incompatibility". O'Hara claims that he finally left the large house they shared at 1435 Stone Canyon Drive in Bel Air, Los Angeles on 29 December 1951, on their 10th wedding anniversary.|$|E

500|$|At Thaxted, Holst became {{friendly}} with the Rev Conrad Noel, {{known as the}} [...] "Red Vicar", who supported the Independent Labour Party and espoused many causes unpopular with conservative opinion. Noel also encouraged the revival of folk-dancing and processionals as part of church ceremonies, innovations which caused controversy among traditionally-minded churchgoers. Holst became an occasional organist and choirmaster at Thaxted Parish Church; he also developed an interest in bell-ringing. He started an annual music festival at Whitsuntide in 1916; students from Morley College and St Paul's Girls' School performed together with local participants. Holst's a cappella carol, [...] "This <b>Have</b> <b>I</b> <b>Done</b> For My True Love", was dedicated to Noel in recognition of {{his interest in the}} ancient origins of religion (the composer always referred to the work as [...] "The Dancing Day"). It received its first performance during the Third Whitsun Festival at Thaxted in May 1918. During that festival, Noel, a staunch supporter of Russia's October Revolution, demanded in a Saturday message during the service {{that there should be a}} greater political commitment from those who participated in the church activities; his claim that several of Holst's pupils (implicitly those from St Paul's Girls' School) were merely [...] "camp followers" [...] caused offence. Holst, anxious to protect his students from being embroiled in ecclesiastical conflict, moved the Whitsun Festival to Dulwich, though he himself continued to help with the Thaxted choir and to play the church organ on occasion.|$|E
500|$|The discography of the Pet Shop Boys, an English electronic/pop music duo, {{comprises}} 13 studio albums, four compilation albums, two live albums, four remix albums, one extended {{play and}} 55 singles. The duo's debut single, [...] "West End Girls", was first released in 1984 {{but failed to}} chart in most regions. However, the song was entirely re-recorded in late 1985, and this newly recorded version became their first number-one single, topping the UK Singles Chart, Billboard Hot 100 and Canadian Singles Chart. Parlophone Records released the duo's debut album, Please, in the United Kingdom in March 1986. The album peaked at number three on the UK Albums Chart and was certified Platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). It also peaked at number seven on the Billboard 200 in the United States and was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The following summer they released [...] "It's a Sin", the lead single from their second album, Actually. The single became another UK number one and also reached number nine in the US. This was followed by [...] "What <b>Have</b> <b>I</b> <b>Done</b> to Deserve This?", with Dusty Springfield, which peaked at number two in both the UK and US. In the summer of 1987 the Pet Shop Boys recorded [...] "Always on My Mind", a cover of the Brenda Lee track, and it became their third UK number-one single over Christmas 1987. This was followed by another UK number one, [...] "Heart" [...] in spring 1988. The album Actually was released in September 1987, peaked at number two in the UK and was certified three-times Platinum by the BPI.|$|E
500|$|On 3 November, Frederick and {{his entourage}} {{departed}} for San Remo. At San Remo two days later, on 5 November, Frederick entirely lost his voice and experienced severe pain throughout his throat. Upon examination, Dr. Hovell discovered a new growth under the left vocal cord; when the news reached William and the German government, it caused great consternation. The following day, Mackenzie issued a bulletin stating that while {{there was no immediate}} danger to the Crown Prince, his illness had [...] "unfortunately taken an unfavourable turn," [...] and that he had requested advice from other specialists, including the Austrian professor of laryngology Leopold Schrötter and Dr. Hermann Krause of Berlin. On 9 November, Schrötter and Krause diagnosed the new growth as malignant, and said it was unlikely Frederick could live another year. All the doctors in attendance, including Mackenzie, now concluded that Frederick's disease was indeed laryngeal cancer, as new lesions had appeared {{on the right side of}} the larynx, and that an immediate and total laryngectomy was required to save his life; Moritz Schmidt, one of the doctors, subsequently said that the earlier growths found in May had also been cancerous. Frederick was devastated by the news, bursting into tears upon being informed by Mackenzie and crying, [...] "To think I should have such a horrid disgusting illness ... I had so hoped to have been of use to my country. Why is Heaven so cruel to me? What <b>have</b> <b>I</b> <b>done</b> to be thus stricken and condemned?" [...] Even at this stage, however, Frederick, in a private discussion with his wife, decided against the laryngectomy as it was itself highly risky. He sent his doctors a written statement that he would remain in Italy and would only submit to a tracheotomy if he was at risk of suffocating due to his condition. The news was greeted with shock in Berlin and generated further hatred against Victoria, now seen as a domineering [...] "foreigner" [...] who was manipulating her husband. Some politicians suggested that Frederick be made to relinquish his position in the line of succession in favour of his son Wilhelm, but Bismarck firmly stated that Frederick would succeed his ailing father [...] "whether he is ill or not, [...] whether the K is then unable permanently to perform his duties," [...] would then be determined per the relevant provisions of the Prussian Constitution. [...] Despite the renewed diagnosis of cancer, Frederick's condition appeared to improve after 5 November, and he became more optimistic; through January 1888 there remained some hope that the diagnosis was incorrect. Both Frederick and Victoria retained their faith in Mackenzie, who reexamined Frederick's throat several times in December and gave a good prognosis, again doubting whether the growths had been cancerous.|$|E

She also appeared on the promotional video. The single rose to No.2 on both the US and UK charts. It appeared on the Pet Shop Boys album Actually, and on both artists' greatest hits collections. Springfield sang lead vocals on the Richard Carpenter song [...] "Something in Your Eyes", recorded for his album, Time (October 1987). Released as a single, it became a US No.12 adult contemporary hit. Springfield recorded a duet with B. J.

Co-written with Allee Willis and also featuring Dusty Springfield on vocals, the single reached number two on the UK Singles Chart and the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart. Although the duo had wanted to release this track on their debut album, they had been unable to track down Springfield and were reluctant to record it with any other female singer, despite their record company's suggestions. Springfield's manager finally contacted them in 1986, following the release of Please, and towards the end of that year, she travelled to London to record [...] "What <b>Have</b> <b>I</b> <b>Done</b> to Deserve This?" [...] with them. It was the first track to be recorded for the duo's second album. Pet Shop Boys had been told that Springfield was difficult to work with and even that she could no longer sing; however, her performance on the track put any such concerns to rest and they began a collaboration with her, which lasted {{until the end of the}} decade. Included on their second album Actually, the song became a massive worldwide hit and resurrected Springfield's career, leading to her 1990 album, Reputation, on which Pet Shop Boys were major contributing writers and producers.
