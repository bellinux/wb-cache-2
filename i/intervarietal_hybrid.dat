These variations notably affected the microsatellite nucleotide sequences as well as the sequences surrounding them. The changes observed consisted of insertions, deletions and nucleotide substitutions, with transition and transversion types equally common.

40|$|Experiments {{were carried}} out in the {{agricultural}} years 1992 / 93 and 1993 / 94 at twelve locations, totaling 19 environments, to assess the environmental effects, stability and adaptability of 16 maize cultivars. The cultivars were two three-way hybrids (P 3230 and G 500); three double hybrids (C 525, BR 201 and HD 25); seven varieties (OC 202, BR 106, IAPAR 26, IAPAR 50, IAPAR 51, IAPAR 52 and PMI 8601); and four <b>intervarietal</b> <b>hybrids</b> (HI 8901, HI 8902, HI 8735 and HI 8768). The year x location and year x genotype x location interactions were both highly significant (P < 0, 01), showing that the assessed genotypes had differentiated responses when tested in different environments. According to the analysis of Eberhart & Russel (1966), the three-way hybrids P 3230, G 500 and the double hybrid BR 201 were responsive and adapted to all the environments while the varieties IAPAR 50, IAPAR 51, IAPAR 52, and PMI 8601 had average responsiveness, but were poorly adapted and cultivar IAPAR 26 had low responsiveness and adaptability. The two-segmented model proposed by Cruz et al. (1989) was used to determine whether the genotypes had different performance in inferior or superior environments. In favorable environments, the <b>intervarietal</b> <b>hybrids</b> HI 8735 and HI 8768 were considered responsive, C 525 was considered little responsive and the others were considered of average responsiveness. Utilizing the model proposed by Cruz et al. (1989) together with the model proposed by Eberhart & Russel (1966), it was evidenced that the genetic classes formed by three-way hybrids and double hybrids, beyond high productivities, showed high adaptability and responsiveness, as on favorable as well as on unfavorable environments, when compared to the genetic classes formed by varieties and <b>intervarietal</b> <b>hybrids</b> evaluated on this experiment...|$|R

The varieties represent germplasms adapted to different areas of Brazil, used in the breeding program at the National Maize and Sorghum Research Center at Sete Lagoas, MG. The joint analysis of variance for ear weight showed significance (P < 0, 01) for environments, entries, varieties, heterosis, mean heterosis, variety heterosis, specific heterosis, environments x entries and environments x varieties. The average yield of the varieties varied from 2, 322 to 7, 704 kg/ha, while for the <b>intervarietal</b> <b>hybrids</b> the variation was from 4, 112 to 8, 363 kg/ha.

The performance of the <b>intervarietal</b> <b>hybrid</b> BIO 4 was superior to all double and three-waycross hybrids and outmatched the single-cross hybrids by 43 %. In terms of stability, BIO 2 was more stable than BIO 4, whichis desirable, but biological stability, which is not necessarily desirable, was also observed, since the yield was below theenvironmental mean. The graphical GGE biplot analysis was superior to the AMMI 1 since a greater portion of the sum ofsquares of GE and G+GE was captured and the predictive accuracy was higher.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a participatory maize breeding {{program that is}} a collaborative project between Birs, Agricultural University and the KRlBHCO Indo-British Rain fed Farming Project (East). At {{the beginning of the}} project, a base population was produced in Ihe rainy season of 1997 by making nine crosses between three yellow-endospermed flint varieties (Suwan, Birsa Makka, and Chandan) and three white endospermed flint varieties (GDRM 187, Shweta, and Rudarpur local). The parental varieties were selected either because farmers in the project area had accepted them or because they contributed complementary) trails to the population. The population has been randomly mated for five cycles by hilI-planting seed derived from the original nine crosses and detasseling 50 % of the plants. After the initial random mating, each cycle was planted from pale yellow grains that should be heterozygous at the locos controlling endosperm color. Three composite varieties have been extracted from cycles three and fount by random mating of early-maturing plants (75 to 80 days) with either yellow or white grains. Preliminary results show that these populations are superior to local checks for multiple traits. lntervarietal hybrids were also made from farmer-preferred varieties. Farmer-managed participatory research (FAMPAR) trials conducted in the rainy season. Of 1998 showed that farmers preferred the BM 1 x Suwan <b>intervarietal</b> <b>hybrid</b> to the local varieties.

Root pulling resistance, measured before and after anthesis, and dates of anthesis were obtained at two locations near Ames in 1978, 1979, and 1980. Yield, number of ears per plant, and root lodging were measured in 1978, 1979, and 1980 at Dayton, where the trapcrop technique was used to enhance the level of infestation of corn rootworms (Diabrotica species). Variance components, heritabilities, means, and phenotypic and genotypic correlations among traits were estimated for individual and combined analyses;Decreases in genotypic variability, as correlated responses to selection for <b>intervarietal</b> <b>hybrid</b> yield, were detected for root strength, yield, and days to anthesis. Comparisons between variance component estimates of BSSS and BSCB 1 suggested that inbreeding depression was more severe in BSCB 1. Population means for yield and ears per plant increased because of reciprocal recurrent selection, and the observed increases, as affected by stress conditions at Dayton, were discussed. Changes in root strength between C 0 and C 8 populations, as influenced by changes in days-to-anthesis and by selection for favorable alleles, were discussed;Incorporation of pre-anthesis, S(, 1) family root strength evaluation in breeding programs was recommended for BSSSSC 0, BSCB 1 C 0, and BSCB 1 (R) C 8 because of the favorable associations between S(, 1) line yield and root strength, between pre- and post-anthesis root strength, and between root lodging resistance and root strength.

40|$|Abstract – We {{investigated}} the agronomic performance of super-sweet corn genotypes. Super-sweet corn genotypes were backcrossed with regionally adapted field varieties (CIMMYT 8 and Piranão 8). Eight morphological and yield-related traits were evaluated. A {{significant effect of}} interaction was observed between the five groups of genotypes (donor parents; super-sweet backcrossed parents; super-sweet intervarietal hybrids; common intervarietal corn hybrids; and field corn populations). Despite the low yield of genotype SH 2 Piranão, the hybrids resulting from interbreeding of the backcrossed parents {{for the improvement of}} super-sweet corn were promising. The agronomic performance of the super-sweet parents and their hybrids indicates the possibility of breeding lines with high genetic value to obtain single-cross hybrids and cultivars of super-sweet corn adapted to the northern region of the State of Rio de Janeiro.

The {{objective was to}} identify crosses with high yield potential and favorable agronomic characteristics, such as earliness and plant architecture. The following traits were evaluated: male and female flowering, plant height, ear height, and grain yield. Due to non-significant environmental effects, diallel analysis were performed using {{the mean of the}} two production systems. Carioca (375. 46), a local open-pollinated variety, and the improved open-pollinated variety BR 106 (731. 36) showed the highest estimates for general combining ability (GCA).

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to investigate heterosis and its components in 16 white grain maize populations presenting high quality protein. These populations were divided according to grain type {{in order to establish}} different heterosis groups. The crosses were carried out according to a partial diallel cross design among flint and dent populations. Seven agronomic traits were evaluated in three environments while four leaf diseases and incidence of corn stunt were evaluated in one. Least square procedure was applied to the normal equation X'Xb = X'Y, to estimate the model effects and their respective sum of squares. Among the heterosis components, in diallel analysis, significance for average heterosis in grain yield, number of days to female flowering and to all evaluated diseases was detected. Specific heterosis was significant for days to female flowering and resistance to Puccinia polysora. Results concerned to grain yield trait indicate that populations with superior performance in dent group, no matter what flint population group is used in crosses, tend to generate superior <b>intervarietal</b> <b>hybrids.</b> In decreasing order of preference, the dent type populations CMS 476, ZQP/B 103 and ZQP/B 101 and the flint type CMS 461, CMS 460, ZQP/B 104 and ZQP/B 102 are recommended to form composites. 200...|$|R

The experiment was carried out in a greenhouse with pots filled with vermiculite and Hoagland nutrient solution. A three-factor randomized complete block design was used with treatments arranged in a factorial scheme represented by: H 1 (Carioca x Eldorado) and H 2 (Palha Roxa ES × Sol da Manhã) intervarietal hybrids; plants inoculated or not with A. amazonense; and three nitrogen proportions and doses: 126 mg week - 1 of N(75 % NH 4 + : 25 % NO 3 -); 126 mg week- 1 of N (25 % NH 4 + : 75 % NO 3 -); and 12. 6 mg week- 1 of N(50 % NH 4 +: 50 % NO 3 -). After 25 days of growth the plant roots and shoots were separated for the determination of dry matter production, total N and P content, nitrate reductase and glutamine synthetase activity and total soluble sugars. The H 1 hybrid, considered more efficient in preliminary field evaluations, produced greater dry matter and was more efficient in Nand P utilization. In plants that received the highest N dose, independently of the predominance of the ammoniacal or nitric forms, the N (roots and shoots) and P (shoots) accumulation as well as the P utilization index were higher. Under the predominance of the ammonium-N plants grew more and the glutamine synthetase activity was increased, while the concentration of root total soluble sugars was lowered.

The maximum yield of IR 8 has been reduced by about 2 Mg ha- 1 during the past 30 yr. Empirical breeding for population improvement within the indica germplasm has in the maintenance of rice yield potential in the tropics of about 10 Mg ha- 1. To break the yield barrier, several approaches are being explored. These include {{development of a new}} plant type (NPT) with low tillering capacity and large panicles from tropical japonica germplasm and exploitation of heterosis through <b>intervarietal</b> and intersubspecific <b>hybrids.</b> Hybrid rice between indicas increased yield potential by about 9 % under the tropical conditions. The higher yield potential of indica/indica hybrids compared with indica inbred cultivars was attributed to the greater biomass production rather than harvest index. New plant type breeding has not yet improved yield potential due to poor grain filling and low biomass production. Factors that cause poor grain filling and low biomass production of the NPT lines have been identified. Selecting parents with good grain filling traits, introduction of indica genes into NPT’s tropical japonica back- ground, and a refinement of the original NPT design are expected to improve the performance of the NPT lines. Further enhancement in yield potential may be possible from use of intersubspecific heterosis between indica and NPT lines...|$|R
