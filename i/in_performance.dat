5|$|At age 16 Mendelssohn {{wrote his}} String Octet in E-flat major, the first work which showed the full {{power of his}} genius.

The Overture is perhaps the earliest example of a concert overture– that is, a piece not written deliberately to accompany a staged performance, but to evoke a literary theme <b>in</b> <b>performance</b> on a concert platform; this was a genre which became a popular form in musical Romanticism.|$|E
