5|$|Ross {{declined}} {{to become the}} first Texas governor to run for a third term, and left office on January 20, 1891. During his four years in office, he vetoed only ten bills, and pardoned 861 people. Compared to other Texas governors, these are small numbers; Governor Miriam A. Ferguson granted 1161 pardons <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>two</b> <b>years.</b>|$|E
5|$|Successful mining {{took time}} and capital, {{particularly}} once {{most of the}} timber around the Klondike had been cut down. A realistic mining operation required $1,500 ($1.2 million) for wood to be burned to melt the ground, along with around $1,000 ($800,000) to construct a dam, $1,500 ($1.2 million) for ditches and up to $600 ($480,000) for sluice boxes, a total of $4,600. The attraction of the Klondike to a prospector, however, was that when gold was found, it was often highly concentrated. Some of the creeks in the Klondike were fifteen times richer in gold than those in California, and richer still than those in South Africa. <b>In</b> <b>just</b> <b>two</b> <b>years,</b> for example, $230,000 ($184 million) worth of gold was brought up from claim 29 on the Eldorado Creek.|$|E

5|$|Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! is {{credited}} {{as being a}} defining moment in Hindi cinema's box office history, {{and the beginning of}} a revolution in the Indian film distribution system. When it was released, cinema was in decline in India due to improved cable television, home video, and film piracy. The film was originally released in {{only a small number of}} theatres that agreed to upgrade their facilities. Due to widespread demand for the film, many other theatres upgraded in order to get the film. Although ticket prices were raised, the upgraded theatres brought people back who had been lost to television. Also, the film's lack of vulgarity was a sign to middle-class family patrons that they could return to the theatre. This film, in addition to the following year's Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, contributed to an increase in Indian cinema attendance of 40% <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>two</b> <b>years.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{industrialisation}} of Hong Kong was rapid from 1963 through 1970. Pre-existing industries {{continued to}} prosper, while new industries emerged and blossomed as well. The number of factories increased 1.67 {{times and the}} number of workers increased by 1.15 times. The number of factories and workers in 1970 were 16,507 and 549,000 respectively. The latter took up over 40% of the city's employment structure. The value of domestic exports continued to rise, and <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>two</b> <b>years,</b> rose by 2.72 times to HK$12,347,000,000.

25|$|The Royal Lao Army (RLA) reluctantly {{carried out}} its mission until it met with stiff resistance. At that point, {{they tended to}} flee rather than fight. As {{fighting}} occurred throughout December 1963, two elite RLA units, the 11th and 55th Parachute Battalions, were rendered ineffective by the communists, and by a faulty parachute drop. A battalion of volunteers was also dispersed by the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN). The Royal Lao Armed Forces (FAR) ended the operation in early 1964, having {{lost control of the}} Nakay Plateau to the communists. This, following the Battle of Luang Namtha, resulted in two disastrous defeats <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> for the Royal Lao Government (RLG).|$|E
25|$|But {{these efforts}} {{have not been}} as {{successful}} as hoped. Out of necessity most of the fleet, 330 standard bus equivalents out of 506, were replaced <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> in 1985-6. (Standard bus equivalents factor the 30-foot and 60-foot into their equivalent capacity in 40-foot buses). And seven years passed without any new buses coming on board before Muni started its next full diesel fleet replacement cycle in 1999. This was fourteen years after the previous cycle instead of the twelve years that buses are designed to last. Muni is now aware that they must expect to keep diesel buses past their design life and have also found that funds granted for mid-life rebuilds require that the buses be kept longer still. As the fleet replacement cycle begins again in 2013, Muni has arranged for life-extending rebuilds of 142 buses, by count over 30% of the fleet.|$|E

25|$|While chronic {{budget deficits}} (exacerbated during the {{dictatorship}} by growing tax evasion and military spending) accounted for around half the new debt, the remainder originated in banking deregulation enacted in 1977 {{and in a}} crawling peg enacted in 1978 that by 1980 made the peso {{one of the most}} overvalued currencies in the world. At least US$20 billion borrowed by private parties from foreign banks <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> were wired to offshore banks by 1981, around US$15 billion of which was absorbed into the public debt the following year. The total cost of these bailouts rose to US$23 billion {{by the time they were}} curtailed in 1985. These costs included bailouts for two firms in which Martínez de Hoz was the chief shareholder: the insolvent CIADE electric utility (US$395 million) and steel maker Acindar (US$649 million). At least one Martínez de Hoz subordinate who objected to the CIADE bailout (Juan Carlos Casariego) joined the ranks of the disappeared in 1977.|$|E

[...] John Payne of The Washington Post wrote, [...] "Depending on your point of view, Terra Nova is either a stripped-down Mechwarrior or a souped-up Doom." [...] However, he stated that it was enjoyable regardless of which perspective was taken. While he described the game's animation as [...] "fluid", he found its graphics in general to be [...] "fairly blocky, even at a distance". He finished his review by stating that the game [...] "requires more practice than action fans are used to" [...] but provides [...] "a nice payoff". Next Generation Magazine wrote, [...] "Looking Glass has always been known for breaking the barriers of conventional gameplay, and it has done it again with Terra Nova". The magazine considered the game to be [...] "an all around stunning effort".|$|E

This meant that Sanborn's map business was being valued at [...] "minus $20." [...] Buffett eventually purchased 23% of the company's outstanding shares as an activist investor, obtaining a seat for himself on the Board of Directors, and allied with other dissatisfied shareholders to control 44% of the shares.
