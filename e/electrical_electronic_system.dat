40|$|The {{automotive}} industry has seen enormous {{growth in the}} size and complexity of <b>electrical</b> and <b>electronic</b> <b>system</b> architectures. As complexity increases the problem of diagnosing faults in a vehicle's <b>electrical</b> and <b>electronic</b> <b>systems</b> is becoming increasingly difficult. Many faults are {{as a result of}} system-level disturbances or interactions that are difficult to interpret and diagnose using existing component-level diagnostics which have been traditionally focused on mechanical system diagnostics. The problem of rising complexity is exacerbated by increasing in-service warranty periods with some automotive OEMs now offering 5 or 7 year, or even life-time warranties. This paper discusses the need for a new system-level approach to the management of faults in a vehicle's networked <b>electronic</b> <b>systems</b> and how this might be achieved by using the data that flows over a vehicle's data networks. This paper compares different industry approaches to system-level health monitoring of complex distributed computing environments and presents a proposal for the application of health monitoring to an automotive <b>electrical</b> and <b>electronic</b> architecture. © 2011 IEEE...|$|R

UDC does not act as protection device, it can only simplify the troubleshooting process. The current systems are basically provided with protection design in terms of handling over or under voltage and current shot but after occurrence of fault scenario, the diagnosis steps to identify the fault will tend to take time. In such scenarios UDC gives clear cut data which indicates the cause for the fault occurrence. In any high end <b>electrical</b> and <b>electronic</b> <b>system</b> voltage, current and temperature are the basic primary parameters to be considered on fault occurrence.
