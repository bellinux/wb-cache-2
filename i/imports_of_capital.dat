During this period, the Government of Zimbabwe changed its economic policy from a government controlled economy to a one based on a free-market economy. The study uses a variety of analytical tools including Cointegration analysis, Granger causality tests, Vector Autoregressive (VAR), and Impulse Response Functions. The study sets four hypotheses for testing {{the impact of the}} import structure on economic growth (GDP); (i) whether <b>imports</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> and intermediate goods positively affect economic growth, (ii) whether GDP and imports are cointegrated, (iii) whether there is a bi-directional causality between imports and growth, and (iv) whether investment (FDI and GDI), and Human Capital (Labour) positively affect economic growth.

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{permanent}} real depreciation on a country's capital stock is uncertain. Whether total capital stock rises or falls {{depends on how}} depreciation affects aggregate demand, the real interest rate, and especially the <b>import</b> content <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> goods. In the long run, the capital stock {{can be expected to}} rise in traded goods and fall in nontraded goods. Despite this long-run ambiguity, anticipated changes in real exchange rate have a predictable effect on the dynamics <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> accumulation. They provide an incentive for speculative rellocation of investment over time, so they can greatly distort the timing of investments. In the framework of this paper, the time profile of investment is related to how financially open an economy is and to the <b>import</b> content <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> goods. When a real depreciation is expected, an investment boom is likely to develop if the <b>import</b> content <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> goods is high relative to the degree <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> mobility: the anticipated depreciation promotes flight into foreign goods. Conversely, with high capital mobility, the opposite investment pattern is likely to emerge, as the anticipated depreciation promotes flight into foreign assets.

40|$|This {{paper is}} based on an {{economic}} analysis of Libya’s imports during the period 1970 - 2005, with special reference to the <b>imports</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> goods and its impact on economic growth. In addition, the paper investigates the process of adjustment of imported intermediate inputs IMD, in the level of domestic economic growth GDPG, INF (Inflation) approximated by consumer prices, and RER the real exchange rate of Libyan Dinar against US$. The aim is to provide estimates of the aggregate demand of intermediate inputs imports in Libya, applying standard econometric techniques complemented by appropriate diagnostic tests based on recent and by now widely used dynamic modeling and cointegration techniques. As well as the paper tends to estimate the independent variables elasticity stated above for Libya’s imported intermediate inputs. Consequently, by using Augmented Dickey fuller tests (ADF) for stationarity and Johanson tests for cointegration, and granger causality test, results indicate that most variables are stationary in first difference, and in testing cointegration indicate long run relationship among all variables. The findings derived from the estimated econometric model are generally statistically meaningful. They show that the EU is the main supplier of intermediate goods to Libya. In addition, the results indicate that <b>imports</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> goods and raw materials which consist more than 70 % of total imports have played a crucial impact in the diversification of the Libyan economy by increasing the contribution of the non oil sector...|$|E
