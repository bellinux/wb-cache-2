The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the effect of the mixture equivalence ratio and turbulence intensity on the <b>flame</b> <b>kernel</b> and flow field interlinks in partially premixed natural gas flames. Three jet equivalence ratios of 1, 1. 5, and 2 are considered at values of jet velocities in the range from 10 to 20 m/s. This study was done under constant degree of partial premixing. A pulsed Nd: YAG laser is used for the flame ignition, and the turbulent flow field is captured at several time intervals from ignition using two-dimensional Planar Imaging Velocimetry (PIV). The mean flow field doesn’t influence with the <b>flame</b> <b>kernel</b> propagation. The turbulent flow field indicates an increase in the global turbulence intensity in flames associated with the kernel propagation in comparison with the isothermal case. The jet equivalence ratio of one enhances the <b>flame</b> <b>kernel</b> propagation and it gives the highest rate of kernel propagation.

40|$|The paper reports an {{activity}} aiming at characterizing cycle-to-cycle variability (CCV) of the spark-ignition (SI) {{process in a}} high performance engine. The numerical simulation of spark-ignition and of early <b>flame</b> <b>kernel</b> evolution are major challenges, mainly due to the time scales of the spark discharge process and to the reduced spatial scales of <b>flame</b> <b>kernel.</b> Typical mesh resolutions are insufficient to resolve the process and a dedicated treatment has to be provided at a subgrid level if the ignition process is to be properly modelled. The focus of this work is on the recent ISSIM-LES (Imposed Stretch Spark-Ignition Model) ignition model, {{which is based on}} an extension of the flame surface density (FSD) transport equation for a dedicated <b>flame</b> <b>kernel</b> treatment at subgrid scales. The FSD equation is solved immediately after spark discharge. The interaction of the <b>flame</b> <b>kernel</b> with the flow field is fully accounted for since spark formation and a transition is provided from ignition to propagation phase. The comparison is carried out with the AKTIM-Euler ignition model in terms of flame interaction with the flow field (e. g. arc convection, flame blow-off, flame holder effect). A multiple cycle LES activity provided a set of cycle-resolved conditions for spark-ignition comparisons, and the <b>flame</b> <b>kernel</b> development is carefully analyzed for the two ignition models {{on a wide range of}} thermo-physical conditions.

The results showed that increased spark power resulted in an increased growth rate, where the effect of short duration breakdown sparks was found to persist for times of the order of milliseconds. The effectiveness of increased spark power was found to be less at high turbulence and high dilution conditions. Increased spark power had a greater effect on the 0 - 5 mm burn time than on the 5 - 13 mm burn time, {{in part because of the}} effect of breakdown energy on the initial size of the <b>flame</b> <b>kernel.</b> And finally, when spark power was increased by shortening the spark duration while keeping the effective energy the same there was a significant increase in the misfire rate, however when the spark power was further increased by increasing the breakdown energy the misfire rate dropped to zero. The results also showed that fluctuations in local mixture strength due to incomplete fuel-air mixing cause the <b>flame</b> <b>kernel</b> surface to become wrinkled and distorted; and that the amount of wrinkling increases as the degree of incomplete fuel-air mixing increases. Incomplete fuel-air mixing was also found to result in a significant increase in cyclic variations in the <b>flame</b> <b>kernel</b> growth.

40|$|Simultaneous {{high-speed}} fuel fluorescence and particle image velocimetry {{measurements are}} combined with spark discharge measurements {{for the first}} time to identify the cause of misfire and partial burn cycles in a spray-guided spark-ignited direct-injection engine. Spark ignition is studied for stratified charge operation under a range of external dilution levels (0 % - 26 % nitrogen). Available spark energy is characterized for a wide range of well-controlled homogeneous gas-phase fuel-air mixtures (Φ = 0. 0 - 2. 9) and flow conditions (|V| = 1 - 10 m/s) that are characteristic for the spark energy under stratified charge conditions. Under stratified charge conditions, the engine operates with an optimized end-of-injection and spark timing that provides stable engine operation with the occurrence of rare misfire and partial burn cycles. Fuel concentration and flow field measurements are analyzed closest to the spark plug and in the entire field of view (38 mm x 30 mm) within the combustion chamber to diagnose the role of fuel distribution, flow field, and spark energy on misfire, partial burn, and well-burning cycles. Results show that abnormal spark behavior is not the cause of the misfire and partial burn cycles and a model is used to show that all cycles have sufficient electrical spark energy to ignite the flammable mixture nearby the spark plug. The high-speed fuel and flow images reveal that a <b>flame</b> <b>kernel</b> is developed for all cycles.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) {{is used to}} {{investigate}} the development of turbulent premixed <b>flame</b> <b>kernels</b> {{during the early stages}} of growth typical of the period following spark ignition. Two distinct aspects of this phase are considered: the interaction of the expanding kernel with a field of decaying turbulence, and the chemical and thermo-diffusive response of the flame for different fresh-gas compositions. In {{the first part of the}} study, three-dimensional, repeated simulations with single-step chemistry are used to generate ensemble statistics of global flame growth. The surface-conditioned mean fluid-velocity magnitude is found to vary significantly across different isosurfaces of the reaction progress variable, and this is shown to lead to a bias in the distribution of the Surface Density Function (SDF) around the developing flame. Two-dimensional simulations in an extended domain indicate that this effect translates into a similar directional bias in the Flame Surface Density (FSD) at later stages in the kernel development. Properties of the fresh gas turbulence decay are assessed from an independent, non-reacting simulation database. In the second part of this study, two-dimensional simulations with a detailed 68 -step reaction mechanism are used to investigate the thermo-diffusive response of pure methane-air, and hydrogen-enriched methane-air flames. The changes in local and global behaviour due to the different laminar flame characteristics, and the response of the flames to strain and curvature are examined at different equivalence ratios and turbulence intensities. Mechanisms leading to flame quenching are discussed and the effect of mean flame curvature is assessed through comparison with an equivalent planar flame.

Microwave enhancement was evaluated {{on the basis of}} several parameters including flame development time (FDT) (time for 0 - 10 % of total net heat release), flame rise time (FRT) (time for 10 - 90 % of total net heat release), total net heat release, <b>flame</b> <b>kernel</b> growth rate, <b>flame</b> <b>kernel</b> size, and ignitability limit extension.

The addition of microwaves to a capacitive discharge spark reduced FDT and increased the <b>flame</b> <b>kernel</b> size for all equivalence ratios tested and resulted in increases in the spatial flame speed for sufficiently lean flames.

In addition the minimum ignition laser energy (MILE) has been investigated for both fuels. Moreover, the flame stability maps for both fuels are also investigated and analyzed. The flame kernels are generated using Nd:YAG pulsed laser and propagated in a partially premixed turbulent jet. The flow field is measured using 2 -D PIV technique. Five cases have been selected for each fuel covering different values of Reynolds number within a range of 6100 - 14400, at a mean equivalence ratio of 2 and a certain level of partial premixing. The MILE increases by increasing the equivalence ratio. Near stoichiometric the energy density is independent on the jet velocity while in rich conditions it increases by increasing the jet velocity. The stability curves show four distinct regions as lifted, attached, blowout, and a fourth region either an attached flame if ignition occurs near the nozzle or lifted if ignition occurs downstream. LPG flames are more stable than NG flames. This is consistent with the higher values of the laminar flame speed of LPG. The <b>flame</b> <b>kernel</b> propagation speed is affected by both turbulence and chemistry.

High-speed imaging {{was used to}} visualise the formation of auto-ignition kernels in the flow, and to analyse {{the conditions under which}} temporary stabilisation of the <b>flame</b> <b>kernels</b> occurred. The experiments were carried out at temperatures of 800 - 850 K, pressures of 0. 8 - 1. 2 MPa and an equivalence ratio of phi = 0. 25. Measurements of the autoignition delays yielded values in the range of tau = 210 - 447 ms. The autoignition delay results indicated that, over the range of conditions studied, ignition delays reduced with decreasing pressure. This observation contradicted homogeneous gas-phase kinetic calculations, which predicted an increase in autoignition delay with decreasing pressure. If the kinetic model was altered to include surface reactions at the reactor walls, the calculations could be qualitatively reconciled with the experimental data, suggesting that wall reactions had a significant influence on autoignition delays.

Numerical simulations using the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) technique have been carried out for a stagnant, stoichiometric propane-air mixture. The test case chosen for the present study is the experiments of small-scale Sydney explosion chamber [1].

In this paper, we show that ignition can also be achieved using a single nanosecond pulse corona discharge generated under a very strong overvoltage. Experiments were conducted in air / propane and air / n-heptane mixtures. For such a discharge, ignition of n-heptane requires less released electrical energy than propane and lean mixtures can be completely burnt with reasonable energy values of several tens of mJ. Extended <b>flame</b> <b>kernels</b> or several points of ignition can be induced. For n-heptane, we have developed a simplified combustion model using a reduced mechanism, enabling us to suggest a kinetic explanation for ignition at a low temperature.

The aim of the present work is to understand these interaction effects on the flame surface annihilation and extinction of lean premixed flames, interacting with near isotropic turbulence. As an example case, lean premixed H- 2 -air mixture is considered so as to enable inclusion of detailed chemistry effects in Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS). The work is carried out in two phases namely, statistically planar <b>flames</b> and ignition <b>kernel,</b> both interacting with near isotropic turbulence, using the recently proposed Flame Particle Tracking (FPT) technique. Flame particles are surface points residing and commoving with an iso-scalar surface within a premixed flame. Tracking flame particles allows us to study the evolution of propagating surface locations uniquely identified with time. In this work, using DNS and FPT we study the flame speed, reaction rate and transport histories of such flame particles residing on iso-scalar surfaces. An analytical expression for the local displacement flame speed (SO is derived, and the contribution of transport and chemistry on the displacement flame speed is identified. An examination {{of the results of the}} planar case leads to a conclusion that the cause of variation in S-d may be attributed to the effects of turbulent transport and heat release rate.

This efficiency improvement hinges on the ability of the engine to detonate fuel/air mixture through deflagration-to-detonation transitions at 60 to 100 times a second. A major breakthrough in reducing the cycle time of a pulse detonation device is {{through the use of a}} Transient Plasma Ignition (TPI) system vice the normal Capacitive Discharge Ignition (CDI) system. The TPI system deposits an equivalent amount of energy as the CDI system but in a fraction of the time and over a larger combustor volume.

Laser-induced breakdown was achieved by focusing a 532 -nm nanosecond pulse from a Q-switched Nd-YAG laser. An anti-reflection-coated lens with a focal length of 100 mm was used. The results obtained from an intensified high-speed and PIV CCD camera and a Cassegrain optics system coupled to an ICCD spectrometer provided information about the formation of laser-induced plasma and its transition to a <b>flame</b> <b>kernel</b> and a self-sustaining flame. The localization of the kernel and its time development were reproducible. Two types of flame fronts develop: one that expands against the flow direction, and one that moves with the flow.

40|$|International audienceDirect {{numerical}} simulations (DNS) are {{ideally suited}} to investigate in detail turbulent reacting ﬂows in simple geometries. When considering such problems as pollutant emission or stability limits, detailed models must generally be employed to describe the chemical processes with sufﬁcient accuracy. Due to the huge cost of such simulations, they have been mostly restricted to two-dimensional conﬁgurations up to now, leading to unsolved questions concerning the generality of the obtained results. We have recently developed a three-dimensional DNS code leading to reasonable computing times, thanks to the low-Mach- number approximation and to a new chemistry reduction technique. This code is used here to investigate the evolution of premixed methane/air <b>ﬂame</b> <b>kernels</b> placed in a homogeneous isotropic turbulence ﬁeld. This situation typiﬁes the initial ﬂame development after spark ignition in a gas turbine or an internal combustion engine. Laminar reference computations are carried out in one and two dimensions and are compared with turbulent results obtained in two and three dimensions. Evolution of ﬂame surface area, stretch rate, and ﬂame front curvature are in particular presented and show considerable differences between two-dimensional and three-dimensional computations. The interest of repeating the computations to increase the statistical validity of the results is demonstrated in two dimensions, but is not sufﬁcient to explain the discrepancy obtained with the three-dimensional computation. Further three-dimensional sim- ulations are nevertheless needed to quantify more precisely the observed changes (slower increase of the equivalent radius, higher stretch rate, and curvature shifted toward positive values) ...|$|R
40|$|Dynamics of <b>flame</b> <b>kernel</b> {{evolution}} {{with and}} without external energy addition has been investigated analytically and numerically. Emphasis {{is placed on the}} effects of radiation heat loss, ignition power and Lewis number on the correlation and transition between the initial <b>flame</b> <b>kernel,</b> the self-extinguishing flame, the flame ball, the outwardly propagating spherical flame and the propagating planar flame. The present study extends previous results by bridging the theories of the non-adiabatic stationary flame balls and travelling flames and allowing rigorous consideration of radiation heat losses. The results show that the effects of radiation heat loss {{play an important role in}} flame regimes and flame transition and result in a new isolated self-extinguishing flame. Furthermore, it is found that radiation heat losses significantly increase the critical ignition radius and result in three different dependences of the minimum ignition power on the Lewis number. Comparisons between the results from the transient numerical simulation and those from the quasi-steady state analysis show a good agreement. The results suggest that prediction of flame initiation without appropriate consideration of radiation is not acceptable...|$|E
40|$|A {{detailed}} {{understanding of}} the processes associated Midi spark ignition, {{as a first step}} during combustion, is of great importance fur clean operation of spark ignition engines. In the past 10 years. a growing concern for environmental protection, including low emission of pollutants, has increased the interest in the numerical simulation of ignition phenomena to guarantee successful <b>flame</b> <b>kernel</b> development even for lean mixtures. However. the process of spark ignition in a combustible mixture is not yet fully understood. The use of detailed reaction mechanisms, combined with electrodynamical modeling of the spark. is necessary to optimize spark ignition for lean mixtures. This work presents the simulation of the coupling of flow, chemical reactions, and transport with discharge processes including ionization in order to investigate the development of a stable <b>flame</b> <b>kernel</b> initiated by all electrical spark in methane/air mixtures. A transport model taking into account the interactions of charged particles has been incorporated in the flow model. This model is based on the Chapman-Enskog theory with an extension for polyatomic gases and considers resonant charge transfer and ambipolar diffusion for the computation of the transport coefficients. A two-dimensional code to simulate the early stages of flame development, shortly after the breakdown discharge, has been developed. The modeling includes an equation for the electrical field. The spark plasma channel left behind by the breakdown is incorporated into the initial conditions Due to the fast expansion of the plasma channel. a complicated flowfield develops after the emission of a shock wave by the expanding channel. The second phase, that is, the development of a propagating flame and the <b>flame</b> <b>kernel</b> expansion, can last up to several milliseconds and is dominated by diffusive processes and chemical reactions...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} an {{experimental}} investigation of rare misfire and partial burn cycles in a spray-guided spark-ignited direct-injection optical engine. Spark discharge energy, discharge duration, flame imaging, velocity and equivalence ratio were measured every crank angle degree. Imaging was performed using high-speed 2 -D particle image velocimetry (PIV) and planar laser inducted fluorescence (PLIF). The engine was operated near its optimum but produced rare and random partial burn and misfire cycles. Spark energy and spark duration for the partial burn and misfire cycles fell {{within the range}} of those for the well-burned cycles, with a slight bias toward low-energy, short-duration discharges, indicating no abnormal spark discharge events. PIV and PLIF measurements extracted from a 4 mm _ 4 mm region adjacent to and downstream of the spark plug at spark timing revealed that the partial burn and misfire cycles occur under lean mixtures and low velocities, but still {{within the range of}} values for the well-burned cycles. PIV and PLIF images of partial burn and misfire cycles were compared to well-burned cycles, which had similar velocities and equivalence ratios near the spark plug at the onset of spark. Observations of the fuel distribution and flame areas for the partial burns and misfires showed that an early <b>flame</b> <b>kernel</b> was always formed, but failed to develop sufficiently to propagate to the fuel in the bowl. A <b>flame</b> <b>kernel</b> arriving late within the piston bowl found significantly leaner conditions and the mixture was not fully consumed leading to a partial burn. For misfire cycles, the mixture in the measurement plane was significantly leaner surrounding the <b>flame</b> <b>kernel,</b> which disappeared shortly after the spark discharge. It is concluded that the partial burns and misfires are not the result of failed ignition, but failure during the flame propagation process...|$|E
40|$|The {{stabilization}} {{region of}} diffusion flames {{of natural gas}} in a hot, oxygen-lean coflow generated by the Delft Jet-in-hot-Coflow (DJHC) burner was studied using an intensified high-speed camera. Analysis of the resulting frames showed that auto-ignition is the dominant mechanism stabilizing the <b>flame.</b> Ignition <b>kernels</b> are formed randomly and are convected downstream while growing in size and connecting to other kernels. The statistics of these processes were studied, showing that ignition probabilities become larger for larger coflow temperatures. No strong influence of coflow temperature on flame propagation speeds is found. A simple mathematical model in 1 -D is proposed, describing the probability of finding a burning flame at a certain axial location as function of ignition probabilities and flame propagation speed...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{high speed}} images of OH-PLIF at 10. kHz simultaneously with 2 D PIV (particle image velocimetry) measurements collected {{along the entire}} length of an inverse diffusion flame with circumferentially arranged methane fuel jets. For a fixed fuel flow rate, the central air jet Re was varied, leading to four air to fuel velocity ratios, namely Vr = 20. 7, 29, 37. 4 and 49. 8. A double flame structure could be observed composed of a lower fuel entrainment region and an upper mixing and intense combustion region. The entrainment region was enveloped by an early OH layer, and then merged through a very thin OH neck to an annular OH layer located at the shear layer of the air jet. The two branches of this annular OH layer broaden as they moved downstream and eventfully merged together. Three types of events were observed common to all flames: breaks, closures and growing kernels. In upstream regions of the flames, the breaks were counterbalanced by flame closures. These breaks in OH signal were found to occur at locations where locally high velocity flows were impinging on the flame. As the Vr increased to 37. 4, the OH layers became discontinuous over the downstream region of the flame, and these regions of low or no OH moved upstream. With further increases in Vr, these OH pockets act as <b>flame</b> <b>kernels,</b> growing as they moved downstream, and became the main mechanism for flame re-ignition. Along the flame length, the direction of the two dimensional principle compressive strain rate axis exhibited a preferred orientation of approximately 45 ° with respect to the flow direction. Moreover, the OH zones were associated with elongated regions of high vorticity. © 2013 Elsevier Inc...|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} 10 -kHz images of OH-PLIF simultaneously with 2 -D PIV measurements in an inverse methane diffusion flame. Under a constant fuel flow rate, the central air jet Re was varied, leading to air to fuel velocity ratio, Vr, to vary from 8. 3 to 66. 5. Starting from Vr = 20. 7, the flame is commonly characterized by three distinct zones. The {{length of the}} lower fuel entrainment region is inversely proportional to Vr. The flames investigated resemble a string shear layer confining this zone, and converging into the second distinct region, the flame neck zone. The third region {{is the rest of}} the flame, which spreads in a jet-like manner. The inverse diffusion flames exhibit varying degrees of partial premixing, depending upon on the velocity ratio Vr, and this region of partial premixing evolves into a well-mixed reaction zone along the flame centerline. The OH distribution correlated with the changes in the mean characteristics of the flow through reduction in the local Reynolds number due to heat release. The existence of a flame suppresses or laminarizes the turbulence at early axial locations and promotes fluctuations at the flame tip for flames with Vr < 49. 8. In addition, the flame jet width can be correlated to the OH distribution. In upstream regions of the flames, the breaks in OH are counterbalanced by flame closures and are governed by edge flame propagation. These local extinctions were found to occur at locations where large flow structures were impinging on the flame and are associated with a locally higher strain rate or correlated to the local high strain rates at the flame hole edges without this flow impinging. Another contributor to re-ignition was found to be growing <b>flame</b> <b>kernels.</b> As the <b>flames</b> approach global blow-off, these kernels become the main mechanism for re-ignition further downstream of the flames. At low Vr, laminarization within the early regions of the flame provides an effective shield, preventing the jet flow from penetrating through the flame. © Copyright © 2014 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC...|$|R
