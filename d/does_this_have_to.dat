5000|$|A recent {{criticism}} by Prof. Marcel van der Linden is as follows: [...] "Marx's thesis {{is based on}} two dubious assumptions, namely that labour needs to be offered for sale by {{the person who is}} the actual bearer and owner of such labour, and that the person who sells the labour sells nothing else. Why <b>does</b> <b>this</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be the case? Why can labour not be sold by a party other than the bearer? What prevents the person who provides labour (his or her own or that of somebody else) from offering packages combining the labour with labour means? And why can a slave not perform wage labour for his master at the estate of some third party?" [...] This difficulty was first noted in research conducted during the 1980s by Tom Brass, gathered together in his 1999 book. The buying and selling of human work effort can and has taken many more different forms than Marx acknowledges—especially in the area of services. A modern information society makes possible all kinds of new forms of hustling.|$|E

50|$|Eating {{disorders}} are also symbolic with {{the sociology of}} food. They represent how control (or lack thereof) someone can have over themselves {{about one of the}} things they need to live. Eating disorders do not limit themselves to anorexia. These disorders include bulimia and binge eating as well. Some people often use food a comfort, or even a reward. Or in other cases they see food as a negative thing to avoid, even though they need it for survival. The relationships with food that people carry is a very large subject that is very complex. From a sociological standpoint, media has a lot to do with this. Not only <b>does</b> <b>this</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> with the sociology of food, but it has to do with how the media represents society as a whole. Both men and women, but majority women, see the representation on the media, leading them to wanting to feel attractive. A lot of the time, this comes down the person’s relationship with food. When someone has a disorder like anorexia nervousa or bulimia, they have an intense fear of gaining weight, or just the “fatness” they feel they would get by consuming food. With bulimia, the fear is there, with the overcoming urge to binge. These disorders display the psychological relationships that people could have with food, and view it as a negative thing. They focus on the material look of themselves as opposed to needing food for energy and nourishment. This has a lot to do with overwhelming sexuality in the media. Girls, young women, and even men see how they “should” look according to the media, making them turn to desperate measures with these eating disorders.|$|E

On 26 February 2010, he participated in the 2010 Viña del Mar International Song Festival as one of the top performers. His performance was followed by Colombian singer Fanny Lu. One hour after Lus performance, a 8.8 magnitude massive earthquake affected the south-central regions of Chile. On social networks, Arjona was jokingly blamed, with remarks such as [...] "earthquakes go where he goes", making reference also to the earthquake felt in Mexico after the singer arrived. After the tour, Arjona announced his twelfth studio album, Poquita Ropa, which was released on 24 August 2010. It was preceded by the genre-mixing track [...] "Puente", an ode to Havana, Cubas largest and capital city. The song failed to break in the upper tier of Billboard charts, and was reportedly prohibited in Cuba. The album became his third to debut or reach No. 1 on the Top Latin Albums chart.

We may not know what these are yet, {{but that does not}} stop us from asking a number of {{questions}} about them. Example 1. 1. The cube and the octahedron. The cube has 8 vertices, 12 edges and 6 faces, while the octahedron has 6 vertices, 12 edges and 8 faces. Is this reversal in the number of faces in each dimension common? In the problem session you saw that v-e+f= 2 for 3 -polytopes. Is something similar true in higher dimensions? Are there other restrictions on the number of faces of each dimension? What is the most number of faces in each dimension if we fix the number of vertices and dimension? The least? What if we fix other numbers of faces in random dimensions? Notice that all of these questions involve counting faces of various dimensions. Another situation where these types of questions occur comes is hyperplane ar-rangements. A hyperplane of R d is any set of the form l − 1 v (c) = {x: v · x = c}, where v is a fixed vector in R d and c ∈ R. Consider the arrangement of 5 lines in Figure 1. How are they different?
