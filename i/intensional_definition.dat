To demonstrate the notion of a relation in extension Russell now embraced the notion of ordered couple: [...] "We may regard a relation ... as a class of couples ... the relation determined by φ(x, y) is the class of couples (x, y) for which [...] φ(x, y) is true".

50|$|A {{definition}} {{is a statement}} {{of the meaning of}} a term (a word, phrase, or other set of symbols). Definitions can be classified into two large categories, <b>intensional</b> <b>definitions</b> (which try to give the essence of a term) and extensional definitions (which proceed by listing the objects that a term describes). Another important category of definitions is the class of ostensive definitions, which convey the meaning of a term by pointing out examples. A term may have many different senses and multiple meanings, and thus require multiple definitions.|$|R
5000|$|As becomes clear, <b>intensional</b> <b>definitions</b> {{are best}} used when {{something}} has a clearly defined set of properties, {{and they work}} well for terms that have too many referents to list in an extensional definition. It is impossible to give an extensional definition for a term with an infinite set of referents, but an intensional one can often be stated concisely - there are infinitely many even numbers, impossible to list, but the term [...] "even numbers" [...] can be defined easily by saying that even numbers are integer multiples of two.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Intensional</b> <b>definition</b> {{also applies}} to rules or sets of axioms that define a set by {{describing}} a procedure for generating all of its members. For example, an <b>intensional</b> <b>definition</b> of square number can be [...] "any number that can be expressed as some integer multiplied by itself". The rule—"take an integer and multiply it by itself"—always generates members of the set of square numbers, no matter which integer one chooses, and for any square number, there is an integer that was multiplied by itself to get it.|$|E

The deductive approach to databases aims at extending with <b>intensional</b> <b>definitions</b> other database paradigms that describe applications extensionaUy. We first show how constructive specifications can be expressed with deduction rules, and how normative conditions can be defined using integrity constraints. We outline the principles of bottom-up and top-down query answering procedures and present the techniques used for integrity checking. We then argue that it is often desirable to manage with a database system not only database applications, but also specifications of system components. We present such meta-level specifications and discuss their advantages over conventional approaches. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{predicting}} the membership w. r. t. a target concept for individuals of Semantic Web knowledge bases can be {{cast as a}} concept learning problem, whose goal is to induce <b>intensional</b> <b>definitions</b> describing the available examples. However, the models obtained through the methods borrowed from Inductive Logic Programming e. g. Terminological Decision Trees, may be affected by two crucial aspects: the refinement operators for specializing the concept description to be learned and the heuristics employed for selecting the most promising solution (i. e. the concept description that describes better the examples). In this paper, we started to investigate the effectiveness of Terminological Decision Tree and its evidential version when a refinement operator available in DL-Learner and modified heuristics are employed. The evaluation showed an improvement {{in terms of the}} predictiveness...|$|R
40|$|There are two {{motivations for}} this paper. (i) In terminological {{systems in the}} {{tradition}} of KL-ONE the taxonomic and conceptual knowledge of a particular problem domain can be represented by so called concepts. The <b>intensional</b> <b>definitions</b> of these concepts can be analyzed and checked for plausibility using certain reasoning services (e. g. subsumption) that make the user conscious of some of the consequences of his definitions. A hybrid knowledge base can then rely on these checked definitions. In this paper a terminological formalism is embedded into the formalism of partial inductive definitions (PID) such that a flexible environment for experimenting with this kind of hybrid systems and the terminological formalism itself is obtained. (ii) Terminological formalisms provide (terminating) decision procedures for their reasoning services dealing with a restricted kind of quantification. Mapping these algorithms to PID improves the understanding of control and explicit quantification in PID...|$|R
50|$|Similarly, an <b>intensional</b> <b>definition</b> of a game, such as chess, {{would be}} {{the rules of the}} game; any game played by those rules must be a game of chess, and any game {{properly}} called a game of chess must have been played by those rules.|$|E
50|$|In {{logic and}} mathematics, an <b>intensional</b> <b>definition</b> gives {{the meaning of}} a term by specifying {{necessary}} and sufficient conditions for when the term should be used. In the case of nouns, this is equivalent to specifying the properties that an object needs to have in order to be counted as a referent of the term.|$|E
50|$|This {{is similar}} to an ostensive definition, in which one or more members of a set (but not {{necessarily}} all) are pointed out as examples. The opposite approach is the <b>intensional</b> <b>definition,</b> which defines by listing properties that a thing must have {{in order to be}} part of the set captured by the definition.|$|E
40|$|Process {{fragments}} are {{a cornerstone}} of process modeling in both Service Oriented Architecture and Business Process Management. The {{state of the art}} lacks shared, language agnostic definitions of the basic concepts and properties of process fragments. This absence of a common foundation for the research on process fragments hinders the comparison and reuse of the results {{in the state of the}} art, and renders impossible the reaching of agreed, <b>intensional</b> <b>definitions</b> of the different typologies of process fragments. The present work aims at filling this gap by providing a framework of language agnostic definitions of properties of the syntactic structure of process fragments based on the mereotopology of discrete space. Alongside familiar mereologic concepts like inclusion, overlap and disjointness, we cover fundamental concepts for process fragments like (dis) connection, selfconnectedness, borders, interiors and exteriors. Besides providing a foundation for further research on process fragments, we discuss the immediate application of the concepts defined in this work in the scope of the change management of process models...|$|R

40|$|Interoperability and {{integration}} of data sources are becoming ever more important issues as both, the amount of data {{and the number of}} data producers are growing. Interoperability not only has to resolve the differences in data structures, it also has to deal with semantic heterogeneity. Semantics refer to the meaning of data in contrast to syntax, which only defines the structure of the schema items (e. g., classes and attributes). We focus on the part of semantics related to the meanings of the terms used as identifiers in schema definitions. This paper presents an approach to integrate schemas from different communities, where each such community is using its own ontology. The approach is based on merging ontologies based on similarity relations among concepts of different ontologies. We present formal definitions of similarity relations based on <b>intensional</b> <b>definitions</b> and conclude the extensional consequences. The process of merging ontologies based on the detected similarity relations is discussed. The merged ontology is finally used to derive an integrated schema. The resulting schema can be used as the global schema in a federated database system...|$|R
50|$|The extensional {{definition}} of equality is not {{equivalent to the}} <b>intensional</b> <b>definition.</b> This {{can be seen in}} the example below. This inequivalence is created by considering lambda terms as values. In typed lambda calculus this problem is circumvented, because built-in types may be added to carry values that are in a canonical form and have both extensional and intensional equality.|$|E
5000|$|For example, an <b>intensional</b> <b>{{definition}}</b> of {{the word}} [...] "bachelor" [...] is [...] "unmarried man". This definition is valid because being an unmarried man is both a necessary condition and a sufficient condition for being a bachelor: it is necessary because one cannot be a bachelor without being an unmarried man, and it is sufficient because any unmarried man is a bachelor.|$|E
50|$|The {{two terms}} beta reduce to similar expressions. Still {{they are not}} alpha {{convertible}}, or even eta convertible (the latter follows because both terms are already in eta-long form). So according to the <b>intensional</b> <b>definition</b> of equality, the expressions are not equal. But if the two functions are applied to the same Church numerals they produce the same result, by the distributive law; thus they are extensionally equal.|$|E
40|$|NATO Conference on Terminology Management 19 - 20 November 2015 Are ISO Terminology Standards Fit for Terminology Management at the NATO? Hendrik J. Kockaert 1, 2 & Frieda Steurs 1, 2, 3 KU Leuven 1, University of the Free State 2, UCO 3 Abstract The NATO Terminology Office (NTO) advocates {{clear and}} {{unambiguous}} communication among its members and partners, following the NATO Policy for Standardization: "NATO documents must contain NATO agreed terminology. " It is the NATO Terminology Programme (NTP) that provides standardized terminology, stamped with the "NATO Agreed" status to all NATO terms.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel operator, {{based on the}} negation, for specializing the {{hypotheses}} inductively generated by any system that learns structural descriptions from positive and negative examples or, equivalently, learns <b>intensional</b> <b>definitions</b> of logical relations. Such a specializing operator adds the negation {{of one or more}} literals of a misclassified example to the Horn clause representation of an inconsistent hypothesis, after having properly turned constants into variables. The search for the literals to be added is firstly performed in a set named reduced base of consistent specializations and, in case of failure, it is extended to the augmented base of consistent specializations. Indeed, two theorems prove that clauses generated by adding literals in the former set preserve the consistency property and are most general specializations of the inconsistent hypothesis. On the contrary, the consistency property of clauses generated by adding literals in the latter set has to be checked on the misclassified example. The search strategy takes advantage {{of the structure of the}} set of the linked Horn clauses,, ordered by the generality relation (≤). Some clarifying examples and experimental results are also presented...|$|R
5000|$|De Queiroz has {{published}} several {{articles on the}} history and philosophy of biology, related primarily, but not exclusively, to his own theoretical and conceptual contributions. He published a paper {{early in his career}} proposing that the Darwinian Revolution in systematic biology was not a sudden event but rather an extended process that is not yet completed. [...] He has examined Charles Darwin’s writings on species and argued that his own ideas about how to achieve a unified species concept represent the ongoing development of the evolutionary view of species articulated by Darwin. [...] He has examined the class versus individual interpretations of species and clades in light of his work on phylogenetic definitions of taxon names, proposing that contrary to how those interpretations are commonly presented, they are not mutually exclusive, which suggests that {{the same is true of}} ostensive and <b>intensional</b> <b>definitions.</b> [...] He has argued that the philosopher Karl Popper’s concept of degree of corroboration is analogous to the likelihood ratio of nested hypotheses and that in phylogenetics the probability of the evidence given the background knowledge in the absence of the hypothesis of interest (a critical component of Popper’s [...] "Degree of Corroboration") is represented by the likelihood of a star tree.|$|R
5000|$|In {{at least}} one source, a [...] "class" [...] is a set in which an {{individual}} member can be recognized in {{one or both of}} two ways: a) it is included in an extensional definition of the whole set (a list of set members) b) it matches an <b>Intensional</b> <b>definition</b> of one set member.

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this {{dissertation}} is to offer both an interpretation {{to the theory of}} singular representations as presented by Leibniz in his writings from the 1680 ’s, as well as a hypothesis of a criticism made by Kant to what we take to be the cornerstones of such a theory. These cornerstones consist in (i) the Principle of Identity of Indiscernibles (ii) the Doctrine of the Complete Notion of the Individual Substance (iii) the <b>Intensional</b> <b>Definitions</b> of the Truth Values. Once the writings in which (ii) and (iii) are presented only began to be published in the XIX century, we argue in favor of the plausibility of such a hypothesis by means of logical arguments, which intend to show that Kant could have deduced (ii) and (iii) from Leibniz’ commitment to (i) {{as well as to the}} existence of a parfaite représentation of ordinary objects in the divine understanding, and historical arguments, which intend to show that Kant could have had access to both (ii) and (iii) and even ascribed these to Leibniz by means of Meier’s Auszug aus der Vernunftlehre and Wolff’s Philosophia Rationalis sive Logica. We will add to these, also textual arguments in order to show that there is in Kant’s philosophy not only a critique to (i), but also to (ii) e (iii), as well as an interpretation of what this criticism consists in...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{develops}} {{and tests}} a definition-oriented approach to concept analysis. In this approach, a computerized knowledge management system called CODE {{is used to}} help the terminologist carry out concept analysis specifically aimed at constructing <b>intensional</b> (Aristotelian) <b>definitions</b> for a terminological knowledge base (TKB). The approach is developed by first exploring what the literature {{has to say about}} the <b>intensional</b> terminological <b>definition</b> (ITD) as a process, a product, and a tool. The primary conclusion that arises from this exploration is that ITDs for co-concepts must be consistent in content and form, and must clearly indicate the place of their respective concepts in the concept system. Second, this thesis looks at how a specific feature of the CODE system, the Characteristic Comparison Matrix (CCM), can be enhanced to facilitate definition-oriented concept analysis. The result is a powerful, flexible feature that aids the terminologist in recording consistent characteristics and selecting characteristics for definition construction. Third, this thesis proposes enhancements to an existing general approach to concept analysis. These enhancements are based on definition research, knowledge of CODE, and introspection, supported by previous experience performing general concept analysis with the COGNITERM Project. The result is an approach which allows the terminologist to carry out concept analysis in a methodical manner, using CODE to create good, consistent ITDs for a TKB. This approach is tested by creating a TKB for the subject field of lasers (concentrating on 16 concepts), complete with ITDs. The approach works quite well, although it requires some minor modifications. The definitions are consistent and contain only that information necessary to distinguish co-concepts from one another and to indicate their place within a concept system. Although CODE is helpful in facilitating definition-oriented concept analysis, some enhancements to the technology would make it even more useful...|$|R
