Shields Road station was {{the largest of the}} three, sharing one of its platforms with Pollokshields station, which had been squeezed into {{the northern part of the}} complex, on the new track which had been laid to establish a link between Paisley and the Caledonian Railway’s proposed Glasgow Central station.|$|R

50|$|Apart from {{chastity}} cages, chastity belts of {{the so-called}} Florentine type also exist for men. As in the standard Florentine design, a circular horizontal band encircles the waist and a shield {{is attached to the}} front of the waist belt. The shield extends downwards to cover the genital areas of the wearer and is attached to the back of the waist belt. For male belts, a penis tube is secured behind the <b>front</b> <b>shield.</b> In some designs, the testicles are covered by special cages. Most high-security chastity belts are made out of stainless steel, although fiberglass composite belts have also been made. Most belt designs are secured with padlocks. The more secure designs have their padlocks' shackles hidden to make cutting the shackle difficult or impossible.|$|E
5000|$|Some light tanks {{such as the}} PT-76 are amphibious, {{typically}} being propelled in {{the water}} by hydrojets or by their tracks. In 1969, the U.S. Army rushed the new M551 Sheridan to Vietnam. This 17 ton light tank was built with an aluminium hull, steel turret and gun (although the 152 mm gun was called a [...] "launcher" [...] at the time), and could swim across bodies of water. The M551 upon arrival in Vietnam began replacing the M48A3 Patton in all cavalry squadrons, leaving only the M48A3 in the U.S. Army's three armored battalions in Vietnam, the 1/77th, 1/69th, and the 2/34th Armor. The Sheridan needed no modifications for river crossings, crewmen simply raised the cloth sides that were tucked inside rubber tubes along the hull's upper edges, raised the driver's <b>front</b> <b>shield</b> which had an acrylic glass window, the driver turned on his bilge pumps, shifted his transmission lever to water operations and the Sheridan entered the water. For newly arrived Sheridans, this might work as engineered. For [...] "war weary" [...] M551s, the driver's window was often [...] "yellowed" [...] and/or cracked as to obscure his vision, and the rubber tubes that contained the rolled up side sleeves were often cracked and/or frozen into place. The Sheridan could still cross a body of water, but like its swimming cousin, the M113 APC (Armoured Personnel Carrier, also built of aluminium) the river had to be narrow, less than 100 yd. In all cases, the bilge pumps had to be working properly, and even then {{by the time the}} Sheridan or the APC reached the other side, water would often fill the insides up to their armoured roofs, spilling through the hatches' cracks and emptying onto the earth once safely ashore. Often a fold down trim vane is erected to stop water washing over the bow of the tank and thus reducing the risk of the vehicle being swamped via the driver's hatch.|$|E

40|$|A {{computational}} platform {{was developed}} to study radiation of high-temperature gases during atmospheric reentries. This platform includes a 2 -D axisymmetrical Navier–Stokes solver and a radiative heat transfer solver based on a Monte Carlo method. In this paper, only gas radiation occurring during entries in the Martian atmosphere is considered. Gas radiative properties are obtained using a statistical narrowband model for CO and CO 2 molecules in high-temperature and low-pressure conditions. Computations on a test case related to the Mars sample return orbiter enabled us {{to set up a}} calculation methodology that includes a loose coupling of aerothermodynamics and radiative transfer. Monte Carlo band model calculations are validated against line-by-line calculation and a ray-tracing method. Results show that radiative fluxes on the rear part are important in comparison with convective fluxes. They are mostly due to CO 2 infrared radiation. The effects of radiative transfer on the flow structure and temperature fields in both the <b>front</b> <b>shield</b> and the wake regions are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{work of this}} PhD {{thesis is}} focused on the {{processing}} and characterisation of ZrB 2 /SiC based multilayer materials, produced by tape casting and sintered without pressure assistance for aerospace applications. The multilayer components were processed in order to be used as external part of a thermal protection system; because of they directly face the atmosphere, in order to withstand high temperature, high heat fluxes and oxidizing environment, they have to show good oxidation and thermal shock resistance, high emissivity, thermal management capability, suitable strength, stiffness and hardness. The development of materials was directed along three main concepts: SiC based multilayer system was developed for the back shield part of the re-entry vehicle which was moderately loaded; ZrB 2 /SiC composite multilayers showing different ZrB 2 :SiC ratio were mainly designed for the <b>front</b> <b>shield</b> where the operating condition should be more severe (that means both higher temperature and thermal loads respect to those expected for the back shield). Moreover, in the context of development of reusable TPS to be used for consecutive missions, hybrid multilayer with ZrB 2 /SiC composite layers in between SiC ones have been prepared: the aim was provide for the degradation of SiC/SiO 2 external part inserting an underlying material showing good mechanical and thermal properties at the higher temperature (over 1700 °C). These three kinds of ceramic multilayer were processed and characterized from mechanical point of view; short and long term oxidation resistance have been detailed investigated. Tests under re-entry conditions have been performe...|$|E
