(8) The food service and <b>general</b> <b>merchandising</b> training sponsors felt the blind could not work in any of the entry-level positions in their firms. (9) A majority of the food service and <b>general</b> <b>merchandising</b> training sponsors felt cooperative planning between marketing and distributive education teacher-coordinators and training sponsors could improve the work performance of visually and hearing impaired individuals.
