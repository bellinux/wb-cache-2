5|$|Shortly after, the {{religious}} reformers (and protégés of Cromwell) Robert Barnes, William Jerome and Thomas Garret were burned as heretics. Cromwell, meanwhile, {{fell out of}} favour although it is unclear exactly why, for {{there is little evidence}} of differences of domestic or foreign policy. Despite his role, he was never formally accused of being responsible for Henry's failed marriage. Cromwell was now surrounded by enemies at court, with Norfolk also able to draw on his niece's position. Cromwell was charged with treason, selling <b>export</b> <b>licences,</b> granting passports, and drawing up commissions without permission, and may also have been blamed for the failure of the foreign policy that accompanied the attempted marriage to Anne. He was subsequently attainted and beheaded.|$|E

An anonymous donation allowed the gallery to make an offer of £12.5 million, but Magnier refused to sell, {{and in the meantime}} he refused to allow the painting to be displayed in public in the UK. The British government refused a permanent <b>export</b> <b>licence,</b> but a temporary <b>export</b> <b>licence</b> was granted in 2005 for 6½ years, and the painting went on display at the National Gallery of Ireland.

500|$|Markham and his team, which {{included}} the [...] botanist Richard Spruce and [...] his future brother-in-law, the New Zealander Charles Bowen, left England for Peru in December 1859, arriving in Lima late in January 1860. There was danger in their enterprise; Peru and Bolivia {{were on the verge}} of war, and Markham's party soon experienced the hostility of Peruvian interests anxious to protect their control over the cinchona trade. This limited his sphere of operations, and prevented him from obtaining specimens of the best quality. Later Markham overcame bureaucratic obstruction to obtain the necessary <b>export</b> <b>licences.</b>|$|E
