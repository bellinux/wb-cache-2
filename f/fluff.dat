5|$|The {{sandwich}} has {{close ties}} to New England, particularly to Somerville, Massachusetts, where Archibald Query invented Marshmallow <b>Fluff,</b> and to Lynn, Massachusetts, where Durkee-Mower has produced it for decades. Somerville holds an annual festival called What the <b>Fluff?</b> based around celebrating Marshmallow <b>Fluff</b> and Fluffernutter sandwiches. The festival incorporates music, visual art, games and a cooking contest based around <b>Fluff</b> and Fluffernutters. In 2011, NASA astronaut Richard Michael Linnehan, {{who was born in}} Lowell, Massachusetts, and ate a Fluffernutter while aboard the International Space Station, acted as one of the contest judges.|$|E
5|$|The term fluffernutter {{has also}} been used to {{describe}} other foods that feature peanut butter and marshmallow <b>fluff,</b> including Fluffernutter cookies, bars and cupcakes. Durkee-Mower, the company that produces Marshmallow <b>Fluff,</b> a brand of marshmallow <b>fluff,</b> produces a cookbook that features recipes for Fluffernutter bars, frosting, pie and a shake. In 2006, Brigham's Ice Cream and Durkee-Mower introduced a Fluffernutter flavor, which featured peanut butter and Marshmallow <b>Fluff</b> in vanilla ice cream. Fluffernutter was also {{the name of a}} candy briefly produced by the Boyer Brothers candy company beginning in 1969.|$|E
5|$|A fluffernutter is a {{sandwich}} made {{with peanut butter}} and marshmallow <b>fluff</b> usually served on white bread. Variations of the sandwich include the substitution of wheat bread {{and the addition of}} various sweet, salty and savory ingredients. The term fluffernutter {{can also be used to}} describe other food items, primarily desserts, that incorporate peanut butter and marshmallow <b>fluff.</b>|$|E

50|$|The 2001 film The <b>Fluffer</b> {{was about}} a film buff with a crush on a porn star who is straight, for whom he would end up working as a <b>fluffer</b> in gay porn. A four-minute short comedy film also titled The <b>Fluffer</b> was {{released}} in 2003.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>fluffer</b> is {{a person}} {{employed}} to keep a male adult film star erect on the set. These duties, which do not necessarily involve touching the actors, are {{considered part of the}} makeup department. After setting up the desired angle, the director asks the actors to hold position and calls for the <b>fluffer</b> to [...] "fluff" [...] the actors for the shot. <b>Fluffing</b> could also entail sexual acts such as fellatio or non-penetrative sex.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, sugar {{shortages}} during World War I hurt {{sales of}} Archibald Query's Marshmallow Creme, so Query sold his recipe in 1920 to two men from Swampscott, Massachusetts, H. Allen Durkee and Fred L. Mower, who began distributing the product through their company, Durkee-Mower Inc. The pair renamed the product Toot Sweet Marshmallow <b>Fluff,</b> and Durkee-Mower continues {{to sell the}} product under the name Marshmallow <b>Fluff.</b> The sandwich made with peanut butter and marshmallow <b>fluff</b> continued to be eaten, but was not called a Fluffernutter until 1960, when an advertising firm Durkee-Mower hired created the term as a more effective way to market the sandwich. Fluffernutter is a registered trademark of Durkee-Mower, although the company's U.S. trademark registrations for the term cover only ice cream and printed recipes. In 2006, Durkee-Mower sued Williams-Sonoma Inc. in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, alleging that Williams-Sonoma infringed on its trademark by selling a marshmallow and peanut butter chocolate-covered candy under the Fluffernutter name.|$|E
5|$|A fluffernutter {{is made by}} {{spreading}} peanut butter on a slice of bread, then spreading {{an equal amount of}} marshmallow <b>fluff</b> on another slice and finally combining them to form a sandwich. Variations of the recipe include wheat bread instead of white, Nutella hazelnut spread instead of or in addition to peanut butter, and the addition of sweet ingredients like bananas or savory and salty ingredients like bacon. The Fluffernutter itself is often seen as a variation on the peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Though often seen as a food for children, the Fluffernutter recipe has been adapted to appeal to adult tastes. For example, a New York caterer serves a Fluffernutter hors d'oeuvre in a toasted ice cream cone with a spoon of peanut butter and torched marshmallow <b>fluff</b> on top.|$|E
5|$|The American crow is all black, with {{iridescent}} feathers. It {{looks much}} like other all-black corvids. They {{can be distinguished}} from the common raven (C. corax) because American crows are smaller and from the fish crow (C. ossifragus) because American crows do not hunch and <b>fluff</b> their throat feathers when they call.|$|E

5|$|The term fluffernutter has {{sometimes}} been used disparagingly to describe something that lacks substance and has minimal to no cultural value. On the other hand, some writers look on Fluffernutters and marshmallow <b>fluff</b> {{as a source of}} childhood nostalgia and regional pride.|$|E
5|$|If seen {{flying at}} a {{distance}} from where size estimates are unreliable, the distinctly larger common ravens (C. corax) can be distinguished by their almost lozenge-shaped tail and their larger-looking heads. They also <b>fluff</b> their throat feathers when calling like fish crows, only more so. Ravens also soar for extended periods, unlike crows, which rarely fly more than a few seconds without flapping their wings.|$|E
5|$|Visual {{differentiation}} {{from the}} fish crow (C. ossifragus) {{is extremely difficult}} and often inaccurate. Nonetheless, differences apart from size do exist. Fish crows {{tend to have more}} slender bills and feet. There may also be a small sharp hook {{at the end of the}} upper bill. Fish crows also appear as if they have shorter legs when walking. More dramatically, when calling, fish crows tend to hunch and <b>fluff</b> their throat feathers.|$|E

5|$|Birth {{usually takes}} place in the water and {{typically}} produces a single pup weighing 1.4 to 2.3kg (3 to 5lb). Twins occur in 2% of births; however, usually only one pup survives. At birth, the eyes are open, ten teeth are visible, and the pup has a thick coat of baby fur. Mothers have been observed to lick and <b>fluff</b> a newborn for hours; after grooming, the pup's fur retains so much air, the pup floats like a cork and cannot dive. The fluffy baby fur is replaced by adult fur after about 13 weeks.|$|E
5|$|During {{the mating}} season, the male moults its brown {{feathers}} and displays a fiery red plumage. It may <b>fluff</b> its red back and shoulder feathers out so they cover {{part of the}} wings in a puffball-display. It will fly about and confront another male to repel it, or to assert dominance over a female. It also picks red petals and sometimes red seeds and presents them to other birds. 90% of the time, the male presents to a female in {{what appears to be}} a courtship ritual. The other 10% of the time, it presents to another male in an act of apparent aggression.|$|E

He was replaced by Steve Williams, who became a close friend of Woods and is often credited with helping him with key shots and putts. In June 2011, Woods fired Williams and replaced him with friend Bryon Bell on an interim basis. Joe LaCava, a former caddie of both Fred Couples and Dustin Johnson, was hired by Woods shortly after and has remained Woods' caddie since then, but he has seen very limited work.|$|E

5|$|The Solar System {{is in the}} Local Interstellar Cloud or Local <b>Fluff.</b> It {{is thought}} to be near the {{neighbouring}} G-Cloud but it is not known if the Solar System is embedded in the Local Interstellar Cloud, or if it is in the region where the Local Interstellar Cloud and G-Cloud are interacting. The Local Interstellar Cloud is an area of denser cloud in an otherwise sparse region known as the Local Bubble, an hourglass-shaped cavity in the interstellar medium roughly 300 light-years (ly) across. The bubble is suffused with high-temperature plasma, that suggests it is the product of several recent supernovae.|$|E
5|$|According to an IAU draft resolution, the {{roundness}} condition generally {{results in}} {{the need for a}} mass of at least 5 kg, or diameter of at least 800km. However, Mike Brown claims that these numbers are only right for rocky bodies like asteroids, and that icy bodies like Kuiper Belt objects reach hydrostatic equilibrium at much smaller sizes, probably somewhere between 200 and 400km in diameter. It all depends on the rigidity of the material that makes up the body, which is in turn strongly influenced by its internal temperature. Assuming that Methone's shape reflects the balance between the tidal force exerted by Saturn and the moon's gravity, its tiny 3km diameter suggests Methone is composed of icy <b>fluff.</b>|$|E
5|$|Marshmallow <b>fluff,</b> {{one of the}} {{two main}} {{ingredients}} of a Fluffernutter, was invented in the early 20th century. Archibald Query invented a creation he called Marshmallow Creme in Somerville, Massachusetts, in 1917, while Amory and Emma Curtis of Melrose, Massachusetts, invented Snowflake Marshmallow Creme in 1913. During World War I, Emma Curtis published a recipe for the Liberty Sandwich, which consisted of peanut butter and Snowflake Marshmallow Creme on oat or barley bread. The recipe was published in a promotional booklet sent to Curtis' customers in 1918 and may be the origin of the Fluffernutter sandwich. Earlier labels and booklets published by the Curtises suggested combining Snow Flake Marshmallow Creme with peanut butter or eating it on sandwiches with chopped nuts or olives.|$|E

The <b>Fluffer</b> features cameos from a number of figures in the adult entertainment industry, including Ron Jeremy, director Chi Chi LaRue, Karen Dior, Zach Richards, Derek Cameron, Chad Donovan, Thomas Lloyd, Jim Steel, Chris Green and Cole Tucker.|$|R
5|$|The zduhaći {{of a band}} {{would leave}} their bodies in sleep and gather at an {{appointed}} place, before flying into a battle. They used various weapons, such as spindles, beech buds, sharp splinters, leaves, stalks of straw, <b>fluff,</b> flakes, sand, long twigs, cornel stones, pine cones, eggshells, and other light objects. As believed in Herzegovina, zduhaći uprooted gigantic firs and oaks and fought with them. However, the most powerful zduhać weapon was held to be a stick of luč (resinous wood burned to give light or used as kindling) charred at both ends, or any charred splinter of wood. A zduhać who was hit with this weapon would surely die. People therefore avoided igniting the sticks at both ends, and they took care that no splinters were left half-burned.|$|E
5|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{displays}} are seen, with aggressive behaviours outnumbering pro-social ones. Crouching low and uttering quiet begging calls are common signs of submission. The manus flutter is a submissive display where a magpie will flutter its primary feathers in its wings. A magpie, particularly a juvenile, may also fall, roll over on its back and expose its underparts. Birds may <b>fluff</b> up their flank feathers as an aggressive display or preceding an attack. Young birds display various forms of play behaviour, either by themselves or in groups, with older birds often initiating the proceedings with juveniles. These may involve picking up, manipulating or tugging at various objects such as sticks, rocks or bits of wire, and handing them to other birds. A bird may pick up a feather or leaf and flying off with it, with other birds pursuing and attempting {{to bring down the}} leader by latching onto its tail feathers. Birds may jump on each other and even engage in mock fighting. Play may even take place with other species such as blue-faced honeyeaters and Australasian pipits.|$|E
5|$|The magpie is {{generally}} sedentary and territorial throughout its range, living in groups occupying a territory, or in flocks or fringe groups. A group may occupy {{and defend the}} same territory for many years. Much energy is spent defending a territory from intruders, particularly other magpies, and different behaviours are seen with different opponents. The sight of a raptor results in a rallying call by sentinel birds and subsequent coordinated mobbing of the intruder. Magpies place themselves {{either side of the}} bird of prey so that it will be attacked from behind should it strike a defender, and harass and drive the raptor to some distance beyond the territory. A group will use carolling as a signal to advertise ownership and warn off other magpies. In the negotiating display, the one or two dominant magpies parade along the border of the defended territory {{while the rest of the}} group stand back a little and look on. The leaders may <b>fluff</b> their feathers or caroll repeatedly. In a group strength display, employed if both the opposing and defending groups are of roughly equal numbers, all magpies will fly and form a row at the border of the territory. The defending group may also resort to an aerial display where the dominant magpies, or sometimes the whole group, swoop and dive while calling to warn an intruding magpie's group.|$|E
