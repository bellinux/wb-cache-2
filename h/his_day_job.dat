25|$|By nature, Ayodele Awojobi was a teacher.

25|$|On 27 August 2009, The Dingoes were {{inducted}} into the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame alongside Kev Carmody, Little Pattie, Mental As Anything, and John Paul Young. The Dingoes reformed in late 2009 and released a new album, Tracks in 2010 which {{was followed by a}} tour of Australia. A live album 'Live at Last' came out after the tour, which prompted another tour - this time without Bois who could not get away from <b>his</b> <b>day</b> <b>job.</b>|$|E
25|$|In a segment, Green went to {{the press}} conference of Grey Owl where he serenaded and kissed Pierce Brosnan. Brosnan, {{thinking}} Green was a journalist, advised him {{not to give up}} <b>his</b> <b>day</b> <b>job.</b> Green also did many segments humiliating his co-host and longtime friend Glenn Humplik; even after the pair had become well-known, Humplik continued working at his phone company job, fearing that his entertainment career might not last. Green teased him about this often and once gave out Humplik's office phone number on the air.|$|E
5000|$|This {{approach}} made playing {{songs from}} the album on the last tour more difficult. [...] "Certain songs we don't even play yet," [...] Bachmann stated in an interview during the White Trash Heroes tour. [...] "We haven't even learned them that well due {{to the way the}} record was pieced together. They're not impossible to play, we just haven't pulled them out yet...as time goes on we learn more of the new ones, and they've been coming across fine." [...] During the tour supporting the album, Eric Johnson missed several dates due to <b>his</b> <b>day</b> <b>job's</b> work schedule. Brian Causey, guitarist for Man or Astro-man? and friend of the band, filled in for the missing Johnson. In late 1998, after Price was diagnosed with, and subsequently had surgery for, carpal tunnel syndrome, the band decided to call it quits for good.|$|R

50|$|Varney {{was born}} in Canning Town, then in Essex but {{now part of the}} London Borough of Newham. His father worked in a rubber factory in Silvertown {{and he was one of}} five {{children}} who grew up in Addington Road, Canning Town. Varney was educated at the nearby Star Lane Primary School in West Ham and after leaving school at 14, he worked as a messenger boy and a page boy at the Regent Palace Hotel. He took piano lessons as a child and was good enough to find employment as a part-time piano player. His first paid engagement was at Plumstead Radical Club in Woolwich, for which he was paid eight shillings and sixpence (42½p). He also played in working men's clubs, pubs and ABC cinemas, and later sang with big bands of the time. He and his mother decided that show business was the career for him, and he gave up <b>his</b> <b>day</b> <b>jobs.</b>|$|R
25|$|Bennington was {{frustrated}} and {{almost ready to}} quit his musical career altogether when Jeff Blue, {{the vice president of}} A at Zomba Music in Los Angeles, offered him an audition with the future members of Linkin Park. Bennington quit <b>his</b> <b>day</b> <b>job</b> at a digital services firm and took his family to California, where he had a successful audition with Linkin Park, who were then called Xero. He managed to record the song for his audition in a day, missing his own birthday celebration in the process. Bennington and Mike Shinoda, the band's other vocalist, made significant progress together, but failed to find a record deal. After facing numerous rejections, Jeff Blue, now a vice president of A at Warner Bros., intervened again to help the band sign with Warner Bros. Records.|$|E
25|$|Merritt was {{interested}} in music {{from an early age}} and started guitar lessons at twelve. By 1955 he encountered the rock'n'roll of Bill Haley and Elvis Presley; after leaving school in 1956, aged 15, Merritt formed The Meteors with friends Ross Clancy (sax), Peter Patonai (piano), Ian Glass (bass) and Pete Sowden (drums). Initially a part-time group, they played dances and local charity concerts, Merritt continued <b>his</b> <b>day</b> <b>job</b> as apprentice bricklayer in his father's business. When his parents, together with local Odeon theatre manager, Trevor King, developed the Christchurch Railway Hall into a music venue, The Teenage Club, they hired Merritt & The Meteors. The Teenage Club drew hundreds of locals and increased their popularity in the city when most businesses and public venues closed until late on Sunday afternoon.|$|E
25|$|The {{band played}} {{sporadic}} shows {{to support the}} album, which was well-reviewed in UK, but EMI Australia did little to assist them. Without such backing, it was clear {{by the end of}} 1971 that {{they were not going to}} achieve the success they had dreamt of. Although Keays' recollections are more positive, Wheatley's own account of the album sessions is that they were an unhappy experience for him. He had a bad LSD trip the night before they went into the studio and began the recording in a negative frame of mind. Tensions mounted steadily during the recording and Wheatley did not play on some of the tracks, with his parts covered by Ford. According to Keays, Wheatley had been working part-time at a management agency over the previous few months and had insufficient time to rehearse because of <b>his</b> <b>day</b> <b>job.</b>|$|E
50|$|Creswell was {{interested}} in eastern buildings and places from childhood. By 1910 he had become so drawn to Islamic architecture that he started collecting a library that was eventually {{to become one of}} the most comprehensive private collections of its kind. As well as working at <b>his</b> engineering <b>day</b> <b>job,</b> he spent time studying eastern architecture. He published an article in The Burlington Magazine in 1913, and soon after gave a paper to the Royal Asiatic Society, which was well received. Both concerned domes in Persian architecture.|$|R
50|$|The exact {{details of}} Frank's {{departure}} remain ambiguous. Apparently considering suicide, he drives {{to a high}} bridge over a forest and tosses his hat into the river far below. Then another car arrives and a man comes out. We later see Frank retrieve his hat from the water. Unsatisfied with <b>his</b> dreary <b>day</b> <b>job</b> as a tailor, having left behind the only pleasant aspect of his life, and placing the familiar symbol of his sinister side back on his head, he walks off into the woods.|$|R
5000|$|Kotobuki Shiriagari (Shiriagari Kotobuki) is a Japanese manga {{artist and}} actor from Shizuoka, Japan, {{known for his}} dark humor and social criticism.

25|$|During this time, David Ruffin began {{following}} the group around as he aspired {{to join the}} group. During a local Detroit performance, Ruffin joined the group onstage and impressed the group with his vocal talent and dancing skills. Following that same time, Al Bryant had grown frustrated with the group's lack of success and became restless and uncooperative, preferring the mundane routine of <b>his</b> <b>day</b> <b>job</b> as a milkman over the rigors of rehearsal and performing. After a heated quarrel with Paul and hitting {{him in the head}} with a beer bottle following a disastrous performance at the 1963 Motown company Christmas/New Years Eve party, Bryant was summarily fired from the group. As a result, David Ruffin was brought in as his replacement in January 1964. Though Ruffin's brother, Jimmy was also considered for the slot, David was selected following his performance with them in 1963.|$|E
25|$|On August 14, 1997, Schmitz {{created a}} Geocities website called Bookhouse's Previews of Upcoming Movies {{as a way}} to avoid having to repeat the same {{information}} in chat rooms and message boards when people would ask questions about movies that had not been released yet, or that were rumored to be at some stage of development in Hollywood. The site quickly outgrew GeoCities, and was re-launched under the name of Upcomingmovies.com in early 1998. By October 1999, the site was earning enough of an income from advertising that Schmitz was able to quit <b>his</b> <b>day</b> <b>job</b> as a librarian. In 2001, Schmitz teamed up with Yahoo! Movies, bringing the site there under the new name of Greg's Previews of Upcoming Movies. Schmitz also moved to Santa Monica, California as part of the change, and during his time in California, he co-starred in a television pilot for MGM Television called The Movie Fan Show, was frequently quoted in publications like USA Today and The Chicago Sun-Times, and made several radio appearances, including The Howard Stern Show.|$|E
500|$|In the game's early days, Johnson {{would work}} on the game during breaks while at work, but {{eighteen}} months or so after launch, the game was bringing in enough money for Johnson to quit <b>his</b> <b>day</b> <b>job</b> as a programmer and develop the game full-time. [...] He then began to pay Nite for his work and after approximately two years hired two more developers.

60|$|When the Edomites {{fled from}} David with their young King Hadad into Egypt, it is {{probable}} that they carried thither also the use of letters: for letters were then in use among the posterity of Abraham in Arabia Petræa, and upon the borders of the Red Sea, the Law being written there by Moses in a book, and in tables of stone, long before: for Moses marrying the daughter of the prince of Midian, and dwelling with him forty years, learnt them among the Midianites: and Job, who lived [261] among their neighbours the Edomites, mentions the writing down or words, as there in use in <b>his</b> <b>days,</b> <b>Job.</b> xix. 23, 24. and there is no instance of letters for writing down sounds, being in use before the days of David, in any other nation besides the posterity of Abraham. The Egyptians ascribed this invention to Thoth, the secretary of Osiris; and therefore Letters began to be in use in Egypt in the days of Thoth, that is, a little after the flight of the Edomites from David, or about the time that Cadmus brought them into Europe.|$|R
500|$|Watt {{refers to}} the album as being the band's art record in the {{documentary}} We Jam Econo: The Story of The Minutemen. The songwriting styles of Boon and Watt on Double Nickels on the Dime contrasted. Boon tended to write the band's anthems, and often explored wider political issues. [...] "This Ain't No Picnic", {{was an example of}} his approach. Exploring racism and the strife of the working class with both gravity and humor, he composed the song after his supervisor would not let him listen to jazz and soul music on the radio at <b>his</b> <b>day</b> <b>job,</b> claiming it was [...] "nigger shit." ...|$|E
500|$|This led him {{to begin}} {{studying}} linguistics with Edward Sapir at Yale University while still maintaining <b>his</b> <b>day</b> <b>job</b> at the Hartford Fire Insurance Company. During his time at Yale {{he worked on the}} description of the Hopi language, and the historical linguistics of the Uto-Aztecan languages, publishing many influential papers in professional journals. He was chosen as the substitute for Sapir during his medical leave in 1938. Whorf taught his seminar on [...] "Problems of American Indian Linguistics". In addition to his well-known work on linguistic relativity, he wrote a grammar sketch of Hopi and studies of Nahuatl dialects, proposed a deciphering of Maya hieroglyphic writing, and published the first attempt towards a reconstruction of Uto-Aztecan.|$|E
500|$|With 109,742 votes [...] 79 {{percent of}} the total cast [...] Farmer {{garnered}} more votes than any other Republican candidate for any office on the ballot en route to winning the nomination. The victory set up a general election contest against Democratic nominee Alice Woods Baesler, a state agriculture department aide and wife of former Congressman and Kentucky basketball player Scotty Baesler. Bolstered by his significantly higher name recognition, Farmer led an early July SurveyUSA poll 61% to 33% over Baesler. Baesler charged that Farmer was unqualified for the job of agriculture commissioner and that his high poll numbers and convincing primary victory were driven by his popularity as a basketball player, criticizing him for featuring his status as a member of [...] "The Unforgettables" [...] in his campaign literature. Farmer responded that his college degree qualified him to be agriculture commissioner and said his need to continue <b>his</b> <b>day</b> <b>job</b> to support his family often kept him away from the campaign trail where he could expound more on his ideas for running the Department of Agriculture.|$|E
50|$|The protagonist {{tells of}} <b>his</b> <b>days</b> at an eastern {{college in the}} United States, where he {{falls in love with}} a girl but is unable to win her. He leaves school to become a writer, but drink and his frank {{comments}} lose him <b>his</b> <b>day</b> <b>jobs</b> before he can become a real writer. He spirals down, moving west, while drinking and taking ever-lower jobs. Along the way, he gets sent to Korea during the Korean War. Finally, he hits bottom, but with a mis-interpreted line from The Great Gatsby, his enduring love for his unrequited love, and the good luck of getting a job from someone, he is able to turn himself around. All the time, the one thing he has been able to hold on to is his collection of unsent letters to his love. After he has regained health and direction, he returns to the east to be near his love and to work his way to being a writer. He re-enters school and winds up getting his doctorate in English at the same time she does. Through his years of finishing his bachelor's, and getting his graduate degrees, he gets closer to her, eventually becoming more than a friend, and convincing her that she should divorce her successful husband, who is the head of the English Department, to marry the protagonist.|$|R

He got <b>his</b> first <b>day</b> <b>job</b> in 40 years and began working with developmentally {{disabled}} adults while his wife worked tirelessly to establish Jerry as a solo artist.
