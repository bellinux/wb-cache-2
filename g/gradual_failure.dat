A fit of the dark I–V curve at 25 °C with a 3 D distributed model {{before and after the}} test was done.

Therefore, this test did not cause any morphological change in the devices, and although the devices were isolated with silicone, the perimeter region was revealed as the most fragile component of the solar cell. Consequently, the current flowing beneath the busbar favors the progression of defects in the device in the perimeter region...|$|R

50|$|Both {{natural and}} {{man-made}} levees can fail {{in a number}} of ways. Factors that cause levee failure include overtopping, erosion, structural failures, and levee saturation. The most frequent (and dangerous) is a levee breach. Here, a part of the levee actually breaks or is eroded away, leaving a large opening for water to flood land otherwise protected by the levee. A breach can be a sudden or <b>gradual</b> <b>failure,</b> caused either by surface erosion or by subsurface weakness in the levee. A breach can leave a fan-shaped deposit of sediment radiating away from the breach, described as a crevasse splay. In natural levees, once a breach has occurred, the gap in the levee will remain until it is again filled in by levee building processes. This increases the chances of future breaches occurring in the same location. Breaches can be the location of meander cutoffs if the river flow direction is permanently diverted through the gap.|$|E

The aim of {{the study}} was to assess by means a 3 D finite element linear and {{non-linear}} analysis mechanical interaction between an implant-supported crown and surrounding tissues. Materials and methods. A three-dimensional FEM model was developed. Four different material combinations for the abutment and the core were evaluated: Y-TZP - Y-TZP, Y-TZP - microhybrid composite, T - microhybrid composite; T and Y-TZP. 250 N and 450 N loads over a 0, 5 mm 2 areas with different angles (0 ° and 45 °) and locations were applied on the occlusal surface of the framework and the distribution of equivalent von Mises stress was investigated. Using the most critical scenario, the influence of the <b>gradual</b> <b>failure</b> of the cement layer, due to increasing load, on the bone –implant interface, were investigated. Results. The worst physiological loading condition was the one associated with a horizontal component (45 °, 250 N). The 0 °, 450 N load (relating to accidental or pathological condition) induced stress concentrations in the cortical bone comparable with those obtained for the tilted load, but with a greater extension to the cancellous bone. Y-TZP prosthetic elements determined minimum values of stress, due to vertical loads at the interface, while the microhybrid composite ones determined minimum stresses due to horizontal loads. Conclusion. Different material combinations for the abutment and the core influenced weakly the stress state at bone-implant interface, with a dependency closely related to the loading mode. The implant – prostheses system stress distribution depended on material choice. Furthermore progressive 45 ° loads with the <b>gradual</b> <b>failure</b> of the cement layer did not influence Von Mises stresses at bone-implant-interface...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the development of}} hardware, theory, and experimental methods to enable a robotic manipulator arm to interact with soils and estimate soil properties from interaction forces. Unlike the majority of robotic systems interacting with soil, our objective is parameter estimation, not excavation. To this end, we design our manipulator with a flat plate for easy modeling of interactions. By using a flat plate, we {{take advantage of the}} wealth of research on the similar problem of earth pressure on retaining walls. There are a number of existing earth pressure models. These models typically provide estimates of force which are in uncertain relation to the true force. A recent technique, known as numerical limit analysis, provides upper and lower bounds on the true force. Predictions from the numerical limit analysis technique are shown to be in good agreement with other accepted models. Experimental methods for plate insertion, soil-tool interface friction estimation, and control of applied forces on the soil are presented. In addition, a novel graphical technique for inverting the soil models is developed, which is an improvement over standard nonlinear optimization. This graphical technique utilizes the uncertainties associated with each set of force measurements to obtain all possible parameters which could have produced the measured forces. (cont.) The system is tested on three cohesionless soils, two in a loose state and one in a loose and dense state. The results are compared with friction angles obtained from direct shear tests. The results highlight a number of key points. Common assumptions are made in soil modeling. Most notably, the Mohr-Coulomb failure law and perfectly plastic behavior. In the direct shear tests, a marked dependence of friction angle on the normal stress at low stresses is found. This has ramifications for any study of friction done at low stresses. In addition, <b>gradual</b> <b>failures</b> are often observed for vertical tools and tools inclined away from the direction of motion.

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: In addition to alloantigen-dependent events, antigen-independent factors can influence chronic rejection of organ allografts. Initial injury, including early ischemia and acute rejection, may contribute. METHODS: Kidney isografts were transplanted orthotopically into bilaterally nephrectomized rat recipients and studied functionally, morphologically and immunohistologically, at serial intervals up to 72 weeks after transplantation. Controls included chronically rejecting kidney allografts using a well-established model, non-nephrectomized and uninephrectomized animals with a native kidney that had undergone initial ischemia and uninephrectomized rats whose remaining kidney had been manipulated operatively. RESULTS: Allograft recipients developed progressive proteinuria after 12 weeks, with <b>gradual</b> renal <b>failure</b> ultimately leading to death. At the same time, morphologic changes, including progressive arteriosclerosis and glomerulosclerosis, tubular atrophy, and interstitial fibrosis, developed. Immunohistologically, macrophages infiltrated glomeruli during this period and cytokines became upregulated. Comparable changes occurred in isografts, but later, beginning after week 24 and progressing thereafter. The single ischemic kidney in uninephrectomized controls also developed the same lesions; no comparable changes were noted in other control kidneys. CONCLUSIONS: Antigen-independent functional and morphologic changes occur in long-term kidney isografts that resemble those appearing considerably earlier in allografts that reject chronically. Initial injury and extent of functioning renal mass may be important factors for such late changes...|$|R
