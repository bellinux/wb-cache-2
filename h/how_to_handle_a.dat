5|$|Shadow of Mordor was Monolith's first third-person open world {{video game}} for the eighth {{generation}} consoles PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, and de Plater considered its development an educational experience for the studio. In Monolith's introduction to the genre, many core mechanics were built from scratch and the studio were inspired by successful video games such as the Batman: Arkham series created by Rocksteady Studios; those games inspired Shadow of Mordor stealth and free-flow combat mechanics. The studio considered Rocksteady's games good examples of <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> <b>a</b> licensed title.|$|E

25|$|Values such {{as these}} do not give answers as to <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> <b>a</b> {{particular}} situation, but provide a useful framework for understanding conflicts. When moral values are in conflict, the result may be an ethical dilemma or crisis. Sometimes, no good solution to a dilemma in medical ethics exists, and occasionally, {{the values of the}} medical community (i.e., the hospital and its staff) conflict with the values of the individual patient, family, or larger non-medical community. Conflicts can also arise between health care providers, or among family members. For example, some argue that the principles of autonomy and beneficence clash when patients refuse blood transfusions, considering them life-saving; and truth-telling was not emphasized to a large extent before the HIV era.|$|E

25|$|Naval {{training}} {{at this time}} took place on board ship, and having obtained a nomination and passing the modest exams, he was posted to HMS Wellesley in spring 1848. Wellesley (Captain George Goldsmith under Admiral the Earl of Dundonald) was then at Plymouth preparing to leave as flagship of the North American Station. She was a two-decker sailing ship, since steam power was only then being introduced into the navy. At that time, the principal important art to be taught to new recruits was <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> <b>a</b> sailing ship, though within ten years almost all first class naval ships would be steam powered. He was required to pay his own schoolmaster {{at the rate of}} £5 per year. In particular, his mathematics at the start of his training was considered very poor, but at examinations eighteen months later, he came top of the class. Wellesley sailed on 24 March, arriving at Bermuda on 3 May. In correspondence home, he observed that he was seasick, and that the gales caused considerable broken crockery aboard ship. Yet while the gunroom (where the midshipman lived) suffered badly from its broken cups of a different pattern to those used elsewhere on the ship, their hens, much alike with others on board, never became ill or died.|$|E
2500|$|In 1937 {{officials}} at the Exchange used their experiences from the First World War to draw up plans on <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> <b>a</b> new war situation. One of the main concerns were air-raids and the subsequent bombing of the Exchange's perimeters, and one suggestion was a move to Denham. This however never took place. On {{the first day of}} September 1939, the Exchange closed its doors [...] "until further notice" [...] and two days later war was declared. Unlike in the prior war, the Exchange opened its doors again six days later, on 7 September.|$|E
2500|$|On January 28, 1996, he {{suffered}} a severe stroke, impairing his ability to speak. Doctors told his wife that unless there was rapid improvement, {{the loss of the}} ability to speak was likely permanent. After a regime of daily speech-language therapy that lasted several months, his ability to speak returned, although it was still limited. He was able to accept an honorary Academy Award two months later in March and thank the audience. He wrote about this experience in a book, My Stroke of Luck, which he hoped would be an [...] "operating manual" [...] for others on <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> <b>a</b> stroke victim in their own family.|$|E

The shipowner's son knew <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> <b>an</b> automobile almost as well as any of them, but he had one fault, which was, that he did not steer {{out of the way of}} sharp stones and like things calculated to bring on punctures and blow-outs.|$|R

But he had obtained information on his return to Paris which exalted the uses of humility. Euphemia's fortune, wonderful to say, was greater than its fame, and in view of such a prize, even a member of his family could afford to take a snubbing.|$|R
50|$|Phelps {{soon after}} left the fort, hiring a boatman {{to take him}} down the lake in a small boat. He entered the boat in full view and under the guns of the fort. He {{requested}} the boatman to row hard that he might terminate the journey as soon as possible. The boatman then requested him to take an oar and assist. This Phelps declined to do, being in full sight of the fort, by saying he was no boatman, because as a peddler he would not usually know <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> <b>an</b> oar.|$|R

The Canadian Federal government subsidized the operation of the Kandahar outlet in the order of CAD$4–5million per year.

2500|$|The average Jewish {{population}} of Yemen {{for the first}} five centuries CE {{is said to have been}} about 3,000. The Jews were scattered throughout the country, but carried on an extensive commerce and thus succeeded in getting possession of many Jewish books. [...] It seems that they were not deeply learned in Rabbinic traditions (although they were familiar with many midrashic interpretations of Torah passages), but they were certainly devout and observant Jews. [...] Messianic hopes were strong and many messianic movements occurred down through the centuries. [...] Maimonides, the great rabbi and thinker of the 12th century, leader of Egyptian Jewry, wrote his famous Letter to Yemen in response to desperate appeals from Jewish elders there about <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> <b>a</b> madman who claimed to be the messiah and was wreaking serious harm on the community. [...] Just within the nineteenth century there were three pseudo-messiahs: Shukr Kuhayl I (1861–65), Shukr Kuhayl II (1868–75), Joseph Abdallah (1888–93).|$|E
2500|$|Self-concept {{is a term}} {{referring}} to the whole sum of beliefs that people have about themselves. However, what specifically does self-concept consist of? According to Hazel Markus (1977), the self-concept {{is made up of}} cognitive molecules called self-schemas– beliefs that people have about themselves that guide the processing of self-reliant information. For example, an athlete at a university would have multiple selves that would process different information pertinent to each self: the student would be one [...] "self," [...] who would process information pertinent to a student (taking notes in class, completing a homework assignment, etc.); the athlete would be the [...] "self" [...] who processes information about things related to being an athlete (recognizing an incoming pass, aiming a shot, etc.). These [...] "selves" [...] are part of one's identity and the self-reliant information is the information that relies on the proper [...] "self" [...] to process and react on it. If a [...] "self" [...] is not part of one's identity, then it is much more difficult for one to react. For example, a civilian may not know <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> <b>a</b> hostile threat as a trained Marine would. The Marine contains a [...] "self" [...] that would enable him/her to process the information about the hostile threat and react accordingly, whereas a civilian may not contain that self, disabling them from properly processing the information from the hostile threat and, furthermore, debilitating them from acting accordingly. Self-schemas are to an individual’s total self–concept as a hypothesis is to a theory, or a book is to a library. A good example is the body weight self-schema; people who regard themselves as over or underweight, or for those whom body image is a significant self-concept aspect, are considered schematics with respect to weight. For these people a range of otherwise mundane events– grocery shopping, new clothes, eating out, or going to the beach– can trigger thoughts about the self. In contrast, people who do not regard their weight as an important part of their lives are a-schematic on that attribute.|$|E
