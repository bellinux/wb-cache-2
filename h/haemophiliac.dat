5|$|Victoria's {{youngest}} son, Leopold, {{was affected}} by the blood-clotting disease haemophilia B and two of her five daughters, Alice and Beatrice, were carriers. Royal haemophiliacs descended from Victoria included her great-grandsons, Alexei Nikolaevich, Tsarevich of Russia, Alfonso, Prince of Asturias, and Infante Gonzalo of Spain. The presence of the disease in Victoria's descendants, but not in her ancestors, led to modern speculation that her true father was not the Duke of Kent but a <b>haemophiliac.</b> There is no documentary evidence of a <b>haemophiliac</b> in connection with Victoria's mother, and as male carriers always suffer the disease, even if such a man had existed {{he would have been}} seriously ill. It is more likely that the mutation arose spontaneously because Victoria's father was over 50 {{at the time of her}} conception and haemophilia arises more frequently in the children of older fathers. Spontaneous mutations account for about a third of cases.|$|E
5|$|During the Prussian {{invasion}} of Hesse in June 1866, Victoria and Elisabeth {{were sent to}} England {{to live with their}} grandmother until hostilities were ended by the absorption of Hesse-Kassel and parts of Hesse-Darmstadt into Prussia. During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, military hospitals were set up in the palace grounds at Darmstadt, and she helped in the soup kitchens with her mother. She remembered the intense cold of the winter, and being burned on the arm by hot soup. In 1872, Victoria's eighteen-month-old brother, Friedrich, was diagnosed with haemophilia. The diagnosis came as a shock to the royal families of Europe; it had been twenty years since Queen Victoria had given birth to her <b>haemophiliac</b> son, Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany, {{and it was the first}} indication that the bleeding disorder in the royal family was hereditary. The following year, Friedrich fell from a window onto stone steps and died. It was the first of many tragedies to beset the Hesse family.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{discover}} whether pathological and neuropathological findings at necropsy {{are different}} in <b>haemophiliacs</b> and other subjects positive for HIV. DESIGN [...] Pathological and neuropathological findings at necropsy were compared in <b>haemophiliacs</b> and non-haemophiliacs, most of them homosexual men. SETTING [...] Necropsies performed {{in the south of}} England. SUBJECTS [...] 11 <b>Haemophiliacs</b> (mean age 41, range 15 - 69) and 31 non-haemophiliacs, 29 of whom were homosexual men (mean age 40, range 21 - 60). AIDS was diagnosed before death in four <b>haemophiliacs</b> and {{all but one of the}} non-haemophiliacs. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Prevalence of various forms of neuropathology and systemic pathology in the <b>haemophiliacs</b> and non-haemophiliacs, compared with Fisher's exact test. RESULTS [...] The prevalences of opportunistic infections of the central nervous system were significantly higher in the non-haemophiliacs (cerebral toxoplasmosis 23 % (7), progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy 10 % (3), and cerebral cytomegalovirus infection 19 % (6) in the non-haemophiliacs v no cases in the <b>haemophiliacs).</b> The prevalences of fresh and old intracranial haemorrhages and cirrhosis of the liver were significantly higher in the <b>haemophiliacs</b> (fresh intracranial haemorrhage 45 % (5), old intracranial haemorrhage 36 % (4), and cirrhosis of the liver 27 % (3) in the <b>haemophiliacs</b> v no cases in the non-haemophiliacs). The prevalence of neuropathological changes in the non-haemophiliacs was similar to that found in other necropsy series. CONCLUSIONS [...] The main causes of death in <b>haemophiliacs</b> positive for HIV included intracranial haemorrhage and cirrhosis of the liver. The <b>haemophiliacs</b> died when the characteristic neuropathological changes associated with HIV infection were at a fairly early stage in their development...|$|R
40|$|Cross-sectional {{comparisons}} between <b>haemophiliacs</b> and their healthy classmates {{were made in}} the years 1971 - 72 and 1987 - 88. The more recent set of data indicated no difference in respect to school absenteeism and school achievements between <b>haemophiliacs</b> and classmates in contrast to the older data, which showed such differences. In 1987 - 1988 the personality of the haemophilic boy was assessed both by teacher-ratings as well as by self-rating scales, and they indicated that the <b>haemophiliacs</b> were self-assured and independent but also less caring, less joyful, less open and more bullied than their healthy classmates. The mildly to moderately affected <b>haemophiliacs</b> tended to have more emotional disturbances than classmates and se-verely affected <b>haemophiliacs.</b> The latter were the least likely to avoid potentially hazardous activities.

25|$|At London, on 8 April 1853, George Stephen {{married his}} first wife, Annie Charlotte Kane (1830–1896). She {{was one of}} several {{children}} born to Benjamin Kane on the Adriatic island of Corfu when the Ionian Islands were a British protectorate. Her father, a former officer in the Royal Engineers was assistant clerk of works in the Naval Ordnance there, though she was educated in London. During a Royal Tour, the <b>haemophiliac</b> Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany, fell seriously ill at Montreal and Charlotte nursed him back to health. As such, in 1887, she was first presented to Queen Victoria by her friend Georgina Gascoyne-Cecil, Marchioness of Salisbury, who lived at Hatfield House which neighboured the Stephen's home from 1893, Brocket Hall. The Queen thanked Lady Mount Stephen by presenting her with an oil portrait of herself.|$|E
25|$|In 1905, King Alfonso XIII of Spain made an {{official}} state {{visit to the}} United Kingdom. Victoria Eugenie's uncle, King Edward VII, hosted a dinner in Buckingham Palace, in honour of the Spanish king. Alfonso was seated between Queen Alexandra and Princess Christian of Schleswig-Holstein, King Edward's sister. He noticed Victoria Eugenie and asked who the dinner guest with almost white hair was. Everybody knew that King Alfonso {{was looking for a}} suitable bride and one of the strongest candidates was Princess Patricia of Connaught, daughter of King Edward's brother, the Duke of Connaught. As Princess Patricia seemed not to be impressed by the Spanish monarch, Alfonso indulged his interest in Victoria Eugenie, and so the courtship began. When Alfonso returned to Spain he frequently sent postcards to Victoria Eugenie and spoke of her approvingly. His widowed mother, Queen Maria Cristina, did not like her son's choice, in part because she considered the Battenbergs non-royal because of the obscure origin of Prince Henry's mother, and in part because she wanted her son to marry within her own family, the Habsburgs from Austria. Another obstacle to a marriage was Victoria Eugenie's Protestantism (Alfonso was Roman Catholic; she was Anglican). Another potential problem was haemophilia, the disease that Victoria had transmitted to some of her descendants. Eugenie's brother Leopold was a <b>haemophiliac,</b> so there was a 50% probability that Victoria Eugenie would be a carrier, although the degree of risk was not yet known. Still, if Alfonso married her, their issue could be affected by the disease. Nonetheless, Alfonso was not dissuaded.|$|E

40|$|METHODS: Our index {{cases were}} 602 sexually active HIV-positive <b>haemophiliacs</b> (aged 18 years or more) {{enrolled}} in the Italian Registry of Haemophilia. Data on the demographic and clinical status of the <b>haemophiliacs,</b> whether their partners had undergone HIV testing, {{and the results of}} these tests were collected. RESULTS: To date, 205 (34. 1 %) partners of HIV-positive <b>haemophiliacs</b> have been tested for HIV, of whom 27 (13. 2 %) were seropositive. On univariate analysis, <b>haemophiliacs</b> who were unmarried, younger, and asymptomatic were less likely to have partners who had been tested for HIV (P << 0. 001). On multivariate analysis, unmarried status [odds ratio (OR), 8. 4; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 5. 4 - 13. 1; P << 0. 001] and younger age (OR, 1. 9; 95 % CI, 1. 1 - 3. 2) again predicted a higher rate of non-tested partners. There was no association between the demographic and medical characteristics of HIV-seropositive <b>haemophiliacs</b> and the risk of HIV positivity among their sexual partners. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that a high proportion of sexual partners of HIV-positive <b>haemophiliacs</b> have not yet been tested for HIV. The single most important predictor of not being tested was the marital status of the index case. These results emphasize the need to strengthen prevention programmes aimed at minimizing the risk of heterosexual HIV transmission, particularly among younger unmarried <b>haemophiliacs...</b>|$|R

In response to war with Germany, George V changed the name of the royal house from Saxe-Coburg and Gotha to Windsor {{and at the same time}} adopted it as the family surname, to downplay their German origins. Subsequently, Beatrice and her family renounced their German titles; Beatrice's style reverted from HRH Princess Henry of Battenberg to her birth style, HRH The Princess Beatrice. She adopted the surname of Mountbatten. Her sons gave up their style, Prince of Battenberg. Alexander, the eldest, became Sir Alexander Mountbatten and was later given the title Marquess of Carisbrooke in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Her younger son, Leopold, became Lord Leopold Mountbatten and was given the rank of a younger son of a marquess.

In the months following the toddler's death, Alice frequently took her children to his grave to pray and was melancholy on anniversaries associated with him. In the autumn of 1878 Irene, her siblings (except for Elizabeth) and her father became ill with diphtheria. Her younger sister Princess Marie, nicknamed [...] "May," [...] died of the disease. Her mother, exhausted from nursing the children, also became infected.

However, Empress Victoria was shocked because Irene did not wear a shawl or scarf to disguise her pregnancy when she was pregnant with her first son, the <b>haemophiliac</b> Prince Waldemar, in 1889. Empress Victoria, who was fascinated by politics and current events, also couldn't understand why Heinrich and Irene never read a newspaper.

40|$|Antibody {{to human}} T {{lymphotropic}} virus type III (anti-HTLV-III) was sought in 2150 patients in three groups at risk with a radioimmunoassay and an immunofluorescence test. Results {{by the two}} methods were closely concordant. Anti-HTLV-III was already present in some British homosexuals in 1980 and in some British <b>haemophiliacs</b> in 1981, and since then its prevalence has increased. Of homosexual patients needing laboratory tests for hepatitis B virus infection in 1984, 34 % of 282 in London and 5 % of 955 in five centres outside London were positive for anti-HTLV-III. Of <b>haemophiliacs</b> sampled in 1984, 38 % of 81 were anti-HTLV-III positive. Most of the seropositive <b>haemophiliacs</b> were regular recipients of commercial factor VIII concentrates. Few British intravenous drug abusers sampled in 1984 (2. 5 % of 203) were positive for anti-HTLV-III. These results show that infection with HTLV-III has rapidly become widespread among homosexuals attending sexually transmitted disease clinics and among <b>haemophiliacs</b> receiving pooled blood products. Thus, while many anti-HTLV-III positive individuals may remain asymptomatic, there may soon be a considerable increase {{in the incidence of}} the acquired immune deficiency syndrome and related disease in Britain...|$|R

Surveys on the medical and social situation of <b>haemophiliacs</b> in The Netherlands were carried out in 1972, 1978 and 1985. Most of the patients participated in these surveys.

Although the employment rate for the group of <b>haemophiliacs</b> is lower than that for the general male population, the level of employment in relation to educational achievements is high and most of the employed do not feel limited in their daily job activities by the haemophilia.

50|$|Since a male {{receives}} {{his single}} X-chromosome from his mother, {{the son of}} a healthy female silently carrying the deficient gene will have a 50% chance of inheriting that gene from her and with it the disease; and if his mother is affected with haemophilia, he will have a 100% chance of being a <b>haemophiliac.</b> In contrast, for a female to inherit the disease, she must receive two deficient X-chromosomes, one from her mother and the other from her father (who must therefore be a <b>haemophiliac</b> himself). Hence haemophilia is far more common among males than females. However, it is possible for female carriers to become mild haemophiliacs due to lyonisation (inactivation) of the X-chromosomes. <b>Haemophiliac</b> daughters are more common than they once were, as improved treatments for the disease have allowed more <b>haemophiliac</b> males to survive to adulthood and become parents.
