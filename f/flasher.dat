5|$|After {{finding out}} that Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith) was flashed in the parking lot, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) opens an investigation. He orders Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) to {{interview}} Phyllis and make a sketch of the <b>flasher.</b> However, Phyllis says she didn't {{get a good look}} at him, so Pam instead draws a picture of Dwight with a mustache and without glasses. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) assists (who also seems to notice that the sketch looks similar to Dwight) an oblivious Dwight in posting fliers with Pam's sketch on it around town.|$|E
25|$|In {{vehicles}} {{with a separate}} left and right green turn signal tell-tale on the dashboard, both left and right indicators may flash to provide visual indication of the hazard flashers' operation. In {{vehicles with}} a single green turn signal tell-tale on the dashboard, a separate red tell-tale must be provided for hazard <b>flasher</b> indication. Because the hazard <b>flasher</b> function operates the vehicle's left and right turn signals, a left or a right turn signal function may not be provided while the hazard flashers are operating, although the vehicle may activate the indicator {{and return to the}} hazard flashing phase once the indicator is deactivated.|$|E
25|$|On 5 February 2005, {{the tabloid}} paper New York Daily News {{reported}} that units at Camp Bucca organized {{and held a}} mud wrestling party on 30 October 2004. The party was organized {{by members of the}} 160th MP Battalion and attended by members of the incoming 105th MP Battalion, who were arriving to relieve the members of the 160th. At least three female GIs stripped to their undergarments and wrestled in a kiddie-pool full of sand and water in front of a crowd of male GIs, and one GI flashed her breasts. About 30 photos of the party, including one of the <b>flasher,</b> have been leaked to the press. The <b>flasher,</b> 19-year-old PFC Deanna Allen, was demoted for indecent exposure, and reportedly later discharged from the military.|$|E

In the gondola, {{next to the}} Photo Detector Module (PDM), a completely isolated Infrared camera was allocated. Also, a helicopter which shooted <b>flashers</b> flew below the balloon. We have retrieved the Cloud Top Height (CTH) with the IR camera, and also the optical depth of the nonclear atmosphere have been inferred with two approaches: The first one is with the comparison of the brightness temperature of the cloud and the real temperature obtained after the pertinent corrections. The second one is by measuring the detected signal from the helicopter <b>flashers</b> by the IR Camera, considering {{the energy of the}} <b>flashers</b> and the location of the helicopter...|$|R

Jan walks into his office to apologize in person for their earlier conversation, but when she receives Michael's voicemail, she walks out in silence. The episode ends with Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) informing Dwight he saw the <b>flasher</b> two minutes before in the women's bathroom [...] "above the sink".

500|$|The fourth episode {{features}} {{a scene where}} Mark jams his dressing gown {{in the door and}} is forced to hide naked in his new neighbour's flat. This sequence was Moffat's revenge for Bathurst's late arrival at the series one press launch at the Café Royal in Regent Street, London.

Bashaw was forced to dive when the battleship-carrier began shelling it with her main battery, and neither it nor <b>Flasher</b> was able to intercept the Completion Force.

2500|$|The second {{lighthouse}} {{was constructed}} in 1895 {{and for a while}} served as the rear light in the range. It had a , timber framed corrugated galvanized iron clad tower, with a lantern and a balcony. The original optical apparatus was a 4th order fixed lens with kerosene wick burner. In 1930 the light was converted to acetylene lighting, with sun valve and <b>flasher.</b> By 1977 the original lens had been removed and a solar powered Tideland ML-300 electric beacon installed.

2500|$|Although the Chevette was {{essentially}} a rebranded Opel Kadett C with revised front-end (detailed below), it used the 1,256cc overhead valve (OHV) engine from the Viva HC instead of the Kadett's 1,196 cc engines, which were produced by Opel. The Kadett's double wishbone front suspension, rear-wheel drive and rear suspension with Panhard rod, torque tube and coil sprung live axle were carried over unaltered. Inside, the two cars differed {{only in terms of}} their dashboard and switchgear: the Chevette stuck to the British and Japanese right-hand drive tradition of having the indicator switch on the right-hand side of the steering column, while the Kadett had the mainland European left-hand drive custom of the <b>flasher</b> stalk being on the left.

50|$|The Hackney <b>Flashers</b> were a {{collective}} of broadly socialist-feminist women who produced notable agitprop exhibitions in the 1970s and early 1980s. Working in the United Kingdom during second wave feminism (1960s - 1980s), the Hackney <b>Flashers</b> are {{an example of}} collectives prevalent {{in the latter half}} of 20th century that worked to raise consciousness of social or political issues relevant to the times. This groups' original aim was to make visible the invisible and document women's work in the home and outside of it, helping to make the case for childcare and show the complex social and economic issues of women and childcare.|$|R
50|$|In {{recent years}} {{locomotives}} {{have been fitted}} with emergency <b>flashers</b> {{on the roof of}} the cab, and these <b>flashers</b> are also activated when the brake pipe pressure is lost for any reason other than the driver's application of the brake valve. This alerts drivers of oncoming trains of the possibility of a derailed or parted rake which may foul other tracks (since brake pressure may have been lost for those reasons as well); at the locomotive, it is not possible to tell whether the loss of brake pressure is due to the pulling of the alarm chain.|$|R
