Tảng believed Thảo [...] "was a man who throughout his life fought single-mindedly for Vietnam's independence". Tảng, who later abandoned communism, said that Thảo [...] "was a nationalist, not an ideologue", and credited him with turning the military tide towards the communists by helping to bring down Diệm and fomenting chronic instability and infighting for 18 months.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the intergenerational transmission {{of education and}} investigates {{the extent to which}} early school leaving (at age 16) may be due to variations in parental background. An important contribution of the paper is to distinguish between the causal effects of parental income and parental education levels. Least squares estimation reveals conventional results – weak effects of income (when the child is 16), stronger effects of maternal education than paternal, and stronger effects on sons than daughters. We find that the education effects remain significant even when household income is included. However, when we use instrumental variable methods to simultaneously account for the endogeneity of parental education and paternal income, only maternal education remains significant (for daughters only) and becomes stronger. These estimates are consistent across various sets of instruments. The impact of paternal income varies between specifications but becomes insignificant <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>favored</b> specifications. <b>Our</b> results provide only limited support for policies that alleviate income constraints at age 16 in order to alter schooling decisions. <b>In</b> contrast, <b>our</b> results do suggest that policies which increase permanent income would lead to increased participation (especially for daughters).

40|$|We {{present the}} smoothed-particle hydrodynamics {{implementation}} SPHGal, which combines some recently proposed improvements in GADGET. This includes a pressure-entropy formulation with a Wendland kernel, a higher order estimate of velocity gradients, a modified artificial viscosity switch with a modified strong limiter, and artificial conduction of thermal energy. With {{a series of}} idealized hydrodynamic tests we show that the pressure-entropy formulation is ideal for resolving fluid mixing at contact discontinuities but performs conspicuously worse at strong shocks due to the large entropy discontinuities. Including artificial conduction at shocks greatly improves the results. In simulations of Milky Way like disk galaxies a feedback-induced instability develops if too much artificial viscosity is introduced. Our modified artificial viscosity scheme prevents this instability and shows efficient shock capturing capability. We also investigate the star formation rate and the galactic outflow. The star formation rates vary slightly for different SPH schemes while the mass loading is sensitive to the SPH scheme and significantly reduced <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>favored</b> implementation. We compare the accretion behavior of the hot halo gas. The formation of cold blobs, an artifact of simple SPH implementations, can be eliminated efficiently with proper fluid mixing, either by conduction and/or by using a pressure-entropy formulation.

40|$|We have {{obtained}} the coseismic deformation along {{line of sight}} of the 2008 Yutian earthquake, using ALOS PALSAR images and SAR interferomety technique. Based on the InSAR measurements and the constrained least square method, we studied the source parameters of this big normal event. Four schemes of inversion were constructed, with the emphasis on the effect to slip distribution inversion of the incidence angle and azimuth angle. Our inversion results show that the incidence angle has certain effect on the slip distribution, which means that a substitution of location-dependant incidence angle with constant mean incidence angle will lose some useful slip distribution on fault plane. Our inversion also shows the azimuth angle, however, has almost no obvious effect and it is an optimal choice to use the mean azimuth angle. Our most robust slip distribution can be obtained with the two parameters being location-dependant. <b>In</b> <b>our</b> <b>favored</b> inversion scheme using location dependant angles for both, the maximum slip reaches 3. 2 m.

40|$|The Niğde Massif, at the {{southern}} tip of the Central Anatolian Crystalline Complex, consists of two structural units. Foliations in the lower unit define a dome cored by migmatites. The contact between the two units bears all the elements of a ductile to brittle extensional detachment. Hence the Niğde Massif represents an extensional metamorphic core complex. Top-to-NE/ENE shearing at higher levels of the lower unit relates to displacement along the detachment. Deeper levels of the lower unit display high-temperature top-to-SSW ductile shearing. The two shearing deformations show a difference in the mean trend of stretching lineations of up to 58 °. New 40 Ar/ 39 Ar ages combined with previously published data enable us to infer that the two shears were contemporaneous. <b>In</b> <b>our</b> <b>favored</b> interpretation, oblique shearing in the core of the dome reflects lateral underflow, i. e., horizontal flowing of the lower crust in a direction highly oblique to the direction of extension. As a result of the interaction between lateral underflow and down-dip shearing along the overlying detachment, distinct structural domains are expected to exist within the migmatitic part of the core complex, with observed counterparts in the Niğde dome. Lateral underflow may reflect “inward ” flow on the scale of the core complex. Regional-scal...|$|R

CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of an incomplete discoid lateral meniscus of the right knee in an 11 year-old boy, treated with arthroscopic partial resection, which developed a re-growth of the remnant, restoring the pre-operative incomplete discoid shape. To {{the best of our}} knowledge this is the first report about re-growth of a discoid meniscus after surgery. Debate still exists regarding the etiology of a discoid meniscus. Some authors proposed it is the persistence of the normal stage during fetal development. However, most other authors believe it is anomalous and arises through variant morphogenesis. The re-growth of the discoid lateral meniscus following surgery in this patient seems to prove this latter theory. The residual growth of the knee involves also the lateral meniscus and that may have contributed to restoring the meniscus to the previous condition. CONCLUSION: This case report demonstrates discoid meniscal re-growth in a child. The growth spurt may have an impact on meniscal regeneration.
