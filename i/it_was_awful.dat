25|$|Eraserhead {{was finally}} {{finished}} in 1976, {{after five years}} of production. Lynch subsequently tried to get the film entered into the Cannes Film Festival, but while some reviewers liked it, others felt that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>awful,</b> and so it was not selected for screening. Similarly, reviewers from the New York Film Festival also rejected it, though it was screened at the Los Angeles Film Festival, where Ben Barenholtz, the distributor of the Elgin Theater, heard about it. He was very supportive of the movie, helping to distribute it around the United States in 1977, and Eraserhead subsequently became popular on the midnight movie underground circuit, and was later described {{as one of the most}} important midnight movies of the seventies along with El Topo, Pink Flamingos, The Rocky Horror Picture Show, The Harder They Come and Night of the Living Dead. The acclaimed film maker Stanley Kubrick said that it was one of his all-time favorite films.|$|E
500|$|As a {{self-described}} method actress, Kunis [...] "took her job seriously" [...] and [...] "insisted on practicing a lot", but disliked Mona's outfit in the film, which {{was different from}} what the character wore in the games: [...] "The clothes sucked. Oh my God, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>awful.</b> Mark was like bundled up in jackets and wet suits and coats and turtlenecks and I was in a leather bustier and black pants and 5-inch heels." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1884, matters {{got worse}} for the Wolverines, as they {{finished}} in last place with a 28-84 record. Bennett's batting average fell to [...]264, but his on-base percentage remained high at [...]334, and his WAR rating remained strong at 4.1. [...] Bennett later recalled the toll of multiple losing seasons in Detroit: [...] "During {{the next four years}} [...] I wished many times I was out of Detroit, or, rather, out of that team. [...] <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>awful.</b> [...] I thought sometimes we were lucky to finish last. [...] Once we lost twenty-five straight games. [...] Every week I caught a new pitcher." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>awful</b> {{having to}} bottle up {{the truth in}} one's own heart, and to laugh and jest like this; but I endured it somehow.|$|E
6000|$|Annie {{took her}} on her own ground of {{ignoring}} their past non-acquaintance. [...] "Yes, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>awful.</b> And your son--how did you leave him? Mr. Brandreth--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Yes,” was the reply: “it was {{expensive}} work. Had to match-board {{it all over}} first, of course. But the room looks cheerful now. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>awful</b> gloomy before.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope so, old boy." [...] Shyly: [...] "Say, gosh, <b>it's</b> <b>been</b> <b>awful</b> nice to {{sit around}} and loaf and gamble and act regular, with you along, you old horse-thief!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I s'pose we oughtn't to {{keep you}} any longer, Josephine. I'm sure <b>it's</b> <b>been</b> <b>awful</b> {{good of you to}} stay this long. I don't know what we'd have done without you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{that would}} <b>be</b> possible--yes, {{certainly}} <b>it</b> would <b>be</b> possible. But {{think of her}} position--the house full of wedding presents--guests coming from a distance. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>awful.</b> And you {{say there is no}} alternative." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{never heard}} such silence as {{that among the}} listeners. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>awful.</b> Checco's voice sank lower and lower, but yet every word could be {{distinctly}} heard. The tremor was increasing.|$|E
60|$|To be {{left here}} alone beside this awful jungle--never {{to hear a}} human voice or see a human face--in {{constant}} dread of savage beasts and more terribly savage men--a prey to solitude and hopelessness. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>awful.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "It can't {{be helped}} now, I s'pose, an' {{we shall have}} to get along the best way we can; but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>awful</b> wicked of you, Mr. Stubbs, an I don't know what we're goin' to do for {{something}} to eat." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! Phil," [...] {{cried the}} girl, in an earnest tone of entreaty; [...] "don't, oh, don't swear so. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>awful</b> {{to think that}} God hears you, is near you-- at your very elbow--while you thus insult Him to his face." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "See that!" [...] cried Watson, {{stepping}} back and deftly shedding his blood all down his own shirt front. [...] "You did it. With your fist you did <b>it.</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>awful.</b> I <b>am</b> fair murdered. I must again defend myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! <b>it</b> {{would have}} <b>been</b> {{better if he}} had died!" [...] sobbed Reni, [...] "for {{then he would have}} been with Jesus; but now <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>awful</b> to think of the life-long slavery; and we shall never more see him on earth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>awful</b> said," [...] said Felicity, {{wiping her}} eyes. [...] "But {{it was long}} ago and we can't do any good by crying over it now. Let us go and get {{something}} to eat. I made some nice little rhubarb tarts this morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All gone--swept {{away by the}} landslide!" [...] was the whining reply. [...] "Oh, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>awful!</b> It smashed {{them all}} up--and smashed up the horses, too! Oh, save me! Save me!" [...] And then Larry Jaley gave a gasp and fell in a heap, unable to say another word.|$|E
60|$|I cannot {{describe}} it, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>awful</b> {{to listen}} to, yet most entrancing. From the black, smoke-veiled pit where {{the fire had}} burned it welled and echoed--now a single heavenly voice, now a sweet chorus, and now an air-shaking thunder as of a hundred organs played to time.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I am {{not sure}} even now that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> the truth," [...] said Robina-- [...] "the child {{does not seem to}} possess a proper conscience. What she will grow up like, if {{something}} does not happen to change her, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>awful</b> to think." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>awful</b> {{to think}} of the ruinous effects of sin, and how nearly men can come to {{resemble}} devils. This monster actually laid plots to entrap his men in order that he might have an excuse to vent his hatred on them.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{heroes in}} stories are always nice," [...] said Felicity, with {{apparent}} irrelevance. [...] "They're always so tall and slender. Wouldn't <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>awful</b> funny {{if any one}} wrote {{a story about a}} fat hero--or about one with too big a mouth?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} lost in the timber since yesterday," [...] he said. [...] "Oh, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>awful,</b> the wind and the snow, and the intense cold. Sometimes I could not feel my feet, and I knew I was {{freezing}} to death. And I hadn't a mouthful to eat!" ...|$|E
60|$|The colour {{was in her}} cheeks. To {{have spoken}} {{outright}} about her mother--still, it was only to Mr. Bowley, who loved her, as everybody must; but to speak was unnatural to her, yet <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>awful</b> to feel, as she had done all day, that she MUST tell some one.|$|E
6000|$|... (DAN: [...] "Great snakes, who {{got that}} up? I'll bet it was Peter." [...] FELICITY, WITH DIGNITY: [...] "Well, it's more than YOU could do.

5000|$|The Daily Mail wrote: [...] "he general {{consensus}} <b>is</b> that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>awful.</b> So awful, in fact, that it's amazing.

6000|$|... "This is terrible," [...] Peter said, {{as almost}} breathless {{they watched the}} storm of fire on and around the breach.

6000|$|Laura {{suddenly}} shuddered, {{and then}} said, with an unshaken voice, [...] "Yes. Just when I had finished reading the second letter from Isidore Smythe announcing his success.

The cries that came over the water awakened us to a realisation that some great tragedy had occurred.|$|E
6000|$|I stood where I had stopped, {{just inside}} the door, trembling, {{scarcely}} breathing, so stunned by the terrible sight of those clothes that I could not move, nor scarcely think.

6000|$|... "'"So I have," [...] said he, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>awful</b> to {{hear the}} tones that he said it in. He had a very dark, fearsome face, and a gleam in his eyes that comes back {{to me in my}} dreams. His hair and {{whiskers}} were shot with gray, and his face was all crinkled and puckered like a withered apple.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now {{that you}} have told me this," [...] Millicent said, [...] "I cannot blame you, Mark, for {{determining}} to hunt the man down.

5000|$|In Season 3 of Jerry Seinfeld's web series, Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee, Jerry and his guest, Jay Leno, both {{partake in}} a $75 cup of [...] "cat shit coffee."

60|$|You don't {{know how}} I {{want to come}} home and see you all; you, dear mother, and Jeff and Mat and all.
