50|$|Fire {{regimes are}} {{characterized}} {{based on their}} frequency, intensity, extent, type, and seasonality. Fire frequency is the average time a fire burns in a given area. Fire intensity {{is the amount of}} heat released over time. Fire extent is the size and spatial similarities of the burning. Fire types or fire spread include ground fire, surface fire, and crown fire. Ground fires use <b>glowing</b> <b>combustion</b> to burn organic matter in the soil. Surface fires burn leaf litter, fallen branches, and ground plants. Crown fires burn through to the top layer of tree foliage. Seasonality is the period of time during the year that the fuels of a specific ecosystem can ignite.|$|E

The investigation {{has been carried out}} using a modified model airplane engine. The whole study can be divided into two main parts; in the first, the nature of the <b>glow</b> plug <b>combustion</b> was investigated through experiments on a metal engine and by use of optical diagnostics. Once the <b>glow</b> plug <b>combustion</b> process was fully understood, the engine was modified in order to achieve pure HCCI operations. Initially, a basic investigation was carried out using a metal and optical engine. Later, further research was performed on the main parameters affecting HCCI operations in such a small volume, i. e. the quenching distance, wall temperature and combustion chamber geometry. In addition to these studies, a model for calculating the amount of retained gas in a 2 -stroke engine was developed and a miniature HCCI free piston engine was designed from scratch...|$|R

Flaming burning was very efficient. Significant emitted hydrocarbons were methane, quantitatively followed by ethene and lower proportions of ethane, ethyne and propene. The even lower hydrocarbon emissions from final <b>glowing</b> <b>combustion</b> were strikingly different with ethyne and benzene {{as the only}} prominent non-methane hydrocarbons. Smouldering combustion caused much higher hydrocarbon concentrations. Prominent non-methane compounds were furan and ethene from initial smouldering, and ethane, ethene and benzene from after-flame smouldering.

40|$|Abstract: Spot fires create serious {{difficulties}} to {{fire suppression}} tactics, increasing their negative impact in extreme fire danger conditions. In order {{to predict the}} maximum spotting distance, the duration of combustion reaction of a given particle should be estimated. In the present article, {{the results of an}} experimental laboratory study of the combustibility of Pinus pinaster cones and scales and Eucalyptus Globullus pieces of bark that can be potential short to long distance embers in forest fires, are reported. Tests were made for values of the orientation angle of the main axis of the particles in relation to the horizontal direction or the incident wind in the range of ± 90 º and for flow velocities up to 6 m/s. Particles were ignited with a flame and mass loss due to flaming or <b>glowing</b> <b>combustion</b> of the particle was continuously registered.

40|$|Softwood pellets {{from three}} {{different}} Swedish manufacturers were burnt in laboratory scale to determine compounds emitted. The emissions were sampled on Tenax cartridges and assessed by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. No large differences in the emissions from pellets from different manufacturers were observed. The major primary semi-volatile compounds released during flaming burning were 2 -methoxyphenols from lignin. The methoxyphenols are of interest due to their antioxidant effect, which may counteract health hazards of aromatic hydrocarbons. <b>Glowing</b> <b>combustion</b> released the carcinogenic benzene as the predominant aromatic compound. However, the benzene emissions were lower than from flaming burning. To relate {{the results from the}} laboratory burnings to emissions from pellet burners and pellet stoves, chimney emissions were determined for different burning equipments. The pellet burner emitted benzene as the major aromatic compound, whereas the stove and boiler emitted phenolic antioxidants together with benzene. As the demand for pellets increases, different biomass wastes will be considered as raw materials. Ecological aspects and pollution hazards indicate that wood pellets should be used primarily for residential heating, whereas controlled large-scale combustion should be preferred for pellets made of most other types of biomass waste...|$|E

5000|$|The {{diesel engine}} (also {{known as a}} {{compression-ignition}} or CI engine) is an internal combustion engine in which ignition of the fuel that has been injected into the combustion chamber {{is caused by the}} high temperature which a gas achieves (i.e. the air) when greatly compressed (adiabatic compression). Diesel engines work by compressing only the air. This increases the air temperature inside the cylinder to such a high degree that it ignites atomised diesel fuel that is injected into the combustion chamber. This contrasts with spark-ignition engines such as a petrol engine (gasoline engine) or gas engine (using a gaseous fuel as opposed to petrol), which use a spark plug to ignite an air-fuel mixture. In diesel engines, <b>glow</b> plugs (<b>combustion</b> chamber pre-warmers) may be used to aid starting in cold weather, or when the engine uses a lower compression-ratio, or both. The original diesel engine operates on the [...] "constant pressure" [...] cycle of gradual combustion and produces no audible knock.|$|R
50|$|Brushless motors {{have become}} a popular motor choice for model {{aircraft}} including helicopters and drones. Their favorable power-to-weight ratios and wide range of available sizes, from under 5 grams to large motors rated at well into the kilowatt output range, have revolutionized the market for electric-powered model flight, displacing virtually all brushed electric motors. They have also encouraged a growth of simple, lightweight electric model aircraft, rather than the previous internal combustion engines powering larger and heavier models. The increased power-to-weight ratio of modern batteries and brushless motors allows models to ascend vertically, rather than climb gradually. The low noise and lack of mass compared to small <b>glow</b> fuel internal <b>combustion</b> engines is another reason for their popularity.|$|R
40|$|Logs {{of three}} common Southern and mid-European woods (Quercus pyrenaica, Populus nigra and Fagus sylvatica) were burned in two {{different}} combustion appliances, a fireplace and a stove. The flue gas composition was monitored continuously in the exhaust ducts of both burning appliances for total hydrocarbons (THC) and carbon oxides (CO 2 and CO). Particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter below 2. 5 mm (PM 2. 5) was sampled in a dilution tunnel under isokinetic conditions and chemically characterised for water soluble-inorganic ions, organic and elemental carbon and levoglucosan, mannosan, and galactosan. The evolution of the emission factors of these components throughout the combustion cycle was studied. The fireplace was the combustion appliance with the highest CO, CO 2, THC and PM 2. 5 emission factors. The carbonaceous matter represented 72 e 84 % of the particulate mass emitted, regardless of species burned and combustion devices. OC/EC ratios were higher for the fireplace than for the stove, and showed a significant potential relation with Kþ/levoglucosan. The dominant water soluble inorganic ions in smoke particles were Kþ, PO 3 4, SO 2 4, and Naþ. Anhydrosugar emissions were strongly enhanced in the start-up phase, when lower temperatures are registered, and decreased progressively until the <b>glowing</b> <b>combustion</b> phase. However, Kþ emission seems to be higher in flaming-dominated combustion at higher temperature. Statistical analyses, including the KruskaleWallis test, principal component analysis and Pearson correlation between emission factors, were carried out. A significant correlation between NH 4 þ and levoglucosan was found for both appliances...|$|E
40|$|Emissions {{of organic}} {{compounds}} from wood burning {{in a modern}} ecolabelled residential boiler (30 kW) were studied. Smoke was collected in the chimney outlet at different times during the burning cycle for subsequent analysis by gas chromatography. The studied ecolabelled wood boiler had high combustion efficiency, and the flaming phase emissions were very low. The greenhouse gas methane (CH 4) was determined in low concentrations of about a few mg m&# 8722; 3 and was the major volatile hydrocarbon emitted. The CH 4 emission factor was calculated to 0. 04 g kg&# 8722; 1 dry fuel. Benzene, in the range 0. 1 - 1 mg m&# 8722; 3, was the predominant aromatic compound emitted. Other major aromatic compounds were methylbenzene, dimethylbenzenes and ethenylbenzene. The concentrations of the studied polycyclic aromatic compounds were generally low, except for naphthalene, which was the third most prominent aromatic compound. However, the total emissions of these health and environmentally hazardous compounds were low. The already low emissions {{of most of the}} organic compounds decreased further {{towards the end of the}} burning cycle, although the concentration of carbon monoxide (CO) increased. This indicates that large CO emissions are not necessarily linked to large emissions of organic compounds. Relative to benzene, the concentrations of many of the aromatic compounds studied were higher in the <b>glowing</b> <b>combustion</b> phase, than in the flaming combustion phase. The total environmental and health impact of the studied emissions from the ecolabelled boiler is considered to be low. This wood boiler can be recommended as an environmentally sound residential heating alternative...|$|E
40|$|The article {{considers}} a calculation method for the non-stationary thrust of pulsejet ejector nozzle {{that is based}} on detonation combustion of gaseous fuel. To determine initial distributions of the thermodynamic parameters inside the detonation tube was carried out a rapid analysis based on x-t-diagrams of motion of <b>glowing</b> <b>combustion</b> products. For this purpose, the section with transparent walls was connected to the outlet of the tube to register the movement of products of combustion. Based on obtained images and gas-dynamic and thermodynamic equations the velocity distribution of the combustion products, its density, pressure and temperature required for numerical analysis were calculated. The world literature presents data on distribution of parameters, however they are given only for direct initiation of detonation at the closed end and for chemically "frozen" gas composition. The article presents the interpolation methods of parameters measured at the temperatures of 2500 - 2800 K. Estimation of the thermodynamic parameters is based on the Chapman-Jouguet theory that the speed of the combustion products directly behind the detonation wave front with respect to the wave front is equal to the speed of sound of these products at a given point. The method of minimizing enthalpy of the final thermodynamic state was used to calculate the equilibrium parameters. Thus, a software package «IVTANTHERMO», which is a database of thermodynamic properties of many individual substances in a wide temperature range, was used. An integral thrust was numerically calculated according to the ejector nozzle surface. We solved the Navier-Stokes equations using the finite-difference Roe scheme of the second order. The combustion products were considered both as an inert mixture with "frozen" composition and as a mixture in chemical equilibrium with the changing temperature. The comparison with experimental results was made. The above method can be used for rapid analysis of thermodynamic processes inside a jet engine or other process plants without the use of hard-expensive multicomponent kinetic calculations. </p...|$|E
5000|$|The Cox [...]049 Engine is a 2-stroke {{internal}} <b>combustion</b> <b>glow</b> plug engine. These engines use a {{glow plug}} {{to heat the}} fuel/air within the cylinder to start.

The self ignition is due to the heat produced from the compression of the air/fuel mix, and the catalytic reaction of the platinum element in the glow plug and the methanol in the fuel and does not depend in any way upon the continued use of the battery. Fuel intake to the engine is controlled by a simple needle valve and venturi system. Fuel/air mixture intake to the crankcase is controlled via a reed valve or rotary valve depending on the engine design.|$|R

40|$|If a {{subsurface}} {{layer of}} peat is ignited, it smoulders (flameless combustion) slowly but steadily. These fires propagate {{for long periods of}} time (days, weeks, even years), are particularly difficult to extinguish and can spread over very extensive areas. Smouldering fires have an impact on the soil since the fuel burning is the combustible portion of the soil itself. An example of a peat fire is the recent wildfire that occurred this summer in Rothiemurchus, near Aviemore (Scotland). A 40 year old plantation of lodgepole pine of about 15 ha was burned accidentally. The main fire was extinguished within three days, but the peat underneath the forest continued to smoulder for more than thirty days, destroying the tree roots. Peat combustion processes remain mostly unknown to the fire community and more experimental and theoretical studies are needed. It is known that the smouldering of underground fuels is governed by the diffusion of heat and oxygen through the soil layers between the reaction site and the surface. It is highly desired to conduct more experiments on smouldering (aka <b>glowing)</b> <b>combustion</b> of peat to allow derivation of fire maps for forecast from information in the weather maps. The main factor controlling factor ignition is moisture content. This paper reports the measurements and observations from smouldering box experiments using peat from the UK. The smouldering box is a simple procedure which captures the essentials of peat ignition and burning. The test is conducted in a small box (side of ~ 20 cm) made of insulating side-walls and open on the top. The sample is ignited using an electrically heated coil running along one side of the peat. A successful ignition is followed by sustained smouldering combustion that consumes the sample. Temperature and spread rates are measured, and the residue is weighed and described. In our series of experiments we have found that the critical moisture content below which ignition is highly probable is 120 % ± 10 % (in dry basis). We found that this value compare well with that reported by researcher in Canada (~ 110 %) and Indonesia (> 120 %), which suggests that critical moisture content depends weakly on peat origin...|$|E
40|$|To build multi story {{buildings}} out {{of timber}} is {{of a common}} interest in the building sector. Timber as a building material has many profits, such as the low cost, the availability {{and the ability to}} recycle it, the low carbon footprint and the workability. Although, when it comes to fire protection of buildings with a timber based structure there are challenges regarding prevention of the spread of fire while timber surface is exposed to fire. There have been cases in which timber buildings have caught fire leading to severe fire spread and ruined buildings. One example concerns a student modulus accommodation in Luleå that caught fire in august 2013. The fire started on the fourth floor after which a vertical fire spread occurred in concealed spaces between the volume modules. According to the fire investigation lack of knowledge regarding performance of detailed building solutions has led to the poor fire performance of the building. This master thesis mainly consists of a model scale tests that is prepared and performed according to the standard EN 1363 - 1. The purpose of the test is to investigate the performance of various cavity barriers exposed to fire. The main objective is to examine which temperatures that can be expected at different positions at various cavity barriers when using model scale test as a test method. There are two main kinds of cavity barriers: barriers that are airtight and closed inside the voids of the construction; and ventilated barriers. The most common cavity barriers {{are the ones that are}} airtight and closed. The material can be solid wood, gypsum board or mineral wool. The installation areas for these cavity barriers are anywhere, besides where the concealed spaces shall be ventilated and in every joint that shall be sealed using sealant. The ventilated cavity barriers are mounted in concealed spaces where the ventilating function is provided. These concealed spaces are often situated in, for example, ventilated attics, facades and roofs. The purpose of the ventilated barriers is to maintain the air flow in the cavity during regular conditions but also to form a protecting barrier between fire compartments when exposed to fire. The model scale test includes test apparatuses such as thermocouples and a fire resistance furnace with plate thermometers and burners. In addition, a test rig consisting of test specimens and the products to be tested are essential.   In this report, two model scale tests have been performed and prepared according to EN  1363 ‑ 1. The test period endured for four hours and the thermocouples measured the temperatures during the whole time. During the first hour the test specimens were exposed to the standard ISO 834 fire curve by controlling the burners in the furnace. After one hour the burners were turned off and the specimens were no longer exposed to fire. The measurements of the temperatures continued during three more hours. After the first two of these three hours the furnace was opened to confer more oxygen in the purpose to record any changes in the temperatures. Results of the performed experiments have indicated parameters that affect the performance of the cavity barriers. The cavity surface itself has an influence to the fire spread. The number of barriers in the cavity and the material properties of the material that is used as the cavity barrier lead to the different protection by those cavity barriers. Some of the tested barriers were plastic covered, which had effect on the performance of the cavity barriers. The dimensions of the barriers, moreover the width and the thickness, are important parameters for the proper function of the barrier. The test results indicate that <b>glowing</b> <b>combustion</b> occurs in the cavity between various cavity barriers.   It can be seen that the temperature rises when the furnace is opened. This indicates the appearance of smouldering since the combustion increases when the amount of oxygen increases, which leads to a temperature rise. Furthermore, the appearance of smouldering (<b>glowing</b> <b>combustion)</b> can be indicated by the observation of the damages of the specimens after the test. The temperatures that may be expected at the unexposed side of the cavity barrier depend on the surface material of the cavity, dimensions, and the material of the cavity barriers. Smouldering is a consequence of the temperature rise in closed cavities between cavity barriers. The performed test endured for approximately four hours and this indicates that fires in cavities can stay for a long time. To ensure the performance of various cavity barriers and verification by a model scale test it is important to perform further experiment and analyses to investigate the effects of the various parameters. To ensure the effectiveness of the performance of the cavity barriers they should be tested in cavities with various widths and various heights. Further investigation of the risk for smouldering is needed with measuring the amount of oxygen and the pressure...|$|E
40|$|Miniature <b>glow</b> {{ignition}} internal <b>combustion</b> (IC) {{piston engines}} are an off-the-shelf technology that could dramatically increase the endurance of miniature electric power supplies {{and the range}} and endurance of small unmanned air vehicles provided their overall thermodynamic efficiencies can be increased to 15 % or better. This thesis presents the first comprehensive analysis of small (reliable measurements of engine performance and losses in these small engines. Methodologies are also developed for measuring volumetric, heat transfer, exhaust, mechanical, and combustion losses. These instruments and techniques are used to investigate the performance of seven single-cylinder, two-stroke, glow fueled engines {{ranging in size from}} 15 to 450 g (0. 16 to 7. 5 cm 3 displacement). Scaling rules for power output, overall efficiency, and normalized power are developed from the data. These will be useful to developers of micro-air vehicles and miniature power systems. The data show that the minimum length scale of a thermodynamically viable piston engine based on present technology is approximately 3 mm. Incomplete combustion is the most important challenge as it accounts for 60 - 70 % of total energy losses. Combustion losses are followed in order of importance by heat transfer, sensible enthalpy, and friction. A net heat release analysis based on in-cylinder pressure measurements suggest that a two-stage combustion process occurs at low engine speeds and equivalence ratios close to 1. Different theories based on burning mode and reaction kinetics are proposed to explain the observed results. High speed imaging of the combustion chamber suggests that a turbulent premixed flame with its origin {{in the vicinity of the}} glow plug is the primary driver of combustion. Placing miniature IC engines on a turbulent combustion regime diagram shows that they operate in the 'flamelet in eddy' regime whereas conventional-scale engines operate mostly in the 'wrinkled laminar flame sheet' regime. Taken together, the results show that the combustion process is the key obstacle to realizing the potential of small IC engines. Overcoming this obstacle will require new diagnostic techniques, measurements, combustion models, and high temperature materials...|$|R
