Many will ask what Harlem finds to honor in this stormy, controversial and bold young captainand we will smile. Many will say turn awayaway from this man, for he is not a man but a demon, a monster, a subverter and an enemy of the black manand we will smile. They will say that he is of hatea fanatic, a racistwho can only bring evil to the cause for which you struggle! And we will answer and say to them: Did you ever talk to Brother Malcolm? Did you ever touch him, or have him smile at you? Did you ever really listen to him? Did he ever do a mean thing? Was he ever himself associated with violence or any public disturbance? For <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> you would know him. And if you knew him you would know why we must honor him... And, in honoring him, we honor the best in ourselves.|$|E

500|$|Fellini was {{particularly}} taken with Basehart, who reminded {{the director of}} Charlie Chaplin. Upon being introduced to Basehart by Cortese, Fellini invited the actor to lunch, at which he was offered the role of Il Matto. When asked why by the surprised Basehart, who had never before played {{the part of a}} clown, Fellini responded: [...] "Because, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> what you did in Fourteen Hours you can do anything." [...] A great success in Italy, the 1951 Hollywood drama starred Basehart as a would-be suicide on a hotel balcony. Basehart, too, had been greatly impressed by I Vitelloni, and agreed to take the role for much less than his usual salary, in part because he was very attracted by Fellini's personality, saying: [...] "It was his zest for living, and his humor." ...|$|E

500|$|Although Brown coached {{dozens of}} {{successful}} teams {{at the high}} school, college and professional levels, his controlling personality and sharp criticisms made him unpopular with many players. Brown was a methodical and disciplined coach who tolerated no deviation from his system. His professional teams' planes did not wait for players who were late; anyone who missed the flight was forced to find one {{on his own and}} pay a fine to Brown. When the Browns practiced twice in a day in training camp, each session was exactly 55 minutes. Regular practices during the season lasted an hour and 12 minutes. Players who made mistakes in games were held up for ridicule during film review sessions. [...] "There got to be a saying", longtime Browns safety Ken Konz said years later. [...] "'There's a right way, a wrong way and the Paul Brown way.' <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> it the Paul Brown way, you were right. He was a very strict coach, and he expected you to toe the line." ...|$|E
500|$|Minority Report was {{the first}} film to have an entirely digital {{production}} design. Termed [...] "previz", as an abbreviation of previsualization (a term borrowed from the film's narrative), production designer Alex McDowell said the system allowed them to use Photoshop in place of painters, and employ 3-D animation programs (Maya and XSI) to create a simulated set, which could be filled with digital actors then used to block out shots in advance. The technology also allowed the tie-in video game and special effects companies to cull data from the previs system before the film was finished, which they used to establish parameters for their visuals. When Spielberg quickly became a fan, McDowell said [...] "t became pretty clear that [...] wouldn't read an illustration as a finished piece, but <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> it in Photoshop and created a photorealistic environment he focused differently on it." [...] Filming took place from March 22 to July 18, 2001, in Washington, D.C., Virginia, and Los Angeles. Film locations included the Ronald Reagan Building (as PreCrime headquarters) and Georgetown. The skyline of Rosslyn, Virginia is visible when Anderton flies across the Potomac River. During production, Spielberg made regular appearances on a video-only webcam based in the craft services truck, both alone and with Tom Cruise; together they conferenced publicly with Ron Howard and Russell Crowe via a similar webcam {{on the set of}} [...] "A Beautiful Mind" [...] in New York.|$|E

[...] (40 days and nights was the length of the Biblical Great Flood.) Jones responded, [...] "Mr. Gillen, that is an interesting coincidence, but it was not by design."

2500|$|He faced media {{scrutiny}} in May 2001, when {{he refused}} to help a veteran in his riding whom he suspected of having voted for a rival candidate in the previous election. [...] Wappel {{wrote a letter to}} the constituent, asking [...] "How is it that you are writing me for my help <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not think enough of my abilities to justify voting for me?" [...] The letter was released to the media, and Wappel's remarks were widely criticized by journalists and MPs from all parties.

[...] "He was capable of both - being empathetic and being extremely confrontational! <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not do what he wanted, empathy was over!", as Gast quotes a federal minister of Kohl's own party. There was also a difference between the younger Kohl and the chancellor in his later years, a parliamentary state secretary recalled: [...] "A sense of tact and politeness? The early and the later Kohl - that was a tremendous difference. In the early years he had all of that, in the later years no more." ...|$|E

Webb responded as he had in prior press releases, expressing his regret for the repercussions of the article. Russert similarly asked Allen about a statement he made in 2000 {{in the pages of}} American Enterprise magazine: [...] "If [...] admitted women, it wouldn‚Äôt be the VMI that we‚Äôve known for 154 years. You just don‚Äôt treat women the way you treat fellow cadets. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>did,</b> it would be ungentlemanly, it would be improper."

2500|$|One of {{the oldest}} and least {{complicated}} DRM protection methods for computer and Nintendo NES games was when the game would pause and ask you to look up a certain page in the booklet that came with the game, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not have the book or entered the key wrong you could not continue. A product key, a typically alphanumerical serial number used to represent a license to a particular piece of software. During the installation process or launch for the software, the user is asked to input the key; if the key correctly corresponds to a valid license (typically via internal algorithms), the key is accepted, then the user who bought the game can continue. In modern practice, product keys are typically combined with other DRM practices (such as online [...] "activation"), as the software could be cracked to run without a product key, or [...] "keygen" [...] programs could be developed to generate keys that would be accepted.|$|E

[...] Luka Neskovic also wrote an article for The Huffington Post, [...] "How The Media Shattered The Man in the Mirror" [...] in which he said, [...] "...Except for this trial was declared a [...] "trial of the century" [...] and displayed media at their worst. Sensationalism, exclusivity, negativity, excentricism, chaos, and hysteria were some of the features. After all, that was the thing that interested them and us the most (and unfortunately there are few who do not fit into stated majority)." [...] During the trial, Matt Drudge accused the media of largely ignoring testimony and evidence that exonerated Jackson and said, [...] "Out here...Michael Jackson is being literally crucified...I think <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> a pulse poll, of people listening to these local talk shows, they would say 95% that Michael Jackson did all this...because it's based on the coverage." [...] Court TV hired tabloid journalist Diane Dimond to cover the trial even though Dimond had previously been sued by Jackson and evaded the suit with the help of prosecutor Sneddon.|$|E

2500|$|FIAC started {{holding its}} own BMX World Championships in 1984. At {{the time the}} IBMXF and FIAC were two {{separate}} International sanctioning bodies that both held BMX World Championships. However, the IBMXF's was far more prestigious, professionally competently run and established than FIAC. This was because FIAC refused help from either the IBMXF and the American for profit American Bicycle Association (then as now only one non-profit BMX sanctioning body per nation is recognized by the UCI as representing BMX in a nation. In the United States's case it was and is the NBL), both far more experienced {{at the time in}} running BMX races. In some nations if you race in the IBMXF circuit (see above) you could not race in the FIAC circuit and vice versa, akin to not being allowed to race NBL if you race the ABA circuit if they had such rules in America. FIAC had odd (to Americans) conventions and rules in conducting races, most likely grafted on from road racing in which was FIAC's only experience. For instance not only did you race three times to determine average positions in the motos to advance the best four riders to the next stage in racing, something Americans were familiar if they raced NBL, you also, if the class was big enough, raced the eighths, quarters and semis also three times and the best racers qualified for the Main. Then <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> qualify for the Main, you had to race the Main five times to find the final ranking of racers. In the US only the Professionals in the 20" [...] class raced the Main multiple times and only three times at that in either the ABA or NBL. If anything this put a premium on consistency and lowered the luck factor to a bare minimum. However, it was very time consuming even at races scheduled over two days.|$|E
