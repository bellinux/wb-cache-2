5|$|At night, {{the shallow}} reef {{platforms}} inhabited by the <b>epaulette</b> shark often become {{isolated from the}} ocean by the receding tide. The amount of dissolved oxygen in the pool can drop 80% or more overnight from the combined respiration of all the organisms within the pool. The <b>epaulette</b> shark has evolved to cope with these hypoxic conditions, being able to survive for over three hours in 5% of the atmospheric O2 level without losing behavioral responsiveness. In the laboratory, <b>epaulette</b> sharks have survived for an hour without any oxygen at 30°C (86°F), which is also unusual in that most animals capable of tolerating oxygen deprivation do so at low temperatures.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, the {{behaviour}} of an <b>Epaulette</b> shark {{was filmed}} in detail by the BBC {{for the first}} episode of a new documentary series named Shark, released around the 40th anniversary of Jaws. The documentary shows an <b>Epaulette</b> shark's ability to walk over land, and its hunting behaviours in the ebbing tide.|$|E
5|$|The <b>epaulette</b> shark is an {{opportunistic}} predator of benthic crustaceans, worms, {{and small}} bony fish. Off Heron Island, over 90% of the <b>epaulette</b> shark's diet consists of polychaete worms and crabs, with juveniles taking mostly {{the former and}} adults mostly the latter. It hunts most actively at dawn and dusk, though feeding can occur {{at any time during}} the day. This shark relies mainly on its olfactory and electroreceptive senses to locate hidden prey. It is capable of sucking prey into its mouth by expanding its muscular buccal cavity. While searching for food, the <b>epaulette</b> shark sometimes turns over debris with its snout or thrusts its head into the sand, swallowing food items while expelling the sand grains through its gill slits. Unlike most sharks, the <b>epaulette</b> shark may chew its food for up to 510 minutes. Its teeth can be depressed to form a flat surface for crushing hard-shelled prey.|$|E
25|$|When {{dressed for}} public order policing, {{officers}} wear coloured <b>epaulettes</b> indicating their respective roles. Bronze commanders wear yellow <b>epaulettes,</b> inspectors wear red <b>epaulettes,</b> sergeants wear white <b>epaulettes,</b> tactical advisors wear blue <b>epaulettes,</b> medics wear green <b>epaulettes</b> and evidence gathering officers have orange <b>epaulettes.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Epaulettes</b> were {{specified}} for all United States Army {{officers in}} 1832; infantry officers wore silver <b>epaulettes,</b> while {{those of the}} artillery and other branches wore gold <b>epaulettes,</b> following the French manner. The rank insignia was of a contrasting metal, silver on gold and vice versa.|$|R
25|$|<b>Epaulettes</b> : <b>epaulettes</b> are {{compulsory}} for {{all students}} of RUMC. The <b>epaulettes</b> of School section (grades 6-10) and College section (grades 11-12) are red and green respectively. Students of grade 6 start their academic career in RUMC with single golden stripe and end their grade 10 with five golden stripes in their red <b>epaulettes</b> while eleventh graders start with a golden stripe and end grade 12 with two golden stripes in their green <b>epaulettes.</b> Eppaulettes marked with stars and stripes are provided to the College Captain (Head Boy or Girl equivalent), prefects and other appointment holders.|$|R
5|$|As an {{adaptation}} for navigating its complex reef environment, the <b>epaulette</b> shark moves by seemingly walking, bending its body from side-to-side and pushing {{off of the}} substrate with its paddle-shaped pectoral and pelvic fins. Its gait {{is similar to that}} of salamanders, an example of convergent evolution. The shark is capable of swimming, but often prefers to walk along the sandy or coral bottom even when the water is deep enough to allow it to swim freely. The cartilaginous supports of the <b>epaulette</b> shark's paired fins are reduced and separated when compared to other sharks, allowing them to be rotated for use as limbs. This mode of locomotion even enables the shark to crawl out of the water to access isolated tidal pools. The gait of the <b>epaulette</b> shark is convergently similar to those of tetrapods such as salamanders, suggesting that the movements needed for walking on land may predate, and facilitated the evolution of, the first terrestrial vertebrates. <b>Epaulette</b> sharks are largely nocturnal and are most active in low water. They often hide inside or below coral heads, though it is enough for the head to be covered even if the rest of the body is exposed. Sometimes they perch in the open on sandy flats or atop reefs facing into the current, a form of orientation known as rheotaxis that may improve respiration or predator awareness.|$|E
5|$|<b>Epaulette</b> {{sharks are}} preyed upon by larger fishes such as other sharks. Its {{coloration}} provides protective camouflage, while its <b>epaulette</b> is speculated {{to be an}} eyespot for distracting or deterring predators. <b>Epaulette</b> sharks are almost all parasitized by the praniza (parasitic) larval stage of gnathiid isopods. The larvae feed on blood and mostly attach to the skin around the cloaca and the claspers, though they are also found inside the mouth and on the gills. These parasites cause little damage and are not believed to adversely affect {{the health of the}} shark. Other parasites of this species include a species of myxosporean in the genus Kudoa, which infests the skeletal muscles, the hemogregarine protozoan Haemogregarina hemiscyllii, which infects the blood, the ostracod Sheina orri, which attaches to the gills, and the nematode Proleptus australis, which infests the stomach.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{assessed}} the <b>epaulette</b> shark as of Least Concern. This species {{is common in}} Australian waters, where it is not captured by either commercial or recreational fisheries, and is minimally affected by collection for the aquarium trade and fishery bycatch. Much of its Australian habitat is encompassed by protected marine parks. Off New Guinea, the <b>epaulette</b> shark has been assessed as Near Threatened, as there it faces habitat degradation, destructive fishing practices, and over-exploitation by artisan fishers.|$|E
50|$|In 1829, <b>epaulettes</b> {{and wings}} were {{standardised}} by maintaining the badges of rank issued in 1810 and 1815. According to the order, <b>epaulettes</b> of all regular infantry regiments and foot guards regiments {{would be in}} gold and other regiments were in silver. All officers including field and company officers wore <b>epaulettes</b> and wings on both shoulders. The <b>epaulettes</b> over wings system was abolished. Different graded officer wore different sized bullion to distinguish themselves from other.|$|R
50|$|<b>Epaulettes</b> are {{compulsory}} for {{all students}} of KPC. The <b>epaulettes</b> of grades 3-6 and grades 7-12 are 1.25-inch and 1.50-inch wide respectively.|$|R
50|$|<b>Epaulettes</b> are {{compulsory}} for {{all students}} of BGAB. Students of grade 6 start their academic career in BGAB with single golden stripe and end their grade 10 with five golden stripes in their red <b>epaulettes</b> while eleventh graders start with a golden stripe and end grade 12 with two golden stripes in their green <b>epaulettes.</b> <b>Epaulettes</b> marked with stars and stripes are provided to the school captain (Head Boy or Girl equivalent), prefects and other appointment holders.|$|R
5|$|The <b>epaulette</b> shark (Hemiscyllium ocellatum) is {{a species}} of longtailed carpet shark, family Hemiscylliidae, found in shallow, {{tropical}} waters off Australia and New Guinea (and possibly elsewhere). The common name of this shark comes from the very large, white-margined black spot behind each pectoral fin, which are reminiscent of military epaulettes. A small species usually under 1m (3.3ft) long, the <b>epaulette</b> shark has a slender body with a short head and broad, paddle-shaped paired fins. The caudal peduncle (to which the tail fin is attached) comprises over half the shark's length. Adults are light brown above, with scattered darker spots and indistinct saddles.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} the <b>epaulette</b> shark extends from the {{southern}} coast of New Guinea to the northern coast of Australia, {{as far south as}} Sydney. The Capricorn-Bunker Group of the Great Barrier Reef contains a particularly large population, with thousands estimated to inhabit the reefs around Heron Island alone. Additionally, there are unsubstantiated reports of this species from Malaysia, Sumatra, and the Solomon Islands. <b>Epaulette</b> sharks are found in shallow water to a maximum depth of 50m (160ft), and are often seen in water barely deep enough to cover their bodies. They prefer tidal pools, coral flats, and stands of staghorn coral.|$|E
5|$|The <b>epaulette</b> shark was {{originally}} described as Squalus ocellatus by the French naturalist Pierre Joseph Bonnaterre in the 1788 Tableau encyclopédique et méthodique des trois règnes de la nature. The name was later changed to the currently valid Hemiscyllium ocellatum. The type specimen was a 35cm (14in) long immature male caught near Cooktown, Queensland, Australia. Other common names for this species are the itar shark and the blind shark (also used for Brachaelurus waddi). Goto's 2002 morphological {{analysis of the}} carpet sharks showed the genus Hemiscyllium as a polytomy, meaning that the phylogenetic relationships between the <b>epaulette</b> shark and its sister species could not be resolved.|$|E
50|$|Rank {{insignia}} is worn only by uniformed officers. Prior to mid-2009, only {{officers at}} the rank of inspector and above (commissioned officers) had the words 'Queensland Police' embroidered on their <b>epaulettes,</b> however new uniform mandates saw {{the introduction of the}} words 'Queensland Police' on all <b>epaulettes</b> issued to police officers after this date. The <b>epaulettes</b> of commissioned officers are significantly larger than the <b>epaulettes</b> of lesser ranks. Different paypoints apply within the same rank relative to years of service.|$|R
50|$|Leading {{firefighter}} - now {{referred to}} as crew commander - leading firefighter used to display one silver bar on <b>epaulettes,</b> crew commander has two bars on <b>epaulettes.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1795, {{a special}} pattern of <b>epaulettes</b> was ordered for Fusiliers and Light Infantry {{officers}}. Field officers of those regiments wore <b>epaulettes</b> over wings. Company officers wore wings.|$|R
5|$|The {{physiological}} {{responses of the}} <b>epaulette</b> shark to low oxygen are mediated by the nucleoside adenosine. In hypoxic conditions, the heart and ventilation rates drop sharply. The shark's blood pressure falls by half as the blood vessels dilate to deliver more blood to the brain and heart. Unlike in bony fishes and tetrapods, the blood flow rate remains constant {{and there is no}} elevation of blood glucose levels. The brains of sharks only consume a third as much ATP as those of teleosts. The <b>epaulette</b> shark is able to lower this energy demand further by reducing the metabolism of certain areas of its brain, e.g. keeping the sensory nuclei functional while deactivating the motor nuclei. This allows the shark to supply enough ATP to prevent neuron death, while still remaining alert to its environment.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} and pelvic fins are {{broad and}} rounded and are thickly muscled. The two similarly-sized dorsal fins are placed well {{back on the}} body. The anal fin is low and positioned {{just in front of}} the caudal fin. The caudal fin has only an upper lobe, which contains a prominent ventral notch near the tip and is angled almost horizontally relative to the body. Adult <b>epaulette</b> sharks are beige to brownish above with many widely spaced brown spots and subtle darker bands. There is a very large black spot ringed in white located behind each pectoral fin; this pair of spots are the origin of this shark's common name. Juveniles have alternating light and dark bands over their body and fins, which break up as they mature. <b>Epaulette</b> sharks are typically 7090cm (2735 in) long; the maximum reported length is 107cm (42in).|$|E
5|$|Mating in the <b>epaulette</b> shark {{takes place}} from July to December, though in captivity {{reproduction}} occurs continuously. Courtship may be {{initiated by the}} female following and biting the male. The male then holds onto the pectoral fin of the female with his mouth and lies alongside her, while inserting one of his claspers into her cloaca. Copulation lasts about {{one and a half}} minutes. <b>Epaulette</b> sharks readily breed in aquariums, even in tanks as small as 135 gallons, but larger tanks are recommended to allow room for the hatched offspring. This species is oviparous, with females depositing eggs from August to December. The female drops the egg capsules two (rarely four) at a time every 14 days, producing a total of 20ndash&50 eggs per year. Each egg case measures 10 cm (3.9 in) long and 4 cm (1.6 in) wide. The young emerge after 120ndash&130 days, at a length of 14ndash&16 cm (5.5ndash&6.3 in). The growth rate of the young is slow at first but increases to about 5 cm (2 in) per year after three months. Both males and females mature sexually at a length of 54ndash&64 cm (21ndash&25 in), corresponding to an age of at least seven years.|$|E
50|$|<b>Epaulettes</b> {{are still}} worn on some Army Full Dress, Patrol Dress, and Mess Dress uniforms. <b>Epaulettes</b> {{in the form}} of {{shoulder}} boards are worn with the officer's white Naval Service Dress.|$|R
50|$|Most PCSOs tend to wear blue <b>epaulettes</b> {{on their}} shoulders, {{although}} some forces use black <b>epaulettes.</b> Since 2009 a few forces began embroidering names on to <b>epaulettes.</b> PCSOs are issued with hi-visibility jackets and waterproof coats of varying design {{depending on the}} force. Officers may also be issued with a simple tabard for traffic duties. PCSOs wear nylon duty belts with quick release buckles to hold their equipment in pouches.|$|R
50|$|All {{students}} wear <b>epaulettes</b> {{with their}} year (designated by stripes) and service shown on them. The <b>epaulettes</b> worn by all prefects bear a white stripe {{in between the}} usual parallel purple stripes of non-prefect year 13 students.|$|R
5|$|The <b>epaulette</b> shark has an {{elongated}} body, {{over half of}} which is comprised by the slender caudal peduncle. The snout is short and rounded, with the nares placed almost at the tip along {{with a pair of}} tiny barbels; there are grooves running from the nares to the mouth. There are 2635 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 2132 tooth rows in the lower jaw. The teeth are small, with broad bases and triangular cusps. The eyes are oval in shape and elevated, with a large spiracle below each. The five pairs of gill slits are small, with the fourth and fifth very close together.|$|E

5000|$|Military <b>epaulettes</b> {{are used}} to {{represent}} ranks. In the CCG they represent levels of responsibility and commensurate salary levels. The Canadian Coast Guard Auxiliary <b>epaulettes</b> are similar except they use silver braid to distinguish them from the Canadian Coast Guard.|$|R
500|$|The {{success of}} the initial <b>Epaulettes</b> series {{inspired}} the introduction of three new varieties with different designs and denominations in October 1849. These new types replaced the <b>epaulettes</b> design with the so-called [...] "Medallion" [...] (Médaillon) type, featuring Leopold I's portrait within a circular medallion window. In the same issue, a new denomination of forty centimes in red was produced for overseas mail. It was rumoured {{at the time that}} Leopold I did not like the design at the time, and believed that the <b>epaulettes</b> gave him a childlike aspect. The <b>Epaulettes</b> were officially superseded in 1859, but remained legally valid until 1 July 1866 when, following Leopold I's death, all stamps bearing his effigy were demonetised.|$|R
50|$|In 1855, army officers' large, gold-fringed <b>epaulettes</b> were {{abolished}} {{and replaced}} by a simplified equivalent officially known as twisted shoulder-cords. These were generally worn with full dress uniforms until 1939. Naval officers retained the historic fringed <b>epaulettes</b> for full dress during this period.|$|R
