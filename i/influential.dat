40|$|A central idea in {{marketing}} and diffusion research is that influentials-a minority {{of individuals who}} influence an exceptional number of their peers-are important {{to the formation of}} public opinion. Here we examine this idea, which we call the "influentials hypothesis," using a series of computer simulations of interpersonal influence processes. Under most conditions that we consider, we find that large cascades of influence are driven not by <b>influentials</b> but by a critical mass of easily influenced individuals. Although our results do not exclude the possibility that <b>influentials</b> can be important, they suggest that the <b>influentials</b> hypothesis requires more careful specification and testing than it has received.

40|$|We {{model the}} {{diffusion}} of innovations in markets with two segments: <b>influentials</b> who are more in touchwith new developments and who affect another segment of imitators whose own adoptions do not affect the <b>influentials.</b> This two-segment structure with asymmetric influence is consistent with several theories in sociology and diffusion research, {{as well as many}} “viral ” or “network ” marketing strategies. We have four main results. (1) Diffusion in a mixture of <b>influentials</b> and imitators can exhibit a dip or “chasm ” between the early and later parts of the diffusion curve. (2) The proportion of adoptions stemming from <b>influentials</b> need not decrease monotonically, but may first decrease and then increase. (3) Erroneously specifying a mixed-influence model to a mixture process where <b>influentials</b> act independently from each other can generate systematic changes in the parameter values reported in earlier research. (4) Empirical analysis of 33 different data series indicates that the two-segment model fits better than the standard mixed-influence, the Gamma/Shifted Gompertz, and the Weibull-Gamma models, especially in cases where a two-segment structure is likely to exist. Also, the two-segment model fits about as well as the Karmeshu-Goswami mixed-influence model, in which the coefficients of innovation and imitation vary across potential adopters in a continuous fashion.

40|$|Robert E. Lane : Adolescent {{political}} maturation in the United States and in Germany. On {{the basis}} of data from national sample surveys in the United States and Germany, the author constructs a typology of family Influence in adolescence: (1) <b>influentials,</b> (2) rebels, (3) submissives. There are proportionately more <b>Influentials</b> and Rebels in the United States and more Submissives in Germany. In both countries greater education and affiliation with Protestant churches {{are associated with a}} sense of appropriate influence, while submissive attitudes are encouraged by less education and Catholicism. In the United States it seems that shared parental control is associated with a greater sense of influence. Submissives in both countries participate less in politics than others, and, more importantly, Rebels participate less than <b>Influentials.</b> In Germany but not in the United States, Rebels are more likely to follow their parents political tradition than are <b>Influentials,</b> a phenomenon interpreted as possibly reflecting adult guilt over youthful rebellion,Lane Robert E.

40|$|The {{purposes}} {{of the study were}} to identify persons who had primarily influenced selected educational decisions made in Indiana between January 1, 1982 an December 31, 1985 and to develop a composite profile of the personal characteristics of the primary <b>influentials.</b> Further purposes were to identify sources of power and methods utilized by the primary <b>influentials</b> to affect the educational decisions. A survey of selected educational leaders was utilized to identify the selected educational decisions. A Delphi technique consisting of a series of four sequential surveys of selected educational leaders, and elected and appointed state officials was utilized to identify the primary influencers, sources of power, methods of influencing, and to develop a composite profile of the primary <b>influentials.</b> The following are selected findings: 1. Seven persons were identified as constituting an inner core of the power structure, however, none were identified for all five of the selected decisions and nonprimary <b>influentials</b> were identified in the peripheral of the power structure for each decision. 2. In three of the five selected decisions two persons were invested with the primary power of decision-making, with three and four persons invested for each of the other selected decisions. 3. Politics, money, power, selling self and improving education were the primary factors impacting educational decisions. Data collected supported the following conclusions: 1. A pyramidal power structure exists in Indiana and functions to influence educational decisions. 2. The inner core of the power structure consist of positional leaders; the Governor, Governor's Aide, and Chairmen of powerful legislative committees; Senate Finance, House Ways and Means, and House Education committees. 3. The power structure does not include females, non-whites, minority party members, lower income persons, nor residents of Southern Indiana. 4. Education of students is a secondary consideration by many <b>influentials</b> regarding decisions impacting K- 12 public education in Indiana with Party politics and money considered more often than educating students. 5. Educators are devisive and do not play a primary role in the decisions impacting K- 12 public education and are {{not a part of the}} power structure. Thesis (D. Ed. ...|$|R
40|$|Firms are {{increasingly}} focusing on understanding and managing their social media strategies {{in order to}} create discussions and optimize the spread of news in their communities. Most prior studies on information dissemination have mainly focused on the roles of <b>influentials</b> but ignored the essential for noninfluentials. To fill this gap, this paper takes a holistic view of the information dissemination process and investigates how the participation of both <b>influentials</b> and noninfluentials plays a role in affecting the volume and sentiment of microblogs, which are precursors to raise awareness and attraction for brands. To test our hypotheses, we build a novel econometric model and apply it to a dataset collected from the popular microblogging site Twitter. We have the following main results: (1) back-and-forth-type discussions and retweets are effective in generating awareness and positive attractiveness; (2) <b>influentials</b> or mavens (who have many followers but seldom follow others) help generate initial sparks toward microblogging, but during the cascading periods, the noninfluentials {{play an important role in}} driving the conversations; and (3) new users who gradually join the discussions also help increase awareness, although they may not generate a positive sentiment. Our results provide important implications for mediating consumer interactions and firms’ marketing strategies. TÜBİTA...|$|R
