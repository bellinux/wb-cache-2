5|$|Due to the {{significant}} reclamation {{on the two}} sites very little evidence remains of the power stations, other than {{a small number of}} bricks and steel rods. Some minor structures have survived to the North West of the North station's site, including a road bridge over the rail line which served the station, a brick wall, and a concrete staircase. More obvious remains of the power stations are their three large sub-stations that still supply the local region. Much of this electrical power is generated in Scotland's Cockenzie power station, transported via a 275 <b>kilovolt</b> (kV) and a 400 kV connection.|$|E
5|$|Power is {{distributed}} over multiple 500 <b>kilovolt</b> (kV) transmission lines. Three direct current (DC) {{lines to the}} East China Grid carry 7,200 MW: Three Gorges – Shanghai (3,000 MW), HVDC Three Gorges – Changzhou (3,000 MW), and HVDC Gezhouba – Shanghai (1,200 MW). The alternating current (AC) lines to the Central China Grid have a total capacity of 12,000 MW. The DC transmission line HVDC Three Gorges – Guangdong to the South China Grid has a capacity of 3,000 MW.|$|E
5|$|In January 2015, Florida State University's Center for Advanced Power Systems has {{unveiled}} a new 24,000-volt direct current power test system, {{the most powerful}} of its kind available at a university research center throughout the world. The new test facility is the latest piece of the center's PHIL testing program. It has a 24,000-volt direct current with a capacity of 5 megawatts, making it the most powerful PHIL system of its kind at a university research center worldwide. To create the new system, the center put together four individual 6 <b>kilovolt,</b> 1.25 megawatt converters that can be arranged in any combination, in series or parallel connection, to form an extremely flexible test bed for medium voltage direct current (MVDC) system investigations.|$|E
50|$|The Swiss {{transmission}} grid, 6,700 km in length, {{operates at}} voltages of 220 <b>kilovolts</b> and 380 <b>kilovolts</b> and a frequency of 50 Hz. It has 141 substations and 12,000 electricity pylons. The electricity transported in 2016 amounted to 73‘775 Gigawatt hours (GWh).|$|R
50|$|Power is {{supplied}} to the SWER line by an isolating transformer {{of up to}} 300 kVA. This transformer isolates the grid from ground or earth, and changes the grid voltage (typically 22 or 33 <b>kilovolts</b> line to line) to the SWER voltage (typically 12.7 or 19.1 <b>kilovolts</b> line to earth).|$|R
40|$|A {{spectrograph}} of the Seemann type {{has been}} constructed {{for the purpose}} of investigating the radiation from the high potential x-ray tube at the California Institute. A typical spectrogram obtained with 600 <b>kilovolts</b> on the tube is presented. The photometer record shows a continuous spectrum with its maximum intensity at about 200 <b>kilovolts</b> and a short wave-length limit in the neighborhood of 600 <b>kilovolts.</b> The range covered is roughly from 100 to 20 x-units. It is proposed to use the apparatus for determining absorption coefficients by photographing the spectrum of radiation which has passed through an absorbing screen. No anomalies of any kind have been observed so far...|$|R
5|$|The Waterloo Wind Farm is a 111 MW {{wind farm}} which was {{completed}} in 2010 at an estimated cost of $300 million. Thirty-seven Vestas V90 3 MW turbines stretch over the 18km wind farm site and are connected through a 33 <b>kilovolt</b> (kV) internal reticulation network to the wind farm substation. The wind farm is approximately 30 kilometres south-east of the township of Clare and 100km north of Adelaide. A Stage 2 expansion was approved to add up to an additional 6 turbines to the existing farm and increase its total generating capacity to over 130 MW. Expansion is expected to commence in 2016.|$|E
5|$|The station's {{boiler house}} houses three 380MWth International Combustion boilers, which are fuelled by {{pulverised}} bituminous coal. Each of these provide steam {{for one of}} three 140 megawatt (MW) Parsons turbo-alternators, situated in the station's turbine hall. These give the station a total generating capacity of 420MW. The electricity generated was fed at 24 <b>kilovolt</b> (kV) to a substation to power the smelter during operation. The substation also has a 132kV connection to the National Grid, where electricity is distributed to homes and other industries by Northern Electric Distribution Limited. The smelter's two pot lines required 310MW of the 420MW that the power station produces, so the excess 110MW which was fed into the national grid. Since the mothballing of the smelter, all exports now go to the grid.|$|E

25|$|On 29 December 1993 Union Rotorua {{was about}} 27 {{miles south of}} Sydney Heads, en route for Melbourne, when a fire {{broke out in the}} gas turbine house. It was {{established}} that the seat of the fire was in one of the cubicles of the 6.6 <b>kilovolt</b> switchboard, which distributed power from the gas turbine generator to the propulsion motors and auxiliary electrical systems. Initial attempts to fight the fire with extinguishers proved to be ineffective and a decision was made to utilise the fixed fire fighting medium and flood the space with CO2. This was effective in extinguishing the fire. With the high voltage switchboard out of commission, the vessel was towed to Sydney, where it remained for three months undergoing repairs.|$|E
25|$|More {{rarely a}} {{defect in the}} magnet can cause a quench. When this happens, that {{particular}} spot is subject to rapid Joule heating from the enormous current, which raises {{the temperature of the}} surrounding regions. This pushes those regions into the normal state as well, which leads to more heating in a chain reaction. The entire magnet rapidly becomes normal (this can take several seconds, {{depending on the size of}} the superconducting coil). This is accompanied by a loud bang as the energy in the magnetic field is converted to heat, and rapid boil-off of the cryogenic fluid. The abrupt decrease of current can result in <b>kilovolt</b> inductive voltage spikes and arcing. Permanent damage to the magnet is rare, but components can be damaged by localized heating, high voltages, or large mechanical forces.|$|E
2500|$|The 50/60Hz {{currents}} {{in the primary}} circuit of a Tesla coil are lethally dangerous, and require standard safety precautions used with other <b>kilovolt</b> electrical devices. [...] However, the high voltage radio frequency (RF) discharges from the output terminal pose a unique hazard not found in other high voltage equipment: when passed through the body they often do not cause the painful sensation and muscle contraction of electric shock, as lower frequency AC or DC currents do. [...] The nervous system is insensitive to currents with frequencies over 10 – 20kHz. [...] It is thought {{that the reason for}} this is that a certain minimum number of ions must be driven across a nerve cell's membrane by the imposed voltage to trigger the nerve cell to transmit an impulse. [...] At radio frequencies, there is insufficient time during a half-cycle for enough ions to cross the membrane before the alternating voltage reverses. [...] The danger is that since no pain is felt, experimenters often assume the currents are harmless. [...] Teachers and hobbyists demonstrating small Tesla coils often impress their audience by touching the high voltage terminal or allowing the streamer arcs to pass through their body.|$|E

40|$|Protons were {{directed}} through hydrogen gas and {{were found to}} capture electrons to form negative hydrogen ions. When sufficient gas had been traversed, the ratio of negative ions to protons reached an equilibrium value which was a maximum of 22. 2 percent at about 8. 5 <b>kilovolts.</b> The energy interval investigated was from 4 to 70 <b>kilovolts.</b> In this interval, the electron loss cross-section for the negative hydrogen ion was determined.

A determination of the electron capture cross-section for protons between the above mentioned energies was also made, and found to agree with values obtained by other workers, both theoretical and experimental.
