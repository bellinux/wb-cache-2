5|$|According to the 1991 census, the {{municipality}} of Bijeljina had approximately 97,000 inhabitants. The demographic proportions were approximately 59% Bosnian Serbs, 31% Bosniaks and 10% belonged to other ethnicities. The town of Bijeljina <b>itself</b> <b>had</b> 36,414 inhabitants, 19,024 {{of whom were}} Bosniaks (or 52% of the town's population), while the Serbs were the second largest ethnic group in the town.|$|E

In 1931, the town <b>itself</b> <b>had</b> a population of 2,315 people and was inhabited mostly by Serbs, Croats, and Jews.

5|$|The cyclone <b>itself</b> <b>had</b> minimal {{effects on}} land, but the monsoon {{advanced}} into western India in late May {{in association with}} the system. As the cyclone moved to the west away from the subcontinent, the incursion of moist air from the Arabian Sea persisted over northwestern India for the first three days of June. This brought moderate rainfall to regions of Gujarat, Rajasthan and western Madhya Pradesh.|$|E
5|$|The {{skirmish}} <b>itself</b> <b>had</b> no notable {{effect on}} {{relations between the}} people and the occupying Americans, which were already deteriorating as the siege dragged on.

5|$|After 1530, it was {{the colonists}} {{themselves}} who held the keys to power, installing new governors and removing them from office. By 1534, the Spanish colony in Honduras was close to collapse. Trujillo had a population of less than two hundred; {{it was the}} only Spanish settlement in Honduras, and very little territory beyond the town <b>itself</b> <b>had</b> been conquered. The Spanish were beset by infighting, and had provoked widespread indigenous uprisings. Simultaneously, the native population had collapsed as a result of disease, mistreatment, and the export of large numbers to work on the sugar plantations of the Caribbean islands.|$|E

The site, which appeared to be dedicated to honey sales and beekeeping, was covered in confusing random characters and sentence fragments. Dana, the ostensible webmaster of the ilovebees site, created a weblog stating that something had gone wrong with her website, and the site <b>itself</b> <b>had</b> been hacked.

5|$|Harris {{stated that}} {{the energy of the}} group was fast-paced, replicating the style of a music video, which {{children}} seem to enjoy. The educational theories incorporated were disguised with music and entertainment, with the band's work being designed to have multiple layers and cater {{for a wide range of}} ages in the audience, while being primarily aimed at those aged 2–8. Harris explained that Hi-5 was primarily a television series, but the music <b>itself</b> <b>had</b> the ability to stand alone. She expected that the series would initially become formatted into international versions, however was so confident with the original cast that the Australian series was sold overseas instead.|$|E

5|$|In 1991, {{the village}} of Borovo Selo, {{situated}} on the right bank of the Danube opposite Serbia, {{was a part of}} the Vukovar municipality. While the city of Vukovar <b>itself</b> <b>had</b> an ethnically mixed population (47.2 percent Croats and 32.2 percent Serbs), smaller settlements in the area were more homogenous. Fourteen were predominantly populated by Croats, ten (including Borovo Selo) by Serbs, two by Ruthenians and the remaining two were ethnically mixed.|$|E

Females outnumbered males 54.2% to 45.8%, and some 21.4% of {{the population}} was born overseas (see chart for a breakdown). There was only a slight change in the 2006 census, with the population increasing by 25 to 2,522. Mount Osmond <b>itself</b> <b>had</b> a population of 612 during the 2006 census.|$|E

5|$|The Princess Block {{disappeared}} from Henderson’s Directory, a local city directory, in 1956, implying that its researchers {{thought it was}} completely vacant. The building was re-included in 1960, but the theatre's former address at 10337 Whyte Avenue remained vacant and unlisted for another six years. By 1966, the exterior doors had been removed entirely to create storefronts (see photo), and the theatre <b>itself</b> <b>had</b> been occupied by Quick Cash Exchange, a pawnshop. The third floor was split into several apartments, while the second floor was entirely occupied by Strathcona TV and Columbia Photo Studio. The basement was still a pool hall, Princess Billiards.|$|E
5|$|The {{largest group}} of {{students}} during the first seven decades of the school were from Martha's Vineyard, and they brought MVSL with them. There were also 44 students from around Henniker, New Hampshire, and 27 from the Sandy River valley in Maine, each of which had their own village sign language. Other students brought knowledge of their own home signs. Laurent Clerc, the first teacher at ASD, taught using French Sign Language (LSF), which <b>itself</b> <b>had</b> developed in the Parisian school for the deaf established in 1755. From this situation of language contact, a new language emerged, now known as ASL.|$|E

The rebellion was quickly put down, and the Third Legion disbanded.|$|E
5|$|The {{pamphlet}} {{was read}} by Augustin Robespierre, brother of Maximilien Robespierre, who {{was impressed by}} the revolutionary context. The pamphlet <b>itself</b> <b>had</b> little effect against the rebellious forces, but served to advance Napoleon's career. He soon became recognised for his political ambitions by a Corsica-born politician, and family friend, Christophe Saliceti, who arranged to have it published and distributed. Christophe's influence, along with fellow Convention deputy Augustin Robespierre, advanced Napoleon into the position of senior gunner, at Toulon.|$|E
