5|$|The VT heralded the fitment of {{semi-trailing}} arm <b>independent</b> <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> {{as standard}} across the range, a significant selling point over the rival Falcon, along with increased electronics such as Traction Control. However, {{in terms of}} suspension, the original Opel design was simplified by removing the toe control links that was standard equipment on the European Omega since 1987. Consequently, this afflicted the VT with excessive tyre wear due to distortions to the suspension camber angle and toe under heavy load, such as heavy towing or when travelling over undulated surfaces.|$|E
5|$|To {{address the}} {{relatively}} poor {{reception of the}} preceding AU series, the BA series was heavily updated for launch in September 2002—the same time as its biggest rival, the Holden Commodore (VY). It featured a substantially revised and more conservative exterior styling, with every panel new except for the carry-over door skins. Interiors, too, were substantially revised, while mechanically, a new <b>independent</b> <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> setup was fitted to all sedan derivatives and the engine and transmissions received extensive upgrades. In October 2004, Ford introduced a Mark II update, bringing subtle styling and mechanical changes, and in October 2005, replaced the BA with the BF.|$|E
5|$|The VP {{update of}} 1991 {{featured}} cosmetic changes and mechanical however most were not visible {{unless you were}} to pull the motor down; and a very similar revised 3.8-litre V6 and 5.0-litre V8 engines from the VN were carried over. The 2.0-litre straight-four engine previously available in New Zealand was discontinued. Exterior cosmetic changes included a translucent acrylic grille on the base level Executive and Berlina, with a colour-coded grille for the S and SS, and a chrome grille for Calais. Updated tail lights and boot garnishes were {{also a part of}} the changes, which were different for each model, with the Berlina having grey stripes and the Calais chrome stripes. Semi-trailing arm <b>independent</b> <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> became standard on the Calais and SS, but was made an option on lower-end models in lieu of the live rear axle, improving ride and handling.|$|E
5000|$|Other updates for 2014 {{include an}} <b>independent</b> {{multilink}} <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> {{as found in}} European counterparts, and electronic power steering (1.8 TSI models only.) ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{concept was}} {{equipped}} with a 2.0-liter direct injection turbo engine rated at [...] and 220 lbft Nm mated with a 6-speed automatic transmission, MacPherson strut front and <b>independent</b> <b>rear</b> <b>suspensions,</b> four-wheel anti-lock disc brakes, 20 x 8.5 inch polished aluminum wheels with P245/40R20 tires. Featured on the car are several traditional Buick design cues: the Sweepspear, VentiPorts, a tri-color Buick trishield, and the waterfall grille.|$|R
5000|$|... 1600cc Rover K-series Caterham Sevens with <b>independent</b> DeDion <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> {{from the}} Caterham Academy 2001 - 2008. These cars are fully road legal and produce around 125 bhp.|$|R
25|$|All {{cars are}} {{required}} to use a double wishbone setup for the front suspension and <b>independent</b> <b>rear</b> <b>suspension.</b> Both {{the front and rear}} suspension systems feature adjustable shock absorbers and an anti-roll bar which can be adjusted from the cockpit.|$|E
25|$|<b>Independent</b> <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> (designed by Cadillac engineers) {{was adopted}} {{for the new}} car, which helped to {{increase}} usable rear-seat and trunk space in the smaller body, as well as improved handling over previous Toronados with no sacrifice in ride quality. Rear disc brakes were optional.|$|E
25|$|According to GM, the Cruze's body {{structure}} is 65percent high-strength steel. MacPherson struts are utilized {{in the front}} suspension with a solid torsion beam axle for the rear, avoiding the cost and complexity needed for a modern multi-link <b>independent</b> <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> used by some more expensive rivals.|$|E
5000|$|... 2002: Saab {{developed}} an <b>independent,</b> multi-link, <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> {{system on the}} new Saab 9-3 known as [...] "ReAxs", a system which provides crisp steering feedback and contributes to enhanced driving stability in curves ...|$|R
50|$|Uprated 1600cc Rover K-series Caterham Sevens with <b>independent</b> (DeDion) <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> {{from the}} Caterham Academy 2001 - 2008. These cars are semi-road legal (no lights or windscreen) and with {{controlled}} modifications produce around 140 bhp.|$|R
50|$|Engineers for the Focus, {{including}} Richard Parry-Jones, {{developed a}} class-leading, space-saving <b>independent</b> multi-link <b>rear</b> <b>suspension,</b> marketed as Control Blade suspension, combining the packaging of a trailing arm, with {{the geometry of}} a double wishbone suspension at considerably lower cost.|$|R
25|$|Progressive {{development}} of the Minicar and Minicar Deluxe continued until the more significant introduction of coil sprung <b>independent</b> <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> and the much-needed Triplex Safety glass windscreen. (The Triplex windscreen was subsequently offered by Sharp's Commercials as a retro-fit kit for the earlier Minicar.) This provided an ideal opportunity to relaunch the car as the Bond Minicar (Mark B) in July 1951.|$|E
25|$|Car Life {{magazine}} bestowed {{its annual}} Award for Engineering Excellence on the 1963 Sting Ray. Chevy's small-block V-8 – {{the most consistent}} component of past Corvette performance – was rated by the buff books to be even better in the Sting Ray. The 1963 was noted to have an edge over past models in both traction and handling because the new <b>independent</b> <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> reduced wheel spin compared to the live-axle cars.|$|E
25|$|The 1963 Sting Ray {{production}} car's lineage can {{be traced}} to two separate GM projects: the Q-Corvette, and perhaps more directly, Mitchell's racing Sting Ray. The Q-Corvette, initiated in 1957, envisioned a smaller, more advanced Corvette as a coupe-only model, boasting a rear transaxle, <b>independent</b> <b>rear</b> <b>suspension,</b> and four-wheel disc brakes, with the rear brakes mounted inboard. Exterior styling was purposeful, with peaked fenders, a long nose, and a short, bobbed tail.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} Toyota Caldina was the 5-door wagon {{or commercial}} van version (1992-2002) of the four-door sedan Toyota Corona and Toyota Carina in Japan. The wagon has <b>independent</b> strut <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> while the commercial wagon has semi-independent leaf springs.|$|R

25|$|A {{number of}} {{manufactures}} have produced vehicles or concepts utilizing <b>independent</b> front or <b>rear</b> <b>suspensions</b> supported by transverse leaf springs {{that have an}} anti-roll effect.|$|R
25|$|Two years later, {{the second}} Wolseley car is revealed. It is a {{three-wheeled}} design featuring <b>independent</b> <b>rear</b> <b>suspension,</b> mid-engine and back-to-back seating for two adults. Four {{years later the}} Wolseley Gasoline Carriage is built featuring a steering wheel instead of a tiller. Austin manages the new Wolseley company {{for a short time}} before resigning to form his own concern, the Austin Motor Company, in 1905. Wolseley later becomes a successful car and engine maker selling upmarket cars, and even opens a lavish showroom, Wolseley House, in Piccadilly London (next to the Ritz Hotel, now housing a restaurant called The Wolseley). The company is later merged in other motor car companies.|$|E
25|$|Only {{the early}} fully {{imported}} 200B sedans and coupes retained the <b>independent</b> <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> from the 180B, locally assembled 200B sedans instead switched to coil springs {{with a live}} axle, while the wagon (imported from Japan) had a live axle in the rear with leaf springs. Seen as a giant step backwards, {{the reason for the}} change was certainly not a cost-cutting measure, but simply the need for Nissan to reach an 85% local content quota that the then Federal Government demanded of Australian car manufacturers. However, in practice the live rear axle, being an Australian development, proved to actually benefit the car's overall handling dynamics.|$|E
25|$|This {{model was}} also {{released}} to New Zealand in 1977, assembled CKD in 4-door sedan and 5-door wagon forms. A coupe model was also released, imported built-up from Japan. Unlike the Australian models the sedans used the <b>independent</b> <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> {{system of the}} Japanese specification models. This Bluebird {{was the first to}} be assembled in Nissan New Zealand's own brand-new assembly plant at Wiri, South Auckland. For {{the first two years of}} assembly the cars were fitted with a 1.8-litre unit, hence they used the 180B nameplate. Automatic transmission was optional for both. Nissan also added its first luxury ZX version with this generation – features included velour upholstery, 'luxury' cut-pile carpet sourced locally and tinted glass. There was also, for the first time in Kiwi assembly, a wagon variant with mid-range trim and equipment.|$|E

50|$|The Mojo 2 is a {{redesigned}} Mojo with <b>independent</b> {{double wishbone}} <b>rear</b> <b>suspension.</b> The body was redesigned at the rear, and 2 new nose designs introduced.|$|R
5000|$|... 1600cc Ford Sigma-engined {{cars from}} the 2008 Caterham Academy onwards or 2009/10 Roadsport B. The only {{significant}} permitted changes are a swap to stickier Yokohama A048R tyres and an optional rear anti-roll bar. The cars have <b>independent</b> DeDion <b>rear</b> <b>suspension,</b> produce around 120 bhp and are fully road-legal.|$|R
25|$|The <b>independent</b> <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> Duntov {{created for}} Sting Ray was {{essentially}} a frame-mounted differential with U-jointed half-shafts tied together by a transverse leaf spring – a design derived from the CERV I concept. Rubber-cushioned struts carried the differential, which reduced ride harshness while improving tire adhesion, especially on rougher roads. The transverse spring was bolted {{to the rear of}} the differential case. A control arm extended laterally and slightly forward from each side of the case to a hub carrier, with a trailing radius rod mounted behind it. The half-shafts functioned like upper control arms. The lower arms controlled vertical wheel motion, while the trailing rods took care of fore/aft wheel motion and transferred braking torque to the frame. Shock absorbers were conventional twin-tube units. Considerably lighter than the old solid axle, the new rear suspension array delivered a significant reduction in unsprung weight, which was important since the 1963 model would retain the previous generation's outboard rear brakes. The new model's front suspension would be much as before, with unequal-length upper and lower A-arms on coil springs concentric with the shocks, plus a standard anti-roll bar. Steering remained the conventional recirculating-ball steering design, but it was geared at a higher 19.6:1 overall ratio (previously 21.0:1). Bolted to the frame rail at one end and to the relay rod at the other was a new hydraulic steering damper (essentially a shock absorber), which helped soak up bumps before they reached the steering wheel. What's more, hydraulically assisted steering would be offered as optional equipment for the first time on a Corvette – except on cars with the two most powerful engines – and offer a faster 17.1:1 ratio, which reduced lock-to-lock turns from 3.4 to just 2.9.|$|E
500|$|Two {{transmissions}} {{were available}} for the BA—a four-speed automatic and a five-speed manual, both floor-mounted. The automatic unit featured Sequential Sports Shift, a first for the Falcon nameplate in Australia. Utility body styles were also available with an optional column-mounted automatic shifter (without Sequential Sports Shift) {{in lieu of the}} floor-mounted system also offered. The new Control-Blade <b>independent</b> <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> (IRS) fitted to all sedans—first used in development of the Ford Focus and the Jaguar X-Type— was superior to the optional double wishbone IRS suspension used on AU sedans, and was cheaper. However, it was heavier than the previous live rear axle used for base models, and the change contributed to the base model XT sedan's [...] weight increase from the previous model. The wagons and utilities retained the leaf spring live axle rear suspension of the AU wagon and utility; consequently, they did not gain as much weight as the sedan.|$|E
500|$|The 1993 VR Commodore {{represented}} a major facelift {{of the second}} generation architecture leaving only the doors and roof untouched. Approximately 80percent of car was new {{in comparison to the}} preceding model. Exterior changes brought an overall smoother body, semicircular wheel arches and the [...] "twin-kidney" [...] grille—a Commodore styling trait which remained until the VY model of 2002 and remains a permanent staple on the HSV variants to this day. The rear-end treatment saw raised tail lights, implemented for safety reasons, and a driver's side airbag was introduced as an option: a first for an Australian-built car. Other safety features such as anti-lock brakes and <b>independent</b> <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> were only available with the new electronic GM 4L60-E automatic transmission. Along with a driver's airbag and cruise control, these features were packaged into a new Acclaim specification level: a family-oriented safety spec above the entry-level Executive. Holden's strong focus on safety {{can be seen in the}} Used Car Safety Ratings. The findings show that in an accident, VN/VP Commodores provide a [...] "worse than average" [...] level of occupant protection. However, the updated VR/VS models were found to provide a [...] "better than average" [...] level of safety protection. Holden issued a Series II revision in September 1994 bringing audible warning chimes for the handbrake and fuel level among other changes.|$|E
50|$|The W140 {{featured}} a newly developed front axle double wishbone <b>suspension</b> and a <b>rear</b> <b>independent</b> multi-link <b>suspension.</b>|$|R
50|$|IMV {{vehicles}} are either {{rear wheel drive}} or four wheel drive (4WD can be either full-time or rear-based part-time). Front suspension is <b>independent</b> double-wishbone, while <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> is half-dependent. Engines are mounted longitudinally.|$|R

2500|$|This {{generation}} was {{often referred to}} as the [...] "solid-axle" [...] models (the <b>independent</b> <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> was not introduced until the second generation). Three hundred hand-built polo white Corvette convertibles were produced for the 1953 model year.|$|E
2500|$|For the 1965 model year, the Corvair {{received}} a fully <b>independent</b> <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> closely resembling {{that of the}} contemporary Corvette. The redesigned suspension reduced the rear roll center to half its previous height, using fully articulated half-axles that offered constant camber on the rear tires in all driving situations. [...] This virtually eliminated the handling problems of the first-generation models.|$|E
2500|$|Another common {{seatstay}} variant is the wishbone, {{single seat}} stay, or mono stay, which joins the stays together {{just above the}} rear wheel into a monotube that is joined to the seat tube. [...] A wishbone design adds vertical rigidity without increasing lateral stiffness, generally an undesirable trait for bicycles with unsuspended rear wheels. [...] The wishbone design is most appropriate when used {{as part of a}} rear triangle subframe on a bicycle with <b>independent</b> <b>rear</b> <b>suspension.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Engineers for the Focus, {{including}} Richard Parry-Jones, {{developed a}} class-leading, space-saving <b>independent</b> multi-link <b>rear</b> <b>suspension,</b> marketed as Control Blade suspension, combining the packaging of a trailing arm, with {{the geometry of}} a double wishbone suspension [...] The system was developed from that used in the CDW27 Ford Mondeo estate, but with various modifications to make it simpler and cheaper to build and therefore economically viable on a mass-market vehicle.|$|R
50|$|The Rover 45 donor car did {{not have}} a {{reputation}} for being a driver's car, but in fact it was the most suitable car in the Rover range for transformation into an MG, its Honda heritage providing double wishbone front suspension and fully <b>independent</b> multi link <b>rear</b> <b>suspension.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Exeo also {{features}} the same multi link fully <b>independent</b> front and <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> as {{used on the}} Audi A4, again with light weight cast aluminium alloy front suspension arms and virtual steering axis uprights. [...] All models are equipped with ZF-supplied power steering, with some models having speed-sensitive 'servotronic' variable assistance.|$|R
