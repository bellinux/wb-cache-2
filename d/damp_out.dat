David Orrell argues that the major contributor to weather forecast error is model error, with sensitivity to initial conditions playing a relatively small role.

500|$|In a like manner, {{the lunar}} surface {{experiences}} tides of around [...] amplitude over 27days, with two components: a fixed one due to Earth, {{because they are in}} synchronous rotation, and a varying component from the Sun. The Earth-induced component arises from libration, a result of the Moon's orbital eccentricity (if the Moon's orbit were perfectly circular, there would only be solar tides). Libration also changes the angle from which the Moon is seen, allowing a total of about 59% of its surface to be seen from Earth over time. The cumulative effects of stress built up by these tidal forces produces moonquakes. Moonquakes are much less common and weaker than are earthquakes, although moon quakes can last for up to an hour—a significantly longer time than terrestrial quakes—because of the absence of water to <b>damp</b> <b>out</b> the seismic vibrations. The existence of moonquakes was an unexpected discovery from seismometers placed on the Moon by Apollo astronauts from 1969 through 1972.|$|E

The effects of automatic voltage regulators, power system stabilizers, and static synchronous compensators on transient stability of a power system are investigated.

However, the static synchronous compensator shows better damping characteristics and improves {{the stability of the}} wind integrated system.
