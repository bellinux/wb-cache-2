There are several algorithms to find shortest paths, most of them coming from graph theory. One possible algorithm finds the shortest path by implementing a breadth-first search, while another, the A* algorithm, uses a heuristic technique. The breadth-first search algorithm uses a queue to visit cells in increasing <b>distance</b> <b>order</b> from the start until the finish is reached. Each visited cell needs {{to keep track of}} its distance from the start or which adjacent cell nearer to the start caused it {{to be added to the}} queue.

30|$|It {{has been}} found that the stray field reduction, due to the {{nanopore}} presence in the magnetic thin films, induces a magnetization deflection not only in-plane but also out-of-plane (OOP) [17]. Moreover, the applied magnetic field in-plane direction can considerably modify the size of the magnetic domains exhibiting one particular perpendicular magnetization component. For a perfectly hexagonal ordered Fe antidot array, this size is either of the interpore <b>distance</b> <b>order</b> (hundreds of nm) or covering an area of many nanopores (several μm), depending if the in-plane magnetizing field is applied along the next-nearest neighbor or nearest neighbor directions, respectively [18]. Therefore, modifying the antidot pattern could lead to distinct consequences of an OOP magnetization component on the system magnetic behavior.|$|E

Here, we adopt the terminology of Wyngaard (1998) : simula-tions resolve most of the energy-containing motions on the computational mesh but models do not resolve the turbulent motion. Spatial and temporal resolu-tion of turbulent motions is of greatest importance in situations that involve strong influence of localized mi-crophysics on large scale motions.

Walsh's comments are wonderfully perceptive on the staging of Oedipus, the austere, "still life" conception envisioned initially by the composer and then also by Cocteau. Stravinsky's idea of a translation "backwards" from secular French to sacred, "monumental" Latin is discussed at length, as is the neoclassicism of the music. But it is nonetheless with the larger aesthetic issues that Walsh is primarily concerned-above all, with Stravinsky's vehement anti-individualistic stance at the time. Uncomfortable with propositions of self-expression and expressivity, the composer sought to restore <b>distance,</b> <b>order,</b> and a sense of objectivity, envisioning these as part of a removed and idealized Classical past; his stance was anti-progressive, anti-Schoenberg, anti-modernist, anti-Wagner, and so forth...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{address the problem of}} {{preserving}} mining accuracy as well as privacy in publishing sensitive time-series data. For example, people with heart disease do not want to disclose their electrocardiogram time-series, but they still allow mining of some accurate patterns from their time-series. Based on this observation, we introduce the related assumptions and requirements. We show that only randomization methods satisfy all assumptions, but even those methods do not satisfy the requirements. Thus, we discuss the randomization-based solutions that satisfy all assumptions and requirements. For this purpose, we use the noise averaging effect of piecewise aggregate approximation (PAA), which may alleviate the problem of destroying <b>distance</b> <b>orders</b> in randomly perturbed time-series. Based on the noise averaging effect, we first propose two naive solutions that use the random data perturbation in publishing time-series while exploiting the PAA distance in computing distances. There is, however, a tradeoff between these two solutions with respect to uncertainty and <b>distance</b> <b>orders.</b> We thus propose two more advanced solutions that take advantages of both naive solutions. Experimental results show that our advanced solutions are superior to the naive solutions...|$|R

Specifically, we concentrate on the issue of how to effectively use graph spectral properties to characterize point patterns in the presence of positional jitter and outliers. A novel local spectral descriptor is proposed to represent the attribute domain of feature points. For a point in a given point-set, weight graphs are constructed on its neighboring points and then their normalized Laplacian matrices are computed. According to the known spectral radius of the normalized Laplacian matrix, the distribution of the eigenvalues of these normalized Laplacian matrices is summarized as a histogram to form a descriptor. The proposed spectral descriptor is finally combined with the approximate <b>distance</b> <b>order</b> for recovering correspondences between point-sets. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and its superiority to the existing methods...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} new {{technique}} for managing visual clutter caused by overlapping labels in complex information displays. This tech-nique, “label layering”, utilizes stereoscopic disparity {{as a means to}} segregate labels in depth for increased legibility and clarity. By distributing overlapping labels in depth, we have found that selec-tion time during a visual search task in situations with high levels of overlap is reduced by four seconds or 24 %. Our data show that the depth order of the labels must be correlated with the <b>distance</b> <b>order</b> of their corresponding objects. Since a random distribution of stereoscopic disparity in contrast impairs performance, the ben-efit is not solely due to the disparity-based image segregation. An algorithm using our label layering technique accordingly could be an alternative to traditional label placement algorithms that avoid label overlap at the cost of distracting motion, symbology dimming or label size reduction...|$|E
40|$|Finding correspondences {{between two}} related feature point sets {{is a basic}} task in {{computer}} vision and pattern recognition. In this paper, we present a novel method for point pattern matching via spectral graph analysis. In particular, we aim to render the spectral matching algorithm more robust for positional jitter and outlier. A local structural descriptor, namely the spectral context, is proposed to describe the attribute domain of point sets, which is fundamentally different from the previous methods. Furthermore, the approximate <b>distance</b> <b>order</b> is defined and employed as the metric for geometric consistency of neighboring points in this work. By combining these two novel ingredients, we formulate feature point set matching as an optimization problem with one-to-one constraints. The correspondences are then obtained by maximizing the given objective function via the technique of probabilistic relaxation. Comparative experiments conducted on both synthetic and real data demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed method, especially in the presence of positional jitter and outliers...|$|E

In its basic formulation, the PP-Index is strongly biased toward efficiency, treating effectiveness as a secondary aspect. We show how the effectiveness can easily reach optimal levels just by adopting two "boosting" strategies: multiple index search and multiple query search. Such strategies have nice parallelization properties that allow to distribute the search process in order to keep high efficiency levels. We study both the efficiency and the effectiveness properties of the PP-Index.

Results: Twenty-seven participants were examined (aged 20. 4 ± 1. 05 years). Base up and base down measurements were similar, therefore measurements were combined to give a total vertical range. Median values for the break points were: 33 cm, 6 (Δ); 1 m, 6 (Δ); 4 m, 5. 5 (Δ); 6 m, 5. 5 (Δ); and for the recovery points were: 33 cm, 4 (Δ); 1 m, 4 (Δ); 4 m, 3. 5 (Δ); 6 m, 3. 5 (Δ). The difference was significant between either of the near measures (i. e. 33 cm and 1 m) and either of the far measures (i. e. 4 m and 6 m).

Despite its potential, the poor reliability and yield, thermal management and testing issues remain major challenges of 3 D integration. We address the TSVinterconnect test challenge of 3 D chips by using Interconnect Built-In Self-Test (IBIST) techniques. The proposed test strategy must sensitize structural faults like opens and shorts, and delay faults due to crosstalk. A possible approach is the well-known Maximum Aggressor Fault (MAF) model. Unfortunately, this model is too conservative and it leads to long test sequences and nonnegligible hardware costs. Therefore, we present an alternative solution: the Kth-Aggressor Fault (KAF) model. In our model, aggressors of victim wires are neighboring wires within an optimized <b>distance</b> <b>order</b> K. The aggressor order K is technology-dependent and is determined such that the test times are minimal and the fault coverage is maximal. KAFbased IBIST implementation targeting TSV tests occupies three times less area than similar MAF-/marching-based implementations. We also propose a reconfigurable KAFbased IBIST implementation where tests can be performed using different aggressor orders K. Although the reconfigurable IBIST area is significant, interconnect tests during system lifetime can be performed using lower aggressor orders, reducing test duration and improving TSVavailability...|$|E
