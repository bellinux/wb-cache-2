40|$|Abstract: This paper {{describes}} a computer-based thermodynamic model that evaluates {{the performance of}} hydrocarbon (HC) mixtures as alternative refrigerants to conventional synthetic refrigerants. By estimating the refrigeration effect, compressor work, and coefficient of performance, the analytical tool helps to optimize the system’s design to suit a particular HC mixture or to identify the best HC mixture {{to be used as}} a <b>drop-in</b> <b>refrigerant</b> for an existing conventional system. The model is validated against experimental data that compared the performance of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) to that of refrigerant R 12 for domestic refrigeration. The results obtained show that the model correctly predicts the differences observed in the experiment. In agreement with the experimental data, the model's estimates show an improved performance for LPG compared to R 12...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} {{presented}} in this paper is an experimental investigation of the oil return characteristics of alternative refrigerants for residential air conditioning systems using R 22. Due to the phase-out of HCFC refrigerants, the production of R 22 will be stopped by the year 2020. In some cases of vapor compression systems installed in the field, {{it will be necessary to}} replace the R 22 with alternative drop-in refrigerants as a part of maintenance procedures. Since R 22 system typically use mineral oils and HFC replacement refrigerants use POE or PAG oils. It may be necessary to change the type of oil used inside the system when retrofitting an existing R 22 system with an alternative <b>drop-in</b> <b>refrigerant.</b> Changing the oil in a vapor compression system is an expensive proposition due to the required flushing and cleaning of the system before the new oil can be installed. Therefore, refrigerant manufacturers are searching for alternative refrigerants, which are compatible with mineral oils and have similar working performance and conditions as R 22. The measurement of the oil return in the suction line helps to draw conclusions about the ability of the oil circulating back to the compressor. In this study, a unitary spilt-system air conditioner with a cooling capacity of 7 kW was equipped with an oil separator and oil measuring cylinder in the suction line. The experimental test setup was designed and built to measure the mass of oil returned to the compressor. Â The weight of the oil collected in the suction line using three different compositions of the alternative <b>drop-in</b> <b>refrigerant</b> R 438 are compared to the mass of oil returned when using R 22...|$|E

40|$|The world {{community}} {{has committed to}} eliminate the HCFC- 22 refrigerant {{to a series of}} deadlines according to the agreements taken during the 19 th Montreal Protocol meeting in September 2007. This phase-out, which is already in progress in European Countries, has been accelerated in Article 5 countries. Refrigerant manufactures offer different <b>drop-in</b> <b>refrigerants</b> to replace R 22 in existing equipment by non-ozone depleting substances {{in order to be able}} to make full use of the remaining life of the plants or different retrofit refrigerants, the use of which implies modifications to the existing systems. This work aims to contribute to the understanding of the implications of the process of R 22 substitution, either with drop-in or retrofitting processes, by presenting a theoretical and experimental analysis of the performance of R 22, of two drop-in fluids (R 422 A, R 417 B) and a retrofit refrigerant (R 404 A), in a two-stage vapour compression plant over a wide range of evaporating temperatures for a fixed condensing temperature of 40 °C.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental {{study on the}} replacement of CFC 12 and HFC 134 a by the new R 290 /R 600 a <b>refrigerant</b> mixture as <b>drop-in</b> replacement <b>refrigerant</b> with and without the effect of magnetic field. Without any modification to the system components drop-in experimental tests were performed on a vapour compression refrigeration system with a reciprocating compressor, which was originally designed to operate with CFC 12. The test results with no magnets showed that the refrigerant R 290 /R 600 a had 19. 9 - 50. 1 % higher refrigerating capacity than R 12 and 28. 6 - 87. 2 % than R 134 a. The mixture R 290 /R 600 a consumed 6. 8 - - 17. 4 % more energy than R 12. The coefficient of performance of R 290 /R 600 a mixture increases from 3. 9 - 25. 1 % than R 12 at lower evaporating temperatures and 11. 8 - 17. 6 % at higher evaporating temperatures. The effect of magnetic field force reduced the compressor energy consumption by 1. 5 - 2. 5 % than with no magnets. The coefficient of performance of the system was higher in the range 1. 5 - 2. 4 % with the effect of magnetic field force. The R 290 / 600 a (68 / 32 by wt. %) mixture {{can be considered as}} an excellent alternative refrigerant for CFC 12 and HFC 134 a systems...|$|R

Adding 10 % of HFC 134 a to HFO 1234 yf, the mixture becomes non-flammable with GWP still less than 150. The experimental tests {{have been conducted}} under sub-tropical conditions {{in accordance with the}} UNI-EN-ISO 15502 standard. Two kinds of tests have been shown: pull down and 1 -day energy consumption. The results show that HFC 134 a/HFO 1234 yf (10 / 90 % weight) is the best <b>drop-in</b> <b>refrigerant</b> fluid for HFC 134 a in the domestic refrigerator used for the experimental tests. The refrigerant mixture has the closest behaviour to that of HFC 134 a in terms of temperatures and pressures.

40|$|This work {{focuses on}} the {{investigation}} of new <b>drop-in</b> or long-term <b>refrigerants</b> for low evaporating temperatures {{that can be used}} as substitutes for HCFC- 22, which is gradually being phased-out. This process is already in progress in European countries (Regulation CE- 1005 / 2009) and has been accelerated in Article 5 Countries of the Montreal Protocol. Specifically, in this work the energy influence of the suction line/liquid line heat exchanger on the new substitute fluids is addressed from an experimental approach. The study has been based on experimental measurements in a single-stage vapour compression refrigeration plant, which has been tested in the same external conditions operating with and without an Internal Heat Exchanger (IHX). The energy influence of the IHX working with R 22 and three potential substitutes for low temperature applications, the chlorine-free drop-in fluids R 417 B and R 422 A and the chlorine-free long-term substitute R 404 A has been analysed. From the experimental results, reductions in capacity and COP have been observed when R 22 is replaced by the drop-in fluids, although the presence of an IHX can help to lessen these reductions. Furthermore, the criteria that are usually employed to determine the energy advantage or disadvantage of the use of the IHX with the new refrigerants have been tested, the results confirming that they remain valid for them...|$|R

40|$|Fluids at high {{temperature}} and pressure are commonplace across engineering applications. These fluids are sometimes {{the product of}} a harsh environment, as in subsurface operations such as oil and gas development or geothermal energy production, or at other times, exploited for their desirable transport and thermodynamic properties in, for example, chemical extractions and material synthesis. At these elevated conditions, many single and multi-component fluids exist in a supercritical state, where small changes in temperature and pressure cause significant property variations without induction of a phase change. A fluid’s isobaric heat capacity (Cp), a property important to most thermal processes, fluctuates strongly in the supercritical region, ranging from a few times the ideal gas state Cp to infinity exactly at the critical point for pure fluids. Accurately capturing the thermophysical behavior of supercritical pure fluids and mixtures is necessary for optimal design and efficient operation of numerous engineering processes that utilize these substances. The main goal of this research was to increase understanding of isobaric heat capacity property changes in supercritical fluids. The first step in a threefold approach was to design and construct a calorimeter for precise and accurate measurements of Cp in the supercritical region. Second was to carry out experimental Cp measurements for pure fluids and representative fluid mixtures in pressure-temperature-composition regions with only limited available data. Systems studied included: CO 2 -methanol, common in supercritical fluid extraction and chemical processing; CO 2 -decane, relevant to tertiary recovery in oil and gas applications; and R 1234 yf, a low-global-warming-potential <b>drop-in</b> replacement <b>refrigerant</b> for R 134 a which is currently used in heat pumps and power cycles. And finally, the third step was to use equations of state and molecular simulations to extend Cp data and predict behavior in the supercritical region. A flow calorimeter was built to operate over a wide range of temperatures (20 - 150 °C), pressures (1 - 300 bar), and densities (1 - 1000 kg/m 3). By precisely placing both the measurement devices and the heating element in direct contact with the fluid, and by limiting experimental heat losses through vacuum insulation and immersion of the entire apparatus in a fluidized thermal bath, the calorimeter achieved ± 1 % accurate measurements of Cp. To further our ability to model mixtures at supercritical conditions, measurements of CO 2 -methanol were compared to Monte Carlo molecular simulation predictions of Cp. The average absolute deviation, when compared to experiment, of the simulation results is comparable with the current state-of-the-art equation of state (4 % versus 3 %, respectively). However, the molecular simulations were significantly less correct predicting Cp in the near critical region where Cp was most sensitive to small changes in temperature and pressure. This region of greatest sensitivity, called the “heat capacity ridge,” was mapped onto temperature-pressure-composition coordinates for CO 2 -methanol and CO 2 -decane using experimental measurements. For single component fluids and binary mixtures, the subtle difference in the relationship between a fluid’s heat capacity ridge and its critical point was demonstrated. 2018 - 06 - 0...|$|R
