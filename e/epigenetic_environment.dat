40|$|Gene {{transcription}} is {{a fundamental}} and important step for cellular function, biological process and pathogenesis. The diversified temporal and spatial patterns of gene expression are complicated {{and how they are}} controlled remains not completely understood. Therefore, the regulation mechanism behind transcription is gaining increasing interest and focus. The process of transcription is controlled by multiple factors in a sophisticated system, including functional DNA sequences, DNA binding proteins and chromosome conformation. In this study, bioinformatics methods are employed to explore the characteristics and patterns of cis-regulatory elements, trans-acting factors and the interactions among them in specific <b>epigenetic</b> <b>environment,</b> all involved in the gene expression regulation mechanism. Cis-regulatory elements include promoters and other distant ones, such as enhancers. In this study promoters are categorized based on transcript type, transcription direction or genes’ tissue specificity, and compared based on their genetic and epigenetic features. It is found the intrinsic features of promoter sequence, including CpG island frequency, general transcription factor binding motifs and sequence conservation, are more correlated with transcript type and transcription direction, while the tissue specific gene expression pattern is more affected by the trans-acting proteins and <b>epigenetic</b> <b>environment,</b> including DNA methylation and histone modification. For enhancers, the focus in this study is on their detection, data curation and target gene finding. Detection methods to date are reviewed and validated human enhancers are recorded. Furthermore, with available long-range chromatin interaction data, distant enhancer targets are inferred. Finally a database named EATdb is presented for users to search enhancers and enhancer targets. Trans-acting factors function cooperatively with cis-regulatory elements, and they are indispensable components of the regulatory network. In this study, Hi-C data are analyzed to understand how trans-acting factors assist in forming chromosome conformation and the long-range regulation system. The study combining transcription factor binding peaks and long-range chromatin interaction data discloses that some tissue specific transcription factors are crucial to the chromosome conformation. All interactions among cis-regulatory elements and trans-acting factors occur in specific <b>epigenetic</b> <b>environment,</b> so various histone modifications’ patterns in promoter regions, chromatin interactions and the whole genome are examined and compared in different cells. The knowledge that histone modifications could increase or decrease gene expression is confirmed and some novel observations are reported. On the basis of this knowledge a web server named EpiRegNet is built for public use on detecting important histone modifications affecting the expression of a given set of genes. In general, this study consists of several aspects of the research on gene expression regulation and discovers several findings concerning the regulation mechanism. Cis-regulatory elements and trans-acting factors are first studied independently to understand their roles in affecting gene expression, and then analyzed together in an integrated system to explore the regulation mechanism. Meanwhile, epigenetic factors are taken into consideration through all parts of the study. In conclusion, this study provides a comprehensive view of the gene expression regulation mechanism and is hopefully useful for similar research. published_or_final_versionBiochemistryDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E
40|$|This {{work was}} {{supported}} by grant BBSRC BB/I 1022899 / 1 ‘The diversity and evolution of the gene component of the barley pericentromeric heterochromatin’. Combinations of histones carrying different covalent modifications are {{a major component of}} epigenetic variation. We have mapped nine modified histones in the barley seedling epigenome by chromatin immunoprecipitation next-generation sequencing (ChIP-seq). The chromosomal distributions of the modifications group them into four different classes, and members of a given class also tend to coincide at the local DNA level, suggesting that global distribution patterns reflect local <b>epigenetic</b> <b>environments.</b> We used this peak sharing to define 10 chromatin states representing local <b>epigenetic</b> <b>environments</b> in the barley genome. Five states map mainly to genes and five to intergenic regions. Two genic states involving H 3 K 36 me 3 are preferentially associated with constitutive gene expression, while an H 3 K 27 me 3 -containing genic state is associated with differentially expressed genes. The 10 states display striking distribution patterns that divide barley chromosomes into three distinct global environments. First, telomere-proximal regions contain high densities of H 3 K 27 me 3 covering both genes and intergenic DNA, together with very low levels of the repressive H 3 K 27 me 1 modification. Flanking these are gene-rich interior regions that are rich in active chromatin states and have greatly decreased levels of H 3 K 27 me 3 and increasing amounts of H 3 K 27 me 1 and H 3 K 9 me 2. Lastly, H 3 K 27 me 3 -depleted pericentromeric regions contain gene islands with active chromatin states separated by extensive retrotransposon-rich regions that are associated with abundant H 3 K 27 me 1 and H 3 K 9 me 2 modifications. We propose an epigenomic framework for barley whereby intergenic H 3 K 27 me 3 specifies facultative heterochromatin in the telomere-proximal regions and H 3 K 27 me 1 is diagnostic for constitutive heterochromatin elsewhere in the barley genome.

30|$|Immediately {{flanking}} CENP-A-bound centromeric core is the peri-centromeric heterochromatin. This condensed and transcriptionally silent {{region is}} essential for gene regulation, genome stability and chromosome segregation. Peri-centromeric heterochromatin displays a protein binding profile and <b>epigenetic</b> <b>environment</b> that is clearly {{different from that of}} centromeric cores. The heterochromatic region is enriched in histone 3 lysine 9 (H 3 K 9) methylation and devoid of H 3 K 4 methylation. In fact, H 3 K 9 methylation is considered an epigenetic hallmark of heterochromatin, conserved from fission yeast to humans (Fig.  1) (Rice and Allis, 2001; Carroll and Straight, 2006). This modification serves as the binding site for the highly conserved chromodomain protein, heterochromatin protein 1 (HP 1). HP 1 is a classic epigenetic “reader” protein, which can recognize specific epigenetic marks (Rice and Allis, 2001; Taverna et al., 2007). Histones in heterochromatin are also hypo-acetylated. This contrasts with active chromatin (euchromatin) in which H 3 K 4 methylation and hyper-acetylation are enriched (Rice and Allis, 2001).|$|E

40|$|The Retinoblastoma tumor {{suppressor}} gene (RB) {{plays a role in}} a variety of human cancers. Experimental analyses have indicated that the protein product of the RB gene (pRb) plays a role in cell cycle regulation, and that this protein is required in cellular differentiation, senescence, and cell survival. pRb function is dependent on its ability to bind to cellular factors. There are multiple protein binding domains within pRb. Mutations within these domains which eliminate the ability of pRb to bind its targets result in loss of function. Loss of pRb function leads to tumorigenesis, although uncontrolled cellular proliferation is not a universal response to pRb inactivation. The ultimate response to the loss of pRb is influenced by both the genetic and <b>epigenetic</b> <b>environments.</b> Targeted disruption of RB in mice results in embryonic lethality, demonstrating the requirement for functional pRb in development. Close examination of various tissues from the embryos which lack wildtype RB shows problems in differentiation as well as showing induction of apoptosis. Although disruption of RB has provided useful information, complete inactivation of a gene precludes the possibility of discovering the functions that separate domains may have within the system. Creation of a dominant negative mutant by domain deletion whose phenotype is expressed {{in the presence of the}} wildtype may provide information about the intermediate functions of the protein. In addition, tissue specific targeting of a dominant negative mutant of pRb allows for comprehensive analysis of pRb function in organogenesis. In this thesis, a series of RB deletion mutants were created and tested for dominant negative activity as well as cellular localization. A tissue culture assay for dominant negative activity was developed which screens for the phenotype of apoptosis due to loss of pRb function. Two mutants from this series scored positive for dominant negative activity in this assay. The effect of these mutants within the assay environment can be explained by a model in which pRb acts as a facilitator of cell fate pathway decisions. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: Enhancers, not promoters, are {{the most}} dynamic in their DNA {{methylation}} status throughout development and differentiation. Generally speaking, enhancers that are primed to or actually drive gene expression are characterized by relatively low levels of DNA methylation (hypo-methylation), while inactive enhancers display hyper-methylation of the underlying DNA. The direct functional significance of the DNA methylation state of enhancers is, however, unclear for most loci. Results: In contrast to conventional epigenetic interactions at enhancers, we find that DNA methylation status and enhancer activity during early zebrafish development display very unusual correlation characteristics: hypo-methylation is a unique feature of primed enhancers whereas active enhancers are generally hyper-methylated. The hypo-methylated enhancers that we identify (hypo-enhancers) are enriched close to important transcription factors that act later in development. Interestingly, hypo-enhancers are de-methylated shortly before the midblastula transition and reside in a unique <b>epigenetic</b> <b>environment.</b> Finally, we demonstrate that hypo-enhancers do become active at later developmental stages {{and that they are}} physically associated with the transcriptional start site of target genes, irrespective of target gene activity.

Too many {{reactive oxygen species}}, called oxidative stress, result in cellular damage causing either cell death (aging) or malignant cellular transformations (carcinogenesis). Although too many reactive oxygen species are detrimental, a lower dose seems beneficial for health. We know that, but not how, epigenetic changes are induced by free radicals. Therefore, this thesis describes the relationship between oxidative stress, epigenetics and cancer.

In vitro, Zta binding is modulated by DNA methylation; {{a subset of}} CpG-containing Zta-binding sites (CpG ZREs) is bound only in a DNA methylation-dependent manner. The {{question of how the}} dynamic <b>epigenetic</b> <b>environment</b> impacts upon Zta interaction during EBV lytic cycle is unknown. To address this, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with next-generation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) to identify Zta binding sites across the EBV genome before and after viral DNA replication. Replication did not alter the association of Zta across many regions of the EBV genome but a striking reduction in Zta binding occurred at some loci that contain CpG ZREs. Separating Zta-bound DNA into methylated and non-methylated fractions, we found that promoters that contain CpG ZREs were enriched in the methylated fraction but Zta binding to promoters lacking CpG ZREs was not. We hypothesise that the loss of DNA methylation on the EBV genome during lytic cycle causes the reduced binding to CpG ZREs; this may act as a lytic cycle epigenetic switch. However, the epigenetic changes associated with the replicated EBV genome do not affect the interaction of Zta with many loci that are rich in non-CpG ZREs; this leads to sustained binding at these regions...|$|E
40|$|Mammalian genomes have {{expanded}} through the duplication of large blocks of DNA and retrotransposition of different cellular RNAs. Roughly 35 % {{of the human}} genome can be attributed to retrotransposed sequences. In humans, three retrotransposon families are still active: the autonomous LINE- 1 (L 1), and the non-autonomous Alu, and SINE-VNTR-Alu (SVA) elements. However, most copies of L 1, Alu, and SVA are no longer active, with new genomic insertions being derived from a small subset of elements. L 1 encodes a reverse transcriptase activity in its second ORF (ORF 2) required for its own mobilization in cis and the mobilization of Alu and SVA RNAs in trans. These elements may impact host genomes as insertional mutagens or through other mechanisms not dependent upon them actively retrotransposing, such as altering the local <b>epigenetic</b> <b>environment</b> or alternative splicing. ^ Here we carried out molecular and computational experiments and found a number of functional 3 ’ splice sites within many different transcribed SVAs across the human and chimpanzee genomes. Using a mini-gene splicing construct containing an SVA, we observed splicing in cell culture, up to 20 % of wild-type levels, along with SVA exonization events that introduced premature termination codons (PTC). These data imply that an SVA residing within an intron in the same orientation as the gene may alter normal gene transcription either by gene-trapping or by introducing PTCs through exonization, possibly creating differences within and across species. ^ Cell culture retrotransposition assays have provided great insight into the genomic impact of retrotransposons, in particular, LINE- 1 (L 1) and Alu elements; however, no such assay exists for SVA elements. Here we report the development of an SVA cell culture retrotransposition assay and demonstrate L 1 mobilization of SVA elements in trans. Engineered SVAs retrotranspose at 1 - 54 times the frequency of a marked non-L 1 pseudogene in HeLa HA cells.

This topic has been controversial, as many epigenetic states of the X chromosome have been proposed to exist in female human pluripotent stem cells; however, none of the described states captures the {{state of the}} X chromosome in the human embryo. To investigate the basis for this disconnect between human pluripotent stem cells and human development, we used single cell resolution techniques in conjunction with mapping of DNA methylation and global transcription to examine the epigenome and transcriptome of pre-implantation embryos, cells during derivation, and in established hESCs. We demonstrate that X chromosome inactivation (XCI) initiates early during derivation of female hESCs, and unlike mouse development, progresses from a naï¿½ve state where XIST is expressed on two active chromosomes to a state where XIST is expressed on one inactive X chromosome. Therefore, the majority of established female hESCs display a pattern resembling the mouse post-implantation embryo, with one X chromosome silenced, which is associated with the spreading and coating of the non-coding RNA (ncRNA) XIST. However, this pattern erodes during progressive culture of female hESCs, with Xist RNA loss and subsequent partial activation of genes on the Xi, to an extent that is unpredictable. We also find that de novo XCI can be stochastically disrupted during hESC derivation, leading to a state where XIST is permanently silenced thus that XCI cannot occur in vitro. Accordingly some established female hESC lines carry two active X chromosomes in the self- renewing state, but, unlike the prevailing model suggests, do not undergo X chromosome inactivation (XCI) nor undergo dosage compensation upon induction of differentiation. Finally, we find that no existing method is capable of reproducing the <b>epigenetic</b> <b>environment</b> of the pre-implantation embryo in established human pluripotent stem cell lines, and conclude that a female human pluripotent stem cell that is competent to undergo XCI has not been attained.

Modifications to the DNA and chromatin organisation which do not alter the DNA sequence can control gene expression patterns through changing the accessibility of specific genes to the transcriptional machinery.

Altered nutrient availability has been shown to influence the establishment of DNA methylation in the developing embryo and fetus, leading to inappropriate gene expression, and associated changes in physiological parameters. Changes in DNA methylation dynamics are also being identified as a likely mechanism for transmitting the programmed phenotype to future generations...|$|R
50|$|Obesity {{medicine}} {{is a field}} of medicine dedicated to the comprehensive treatment of patients with obesity. Obesity medicine {{takes into account the}} multi-factorial etiology of obesity in which behavior, development, <b>environment,</b> <b>epigenetic,</b> genetic, nutrition, physiology, and psychosocial contributors all play a role. As time progresses, we become more knowledgeable about the complexity of obesity, and we have ascertained that there is a certain skill set and knowledge base that is required to treat this patient population. Clinicians in the field should understand how a myriad of factors contribute to obesity including: gut microbiota diversity, regulation of food intake and energy balance through enteroendocrine and neuroregulation, and adipokine physiology. Obesity medicine physicians should be skilled in identifying factors which have contributed to obesity and know how to employ methods (behavior modification, pharmacotherapy, and surgery) to treat obesity. No two people with obesity are alike, and it is important to approach each patient as an individual to determine which factors contributed to their obesity in order to effectively treat each patient.|$|R
40|$|The petrological, geochemical, and mineralogical {{composition}} of the Carboniferous-Permian coal deposit in the Jungar coalfield of inner Mongolia, Northwestern China, were investigated using optical microscopy and field emission scanning electron microscopy in conjunction with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (SEM-EDX), as well as X-ray powder diffraction, X-ray fluorescence, and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The Jungar coal is of high volatile C/B bituminous quality with 0. 58 % vitrinite reflectance and has a low sulfur content of 0. 70 % on average. Inertinite (mineral-free basis) generally dominates in coal from {{the lower part of}} the Shanxi formation, and vitrinite is the major maceral assemblage in the coal from the Taiyuan formation, which exhibits forms suggesting variation in the sedimentary environment. The Jungar coal is characterized by higher concentrations of copper (Cu) in No. 6 coal, at 55 μg/g, and lead (Pb) in No. 4 coal at 42 μg/g. Relative to the upper continental crust, the rare earth elements (REE) in the coal are characterized by light and medium–heavy REE enrichment. The minerals in the Jungar coal are mainly kaolinite, dickite, pyrite, calcite, siderite, quartz, and, to a lesser extent, gypsum and K-feldspar. The enrichment and occurrence of the trace elements, and of the minerals in the coal, are attributed to the fragmental parent rock during diagenesis and coalification. The main elements with high enrichment factors, Cu and Pb, overall exhibit a notably inorganic sulfide affinity and a weak organic affinity. Primary and <b>epigenetic</b> sedimentary <b>environment</b> and the lithology of the terrigenous parent rock are the key factors that influence the occurrence and formation of Cu and Pb in coal. The depositional environment is more influential in the formation of Cu than Pb in coal. Lead is more easily affected by the terrigenous factors than Cu when they are under a similar depositional environment...|$|R

Its etiology {{is unique and}} multifactorial, involving genetic background, <b>epigenetic,</b> and <b>environment</b> factors, including Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) infection. The presence of EBV in all tumor cells, aberrant pattern of antibodies against EBV antigens in patient sera, and elevated viral DNA in patient circulation as well as nasopharyngeal site underline the role of EBV during NPC development. In NPC tumors, EBV expresses latency type II, where three EBV-encoded proteins, Epstein–Barr nuclear antigen 1, latent membrane protein 1 and 2 (LMP 1, 2), are expressed along with BamH 1 -A rightward reading frame 1, Epstein–Barr virus-encoded small nuclear RNAs, and BamH 1 -A rightward transcripts. Among all encoded proteins, LMP 1 plays {{a central role in}} the propagation of NPC. Standard treatment of NPC consists of radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy for early stage, concurrent chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced tumors, and palliative systemic chemotherapy in metastatic disease. However, this standard care has limitations, allowing recurrences and disease progression in a certain proportion of cases. Although the pathophysiological link and molecular process of EBV-induced oncogenesis are not fully understood, therapeutic approaches targeting the virus may increase the cure rate and add clinical benefit. The promising results of early phase clinical trials on EBV-specific immunotherapy, epigenetic therapy, and treatment with viral lytic induction offer new options for treating NPC.

40|$|Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) {{infection}} {{can result}} in severe disease partially due to its ability {{to interfere with the}} initiation of Th 1 responses targeting the production of type I inter-ferons (IFN) and promoting a Th 2 immune <b>environment.</b> <b>Epigenetic</b> modulation of gene transcription {{has been shown to be}} important in regulating inflammatory pathways. RSV-infected bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs) upregulated expression of Kdm 5 b/Jarid 1 b H 3 K 4 demethylase. Kdm 5 b-specific siRNA inhibition in BMDC led to a 10 -fold increase in IFN-β as well as increases in IL- 6 and TNF-α compared to control-transfected cells. The generation of Kdm 5 bfl/fl-CD 11 c-Cre+ mice recapitulated the latter results during in vitro DC activation showing innate cytokine modulation. In vivo, infection of Kdm 5 bfl/fl-CD 11 c-Cre+ mice with RSV resulted in higher production of IFN-γ and reduced IL- 4 and IL- 5 compared to littermate controls, with significantly decreased inflammation, IL- 13, and mucus produc-tion in the lungs. Sensitization with RSV-infected DCs into the airways of naïve mice led to an exacerbated response when mice were challenged with live RSV infection. When Kdm 5 b was blocked in DCs with siRNA or DCs from Kdm 5 bfl/fl-CD 11 c-CRE mice wer...|$|R
40|$|Personality {{traits are}} {{heritable}} {{and respond to}} natural selection, but are {{at the same time}} influenced by the ontogenetic <b>environment.</b> <b>Epigenetic</b> effects, such as DNA methylation, have been proposed as a key mechanism to control personality variation. However, to date {{little is known about the}} contribution of epigenetic effects to natural variation in behaviour. Here, we show that great tit (Parus major) lines artificially selected for divergent exploratory behaviour for four generations differ in their DNA methylation levels at the dopamine receptor D 4 (DRD 4) gene. This D 4 receptor is statistically associated with personality traits in both humans and nonhuman animals, including the great tit. Previous work in this songbird failed to detect functional genetic polymorphisms within DRD 4 that could account for the gene-trait association. However, our observation supports the idea that DRD 4 is functionally involved in exploratory behaviour but that its effects are mediated by DNA methylation. While the exact mechanism underlying the transgenerational consistency of DRD 4 methylation remains to be elucidated, this study shows that epigenetic mechanisms are involved in shaping natural variation in personality traits. We outline how this first finding provides a basis for investigating the epigenetic contribution to personality traits in natural systems and its subsequent role for understanding the ecology and evolution of behavioural consistency. </p...|$|R
40|$|As {{opposed to}} genetics, dealing with gene {{expressions}} by direct DNA sequence modifications, the term epigenetics {{applies to all}} the external influences that target the chromatin structure of cells with impact on gene expression unrelated to the sequence coding of DNA itself. In normal cells, epigenetics modulates gene expression through all development steps. When “imprinted” early by the <b>environment,</b> <b>epigenetic</b> changes influence the organism {{at an early stage}} and can be transmitted to the progeny. Together with DNA sequence alterations, DNA aberrant cytosine methylation and microRNA deregulation, epigenetic modifications participate in the malignant transformation of cells. Their reversible nature has led to the emergence of the promising field of epigenetic therapy. The efforts made to inhibit in particular the epigenetic enzyme family called histone deacetylases (HDACs) are described. HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) have been proposed as a viable clinical therapeutic approach for the treatment of leukemia and solid tumors, but also to a lesser degree for noncancerous diseases. Three epigenetic drugs are already arriving at the patient’s bedside, and more than 100 clinical assays for HDACi are registered on the National Cancer Institute website. They explore the eventual additive benefits of combined therapies. In the context of the pleiotropic effects of HDAC isoforms, more specific HDACi and more informative screening tests are being developed {{for the benefit of the}} patients...|$|R
40|$|Background: DNA {{methylation}} and histone 3 lysine 9 (H 3 K 9) methylation {{are considered}} as epigenetic marks {{that can be}} inherited through cell divisions. To explore the functional consequences and stability of these modifications, we employed targeted installment of DNA methylation and H 3 K 9 methylation in the vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) promoter using catalytic domains of DNA or H 3 K 9 methyltransferases that are fused to a zinc finger protein which binds a site in the VEGF-A promoter. Results: Expression of the targeted DNA and H 3 K 9 methyltransferases caused dense deposition of DNA methylation or H 3 K 9 di- and trimethylation in the promoter of VEGF-A and downregulation of VEGF-A gene expression. We did not observe positive feedback between DNA methylation and H 3 K 9 methylation. Upon loss of the targeted methyltransferases from the cells, the <b>epigenetic</b> marks, chromatin <b>environment,</b> and gene expression Levels returned to their original state, indicating that both methylation marks were not stably propagated after their installment. Conclusions: The clear anti-correlation between DNA or H 3 K 9 methylation and gene expression suggests a direct role of these marks in transcriptional control. The lack of maintenance of the transiently induced silenced chromatin state suggests that the stability of epigenetic signaling {{is based on an}} epigenetic network consisting of several molecular marks. Therefore, for stable reprogramming, either multivalent deposition of functionally related epigenetic marks or longer-lasting trigger stimuli might be necessary...|$|R
40|$|Background: Interindividual {{epigenetic}} variation that occurs systemically {{must be established}} prior to gastrulation {{in the very early}} embryo and, because it is systemic, can be assessed in easily biopsiable tissues. We employ two independent genome-wide approaches to search for such variants. Results: First, we screen for metastable epialleles by performing genomewide bisulfite sequencing in peripheral blood lymphocyte (PBL) and hair follicle DNA from two Caucasian adults. Second, we conduct a genomewide screen for genomic regions at which PBL DNA methylation is affected by season of conception in rural Gambia. Remarkably, both approaches identify the genomically imprinted VTRNA 2 - 1 as a top environmentally responsive epiallele. We demonstrate systemic and stochastic interindividual variation in DNA methylation at the VTRNA 2 - 1 differentially methylated region in healthy Caucasian and Asian adults and show, in rural Gambians, that periconceptional environment affects offspring VTRNA 2 - 1 epigenotype, which is stable over at least 10 years. This unbiased screen also identifies over 100 additional candidate metastable epialleles, and shows that these are associated with cis genomic features including transposable elements. Conclusions: The non-coding VTRNA 2 - 1 transcript (also called nc 886) is a putative tumor suppressor and modulator of innate immunity. Thus, these data indicating environmentally induced loss of imprinting at VTRNA 2 - 1 constitute a plausible causal pathway linking early embryonic <b>environment,</b> <b>epigenetic</b> alteration, and human disease. More broadly, the list of candidate metastable epialleles provides a resource for future studies of {{epigenetic variation}} and human disease...|$|R
