In the seventeenth century, John Parkinson provided an account of twelve species of what he referred to as Fritillaria - the checkered daffodil, in his Paradisus (1635), correctly placing it as closest to the lilies. He provides his version of Capperon's discovery, and suggests that some feel he should be honoured with the name Narcissus Caparonium.|$|E

500|$|Some media sources {{proposed}} that the dress {{could be interpreted as}} anti-vegan. Vegetarian singer Morrissey stated that he felt the dress was acceptable {{as long as it was}} a social or political statement, and not just a [...] "loony idea", pointing out that artist Linder Sterling had previously worn a meat dress in 1982 to protest against what she believed to be the perception of women by men. Ellen DeGeneres presented Gaga with a bikini made of vegetables when the singer appeared on her talk show, and the singer used the platform to respond to the controversy surrounding the dress saying, [...] "... it has many interpretations. For me this evening, if we don't stand up <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> believe in and if we don't fight for our rights pretty soon, we're going to have as much rights as the meat on our own bones.

500|$|Following {{the success}} of the band's {{previous}} albums Almost There and Spoken For, MercyMe was given [...] "significantly" [...] more resources to develop their next record by their record label, INO Records. Although they decided not to alter their Christian approach to songwriting, live performances, and interviews, they opted to work with outside songwriters on the album, employed the London Symphony Orchestra to play strings on several tracks, and added a sixth member to the band, guitarist Barry Graul. Additionally, MercyMe wrote and recorded the music for Undone before they wrote any of the lyrics. Lead singer Bart Millard noted that by using this method, instead of his lyrics swaying the musical elements of the song, the music acted as [...] "a canvas with which to write [...] ". He elaborated that [...] "We’ve been making records for 10 years, so anything that sparks creativity... is very much welcomed". The title of the album was inspired by [...] "the unexpected twists and turns in the band's journey"; Millard commented that [...] "We had our plans <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> were going to do; but when the bigger picture happened, all of our plans came unraveled. We don’t know what tomorrow will hold. When you make your own plans, you suddenly find yourself undone; and that’s exactly where God wants us in the first place".|$|E

Gaga wore the meat dress to accept her Video of the Year trophy for [...] "Bad Romance"; as she accepted the award from presenter Cher, she joked, [...] "I never thought I'd be asking Cher to hold my meat purse." [...] Gaga continued to wear the dress after the awards show for press photos and an interview on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. Gaga explained her interpretation of the dress to DeGeneres, stating, [...] "If we don’t stand up <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> believe in and if we don’t fight for our rights pretty soon we’re going {{to have as much}} rights as the meat on our bones." [...] "Now, I love Lady Gaga, but as someone who also loves animals, it was really difficult for me to sit next to Lady Gaga while she was wearing that outfit," [...] DeGeneres, who is vegan, later wrote.

500|$|Gdańsk {{became the}} focal point of the strike movement. On 21 August 1980, Mieczysław Jagielski {{replaced}} Tadeusz Pyka to lead a Polish government commission which was negotiating with strikers there. The strikers were represented by the Inter-Enterprise Strike Committee, which was demanding that the workers it represented be given better rights, including better rights to strike. On 26 August meeting with representatives of the strikers at the Lenin Shipyard in Gdańsk, Jagielski promised that the right to strike would be added to a new law on the official trade unions of Poland. After 5 more days of difficult negotiations, a settlement was reached between the strikers and the government, known as the Gdańsk agreement. Norman Davies contends that Jagielski [...] "in the end realised that only two alternatives remained -either agreement on the strikers' terms or an immediate resort to force for which the government was not prepared." [...] The agreement, as well as giving the workers of the Lenin Shipyard the right to strike, also allowed them to form their own independent trade union. Jagielski said of the negotiations that led to the agreement, [...] "We have spoken as Poles to Poles...There are no winners and losers. The important thing here is that we have understood each other and the best guarantee <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> have done is hard work." [...] He was reported to have spoken eloquently.|$|E
500|$|The team quickly {{recognized}} that [...] "the controller {{really was the}} kind of magic sauce <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> wanted to do". [...] They identified three aspects of gameplay that they felt made the game stand out. These aspects included the note-matching aspect and the showmanship created by the use of the whammy bar and tilting of the guitar within the game. The third key aspect was the use of Star Power [...] "to provide a little more depth to the game— some replay value, some interest for people as they were playing beyond just hitting the notes". Harmonix used third party controllers made for GuitarFreaks that were already on the market for development of the game until RedOctane had prepared prototypes for the Guitar Hero controller. [...] The controller initially had pressure-sensitive fret buttons to mimic the playing of a real guitar, but the idea was dropped as it made the gameplay too complex. [...] The idea of using the whammy bar to boost Star Power, in addition to altering the pitch of sustained notes was only realized about a month before the completion of the game. The team had spent [...] "precious development time and resources" [...] into creating a free-style model that would have allowed players to improvise during songs but ultimately cut it as they could not work the feature into the existing gameplay.|$|E
500|$|November's {{first game}} {{was at the}} Mata Real against Paços de Ferreira. Benfica scored first with a header by Cristian Rodríguez, but Tiago Valente tied the game {{a few minutes later}} for Paços. In the 85th minute, Kostas Katsouranis scored Benefica's winning goal with an assist by Rodríguez. To Camacho, the win was [...] "difficult but very important". On 6 November, Benfica played Celtic on the road. In their second game against the team, Benfica lost 1–0 on a goal by Aiden McGeady. With the loss, Benfica was in last place and needed to defeat Milan to remain in the Champions League. Although Camacho was optimistic, he was aware of the high stakes. On 11 November, Benfica hosted Boavista in search of their fourth {{consecutive}} win in the Primeira Liga. Cardozo scored in the first half, with Boavista tying the score in the 58th minute. Benfica then scored five goals in the final 40 minutes for a 6–1 win. After the match, Rui Costa said, [...] "We had our fourth consecutive win in the Primeira Liga, and I think we are on the right track." [...] After a third international break, Benfica resumed on the 24th with an away game against Académica. Lito scored first for Académica, but a free kick by Rui Costa tied the game. Académica goalkeeper Ricardo made two errors, allowing Luisão and Adu to score Benfica's second and third goals, and Camacho credited the late win to his players' perseverance and commitment. November ended with a decisive match against Milan. Andrea Pirlo scored for Benfica, but Maxi Pereira's 23th-minute shot tied the game. Benfica's fate was determined by events in Glasgow, as Celtic defeated Shakhtar Donetsk with an added-time goal. Camacho bemoaned his team's luck: [...] "We're a bit unhappy. <b>For</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> did in this competition I think we should have had more of a chance to go through, so for me football has not been fair to Benfica." ...|$|E
