25|$|The {{most recent}} album, Listen, {{includes}} much more percussion and cross rhythms than previous material. Pritchard described the band's most recent album Listen as “percussion sonnets”. “The first couple albums I made <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>really</b> thought about rhythms, I {{focused on the}} recording and the lyrics”, Pritchard said.|$|E
25|$|The {{part that}} <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>really</b> {{developed}} {{is the death}} of Luke and Leia's mother. I had a backstory for her in earlier drafts, but it basically didn't survive. When I got to Jedi, I wanted {{one of the kids}} {{to have some kind of}} memory of her because she will be a key figure in the new episodes I'm writing. But I really debated whether or not Leia should remember her.|$|E

500|$|A large {{aspect of}} the game is the {{alternative}} history in which it is set, where the Nazis won the Second World War. The team saw this aspect as an opportunity to create everything at a very large scale, with very little limitations; [...] "so many things that we can create, and work with, and expand on. So, <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>really</b> felt that we were limited," [...] said Öjerfors.|$|E
500|$|In {{an impassioned}} defense of Fisher, Welch responded, [...] "Until this moment, Senator, I think <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>really</b> gauged your cruelty or your recklessness..." [...] When McCarthy resumed his attack, Welch {{interrupted}} him: [...] "Let us not assassinate this lad further, Senator. You've done enough. Have you {{no sense of}} decency, sir, at long last? Have you left no sense of decency?" [...] When McCarthy once again persisted, Welch cut him off and demanded the chairman [...] "call the next witness". At that point, the gallery erupted in applause and a recess was called.|$|E
500|$|After {{the album}} {{came out in}} February, the band began a four-week tour of the United States {{starting}} with Los Angeles. On February 4, the band played at the Nassau Coliseum with Blue Öyster Cult, and played with Suicide {{the next day at}} CBGB. A week after this, the band played with Blue Öyster Cult again in Poughkeepsie, to which Johnny relates: [...] "Those arena shows were a little better for us, although we would have more bad experiences in those big places. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>really</b> enjoyed playing them." [...] The band used their newly designed logo as a backdrop at concerts. They also had more advanced lighting techniques, but still only used white lights.|$|E

500|$|He {{made his}} debut for the Trinidad and Tobago {{national}} team on 29 January 2003 in a match against Finland. Jones scored his first goal on 25 May 2005 in a 4–0 win against Bermuda. He was later selected by Trinidad and Tobago for their 2006 World Cup campaign, {{where he made}} his first appearance in the competition in a 2–0 defeat against England on 15 June 2006 at Frankenstadion, Nuremberg. Jones was named as Trinidad and Tobago Football Federation's Player of the Year for 2007. Jones said, [...] "A lot of big names have won this before and <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>really</b> thought about something like this happening to me". Jones was named as captain of the Soca Warriors in August 2011 by manager Otto Pfister.|$|E
500|$|McAdams took a {{break from}} her film career from 2006 to 2007. [...] "There {{were a lot of}} cooks in the kitchen, a lot of voices around me, and I wanted to step away so I could hear my own voice again", McAdams said in 2013. [...] "Truthfully, <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>really</b> wanted to be a big movie star. I never even wanted to work outside of Canada, or outside of the theatre." [...] During that period, McAdams turned down roles in the films The Devil Wears Prada (2006), Casino Royale (2006), [...] (2006) and Get Smart (2008). In February 2006, she made a one-off stage {{appearance}} in The Vagina Monologues at St. Lawrence Centre for the Arts, Toronto to raise funds for V-Day. That same year, McAdams received a Rising Star Award nomination from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts and hosted the Academy Awards for Technical Achievement.|$|E
500|$|At age 11, Bell {{became a}} vegetarian. In an {{interview}} with PETA, Bell stated, [...] "I have always been an animal lover. I {{had a hard time}} disassociating the animals I cuddled with—dogs and cats, for example—from the animals on my plate, and <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>really</b> cared for the taste of meat. I always loved my Brussels sprouts!" [...] By 2012 Bell became vegan with her husband after watching the documentary Forks Over Knives. During her time in Michigan, Bell fostered animals from Michigan Humane Society and she now supports the San Diego-based Helen Woodward Animal Center. Bell often attends fund raisers for the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and other non-profit organizations dedicated to protecting animals. She has a Welsh Corgi-Chow Chow mix named Lola, a Welsh Corgi-Chihuahua mix named Shakey, and a black Labrador Retriever named Sadie, who was 11 years old when she was rescued from Hurricane Katrina and adopted by Bell in 2005.|$|E

500|$|In 2014, Rollins {{admitted}} a {{disdain for}} rehashing old {{music for the}} sake of it - [...] "I don’t want to play old music. To me, it is fighting battles that are already over and calling yourself a warrior. For me, I see no courage or adventure in doing the old thing over again. If others want to, that’s for them. For myself, I have to move on. Life is too short to live in the past. There is a lot to be done." [...] On the same topic, Henry more recently said in 2016 [...] "For me, music was a time and a place. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>really</b> enjoyed being in a band. It was in me and it needed to come out, like a 25-year exorcism. One day, I woke up, and I didn’t have any more lyrics. I just had nothing to contribute to the form, and I was done with band practice and travelling in groups." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{an episode}} {{guide to the}} Anderson TV series, science-fiction writer John Peel {{questions}} Mac's ethics in [...] "experimenting on" [...] Joe to further {{the development of the}} BIG RAT. On the subject of Joe as a secret agent he remarks, jokingly, [...] "Presumably there are no child labour laws in the future!" [...] La Rivière's attention is drawn to one of Mac's lines {{at the end of the}} pilot, in a scene that he considers [...] "amusing"; the professor's admonition [...] "Don't come crying to me if you get hurt!" [...] represents his preparedness to [...] "abnegate all parental responsibility" [...] towards his adoptive son. Observing the series' subscription to [...] "wider themes in Cold War culture", Cull likens the BIG RAT's powers to brainwashing, but concludes that it is a fundamentally [...] "benign" [...] technology. The more violent style introduced in Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons is sometimes evident in Joe 90: in [...] "Hi-jacked", Joe kills an enemy with a grenade, while in [...] "Project 90", Professor McClaine is menaced by a drill poised to pulverise his head. On the subject of violence, episode director Desmond Saunders comments: [...] "There was an unpleasant side to it which <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>really</b> understood. There was something about it that was very strange and sinister." ...|$|E
500|$|He {{explained}} [...] "the {{goal is to}} try to make it {{an engaging}} movie where you get some of the psychology and kind of bring a freshness but also keep the classic nature of Alice." [...] On prior versions, Burton said [...] "It was always a girl wandering around from one crazy character to another, and <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>really</b> felt any real emotional connection." [...] His goal with the new film is to give the story [...] "some framework of emotional grounding" [...] and [...] "to try and make Alice feel more like a story as opposed to a series of events." [...] Burton focused on the poem [...] "Jabberwocky" [...] as part of his structure, and refers to the described creature by the name of the poem rather than by the name [...] "Jabberwock" [...] used in the poem. Burton also stated that he does not see his version as either a sequel to any existing Alice film nor as a [...] "re-imagining". However, the idea of the climax of the story being Alice's battle with the Queen's champion, the Jabberwocky, was first added in the video game American McGee's Alice, and the landscape, tower, weapons and appearance of Alice in those scenes of the film are very reminiscent of the same scenes in the game.|$|E
5000|$|Case {{resigned}} as Praemonstrator, responding to Moina, [...] "I {{have no desire}} to be a 'teacher and pioneer in this Purgatorial World.' Guidance seems to have removed me from the high place to which <b>I</b> have <b>never</b> <b>really</b> aspired. The relief is great." ...|$|R

500|$|Pamela and Bobby's {{relationship}} {{changed significantly}} {{as the show}} went on and began to progress. In order to create conflict, the producers brought in actors Priscilla Presley (Jenna Wade) and John Beck (Mark Graison) to cause drama for the couple. Eventually, the two characters divorced one another and went their separate ways. After becoming involved with Ewing oil, Bobby tended to put Pam on the backburner with the company coming first. In an interview with People, Principal said: [...] "I wouldn't {{put up with the}} way Pam is treated by Bobby." [...] She also added, [...] "Our marriage just doesn't work anymore and I want a divorce." [...] With the impending couple doomed, Pamela began a newfound relationship with Mark Graison (played by John Beck). The producers of Dallas were faced with the obstacle of getting the audience to root for a new love interest in Pam's life. When asked about the reception of his characters relationship with Pamela, Beck commented: [...] "It was always set up that way from the beginning, so it was quite a task and of course they came back together in the long run. I was just hoping for the best. I never got an extraordinary reaction from the public but it was everywhere, so constant recognition. It was pretty amazing but I never saw it the way he sees it but I can see his point of view. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>really</b> looked at it like that." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{asked if}} the 1995 thriller film Seven was an {{inspiration}} to Saw, Whannell said [...] "For me as the writer, definitely. I mean, Seven is just a very well constructed film, and if you're writing a thriller, it can't hurt to study it. In terms of the story though, James and <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>really</b> felt Seven was that close to our film. I guess if you stand back, you have two detectives chasing a psychopath, who uses vile methods to teach people lessons, and those points echo Seven. What we always liked about Saw, though, {{was the fact that}} the story is told from the point of view of two of the psychopath's victims, instead of the police chasing after him, as you so often see." [...] Entertainment Weekly Owen Gleiberman compared the plot to Seven saying, [...] "In a blatant imitation of Seven, Saw features a lunatic sadist whose ghoulish crimes are meant, in each case, to mirror the sins of his victims. The twist here is that the psycho doesn't do the killing." [...] Richard J. Leskosky of Champaign-Urbana's The News-Gazette said [...] "Saw wants to be taken as another Seven. Though it features perverse gross-out scenes and a villain with a superficially pedantic motive behind his crimes (his victims, if they survive, have learned to appreciate life more), it lacks the finesse and polish of the David Fincher film." ...|$|E
500|$|McCain {{was almost}} killed on board Forrestal on July 29, 1967. [...] While the air wing was {{preparing}} to launch attacks, a Zuni rocket from an F-4 Phantom accidentally fired across the carrier's deck. [...] The rocket struck either McCain's A-4E Skyhawk or one near it. The impact ruptured the Skyhawk's fuel tank, which ignited the fuel and knocked two bombs loose. [...] McCain later said, [...] "I thought my aircraft exploded. Flames were everywhere." [...] McCain escaped from his jet by climbing out of the cockpit, working himself to {{the nose of the}} jet, and jumping off its refueling probe onto the burning deck. His flight suit caught on fire as he rolled through the flames, but he was able to put it out. [...] He went to help another pilot trying to escape the fire when the first bomb exploded; McCain was thrown backwards ten feet (three meters) and suffered minor wounds when struck in the legs and chest by fragments. McCain helped crewmen throw unexploded bombs overboard off the hangar deck elevator, then went to Forrestals ready room and with other pilots watched the ensuing fire and the fire-fighting efforts on the room's closed-circuit television. The fire killed 134sailors, injured scores of others, destroyed at least 20aircraft, and took 24hours to control. [...] In Saigon a day after the conflagration, McCain praised the heroism of enlisted men who gave their lives trying to save the pilots on deck, and told New York Times reporter R. W. Apple, Jr., [...] "It's a difficult thing to say. But now that I've seen what the bombs and the napalm did to the people on our ship, I'm not so sure that I want to drop any more of that stuff on North Vietnam." [...] But such a change of course was unlikely; as McCain added, [...] "I always {{wanted to be in the}} Navy. I was born into it and <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>really</b> considered another profession. But I always had trouble with the regimentation." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{went to work}} {{therefore}} without delay, {{but before}} doing so once again solemnly and earnestly committed my soul and body {{to the care of}} God.

2500|$|He also {{commented on}} [...] "Willow": [...] "It's kind of about how {{my mother died}} {{as it was a}} black area and I hadn't {{realised}} what had happened until I saw my brother. He told me what went on with the family and <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>really</b> knew until a year afterwards, and I wrote it down directly after that".|$|E
2500|$|Marr was the titular {{subject of}} the 2007 single [...] "Johnny Marr" [...] by the Canadian singer Carole Pope, {{formerly}} of the band Rough Trade. Pope described her inspiration and choice of Marr thus: [...] "I was actually getting nostalgic, which <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>really</b> do, about living on a certain street in Toronto in the '80s. The Smiths were the soundtrack of that time. I love [...] Morrissey, but I know he's trouble." ...|$|E

5000|$|Alun Evans has said: [...] "It's {{essentially}} not complicated music, it's just rock 'n' roll basically, {{simple and}} raw.
