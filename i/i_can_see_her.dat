60|$|Supposing you {{danced with}} your mother, Henry. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> toes itching inside her black satin slippers.|$|E
6000|$|... "But I {{have looked}} at her a great many times while Monsieur has been talking: <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> quite well from this corner." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> now {{pleading}} with me, speaking with a frankness as bright and amazing as {{the dawn of}} the first great morning.|$|E
50|$|Problem definition: <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> in <b>her</b> {{eyes that}} she thinks I'm smart (thinking about other's {{expressions}} as indicating supposed thoughts).|$|R

6000|$|... "It's the steamer, sir. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> now <b>see</b> <b>her</b> smoke. She's just {{clearing}} the land, {{on the south}} side of the island, and seems to be coming round to meet us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Poor little Cherry! I'll {{come when}} <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> in greater peace, but I must buckle to with the {{beginning}} of the year, Fee.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Aha--now <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>her!</b> [...] Stand aside: [...] Don't thrust {{her from}} the table [...] Where, meek-eyed, She makes attempt with matron-manners to preside.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, yes; I {{hardly know}} how <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>her,</b> as I have quarrelled to the knife with Lord Fawn; and Lord Fawn is {{recognised}} {{by his mother}} and sisters as the one living Jupiter upon earth." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{are headed}} now," [...] said he, [...] "right {{away from the}} shore. We are pointed towards the steamer. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> just <b>see</b> <b>her,</b> working {{up and down in}} the offing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite {{out of the}} question. After {{what has}} passed between us {{on the subject of}} the lost Diamond, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> neither <b>see</b> <b>her,</b> nor write to her, as things are now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{and what}} woman don't I {{should like to}} know? As for that body with him--she don't know what love is--at least what I call love! <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> in <b>her</b> face she don't." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> now as {{she stood}} there with her brows nearly frowning, her blue eyes looking before her, her mouth almost petulant. [...] "One feels {{that there are so}} many things going on--out of one's reach," [...] she said.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{there is}} a Gryphoness in the bushes," [...] said the Princess, [...] "let her come out. No matter how frightful she is, I would rather she should come where <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>her,</b> than to have her hiding near me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh yes, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> sailing in, magnificently kind {{from her}} elevation. But {{how in the}} world did she manage to pick up all this in the time?' said poor Jane, tired and pestered into the {{sharpness}} of her early youth.|$|E
6000|$|A {{sensible}} 'ooman, {{whatever it}} is she says; that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> by <b>her</b> [...] pretty face. Come along then, my dear. There'll be no bones broke, [...] and we'll take our lot with Christian resignation.|$|R
6000|$|... "They're {{all getting}} their winter finery {{now and the}} talk about it would make you sick. The Story Girl is getting hers from Paris and Felicity is awful jealous though she pretends she isn't. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> through <b>her.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "'Inutile!'" [...] Lady Peggy exclaimed. [...] "Wilhelmina has the 'wander fever.' <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> it in <b>her</b> face. Is it the thunder, I wonder?" ...|$|R
60|$|She {{stared at}} me for a moment. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> pretty face now as it looked at me--her impenetrable dear face. She laughed a queer little laugh and her color went for a moment, and then so soon as she had spoken, came back again.|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{went back}} to all native, at the last, and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> yet, biting {{a bite out of}} the raw fish ere she tossed them to her women to eat. And she made them finish her poi, or {{whatever}} else she did not finish of herself. She--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{criminal}} who {{now sits}} {{before the court}} licking her paws," [...] resumed the Woggle-Bug, [...] "has long desired to unlawfully eat the fat piglet, which was {{no bigger than a}} mouse. And finally she made a wicked plan to satisfy her depraved appetite for pork. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>her,</b> in my mind's eye--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But <b>I</b> never <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> there--at {{least not}} alone. I {{believe that she}} never is alone. She always keeps {{a lot of people}} round her in order to stave off her lovers. Upon my word, Harriet, I think I'll give it up. It is {{impossible}} that I should make such a declaration to her as that you propose." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} Mr. Robarts has embarrassed himself," [...] said Lady Lufton, looking very seriously. [...] "Rumours reach me which are most distressing. I have {{said nothing to}} anybody as yet--not even to Fanny; but <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> in <b>her</b> face, and hear in the tones of her voice, that she is {{suffering}} some great sorrow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do not know, Ana, {{yet that}} Hebrew wife of mine {{has been much}} in my mind of late. She was wise in her way, as wise as loving, was she not, and if we could <b>see</b> <b>her</b> once again, perhaps she would answer the question. But {{although}} she seems so near to me, <b>I</b> never <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>her,</b> quite. <b>Can</b> you, Ana?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No {{nonsense}} at all, Claude,' cried Jane in {{her very}} very pertest tone, 'it is exactly like Eleanor; I am sure <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> {{with her hands}} before her, saying in her prim voice, [...] "I must turn my old black silk and trim it with crape, for I have had a misfortune, and lost my brother."' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But they won't--Sue won't!" [...] exclaimed Phillotson to himself. [...] "Gillingham is so {{matter of}} fact. She's {{affected}} by Christminster sentiment and teaching. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> {{views on the}} indissolubility of marriage well enough, and I know where she got them. They are not mine; but I shall make use of them to further mine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Think," [...] she was saying, [...] "only think, Nou, {{our last}} night in this hateful city, and then, instead of that {{stifling}} workshop and the terror of Domitian, the open sea and the fresh salt wind and nobody to fear but God. Luna! Is it not a beautiful name for a ship? <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>her,</b> all silver----" ...|$|E
60|$|Of the parting with {{my mother}} that noon I cannot speak, even at this late day, so painful was it. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> now <b>her</b> pale face as {{she stood on the}} veranda {{watching}} me walk away, doing my best not to look back upon that mournful picture, and yet turning my head again and again despite all efforts to the contrary.|$|R
6000|$|... "Quit it, delete it, cease it," [...] Chauncey Delarouse admonished testily. [...] "Tell of the Princess. That's {{what makes}} old blood leap again. Almost <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>her.</b> Was she wonderful?" ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> {{nothing of}} <b>her,</b> sir, nor of the Princess either. There is [...] {{a crowd of}} idlers up there leaning over the bannisters, and you may [...] have mistaken some others for them.|$|R
6000|$|... "Great, and rich, and beautiful," [...] she cried. [...] "Far {{down the}} course of time <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> still leading the nations, a wayward queen among the peoples, great in war, but greater in peace, quick in thought, deft in action, with her people's will for her sole monarch, from the sands of Calais to the blue seas of the south." ...|$|E
60|$|Then {{again she}} shrugged her {{shoulders}} and left me wondering what she meant by her dark sayings. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> going now, a wooden bowl in her hand, and in it a horn spoon of which the handle was cracked longways, and thus in my mind ends all the scene of my sickness after the slaying of the white bear.|$|E
6000|$|... "I met {{her pretty}} often during those months that Helen Lavery was running her round," [...] {{she said at}} length. [...] "It always {{seemed to me to}} have a touch of the heroic, that absurd effort she was making to 'qualify' herself, so that she might be of use to him. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> doing {{something}} quite big, if she thought it would help him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Blest," [...] says Mr. Guppy, {{staring in}} a kind of dismay at his friend, [...] "if <b>I</b> <b>can</b> ever have <b>seen</b> <b>her.</b> Yet I know her! Has the picture been engraved, miss?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I thought so," [...] {{he said to}} {{the first}} officer. [...] "I fancied that fellow wasn't alone. He would hardly have ventured to try his {{strength}} with us, if he had been. Send a man up to the tops, and let him <b>see</b> what he <b>can</b> make her out to be. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> only <b>see</b> <b>her</b> topmasts, but <b>I</b> <b>can</b> make out no yards." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I never should, Mr. Holmes. But my wife does. It is {{frightening}} her to death. She says nothing, but <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> terror in <b>her</b> eyes. That's why I want to sift {{the matter to}} the bottom." ...|$|R
