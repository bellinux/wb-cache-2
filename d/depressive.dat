40|$|Twenty {{endogenous}} <b>depressives,</b> twenty reactive <b>depressives,</b> twenty schizophrenics {{and twenty}} randomly selected normal subjects were studied to compare familial features, incidence of actual and perceived parental deprivation and incidence of suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts. The major hypothesis was that endogenous <b>depressives</b> would suffer more parental deprivation than other groups including reactive <b>depressives,</b> previous research having not generally differentiated {{between the two}} types of <b>depressives.</b> Data was gathered from an interview which was based on a questionnaire. Endogenous <b>depressives</b> were found to be more likely to have had both parents absent from the home for some period, and {{were more likely to have}} felt as children that their fathers did not love them and to continue to believe this as adults. Normals were found to have a lower incidence of suicidal thoughts and suicidal attempts than the other three groups. Although results seldom reached statistical significance reactive <b>depressives</b> tended to be less parentally deprived on almost all variables. Results suggest that while in the past research related to parental deprivation has focused primarily on the mother-child relationship the area of father-child relationships may be at least equally important...|$|R

5|$|Major <b>depressive</b> {{disorder}} (MDD), {{also known}} simply as depression, is a mental disorder characterized by {{at least two weeks}} of low mood that is present across most situations. It is often accompanied by low self-esteem, loss of interest in normally enjoyable activities, low energy, and pain without a clear cause. People may also occasionally have false beliefs or see or hear things that others cannot. Some people have periods of depression separated by years in which they are normal while others nearly always have symptoms present. Major <b>depressive</b> disorder can negatively affect a person's personal, work, or school life, as well as sleeping, eating habits, and general health. Between 2–7% of adults with major depression die by suicide, and up to 60% of people who die by suicide had depression or another mood disorder.|$|E

We found that speech pause time (SPT) during a counting test correlated with the reaction time of both depressed patients and controls.

We demonstrated increased SPT in unipolar <b>depressives,</b> and also in retarded <b>depressives</b> as a group when compared with controls and with non-retarded <b>depressives.</b> SPT varied diurnally in controls, but not in depressed subjects. It did not correlate with biological markers of depression (REM sleep latency and the dexamethasone suppression test).

40|$|Disinhibited {{activity}} of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) neuroendocrine system, characterized most specifically by abnormal responses to the dexamethasone suppression test (DST), is observed in 40 - 50 % of patients with endogenous depression. The heterogeneity of endogenous <b>depressives</b> {{with respect to this}} neuroendocrine marker is so far unexplained. A recent report from Iowa suggested that genetic factors could account for this heterogeneity, since abnormal DST responses were found with widely differing frequencies among primary unipolar <b>depressives</b> subtyped by the genetic criteria of Winokur. We studied 14 patients with primary endogenous delusional unipolar depression. Abnormal DST responses were found in 79 % of the entire group, and with similar frequencies among each of the Winokur subtypes. In particular, five of six patients (83 %) with depression spectrum disease had abnormal DST results. This contrasts with a frequency of 4 % reported by the Iowa group. We conclude that disinhibited HPA activity does occur in depression spectrum disease when a delusional endogenous depression is present. Our results and those of the Iowa study could both be consistent with a threshold model of HPA activation. The high frequency of positive DST results in delusional endogenous <b>depressives</b> may be determined by disinhibited central pain mechanisms. Variations in this clinical dimension, combined with variations in threshold for HPA activation by pain mechanisms, could account for the heterogeneity of DST responses among endogenous <b>depressives...</b>|$|R
