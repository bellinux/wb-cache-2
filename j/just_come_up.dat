25|$|As {{the second}} Confederate return line collapsed, Ayres and Sheridan came forward. Sheridan ordered Chamberlain to take command {{of all the}} {{infantry}} in the vicinity and to push for Five Forks. He did so {{with the help of}} one of Griffin's staff officers. After being cautioned by Sheridan and Ayres that his men were firing into their own cavalry, Chamberlain told Sheridan that he should go to a safer place. Instead, Sheridan rode west on White Oak Road, following Griffin and Bartlett who had <b>just</b> <b>come</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E
25|$|My friend Clinch Smith {{made the}} {{proposition}} that we should leave and go toward the stern. But there arose before us from the decks below a mass of humanity several lines deep converging on the Boat Deck facing us and completely blocking our passage to the stern. There were women in the crowd {{as well as men}} and these seemed to be steerage passengers who had <b>just</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> from the decks below. Even among these people there was no hysterical cry, no evidence of panic. Oh the agony of it.|$|E
25|$|In the centre, general Gardanne belatedly formed his men and {{painstakingly}} fought his way {{up towards}} Caldiero against a determined Bellegarde. Gardanne's first attempt failed and {{he was forced to}} fall back on Rotta, where he was immediately reinforced by Partounneaux and d'Espagne. With his force thus augmented, Gardanne moved forward again and this time the French managed to take the vital position of Caldiero. A furious Austrian counterattack regained the position only to see Gardanne receive further reinforcements, one of Duhesme's brigades, which helped retake Caldiero. Bellegarde reformed his men for another counterattack, which he led in cooperation with Reuss-Plauen's forces, which had <b>just</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> as reinforcements. It took a considerable effort from the combined forces of Bellegarde and Reuss-Plauen to drive the French out of Caldiero, but Gardanne sounded the charge and regained control of the village after fierce hand-to-hand combat. The Austrians finally evacuated the position and the exhausted French drove them out and then fell back to the relative safety of the village.|$|E

500|$|Hochuli's {{presence}} {{on the football field}} has created a cult following. His rise in popularity {{is believed to have been}} started by Phil Simms, a former NFL quarterback and current color commentator for the NFL on CBS, who made reference to the size of Hochuli's arms during a telecast. [...] On the Internet, websites that sell Hochuli merchandise as well as blogs with his namesake exist. He is often affectionately referred to as [...] "Hochules", a portmanteau of his last name and [...] "Hercules", in homage to his large biceps. While he is aware of his celebrity status, Hochuli does not understand it. He said in a USA Today interview, [...] "I get a kick out of the notoriety, because I'm just a referee. I'm not the players. The players are the game. They're what this is all about. I get notoriety because I explain things, and I get notoriety because I have a decent physique, which is funny because I'm a shrimp, a peewee compared to those players. Neither one of those things has anything to do with whether I'm a good referee." [...] His recognition extends to the streets, in airports, and in the courtroom. He has been approached by notable athletes such as former National Basketball Association (NBA) player Charles Barkley at the airport. [...] "It never ceases to amaze me," [...] Hochuli told the Arizona Daily Star. [...] "The number of people that will <b>just</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> to me and recognize me." [...] He appreciates the attention, saying, [...] "I enjoy the fact that there are people who like me as a referee. I hear from a lot of people and I enjoy that. Like anybody, I like praise. Probably because of my personality, I thrive on that more than other people." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tipperary manager Liam Sheedy {{said the}} team {{could not have}} done any more, [...] "these lads have done {{everything}} I’ve asked of them in last eight months, everything I could possible want them to.

2500|$|Initially, Baldelli had {{to adjust}} to {{professional}} baseball. Says Baldelli, [...] "In Princeton, I {{had a hard time}} with all parts of the game…I didn't know how to play the game. Coming out of high school, I'd <b>just</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> to the plate and swing as hard as I could every time and try to smoke the ball.

In April, she visited Sudan with Wolders {{as part of a}} mission called [...] "Operation Lifeline". Because of civil war, food from aid {{agencies}} had been cut off. The mission was to ferry food to southern Sudan. Hepburn said, [...] "I saw but one glaring truth: These are not natural disasters but man-made tragedies for which there is only one man-made solution – peace." [...] In October 1989, Hepburn and Wolders went to Bangladesh. John Isaac, a UN photographer, said, [...] "Often the kids would have flies all over them, but she would just go hug them. I had never seen that. Other people had a certain amount of hesitation, but she would just grab them. Children would <b>just</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> to hold her hand, touch her – she was like the Pied Piper." ...|$|E
