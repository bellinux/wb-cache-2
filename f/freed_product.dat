40|$|The primary {{objectives}} of a <b>free</b> <b>product</b> recovery system are to recover as much <b>free</b> <b>product</b> as possible, {{as quickly as}} possible, and with as little expense as possible. In order to design an effective and efficient <b>free</b> <b>product</b> recovery system, you need to answer several questions: “What is the areal and vertical extent of the free product?”, “How much <b>free</b> <b>product</b> has accumulated?”, “How much of the total volume is recoverable?”, and “How quickly can the <b>free</b> <b>product</b> be recovered?”. The answers {{to each of these}} questions relate to the recoverability of <b>free</b> <b>product</b> from the subsurface. Intuitively, the most effective locations for <b>free</b> <b>product</b> recovery devices are those places where the accumulations are the greatest. Early tasks, therefore, include locating those areas where <b>free</b> <b>product</b> accumulations are the greatest and delineating the areal extent of the <b>free</b> <b>product</b> plume (or pools).

40|$|We prove Khintchine type inequalities {{for words}} of a fixed length in a reduced <b>free</b> <b>product</b> of $C^*$-algebras (or von Neumann algebras).

We then apply these results to various approximation properties on reduced <b>free</b> <b>products.</b> As a first application, we give a quick proof of Dykema's theorem on the stability of exactness under the reduced <b>free</b> <b>product</b> for $C^*$-algebras.

In the 10 th paper we study the first order theory of <b>free</b> <b>products</b> of arbitrary groups. With a given (coefficient-free) predicate, we associate (non-canonically) a finite collection of graded resolutions. These graded resolutions enable us to reduce uniformly an arbitrary coefficient-free sentence over a <b>free</b> <b>product</b> to a finite disjunction of conjunctions of sentences over the factors of the <b>free</b> <b>product.</b> The graded resolutions enable a uniform quantifier elimination over <b>free</b> <b>products,</b> where a coefficient-free predicate (over <b>free</b> <b>products)</b> is shown to be equivalent to a predicate in an extended language, that contains finitely many quantifiers over the factors of the <b>free</b> <b>product,</b> and only 3 quantifiers over the ambient <b>free</b> <b>product.</b> These uniform reductions allow us to answer affirmatively a question of R.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{investigate}} the properties of <b>free</b> <b>products</b> of C*-algebras and continuous bundles of C*-algebras. We also consider how these two areas are connected. In the first chapter we present background material relevant to the thesis. We discuss nuclearity, exactness and Hilbert C*-modules. Then we review the definitions and properties of bundles and <b>free</b> <b>products</b> of C*-algebras. The second chapter considers reduced amalgamated <b>free</b> <b>products</b> of C*-algebras. We show that, if the initial conditional expectations involved are all faithful, then the resulting <b>free</b> <b>product</b> conditional expectation is also faithful. In the third chapter {{we are interested in}} the properties of reduced <b>free</b> <b>product</b> C*-algebras. We introduce the orthounitary basis concept for unital C*-algebras with faithful traces and show that reduced <b>free</b> <b>products</b> of C*-algebras with orthounitary bases are, except in a few special cases, not nuclear. Building on this, we then determine the ideals in a certain tensor product C v Cop of the reduced <b>free</b> <b>product</b> with its opposite C*-algebra. In {{the second half of the}} chapter, we use Cuntz-Pimsner C*-algebras to study reduced <b>free</b> <b>products</b> of nuclear C*-algebras with respect to pure states. We show that, if the G. N. S. representations of the C*-algebras involved contain the compact operators, then the reduced <b>free</b> <b>product</b> C* -algebra is also nuclear. Chapter four looks at the minimal tensor product operation on continuous bundles of C*-algebras. We construct, for any non-exact C*-algebra C, a continuous bundle A on the unit interval [0, 1] such that A C is not continuous. This leads to a new characterisation of exactness for C*-algebras. These results are then extended to allow for any compact infinite metric space as the base space. Finally, we introduce <b>free</b> <b>product</b> operations on bundles of C*-algebras in chapter five. Both full and reduced <b>free</b> <b>product</b> bundles are constructed. We show that taking the <b>free</b> <b>product</b> (full or reduced) of two continuous bundles gives another continuous bundle, at least when the bundle C*-algebras are exact.
