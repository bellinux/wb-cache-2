25|$|Tobacco was popular, {{both for}} {{personal}} use, and for trading with Indians and other pioneers. Each person brought {{at least two}} changes of clothes and multiple pairs of boots (two to three pairs often wore out on the trip). About 25 pounds of soap was recommended for a party of four, for bathing and washing clothes. A washboard and tub were usually brought for washing clothes. Wash days typically occurred {{once or twice a}} month, or less, depending on availability of good grass, water, and fuel. Most wagons carried tents for sleeping, though in good weather most would sleep outside. A thin fold-up mattress, blankets, pillows, canvas, or rubber gutta percha ground covers were used for sleeping. Sometimes an unfolded <b>feather</b> <b>bed</b> mattress was brought for the wagon, if there were pregnant women or very young children along. The wagons had no springs, and the ride along the trail was very rough. Despite modern depictions, hardly anyone actually rode in the wagons; it was too dusty, too rough, and too hard on the livestock.|$|E
2500|$|The Rabbis {{taught in}} a Baraita that the words of [...] {{regarding}} the Hebrew servant, [...] "he fares well with you," [...] indicate that the Hebrew servant had to be [...] "with" [...] – that is, equal to – the master in food and drink. Thus the master could not eat white bread and have the servant eat black bread. The master could not drink old wine and have the servant drink new wine. The master could not sleep on a <b>feather</b> <b>bed</b> and have the servant sleep on straw. Hence, they said that buying a Hebrew servant was like buying a master. Similarly, Rabbi Simeon deduced from the words of [...] "Then he shall go out from you, he and his children with him," [...] that the master was liable {{to provide for the}} servant's children until the servant went out. And Rabbi Simeon deduced from the words of [...] "If he is married, then his wife shall go out with him," [...] that the master was responsible to provide for the servant's wife, as well.|$|E
2500|$|Abaye {{said that}} because the law (in [...] and elsewhere) {{required}} the master to treat a Hebrew slave well — and as an equal in food, drink, and sleeping accommodations — {{it was said that}} buying a Hebrew slave was like buying a master.

40|$|Various {{cross-sectional}} and {{longitudinal studies}} have suggested that synthetic bedding is associated with asthma, allergic rhinitis and eczema while <b>feather</b> <b>bedding</b> seems to be protective. Synthetic bedding items have higher house dust mite allergen levels than <b>feather</b> <b>bedding</b> items. This is possibly the mechanism involved although fungal and bacterial proinflammatory compounds and volatile organic compounds may play a role. In this review we present and discuss the epidemiological evidence and suggest possible mechanisms. Primary intervention studies are required to show whether <b>feather</b> <b>bedding</b> is protective for the development of childhood asthma and allergic diseases while secondary intervention studies are required to potentially reduce symptoms and medication use in subjects with established disease...|$|R
60|$|They {{were very}} thankful, to be sure, for this relief, and {{particularly}} the straw was a very great comfort to them; for though the ingenious carpenter had made them frames to lie in, like troughs, and filled them with leaves of trees and such things as they could get, and had cut all their tent cloth out to make coverlids, yet they lay damp and hard and unwholesome till this straw came, which was to them like <b>feather</b> <b>beds,</b> and, as John said, more welcome than <b>feather</b> <b>beds</b> {{would have been at}} another time.|$|R

40|$|Reducing {{environmental}} {{tobacco smoke}} exposure decreases health care utilization among poor asthmatic children. Dust mite reduction by chemical measures is potentially harmful. (Grade of recommendations: B, based on single randomized controlled trial.)

60|$|This, however, did {{not satisfy}} the captain, and orders were {{forthwith}} {{given that the}} fire should be taken away, the curtains stripped off, the <b>feather</b> <b>beds</b> removed, and everything reduced to {{pretty much the same}} state in which it had usually been left for Harry Norman's accommodation.

60|$|The {{work was}} as badly done as the servant was surly and disagreeable; {{in the corners}} of the rooms there were {{collected}} heaps of dust; spiders' webs hung from the ceilings and in front of the window-panes; the beds were hardly ever made, and the <b>feather</b> <b>beds,</b> so beloved by the old and feeble cats, had never once been shaken since Lizina left the house. At Father Gatto's next visit he found the whole colony in a state of uproar.|$|R
6000|$|... [FN#168] This {{story is}} perhaps the least {{interesting}} in the collection. I have translated it literally, {{in order to give}} an idea of the original. The reader will remark in it the source of our own nursery tale about the princess who was so high born and delicately bred, that she could discover the three peas laid beneath a straw mattress and four <b>feather</b> <b>beds.</b> The Hindus, however, believe that Sybaritism can be carried so far; I remember my Pandit asserting the truth of the story.|$|R
5|$|For {{that entire}} day the Comanches plundered and burned buildings, draping {{themselves}} grandly in top hats and stolen linens. They tied <b>feather</b> <b>beds</b> {{and bolts of}} cloth to their horses, and dragged them. They herded large numbers of cattle into pens and slaughtered them. One outraged citizen, Judge John Hays, grabbed a gun and waded ashore through the shallow water, and roared at the bemused warriors, but the Indians chose to spare him, believing him mad. He later found that he had waded ashore to face nearly a thousand Indians with an unloaded pistol.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is it the plunder? But {{little did}} I t'ink of it till I saw the {{movables}} on the ground, some burnt, and some broke, and other some {{as good as}} new. It would be convanient to have one <b>feather</b> <b>bed</b> in the corps, anyway." ...|$|E
60|$|All {{were out}} in the fields, men, women, and children, and in one {{hayfield}} I saw the baby's cradle--baby, of course, concealed from view under a small avalanche of a <b>feather</b> <b>bed,</b> as the general fashion in these parts seems to be. The women wore broad, flat hats, and all appeared to be working rather lazily, as it was coming on evening.|$|E
6000|$|... "Giant doesn't {{want to be}} {{like the}} man who bragged of what he would do in case of a fire at his house," [...] said Whopper. [...] "He was going to be calm and careful and do things just so.

60|$|My grandfather, for his part, {{got into}} bed, and drew over {{him one of}} those great bags of down, under which they smother {{a man in the}} Low Countries; and there he lay, melting between, two <b>feather</b> <b>beds,</b> like an anchovy {{sandwich}} between two slices of toast and butter. He was a warm-complexioned man, and this smothering played the very deuce with him. So, sure enough, in a little while it seemed as if a legion of imps were twitching at him and all the blood in his veins was in fever heat.|$|R
5|$|In {{the more}} popular {{versions}} of the tale, only one pea is used. However, Charles Boner added in two more peas in his translation of the story upon which Andersen based his tale. Other differences amongst versions {{can be seen in}} various numbers of mattresses as well as <b>feather</b> <b>beds.</b> Versions of the story differ based on whether or not the character of the helper is included. The helper, in some cases, tells the princess to pretend as though she slept badly. In other versions, the helper does not appear at all, and the princess decides to lie all on her own.|$|R
5000|$|A later {{instance}} of this penalty appears in Notes and Queries (series 4, vol. v), which quotes James Howell writing in Madrid in 1623 of the [...] "boisterous Bishop of Halberstadt ... having taken {{a place where}} there were two monasteries of nuns and friars, he caused divers <b>feather</b> <b>beds</b> to be ripped, and all the feathers thrown into a great hall, whither the nuns and friars were thrust naked with their bodies oiled and pitched and to tumble among these feathers, which makes them here (Madrid) presage him an ill-death." [...] (The Bishop was apparently Christian the Younger of Brunswick.) ...|$|R
