40|$|F. A. Hayeks’work represents, without doubt,the most {{comprehensive}} and influential contribution {{to what has}} been described as the modern “rebirth of classical liberalism ” (Gray 1982). His legacy will, therefore, surely be of decisive influence on the future development of classical liberal thought. The issue I address in this paper concerns the implications of Hayek’s work forthe role of rational institutional design and constructive reform within a liberal political agenda. With regard to this issue Hayek’s work appears to contain a fundamentaltension between what I call “rational liberalism ” and “evolutionary agnosticism. ” By rational liberalism I mean the message implied in those parts of Hayek’s writings that provide rational arguments in favor of the liberal order, arguments that spellout reasons why such an order can be considered preferable to alternative arrangements, {{and what can be done}} to establish and maintain it. 1 By contrast, evolutionary agnosticism refers to a certain tenor in Hayek’s thoughts on cultural evolution that seems to suggest that any efforts in deliberate institutional reform and construction must ultimately be futile inthe <b>faceof</b> <b>an</b> evolutionary process that pays no attention to what we mayconsider to be desirable or beneficial. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—What is <b>a</b> <b>security</b> network? In this paper, <b>a</b> <b>security</b> {{network is}} {{considered}} as <b>a</b> diagram of <b>security</b> systems deployed {{in different places}} in a guard zone. For <b>a</b> <b>security</b> network, its vulnerability is an important metric to judge whether its protection effectiveness is good or not. How to evaluate the vulnerability of <b>a</b> <b>security</b> network? We bring forward a protection model of <b>a</b> <b>security</b> system based on Neyman-Pearson criterion. According to the model, we propose methods to determine the most vulnerable path of <b>a</b> <b>security</b> network. The protection probability of the most vulnerable path is {{used to assess the}} vulnerability of <b>a</b> <b>security</b> network. Ultimately, we can gain insight about the vulnerability of <b>a</b> <b>security</b> network. Keywords-security network; vulnerability evaluation; neyman-pearson criterion; protection probability.
