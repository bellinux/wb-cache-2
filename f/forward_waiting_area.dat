40|$|AbstractThis study {{estimated}} the operational impacts of left-turn <b>waiting</b> <b>areas</b> at signalized intersections using the VISSIM simulation technique. A procedure was proposed to model capacity of single left-turn lanes with <b>waiting</b> <b>areas</b> in VISSIM. Using {{data collected from}} 7 different sites, the VISSIM simulation model was calibrated and validated. The simulation results of the calibrated VISSIM model were compared to field measured capacity, {{as well as the}} capacity estimated using the analytical model developed in our previous studies. The calibrated VISSIM simulation model yields a Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE) of 8. 28 % for the exclusive left-turn lanes, indicating that VISSIM provides reasonable capacity estimates for left-turn lanes with <b>waiting</b> <b>areas</b> at signalized intersections. Based on the calibrated VISSIM simulation model, the capacity for left-turn lanes with <b>waiting</b> <b>areas</b> with different storage capacity was compared with the scenario for which the left-turn <b>waiting</b> <b>area</b> is not installed. The results show that the use of left-turn <b>waiting</b> <b>areas</b> could increase the capacity for the left-turn movement, and the capacity gains would increase with the increase {{in the size of the}} left-turn <b>waiting</b> <b>areas...</b>|$|R

25|$|Trains {{depart from}} the station's single side {{platform}} every 15 minutes. Passengers access trains directly from an enclosed <b>waiting</b> <b>area,</b> and a glass wall with sliding doors separate trains from the platform and open to allow passengers to board directly from the <b>waiting</b> <b>area</b> without exposure to the elements. The floor of the <b>waiting</b> <b>area</b> is level with the train floor, which allows for step-free boarding.|$|R
50|$|The Soft Seat <b>waiting</b> <b>area</b> {{requires}} a Soft Class train ticket to access. The seating {{in the area}} is generally more comfortable, {{and it is an}} enclosed area, with security personnel on shift at the entrances. The regular <b>waiting</b> <b>area</b> {{is in the middle of}} the station, and can house thousands of passengers. The VIP <b>waiting</b> <b>area</b> is only accessible with special identification, such as diplomatic documents.|$|R

5000|$|The bus {{terminal}} is underground, one level above the concourse level; {{it consists of}} a large outdoor <b>waiting</b> <b>area</b> serving as its bus platforms, with a relatively modest indoor <b>waiting</b> <b>area.</b> Because some of the bus platforms are {{far away from the}} indoor <b>waiting</b> <b>area,</b> it is practical to wait outdoors for some routes due to the way TTC {{bus terminal}}s work; unfortunately, because it is underground, the air quality on the bus platforms can be poor during busy hours. Stairs connect the indoor <b>waiting</b> <b>area</b> to a usually-unmanned pedestrian entrance/exit on the ground level just outside Fairview Mall.|$|R
40|$|AbstractTo {{improve the}} traffic {{operation}} {{and take advantage}} of the space resource, left-turn vehicles <b>waiting</b> <b>area</b> and straight vehicles <b>waiting</b> <b>area</b> are adopted separately at intersection at home and abroad, but there is not much research for using left-turn and straight <b>waiting</b> <b>area</b> together at the same intersection. Research using simulation software PARAMICS combining with programming API to simulate a specific comprehensive <b>waiting</b> <b>area</b> in Guangzhou city under nine different traffic volumes for three conditions: following control strategy, underutilizing control strategy and without control strategy. By evaluating the following four indexes: link delay, queue length, link average speed and passing vehicles, the simulation results indicate that the improving effect of following control strategy is superior to the underutilizing control strategy. Implementing comprehensive <b>waiting</b> <b>area</b> and in conjunction with the following control strategy can improve traffic operation when traffic volume is larger than the surveyed situation volume while the improvement is more effectively when traffic volume continues to increase. Setting comprehensive <b>waiting</b> <b>area</b> cannot improve intersection traffic operation but will worsen the traffic operation when traffic volume is less than the surveyed situation volume...|$|R

40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of the present study}} is to {{investigate}} if physical attributes in <b>waiting</b> <b>areas</b> of airports can influence their perceived restorativeness for travelers. This study employed a pre-survey to select the physical attributes that may have an impact on perceived restorativeness of airports and then applied an experiment as research method to obtain quantitative data. The present study used 203 students of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology as participants. Participants were required to rate the stimulus material of <b>waiting</b> <b>areas</b> in airports with different physical characteristics in the questionnaire. By comparing participants' mean scores, this study compares perceived restorativeness of <b>waiting</b> <b>areas</b> in airports with different physical settings and get results about the influence of different physical attributes. The results suggest that there are four physical attributes (windows, crowding, seats and plant settings) having an impact on tourists’ perceived restorativeness in <b>waiting</b> <b>areas</b> of airports. Perceived restorativeness of the <b>waiting</b> <b>area</b> in airports can be increased when the <b>waiting</b> <b>areas</b> in airports have windows, when they have abundant seating, when they have less people in them and when they have plants. </p...|$|R
