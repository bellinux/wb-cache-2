As the [...] "definitive" [...] carrier based Seafire, the Mk 47 incorporated several refinements over earlier variants. After the first four aircraft, with manually folded wings, the Mk 47 incorporated hydraulically powered wing folding, the outer wings folding upwards in one piece, without the folding wingtips of earlier marks. All Mk 47s adopted the Rotol contra-rotating propellers. The Mk 47 also featured a long supercharger air-duct, the intake of which started just behind the spinner and a modified curved windscreen, similar to that used on the Mk XVII. Other features unique to the Mk 47s were spring-loaded elevator tabs, a large <b>inertia</b> <b>weight</b> in the elevator control system and beading on the trailing edges of the elevators. These changes improved longitudinal stability, especially when the aircraft was fully loaded. The modified windscreen proved to be unpopular with pilots because of continual problems with misting and the thicker, repositioned frames obstructed visibility during deck landings. In spite of recommendations to change the windscreen back to a standard Spitfire 24 unit, this was never done. Performance tests showed that the Mk 47 was slightly slower than the Mk 46 in maximum and climbing speeds, mainly due to the long supercharger air intake, which was less efficient than the shorter type fitted to earlier Seafires. The Seafire 47 saw action with 800 Squadron on board [...] during the Malayan Emergency of 1949 and during the Korean War in 1950. However, in 1951 all Seafires were withdrawn from front-line service. In all 90 F Mk 47s and FR Mk 47s were built, all by Supermarine. VR971, the last of the 22,000 aircraft built under the Spitfire/Seafire program, left the production line at Supermarine on 28 January 1949.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In {{particle}} swarm optimization, the <b>inertia</b> <b>weight</b> is {{an important}} parameter for controlling its search capability. There have been intensive studies of the <b>inertia</b> <b>weight</b> in continuous optimization, but {{little attention has been}} paid to the binary case. This study comprehensively investigates the effect of the <b>inertia</b> <b>weight</b> on the performance of binary particle swarm optimization, from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. A mathematical model is proposed to analyze the behavior of binary particle swarm optimization, based on which several lemmas and theorems on the effect of the <b>inertia</b> <b>weight</b> are derived. Our research findings suggest that in the binary case, a smaller <b>inertia</b> <b>weight</b> enhances the exploration capability while a larger <b>inertia</b> <b>weight</b> encourages exploitation. Consequently, this paper proposes a new adaptive <b>inertia</b> <b>weight</b> scheme for binary particle swarm optimization. This scheme allows the search process to start first with exploration and gradually move towards exploitation by linearly increasing the <b>inertia</b> <b>weight.</b> The experimental results on 0 / 1 knapsack problems show that the binary particle swarm optimization with the new increasing <b>inertia</b> <b>weight</b> scheme performs significantly better than that with the conventional decreasing and constant <b>inertia</b> <b>weight</b> schemes.

40|$|Abstract Background Human balance during quiet {{standing}} {{is influenced}} by adding mass to the body with a backpack, with symmetrically-applied loads to the trunk, or with obesity. Adding mass to the body increases both the <b>weight</b> and <b>inertia</b> of the body, which theoretically could provide counteracting effects on body dynamics and balance. Understanding the independent effects of adding <b>weight</b> and <b>inertia</b> on balance may provide additional insight into human balance {{that could lead to}} novel advancements in balance training and rehabilitation. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} was to investigate the independent effects of adding <b>weight</b> and <b>inertia</b> on balance during quiet standing. Methods Sixteen normal-weight young adult participants stood as still as possible on a custom-built backboard apparatus under four experimental conditions: baseline, added <b>inertia</b> only, added <b>weight</b> only, and added <b>inertia</b> and <b>weight.</b> Results Adding <b>inertia</b> by itself had no measurable effect on center of pressure movement or backboard movement. Adding weight by itself increased center of pressure movement (indicated greater effort by the postural control system to stand as still as possible) and backboard movement (indicating a poorer ability of the body to stand as still as possible). Adding <b>inertia</b> and <b>weight</b> at the same time increased center of pressure movement but did not increase backboard movement compared to the baseline condition. Conclusions Adding <b>inertia</b> and adding <b>weight</b> had different effects on balance. Adding inertia by itself had no effect on balance. Adding weight by itself had a negative effect on balance. When adding <b>inertia</b> and <b>weight</b> at the same time, the added inertia appeared to lessen (but did not eliminate) the negative effect of adding weight on balance. These results improve our fundamental understanding of how added mass influences human balance. </p...|$|R
