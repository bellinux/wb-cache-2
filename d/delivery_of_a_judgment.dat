2500|$|The High Court makes itself {{generally}} {{available to the}} public through its own website. Judgment Alerts, available on the Court's website and by email with free subscription, provide subscribers with notice <b>of</b> upcoming <b>judgments</b> (normally <b>a</b> week beforehand) and, almost immediately after the <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> major <b>judgment,</b> with <b>a</b> brief summary <b>of</b> it (normally not more than one page). [...] All of the Court's judgments, as well as transcripts of its hearings since 2009 and other materials, are made available, free of charge, through the Australasian Legal Information Institute. The Court has recently established on its website an [...] "eresources" [...] page, containing for each case its name, keywords, mentions of relevant legislation and a link to the full judgment; [...] these links go to the original text from 2000 onward, scanned texts from 1948 to 1999 and facsimiles from the Commonwealth Law Reports for their first 100 volumes (1903 to 1959); [...] there are also facsimiles of some unreported judgments (1906-2002). [...] Since October 2013, audio-visual recordings of full-court hearings held in Canberra have been available on its website.|$|R

Rescission <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>judgment</b> is in issue not only in cases in which default judgment has been granted, but also in cases in which application is made for the rescission <b>of</b> <b>a</b> summary <b>judgment,</b> {{as well as in}} cases in which judgment has been granted in the absence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> defendant in terms of rule 60(3), where the defendant has not supplied further particulars requested of him.|$|R

Therefore, Kant cannot define truth as the {{correspondence}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>judgment</b> with <b>an</b> actual object. In this paper, I discuss the relations between Kant's notions of truth, object, and actuality. I argue that Kant's notion of actual object does not presuppose the notion of truth.

5000|$|Per incuriam, {{literally}} {{translated as}} [...] "through lack of care", refers to <b>a</b> <b>judgment</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> court {{which has been}} decided without reference to a statutory provision or earlier judgment {{which would have been}} relevant. The significance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>judgment</b> having been decided per incuriam {{is that it does not}} then have to be followed as precedent by a lower court. Ordinarily, in the common law, the rationes <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>judgment</b> must be followed thereafter by lower courts hearing similar cases. A lower court is free, however, to depart from <b>an</b> earlier <b>judgment</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> superior court where that earlier judgment was decided per incuriam.|$|R
40|$|Temporality {{is one of}} {{the tools}} {{enabling}} courts to deal with the consequences <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>judgment.</b> The present paper focuses on the special case of temporality in judicial review type judgments, ie the doctrine of temporal limitation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>judgment</b> by the Court of Justice of the EU in the procedure <b>of</b> <b>a</b> preliminary ruling. Although the primary goal of the doctrine was to avoid harsh consequences in cases determined by the conventional retroactive application <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>judgment,</b> the doctrine has created its own costs. The paper is an attempt to discuss the arguments of the Court from the perspective <b>of</b> <b>a</b> consequences-based argumentation regarding the temporal effects <b>of</b> <b>a</b> preliminary ruling. The analysis provided is merely the positive type of insights regarding the current argumentation of the Court which aims to extend the view on the social impact driven argumentation of the Court...|$|R
