5|$|In March 1972, the Mount Saint Peter Parish Council {{was first}} elected. The group {{consists}} of eighteen elected members and it advises and assists the pastor in important decisions concerning {{the affairs of}} the church. It prides itself on having the ability to guide the parish in its mission of following Christ. The main purpose of the council <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> pastor an insight into what the parish community thinks and how it feels about different issues. All of the parish activities must go through the four standing committees, which are the Liturgy, Education, Apostolic Work, and Temporalities.|$|E
5|$|The Stockport County Supporters Co-Operative (Formerly The Stockport County Supporters Trust) is {{the other}} active supporters' group {{where there is a}} £12 annual {{membership}} fee. The Supporters Co-Operative's aim <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> club's greatest asset – the fans – a voice; as well as a stake in the football club through its Guardian Account. The Supporters Co-Op also assists in running the Stockport County Appearance Number (SCAN) Scheme where every player who has played a senior professional game is recognised with a unique framed certificate and a number which show their position in the list of players to make their debut for the club.|$|E

The Architectural styles of the building ranges from the lower levels' Edwardian style to the top levels' Cape Dutch design with shutters on the windows. The windows from bottom to top are elongated and become shorter towards the top floor. This <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> illusion of height.|$|E

25|$|Tetanus can be {{prevented}} by vaccination with tetanus toxoid. The CDC recommends that adults receive a booster vaccine every ten years, and standard care practice in many places <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> booster to any patient with a puncture wound who is uncertain of {{when he or she}} was last vaccinated, or if he or she has had fewer than three lifetime doses of the vaccine. The booster may not prevent a potentially fatal case of tetanus from the current wound, however, as it can take up to two weeks for tetanus antibodies to form.|$|E
25|$|The Gray Uniform {{has been}} seen in photos {{as early as the}} 1960s. The purpose of the Gray Uniform <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> band staff an idea of what the band looks like in {{formations}} while dressed alike. This allows for last minute modifications to drill without making the band wear full uniform. The Gray Uniform is nearly identical in use and wear as military Physical Training uniforms. The Gray Uniform consists of a gray T-shirt and gray shorts. The band hat with plume is worn with this uniform.|$|E
25|$|Prisoners {{are allowed}} to take online courses from the Open University of Israel, and to {{complete}} academic degrees. This is not a vested right but a benefit, contingent on good behavior, with prison authorities paying their university tuition. The courses are in the fields of: humanities, sociology, economics, management, psychology and political-science. The intention <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> prisoners the tools to deal with life outside, so that {{upon release from prison}} they will have the appropriate education to help them obtain jobs, and prevent them from returning to a life of crime.|$|E

25|$|There {{has also}} been a lot of {{criticism}} of the methodology used to teach Swedish and the lack of competence in many of the teachers. This has contributed to students' lack of motivation to study Swedish, and many may not learn to speak the language beyond a very basic level. Some students argue that they will never need Swedish as its utility in the Finnish job market is limited to a few fields. Moreover, the rationale of mandatory tuition in Swedish and other subjects <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> students more of a general knowledge base, and not train them for a specific field.|$|E
25|$|Three U.S. flag {{insignia}} are authorized {{for wear}} with the ACU: full-color, full-color IR, and subdued IR. The U.S. flag insignia (full-color or subdued) is worn {{on the right}} shoulder pocket flap of the ACU coat. The subdued version is only worn as directed under tactical or field conditions. On the right shoulder of the ACU, the U.S. flag is depicted with the union (stars) to the viewer's right, {{instead of the usual}} left (flag's own right); this <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> impression of the flag moving forward with the wearer. Subdued shoulder sleeve insignia are always worn.|$|E
25|$|It is {{recommended}} that women with vasa previa should deliver through elective cesarean prior to rupture of the membranes. Given the timing of membrane rupture is difficult to predict, elective cesarean delivery at 35–36 weeks {{is recommended}}. This gestational age gives a reasonable balance between {{the risk of death}} and that of prematurity. Several authorities have recommended hospital admission about 32 weeks. This <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> patient proximity to the operating room for emergency delivery should the membranes rupture. Because these patients are at risk for preterm delivery, it {{is recommended that}} steroids should be given to promote fetal lung maturation. When bleeding occurs, the patient goes into labor, or if the membranes rupture, immediate treatment with an emergency caesarean delivery is usually indicated.|$|E

25|$|The {{most common}} viticultural hazards in the Muscadet region is {{winter and spring}} time frost and threat of mildew near harvest. The Melon de Bourgogne has adapted well to these {{condition}} being very frost resistant and capable of ripening early. Harvest usually takes place in mid to late September {{but in recent years}} producers have been experimented with harvesting the grapes several days to a couple weeks later. The traditional method is to harvest early in order to maintain acidity that is a key characteristic of Muscadet wine. The trend to pick later, and risk the threat of rains and mildew rot, <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> grapes more time to develop sugars and riper phenols that can impart more fruit notes and complexity to the wine. However, these grapes that are picked later will usually experience a dramatic drop in acidity.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the end of}} the 2003 season, Eala {{proposed}} a new format to the PBA Board of Governors. While Eala's plan was to have a one conference season for the league, instead of the usual three conference format, the Board decided to have two conferences in a season. The board also approved Eala's plan to move the league calendar from February to December to October to July, which took effect in 2004. One of the reason's for the move is for the PBA to take an active part {{in the formation of the}} national team in future international competitions. As part of the preparation for the new format, the league held a transitional conference known as the Fiesta Conference, which was held from February 22, 2004 until July 7, which was won by crowd-favorite Barangay Ginebra Kings, which drew a crowd of over 10,000 in the four games played at the Araneta Coliseum. The league's format during the said conference <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> top two teams after the classification phase an outright quarterfinals berth, while the bottom eight will compete in a wildcard phase, with the winners facing off in the round robin quarterfinals format, joining two foreign teams, the University of British Columbia and a US-led squad. However, the format was criticized after the two foreign teams showed up losing all of their games in the quarterfinals. Aside from this, San Miguel, who had 16-2 record, was eliminated from the tournament.|$|E
25|$|In 1995 {{the first}} Faroese patient with {{systemic}} primary carnitine deficiency (SPCD) was diagnosed. Later other patients were found, {{but nothing was}} done {{to find out if}} the illness was common or if something should be done about it. Not until 2008 when a young woman died just a few days after being diagnosed with SPCD (in the Faroes, the illness is named CTD), actions were finally taken by the Faroese health authorities. The young woman had not been treated, and this caused a big discussion about how to prevent this from happening again. Shortly after, all Faroese people in the Faroes were invited to take a blood sample for a small cost and get it screened for SPCD. Several persons with the illness were found and got treatment immediately. It is now known that several Faroese people have died a sudden death at a young age because of this illness. Around one third of the Faroese population has been screened for SPCD (with a blood sample), and scientists think that at least one of every 1000 inhabitants of the Faroes have the illness. There have also been found elderly people who have survived the illness without treatment. The treatment <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> patients carnitine supplement. The German physician and scientist Ulrike Steurwald, who has done research in the Faroe Islands for several years, has argued that the Faroese diet of red meat, like sheep meat and whale meat which contain high amounts of carnitine, may have protected many Faroese people from a sudden death at a young age from SPCD. The whale meat contains nutritions like carnitine, taurine and selenium. The concentration of selenium in raw fresh cod fillet and raw fresh pilot whale meat is 28µg/100g and 185µg/100g. The whale's blubber is rich in vitamin D, which around half of the elderly population and many amongst the younger generations in the Faroe Islands are lacking. Reasons for this can be changes from traditional food to pizza, chicken, etc. The fat of sea mammals provide excellent sources of vitamins A, D and E.|$|E

500|$|Skeptics {{argue that}} the current gambit of {{contemporary}} conspiracy theorists who use The Protocols is to claim that they [...] "really" [...] come from some group other than the Jews, such as fallen angels or alien invaders. Although {{it is hard to}} determine whether the conspiracy-minded actually believe this or are simply trying to sanitize a discredited text, skeptics argue that it does not make much difference, since they leave the actual, antisemitic text unchanged. The result <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>The</b> Protocols credibility and circulation.|$|E
500|$|The 2011 {{revision}} of the C++ Standard removed the weasel words requiring that allocators of a given type always compare equal and use normal pointers. [...] These changes make stateful allocators much more useful and allow allocators to manage out-of-process shared memory. The current purpose of allocators <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> programmer control over memory allocation within containers, rather than to adapt the address model of the underlying hardware. [...] In fact, the revised standard eliminated the ability of allocators to represent extensions to the C++ address model, formally (and deliberately) eliminating their original purpose.|$|E
500|$|As such, simply {{giving the}} {{trustees}} this power {{was not enough}} to defeat uncertainties. If, however, the testator [...] "had sufficiently defined" [...] the way in which trustees should exercise their judgement, it would be valid. The final device <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> trustees the power to give trust property to [...] "anyone in the world" [...] or to [...] "anyone whom the trustees consider appropriate". This has two problems; firstly, the class could be too broad to be administratively workable, and second, the courts are unable to judge if the power has been exercised appropriately. However, in Re Hay's Settlement Trust, Megarry V-C held that, exercised properly, this sort of agreement could be administratively workable, and would not be immediately void. But if the gift were given to a wide class of people for a charitable purpose, it will be valid.|$|E

500|$|He {{explained}} [...] "the {{goal is to}} try to make it {{an engaging}} movie where you get some of the psychology and kind of bring a freshness but also keep the classic nature of Alice." [...] On prior versions, Burton said [...] "It was always a girl wandering around from one crazy character to another, and I never really felt any real emotional connection." [...] His goal with the new film <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> story [...] "some framework of emotional grounding" [...] and [...] "to try and make Alice feel more like a story as opposed to a series of events." [...] Burton focused on the poem [...] "Jabberwocky" [...] as part of his structure, and refers to the described creature by the name of the poem rather than by the name [...] "Jabberwock" [...] used in the poem. Burton also stated that he does not see his version as either a sequel to any existing Alice film nor as a [...] "re-imagining". However, the idea of the climax of the story being Alice's battle with the Queen's champion, the Jabberwocky, was first added in the video game American McGee's Alice, and the landscape, tower, weapons and appearance of Alice in those scenes of the film are very reminiscent of the same scenes in the game.|$|E
500|$|Originally titled N.3.R.D, {{the title}} was changed to Seeing Sounds. Williams {{explained}} that {{the title was}} based on synesthesia, a neurological phenomenon the band learned of while watching the Discovery Channel. They were inspired to create music that could be conceived as a live show. He {{was surprised to learn}} not everyone experienced while listening to music. He described synesthesia as the outcome when [...] "one sense gets more information than what's intended", stimulated by sensory deprivation. Haley further elaborated, saying that it is a mixture of senses that causes a person to experience colorful hearing and auditory smell. When the band created the album, it was the music they envisioned and decided the appropriate title for the album, Seeing Sounds. Williams pointed out that the lyrics were also inspired by synesthesia. He said that his fans want to [...] "rock out" [...] and be taken on an [...] "emotional roller coaster", {{and the only way to}} do that <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> fans some records they could blast out on their speakers. The European-influenced music is layered and textured with many music modalities, differing from their past club-oriented albums. Hugo called the album a [...] "big album of LSD, sonic drug". The band described the album of being an exercise in creative cohesion, band unity and a renewed purpose for themselves.|$|E
