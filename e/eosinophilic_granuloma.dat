40|$|Abstract. Eosinophilic gastroenteritis, focal or diffuse with eosinophilic infiltrations of {{the stomach}} or in-testine, has been {{described}} in human beings, cats, dogs, and horses. In this paper, we describe infiltration of the gastrointestinal tract with eosinophils accompanied by a circulating eosinophilia in six ferrets (Mustela putorius furoi. Clinical signs included chronic weight loss, anorexia, and diarrhea. The small intestines from five ferrets had diffuse infiltrates of eosinophils. This resulted in focal or multifocal loss of the muscular tunic in three ferrets. Two of these ferrets also had <b>eosinophilic</b> gastritis. <b>Eosinophilic</b> <b>granulomas</b> with Splendore-Hoeppli material were present in mesenteric lymph nodes in four ferrets. Two ferrets had multiple organ involvement; one had <b>eosinophilic</b> <b>granulomas</b> in the liver, mesentery, and choroid plexus as well as moderate parapancreatic segmental arteritis with infiltration of eosinophils and mural thrombosis.

40|$|Introduction: Various eosinophilic lesions {{have been}} {{described}} in horses. Multisystemic eosinophilic epitheliotropic disease (MEED) characterized by <b>eosinophilic</b> <b>granulomas</b> in various organs represents the most diffuse manifestation. In the present study we describe the gross and microscopical lesions of idiopathic eosinophilic pneumonia and vasculitis in 11 horses without systemic involvement. Materials and Methods: During a 2 -year period (2010 – 2011), lungs from 88 horses with gross signs of pulmonary disease were collected at a slaughterhouse. Lung sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin, Giemsa and periodic acid–Schiff. Results: In 11 horses, lungs were enlarged, pale pink and collapsed, with multifocal to coalescing, white–red, 0. 4 – 4. 0 cm diameter nodules distributed throughout the parenchyma. Histologically, the lesions ranged from severe eosinophilic bronchointerstitial pneumonia to severe eosinophilic lobular bronchopneumonia associated with eosinophilic necrotizing vasculitis affecting small to medium sized vessels. Mild interstitial fibrosis was also present. The {{other part of the}} parenchyma appeared emphysematous. There was no histological evidence of parasites within these lesions. Conclusions: Eosinophilic pneumonia and vasculitis without intralesional parasites are rarely described in horses. Histological findings do not resemble the typical <b>eosinophilic</b> <b>granulomas</b> observed in lungs of horses with MEED, but are similar to the findings in idiopathic chronic eosinophilic pneumonia of man and of Churg–Strauss syndrome of man...|$|R

40|$|Canine {{pulmonary}} eosinophilic granulomatosis {{is a rare}} inflammatory {{pulmonary disease}} characterized by formation of <b>eosinophilic</b> <b>granulomas</b> that tend to obliterate the normal pulmonary architecture. The purpose of this retrospective study was to describe the CT characteristics of confirmed idiopathic pulmonary eosinophilic granulomatosis {{in a group of}} dogs. Five dogs met inclusion criteria. All patients were young adult dogs of variable breeds. No dog had concurrent occult heartworm disease. Computed tomographic characteristics most commonly included pulmonary masses and nodules of variable size, and lesions were most commonly located in the caudal lung lobes. Four dogs had large pulmonary masses with or without additional nodules and one dog had nodular lesions disseminated throughout the entire lung parenchyma. All large <b>eosinophilic</b> <b>granulomas</b> were smoothly margined, heterogeneous pulmonary masses displaying heterogeneous contrast enhancement. A honeycomb-like enhancement pattern was observed in all but one mass and consisted of multiple hyperattenuating rims delineating central hypoattenuating areas, suggestive of bronchiectatic lung with peripheral enhancing airway walls and fluid-filled, necrotic bronchial lumen. One dog had evidence of tracheobronchial lymphadenopathy. Findings indicated that canine eosinophilic pulmonary granulomatosis should be included as a differential diagnosis for dogs with CT characteristics of multiple pulmonary masses and/or nodules in caudal lung lobes, and a honeycomb-like enhancement pattern in masses after intravenous administration of iodinated contrast medium. © 2013 American College of Veterinary Radiology...|$|R

40|$|Human {{cases of}} gastric {{anisakiasis}} {{caused by the}} zoonotic parasite Anisakis pegreffii are increasing in Italy. The disease is caused by ingestion of larval nematodes in lightly cooked or raw seafood. Because symptoms are vague and serodiagnosis is difficult, the disease is often misdiagnosed and cases are understimated. Human anisakiasis is a seafoodborne parasitic zoonosis caused by larval nematodes of the genus Anisakis. Humans are accidental hosts of the nematodes; they become infected by consuming raw or undercooked seafoods that harbor the nematode larvae in their flesh and muscle (1). The larvae do not further develop in humans; however, they can penetrate the gastrointestinal tract and form <b>eosinophilic</b> <b>granulomas,</b> often with pathologic consequences. There is a growing awareness that these parasites generate potentially life-threatening allergic reactions (2) when the live parasite attempts to penetrate the gastric mucosa. These reactions, termed gastroallergic anisakiasis, are characterized by urticaria, occurring generally on the arms and abdomen, and by angioedema or anaphylaxis (3) ...|$|R
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the secretory function of cell suspensions from bone <b>eosinophilic</b> <b>granulomas</b> surgically collected in two patients with histiocytosis X.

Such highly purified cell preparations were found to secrete IL- 1 and PGE 2 spontaneously in culture. Stimulation with endotoxins and treatment with interferon gamma (IFN gamma) revealed an intense IL- 1 secretory function of histiocytosis X cells.

40|$|Abstract Background Canine leishmaniosis (CanL) {{caused by}} Leishmania infantum is an endemic {{zoonosis}} in southern European countries. Infected dogs can present rare or atypical {{forms of the}} disease and diagnosis can be challenging. The present report describes a case of tongue nodules in a 3 -year-old neutered female Labrador Retriever dog with leishmaniosis. Findings A fine needle aspiration of the lingual nodules revealed amastigote forms of Leishmania inside macrophages. Differential diagnosis ruled out neoplasia, calcinosis circumscripta, solar glossitis, vasculitis, amyloidosis, <b>eosinophilic</b> <b>granulomas,</b> chemical and electrical burns, uremic glossitis and autoimmune diseases. Combined therapy with antimoniate meglumine and allopurinol for 30 [*]days resulted in the normalization of hematological and biochemical parameters. Two months after diagnosis and the beginning of treatment, a mild inflammatory infiltrate was observed by histopathology, but an anti- Leishmania immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT) was negative as well as a PCR on both tongue lesions and a bone marrow aspirate. Seven months after diagnosis, the dog’s general condition appeared good, there were no tongue lesions and a new IFAT was negative. Fifteen months after diagnosis this clinically favourable outcome continued. Conclusions The dog could have suffered a relapsing episode of CanL, but a new systemic or local infection cannot be excluded. Regular clinical re-evaluation should be maintained, as a future relapse can potentially occur. In conclusion, CanL should be considered in the differential diagnosis of nodular glossitis in dogs. </p...|$|R
