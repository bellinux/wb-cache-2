5|$|Barea {{began the}} season with 21 points and 5 assists against the Sacramento Kings on November 2, 2012. However, in his fourth game, he sprained <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>foot,</b> which caused him to miss the next five games.

5|$|During childhood, Goebbels {{suffered}} from ill health, {{which included a}} long bout of inflammation of the lungs. He had a deformed right foot that turned inwards, due to a congenital deformity. It was thicker and shorter than <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>foot.</b> He underwent a failed operation to correct it just prior to starting grammar school. Goebbels wore a metal brace and special shoe because of his shortened leg, and walked with a limp. He was rejected for military service in World War I due to his deformity.|$|E
5|$|In July 2009, Yao {{discussed}} the injury with his doctors, and the Rockets {{applied for a}} disabled player exception, {{an exception to the}} NBA Salary Cap which grants the injured player's team money to sign a free agent. The Rockets were granted the exception, and used approximately $5.7million on free agent Trevor Ariza. After weeks of consulting, it was decided that Yao would undergo surgery in order to repair the broken bone in <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>foot.</b> He did not play the entire 2009–10 season.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1990s, Bradbury accidentally hit his leg while {{chopping}} firewood. Gangrene set in, and {{his right}} leg was amputated below the knee. It spread to his left leg, and part of <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>foot</b> was amputated, leaving him in a wheelchair. The disease eventually proved fatal, and he died on 20 August 1997. He was {{survived by his wife}} Lois, who died in January 1998, and his three sons. A funeral service was held in Los Alamos, and he was buried at Guaje Pines Cemetery in Los Alamos.|$|E

5|$|Milne was {{naturally}} right-footed, though trained {{hard with}} <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>foot</b> {{as a boy}} to become equally skilled with both feet. Former Dundee United teammate Paul Hegarty stated that Milne possessed great pace, as well as bravery, a good work ethic, {{and an ability to}} score important goals. Another former Dundee United teammate, Davie Dodds, said that Milne was as good a finisher as any player in Scottish football during the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Next, Iniesta sent a {{pass through}} the inside-left channel to Larsson whose one touch, right foot lay-off quickly {{released}} Eto to equalise for Barcelona. Four minutes later Belletti passed through the inside-right channel to Larsson. After controlling the ball, Larsson made a left footed return pass to Belletti. Belletti ran onto control the ball with <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>foot.</b> He then used his right to shoot through Almunia's legs to score at the near post. This was Larsson's second assist for Barcelona since he joined the game.|$|E
5|$|Rathbone {{jumped from}} his seat and {{struggled}} with Booth, who dropped the pistol and drew a knife, then stabbed Rathbone in the left forearm.

5|$|Robben {{was born}} in Bedum, a {{satellite}} town of Groningen, in the northeastern Netherlands. He took to football from an early age, becoming an adherent of the Coerver Method. Robben's skill in ball control and technical footwork made him a valuable player, and he was quickly signed by regional club FC Groningen. Here, he developed his distinctive style of cutting inside from the right onto <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>foot</b> to score some quite spectacular goals.|$|E
5|$|The {{appointment}} of Arsène Wenger as Arsenal manager in September 1996 marked {{a turning point}} in Bergkamp's career. Wenger, who had moderate success coaching in France and Japan, recognised Bergkamp's talent and wanted to use him as a fulcrum of the team's forward play. Both were advocates of a continental style of attacking football, and Wenger's decision to impose a strict fitness and health regimen pleased Bergkamp. Despite making fewer appearances in the 1996–97 season, Bergkamp was more influential in the first team, creating 13 assists. Against Tottenham Hotspur in November 1996, he set up an 88th-minute winner for captain Tony Adams to volley in using <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>foot.</b> He then scored in injury time, controlling a high ball with <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>foot</b> and evading his marker Stephen Carr in a tight area to set up his shot. Bergkamp received his first red card against Sunderland in January 1997 for a high tackle on midfielder Paul Bracewell in the 26th minute. Arsenal went on to lose the match 1–0, but a run of 8 wins in their final 16 matches gave the club a third-place finish, missing out on a spot in the UEFA Champions League via goal difference.|$|E
5|$|When Ruffing was 15 years old, he {{suffered}} an {{accident in the}} mine, where <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>foot</b> was crushed between two cars. Though the doctor was able to save his foot, Red lost four toes. He was supposed to begin his professional baseball career in the Kentucky–Illinois–Tennessee League that year, but he found himself unable to run {{as fast as he}} previously could. Doc Bennett, the manager of a nearby semi-professional team, suggested that Ruffing should try to continue pursuing a baseball career by becoming a pitcher.|$|E
50|$|When Selnæs joined Rosenborg in 2009, he was {{earmarked}} for <b>his</b> accurate <b>left</b> <b>foot</b> and good {{knowledge of the}} game, which allowed him to develop as a defensive midfielder.|$|R
50|$|Storm Cat {{was a dark}} {{bay horse}} with a white star and stripe on his {{forehead}} and white socks on <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>feet.</b> He was sired by Storm Bird, a son of Northern Dancer. His dam was Terlingua, an outstanding sprinter who was sired by Secretariat. William T. Young of Overbrook Farm purchased Terlingua in partnership with Bill Lockridge, who arranged the mating with Storm Bird. Lockridge then sold his share of Terlingua to Young, who thus became Storm Cat's breeder of record.|$|R
50|$|Danoli was a {{bay horse}} {{with a small}} white star and a white sock on <b>his</b> rear <b>left</b> <b>foot.</b> He was sired by the {{successful}} National Hunt stallion The Parson out of the mare Blaze Gold.|$|R
5|$|As {{a result}} of a {{defensive}} injury crisis at the club, Carrick started the 2012–13 season as a makeshift centre-back. His inexperience in the role was exploited by Everton in the season opener, as Marouane Fellaini beat him to a corner kick to score the only goal of the game. He continued in the role for the next match against Fulham. He scored his first goal of the season in a 1–0 Champions League victory against Galatasaray, after series of ball movement leading to Michael Carrick rounding the goalkeeper to score with <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>foot.</b> On 24 November 2012, Carrick was left out the squad that defeated QPR 3–1, ending his run of 33 consecutive league starts.|$|E
5|$|At the 2009 World Championships, Lysacek placed {{second in}} the short program. He then won the free skating segment to win the {{competition}} overall, becoming the first American man since Todd Eldredge in 1996 to win the World title. His placement, combined with that of Brandon Mroz, qualified the United States for three entries in the men's event at the 2010 Winter Olympics. At the World Championships, Lysacek competed with a stress fracture in <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>foot,</b> which prevented him from trying a quadruple jump at the competition. During the off-season, Lysacek took two months off from skating to give the injury time to heal. He was called the frontrunner for the 2010 Olympic gold by some journalists.|$|E
5|$|Barnes {{gripped the}} bat very {{low on the}} handle and bent over so far in his stance that the {{knuckles}} {{of his right hand}} were level with his knees. He stood with his heels almost together and the toes of <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>foot</b> pointing toward extra cover, which left him open-chested when facing the bowler. A noticeable flourish in his backlift enabled him to follow the swinging delivery and play it late if necessary. His first movement was back and across the crease to cover the stumps from the view of the bowler, putting him in position to play the hook, leg glance, sweep and his favourite square cut shot.|$|E

5|$|For the 2008–09 season, the Rockets signed forward Ron Artest. While McGrady {{wound up}} playing {{only half the}} games before {{enduring}} a season-ending microfracture surgery, the Rockets ended the season 53–29, enough for the Western Conference's fifth seed. During the playoffs, the Rockets beat the Portland Trail Blazers four games to two, winning their first round since 1997. During the series, Dikembe Mutombo injured his knee, which forced him to retire after 18 seasons in the NBA. However, the second round against the Lakers had the Rockets losing 4-3 and Yao Ming suffering yet another season-ending injury, this time a hairline fracture in <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>foot.</b>|$|E
5|$|He {{continued}} rehabilitating his calf in the off-season, {{after the}} Canucks failed {{to qualify for}} the playoffs, admitting that his leg had not fully recovered upon his early return. However, injury troubles continued early in 2008–09. On November 4, he was re-injured after blocking a puck off his skate against the Nashville Predators. Bieksa played through the injury for several games before learning that he had suffered a bone fracture in <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>foot.</b> He returned to the line-up after missing seven games. Despite missing ten games in total, Bieksa established an impressive career-high 32 assists along with 11 goals for 43 points, first among team defencemen.|$|E
5|$|Peake again painted Henry {{outdoors}} in about 1610. In this portrait, {{now at the}} Royal Palace of Turin, the prince looks hardly older than in the 1603 double portrait; but <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>foot</b> rests on a shield bearing the three-feathers device of the Prince of Wales, a title he did not hold until 1610. Henry is portrayed {{as a young man}} of action, about to draw a jewel-encrusted sword from its scabbard. The portrait was almost certainly sent to Savoy in connection with a marriage proposed in January 1611 between Henry and the Infanta Maria, daughter of Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy.|$|E
50|$|He mainly plays across half-forward or centre half-forward, but {{can also}} play at centre half-back and full forward. He {{regularly}} has shots on goal from outside 60-metres with <b>his</b> booming <b>left</b> <b>foot</b> and rarely handballs, averaging less than 3 handballs a match.|$|R
