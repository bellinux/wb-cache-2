50|$|A primary <b>hub</b> is {{the main}} <b>hub</b> for an airline.

50|$|These {{concepts}} {{were made}} {{because of the}} nature of <b>hubs</b> in a network. <b>Hubs</b> are nodes which have lots of links. If we see one link in the <b>hub,</b> there is no difference between the <b>hubs,</b> however, some differences are exited between those nodes; some <b>hubs</b> tend to link to the other nodes and other <b>hubs</b> avoid connecting to the other nodes. We say a <b>hub</b> is assortative when it tends to connect to the other <b>hubs.</b> A dissortative <b>hub</b> avoids connecting to other <b>hubs.</b> If some nodes have some connections with the expected random probabilities, the <b>hubs</b> are neutral. There are three methods to quantify degree correlations.|$|R

50|$|In {{local area}} {{networks}} (LANs) and metropolitan area networks (MANs), multiple access methods enable bus networks, ring networks, <b>hubbed</b> networks, wireless networks and half duplex point-to-point communication, {{but are not}} required in full duplex point-to-point serial lines between network switches and routers, or in switched networks (logical star topology). The most common multiple access method is CSMA/CD, which is used in Ethernet. Although today's Ethernet installations typically are switched, CSMA/CD is utilized anyway to achieve compatibility with hubs.|$|E
40|$|<b>Hub</b> {{networks}} play {{an important}} role in many transportation and telecommunications systems. This paper introduces a new model called the <b>hub</b> arc location model. Rather than locate discrete <b>hub</b> facilities, this model locates <b>hub</b> arcs, which have reduced unit flow costs. Four special cases of the general <b>hub</b> arc location model are examined in detail. We provide motivation for the new models, and present examples and optimal solutions, using data for U. S. air passenger traffic. Results are used to compare optimal costs, <b>hub</b> locations, and <b>hub</b> arc locations with corresponding <b>hub</b> median optimal solutions. The results reveal interesting spatial patterns and help identify promising cities and regions for <b>hubs.</b> A companion paper (Campbell et al. 2005) presents integer programming formulations and solution algorithms for the new <b>hub</b> arc problems. It also provides details and computation times for these solution algorithms. <b>hub</b> arc location, <b>hub</b> location, network design...|$|R

Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 138 - 150. he <b>hub</b> location problem {{deals with}} finding {{the location of}} <b>hub</b> facilities and allocating the demand nodes to these <b>hub</b> facilities so as to effectively route the demand between origin–destination pairs. <b>Hub</b> location problems arise in various application settings in telecommunication and transportation. In the extensive literature on the <b>hub</b> location problem, it has widely been assumed that the subgraph induced by the <b>hub</b> nodes is complete. Throughout this thesis we relax the complete <b>hub</b> network assumption in <b>hub</b> location problems and focus on designing <b>hub</b> networks that are not necessarily complete. We approach to <b>hub</b> location problems from a network design perspective. In addition to the location and allocation decisions, we also study the decision on how the <b>hub</b> network must be designed. We focus on the single allocation version of the problems where each demand center is allocated to a single <b>hub</b> node. We start with introducing the 3 -stop <b>hub</b> covering network design problem. In this problem, we aim to design <b>hub</b> networks so that all origin– destination pairs receive service by visiting at most three <b>hubs</b> on a route. Then, we include <b>hub</b> network design decisions in the classical <b>hub</b> location problems introduced in the literature. We introduce the single allocation incomplete p-hub median, <b>hub</b> location with fixed costs, <b>hub</b> covering, and p-hub center network design problems to the literature. Lastly, we introduce the multimodal <b>hub</b> location and <b>hub</b> network design problem. We include {{the possibility of using}} different <b>hub</b> links, and allow for different transportation modes between <b>hubs,</b> and for different types of service time promises between origin–destination pairs, while designing the <b>hub</b> network in the multimodal problem. In this problem, we jointly consider transportation costs and travel times, which are studied separately in <b>hub</b> location problems presented in the literature. Computational analyses with all of the proposed models are presented on the various instances of the CAB data set and on the Turkish network. Alumur, Sibel AlevPh. D...|$|R

40|$|<b>Hub</b> {{location}} problems involve locating <b>hub</b> {{facilities and}} allocating demand nodes to <b>hubs</b> {{in order to}} provide service between origin-destination pairs. In this study, we focus on cargo applications of the <b>hub</b> location problem. Through observations from the Turkish cargo sector, we propose a new mathematical model for the <b>hub</b> location problem that relaxes the complete <b>hub</b> network assumption. Our model minimizes the cost of establishing <b>hubs</b> and <b>hub</b> links, while designing a network that services each origin-destination pair within a time bound. We formulate a single-allocation <b>hub</b> covering model that permits visiting at most three <b>hubs</b> on a route.

50|$|Midway used {{a variety}} of {{aircraft}} while <b>hubbed</b> at RDU. Initially, the fleet consisted only of the Fokker 100. Midway added Airbus A320-200s to fly longer routes, but these routes eventually became unprofitable and the 320s were sold. Midway then obtained a large number of Bombardier CRJ-200s for expansion. By late 2000, the 100s became expensive to maintain and operate, so Midway replaced them with Boeing 737-700s. In November 2000, Midway expanded nonstop service from RDU to San Jose (SJC) and Los Angeles (LAX).

Almost all the airlines that were <b>hubbed</b> at the old facility moved to the new airport, which was renamed Kansas City International Airport to more closely identify it with the city.

50|$|When making working dies, the Mint {{has found}} that by using a lower amount of {{pressure}} in the hubbing press, they can prolong {{the life of the}} hubs and dies used. In between each hubbing, however, the die being made must be subjected to an annealing procedure to soften the steel, making it easier to force the hub's image into the die. As the die is being cold forged in the hubbing press, the die's steel work hardens making the <b>hubbed</b> die harder and stronger than in its original state (an advantage over engraving the die). If, when the die is subjected to another hubbing, it is not lined up exactly with the hub, the result is a secondary image, or doubling. This is called die doubling, and results in such spectacular coins as the famous 1955 doubled die cent.|$|E
50|$|In data communication, a {{physical}} network node may either be data communication equipment (DCE) {{such as a}} modem, hub, bridge or switch; or data terminal equipment (DTE) such as a digital telephone handset, a printer or a host computer. If the network in question is a local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN), every LAN or WAN node (that are at least data link layer devices) must have a network address, typically one for each network interface controller it possesses. Examples are computers, packet switches, xDSL modems (with Ethernet interface) and wireless LAN access points. Note that a hub constitutes {{a physical}} network node, but does not constitute a LAN network node, since a <b>hubbed</b> network logically is a bus network.
