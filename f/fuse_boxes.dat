5|$|Though Arts and Crafts is {{specifically}} {{regarded as a}} movement within architecture, {{as opposed to a}} full-blown style, there are elements that are considered typical to buildings designed in the style. Examples include, dark, heavy woodwork and very simple ornamentation. The Oregon Public Library contains functional elements associated with that movement. Dark woodwork is found throughout the building, first in the stairwell to the gallery and its balusters and newel posts and then in the four-panel wooden interior door. The ceilings are coffered and have exposed wooden beams. Also located in the interior is a large 1909 wooden floor clock, a built-in storage cabinet, and two wooden <b>fuse</b> <b>boxes</b> that all evoke the Arts and Crafts movement.|$|E
25|$|The {{distribution}} board system used in Irish homes also differs substantially from {{those used in}} the UK and elsewhere. All {{distribution board}}s (<b>fuse</b> <b>boxes)</b> are required to have a 'main fuse' or 'main breaker' rated at the maximum permissible load for that installation. Typically, this is a 63 A fuse and a switch, or a Minized fuse isolator which accepts a Neozed fuse.|$|E
25|$|The {{framework}} {{is a logical}} structure for classifying and organizing the descriptive representations of an enterprise. It is significant to both {{the management of the}} enterprise, and the actors involved in the development of enterprise systems. While there is no order of priority for the columns of the Framework, the top-down order of the rows is significant to the alignment of business concepts and the actual physical enterprise. The level of detail in the Framework is a function of each cell (and not the rows). When done by IT the lower level of focus is on information technology, however it can apply equally to physical material (ball valves, piping, transformers, <b>fuse</b> <b>boxes</b> for example) and the associated physical processes, roles, locations etc. related to those items.|$|E

50|$|A {{common design}} of <b>fuse</b> <b>box</b> that was {{featured}} on homes built from 1940 to 1965 was the 60-amp <b>fuse</b> <b>box</b> that featured four plug fuses (i.e. Edison base) for branch circuits {{and one or}} more fuse blocks containing cartridge fuses for purposes such as major appliance circuits. After 1965, the more substantial 100 A panel with three-wire (230 V) service became common; a <b>fuse</b> <b>box</b> could have <b>fuse</b> blocks for the main shut-off and an electric range circuit plus a number of plug fuses (Edison base or Type S) for individual circuits.|$|R

25|$|One of {{the main}} {{features}} of The Things gameplay is the inclusion of multiple NPCs who join Blake at various points throughout the game. At any one time, the player can control up to four characters; Blake and three NPCs. There are three types of NPC in the game; engineers, soldiers and medics. Engineers can repair <b>fuse</b> <b>boxes,</b> which control locked doors, computers and save points. Soldiers have more health, and are better shots than engineers or medics. They are thus more suited to combat. Medics are capable of healing both Blake and any other injured NPCs, and carry unlimited health packs. The player can issue basic commands to each NPC, such as ordering them to follow Blake, ordering them remain where they are, ordering them to give Blake their weapon, and, {{in the case of}} engineers, ordering them to fix a fuse box.|$|E
500|$|At certain {{points in}} the game, the player {{will be joined by}} AI {{teammates}} that help Tapp. There are many {{points in the}} game where multiple paths are available that can be taken to avoid certain areas or uncover hidden items. Lighting plays a dynamic role in the game. While Tapp begins with a lighter, other light sources such as flashlights or camera flashes can be found later in the game. Minigames are {{a major part of the}} game. These include a searching game in which an X-ray view is used to avoid dangers like razors or syringes, and a game that involves grabbing a key before a [...] "Pain meter" [...] fills and wounds Tapp. Other puzzle minigames include powering <b>fuse</b> <b>boxes,</b> placing rotating gears in a box, and aligning steam valves. Doors rigged with shotguns attached to pulleys are in place all around the asylum. When the player encounters one of these doors, they must press a randomly assigned button before the pulley falls too far, or the gun will discharge. There are puzzles called [...] "environmental traps", in which Tapp must use different elements in the environment, use the in-game camera, or go to certain locations to accomplish a task.|$|E

2500|$|In the UK, older {{electrical}} consumer units (also called <b>fuse</b> <b>boxes)</b> are fitted {{either with}} semi-enclosed (rewirable) fuses [...] or cartridge fuses [...] (Fuse wire is commonly supplied to consumers as short lengths of 5A-, 15A- and 30A-rated wire wound {{on a piece}} of cardboard.) [...] Modern consumer units usually contain miniature circuit breakers (MCBs) instead of fuses, though cartridge fuses are sometimes still used, as in some applications MCBs are prone to nuisance tripping.|$|E
2500|$|Manhunt 2 has updates made to {{the stealth}} {{mechanics}} of the previous game. For example, players are now given more choices in terms of executing enemies. Aside from the three levels of execution per weapon, players can now use firearms for executions. Two further additions to the execution system are [...] "environmental executions" [...] whereby the player can use elements of the game world (such as manhole covers, telephones, <b>fuse</b> <b>boxes,</b> toilets, etc.) to eliminate opponents, and [...] "jump executions" [...] whereby players can attack enemies from above by leaping off a ledge. A scoring system based on how brutal the executions {{were excluded from the}} console versions in order to obtain an M rating from ESRB, while the PC version retained this feature.|$|E
2500|$|The fear system {{dictates}} how scared a given NPC is. There {{are three}} levels of fear; normal, scared and [...] "Crack-up". When an NPC enters [...] "Crack-up" [...] mode, Blake has only {{a limited amount of}} time to reduce their fear level, or the NPC will kill themselves, attack Blake and other NPCs, attack the environment, or die of a heart attack. Each NPC responds differently to different surroundings; for example, medics tend to scare easier than soldiers. Generally, however, fear increases when entering rooms covered in blood, entering dark locations, finding particularly disfigured corpses, being attacked by multiple enemies, and hearing enemies but not being able to see them. When an NPC is scared, it affects their performance; soldiers become less accurate, engineers take longer to repair <b>fuse</b> <b>boxes</b> and medics don't heal characters as quickly. Blake can reduce fear by giving NPCs adrenaline, topping up their ammo, moving away from particular locations, or successfully defeating enemies.|$|E

2500|$|In North America, fuses {{were used}} in {{buildings}} wired before 1960. These Edison base fuses would screw into a fuse socket similar to Edison-base incandescent lamps. [...] Ratings were 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 amperes. To prevent installation of fuses with an excessive current rating, later <b>fuse</b> <b>boxes</b> included rejection features in the fuse-holder socket, commonly known as Rejection Base (Type S fuses) which have smaller diameters that {{vary depending on the}} rating of the fuse. This means that fuses can only be replaced by the preset (Type S) fuse rating. This is a North American, tri-national standard (UL 4248-11; CAN/CSA-C22.2 NO. 4248.11-07 (R2012); and, NMX-J-009/4248/11-ANCE). Existing Edison fuse boards can easily be converted to only accept Rejection Base (Type S) fuses, by screwing-in a tamper-proof adapter. [...] This adapter screws into the existing Edison fuse holder, and has a smaller diameter threaded hole to accept the designated Type S rated fuse.|$|E
2500|$|Both games feature three 'levels' of execution, {{with each}} level {{progressively}} more violent and graphic than the last. Level 1 executions are quick {{and not very}} bloody, Level 2 are considerably more gory, and Level 3 are over-the-top blood-soaked murders. The player him/herself is entirely in control of which level they use; once the player has locked onto an enemy, the lock-on reticule changes color over time to indicate the level; white (level 1), yellow (level 2), and, finally, red (level 3). As an example, in the first game, if using the plastic bag, a level 1 kill involves the player simply using the bag to suffocate the enemy. A level 2 kill involves him placing the bag over the enemy's head and kneeing them repeatedly in the face. A level 3 kill sees him strangle the enemy and turn them around to punch them in the face, whilst the enemy struggles to free himself and gasps for air. Eventually, he snaps the enemy's neck. For the sequel, although the basic gameplay remained the same, numerous changes {{were made to the}} mechanics. For example, players were given more choices in terms of executing enemies. As well as the three levels of execution per weapon, plays could now use firearms for executions. Two further additions to the execution system were [...] "environmental executions" [...] whereby the play could use elements of the game world (such as manhole covers, telephones, <b>fuse</b> <b>boxes,</b> toilets etc) to eliminate opponents, and [...] "jump executions" [...] whereby players can attack enemies from above by leaping off a ledge.|$|E

50|$|<b>Fuse</b> <b>Boxes</b> {{normally}} use cartridge or rewirable fuses with {{no other}} protective device, and basic 4-ways boxes are very common. Some older boxes are made of brown-black bakelite, sometimes with a wooden base.
