In cases where data {{do not need to be}} archived, centrally processed, or federated, in-network data processing is becoming more common. For this purpose, various platforms like D RAGON, Innet, and CJF were proposed. However, these platforms assume that all nodes in the network are the same, i. e. the network is homogeneous. As Moore’s law still applies, nodes are becoming smaller, more powerful, and more energy efficient each year; which will continue for the foreseeable future. Therefore, we can expect that as sensor networks are extended and updated, hardware heterogeneity will soon be common in networks - the same trend as can be seen in cloud computing infrastructures. This heterogeneity introduces new challenges in terms of choosing an in-network <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> <b>node,</b> as not only its location, but also its capabilities, must be considered. This paper introduces a new methodology to tackle this challenge, comprising three new algorithms - Request, Traverse, and Mixed - for efficiently locating an in-network <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> <b>node,</b> while taking into account not only position within the network but also hardware capabilities. The roposed algorithms are evaluated against a naïve approach and achieve up to 90 % reduction in network traffic during long-term data processing, while spending a similar amount time in the discovery phase...|$|E

Drawing on new materialisms, infrastructure studies and classical theory of production and destruction of value in capitalism, the article outlines two modes in which this process happens, namely infrastructural convergence and decentralisation of the data centre. These modes arguably help data centre operators convert big data from a source of value online into a raw material that needs to flow in the network irrespective of meaning.
