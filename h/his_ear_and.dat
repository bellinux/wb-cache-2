5|$|He {{participated in}} the drive through France and was wounded in Aachen, Germany and was sent to England to recover. After he recovered, he rejoined the front lines reassigned to the 3rd Infantry Division and was given a {{battlefield}} commission to second lieutenant. By April 18, 1945, he was a first lieutenant in command of Company A, 15th Infantry Regiment, 3rd Infantry Division, 7th Army. On that day, he led his company in their advance through Nuremberg, Germany, and single-handedly engaged German forces several times. As his unit passed a city square, a German machine gun opened fire, causing several casualties. Daly rushed the position and killed the three gunners. Advancing ahead of his men, he came across a German patrol preparing to use rocket launchers to ambush American tanks. He again attacked alone and, despite being outnumbered and outgunned, killed all six patrol members. When a machine gun opened fire at close range, {{he picked up a}} dead man's rifle and killed the two-man German crew. On April 19, he was shot through the head; a bullet entered at <b>his</b> <b>ear</b> <b>and</b> exited from the opposite cheek. He was sent to England and eventually the United States to recuperate. At about the same time, his father, who had been wounded in France, was also being evacuated to the United States.|$|E
25|$|On January 22, 2014, an anti-government {{activist and}} member of AutoMaidan was kidnapped by unknown parties and {{tortured}} for a week. His captors kept him in the dark, beat him, cut {{off a piece of}} <b>his</b> <b>ear,</b> <b>and</b> nailed him to a cross. His captors ultimately left him in a forest outside Kiev after forcing him to confess to being an American spy and accepting money from the US Embassy in Ukraine to organize protests against then-President Viktor Yanukovych.|$|E
25|$|Upon his release, O'Hare {{found that}} the INLA had split into hostile armed factions, one calling itself the Irish People's Liberation Organisation, the other known as 'INLA GHQ'. The IPLO assassinated INLA leaders Ta Power and John O'Reilly and in revenge, O'Hare is accused of the killing of Tony McCloskey, an IPLO {{associate}} who had allegedly tipped them off as to O'Reilly and Power's whereabouts. McCloskey was abducted {{from his home in}} County Monaghan on 6 February 1987. <b>His</b> <b>ear</b> <b>and</b> finger were cut off with a bolt cutter before he was eventually shot and his body dumped in a rural part of the same county. O'Hare is alleged to have been behind the abduction and killing. Seven INLA members died in the feud.|$|E

25|$|The {{firearms}} officers {{boarded the}} train and it was initially claimed they challenged the suspect, though later reports indicate he was not challenged. According to Hotel 3, Menezes then stood up and advanced towards the officers and Hotel 3, at which point Hotel 3 grabbed him, pinned his arms against his torso, and pushed {{him back into the}} seat. Although Menezes was being restrained, his body was straight and not in a natural sitting position. Hotel 3 heard a shot close to <b>his</b> <b>ear,</b> <b>and</b> was dragged away onto the floor of the carriage. He shouted 'Police!' and with hands raised was dragged out of the carriage by one of the armed officers who had boarded the train. Hotel 3 then heard several gunshots while being dragged out.|$|E
25|$|The second-to-last {{banknote}} design series, designed by Tapio Wirkkala, {{was introduced in}} 1955 and revised in the reform of 1963. It was the first series to depict actual specific persons. These included Juho Kusti Paasikivi on the 10 markkaa, K. J. Ståhlberg on the 50 markkaa, J. V. Snellman on the 100 markkaa and Urho Kekkonen on the 500 markkaa (introduced later). Unlike Erik Bruun's series, this series did not depict any other real-life subjects, but only abstract ornaments {{in addition to the}} depictions of people. A popular joke at the time was to cover Paasikivi's face except for <b>his</b> <b>ear</b> <b>and</b> back of the head on the 10-markka note, ending up with something resembling a mouse, said to be the only animal illustration in the entire series.|$|E
25|$|Magee fled to England, {{where he}} was part of an IRA active service unit. On 7 June 1992 Magee and another IRA member, Michael O'Brien, were {{travelling}} in a car on the A64 road between York and Tadcaster, when they were stopped by the police. Magee and O'Brien were questioned by the unarmed police officers, who became suspicious and called for back-up. Magee shot Special Constable Glenn Goodman - who died later in hospital - and then shot the other officer, PC Kelly, four times. PC Kelly escaped death when a fifth bullet ricocheted off the radio he was holding to <b>his</b> <b>ear,</b> <b>and</b> the IRA members drove away. Another police car began to follow the pair, and came under fire near Burton Salmon. The lives of the officers in the car were in danger, but Magee and O'Brien fled the scene after a member of the public arrived. A manhunt was launched, and hundreds of police officers, many of them armed, searched woods and farmland. Magee and O'Brien evaded capture for four days by hiding in a culvert, before they were both arrested in separate police operations in the town of Pontefract.|$|E

500|$|Paul Gauguin (1848–1903) was a French Post-Impressionist {{artist and}} {{figure in the}} Symbolist {{movement}} known for his contributions to the Synthetist style. In 1886, he spent the summer in Pont-Aven in Brittany, an artists colony that {{became known as the}} Pont-Aven School for Gauguin's influence and the work they produced. In late 1888, Gauguin painted for nine weeks with Vincent van Gogh at his Yellow House in Arles in the south of France before van Gogh had a breakdown, leading him to cut off <b>his</b> <b>ear</b> <b>and</b> be hospitalized. [...] Gauguin left Arles and never saw van Gogh again, but they continued to exchange letters and ideas.|$|E
500|$|... b. [...] Stott {{was badly}} {{wounded in the}} engagement, losing a piece of <b>his</b> <b>ear,</b> <b>and</b> his hearing and {{eyesight}} to the resulting swelling. A ball remained lodged in his head, and he died shortly aftwerwards on Hispaniola. A young Horatio Nelson was serving in the West Indies at the time, and wrote to his friend and patron William Locker about the captures, noting that William Williams, commander of Active had also died shortly afterwards, apparently of a broken heart. The heavy British losses at the time speeded Nelson's own promotion, and he was made master and commander of the brig [...] on 8 December 1778.|$|E
500|$|He has {{a tattoo}} of roots that starts on his head, behind <b>his</b> <b>ear,</b> <b>and</b> {{finishes}} at his hand. He {{also has a}} few other signature designed tattoos, one of which, a dragon, he hid from his father. It {{was also the first}} tattoo he got in 1998. He later got tattoos of the Chinese symbols for [...] "Peace" [...] and [...] "Health", as well as tattoos of fire and a wave. Hardy regards his tattoos as his [...] "artistic impulses". Hardy is very good friends with Shannon Moore, whom he has known since around 1987. He is also good friends with Marty Garner, Jason Arhndt, and John Morrison. He is also good friend with Shane Helms, having known him since the early 1990s. He and Matt also helped and trained Shane. He regards Vanilla Ice as a big influence on him, and he was even nicknamed [...] "Ice" [...] by Scott Hall.|$|E

500|$|... "Come Running" [...] was {{described}} by Morrison as [...] "a very light type of song. It's not too heavy; it's just a happy-go-lucky song." [...] By contrast, Hinton found the song's sentiments tender and lustful in the vein of the 1967 Bob Dylan song [...] "I'll Be Your Baby Tonight". He argued that [...] "Come Running" [...] juxtaposed images of unstoppable nature—wind and rain, a passing train—against [...] "which human life and death play out their little games", which the narrator and his lover dream will not end [...] "while knowing of course it will". According to the writer, [...] "These Dreams of You" [...] manages to be simultaneously accusatory and reassuring. The lyrics cover such dream sequences as Ray Charles being shot down, paying dues in Canada, and [...] "his angel from above" [...] cheating while playing cards in the dark, slapping him in the face, ignoring his cries, and walking out on him. Morrison said he was inspired to write [...] "Brand New Day" [...] after hearing The Band on the radio playing either [...] "The Weight" [...] or [...] "I Shall Be Released": [...] "I {{looked up at the}} sky and the sun started to shine and all of a sudden the song just came through my head. I started to write it down, right from 'When all the dark clouds roll away'." [...] Yorke quoted Morrison as saying in 1973 that [...] "Brand New Day" [...] was the song that worked best to <b>his</b> <b>ear</b> <b>and</b> the one with which he felt most in touch.|$|E
500|$|In September 2006, Jumper {{was filmed}} at various {{locations}} in Peterborough, Ontario and principal photography began in Toronto in October. In December 2006, Liman {{negotiated with the}} Rome Film Commission for rare access to film for three days in the Colosseum. The scene in the Colosseum was originally written for the Pantheon, at which exterior shots were also filmed. The crew was required to keep equipment off the ground by using harnesses and {{had to rely on}} natural light for filming. Filming took place for 45 minutes in the morning and in the evening so as not to disturb the public touring the amphitheater throughout the day. In order to maximize the short period for filming, four steadicams were set up to ensure time was not wasted in reloading the camera. A visual effects supervisor explained how visual effects were needed for various aspects after filming: [...] "There were three kinds of shots: there were shots where {{they were able to get}} most of what they needed in the Collosseum itself; and then there were shots on a set that needed extensions beyond the limits of the set; and then there were shots where we needed to create the Coliseum basically from scratch." [...] After filming in Rome, scenes were filmed in Toronto during December 2006 to January 2007 and wrapped at the Canadian location on January 19. On January 26 in Toronto, 56-year-old David Ritchie, a set dresser, was fatally struck by frozen debris while dismantling an outdoor set in wintry conditions. Another worker was injured and was sent to a hospital with serious head and shoulder injuries. After Toronto, the cast and crew traveled to Tokyo to film scenes. One scene required over 30 shoots as the scene could only be filmed in between traffic light changes. As a result of director Liman insisting Christensen perform his own stunts, the actor injured his hand, split open <b>his</b> <b>ear,</b> <b>and</b> developed a hyperdilated pupil that required hospital care while filming various scenes. In February 2007, the next filming site was set up at Gallup Park in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Sixty students from the nearby Huron High School were cast as extras for the film. Since additional filming was required of the area, twenty other students were used for a day of filming in September. Altogether, filming took place in 20 cities in 14 countries.|$|E

2500|$|Through his teens, Hancock {{never had}} a jazz teacher, but {{developed}} <b>his</b> <b>ear</b> <b>and</b> sense of harmony. He was also influenced by records of the vocal group the Hi-Lo's. He reported that:"...by the time I actually heard the Hi-Lo's, I started picking that stuff out; my ear was happening. I could hear stuff and that's when I really learned some much farther-out voicings – like the harmonies I used on Speak Like a Child – {{just being able to}} do that. I really got that from Clare Fischer's arrangements for the Hi-Lo's. Clare Fischer was a major influence on my harmonic concept...he and Bill Evans, and Ravel and Gil Evans, finally. You know, that's where it came from." ...|$|E

The Mishnah taught that a Hebrew maidservant was more privileged in that she could acquire her freedom by signs of puberty. The servant whose ear was bored (as directed in [...] ) is acquired by boring <b>his</b> <b>ear,</b> <b>and</b> acquired his freedom by the Jubilee year or the master's death.|$|E

2500|$|Schumann {{returned}} to Düsseldorf {{and began to}} edit his complete works and make an anthology {{on the subject of}} music. He suffered a renewal of the symptoms that had threatened him earlier. Besides the single note sounding in his ear (possibly evidence of tinnitus), he imagined that voices sounded in <b>his</b> <b>ear</b> <b>and</b> he heard angelic music. One night he suddenly left his bed, having dreamt or imagined that a ghost (purportedly the spirit of either Schubert or Mendelssohn) had dictated a [...] "spirit theme" [...] to him. The theme was one he had used several times before: in his Second String Quartet, again in his Lieder-Album für die Jugend, and finally in the slow movement of his Violin Concerto. In {{the days leading up to}} his suicide attempt, Schumann wrote five variations on this theme for the piano, his last completed work, today known as the Geistervariationen (Ghost Variations). Brahms published it in a supplementary volume to the complete edition of Schumann's piano music. In 1861 Brahms published his Variations for Piano Four Hands, Op. 23, based on this theme.|$|E
2500|$|Rijkaard was {{the cause}} of an {{incident}} with Rudi Völler when West Germany played the Netherlands in the 1990 World Cup. Rijkaard was booked for a tackle on Völler and, as Rijkaard took up position for the free kick, he spat in Völler's hair. Völler complained to the referee and was booked as well. From the resulting free kick, Völler then handled the ball and then went to the ground (according to his own account) to avoid a collision with Dutch keeper Hans van Breukelen, while others, notably Rijkaard and van Breukelen, saw Voller's handball and his resulting action as a dive in hopes for a penalty. Van Breukelen was angry at this but Rijkaard, already annoyed by Völler's previous antics, again confronted the West German by twisting <b>his</b> <b>ear</b> <b>and</b> stamping on his foot. Argentine referee Juan Carlos Loustau was tired of both Völler and Rijkaard's consistently hostile antics towards each other in such a short period of time, and fearing a fight between the two, sent off both Rijkaard and Völler. As he jogged back to the entrance tunnel, Rijkaard again spat in Völler's hair as they left the pitch. The German press nicknamed him [...] "Llama" [...] for his spitting. Rijkaard would later apologise for his behaviour to Völler, who accepted.|$|E

He also went on to say, [...] "As I said to the BCCI in a letter, had it been one of the players who was attacked there would have been an outcry, but because it was me no-one seemed to care. The reply came back talking about my racist comments." [...] and added [...] "There was a cover-up. Everyone went into cover-up mode. It was quite obvious it was a serious assault. It wasn't just a push in the back as the media was led to believe. The whole thing was played down. The only phone call I got from the BCCI asked me whether it really happened." [...] In response, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah told Cricinfo, [...] "No way can it be called racist. We treated the issue just like we would have treated [...] any other Indian player. I remember calling him and finding out the issue. We also enhanced security and provided adequate protection. The local police also provided us with support." [...] Chappell later downplayed the incident saying his comments came at [...] "an emotional time".|$|E
