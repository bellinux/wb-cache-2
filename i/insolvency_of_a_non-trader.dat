The fundamental logic of the Regulation, however, does not change: the Recast does not harmonise insolvency rules at EU level and its goal is still selecting competent venues and applicable insolvency regimes.

The Insolvency Regulation Recast is however innovative regarding the definition of COMI, by repealing the causality relation between criterions of ‘permanence’ and ‘ascertainability’. Eventually, the Recast aims at better coor- dinating secondary proceedings and main proceedings; in this regard, it introduces ‘synthetic secondary proceedings’, whereby the <b>insolvency</b> practitioner <b>of</b> <b>a</b> main proceeding undertakes to respect other Member States distributional criterions {{in order to avoid the}} opening <b>of</b> <b>a</b> secondary proceeding.

40|$|Insolvency law {{has finally}} become <b>a</b> field <b>of</b> law for which {{harmonisation}} at a European level is considered both important and feasible. In deciding upon {{the content of}} such harmonised rules, there {{will need to be}} a common understanding about the goals <b>of</b> <b>insolvency</b> law and, therefore, a European debate on bankruptcy theory. Bankruptcy theory, and most notably the influential creditors' bargain theory, has long viewed insolvency law as <b>a</b> set <b>of</b> rules for overcoming common pool problems. Bankruptcy theory thus far has almost completely overlooked anticommons problems. Anticommons present themselves in a situation in which there are several owners or entitled parties, and each of the parties has it within its power to block the use by others. Should anticommons behaviour in insolvency procedures go unchecked, creditors as a whole will be harmed. Insolvency is a collective process, and this process may not be sabotaged by a single party. Four typical insolvency issues, each identified by INSOL Europe as a candidate for harmonisation at a European level, are discussed, analysing them in terms of common pool problems and anticommons: preferences, reorganisation/composition plans, claim validation and <b>insolvency</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> group <b>of</b> companies...|$|R

40|$|A well {{functioning}} {{interbank market}} {{is essential for}} efficient financial intermediation. But interbank exposures imply the possibility of direct contagion: the <b>insolvency</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> single institution may trigger multiple bank failures due to direct credit exposures. The complete network of interbank exposures that gives rise to this channel of contagion is not observable, {{making it difficult to}} assess the systemic risk it poses. This paper uses data on loans and deposits between UK-resident banks to estimate the distribution of bilateral exposures. The potential for contagion is examined by assuming the sudden failure of each individual bank and estimating the losses incurred to other banks as <b>a</b> result <b>of</b> the initial shock. This study suggests that, while a single bank failure is rarely sufficient to trigger the outright failure of other banks, it does have the potential to weaken substantially the capital holdings of the banking system. And, when the failure <b>of</b> <b>a</b> single bank does result in knock-on effects, their severity depends greatly on the maintained assumptions about the distribution of interbank loans and the level of loss given default. But data constraints mean that drawing definitive conclusions is difficult. ...|$|R

It {{argues that it}} is wrong to assume that {{there is no need for}} a business reorganization law in a modern, service-oriented economy that has well-developed capital markets. The Article first analyzes and contrasts bankruptcy law in the United States under the Chandler Act of 1938, which fostered the concept of reorganization and rehabilitation of distressed business entities, and under the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, which built upon lessons learned under the Chandler Act and pursuant to which bankruptcy reorganization became an appropriate and necessary vehicle to preserve and protect the values of major business organizations. The Article then traces the economic, legal, political, and ideological changes that threaten the viability of corporate rehabilitation, including the passage of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005. Finally, this Article responds directly to anti-Chapter 11 theorists, arguing: (1) reorganization remains relevant to preserving going-concern values in today 2 ̆ 7 s economy, (2) Chapter 11 has significant value as a transparent, neutral, multi-party forum to address the <b>insolvency</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> business, even when a marketplace exists for the debtor 2 ̆ 7 s assets, and (3) the privatization <b>of</b> the <b>insolvency</b> process is both unworkable and undesirable...|$|R
