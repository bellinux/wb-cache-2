50|$|Elliot Handler is {{credited}} with developing the first talking doll, Chatty Cathy, using a pull string talking mechanism which revolutionized the toy industry. Mattel thereafter went on to develop a number of talking toys including Chatty Baby, Tiny Chatty Baby, and Charmin' Chatty. Toys made for cartoon favorites such as Bugs Bunny and Porky Pig; and toys made for television characters such as Herman Munster and Mr. Ed. Elliot Handler was primarily responsible for two additional Mattel product lines. In 1966, Mattel introduced smaller dolls called Liddle <b>Kiddles.</b> Handler claimed {{he wanted them to}} resemble little children in neighborhoods across America. They were sculpted by doll artist Martha Armstrong-Hand. <b>Kiddles</b> were a great success and continued to be produced in different versions until the early 1970s. Another product line was Hot Wheels, introduced in 1968, which gave rise to 10,000 different models.|$|R
25|$|Opas, {{convinced}} of Ryan's innocence, {{agreed to work}} without pay. Opas consulted the Ethics Committee of the Bar Council to seek approval to make a public appeal for a solicitor prepared to brief him, as Opas was prepared to pay his travel, other expenses and appear without fee. The Committee said {{that this would be}} touting for business and was unethical. Opas argued that a man's life was at stake and he could not see how he would be touting when no payment was involved. Opas defied the ruling and on national radio sought an instructor. Opas was inundated with offers and accepted the first application, being from Ralph Freadman. Alleyne <b>Kiddle</b> was in London completing a master's degree and she agreed to take a junior brief without a fee.|$|E
25|$|Seydlitz was sighted {{at about}} 2400 by Marlborough, who did nothing. The second {{ship in the}} squadron, Revenge (Captain <b>Kiddle)</b> {{challenged}} the unidentified ship, and received the wrong response, but took no action. Agincourt (Captain Doughty) {{at the rear of}} the line spotted her but did not challenge her so as not to give our division's position away. Light cruisers Boadicea and Fearless (Captain Roper) also spotted Seydlitz, but followed the example of the battleships and did nothing. Roper stated that by the time he could identify the ship, it was too late to fire a torpedo at her (Fearless was capable of 25 knots compared to Seydlitz's maximum 16 knots because of the damage). Seydlitz, already badly damaged and unable to put up much of a fight, was able to limp back to Germany.|$|E
500|$|A {{law degree}} was not {{sufficient}} to allow one to practice law; aspiring lawyers still had to also complete their articles. Elliott joined the firm of Moule, Hamilton and <b>Kiddle</b> on Market Street. While working on his articles, he lived at Endersleigh, where he dated Belle and Kate, {{the daughters of the}} owners. He completed his articles in August 1907, and was dismissed by Moule, Hamilton and <b>Kiddle,</b> since the firm would now have to pay him a living wage. Elliott practiced as a solicitor in Stawell, Victoria, for a while, before returning to Melbourne, where he formed a partnership with a fellow solicitor, Glen Roberts, with offices in Collins Street. He bought a house called [...] "Dalriada" [...] in Northcote, with a loan from his father, and married Kate Campbell there on 27 December 1909. They had two children, a daughter, Violet, born in March 1911, and a son, Neil, in June 1912. His militia career also flourished, and he was promoted to lieutenant in 1905, captain in 1909, major in 1911, and lieutenant colonel in 1913, commanding the 58th Battalion (Essendon Rifles).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Kiddles</b> were dolls {{originally}} {{produced by}} toymakers Mattel Inc. in 1965. They were introduced at the 1966 New York Toy Fair {{and put on}} the market soon after. Initially about 3 inches tall, they were tiny by doll standards. The sensation they created in the toy world caused other toy companies to produce their own tiny dolls.|$|R

40|$|I have {{designed}} a floating cage {{based on a}} trimaran ship model. The floating cage has been built with naval steel, and it’s formed by four floats joined by a steel structure. The weather deck is over this structure with a small control room {{in the middle of}} the stern top. This deck allows workers to be able o operate with the <b>kiddles,</b> feeding the fish and controlling the ship with ample workspace. The floating cage has been designed to sail short distances and to operate near the coast with good weather. There are many studies which show floating cages sink into the Cádiz bay because of the winter storms, that’s why my cage was designed to be used during spring and summer, between February and November. At the stern bottom it has two azimuth propellers, on per side, to propels the floating cage. It’s not necessary to install a rudder because this kind of propulsion can turn round by themselves, so the ship can maneuver easily too. For the size I have calculated the number of cubic meters needed to farm enough fish, to make the floating cage efficient. The first factor is the OGD (Optimum Growing Density) of the sort of fish we are going to farm. In these case, We are going to grow Sea Breann and Sea Bass, that has a OGD like 4 Kg/m^ 3. The second factor is the survival ratio of the fingerblings (baby fish). With these two factors I have calculated the volume of water used to farm the fish, and these volume is used to sized the main dimensions. The four floats have to support their own weigh, the weigh of the structure, the machinery, the joining structure, the first floor, the workers the fish the <b>kiddles</b> and the fish food...|$|R

2500|$|As well as premiering {{many of his}} own works, {{including}} his four piano concertos, Bowen also gave many first performances of piano works by other composers. [...] In 1907 he performed alongside Henry Wood and Frederick <b>Kiddle</b> to give the first British performance of Mozart's Concerto for Three Pianos and Orchestra in F major, K.242. [...] Similarly, in 1928 Bowen gave the first performance of William Walton's Sinfonia Concertante for Orchestra and Piano at a Philharmonic Society concert at the Queen's Hall.|$|E
50|$|The {{year had}} two seasons-the dry May to November period under {{south-east}} winds, {{broken by the}} onset of storms and humid conditions with the brief wet season, beginning in November, with north-westerlies blowing in from December continuing through to April, resulting in extensive flooding of the coastal flatlands. A division of labour existed, with men hunting and women foraging, armed with a digging stick (katjan) and a dillybag. Yams (mai watea) and arrowroot (mai woppa) were a wet season staple, followed by waterlilies. In the wet season they camped in {{the upper reaches of}} the riverine system. Their inland hunting grounds were of three types: grass plains, river courses and thickly timbered forest lands. As the dry-season came to an end, they would build dams and <b>kiddles</b> to trap fish swimming up river as the rains began to restock the rivers. A particular type of vine containing a poisonous substance that would spur fish to leap out of the water was used to dose waterholes, allowing them to be captured from the banks.|$|R
40|$|Deposited with {{permission}} of the author. © 1983 Allan WillinghamResearch for this dissertation began in February 1970 with a part-time post graduate, study to identify and document the architectural heritage of the Western District of Victoria. The initial program of study, which was centred on my birthplace, Camperdown, and the surrounding municipality of the Shire of Hampden, concentrated on {{an investigation of the}} many pastoral homesteads located in this rich grazing region of Victoria. Although the task proved to be both expansive and expensive, it was quickly established that throughout the nineteenth century, Scottish immigrants to the Port Phillip Colony of New South Wales exerted a strong, distinctly Caledonian influence on the patterns of settlement and cultural development of the lands known as 'Australia Felix'. In many instances, it was apparent that Scottish architectural traditions had been directly transplanted into an Australian context with a landscape altogether reminiscent of the Lowlands and Border Country of Scotland. In mid 1972, my research program was reduced in extent and redirected towards an investigation into the nature of this Scottish presence, and the influence of Scottish architects in the development of identifiable architectural traditions in Western Victoria. An index of the building and architectural data contained in the files of the Geelong Advertiser from 1840 - 1888 was prepared and a chronological account of the development of homestead architecture in the Western District was subsequently framed. Although several architectural firms were associated, with varying degrees of success, with the pastoral industry of the region, one firm, that of the architects Alexander Davidson and George Henderson, dominated the building industry {{at the height of the}} wool boom in the 1870 's. A chance follow up to a footnote in Margaret Loch <b>Kiddle's</b> authoratitive, social history of the Western District Men of Yesterday (1961), during a visit to Scotland in 1972 led to the discovery of George Henderson's papers in Edinburgh. This extensive collection of letters, drawings and photographs, which was kindly made available to me by Mrs. E. S. Phillipps, the daughter of George Henderson, relates to the careers of the architects Davidson and Henderson in Australia and also to the earlier practice of their mentor, the noted Edinburgh architect John Henderson. Included in the collection are 115 letters, written by George Henderson to his mother in the period 1867 - 1877, whilst working in Australia. These monthly epistles provide a unique and extremely frank, personal and detailed account of an architectural practice in Western Victoria in the nineteenth century and form the basis of this dissertation, which is essentially a study of the architecture of Davidson and Henderson.

2500|$|Elwes {{became the}} {{foremost}} English-born performer of the Brahms lieder {{in the first}} decades of the 20th century. In January 1907, he made a singing tour of Germany which included Berlin, Munich, Leipzig, Frankfort, and Cologne, giving recitals with Fanny Davies (a celebrated pupil of Clara Schumann's). He sang mixed programmes, but his performance of German lieder, and especially of Brahms, in German, was greatly admired. [...] He was then singing such songs as Komm bald, Am Sonntag Morgen, Salamander, Ein Wanderer, Wir wandelten, Auf dem Kirchhof, Magyarisch, Die Kränze, Ständchen, and Botschaft. He sang the Brahms Liebeslieder in Brussels in 1908 with Marie Brema, and in London gave a recital with Paderewski. In January 1913 at the Queen's Hall, under Henry J. Wood, he sang Mahler's Das Lied von der Erde in company with the contralto Doris Woodall: Wood thought it 'excessively modern but very beautiful'. Brahms remained central to Elwes's repertoire to the end, and he also performed lieder of Grieg, Dvořák, and George Henschel. Early in his career he found an ideal accompanist in Frederick B. <b>Kiddle,</b> and they remained associated until his death.|$|E
