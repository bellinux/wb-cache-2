50|$|Options, {{particularly}} exchange-traded options, {{are highly}} volatile securities whose market prices can change rapidly. In addition, {{the number of}} options in a market can be large. For instance, as of December 2013, there were over 550,000 <b>individual</b> <b>equity</b> option contracts, written on nearly 6,100 underlying stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), listed on the various U.S. options exchanges. Each contract is typically listed on multiple exchanges, resulting in millions of separate option prices that all change in real-time.|$|E
50|$|This {{umbrella}} organization was originally formed {{under the name}} of Arthur Andersen Société Coopérative as a Swiss cooperative in 1977 by the then partners of Arthur Andersen LLP and other professional services firms associated with it. The <b>individual</b> <b>equity</b> partners of Arthur Andersen LLP and the other firms associated with it became the individual members of the SC and the firms themselves became Member Firms by signing a formal agreement with the SC. The SC acted as the coordinator for the provision of common services between the Member Firms (the SC itself had very few employees and provided very few services directly). The SC never provided any professional services (which were provided in each country by a Member Firm) and did not pay any of its individual members (who were partners in the individual Member Firms and received any remuneration to which they were entitled through their Member Firm).|$|E
50|$|In {{the risk}} model {{industry}} factors carry {{about half the}} explanatory power after the market effect is accounted for. However, Rosenberg had left unsolved how the industry groupings should be defined - choosing to rely simply on a conventional set of industries. Defining industry sets {{is a problem in}} taxonomy. The basic difficulty is that the industry is defined by the members assigned to it, but which industry an <b>individual</b> <b>equity</b> should be assigned to is often unclear. Difficulties can be reduced by introducing a large number of narrowly defined industries, but this approach is in tension with the demands of risk estimation. For robust risk estimates we favor a moderate number of industries with each industry representing a few percentage points of market capitalization and not exclusively dominated by the largest company in the industry. Torre resolved this problem by introducing several hundred narrowly defined mini-industries and then applying guided clustering techniques to combine the mini-industries into industry groupings suitable for risk estimation.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} method for <b>individual</b> <b>equities</b> {{is based on}} {{comparing}} certain financial ratios or multiples, such as the [...] price to book value, [...] price to earnings, EV/EBITDA, etc., of the equity in question to those of its peers. This type of approach, which is popular as a strategic tool in the financial industry, is mainly statistical and based on historical data.|$|R
50|$|Actively managed {{mutual funds}} or unit trusts may also {{prove to be}} better located in tax-sheltered vehicles, because {{equities}} held through financial intermediaries tend to be taxed more, due to high turnover, than <b>individual</b> <b>equities</b> held by an investor for the long term, who {{has the opportunity to}} plan the realization of gains and offset losses.

40|$|This article investigates option {{models in}} the {{encompassing}} class of stochastic volatility, returnjumps, and volatility-jumps. Relying on <b>individual</b> <b>equity</b> options and method of simulated moments estimation, several major results obtained are, first, that the double-jump process is the least misspecified and the least demanding in fitting the tail-size and tail-asymmetry of individual risk-neutral return distributions; second, the double-jump model improves pricing performance beyond return-jumps absent volatility-jumps, and beyond volatility-jumps absent return-jumps; third, between return-jumps and volatility-jumps, the former is empirically more relevant than the latter for pricing options; fourth, the inverse link between volatility-jumps and return-jumps is instrumental for explaining the valuation of deep out-of-money puts and option dynamics of firms with high kurtosis; fifth, stochastic volatility is not as important for <b>individual</b> <b>equity</b> options {{as it is for}} index options.

40|$|This study {{demonstrates}} {{the impact of}} systematic risk on the prices of <b>individual</b> <b>equity</b> options. The option prices are characterized by the level and slope of implied volatility curves, and the systematic risk is measured as the proportion of systematic variance in the total variance. Using daily option quotes on the S&P 100 index and its 30 largest component stocks, we show that, after controlling for the underlying asset’s total risk, a higher amount of systematic risk leads {{to a higher level}} of implied volatility and a steeper slope of the implied volatility curve. Thus, systematic risk proportion can help differentiate the price structure across <b>individual</b> <b>equity</b> options...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} whether the dynamics in the volatility surface {{implicit in the}} prices of <b>individual</b> <b>equity</b> options traded on the CBOE contains any exploitable predictable patterns. In particular, we examine {{the possibility that the}} dynamics in the volatility surface implicit in S&P 500 index options may be associated and forecast subsequent movements in the implied volatility surface characterizing <b>individual</b> <b>equity</b> options. We find a strong relationship between equity and S&P 500 index option implied volatility surfaces. In addition, we discover a remarkable amount of predictability in the movements over time of both equity and stock index implied volatilities. We show that the predictability for equity options is incrased by the incorporation in the model of recent dynamics in S&P 500 implied volatilities. Similarly, when we examine the economic value of these predictability patterns (by proposing and simulating trading strategies that exploit our 1 -day head forecast of implied volatilities), we report that delta-hedged and straddle portfolios that take trade on the entire implied volatility surface and across all contracts examined produce high risk-adjusted profits which are maximum for the model that takes into account the feedback from past market implied volatility changes to subsequent dynamics in <b>individual</b> <b>equity</b> options implicit volatilities...|$|E

40|$|Pay {{matters to}} most {{employers}} and their employees, {{and given that}} pay has important organizational consequences (Heneman 2 ̆ 6 Judge, 2000), most companies {{have an interest in}} understanding how their employees assess pay satisfaction. Given this recognized importance of compensation, pay satisfaction has been an area of interest among scholars for many years, and organizational justice theory provides a framework for considering how people make pay satisfaction assessments. The primary {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the impact of several organizational justice constructs on pay satisfaction. Variables of interest included are: internal equity, <b>individual</b> <b>equity,</b> external equity, procedural justice, and interactional justice. Using a policy capturing approach, fifty-two middle and senior level managers at a large financial organization evaluated thirty-two hypothetical pay situations. The findings revealed that each of the justice constructs had a positive relationship with pay satisfaction. The three forms of distributive equity (individual, external, and internal equity) were viewed as more influential than procedural equity or interactional equity, and <b>individual</b> <b>equity</b> had the greatest influence. The cluster analysis established distinct clusters of managers who employed different decision policies, but all clusters had <b>individual</b> <b>equity</b> as the greatest influence. Some of the clusters had a more balanced approach while other clusters relied much more on the distributive equity components. These results support the early exchange theories, which were derived from social comparison theory, and reveal the overriding importance of similar comparisons when establishing pay models in organizations. ...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to compare the {{relative}} importance or effects of <b>individual</b> <b>equity,</b> external equity, internal equity, procedural justice, and informational justice on pay level satisfaction. Design/methodology/approach – The paper uses a policy-capturing methodology to determine the importance of the five factors and considers both group analyses and individual analyses of the data. Findings – Of the three types of equity, <b>individual</b> <b>equity</b> was the most important factor on pay level satisfaction. External equity and the three other factors were important for many individuals, and this was shown through the individual analyses. Research limitations/implications – The number of scenarios given to each participant was limited due to possible fatigue. Practical implications – The findings will help managers make judgments on how to respond to conflicts between internal alignment and external market conditions. Knowledge of which factors are most important will help managers create more effective compensation programs.

40|$|Although {{investors are}} {{concerned}} foremost with mean and variance, {{they are also}} sensitive to downside risk. In this article we employ several risk variables of traditional and downside risk measures to evaluate the equity returns in the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) market {{in order to test}} their explaining power. The test results show that variance (or SD) is better than beta in the performance. However, those traditional risk measures have almost less explanatory power than total downside risk measures, whether the downside risk measures are relative to zero, the mean return or the market index return when they are used to predict the future risk premium. The results also show that the significance of the downside risk measures in the NYSE market is different between different industry sectors, different periods of time and in different <b>individual</b> <b>equities.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Distributional {{properties}} of emerging market returns may impact on investor ability {{and willingness to}} diversify.

As realized returns are used as a proxy for expected returns, we separately examine conditional returns in upturn and downturn periods, in order to successfully identify risk and return relationships. Results indicate that co-skewness and downside beta are priced by investors. Further testing confirms a separate premium for each measure, confirming that they capture different aspects of downside risk. Robustness tests indicate that, when combined with other risk measures, both retain their explanatory power. Tests also indicate that co-skewness may be the more robust measure...|$|R

40|$|At {{the heart}} of optimal hedging with {{additive}} models in Yamada (Recent advances in financial engineering: proceedings of the KIER-TMU international workshop on financial engineering, World Scientific, pp 225 – 245, 2010; Proceedings of the 2011 American control conference, pp 3856 – 3861, 2011; Asia-Pac Financ Mark 19 (2) : 149 – 179, 2012) is to replicate the payoff of European basket options using separate options as close as possible. In this paper, we extend their technique for the case of path-dependent barrier options, where the mean square error of the payoffs between the basket barrier option and the sum of options on the individual assets is minimized over any smooth payoff functions. To this end, we propose to represent the underlying assets using the Brownian bride decomposition and show that computations involving conditional expectations of basket barrier options boil down to those of unconditional expectations. This procedure enables us to provide an algorithm to compute the necessary and sufficient condition for the optimal hedging problem based on the Monte Carlo method. Then, we consider to apply our methodology to the Black–Cox type first passage time structural model, where a defaultable company possesses/runs multiple assets/projects and the default may occur {{the first time the}} asset value hits a certain lower threshold before the maturity. We formulate the equity value separation problem using additive models, in which <b>individual</b> <b>equity</b> values are introduced so that their sum approximates the total equity value as close as possible. It is also shown that any portion of total equity value may be assigned as an initial value of each <b>individual</b> <b>equity</b> when using the optimal smooth functions. Finally, we examine the contributions of <b>individual</b> <b>equity</b> values to default or survival by applying a certain normalization for conditional expectations via numerical experiments to illustrate our proposed methodology...|$|E
