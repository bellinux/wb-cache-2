The fact that the faux blood begins leaking through his shirt was added to [...] "hide the fact that [...] <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> sleight of hand". The image of the beating heart in the furnace was created by overlapping a shot of a fake beating heart and a shot of actual fire. The two were then merged in post-production by animator John Wash, because the fire would have melted the actual heart model. The beating of the hearts of Naciamento's victims was created via a pump that was operated off-screen. The actual milagro prop was crafted several times because, according to Manners, the face was particularly difficult to get right. In fact, the second time the medallion appears in the episode, {{it is a different}} prop.|$|E
500|$|In {{reviewing}} Epiphany 2.30 in July 2010 Jack Wallen {{described it}} as [...] "efficient, but different" [...] and noted its problem with crashes. [...] "When I first started working with Epiphany it crashed on most sites I visited. After <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> research (and then a little debugging) I realized the issue was with JavaScript. Epiphany (in its current release), for some strange reason, doesn't like JavaScript. The only way around this was to disable JavaScript. Yes this means a lot of features won't work {{on a lot of}} sites – but this also means those same sites will load faster and won't be so prone to having issues (like crashing my browser)." [...] Wallen concluded positively about the browser, [...] "Although Epiphany hasn't fully replaced Chrome and Firefox as my one-stop-shop browser, I now use it much more than I would have previously.

500|$|The song is {{featured}} on three Aerosmith live compilations: Live! Bootleg (1978), Classics Live (1986), and Rockin' the Joint (2005). [...] On the Rockin' the Joint version, Perry and Brad Whitford {{can be heard}} <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit of [...] "The Star Spangled Banner" [...] towards the end. [...] Additionally, the band is known to play two {{different versions of the}} song, the regular version of the song, as well as a slowed-down version often called [...] "Slow Train" [...] in the setlists. [...] On at least two occasions, Tyler and Perry have performed the song with other artists; in 1992 with Guns N' Roses and in 1995 with Page and Plant. In 2002, the whole band performed the song live with the Japanese hard rock duo B'z. It also appears in the music video game Rock Band, and the master track appears in [...] as the final encore in the game. In 2012, Aerosmith performed the song with Johnny Depp, which is included as an extra track on the Music from Another Dimension! DVD.|$|E

500|$|Bible Student Alexander H. Macmillan, {{who served}} as an aide to the {{executive}} committee, later wrote that tensions at the Watch Tower Society headquarters mounted as the day for election of the Society's officers approached. He wrote: [...] "A few ambitious ones at headquarters were holding caucuses here and there, <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> electioneering to get their men in. However, Van Amburgh and I held {{a large number of}} votes. Many shareholders, knowing of our long association with Russell, sent their proxies to us to be cast for the one whom we thought best fitted for office." [...] Macmillan, who claimed he had declined an offer from an ailing Russell months earlier to accept the position of president after his death, agreed with Van Amburgh that Rutherford was the best candidate. According to Macmillan, [...] "Rutherford did not know what was going on. He certainly didn't do any electioneering or canvassing for votes, but I guess he was doing some worrying, knowing if he was elected he would have a big job on his hands ... There is no doubt in our minds that the Lord's will was done in this choice. It is certain that Rutherford himself {{had nothing to do with}} it." ...|$|E
500|$|Spears {{explained}} that since {{she did not}} tour to promote Blackout, she was excited about having to include songs from that album into the setlist. The finished setlist would include three songs from Circus, six songs from Blackout and five songs from In the Zone (2003); {{other parts of the}} setlist consist of a medley of [...] "Breathe on Me" [...] and [...] "Touch of My Hand", both from In the Zone; and a remix of [...] "...Baby One More Time", the only song performed off the album of the same name (1998). [...] "Everytime" [...] was the only song not included in the released setlist but was performed regularly on the show. Magician Ed Alonzo joined Spears in one of the acts, and she played as his assistant. Alonzo stated, [...] "We're going to be doing the classics of magic but a little high-tech. We'll be <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> dissection, transposition, a vanish, an appearance— and if I do a trick, she doesn't just hold the props, she's actually getting inside the big boxes or I am slicing her up. ... Some of it's pretty scary, but she gets right in there with no reservations." [...] The costumes were designed by Dean and Dan Caten from DSquared2. They recreated classic circus outfits, like clowns, jugglers and trapeze artists in a more provocative way. They commented that, ...|$|E
500|$|In June 1902, Castro {{seized a}} British ship, The Queen, on {{suspicion}} of aiding rebels, in another phase of the Venezuelan civil war. This, together with Castro's failure to engage with the British through diplomatic channels, tilted the balance in London in favor of action, with or without German cooperation. By July 1902, the German government was ready {{to return to the}} possibility of joint action, with Matos' insurrection having led to further abuses against German citizens and their property, including by government forces. In mid-August, the United Kingdom and Germany agreed in principle to go ahead with a blockade later in the year. In September, after the Haitian rebel ship the Crête-à-Pierrot hijacked a German ship and seized weapons destined for the Haitian government, Germany sent the gunboat SMS Panther to Haiti. The Panther found the ship and declared that it would sink it, after which the rebel Admiral Hammerton Killick, after evacuating the crew, blew up his ship and himself with it, assisted by fire from the Panther. There were concerns about how the United States would view the action {{in the context of the}} Monroe Doctrine, but despite US State Department legal advice describing the sinking as [...] "illegal and excessive", the State Department endorsed the action, and the New York Times declared that [...] "Germany was quite within her rights in <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> housecleaning on her own account". Similarly, the British acquisition of the island of Patos, in the mouth of the Orinoco between Venezuela and the British dependency of Trinidad and Tobago, seemed to cause no concern in Washington, even though as a territorial claim it [...] "skirted dangerously close to challenging the Monroe Doctrine".|$|E

One of the unique products of this series, female turtle Venus, is notorious for becoming one of the additions to the franchise that Laird most despises. However, he took a more active role in the next TMNT animated venture, acting as [...] "a consultant, and... working with the guy I consider the head writer, Lloyd Goldfine." [...] In this role, he says [...] "rom the get-go I've been looking at everything, from day one. Story premises, outlines, the full scripts and the sketching and designing of characters and settings.

In association with TalentHouse, fans had the opportunity to compete for the chance to have Lewis' website release their remix. Lewis and Smith would be among the judges.|$|E
2500|$|In 2014, Malaysia {{together}} with Thailand and Venezuela was listed {{at the third}} and lowest tier by US Department of State. This was due to Malaysia only <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> progress to combat the exploitation of foreign migrant workers who are routinely subjected to forced labour conditions {{and those who had}} been recruited under false pretenses and later coerced into sex work. Many Rohingya refugees who want to seek a better life in Malaysia frequently fall victim to human traffickers, such as what already happened in northern Malaysia when the traffickers kept them in houses, beating them, depriving them of food, and demanding a ransom from their families. Many Filipinas who been promised with good jobs in other countries by traffickers in the Philippines also been trafficked to Malaysia as a transit point, leaving them vulnerable to detention from Malaysian authorities for illegal trespassing. Beside that, a large numbers of Vietnamese and Chinese traffickers have shifted their prostitution business to Malaysia which making Vietnamese women at the top list of foreign prostitutes in the country, followed by some Cambodian women. The traffickers tactic usually cheat the victim by offering them jobs in Malaysia with high salary, but once they arrived to meet the trafficker (who have disguised themselves as the manager), the victim will be brought and locked in a house, raped and forced into sex work. Chinese traffickers from China who used to kidnap children in their country use their victims to beg in the streets of Kuala Lumpur to raise sympathy from Malaysian citizens for their condition after the children been [...] in their country after been kidnapped though they was originally born healthy.|$|E
