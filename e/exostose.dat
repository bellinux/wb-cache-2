MÉTODOS: Avaliamos 24 pés em 19 pacientes, com média de idade de 51, 3 anos, portadores de hálux valgo, com seguimento médio de 50, 1 meses. Submeteram-se à técnica de osteotomia de adição com <b>exostose</b> óssea (OAEO) 13 pés e à osteotomia de adição com placa para cunha de adição (OPCA) 11 pés. Foram avaliados no pré e pós operatório o escore AOFAS, os ângulos intermetatársicos 1 e 2, e ângulo de valgismo do hálux. RESULTADOS: Na técnica OAEO a média no pré-operatório do AOFAS foi 46, 6 pontos, AIM 14 º e AVH 32 º, enquanto no pós-operatório AOFAS 81, 3 pontos, AIM 9 º e AVH 25 ºcom 92, 3 % de resultados satisfatórios. Na técnica OPCA a média no pré-operatório do AOFAS foi 42, 1 pontos, AIM 15 º e AVH 29 º, enquanto no pós-operatório AOFAS 77, 4 pontos, AIM 11 º e AMF 23 º com 81, 8 % de resultados satisfatórios. CONCLUSÕES: Ambas as técnicas cirúrgicas mostraram-se eficazes no tratamento do hálux valgo, clínica e radiograficamente, sem diferença estatística entre elas.

OBJECTIVE: To {{clinically}} and radiographically {{compare the}} results of treatment of hallux valgus, by two addition osteotomy techniques: one using resected exostosis, and the other using a plate fixation for addition wedge. METHODS: We evaluated 24 feet of 19 patients, mean age 51. 3 years, affected by hallux valgus, with a mean follow-up of 50. 1 months. 13 feet underwent addition osteotomy with resected exostosis (AORE) and 11 patients (11 feet) underwent addition osteotomy with plate (AOP). The AOFAS score, intermetatarsal 1 and 2 angles, and hallux valgus angle were evaluated before and after surgery. RESULTS: In the AORE technique, the mean preoperative AOFAS was 46. 6, with IMA 14 º and HVA 32 o, while in the postoperative AOFAS it was 81. 3, with IMA 9 º and HVA 25 º, and 92. 3 % satisfactory results. In the AOP technique, the mean preoperative AOFAS was 42. 1, with IMA 15 º and HVA 29 º while in the postoperative AOFAS it was 77. 4, with IMA 11 º and HVA 23 º and 81. 8 % of satisfactory results.

40|$|SUMMARY In a {{large family}} with 37 members with {{multiple}} <b>exostoses,</b> only one person has developed sarcomatous degeneration of a lesion. Our review of published reports revealed great variation {{in the incidence of}} malignancy in multiple <b>exostoses</b> (10 to 25 %). Most studies had sampling errors leading to the apparent overstatement of risk. In large pedigrees with essentially complete ascertainment of affected subjects, the risk of malignancy is nearer 3 % or less. This lower risk for malignancy may be more appropriate in counselling affected subjects. Hereditary multiple <b>exostoses</b> is an autosomal dominant trait characterised by numerous cartilage capped lesions located in areas of actively growing bone. 1 - 3 Although <b>exostoses</b> may cause compli-cations through the compression of local tissues, the major threat to life derives from the malignant degeneration of the lesions.

40|$|Background: Extension of a {{vertebral}} exostosis {{into the}} spinal canal is rare, butmany isolated {{cases have been}} reported in the literature. Threeexisting patientswithmultiple hereditary <b>exostoses</b> at our institution had development of neurologic findings and were found to have <b>exostoses</b> in the spinal canal. These findings led us to perform magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomographic scans for the remaining patients with multiple hereditary <b>exostoses</b> at our institution. Methods: Forty-four patients at our institution (including twenty-six male patients and eighteen female patients) had multiple hereditary <b>exostoses.</b> Forty-three patients were evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging and one was evaluated with computed tomography to look for spinal column involvement. Results: Thirty (68 %) of the forty-four patients had <b>exostoses</b> arising from the spinal column, and twelve (27 %) had lesions encroaching into the spinal canal. Thirty-six of the forty-four patients also had plain radiographs, but only six had radiographs that accurately identified the lesions and another six had radiographs that mistakenly identified lesions that were not confirmed with magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography. Patients with lesions inside the spinal canal were typically asymptomatic and neurologically normal, with radiographs that did not demonstrate the lesion. Compared with female patients, male patients were more likely to have spinal lesions and more likely to have lesions encroaching into the spinal canal (p = 0. 014).

40|$|Background: This study {{aimed to}} assess pain {{and quality of}} life in a large cohort of {{patients}} with multiple hereditary <b>exostoses.</b> Methods: All 322 known patients with multiple hereditary <b>exostoses</b> in the Netherlands were asked to participate. An age-specific questionnaire was sent to children (less than eighteen years old) and adults. The questionnaire focused on pain, daily activities, and school and/or professional situation. Adults also filled out the RAND- 36 questionnaire. Results were statistically analyzed with use of the SPSS 15. 0 software and with the chi-square test and multiple logistic regression. A p value of < 0. 05 was regarded as significant. Results: Two hundred and eighty-three patients (88 %), including 184 adults (65 %) and ninety-nine children (35 %), completed the questionnaire. Multiple hereditary <b>exostoses</b> resulted in various physical and social consequences. The majority of adults (119) were employed; however, thirty-three (28 %) had changed jobs because of the symptoms of multiple hereditary <b>exostoses</b> and twenty-five (21 %) required adjustments in their working environment. Of the sixty-five adults who were not employed, thirteen were medically unfit to work. Of eighty-five children attending school, forty-five (53 %) experienced problems at school. The symptoms of multiple hereditary <b>exostoses</b> caused twenty-seven children (27 %) and eighty-five adults (46 %) to stop participating in sporting activities. Pain was the greatest problem, with sixty-two children (63 %) and 152 adults (83 %) who reported recent pain. On multivariate analysis, pain in adults was correlated most significantly with age and problems at work, and pain in children was correlated with the perception of the disease and problems at school. Adult patients with multiple hereditary <b>exostoses</b> had a lower quality of life than the Dutch reference groups, with lower scores on six of eight RAND- 36 subscales. Conclusions: Our study confirms that multiple hereditary <b>exostoses</b> is a chronic disease causing a profound impact on quality of life.
