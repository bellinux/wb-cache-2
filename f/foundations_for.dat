5|$|After {{the fall}} of the Tokugawa shogunate Sakakibara was {{instrumental}} in preserving traditional Japanese sword techniques in the early Meiji Era. Despite his eventual opposition to the practice of sword fighting for sport, his work during this period laid the <b>foundations</b> <b>for</b> the modern sport of kendo.

5|$|Chapman {{had laid}} out a five-year plan for success in 1925, and it came to {{fruition}} exactly on schedule, as his Arsenal won their first major trophy in the 1930 FA Cup Final, beating his old side, Huddersfield Town, 2–0.

5|$|Comte's {{positivism}} {{established the}} initial philosophical <b>foundations</b> <b>for</b> formal sociology and social research.

5|$|Through {{the rest}} of the 1970s, other {{possible}} designs were looked at but never implemented, while preliminary work on the construction site resumed. On April 29, 1979, the <b>foundations</b> <b>for</b> the Auburn Dam were completed. However, debates continued over whether to build an arched or straight-axis gravity dam. Some favored the latter design because it would have greater mass, allowing it to better withstand earthquakes.|$|E

5|$|Aberdeen {{joint station}} was congested, {{resulting}} in delayed trains, and the low, open platforms were frequently covered in oily slime {{due to the}} large quantities of fish that passed through. Agreement with the Caledonian Railway over rebuilding the station had been reached in 1899, but the companies fell out over widening the line to the south. Moving the goods station to the east was similarly complex, with conflicts with the harbour commissioners and the town council. In 1908 new platforms {{on the western side}} opened and the adjoining station hotel was bought in 1910. <b>Foundations</b> <b>for</b> the new building were laid in 1913 and the station was largely complete by July 1914, although outbreak of war delayed further progress and the station was finally completed in 1920.|$|E
5|$|After Mindaugas' death, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania entered {{times of}} {{relative}} instability, as {{reflected by the}} fact that seven Grand Dukes held the title {{over the course of the}} next 32 years. Little is known about this period, but the Gediminid dynasty was founded in about 1280. Despite the instability, the Grand Duchy did not disintegrate. Vytenis assumed power in 1295, and during the next 20 years laid solid <b>foundations</b> <b>for</b> the Duchy to expand and grow under the leadership of Gediminas and his son Algirdas. While the Grand Duchy was established between 1219 and 1295, the years after 1295 marked its expansion.|$|E
5|$|After {{the path}} was {{finalized}} came the augers and drillers for the holes {{that served as}} <b>foundations</b> <b>for</b> the Vertical Support Members that held up the pipe. These holes were drilled and filled {{with a mix of}} water, gravel and dirt before a VSM was dropped into each hole. Because of the frozen ground, the gravel and dirt froze as hard as concrete, sealing the VSMs in place. The VSMs were laid in parallel, two at a time, and each had a semicircular rest for the pipeline segments. These were carried in 40-foot or 80-foot segments by crane or sideboom to the appropriate location, lowered into place, then welded together. The welds were then inspected via X-ray by quality control engineers who followed the welders.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1960s, the {{regional}} policy of bringing businesses into disadvantaged areas of Wales through financial incentives had proven very successful in diversifying the industrial economy. This policy, begun in 1934, was enhanced by the construction of industrial estates and improvements in transport communications, most notably the M4 motorway linking south Wales directly to London. It was believed that the <b>foundations</b> <b>for</b> stable economic growth had been firmly established in Wales during this period; but this view was shown to be wildly optimistic after the recession of the early 1980s saw the collapse of much of the manufacturing base that had been built over the preceding forty years.|$|E
5|$|During his reign, he {{completed}} the conquest and expulsion of the Hyksos from the delta region, restored Theban rule {{over the whole}} of Egypt and successfully reasserted Egyptian power in its formerly subject territories of Nubia and Canaan.

This building program culminated {{in the construction of the}} last pyramid built by native Egyptian rulers.
