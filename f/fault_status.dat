It would be an advantage for repair technicians if it, as a complement to the diagnoses, was possible to exactly state which components that certainly are faulty, which that are only suspected to be faulty, and which that are normal, i. e. to state the components ’ fault statuses. There would also be an advantage if the technicians could get an indication when a component’s <b>fault</b> <b>status</b> cannot be changed by evaluating additional diagnostic tests, and the <b>fault</b> <b>status</b> is in that case said to be ready.

40|$|The fault {{diagnosis}} of gearboxes {{was developed for}} some decades. The current diagnosing techniques were mostly based on analyzing the vibration signal of shell especially close to the bearing seat of gearbox. In order to utilize the spatial distribution information of fault signal, the near field acoustic holography (NAH) is employed for the condition monitoring and {{fault diagnosis}} of the gearbox in this presentation. The distribution images of sound pressure {{on the surface of}} gearbox are reconstructed by NAH, and the feature extraction and pattern recognition can be made by image processing techniques. A gearbox is studied in a semi-anechoic chamber to verify the fault diagnosis technique based on NAH. The pitting and partial broken teeth of gears are artificially made respectively as <b>fault</b> <b>statuses,</b> and the differences of acoustic images among normal and fault working states under the idling condition are analyzed.

40|$|This report {{demonstrates}} improvements made in {{battery charging}} and battery management technology through {{the design of}} a universal programmable battery charger with optional battery management system attachment. This charger offers improvements in charge efficiency and unique battery charging algorithms to charge a variety of battery chemistries with variety of power requirements. Improvements in efficiency result from a synchronous Buck Controller topology as compared to previous universal chargers that use asynchronous Buck-Boost Converter topologies. This battery charger also surpasses current universal battery chargers by offering different charge modes for different battery chemistries. Charge modes provide the user an option between extending the life of the battery by selecting a mode with a slower, less stressful charge rate or a shorter charge time with a fast, more stressful charging mode. The user can also choose a charge mode in which the battery charges to full capacity, resulting in maximum runtime or a less than full capacity, which puts less stress on the battery thus extending the lifetime. Ultimately, this system permits weighing the performance tradeoff of battery lifetime and charge time. The optional battery management system attachment offers more precise monitoring of each cell and cell balancing for Li-Ion batteries. This further enhances the performance of the charger when integrated, but is not necessary for charger operation. The battery charger consists of three subcircuits: A microcontroller unit, a power stage, and a current sensing circuit. A C 2000 Piccolo F 28069 microcontroller controls a LM 5117 Buck Controller by injecting a pulse-width modulated signal into the feedback node controlling the output of the buck to set a constant current or constant voltage thus creating a programmable battery charger. The pulse-width modulated signal changes according to charge algorithms created in software for specific battery chemistries and charge requirements. An analog-to-digital converter on the microcontroller monitors battery voltage by using a voltage divider and an INA 169 current shunt monitor, which outputs a voltage corresponding to the charge current to another analog-to-digital converter on the microcontroller, monitors the charge current. This allows the charger program to maintain correct and safe charging conditions for each charge mode in addition to measuring output power. Lights on the microcontroller display a real-time status to the user of which portion of the charge profile the charger is in. A solid red light means the charger is in the constant current portion of the charge profile. A blinking red light means the charger is in the constant voltage portion. No red light means the battery charger finished and the battery is currently charged above nominal voltage. The battery charger works with the battery management system in the next section to provide ultimate battery charging and managing capabilities. The battery management system consists of two subcircuits: A microcontroller and a battery monitoring circuit. The MSP 430 FR 5969 microcontroller unit communicates with BQ 76 PL 536 battery management integrated circuits to create a battery management system that monitors data such as cell voltage, pack voltage, pack temperature, state of charge, <b>fault</b> <b>statuses,</b> alert statuses, {{and a variety of other}} useful cell parameters. This data displays on a liquid crystal display screen through different menu options. The user scrolls through the menus using a capacitive touch slider on the microcontroller unit and selects a given option using the option select button.

40|$|Wireless sensor {{networks}} (WSNs) {{are widely}} used in various real life applications where the sensor nodes are randomly deployed in hostile, human inaccessible and adversarial environments. One major research focus in wireless sensor networks in the past decades has been to diagnose the sensor nodes to identify their <b>fault</b> <b>status.</b> This helps to provide continuous service of the network despite the occurrence of failure due to environmental conditions. Some of the burning issues related to fault diagnosis in wireless sensor networks have been addressed in this thesis mainly focusing on improvement of diagnostic accuracy, reduction of communication overhead and latency, and robustness to erroneous data by using statistical methods. All the proposed algorithms are evaluated analytically and implemented in standard network simulator NS 3 (version 3. 19). A distributed self fault diagnosis algorithm using neighbor coordination (DSFDNC) is proposed to identify both hard and soft faulty sensor nodes in wireless sensor networks. The algorithm is distributed (runs in each sensor node), self diagnosable (each node identifies its <b>fault</b> <b>status)</b> and can diagnose the most common faults like stuck at zero, stuck at one, random data and hard faults. In this algorithm, each sensor node gathered the observed data from the neighbors and computes the mean to check the presence of faulty sensor node. If a node diagnoses a faulty sensor node in the neighbors, then it compares observed data with the data of the neighbors and predicts its probable <b>fault</b> <b>status.</b> The final <b>fault</b> <b>status</b> is determined by diffusing the fault information obtained from the neighbors. The accuracy and completeness of the algorithm are verified based on the statistical analysis over sensors data. The performance parameters such as diagnosis accuracy, false alarm rate, false positive rate, total number of message exchanges, energy consumption, network life time, and diagnosis latency of the DSFDNC algorithm are determined for different fault probabilities and average degrees and compared with existing distributed fault diagnosis algorithms. To enhance the diagnosis accuracy, another self fault diagnosis algorithm is proposed based on hypothesis testing (DSFDHT) using the neighbor coordination approach. The Newman-Pearson hypothesis test is used to diagnose the soft <b>fault</b> <b>status</b> of each sensor node along with the neighbors. The algorithm can diagnose the faulty sensor node when the average degree of the network is less. The diagnosis accuracy, false alarm rate and false positive rate performance of the DSFDHT algorithm are improved over DSFDNC for sparse wireless sensor networks by keeping other performance parameters nearly same. The classical methods for fault finding using mean, median, majority voting and hypothesis testing are not suitable for large scale wireless sensor networks due to large devi- ation in transmitted data by faulty sensor nodes. Therefore, a modified three sigma edit test based self fault diagnosis algorithm (DSFD 3 SET) is proposed which diagnoses in an efficient manner over a large scale wireless sensor networks. The diagnosis accuracy, false alarm rate, and false positive rate of the proposed algorithm improve as {{compared to that of}} the DSFDNC and DSFDHT algorithms. The algorithm enhances the total number of message exchanges, energy consumption, network life time, and diagnosis latency, because the proposed algorithm needs less number of message exchanges over the algorithms such as DSFDNC and DSFDHT. In the DSFDNC, DSFDHT and DSFD 3 SET algorithms, the faulty sensor nodes are considered as soft faulty nodes which behave permanently. However in wireless sensor networks, the sensor nodes behave either fault free or faulty during different periods of time and are considered as intermittent faulty sensor nodes. Diagnosing intermittent faulty sensor nodes in wireless sensor networks is a challenging problem, because of inconsistent result patterns generated by the sensor nodes. The traditional distributed fault diagnosis (DIFD) algorithms consume more message exchanges to obtain the global <b>fault</b> <b>status</b> of the network. To optimize the number of message exchanges over the network, a self fault diagnosis algorithm is proposed here, which repeatedly conducts the self fault diagnosis procedure based on the modified three sigma edit test over a duration to identify the intermittent faulty sensor nodes. The algorithm needs less number of iterations to identify the intermittent faulty sensor nodes. The simulation results show that, the performance of the HISFD 3 SET algorithm improves in diagnosis accuracy, false alarm rate and false positive rate over the DIFD algorithm...|$|E

The purpose of this project is to analyze the future of batteries, the Lithium-Ion cell, and to exercise a BMS to better understand its capabilities and possible cases for errors. Lithium ion batteries are intolerant of overcharge and overdischarge. Abuse of this kind can result in high temperatures, venting of gases, fire, or explosion. Therefore battery management systems have been devised to prevent such abuse. Recent events such as fires on the Boeing Dreamliner and the Tesla Model S have shown that these dangers are real. These products do have highly developed battery management systems, and the incidents were caused {{in spite of these}} systems. This study was undertaken to illustrate how one system from Texas Instruments, functions to monitor and control a simple battery pack. Part I: Battery Data Acquisition Preliminary battery tests were conducted to fully understand the operations of charging and discharging the battery. These tests were essential {{to gain a better understanding}} of typical battery behavior and to be able to perform calculations necessary in analyzing the characteristics of the batteries. Also, these tests were ran to ensure that the Lithium-Ion batteries being used correctly corresponded to the graphs and values provided by the datasheet. The knowledge gained from Part I was vital for a better comprehension of the functions needed to balance the cells for Part II as well as the importance of safety precautions necessary when dealing with multiple batteries. Part II: Exercising the BQ 76 PL 536 2 ̆ 6 GUI The BQ 76 PL 536 Evaluation Module (EVM) was tested using the BQ 7 PL 536 BMS chips. An Aardvark adapter acts as a link between the EVM and PC allowing the user to read data from the BMS chips on a GUI. The BMS chips are validated by reading voltages of individual battery cells, pack voltage, and pack temperature. The GUI allows for enabling cell balancing between the cells but this feature is not automatic and must be engaged by the user.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the synthesis of}} a protective operating system shell environment for robots. The approach is {{designed to protect the}} robot from the effects of errors in the lower level manipulator system and the higher level plan. This shell is composed of a number of fault tolerance tasks at a discrete decision making level. In order to separate the various functions of a robotic system and to better monitor the interactions of the components, we use models from the design of computer operating systems. The user communicates with a "shell" which is wrapped around a "kernel. " One of the duties of the robot fault tolerance shell should be to enforce a protocol between the user commands and the robot fault tolerance capabilities. In this paper, we describe an implementation to conform to a formal protocol which explicitly includes fault tolerance. Each of the discrete layers in the robot control system will be modeled by a separate finite state machine (FSM). The FSMs encapsulate the redundancy and fault tolerance capabilities of the system in a uniform manner. Our FSMs will be designed to be dynamically growing and contracting as for example when new sensors are added or as sensors fail. From these FSMs we can develop a shell capability analysis utility that monitors the current <b>fault</b> tolerance <b>status</b> of the robot system. For example, the process of checking to see if the fault reconfigured robot can still complete its plan can be approached as a conformance testing problem. When faults cause joints to be lost, the reduced robot will be viewed as a subset of the original robot. Test sequences can be developed to determine if the reduced robot conforms to the original robot specification with respect to the user's original plan. A "critic" utility in the shell can also check for obstacles and will halt the robot to protect it from possible damage. National Science FoundationSandia National LaboratoryNAS...|$|R

The type S3301 was a 500 kHz clocked 20 bit word machine with two Mullard core memory stores providing 4k of 20 bit data, see Ref. 4. The internal CPU logic was synchronised to even and odd clock signals and special signals generated via the microinstruction diode boards. The memory logic had slow and fast loops to speed the transfer of sequential data bursts. Its microinstructions were programmed on diode boards. A facility was provided to microstep through instructions to help with <b>fault</b> finding. Processor <b>status</b> bits were provided with machine instructions being decoded from 6 bits in the current address memory word. Double word data had the MSB designated a sign bit coded as binary fractions ( [...] -1 to +1) for the square root, multiply and divide instructions. The instruction set had the usual functions based on three registers named A, B and D (C was the current address in memory register, M). An additional instruction assisted with checksum calculation for data transferred to and from main data stores (viz. Sperry Rand magnetic drums.).|$|R
40|$|Traumatic injury {{can lead}} to loss, {{suffering}} and feelings of injustice. Previous {{research has shown that}} perceived injustice is associated with poorer physical and mental wellbeing in persons with chronic pain. This study aimed to identify the relative association between injury, compensation and pain-related characteristics and perceived injustice 12 -months after traumatic injury. 433 participants were recruited from the Victorian Orthopedic Trauma Outcomes Registry and Victorian State Trauma Registry, and completed questionnaires at 12 - 14 months after injury as part of an observational cohort study. Using hierarchical linear regression we examined the relationships between baseline demographics (sex, age, education, comorbidities), injury (injury severity, hospital length of stay), compensation (compensation <b>status,</b> <b>fault,</b> lawyer involvement), and health outcomes (SF- 12) and perceived injustice. We then examined how much additional variance in perceived injustice was related to worse pain severity, interference, self-efficacy, catastrophizing, kinesiophobia or disability. Only a small portion of variance in perceived injustice was related to baseline demographics (especially education level), and injury severity. Attribution of fault to another, consulting a lawyer, health-related quality of life, disability and the severity of pain-related cognitions explained the majority of variance in perceived injustice. While univariate analyses showed that compensable injury led to higher perceptions of injustice, this did not remain significant when adjusting for all other factors, including fault attribution and consulting a lawyer. In addition to the "justice" aspects of traumatic injury, the health impacts of injury, emotional distress related to pain (catastrophizing), and the perceived impact of pain on activity (pain self-efficacy), had stronger associations with perceptions of injustice than either injury or pain severity. To attenuate the likelihood of poor recovery from injury, clinical interventions that support restoration of health-related quality of life, and adjustment to the impacts of trauma are needed...|$|R
