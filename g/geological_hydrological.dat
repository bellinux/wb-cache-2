An example of the division between a natural hazard and a natural disaster is that the 1906 San Francisco earthquake was a disaster, whereas living on a fault line is a hazard. Some natural hazards can be provoked or affected by anthropogenic processes (e.g. land-use change, drainage and construction).|$|E

A stone {{bridge over the}} river at Rorbas was built in 1840. The [...] "Kohlenschwärze" [...] (the slippery moist forest on the northern slope of the Blauen over the Töss River) is a <b>geological,</b> <b>hydrological</b> problem area since the Middle Ages, always leading to file entries. The road there could only be completed by 1850. Towards the south, the route Embrach - Lufingen - Kloten was built 1841 to 1850. In the north from 1842 to 1843, the road piece Rorbas - Wagenbrechi - Chrützstrass - Glattfelden was accomplished. From 1858, the route Embrach Dreispitz - Eschenberg - Bülach, with gentle climbs passable throughout the year, was finished. Earlier connections to Bülach were steep, unpaved mule tracks in wretched condition. The road Embrach - Nürensdorf was completed in 1864. These new roads and bridges were built based on a French model with solid groundwork over 5 meters in width. The surface consists of gravel, some asphalt. These roads and bridges withstood the pressures and the volume of modern traffic until 1970. Since 1905 the streets of Embrach are electrically illuminated.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Studies of water-rock {{interaction}} rarely explicitly {{address the}} antithetical properties of scale and detail. Explicit treatments of these properties usually rely on statistical methods and focus independently on <b>geological,</b> <b>hydrological,</b> or geochemical data. While these approaches {{have the power}} to draw conclusions from large data sets, they lack predictive capability when data sets from other areas are considered, or when perturbations (e. g., climate changes) are imposed on existing data. However, when processes and properties of natural systems are understood, such a predictive capability may be gained. We propose a framework for considering the interaction of scale and detail of spatial and temporal properties of natural systems and processes, applied to mineralized rocks. Weathering of ore-related minerals, especially sulfides, provides the opportunity to trace flow along specific fracture sets, and demonstrates the isolation of some sets from others. Case studies presented in this paper, and its second part (by Berger et al. this volume), demonstrate scale-dependent phenomena in natural systems. Although our approach is qualitative, it allows for an efficient design of field and lab studies, and results in a fully integrated study of natural systems, as it includes <b>geological,</b> <b>hydrological,</b> and geochemical factors. ...|$|E
