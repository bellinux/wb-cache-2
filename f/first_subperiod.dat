40|$|This paper evaluates whether excess {{returns on}} holding Deutschmarks against French Francs, Italian Liras and British Pounds have been {{recently}} characterized by (temporary) speculative bubbles. We propose a two-step, distribution-free procedure. <b>First,</b> nonzero-median <b>subperiods</b> are significantly {{withdrawn from the}} original sample by an elaborate sign test that avoids the objection of data-mining. Second, we apply the Wilcoxon rank test on all selected subsamples. All excess returns are characterized by nonzero medians, which remain significant for the Lira/DM and the Franc/DM even when adjusting for risk and for overlapping observations. Heuristically, {{the presence of a}} speculative bubble seems to be a plausible explanation for the latter two exchange rates rather than a peso problem or learning.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to compare stable, {{integrated}} and long-memory generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) models in forecasting the volatility of returns in the Turkish foreign exchange market for the period 1990 - 2005 and for the subperiod that covers the floating exchange rate regime 2001 - 2005. In the first period, we found that long-memory GARCH specifications capture the temporal pattern of volatility for returns in US and Canadian dollars against Turkish lira. For the same period, the temporal pattern of volatility for returns Australian dollar, Japanese yen, Euro and British pound against Turkish lira are best captured by stable GARCH specifications. We found that in the subperiod, only the stable GARCH models are relevant and the return series no longer exhibit the long-memory properties. It was also concluded that all return series except British pound against Turkish Lira have asymmetric effects. Our analysis has shown that when long memory, asymmetry and power terms in the conditional variance are employed, together with the skewed and leptokurtic conditional distribution (of innovations), the most accurate out-of-sample volatility is produced for the <b>first</b> and <b>subperiod.</b> Thus is useful for financial decisions which utilize such forecasts. ...|$|R

In the <b>first</b> of three <b>subperiods,</b> 1973 - 75, real financial costs were very negative and tended to offset low returns on operating assets. During 1976 - 78 the dismantling of interest rate controls increased real financial costs, but other factors increased the returns on operating assets more rapidly. During 1979 - 81 financial costs jumped enough to more than absorb increases in gross earnings, which were probably due to Argentine demand. The rates of earning and capital formation were highest among exporters in the the second subperiod, when a major export promotion program was in place. This pattern was reversed in the third subperiod, as the promotion programs were dismantled and real currency appreciation seemed to squeeze gross earnings of exportables relatively more. This unequal squeezing was probably due to redundant tariff and other protection for import-competing producers...|$|R

Since the Asian financial crisis in 1997, many economists {{are concerned about}} the relationship between Asian stock markets and others in the world. This paper is conducted to examine the linkages between ASEAN- 5 + 3 namely Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia, China, Japan and Korea and US stock markets. The data consists of weekly stock indices data. The total samples are separated into three <b>subperiods.</b> <b>First</b> period is pre-crisis period spanning from January 1990 to June 1997. Second period is during-crisis period spanning from July 1997 to June 1998. Third period is post-crisis period spanning from July 1998 to May 2007. All the indices applied are expressed in local currencies. The empirical analysis begins with testing the stationarity properties of the data. All the countries are found to be stationary at first difference except for Japan for pre-crisis period. Next, cointegration test is employed to test the long-run stationary relationship among the stock markets. The number of significant cointegrating vector is higher during-crisis compare to other periods whereas the same number of cointegrating vector is found before and after crisis. Granger-causality based on VECM showed that Thailand is exogenous whereby Malaysia is the most endogenous at before and during the crisis. After the crisis, US become dominant compare to the other countries. In conclusion, we found that ASEAN- 5 + 3 and US stock markets are interdependence during crisis and post-crisis periods and the impact of US stock market is effective in ASEAN- 5 + 3 stock markets only for pre and during-crisis periods...|$|R

40|$|Empirical {{research}} indicates that subgroups, referred to as 2 ̆ 2 strategic groups 2 ̆ 2, within an industry exhibit different performance consequences for similar strategic actions and environmental changes. A strategic group {{is defined as a}} set of firms within an industry that compete alike. This research effort applies the strategic group concept to a study {{of the structure of the}} property and liability insurance industry. The purpose of this study is to improve the understanding of competition and performance in the insurance industry from a strategic perspective. ^ Data for fifty-seven property and liability insurance fleets were gathered from A. M. Best Company sources. The time period under study encompassed the nine years 1981 through 1989. ^ Strategic variables define strategic positioning in terms of similarity of strategic scope and resource deployment commitments. These variables describe geographic and product diversification, financial commitments to functional areas, and scale of operations. Variance-covariance matrix equality tests evaluate strategic changes over time. Four distinct subperiods of stable strategic structures are evident during the time period studied. ^ Within each stable strategic subperiod, cluster analysis procedures identify strategic group membership. Group membership proved to be transitory across the nine years studied. A large number of membership changes occurred and new groups emerged routinely. The number of groups in each stable strategic time period ranged from eight in the <b>first</b> <b>subperiod</b> to thirteen in the third subperiod. ^ Following the establishment of group membership, hypotheses are tested for differences in the levels of economic impact. The performance dimensions analyzed are return on assets, risk, and risk adjusted return. ^ Significant differences along the return dimensions are found between strategic groups in all subperiods. These findings are consistent with the theory. Risk differences, however, are noted strongly only in the <b>first</b> <b>subperiod</b> and weakly in the second subperiod. Significant differences between groups also are not indicated during any of the subperiods when returns are adjusted for varying levels of risk. ...|$|E

The assumed time frame allowed identifying area changes for {{a complete set of}} towns in different socio-economic conditions: the period of intense industrialisation, the economic crisis of the 1980 s, the period of economic transition and finally in the years of a market economy. The investigation revealed that the trend shown by changes and the size of a town as measured by the number of its population are distinctly interrelated. It also demonstrated a much stronger dynamics of changes in the <b>first</b> <b>subperiod,</b> i. e. years 1960 – 1985, followed by a phase of relative stabilization (compared with the previous period) after the year 1980 (mainly of the spatial changes).

Replenishment orders are {{made before the}} <b>first</b> <b>subperiod,</b> and the stores may make transshipments to one another between the subperiods. We prove that the transshipment decision has a dominant strategy, called a control-band conserving transfer policy, under which each store chooses a quantity to transship in or out that will keep its second-subperiod starting inventory level within a range called a control band. We prove that the optimal replenishment policy is a modified base-stock policy in which the order-up-to level depends on the initial inventory and capacity level at the other store. Finally, we prove that there does not exist a transfer price that coordinates the decentralized supply chain. Our research reconciles many {{of the differences between}} preventive and lateral transshipments, including differences in the optimal transfer policies and the existence or nonexistence of transfer prices that coordinate the system.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to test whether the risk neutral densities (RNDs) implied in the prices of the future options contract on the Spanish IBEX 35 index accurately predict the distribution of future outcomes of the underlying asset. We estimate RNDs using both parametric and nonparametric procedures. We find that between 1996 and 2003 we cannot reject the hypothesis that the RNDs provide accurate predictions of the distributions of future realisations of the IBEX 35 index at four week horizon. However, this result is not robust by subperiods. In particular, from October 1996 to February 2000, we find that RNDs are not able to consistently predict the actual realisations of returns. In this period, option prices assign a low risk neutral probability to large rises compared with realisations. Tests based on the tails of the distribution show that RNDs significantly understate the right tail of the distribution for both the whole period and the <b>first</b> <b>subperiod.</b> ...|$|E

During the third subperiod, from 2004 to 2008, changes in the reserve requirement system were little significant and apparently were unrelated to the general objetives of monetary policy. In the fourth subperiod, beginning in 2008, reserve requirements were again used intensively, with the main objective of providing liquidity to the banking system, but also as a tool for aggregate demand management and for selective credit allocation...|$|E

In comparison to the analysis of climate change impacts per decade, this approach is much more appropriate and gives insight into variations throughout the entire observed period.

A spatial clustering algorithm is first applied to the leading two principal components (PCs) and shows significant clustering.
