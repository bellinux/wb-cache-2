Stein, by happenstance, was lecturing off-camera to the amusement {{of the student}} cast. [...] "I {{was just going to}} do it off camera, but the student extras laughed so hard when they heard my voice that (Hughes) said do it on camera, improvise, something you know a lot about. When I gave the lecture about supply-side economics, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> applauding. Everybody on the set applauded. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> applauding because they had learned something about supply-side economics. But they were applauding because they thought I was boring...It was the best day of my life", Stein said.|$|E

In court testimony, William Petit stated that he felt a [...] "jolt of adrenaline" [...] coupled with a need to escape upon hearing one of the perpetrators state: [...] "Don't worry, it's going to be all over in a couple of minutes."

500|$|Rodriguez {{first came}} up with the idea for Planet Terror during the {{production}} of The Faculty: [...] "I remember telling Elijah Wood and Josh Hartnett, all these young actors, that zombie movies were dead and hadn't been around in a while, but that <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> going to come back in a big way because they’d been gone for so long.

Sure enough, the zombie [...] invasion happened and they all came back again, and I was like, 'Ah, I knew that I should've made my zombie film.'"

500|$|... "Material Girl" [...] {{was written}} by Peter Brown and Robert Rans, while Nile Rodgers {{produced}} the track. In 1986, Madonna told Company magazine, that although she did not write or create the song, the lyrical meaning and concept did apply to her situation at that point of time. She elaborated, [...] "I'm very career-oriented. You are attracted {{to people who are}} ambitious that way, too, like in the song 'Material Girl'. You are attracted to men who have material things because that's what pays the rents and buys you furs. That's the security. That lasts longer than emotions." [...] During a 2009 interview with Rolling Stone, Madonna was asked by interviewer Austin Scaggs, regarding her first feelings, after listening to the demos of [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] and [...] "Material Girl". Madonna responded by saying, [...] "I liked them both because they were ironic and provocative at the same time but also unlike me. I am not a materialistic person, and I certainly wasn't a virgin, and, by the way, how can you be like a virgin? I liked the play on words, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> clever.

500|$|Gillian Anderson was {{particularly}} {{pleased with the}} episode showing a different side of Scully and said, [...] "I {{thought it was a}} great idea. I personally was going through a dark period at the time, and I wanted to explore Scully's dark side. For some reason, Glen and Jim were on the same wavelength that week. Afterward, a lot of people told me that on that episode I was so 'unlike' Scully or that 'it showed my range'. I told them <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> wrong. I don't think that what I did here was out of character for Scully. The only thing different is that the audience hadn't seen it before." [...] Initially, Anderson called up Morgan and asked him to write a story wherein Scully [...] "fall hard" [...] for another man, which leads to an [...] "intense kind of romantic or passionate relationship". Morgan obliged and wrote a scene where Scully enjoys a passionate night with Jerse. This was later removed from the script by series creator Chris Carter, the only time in Glen Morgan's tenure on the show where a scene of his was removed by Carter. Morgan later noted [...] "I think Chris thought that I was monkeying around with him, but I really wasn't." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the shock}} {{exit from the}} Confederations Cup with Spain, Villa {{returned}} from his holidays on 27 July amidst much media speculation linking him with top clubs such as Real Madrid, Barcelona, Liverpool, Chelsea, and Manchester United. Villa quelled such rumours after announcing his desire to remain at the Mestalla to fulfil his contract, underlining that he [...] "could not spend all summer refuting things, so I wanted to be quiet... I was told I should leave Valencia {{for the good of}} the club, soon after that everything changed and from that moment on I never saw myself out of here – before the Euros, the club told me what my asking price was, and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> going to sell me, but when I returned from my vacations, Vicente Soriano said that he did not want me to leave Valencia. That removed all doubt for me. There is no train missed because all that I have achieved is because of Valencia and the Spanish national team." [...] When questioned on whether or not he should apologise to Valencia fans, he simply replied, [...] "I did not kill anyone, I do not think I have to ask for forgiveness." ...|$|E

500|$|In November 1987 Harrison {{released}} the platinum album Cloud Nine. Co-produced with Jeff Lynne of Electric Light Orchestra, the LP included Harrison's rendition of James Ray's [...] "Got My Mind Set on You", which went to {{number one in}} the US and number two in the UK. The accompanying music video received substantial airplay, and another single, [...] "When We Was Fab", a retrospective of the Beatles' career, earned two MTV Music Video Awards nominations in 1988. Recorded at his estate in Friar Park, Harrison's slide guitar playing featured prominently on the album, which included several of his long-time musical collaborators, including Clapton, Jim Keltner, and Jim Horn, who recalled Harrison's relaxed and friendly demeanour during the sessions: [...] "George made you feel at home, in his home... He once had me sit on a toilet and play my soprano sax, and they miked it {{at the end of the}} hall for a distant sound. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> kidding... Another time he stopped me in the middle of a sax solo and brought me 3 p.m. tea—again I thought he was kidding." [...] Cloud Nine reached number eight and number ten on the US and UK charts respectively, and several tracks from the album achieved placement on Billboards Mainstream Rock chart – [...] "Devil's Radio", [...] "This Is Love" [...] and [...] "Cloud 9".|$|E
500|$|The Cure {{released}} {{their debut}} album Three Imaginary Boys in May 1979. Because of the band's inexperience in the studio, Parry and engineer Mike Hedges {{took control of}} the recording. The band, particularly Smith, were unhappy with the album; in a 1987 interview, he admitted, [...] "a lot of it was very superficial – I didn't even like it at the time. There were criticisms made that it was very lightweight, and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> justified. Even when we'd made it, I wanted to do something that I thought had more substance to it". The band's second single, [...] "Boys Don't Cry", was released in June. The Cure then embarked as the support band for Siouxsie and the Banshees' Join Hands promotional tour of England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales between August and October. The tour saw Smith pull double duty each night by performing with the Cure and as the guitarist with the Banshees when John McKay quit the group in Aberdeen. That musical experience had a strong impact on him: [...] "On stage that first night with the Banshees, I was blown away by how powerful I felt playing that kind of music. It was so different to what we were doing with the Cure. Before that, I'd wanted us to be like the Buzzcocks or Elvis Costello; the punk Beatles. Being a Banshee really changed my attitude to what I was doing." ...|$|E

I went to Olympic Trials that year (2004) with Kyla [...] I remember seeing the gymnasts on the floor and I loved all of their leotards. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> so little and so amazing.

I sat down and played {{a little bit and}} they started laughing. I'd always had this {{reservation}} about my first encounter with top dog players and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> rubbishing me, but with traditional black people communication always happens very slowly and that's how it was.

2500|$|Carey {{attributed}} his subdued {{reaction to}} the perfect bid by saying, [...] "Everybody thought someone had cheated. We'd just fired Roger Dobkowitz, and all the fan groups were upset about it. ... I remember asking, 'Are we ever going to air this?' And nobody could see how we could. So I thought the show {{was never going to}} air. I thought somebody had cheated us, and I thought the whole show was over. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> going to shut us down, and I thought I was {{going to be out of}} a job." [...] Kniess later defended his actions, claiming that he never cheated, and in the end, was awarded his prizes. (His feat can be comparable to the actions of Michael Larson, who appeared on the CBS 1980s game show Press Your Luck, and won $110,237 by memorizing the board sequence.) ...|$|E

Remember that Ramsay's health was breaking up in the last two years. He had lost his nerve in the House in the last year. I had to take all the important speeches. The moment he went, I prepared for a general election and got a bigger majority for rearmament. No power on earth could have got rearmament without a general election except by a big split. Simon was inefficient. I had to lead the House, keep the machine together with those Labour fellows.|$|E
2500|$|Rhino hired Terry Gilliam and {{was granted}} an {{extension}} from Thompson {{but only with}} the stipulation that the director made the film. Rhino {{did not want to}} commit to Gilliam in case he didn't work out. Thompson remembers, [...] "They just kept asking for more [...] I got kind of agitated about it, because <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> trying to put off doing it. So I began to charge them more... I wanted to see the movie done, once it got started." [...] The studio threatened to make the film with Cox and without Depp and del Toro. The two actors were upset when producer Laila Nabulsi told them of Rhino's plans. Universal Pictures stepped in to distribute the film and Depp and Gilliam were paid $500,000 each but the director still did not have a firm deal in place. In retaliation, Depp and Gilliam locked Rhino out of the set during filming.|$|E
