40|$|Electronic {{component}} data, {{commonly known}} as "data sheets" are the sustenance of a circuit designer. Each new book of <b>data</b> <b>sheets</b> possibly solves some outstanding idea or design problem. Given such {{a prominent role in}} a designer's life, it is of critical importance that <b>data</b> <b>sheet</b> representation in a computer be more than just a photographic image of the original. This paper examines some of the issues in the computer representation of <b>data</b> <b>sheets</b> for active components. It begins by examining different types of <b>data</b> <b>sheets</b> along with the varying types of representation required. Next, the issues of data and parameter representation are described. The problems of describing the behavior, or model definition immediately follows, concluding with the problems of assembly and test. 1.

30|$|The most {{important}} step in designing of an FLC involves the rule base extraction. The designing can be done either using expert’s knowledge or using the available experimental <b>data</b> <b>sheet.</b> The benefits {{of the use of}} the <b>data</b> <b>sheet</b> and the constraints of relying on expert’s knowledge have been explained before. Rule extraction using <b>data</b> <b>sheet</b> is used for the training of the system.|$|R
50|$|In 2012, the US {{adopted the}} 16 section Safety <b>Data</b> <b>Sheet</b> to replace Material Safety <b>Data</b> <b>Sheets.</b> This became {{effective}} on December 1, 2013. These new Safety <b>Data</b> <b>Sheets</b> {{comply with the}} Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals (GHS). By June 1, 2015, employers were required to have their workplace labeling and hazard communication programs updated as necessary - including all MSDSs replaced with SDS-formatted documents.|$|R
40|$|For {{reliable}} {{energy yield}} predictions an accurate modeling of the PV module behavior is essential. In this analysis we compare two different possibilities for acquiring the necessary parameters: indoor measurements and <b>data</b> <b>sheet</b> values. We found that temperature coefficients of power given in <b>data</b> <b>sheets</b> {{can be used}} for yield prediction without introducing higher uncertainties. On the other hand the derivation of model parameters for the modeling of irradiation dependent efficiency of PV modules based on <b>data</b> <b>sheets</b> is associated with high uncertainties. In a sample of 50 PV modules only for 15 modules parameters from <b>data</b> <b>sheets</b> could be derived with a sufficient accuracy...|$|R

The training <b>data</b> <b>sheet</b> prepared on the experimental observations {{of the system is}} provided to the computer. The training <b>data</b> <b>sheet</b> is used to extract the initial rule base and then optimize it using GA. Accuracy of the rule base depends on the distribution of data points in the <b>data</b> <b>sheet</b> over the range of application.|$|R
30|$|Different new {{contents}} of safety <b>data</b> <b>sheets</b> {{are to be}} generated, processed and communicated by mid- 2015 or 2018. This means more mandatory information in the safety <b>data</b> <b>sheet,</b> new formats, new classification and labelling according to the CLP Regulation and new parameters - becoming available from registrations - for the risk assessment {{and the protection of}} humans and the environment (in particular DNELs, PNECs). The required exposure scenarios for substances need to be attached as an annex to the safety <b>data</b> <b>sheet.</b> Suppliers of mixtures, who do not need to prepare exposure scenarios themselves, can choose: either they can attach the relevant exposure scenarios as an annex to their safety <b>data</b> <b>sheets</b> or they can incorporate the relevant items of information in sections 1 to 16.|$|R

50|$|A {{design or}} product {{specification}} describes {{the features of}} the solutions for the Requirement Specification, referring to the designed solution or final produced solution. Sometimes the term specification is here used in connection with a <b>data</b> <b>sheet</b> (or spec sheet). This may be confusing. A <b>data</b> <b>sheet</b> describes the technical characteristics of an item or product as designed and/or produced. It can be published by a manufacturer to help people choose products or to help use the products. A <b>data</b> <b>sheet</b> is not a technical specification as described in this article.|$|R
40|$|Safety <b>Data</b> <b>Sheets</b> are {{the primary}} source of hazard {{information}} on chemical substances and mixtures and are used to inform risk assessments. It is imperative to ascertain the quality of this primary source of information in informing risk based decision making. The content of Safety <b>Data</b> <b>Sheets</b> (SDS) is governed by regulatory requirements outlined under the Globally Harmonised System for the Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS). However, regulation in itself does not provide assurance {{of the quality of the}} content of the SDS. This study assesses and creates an awareness of the quality of Safety <b>Data</b> <b>Sheets</b> and establishes the criteria for ranking the quality of various sections in the SDS. 200 Safety <b>Data</b> <b>Sheets</b> have been selected from the aerospace sector and assessed for their quality. A review of the 200 SDS has identified significant statistical differences between the various sections of the SDS and the quality of information between hazardous and non-hazardous chemicals. The data analysis suggests a limited impact of GHS and REACH, Annex II Regulations on the overall quality of content of the Safety <b>Data</b> <b>Sheets...</b>|$|R
