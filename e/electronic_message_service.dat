40|$|Municipal health {{services}} (MHSs) {{carry out the}} control and prevention of communicable diseases, {{under the authority of}} the municipal councils. Mayors have the authority to enforce measures aimed at individuals, such as isolation and quarantine. The mandatory notification of infectious diseases by physicians, as required by the Infectious Diseases Act, {{is an essential part of}} infectious disease control. By collecting these notifications, MHSs obtain a much better picture than the individual physician of the mutual relationships between the reported cases. MHSs monitor current regional developments, while the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) does this for the entire country and elsewhere in the world. By means of <b>electronic</b> <b>message</b> <b>service,</b> the information can be disseminated immediately, if necessary, to health professionals everywhere in The Netherlands. In case of national threats or epidemics, the National Coordination of Infectious Disease Control (LCI) can request expert advice from the Outbreak Management Team and can advise the Minister of Public Health, Welfare and Sport (VWS) as to the best control measures. The Minister is chairman of a board of administrators, defines the policy and bears the final responsibility. The Ministry of VWS creates the necessary conditions. The Minister of VWS has noted structural errors in the organisation of the prevention of infectious diseases and will implement an improved organisational structure in the beginning of 2005.

40|$|Abstract — Today <b>electronic</b> <b>messaging</b> <b>services</b> are {{indispensable}} {{to individuals and}} organizations. If a message contains sensitive information, the integrity and confidentiality of the contents created by individual users should be maintained in an effective manner. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new mechanisms to support the requirement. In this paper {{we focus on the}} message protection in the organization-to-organization service, while many other researchers have worked on the person-to-person service. Our approaches can provide effective integrity verification, tracking mechanisms, and confidentiality at the user-level in a scalable manner with fine granularity. Furthermore, we use a set of session keys for each message to provide more secure communications, maintaining scalable key management by employing a key hierarchy. We describe the mechanisms of our approaches and show their feasibility by describing a prototype system that we developed. I...|$|R
40|$|The Institute of Medicine {{called for}} {{healthcare}} organizations {{to provide care}} whenever needed, using the Internet as appropriate. Few organizations currently offer clinical <b>electronic</b> <b>messaging</b> <b>services</b> for their patients. Many believe that broader adoption of online services will not occur without a change in reimbursement policies. We propose modified Evaluation and Management (eVisit E&M) criteria derived from the current office-based E&M codes {{as a means of}} qualifying whether an online encounter should be reimbursed. Physician reviewers applied the proposed eVisit criteria to 120 randomly selected <b>electronic</b> <b>messages</b> sent by 112 patients to 69 physicians through a personal health record system. Twenty-two percent of clinical messages to physicians contained sufficient patient-history data and medical decision-making components to warrant reimbursement according to our eVisit criteria. Among a subset of patients with multiple chronic diseases, this would have generated an estimated 1. 2 eVisits per patient annually. Across a broader patient population, we estimate that 0. 7 eVisit encounters would be generated annually per patient. Sixty-five percent (65 %) of patients felt that electronic communication with their physicians saved one or more office visits per year. Reimbursing for qualified eVisits may encourage broader use of electronic communication to improve access to care and reduce overall healthcare costs...|$|R

40|$|The {{demand for}} {{personal}} communications services has shown unprecedented growth, {{and the next}} decade and beyond promise {{an era in which}} the needs for ubiquitous, transparent and personalized access to information will continue to expand in both scale and scope. The exchange of personalized information is growing from two-way voice to include data communications, <b>electronic</b> <b>messaging</b> and information <b>services,</b> image transfer, video, and interactive multimedia. The emergence of new land-based and satellite-based wireless networks illustrates the expanding scale and trend toward globalization and the need to establish new local exchange and exchange access services to meet the communications needs of people on the move. An important issue is to identify the roles that satellite networking can play in meeting these new communications needs. The unique capabilities of satellites, in providing coverage to large geographic areas, reaching widely dispersed users, for position location determination, and in offering broadcast and multicast services, can complement and extend the capabilities of terrestrial networks. As an initial step in exploring the opportunities afforded by the merger of satellite-based and land-based networks, several experiments utilizing the NASA ACTS satellite and the public switched local exchange network were undertaken to demonstrate the use of satellites in the delivery of personal communications services...|$|R

40|$|The {{advent of}} {{powerful}} hand-held devices {{and the desire}} for communication on the move, are the driving forces behind an emerging technology called mobile computing. Today, mobile computing users are being provided with applications such as <b>electronic</b> mail, short <b>message</b> <b>service</b> (SMS) and calendar/diary programs. Observing the growing demands of roaming users, it can be predicted that the next generation (3 G and beyond) wireless networks will be burdened with bandwidth-intensive trac generated by personal multimedia applications such as web browsing, traveler information systems, video and games. However, the available resources (e. g. bandwidth) for supporting such applications is extremely limited. Additionally, mobility of users poses a signicant challenge {{due to the fact that}} the the resource requirements in the network could be quite unpredictable. Therefore, proper management of bandwidth and hence ecient schemes for quality-of-service (QoS) provisioning between the end-systems are necessary to accommodate the envisaged high-bandwidth multimedia services. Until now, research and the current day technology has only identied the bottlenecks to provide QoS in wireless networks. Although various frameworks for QoS provisioning at various layers of the network protocol stack have been proposed, there exists a plenty of challenges and issues that need to be tackled before the next generation wireless multimedia networks are widely used in practice...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{social and}} nonsocial uses of <b>electronic</b> <b>messaging</b> systems, their determinants, and their impacts on direction of communication, perceived quality of work, and decision-making. A {{survey was conducted}} in 1992 in the headquarters of a large, geographically dispersed telecommunications company in Maryland which used an in-house electronic mail system. The findings showed that <b>electronic</b> <b>messages</b> were not widely used for socioemotional purposes but were certainly more common among certain groups. Messages pertaining to socioemotional content were generally avoided in downward and diagonal communication. Younger employees {{who had worked for}} the organiza-tion for a shorter period of time and were holding lower level jobs were more likely to communicate socioemotional content via <b>electronic</b> <b>messages.</b> These people were less often involved in the decision-making process and felt they did not make effective decisions. However, socioemotional use was positively related to perceived quality of work. Consistent with previous studies, upper managers tended to use <b>electronic</b> <b>messages</b> for routine tasks. When time pressure was involved, <b>electronic</b> <b>messages</b> would be used for complex tasks. Studies have shown a considerable amount of socioemotional con-tent in text-based, <b>electronic</b> <b>messages</b> (Hiemstra, 1982; Phillips, 1983; Rice & Love, 1987; Steinfield, 1986 a) regardless of their imper-sonal nature claimed by many researchers (Daft & Lengel, 1984...|$|R
