40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} a novel {{adaptive}} fuzzy <b>image</b> sequence <b>stabilization</b> system is {{proposed for the}} motion correction part of digital image stabilizers. The proposed stabilizer is based on smoothing of absolute frame positions. Initially a short mean filter is applied to raw absolute frame displacements as pre-process, to reduce the dynamic range of the fuzzy system input. This enables the fuzzy system to give appropriate responses with a fewer number of membership functions, hence provides improved performance at reduced computational load. Fuzzy stabilization is then achieved through fuzzy correction mapping. Output membership functions of the fuzzy system are continuously adapted so as to constitute a membership function adaptive fuzzy filtering process. The proposed membership function adaptive fuzzy filter based <b>image</b> sequence <b>stabilization</b> system is shown to provide excellent stabilization as well as intentional camera movement preservation performance, superior to previously reported systems. 1 Index Terms — Fuzzy logic, Image sequence analysis, Nonlinear estimation, nonlinear filters...|$|R

5|$|The HTC One is {{equipped}} with a 4.0-megapixel rear-facing camera module that contains a custom image sensor marketed as UltraPixel, which is composed of pixels that are 2.0µm in size. Most high-end smartphones {{at the time of its}} release used 8- or 13-megapixel cameras with pixel sizes ranging from 1.4 to 1.0µm, both of which are considerably smaller in size than the pixels found in the One’s UltraPixel sensor. Although these smaller pixel sizes were typically necessary to ensure that the camera sensor did not compromise the design of the phone, there were concerns that this could result in a loss of dynamic range and sensitivity, and also result in poor performance in low-light environments. As such, HTC stated that its camera design with larger sensor pixels could notably increase overall image quality, especially in low-light environments. The camera also includes optical <b>image</b> <b>stabilization,</b> and is further enhanced by improvements to the Sense camera software and the ImageChip 2 image processor.|$|E

25|$|Sony has {{modified}} the DSLR formula {{in favor of}} single-lens translucent (SLT) cameras, which are still technically DSLRs, but feature a fixed mirror that allows most light through to the sensor while reflecting some light to the autofocus sensor. Sony's SLTs feature full-time phase detection autofocus during video recording as well as continuous shooting of up to 12 frame/s. The α series, whether traditional SLRs or SLTs, offers in-body sensor-shift <b>image</b> <b>stabilization</b> and retains the Minolta AF lens mount. , the lineup included the Alpha 68, the semipro Alpha 77 II, and the professional full-frame Alpha 99 II. The translucent (transmissive) fixed mirror allows 70 percent of the light to pass through onto the imaging sensor, meaning a 1/3rd stop loss light, {{but the rest of}} this light is continuously reflected onto the camera's phase detection AF sensor for fast autofocus for both the viewfinder and live view on the rear screen, even during video and continuous shooting. The reduced number of moving parts also makes for faster shooting speeds for its class. This arrangement means that the SLT cameras use an electronic viewfinder as opposed to an optical viewfinder, which some consider a disadvantage, but does have the advantage of a live preview of the shot with current settings, anything displayed on the rear screen is displayed on the viewfinder, and handles bright situations well.|$|E

40|$|Airborne platforms, such as UAV's, with Wide Area Motion Imagery (WAMI) sensors {{can cover}} {{multiple}} square kilometers and produce {{large amounts of}} video data. Analyzing all data for information need purposes becomes increasingly labor-intensive for an image analyst. Furthermore, {{the capacity of the}} datalink in operational areas may be inadequate to transfer all data to the ground station. Automatic detection and tracking of people and vehicles enables to send only the most relevant footage to the ground station and assists the image analysts in effective data searches. In this paper, we propose a method for detecting and tracking vehicles in high-resolution WAMI images from a moving airborne platform. For the vehicle detection we use a cascaded set of classifiers, using an Adaboost training algorithm on Haar features. This detector works on individual images and therefore does not depend on <b>image</b> motion <b>stabilization.</b> For the vehicle tracking we use a local template matching algorithm. This approach has two advantages. In the first place, it does not depend on <b>image</b> motion <b>stabilization</b> and it counters the inaccuracy of the GPS data that is embedded in the video data. In the second place, it can find matches when the vehicle detector would miss a certain detection. This results in long tracks even when the imagery is of low frame-rate. In order to minimize false detections, we also integrate height information from a 3 D reconstruction that is created from the same images. By using the locations of buildings and roads, we are able to filter out false detections and increase the performance of the tracker. In this paper we show that the vehicle tracks {{can also be used to}} detect more complex events, such as traffic jams and fast moving vehicles. This enables the image analyst to do a faster and more effective search of the data. © 2015 SPIE...|$|R
