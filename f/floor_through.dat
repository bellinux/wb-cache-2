25|$|The {{method of}} {{construction}} of the torture chamber of the papal palace at Avignon, used during the Inquisition, {{has been described as}} ingenious. The construction of some of the torture chambers at Avignon was based on principles of Acoustics, specifically designed to muffle the screams and cries of the tortured. The walls of the torture chamber recessed and protruded in a complementary fashion to the walls on the opposite side so as to reflect the screams of the victims locally, ensuring that their shrieks would not be carried to the exterior. A chamber located above the main torture chamber had a dungeon with a hole near the middle of the <b>floor</b> <b>through</b> which, according to accounts, the tortured bodies of the prisoners were thrown into a cavity. The chamber where the victims were being burnt was of circular construction and resembled the furnace of a glass-house with a funnel-like chimney at the top.|$|E
500|$|The keep {{comprises}} {{a central}} circular tower, [...] in diameter, with six, large solid buttresses projecting outwards {{to form an}} hexagonal design, unique in England. It was made from magnesian limestone and [...] tall with walls up to [...] thick in places. It has four floors: a ground floor {{that serves as a}} basement and a vaulted stone support for the chamber above; the first <b>floor,</b> <b>through</b> which the keep was accessed; two upper floors and a roof walk, which was probably covered by a pentice and defended by battlements.|$|E

The building includes, from the ground up, retail space, a parking garage, a hotel, and condominiums. The 3rd through 12th floors house lobbies, retail space, and the parking garage; the 14th floor and its mezzanine hosts a health club and spa. The 17th <b>floor</b> <b>through</b> the 27th-floor mezzanine contain hotel condominiums and executive lounges.

500|$|Just {{outside the}} walls of the city, on the {{floodplain}} of the Oued Khoumane, was found a series of interlocking courtyard buildings, of which the largest contained a hammam, or bath. This is an L-shaped structure, with a cold room paved with flagstones and benches running along the sides. At the end is found a plunge pool with three steps leading into it. From the cold room one moved to a vestibule {{at the corner of the}} building, decorated with a relief of a shield taken from the Arch of Caracalla. From there, one moved into the warm room, still covered by a vault, and finally into the hot room. The vault of this has now been restored, but it is possible to see the channels in the <b>floor</b> <b>through</b> which the hot air passed. Beyond this a furnace heated the room, as well as the hot water which would have flowed into basins in the corners. The courtyard of which this hammam formed the western limit was large, and contained numerous large silos for grain storage. To the south of this courtyard was one evidently designed for reception, with long narrow rooms to the east and west, one of which was painted red, with a low bench or divan at one end. Further south a third courtyard, only partially excavated, seems to have been devoted to domestic use. The plan, with its large courtyards and narrow rooms, is very different from the contemporary one or two-roomed structures inside the walls, probably inhabited by the Berbers of the Awraba tribe. It is dated by coins and pottery to the reign of Idris I, and has been identified as his headquarters [...]|$|E

2500|$|At 2:57p.m. 55-year-old failed {{entrepreneur}} Gian Luigi Ferri (born December 29, 1937, as Gianluigi Ettore Ferri) {{entered an}} office building at 101 California Street in San Francisco, {{and made his way}} to the offices of the law firm [...] Pettit & Martin on the 34th floor. Ferri's reason for targeting the firm is unknown; P redirected him to alternative legal counsel about some real estate deals in the Midwest in 1981, and had no contact with him in the 12 years since. They could not advise him on matters out of state. After exiting an elevator, Ferri donned a pair of ear protectors and opened fire with a pair of TEC-9 handguns and a Norinco NP44 (a Chinese-manufactured copy of the Colt M1911 pistol). He reportedly used a mix of Black Talon hollow point and standard ammunition, and used Hellfire trigger systems for the TEC-9 pistols. After roaming the 34th floor, he moved down one <b>floor</b> <b>through</b> an internal staircase and continued shooting. The attack continued on several floors before Ferri committed suicide as San Francisco Police closed in. Eight people were killed in the attack, and six others injured.|$|E
2500|$|LeTourneau has {{a housing}} system {{similar to the}} House System {{with the use of}} {{numerous}} (roughly 30) individual floor assignments as opposed to four houses (which is closer to the House System at Caltech). [...] Housing is generally gender-segregated by building. In years where housing space is limited, one or two residence halls will have housing that is gender-segregated by floor. However, access is limited to each of these floors via Prox cards, which allow only residents into their respective floor areas. Freshmen are placed into floors based upon both building preference and the order in which applications and deposits are received. [...] New students can request a particular <b>floor</b> <b>through</b> their application process, though some are placed at the discretion of Residence Life. [...] Many students remain on the same floor until they graduate from the university, only leaving to move off campus or to on-campus apartments rather than to join another floor.
