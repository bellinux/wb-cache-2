30|$|As already mentioned, 212 papers (90 % of all {{literature}} sources) describe specific complexity <b>drivers</b> <b>in</b> {{manufacturing companies}} {{and along the}} value chain. After analyzing and synthesizing these 212 papers, we identified 223 different literature parts with complexity <b>drivers</b> <b>in</b> manufacturing companies and along the value chain (see Fig.  4 and Table  14 in “Appendix”). Thus, eleven authors have described more than one field of complexity <b>drivers</b> <b>in</b> their publications (see Fig.  4).

40|$|The {{effect of}} motor carrier {{deregulation}} on the employment and earnings of truck drivers is examined, using {{data for the}} period 1973 - 95. The use of a quasi-experimental design is made possible through the comparison of wages before and after deregulation among <b>drivers</b> <b>in</b> the previously regulated for-hire sector, <b>drivers</b> <b>in</b> unregulated private carriage, and an economy-wide group of male non-driver non-professionals. Deregulation is associated with approximately a 15 percent relative wage decline among <b>drivers</b> employed <b>in</b> the for-hire sector, resulting primarily from decreases in union wages and a shift from high-wage union to low-wage nonunion employment. In contrast to wage losses among for-hire union drivers, losses among nonunion drivers relative to workers economy-wide are small. The decline in wages among both union and nonunion <b>drivers</b> <b>in</b> the unregulated private carriage sector largely mirrors wage changes among the male non-driver control group. Our results indicate {{that there was little}} rent sharing during the regulatory period among <b>drivers</b> <b>in</b> unregulated private carriage or among nonunion <b>drivers</b> <b>in</b> the regulated sector. Sizable wage advantages among for-hire drivers and among union <b>drivers</b> <b>in</b> both the for-hire and private sectors have been maintained throughout the deregulation period.
