40|$|The {{case was}} a 27 year-old male, w ho visited the authors' clinic with the {{principal}} complain of lumbago and frequent urination. The patient claimed that hematuria, abdominal pain on the right side, total urination pain etc. were appearing repeatedly since 6 months before he visited the clinic. When e x amined, the lower margin of the right kidney was palpable and tender on pressure; the left kidney was inpalpable, but the patient complained of unpleasant feeling on pressure. No abnormalities {{were found in the}} region along the course of ureter, vesical region, external genital organs, testicles, epididymis and prostate. On cystoscopic examination, the ureteral orifices on both sides were found to be normal, but no excretion of urine and indigo-carmin from the left ureteral orifice was noted. In the X-ray examination, the excretory pyelography demonstrated a hydronephrosis of the right kidney and no sign of excretion was noted from the left kidney. Also in the retrogressive pyelography, the picture of the upper part of ureter, renal pelvis and calyces of the left kidney were found lacking. In view of the above, the cace was diagnosed as suspected hydronephrosis of the right kidney and tumor in the left kidney. Thus, the case underwent nephrectomy of the left kidney. When operated, the left kidney was not found in its normal position. In stead, a goos-egg-sized fatty mass with numerous cystic growths was found. The mass was removed and pathologically and histologically examined. The histological examination of the mas s showed a picture of the obliteration of arteries. No renal cortex or glomeruli were found. Scattered here and there, only cystic cavities lined with cylindrical epithelium and filled with hyaline substance were observed. The pathological histological diagnosis of the case was <b>hypoplasia</b> <b>of</b> <b>kidney.</b> According to referential literatures, the case was recorded as the 44 th case hitherto to reported in Japan...|$|E

40|$|AbstractRenal {{segmental}} hypoplasia (Ask-Upmark kidney) is a congenital disorder, {{first described}} by Eric Ask-Upmark in 1929.

Usually unilateral, bilaterally asymmetrical segmental hypoplasia has also been reported. The pathogenesis <b>of</b> Ask-Upmark <b>kidney</b> is controversial, attributing to vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) with intrarenal reflux or possibility of localized developmental arrest.

40|$|The {{mammalian}} Hox {{complex is}} divided into four linkage groups containing 13 sets of paralogous genes. These paralogous genes have retained functional redundancy during evolution. For this reason, loss of {{only one or two}} Hox genes within a paralogous group often results in incompletely penetrant phenotypes which are difficult to interpret by molecular analysis. For example, mice individually mutant for Hoxa 11 or Hoxd 11 show no discernible kidney abnormalities. Hoxa 11 /Hoxd 11 double mutants, however, demonstrate <b>hypoplasia</b> <b>of</b> the <b>kidneys.</b> As described in this study, removal of the last Hox 11 paralogous member, Hoxc 11, results in the complete loss <b>of</b> metanephric <b>kidney</b> induction. In these triple mutants, the metanephric blastema condenses, and expression of early patterning genes, Pax 2 and Wt 1, is unperturbed. Eya 1 expression is also intact. Six 2 expression, however, is absent, as is expression of the inducing growth factor, Gdnf. In the absence of Gdnf, ureteric bud formation is not initiated. Molecular analysis of this phenotype demonstrates that Hox 11 control of early metanephric induction is accomplished by the interaction of Hox 11 genes with the pax-eya-six regulatory cascade, a pathway that may be used by Hox genes more generally for the induction of multiple structures along the anteroposterior axis...|$|R
40|$|The {{transcription}} factors HNF 1 B and Pax 2, co-expressed in the Wolffian duct and ureteric bud epithelia, play essential roles {{during the}} early steps <b>of</b> mouse <b>kidney</b> development. In humans, heterozygous mutations in these genes display a number <b>of</b> common <b>kidney</b> phenotypes, including hypoplasia and multicystic hypo-plastic kidneys. Moreover, a high prevalence of mutations either in HNF 1 B or PAX 2 has been observed in chil-dren with renal hypodysplasia. To {{gain a better understanding}} of Hnf 1 b and Pax 2 interactions in vivo, we generated compound heterozygous mice for Hnf 1 b and Pax 2 null alleles. We show here that compound het-erozygous mutants display phenotypes similar to severe congenital anomalies <b>of</b> the <b>kidney</b> and the urinary tract (CAKUT), including strong <b>hypoplasia</b> <b>of</b> the <b>kidneys,</b> caudal ectopic aborted ureter buds, duplex kid-neys, megaureters and hydronephrosis. At a molecular level, compound mutants show a delay in nephron segment and medullar interstitial differentiation, increased apoptosis and a transient decrease in Lim 1 and Wnt 4 expression. We also observe a perturbation of smooth muscle differentiation around the ureter asso-ciated with a local down-regulation in transcript levels of Bmp 4 and Tbx 18, two key regulators involved in ureter smooth muscle formation, thus explaining, at least in part, megaureters. These results together un-cover a novel role of Hnf 1 b as a modifier of the Pax 2 haplo-insufficient phenotype and show that these two transcription factors operate in common pathways governing both kidney morphogenesis and ureter dif-ferentiation. This mouse model should provide new insights into the pathogenic mechanisms of human CAKUT, the most frequent developmental defect identified in newborns...|$|R
40|$|Leukoencephalopathy with {{vanishing}} white matter, {{also called}} “childhood ataxia with {{central nervous system}} hypomyelination,” is the first human disease related to mutations {{in any of the}} five genes encoding subunits of eukaryotic initiation factor eIF 2 B or any translation factor at all. eIF 2 B is essential in all cells of the body for protein synthesis and the regulation of this protein synthesis under different stress conditions. It is surprising that mutations in the eIF 2 B genes have been reported to lead to abnormalities of the white matter of the brain only, although it has been shown recently that ovarian failure may accompany the leukoencephalopathy. Another surprising observation is that the onset of the disease varies from early childhood to adulthood, with the exception of Cree leukoencephalopathy, a disease related to a particular mutation in one of the eIF 2 B genes, which invariably has its onset within the first year of life. We analyzed the eIF 2 B genes of nine patients with an antenatal- or early-infantile–onset encephalopathy and an early demise and found mutations in eight of the patients. In addition to signs of a serious encephalopathy, we found oligohydramnios, intrauterine growth retardation, cataracts, pancreatitis, hepatosplenomegaly, <b>hypoplasia</b> <b>of</b> the <b>kidneys,</b> and ovarian dysgenesis. Until now, no evidence had been found for a genotype-phenotype correlation, but the consistently severe phenotype in affected siblings among our patients and in Cree encephalopathy patients suggests an influence of the genotype on the phenotype. <br/...|$|R

40|$|Previously this {{laboratory}} characterized Slc 39 a 8 -encoded ZIP 8 as a Zn 2 + /(HCO 3 –) 2 symporter; yet, {{the overall}} physiological importance of ZIP 8 at the whole-organism level remains unclear. Herein {{we describe the}} phenotype of the hypomorphic Slc 39 a 8 (neo/neo) mouse which has retained the neomycin-resistance gene in intron 3, hence causing significantly decreased ZIP 8 mRNA and protein levels in embryo, fetus, placenta, yolk sac, and several tissues of neonates. The Slc 39 a 8 (neo) allele is associated with diminished zinc and iron uptake in mouse fetal fibroblast and liver-derived cultures; consequently, Slc 39 a 8 (neo/neo) newborns exhibit diminished zinc and iron levels in several tissues. Slc 39 a 8 (neo/neo) homozygotes from gestational day(GD) - 11. 5 onward are pale, growth-stunted, and die between GD 18. 5 and 48 h postnatally. Defects include: severely hypoplastic spleen; <b>hypoplasia</b> <b>of</b> liver, <b>kidney,</b> lung, and lower limbs. Histologically, Slc 39 a 8 (neo/neo) neonates show decreased numbers of hematopoietic islands in yolk sac and liver. Low hemoglobin, hematocrit, red cell count, serum iron, and total iron-binding capacity confirmed severe anemia. Flow cytometry of fetal liver cells revealed the erythroid series strikingly affected in the hypomorph. Zinc-dependent 5 -aminolevulinic acid dehydratase, required for heme synthesis, was not different between Slc 39 a 8 (+/+) and Slc 39 a 8 (neo/neo) offspring. To demonstrate further that the mouse phenotype is due to ZIP 8 deficiency, we bred Slc 39 a 8 (+/neo) with BAC-transgenic BTZIP 8 - 3 line (carrying three extra copies of the Slc 39 a 8 allele); this cross generated viable Slc 39 a 8 (neo/neo) _BTZIP 8 - 3 (+/+) pups showing none of the above-mentione...|$|R
40|$|Background Branchio-oto-renal (BOR) {{syndrome}} is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by branchial, ear, and renal anomalies. The most common gene mutated in BOR patients is EYA 1, the human homolog of the Drosophila eyes absent gene, while mutations in SIX 1 gene, the human homolog of sine oculis, encoding a DNA binding protein interacting with EYA 1, {{have been reported}} less frequently. Recently, mutations in another SIX family member, SIX 5, have been described in BOR patients, however, this association has not been confirmed by other groups. Case presentation In this study, we have clinically and genetically characterized a proband that displayed hearing loss, pre-auricular pits, branchial fistulae, <b>hypoplasia</b> <b>of</b> the left <b>kidney,</b> bilateral mild hydronephrosis, progressive proteinuria and focal glomerulosclerosis. Mutational analysis of EYA 1 gene revealed a novel splice site mutation, c. 1475 + 1 G>C, that affects EYA 1 splicing and produces an aberrant mRNA transcript, lacking exon 15, which is predicted to encode a truncated protein of 456 aa. Conclusion This report provided the functional description of a novel EYA 1 splice site mutation and described {{for the first time}} a case of BOR syndrome associated with the atypical renal finding of focal glomerulosclerosis, highlighting the importance of molecular testing and detailed clinical evaluation to provide accurate diagnosis and appropriate genetic counselling.
