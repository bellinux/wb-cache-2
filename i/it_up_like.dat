The boys James and Henry built a boat and rigged <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>like</b> the side wheelers they had seen on the Hudson River. This they used to take people up the river on excursions and also to carry produce down the river, thus earning money with which to pay their father for the material used to build the boat.|$|E

500|$|In 2010, Richardson {{revealed}} that executive producer Lucy Allan {{was going to}} return Ste to his [...] "bad" [...] ways. Richardson said that Ste had portrayed the whole [...] "bad thing" [...] and mellowed. He felt Ste was emulating fellow character Tony Hutchinson (Nick Pickard), because Ste was [...] "running a restaurant, camping <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>like</b> him and talking like him". Allan wanted to change that and see him regain some old habits. These changes did not happen because Allan quit her position soon after.|$|E
500|$|In 2006, Kapoor played {{opposite}} Kareena Kapoor in two filmsthe thriller 36 China Town and {{the comedy}} Chup Chup Ke. In 36 China Town, a murder mystery from the director duo Abbas–Mustan, Kapoor starred {{as one of}} the seven suspects in the murder of an heiress, and in the Priyadarshan-directed Chup Chup Ke, he played a depressed man who pretends to be deaf and mute. The former was his first commercial success since Ishq Vishk. Greater success came to Kapoor later that year when he starred alongside Amrita Rao in Sooraj Barjatya's romantic drama Vivah, a film depicting an arranged marriage. Made on a shoestring budget of , the film earned over [...] worldwide, and proved to be Kapoor's highest-grossing film to that point. Reviews of the film, however, were negative; Raja Sen termed the film a [...] "nightmare" [...] and wrote that Kapoor [...] "isn't offensively bad, doesn't ham <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>like</b> crazy, or speak in a weird accent. Having said that, he isn't an actor at all, standing around working on his boyish grin, simply chewing up the scenery. No screen presence at all." ...|$|E

500|$|The [...] "Dual Spires enhanced" [...] video at the Psych website lists further {{references}} to Twin Peaks. Shawn's name for Gus in this episode is [...] "Lodge Blackmunn", a direct {{reference to the}} Black and White Lodge. Leo the Cinnamon Owl is a reference to Killer BOB, who possessed Leland Palmer and often {{took the form of}} an owl. The sheriff's deputy is Deputy Frost, named after Twin Peaks co-creator Mark Frost. The doctors of both Dual Spires and Twin Peaks have coconuts in their offices. Both Paula's and Laura's diaries described meetings with [...] "J". Sheriff Jackson tells Bob he needs to be strong for his wife. Dr Hayward says the same thing to Leland Palmer in Twin Peaks. Upon entering the town Gus mentions that the residents are looking {{at him as if he}} were the first black man they had ever seen. There are very few black men in Twin Peaks. When they enter the Sawmill Diner Bob Barker says [...] "Top of the morning to you." [...] In the first season of Twin Peaks, Pete Martell corrected Josie Packard on the saying. Maudette wears an orchid in her hair; Harold grew orchids in Twin Peaks. In the library Shawn asks if they can [...] "poke around" [...] but he and Gus immediately say [...] "peek" [...] in correction. Thus [...] "peek", as in Twin Peaks, is spoken twice. A man wearing a hat in the Sawmill Diner gives Shawn and Gus a thumbs up. The older room service attendant did the same thing to Agent Cooper in Twin Peaks. A record player is featured prominently in both the Barker and Palmer homes. The Roadhouse was also a location in Twin Peaks. Both Maudette and Audrey Horne love to dance. Paula's friend Jack is completely blind in one eye, referencing Twin Peaks' brothel named [...] "One Eyed Jacks". In the library Shawn and Gus find a book entitled [...] "Putt Your Way to a Better Future." [...] After Leland Palmer killed Maddy Ferguson he was seen putting golf balls around in his living room. When Randy is using the table saw it resembles the sawmill scene from the extended opening credits of Twin Peaks. When Maudette is placed in the body bag it is bent in such a way that it resembles a smile, like the smiling bag clue Agent Cooper found. On Maudette's desk beside her computer is a roll of green tape like the kind used by Leland Palmer to tie up Jacques Renault. In the cabin Bob Barker lights a match and holds <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>like</b> Leland Palmer did when describing BOB to Agent Cooper. Bob Barker wears a gold ring on his pinky, something Agent Cooper did in Twin Peaks. In the cabin the walls are red with red drapes as an allusion to the [...] "Red Room" [...] in Agent Cooper's dream.|$|E
2500|$|The {{high winds}} of the {{blizzard}} packed the snow so tightly and high, drifts reached [...] in places; normal snow removal equipment was ineffective, and earth-moving equipment, such as front-end loaders, {{had to be}} used. Colonel Daniel Ludwig of the USACE stated the [...] "snow was very densely packed and that snow plows would be virtually useless {{on most of the}} roads". NWS meteorologist Ben Kolker noted on one of the roads near the NWS forecast office, high lifts were used [...] "to dig away at it and break <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>like</b> big hunks of rock". In Depew, a suburb of Buffalo, volunteer firemen used a trenching machine to get people out of a house that had been drifted shut. The long cleanup period included the railroads, who used front-end loaders to clear snow from the rail yard into open-bodied rail cars and shipped it east by Conrail.|$|E
2500|$|Baggott got {{the idea}} to write Farewell to Reality and become a science activist when {{watching}} the BBC program What is Reality. In his opinion, the program started out well, but became what he calls [...] "fairy tale physics" [...] when it included interviews with theoretical physicists who talked about such ideas as multiverse, superstring theory, and supersymmetry. These topics, according to Baggott, are fascinating to read about and are an entertaining way to make documentaries, sell books, or spend time at parties, but are [...] "abstracted, theoretical speculation without any kind of empirical foundation" [...] and [...] "not science". Farewell to Reality is Baggott's attempt to counteract the [...] "fuzzy science theory" [...] and advocate for evidence and facts. Baggott states, [...] "When you start asking 'Do {{we live in a}} hologram?' Then you are crossing into metaphysics, and you are heading down the path of allowing all kinds of things that have no evidence to back <b>it</b> <b>up,</b> <b>like</b> creationism." ...|$|E

2500|$|The colon is {{wrinkled}} and corrugated, {{somewhat like}} an accordion or a clothes-dryer exhaust tube, which gives it the {{large surface area}} needed for water absorption. [...] In order to inspect this surface thoroughly the physician blows <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>like</b> a balloon, using an air compressor, {{in order to get}} the creases out. [...] The stomach, intestines and colon have a so-called [...] "second brain" [...] wrapped around them, which autonomously runs the chemical factory of digestion. [...] It uses complex hormone signals and nerve signals to communicate with the brain and the rest of the body. [...] Normally a colon's job is to digest food and regulate the intestinal flora. [...] The harmful bacteria in rancid food, for example, creates gas. The colon has distension sensors that can tell when there is unexpected gas pushing the colon walls out—thus the [...] "second brain" [...] tells the person that he or she is having intestinal difficulties by way of the sensation of nausea. [...] Doctors typically recommend either total anaesthesia or a partial twilight sedative to either preclude or to lessen the patient's awareness of pain or discomfort, or just the unusual sensations of the procedure. [...] Once the colon has been inflated, the doctor inspects it with the scope as it is slowly pulled backwards. [...] If any polyps are found they are then cut out for later biopsy.|$|E
2500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Good for You" [...] is a torch {{song and}} a come-hither with themes of intensity, psychodrama, {{self-confidence}} and female self-empowerment, with Gomez singing the hook [...] "I just wanna {{look good for}} you, good for you", as a plea. According to the singer, the track [...] "reps women in a good way" [...] and [...] "does something to a woman when they look good". In an interview for People magazine, she stated: [...] "This song represents the confidence that I truly have inside of me, and I think it's the vulnerable side that I've expressed, but it's also the combination of just feeling myself". It was noted to showcase a shift towards more mature and sexually suggestive subject matter than in Gomez's previous releases. A number of the lyrics attribute syllables {{as a means of}} poetry, namely, [...] "leave this dress a mess on the floor" [...] and [...] "syncopate my skin to your heart beating". Gomez's lyrics specifically deal with pleasing and being the perfect complement for her significant other, by means of wearing skin-tight dresses and doing her [...] "hair up real, real nice". Gomez references the Greek myth of Midas and jewelry retailer Tiffany & Co in the lines [...] "Doing <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>like</b> Midas, mmm" [...] and [...] "I'm on marquise diamond / I'm a marquise diamond / Could even make that Tiffany jealous, mmm". Gomez's lyrics deal with pleasing her lover and being the perfect complement for him, seen in lyrics as [...] "Gonna wear that dress you like, skin-tight / Do my hair up real, real nice". The line [...] "You say I give it to you hard / So bad, so bad / Make you never wanna leave / I won't / I won't" [...] represents a shift towards more mature and sexually suggestive subject matter than Gomez's previous releases.|$|E
