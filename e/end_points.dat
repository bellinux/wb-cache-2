When feed conversion efficiency is adjusted to weight of saleable meat divided by feed consumed, Limousin feed conversion efficiency then exceeds both British and continental European breeds by 10–25%. The USMARC study also indicated that Limousins were very significantly the slowest of all breeds to achieve market specifications of three measures of rib eye fat (300 to 400 days longer than the British breeds, and 170 to 220 days longer than the other continental European breeds) while feed conversion efficiency based on live weight gain was poorer (25–30% less than the British breeds and 12–16% less than the other continental European breeds). When corrected to saleable meat divided by feed consumed, feed conversion efficiency was similar or marginally better for Limousins.

5|$|Rather than {{resubmit}} its 1901 bill, the CLR {{presented a}} much more ambitious alternative for the 1902 parliamentary session. The reversing loops were dropped, and the CLR instead proposed to turn the whole railway into a single large loop by constructing a new southern route between the two existing <b>end</b> <b>points,</b> adopting the committee's recommendation for a Hammersmith to City route. At the western end, new tunnels were to be extended from the dead-end reversing siding west of Shepherd's Bush station and from the depot access tunnel. The route was to pass under Shepherd's Bush Green and run under Goldhawk Road as far as Hammersmith Grove where it was to turn south. At {{the southern end of}} Hammersmith Grove a station was to be provided on the corner of Brook Green Road (now Shepherd's Bush Road) to provide an interchange with the three stations already located there.|$|E

40|$|A {{surrogate}} <b>end</b> <b>point</b> {{is often}} used to evaluate the effects of treatments or exposures on the true <b>end</b> <b>point</b> in medical researches. Various criteria for the statistical surrogate, principal surrogate and strong surrogate have been proposed. We first illustrate that, with a surrogate <b>end</b> <b>point</b> that is defined by these criteria, it is possible that a treatment has a positive effect on the surrogate, which in turn has a positive effect on the true <b>end</b> <b>point,</b> but the treatment has a negative effect on the true <b>end</b> <b>point.</b> We define such a phenomenon as a surrogate paradox. The surrogate paradox also means that the sign of the treatment effect on the true <b>end</b> <b>point</b> is unpredictable by the effect signs of both the treatment on the surrogate and the surrogate on the true <b>end</b> <b>point.</b> Then we propose two notions for a consistent surrogate and a strictly consistent surrogate to avoid the surrogate paradox. With the causal network that was presented by Lauritzen, we discuss the conditions for a strong surrogate to be a consistent surrogate and a strictly consistent surrogate.

40|$|This article {{treats the}} {{question}} of <b>end</b> <b>point</b> trajectory control of a flexible manipulator based on the nonlinear inversion technique. The manipulator has two rigid links and the third link is elastic. A parameterization of the Cartesian coordinates of a point {{close to the end}} effector position is suggested. Using these coordinates as output variables, an inverse feedback control law is derived for tracking reference Cartesian trajectories. The stability of the zero dynamics associated with the <b>end</b> <b>point</b> motion control is examined. It is shown that inverse control of the <b>end</b> <b>point</b> causes divergent oscillatory flexible modes. In addition, for regulating the <b>end</b> <b>point</b> to a fixed position, a linear stabilizer is designed to damp the elastic vibration. Simulation results are presented to show that in the closed-loop system, reference <b>end</b> <b>point</b> trajectories can be accurately followed in spite of the parameter uncertainty in the arm dynamic model...|$|R

25|$|In {{addition}} to {{the determination of the}} precise location of the trigonometric points the Survey established the precise altitude of a number of fundamental benchmarks by spirit levelling over the years 1839 to 1860.

The reference level was the height of Mean Water at Liverpool. 32 <b>end</b> <b>points</b> were connected to tidal stations and therefore the variation of mean water around the country was fixed. The benchmarking proceeded along the roads, but side lines were taken to, and over, many of the mountain top trig points, from which other trig point altitudes were measured by trigonometric levelling. The reports were published in 1861. Unlike the Principal Triangulation report no theory was included in Clarke's levelling reports.|$|E
