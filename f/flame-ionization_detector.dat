40|$|A {{summary of}} the {{strategy}} and progress in devising a general system of biochemical analysis based on the direct photometry, or “scanning ” of thin-media chromatograms is presented. Recent {{results suggest that the}} method is as precise and as accurate as other types of quantitative chromatography. It is capable of reasonably easy adoption by workers previously unfamiliar with the basic technic and apparatus. It has been subjected to more rigorous quality control by blind and double-blind trials concurrent with ordinary routine work than is usual, and has passed these tests adequately. Data processing by a small, relatively inexpensive digital computer is capable of handling the data produced by the central apparatus of the method. The sensitivity of newer instruments using well-established fluorescence reactions compares very favorably with that of <b>flame-ionization</b> <b>detectors</b> in gas-liquid chromatography but not with the electron-capture detector as yet. THE PROGRESS of a long-term project for the automation of complex biochemical analytic methods will be discussed in this paper. In some cases the choice of technics is controversial and is capable of misinter-pretatioii, so that the strategy underlying this work should be outlined first. The first step is to define our aim, which is to devise a general sys-tern of apparatus and technics which enables a reasonably trained scientist to measure traces of complex biochemicals in body fluids or tissue extracts as easily and reliably as he presently measures simple l) iOchemicals such as glucose, sodium, chloride, and bile pigments. The system should enable him to measure as great a variety of substances as possible and in large numbers of samples.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that compost could be used as soil enhancers, in this way compost could has effect not only in {{nutrients}} availability but also in the inhibition of some plant pathogens. The aim of this work was to analyse and determine the volatile fatty acid profile of different compost. Experimental compost (onion compost, green waste compost, spent mushroom compost: SMC and grape mark and olive press cake com-post: GMOP) were elaborated under UE fifth framework Recoveg proyect (Recycling Horticultural was-tes to produce pathogen supressant compost for sustainable vegetal crop production QLRT- 01458). The volatile fatty acids (VFA) were extracted in acid media. VFA content was determined by gas chromato-graphy (<b>flame-ionization</b> <b>detector).</b> The acid extracts were added to a PDA growth media to test its possi-ble inhibitory effect over Sclerotinia cepivorum, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus flavus, Fusarium oxyspo-rum, Phythopthora nicotineae, and Phytium ultimun. The results showed that onion compost is the only sample that has the main VFA content (acetic, propionic and butryric acid), and valeric acid was not detec-ted in any sample. Higher concentration on butyric acid only was found in spent mushroom compost. In green waste compost and grape mark wastes and in olive press cake compost, only trace of this compound were detected. This extract did not show any inhibitory effect on growth of the microbial strains analysed...|$|E
40|$|Individual {{triglyceride}} (TG) {{species of}} olive oil and several seed oils (corn, cottonseed, palm, peanut, soybean, and sunflower) are baseline separated on a WCOT TAP CB fused-silica capillary column by capillary gas chromatography (CGC) with a <b>flame-ionization</b> <b>detector</b> (FID) and either cold on-column or split injection. An adulteration {{of olive oil}} with a low content (< 5 %) of these seed oils (except peanut oil) can be verified by the detection of the increasing levels of trilinolein or tripalmitin in olive oil in which these TG species are normally absent or present at very low levels (< 0. 5 %). An adulteration with over 20 % peanut oil can be detected by the increasing levels of palmitodilinolein. TG species that can be coeluted with trilinolein in the reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic (RP-HPLC) mode are baseline separated by the CGC technique, and their structures are identified by selective ion monitoring mass spectrometry. The following comparisons—the CGC–FID and RP-HPLC methods for detection of adulteration, cold on-column and split-injection modes for CGC–FID, and silylation or thin-layer chromatography pretreatment and simple dilution {{of one or more}} of the oil samples—are also presented. The normalized percentage area of the TG species is sufficient for the method limits used in this study. Mixtures of virgin olive oil with refined or residue olive oil could not be distinguished from the virgin type by the method used in this study...|$|E
40|$|The {{specific}} nitrogen <b>flame-ionization</b> <b>detector</b> {{was used}} for the rapid simultaneous determination of eight anticonvulsant drugs and one drug metabolite in plasma and for three of the drugs in tissues. The system of analysis allows the occasional rapid estimation of barbi-turate in plasma. No derivative formation is required and the whole range of drugs can be determined in a single diethyl ether extract of plasma in about 20 mm. The principal contribution of gas-liquid chroma-tography to clinical chemistry has been in the areas of steroid biochemistry and clinical toxicology. As most drugs contain at least one nitrogen atom, it ap-peared likely that a detector that has increased sensi-tivity and selectivity for organic nitrogen would bring improvements to established toxicological proce-dures. For example, the rapid analysis for basic drugs in urine by Donike et al. (1, 2) at the 20 th Olympic Games first demonstrated in practical terms how the rapid and specific determination of stimulant drugs can be improved by use of the nitrogen detector. In the clinical laboratory, one of the fastest grow-ing areas is the monitoring of anticonvulsant concen-trations in the blood of epileptic patients. In our lab-oratory the number of such plasma samples for anal-ysis has increased from 378 in 1970 to 1713 in 1973, most of them from other hospitals. This assay, as a routine determination, done on a dedicated gas chromatograph with the nitrogen-se-lective detector, has been in use at least 5 days a week, for longer than 18 months...|$|E
