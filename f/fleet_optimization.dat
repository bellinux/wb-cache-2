Aircraft are not being replaced or retired in large numbers but are instead having their lives extended beyond their original design service lives. Because aging aircraft cost more to maintain, this additional burden on air forces is a forcing function for smarter approaches to enhanced structural health monitoring. As data recorder technology has improved and recording capacity has increased, structural health monitoring tools have become more important in understanding aircraft life. Accrued historical data present opportunities for end-of-life <b>fleet</b> <b>optimization.</b> This paper provides a thorough review of the aging aircraft problem and suggests a direction for future end-of-life <b>fleet</b> <b>optimization</b> research.

40|$|Congestion games model a {{wide variety}} of {{real-world}} resource congestion problems, such as selfish network routing, traffic route guidance in congested areas, taxi <b>fleet</b> <b>optimization</b> and crowd movement in busy areas. However, existing research in congestion games assumes: (a) deterministic movement of agents between resources; and (b) perfect rationality (i. e. maximizing their own expected value) of all agents. Such assumptions are not reasonable in dynamic domains where decision support has to be provided to humans. For instance, in optimizing the performance of a taxi fleet serving a city, movement of taxis can be involuntary or nondeterministic (decided by the specific customer who hires the taxi) and more importantly, taxi drivers may not follow advice provided by the decision support system (due to bounded rationality of humans). To that end, we contribute: (a) a general framework for representing congestion games under uncertainty for populations with assorted notions of rationality. (b) a scalable approach for solving the decision problem for perfectly rational agents which are in the mix with boundedly rational agents; and (c) a detailed evaluation on a synthetic and real world data set to illustrate the usefulness of our new approach with respect to key social welfare metrics {{in the context of an}} assorted human-agent population. An interesting result from our experiments on a real-world taxi <b>fleet</b> <b>optimization</b> problem is that it is better (in terms of revenue and operational efficiency) for taxi drivers to follow perfectly rational strategies irrespective of the percentage of drivers not following the advice...|$|E

The task {{is to determine the}} optimal capacity and location of the support network of warehouses in the region, as well as power, composition and location of motor <b>fleets.</b> <b>Optimization</b> is carried out using mathematical models of a regional warehouse network and a network of motor fleets. These models are presented as mathematical programming problems with separable functions. The process of finding the optimal solution of problems is complicated due to high dimensionality, non-linearity of functions, and the fact that a part of variables are constrained to integer, and some variables can take values only from a discrete set. Given the mentioned above complications search for an exact solution was rejected. The article {{suggests an}} approximate approach to solving problems. This approach employs effective computational schemes for solving multidimensional optimization problems. We use the continuous relaxation of the original problem to obtain its approximate solution. An approximately optimal solution of continuous relaxation is taken as an approximate solution of the original problem. The suggested solution method implies linearization of the obtained continuous relaxation and use of the separable programming scheme and the scheme of branches and bounds. We describe the use of the simplex method for solving the linearized continuous relaxation of the original problem and the specific moments of the branches and bounds method implementation.

To make the right decisions on equipment repair, rebuilding, disposal, or equipment <b>fleet</b> <b>optimization</b> to maximize the return of investment, the contractors need to predict the residual value of heavy construction equipment to an acceptable level of accuracy. Current practice of using rule-ofthumb or statistical regression methods cannot satisfactorily capture the dynamic relationship between the residual value of a piece of heavy equipment and its influencing factors, and such rules or models are difficult to integrate into a decision support system. This paper introduces a data mining based approach for estimating the residual value of heavy construction equipment using a predictive data mining model, and its potential benefits on the decision making of construction equipment management. Compared to the current practice of assessing equipment residual values, the proposed approach demonstrates advantages of ease of use, better interpretability, and adequate accuracy...|$|E

An {{increased}} {{electric drive}} vehicle (EDV) use is expected in the future due to the rapid development of new EDV technologies, increased environmental concerns, increasing petroleum-based fuel prices {{and the possibility of}} EDV participation on electricity markets. In this paper, an optimization algorithm for EDV charging and discharging for electricity-spot market participation is presented. The use of the presented algorithm would bring lower EDV driving costs for its users and a competitive advantage for the EDV electricity provider that would use the EDV batteries as a storage system in order to purchase and sell additionally stored energy on the electricity market. To simplify the optimization algorithm, individual EDVs are grouped into larger EDV fleets. The use of EDV fleets introduces a constant number of optimization variables in the optimization process.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis is on the {{integration}} of and interplay between demand driven dispatch and revenue management in a competitive airline network environment. Demand driven dispatch is the reassignment of aircraft to flights close to departure to improve operating profitability. Previous studies on demand driven dispatch have not incorporated competition and have typically ignored or significantly simplified revenue management. All simulations in this thesis use the PODS simulator, where stochastic demand by market chooses between competing airlines with alternative paths and fare products whose availability is determined by industry-typical revenue management systems. Demand driven dispatch (D³) is tested {{with a variety of}} methods and objectives, including a bookings-based method that assigns the largest aircraft to the flights with the highest forecasted demands. More sophisticated methods include revenue- and profit-maximizing <b>fleet</b> <b>optimizations</b> that directly use the output of leg-based and network-based RM systems and a minimum-cost flow specification. D³ is then tested with a variety of aircraft swap timings, RM systems, and competitive scenarios. Sensitivity testing is performed at a variety of demand levels, demand variability levels, and with an optimized static fleet assignment. Findings include important competitive feedbacks from D³, relationships between D³ and both revenue management and pricing, and important nuances to D³'s relationship with the level and variability of demand. Depending on how it is implemented, D³ may harm competitor airlines more than it aids the implementer. Early swaps in D³ lead to heavy dilution. Late swaps lead to smaller increases in loads but substantial increases in revenue. The relationship between revenue-maximization and cost-minimization in profit-maximizing D³ is highly influenced by the timing of swaps, revenue estimation, and demand levels. Finally, early swaps are susceptible to high variability of demand while late swaps are more robust. Findings indicate that the benefits of D³ can be estimated at operating profit gains of 0. 04 % to 2. 03 %, revenue gains of 0. 02 % to 0. 88 %, and changes in operating costs of - 0. 08 % to 0. 13 %. by Daniel G.

Therefore, chemical companies constantly try to optimize the fleets as part of major working capital optimization initiatives. We study a complex rail car <b>fleet</b> <b>optimization</b> problem observed at BASF and an approach to tackle the problem in a sequential way. We develop a mixed integer non-linear programming model to derive suggestions to the questions: (i) How many different rail car sizes {{in terms of volume}} are appropriate and what are their optimal volumes? and (ii) For each volume, what is the optimal number of rail cars of this size? The model formulation takes into account various real-world restrictions concerning the volume and weight of the rail cars as well as the tracks that they run on. We propose two solution methods. First, we reformulate the non-linear terms, which results in a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model. This model can be solved in a reasonable amount of time, if the number of different rail car sizes is small (2 or 3). Second, we develop a two-step approach that uses an enumeration scheme in the first stage to find good initial solutions that are fed into the MILP formulation in the second stage. This approach solves the model for larger numbers of different rail car sizes (4 or 5). Through the fleet redesign BASF has realized cost savings of nearly 2 million euros so far...|$|E

In a previously related research, a customized Paired Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Window and Charging Station (PPDPTWCS) had been formulated to solve for the minimum number of taxis that would serve a fixed set of customer demand. The concept behind this <b>fleet</b> <b>optimization</b> was to chain multiple customer trips and trips to Charging Stations (CSs) to form a route and assigned to a taxi driver. In this paper {{the sensitivity of the}} ET fleet’s operations with respect to network sizes, customer demand densities and number of CSs have been investigated. It also analyzed the market shares of the CSs and the occupancy of a CS over time. The results showed that, (1) the expansion of network size or the increase in customer demand density led to increase in fleet size, number of trips to the CSs and maximum occupancies at the CSs but these performance measures grew at different rates; (2) when the network size and number of CSs were fixed, an increase in customer demand density led to a better utilization of taxis in terms of more customers served per taxi and higher average revenue per taxi; (3) given the same network size and demand density, the ET fleet’s performance was relatively insensitive to the number of CSs; and (4) the usage of individual CS was affected by the number of CS and their locations; and (5) when all the ETs were fully charged {{at the beginning of the}} same shift hour, they visited the CSs in bunches when their batteries were about to run out. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the operations of the ET fleet and the CSs. They could be used for making better decisions in the planning of ET operations...|$|E

The research and development within optimization of standby vessel design is limited. The objective of this thesis has been to utilize {{the state of the}} art within the areas of maritime <b>fleet</b> <b>optimization,</b> ship design optimization and the analytical hierarchy process in the development of a working model. Application of emergency preparedness assessment processes in the North Sea as quantifiable mathematical restrictions is also addressed. By developing a linear {{optimization model}}, and implementing it into optimization software, a possible solution in finding the optimal design of a standby base has been approached. The scope of the thesis has been to find the basic design of the standby base, its attributes and the fleet of cooperating standby vessels with the minimum total cost and satisfactory emergency preparedness. As an addition, the model has also been extended with a weighted objective function considering the trade-off between cost and emergency preparedness. In order to investigate the behavior of the model in producing the optimal design and functionality of a standby base, it was tested on a case study for future petroleum development near Jan Mayen. The results revealed a significant cost reduction when the standby base was implemented as apposed to only standby vessels. It also revealed that different design options proved more appropriate as a standby base when the data was run for the original model and the weighted objective function extension. Because of the limited state of the art connected to optimizing the design of standby vessels, the model in this thesis is a version of what I consider to be a possible way of developing a tool in aiding naval architects. Because of the model?s use of expert judgments, obtaining applicable results demands extensive work connected to data pre-processing. </p...|$|E

Key findings include: the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) purchase cost subsidy has the highest impact on the optimal replacement policies; without FTA subsidy it is always cost effective to adopt diesel buses and replace them every 20 years. With an 80 % purchase cost FTA subsidy, hybrid buses are the best choice; the optimal hybrid bus replacement cycle decreases from 18 to 14 years with increasing annual utilizations and operating and maintenance costs or decreasing hybrid purchase price and fuel economy. Fuel price, emissions costs, and initial bus age have little impact on optimal replacement policies. However, discount rate and diesel bus price, annual utilization (in 0 % FTA subsidy scenario) and fuel price (in 80 % FTA subsidy scenario) have the highest impacts on per-mile costs...|$|R
30|$|Li and Yu [9] show {{in their}} {{contribution}} how freight apps can reduce CO 2 transport emission. Globally such apps make possible a better match between {{supply and demand}} of freight transport for interurban and urban freight transport. The freight apps have to be interpreted as an ICT application that provides “freight distribution, management, and other services for freight stakeholders” (ibid. p. 36). One main expected outcome among others (higher profit, higher use of capital, higher level of service for consumers, etc.) is the contribution to a better livable city by contributing to the reduction of atmospheric pollution. The ICT is an integrating technology driving to a reduction of transaction costs between actors that then can be more efficient and a better <b>fleet</b> management and <b>optimization.</b> With the spreading of freight apps, {{it is expected that}} real-time navigation and route planning strengthen the average utilization of vehicles on laden trips, scale economies and a reduction of energy consumption and pollution. However, as the authors emphasize it, it is not a magic solution. It requires a well-designed framework involving different scales (vehicles, loads, company, supply chain and freight network). For being effective, such an app has to be well spread among the different freight stakeholders (to constitute a real network) for being efficient, because it is a network service or club good. It raises also some concerns related to its price, acceptance by the user and its utility for the industry.|$|R
40|$|Aerial {{refueling}} is {{an integral}} part of the United States military's ability to strike targets around the world with an overwhelming and continuous projection of force. However, with an aging fleet of refueling tankers and an indefinite replacement schedule the optimization of tanker usage is vital to national security. Optimizing tanker and receiver refueling operations is a complicated endeavor as it can involve over a thousand of missions during a 24 hour period, as in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom. Therefore, a planning model which increases receiver mission capability, while reducing demands on tankers, can be used by the military to extend the capabilities of the current tanker <b>fleet.</b> Aerial refueling <b>optimization</b> software, created in CASTLE Laboratory, solves the aerial refueling problem through a multi-period approximation dynamic programming approach. The multi-period approach is built around sequential linear programs, which incorporate value functions, to find the optimal refueling tracks for receivers and tankers. The use of value functions allows for a solution which optimizes over the entire horizon of the planning period. This approach varies greatly from the myopic optimization currently in use by the Air Force and produces superior results. The aerial refueling model produces fast, consistent, robust results which require fewer tankers than current planning methods. The results are flexible enough to incorporate stochastic inputs, such as: varying refueling times and receiver mission loads, while still meeting all receiver refueling requirements. The model's ability to handle real world uncertainties while optimizing better than current methods provides a great leap forward in aerial refueling optimization. The aerial refueling model, created in CASTLE Lab, can extend the capabilities of the current tanker fleet. Contract number: N 00244 - 99 -G- 0019 US Navy (USN) author...|$|R
