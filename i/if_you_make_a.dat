500|$|Bridges {{opined that}} Tron: Legacy was evocative {{of a modern}} myth, adding that ideas {{alluding}} to technological advancement were prevalent throughout the film. To Cyriaque Lamar of io9, the film's approach to technology was reminiscent of a kōan. [...] "One {{of the things that}} brought me to this film," [...] affirmed Bridges, [...] "was the idea of helping to create a modern-day myth to help us navigate through these technological waters [...] I dig immediate gratification as much as anybody, but it happens so fast that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> decision like that, you can go far down the wrong path. Think about those plastic single-use water bottles. Where did that come from? Who decided that? You can have a couple of swigs of water [...] and those bottles don't disintegrate entirely. Microscopic animals eat the plastic, and the fish eat those, and we're all connected. It's a finite situation here." ...|$|E
500|$|Formula One World Champion Jody Scheckter, {{whose son}} Tomas was {{involved}} in the accident, was highly critical of the series organizers, stating that a serious accident was [...] "inevitable" [...] as [...] "they were basically touching wheels at [...] They all bunch up together so there are thirty-four cars in a small space of track. One person makes a mistake and this happens. You [...] have to get killed <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> mistake. It was madness." [...] Former Formula One and IndyCar driver Mark Blundell agreed, claiming that the Las Vegas circuit was unsuitable for IndyCar racing – this was the last race for the Dallara IR05 – while NASCAR Sprint Cup Series champion Jimmie Johnson called for the series to leave oval racing altogether, though he clarified his statement by saying that the open-wheel type cars on a resurfaced [...] track built for the heavier Sprint Cup and Nationwide Series cars was a bad idea. However, former champion Mario Andretti said that the accident was a [...] "freakish" [...] one-off incident and that facilities at the circuit were adequate for racing. While he admitted surprise that more drivers were not seriously injured, he also cautioned against what he called [...] "knee-jerk reactions" [...] to the accident, calling for any changes to the sport to be carefully considered before being introduced, rather than being rushed into action. Former Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) President Max Mosley, a long-time advocate of increased safety in motorsport, agreed with Andretti, urging a [...] "calm and scientific" [...] approach to any proposed changes, particularly when asked about the proposed introduction of closed canopies for open-wheel racing cars.|$|E
2500|$|Blomkamp {{wanted the}} aliens to {{maintain}} both humanistic and barbaric {{features in the}} design of the creatures. According to Terri Tatchell, the director's writing partner, [...] "They are not appealing, they are not cute, and they don't tug at our heartstrings. He went for a scary, hard, warrior-looking alien, which is much more of a challenge." [...] The look of the alien, with its exoskeleton-crustacean hybrid and crab-like shells, was meant to initially evoke a sense of disgust from viewers but as the story progresses, the audience was meant to sympathize with these creatures who had such human-like emotions and characteristics. Blomkamp established criteria for the design of the aliens. He wanted the species to be insect-like but also bipedal. The director wanted the audience to relate to the aliens and said of the restriction on the creature design, [...] "Unfortunately, they had to be human-esque because our psychology doesn't allow us to really empathize with something unless it has a face and an anthropomorphic shape. Like if you see something that's four-legged, you think it's a dog; that's just how we're wired... <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> film about an alien force, which is the oppressor or aggressor, and you don't want to empathize with them, you can go to town. So creatively that's what I wanted to do but story-wise, I just couldn't." ...|$|E

6000|$|Of all {{the virtues}} {{that the young}} should have. He spoke of courage and how splendid it was to accustom oneself not even to feel fear; of truth, and {{difficult}} cases when one might conceivably injure others by {{telling the truth and}} so perhaps, perhaps qualify the rigor of one's integrity, but how one should never hesitate to injure one's own self in that matter. Then in another phase he talked of belief--and the disagreeableness of dissenters. But here, I remember, there was a discussion. I have forgotten how I put the thing, but in some boyish phrasing or other I must have thrown out the idea that thought is free and beliefs uncontrollable. What of conformity, if the truth was that you doubted? [...] "Not <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> effort," [...] I remember him saying, [...] "not <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> effort. I have had my struggles.

2500|$|Felix Felicis, more {{commonly}} known as Liquid Luck, grants whoever drinks it unusually good luck. The time span of this luck depends on the amount imbibed. Liquid Luck {{is one of the}} hardest potions to make, as noted by Horace Slughorn; [...] "It has to be cooked for 6 months on an extremely complicated formula, and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> tiniest mistake, the consequences are severe". Because of its properties, it is banned in all sporting events, competitions and examinations. In Rowling's original narrative, the potion looks akin to liquid gold. However, in the movie adaptation it is clear and water-like. Slughorn also noted that excessive consumption results in side effects that include giddiness and overzealousness, among other effects that are related to overconfidence. In Half-Blood Prince, Harry pretends to give some to Ron so that he will do well at Quidditch. Ron's luck turns for the better, with the confidence working as a placebo. Harry does use most of it later in the same novel in order to extract the true memory about Tom Riddle and Horcruxes from Slughorn (though it also has the pleasant side effect of causing Dean Thomas and Ginny Weasley to end their relationship), and the rest is shared between Ron, Hermione, Neville Longbottom and Ginny the night Death Eaters break into Hogwarts.|$|E
