5|$|Bronchopulmonary {{dysplasia}} {{is among}} the most common complications of prematurely born infants and its incidence has grown as the survival of extremely premature infants has increased.

5|$|In {{addition}} to these natural attractions, human involvement in the area is also responsible for making tourism {{a large part of}} the regional economy. Every year, around 6.5—7million people visit the Zenkō-ji Buddhist template in Nagano. It is believed that visiting the template will grant salvation. This <b>has</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> head temple of the Tendai sect being a significant attraction for tourists throughout its 1,400-year history.|$|E

25|$|The Caliphate of Damascus : Formed {{after the}} {{collapse}} of the Ottoman Empire during the Fall, the Caliphate stretches from Persia to Hungary. Although not nearly as advanced as the Raj or Dai-Nippon, the Caliphate represents a daunting threat to any potential invader. Skirmishes with France-outre-Mer <b>have</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> loss of Sicily, and skirmishes with <b>the</b> Raj <b>have</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> loss of Zanzibar, Bahrain, and Aden.

5|$|The area is {{underlain}} by Black Rock slate, Burrington Oolite and Clifton Down Limestone of the Carboniferous Limestone Series, {{which contain}} ooliths and fossil debris {{on top of}} Old Red Sandstone, and by Dolomitic Conglomerate of the Keuper.

In many places weathering of these strata <b>has</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> formation of immature calcareous soils.|$|E
5|$|The major {{software}} companies in Mysore are Infosys, ArisGlobal, Larsen & Toubro Infotech, Excelsoft Technologies and Triveni Engineering.

5|$|Whitefish and vendace are {{the most}} common fish species in Lake Inari, the latter having been accidentally naturalized. Lake trout can be caught in creeks. Other fish found in the park include Arctic char, grayling, pike, perch, burbot, three-spined stickleback, ninespine stickleback and minnow. Stocking with fish <b>has</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{introduction}} of Atlantic salmon, vendace and lake trout.|$|E
5|$|A {{collaboration}} between the Welland Rivers Trust, the Wild Trout Trust and the Environment Agency <b>has</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> construction of a rock ramp, to allow migrating sea trout to pass up the river beyond the weir on the Maxey Cut, which was acting as a barrier. Some 300 tons of rock, with 50 tons of finer material forming a top layer, were used to create the ramp. The finer material ensures that water mainly flows over the ramp, rather than through it. The ramp also enables young eels or elvers {{to move up the}} river, and provides habitat for stone loach and bullheads.|$|E
5|$|AML {{is treated}} {{initially}} with chemotherapy aimed at inducing remission; people may {{go on to}} receive additional chemotherapy or a hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Recent research into the genetics of AML <b>has</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> availability of tests that can predict which drug or drugs may work best for a particular person, {{as well as how}} long that person is likely to survive. The treatment and prognosis of AML differ from those of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in part because the cellular differentiation is not the same; AML involves higher percentages of dedifferentiated and undifferentiated cells, including more blasts (myeloblasts, monoblasts, and megakaryoblasts).|$|E

Beyond being a popular location for battlefield tours the site is also an important location in the burgeoning field of First World War battlefield archaeology, because of its preserved and largely undisturbed state. The ever-increasing number of visitors to the Memorial <b>has</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> authorities taking measures to control access by fencing off certain areas of the former battlefield.|$|E
5|$|Comparatively, machinimists using pre-made virtual {{platforms}} like Second Life {{have indicated}} that their productions can be made quite successfully with no cost at all. Creators like Dutch director Chantal Harvey, producer of the 48 Hour Film Project Machinima sector, have created upwards of 200 films using the platform. Harvey's advocacy of the genre <b>has</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> involvement of film director Peter Greenaway {{who served as a}} juror for the Machinima category and gave a keynote speech during the event.|$|E
5|$|Controversies over shoeing rules, {{concerns}} about soring and the breed industry's {{compliance with the}} Horse Protection Act <b>has</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> development of multiple governing organizations. The breed registry is kept by the TWHBEA which promotes all riding disciplines within the breed, but does not sanction horse shows.

5|$|Except for chemicals, {{all of the}} old {{industries}} have disappeared {{and there has been}} diversification, in particular because of the close links to the motorway system and the development of warehousing and distribution centres. A new town was built to the east of the existing town in the 1960s and 1970s, and areas of private housing have been established farther to the east; this <b>has</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> population more than doubling from around 26,000 to its present level of 70,000.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, the mammals were {{comprehensively}} revised by Malcolm C. McKenna and Susan K. Bell, which <b>has</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> McKenna/Bell classification. Their 1997 book, Classification of Mammals {{above the}} Species Level, {{is a comprehensive}} work on the systematics, relationships and occurrences of all mammal taxa, living and extinct, down through the rank of genus, though molecular genetic data challenge several of the higher level groupings. The authors worked together as paleontologists at the American Museum of Natural History, New York. McKenna inherited the project from Simpson and, with Bell, constructed a completely updated hierarchical system, covering living and extinct taxa that reflects the historical genealogy of Mammalia.|$|E
5|$|In ancient times, the addax {{occurred}} from Northern Africa through Arabia and the Levant. Pictures in a tomb, {{dating back}} to the 2500 BCE show at least the partial domestication of the addax by the ancient Egyptians. These pictures show addax and some other antelopes tied with ropes to stakes. The number of addax captured by a person were considered an indicator of his high social and economic position in the society. But today excess poaching <b>has</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> extinction of this species in Egypt since the 1960s.|$|E

5|$|Plant recolonization and {{succession}} {{has occurred}} in Glacier Bay {{as a result of}} the retreat of the glacier bay in the last about 300 years. The succession, which occurred in the new wilderness of Glacier Bay was stated to be a raw landscape. A simile given is that “It was like seeing an owl with no feathers”. A vegetative wilderness has been created, which <b>has</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> coastal forest. 333 Vascular plant species of individual taxa have been recorded in the Glacier Bay. Dense thickets of Sitka alder and devil's club abound along the shoreline.|$|E
