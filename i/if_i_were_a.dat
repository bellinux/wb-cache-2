The jibaro song, Joven Contra Viejo (Young Against Old) featured Héctor Lavoe and Daniel Santos settling their age-based differences on-stage, but {{not without}} {{a heavy dose of}} humor and (yet again) Yomo Toro's cuatro music as a backdrop. It included a song from Poventud Una Pena en La Navidad. (A Pain in Christmas).|$|E

[...] "God is my witness", he explained, [...] "I could have abstained longer than the weal of my country could have permitted, [...] my long delay bred in the breasts of many a great jealousy of my inability, as <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> barren stock." [...] On 20 August 1589, Anne was married by proxy to James at Kronborg Castle, the ceremony ending with James' representative, George Keith, 5th Earl Marischal, sitting next to Anne on the bridal bed.|$|E

500|$|Rice {{initially}} {{expressed an}} adamant stance against fan fiction {{based on her}} works, and particularly in opposition to such fiction based on The Vampire Chronicles, releasing a statement on April 7, 2000, that disallowed all such efforts, citing copyright issues. She subsequently requested that FanFiction.Net remove stories featuring her characters. In 2012, Metro reported that Rice developed a milder stance on the issue. [...] "I got upset about 20 years ago because I thought it would block me," [...] she said. [...] "However, it's been very easy to avoid reading any, so live and let live. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> young writer, I'd want to own my own ideas. But maybe fan fiction is a transitional phase: whatever gets you there, gets you there." ...|$|E
500|$|The part of John Munch {{was based}} on Jay Landsman, a {{practical}} joker who was known in his homicide unit for his morbid wit. Both Belzer and the character Munch he portrays are cynical, caustic former hippies who are so similar that Belzer declared the character [...] "exactly as I would be <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> cop". Stanley Bolander was inspired by Detective Donald Worden who, like his on-screen counterpart, was nicknamed [...] "The Big Man". Ned Beatty only met Worden once before taking on the role, {{and he said the}} detective had [...] "an uncluttered mind and a near-photographic memory". Beau Felton {{was based on}} Detective Donald Kincaid, and Felton's clashes with Pembleton were based on Kincaid's real-life strong dislike for Harry Edgerton. Kay Howard was based in part on the female Detective Bert Silver, and in part on the male Detective Rich Garvey, who experienced a real-life string of good luck in solving consecutive cases, just as Howard did in the first season.|$|E

500|$|After Jean's {{version of}} [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] was {{rejected}} by her record company, she was upset that Beyoncé recorded and released the ballad. Roger Friedman of Fox News wrote that Jean was first informed that Beyoncé recorded the song by a stranger. The Daily Telegraph reported that Beyoncé's father and then-manager Mathew Knowles pursued the publishing rights of [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] after realizing that it {{had the potential to}} become a big hit. Jean used her Myspace account to express her frustration: [...] "I have been reading some of these comments and {{to set the record straight}} from the horse's mouth – <b>IF</b> <b>I</b> <b>WERE</b> <b>A</b> BOY is my song; YES, I wrote this song; It is my story; a painful one, and the song is very dear to me. You can hear the original version on my myspace site." [...] Friedman later reported that Beyoncé and Jean had come to terms. The deal included a promise that Beyoncé would record a duet with Jean for her debut album.|$|E
500|$|Sean Gregory of Time {{wrote of}} Lin's zero Division I {{scholarship}} offers: [...] " [...] was scrawny, but don't doubt {{that a little}} racial profiling, intentional or otherwise, contributed to his underrecruitment." [...] Diepenbrock stated, [...] "If [...] was African American or Caucasian, {{it might have been}} a different deal"; he did not think Lin's race affected his recruiting until later seeing 10 Division I coaches express interest in a black student who Diepenbrock assessed as [...] "a nice junior college player". Lin said: [...] "I'm not saying top-5 state automatically gets you offers, but I do think [...] did affect the way coaches recruited me. I think <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> different race, I would've been treated differently." [...] Walters added, [...] "People who don't think stereotypes exist are crazy. If [...] white, he's either a good shooter or heady. If he's Asian, he's good at math. We're not taking him." [...] During Lin's college career, fewer than 0.5% of men's Division 1 basketball players were Asian-American.|$|E
500|$|Charles Aaron from Spin {{described}} the song as [...] "slinking through [...] low-ridin', gum-smackin' groove, Maddy's hard-bitten ingenue expresses no regrets, {{but this time}} you feel for her." [...] Aaron highlighted the lyrics [...] "Would it sound better <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> man?" [...] as subversive and coy. Author Lucy O'Brien described in her book, , that [...] "Human Nature" [...] {{was one of the}} [...] "quirkiest" [...] tracks on Bedtime Stories, [...] "throbbing with a tightly restrained but devastating anger". For Barry Walters from Moscow-Pullman Daily News, the song had the catchiest chorus among all the other tracks from the album. Jim Farber from Entertainment Weekly gave the song a negative review, noting that Madonna's [...] "on far surer ground thrashing through such neurotic (if not uncommon) views of relationships than she is trashing the media. In striking back at her critics, Madonna simply sounds self-righteous and smug. 'I didn't know I couldn't talk about sex,' she sneers in 'Human Nature'. 'Did I say something true?' Yes. But tooting your own horn about it just sounds petty". Rooksby said that the repetition of the sample was [...] "wearing" [...] and it [...] "did not suggest that the world of the singer was very appealing".|$|E

But I am so incensed against the oppresions from England, and have so little regard to the laws they make, that I do, as a clergyman, encourage the merchants both to export wool and woollen manufactures to any country in Europe, or anywhere else, and conceal it from the Custom-house officers, as I would hide my purse from a highwayman, if he came to rob me on the road, although England hath made a law to the contrary; and so I would encourage our booksellers here to sell your author's books printed here, and send them to all the towns in England, if I could do it with safety and profit; because I repeat, it is no offence against God, or the laws of the country I live in.|$|E
500|$|In June 1837 Chopin visited London incognito in {{the company}} of the piano {{manufacturer}} Camille Pleyel where he played at a musical soirée at the house of English piano maker James Broadwood. On his return to Paris, his association with Sand began in earnest, {{and by the end of}} June 1838 they had become lovers. Sand, who was six years older than the composer, and who had had a series of lovers, wrote at this time: [...] "I must say I was confused and amazed at the effect this little creature had on me... I have still not recovered from my astonishment, and <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> proud person I should be feeling humiliated at having been carried away..." [...] The two spent a miserable winter on Majorca (8 November 1838 to 13 February 1839), where, together with Sand's two children, they had journeyed in the hope of improving the health of Chopin and that of Sand's 15-year-old son Maurice, and also to escape the threats of Sand's former lover Félicien Mallefille. After discovering that the couple were not married, the deeply traditional Catholic people of Majorca became inhospitable, making accommodation difficult to find. This compelled the group to take lodgings in a former Carthusian monastery in Valldemossa, which gave little shelter from the cold winter weather.|$|E
