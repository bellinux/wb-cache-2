5|$|According to David A. Norris, {{a scholar}} specializing in Serbian {{cultural}} history, conditions in 19th-century Serbia were unsuitable {{for the development}} of visual art. Materials were difficult to come by, studio and exhibition spaces were virtually non-existent, and there were no art patrons willing to financially support painters and purchase their <b>finished</b> <b>works.</b> In {{the first half of the}} 19th century, Serbian visual artists dedicated themselves almost exclusively to decorating the walls of churches and producing icons and other religious objects. There were some painters of Serb heritage living outside Serbia, such as Uroš Knežević and Jovan Popović, who resided in the Austrian Empire.|$|E
25|$|Over a dozen initial {{sketches}} and painted studies of local farmworkers {{were made by}} Cézanne {{in preparation for the}} final paintings. It has been speculated his models sat for the studies rather than the <b>finished</b> <b>works</b> themselves, and the painter possibly sketched preliminary work in an Aix cafe.|$|E
25|$|After a brief {{experimentation}} with oils, Xul chose the watercolors and tempera {{that would become}} his preferred media. Instead of large-scale canvases, Xul painted on small sheets of paper, sometimes mounting his <b>finished</b> <b>works</b> on sheets of cardboard. One of his early works in what would become his signature format, Entierro demonstrates the confluence of Xul's internal thoughts and external influences.|$|E

40|$|The {{ultimate}} goal of construction is to complete the given work in the most economical and safest way within the required construction period while meeting the quality standards specified in the design drawing. There are a few characteristics of <b>finish</b> <b>work.</b> First, executed in subdivided processes, <b>finish</b> <b>work</b> involves a very diverse and complex structure. Second, there are no criteria for each segmented process {{with regard to the}} appropriate time of input. Third, it is not very necessary to set priorities for lead and lag works. This study intends to provide information on the completion of a project in accordance with the required duration by setting priorities in the delay of each detailed process of <b>finish</b> <b>work</b> to minimize delay in <b>finish</b> <b>work.</b> In this study, <b>finish</b> <b>work</b> is divided into wet work and other types of <b>finish</b> <b>work,</b> and the importance of each process is classified based on the given details of each process.

25|$|A {{fairly small}} number of {{landscape}} pen and wash drawings or watercolours made in England played {{an important part in}} introducing the Flemish watercolour landscape tradition to England. Some are studies, which reappear in the background of paintings, but many are signed and dated and were probably regarded as <b>finished</b> <b>works</b> to be given as presents. Several of the most detailed are of Rye, a port for ships to the Continent, suggesting that van Dyck did them casually whilst waiting for wind or tide to improve.|$|E
25|$|On {{completion}} of the canal, the owning company was constantly short of cash, and inevitably income did not reach the levels predicted at the stage of promoting the canal. In addition, serious problems {{with the state of}} the newly <b>finished</b> <b>works</b> were discovered, although in the circumstances of a locally promoted scheme with novel technological aspects, the canal as built was better engineered than it might have been. The chains on the inclined planes were constantly breaking, the rails broke, and other mechanical failures were frequent, and physical damage from careless boat handling was also common.|$|E
25|$|Painting classes, and {{professional}} artists doing <b>finished</b> <b>works</b> often require clothed or costumed models who take poses {{that may be}} sustained until the work is completed. This creates some demand for clothed models in those schools that continue to teach academic painting methods. Some models may promote their services based upon having interesting or varied costumes. Clothing is required in public venues, such as Dr Sketchy's Anti-Art School, but occurs in more traditional settings as well, such as the fund-raising marathons sponsored by the Bay Area Models Guild. Other than costumes, the work requirements and conditions of clothed models for art are identical to that of nude models.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Finished</b> <b>Work</b> is a {{doctrine}} that locates sanctification {{at the time}} of conversion, afterward the converted Christian progressively grows in grace. This is contrary to the doctrine of entire sanctification that locates complete sanctification in a definite [...] "second work" [...] of grace which is a necessary prerequisite to receive the baptism in the Holy Spirit. The term <b>finished</b> <b>work</b> arises from the aphorism [...] "It's a <b>Finished</b> <b>Work</b> at Calvary", referring to both salvation and sanctification. Though the term is used within Pentecostal Christianity, it is not exclusively a Pentecostal doctrine.|$|R

25|$|Unlike Cole's {{first major}} series, The Course of Empire, {{which focused on}} the stages of civilization as a whole, The Voyage of Life series is a more personal, Christian allegory that interprets {{visually}} the journey of man through four stages of life: infancy, youth, manhood and old age. Done on commission, the <b>finished</b> <b>works</b> generated a disagreement with the owner about a public exhibition. In 1842, when Cole was in Rome, he did {{a second set of}} the series which on his return to America was shown to acclaim. The first set is at the Munson-Williams-Proctor Arts Institute in Utica, New York, and the second set is at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.|$|E
25|$|The Bambaras used to {{transmit}} their knowledge by oral tradition, hence {{much of their}} art and culture is unknown. Ségou’s cultural heritage includes traditional musical instruments, wonderful griots, folkloric groups and the traditional masks and marionettes. The history of the Bambara state’s traditional religious practices are ambiguous. They practice animism and fetishism as cultural practices, and also totemic and monism (cult of ancestors). The most famous Ségou handcrafts are based on pottery, weaving (blankets, wrappers and carpets), manufacturing of Bogolan (a distinctive variation of Mud cloth), painting and sculpture. Ségou is also regarded as the capital of Malian pottery with a large pottery district in Kalabougou situated on the left bank. Women make the pottery by hand with the clay coming from the Niger River and bring the <b>finished</b> <b>works</b> to the local Monday market.|$|E
25|$|The underdrawings of {{both the}} Buccleuch and Lansdowne Madonnas show several {{features}} not in the <b>finished</b> <b>works,</b> but present in some copies; {{it is likely that}} these were originally copied from the prime versions during an early stage of the composition’s development. One such feature, which appears in both underdrawings, is a group of figures identified as St Joseph making a baby walker for the Christ child, who appears with his mother and another female figure, probably a midwife. It has also been suggested that the child learning to walk is the infant John the Baptist, appearing with his mother St Elizabeth, as Leonardo would have been unlikely to depict the figures of Mary and Christ twice in the same painting. Leonardo also experimented with including some kind of beast of burden – a horse, ass or ox – which appears in different positions in the two underdrawings. Behind these an architectural structure with an arched opening was planned. At a later stage the landscape of the Buccleuch picture seems to have had a bridge like that of the Lansdowne Madonna, which was then painted over.|$|E

500|$|By the 1870s, Morris's {{decorative}} arts firm Morris & Co. was offering both designs for embroideries and <b>finished</b> <b>works</b> {{in the art}} needlework style. Morris became active in the growing movement to return originality and mastery of technique to embroidery.

Once he had mastered the technique he trained his wife Jane, her sister Bessie Burden and others to execute designs to his specifications. When [...] "embroideries of all kinds" [...] were offered through Morris, Marshall, Faulkner & Co. catalogues, church embroidery became and remained an important line of business for its successor companies into the twentieth century. By the 1870s, the firm was offering both embroidery patterns and <b>finished</b> <b>works.</b> Following in Street's footsteps, Morris became active in the growing movement to return originality and mastery of technique to embroidery, {{and was one of}} the first designers associated with the Royal School of Art Needlework with its aim to [...] "restore Ornamental Needlework for secular purposes to the high place it once held among decorative arts." ...|$|E

500|$|Bauer and {{his friends}} were part of a {{generation}} of Swedish painters who started their careers just before the Modernism movement began to flourish, {{but at the same time}} were considerably younger than those dominating the Swedish art scene: artists such as Carl Larsson, Anders Zorn and Bruno Liljefors. Bauer was inspired by these artists, but from his heritage [...] came in contact with Fritz Erler, Max Klinger and other German illustrators. He lived in an era when the Old Norse were romanticized throughout Scandinavia, and borrowed ideas and motifs from artists like Theodor Kittelsen and Erik Werenskiöld, yet his <b>finished</b> <b>works</b> were in his own style. [...] After his journey to Italy his works clearly showed elements from the 14th century Renaissance. The pictures of princes and princesses had elements from Flandic tapestries, and even the trolls garments were pleated, much like the draped clothing seen in antique Roman sculptures.|$|E

2500|$|Today, Rockwell’s artwork is {{well known}} in the Pacific Northwest. [...] Many of his {{landscape}} watercolors and oil paintings are based on sketches he made during his topographical survey expeditions.

[...] It is estimated that Rockwell produced about 500 <b>finished</b> <b>works.</b> Only 134 of his paintings are known today along with his sketchbooks that include several hundred more drawings.

[...] The title of the series is usually considered an allusion to Dante's Divine Comedy; while Ferdinand Brunetière, the famous French literary critic, suggests that it may stem from poems by Alfred de Musset or Alfred de Vigny. While Balzac sought the comprehensive scope of Dante, his title indicates the worldly, human concerns of a realist novelist.

2500|$|The {{distinctive}} background view across Lake Geneva to the Le Môle peak in The Miraculous Draught of Fishes by Konrad Witz (1444) {{is often}} cited as the first Western rural landscape to show a specific scene. The landscape studies by Dürer clearly represent actual scenes, which can be identified in many cases, and were at least partly made on the spot; the drawings by Fra Bartolomeo also seem clearly sketched from nature. Dürer's <b>finished</b> <b>works</b> seem generally to use invented landscapes, although the spectacular bird's-eye view in his engraving Nemesis shows an actual view in the Alps, with additional elements. Several landscapists {{are known to have}} made drawings and watercolour sketches from nature, but the evidence for early oil painting being done outside is limited. The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood made special efforts in this direction, {{but it was not until}} the introduction of ready-mixed oil paints in tubes in the 1870s, followed by the portable [...] "box easel", that painting en plein air became widely practiced.|$|E
