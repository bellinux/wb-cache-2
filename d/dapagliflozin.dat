50|$|<b>Dapagliflozin</b> {{disposition}} is not evidently {{affected by}} BMI or body weight, therefore the pharmacokinetic findings {{are expected to}} be applicable to patients with a higher BMI. <b>Dapagliflozin</b> resulted in dose-dependent increases excretions in urinary glucose, up to 47g/d following single-dose administration, which can be expected from its mechanism of action, <b>dapagliflozin.</b>|$|E
50|$|The results, summed up, {{were that}} 10 mg of <b>dapagliflozin</b> showed more effect than placebo {{in the control}} of glucose, when given for 24 weeks. However, no {{inferior}} efficacy of 10 mg <b>dapagliflozin</b> were shown when used as an add-on therapy to metformin, compared with glipizide after use for 52 weeks. 10 mg of <b>dapagliflozin</b> did neither show inferior efficacy compared with metformin when both of the medicines were given as monotherapy for 24 weeks.|$|E
50|$|In {{some long}} term {{clinical}} {{studies that have}} been made on <b>dapagliflozin,</b> <b>dapagliflozin</b> was associated with a decrease in body weight which was statistically superior compared to placebo or other active comparators. It is primarily associated with caloric rather than fluid loss.|$|E
50|$|Three {{drugs have}} been {{accepted}} by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in The United States; <b>dapagliflozin,</b> canagliflozin and empagliflozin. Canagliflozin was the first SGLT-2 inhibitor that {{was approved by the}} FDA, it was accepted in March 2013. <b>Dapagliflozin</b> and empagliflozin were accepted in 2014.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dapagliflozin</b> {{inhibits}} subtype 2 of the sodium-glucose transport proteins (SGLT2) {{which are}} responsible for at least 90% of the glucose reabsorption in the kidney. Blocking this transporter mechanism causes blood glucose to be eliminated through the urine. In clinical trials, <b>dapagliflozin</b> lowered HbA1c by 0.6 versus placebo percentage points when added to metformin.|$|E
50|$|The FDA {{approved}} the combination product <b>dapagliflozin</b> and metformin hydrochloride extended-release, called Xigduo XR, in October 2014.|$|E
50|$|In Feb 2017 the FDA {{approved}} a once-daily combination of <b>dapagliflozin</b> 10 mg and saxagliptin 5 mg, as Qtern.|$|E
50|$|The use of <b>dapagliflozin</b> {{with other}} oral {{antidiabetic}} agents act synergistically {{with virtually no}} increased risk of developing low blood sugar levels.|$|E
5000|$|The FDA {{approved}} <b>dapagliflozin</b> on January 8, 2014 for glycemic control, {{along with}} diet and exercise, in adults with type 2 diabetes.|$|E
50|$|Glycosuria can {{be induced}} therapeutically for {{treatment}} of diabetes mellitus type 2 using SGLT2 inhibitors canagliflozin, <b>dapagliflozin,</b> and empagliflozin (collectively known as gliflozins).|$|E
5000|$|In May 2015, the United States' Food and Drug Administration {{issued a}} warning that the gliflozins canagliflozin, <b>dapagliflozin,</b> and empagliflozin may lead to ketoacidosis.|$|E
50|$|Interactions {{are very}} {{important}} for SGLT2 inhibitors because most T2DM patients are taking many other medications. There is low risk of clinically relevant pharmacokinetics drug interactions because of the metabolic pathway of SGLT2.According to Bhartia and his co-workers, {{it is safe to}} consume <b>dapagliflozin</b> along with pioglitazone, metformin, glimepiride, or sitagliptin and dose adjustment is unnecessary for either drug. It is unlikely that food intake has clinical meaningful impact on the efficacy of <b>dapagliflozin,</b> therefore it can be administered without regard to meals.|$|E
50|$|Since <b>dapagliflozin</b> {{leads to}} heavy {{glycosuria}} (sometimes {{up to about}} 70 grams per day) {{it can lead to}} rapid weight loss and tiredness. The glucose acts as an osmotic diuretic (this effect is the cause of polyuria in diabetes) which can lead to dehydration. The increased amount of glucose in the urine can also worsen the infections already associated with diabetes, particularly urinary tract infections and thrush (candidiasis). <b>Dapagliflozin</b> is also associated with hypotensive reactions. There are concerns it may increase the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis.|$|E
50|$|From May to August 2000, Doyle {{worked as}} an intern at Bristol Meyers Squibb. There, she studied the process aiding the {{preparation}} of type II diabetes treatment: <b>Dapagliflozin.</b>|$|E
50|$|SGLT2 inhibitors, {{also called}} gliflozins, {{are used in}} the {{treatment}} of type 2 diabetes. Examples include <b>dapagliflozin</b> (Farxiga in US, Forxiga in EU), canagliflozin (Invokana) and empagliflozin (Jardiance).|$|E
50|$|<b>Dapagliflozin</b> is {{an example}} of an SGLT-2 inhibitor, it is a competitive, highly {{selective}} inhibitor of SGLT. It acts via selective and potent inhibition of SGLT-2, and its activity is based on each patient’s underlying blood sugar control and kidney function. The results are decreased kidney reabsorption of glucose, glucosuria effect increases with higher level of glucose in the blood circulation. Therefore, <b>dapagliflozin</b> reduces the blood glucose concentration with a mechanism that is independent of insulin secretion and sensitivity, unlike many other antidiabetic drugs. Functional pancreatic β-cells are not necessary for the activity of the drug so it is convenient for patients with diminished β-cell function.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Dapagliflozin</b> (INN, USAN, {{trade name}} Farxiga [...] in the U.S. and Forxiga in the EU and Russia) {{is a drug}} of the gliflozin class, used to treat type 2 diabetes. It was {{developed}} by Bristol-Myers Squibb in partnership with AstraZeneca.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Dapagliflozin,</b> {{the first}} SGLT2 {{inhibitor}} approved {{anywhere in the}} world, which happened in 2011 by the EU. It was approved {{for use in the}} United States under the brand name [...] "Farxiga" [...] by the Food and Drug Administration in 2014.|$|E
50|$|Most of the {{reported}} SGLT-2 inhibitors are glucosides analogs that can be tracked to the o-aryl glucoside found in the nature. The problem about o-glucosides as SGLT-2 inhibitors is instability that can be tracked to degradation by β-glucosidase in the small intestine. Because of that, o-glucosides given orally have to be prodrug esters. These prodrugs go through changes in the body leading to carbon-carbon bond between the glucose and the aglycone moiety so c-glucoside are formed from the o-glucosides. C-glucosides have a different pharmacokinetic profile than o-glucosides (e.g. half life and duration of action) and are not degraded by the β-glucosidase. The first discovered c-glucoside is the drug <b>dapagliflozin</b> ((1S)-1,5-anhydro-1-C-{4-chloro-3-(4-ethoxyphenyl)methylphenyl}-D-glucitol). <b>Dapagliflozin</b> was the first highly selective SGLT2-inhibitor approved by the European Medicine Agency. All SGLT-2 inhibitors in clinical development are prodrugs {{that have to be}} converted to its active ‘A’ form for activity.|$|E
50|$|The {{discovery}} of T-1095 led to investigation {{of how to}} enhance potency, selectivity and oral bioavailability by adding various substituents to the glycoside core. As an example we can take the change of o-glycosides to c-glycosides by creating a carbon-carbon bond between the glucose and the aglycone moiety. C-glucosides are more stable than o-glucosides which leads to modified half life and duration of action. The modifications has also led to more specificity to SGLT-2.C-glucosides that have heterocyclic ring at the distal ring or proximal ring are better {{when it comes to}} anti-diabetic effect and physicochemical features all together. C-glucoside bearing thiazole at the distal ring on <b>dapagliflozin</b> has shown good physicochemical properties that can lead to a clinical development, but still has the same antidiabetic activity as <b>dapagliflozin.</b> This is shown in tables 1 and 2.|$|E
50|$|In {{studies that}} were made on healthy people and people with type II {{diabetes}} mellitus, who were given <b>dapagliflozin</b> in either single ascending dose (SAD) or multiple ascending dose (MAD) showed results that confirmed a pharmacokinetic profile of the drug. With dose-dependent concentrations the half-life is about 12-13 hours, Tmax 1-2 hours and it is protein-bound, so the medication has a rapid absorption and minimal excretion by the kidney.|$|E
50|$|Inhibition of SGLT-2 result {{as better}} control of glucose level, lower insulin, lower blood {{pressure}} and uric acid levels and augment calorie wasting. Some data also supports that SGLT-2 inhibition may have direct renoprotective effects, including actions to attenuate tubular hypertrophy and hyperfiltration associated with diabetes as well as reduce the tubular toxicity of glucose.Inhibition of SGLT-2 following treatment with <b>dapagliflozin</b> reduces the capacity for tubular glucose reabsorption by approximately 30-50%.|$|E
50|$|SGLT2 inhibitors {{are called}} gliflozins. They {{lead to a}} {{reduction}} in blood glucose levels. Therefore, SGLT2 inhibitors have potential use in the treatment of type II diabetes. Gliflozins enhance glycemic control as well as reduce body weight and systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The gliflozins canagliflozin, <b>dapagliflozin,</b> and empagliflozin may lead to euglycemic ketoacidosis. Other side effects of gliflozins include increased risk of (generally mild) urinary tract infections, candidal vulvovaginitis.|$|E
50|$|Song and his {{partners}} did preparate thiazole compound by starting with carboxyl acid. Working with that, it took them three steps to get compound like <b>dapagliflozin</b> with thiazole ring. Inhibitory effects on SGLT-2 of the compounds were tested by Song and partners. In table 1, table 2 and table 3 {{you can see how}} the IC50 value changes depending on what compound is in the ring position, in the C-4 region of the proximal phenyl ring, and how the thiazole ring relates.|$|E
50|$|Phlorizin is a {{competitive}} inhibitor of SGLT1 and SGLT2 because it competes with D-glucose for binding to the carrier; this reduces renal glucose transport, lowering {{the amount of}} glucose in the blood. Phlorizin was studied as a potential pharmaceutical treatment for type 2 diabetes, but has since been superseded by more selective and more promising synthetic analogs, such as canagliflozin and <b>dapagliflozin.</b> Phlorizin is not an effective drug because when orally consumed, it is nearly entirely converted into phloretin by hydrolytic enzymes in the small intestine.|$|E
50|$|Michael Nauck recounts that meta-analyses {{of studies}} about the {{activity}} of SGLT-2 inhibitors in glycemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients, shows improvement in the control of glucose, compared with placebo, metformin, sulfonylurea, thiazolidinediones, insulin and more. The HbA1c was examined after SGLT-2 inhibitors were given alone (as monotherapy) or as an add-on therapy to the other diabetes medicines. The SGLT-2 inhibitors that were used were <b>dapagliflozin</b> and canagliflozin among others in that same drug class.The meta-analysis was taken together from studies ranging from period of few weeks {{up to more than}} 100 weeks.|$|E
50|$|When {{we look at}} the aglycones of phlorizin and <b>dapagliflozin,</b> both of {{them have}} weak {{inhibition}} effects on SGLT-1 and SGLT-2. According to this, two synergistic forces are involved in binding of inhibitors to SGLTs. Different sugars on the aglycone will affect and change the orientation of it in the access vestibule because one of the forces involved in the binding is the binding of sugar to the glucose site. The other force affects the binding affinity of the entire inhibitor and that is the binding of the aglycone.|$|E
5000|$|Zuckerman has {{appeared}} before numerous FDA advisory committees to testify {{as a medical}} expert {{on a variety of}} drugs and devices. On December 12, 2013, Zuckerman testified regarding the type-2 diabetes drug <b>dapagliflozin</b> (Farxiga), saying: [...] "My concern about this drug is that {{there are just too many}} unanswered questions - and those unanswered questions are frightening ones. That was true when the FDA rejected this application for approval 2 years ago, and it is still true today." [...] She cited studies that highlighted the risks that the drug poses, as well as methodological concerns such as a lack of diversity in clinical trials.On November 14, 2012, Zuckerman made a statement at a Capitol Hill press conference about the VALID Compounding Act. She stated that loopholes in the FDA law, including compounding pharmacies, have allowed hundreds of people to get sick with meningitis and several to die. The VALID Compounding Act is designed to close the loopholes that are so harmful to patients.|$|E
40|$|Combined {{antidiabetic}} {{benefits of}} exenatide and <b>dapagliflozin</b> in diabetic mice† The combined glucose-lowering effect of exenatide and <b>dapagliflozin</b> {{has not yet}} been studied.

40|$|OBJECTIVE — To {{determine}} whether <b>dapagliflozin,</b> which selectively inhibits renal glucose reabsorption, lowers hyperglycemia {{in patients with}} type 2 diabetes that is poorly controlled with high insulin doses plus oral antidiabetic agents (OADs). RESEARCHDESIGNANDMETHODS — This was a randomized, double-blind, three-arm parallel-group, placebo-controlled, 26 -center trial (U. S. and Canada). Based on data from an insulin dose-adjustment setting cohort (n 4), patients in the treatment cohort (n 71) were randomly assigned 1 : 1 : 1 to placebo, 10 mg <b>dapagliflozin,</b> or 20 mg <b>dapagliflozin,</b> plus OAD(s) and 50 % of their daily insulin dose. The primary outcome was change from baseline in A 1 C at week 12 (<b>dapagliflozin</b> vs. placebo, last observation carried forward [LOCF]). RESULTS — At week 12 (LOCF), the 10 - and 20 -mg <b>dapagliflozin</b> groups demonstrated 0. 70 and 0. 78 % mean differences in A 1 C change from baseline versus placebo. In both <b>dapagliflozin</b> groups, 65. 2 % of patients achieved a decrease from baseline in A 1 C 0. 5 % versus 15. 8 % in the placebo group.

40|$|<b>Dapagliflozin,</b> a {{new type}} of drug used to treat {{diabetes}} mellitus (DM), is a sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT 2) inhibitor. Although some studies showed that SGLT 2 inhibition attenuated reactive oxygen generation in diabetic kidney the role of SGLT 2 inhibition is unknown. We evaluated whether SLT 2 inhibition has renoprotective effects in ischemia-reperfusion (IR) models. We evaluated whether <b>dapagliflozin</b> reduces renal damage in IR mice model. In addition, hypoxic HK 2 cells were treated with or without SGLT 2 inhibitor to investigate cell survival, the apoptosis signal pathway, and the induction of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF 1) and associated proteins. <b>Dapagliflozin</b> improved renal function. <b>Dapagliflozin</b> reduced renal expression of Bax, renal tubule injury and TUNEL-positive cells and increased renal expression of HIF 1 in IR-injured mice.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Inhibitors of the sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT 2) {{promote the}} {{excretion}} of glucose to reduce glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1 c) levels. Canagliflozin {{was the first}} SGLT 2 inhibitor {{to be approved by}} the US FDA for use in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, and recently <b>dapagliflozin</b> has also been approved. AREAS COVERED: We evaluated a recent Phase III clinical trial with <b>dapagliflozin.</b> EXPERT OPINION: <b>Dapagliflozin</b> was studied as add-on therapy to sitagliptin with or without metformin, and was shown to lower HbA 1 c levels and body weight. The incidence of hypoglycaemia was low with <b>dapagliflozin,</b> but it did increase the incidence of urogenital infections. As no clear benefits have been identified for <b>dapagliflozin</b> over canagliflozin, which was the first gliflozin registered by the FDA, we do not fully understand why it was necessary to register <b>dapagliflozin.</b> Given that there are no completed cardiovascular/clinical outcome studies with <b>dapagliflozin,</b> and therefore no evidence of beneficial effect, it also seems premature to be using it extensively or considering it {{as an alternative to the}} clinically proven metformin...|$|E
40|$|Background and {{objective}} Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibition with <b>dapagliflozin</b> decreases hemoglobin A 1 c (HbAlc), body weight, BP, and albuminuria (urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio). <b>Dapagliflozin</b> also modestly increases hematocrit, likely related to osmotic diuresis/natriuresis. Prior {{studies suggest that}} the HbAlc lowering effects of <b>dapagliflozin</b> attenuate at lower eGFR. However, effects on other cardiovascular risk factors at different eGFR levels are incompletely understood. Design, setting, participants, & measurements This pooled analysis of 11 phase 3 clinical trials assessed changes in HbAlc, body weight, BP, hematocrit, and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio with placebo (n= 2178) or <b>dapagliflozin</b> 10 mg (n= 2226) over 24 weeks inpatients with type 2 diabetes according to baseline eGFR (eGFR >= 45 to = 60 to Results Compared with placebo, reductions in HbAlc with <b>dapagliflozin</b> were 0. 6 %, 0. 5 %, and 0. 3 %, respectively, for each consecutive lower eGFR subgroup (P value interaction Conclusions The HbA 1 c lowering effects of <b>dapagliflozin</b> decrease as renal function declines. However, <b>dapagliflozin</b> consistently decreases body weight, BP, and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio regardless of eGFR. These effects in conjunction with the finding of similar effects on hematocrit, a proxy for volume contraction, suggest that the effects of <b>dapagliflozin</b> are partly mediated via nonglucosuric-dependent mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|<b>Dapagliflozin</b> is {{a therapy}} in {{development}} {{for the treatment of}} type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM). Under normal conditions, ~ 180 g of glucose is filtered through the renal glomerulus per day, and virtually all of this is reabsorbed into blood by the proximal tubules with the major facilitator of reabsorption being the sodium–glucose cotransporter. 1 <b>Dapagliflozin</b> acts revers-ibly and specifically on the sodium–glucose co-transporter 2 in the proximal tubules of the kidney to inhibit the reabsorption of glucose and to promote urinary glucose excretion. 2 <b>Dapagliflozin</b> is rapidly absorbed following oral administra-tion with an absolute oral bioavailability of 78 %. 3 The systemic exposures of <b>dapagliflozin</b> increase in a dose-dependent manner for doses ranging from 0. 1 to 500 mg.

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} {{the safety and}} tolerability of <b>dapagliflozin,</b> a highly selective sodium-glucose co-transporter- 2 inhibitor, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM). METHODS: Data were pooled from 13 placebo-controlled trials of up to 24 weeks' duration (<b>dapagliflozin,</b> n = 2360; placebo, n = 2295). Larger placebo-/comparator-controlled pools of 21 (/= 12 weeks; <b>dapagliflozin,</b> n = 9195; control, n = 4629) assessed the rare adverse events (AEs) of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and lower limb amputation, respectively. RESULTS: Over 24 weeks, the overall incidence of AEs and serious AEs (SAEs) was similar for <b>dapagliflozin</b> and placebo: 60. 0 % vs 55. 7 % and 5. 1 % vs 5. 4 %, respectively. Rates of hypoglycaemia, volume depletion AEs, urinary tract infections (UTIs) and fractures were balanced between the groups. Genital infections were more frequent with <b>dapagliflozin</b> (5. 5 %) vs placebo (0. 6 %) and renal function AEs occurred in 3. 2 % vs 1. 8 % of patients (the most common renal AE was decreased creatinine clearance: 1. 1 % vs 0. 7 %). In the 21 -study pool, 1 SAE of DKA and 3 AEs of ketonuria/metabolic acidosis occurred with <b>dapagliflozin</b> vs none with control; estimated combined incidence for these events was 0. 03 % (95 % confidence interval 0. 010 - 0. 089). In the 30 -study pool, lower limb amputation occurred in 8 (0. 1 %) and 7 (0. 2 %) patients receiving <b>dapagliflozin</b> and control, respectively.
