In this context, traceability {{has been one of the}} main requirements required in the analysis, once this allows comparability between results of measurements carried out in different situations, usingvalues of metrological references, clearly defined, within internationally accepted criteria. The objective of this research was to assess the activities developed in a laboratory for research and analysis of food, about the accordance of item 4, which is established requirements of Direction, and the item 5, technical requirements of ISO/IEC 17025 : 2005, to guide correction of non conformities and internal organization. Initially there was a check list for verification of compliance for the activities developed in the laboratory. When the non-conformities were found, the staff was trained and was applied the 5 S System. In applying the first check list in accordance with the item 4, the laboratory was classified in Group 3 of the Standard, with 57. 14 % <b>of</b> <b>non-conformities,</b> after training and implementation of corrective measures.

Modern Hebrew spirantization provides an apt case study for {{the investigation of the}} interaction of these two sources <b>of</b> <b>non-conformity</b> where exceptional (non-alternating) segments are frequent, and variation in alternating segments has been reported (Adam 2002). This dissertation makes contributions in the forms of both data and analysis. Its goals are to provide a description of exceptionality and variation in Modern Hebrew spirantization and an analysis which incorporates alternation, exceptionality and variation.; To collect data for the description of Modern Hebrew spirantization in verbal paradigms, an experimental rating task was conducted. Its goal was to examine speakers’ acceptance of variation in both alternating and exceptional segments in Modern Hebrew spirantization, where stops and fricatives alternate, with the latter occurring in post-vocalic contexts and the former occurring elsewhere. The results establish that variation is at least somewhat acceptable in both alternating and exceptional segments, and is significantly more acceptable in alternating segments than in exceptional ones. Moreover, speakers showed a preference for the expected forms of both types of segments (i. e. the non-alternating form in exceptions, and post-vocalic fricatives or word-initial and post-consonantal stops in alternating segments). Importantly, the results also show that variation in both types of segments is gradient.; To account for alternation, exceptionality, and variation in relation to a single phonological process, I propose a model combining the set-indexation approach for exceptionality (Pater 2000) with stochastic OT and the Gradual Learning Algorithm for gradience in variation (Boersma 1998, Hayes & MacEachern 1998, Zuraw 2000, Boersma & Hayes 2001, Hayes & Londe 2006).

In particular, set-indexation and stochastic constraint rankings both presuppose that the mechanism they do not account for is established by a different mechanism – set-indexation is only implemented once variation and speech errors have been ruled out as the cause for non-alternation, whereas in order to provide the stochastic constraint rankings accounting for acceptability of variation in all tokens, set-indexation must have already been implemented.
