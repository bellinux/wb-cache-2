Extensive toxicological testing has shown that HFA-propellant, are well tolerated. Among the reformulated beclometasone dipropionate-containing pMDIs, only the characteristics of the two Qvar (TM) formulation, have been thoroughly explored. Compared to the reference beclometasone dipropionate formulation, the mass median aerodynamic diameter of the Qvar (TM) formulations are substantially smaller (1. 1 vs 4. 0 mu m), whereas that of Modulite (TM) averages 2. 6 mu m.

The timetable for this process is outlined in the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer document and in several subsequent amendments. Pressured metered dose inhalers (pMDIs) for medical use have been granted temporary exemptions until replacement formulations, providing the same medication via the same route, and with the same efficacy and safety profiles, are approved for human use. <b>Hydrofluoroalkanes</b> (HFAs) are the alternative propellants for CFCs- 12 and - 114. Their potential for damage to the ozone layer is nonexistent, and while they are greenhouse gases, their global warming potential is a fraction (one-tenth) of that of CFCs. Replacement formulations for almost all inhalant respiratory medications have been or are being produced and tested; in Canada, it is anticipated that the transition to these HFA or CFC-free pMDIs will be complete by the year 2005. Initially, an HFA pMDI was to be equivalent to the CFC pMDI being replaced, in terms of aerosol properties and effective clinical dose. However, this will not necessarily be the situation, particularly for some corticosteroid products. Currently, only one CFC-free formulation is available in Canada – Airomir, a HFA salbutamol pMDI.

The drug delivery of pMDIs formulated with HFA 134 a as a propellant and containing either salbutamol (100 μg per actuation) or fluticasone propionate (125 and 250 μg per actuation) have been assessed for dose uniformity and particle size distribution.

Each of the products provided an emitted dose which was within ± 25 % of the mean value indicating accurate and consistent dosing (93, 112 and 221 μg per metered dose for the salbutamol 100 μg and fluticasone propionate 125 and 250 μg HFA 134 a pMDIs, respectively). These findings were unaffected by changing the storage orientation of the pMDI or by using the device in a manner designed to simulate typical patient use.

SOURCES OF DATA: Bibliographic search in electronic databases (MEDLINE, MDConsult, HighWire, Medscape and LILACS) and direct search {{referring to the}} past 15 years, using the key words <b>hydrofluoroalkane,</b> asthma and childhood were carried out. SUMMARY OF THE FINDINGS: 43 original articles on the replacement of clorofluorcarbon by hydrofluoralkane were selected. Hydrofluoralkane showed to be a safe propellent, with pulmonary deposition ranging from 50 to 60 %, and to have significant efficacy, when compared with placebo (p < 0. 003) in controlled clinical trials. Most works using hydrofluoralkane included beclomethasone diproprionate. Approximate annual cost of a treatment with beclomethasone diproprionate/hydrofluoralkane was lower than with beclomethasone diproprionate/clorofluorcarbon.

40|$|The {{reformulation}} of pressurized metered dose inhalers (MDIs) with <b>hydrofluoroalkanes</b> (HFAs) from chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) {{has given}} rise to many solubility challenges. Compounds and excipients previously used in CFCs were observed to have significantly different solubility values in HFA- 134 a. In this investigation, the solubility values of solid organic solutes were determined in pure HFA- 134 a and HFA- 134 a with cosolvent (0 - 20 % w/w ethanol). The solubilities of solid solutes in HFA- 134 a were also compared with those in 2 H, 3 H-decafluoropentane (DFP) in order to assess the suitability of DFP as a liquid model propellant. The experimental set of solutes display diverse physico-chemical properties and yielded solubility values that ranged over four orders of magnitude. The experimental solubilities were compared to calculated values obtained from ideal solubility and regular solution theory models. While the theoretical models did not offer absolute solubility estimations, a clear correlation with the ideal solubility (melting point) was noted. Further consideration utilizing multiple linear regression models afforded correlations based on molecular properties. Regression models, containing melting point and logP (or molar volume) resulted in promising correlations in both pure HFA- 134 a and HFA- 134 a/cosolvent systems where the average absolute errors ranged from 0. 49 to 0. 82 log units, (average factor errors of 3. 09 and 6. 61, respectively). In general, a linear relationship was observed between log mole fraction solubility in HFA- 134 a and fraction ethanol. The effect on solubilization ranged from 1. 3 to 99. 4 times when 20 % w/w ethanol was introduced, relative to pure HFA- 134 a. DFP appears to be a promising liquid model for pure HFA- 134 a for pre-formulation calculations.

The HFA solvent system is unique in that many CFC soluble compounds behave differently in the HFA alternatives, such as HFA- 134 a and HFA- 227. The reason for the difference in solubility is not fully recognized. This work investigates the solubility of 22 compounds in HFA- 227 {{with the addition of}} ethanol as a cosolvent. The physical properties of both solute and solvent were investigated {{in order to determine the}} effects on solubility. The solubilities of 5 compounds in HFA- 134 a were also investigated. A thermodynamic approach was utilized in order to look at the enthalpic and entropic effects on solubility in the propellant. Due to the high vapor pressure of propellants, a liquid model was utilized, owing to its ease of use in characterizing solubility. The correlation between the liquid model 2 H, 3 H-decafluoropentane (DFP) and the propellants HFA- 134 a and HFA- 227 was examined. The solubilities in HFA- 227 with ethanol ranged from 0. 001 to 3. 282 %w/w, where the solubilities always increase when ethanol was added. The experimental solubilities were compared to calculated values obtained from ideal solubility and regular solution theory models. A clear correlation with the ideal solubility (melting point) combined with an intercept term and two physical properties was noted. A regression approach was also used to predict the activity coefficient in HFA- 227 with 0 - 20 % ethanol. These equations were combined with the extended ideal solubility equation, creating a useful predictive equation with AAE values ranging from 0. 32 to 0. 36, or factor errors of 2. 09 to 2. 29. The equations shown in this work are useful for the prediction of solute solubility in HFA- 227 /ethanol mixtures. Results in the liquid model DFP with 0 - 20 % ethanol show that a regression equation results in a useful predictive equation for the solubilities in both HFA- 134 /ethanol and HFA- 227 /ethanol systems, where the AAE values ranged from 0. 3 to 0. 56, or factor errors of 2. 0 to 3. 6. The solubilities of a series of chlorobenzene compounds along with a group of hydrogen donating and/or accepting compounds was examined in HFA- 134 a. The entropic effects appear to be the limiting factor in the solubility of these compounds. The compounds capable of hydrogen accepting and donating exhibited negative enthalpy of mixing values when placed in HFA- 134 a, a stark contrast to the values obtained for the chlorobenzenes.

40|$|Alternative non-chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) {{propellants}} {{have been}} developed and {{have been shown to}} be safe alternatives to CFC propellants. Salbutamol (albuterol) and beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) in metered dose inhalers (MDIs) have been most studied. Salbutamol sulfate non-CFC MDIs have remained as a suspension formulation, and there is good evidence that salbutamol sulfate non-CFC MDIs are equivalent to salbutamol sulfate CFC MDIs. BDP non-CFC MDIs have a new formulation which is a solution and has a significantly smaller particle size than BDP delivered from CFC MDIs. This has resulted in more of the metered dose from the non-CFC MDI reaching the lower respiratory tract, with a consequent reduction of the dose deposited in the throat. This change allows a smaller dose of the non-CFC BDP to be equivalent to the CFC formulation. However, efficacy studies will be needed with other medications that are delivered in non-CFC MDIs because this finding with BDP relates to the solution formulation and particle size. The non-CFC propellant <b>hydrofluoroalkane</b> (HFA) - 134 a functions better at a lower temperature than its CFC comparator...|$|E
40|$|The {{goals of}} COPD therapy are {{to prevent and}} control symptoms, reduce the {{frequency}} and severity of exacerbations, and improve exercise tolerance. The triple combination therapy of inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs), long-acting beta 2 agonists (LABAs), and long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) has become an option for maintenance treatment of COPD and as a “step-up” therapy from single or double combination treatments. There is evidence that triple combination ICS/LABA/LAMA with different inhalers improves lung function, symptoms, and health status and reduces exacerbations. A new triple fixed-dose combination of extrafine beclomethasone dipropionate (100 µg/puff) /formoterol fumarate (6 µg/puff) /glycopyrronium bromide (12. 5 µg/puff) has been developed as a <b>hydrofluoroalkane</b> pressurized metered dose inhaler. Two large pivotal studies showed that this extrafine fixed ICS/LABA/LAMA triple combination is superior to fixed ICS/LABA combined therapy and also superior to the LAMA tiotropium in terms of lung function and exacerbation prevention in COPD patients at risk of exacerbation. This review considers the new information provided by these clinical trials of extrafine triple therapy and the implications for the clinical management of COPD patients...|$|E

Ipratropium bromide/salbutamol sulphate CFC-pressurized metered-dose inhalers (IB/SAL-CFC pMDI) have been in widespread use for many years without any apparent ill consequences. This combination has now been reformulated using the <b>hydrofluoroalkane</b> (HFA) propellant. This study sought to establish the clinical noninferiority of a new HFA-containing IB/SAL pMDI to the conventional IB/SAL-CFC pMDI in subjects with mild/moderate COPD. Methods: This was a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter study in two consecutive periods: a 14 -day run-in period followed by a 85 -day treatment period. Eligible mild-to-moderate stable COPD subjects aged 40 - 75  years were enrolled into the study and entered the run-in period during which subjects withdrew all the bronchodilators, except for salbutamol as rescue medication. Subjects were randomized to 85  days treatment with either IB/SAL-HFA or IB/SAL-CFC, 20  µg qid. Results: Of the 290 randomized patients, 249 completed the study. The primary efficacy variable was the change in forced expiratory volume in one second from predose to 60  minutes after dosing on day 85. At the end of the treatment period, the adjusted mean change in forced expiratory volume in one second at 60  minutes was 123  mL in the IB/SAL-HFA pMDI group and 115  mL in the IB/SAL-CFC pMDI group. Because the lower limit of the 95 % confidence interval for the between-group difference (- 62  mL) was well within the noninferiority margin (- 100  mL), the HFA formulation was deemed clinically noninferior to the CFC formulation. This finding was supported by secondary efficacy assessments. Both formulations of IB/SAL were well tolerated during the prolonged multiple dosing. Conclusion: It is concluded that IB/SAL-HFA pMDI provides effective bronchodilation of similar degree to that achieved with IB/SAL-CFC pMDI. Therefore, IB/SAL-HFA pMDI is a valuable alternative to IB/SAL-CFC pMDI.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{assess the}} {{physical}} stability and aerosol characteristics of suspensions of hollow porous microspheres (PulmoSpheres) in HFA- 134 a. METHODS: Cromolyn sodium, albuterol sulfate, and formoterol fumarate microspheres were prepared by a spray-drying method. Particle size and morphology were determined via electron microscopy. Particle aggregation and suspension creaming times were assessed visually, and aerosol performance was determined via Andersen cascade impaction and dose uniformity studies. RESULTS: The hollow porous particle morphology allows the propellant to permeate freely within the particles creating a novel form of suspension termed a homodispersion, wherein the dispersed and continuous phases are identical, separated by an insoluble interfacial layer of drug and excipient. Homodispersion formation improves suspension stability by minimizing {{the difference in}} density between the particles and the medium, and by reducing attractive forces between particles. The improved physical stability leads to excellent dose uniformity. Excellent aerosolization efficiencies are also observed with PulmoSpheres formulations, with fine particle fractions of about 70 %. CONCLUSIONS: The formation of hollow porous particles provides a new formulation technology for stabilizing suspensions of drugs in <b>hydrofluoroalkane</b> propellants with improved physical stability, content uniformity, and aerosolization efficiency...|$|E
40|$|Asthma is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} disorder of the airways that requires long-term treatment, {{the goal of}} which is to control clinical symptoms for extended periods with the least possible amount of drugs. International guidelines recommend the addition of an inhaled long-acting beta 2 -agonist (LABA) to a low- to medium-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) when low doses of ICS fail to control asthma symptoms. The fixed combined administration of ICS/LABA improves patient compliance, reducing the risk of therapy discontinuation. The relative deposition pattern of the inhaled drug to the target site {{is the result of a}} complex interaction between the device used, the aerosol formulation and the patient’s adherence to therapy. Different inhalation devices have been introduced in clinical practice over time. The new <b>hydrofluoroalkane</b> (HFA) solution aerosols allow for the particle size to be modified, thus leading to deeper penetration of the medication into the lung. The Modulite® technology allows for the manipulation of inhaled HFA-based solution formulations, such as the fixed beclomethasone/formoterol combination, resulting in a uniform treatment of inflammation and bronchoconstriction. The success of any anti-asthmatic treatment depends on the choice of the correct device and the adherence to therapy...|$|E
