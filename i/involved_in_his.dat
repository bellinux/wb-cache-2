In high school, he often stayed with his godmother, Jamie Garza, who lived nearer to the school.|$|E
5|$|Written by Pennant Roberts, this four-part {{story was}} {{commissioned}} on 10 January 1979 as Dragons of Fear.

5|$|Blamey became <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> {{first and}} {{greatest}} scandal soon after taking office. During {{a raid on}} a brothel in Fitzroy on 21 October 1925, the police encountered a man who produced Blamey's police badge, No. 80. Blamey later {{said that he had}} given his key ring, which included his badge, to a friend who had served with him in France, so that the man could help himself to some alcohol in Blamey's locker at the Naval and Military Club. His story was corroborated by his friend Stanley Savige, who was with him at the time. Blamey protected the man in question, who he said was married with children, and refused to identify him. The man has never been identified, but the description given by the detectives and the brothel owner did not match Blamey.|$|E
5|$|John Constantine, {{the main}} {{character}} of Hellblazer, was portrayed {{as a kind of}} confidence man and occult detective who did morally questionable things, arguably for the greater good. He usually triumphed through guile, deceit, and misdirection, but often made more enemies in the process than he defeated. Indeed, it was a common theme in the book that Constantine was unable to effect any lasting change or enjoy unequivocal victories. While sometimes striving for the good of mankind, Constantine was often manipulative and a dangerous person to have as a friend, as the lives and souls of those around him became perilously <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> misadventures. He took pains to protect himself from direct attacks, but his friends and relatives were often endangered in order to strike at him. The spirits of deceased friends haunted him, individually or as an entourage of ghosts.|$|E
5|$|MacLaren {{had many}} jobs as he {{attempted}} {{to find ways to}} support his cricket, family and lifestyle. At various time, he worked as a teacher, a journalist and a cricket coach. For many years, he was employed as Lancashire's assistant secretary but such were his financial worries that he often had to ask for cash advances from the committee, with which he had a stormy relationship. He worked for several years as private secretary to K. S. Ranjitsinhji and he became <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> employer's financial scandals. Many of MacLaren's later business ventures were failures, and only when his wife came into an inheritance did he and his family live in comfort. Throughout his life, MacLaren was involved in many disagreements and was never popular with teammates. However, he was a hero to the cricket writer Neville Cardus, who wrote prolifically on him. MacLaren died in 1944, aged 72.|$|E

He was 26 {{years old at the}} time of his entrance into the Olympics, having not previously participated at any Olympic games. The qualification round for men's long jump took place on August 16, where McGregor competed in the second heat. The long jumper was given three attempts. During the first, McGregor jumped 7.64meters, setting his highest time of the three attempts; he ranked fifteenth in his heat with that score. His second attempt (7.46meters) and his third attempt (7.36meters) were discounted in favor of his best mark. Overall, McGregor ranked 30 out of the 38 athletes who received a score, falling behind Morocco's Tarik Bouguetaib (7.69meters) and placing ahead of Denmark's Morten Jensen (7.63meters). He did not participate in the final round, which was held on August 18.|$|E
5|$|Prescott's main {{secondary}} {{source for}} the history was Leopold von Ranke's Fürste und Völker von Süd-Europa im sechzehnten und siebzehnten Jahrhundert, a comprehensive work which included a detailed history of the papacy. Prescott admired Ranke's empirical historical method, and considered his work {{to be the best}} of his predecessors on the subject. He had four copies of the relevant sections of the work reprinted in a large typeface so he could read it without assistance. He had made a broad plan of the work by February 1849. Prescott started writing the draft on July 26. At this time, Prescott was a creditor of John White Webster, the chemist and murderer, and he was subsequently <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> trial.|$|E
5|$|Werner Erhard: The Transformation of a Man, The Founding of est is a {{biography}} of Werner Erhard by philosophy professor William Warren Bartley, III. The book was published in 1978 by Clarkson Potter. Bartley was professor of philosophy at California State University and had studied with philosopher Karl Popper.

5|$|Following {{the death}} of Ibn Tulun in May 884, the two caliphal generals Ishaq ibn Kundaj and Ibn Abu'l-Saj sought to take {{advantage}} of the situation and attacked the Tulunid domains in Syria, but their initial gains were rapidly reversed. In the spring of 885, Abu'l-Abbas was sent to take charge of the invasion. He soon succeeded in defeating the Tulunids and forcing them to retreat to Palestine, but after a quarrel with Ibn Kundaj and Ibn Abu'l-Saj, the latter abandoned the campaign and withdrew their forces. In the Battle of Tawahin on 6 April, Abu'l-Abbas confronted Ibn Tulun's son and heir, Khumarawayh, in person. The Abbasid prince was initially victorious, forcing Khumarawayh to flee, but was in turn defeated and fled the battlefield, while much of his army was taken prisoner. After this victory the Tulunids expanded their control over the Jazira and the borderlands (the Thughur) with the Byzantine Empire. A peace agreement followed in 886, whereby al-Muwaffaq was forced to recognize Khumarawayh as hereditary governor over Egypt and Syria for 30 years, in exchange for an annual tribute. Over the next couple of years, Abu'l-Abbas was <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> father's ultimately unsuccessful attempts to wrest control of Fars from Saffarid control.|$|E
5|$|Irvine's {{first taste}} of {{international}} football came in 1958, when he represented the Northern Ireland schoolboy team in the Victory Shield. Five years later, he made his debut for the Northern Ireland national under-23 football team, when he played alongside his brother Bobby in the 1–5 defeat to Wales on 27 February 1963. During the next two years, he played twice more for the under-23 team, scoring three goals for the side. Irvine received his first call-up to the Northern Ireland senior team in April 1963, one month before he made his professional debut for Burnley. He went straight into the team and won his first cap on 3 April 1963 in the 1–4 loss to Wales in the British Home Championship. He received his next cap the following month and scored his first international goal on 30 May 1963 in the 1–1 draw with Spain {{in the first round}} of the 1964 European Nations Cup. It was over a year before Irvine was selected to represent his country again, when he was included in the squad for the 1–2 defeat to Switzerland in a qualification match for the 1966 FIFA World Cup. On 25 November 1964, he scored his second Northern Ireland goal in the loss to Scotland in the British Home Championship. Irvine was <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> first win with the Northern Ireland team when they defeated the Netherlands in a World Cup qualifying game on 17 March 1965. During the remainder of the 1964–65 season, he won a further three caps for his country.|$|E
5|$|On 6 July 2015, it was {{announced}} that Pirlo had completed a move to MLS expansion club New York City FC as their third Designated Player. In doing so, he became the highest paid Italian player in all leagues with an $8 million salary, until Graziano Pellè overtook him after moving to Chinese club Shandong Luneng the following year. Pirlo made his debut with the club on 26 July 2015 at Yankee Stadium in New York against Orlando City, coming on as a substitute in the 56th minute; he was <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> team's third and fourth goals and was booked in the 88th minute as New York won the match 5–3. He made his first start for New York on 1 August, in a 2–3 home defeat to the Montreal Impact. On 12 August, it {{was announced}} that Pirlo had placed seventh in the 2015 UEFA Best Player in Europe. On 13 August he set up a goal for David Villa in a 3–1 home win over D.C. United. In October 2015, Pirlo was named to the 59-player shortlist for the 2015 FIFA Ballon d'Or. He finished the 2015 MLS season with 5 assists in 13 appearances, and ended up third in the MLS in minutes per pass, although he failed to score a goal. Despite the presence of Pirlo and two other Champions League winners, David Villa and Frank Lampard, New York City FC failed to qualify for the 2015 MLS Cup Playoffs at the conclusion of their debut season, which drew criticism from the press; Pirlo in particular drew criticism from the media for his low defensive work-rate. In November, Pirlo became the first MLS player in history to be nominated for the FIFPro World XI.|$|E

5|$|The film {{began its}} {{publicity}} campaign in February2011 {{with the goal}} of releasing the film during the period of the 2011 Tamil Nadu legislative assembly elections to raise support of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) Party, led by the film's writer, M. Karunanidhi. Criticism mounted against Karunanidhi for being more <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> artistic pursuits than in his Chief Ministerial duties as the elections approached. Prior to release, the film also drew criticism from the Kongu Nadu Munnetra Kazhagam (KMK) Party claiming that the film portrayed the traditional deities of the gounder community in a bad light, showing them dancing with semi-nude women. Leading figures from the party wrote to the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) to ban the film, holding the promotional material used for the movie as evidence. When they received no response from CBFC, a petition was filed at Madras High Court, seeking its ban under Article 226 of the Indian constitution. The petition was dismissed, given that Article 226 can only be used by a court on a body that falls within its jurisdiction.|$|E
5|$|After an eight-game goal drought, Giovinco {{scored a}} hat-trick against D.C. United, on 23 July, in a 4–1 home win, also surpassing De Rosario's {{previous}} all-time record as Toronto FC's top scorer by two goals to 35 goals. With two goals from free kicks during the match, including his {{seventh in the}} MLS, he broke David Beckham's record for most goals from set-pieces in the league since 2010. He {{was named to the}} Team of the Week once again for his performances, and was also named MLS Player of the Week {{for the first time that}} season. On 27 August, Giovinco was brought off the field after the later diagnosis of strains in his quadriceps and adductor in the eventual 1–0 loss in the 401 Derby with Montreal at home; although he was initially expected to be sidelined for a month, the injury was more severe than expected, and he ended up missing seven weeks of play. He finally returned to action on 16 October, against Montreal once again, helping to set up Toronto's equaliser in a 2–2 away draw. On 26 October, Giovinco scored the opening goal of a 3–1 home win over Philadelphia, both his and Toronto FC's first MLS Playoff goal in the MLS Cup Playoffs, and was later <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> team's next two goals; this was Toronto's first ever playoff win, which enabled the team to progress to the Eastern Conference Semi-finals for the first time. On 6 November in the second leg of the Eastern Conference Semi-finals, Giovinco scored a hat-trick in a 5–0 away win over New York City FC, 7–0 on aggregate, to progress to the Eastern Conference Finals in an all Canadian derby against Montreal Impact. In the first leg of the Eastern Conference Final on 22 November, Giovinco set up Jozy Altidore's goal in a 3–2 away loss to Montreal. Toronto later beat Montreal 5–2 in extra time in the return leg at home on 30 November, as Giovinco once again set up Altidore's goal, winning on an aggregated score of 7–5, making Toronto FC the first Canadian team to compete in an MLS Cup Final; although he was forced off in the 97th minute due to cramp in his calf, he was later declared fit to play against Seattle Sounders in the 2016 MLS Cup Final. On 5 December, he was named to the MLS Best XI for the second season in a row, despite being left off the finalists list for the MLS MVP.|$|E
