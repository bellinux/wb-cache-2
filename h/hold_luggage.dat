2500|$|Freddie Laker, BUA's first {{managing}} director (MD), used his contacts to British Rail (BR) {{to create a}} £100,000 city centre check-in facility in London's West End in a disused part of Victoria Station, which opened in late-April 1962. This enabled BUA's scheduled passengers to complete all check-in formalities, including dropping off their <b>hold</b> <b>luggage,</b> before boarding their train to Gatwick.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{rather a}} pity," [...] was the cool reply, [...] "because {{you may not}} see me again. I was looking for Miss Beverley, in fact, to say good-by. We are docking in half an hour, {{and those who have}} been searched can go on shore, if they like to leave their <b>hold</b> <b>luggage.</b> As I have been searched twice in the most {{thorough}} and effective fashion, I have my pass out." ...|$|E
40|$|Photograph of a Santa Fe Railway advertisement, {{showing a}} waving young girl <b>holding</b> <b>luggage,</b> 1925. The girl is shown at top, while below her text reads "= a few sunny hours through a scenic wonderland then California. Santa Fe 'all the way'. The {{shortest}} route - Chicago to California - 5 daily trains" and {{is followed by}} a paragraph detailing the dining service provided by Fred Harvey...|$|R
6000|$|The {{fourteen}} gentlemen <b>holding</b> the <b>luggage,</b> here {{burst out}} and laughed very rudely indeed; {{and the only}} person who seemed disappointed was, I thought, the hackney-coachman. [...] "Why, YOU rascal!" [...] says Jemmy, laying hold of the boy, [...] "do you want more than the coachman?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, I {{have got}} the trap out at the Greyhound,' said Bob. 'I don't know whether it will <b>hold</b> your <b>luggage</b> and us too; but it looked more respectable than the waggon on a Sunday, and if there's not room for the boxes I can walk alongside.' ...|$|R
50|$|Both <b>hold</b> <b>luggage</b> and carry-on {{hand luggage}} are {{normally}} examined by X-ray machines using X-ray radiography. See airport security for more details.|$|E
5000|$|The Central London air {{terminal}} at Victoria Station in London's West End, which the [...] "Second Force" [...] inherited from BUA as well, allowed passengers to complete all check-in formalities, including dropping off their <b>hold</b> <b>luggage,</b> before boarding their train to the airport.|$|E
5000|$|Transavia {{offers the}} [...] "Selection on Board" [...] buy on board service {{offering}} food and drinks for purchase. Commencing 5 April 2011, Transavia introduced fees for <b>hold</b> <b>luggage</b> {{and changed the}} rules for hand luggage, with the maximum allowable weight for hand luggage increased from 5 kg to 10 kg.|$|E
50|$|A coach (also motor coach, often simply {{referred}} to as a bus) is a type of vehicle used for conveying passengers on excursions and on longer-distance intercity—or even international—bus service. Unlike transit buses designed for shorter journeys, coaches often have a <b>luggage</b> <b>hold</b> that is separate from the passenger cabin and are normally equipped with facilities required for longer trips, including comfortable seats and sometimes a toilet.|$|R
5000|$|Cheech {{answers the}} phone call from Donna, sets up a date, and goes to tell Chong to get lost so he can clean the house {{and get ready for}} Donna. The phone rings again with Cheech {{thinking}} it's Donna and turns out to be Red, Cheech's [...] "kinda" [...] cousin, with money problems and a plea for help. Cheech asks Chong to pick up his cousin and hang out with him as Cheech informs him they have similar interests like [...] "go to clubs," [...] "get plenty of chicks," [...] and [...] "likes to get high." [...] Chong heads off to the hotel where Red is staying and arrives to find him in a dispute with the receptionist (played by Paul Reubens) over how much the room is costing ("$37.50 a week, not a goddamned day!"). The receptionist is <b>holding</b> his <b>luggage,</b> consisting of a boom-box, a suitcase, and a 20-pound canvas bag full of high-grade marijuana, hostage and Red can't afford the bill. They break into the room around the back and Red retrieves his luggage and the receptionist is falsely arrested after calling the cops to arrest Chong and Red but accidentally assaults them and is taken away to jail.|$|R
50|$|Prompted by Anand, Qadri {{decided to}} travel outside of India and devote himself {{full-time}} to painting. He {{had his first}} international exposure in Africa. Qadri {{managed to get a}} fictitious invitation to a wedding in Nairobi, which helped him secure a passport, a difficult feat at the time. When he learned that he could circumvent the three- to six- month wait for permission to leave Nairobi by sailing bunker-class with indigent laborers in the <b>luggage</b> <b>hold</b> of a passenger ship, he and a poet friend immediately booked passage to Mombasa, Kenya. To pass time on the eight-day trip, he sketched his traveling companions, and one day, a passenger from the upper deck. Soon there was a crowd; everyone wanted a portrait done in the realistic style he’d mastered in Simla. For the rest of the journey he traded drawings for food and whisky.|$|R

5000|$|Some {{vehicles}} have an area {{specifically for}} luggage to be held, called the automobile [...] "trunk" [...] in the United States. Items {{stored in the}} hold are known as <b>hold</b> <b>luggage.</b> A typical example would be a suitcase. If travelling by coach passengers will often be expected to place their own luggage in the hold, before boarding. Aeroplanes in contrast are loaded by professional baggage handlers.|$|E
50|$|On {{the morning}} of 5 November Air France-KLM {{announced}} that it would not allow hold baggage on its flight out from Cairo that day; over half of the booked passengers refused to fly. There were an estimated 20,000 British citizens in Sharm El Sheikh on 5 November, almost half of whom were on holiday and stranded by the cancellation of flights. Flights to the UK were allowed again from 6 November, to enable people to travel home, but with restrictions and increased security measures. Passengers were permitted to travel home with only hand luggage, with <b>hold</b> <b>luggage</b> to be returned following a more stringent screening process. British officials at the airport provided extra security and approved aircraft as safe to travel.|$|E
60|$|The {{capacities}} of a chariot were considerable. Within, {{there was a}} good-sized seat for the principal occupants, and outside a dickey behind, and a driving box before, though sometimes {{there was only one}} of these, and that transferable. The boxes were calculated to <b>hold</b> family <b>luggage</b> on a six months' tour. There they lay on the spare-room floor, ready to be packed, the first earnest of our new possessions--except perhaps the five-pound note my father gave each of us four elder ones, on the day the balance at the bank was made over to him. There was the imperial, a grand roomy receptacle, which was placed {{on the top of the}} carriage, and would not always go upstairs in small houses; the capbox, which fitted into a curved place in front of the windows, and could not stand alone, but had a frame to support it; two long narrow boxes with the like infirmity of standing, which fitted in below; square ones under each seat; and a drop box fastened on behind. There were pockets beneath each window, and, curious relic in name and nature of the time when every gentleman carried his weapon, there was the sword case, an excrescence behind the back of the best seat, accessible by lifting a cushion, where weapons used to be carried, but where in our peaceful times travellers bestowed their luncheon and their books.|$|R
25|$|The EC155 B {{features}} a completely redesigned cabin providing 30% more passenger space than previous Dauphin helicopter models, plus a 130% increase in baggage hold volume. Other major improvements include a five-blade Spheriflex composite main rotor {{combined with the}} familiar shrouded Fenestron tail rotor to reduce vibration levels significantly. The EC155 B is powered by two 635kW (851 shp) Turbomeca Arriel 2C1 turboshaft engines mounted over the <b>luggage</b> <b>hold,</b> which feature a dual-channel Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) system. The EC155 B1 features uprated 697kW (935 shp) Arriel 2C2s. The helicopter can be fitted with an anti-icing system to enable the aircraft to operate in very cold climates. The all-glass cockpit is equipped with an 'Avionique Nouvelle' integrated digital flight control system featuring Eurocopter's Vehicle and Engine Management Display (VEMD), which utilizes active matrix liquid crystal displays. The EC155 is also equipped with a four-axis digital autopilot, coupled to the engine FADECs for full-envelope protection, and is offered with a Health and Usage Monitoring System (HUMS).|$|R
40|$|As a key {{concept in}} modern management, the {{knowledge}} management among the knowledge administration, development and transfer between {{the members of}} an organization, it also involves the knowledge stimulation to obtain the competitive advantage and the innovations. The association between communication and knowledge is normal; the knowledge without communication is sterile, even useless. The communication's role in the knowledge management is both normal and valuable, because the knowledge, {{which is a good}} value, must be transferred so it can be exploited to maximum, and the knowledge transfer is possible only through communication. The managerial decisions, strategies, plans, explanations must be communicated to the organization's members so they know how, where and why it must be acted to assure its success. In turn, the organization's members <b>hold</b> a personal <b>luggage</b> of knowledge that can be developed and putted {{in the interests of the}} organization so it can become a collective source that generates new values. The present article presents the results of a research that had as purpose to identify in which way the communication is used to implement the knowledge management. ...|$|R
5000|$|Designed as {{a larger}} four-seat {{version of the}} Rebel, the Super Rebel is an {{all-metal}} high-wing braced monoplane with two rows of side-by-side seats for four. The prototype first flew in November 1995 and was powered by a [...] Lycoming O-540-4A5 driving a two-bladed constant-speed propeller. The prototype had a tricycle landing gear but the standard model (SR2500TD) has a tailwheel landing gear. The rear bench seat can be removed to <b>hold</b> <b>luggage</b> and the Super Rebel has a separate baggage door {{on the port side}} behind the passenger door. The aircraft is designed for any engine between 134 and 186 kW (180 to 250 hp) and also has larger fuel tanks as an option (increasing range to 1350 km (839 miles).|$|E

40|$|R. Benjamin (1995) {{addressed}} {{the application of}} the “object 3 D” X ray reconstruction technique for electronically “unpacking” suspect items, when screening aircraft luggage. However, there is no satisfactory solution to the mass screening of <b>hold</b> <b>luggage.</b> Computed Tomography, CT, entails excessive radiation dosages, and its rate of throughput is quite inadequate. A novel variant of “object 3 D” is therefore put forward, adapting some of the technology of existing cabin luggage screening systems-but on a substantially larger scale-which does achieve the required throughput at an acceptable radiation dosage and cost...|$|E

5000|$|The cartoon is told in {{the form}} of a {{monologue}} and begins with narration by a young boy, who tells of his dog, Bartholomew, who is friendly with everyone but is bullied by the family's cat which eats all of his food and wins the attention of the kids. One day, Bartholomew's tail is accidentally run over by a young boy on a bicycle, which leads the dog to hate wheels. He begins to terrorise the neighbourhood, stealing wheels from bicycles and other vehicles, and burying them in the family's garden. The narrator explains [...] "when he was little, he took little wheels, but when he got big, he took big wheels." [...] Eventually, Bartholomew is lifted into an airplane's <b>luggage</b> <b>hold</b> whilst trying to remove one of its rear wheels, and he ends up somewhere in the Middle East. Bartholomew gets very lonely in his new environment because no-one wants to play with him or even look at him, as stated by the narrator. Worse still, there are no wheels for him to chase. Eventually, Bartholomew gets fed up with being ignored and decides to go home the same way he left, by travelling in the airplane which took him there. He boards a plane bound for the United States and is soon home again. The narrator explains that Bartholomew no longer hates wheels but [...] "does hate what dogs are supposed to hate- cats.", with Bartholomew chasing the cat away from his food bowl as the cartoon ends.|$|R
