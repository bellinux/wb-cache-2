25|$|When the {{glucose level}} {{comes down to}} the usual {{physiologic}} value, insulin release from the β-cells slows or stops. If the blood glucose level drops lower than this, especially to dangerously low levels, release of <b>hyperglycemic</b> hormones (most prominently glucagon from islet of Langerhans alpha cells) forces release of glucose into the blood from the liver glycogen stores, supplemented by gluconeogenesis if the glycogen stores become depleted. By increasing blood glucose, the <b>hyperglycemic</b> hormones prevent or correct life-threatening hypoglycemia.|$|E
25|$|Insulin is used {{to treat}} a number of {{diseases}} including diabetes and its acute complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar <b>hyperglycemic</b> states. It is also used along with glucose to treat high blood potassium levels. Insulin was formerly used in a psychiatric treatment called insulin shock therapy.|$|E
25|$|Benign {{myoclonus}} {{can occur}} in healthy individuals and is most commonly caused by nothing other than arbitrary muscle contractions. Myoclonus may develop in response to infection, hyperosmolar <b>hyperglycemic</b> state, head or spinal cord injury, stroke, stress, brain tumors, kidney or liver failure, lipid storage disease, chemical or drug poisoning, as {{a side effect of}} certain drugs (such as tramadol, quinolones, benzodiazepine, gabapentin, sertraline, lamotrigine), or other disorders.|$|E
25|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} (DM), {{commonly referred}} to as diabetes, is a group of metabolic disorders in which there are high blood sugar levels over a prolonged period. Symptoms of high blood sugar include frequent urination, increased thirst, and increased hunger. If left untreated, diabetes can cause many complications. Acute complications can include diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar <b>hyperglycemic</b> state, or death. Serious long-term complications include cardiovascular disease, stroke, chronic kidney disease, foot ulcers, and damage to the eyes.|$|E
25|$|Insulin {{is used as}} a {{medication}} to treat high blood sugar. This includes in diabetes mellitus type 1, diabetes mellitus type 2, gestational diabetes, and complications of diabetes such as diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar <b>hyperglycemic</b> states. It is also used along with glucose to treat high blood potassium levels. Typically it is given by injection under the skin, but some forms may also be used by injection into a vein or muscle.|$|E
25|$|Exercise is a {{particularly}} potent tool for glucose control in those who have diabetes mellitus. In a situation of elevated blood glucose (hyperglycemia), moderate exercise can induce greater glucose disposal than appearance, thereby decreasing total plasma glucose concentrations. As stated above, the mechanism for this glucose disposal is independent of insulin, which makes it particularly well-suited for people with diabetes. In addition, {{there appears to be}} an increase in sensitivity to insulin for approximately 12–24 hours post-exercise. This is particularly useful for those who have type II diabetes and are producing sufficient insulin but demonstrate peripheral resistance to insulin signaling. However, during extreme <b>hyperglycemic</b> episodes, people with diabetes should avoid exercise due to potential complications associated with ketoacidosis. Exercise could exacerbate ketoacidosis by increasing ketone synthesis in response to increased circulating NEFA's.|$|E
25|$|Nonketotic hyperosmolar {{syndrome}} (also {{known as}} <b>hyperglycemic</b> hyperosmolar syndrome) {{is a rare}} but extremely serious complication of untreated canine diabetes, which is a medical emergency. It shares the symptoms of extreme hyperglycemia, dehydration, and lethargy with ketoacidosis; because there is some insulin in the system, the body does not begin to turn to using fat as its energy source {{and there is no}} ketone production. There is not sufficient insulin available to the body for proper uptake of glucose, but there is enough to prevent ketone formation. The problem of dehydration in NHS is more profound than in diabetic ketoacidosis. Seizures and coma are possible. Treatment {{is similar to that of}} ketoacidosis, with the exceptions being that NHS requires that the blood glucose levels and rehydration be normalized at a slower rate than for DKA; cerebral edema is possible if the treatment progresses too rapidly.|$|E
500|$|Diabetic {{ketoacidosis}} {{is distinguished}} from other diabetic emergencies {{by the presence}} of large amounts of ketones in blood and urine, and marked metabolic acidosis. Hyperosmolar <b>hyperglycemic</b> state (HHS, sometimes labeled [...] "hyperosmolar non-ketotic state" [...] or HONK) is much more common in type 2 diabetes and features increased plasma osmolarity (above 320mosm/kg) due to profound dehydration and concentration of the blood; mild acidosis and ketonemia may occur in this state, but not to the extent observed in DKA. There is a degree of overlap between DKA and HHS, as in DKA the osmolarity may also be increased.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the initial}} process of {{regulation}} and periodically thereafter, {{the effectiveness of}} the insulin dose at controlling blood glucose needs to be evaluated. This is done by a series of blood glucose tests called a curve. [...] Blood samples are taken and tested at intervals of one to two hours over a 12- or 24-hour period. The results are generally transferred into graph form for easier interpretation. They are compared against the feeding and insulin injection times for judgment. The curve provides information regarding the action of the insulin in the animal. It is used to determine insulin dose adjustments, determine lowest and highest blood glucose levels, discover insulin duration and, in the case of continued hyperglycemia, whether the cause is insufficient insulin dose or Somogyi rebound, where blood glucose levels initially reach hypoglycemic levels and are brought to <b>hyperglycemic</b> ones by the body's counterregulatory hormones. Curves also provide evidence of insulin resistance which may be caused by medications other than insulin or by disorders other than diabetes which further testing can help identify.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hyperglycemic</b> clamp technique: The plasma glucose {{concentration}} is acutely raised to 125 mg/dl above basal levels by a continuous infusion of glucose. This <b>hyperglycemic</b> plateau is maintained by adjustment of a variable glucose infusion, {{based on the}} rate of insulin secretion and glucose metabolism. Because the plasma glucose {{concentration is}} held constant, the glucose infusion rate is an index of insulin secretion and glucose metabolism. The <b>hyperglycemic</b> clamps are often used to assess insulin secretion capacity.|$|E

50|$|Hyperinsulinemia in {{neonates}} can be {{the result}} of a variety of environmental and genetic factors. If the mother of the infant is a diabetic, and does not properly control her blood glucose levels, the <b>hyperglycemic</b> maternal blood can create a <b>hyperglycemic</b> environment in the fetus. To compensate for the increased blood glucose levels, fetal pancreatic beta cells can undergo hyperplasia. The rapid division of beta cells results in increased levels of insulin being secreted to compensate for the high blood glucose levels. Following birth, the <b>hyperglycemic</b> maternal blood is no longer accessible to the neonate resulting in a rapid drop in the newborn’s blood glucose levels. As insulin levels are still elevated this may result in hypoglycemia. To treat the condition, high concentration doses of glucose are given to the neonate as required maintaining normal blood glucose levels. The hyperinsulinemia condition subsides after one to two days.|$|E

50|$|Azaserine {{inhibits}} {{the rate}} limiting step of the metabolic hexosamine pathway and an irreversibly inhibits γ-glutamyltransferase by acting directly at the substrate-binding pocket. Independent of hexosamine pathway inhibition, azaserine has been demonstrated to protect against <b>hyperglycemic</b> endothelial damage by elevating serum concentrations of manganese-superoxide dismutase, directly reducing the concentration of reactive oxygen species.|$|E
50|$|Hyperglycemia, or {{high blood}} sugar (also spelled {{hyperglycaemia}} or hyperglycæmia) {{is a condition}} in which an excessive amount of glucose circulates in the blood plasma. This is generally a blood sugar level higher than 11.1 mmol/l (200 mg/dl), but symptoms may not start to become noticeable until even higher values such as 15-20 mmol/l (~250-300 mg/dl). A subject with a consistent range between ~5.6 and ~7 mmol/l (100-126 mg/dl) (American Diabetes Association guidelines) is considered slightly <b>hyperglycemic,</b> while above 7 mmol/l (126 mg/dl) is generally held to have diabetes. For diabetics, glucose levels that are considered to be too <b>hyperglycemic</b> can vary from person to person, mainly due to the person's renal threshold of glucose and overall glucose tolerance. On average however, chronic levels above 10-12 mmol/L (180-216 mg/dL) can produce noticeable organ damage over time.|$|E
50|$|Hyperosmolar <b>hyperglycemic</b> state (HHS) is a {{complication}} of diabetes mellitus in which high blood sugar results in high osmolarity without significant ketoacidosis. Symptoms include signs of dehydration, weakness, legs cramps, trouble seeing, and an altered level of consciousness. Onset is typically over days to weeks. Complications may include seizures, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, mesenteric artery occlusion, or rhabdomyolysis.|$|E
50|$|In the 1920s, Kimball and Murlin studied {{pancreatic}} extracts, {{and found}} an additional substance with <b>hyperglycemic</b> properties. They described glucagon in 1923. The amino acid sequence of glucagon was described in the late 1950s. A more complete understanding of its role in physiology and disease was not established until the 1970s, when a specific radioimmunoassay was developed.|$|E
50|$|The {{risks of}} {{maternal}} diabetes {{to the developing}} fetus include miscarriage, growth restriction, growth acceleration, fetal obesity (macrosomia), mild neurological deficits, polyhydramnios and birth defects.

50|$|Obese Zucker rats {{have high}} levels of lipids and {{cholesterol}} in their bloodstream, are resistant to insulin without being <b>hyperglycemic,</b> and gain weight from an increase in both the size and number of fat cells.

50|$|While {{glucagon}} {{can be used}} clinically {{to treat}} various forms of hypoglycemia, it is contraindicated in patients with pheochromocytoma, as it can induce the tumor to release catecholamines, leading to a sudden elevation in blood pressure. Likewise, glucagon is contraindicated in patients with an insulinoma, as its <b>hyperglycemic</b> effect can induce the tumor to release insulin, leading to rebound hypoglycemia.|$|E
5000|$|In a <b>hyperglycemic</b> state, the {{affinity}} of aldose reductase for glucose rises, causing much sorbitol to accumulate, {{and using}} much more NADPH, leaving less NADPH for other processes of cellular metabolism.

50|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that the MGAT4A isoenzyme acts as a toggle for developing of type 2 diabetes. Mice that lack MGAT4A are <b>hyperglycemic</b> and hypoinsulinemic and have impaired glucose tolerance. Moreover, MGAT4A normally protects mice from developing diabetes but is suppressed by high-fat diet. If this mechanism also operates in human islets, MGAT4A may represent a link between type 2 diabetes and high-fat diet.|$|E
