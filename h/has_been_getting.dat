5|$|Mars has a {{relatively}} pronounced orbital eccentricity of about 0.09; {{of the seven}} other planets in the Solar System, only Mercury has a larger orbital eccentricity. It is known that in the past, Mars has had a much more circular orbit. At one point, 1.35 million Earth years ago, Mars had an eccentricity of roughly 0.002, much {{less than that of}} Earth today. Mars's cycle of eccentricity is 96,000 Earth years compared to Earth's cycle of 100,000 years. Mars has a much longer cycle of eccentricity, with a period of 2.2 million Earth years, and this overshadows the 96,000-year cycle in the eccentricity graphs. For the last 35,000 years, the orbit of Mars <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>getting</b> slightly more eccentric because of the gravitational effects of the other planets. The closest distance between Earth and Mars will continue to mildly decrease for the next 25,000 years.|$|E

In addition, Pennsylvania law prohibits the state from selling grave sites, so the hospital's own cemetery, in which many of the patients were buried with simple stones marked only with index numbers, remains state-owned.

500|$|In November 2015 the Union of Concerned Scientists {{published}} {{a new report}} comparing two battery electric vehicles (BEVs) with similar gasoline vehicles by examining their global warming emissions over their full life-cycle, cradle-to-grave analysis. The two BEVs modeled, midsize and full-size, {{are based on the}} two most popular BEV models sold in the United States in 2015, the Nissan Leaf and the Tesla Model S. The study found that all-electric cars representative of those sold today, on average produce less than half the global warming emissions of comparable gasoline-powered vehicles, despite taken into account the higher emissions associated with BEV manufacturing. Considering the regions where the two most popular electric cars are being sold, excess manufacturing emissions are offset within 6 to 16 months of average driving. The study also concluded that driving an average EV results in lower global warming emissions than driving a gasoline car that gets [...] in regions covering two-thirds of the U.S. population, up from 45% in 2009. Based on where EVs are being sold in the United States in 2015, the average EV produces global warming emissions equal to a gasoline vehicle with a [...] fuel economy rating. The authors identified two main reason for the fact that EV-related emissions have become even lower {{in many parts of the}} country since the first study was conducted in 2012. Electricity generation <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>getting</b> cleaner, as coal-fired generation has declined while lower-carbon alternatives have increased. In addition, electric cars are becoming more efficient. For example, the Nissan Leaf and the Chevrolet Volt, have undergone improvements to increase their efficiencies compared to the original models launched in 2010, and other even more efficient BEV models, such as the most lightweight and efficient BMW i3, have entered the market.|$|E
500|$|Friedman {{defended his}} {{activity}} in Chile {{on the grounds}} that, in his opinion, the adoption of free market policies not only improved the economic situation of Chile but {{also contributed to the}} amelioration of Pinochet's rule and to the eventual transition to a democratic government during 1990. That idea is included in Capitalism and Freedom, in which he declared that economic freedom is not only desirable in itself but is also a necessary condition for political freedom. In his 1980 documentary Free to Choose, he said the following: [...] "Chile is not a politically free system, and I do not condone the system. But the people there are freer than the people in Communist societies because government plays a smaller role. ...The conditions {{of the people in the}} past few years <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>getting</b> better and not worse. They would be still better to get rid of the junta and to be able to have a free democratic system." [...] In 1984, Friedman stated that he has [...] "never refrained from criticizing the political system in Chile." [...] In 1991 he said: [...] "I have nothing good to say about the political regime that Pinochet imposed. It was a terrible political regime. The real miracle of Chile is not how well it has done economically; the real miracle of Chile is that a military junta was willing to go against its principles and support a free market regime designed by principled believers in a free market. [...] In Chile, the drive for political freedom, that was generated by economic freedom and the resulting economic success, ultimately resulted in a referendum that introduced political democracy. Now, at long last, Chile has all three things: political freedom, human freedom and economic freedom. Chile will continue to be an interesting experiment to watch to see whether it can keep all three or whether, now that it has political freedom, that political freedom will tend to be used to destroy or reduce economic freedom." [...] He stressed that the lectures he gave in Chile were the same lectures he later gave in China and other socialist states.|$|E
500|$|By [...] "All the Madame's Men", McCown-Levy {{felt that}} Agents of Hydra was [...] "the most {{consistently}} entertaining arc the series has ever done. The show has had higher highs, but never this constant {{a level of}} quality. I've argued several times of late that Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>getting</b> steadily better each season, and even in a year that had strong arcs like Ghost Rider and LMD, this final storyline tops them all ... the show has essentially managed to create an alternate reality where it can work out longstanding issues and address unfinished character beats, all while smartly delivering action and thrills ... And insofar as this keeps working, it's managed to turn the TV equivalent of a fun B-movie into a superior television show." [...] Overall, Schwartz awarded the season an 8.8 out of 10, stating the season was [...] "the best [...] ever been, maturing as a show and learning the right lessons from what's come before." [...] She praised the pod format, saying it [...] "helped tighten the season {{and give it a}} stronger throughline" [...] and added that each new pod the season introduced was more successful than the previous, with the Agents of Hydra pod and Framework story arc possibly the strongest of the entire series. Schwartz also spoke fondly of the guest stars throughout the season, particularly Jansen, who she called [...] "the season's MVP" [...] and felt [...] "stole the show" [...] with Aida, who was [...] "the standout new character" [...] of the season. Some negatives on the season were the additional villains, Eli Morrow and the Superior (not [...] "a particularly standout villain", and never [...] "as imposing or terrifying as he should have been", respectively), and some of the early effects work, though she also praised [...] "the great CGI work" [...] with Ghost Rider. Den of Geeks Rob Leane also praised the pod format, saying it [...] "fixed the 22-episode problem". He felt the Ghost Rider pod had amazing visual effects, and was a [...] "natural" [...] length that other series may have stretched further. He also highlighted Wen's performance as LMD May in the LMD pod and the Agents of Hydra pod's Mack and Hope storyline, and praised the guest performances of Luna and Jansen (feeling that bringing the latter two together in the finale [...] "was the perfect way to wrap things up"). Leane called the season [...] "a master class in how Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D. can thrive going forward ... the writers keep throwing in more sci-fi concepts, the special effects team keep delivering, and the cast keep stepping up their game to keep up with it all." ...|$|E

Meanwhile, the cost of living has increased by 26 percent in the last five years, according to Giordano.|$|E

2500|$|On July 1, 1971, Felt was {{promoted}} by Hoover to Deputy Associate Director, assisting Associate Director Clyde Tolson. Hoover's right-hand man for decades, Tolson was in failing health {{and no longer}} able to attend to his duties. Richard Gid Powers wrote that Hoover installed Felt to rein in William C. Sullivan's domestic spying operations, as Sullivan had been engaged in secret unofficial work for the White House. In his memoir, Felt quoted Hoover as having said, [...] "I need someone who can control Sullivan. I think you know he <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>getting</b> out of hand." [...] In his book, The Bureau, Ronald Kessler said that Felt [...] "managed to please Hoover by being tactful with him and tough on agents."

2500|$|The {{trial has}} been seen as a test case of the {{acceptable}} limits of pornography. Mary Beth Buchanan was the federal prosecutor in the case.

And that's why it's important to enforce the law, and to show the producers that there are limits. There are limits to what they can sell and distribute throughout the country" [...] Ms. Buchanan has also stated that [...] "The lack of enforcement of federal obscenity laws during the 1990s has led to a proliferation of obscenity throughout the United States, such as the violent and degrading material charged in this case." [...] Buchanan has said that Zicari's comments on the Frontline program [...] "helped us to determine {{that this was not a}} producer who was trying to comply with the law" ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{origin of}} the various colonies that make up this 'mega-colony' has never been fully established, however {{it is known that}} bets travel from other parts of Africa {{including}} Congo. [...] Studies indicate that the abundance of fruits during the season are the major reason for the migration. The bats arrival starts gradually {{during the first week of}} October, numbers peak in November and early December. Numbers start to decrease around the second week of December. The departure of the last bats <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>getting</b> later over recent years, with the final bats now generally leaving Kasanka in early January. [...] A study published in the African Journal of Ecology indicated that the migratory impact of the bats could ultimately threaten the viability of the seasonal roost as it increases faster tree mortality. The Kasanka Trust undertakes an extensive fire management program to protect the forest from the devastating fires which over time has reduced the size of the forest. A 'Fire Exclusion Zone' has been established which over time will allow natural regeneration of the bats forest in order to protect the unique phenomenon.|$|E
