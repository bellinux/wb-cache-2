5|$|The episode {{begins as}} Walt furiously notices a motion-detecting {{surveillance}} camera {{that has been}} installed in the lab. Later that day, Skyler convinces Walt {{in a meeting with}} Saul to buy the car wash by mentioning how the owner insulted his manhood. She devises a plan to trick the owner into selling by having a con artist (supplied by Saul) pretend to be a water-tester who is shutting down the business out of concerns over contaminants. The owner promptly sells to her, agreeing to an even lower price than her original offer. Jesse is still feeling numb from recent events, attempting to clear his head with nostalgic go-kart trips. He continues to open his house up for all-night drug-fueled orgies, deliberately throwing piles of money {{in the midst of the}} chaos. Angry and frustrated by Hank's continuous cold shoulder, Marie resumes her kleptomania; she starts stealing objects from real-estate open houses, where she also makes up elaborate stories about who she is, but is eventually caught by a real-estate agent. A livid Hank pulls strings with a senior police officer to <b>get</b> <b>her</b> <b>out</b> of being charged. The same officer drops by the Schrader residence to seek Hank's help by giving him Gale's lab notes to look at. Hank initially shoves away the notebook, but begins to read it later that night.|$|E
5|$|After Zainab and Jane {{argue in}} the street Zainab and Yusef return home. Zainab slaps Yusef after he says Kamil will be an outcast to him but Yusef slaps Zainab back. Yusef then hastily {{arranges}} a flight for himself, Zainab and Kamil to Pakistan, but Zainab purposefully discards her passport to prevent the trip. Yusef then kidnaps Kamil, telling Zainab that he is being kept {{in a safe place}} and refuses to let Zainab see him. After about four days of not knowing, Yusef takes Zainab to a café in the High Street, where a relative returns Kamil to Zainab. During the visit, it emerges that Yusef told Bushra's family that Zainab had a nervous breakdown, which is why he needed to have Kamil looked after. When Yusef takes a call outside the café, Zainab tries to escape with Kamil through an emergency exit {{in the back of the}} shop. However, Yusef guessed her plan and was waiting for her outside the exit. As she tried to escape, Yusef warned her that he knows everything, and if she leaves him, he will kill Tamwar and Kamil. Masood races to the restaurant and secretly promises that he'll do whatever it takes to <b>get</b> <b>her</b> <b>out</b> of her marriage to Yusef. Zainab finally stands up to Yusef and refuses to leave for Pakistan. Yusef attacks her and after learning that Masood has Kamil, retaliates towards Yusef. Yusef drugs Zainab, and the family return to the house. Masood punches Yusef before calling the police. Afia confronts Yusef and orders him to leave. Yusef is later found by Masood at the bed and breakfast with a match and some petrol. Yusef attacks Masood and lights a fire leaving Masood for dead. Shirley Carter (Linda Henry) and Christian put the fire out but the fire is later reignited trapping Masood, Phil and Denise inside. Yusef taunts Zainab outside. Zainab lies and tells him that Afia is in the building and he runs in followed by Tamwar. Masood is later rescued and as Yusef remains upstairs he realises that Afia is in fact outside. Realising Zainab tricked him, he briefly smiles, and the floor collapses beneath him and he succumbs to the flames, killing him. The following day, firefighters retrieve his body. He leaves everything to Zainab in his will.|$|E

During their flight, they left their 6-year-old daughter Ivana, Veronika's mother, behind. The initial plan to <b>get</b> <b>her</b> <b>out</b> of the country following their escape failed and it wasn't until 20years later that they could meet again, when Ivana also first met her sister Sandy, Kevin Dahlgren's mother, who {{had been born in}} the USA.

Meanwhile, Mallory goes into the sinkhole to investigate, but finds herself unable to breathe and surrounded by the small snake-like dragons. They manage to <b>get</b> <b>her</b> <b>out</b> and put three of the creatures in a jar. They figure that the creatures produce methane, which makes the air around them unbreathable, and realize that these were the creatures that the giants ate in order to breathe fire (which they originally believed to be salamanders).|$|E
25|$|While {{working at}} a Centreville Italian restaurant, she met Ronald Roldan, a Bolivian {{immigrant}} then around 30, and began an extramarital affair with him, possibly because he offered to help her with babysitting. By late 2010, the Deckers' marriage had begun to suffer; Bethany moved to a separate apartment in Ashburn, Virginia, at least temporarily. Roldan soon followed. According to her family, she quickly {{found that he was}} abusive, possessive, and controlling. Several times a day, he demanded that she send him a picture of herself from her cellphone to prove that she was not with anyone else. Her parents began developing a plan to <b>get</b> <b>her</b> <b>out</b> of the relationship. By the end of the year, she was pregnant again, likely by Roldan.|$|E

500|$|The magazine’s genre was air {{adventure}} stories, some {{set against}} a war background, written by well-known authors such as Lester Dent, Donald E. Keyhoe, Joe Archibald, and Arch Whitehouse. [...] With the exception of Keyhoe and Whitehouse, who was with the RAF in World War I, the authors had no personal knowledge of flying. [...] The plot invariably centered on a hero — a military pilot — trapped in a difficult situation, from which he would extricate himself utilizing exceptional flying skills. [...] The stories never featured any love interest or profanity. [...] Attempts to introduce such elements were soundly rejected by the readership. [...] According to Whitehouse, he tried hard to introduce a [...] "seductive secretary" [...] character to the Kerry Keene series, but the effort was met with numerous letters from readers demanding that he [...] "Get rid of the broad. <b>Get</b> <b>her</b> <b>out</b> of the series of Kerry Keene stories." ...|$|E
500|$|In early 1657 Dyer {{returned}} to New England with the widow Ann Burden, {{who came to}} Boston to settle the estate of her late husband.

[...] Dyer nevertheless continued to travel in New England to preach her Quaker message, and in early 1658 was arrested in the New Haven Colony, and then expelled for preaching her [...] "inner light" [...] belief, and the notion that women and men stood on equal ground in church worship and organization.

500|$|The reverse {{cover of}} Aladdins {{original}} home video release proudly touted Jasmine as [...] "a heroine of the Nineties." [...] However, It's Not the Media: The Truth about Pop Culture's Influence on Children author Karen Sternheimer strongly disagreed with this sentiment, writing that despite being [...] "strong-willed and almost given feminist qualities", Jasmine nonetheless [...] "resembles heroines of old, {{waiting for her}} 'prince' to come and rescue her and using traditional feminine wiles to <b>get</b> <b>her</b> <b>out</b> of trouble." [...] The character continues to be heavily discussed among feminist critics. Bustle included Jasmine's first encounter with Aladdin on the website's ranking of the most feminist Disney Princess moments, with author Samantha Rullo crediting the scene with demonstrating [...] "how strong-willed and independent she truly is." [...] In a similar [...] "Feminist Ranking Of All The Disney Princesses", Bustles Chelsea Maze appreciated Jasmine for refusing [...] "to let the men in her life boss her around", ultimately placing the character at number eight because she possesses [...] "the agency to choose her own mate and follow her heart, all while financially supporting the guy she loves." [...] Mize concluded that Jasmine is [...] "a pretty strong woman with a solid feminist streak".|$|E

[...] Ratcliff was also critical that Sue was not more of a feminist: [...] "I was under the impression she'd become more assertive. I had visions of a bunch of feminists walking into the cafe one day {{right in the middle of}} a typical Sue and Ali fight, and them asking her why she puts up with him. No doubt Sue would screw up her nose and ask: 'What do you mean?' But she'd think about it, want to hear more and gradually begin to change her ways to become stronger, more independent!

2500|$|In Kalamazoo, {{with cold}} weather around 40 degrees and windy, both teams’ {{managers}} agreed {{to play the}} Game 2 in just seven innings. Risinger started for the Chicks and pitched {{one of the best}} games of her career. Grand Rapids gave her a one-run lead in the second inning, and wrapped up the scoring by producing three runs in the sixth, keyed by a two-run double off the bat of Ricketts. Risinger gave up a RBI single to Jean Lovell, and yielded only one extra-base hit, a solo home run by Doris Sams during Kalamazoo's two-run rally in the sixth inning. In the bottom of the seventh, the Lassies tried to rally again. Fern Shollenberger opened with a single, but Risinger retired the next two batters. Nevertheless, she lost her control temporarily and issued back-to-back walks to Schroeder and Peppas. With the bases loaded, Woody English {{was on the verge of}} yanking Risinger, but he instead sent Ziegler to the pitching mound. Pulling off her glove, the [...] Ziegler looked up at the tall Risinger. Okay, Beansie, can you <b>get</b> <b>her</b> <b>out?</b> she asked.

Snapping the brim of her cap in place, the diminutive Ziegler energetically ordered, Well do it! As a result, Risinger faced the dangerous Sams and struck out her on three straight fastballs. She fanned nine Lassies batters and walked four in completing her pitching gem.|$|E
