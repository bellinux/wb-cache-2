5|$|Once in Ravenna, Helmichis and Rosamund rapidly became estranged. According to Paul, Longinus persuaded Rosamund to <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> husband so that {{he could}} marry her. To {{accomplish}} this, she made him drink a cup full of poison; before dying, however, Helmichis understood what his wife had done and forced her to drink the cup too, so they both died. According to Wolfram, there may be some historical truth in the account of Longinus' proposal to Rosamund, as it was possible to achieve Lombard kingship by marrying the queen, but the story of the two lovers' end is not historical but legendary. The mutual murder as told by Agnellus is given a different interpretation by Joaquin Martinez Pizarro: he sees Helmichis' last action as a symbol of how the natural hierarchy of sexes is at last restored, after the queen's actions had unnaturally modified the proper equilibrium.|$|E

25|$|Instead {{of being}} treated like a queen, Caroline found that her estranged husband's {{accession}} paradoxically made her position worse. On visiting Rome, the pope refused her an audience, and the pope's minister Cardinal Consalvi insisted that she be greeted only as a duchess of Brunswick, {{and not as a}} queen. In an attempt to assert her rights, she made plans to return to Britain. The King demanded that his ministers <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>her.</b> He successfully persuaded them to remove her name from the liturgy of the Church of England, but they would not agree to a divorce because they feared the effect of a public trial. The government was weak and unpopular, and a trial detailing salacious details of both Caroline's and George's separate love lives was certain to destabilise it further. Rather than run the risk, the government entered into negotiations with Caroline, and offered her an increased annuity of £50,000 if she stayed abroad.|$|E

500|$|As {{her time}} on the show was nearing its end, it was {{announced}} that DeGarmo was to debut a country ballad song entitled [...] "Good Goodbye". Kelly Ballhorn of Ryanseacrest.com noted that: [...] "Fans of 'Young and the Restless' and Diana have been waiting for her to sing on the show like she can in real life... well, the wait’s over". [...] "Good Goodbye" [...] was co-written by DeGarmo and her real-life fiance Ace Young, who was also a competitor on American Idol, and details Angelina's [...] "emotional journey" [...] on the show. She was approached by the show's award-winning composer David Kurtz, and he asked her to make a song for Angelina. Rodney Ho of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution said: [...] "It’s supposed to be a turning point to her character. Her character on the most part has been pushy and full of herself." [...] During an interview with TV Guide, DeGarmo said that the song will [...] "tug at your heartstrings" [...] and marks a big turning point for Angelina's storyline: [...] "where she's finally starting to grow up. She's coming to realize that she needs to <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> selfish ways. She doesn't know how to go about that like a normal person, so she does it through song." ...|$|E
500|$|The video {{received}} a mixed reception among the singer's fans. Deemed as [...] "gothic" [...] by Jean-Rémy Gaudin-Bridet of , the video has [...] "undeniable aesthetic qualities" [...] and allows [...] "great freedom of interpretation", according to author Erwan Chuberre. The French magazine Télé 7 Jours published several analyses proposed on the Internet, which gave mixed reviews, and provided {{results from a}} survey revealing that 54% of respondents deemed the video as [...] "pleasant", while 36% expressed total satisfaction. Reviewing the video in Elle magazine, the sociologist Divina Frau-Meigs wrote: [...] "This is a coherent video, with an echo of her previous provocations", adding that Farmer's sword is {{the symbol of the}} phallus, and desolate landscapes represent the impossible reconciliation of the sexes. According to Royer, the video shows a personal dimension in which Farmer [...] "finally crushes her interior demons" [...] and [...] "wants to <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> trappings as a scapegoat". Despite this, French daily newspaper France Soir deemed the video disappointing because of its lack of innovation. In contrast, the video was the number one choice of voters viewing the TV music program Les 100 Meilleurs clips du XXIè siècle (The best videos of the twenty-first century), aired on MCM on 25 February 2007.|$|E

500|$|Stone gave Charlie Sheen {{the choice}} of Jack Lemmon or Martin Sheen to play his father in the film, and Sheen picked his father. The elder Sheen related to the moral sense of his character. Stone cast Daryl Hannah as Bud Fox's materialistic girlfriend Darien Taylor, but {{felt that she was}} never happy with the role and did not know why she {{accepted}} it. He tried to explain the character to Hannah repeatedly, and thought that the materialism of the character conflicted with Hannah's idealism. Stone said later that he was aware early on that she was not right for the part. [...] "Daryl Hannah was not happy doing the role and I should have let her go. All my crew wanted to <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> after one day of shooting. My pride was such that I kept saying I {{was going to make it}} work". Stone also had difficulties with Sean Young, who made her opinions known that Hannah should be fired and that she should play that role instead. Young would show up to the set late and unprepared. She did not get along with Charlie Sheen, which caused further friction on the set. In retrospect, Stone felt that Young was right and he should have swapped Hannah's role with hers. Stone admits that he had [...] "some problems" [...] with Young, but was not willing to confirm or deny rumors that she walked off with all of her costumes when she completed filming.|$|E
500|$|Eberhardt {{made friends}} {{in the area and}} met an Algerian soldier, Slimane Ehnni. They fell in love, and {{eventually}} lived together openly. This alienated Eberhardt from the French authorities, who were already outraged by her lifestyle. During her travels she made contact with the Qadiriyya, a Sufi order. The order was led by Hussein benBrahim, who was so impressed with Eberhardt's knowledge of (and passion for) Islam that he initiated her into his zawiya without the usual formal examination. This convinced the French authorities that she was a spy or an agitator, and they placed her on a widely-circulated blacklist. The French transferred Ehnni to the spahi regiment at Batna, possibly to punish Eberhardt (whom they could not harm directly). Too poor to accompany him to Batna, Eberhardt traveled to a Qadiriyya meeting in Behima in late January 1901 where she hoped to ask SiLachmi, a marabout, for financial assistance. While waiting for the meeting to begin she was attacked by a man with a sabre, receiving a superficial wound to her head and a deep cut to her left arm. Her attacker, Abdallah ben Mohammed, was overpowered by others and arrested. When asked why he had tried to kill Eberhardt he only repeated [...] "God wished it; God still wishes it." [...] Eberhardt suspected that he was an assassin hired by the French authorities. Others attribute the attack to SiLachmi; Eberhardt was his mistress, whom he had grown tired of, and it is speculated he was simultaneously trying to <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> and pin the blame for the attack on a rival tribe. She was brought to the military hospital at ElOued the following day. After Eberhardt recovered in late February, she joined Ehnni with funds from members of the Qadiriyya who regarded her survival as a miracle.|$|E

Nick, disgusted with her actions, takes full custody of Faith from her when Sharon is unjustly arrested for murder, but continues to support her. Sharon is {{sentenced to life in}} prison and skips town, leaving everyone to believe she is dead. Nick begins a relationship with Diane Jenkins (Maura West), who is also developing a courtship with his father, Victor, at the same time. Diane is killed by Nikki in self-defense. Sharon returns and is freed with the help of lawyer Avery Bailey Clark (Jessica Collins). Nick has a short affair with Avery, until he returns to Phyllis. Phyllis becomes pregnant once more, but soon miscarries the child. Nonetheless, Nick still marries her. However, the marriage is short-lived, ending just months later, with Nick moving on to a relationship with Avery. Nick begins a new phase in his life.

When Summer finds herself attracted to Jack's son Kyle Abbott (Blake Hood), Nick panics, knowing that Summer may become involved with her biological brother. He has another DNA test performed, which appears to confirm that Nick is not Summer's biological father. However, in reality, Sharon (who has stopped taking medication to treat her bipolar disorder), altered the results in an attempt to get Nick to return to her. Nick confesses to Summer that Jack is her father. Sharon's attempts fail, and Nick and Avery become engaged; Avery misses the wedding after tending to her mentally distraught ex-boyfriend Dylan McAvoy (Steve Burton), and the relationship ends. Nick grows closer with Sharon, who continues to withhold the truth.
