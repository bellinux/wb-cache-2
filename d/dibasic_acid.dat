40|$|Although several {{workers have}} {{produced}} in vitro inhibition of the anaphylactic reaction with metabolic inhibitors (1, 2) {{and we have}} observed inhibition with chymotrypsin substrates and inhibitors (3), enhancement of the in vitro anaphylactic reaction has not been previously reported. While evaluating c-amino caproic acid, an inhibitor of plasminogen activation (4, 5), for {{its effect on the}} anaphylactic reaction in chopped guinea pig lung, we found that caproic acid (hexanoic) was a more potent inhibitor than ~-amino caproic acid. It was further observed that the ability of the unsubstituted fatty acids to inhibit the anaphylactic release of histamine increased with increasing chain length from valeric to dodecanoic acid. Substitution of the fatty acid with an alpha amino group completely abolished the inhibitory potential.

40|$|Higher {{rates of}} uptake of <b>dibasic</b> <b>acids</b> by weak base anion {{exchange}} resins, {{in comparison to}} those of monobasic acids, have been satisfactorily explained {{on the basis of}} dual site adsorption of divalent anion on the protonated resin sites.

Hence, there is practically no exclusion of co-ions from the pores of the resin. The extent of reversibility of sorption is considerably less as a result of less repulsion of H+ ions from the pore surface than that observed in monobasic acids.
