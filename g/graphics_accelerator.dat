2500|$|The game company Nintendo {{worked closely}} with Argonaut {{during the early years}} of the NES and SNES. They {{developed}} a prototype on the NES, initially codenamed [...] "NESGlider", which was inspired by their earlier 8-bit game Starglider, and ported this prototype to the SNES. Programmer Jez San told Nintendo that this was as good as it could get unless they were allowed to design custom hardware to make the SNES better at 3D. Nintendo assented to this, and San hired chip designers to make the Super FX chip, the first 3D <b>graphics</b> <b>accelerator</b> in a consumer product. The Super FX was so much more powerful than the SNES's standard processor that the development team joked that the SNES was just a box to hold the chip.|$|E
