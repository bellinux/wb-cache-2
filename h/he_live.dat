25|$|The Police Central E-Crime Unit arrested an 18-year-old {{man from}} Shetland on 27 July 2011 {{suspected}} of being LulzSec member Topiary.

Scotland Yard later identified the man arrested as Yell, Shetland resident Jake Davis. He was charged with unauthorized access of a computer under the Computer Misuse Act 1990, encouraging or assisting criminal activity under the Serious Crime Act 2007, conspiracy to launch a denial-of-service attack against the Serious Organised Crime Unit contrary to the Criminal Law Act 1977, and criminal conspiracy also under the Criminal Law Act 1977.

500|$|By {{the autumn}} of 1559 several foreign princes were vying for the Queen's hand; indignant at Elizabeth's little serious {{interest}} in their candidate, the Spanish ambassador de Quadra and his Imperial colleague were informing each other and their superiors that Lord Robert was sending his wife poison and that Elizabeth was only fooling them, [...] "keeping Lord Robert's enemies and the country engaged with words until this wicked deed of killing his wife is consummated". Parts of the nobility also held Dudley responsible for Elizabeth's failure to marry, and plots to assassinate him abounded. In March 1560 de Quadra informed PhilipII: [...] "Lord Robert told somebody … that if <b>he</b> <b>live</b> another year {{he will be in}} a very different position from now. … They say that he thinks of divorcing his wife." [...] Lady Amy never saw her husband again after her London visit in 1559. A projected trip of his to visit her and other family never materialized. Queen Elizabeth did not really allow her favourite a wife; according to a contemporary court chronicle, he [...] "was commanded to say that he did nothing with her, when he came to her, as seldom he did".|$|E
500|$|Menem {{was elected}} {{governor}} in 1973, when the proscription over Peronism was lifted.

He was detained on March 25, kept for {{a week at a}} local regiment, and then moved to a temporary prison at the ship [...] "33 Orientales" [...] in Buenos Aires. He was detained alongside former ministers Antonio Cafiero, Jorge Taiana, Miguel Unamuno, José Deheza, and Pedro Arrighi, the unionists Jorge Triaca, Diego Ibáñez, and Lorenzo Miguel, the diplomat Jorge Vázquez, the journalist Osvaldo Papaleo, and the former president Raúl Lastiri. He shared a cell with Pedro Eladio Vázquez, Juan Perón's personal physician. During this time he helped the chaplain Lorenzo Lavalle, despite being a Muslim. In July he was sent to Magdalena, to a permanent prison. His wife Zulema visited him every week, but rejected his conversion to Christianity. His mother died during {{the time he was a}} prisoner, and dictator Jorge Rafael Videla denied his request to attend her funeral.

500|$|Constantine {{had known}} death would soon come. Within the Church of the Holy Apostles, Constantine had {{secretly}} prepared a final resting-place for himself. It came sooner {{than he had}} expected. Soon after the Feast of Easter 337, Constantine fell seriously ill. He left Constantinople for the hot baths near his mother's city of Helenopolis (Altinova), on the southern shores of the Gulf of Nicomedia (present-day Gulf of İzmit). There, in a church his mother built in honor of Lucian the Apostle, he prayed, and there {{he realized that he}} was dying. Seeking purification, he became a catechumen, and attempted a return to Constantinople, making it only as far as a suburb of Nicomedia. He summoned the bishops, and told them of his hope to be baptized in the River Jordan, where Christ was written to have been baptized. He requested the baptism right away, promising to live a more Christian life should <b>he</b> <b>live</b> through his illness. The bishops, Eusebius records, [...] "performed the sacred ceremonies according to custom". He chose the Arianizing bishop Eusebius of Nicomedia, bishop of the city where he lay dying, as his baptizer. In postponing his baptism, he followed one custom at the time which postponed baptism until after infancy. It has been thought that Constantine put off baptism as long as he did so as to be absolved from as much of his sin as possible. Constantine died soon after at a suburban villa called Achyron, {{on the last day of}} the fifty-day festival of Pentecost directly following Pascha (or Easter), on 22 May 337.|$|E
500|$|Ian Brady {{was born}} in Glasgow as Ian Duncan Stewart on 2 January 1938 to Margaret [...] "Peggy" [...] Stewart, an {{unmarried}} tea room waitress. The identity of Brady's father has never been reliably ascertained, although his mother {{said he was a}} reporter working for a Glasgow newspaper, who died three months before Brady was born. Stewart had little support, and after a few months was forced to give her son into the care of Mary and John Sloan, a local couple with four children of their own. Brady took their name, and became known as Ian Sloan. His mother continued to visit him throughout his childhood. Various authors have stated that he tortured animals, although Brady objected to such accusations. Aged nine, he visited Loch Lomond with his family, where he reportedly discovered an affinity for the outdoors, and a few months later the family moved to a new council house on an overspill estate at Pollok. He was accepted for Shawlands Academy, a school for above-average pupils. At Shawlands his behaviour worsened; as a teenager he twice appeared before a juvenile court for housebreaking. He left the academy aged 15, and {{took a job as a}} tea boy at a Harland and Wolff shipyard in Govan. Nine months later, he began working as a butcher's messenger boy. He had a girlfriend, Evelyn Grant, but their relationship ended when he threatened her with a flick knife after she visited a dance with another boy. He again appeared before the court, this time with nine charges against him, and shortly before his 17th birthday he was placed on probation, on condition that <b>he</b> <b>live</b> with his mother. By then she had moved to Manchester and married an Irish fruit merchant named Patrick Brady, and it was the latter who got Brady a job as a fruit porter at Smithfield Market.|$|E

[...] However, no mention of Haremakhet's service under Shebitku is made; even if Haremakhet was only a youth under Shebitku, this king's absence is strange since {{the intent of the}} statue's text was to render a chronological {{sequence}} of kings who reigned during Horemakhet's life, each of their names being accompanied by a reference to the relationship that existed between the king mentioned and Horemakhet. This implies that when Haremakhet was born, king Shebitku was already dead which would favour a Shebitku-Shabaka succession.|$|E

Did the wise hail his teaching so that their reputation could guarantee its truth? No, to them it was foolishness. Was his teaching capable of quickly supplying the individual with a supranatural power, did it offer itself for sale to people through legerdemain? No, it had to be acquired slowly, appropriated in the ordeal that began with the renunciation of everything." [...] Would Paul have become a Christian if he knew what was in store for him? Each single individual has a future and {{there comes a time when}} a decision is made that can have long-lasting effects. Paul wrote about his own experiences in his epistles and Kierkegaard thought this was a legitimate way to preach about Christianity. But he stressed indirect communication.|$|E
2500|$|Huntley's The Dream Child, a {{study of}} occult phenomena, was {{published}} in 1892 by the Arena Publishing Company, Boston. The story was written to especially set forth the philosophic truth of universal brotherhood and endless progression. After years of study and investigation, Huntley sought answers to the two age-long problems “What is Truth?” and “If a man die shall <b>he</b> <b>live</b> again?" [...] The philosophy described in The Dream Child was the view of Huntley, with the profound belief that the philosophy enunciated is the Truth. According to the Cleveland Daily Leader, [...] "Florence Huntley has taken a fancy to depict the life to come. In this little book, nearly perfect but {{for a lack of}} the requisite imagination to firmly place before the reader the heavens and what they hold, a very daring project, a mother, after losing her daughter, goes into a mysterious trance-like condition, in which she sees and communications with the child in heaven. This continues for a good many years, until the child grows to girlhood, when a change in her surroundings makes it necessary for them to separate." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Calormene {{religion}} {{does not}} seem to be modeled on any of the monotheistic religions that are commonly practiced in these regions, such as Islam—though there may be similarities in pre-Muhammad Arab religions. Instead, the Calormenes are polytheistic and worship a plethora of gods, including the primary god Tash (meaning [...] "stone" [...] in Turkish), who is portrayed as a corporeal, stereotypical Satanic being requiring human sacrifices from his followers. The religion of the Calormenes seems more likely to have been based on early Canaanite and Carthaginian religion, which also required human sacrifice, and was portrayed as the ultimate in diabolism in G. K. Chesterton's The Everlasting Man, a book which Lewis admired. The unimaginative and business-minded nature of the Calormenes may also have been based on Chesterton's portrayal of Carthage. In the purely literary sense, however, the depiction of Calormene religion may owe something to the bogey image of Islam found in medieval romances: see Mahound and Termagant. Parts of the culture seem to have been based on E. Nesbit's depiction of Babylon (such as [...] "Tisroc" [...] as the name of the ruler, and appending [...] "may <b>he</b> <b>live</b> forever" [...] to mentions of this king).|$|E
