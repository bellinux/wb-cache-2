500|$|According to {{at least}} one account, Caion first {{encountered}} Caragiale's irony when he sent <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> Symbolist poems. The senior writer picked up on their involuntary humor, and proceeded to ridicule Caion. Literary historian Tudor Vianu believes that Caion was especially infuriated when Caragiale's magazine, Moftul Român, made a public mockery of his Secessionist prose poem. In his gibe, Caragiale feigned enthusiasm about the young writer's debut. Parodying Caion, he suggested that the young poet carry on writing a [...] "lyrical-decadent-symbolist-mystical-capillary-secessionist" [...] novel about a hairdressers' art society, whose members glue strands of hair onto canvasses or carve soap into human figures.|$|E

500|$|... {{published}} in 2011, expands {{on the original}} story with a short episode told from Gin's perspective. When Hotaru is a teenager, she shares some pudding with Gin before she leaves {{at the end of}} the summer. After Hotaru leaves, the yōkai attempt to cheer Gin up by bringing <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> persimmons, one of the most prized treats on the mountain. Impressed with the taste, Gin thinks of sharing one of these persimmons with Hotaru next year. After discussing ways to preserve the persimmon with the yōkai and a spirit named Matsumino, Gin sets off to find ice on the highest mountain peak, but is disappointed to find none during the summer. When Gin returns scratched up from his fruitless search for ice, Matsumino feels sorry for him and offers to deliver the persimmon to Hotaru for him. However, not knowing where she lives, Matsumino gets lost and grows hungry. After he returns from his unsuccessful attempt to find Hotaru, Matsumino apologizes to Gin for eating the persimmon and Gin forgives him. The story concludes with Gin seeing Hotaru the following summer and wondering if he will be able to tell her about his feelings for her.|$|E
500|$|The series {{features}} numerous song covers sung onscreen by the characters. Ryan Murphy {{was responsible}} for selecting all of the songs used, and {{has said that he}} strove to maintain a balance between chart hits and show tunes: [...] "I want there to be something for everybody in every episode. That's a tricky mix, but that's very important—the balancing of that." [...] According to Murphy, the song choices are integral to script development, [...] "Each episode has a theme at its core. After I write the script, I will choose songs that help to move the story along." [...] In a 2010 interview with Allison Kugel, Chris Colfer noted that [...] "there have been a couple of times when I have gone to Ryan Murphy (Glee creator) and told <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> things that have happened to me, and then he writes it into the show. Or he'll ask me what song I would want to sing, in this situation or in that situation. I don’t think any of us directly try to give input on the character or on the storyline, but they definitely steal things from us." [...] For the second season, a shift toward using more Top 40 songs was seen, in an effort to appeal more to the 18–49 demographic.|$|E

500|$|A {{report about}} the concert at issue {{released}} on May 26, 2010 by topzine.cz stated that [...] "one {{of the things that}} was unexpected was the behavior of the singer Randall Blythe, who on a few occasions struck some fans in a relatively brutal way off the stage." [...] The article also contains pictures, one of them showing Blythe holding a fan down on the ground. Meanwhile, another report released two days after the concert by metalopolis.net alleged that [...] "Randy in a totally uncompromising way took down an impertinent fan, who has climbed the podium several times. The front-man clearly showed that it is his territory, he struck the intruder down, punched <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> times and sent him through the air off the podium, without even stopping singing (!)" [...] On May 28, 2010, the report by marastmusic.com stated that [...] "some broken head was a testimony to the fact that the band does not like anybody on the stage", [...] while abysszine.com stated that [...] "the only negative thing about the concert was, to say it mildly, disputable approach of the band towards the stage-divers ... when somebody tried to climb the stage, he was brutally swept down." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Calcraft's {{career as}} a hangman spanned 45years, {{he appears to have}} been [...] "particularly incompetent", {{frequently}} having to [...] "rush below the scaffold to pull on his victim's legs to hasten death". Those being hanged had their arms pinioned to their sides with leather straps before being walked to the gallows, where they were placed on a trapdoor and their heads and faces covered with a white cap, or hood. The purpose of the hood was to prevent the prisoner seeing the hangman pull the lever that released the trapdoor– and thus attempting to jump at the critical moment– and to hide from spectators any agony on the dying prisoner's face. After the noose had been secured around each victim's neck and the hangman had retired to a safe distance, the trapdoor was released. The bodies were left hanging for some time to ensure that death had occurred, before being lowered to the ground. Calcraft employed the short-drop method of execution, in which the drop through the trapdoor might be around [...] or so. [...] That was often insufficient to break the prisoner's neck, and therefore death was not always instantaneous, typically occurring slowly by strangulation. Historians Anthony Stokes and Theodore Dalrymple have suggested that Calcraft's [...] "controversial" [...] use of the short-drop allowed <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> minutes to entertain the large crowds of 30,000 plus that sometimes attended his public executions. [...] "Renowned for his poor taste", he would sometimes swing from his victim's legs or climb onto their shoulders in an attempt to break their necks. In one of the first executions Calcraft carried out at the new Reading Gaol his victim, Thomas Jennings, took more than three minutes to die.|$|E

2500|$|The sport got {{its start}} in the early 1970s, {{paralleling}} the rise in popularity of Frisbee sport. [...] The definitive moment came on August 5, 1974 when Alex Stein, a 19-year-old college student from Ohio, and his dog, Ashley Whippet, jumped the fence at a nationally broadcast baseball game between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Cincinnati Reds. [...] Stein had with <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> flying discs, which he threw for the dog.

2500|$|Upon {{passing the}} eleven-plus exam, Townshend was {{enrolled}} at Acton County Grammar School. At Acton County, he was frequently bullied {{because he had}} a large nose, an experience that profoundly affected him. His grandmother Emma purchased his first guitar for Christmas in 1956, an inexpensive Spanish model. Though his father taught <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> chords, Townshend was largely self-taught on the instrument and never learned to read music. Townshend and school friend John Entwistle formed a short-lived trad jazz group, the Confederates, featuring Townshend on banjo and Entwistle on horns. The Confederates played gigs at the Congo Club, a youth club run by the Acton Congregational Church, and covered Acker Bilk, Kenny Ball, and Lonnie Donegan. However, both became influenced by the increasing popularity of rock 'n' roll, with Townshend particularly admiring Cliff Richard's debut single, [...] "Move It". Townshend left the Confederates after getting into a fight with the group's drummer, Chris Sherwin, and purchased a [...] "reasonably good Czechoslovakian guitar" [...] at his mother's antique shop.|$|E

I had to escape out of his house at 5 in the morning. He packed a bigger punch than mine." [...] She told a similar story to an interviewer from Hot Press in December 1990. Prince said the events she described never took place, replying to the allegations in his song [...] "Days of Wild", which deals with misogyny. In a 2004 interview with Graham Norton, O'Connor claimed that the story was [...] "much exaggerated by the press" [...] and referred to him as [...] "a sweet guy".|$|E
