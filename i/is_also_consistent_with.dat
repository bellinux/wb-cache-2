5|$|The {{arterial}} bubble assumption <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> {{the accidental}} production of arterial bubbles. One scenario considers a shunt {{at the heart}} or lung level that passes bubbles from the venous to the arterial side. A patent foramen ovale (PFO) is thought to only open in certain conditions. A PFO conveniently explains neurological accidents after recreational air diving without any procedure violation, {{but it does not}} explain vestibular hits in deep diving. Vestibular symptoms can appear very early in the decompression, long before the massive bubble production required to overload the system.|$|E
5|$|University {{president}} Robert Bruininks {{originally planned}} to have the school apply for a state liquor license in order to serve beer and wine in limited areas of the stadium. Under his proposal, alcohol would have been available only to occupants of premium season ticket seats ranging in price from $1,800 to $45,000 a year. This is/was consistent with the University's long-held alcohol policy at other on-campus athletic venues, such as Williams Arena and Mariucci Arena. This <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> other NCAA institutions (including all other Big Ten Conference teams except for the University of Michigan) with on campus stadiums. No Big Ten stadiums serve alcohol in their general seating.|$|E
5|$|An empty matrix is {{a matrix}} {{in which the}} number of rows or columns (or both) is zero. Empty {{matrices}} help dealing with maps involving the zero vector space. For example, if A is a 3-by-0 matrix and B is a 0-by-3 matrix, then AB is the 3-by-3 zero matrix corresponding to the null map from a 3-dimensional space V to itself, while BA is a 0-by-0 matrix. There is no common notation for empty matrices, but most computer algebra systems allow creating and computing with them. The determinant of the 0-by-0 matrix is 1 as follows from regarding the empty product occurring in the Leibniz formula for the determinant as 1. This value <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> {{the fact that the}} identity map from any finite dimensional space to itself has determinant1, a fact that is often used {{as a part of the}} characterization of determinants.|$|E

25|$|It <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> ZF + DC {{that every}} set of reals is Lebesgue measurable; however, this {{consistency}} result, due to Robert M. Solovay, cannot be proved in ZFC itself, but requires a mild large cardinal assumption (the {{existence of an}} inaccessible cardinal). The much stronger axiom of determinacy, or AD, implies that every set of reals is Lebesgue measurable, has the property of Baire, and has the perfect set property (all three of these results are refuted by AC itself). ZF + DC + AD is consistent provided that a sufficiently strong large cardinal axiom is consistent (the existence of infinitely many Woodin cardinals).|$|E
25|$|The {{orientation}} of the rings is consistent with an edge-on view from Earth in 2008, explaining the observed dimming of Chariklo between 1997 and 2008 {{by a factor of}} 1.75, as well as the gradual disappearance of water ice and other materials from its spectrum as the observed surface area of the rings decreased. Also consistent with this edge-on orientation is that since 2008, the Chariklo system has increased in brightness by a factor of 1.5 again, and the infrared water-ice spectral features have reappeared. This suggests that the rings are composed at least partially of water ice. An icy ring composition <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> the expected density of a disrupted body within Chariklo's Roche limit.|$|E
25|$|Alternations in Italian {{heteroclitic}} nouns such as l'uovo fresco ("the fresh egg") / le uova fresche ("the fresh eggs") {{are usually}} analysed as masculine in the singular and feminine in the plural, with an irregular plural in -a. However, it <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> their historical development {{to say that}} uovo is simply a regular neuter noun (ovum, plural ova) and that the characteristic ending for words agreeing with these nouns is -o in the singular and -a in the plural. The same alternation in gender exists in certain Romanian nouns, but is considered regular as it is more common than in Italian. Thus, a relict neuter gender can arguably be said to persist in Italian and Romanian.|$|E

25|$|Both Atlamál and Atlakviða are {{referred}} to as Greenlandic poems in the Codex Regius. Most scholars believe Atlakviða to be older than the Norse colony in Greenland and reject a Greenlandic origin for that poem. Atlamál, on the other hand, is believed to be of an age consistent with composition in Greenland. Moreover, some aspects of the poem itself are suggestive of Greenland. In particular one of Kostbera's ominous dreams has a realistic description of a polar bear. The grim tone of the poem <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> what is known of the Greenland settlement. The relatively mean conditions of the chieftains in the poemthe Niflungar, for example, have only 10 retainershave also been taken as strengthening the case for an origin in Greenlandic culture.|$|E
25|$|The god of {{nighttime}} lightning {{has been}} interpreted as an aspect of Jupiter, either a chthonic manifestation of the god or a separate god of the underworld. A statue of Summanus stood {{on the roof of}} the Temple of Capitoline Jupiter, and Iuppiter Summanus is one of the epithets of Jupiter. Dumézil sees the opposition Dius Fidius versus Summanus as complementary, interpreting it as typical to the inherent ambiguity of the sovereign god exemplified by that of Mitra and Varuna in Vedic religion. The complementarity of the epithets is shown in inscriptions found on puteals or bidentals reciting either fulgur Dium conditum or fulgur Summanum conditum in places struck by daytime versus nighttime lightning bolts respectively. This <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> the etymology of Summanus, deriving from sub and mane (the time before morning).|$|E
25|$|Although paleomagnetic {{evidence}} {{can be used}} to {{rule out}} the 1850s as the age of Cinder Cone, it does not provide an actual age for its eruption. By measuring levels of carbon-14 in samples of wood from trees killed by the eruption of Cinder Cone, USGS scientists obtained a radiocarbon date for the eruption of between 1630 and 1670. Such a date <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> the remnant magnetization preserved in the lava flows. The series of eruptions that produced the volcanic deposits at Cinder Cone were complex and are by no means completely understood. However, the new studies done by USGS scientists refute the purported accounts of an eruption in the early 1850s and confirm Diller’s (1891, 1893) interpretation that Cinder Cone erupted {{in the latter half of}} the 17th century. They also suggest that the 1666 tree-ring date proposed by Finch (1937) for his “second” explosive eruption at Cinder Cone might actually date the entire eruptive sequence.|$|E

25|$|Fulgentius’s work {{demonstrates}} a clear {{continuation of the}} antique Roman compendium tradition. This concise encyclopaedic style of compiling information was common for Roman writers like Cato the Elder and Cicero. His work <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> the Stoic and Neoplatonic traditions which interpreted myth as a representation of deeper spiritual processes. His allegorical approach to mythography may have originated in the no-longer-extant Virgil commentary of Aelius Donatus, and it was certainly evident in the later moralising Virgil commentaries of Servius. Fulgentius’s treatment of Virgil as a sage {{seems to have been}} borrowed from the encyclopaedic work of Macrobius, the first to elevate the Roman poet to such an authoritative status. However, Fulgentiuss’ tendency to strip classical myth of all its manifest detail and replace it with ethical interpretations appears to {{have more in common with}} the late 5th-century writer Martianus Capella. Capella’s work brought the theme of life as a spiritual journey to the forefront of Classical literature, a trend which Fulgentius seemed to carry a step further.|$|E
