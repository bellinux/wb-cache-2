5|$|As with {{equipped}} items, Garment Grids {{often provide}} characters {{with a variety}} of enhancements and extra abilities. The game features diverse Garment Grids and dresspheres which can be discovered as the game progresses. While normal dresspheres can be used by all three playable characters, each character can acquire a dressphere that only they can use. These dresspheres can only be activated after a character has changed <b>into</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the classes designated to her Garment Grid in a single battle. When a character activates one of these dresspheres, the other characters are replaced by two controllable support units.|$|E
5|$|He {{took this}} {{development}} {{to a new}} level with his 1953 orchestral work Réveil des oiseaux—its material consists almost entirely of the birdsong one might hear between midnight and noon in the Jura. From this period onwards, Messiaen incorporated birdsong <b>into</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> his compositions and composed several works for which birds provide both the title and subject matter (for example the collection of thirteen pieces for piano Catalogue d'oiseaux completed in 1958, and La fauvette des jardins of 1971). Paul Griffiths observed that Messiaen was a more conscientious ornithologist than any previous composer, and a more musical observer of birdsong than any previous ornithologist.|$|E

Learning that Blume is planning to install a satellite network designed to bypass undersea data cables, which would effectively give Blume a monopoly on the entire world's electronic data and stock exchanges, they infiltrate the launch area of one of the satellites to install a backdoor. In order to bring down Blume and Dušan for good, Marcus breaks <b>into</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> Blume's international headquarters and lastly their San Francisco headquarters and hacks their servers, exposing the existence of Bellwether and Dušan's corruption. Dušan is arrested for fraud and Blume is put under investigation, though DedSec resolve to continue their fight against Blume. In an extended ending scene added in a post-release patch, two unidentified individuals note that more DedSec cells and hacktivist groups have been emerging worldwide in response to the San Francisco Blume scandal, and {{that it is time to}} put their own plans into motion.|$|E

25|$|Demographic Model: This model {{suggests}} that Scandinavia experienced a population boom {{just before the}} Viking Age began. The agricultural capabilities of the land were not enough {{to keep up with}} the increasing population. As a result, many Scandinavians found themselves with no property and no status. To remedy this, these landless men took to piracy to obtain material wealth. The population continued to grow, and the pirates looked further and further beyond the borders of the Baltic, and eventually <b>into</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> Europe.|$|E

The most controversial action of the term was Ponder’s appointment of his brother-in-law, former U.S. Senator Willard Saulsbury as Chancellor of Delaware. Saulsbury had left the Senate as a disgraced alcoholic, and promised Ponder he would change his ways if he was appointed. Evidently Saulsbury kept his promise.|$|E

However, many of the mujahideen were {{extremely}} devout Muslims of the strict Salafi sect, which contrasted sharply with the widely renowned secular society and liberal attitude Bosnian Muslims harbored. This led to friction between the mujahideen and the Bosnians. Furthermore, some mujahideen wanted {{to fight a war}} of extermination, or use Bosnian territory as a base for terrorist operations elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|As {{many of the}} {{contemporary}} theological journals published in Germany, Belgium and France make evident, Catholic theologians, rejecting Marxism, socialism, and the excesses of capitalism, debated and formulated social solutions that would come from the combined actions of the Church, the State, the employer and the employee, and elaborated in greater detail the principles {{to be used in}} seeking justice in industrial, social, and economic life. While Sheehan was aware of the social question of his time, and was actively engaged in the great contemporary social evolution directly affecting him in his parish, he can never be regarded as having in any manner espoused the Zeitgeist, as quickly emerges from his portrayal of such a priest in his novel Luke Delmege published in 1901 and, not surprisingly, translated <b>into</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the major European languages.|$|E
25|$|Alex Youngs's {{passion for}} music began {{at a very}} early age and was nurtured by her family. Her Grandmother would {{regularly}} bring her and her brother, to attend concerts at Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center that inspired her to pursue her career. This diverse range of music she was exposed to at an early age profoundly influences her work. Alex Young's artistry combines dancing, singing and acting and is incorporated <b>into</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> her performances. Her love of jazz, bossa nova, and the blues is clear in much of her Pop styling. Young's music is a fusion between pop and dance with some shades of funk, according to her interview with Cosmogirl. During her PBS interview with Emmy Award-winning television news anchor, and Star-Ledger columnist Steve Adubato on OneonOne she stated that when she was young, she used to listen to different styles of music like jazz standards, classical and bossa nova. The artists who have inspired her music are Mariah Carey, Aretha Franklin, Ella Fitzgerald, June London, Frank Sinatra, Prince and Britney Spears.|$|E
