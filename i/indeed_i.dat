They go {{by the name of}} the Waltham Blacks (tho few of them live there) which is a most loyal little town...I once saw two hundred and upwards of these Blacks in a body within half a mile of my house. They had been running brandy. There was 24 customs officers following them who they abused heartily and carried off their cargo. I am told there is no less than a thousand of them and <b>indeed</b> <b>I</b> believe they have now taken loyalty into their heads, and will I hope prove very useful.|$|E

25|$|In {{the best}} book on asthma of the 19th century, first {{published}} in 1860, the British physician and physiologist Henry Hyde Salter (1823–1871) included a chapter on treatment ″by stimulants″. Strong coffee was very helpful, presumably because it dispelled sleep, which favoured asthma. Even more impressive, however, was the response to ″strong mental emotion″: ″The cure of asthma by violent emotion is more sudden and complete than by any other remedy whatever; <b>indeed,</b> <b>I</b> know few things more striking and curious in {{the whole history of}} therapeutics. … The cure … takes no time; it is instantaneous, the intensest paroxysm ceases on the instant.″ ″Cure″ due to release of adrenaline from the adrenals is the retrospective interpretation.|$|E

500|$|Bolstered by 18,000 fresh {{troops from}} the {{divisions}} of Major Generals Buell and Lew Wallace, Grant counterattacked at dawn {{the next day and}} regained the field, forcing the disorganized and demoralized rebels to retreat back to Corinth while thousands deserted. Halleck ordered Grant not to advance more than one day from Pittsburg Landing, stopping the pursuit of the Confederate Army. Although Grant had won the battle the situation was little changed, with the Union in possession of Pittsburg Landing and the Confederates once again holed up in Corinth. Grant, now realizing that the South was determined to fight and that the war would not be won with one battle, would later write, [...] "Then, <b>indeed,</b> <b>I</b> gave up all idea of saving the Union except by complete conquest." ...|$|E

[...] It was first made in a supplementary brief printed after the opening argument of counsel on the other side had been commenced, and not handed in until the second day, just previous to its conclusion.|$|E

Robert Ross knelt by the bedside, assisting me {{as best he could}} while I administered conditional baptism, and afterwards answering the responses while I gave Extreme Unction to the prostrate man and recited the prayers for the dying. As the man was in a semi-comatose condition, I did not venture to administer the Holy Viaticum; still I must add that he could be roused and was roused from this state in my presence. When roused, he gave signs of being inwardly conscious... <b>Indeed</b> <b>I</b> was fully satisfied that he understood me when told that I was about to receive him into the Catholic Church and gave him the Last Sacraments... And when I repeated close to his ear the Holy Names, the Acts of Contrition, Faith, Hope and Charity, with acts of humble resignation to the Will of God, he tried all through to say the words after me.|$|E

500|$|The first {{critical}} review of Very's book {{was written by}} Margaret Fuller and published in Orestes Brownson's Boston Quarterly Review; it said Very's poems had [...] "an elasticity of spirit, a genuine flow of thought, and unsought nobleness and purity", though she admitted she preferred the prose in the collection over the poetry. She mocked the [...] "sing song" [...] style of the poems and questioned his religious mission. She concluded: [...] "I am... greatly interested in Mr Very. He seems worthy to be well known." [...] James Freeman Clarke admired Very's poetry enough to have several published in his journal, the Western Messenger, between 1838 and 1840. William Ellery Channing admired Very's poetry as well, writing that his insanity [...] "is only superficial". Richard Henry Dana Sr. also commented positively on Very's poetry: [...] "The thought is deeply spiritual; and {{while there is a}} certain character of peculiarity which we so often find in like things from our old writers, there is a freedom from quaintness... <b>Indeed,</b> <b>I</b> know not where you would... find any thing in this country to compare with these Sonnets." ...|$|E
500|$|It {{was then}} an annual custom for the Pope {{to receive a}} {{delegation}} from Rome's Jewish community shortly after the New Year. The meeting on 2 February 1859 quickly descended into a heated argument, with Pope Pius berating the Jewish visitors for [...] "stirring up a storm all over Europe about this Mortara case". When the delegation denied that the Jews of Rome had had any hand in the anti-clerical articles, the Pope dismissed Scazzocchio as inexperienced and foolish, then shouted: [...] "The newspapers can write all they want. I couldn't care less what the world thinks!" [...] The Pope then calmed down somewhat: [...] "So strong is the pity I have for you, that I pardon you, <b>indeed,</b> <b>I</b> must pardon you." [...] One of the delegates proposed that the Church should not give so much credence to Morisi's testimony, given her spurious morals—the Pope countered that regardless of her character, so {{far as he could}} see the servant had no reason to invent such a story, and in any case Momolo Mortara should not have employed a Catholic in the first place.|$|E
500|$|In a May 7, 1918 {{letter from}} Tobolsk {{to her sister}} Maria in Yekaterinburg, Anastasia {{described}} a moment of joy despite her sadness and loneliness and worry for the sick Alexei: [...] "We played on the swing, that was when I roared with laughter, the fall was so wonderful! <b>Indeed!</b> <b>I</b> told the sisters about {{it so many times}} yesterday that they got quite fed up, but I could go on telling it masses of times... What weather we've had! One could simply shout with joy." [...] In his memoirs, one of the guards at the Ipatiev House, Alexander Strekotin, remembered Anastasia as [...] "very friendly and full of fun", while another guard said Anastasia was [...] "a very charming devil! She was mischievous and, I think, rarely tired. She was lively, and was fond of performing comic mimes with the dogs, as though they were performing in a circus." [...] Yet another of the guards, however, called the youngest grand duchess [...] "offensive and a terrorist" [...] and complained that her occasionally provocative comments sometimes caused tension in the ranks. Anastasia and her sisters helped their maid darn stockings and assisted the cook in making bread and other kitchen chores while they were in captivity at the Ipatiev House.|$|E

500|$|In Longacre's {{first years}} as chief engraver, no {{original}} designs were required for coins. [...] Gobrecht had redesigned every denomination of U.S. coinage between 1835 and 1842, {{and his successor}} had time to learn arts necessary for coin production {{that he had not}} needed as a maker of print engravings. [...] These arts included coin design, making of punches for design elements, and die sinking. Longacre's work in the private sector had involved cutting lines into a copper plate which was then used to print reproductions. Patterson wrote in August 1845 to Treasury Secretary Robert J. Walker that Longacre [...] "is a gentleman of excellent character, highly regarded in this community, and has acquired some celebrity as an engraver of copper; but he is not a Die-Sinker. [...] <b>Indeed</b> <b>I</b> do not know that he has ever made an attempt in this art." [...] By December of that year, the Mint director had written to Walker in praise of Longacre, stating that the engraver had [...] "more taste and judgment in making devices for an improved coinage here than have been exhibited by any of his predecessors. [...] He has shown too that he is quite competent to make the required model from his drawings." [...] Taxay attributed Patterson's lavish praise of Longacre to continued attempts by Leonard to gain the post of chief engraver.|$|E
500|$|Bond next {{created the}} role of Mad Margaret in Ruddigore (1887; {{originally}} spelt [...] "Ruddygore"), which she regarded as her favourite of all the Gilbert and Sullivan roles, [...] "for it gave me the chance to show what I really could do as an actress." [...] The part was her largest to date, and Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte made her audition it {{for them to be}} sure that she could handle the responsibility. [...] "It was an awful ordeal. [...] I saw the three white faces looming out of the darkness as they sat close together; criticizing me, talking me over, with cold managerial detachment. It nearly killed me. [...] Perhaps it gave an added realism and abandon to my simulated madness, for <b>indeed</b> <b>I</b> was nearly mad with fear – but at any rate I came through triumphantly, they were all three of them delighted." [...] Bond was particularly nervous on opening night. [...] "I shook and tottered so much that Mad Margaret's staff was no mere adjunct, but an absolute necessity. Without it I should have fallen as I stood in the wings waiting to go on. Then some one gave me a push; I was there, on the stage, in the glare of the footlights, hundreds of eyes fixed on me, tier upon tier of dim white faces rising from floor to ceiling in the gloom. It was enough; I forgot myself, I was Mad Margaret and no one else. I made an immense success." [...] Cellier and Bridgeman seconded this assessment: ...|$|E
