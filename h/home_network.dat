40|$|Despite the {{popularity}} of <b>home</b> <b>networks,</b> they face a number of systemic problems: (i) Broadband networks are expensive to deploy; {{and it is not}} clear how the cost can be shared by several service providers; (ii) <b>Home</b> <b>networks</b> are getting harder to manage as we connect more devices, use new applications, and rely on them for entertainment, communication and work—it is common for <b>home</b> <b>networks</b> to be poorly managed, insecure or just plain broken; and (iii) It is not clear how <b>home</b> <b>networks</b> will steadily improve, after they have been deployed, to provide steadily better service to home users. In this paper we propose slicing <b>home</b> <b>networks</b> as a way to overcome these problems. As a mechanism, slicing allows multiple service providers to share a common infrastructure; and supports many policies and business models for cost sharing. We propose four requirements for slicing home networks: bandwidth and traffic isolation between slices, independent control of each slice, and the ability to modify and improve the behavior of a slice. We explore how these requirements allow cost-sharing, out-sourced management of <b>home</b> <b>networks,</b> and the ability to customize a slice to provide higher-quality service. Finally, we describe an initial prototype that we are deploying in homes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} a new user {{authentication}} (UA) {{scheme based on}} one-time password (OTP) protocol using smart cards for <b>home</b> <b>networks.</b> The proposed scheme is to authenticate home users who uses home devices. Several techniques using technology based on biometrics, passwords, certificates, and smart cards {{can be used for}} user authentication in the similar environments. However, such user authentication techniques must be examined before being employed in an environment where home devices have low efficiency and performance. Here, we present the important security functions of <b>home</b> <b>networks.</b> The proposed authentication protocol is designed to accept the existing <b>home</b> <b>networks</b> based on the one-time password protocol. Also, it is a well suited solution and is quite satisfactory in terms of the security requirements of <b>home</b> <b>networks,</b> because of requiring low computation by performing simple operations using one-way hash functions. Our proposed scheme can protect against illegal access for home services and devices and does not allow unnecessary service access by legitimate users. Therefore, it allows the user to provide real-time privilege control and good implementation in secure <b>home</b> <b>networks.</b> I...|$|R

The emphasis is on the use of mobile devices. We describe the challenges facing both the manufacturers and consumers in creating and using such <b>home</b> <b>networks.</b> Since the users of these systems are non-expert consumers, we argue that the most important challenge is creating easy-to-use, selfconfiguring and self-healing <b>home</b> <b>networks.</b> Finally, we present a de-centralized architecture and an overview of technologies {{that can be used to}} enable local and remote access to <b>home</b> <b>networks</b> using mobile devices.

40|$|<b>Home</b> <b>{{networks}}</b> {{differ from}} most other networks {{since they are}} usually administrated by inexperienced users. Today, protocols such as Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) support zero-configuration networking and are used for data-sharing and entertainment. However, security mechanisms are neglected and are not integrated into current UPnP devices. This becomes even more of an issue {{when we think of}} future interconnected <b>home</b> <b>networks</b> where many users and devices will interact. A possible successor of UPnP, the Devices Profile for Web Services (DPWS), is built upon the standard Web-Services(WS) stack and thus also provides WS-Security. However, the configuration of fine-grained access rights for DPWS actions (e. g. for browsing through a media collection) is not defined. This paper describes how to use DPWS and the security framework XACML as a basis for a secure service infrastructure for future <b>home</b> <b>networks.</b> Templates for policies can be auto-generated and a trust model based on X. 509 certificates is used for identifying devices and for the interconnection of multiple <b>home</b> <b>networks...</b>|$|R

Big Picture mode is a 10-foot user interface, which optimizes the Steam display to work on high-definition televisions, allowing the user to control Steam with a gamepad or with a keyboard and mouse. Newell stated that Big Picture mode was a step towards a dedicated Steam entertainment hardware unit. SteamVR, a virtual reality (VR) Big Picture interface, was introduced in beta in January 2014. The SteamVR mode enables the user to operate the Big Picture mode and play any game in their Steam library with a virtual theater displayed through the VR headset, the equivalent of looking at a 225-inch television screen, according to Valve. The mode was first introduced in beta for the Oculus Rift headset and later expanded in March 2015 to support the HTC Vive, a VR unit developed jointly with Valve, with the feature to be publicly released shortly after the Vive's public launch in April 2016. In-Home Streaming was introduced in May 2014; this allows users to stream games installed on one computer to anotherregardless of platformon the same <b>home</b> <b>network.</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Home</b> <b>networks</b> are {{becoming}} dynamic and technologically heterogeneous. They consist of {{an increasing number}} of devices which offer several functionalities and can be used for many different services. In the home, these devices are interconnected using a mixture of networking technologies (for example, CAT- 5, wireless, coaxial cable, or power-line). However, interconnecting these devices is often not easy. The increasing heterogeneity has led to significant device- and service-management complexity. In addition, <b>home</b> <b>networks</b> provide a critical "last meters" access to the public telecom and Internet infrastructure and have a dramatic impact on to the end-to-end reliability and performance of services from these networks. This challenges service providers not only to maintain a satisfactory quality of service level in such heterogeneous <b>home</b> <b>networks,</b> but also to remotely monitor and troubleshoot them. The present thesis work contributes research and several solutions in the field of network and service monitoring in <b>home</b> <b>networks,</b> mainly in three areas: (1) providing automatic device- and service-discovery and configuration, (2) remote management, and (3) providing quality of service (QoS). etc...|$|R
