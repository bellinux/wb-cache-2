With the help of other college professors, the committee creates a large pool of possible questions that is pre-tested with college students taking statistics courses. The test is then refined to an appropriate level of <b>difficulty</b> <b>and</b> clarity. Afterwards, the Educational Testing Service is responsible for printing and administering the exam.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} asset are the Storm's narrow dimensions, {{which allow}} it to traverse the narrow alleyways common to the casbahs of many Middle Eastern cities, places that armoured Humvees can only enter with great <b>difficulty</b> <b>and</b> minimal manoeuvrability, if at all. Full-height rear doors which allow for the quick deployment of fully equipped troops into combat are touted as another advantage over similar vehicles.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{production}} <b>difficulty</b> <b>and</b> high price, lutetium has very few commercial uses, especially {{since it is}} rarer {{than most of the}} other lanthanides but is chemically not very different. However, stable lutetium can be used as catalysts in petroleum cracking in refineries and can also be used in alkylation, hydrogenation, and polymerization applications.|$|E

5|$|Critical {{reception}} to Devil May Cry 4 was positive, with praise aimed towards its challenging <b>difficulty</b> <b>and</b> the characters' special moves. However, it {{was also}} criticized for its backtracking and a troublesome camera. The game sold over 3 million units worldwide, becoming the series' best-selling title. It has also been adapted into a two-volume light novel by its original writer, Bingo Morihashi.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine is the Westernized {{version of}} Puyo Puyo and replaces its {{characters}} {{with those from}} the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise, being primarily based on the Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog animated series. The gameplay is reminiscent of Tetris, in which the player must organise different coloured shapes as they fall down a board. The game received mostly positive reviews, with critics praising the gameplay, while criticising the <b>difficulty</b> <b>and</b> overuse of the falling block puzzle genre.|$|E
5|$|However, by November 1900 the South Lancashire Electric Traction and Power Company had {{acquired}} the shares.

5|$|In {{countries}} of the former Soviet Union and other eastern European countries, a team {{has in the past}} been chosen several years beforehand, and they are given special training specifically for the event. However, such methods have been discontinued in some countries. In Ukraine, for instance, selection tests consist of four olympiads comparable to the IMO by <b>difficulty</b> <b>and</b> schedule.

5|$|Issho ni A-SO-BO also {{contained}} several serious errors. Petit Ferret addressed {{these issues in}} two patches. The first patch added missing voice data from the original game CD; customers were given the option of downloading the patch or exchanging for a new CD. Ferret released the second patch on July 7, 2003; it corrected grammatical errors, adjusted the game's <b>difficulty,</b> <b>and</b> enhanced stability. The second patch did not contain the first's fixes.|$|E

5|$|Its game {{engine was}} carried over from a failed {{attempt at a}} flight {{simulator}} and was inspired by Matchbox toys and Choplifter. Jungle Strike retained its predecessor's core mechanics and expanded on the model with additional vehicles and settings. The game was well received by most critics upon release, with the Mega Drive release receiving critical acclaim from their respective reviewers. Publications praised its gameplay, strategy, design, controls and graphics, although there were some complaints regarding the interface, <b>difficulty</b> <b>and</b> perceived jingoistic politics.|$|E
5|$|Like a free-to-play game, it {{continued}} to receive updates years after its release. A free post-launch update in June 2016 added a zombies mode—Death Valley Challenge Mode—wherein the player defends a human against encroaching zombies as he attempts to repair his car. The addition has three levels of <b>difficulty</b> <b>and</b> additional weapon upgrades and player achievements. Later that year, Square Enix Montreal added a Halloween theme and a limited-edition crossbow weapon with special abilities such as making a target's ghost into the player's ally.|$|E
5|$|MediEvil 2 {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics upon release. The game was mostly praised for its rich, detailed graphics but was criticised by many reviewers for its bad camera angles, easy <b>difficulty</b> <b>and</b> {{for being too}} similar to the first game. The game received an aggregate score of 79% from GameRankings, slightly lower than its predecessor. At the 2000 BAFTA Interactive Entertainment Awards, MediEvil 2 won the best console game category.|$|E

5|$|Ratchet & Clank: Going Commando was {{released}} roughly {{a year after}} the original game and received critical acclaim, to the point of frequently being viewed {{as one of the best}} PlayStation 2 games ever made. Most critics felt that the game was superior to its predecessor, and praised the game's graphics, gameplay, story, characterization and sound, but criticized its unforgiving <b>difficulty</b> <b>and</b> minigames.|$|E
5|$|Super Smash Bros. has {{received}} praise for its multiplayer mode. Nintendo Power listed the series as {{being one of}} the greatest multiplayer experiences in Nintendo history, describing it as infinitely replayable due to its special moves and close-quarters combat. There were criticisms, however, such as the game's scoring being difficult to follow. In addition, the single-player mode was criticized for its perceived <b>difficulty</b> <b>and</b> lack of features.|$|E
5|$|The Komnenian era {{was born}} out of a period of great <b>difficulty</b> <b>and</b> strife for the Byzantine Empire. Following a period of {{relative}} success and expansion under the Macedonian dynasty (c. 867–c. 1054), Byzantium experienced several decades of stagnation and decline, which culminated in a vast deterioration in the military, territorial, economic and political situation of the Byzantine Empire by the accession of Alexios I Komnenos in 1081.|$|E

5|$|The first area {{of major}} dispute was the manner {{by which the}} lower house would be apportioned. A {{minority}} {{wanted it to be}} apportioned so that all states would have equal weight, though this was never seriously considered. Most wanted it apportioned in accordance with some mixture of property and population. Though there was discussion on how to calculate property for this purpose, the issue of property was later dropped because of its <b>difficulty,</b> <b>and</b> an assumption that property would closely correlate to population.|$|E
5|$|A PC Engine port of Ninja Ryūkenden was {{produced}} in 1992, published by Hudson Soft and released only in Japan; it features more colorful and detailed graphics, along with <b>difficulty</b> <b>and</b> gameplay tweaks and a different soundtrack. This version also supports three different language settings with Japanese, English and Chinese as the available options. However, the English translation used in this version differs from the one used in the earlier NES version. To switch between the three settings, the player must press the Select + I + II buttons simultaneously at the title screen, which will change the text under the logo to the appropriate characters.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} attribute in {{this dog}} was a tempered aggressiveness {{that would provide}} the necessary drive to pursue and bolt the fox, without resulting in physical harm to the quarry and effectively ending the chase, which was considered unsporting. Russell {{was said to have}} prided himself that his terriers never tasted blood. This line of terriers developed by John Russell was well respected for those qualities, and his dogs were often taken on by hunt enthusiasts. It is unlikely, however, that any dogs alive today can be proven to be descendants from Trump, as Russell was forced to sell all his dogs {{on more than one occasion}} because of financial <b>difficulty,</b> <b>and</b> had only four aged (and non-breeding) terriers left when he died in 1883.|$|E
