5|$|In 755, he {{received}} an appointment as Registrar of the Right Commandant's office of the Crown Prince's Palace. Although this was a minor post, in normal times {{it would have been}} at least the start of an official career. <b>Even</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> had begun work, however, the position was swept away by events.|$|E
5|$|Because of Barkley's role in {{crafting}} the Railway Labor Act, the Associated Railway Labor Organizations endorsed him {{to unseat}} Ernst <b>even</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> formally announced his candidacy on April 26, 1926. Since the 1923 gubernatorial contest, he had {{distanced himself from}} Haly and promised the conservatives {{that he would not}} push a ban on parimutuel betting if elected. Consequently, he had no opposition in the primary. Congressman (and later Chief Justice) Fred M. Vinson managed his general election campaign.|$|E
5|$|Prinz zur Lippe-Weißenfeld in {{his younger}} years was very {{enthusiastic}} about the mountains and wildlife. From his fourteenth year he participated in hunting. At {{the same time he}} was also very much interested in music and sports and discovered his love for flying at the Gaisberg near Salzburg. Here he attended the glider flying school of the Austrian Aëro Club. He attended a basic flying course with the second air regiment in Graz and Wiener Neustadt <b>even</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> joined the military service.|$|E

5|$|Benedict Arnold next wrote {{a series}} of letters to Clinton, <b>even</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> might have {{expected}} {{a response to the}} July 7 letter. In a July 11 letter, he complained that the British did not appear to trust him, and threatened to break off negotiations unless progress was made. On July 12, he wrote again, making explicit the offer to surrender West Point, although his price rose to £20,000 (in addition to indemnification for his losses), with a £1,000 down payment to be delivered with the response. These letters were delivered by Samuel Wallis, another Philadelphia businessman who spied for the British, rather than by Stansbury.|$|E
5|$|However, a major rift {{of opinion}} {{existed between the}} Japanese {{government}} and its two field armies, the SEA and 10th Army, which as of November were both nominally {{under the control of}} the Central China Area Army led by SEA commander Matsui. Matsui made clear to his superiors <b>even</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> left for Shanghai that he wanted to march on Nanking. He was convinced that the conquest of the Chinese capital city of Nanking would provoke the fall of the entire Nationalist Government of China and thus hand Japan a quick and complete victory in its war on China. Yanagawa was likewise eager to conquer Nanking and both men chafed under the operation restriction line that had been imposed on them by the Army General Staff.|$|E
5|$|Johnson's mother {{apprentice}}d her son William to a tailor, James Selby. Andrew {{also became}} an apprentice in Selby's shop at age ten and was legally bound to serve until his 21st birthday. Johnson {{lived with his}} mother for part of his service, and one of Selby's employees taught him rudimentary literacy skills. His education was augmented by citizens who would come to Selby's shop to read to the tailors as they worked. <b>Even</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> became an apprentice, Johnson came to listen. The readings caused a lifelong love of learning, and one of his biographers, Annette Gordon-Reed, suggests that Johnson, later a gifted public speaker, learned the art as he threaded needles and cut cloth.|$|E

5|$|Moonraker was {{intended}} by its creator Ian Fleming {{to become a}} film <b>even</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> completed the novel in 1954, since he based it on a screenplay manuscript he had written even earlier. The film's producers had originally intended to film For Your Eyes Only, but instead chose this title due {{to the rise of}} the science fiction genre {{in the wake of the}} Star Wars phenomenon. Budgetary issues caused the film to be primarily shot in France, with locations also in Italy, Brazil, Guatemala and the United States. The soundstages of Pinewood Studios in England, traditionally used for the series, were only used by the special effects team.|$|E
5|$|Although {{dismissive of}} Young's work <b>even</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> had read it, Champollion {{obtained}} {{a copy of}} the Encyclopedia article. Even though he was suffering from a failing health, and the chicanery of the Ultras kept him struggling to maintain his job, it motivated him to return in earnest {{to the study of the}} hieroglyphs. When he was eventually removed from his professorship by the Royalist faction, he finally had the time to work on it exclusively. While he awaited trial for treason, he produced a short manuscript, De l'écriture hiératique des anciens Égyptiens, in which he argued that the hieratic script was simply a modified form of hieroglyphic writing. Young had already anonymously published an argument to the same effect several years earlier in an obscure journal, but Champollion, having been cut off from academia, had probably not read it. In addition Champollion made the fatal error of claiming that the hieratic script was entirely ideographic. Champollion himself was never proud of this work and reportedly actively tried to suppress it by buying the copies and destroying them.|$|E
5|$|However, Matsui {{had made}} it clear to his {{superiors}} <b>even</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> had left Japan in August that he was determined to capture the capital city of China, Nanking, which lay 300 kilometers west of Shanghai. Matsui forcefully asserted that the war with China would not end until Nanking was in their control, and he envisaged that the fall of Nanking would result in the total collapse of Chiang Kai-shek's government. After Chiang's fall Matsui hoped {{to play a role in}} forming a new government in China which, according to his own conception, would be a democracy that would better serve the interests of both Japan and the people of China. However, the historian Tokushi Kasahara also sees personal motives behind Matsui's insistence on capturing Nanking. Kasahara suspects that Matsui, as an aging general with a relatively undistinguished military record, desperately wanted to crown his career with one last battlefield victory like the capture of the Chinese capital.|$|E
6000|$|... "You will be {{back before}} I go, won't you, Dick?" [...] Annie said, as she sat by his side on {{a seat in the}} garden, on the <b>evening</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> was to start.|$|R

5|$|In 1960 Solti {{signed a}} three-year {{contract}} to be {{music director of the}} Los Angeles Philharmonic from 1962. <b>Even</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> took the post the Philharmonic's autocratic president, Dorothy Chandler, breached his contract by appointing a deputy music director without Solti's approval. Although he admired the chosen deputy, Zubin Mehta, Solti felt he could not have his authority undermined from the outset, and he withdrew from his appointment. He accepted an offer to become musical director of Covent Garden Opera Company, London. When first sounded out about the post he had declined it. After 14 years of experience at Munich and Frankfurt he was uncertain that he wanted a third successive operatic post. Moreover, founded only 15 years earlier, the Covent Garden company was not yet the equal of the best opera houses in Europe. Bruno Walter convinced Solti that it was his duty to take Covent Garden on.|$|E
5|$|Sam Houston was an {{attorney}} by profession and politically accomplished <b>even</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> moved to Texas. In Tennessee, {{he had been}} both {{a member of the}} United States House of Representatives and Governor. His military victory at the Battle of San Jacinto elevated him to hero status in Texas. After completing his first term as President of the Republic of Texas in early December 1838, he continued to practice law from his office in Liberty. He arrived in Mobile, Alabama, in the early months of 1839 as a partner of the Sabine City Company, seeking investors to develop a community that is today known as Sabine Pass. Through Martin Lea, he made the acquaintance of Antoinette's husband William Bledsoe, a wealthy businessman who in turn suggested Nancy Lea as a possible investor. Invited to a garden party at Martin's home, it was there Houston first became acquainted with Margaret. The mutual attraction was instantaneous.|$|E
5|$|Stories for {{the show}} were often co-written by Burns, who also became a {{producer}} in the show's fourth season. Other writers include three acclaimed crime fiction writers from outside of Baltimore: George Pelecanos from Washington, Richard Price from the Bronx and Dennis Lehane from Boston. Reviewers drew comparisons between Price's works (particularly Clockers) and The Wire <b>even</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> joined. In addition to writing, Pelecanos served as a producer for the third season. Pelecanos has commented that he was attracted to the project because {{of the opportunity to}} work with Simon. Staff writer Rafael Alvarez penned several episodes' scripts, as well as the series guidebook The Wire: Truth Be Told. Alvarez is a colleague of Simon's from The Baltimore Sun and a Baltimore native with working experience in the port area. Another city native and independent filmmaker, Joy Lusco, also wrote {{for the show}} in each of its first three seasons. Baltimore Sun writer and political journalist William F. Zorzi joined the writing staff in the third season and brought a wealth of experience to the show's examination of Baltimore politics.|$|E

60|$|Upon the {{following}} morning {{one of the men}} left to watch the wells also returned. He had come through without stopping, and reported that late in the <b>evening</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> left he and his companions had seen a line of camels with some horsemen coming towards the wells. He had waited until morning in order to discover their force; he put it down as forty men.|$|R
5|$|Lancashire {{appointed}} MacLaren {{as coach}} for the 1922 season, to popular acclaim; he also captained the Lancashire second team. <b>Even</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> began work, his poor financial situation forced him to request two advances on his salary. As a coach, MacLaren was autocratic and demanding, but encouraged the players to think for themselves. He was unpopular with some players and clashed frequently with the Lancashire committee. During the winter of 1922–23, the MCC organised two cricket tours—a Test playing tour to South Africa and a tour to Australia and New Zealand intended to give experience to young, promising cricketers. MacLaren was chosen to captain the latter team {{on account of his}} experience and his success with young cricketers during his win over the Australians in 1921. He was given a good reception by the crowds when he played and press reports praised his tactical awareness. The team was undefeated in matches in New Zealand. Against the full New Zealand team, MacLaren scored 200 not out in 264 minutes in his final first-class innings; the effort placed a strain on his knee and he was unable to play again on the tour. He ended his first-class career with 22,236 runs at an average of 34.15.|$|E

60|$|It was Jake Shaggam, who had {{received}} the message the <b>evening</b> <b>before.</b> <b>He</b> had read it with interest and started out at daylight to find out something about the Rovers and where they might be located. Good fortune had thrown him directly in our young friends' way.|$|R

50|$|In {{his later}} years, Richmond became close friends with Cribb. The two men often conversed {{late into the}} night at Cribb's pub, the Union Arms on Panton Street in Westminster. It was here that Richmond spent his last <b>evening,</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> died at aged 66 in December 1829.|$|R
25|$|Even {{during his}} Ohio years, Anton Hesing was {{politically}} active, participating {{as a member}} of the Hamilton County Committee of the Whig Party <b>even</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> was old enough to vote. In 1852 he was made a member of the Ohio State Executive Committee of the Whig Party.|$|E
25|$|Carías {{had made}} {{efforts to improve}} the {{military}} <b>even</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> became president. Once in office, both his capacity and his motivation to continue and to expand such improvements increased. He gave special attention to the fledgling air force, founding the Military Aviation School in 1934 and arranging for a United States colonel to serve as its commandant.|$|E
25|$|During {{the rest}} of his life after {{retiring}} from racing Fangio sold Mercedes-Benz cars, often driving his former racing cars in demonstration laps. <b>Even</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> joined the Mercedes Formula One team, in the mid-1950s, Fangio had acquired the Argentine Mercedes concession. He was appointed President of Mercedes-Benz Argentina in 1974, and its Honorary President for Life in 1987.|$|E

60|$|Though he did {{not show}} it outwardly, there was strife and trouble within him. The name of Zack was often on his lips, and he varied {{constantly}} in his rate of walking; now quickening, now slackening his pace at irregular intervals.
