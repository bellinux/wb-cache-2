25|$|Kritiks: The {{negative}} {{can claim}} that the affirmative is guilty of a certain mindset or assumption that should be <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> <b>rejection</b> or a different mutually exclusive alternative to the Affirmatives plan. Kritiks are sometimes a reason to reject the entire affirmative advocacy without evaluating its policy; other times, kritiks can be evaluated within the same framework for evaluation as the affirmative case. Examples of some areas of literature for kritiks include biopower, racism, centralized government, and anthropocentrism. Kritiks arose in the early 1990s, with the first kritiks based in deconstructionist philosophy about the intrinsic ambiguity of language and were championed by debaters Shane Stafford and Bill Shanahan. Kritiks today have evolved to sometimes include the affirmative advocacy within their alternatives. These kritiks argue that the ontological or epistemological assumptions behind the affirmative are flawed {{and ought to be}} rejected, but the plan itself is fine. For example, an affirmative could argue that {{it would be good to}} reduce our nuclear stockpile to avoid global proliferation out of fear of rogue states acquiring nuclear weapons. The negative could respond with an aff-inclusive kritik that argues that it would be good to reduce our nuclear stockpile because nuclear weapons are unethical, but that we ought not conceptualize other states as fundamentally dangerous.|$|E

40|$|To avoid a vast {{rejection}} of {{evolution in the}} Muslim world, scientists can present the theory as the bedrock of biology and can stress its practical applications. Early in 2007, biologists and anthropologists at universities across the United States received an unsolicited gift of an 850 -page, colored Atlas of Creation, produced by a Muslim creationist, Adnan Oktar, {{who goes by the}} pen name of Harun Yahya (Science, 16 February 2007, p. 925). The atlas was a timely notice that, although the last couple of decades have seen an increasing confrontation over the teaching of evolution in the United States, the next major battle over evolution is likely to take place in the Muslim world (i. e., predominantly Islamic countries, as well as in countries where there are large Muslim populations). Relatively poor education standards, in combination with frequent misinformation about evolutionary ideas, make the Muslim world a fertile <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> <b>rejection</b> of the theory. In addition, there already exists a growing and highly influential Islamic creationist movement (1). Biological evolution is still a relatively new concept for a majority of Muslims, and a serious debate over its religious compatibility has not yet taken place. It is likely that public opinion on this issue will be shaped in the next decade or so because of rising education levels in the Muslim world and the increasing importance of biological sciences. Views of Evolution from Scholars Just as there is no monolithic Islam, there is no “official ” opinion on evolution. There are indeed verses in the Koran that talk about the creation of the universe and of the living beings on Earth, but specific details are often not laid out. For example, the Koranic narrative of creation includes a 6 -day account of creation. The length of each day, however, is not clearly specified. One day has been defined as “a thousand years of what you count ” (32 : 5) or as “a day the measure of which is fifty thousand years ” (70 : 4). The resulting ambiguity leaves open the possibility of a very old Earth. Indeed, young-Earth creationism is wholly absent in the Muslim world, and a universe billions of years old i...|$|R

50|$|At eighteen, Elizabeth {{already had}} a strong piety instilled in her, and the city life and suitors were unsatisfying to her liking.

She found it difficult to choose between devoting herself to being a wife and mother or to God and she found that she could not engage in both to the fullest potential. Therefore, chose to pursue the religious life and reject marriage. Elizabeth Isham’s choice of to never marry, resulted from both the hardships faced from her failed relationships and difficult decisions made of her devotion to God and to remain single. She would have had all the benefits of marriage, of becoming a widow, and becoming a mother and heir to the estates if she had married her father’s choice of suitors. However, none of that mattered to her.

How far <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> the <b>rejection</b> of Kant’s metaphysical system are provided by the incompatibility of this system with the most important field of man’s experience, is not here discussed. It must however be emphasised that far from Kant’s moral theory being dependent on the existence or reality of certain metaphysical entities, as some have argued - for example, G. E. Moore in “Principia Ethica” - Kant’s very attempt to establish the reality of his metaphysical world on moral grounds is one which can only be held a failure.

40|$|An {{influential}} {{interpretation of}} phenomenology construes Husserl's project {{as an attempt}} to generalize the Fregean notion of sense- an attempt to extend Frege's analysis of the structure of meaningful expressions to a more general account of the structure of meaning in experience. Michael Dummett has articulated a broadly Fregean critique of this Husserlian program, arguing that the project is misguided and retrograde-a relapse into the psychologism and idealism that Frege sought to avoid. A defense of Husserl is offered, based in part on key elements of the theory of meaning articulated in his Logical Investigations. But the main aim is neither to acquit nor to convict Husserl of Dummett's charges; rather it is to use the exchange to investigate some of the philosophical commitments of a broadly Husserlian phenomenology. If we are to understand how Husserl avoids psychologism then we must {{come to terms with the}} paradoxical idea of an anti-psychologistic investigation of consciousness (an anti-psychologistic psychology). If we are to understand his complex stance toward idealism then we must not only understand the <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> his <b>rejection</b> of subjective idealism but also be attuned to the other forms of idealism to which his project is committed. In the course of investigating these matters the author considers how Husserl can reply to the charge of explanatory vacuity, and shows that Frege himself recognizes the legitimacy of something like the Husserlian project. © 1999 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC...|$|R

This concerns a situation in which, by way of functional interpretation, judges amend the statutory norm that determines the manner in which certain goods are distributed.

This, in consequence, may lead to a suspicion that the court that has decided in a given matter followed an opinion o f a certain social or political group. In the author’s opinion, in matters concerning the distribution of goods that could not be politically resolved on the parliamentary forum, or in cases where parliamentary inaction might put the citizens’ welfare at risk, a change in the statutory norms of the distribution of goods performed by the court by rejection of a clear result o f linguistic interpretation, in a situation o f a dispute regarding the assumptions of the axiological rationality of the legislator is acceptable, and the described behaviour does not infringe the basic ethical obligation of a judge to make a sovereign decision...|$|R
40|$|I show Means/end or "instrumental" {{models of}} {{practical}} rationality maintain that an agent is rational {{if she is}} taking efficient means to secure her most important ends. According to this view, an agent's goals are not themselves open to rational assessment. Only the efficiency of means to chosen ends is evaluated. These accounts raise an important question in contemporary debates about practical rationality: whether a complete theory of practical rationality must include a theory of value (a theory by which ends are evaluated {{to determine whether they}} are rational). After placing various means/end accounts in historical perspective and illustrating their contemporary significance, I defend a negative answer to the above question and thus embrace a form of instrumentalism. I show that certain arguments concerning the rationality of final ends are reducible to arguments about other matters pertaining to things being constituents of ends or means to final ends. Moreover, examples of irrational desires designed to show that means/end conceptions are inadequate simply appeal to our intuitions and many will not share those intuitions in all cases. The intuitive appeal of instrumental theories will be bolstered if it is emphasized that they do not permit the pursuit of every fleeting desire, but rather those which the agent herself deems most important.

Before going to Parliament again, the Board of Northern Lights, desiring to obtain support and corroboration for Mr. Stevenson’s views, consulted first Telford, who was unable to give the matter his attention, and then (on Stevenson’s suggestion) Rennie, who concurred in affirming the practicability of a stone tower, and supported the Bill when it came again before Parliament in 1806. Rennie was afterwards appointed by the Commissioners as advising engineer, whom Stevenson might consult in cases of emergency. It seems certain that the title of chief engineer had in this instance no more meaning than the above. Rennie, in point of fact, proposed certain modifications in Stevenson’s plans, which the latter did not accept; nevertheless Rennie continued to take a kindly interest in the work, and the two engineers remained in friendly correspondence during its progress. The official view taken by the Board as to the quarter in which lay both the merit and {{the responsibility of the}} work may be gathered from a minute of the Commissioners at their first meeting held after Stevenson died; in which they record their regret ‘at the death of this zealous, faithful, and able officer, to whom is due the honour of conceiving and executing the Bell Rock Lighthouse.’ The matter is briefly summed up in the Life of Robert Stevenson by his son David Stevenson (A. & C.

Figure 4 (a) displays {{an example of a}} sample that exhibits non-linear and zigzag patterns of data points on the Arai plot with a high σ/ǀbǀ (= 0.492) and CKerror (= 8.1 %) at relatively low temperature steps (200 – 540 °C). This result is probably caused by a difference in the capacity for acquiring TRMs between the IZ and ZI procedures (Yu et al., 2004; Yu and Tauxe, 2005). Figure 4 (b) provides an example of unstable rema-nence direction (MAD = 22 ° and DANG = 18.4 °) with a failed pTRM check (CKerror = 11.2 %) at the high temperature interval of 450 – 585 °C, despite a linear trend (σ/ǀbǀ = 0.054). On the vector diagram (inset in Fig. 4 (b)) in particular, the remanence exhibits unstable demagnetizing behavior from 550 °C to 585 °C with a high angular deviation (MAD = 16.7 °). Consequently, experimental results showing this behavior are rejected, though data points at the high temperature interval (450 – 585 °C) are sufficiently linear to determine an acceptable paleointensity value. Figure 4 (c) shows the importance of the pTRM checks; if there were no checks during the paleointensity experiments, there would be no other <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> <b>rejection.</b> In the temperature steps above 500 °C, the pTRMs increase gradually (i.e., CKerror(540 °C) = 6.7 % and CKerror(570 °C) = 12.5 %, Fig. 4 (c)). Finally, Fig. 4 (d) is an example of samples showing a short linear trend of data points on the Arai plot (f = 0.39) at a low temperature interval (200 – 500 °C). Although a linear segment exists at the low temperature interval (grey dashed line), the remanence with a low unblocking temperature is likely to be contaminated by viscous remanent magnetization. In addition, the remanence direction is unstable above 500 °C (inset of Fig. 4 (d)) and accompanied by failed pTRM checks (CKerror = 9.5 %).|$|E

The most popular approximated method is the Sample Matrix Inversion (SMI) method which consists in inverting the covariance matrix estimated by an average of the sample matrix over the secondary range cells. This estimator is unbiased in case of i. i. d. data. In a NSL configuration, the clutter power spectrum is range dependent and the data are consequently not i. i. d [...] We here present a solution to mitigate this range dependency of the data : the range recursive subspace-based algorithms. They are used in two architectures: a fully and a partially adaptive ones. Then a new range recursive algorithm using Taylor series expansion is investigated. The performance of these algorithms are compared with that of the conventional STAP algorithms in term of SINR loss...|$|R
