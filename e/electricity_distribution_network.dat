In 1996 Welsh Water's holding company was renamed as Hyder plc and the group acquired South Wales Electricity plc. After Hyder's share price collapsed in 1999 and 2000, the Hyder Group was sold to WPD on terms recommended by the Hyder Board after a competitive and hostile takeover battle.

40|$|With a large {{penetration}} of low carbon technologies (LCTs) at medium voltage and low voltage levels, <b>electricity</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>networks</b> are undergoing rapid changes. Much {{research has been}} carried out to analyse the impact of employing LCTs in <b>distribution</b> <b>networks</b> based on either real or synthetic network samples. Results of such studies are usually case specific and of limited applicability to other networks. Topological properties of a <b>distribution</b> <b>networks</b> describe how different network components are located and connected, which are critical for the investigation of network performance. However, the number of network modelling and simulation platforms are limited in the open literature which can provide random realistic representations of <b>electricity</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>networks.</b> Thus, it is difficult to arrive to generalized and robust conclusions on impact studies of LCTs. As the initial step to bridge this gap, this paper studies the topological properties of real-world <b>electricity</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>networks</b> at the medium voltage level by employing the techniques from complex networks analysis and graph theory. The networks have been modelled as graphs with nodes representing electrical components of the network and links standing for the connections between the nodes through distribution lines. The key topological properties that characterize different types (urban and sub-urban) of <b>distribution</b> <b>networks</b> have been identified and quantified. A novel approach to obtain depth-dependent topological properties has also been developed. Results show that the node degree and edge length related graph properties are a key to characterize different types of <b>electricity</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>networks</b> and depth dependent network properties are able to better characterize the topological properties of urban and sub-urban networks...|$|R

Two essays use US data to demonstrate that incentive-based regulation has valuable application within a management setting and can lead to gaming behaviour within a regulatory setting. One essay discusses the lessons that can be drawn from the failed first <b>electricity</b> <b>distribution</b> price control review in the Netherlands. One essay presents the views of 75 international regulation managers and gives recommedations on ways to improve the regulatory quality and process. The final essay analyses the economic consequences of the forced ownership unbundling of the <b>electricity</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>networks</b> in 1998 in New Zealand, and draws lessons for future structural remedies that may be sought in other countries. ...|$|R
