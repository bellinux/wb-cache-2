5|$|During a raid {{against a}} group of surface elves, Drizzt finds himself unable to {{participate}} in the slaughter with his fellow drow. He pretends to kill an elf child, but actually helps her to escape. When the deception is discovered, Zaknafein is sacrificed in Drizzt's stead to appease Lloth, the drow's goddess. Following a war against another House, Drizzt curses his family and the evil drow ways and escapes Menzoberranzan into the Underdark. At this time he also acquires the statuette that allows him to summon the magical panther Guenhwyvar. Guenhwyvar travels by Drizzt's side as he makes <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Realms.|$|E
5|$|The {{family moved}} to Erfurt in Germany when Brand was four. Brand {{attended}} school until 1923 {{and said he had}} completed his Abitur. When he was 19 he went to stay with an uncle in New York, then worked <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> United States, washing dishes and working on roads and in mines. He joined the Communist Party, worked for the Comintern as a sailor, and sailed to Hawaii, the Philippines, South America, China, and Japan. In or around 1930 he returned to Erfurt, where his father had founded another telephone company. Brand took a job with the company and became a functionary with the Thuringian KPD (Communist Party of Germany).|$|E
5|$|From there, Crash {{crosses to}} the second of Cortex's islands. Wumpa Island, hosting a large tree, has been long {{abandoned}} {{and there is nothing}} more than a jungle, a lizard-infested city, dilapidated bridges high in the mountains, and the ruins of an ancient temple. However, having discovered that Crash is making <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> islands, Cortex dispatches the deranged Ripper Roo on the island in a temple at the start of a creek. Crash manages to cross the river and, after avoiding contact with his razor-sharp toenails, knocks Ripper Roo out cold beside a waterfall, and successfully makes his way through the city and the temples. Crash also defeats another of Cortex's mutants, the muscular Koala Kong, in a volcanic cave mine before finally crossing to the Cortex Island. Crash then navigates the Cortex Power station, a huge power plant that provides Cortex's castle with energy while polluting the nearby area. When he reaches the factory core, Crash battles and defeats the CEO of Cortex Power, Pinstripe Potoroo, damaging the power plant.|$|E

60|$|He was Mulligan Jacobs; and {{he picked}} <b>his</b> <b>way</b> back <b>across</b> <b>the</b> wreck of the bridge where the fore-topgallant-yard still lay, and {{came up to me}} unafraid, as implacable and bitter as ever.|$|R

25|$|Ney {{has been}} praised for his {{remarkable}} {{handling of the}} rearguard. For the loss of 229 men he had held Wellington up for an entire day, giving Masséna the time he needed to force <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Mondego River. Wellington himself believed the entire French army was upon him, and was disappointed to discover that it was merely a rear-guard.|$|E
25|$|One {{newcomer}} to the city was Davis Hanson Waite, a native of Jamestown, New York, who had, on <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> country, served in the Wisconsin and Kansas state legislatures. He bought the house and settled in, starting the Aspen Weekly Times, a newspaper still published today. He remained involved in politics, and in 1892 was elected Governor of Colorado.|$|E
60|$|He {{thought it}} quite natural {{that she should}} dismiss him with a curt and condescending nod, and when she had swept majestically out of the room, he made <b>his</b> <b>way</b> humbly <b>across</b> <b>the</b> hall, then by the garden door out towards the tumble-down barn where he had {{tethered}} his old mare.|$|R
500|$|... {{the loss}} of a {{distinguished}} researcher, teacher, leader and mentor." [...] In a short obituary of Moser as part of their report on the Eighth International Symposium on Arctic-Alpine Mycology, mycologists Cathy Cripps and Joe Ammirati called him a [...] "gentlemanly scholar" [...] who [...] "led us in <b>his</b> quiet <b>way</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> tundra and down many dichotomous paths".|$|R
60|$|At such a time, when {{moon and}} stars threw a faint and mysterious {{light over the}} {{sleeping}} woods, and not a sound, save the cry of a restless bird, broke the silence, a young countryman made <b>his</b> <b>way</b> rapidly <b>across</b> <b>the</b> horse-shoe meadow to the bend of the stream under Red Scar.|$|R
25|$|By then, his {{stepmother}} had died, and {{his father}} moved to Tulsa, Oklahoma {{to go back to}} the oil business. Gable toured in stock companies, as well as working the oil fields and as a horse manager. He found work with several second-class theater companies, thus making <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Midwest to Seaside, Oregon, working as a logger, and to Portland, Oregon, where he worked as a necktie salesman in the Meier & Frank department store. In Portland, he met Laura Hope Crews, a stage and film actress, who encouraged him to return to the stage with another theater company. Twenty years later, Crews played Aunt Pittypat alongside Gable's Rhett Butler in Gone With the Wind (1939).|$|E
2500|$|On February 15, 2012, Nik Wallenda {{received}} {{official approval}} from Ontario's Niagara Parks Commission (NPC) {{to walk a}} tightrope across Niagara Falls, a dream he had had {{since he was a}} child. The plan called for crossing the Niagara River and its [...] deep gorge from the American side at Goat Island or at the smaller Luna Island, and making <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> river to land at the Canadian side near the site of Table Rock. The American Falls and Bridal Veil Falls would be behind him and to his right, while the Canadian Falls would be on his immediate left and behind.|$|E
2500|$|On 29 April 1945 Dachau was {{surrendered}} to Brig. Gen. Henning Linden of the 42nd Infantry Division of the U.S. Army by Untersturmführer Wicker. According to Linden, {{he arrived at}} the command post in Dachau at about 15:00 and proceeded to make <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Amper River {{to the site of the}} complex approximately one-half kilometer south of the bridge he crossed. He proceeded to take control of the camp in some tumult; thereafter, he toured the camp with a group of reporters (including Marguerite Higgins). A description of the surrender appears in Gen. Henning Linden's memorandum to Maj. Gen. Harry J. Collins, entitled [...] "Report on Surrender of Dachau Concentration Camp": ...|$|E
60|$|He {{went down}} on all-fours, and in this {{attitude}} wormed <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>across</b> to <b>the</b> opposite roof, whose occupants, engrossed in the fight in the street, in which the police had now joined, had their backs turned and did not observe him. Mr. Gooch, pallid and obviously ill-attuned to such feats, followed him; and finally Billy Windsor reached the other side.|$|R
6000|$|... "What was that?" [...] {{asked the}} capitaine in a hoarse voice. He made <b>his</b> <b>way</b> half <b>across</b> <b>the</b> little garden, {{and he also}} was within forty or fifty yards of the flat rock. But Adolphe was unable to answer him. He had fainted and the lamp had fallen from his hands and rolled {{to the bottom of}} the steps.|$|R
50|$|In December 1975 the Referee's Committee of the Scottish Football Association {{ordered the}} closure of Christie Park for two months {{following}} an incident in which a referee was knocked to the ground by a supporter making <b>his</b> <b>way</b> home <b>across</b> <b>the</b> pitch after a match. The club were also fined £100 and ordered to have Police on duty at all future matches.|$|R
2500|$|Wallenda's chosen path {{took him}} [...] across the widest {{part of the}} falls. He slowly inched <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> {{slippery}} wire, praying and praising Jesus Christ as he went. As he took his first steps over the water, walking on a downward slope, he told reporters, [...] "It's a beautiful view... A dream in the making." [...] Later he described the first step over the falls as {{the toughest part of}} his journey. [...] "Mentally, your mind goes, 'What are you doing?'" [...] he recalled. [...] When he reached the midpoint, he was roughly [...] lower than where he started due to the sag of the wire. [...] The second half of the walk brought him uphill, back to the same elevation at which he began.|$|E
2500|$|Roosevelt {{was totally}} and {{permanently}} {{paralyzed from the}} waist down, and unable to stand or walk without support. [...] For the next few months, he confined himself to indoor pursuits, including resuming his lifelong hobby of stamp collecting. [...] In December 1921, after he had recuperated for several months, a physiotherapist began working with him {{to determine the extent}} of the damage. He was able to perform small exercises on his own, moving one muscle and then another. He was fitted with heavy steel braces that locked at the knee and provided enough stability that he could stand with crutches. In 1922, at Springwood, he worked diligently to make <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> room. He set himself the goal of getting down the long driveway, managing to do it once, but never trying again.|$|E
2500|$|The year 1622 brought much disarray in {{the colonial}} and {{religious}} administration of the island. At the same period, in the nearby island of Bohol, a babaylan [...] named Tamblot rebelled against Jesuit hamletting. This revolt would spread to Leyte and influenced Bancao, who welcomed Legazpi to the Philippines in 1565, baptized {{at the same time}} and settled in the town of Carigara. Bancao had been having trouble with Muslim onslaughts in his territory, in particular, in Limasawa. He had witnessed the massacre and bloodshed brought about by the raids of the Moros on his land and kinsmen. When the Moros gave out a condition that they would stop the plundering if the Christian natives would abandon the Church, Bancao grasped what it meant and returned to his old pagan religion. The datu then consigned to halt the conversion process undergone by the Jesuits to the Leyteños. With Pagali, his high priest, Bancao solicited the assistance of other chieftains of the neighboring settlements of Baibai, Panaon, and Sogod and easily won <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> island to the very capital in the north which was Carigara. The rebels, as they were divided all over the settlements that revolted, were not equal, however, to the force of fifty (50) Spaniards and one thousand (1,000) Cebuanos that Don Juan de Alcarazo, the alcalde mayor [...] of Cebu, quickly mustered to suppress the rebellion. After refusing to surrender, Bancao and his followers died valiantly in their defense of Calanaga, situated equidistant from Limasawa, Panaon and Sogod [...] The head of Bancao, as ordered by the Spaniards, was publicly exposed on a pike in the town plaza of Carigara.|$|E
60|$|Then {{he tried}} to find <b>his</b> <b>way</b> {{straight}} <b>across</b> <b>the</b> garden, but he {{became more and more}} puzzled. Presently he came to a pond where Mr. McGregor filled his water-cans. A white cat was staring at some gold-fish; she sat very, very still, but now and then the tip of her tail twitched as if it were alive. Peter thought it best to go away without speaking to her.|$|R
60|$|He {{could not}} say {{anything}} more just then, for customers were departing, {{and she had to}} attend to them; he did not try to approach her while she was thus engaged, but presently, when her back was turned, he contrived to work <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>across</b> to <b>the</b> door which gave on the inner room, and to push it slightly open with his hand, until he could peep through the aperture and take a quick survey of the room beyond.|$|R
6000|$|The reporter, when he {{examined}} {{the contents of the}} bag under a lamp in the Cathedral vestibule, could hardly believe his good fortune. The careful Bishop's notes were so full and clear that for all practical purposes they were equal to a report. His work was already done. He felt so pleased with himself that he determined to treat himself to another [...] "two" [...] of gin, and, with this intent, made <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>across</b> to <b>the</b> little [...] "public" [...] before-mentioned.|$|R
2500|$|A local petty {{criminal}} and repeated sex offender is initially {{thought to be}} the culprit, but it is revealed that the dangerous cult-like religious movement Santa Muerte, popular within Mexican criminal circles, might be involved. Jack's former life as a Santa Muerte worshiping hit man for the Mexican mafia is revealed as he tries desperately to find out who kidnapped his daughter. [...] We later learn that Jack was really named Roberto. [...] Though born in Oklahoma, his drug addicted mother took him to Mexico when she was young. [...] She later died, and Roberto had to make a life for himself on the streets. [...] He ultimately became an enforcer for the Mexican mafia. [...] He married a woman named Katie, and they had a child, Toby. [...] Jack escapes from the FBI in Texas and makes <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> border to Acuna. [...] There he is accused of murdering a prostitute who was trying to help him find Toby. [...] Though he did not do it, the Mexican police arrest him. [...] Jack is later able to escape from the Mexican jail in disguise. [...] Still in Acuna, he makes his presence known. [...] As he planned, he lured the assassin who was looking for him to come to his hotel. [...] They fight and Jack beats the assassin, who he then tortures for information about Toby's whereabouts. [...] The assassin tells Jack that Toby was kidnapped by Katie, Jack's/Roberto's ex-wife. [...] Jack breaks into the brothel that Katie now runs in Acuna and confronts Katie, who is herself furious that Jack/Roberto ran out on her without warning and took Toby with him. [...] Jack thinks Katie is lying when she says she does not know where Toby is, and murders her.|$|E

60|$|Taurus Antinor emerged alone {{from the}} peristyle of Caius Nepos' house. An army of slaves {{belonging}} to the various guests were hanging about the vestibule, talking and laughing amongst themselves and feasting on the debris from the patricians' table, brought out to them by servitors from within; some forty litters encumbered the floor, but Antinor, paying no heed to these, passed through the crowd of jabbering {{men and women and}} made <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>across</b> to <b>the</b> steps which led upwards to the street.|$|R
50|$|J. M. W. Turner, {{the celebrated}} painter, arrived at High Force at 10:00 a.m. on 3 August 1816 to sketch the scene. He then {{travelled}} upstream to Cauldron Snout and eventually made <b>his</b> <b>way</b> to Dufton, <b>across</b> <b>the</b> fells, in inclement weather.|$|R
