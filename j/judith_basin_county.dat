500|$|Yogo sapphires are {{a variety}} of {{corundum}} found only in Yogo Gulch, part of the Little Belt Mountains in <b>Judith</b> <b>Basin</b> <b>County,</b> Montana, United States, on land once inhabited by the Piegan Blackfeet people. Yogos are typically cornflower blue, a result of trace amounts of iron and titanium. They have high uniform clarity and maintain their brilliance under artificial light. Because Yogo sapphires occur within a vertically dipping resistive igneous dike, mining efforts have been sporadic and rarely profitable. It is estimated that at least 28million carats (...) of Yogos are still in the ground. Jewelry containing Yogos was given to First Ladies Florence Harding and Bess Truman; in addition, many gems were sold in Europe, though promoters' claims that Yogos are in the crown jewels of England or the engagement ring of Princess Diana are dubious. [...] Today, several Yogo sapphires are part of the Smithsonian Institution's gem collection.|$|E
500|$|Yogo Gulch and the {{corresponding}} natural features of Yogo Peak (...) , Yogo Creek, and the Yogo dike, where the gems are mined, {{are all in the}} Little Belt Mountains within <b>Judith</b> <b>Basin</b> <b>County.</b> The Gulch is located along the lower reaches of Yogo Creek and west of the Judith River. [...] The west end of the Yogo dike outcrops just southwest of Yogo Creek, about [...] north of Yogo Creek's confluence with the Middle Fork of the Judith River; from there it runs east-northeast and ends about [...] from the Judith River. Yogo Creek starts just south of Yogo Peak, which is about [...] west of the Judith River. From there the creek flows southeast into the Middle Fork of the Judith River. The Judith River then flows northeast from the Little Belts toward Utica. East of the Judith River is Pig-Eye Basin, where Jake Hoover, credited as the person who discovered Yogo sapphires, owned a ranch.|$|E

5000|$|Its NRHP {{nomination}} describes its importance:...this important {{historic property}} symbolizes {{the transformation of}} the <b>Judith</b> <b>Basin</b> from open-range prairie lands to farm and ranch lands. The experience of local pioneers, Clarence and Parmelia Goodell, further adds to understanding the settlement and agricultural development of the Basin. Their acquisition of a preemption and a tree claim in 1880 patterns the general trend of homesteaders in the Basin, for a majority of the settlers obtained land from the federal government in this way. Mr. and Mrs. Goodell began to farm and ranch this area {{as one of the first}} homesteading families in the <b>Judith</b> <b>Basin.</b> In addition, Wood Lawn Farm is important ... for its architecture. Reflecting a transition away from the primitive log cabin architecture which characterized much residential building on the central Montana ranching frontier, the Goodells built a modern, Queen Anne/Colonial Revival style wood frame house by the beginning of 1890, reflecting a genuine confidence in the <b>Judith</b> <b>Basin</b> and its sustaining capacity. For its associations with local builder Richmond Jellison, the property gains significance. Jellison was responsible for the construction of several vernacular buildings in Philbrook and the outlying rural district, and his sense of design informed the character of this early community.|$|R

Because he was mechanically handy, he found work repairing broken farm equipment. While in his early 20s, he built his first airplane in the lobby of the hotel his mother managed, but was unable to fly it because he had no suitable engine. Around this same time, he married his wife Meta.|$|R
5000|$|Beginning in 1888, Russell spent {{a period}} {{living with the}} Blood Indians, {{a branch of the}} Blackfeet nation. [...] It is {{believed}} that much of his intimate knowledge of Native American culture came from this period. [...] Upon returning to white culture in 1889, he found the <b>Judith</b> <b>Basin</b> filling up with settlers, so he worked in more open places {{for a couple of years}} before settling in the area of Great Falls, Montana, in 1892, in an attempt to make a living as a full-time artist.|$|R

5000|$|Ubet (also written U-Bet or U-bet) was a stage stop {{settlement}} in Fergus County, Montana (but {{what is now}} <b>Judith</b> <b>Basin</b> <b>County,</b> Montana), United States. It is approximately 3 mi west of Garneill, Montana which was reputedly the best-known stagecoach station in the Montana Territory.|$|E
5000|$|Ubet {{was founded}} in 1880 on the Ft. Benton-Billings stagecoach route by lumberman (and former Wisconsin State Assembly Speaker of the House) A. R. Barrows (who with his family {{was among the first}} {{permanent}} white settlers of the <b>Judith</b> <b>Basin).</b> The name supposedly came from Barrows' response to a challenge for a name for the settlement's proposed post office: [...] "You bet!" [...] At one time, it included not only a two-story log hotel, but a stagecoach barn, post office, icehouse, saloon, blacksmith shop, and a stable.|$|R
5000|$|Russell came to Montana in 1880 {{at the age}} of 16. After an {{unsuccessful}} stint working on a sheep ranch, he found work with a hunter and trapper turned rancher named Jake Hoover, who owned a ranch in the <b>Judith</b> <b>Basin,</b> and from whom Russell learned much about the ways of the west. The two men remained lifelong friends. [...] After a brief visit to his family in 1882, he returned to Montana, where he remained {{for the rest of his}} life. He worked as a cowboy for a number of outfits, and documented the harsh winter of 1886-1887 in a number of watercolors. Russell was working on the O-H Ranch in the <b>Judith</b> <b>Basin</b> of Central Montana at the time, when the ranch foreman received a letter from the owner, asking how the cattle herd had weathered the winter. Instead of a letter, the ranch foreman sent a postcard-sized watercolor Russell had painted of gaunt steer being watched by wolves under a gray winter sky. The ranch owner showed the postcard to friends and business acquaintances and eventually displayed it in a shop window in Helena, Montana. After this, work began to come steadily to the artist. Russell's caption on the sketch, Waiting for a Chinook, became the title of the drawing, and Russell later created a more detailed version which is one of his best-known works.|$|R
