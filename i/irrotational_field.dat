I. INTRODUCTION In recent {{years there has been}} a growing interest in tomographic reconstruction of vector fields [1, 2, 3, 4]. The primary driving force has been the realization that certain applications such as ultrasonic imaging [5], flow imaging [6, 7], and ocean acoustic tomography [8, 9] have measurements that are inherently line integrals of the inner product of the vector field with a fixed unit vector. Norton [2] laid the groundwork for a theoretical treatment of this problem by showing that through a decomposition of the vector field into its irrotational and solenoidal components, conventional line integral projections [...] - i. e., where the integral of the [...] ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this method}} the {{inviscid}} flow field is decomposed into two parts: a known field with constant vorticity representing the upstream shear and an unknown <b>irrotational</b> <b>field</b> representing the disturbance flow {{caused by the}} airfoil. The unknown field is handled by mapping the airfoil into a near-circular shape with a known normal velocity distribution. The flow around this shape is solved {{by means of a}} complex potential made of a vortex, a doublet and a number of quadruplets. The solution is then transformed back to the airfoil plane where it is added to the known upstream flow field. The method is general and is not limited to a particular airfoil geometry as in previous work. Results of numerous test cases indicate that the method is both accurate and numerically efficient over a wide range of angles of attack and shear rates. Comparison is also made with the limited experimental data available. King Saud Universit...|$|E

40|$|In this work, I {{present the}} form of the Navier–Stokes {{equations}} implied by the Helmholtz decomposition in which the relation of the irrotational and rotational velocity fields is made explicit. The idea of self-equilibration of irrotational viscous stresses is introduced. The decomposition is constructed by first selecting the irrotational flow compatible with the flow boundaries and other prescribed conditions. The rotational component of velocity is then the difference between the solution of the Navier–Stokes equations and the selected irrotational flow. To satisfy the boundary conditions, the <b>irrotational</b> <b>field</b> is required, and it depends on the viscosity. Five unknown fields are determined by the decomposed form of the Navier–Stokes equations for an incompressible fluid: the rotational component of velocity, the pressure, and the harmonic potential. These five fields may be readily identified in analytic solutions available in the literature. It is clear from these exact solutions that potential flow of a viscous fluid is required to satisfy prescribed conditions, like the no-slip condition at the boundary of a solid or continuity conditions across a two-fluid boundary. It can be said that equations governing the Helmholtz decomposition describe the modification of irrotational flow due to vorticity, but the analysis shows the two fields are coupled and cannot be completely determined independently...|$|E

The first-order method that is presented fully {{accounts for the}} distortion effects of the nonuniform mean flow on the convected upstream vortical disturbances. The unsteady velocity is split into a vortical component which is a known function of the upstream flow conditions and the Lagrangian coordinates of the mean flow, and an <b>irrotational</b> <b>field</b> whose potential satisfies a nonconstant-coefficient, inhomogeneous, convective wave equation. Using an elliptic coordinate transformation, the unsteady boundary value problem is solved in the frequency domain on grids which are determined {{as a function of}} the Mach number and reduced frequency. The numerical scheme is validated through extensive comparisons with known solutions to unsteady vortical flow problems. In general, it is seen that the agreement between the numerical and analytical results is very good for reduced frequencies ranging from 0 to 4, and for Mach numbers ranging from. 1 to. 8. Numerical results are also presented for a wide variety of flow configurations for the purpose of determining the effects of airfoil thickness, angle of attack, camber, and Mach number on the unsteady lift and moment of airfoils subjected to periodic vortical gusts. It is seen that each of these parameters can have a significant effect on the unsteady airfoil response to the incident disturbances, and that the effect depends strongly upon the reduced frequency and the dimensionality of the gust. For a one-dimensional (transverse) or two-dimensional (transverse and longitudinal) gust, the results indicate that airfoil thickness increases the unsteady lift and moment at the low reduced frequencies but decreases it at the high reduced frequencies. The results show that an increase in airfoil Mach number leads to a significant increase in the unsteady lift and moment for the low reduced frequencies, but a significant decrease for the high reduced frequencies...|$|E

A conformal mapping is used to match the computational domain to an experimentally derived shape of vortex ripples formed in a large-scale oscillatory water tunnel. While the instantaneous velocity field and time-averaged velocity field agrees reasonably well with published experimental data, the time- and ripple-averaged velocity profile differs substantially. As well, the suspended sediment concentration above the ripple crest is substantially different than that observed experimentally. These effects, likely the result of insufficient resolved turbulent intensity in the LES, result in poor predictions of suspended sediment transport rates. ...|$|E
