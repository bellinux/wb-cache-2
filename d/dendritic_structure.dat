5|$|The {{first real}} {{progress}} toward a modern understanding of nervous function, though, came from the investigations of Luigi Galvani, who discovered that a shock of static electricity applied to an exposed nerve of a dead frog could cause its leg to contract. Since that time, each major advance in understanding has followed more or less directly from {{the development of a}} new technique of investigation. Until the early years of the 20th century, the most important advances were derived from new methods for staining cells. Particularly critical was the invention of the Golgi stain, which (when correctly used) stains only a small fraction of neurons, but stains them in their entirety, including cell body, dendrites, and axon. Without such a stain, brain tissue under a microscope appears as an impenetrable tangle of protoplasmic fibers, in which it is impossible to determine any structure. In the hands of Camillo Golgi, and especially of the Spanish neuroanatomist Santiago Ram√≥n y Cajal, the new stain revealed hundreds of distinct types of neurons, each with its own unique <b>dendritic</b> <b>structure</b> and pattern of connectivity.|$|E

40|$|A {{dendrite}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} esthetically pleasing structures, with the best-known example being snowflakes. Although the formation of dendrites has been studied for centuries, the way to control their growth is limited. Here we report an attempt to manipulate the growth of <b>dendritic</b> <b>structures</b> via controlling chemical diffusion and reaction. The silver <b>dendritic</b> <b>structures</b> are synthesized by reducing silver ions in solution. The diffusion of chemical agents is regulated by changing the viscosity of the solution while the reaction is regulated by adding acids. The decrease of reaction rate leads to the disappearance of side branch of dendrites while the reduction of diffusion rate shortens the main trunk of dendrites. The silver dendrites are finely tuned by chemical diffusion and reaction. Following studies suggest that diffusion and reaction determines the chemical concentration around the growth fronts, which influences the growth of crystal structures, leading to the formation of diverse silver <b>dendritic</b> <b>structures.</b> The findings in this study indicate that chemical diffusion and reaction are two effective tools to regulate <b>dendritic</b> <b>structures,</b> promising a different way to promote or prevent the growth of <b>dendritic</b> <b>structures</b> in industries.

50|$|Arc is an immediate-early gene {{involved}} in the regulation of <b>dendritic</b> <b>structure.</b> It is regulated by both BDNF and CREB signaling. For example, administration of BDNF increases Arc levels and promotes dendritic spine expansion. Acute ethanol exposure in rats increases Arc levels and DSD in the CeA and MeA. In juxtaposition, chronic ethanol exposure tends to decrease DSD. Withdrawal also decreases DSD as well as decreasing Arc expression, BDNF signaling, and CREB activation. Downregulation of Arc in the CeA using antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) causes a decrease in Arc and consequently DSD accompanied by increased anxiety and ethanol consumption.Furthermore, P rats exhibit lower baseline DSD in the CeA and MeA.|$|E

In addition to gross size differences, both neurochemical and structural differences have been found between the hemispheres.

5000|$|This {{layer is}} also known as the substantia gelatinosa of Rolando and has the highest density of neurons. [...] These neurons mediate the {{activity}} of nociceptive and temperature afferent fibers. [...] It is almost entirely made up of interneurons which can be further divided by their morphology. The four main morphological classes, based on the shape of their <b>dendritic</b> <b>structure,</b> are islet, central, vertical, and radial cells. The interneurons can also be divided by their function: excitatory or inhibitory. The excitatory interneurons release glutamate as their main neurotransmitter and the inhibitory interneurons use GABA and/or glycine as their main neurotransmitter.

Other characteristics that distinguished the new species from others include the presence of base skeletal structures devoid of living tissue, a fairly smooth coenosteum, a distinct line of spines between the corallites, and the absence of secondary septa in the closely spaced corallites.

Rall's equivalent cylinder is seen to be {{one part of the}} equivalent cable in the special case of dendrites satisfying the Rall criteria. The relation between the branched dendrite and its equivalent unbranched representation is uniquely defined by an invertible mapping that connects configurations of inputs on the branched structure with those on the unbranched structure, and conversely.

50|$|ON/OFF DS {{ganglion}} {{cells can}} be divided into 4 subtypes differing in their directional preference, ventral, dorsal, nasal, or temporal. The cells of different subtypes also differ in their <b>dendritic</b> <b>structure</b> and synaptic targets in the brain. The neurons that were identified to prefer ventral motion were also found to have dendritic projections in the ventral direction. Also, the neurons that prefer nasal motion had asymmetric dendritic extensions in the nasal direction. Thus, a strong association between the structural and functional asymmetry in ventral and nasal direction was observed. With a distinct property and preference for each subtype, there was an expectation that they could be selectively labeled by molecular markers. The neurons that were preferentially responsive to vertical motion were indeed shown to be selectively expressed by a specific molecular marker. However, molecular markers for other three subtypes have not been yet found.|$|E
50|$|Dendrites {{themselves}} {{appear to}} be capable of plastic changes during the adult life of animals, including invertebrates. Neuronal dendrites have various compartments known as functional units that are able to compute incoming stimuli. These functional units are involved in processing input and are composed of the subdomains of dendrites such as spines, branches, or groupings of branches. Therefore, plasticity that leads to changes in the dendrite structure will affect communication and processing in the cell. During development dendrite morphology is shaped by intrinsic programs within the cell's genome and extrinsic factors such as signals from other cells. But in adult life, extrinsic signals become more influential and cause more significant changes in dendrite structure compared to intrinsic signals during development. In females, the <b>dendritic</b> <b>structure</b> can change as a result of physiological conditions induced by hormones during periods such as pregnancy, lactation, and following the estrous cycle. This is particularly visible in pyramidal cells of the CA1 region of the hippocampus, where the density of dendrites can vary up to 30%.|$|E

We found that expression of dominant-negative Rac 1 results in a progressive elimination of dendritic spines, whereas hyperactivation of RhoA causes a drastic simplification of dendritic branch patterns that is dependent on the activity of a downstream kinase ROCK. Our results suggest that Rac and Rho play distinct functions in regulating dendritic spines and branches and are vital for the maintenance and reorganization of <b>dendritic</b> <b>structures</b> in maturing neurons...|$|R
5000|$|LIRM {{anomalies}} {{can often}} be problematic when examining the magnetic characteristics of rock types. LIRM anomalies can disguise the natural remanent magnetization (NRM) of the rocks in question because the subsequent magnetization caused by the lightning strike reconfigures the magnetic record. [...] While investigating the soil attributes at the 30-30 Winchester archeological site in northeastern Wyoming to discern the daily activities of prehistoric people that had once occupied that region, David Maki noticed peculiar anomalies in the magnetic record that did not match the circular magnetic remnant features of the ovens used by these prehistoric groups for cooking and pottery. [...] The LIRM anomaly was significantly bigger than the other magnetic anomalies and formed a <b>dendritic</b> <b>structure.</b> [...] To test {{the validity of the}} assertion that the magnetic anomaly was indeed the result of lightning and not another process, Maki (2005) tested the soil samples against known standards indicative of LIRM anomalies developed by Dunlop et al. (1984), Wasilewski and Kletetschka (1999), and Verrier and Rochette (2002). [...] These standards include, but are not limited to: 1) Average REM (ratio between natural remanent magnetization to a laboratory standard value) greater than 0.2, and 2) Average Koenigsberger ratio (ratio between natural remanent magnetization and the natural field created by Earth's magnetic field). [...] The findings indicated the evidence of LIRM at the archaeological site. LIRM anomalies also complicated the determination of the relative location of the poles during the late Cretaceous from the magnetic field record of basaltic lava flows in Mongolia. [...] The presence of LIRM-affected rocks was determined when calculated Koenigsberger ratios were drastically higher than other magnetic signatures in the region.|$|E

40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} {{finite element}} model for simulation of dendritic solidification of binary alloys is developed. The model solves the coupled time-dependent temperature and solute concentration equations on two independent meshes: a fixed mesh for the temperature and an adaptive interface-conforming mesh for the concentration. The temperature is solved on the whole domain while the concentration is solved only on the liquid region because diffusion in the solid is much smaller than that in the liquid and can be neglected. Temperature and concentration are coupled at the interface through the generalized Gibbs-Thompson relation. The solid-liquid interface is explicitly tracked {{with a set of}} marker points that defines its position at all times. Latent heat of fusion, interfacial energy, kinetic mobility and crystalline anisotropy are taken into account. The adaptive mesh is generated at every time step as the interface position changes. The model is easy to use {{in the sense that it}} works with physical variables as opposed to those based on the phase-field variable and level-set method. The model is very accurate as demonstrated by a series of calculations that compare to exact solutions or predictions by solidification theories. In simulations of solidification of pure materials, where only the energy equation is solved, the model produces very complicated <b>dendritic</b> <b>structures</b> that are in close agreement with experimental observations, and the computation is very efficient. Calculations under a variety of conditions show that the undercooling and surface tension are the main factors that determine the final <b>dendritic</b> <b>structures.</b> In simulations of alloy solidification, where both the energy and solutal concentration equations are solved, the results for the onset of interface instability and the prediction of the most unstable wavelength are in good agreement with linear stability theory. When applied to simulations of directional solidification of Pb-Sb alloys, the model generates <b>dendritic</b> <b>structures</b> and solute segregation similar to those observed experimentally, and the interface-development from a planar form to cells to <b>dendritic</b> <b>structures</b> is clearly demonstrated.
