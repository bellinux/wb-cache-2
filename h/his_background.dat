5|$|In his poetry, Chivers {{made use}} of legends and themes from Native American culture, {{particularly}} the Cherokee, though often with Christian overtones. He was also heavily influenced {{by the work of}} François-René de Chateaubriand and Emanuel Swedenborg. Many of Chivers's poems included themes of death and sorrow, often using images of shrouds, coffins, angels, and reunions with lost loves in the afterlife. Religious conventions at the time made discussion of death popular, as was reflected in poetry. Because of <b>his</b> <b>background</b> as a doctor, Chivers was able to graphically depict the last moments before someone's death.|$|E

5|$|The glyphs {{are divided}} into three categories: in{{dependent}}, compound, and dependent (glyphs that only appear in combination with others). He sees other groupings as being arbitrary, as well as detrimental to the proper understanding of rongorongo. Contrary to other scholars who do not place importance on compound glyphs, Dietrich sees compounding as a major aspect of the system. In fact, Dietrich describes rongorongo as a network in which the characters are interwoven together through various combinations. He speculates that it was <b>his</b> <b>background</b> in graphic design {{that allowed him to}} perceive this pattern, while other researchers relied too heavily on linguistics and epigraphy.|$|E

Larkin created different music depending on the location, giving each setting and Age a distinctive tone. For End of Ages, Larkin was unable to afford a full orchestra to perform his score, so he combined individual instrumentation {{with an array of}} synthesizers.|$|E
