25|$|Based on the concept, for the {{majority}} Rouvas represents the dark and erotic side of the video, while Tamta the light and innocence. The video begins {{with the image of}} a man in shadows spinning on a chair and holding his head with his hand. It then forwards to a scene with Tamta, wearing leopard print lingerie, looking in a mirror and getting dressed, continuously alternating between these two scenes, while lights flash constantly. As the first verse begins, the shadowy figure is revealed to be Rouvas, with sweat dripping heavily <b>down</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> and an unidentified female hand touching him. A new scene is added with Tamta {{standing in front of a}} white background with the wind blowing, wearing various loose, flowy costumes, one of which is a Laskaris Haute Couture creation. The scenes constantly alternate between a single frame to a grid. Throughout the video Tamta wears five different costumes. It was also the first music video where Tamta can be seen with her new look.|$|E

Though the Young Republicans continued their applause as the Nixon party left the theatre, the candidate fixed on an Irish Setter running alongside his car as it pulled away from the curb. [...] "Well, we made a hit in the dog world anyway." [...] Despite the senator's despair, his wife was convinced that her husband had vindicated himself. Over sixty million Americans had watched or listened to the speech, including the largest television audience up to that point.|$|E

He was also festooned [...] "like a Christmas tree" [...] with souvenired German binoculars and pistols. Full of nervous tension, he chattered to his mates about how he had [...] "put the wind up" [...] the Germans. During the Battle of Mont Saint-Quentin, the 43rd Battalion suffered 67 casualties. In the next week, the 11th Brigade was part of the pursuit of the Germans to the main Hindenburg Line. On 10 September, Weathers was promoted to temporary corporal. On 29 September, the 3rd Division was part of the Battle of St Quentin Canal, and the 43rd Battalion was sheltering in a trench when a shell burst among a small group of men, wounding Weathers in the head. He died soon after, without knowing he would receive the Victoria Cross, which was gazetted on 24 December 1918. The same shell killed his uncle, Lance Corporal J. J. Weathers. Lawrence Weathers was buried at the Commonwealth War Graves Commission Unicorn Cemetery, Vendhuile. He was survived by his wife and sons. , his Victoria Cross was {{in the hands of a}} private collector.|$|E
500|$|John Pomfret of The Washington Post said a wide {{spectrum}} of Chinese and foreigners believed that Liu's award [...] "could actually resonate more deeply within China than any similar act in years". The open letter by Xu Youyu et al, which described Liu as [...] "a splendid choice" [...] because of his advancement of human rights causes and the peaceful fight against social injustice, amassed signatures from about 200 mainland intellectuals and activists; it was posted in Chinese, English, French and Japanese on websites hosted outside China. Artist and critic Ai Weiwei said that, although the regime ought to feel the most ashamed, [...] "intellectuals who had drifted away from their public responsibilities" [...] should bear some of that burden for betraying values they once strove for. Ai said that the Prize was a message from the international community to the Chinese government to respect universal human values, notwithstanding China's economic performance. Writer Liao Yiwu, a close friend of Liu, described it as [...] "a big moment in Chinese history". Another writer, Yu Jie, said he spent the night awake with tears streaming <b>down</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> – [...] "Twenty years ago Liu Xiaobo said that China needed someone with moral clarity about what China needs. Now he has become just that person, that he himself was looking for", he said. Former Chinese diplomat Yang Hengjun described it as a strong signal to the Chinese government to speed up political reform [...] "or you will have a lot of enemies around you and within you." ...|$|E
500|$|Through late 1967 {{and early}} 1968, Barrett's {{behaviour}} became increasingly erratic and unpredictable, {{partly as a}} consequence of his reported heavy use of psychedelic drugs, most prominently LSD. There is also much speculation that he suffered from schizophrenia. Once described as joyful, friendly, and extroverted, he became increasingly depressed and socially withdrawn, and experienced hallucinations, disorganized speech, memory lapses, intense mood swings, and periods of catatonia. Although the changes began gradually, he went missing for a long weekend and, according to several friends including Rick Wright, came back [...] "a completely different person." [...] One of the striking features of his change was the development of a blank, empty, dead-eyed stare. He was unable to recognize old friends that he had known for years, and often did not know where he was. At one point, while {{on a tour of the}} city of Los Angeles, Barrett is said to have exclaimed, [...] "Gee, it sure is nice to be in Las Vegas!" [...] Many reports described him on stage, strumming one chord through the entire concert, or not playing at all. At a show at The Fillmore in San Francisco, during a performance of [...] "Interstellar Overdrive", Barrett slowly detuned his guitar. The audience seemed to enjoy such antics, unaware of the rest of the band's consternation. Interviewed on Pat Boone's show during this tour, Syd's reply to Boone's questions was a [...] "blank and totally mute stare," [...] according to Nick Mason, [...] "Syd wasn't into moving his lips that day." [...] Barrett exhibited similar behaviour during the band's first appearance on Dick Clark's popular TV show American Bandstand. Although surviving footage of this appearance shows Barrett miming his parts of the song competently, during a group interview afterwards, when asked two questions by Clark, Barrett's answers were terse, almost to the point of rudeness (though, Clark noted, they had been flying non-stop from London to Los Angeles). During this time, Barrett would often forget to bring his guitar to sessions, damage equipment and occasionally was unable to hold his pick. Before a performance in late 1967, Barrett reportedly crushed Mandrax tranquilliser tablets and an entire tube of Brylcreem into his hair, which subsequently melted <b>down</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> under the heat of the stage lighting, making him look like [...] "a guttered candle". Nick Mason later disputed the Mandrax portion of this story, stating that [...] "Syd would never waste good mandies".|$|E

2500|$|Throughout {{the events}} leading to the Anschluß and even after the Nazis marched into Austria on 12 March 1938, Heydrich - {{convinced}} that only his SD could pull off a peaceful union between the two German-speaking nations - organized demonstrations, conducted clandestine operations, ordered [...] terror attacks, distributed propaganda materials, encouraged the intimidation of opponents, and had his SS and SD personnel round-up prominent anti-Nazis, most of whom ended up in Mauthausen concentration camp The coordinated efforts of the SiPo and Heydrich's SD during {{the first days of}} the Anschluß effectively eliminated all forms of possible political, military and economic resistance within Austria. [...] Once the annexation became official, the Austrian police was immediately subordinated to Heydrich's SD, the SS and Gestapo. Machinations by the SD, the Gestapo, and the SS helped to bring Austria fully into Hitler's grasp and on 13 March 1938, he signed into law the union with Austria as tears streamed <b>down</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Throughout {{negotiations}} for the Anschluss with Austria, Papen (with knowledge that both Catholic Rome and Mussolini were {{uneasy about the}} affair) urged Hitler to proceed cautiously {{so as not to}} disturb their relationship with the Italians. Though Papen was dismissed from his mission in Austria on 4 February 1938, Hitler drafted him to arrange a meeting between the German dictator and Austrian Chancellor Kurt von Schuschnigg at Berchtesgaden. [...] On 5 February, Hitler told Papen {{he was going to be}} reassigned elsewhere but ordered him back to Vienna to set up the summit with Schuschnigg. [...] The ultimatum that Hitler presented to Schuschnigg, at the meeting on 12 February 1938, led to the Austrian government's capitulation to German threats and pressure, and paved the way for the Anschluss. On 13 March 1938, Hitler signed the [...] "Law concerning the Reunion (sic) of Austria with the German Reich" [...] making the Anschluss official. In the moments immediately following the union of Germany and Austria, Hitler sat motionless as tears of joy streamed <b>down</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> Papen was not there to experience this moment, perhaps fortunately for him since this alleged [...] "aggression" [...] against Austria was later recalled during the Nuremberg Trials.|$|E

In 220, Sun Quan became a vassal of the state of Cao Wei, which replaced the Han dynasty after the Wei founder, Cao Pi, forced Emperor Xian to abdicate the throne to him. Cao Pi sent Xing Zhen as an emissary to meet Sun Quan and confer the title [...] "King of Wu" [...] (吳王) on him. Xing Zhen behaved arrogantly in front of Sun Quan and incurred much anger from Sun Quan's subjects, including Zhang Zhao and Xu Sheng. Xu Sheng told his colleagues, [...] "Isn't it humiliating to watch our lord submit to Xing Zhen {{and not be able to}} serve him with our lives and help him conquer Xu, Luoyang and Bashu?" [...] Tears rolled <b>down</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> When Xing Zhen heard Xu Sheng's remark, he told an aide, [...] "It's obvious from the reactions of the subjects of Jiangdong that they won't remain subservient for long." [...] Xing Zhen was right, because in 222, Sun Quan declared independence from Wei but continued ruling his domain under the title [...] "King of Wu" [...] before declaring himself emperor in 229.|$|E
2500|$|In a rough {{game between}} the Blue Devils and Tar Heels that {{featured}} blood and broken bones, Duke used an early 9–0 run to take a 16–11 lead with 12:55 {{to go in the}} first half. Hubert Davis' three-point play capped off a Carolina run to give the Tar Heels a 20–19 lead. [...] The teams exchanged the lead 10 times before a Thomas Hill baseline jumper gave the Blue Devils a 39–38 halftime lead. [...] The Tar Heels opened the second half with a 10–0 spurt, but then saw its offense disappear. [...] Duke went five minutes before scoring a second-half basket but fought back with tough defense, holding Carolina without a field goal over the last 9½ minutes of the game. Carolina hit 12 of 14 free throws during that stretch; including two by Derrick Phelps with 44.5 seconds remaining to give the Tar Heels a 75–73 lead. Christian Laettner had two shots to tie the game in the final 24 seconds, but missed both. [...] However, the lasting image from this game had to be Carolina's Eric Montross who took a couple of rough elbows to the face and looked more like a boxer than a center as he sank two late free throws with blood streaming <b>down</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> Bobby Hurley broke his foot during the game, but continued playing. Brian Davis led Duke with 16 points, while Davis scored 16 for Carolina.|$|E
2500|$|The tie was the {{greatest}} of achievements for the underdog Commodores. The game's result was [...] "a great surprise to the sporting world." [...] It features prominently in the school's history. [...] "The Commodores surprising even to their followers, fought the Michigan eleven, headed by Coach Yost, to a standstill." [...] Commodore fans celebrated by throwing some 3,000 seat cushions onto the field. Many publications called it [...] "one of the big moments of the gridiron season." [...] The Vanderbilt Alumnus wrote [...] "That 0 to 0 finish meant night shirt parades and a sleepless night of jollification. [...] And so it was." [...] Vanderbilt's yearbook The Commodore remarked, [...] "Whence came that irresistible spirit that shattered the Michigan plays no one knows. [...] Every man on the squad possessed it. [...] It was the re-enactment {{of more than one}} chapter in the record of Vanderbilt's past. [...] There never was a greater reversal in the history of athletics than that day. [...] The dwarf stood like a Titan foot to foot and breast to breast with the grim Michigan giant, and disarmed him." [...] It was said one Detroit reporter wrote [...] "Michigan was lucky to escape with their lives." [...] Sam S. Greene remarked, [...] "The defensive showing of Vanderbilt against the touted attack of the Western conference moleskin wearers was a revelation even to the ardent followers of the gold and black, who had expected a defeat by at least three touchdowns." [...] Captain Neely had tears of joy streaming <b>down</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> by game's end. [...] "They were lucky to tie us," [...] Neely later said of Michigan.|$|E

2500|$|Empress Dowager Longyu {{endorsed}} the [...] "Imperial Edict of the Abdication of the Qing Emperor" [...] (清帝退位詔書) on 12 February 1912 under a deal brokered by Prime Minister Yuan Shikai (a {{general of the}} Beiyang Army) with the imperial court in Beijing and the Republicans in southern China. At the crucial meeting in the Forbidden City, Puyi watched the meeting between Longyu and Yuan, which he remembered as: [...] "The Dowager Empress {{was sitting on a}} kang [...] in a side room of the Mind Nature Palace, wiping her eyes with a handkerchief while a fat old man [...] knelt on a red cushion before her, tears rolling <b>down</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> I was sitting {{to the right of the}} Dowager and wondering why the two adults were crying. There was nobody in the room besides us three and it was very quiet; the fat man was sniffing while he talked and I could not understand what he was saying ... This was the occasion Yuan directly brought up the question of abdication". Under the [...] "Articles of Favourable Treatment of the Great Qing Emperor after His Abdication" [...] (清帝退位 優待條件), signed with the new Republic of China, Puyi was to retain his imperial title and be treated by the government of the Republic with the protocol attached to a foreign monarch. This was similar to Italy's Law of Guarantees (1870) which accorded the Pope certain honors and privileges similar to those enjoyed by the King of Italy. Puyi and the imperial court were allowed to remain in the northern half of the Forbidden City (the Private Apartments) as well as in the Summer Palace. A hefty annual subsidy of four million silver taels was granted by the Republic to the imperial household, although it was never fully paid and was abolished after just a few years. Puyi himself was not informed in February 1912 that his reign had ended and China was now a republic and continued to believe that he was the still the Emperor for sometime afterwards. In 1913, when the Empress Dowager Longyu died, President Yuan Shikai arrived at the Forbidden City to pay his respects, which Puyi's tutors told him meant that major changes were afloat.|$|E
