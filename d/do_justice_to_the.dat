5|$|During a rainy {{holiday in}} Hastings {{at the end}} of November 1903, Potter {{outlined}} a tale about a cat, a dog, and a tea party she called Something very very NICE. She discussed the Lakefield sketches as backgrounds for the tale with Warne. He proposed a large format volume similar to L. Leslie Brooke's Johnny Crow's Garden to <b>do</b> <b>justice</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> detail of the illustrations, but the entire project was set aside when The Tale of Benjamin Bunny and The Tale of Two Bad Mice were chosen for development and publication in 1904.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} <b>do</b> <b>justice</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{recording}} of Quadrophenia, the group {{decided to build}} their own studio, Ramport Studios in Battersea. Work started on building Ramport in November 1972, but five months later still lacked an adequate mixing desk that could handle recording Quadrophenia. Instead, Townshend's friend Ronnie Lane, bassist for The Faces, loaned his mobile studio for the sessions. Lambert ostensibly began producing the album in May, but missed recording sessions and generally lacked discipline. By mid 1973, Daltrey demanded that Lambert leave the Who's services. The band recruited engineer Ron Nevison, who had worked with Townshend's associate John Alcock, to assist with engineering.|$|E
5|$|Khan, Chopra, and Rampal {{underwent}} extensive {{martial arts}} training from an expert from the Shaolin Temple. The principal cast received training in {{different kinds of}} martial arts. Khan revealed that he {{had always wanted to}} look the way Amitabh Bachchan had in his films, but he said he gave his own interpretation to the role. After signing to do the film, Chopra was very excited, but a few days later, she became nervous, wondering if {{she would be able to}} <b>do</b> <b>justice</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> character. Having seen the original film as a teenager, Chopra avoided watching the film again as she did not wanted to imitate Zeenat Aman's portrayal of Roma. She made a conscious effort to give her own look and style to the character.|$|E

5|$|Originally {{scheduled}} for a single theatrical release, on 13 March 2008, Warner Bros. announced that the film adaptation of Deathly Hallows would be split into two parts to <b>do</b> <b>justice</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> book and {{out of respect for}} its fans.Yates, director ofthe previous two films,was confirmed to return as director, and Kloves was confirmed as screenwriter. For {{the first time in the}} series, Rowling was credited as a producer alongside Heyman and Barron, however Yates noted that her participation in the filmmaking process did not change from the previous films. Pre-production began on 26 January 2009, while principal photography began on 19 February at Leavesden Studios, where the previous six instalments were filmed. Pinewood Studios became the second studio location for shooting the seventh film. The premiere of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1 was held on 11 November 2010, at the Empire, Leicester Square in London, and the film was released in the United Kingdom and the United States on 19 November.|$|E

5000|$|The Promise Part 1 has {{received}} mostly positive reviews, with Convention Scene praising Yang's {{portrayal of the}} characters. Convention Scene also praised Gurihiru Studio's artwork, stating that it <b>did</b> <b>justice</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> series. The Seattle Post-Intelligencer called the graphic novel an [...] "enjoyable read {{even if you are}} not well versed in the story's universe." ...|$|R

25|$|The Player tells Guildenstern {{that all}} paths end in death. Guildenstern snaps and draws the Player's dagger from his belt, {{shouting}} at {{him that his}} portrayals of death do not <b>do</b> <b>justice</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> real thing. He stabs the Player and the Player appears to die. Guildenstern fully believes he has killed the Player. Seconds later, the Tragedians begin to clap and the Player stands up and brushes himself off, revealing the knife to be a theatrical one with a retractable blade. The Tragedians then act out the deaths from the final scene of Hamlet.|$|E
25|$|At {{about the}} same time as {{accepting}} MacDonald's offer of the directorship, Clark had declined one from King George V's officials to succeed C. H. Collins Baker as Surveyor of the King's Pictures. He felt that he could not <b>do</b> <b>justice</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> post in tandem with his new duties at the gallery. The king, determined to succeed where his staff had failed, went with Queen Mary to the National Gallery and persuaded Clark to change his mind. The appointment was announced in The London Gazette in July 1934; Clark held the post for the next ten years.|$|E

25|$|Jones's {{studies of}} the Alhambra in Granada were pivotal in the {{development}} of his theories on flat pattern, geometry and polychromy. His travelling companion, Jules Goury, had recently been working with Gottfried Semper on his analysis of the polychromy of Ancient Greek buildings, and this was very likely a key factor in Jones embarking on such a scientific and detailed appraisal of the decoration at the Alhambra. Goury died of cholera – at the age of 31 – during their six-month stay at the Alhambra, and Jones returned to London determined to publish the results of their studies. The standard of colour printing at that time was not sophisticated enough to <b>do</b> <b>justice</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> intricate decoration of the Alhambra, therefore Jones undertook the printing work himself. Collaborating with chemists and printers, Jones took it upon himself to research the new process of chromolithography. He issued this labour of love, Plans, Elevations, Sections and Details of the Alhambra, in twelve parts over a period of almost ten years, from 1836 to 1845. It was the world's first ever published work of any significance to employ chromolithography, and was to be a key milestone {{in the development of}} Owen Jones's reputation as a design theorist.|$|E
25|$|At the Santa Fe campus, {{there is}} a program {{offering}} a Master of Arts in Eastern Classics (M.A.E.C.). This program is three semesters long and {{is designed to be}} completed in one 12-month period. The impetus for the program came with the recognition that the undergraduate program simply could not <b>do</b> <b>justice</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Great Books of the three main Asian traditions (India, China and Japan) by trying to squeeze in a few works among so many European masterworks. The EC program therefore provides a full set of readings in the philosophical, religious and literary traditions of the three cultures listed above. Thus, students learn Chinese culture by reading not only Confucius, Laozi and Zhuangzi, but also Mencius, Xun Zi, Han Feizi, and Mozi, as well as historical narratives by Sima Qian and the Zuo Zhuan, the later movement of Neo-Confucianism and Zhu Xi, narrative works such as Journey to the West or the Romance of the Three Kingdoms and the great Chinese poets, Li Bai, Wang Wei and Du Fu. This list represents only one-third of the required corpus, which also covers the major teachings and branches of Hinduism and the development of Theravada, Mahayana and Zen Buddhism, as well as such literary masterpieces as the Mahabharata, Shakuntala, The Tale of Genji, The Narrow Road to the Deep North and others. Students also take a language, either Sanskrit or Classical Chinese.|$|E
500|$|In {{the essay}} on King Lear, which he {{entitled}} simply [...] "Lear", Hazlitt makes no {{references to the}} performances of any actors. In fact, here he fully agrees with Lamb that King Lear, like Hamlet, cannot be adequately presented on stage. No actors, he felt, could <b>do</b> <b>justice</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> overwhelming imaginative power of this play.|$|E

500|$|Faulks {{wrote the}} novel {{partly because he}} felt that the First World War had not been {{discussed}} enough in both literary and historical contexts. Reflecting on the novel twenty years later, Faulks felt that the published version did not fully <b>do</b> <b>justice</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> experience of war: it did not provide readers with [...] "a full appreciation of the soldiers' physical experience; and, perhaps more importantly, a philosophical understanding of {{what it meant to be}} part of the first genocidal event of the century – the one that made the others imaginable".|$|E
500|$|However, Johar {{maintained}} that the new film would belong to a different milieu {{as compared to the}} original.

We really hope that we are able to <b>do</b> <b>justice</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> original and make the remake exciting for today's generation." [...] In an interview with Filmfare, he added that the protagonist of the film would be [...] "more of an underdog", while the antagonist would be [...] "more flamboyant and menacing" [...] than the older version.|$|E
50|$|Chaudhry also renewed his {{criticism}} of the country's fourteen provincial councils and of the Great Council of Chiefs.

500|$|Billboard {{magazine}} was not {{enthusiastic about the}} 1974 re-release, thinking it looked dated, and stated that the film was [...] "dull, unimaginative and hokey, and does not <b>do</b> <b>justice</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Pink Floyd Vision". However, more recent reviews have been favourable. Billboard reviewed a video release in 1984, and on this occasion, Faye Zuckerman, while not particularly keen on the footage in the Abbey Road canteen, stated it was [...] "vastly superior to most other concert movies". Reviewing the Director's Cut DVD, Richie Unterberger said the film had [...] "first-rate cinematography" [...] and was [...] "undeniably impressive", while Peter Marsh, reviewing for the BBC, stated it was [...] "my favourite concert film of all time", though his opinions of the new computer generated imagery were mixed.|$|E
500|$|Breckinridge's men {{initially}} {{broke the}} Union line and forced {{them across the}} river. Artillery {{on the opposite side}} of the river then opened fire on Breckinridge's men, and reinforcements for the fleeing Union troops arrived. In just over an hour, [...] nearly one-third of Breckinridge's troops were killed, wounded, or captured. One anecdote holds that, as he rode among the survivors, he cried out repeatedly, [...] "My poor Orphans! My poor Orphans," [...] bringing recognition to the Orphan Brigade. Bragg's official report criticized the conduct of Breckinridge's division and assigned to Breckinridge most of the blame for the Confederate defeat. Breckinridge asserted to his superiors that Bragg's report [...] "fails... to <b>do</b> <b>justice</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> behavior of my Division"; he requested a court of inquiry, but the request was denied. Several Kentuckians under Breckinridge's command, who already blamed Bragg for the failed invasion of their native state, encouraged him to resign his commission and challenge Bragg to a duel.|$|E
500|$|A Green Lantern and Hal Jordan's mentor. Strong {{affirmed that}} the film will follow the origin story, [...] "the film closely follows the early comics. Sinestro starts out as Hal Jordan’s mentor, {{slightly}} suspicious and not sure of him because obviously Hal is the first human being who’s made into a Green Lantern. He's certainly very strict and unsure of the wisdom of Hal becoming a Green Lantern". Strong said, the character [...] "is a military guy but isn't immediately bad. It's {{the kind of person}} that lends himself to becoming bad over the course of the comics being written, but initially he’s quite a heroic figure." [...] He also revealed that the outfit and other aspects of the character very closely follow the character's early days, [...] "That widow's peak and thin mustache was for some reason originally based on David Niven...
