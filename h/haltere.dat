25|$|The {{adults are}} black with a silvery-gray coat on the thorax and abdomen. They are 6 to 7mm long, with clear wings and {{yellowish}} calypters. The knob of the <b>haltere</b> is yellow while the stalk is brownish yellow. The dorsal abdomen has a dark median stripe {{that produces a}} series of triangular markings with the segmentally arranged transverse bands. The thorax of the adult has three longitudinal stripes. They are darker than F. canicularis. The tibia on the mesothoraic leg has a distinct process, and the coxae have two setae at the apex. The fourth vein on the wing of this species is straight, as compared to it being curved in the house fly. There is a great variance between the sexes of this species, and more {{is known about the}} male. For instance; their mid femur does not have blunt spines, the ventral tubercle of the mid tibia is indistinct, and the abdomen has no spots or stripes and is short and broad.|$|E
50|$|Interestingly, though halteres are {{coupled with}} the wings and with each other during flight, some flies {{oscillate}} their halteres while walking (without oscillating their wings). Because the <b>haltere</b> muscles are tiny {{in comparison to the}} flight muscles, flight muscle activity completely overshadows that of the <b>haltere</b> muscles during flight. It is unknown how <b>haltere</b> muscle activity during flight differs from walking. The left and right halteres show much more variable phase relationships while walking compared with flying, which may indicate decoupling of the left and right <b>haltere</b> muscles.|$|E
5000|$|Sensory inputs {{from five}} sensory fields {{located at the}} base of the <b>haltere</b> all {{converge}} onto one nerve, the <b>haltere</b> nerve. How these sensory fields are organized at the level of the central nervous system is currently unknown. It has been determined that those five sensory fields all project to the thorax in a [...] "region-specific" [...] way and afferents originating from the forewing were also shown to converge in the same regions. Not every specific target for the <b>haltere</b> afferents have been determined, but a few connections between motor neurons known to be involved in wing steering control and particular <b>haltere</b> sensory fields have been identified, particularly one synapse between the <b>haltere</b> nerve and a wing steering motor neuron known as mnb1.|$|E
50|$|The <b>halteres</b> are {{club-shaped}} organs, used {{to balance}} the insect in flight, consisting of a proximal portion connected to a mechano-sensory organ. The homology between the wings and <b>halteres</b> is demonstrated by the four-winged mutant of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. The development of the <b>halteres</b> varies according to the systematic group: in the Tipulidae are they are thin but long and clearly visible, but are usually hidden by the wings in most other groups. In Calyptratae which includes the most advanced Diptera, the <b>halteres</b> are protected by calyptrae (small membranes above the <b>halteres).</b>|$|R
25|$|The fly's <b>halteres</b> {{oscillate}} in a {{plane at}} the same beat frequency as the main wings so that any body rotation results in lateral deviation of the <b>halteres</b> from their plane of motion.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Halteres</b> (ἁλτῆρες, from [...] "ἅλλομαι" [...] - hallomai, [...] "leap, spring"; cf. [...] "ἅλμα" [...] - halma, [...] "leaping") were {{a type of}} {{dumbbells}} used in Ancient Greece. In ancient Greek sports, <b>halteres</b> {{were used}} as lifting weights, and also as weights in their version of the long jump, which was probably a set of three jumps. <b>Halteres</b> were held in both hands to allow an athlete to jump a greater distance; {{they may have been}} dropped after the first or second jump. According to archaeological evidence, the athlete would swing the weights backwards and forwards just before take-off, thrust them forwards during take-off, and swing them backwards just before releasing them and landing. <b>Halteres</b> were made of stone or metal, and weighed between 2 and 9 kg.|$|R

5000|$|The general {{structure}} of halteres are well recognized, but much variability exists between species. The more ancient families, such as tipulidae (crane flies), possess halteres with rather long stalks. This causes the <b>haltere</b> bulbs {{to be much}} further from the body and easily {{visible to the naked}} eye. More derived families, such as Calliphoridae (blow flies), have developed specialized structures called [...] "calyptrae" [...] or [...] "squama", which are tiny flaps of wing, that cover the <b>haltere.</b> Pringle (1948) hypothesized that they prevented wind turbulence from affecting <b>haltere</b> movements, allowing more precise detection of body position, but this was never tested. The stalk of the <b>haltere</b> is also not always straight. Instead, the stalk's shape in more derived families tends to be reflective of the body shape of the individual. This minimizes the amount of air space between end-knobs and the sides of the abdomen and thorax. In these families, the halteres beat so close to the body that the distance between <b>haltere</b> and thorax is a fraction of the diameter of the <b>haltere</b> bulb. An extreme example of this trait is in the family Syrphidae (hoverflies), where the bulb of the <b>haltere</b> is positioned nearly perpendicular to the stalk.|$|E
50|$|When halteres are {{experimentally}} induced to flap, volleys {{of action}} potentials within the <b>haltere</b> nerve occur in synchrony with the haltere-beat frequency. When flies are then rotated, these volleys break down, likely {{in response to}} different groups of sensilla being activated to inform the fly of its recently changed body position. <b>Haltere</b> afferents have {{also been shown to}} terminate in the mesothoracic neuropil where flight muscle neurons are located. <b>Haltere</b> afferent activity responding to rotations and wing steering behavior converge in this processing region.|$|E
5|$|Flies {{are capable}} of great {{manoeuvrability}} during flight due {{to the presence of}} the <b>halteres.</b> These act as gyroscopic organs and are rapidly oscillated in time with the wings; they act as a balance and guidance system by providing rapid feedback to the wing-steering muscles, and flies deprived of their <b>halteres</b> are unable to fly. The wings and <b>halteres</b> move in synchrony but the amplitude of each wing beat is independent, allowing the fly to turn sideways. The wings of the fly are attached to two kinds of muscles, those used to power it and another set used for fine control.|$|R

50|$|The way {{in which}} {{rotation}} sensation is accomplished {{is that there are}} five distinct sensory fields located {{at the base of the}} <b>haltere.</b> These fields, which actually contain the majority of campaniform sensilla found on the exoskeleton of blowflies (more than 400 campaniform sensilla per <b>haltere),</b> are activated in response to strain created by movements at the <b>haltere</b> base in different directions (due to Coriolis forces acting on the end knobs). Campaniform sensilla are cap-shaped protrusions located on the surface of the exoskeleton (cuticle) of insects. Attached inside the cap is the tip of a dendritic projection (or sensory nerve fiber). The outer segment of the dendritic projection is attached to the inside surface of the cap. When the <b>haltere</b> is pushed to one side, the cuticle of the insect bends and the surface of the cap is distorted. The inner dendrite is able to detect this distortion and convert it to an electrical signal which is sent to the central nervous system to be interpreted.|$|E

50|$|Flies rely on both visual {{information}} from their compound eyes and mechanical input from their <b>halteres.</b> Sherman and Dickinson (2002) {{discovered that the}} responsiveness of the <b>halteres</b> and eyes are tuned to complimentary speeds of rotation. Responses to body rotations detected via the visual system are greatest at slow speeds and decrease with increased angular velocity. In contrast, body rotations detected by the <b>halteres</b> elicit the greatest responses at higher angular velocities and degrade as the speed of rotation decreases. The integration of these two separately tuned sensors allows the flies to detect {{a wide range of}} angular velocities in all three directions of rotation.|$|R

50|$|Chordotonal organs {{detect and}} {{transmit}} distortions in their position/shape {{in the same}} way that campaniform sensilla do. They differ slightly at their site of detection. Chordotonal organs, unlike campaniform sensilla, exist beneath the cuticle and typically respond to stretch as opposed to distortion or bending. Their sensory nerve endings attach between two internal points and when those points are stretched, the difference in length is what is detected and transformed into electrical signaling. There are far fewer chordotonal organs at the base of the <b>haltere</b> than campaniform sensilla (on the order of hundreds), so it is assumed that they are far less important for detecting and transmitting rotational information from <b>haltere</b> movements.|$|E

50|$|The {{movement}} of the wings and the halteres are mechanically coupled. Sane et al. (2015) demonstrated that in freshly killed flies, without any neural input, the {{movement of}} wings was still coupled with the movement of halteres. When a forcep was used to manually move a wing up and down, {{not only did the}} opposite wing move in synchrony, the halteres also beat in antiphase with both wings. The source of this coupling however, was not between the muscles which control the halteres and those that control the wings. Instead, two small ridges of cuticle known as the subepimeral ridges were found to be responsible. These ridges connect the right wing to the right <b>haltere</b> and the left wing to the left <b>haltere.</b>|$|E

50|$|Flies (Diptera) {{and some}} moths (Lepidoptera) exploit the Coriolis effect in flight with {{specialized}} appendages and organs that relay {{information about the}} angular velocity of their bodies. Coriolis forces resulting from linear motion of these appendages are detected within the rotating frame of reference of the insects' bodies. In the case of flies, their specialized appendages are dumbbell shaped organs located just behind their wings called <b>halteres.</b> The <b>halteres</b> oscillate in a plane at the same beat frequency as the main wings so that any body rotation results in lateral deviation of the <b>halteres</b> from their plane of motion. In moths, their antennae {{are responsible for the}} sensing of Coriolis forces in the similar manner as with the <b>halteres</b> in flies. In both flies and moths, a collection of mechanosensors {{at the base of the}} appendage are sensitive to deviations at the beat frequency, correlating to rotation in the pitch and roll planes, and at twice the beat frequency, correlating to rotation in the yaw plane.|$|R
50|$|Strepsipterans, more {{commonly}} referred to as twisted wing parasites, are a unique group of insects with major sexual dimorphism. The females spend their entire lives in a grub-like state, parasitizing larger insects. The only time they ever come out of their host insect is to extend their fused heads and thoraces for males to notice. The males are also parasites, but they eventually will leave their host to seek their female counterparts. Because of this, they still retain the ability to fly. Male strepsipterans uniquely possess two hindwings, while their forewings have taken on the club-like form of <b>halteres.</b> Though strepsipterans are very difficult to locate and are additionally rather short-lived, Pix et al. (1993) confirmed that the specialized forewings that male Strepsiptera possess perform the same function as dipteran <b>halteres.</b> Rotational movements of the body combined with the oscillating <b>halteres</b> produce Coriolis forces that can be detected by fields of mechanosensors (campaniform sensilla) located {{at the base of the}} <b>halteres.</b> Using functional morphology and behavior studies, Pix et al. showed that these sensors then transmit body position information to the head and abdomen to produce compensatory movements. For simplicity, the remainder of this article will refer only to dipteran <b>halteres.</b>|$|R
50|$|Halteres {{are able}} to sense small {{deviations}} in body position using the gyroscopic properties of moving mass. What {{this means is that}} halteres beat up and down in time with the flapping of the wings along a linear pathway, but when the fly's body begins to rotate, the path of the beating halteres also changes. Now, instead of the halteres following a linear path, they begin to follow a curved path. The larger the perturbation they experience, the farther the halteres move from their original linear path. During these periods, the <b>haltere</b> is no longer moving in only two directions (up and down), but four (up, down, left, and right). The force exerted on the halteres in response to this left right movement is known as Coriolis force and can be produced when any moving object is rotated in the three directions of rotation, yaw, pitch or roll (see figure). When this occurs, tiny bell-shaped structures {{at the base of the}} <b>haltere</b> experience strain as the <b>haltere</b> stalk bends in their direction. The nervous system can then transform the bending of these hairs into electrical signals, which the fly interprets as body rotation information. The fly uses this information to make corrections to its position and thereby restabilizes itself during flight. Further details explaining the dynamics and physiology of halteres are described below.|$|E
50|$|Mutations of the Ubx gene {{will lead}} to {{transformation}} of dorsal and ventral appendages of the third thoracic segment(T3), which includes the <b>haltere</b> and third leg, into the counterparts on the second thoracic segment(T2).

5|$|In the Diptera (true flies), {{there is}} only one pair of {{functional}} wings, with the posterior pair of wings are reduced to <b>halteres,</b> which help the fly to sense its orientation and movement, as well as to improve balance by acting similar to gyroscopes. In Calyptratae, the very hindmost portion of the wings are modified into somewhat thickened flaps called calypters which cover the <b>halteres.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} balancer theory, {{which was}} postulated by Pringle (1948), only accounted for forces produced in two directions. Pringle claimed that yaw {{was the only}} direction of rotation that flies used their halteres to detect. Using high speed video analysis, Faust (1952) demonstrated {{that this was not}} the case and that halteres are capable of detecting all three directions of rotation. In response to this new discovery, Pringle reexamined his previous assumption and came to the conclusion that flies were capable of detecting all three directions of rotation simply by comparing inputs from the left and right sides of the body. Of course, this is not the actual mechanism by which flies detect rotation. Different fields of sensory organs located in different regions at the base of each <b>haltere</b> detect the different directions of rotation, which also explains why flies with one <b>haltere</b> are still able to fly without issue.|$|E
50|$|Glypicans can modify cell {{signaling}} pathways {{and contribute to}} cellular proliferation and tissue growth. In Drosophila, the glypican dally assists diffusion of the BMP-family growth-promoting morphogen Decapentaplegic in the developing wing, while the developing <b>haltere</b> lacks dally and remains small. Extracellular localization of the other glypican in Drosophila, dally-like, is also required for the proper level of Hedgehog signaling in the developing wing.|$|E
50|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that the halteres {{evolved from the}} hindwings of insects. Their movement, structure and development all support this hypothesis. Characterizations of the arrangement of sensory organs known as campaniform sensilla, found {{at the base of}} the <b>haltere,</b> show many similarities to those found {{at the base of the}} hindwings in other insects. The sensilla are arranged in a way so similar to that of hindwings, that were the halteres to be replaced with wings, the forces produced would still be sufficient to activate the same sensory organs. Genetic studies have also brought to light many similarities between halteres and hindwings. In fact, <b>haltere</b> development has been traced back to a single gene (Ubx), which when deactivated results in the formation of a hindwing instead. Because just a single gene is responsible for this change, it is easy to imagine a small mutation here leading to the formation of the first halteres.|$|E
5000|$|The {{majority}} of insects have {{two pairs of}} wings. What makes flies unique is that they possess only one set of lift-generating wings and yet are still regarded {{as some of the}} most skillful fliers. The order name for flies, [...] "Diptera" [...] literally means two wings, but there is another order of insect which has evolved flight with only two wings: strepsipterans, which are more commonly referred to as twisted wing parasites; they are the only other organism that possess two wings and two <b>halteres.</b> The only difference is that strepsipterans have adapted their forewings into <b>halteres,</b> whereas dipterans have adapted their hindwings into <b>halteres.</b> This unique structure which detects rotations/perturbations during flight has never been described in nature elsewhere.|$|R

40|$|Flying insects {{rely heavily}} on mechanoreception for flight control. True flies use <b>halteres</b> to provide {{feedback}} on body rotations. Recent behavioral and theoretical evidence suggest that wings, antecedents of the <b>halteres,</b> might also serve a similar sensory function. Both wings and <b>halteres</b> have mechanoreceptors called campaniform sensilla. In <b>halteres</b> those sensors {{are believed to be}} directionally sensitive, allowing them to detect exceedingly tiny out of plane deformations that arise from Coriolis forces. Similarly, sensilla could detect tiny deformations that are present as torsion in flapping wings subject to simultaneous body rotations. We combine theoretical and experimental analyses of flapping wings in the hawkmoth Manduca sexta. Like <b>halteres,</b> their sensilla respond to local strains which result from the combination of inertial, aerodynamic and gyroscopic forces acting on the wings. Their spike timing is exceedingly precise with sub-millisecond variability in response to mechanical stimuli. We ask whether the nervous system could determine body rotations based on spike arrival times, not requiring high directional sensitivity of individual sensilla. Combining structural simulation and electrophysiological measurements, we find that the resulting spike timing differences depend linearly on rotation rate. Moreover, rotation rates above 2130 ° s^(- 1) result in spike timing differences larger than the median 160 microsecond spike time variability of single units. These data suggest an alternative hypothesis for the neural basis of gyroscopic sensing, based on spike timing rather than on extreme directional sensitivity of campaniform sensilla...|$|R
