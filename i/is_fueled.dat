5|$|Smith's script, titled Superman Lives, had Brainiac sending Doomsday to kill Superman, {{as well as}} {{blocking}} out the sun to make Superman powerless, as Superman <b>is</b> <b>fueled</b> by sunlight. Brainiac teams up with Lex Luthor, but Superman is resurrected by a Kryptonian robot, the Eradicator. Brainiac wishes to possess the Eradicator and its technology. Powerless, the resurrected Superman is sheathed in a robotic suit formed from the Eradicator itself until his powers return, courtesy of sunbeams, and defeats Brainiac. Smith's casting choices included Ben Affleck as Clark Kent/Superman, Linda Fiorentino as Lois Lane, Jack Nicholson as Lex Luthor, Famke Janssen as Mercy, John Mahoney as Perry White, David Hyde Pierce as the Eradicator, Jason Lee as Brainiac and Jason Mewes as Jimmy Olsen.|$|E
5|$|Duke {{regards the}} rivalry as far less {{significant}} than the Carolina–Duke rivalry. The Duke–Michigan rivalry <b>is</b> <b>fueled</b> {{by the fact}} that both institutions strive to be premier academic institutions with solid reputations for producing scholars and student athletes rather than just athletic powerhouses. Duke and Michigan have played one another in men's basketball 30 times. The teams have played twice in the same season three times: 1963–64, 1991–92, and 2008–09. Michigan has played Duke more times than they have any other school outside of the state of Michigan that has never {{been a member of the}} Big Ten Conference. In turn, Duke's 30 games against Michigan are the most they have played any other school outside of the Maryland-Virginia-North Carolina-South Carolina region that has never been a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference. Eight of the meetings between Duke and Michigan have featured opponents both ranked in the top ten in the AP Poll; six times both teams were ranked in the top five. Michigan has not faced any of its fellow conference members as many times with both participants so highly ranked.|$|E

25|$|Cuttings {{of sweet}} potato vine, either edible or {{ornamental}} cultivars, will rapidly form roots {{in water and}} will grow in it, indefinitely, in good lighting with {{a steady supply of}} nutrients. For this reason, sweet potato vine is ideal for use in home aquariums, trailing out of the water with its roots submerged, as its rapid growth <b>is</b> <b>fueled</b> by toxic ammonia and nitrates, a waste product of aquatic life, which it removes from the water. This improves the living conditions for fish, which also find refuge in the vast root systems.|$|E

The engine performance and the emissions were studied when the engine <b>was</b> <b>fueled</b> with diesel and micro-emulsion diesel respectively. Results showed that when the engine <b>was</b> <b>fueled</b> with micro-emulsion diesel, the NOX and smoke emissions were decreased obviously and HC and CO emissions were increased slightly. Discounting of surfactant and water, the specific fuel consumption of micro-emulsion diesel was lower than those of diesel under any load at the speed of 2900 r/min...|$|R

25|$|Doro is the story’s antagonist. He too is a mutant, born in Egypt {{during the}} reign of the Pharaohs. As he {{approaches}} puberty, Doro learns quite accidentally that he is a “body snatcher,” meaning that his life extended by killing the nearest person to him and subsuming his/her physical body. His immortality, therefore, <b>is</b> <b>fueled</b> by cruelty, and a desire for power and control. Long ago he became singularly fixated on breeding superhumans to form a psionic society that will provide him with the human bodies he needs, as well as sexual partners. Doro’s qualities are god-like, inducing members of his society to simultaneously fear and revere him. However, there is no one on earth that can satisfy his need for companionship, until he meets Anyanwu.|$|E
25|$|Cardiometabolic risk among {{children}} and adolescents <b>is</b> <b>fueled</b> by the rising prevalence of obesity in this age group. From 1980 to 2008, rates of obesity have increased from 5% to 10% among preschool children aged 2–5. During the same time period, obesity increased from 6.5% to nearly 20% among 6-11year-olds and from 5% to 18% among adolescents aged 12–19. Hypertension {{among children}} and adolescents has increased by 1% since 1999 and is estimated to affect 3.6% of those aged 3–18. This increase is attributed to the rising number of overweight and obese children. The prevalence of lipid abnormalities among {{children and adolescents}} is also tied to obesity and overweight. Approximately 14% of normal-weight youths aged 12–19 have lipid abnormalities. That figure rises to 22% of overweight youths and nearly 43% of obese youths.|$|E

[...] Grey also serves as the show's narrator, and as such was likened in early reviews to Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker), the narrator and protagonist of Sex and the City. After her initial contract with Grey's Anatomy expired, Pompeo negotiated a new one, in which she would be paid US$200,000 per episode, making her and Dempsey the highest-paid cast members on the show. In 2012, Forbes recognized Pompeo as the eighth highest-paid actress on television, with a salary of US$275,000 per episode for her role on Grey's Anatomy.|$|E
