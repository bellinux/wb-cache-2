25|$|Bahía Blanca is an {{important}} trans-shipping and commercial center, handling the large export trade of grains and wool from the southern area of Buenos Aires Province, oil from Neuquén Province, and fruit from the Río Negro Valley. Its group of sea ports {{is one of the}} most important in the country as the only ones that are naturally 33 feet (10 metres) deep, although the depth of the main channel is kept at 40 feet (12.19 metres) by regular maintenance. Along the northeastern shore of the bay, these ports are Puerto Ingeniero White for grains and containers, and Puerto Galván, a smaller one specialising in sunflower and soy oil, and chemicals such as urea. One of the largest urea industrial producers in the world, Profertil, is located there. Between these two main ports, several industrial and chemical plants operate their own piers. The petrochemical pole of the region made the port a very convenient one. Competence between Puerto de Bahía Blanca and those located in the shores of Patagonia (subsidized by provincial governments through the National Treasury) made it stronger and very well organized having received investments from the private sector like Cargill that upgraded facilities in the 1980s. The combination of a railroad network for grains linking Rosario (Santa Fe Province), by the shore of Paraná River to Bahía Blanca, its trade potential, linking also Bahía Blanca to Zapala, very close to the border to Chile and then to the Pacific Ocean shores avoiding days of navigation through Ferrocarril Transandino del Sur, the availability of energy (natural gas and electricity) and human resources make the area quite an <b>interesting</b> <b>one</b> from the industrial and commercial perspectives.|$|E

The memorial to Henry Morris is described as [...] "beautifully lettered".|$|E
500|$|Another unorthodox {{method used}} in the film was the way low-angle shots were used to display {{a point of view}} facing upwards, thus {{allowing}} ceilings to be shown in the background of several scenes. Breaking with studio convention, every set was built with a ceiling—many constructed of fabric that ingeniously concealed microphones. Welles felt that the camera should show what the eyes see, and that it was a bad theatrical convention to pretend there was no ceiling—"a big lie in order to get all those terrible lights up there," [...] he said. He became fascinated with the look of low angles, which made even dull interiors look <b>interesting.</b> <b>One</b> extremely low angle is used to photograph the encounter between Kane and Leland after Kane loses the election. A hole was dug for the camera, which required drilling into the concrete floor.|$|E
500|$|Chapman {{considered}} {{the concept of}} an elderly Bond to be an <b>interesting</b> <b>one,</b> with Bond referring to Connery's Bond as a [...] "sexual acrobat who leaves a trail of beautiful dead women behind like blown roses". In line with the literary Bond, Niven's character drives a vintage Bentley, rather than the Aston Martin favoured by Connery. Bond scholar Steven Jay Rubin thought Niven perfectly cast as the retired Bond, and saw him as [...] "a throw-back to the hell-for-leather adventure heroes" [...] of the character, which paralleled Niven's own life and career. Barnes and Hearn describe this as a [...] "perfectly fair interpretation", given the way Niven approached the role, while Raymond Benson thinks casting Niven was [...] "intelligent". Jeremy Black questioned the use of Niven in the role, observing that he {{did not seem to be}} a killer, and did not have the [...] "disconcerting edge" [...] that Connery had.|$|E

500|$|Most of Gould's {{empirical}} research pertained to land snails. He focused his early {{work on the}} Bermudian genus Poecilozonites, while his later work concentrated on the West Indian genus Cerion. According to Gould [...] "Cerion is the land snail of maximal diversity in form throughout the entire world. There are 600 described species of this single genus. In fact, they're not really species, they all interbreed, but the names exist to express a real phenomenon which is this incredible morphological diversity. Some are shaped like golf balls, some are shaped like pencils. ... Now my main subject is the evolution of form, {{and the problem of}} how it is that you can get this diversity amid so little genetic difference, so far as we can tell, is a very <b>interesting</b> <b>one.</b> And if we could solve this we'd learn something general about the evolution of form." ...|$|E
500|$|Zeta-Jones' first {{release of}} 1999 was the heist film Entrapment, {{in which she}} starred {{opposite}} Sean Connery as a seductive insurance agent {{on the lookout for}} an art thief. Despite a negative critical reception, the film was a commercial success; Janet Maslin of The New York Times thought that the film provided Zeta-Jones a platform to [...] "show off her slithery skills", and Desson Howe of The Washington Post called on viewers to appreciate the sex appeal she brought to the role. Later that year, Zeta-Jones appeared alongside Liam Neeson and Lili Taylor in The Haunting, a remake of the 1963 film of the same name about a team of paranormal experts who look into strange occurrences in an ill-fated mansion. The horror feature received generally poor reviews but found a significant worldwide audience. In a scathing review, the critic Mick LaSalle wrote that [...] "Zeta-Jones seems less an actress and more a pretty face, and not an <b>interesting</b> <b>one</b> at that".|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers {{felt that}} the {{introduction}} of Rory overdid his Irishness. Benigno called it [...] "cheap stereotyping", and [...] "juvenile" [...] {{on the part of}} the writers. West, while she admitted that [...] "it may have been a little heavy-handed" [...] to have Rory in green, felt it [...] "worked", especially for his opening solo and [...] "his isolation" [...] during it. Jen Chaney of The Washington Post characterized the tweaking of that solo to be about [...] "Irish exchange students being bullied" [...] as [...] "forced", and VanDerWerff wrote that he was tired of [...] "people just randomly getting shoved around for no real reason". Benigno noted that Sugar was also being bullied—by Santana—and wrote that he was [...] "not a fan" [...] of this [...] "on a show that supposedly glorifies outcasts and promotes their successes". Santana came in for praise from Kubicek, along with Brittany, for their [...] "fantastic date" [...] and their relationship which is [...] "the most <b>interesting</b> <b>one</b> on the show". The new show choir they join, the Troubletones, was acclaimed by Bell: [...] "I'm really loving Shelby's diva troupe." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{show was}} {{announced}} in late 2004 as a mid-season replacement for Boston Legal. It was originally scheduled {{to run in the}} Boston Legal time slot for just four weeks, but after receiving high ratings remained in the time slot {{for the remainder of the}} season. ABC Entertainment President Steve McPherson commented on the scheduling decision: [...] "Ultimately we decided that, without having adequate lead time or marketing dollars to devote to moving either show so late in the season, we'd continue to let 'Grey's' build on its tremendous momentum through May." [...] Prior to broadcast, it was announced that the show's title would change from Grey's Anatomy to Complications, although ultimately this did not come to pass. Francie Calfo, executive vice president for development at ABC Entertainment, commented on the show's conception: [...] "I think there was a need for this kind of show on our air, specifically a medical show. And Shonda found a twist on it that made it perfect for where we're at right now. Medical shows are hard, and it was hard trying to figure out where ours could be different. But where everybody else is speeding up their medical shows, she found a way to slow it down, so you get to know the characters. There's definitely a strong female appeal to it." [...] Rhimes explained that she had found the idea of a show about smart women competing against one another an <b>interesting</b> <b>one.</b>|$|E
500|$|Rolling Stone writer Christian Hoard {{summarized}} {{the record and}} the mixed reviews simply as [...] "DeLonge yanks heartstrings with so-so results" [...] and saw the atmospheric elements as excessive. Spin had a similar sentiment: [...] "Here, his three sidemen elevate [...] emo tendencies to something grander and more timelessly romantic—though somewhat less exciting. Blender scrunitized {{the composition of the}} album as it contains the [...] "duller" [...] aspects of Blink-182 accompanied with U2-influenced guitar chimes.Many critics arraigned the album to be pretentious and contrasted Angels & Airwaves with Blink-182. The A.V. Club journalist Kyle Ryan described his experience with We Don't Need to Whisper as 50 minutes of DeLonge demonstrating his musical skills. English magazine Uncut discerned his departure from Blink-182 and the album's serious tone. AllMusic writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine praised the differences in musical style between both bands, but remained polarized about the album and commented that [...] "It may not make for a successful record, but it does make for an <b>interesting</b> <b>one,</b> particularly in how DeLonge's desire to be taken seriously has led him to use the serious music of his adolescence as a signifier that he's serious now, but We Don't Need to Whisper is too doggedly dour and amorphous {{to be more than a}} curiosity."The album sold 127,000 copies its first week, and was certified Gold by the RIAA. It was nominated for an MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist in a Video, Best Special Effects in a Video and Best Editing in a Video for [...] "The Adventure," [...] as well as Best Band of 2006 for We Don't Need to Whisper.|$|E
500|$|By April 2013, filming was {{scheduled}} to begin in early 2014 at Shepperton Studios in England. At the Hollywood premiere of Iron Man 3, Whedon {{said that he had}} completed a draft of the script, started the storyboard process, and met with actors. Whedon also mentioned that he wrote with Downey in mind and included a [...] "brother/sister act" [...] from the comic books, later confirming that he was referring to Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch. Whedon explained his rationale for including the characters in the film saying, [...] "their powers are very visually <b>interesting.</b> <b>One</b> of the problems I had on the first one was everybody basically had punchy powers … 's got super speed. [...] can weave spells and a little telekinesis, get inside your head. There's good stuff that they can do that will help sort of keep it fresh," [...] though cautioned he was not throwing in more characters for the sake of doing that. Whedon stated that the twins allowed him to add more conflict: [...] "They don't like America, and they don't like the Avengers… The Avengers are like a world power, and not everybody's on board with the Avengers coming in and starting fights, even in the name of justice. So you need that dissenting voice, and you need to understand it and sympathize with it." [...] Because Marvel Studios shares the film rights to Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch with 20th Century Fox and had to avoid conflict with Fox's X-Men films, Whedon introduced two important characters into the Marvel Cinematic Universe completely on his terms for the first time, which allowed him to connect their origin stories to the universe that they created and avoid the concept of mutants. Whedon relished at the storytelling opportunities by introducing a character with telepathic powers, explaining, [...] "it meant we could spend a little time inside the Avengers' heads—either their past or their impressions of what's going on, or their fears, or all of the above." [...] By May, Downey had entered negotiations to extend his contract with Marvel Studios and reprise his role as Iron Man in the film. A month later, Downey signed on to return for the then-untitled Avengers sequel, as well as a third Avengers film.|$|E
