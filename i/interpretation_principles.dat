(South African and International Taxation) The term “beneficial ownership” {{was first}} {{included}} in Articles 10, 11 and 12 of the OECD’s Model Tax Convention in 1977 {{but it is}} not defined in the OECD’s Model Tax Convention and most countries do not have a definition in their domestic tax laws. There is a need for South African revenue authorities to consider how the concept of beneficial ownership will be applied in an international tax context especially with the introduction of withholding tax on dividends and the pending implementation of withholding tax on interest. A review and analysis of <b>interpretation</b> <b>principles</b> from the Vienna Convention, the OECD, selected countries and experts revealed that there are common <b>interpretation</b> <b>principles</b> which are being applied consistently when determining beneficial ownership for international tax purposes. When applied against relevant, recent international tax case law, it was interesting to note that these common <b>interpretation</b> <b>principles</b> did not consistently yield results which were in line with the courts’ judgements. The common <b>interpretation</b> <b>principles</b> represent attributes which can be used to determine beneficial ownership in international tax and could prove useful to South African revenue authorities in constructing a domestic definition for “beneficial ownership. ...|$|E

40|$|In this dissertation, I {{investigate}} the grammatical effects of focus and the inseparable phenomenon of givenness. As Schwarzschild (1999) has proposed, {{a proper understanding}} of givenness {{eliminates the need for}} a separate concept of focus, which is notoriously hard to define, either semantically, syntactically, or phonologically. I propose a semantic constraint, the Givenness <b>Interpretation</b> <b>Principle</b> based on Rooth's (1992) Focus <b>Interpretation</b> <b>Principle,</b> that accounts, in part, for the semantic effects of givenness and focus. I also propose a phonological constraint, *GIVEN, that accounts for the prosodic effects of givenness and focus in Chichewa, Japanese, Hungarian, and Italian. Givenness and focus are represented in the syntax by a functional head G which takes a given constituent in its complement and a focussed constituent in its specifier. This is demonstrably the correct representation in Hungarian, and I propose that this is the representation of givenness and focus in Universal Grammar. A phrase may raise out of the complement of G to its specifier, either overtly as in Hungarian, or covertly at LF. (cont.) Givenness has demonstrable phonological effects that, as I show, cannot be ascribed to a FOcus constraint (Truckenbrodt 1995) requiring focussed constituents to be the most prominent in their domains of focus. The constraint *GIVEN bars given constituents from being metrically prominent. Since the effects of FOcus and *GIVEN are sometimes difficult to tease apart, I present an in-depth study of the phrasal phonology of Italian, showing how phonological and intonational phrases are formed in Italian, with the aid of the segmental phenomena of raddoppiamento sintattico and gorgia toscana. Once the constraints governing these phenomena are established, I present a rigorous, controlled comparison of the effects of *GIVEN and FOcus in Italian, showing that it is *GIVEN, not FOCUS, that gives the correct results. by Christopher Bader.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{application}} of metaprogramming in logic that, unlike most metaprogramming applications, is not primarily concerned with controlling the execution of logic programs. Metalevel computation is used to define theories from schemata that were either given explicitly or obtained by abstraction from other theories. Our main application is a representation of legal knowledge in a metalogic programming language. We argue that legal knowledge is multilayered and therefore a single level representation language lacks the needed expressiveness. We show that legal rules can be partitioned into primary, secondary, tertiary, quaternary, and higher level rules. Our classification enables us to define a multilevel model of legal knowledge and a one-to-one correspondence with levels of metaprogramming in logic. We show that this framework has a potential for capturing important legal <b>interpretation</b> <b>principles</b> such as analogia legis, lex specialis Zegi generuli derogut, etc. We have a running example from commercial law that utilizes rules up to the tertiary level, emphasizing unulogiu legis.
