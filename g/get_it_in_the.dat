The TV signal passes through a system of the TNT’s regional TV stations {{as well as to}} the company’s regional partners. Those, in turn, get part of the advertising time within the framework of the content provided by the TNT. The TNT channel delivers its signal via a number of satellites staying in four different orbits, which allows its 27 television stations and more than 350 TNT’s subdivisions to <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> corresponding time zones. The TNT signal is then received and further redistributed by the local network stations broadcasting to most of the big cities as well as 5,900 smaller communities of the Russian Federation.|$|E

50|$|The usual {{aftermath}} of a fumble, {{at every level of}} play, is a pile of players, many still squirming diligently despite the whistle, surrounded by teammates pointing upfield (the hand signal for a first down) while the officials slowly extricate them in an effort to determine who has won possession. If two different players have hands on the ball, it is often a judgement call on the officials' part as to which team <b>gets</b> <b>it.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> NFL and CFL this has often been the occasion for coaches to call for a review of the instant replay.|$|R

50|$|The Buckeyes {{got off to}} a fast {{start when}} {{receiver}} Ted Ginn Jr. returned the opening kickoff 93 yards for a touchdown, giving Ohio State a 7-0 lead only 16 seconds into the game. During the celebration following the return, Ginn was injured and would miss the remainder of the game. The Gators quickly rebounded, however, leading a quick 46-yard drive for a score, capped off by a 14-yard touchdown pass from Chris Leak to Dallas Baker. After stuffing the Ohio State offense to a quick punt, Florida drove 36 yards for a touchdown on a 4-yard run by Percy Harvin. On their next possession, the Gators once again drove in for a score, going 71 yards on 10 plays and <b>getting</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> end zone on a 2-yard run by DeShawn Wynn on the first play of the second quarter.|$|R
