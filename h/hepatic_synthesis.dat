40|$|Humans are ubiquitously {{exposed to}} {{peroxisome}} proliferators including hypolipidemic agents, industrial solvents and atural products. Because {{of this and}} the fact that peroxisome proliferators cause non-genotoxic hepatocarcinogenesis in rodents, it is of importance to elucidate the mechanism of action of the peroxisome proliferators in order to provide an assessment of the hazard, if any, of these compounds to humans. It is also known that the peroxisome proliferators begin their actions by inducing <b>hepatic</b> DNA <b>synthesis.</b> Thus, the aim of this thesis was to find genes that could be responsible for triggering the induction of <b>hepatic</b> DNA <b>synthesis</b> caused by peroxisome proliferators, specifically ciprofibrate. First, it was important to indicate when the induction of <b>hepatic</b> DNA <b>synthesis</b> actually happens. This was done with BrdU immunohistochemical procedures. The induction of <b>hepatic</b> DNA <b>synthesis</b> with ciprofibrate in mice was observable only after 4 days making it difficult to specify when the induction actually happened. In rats the induction of <b>hepatic</b> DNA <b>synthesis</b> was found to peak at 24 hours and this system gave the better opportunity to find the genes responsible. The difference in the timing of induced <b>hepatic</b> DNA <b>synthesis</b> betweenmice and rats implied {{that there could be a}} species difference in the mechanism of each species’ response to PPAR. With immunohistochemistry it was noticed that there was a difference in the lobular localization of <b>hepatic</b> DNA <b>synthesis</b> in the liver tissues of rats and mice dosed with different inducers, with the rat livers exhibiting periportal distribution while <b>hepatic</b> DNA <b>synthesis</b> in the mice seemed to be distributed throughout the liver tissue. The effects of ciprofibrate or cyproterone acetate on liver gene expression in rats were studied, using cDNA microarrays, transcriptome sequencing and quantitative real- time PCR. A 1 - 5 hour treatment period was chosen to detect the immediate early gene response, while a 24 hour time point was chosen to elucidate the confounding effects from the <b>hepatic</b> DNA <b>synthesis</b> seen during the 24 hour stimulation. The results showed that ciprofibrate altered the expression of numerous genes including previously known PPARa agonist-responsive genes involved in processes such as PPAR signalling pathways, fatty acid metabolic pathway, cell cycle, palmitoyl-CoA hydrolase activity, lipid metabolism, inflammatory responses, and stress responses, in addition to a large number of novel candidate genes. Three novel induced genes G 0 s 2, Ccnd 1 and Scd 1, (and two marker genes CYP 4 A 1 and CYP 3 A 1) were confirmed with quantitative real- time PCR. The G 0 s 2, Ccnd 1 and Scd 1 were found to be up-regulated at the hours 1 and 3 after dosing and not 24 hours, and the G 0 s 2 and Scd 1 were specific for the ciprofibrate suggesting they were involved in a distinct PPARa pathway responsible for the <b>hepatic</b> DNA <b>synthesis.</b> The complete database of the transcriptional response provided here opens doors of opportunity for further research to identify genes responsible for the liver growth induced by peroxisome proliferators.

50|$|Discovered by Tillett and Francis in 1930, it was {{initially}} thought that CRP {{might be a}} pathogenic secretion since it was elevated {{in a variety of}} illnesses, including cancer. The later discovery of <b>hepatic</b> <b>synthesis</b> demonstrated that it is a native protein.|$|E
40|$|<b>Hepatic</b> {{cholesterol}} <b>synthesis</b> {{is controlled}} by both {{the size of the}} bile acid pool in the enterohepatic circulation and by the amount of cholesterol reaching the liver carried in chylomicron remnants. These studies were undertaken to examine how these two control mechanisms are interrelated. When the size of the pool was systematically varied, the logarithm of the rate of <b>hepatic</b> cholesterol <b>synthesis</b> varied in an inverse linear fashion with the size of the taurocholate pool between the limits of 0 and 60 mg of bile acid per 100 g of body weight. The slope of this relationship gave the fractional inhibition of cholesterol synthesis associated with expansion of the taurocholate pool and was critically dependent upon the amount of cholesterol available for absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Furthermore, the degree of inhibition of cholesterol synthesis in the liver seen with taurocholate feeding was reduced by partially blocking cholesterol absorption with beta-sitosterol even though the bile acid pool was still markedly expanded. In rats with diversion of the intestinal lymph from the blood, a five-fold expansion of the taurocholate pool resulted in only slight suppression of the rate of <b>hepatic</b> cholesterol <b>synthesis,</b> and even this inhibition was shown to be attributable to small amounts of cholesterol absorbed through collateral lymphatic vessels and (or) to a fasting effect. Similarly, the infusion of either taurocholate or a combination of taurocholate and taurochenate into rats with no biliary or dietary cholesterol available for absorption caused no suppression of <b>hepatic</b> cholesterol <b>synthesis.</b> Finally, the effect of changes in the rate of bile acid snythesis on <b>hepatic</b> cholesterol <b>synthesis</b> was examined. The fractional inhibition of cholesterol synthesis found after administration of an amount of cholesterol sufficient to raise the hepatic cholesterol ester content by 1 mg/g equalled only [...] 0. 36 when bile acid snythesis was increased by biliary diversion but was [...] 0. 92 when bile acid synthesis was suppressed by bile acid feeding. It is concluded that (a) bile acids are not direct effectors of the rate of <b>hepatic</b> cholesterol <b>synthesis,</b> (b) most of the inhibitory activity seen with bile acid feeding is mediated through increased cholesterol absorption, and (c) bile acids do have an intrahepatic effect in that they regulate <b>hepatic</b> cholesterol <b>synthesis</b> indirectly by altering the flow of cellular cholesterol to bile acids...|$|R
40|$|A {{synthetic}} fat-free diet, previously {{shown to}} decrease <b>hepatic</b> cholesterol <b>synthesis,</b> was utilized to manipulate cholesterol balance in vivo in female Sprague-Dawley rats. A significant 65 % decrease of <b>hepatic</b> cholesterol <b>synthesis</b> {{compared to controls}} was shown after 1 week of treatment, which remained constant during the following 3 weeks. The inhibitory effect of the diet was completely abolished by cholestyramine supplementation. At week 3 of the experimental diet, bile acid synthesis was reduced by 63 %, this reduction being correlated with decreased recycling frequency of the bile acid pool. Hepatic clearance of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) was slightly decreased, with no changes in plasma cholesterol, hepatic LDL-cholesterol uptake and whole body LDL-cholesterol production. When cholesterol and saturated fatty acids were supplemented to the diets {{in the attempt to}} disclose alteration in LDL transport, LDL clearance was unaffected; plasma LDL-cholesterol and hepatic LDL-cholesterol uptake were increased, as a consequence of increased LDL-cholesterol production. On the other hand, <b>hepatic</b> cholesterol <b>synthesis</b> was further suppressed; bile acid synthesis was increased by cholesterol supplementation in the fat-free group, even if to subnormal levels. These findings suggest that: (1) bile acid synthesis is decreased by feeding a synthetic fat-free diet, probably due to slower recirculation of bile acids along the entero-hepatic axis in conditions of reduced functional need; (2) consequently, a significant reduction of <b>hepatic</b> cholesterol <b>synthesis</b> is observed with no changes in LDL-cholesterol uptake; (3) further supplementation of dietary cholesterol and saturated fats is compensated for by changes in the rates of cholesterol and bile acid synthesis, but not of LDL transport.

The effects of tube-feeding the diets or dietary components for days, hours, or minutes on hepatic polyribosomes and protein synthesis are described. Force-feeding a purified diet free of single essential amino acids induces within days morphologic changes resembling those that occur in humans with kwashiorkor, a world-wide nutritional deficiency disease in children. In this kwashiorkor-like model, <b>hepatic</b> protein <b>synthesis</b> and polyribosomal aggregation are increased. Administration of a complete amino acid mixture or tryptophan alone, but no other single amino acid, produces a rapid stimulation (within minutes) of <b>hepatic</b> protein <b>synthesis</b> and polyribosomal aggregation in animals that had been fasted, fed, or treated with hepatotoxic agents.

40|$|Abstract Regulatory {{mechanisms}} of <b>hepatic</b> apolipoprotein <b>synthesis</b> were studied {{in groups of}} male Sprague-Dawley rats made severely hypolipidemic by treatment with pharmacological doses of l 7 a-ethinyl estradiol. Treatment resulted in a marked reduction of plasma cholesterol and apolipoproteins B, A-I, and A-IV. Hepatic apoA-I mRNA and apoA-I synthesis were increased in the ethinyl estradiol-treated animals. <b>Hepatic</b> apoA-IV protein <b>synthesis</b> rates were unaltered; however, a reduction of the apd-IV mRNA level was observed. Diet-control studies suggested the effects of l 7 a-ethinyl estradiol on apoA-I, unlike those on apnA-IV, appeared {{to be related to}} the steroid and not to reduced caloric intake. Livers of control and ethinyl estradioltreated rats synthesized both apOBH and apoBL. Total hepatic apoB (apoBL plus apOBH) synthesis and apoB mRNA levels in the ethinyl estradiol-treated rats were similar to ad libitum fed or diet-controls. In ad libitum fed and diet-control rats, 21 % and 32 %, respectively, of newly synthesized hepatic apoB was apOBH. In contrast, 47 % of the newly synthesized apoB in the ethinyl estradiol-treated animal was apOBH. Nucleotide sequence analysis of hepatic apoB mRNA confirmed a marked decrease in the proportion of the apoBL mRNA in ethinyl estradioltreated animals. After cessation of 17 a-ethinyl estradiol treatment, the <b>hepatic</b> apolipoprotein A-I <b>synthesis</b> rate, apolipoprotein A-I and A-IV mRNA levels, and the apoBH and apoBL synthesis rates, as well as plasma apolipoprotein and cholesterol levels, returned to normal.

5000|$|The initial {{step in the}} {{classical}} pathway of <b>hepatic</b> <b>synthesis</b> of bile acids is the enzymatic addition of a 7α hydroxyl group by cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) forming 7α-hydroxycholesterol. This is then metabolised to 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one. There are multiple steps in bile acid synthesis requiring 14 enzymes in all. These result in the junction between the first two steroid rings (A and B) being altered, making the molecule bent; in this process, the 3-hydroxyl is converted to the α orientation. The simplest 24-carbon bile acid has two hydroxyl groups at positions 3α and 7α. This is 3α,7α-dihydroxy-5β-cholan-24-oic acid, or, as more usually known, chenodeoxycholic acid. This bile acid was first isolated from the domestic goose, from which the [...] "cheno" [...] portion of the name was derived. The 5β in the name denotes {{the orientation of the}} junction between rings A and B of the steroid nucleus (in this case, they are bent).

Human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG 2) were cultured in medium supplemented with stable isotopes 1, 2 - 13 C 2 -glycine and L-[ring- 13 C 6]phenylalanine. ER stress was induced by exposing the cells to 100 nM of thapsigargin (TG). Cell content was collected from day 0 to 14. Alterations in cytosolic calcium were measured by calcium imaging and ER stress markers were confirmed by Western blotting.

40|$|This review {{identifies}} the various pathways responsible for modulating <b>hepatic</b> protein <b>synthesis</b> following acute and chronic alcohol intoxication and describes the mechanism(s) {{responsible for these}} changes. Alcohol intoxication induces a defect in global protein synthetic rates that is localized to impaired translation of mRNA {{at the level of}} peptide-chain initiation. Translation initiation is regulated at two steps: formation of the 43 S preinitiation complex [controlled by eukaryotic initiation factors 2 (eIF 2) and 2 B (eIF 2 B) ] and the binding of mRNA to the 40 S ribosome (controlled by the eIF 4 F complex). To date, alcohol-induced alterations in eIF 2 and eIF 2 B content and activity are best investigated. Ethanol decreases eIF 2 B activity when ingested either acutely or chronically. The reduced eIF 2 B activity most likely is a consequence of twofold increased phosphorylation of the α-subunit of eIF 2 on Ser 51 following acute intoxication. The increase in eIF 2 α phosphorylation after chronic alcohol consumption is the same as that induced by acute ethanol intoxication, and protein synthesis is not further reduced by long-term alcohol ingestion despite additional reduced expression of initiation factors and elongation factors. eIF 2 α phosphorylation alone appears sufficient to maximally inhibit <b>hepatic</b> protein <b>synthesis.</b> Indeed, pretreatment with Salubrinal, an inhibitor of eIF 2 α(P) phosphatase, before ethanol treatment does not further inhibit protein synthesis or increase eIF 2 α phosphorylation, suggesting that acute ethanol intoxication causes maximal eIF 2 α phosphorylation elevation and <b>hepatic</b> protein <b>synthesis</b> inhibition. Ethanol-induced inhibition of <b>hepatic</b> protein <b>synthesis</b> is not rapidly reversed by cessation of ethanol consumption. In conclusion, sustained eIF 2 α phosphorylation is a hallmark of excessive alcohol intake leading to inhibition of protein synthesis.

In the presence of hyperglycemia (10. 4 +/- 0. 1 mM) and basal portal vein insulinemia (192 +/- 6 pM), suppression of glucagon secretion (plasma glucagon, I: 31 +/- 4, II: 63 +/- 8 pg/ml) doubled the hepatic accumulation of glycogen (Vsyn) compared with conditions of basal glucagonemia [I: 0. 40 +/- 0. 06, II: 0. 19 +/- 0. 03 mumol/(liter. min) : P < 0. 0025]. Glycogen turnover was markedly reduced (I: 19 +/- 7 %, II: 69 +/- 12 %; P < 0. 005), so that net rate of glycogen synthesis increased approximately fivefold (P < 0. 001) by inhibition of glucagon secretion. The relative contribution of gluconeogenesis (indirect pathway) to glycogen synthesis was lower during hypoglucagonemia (42 +/- 6 %) than during basal glucagonemia (54 +/- 5 %; P < 0. 005). Under conditions of basal peripheral insulinemia (54 +/- 2 pM) and hypoglucagonemia (III) there was negligible <b>hepatic</b> glycogen <b>synthesis</b> and turnover. In conclusion, small changes in portal vein concentrations of insulin and glucagon independently affect <b>hepatic</b> glycogen <b>synthesis</b> and turnover. Inhibition of glucagon secretion under conditions of hyperglycemia and basal concentrations of insulin results in: (a) twofold increase in rate of <b>hepatic</b> glycogen <b>synthesis,</b> (b) reduction of glycogen turnover by approximately 73 %, and (c) augmented percent contribution of the direct pathway to glycogen synthesis compared with conditions of basal glucagonemia...|$|R
40|$|The liver {{is a major}} site in the rat for {{conversion}} of dietary carbohydrate into glycogen and triglyceride. Hepatic rates of fatty acid and glycogen synthesis were measured y vivo in response to meal-feeding (2 h/day) by the incorporation of from 3 H 20. This technique has not been applied previously to glycogen synthesis and was validated in control and streptozotocin diabetic rats* Hepatic glycogen recycling was low in fed adult rats but was apparently greater in foetal rats. The precursor source for glycogen synthesis in vivo could not be determined from the distribution pattern of 3 H incorporation. <b>Hepatic</b> glycogen <b>synthesis</b> was elevated in control rats for 5 h after feeding. During this phase, glycogen {{could not have been}} a net precursor for other synthetic pathways® <b>Hepatic</b> fatty acid <b>synthesis</b> in control rats increased 20 -fold 2 h after feeding. This response was impaired and delayed, but not abolished, by streptozotocin diabetes (55 mg/kg). Insulin pretreatment (30 P. Z. I.) restored the low diabetic rate of lipogenesis to normal by 8 h after feeding. Streptozotocin reduced the hepatic Vmax activities of glucokinase, ATP-citrate lyase and total acetyl CoA carboxylase. None of these enzyme activities increased when <b>hepatic</b> fatty acid <b>synthesis</b> was stimulated by feeding in control rats or by feeding and insulin in diabetic rats. Feeding stimulated active acetyl CoA carboxylase in control, but not diabetic, rats. The regulation of <b>hepatic</b> fatty acid <b>synthesis</b> by both acetyl CoA carboxylase and increased substrate concentration is discussed. In control rats for the first 5 h after feeding, hepatic glycogen could not have been a net fatty acid precursor. Thus the inhibition of <b>hepatic</b> fatty acid <b>synthesis</b> in this period by glucagon (Img/kg) could not have been directly due to depletion of glycogen® The glucagon inhibition of lipogenesis was abolished by adrenalectomy but not potentiated by corticotropin-treatment, suggesting a permissive role for glucocorticoid hormones. Adrenalectomy also impaired the inhibition of hepatic pyruvate kinase by glucagon but did not abolish the inactivation of pyruvate kinase by 10) jM-cyclic AMP in vitro« The involvement of L-type pyruvate kinase in the regulation of <b>hepatic</b> fatty acid <b>synthesis</b> is discussed. The integrated regulation of the hepatic pathways of lipogenesis, glycolysis, gluconeogenesis and ketogenesis is considered...|$|R
