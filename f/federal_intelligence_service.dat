In 1966, Merex, represented by Walter Drück, a former Generalmajor in the Wehrmacht and BND agent, helped by the contacts established by Rudel and Sassen, sold discarded equipment of the Bundeswehr (German Federal armed forces) to various dictators in Latin America. According to Hammerschmidt, Rudel assisted in establishing contact between Merex and Friedrich Schwend, {{a former member of the}} Reich Main Security Office and involved in Operation Bernhard. Schwend, according to Hammerschmidt, had close links with the military services of Peru and Bolivia. In the early sixties, Rudel, Schwend and Klaus Barbie, founded a company called [...] "La Estrella", the star, which employed a number of former SS officers who had fled to Latin America. Rudel, through La Estrella, was also in contact with Otto Skorzeny, who had his own network of former SS and Wehrmacht officers.|$|E

40|$|Status and {{activities}} of the <b>intelligence</b> <b>services</b> in the Czech Republic (legal aspects) My master's degree thesis attempts to analyse the status {{and activities}} of the <b>intelligence</b> <b>services</b> in the Czech Republic. Nowadays {{the importance of the}} <b>intelligence</b> <b>services</b> is steadily growing worldwide because of bigger threat of terrorists' attacks and worsening security situation in certain regions in the world. Czech <b>intelligence</b> <b>services</b> must adapt to this situation and that's why I started to investigate particular Czech legislation. I started to examine whether the Czech <b>intelligence</b> <b>services</b> are given necessary powers to fulfil their lawful duties, who governs and coordinates their activities, who controls them etc. All these questions are described and answered in the thesis. The thesis is composed of five chapters, each of them deals with different aspects of the status {{and activities of}} the <b>intelligence</b> <b>services.</b> Chapter one is more or less general, subsequent chapters are rather focused on Czech <b>intelligence</b> <b>services.</b> The first chapter is introductory.
