50|$|Geertruida Luberta de Haas-Lorentz (20 November 1885, in Leiden - 1973) was {{a female}} Dutch {{physicist}} {{and the first to}} perform <b>fluctuational</b> <b>analysis</b> of electrons as Brownian particles. Consequently she is considered to be the first woman in electrical noise theory. She was the eldest daughter of the physicist Hendrik Lorentz and Aletta Catharina Kaiser. In 1910, she married the physicist Wander Johannes de Haas and they had two sons and two daughters.|$|E
40|$|The {{field of}} {{computer-aided}} diagnosis has recently made {{progress in the}} diagnosing of Alzheimer's disease (AD) from magnetic resonance images (MRI) of the brain. Lahmiri and Boukadoum (2013) have research this topic since 2011, and in 2013 they presented a system for automatic detection of AD based on machine learning classification. Their proposed system achieved a classification accuracy of 100 % (2013, p. 1507) using support vector machines with quadratic kernel classifiers. The MRI scans were first translated to 1 -dimensional signals, from which three features were extracted to measure the signals self-affinity. These three features were Hurst’s exponent, the total fluctuation energy of a detrended <b>fluctuational</b> <b>analysis</b> and the same analysis’ scaling exponent. The results of their study were validated using a dataset of 23 MRI scans from brains with AD and normal brains. This report makes an attempt at implementing the method proposed by Lahmiri and Boukadoum in 2013 and evaluating its accuracy on a dataset of 120 cases, out of which 60 are cases of AD and 60 are normal cases. The results were validated using both leave-one-out cross-validation and 3 -fold cross-validation. A dataset of 23 cases consistent with Lahmiri and Boukadoum’s in size was considered and the larger dataset of 120 cases. The best classification accuracy for the small and large {{were obtained from the}} 3 -fold cross-validation was 78, 26 % respectively 65, 00 %. The results of this study are to some extent similar to those of Lahmiri and Boukadoum’s, however this study fails to verify how their method performs on a larger dataset, as their results for a small dataset could not be reproduced in this implementation. Thus the results of this report are inconclusive in verifying the accuracy of the implemented method for a larger dataset. However this implementation of the method shows promise as the accuracy for the large dataset was fairly good when comparing to other research done in the field. ...|$|E
30|$|The {{analysis}} of metastability {{has a long}} history [70], particularly within the context of SDEs with weak noise. The underlying idea is that the mean rate to transition from a metastable state in the weak noise limit can be identified with the principal eigenvalue of the generator of the underlying stochastic process, which is a second-order differential operator {{in the case of a}} Fokker–Planck equation. Calculating the eigenvalue typically involves obtaining a Wentzel–Kramers–Brillouin (WKB) approximation of a quasistationary solution and then using singular perturbation theory to match the solution to an absorbing boundary condition [69, 97, 99, 103, 130]. The latter is defined on the boundary that marks the region beyond which the system rapidly relaxes to another metastable state, becomes extinct, or escapes to infinity. In one-dimensional systems (d= 1), this boundary is simply an unstable fixed point, whereas in higher-dimensions (d> 1), it is generically a (d- 1)-submanifold. In the weak noise limit, the most likely paths of escape through an absorbing boundary are rare events, occurring in the tails of the associated functional probability distribution. From a mathematical perspective, the rigorous {{analysis of}} the tails of a distribution is known as large deviation theory [39, 53, 55, 138], which provides a rigorous probabilistic framework for interpreting the WKB solution in terms of optimal <b>fluctuational</b> paths. The <b>analysis</b> of metastability in chemical master equations has been developed along analogous lines to SDEs, combining WKB methods and large deviation principles[43, 45, 49, 53, 69, 75, 85, 124] with path-integral or operator methods [40, 41, 121, 128, 143]. The study of metastability in stochastic hybrid systems is more recent, and much of the theory has been developed in a series of papers on stochastic ion channels [25, 109, 114, 115], gene networks [108, 110], and stochastic neural networks [24]. Again there is a strong connection between WKB methods, large deviation principles [15, 51, 84], and formal path-integral methods [11, 26], although the connection is now more subtle.|$|R
