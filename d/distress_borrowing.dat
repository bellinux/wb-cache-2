40|$|We {{model the}} {{entrepreneurial}} firm's choice of debt finance, allowing for debt renegotiations {{in the event}} of financial distress. We differentiate two sources of debt finance, bank debt and trade credit, by the implicit equity stake that lenders hold in the borrowing firm. Lenders with a large implicit equity stake, such as suppliers, may adopt a more lenient liquidation policy for their debtors, but then set a higher price for their credit. Entrepreneurs, who have private information about their probability of financial <b>distress,</b> <b>borrow</b> exclusively from lenders with a small implicit equity stake, such as banks, only when the price advantage of bank debt outweighs the cost of a stricter enforcement of liquidation rights. Entrepreneurs who prefer the lenient liquidation policy adopted by suppliers contract only partial bank finance in order to avoid a potential default against the bank later on. We show that the fraction of debt that consists of bank loans depends upon the cash flow in the bad state, the value attributed to control rights and the initial wealth and risk aversion of the entrepreneur.

50|$|Webster first {{borrowed}} $400 from Parkman in 1842. In 1847, {{with little}} of this repaid, he gave Parkman a note for $2432, which represented the unpaid balance and a further loan. This was secured by a mortgage of Webster’s personal property, including a cabinet of minerals. In 1848, still in <b>distress,</b> he <b>borrowed</b> $1200 from Robert G. Shaw, making over to him as collateral the minerals that already stood as collateral for a Parkman loan. This enraged Parkman and caused him to seek out Webster for a confrontation.|$|R

We also test {{hypotheses about}} borrowing from a single bank versus multiple banks. Our results suggest that large and foreign-owned institutions may have difficulty extending relationship loans to opaque small firms.

60|$|It {{was because}} I felt this that Dirk Stroeve {{was not to}} me, as to others, merely an object of ridicule. His fellow-painters {{made no secret of}} their {{contempt}} for his work, but he earned a fair amount of money, and they did not hesitate to make free use of his purse. He was generous, and the needy, laughing at him because he believed so naively their stories of <b>distress,</b> <b>borrowed</b> from him with effrontery. He was very emotional, yet his feeling, so easily aroused, had in it something absurd, so that you accepted his kindness, but felt no gratitude. To take money from him was like robbing a child, and you despised him because he was so foolish. I imagine that a pickpocket, proud of his light fingers, must feel a sort of indignation with the careless woman who leaves in a cab a vanity-bag with all her jewels in it. Nature had made him a butt, but had denied him insensibility. He writhed under the jokes, practical and otherwise, which were perpetually made at his expense, and yet never ceased, it seemed wilfully, to expose himself to them. He was constantly wounded, and yet his good-nature was such that he could not bear malice: the viper might sting him, but he never learned by experience, and had no sooner recovered from his pain than he tenderly placed it once more in his bosom. His life was a tragedy written in the terms of knockabout farce. Because I did not laugh at him he was grateful to me, and he used to pour into my sympathetic ear the long list of his troubles. The saddest thing about them was that they were grotesque, and the more pathetic they were, the more you wanted to laugh.|$|R
40|$|Consolidation of {{the banking}} {{industry}} is shifting assets into larger institutions that often operate in many nations. Large international financial institutions are geared toward serving large wholesale customers. How does this affect the banking system's ability to lend to informationally opaque small businesses? The authors test hypotheses {{about the effects of}} bank size, foreign ownership, and distress on lending to informationally opaque small firms, using a rich new data set on Argentinean banks, firms, and loans. They also test hypotheses about borrowing from a single bank versus borrowing from several banks. Their results suggest that large and foreign-owned institutions may have difficulty extending relationship loans to opaque small firms, especially if small businesses are delinquent in repaying their loans. Bank distress resulting from lax prudential supervision and regulation appears to have no greater effect on small borrowers than on large borrowers, although even small firms may react to bank <b>distress</b> by <b>borrowing</b> from multiple banks, despite raising borrowing costs and destroying some of the benefits of exclusive lending relationships.

40|$|We {{examine the}} firm-level and country-level {{determinants}} {{of the currency}} denomination of small business loans. We introduce an information asymmetry between banks and firms in a model that also features the trade-off between the cost of debt and firm-level distress costs. Banks in our model don’t know the currency in which firms have contracted their sales. When foreign currency funds come at a lower interest rate, all foreign currency earners and those local currency earners with low distress costs choose foreign currency loans. With imperfect information in the model concerning the currency in which the firms receive their earnings, even more local earners switch to foreign currency loans as they do not bear {{the full cost of}} the corresponding credit risk. We test these implications of our model by using a 2005 survey with responses from 9, 655 firms in 26 transition countries that contains reports on 3, 105 recent bank loans. We find that firms with foreign currency earnings and lower <b>distress</b> costs <b>borrow</b> more in foreign currency, while opaque firms do not. Interest rate advantages on foreign currency funds do explain differences in loan dollarization across countries, but not within countries ove...|$|R
25|$|The Constitutional Protection War {{continued}} through 1918. Many in Sun Yat-sen's Guangzhou government felt {{his position as}} the Generalissimo was too exclusionary and promoted a cabinet system to challenge Sun's ultimate authority. As a result, the Guangzhou government was reorganized to elect a seven-member cabinet system, known as the Governing Committee. Sun was once again sidelined by his political opponents and military strongmen. He left for Shanghai following the reorganization. Duan Qirui's Beijing government did not fare much better than Sun's. Some generals in Duan's Anhui Clique {{and others in the}} Zhili clique did not want to use force to unify the southern provinces. They felt negotiation was the solution to unify China and forced Duan to resign in October. In addition, many were <b>distressed</b> by Duan's <b>borrowing</b> of huge sums of Japanese money to fund his army to fight internal enemies.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we examine {{a model of}} the optimal {{financial}} claim for a bank in a world where a borrowing firm’s uninformed stakeholders depend upon the bank for truthful information about the firm’s evolving financial condition. In particular, stakeholders rely upon the bank to reveal whether the borrowing firm is truly financially distressed and whether concession by stakeholders are necessary. The bank’s financial claim is designed to ensure that it cannot form a coalition with the firm’s owners either to seek unnecessary concession when the firm is actually healthy, or to claim that the firm is healthy when it is actually in distress. We show that the optimal chain has the following characteristics. To ensure that a healthy firm/bank coalition will not form to seek unnecessary concessions from stakeholders, the bank must keep its equity stake in a distressed firm below a ceiling level. To ensure that a distressed firm/bank coalition will not falsely claim that the firm is healthy, a sufficiently large portion of the bank’s financial claim on the healthy firm must be subordinated to stakeholders’ claims. Since banks may have difficulty in credibly subordinating their debt claims, a bank equity stake in the healthy firm may be necessary. Thus, our analysis offers limited support for the argument that bank equity stakes in borrowing firms may enhance banks’ ability to reduce the costs of financial <b>distress</b> for <b>borrowing</b> firms. ...|$|R
40|$|Rural {{households}} in Nigeria {{are vulnerable to}} shock becauseof their limited capacity to make informed decision onsecured coping strategies which is further aggravated by somehouseholds’ specific socio-economic characteristics. Attemptswere made to identify shocks being faced by households’ headsand coping strategies. Multistage sampling technique was usedto select 80 respondents and well structured questionnaire wasused to collect data through in-depth interview. Data wereanalysed using descriptive statistics to describe households’ socio-economic variables; Probit analysis was also used to determinethe relationship between personal socio-economic characteristicsof the respondents, shocks and choice of coping actions. Theresults revealed that {{a large share of}} households experiencemultidimensional shocks, which are mainly associated toecological but also suffer from other economic, demographicand social factors. Majority of households undertake copingactions in response to shocks; coping strategies employed butnot limited to include <b>borrowing,</b> <b>distress</b> sales of assets,remittances, adjustment in food intake, drawing on savings. Educational status, household size, per capita income, shocks type,coping strategies, among others are found to significantly affectthe choice of coping actions and are likely to have implicationsfor households’ future welfare status...|$|R
60|$|In {{addition}} to these repeated instances of a rash and inflexible temper, Dr. King also adds faults alleged {{to belong to the}} prince's character, of a kind less consonant with his noble birth and high pretensions. He is said by this author to have been avaricious, or parsimonious at least, to such a degree of meanness, as to fail, even when he had ample means, in relieving the sufferers who had lost their fortune, and sacrificed all in his ill-fated attempt. [The approach is thus expressed by Dr. King, who brings the charge:--'But the most odious part of his character is his love of money, a vice which I do not remember to have been imputed by our historians to any of his ancestors, and is the certain index of a base and little mind. I know it may be urged in his vindication, that a prince in exile ought to be an economist. And so he ought; but, nevertheless, his purse should be always open {{as long as there is}} anything in it, to relieve the necessities of his friends and adherents. King Charles II, during his banishment, would have shared the last pistole in his pocket with his little family. But I have known this gentleman, with two thousand louis-d'ors in his strong-box, pretend he was in great <b>distress,</b> and <b>borrow</b> money from a lady in Paris who was not in affluent circumstances. His most faithful servants, who had closely attended him in all his difficulties, were ill rewarded.'--King's MEMOIRS.] We must receive, however, with some degree of jealousy what is said by Dr. King on this subject, recollecting that he had left at least, if he did not desert, the standard of the unfortunate prince, and was not therefore a person who was likely to form the fairest estimate of his virtues and faults. We must also remember that if the exiled prince gave little, he had but little to give, especially considering how late he nourished the scheme of another expedition to Scotland, for which he was long endeavouring to hoard money.|$|R
