In response, the Australian Army also established a project to acquire CH-47F Chinooks to replace its CH-47Ds in the mid-2000s. The Australian Government provided initial approval for a CH-47F purchase in September 2007. As part of this decision, the Government chose to procure the helicopters through the US Government's Foreign Military Sales program to minimise potential risks to the schedule and cost of the project.|$|E
