40|$|Abstract Flake and {{spheroidal}} <b>graphite</b> cast <b>irons</b> {{with similar}} composition {{were subjected to}} high temperature oxidation to investigate graphite morphology and distribution effects on the oxidation behavior. High temperature oxidation tests were conducted between 400 and 750 C in air. For comparison low carbon steel was also tested. Graphite morphology obviously affected high-temperature oxidation resis-tance. The flake <b>graphite</b> cast <b>iron</b> exhibited the worst high-temperature oxidation resistance compared with spheroidal <b>graphite</b> cast <b>iron.</b> Since <b>graphite</b> flakes provide suitable sites for the iron oxide growth and are almost interconnected, the iron oxide grows faster and penetrates along the graphite flakes boundaries resulting in the subsurface oxidation. Due to the severe subsurface oxidation flake <b>graphite</b> cast <b>iron</b> parabolic rate constants are five times {{higher than that of}} the spheroidal <b>graphite</b> cast <b>iron.</b> However, spheroidal <b>graphite</b> cast <b>iron</b> parabolic rate constants and oxide layer thickness {{are similar to those of}} the low carbon steel.

40|$|Abstract- This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the investigation of the effect of magnesium to sulfur ratio on the graphite morphology and estimation of the ranges of this ratio use to produce <b>graphite</b> cast <b>iron</b> at different section sections. The main factors affecting shape of <b>graphite</b> cast <b>iron</b> are the metallurgical structures and the section thicknesses. Cast iron of different shapes of graphite particles directly affect its thermo-mechanical properties. The nodular shape of these graphite particles such as in ductile cast iron improve its mechanical properties, on the other hand, when the shape of these graphite particles become elongated such as in flake <b>graphite</b> cast <b>iron</b> results in improving its thermal conductivity. In between, the worm-like shape of these graphite particles such as in compacted <b>graphite</b> cast <b>iron,</b> make this type of cast iron to have thermo-mechanical properties in between those of ductile and flake <b>graphite</b> cast <b>iron.</b> The different types of ductile, compacted and flake <b>graphite</b> cast <b>iron</b> were produced by means of plunger method at different section thicknesses and the effect of Mg/S ratio on these types of graphite particles was investigated and its range was established...|$|R

40|$|A new surface {{hardening}} technology for cast irons {{was developed by}} applying the Friction Stir Processing (FSP) in which the matrix can be controlled in the solid state. Flake <b>graphite</b> cast <b>iron</b> (FC 300) and spheroidal <b>graphite</b> cast <b>iron</b> (FCD 700) were used to investigate the validity of this new method. As a result, it has been clarified that a Vickers hardness of about 700 HV is obtained for both the flake <b>graphite</b> cast <b>iron</b> and the spheroidal <b>graphite</b> cast <b>iron,</b> and that the hardness depends on the size and {{the density of the}} martensite phase. Moreover, the hardness can be controlled down to about 500 HV by changing the stirring degree. For previous hardening methods, post surface-processing was required because a large distortion was generated. However, with this new method, many advantages, such as a higher surface hardness and unnecessary post surface-processing, could be obtained. [doi: 10. 2320 /matertrans. F-MRA 2008835...|$|R

The tests are performed as in cast iron condition as well after austempering.

Nanosized additives of titanium carbonitride and titanium nitride TiCN+TiN influence on the graphite phase characteristics and on the microstructure of the cast and austempered spheroidal <b>graphite</b> <b>irons.</b> The changes in the micro structure the irons with nanoadditives lead to an abrasive wear resistance increase.

40|$|Spheroidal <b>graphite</b> cast <b>irons</b> {{are widely}} used for auto parts because they have large degrees of freedom in shape and are inexpensive. When they are welded, however, they show serious {{drawback}} of crack generation due to excess carbon at thehardened region of heat-affected zone. We have studied on decarburized spheroidal <b>graphite</b> cast <b>iron</b> which has a possibility of welding because of graphite free in the surface region. In the present study, some characteristics of the decarburized layer in the spheroidal <b>graphite</b> cast <b>iron</b> were investigated. The results obtained are as follows. Growth of decarburized layer is controlled by diffusion of carbon atoms toward the surface region in the iron during the heat-treatment {{and there is a}} critical temperature of 930 K for the decarburization, below which decarburization does not occur. When the area ratios of the decarburized layer to whole sectional area in the rod-shaped tensile test specimen was defined to be a ratio of decarburized layer, the tensile strength of the specimen scarcely influenced by the ratio of decarburized layer. However, when the overdecarburization was processed, the tensile strength showed a tendency to decrease. Therefore, it should be noted in practical use of the decarburized spheroidal <b>graphite</b> cast <b>iron</b> that the excessive decarburization makes the strength of thin parts of the iron to decrease...|$|R
