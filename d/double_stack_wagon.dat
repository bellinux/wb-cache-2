30|$|It {{is known}} that solar cells with <b>double</b> <b>stack</b> antireflection coating have better {{efficiency}} than those with single-layer ARC. The same results are obtained in our experiments. The solar cell with a 60 -nm/ 20 -nm SiNX:H <b>double</b> <b>stack</b> antireflection coating has 17.8 % efficiency, while that with an 80 -nm SiNX:H single-layer antireflection coating has 17.2 % efficiency. The improvement of the efficiency {{is due to the}} effect of better passivation and better antireflection of the <b>double</b> <b>stack</b> antireflection coating. However, studies on the stability against outside environment for <b>double</b> <b>stack</b> ARC are seldom conducted.|$|R

30|$|The <b>double</b> <b>stack</b> {{film has}} a {{lifetime}} of 50 μs, which is not worse compared with other thin films. The lifetime of the film with a refractive index of 2.0 decreases from 66 μs to 54 μs after 50 h of UV exposure. Its decay rate is 18.2 %. The lifetime of the <b>double</b> <b>stack</b> film decreases by 13.1 % from 50 μs to 44 μs. For other thin films with refractive indices from 1.9 to approximately 2.3, the average lifetime decay rate is 18.7 %, which {{is higher than the}} <b>double</b> <b>stack</b> film by more than 5 %. This proves that the solar cells with <b>double</b> <b>stack</b> antireflection film are stable against UV light.|$|R

50|$|<b>Double</b> <b>stack</b> {{requires}} a higher clearance above the tracks, or structure gauge, than do {{other forms of}} rail freight. Double-stack cars are most common in North America where intermodal traffic is heavy and electrification is less widespread; thus overhead clearances are typically more manageable. Nonetheless, North American railroads have invested large sums to raise bridges and tunnel clearances along their routes and remove other obstacles to allow greater use of <b>double</b> <b>stack</b> trains and to give them more direct routes.|$|R
30|$|The {{effects of}} temperature, humidity, and UV {{exposure}} on the SiNX:H thin films with different gas ratios were investigated, and {{the stability of}} the <b>double</b> <b>stack</b> antireflection coating thin film was examined. First, single-layer antireflection coatings were studied to establish the deposition conditions, and the results were applied to the <b>double</b> <b>stack</b> antireflection coating. The passivation of the thin films with various refractive indices was also studied. After the temperature and humidity test for 100 h, the carrier lifetime of the thin film decreased by 7.5 %. The lifetime decreased by 13.1 % after the UV exposure test. These are better results than those obtained for the average of single layers, 8.9 % after the heat and damp test and 18.72 % after UV exposure. The stability of <b>double</b> <b>stack</b> antireflection coatings has been experimentally confirmed.|$|R
30|$|<b>Double</b> <b>stack</b> antireflection {{coatings}} {{have significant}} advantages over single-layer antireflection coatings {{due to their}} broad-range coverage of the solar spectrum. A solar cell with 60 -nm/ 20 -nm SiNX:H <b>double</b> <b>stack</b> coatings has 17.8 % efficiency, while that with a 80 -nm SiNX:H single coating has 17.2 % efficiency. The improvement of the efficiency {{is due to the}} effect of better passivation and better antireflection of the <b>double</b> <b>stack</b> antireflection coating. It is important that SiNX:H films have strong resistance against stress factors since they are used as antireflective coating for solar cells. However, the tolerance of SiNX:H films to external stresses has never been studied. In this paper, the stability of SiNX:H films prepared by a plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition system is studied. The stability tests are conducted using various forms of stress, such as prolonged thermal cycle, humidity, and UV exposure. The heat and damp test was conducted for 100 h, maintaining humidity at 85 % and applying thermal cycles of rapidly changing temperatures from - 20 °C to 85 °C over 5 h. UV exposure was conducted for 50 h using a 180 -W UV lamp. This confirmed that the <b>double</b> <b>stack</b> antireflection coating is stable against external stress.|$|R

50|$|The $40 million {{facility}} Is {{also used}} for filet-toupee operations, converting <b>double</b> <b>stack</b> container trains from the west to single stack by removing {{the top layer of}} containers.

The removed containers are trucked to local destinations. Toupee refers to the reverse process, where a single stack train coming from the east has additional containers placed on top for the rest of its trip.Some 300 trucks a day visit the site.

5000|$|Until the 2007 project, {{the tunnel}} {{had been a}} choke point for the {{movement}} of modern autoracks and <b>double</b> <b>stack</b> containers {{into and out of}} Vermont. The 2007 project lowered the trackage to accommodate [...] "Modified <b>double</b> <b>stack</b> containers" [...] through the tunnel, utilizing a modified design build management process to expedite the tunnel work in an efficient, cost effective, and timely manner. On Saturday, August 18 at 4:00 a.m., rail traffic on the eastern side of Vermont was shut down for three days so that the lowering of the track could occur. Crews worked 24 hours each day until the work was completed. A test train ran over the track on Monday August 20. Approximately 750 cubic yards of material was excavated from within the tunnel. Trackage was dropped about 3 feet while the lower tunnel foundation was installed with steel walls and struts in order to enable future track lowering (for full <b>double</b> <b>stack</b> clearance) without necessity of additional foundation underpinning (after the railroad adjusts the elevation of their Canal Bridge).|$|R
