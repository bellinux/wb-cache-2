25|$|On 17 September 2012, {{malfunctions}} {{were detected}} during trials. According to official report, {{seven out of}} eight steam boilers of the propulsion machinery were out of order. Due to this, the deadline of the hand over this ship to the Indian Navy was postponed again until October 2013. Later investigation has determined that the cause for the engine failure was due to poor workmanship and supervision. The Gorshkov and other ships of the 1143.4 class {{had a history of}} multiple boiler failures, however Russian shipbuilders claimed that the source of the problem was the low-grade Chinese-made <b>fire-bricks</b> that were used in the boiler insulation instead of asbestos.|$|R
6000|$|It was {{not only}} the unsparing unapologetic ugliness and the rigid {{straightness}} which overwhelmed her. It was the planlessness, the flimsy temporariness of the buildings, their faded unpleasant colors. The street was cluttered with electric-light poles, telephone poles, gasoline pumps for motor cars, boxes of goods. Each man had built with the most valiant disregard of all the others. Between a large new [...] "block" [...] of two-story brick shops on one side, and the <b>fire-brick</b> Overland garage on the other side, was a one-story cottage turned into a millinery shop. The white temple of the Farmers' Bank was elbowed back by a grocery of glaring yellow brick. One store-building had a patchy galvanized iron cornice; the building beside it was crowned with battlements and pyramids of brick capped with blocks of red sandstone.|$|E
60|$|The {{arrangements}} touching {{fuel and}} water in this great metal-working establishment are on a large scale. The biggest of the Afrán ("furnaces") lies to the north-west, near the right bank of the valley: all are of the ordinary type, originally some five or six feet high, to judge from the bases. They are built of <b>fire-brick,</b> and of the Hismá stone, which faces itself into a natural latex. We dug deep into several of them; but so careful had been the workmen, or perhaps those who afterwards ransacked these places, that not the smallest tear of metal remained: we found only ashes, pottery, and scoriae, as usual black and green, the latter worked sub-aerially; {{many of them had}} projections like stalactite. Round the furnaces are strewed carbonate of lime, stained black with iron, like that of Sharmá; and a quantity of the chlorite-enamelled serpentine still used in the Brazil as a flux.|$|E
60|$|But, see, as we {{round the}} Hangman, what {{a change of}} scene--the square-blocked {{sandstone}} cliffs dip suddenly under dark slate-beds, fantastically bent and broken by primeval earthquakes. Wooded combes, and craggy ridges of rich pasture-land, wander and slope towards a labyrinth of bush-fringed coves, black isolated tide-rocks, and land-locked harbours. There shines among the woods the Castle of Watermouth, on its lovely little salt-water loch, the safest harbour on the coast; and there is Combe-Martin, mile-long man-stye, which seven centuries of fruitless silver-mining, and of the right (now deservedly lost) of 'sending a talker to the national palaver,' have neither cleansed nor civilized. Turn, turn thy head away, dear Claude, lest even at this distance some foul odour taint the summer airs, and complete the misfortune already presaged by that pale, sad face, sickening in the burning calm! For this great sun-roasted <b>fire-brick</b> of the Exmoor range is fairly burning up the breeze, and we have nothing but the tide to drift us slowly down to Ilfracombe.|$|E

6000|$|Upon this able report I {{would offer}} the {{following}} observations. We, who have travelled through {{a country like}} Midian, finding everywhere extensive works for metallurgy; barrages and aqueducts, cisterns and tanks furnaces, <b>fire-bricks,</b> and scoriae; open mines, and huge scatters of spalled quartz, with the remains of some eighteen cities and towns which apparently fell to ruin with the industry that founded and fed them;--we, I say, cannot but form a different and a far higher idea of its mineral capabilities than those who determine them by the simple inspection of a few specimens. The learned Dr. Percy at once hits the mark when he surmises that worthless samples were brought home; and this would necessarily occur when no metallurgist, no practical prospector, was present with the Expedition. As will appear from the following pages, all the specimens were collected a ciel ouvert, and wholly without judgment.|$|R

60|$|And now {{the last}} point is rounded, {{and they are}} full in sight of the spot in quest of which they have sailed four {{thousand}} miles of sea. A low black cliff, crowned by a wall; a battery at either end. Within, a few narrow streets of white houses, running parallel with the sea, upon a strip of flat, which seemed not two hundred yards in breadth; and behind, the mountain wall, covering the whole in deepest shade. How that wall was ever ascended to the inland seemed the puzzle; but Drew, who had been off the place before, pointed out to them a narrow path, which wound upwards through a glen, seemingly sheer perpendicular. That was {{the road to the}} capital, if any man dare try it. In spite of the shadow of the mountain, the whole place wore a dusty and glaring look. The breaths of air which came off the land were utterly stifling; and no wonder, for La Guayra, owing to the radiation of that vast <b>fire-brick</b> of heated rock, is one of the hottest spots upon the face of the whole earth.|$|E

The ecclesiastical authorities wanted it for their purposes, and so did the secular civilians, and so did the military. At last the Sá Leonites, hopeless of obtaining a Government grant, have set on foot a subscription which reached 500l.--some say 700l. There are, therefore, certain fitful signs of activity, and bricks and <b>fire-bricks</b> now cumber the ground; but it is all a 'flash in the pan.'

60|$|There {{was a fire}} in the grate, a small one, for {{the coal}} was economised by means of two large <b>fire-bricks,</b> and on a table (Augusta's writing table), placed at the further side of the room, was a paraffin-lamp turned low.

50|$|George Tennant, born in 1765 {{and the son}} of a {{solicitor}} in Lancashire, {{moved to}} the area in 1816, after he had bought the Rhydings estate. The Glan-y-wern Canal was unused at the time, following Lord Vernon's distraint, but Tennant, who had no previous experience with canals, decided to lease it, enlarge it and extend it. He planned to make it suitable for barges of 30 to 35 LT, which would gain access to the river Neath through a lock at Red Jacket. Where the canal turned northwards across Crymlyn Bog, he would extend it to the west, to terminate at a lock into the River Tawe, near Swansea harbour. He believed that Swansea docks would provide a better shipping point than Neath or Giant's Grave, and hoped that the canal would encourage the development of the corridor through which it ran. He attempted to gain support for the scheme from local landowners, but when none was forthcoming, he decided to fund the project himself. Lord Vernon's estate had been inherited by the Earl of Jersey in 1814, and so Tennant leased the Glan-y-wern Canal from him. Work started in 1817, {{under the direction of the}} engineer William Kirkhouse, and the canal was completed by autumn 1818, running from near the east pier on the River Tawe at Swansea to the River Neath at Red Jacket. The canal was built to a grander scale than originally intended, and could be navigated by barges of 50 to 60 LT. The main line was 4 mi long, and the 1.4 mi branch to Glan-y-wern was also reopened, for it supplied regular cargoes of coal. Other goods carried included timber, bark, <b>fire-bricks</b> and sand, but the volume of goods carried was not enough to make a profit. He negotiated with the Neath Canal, who gave him permission to build a lock into the river from their canal, either at Giant's Grave or Court Sart pill, but working canal boats across a tidal river would not have been ideal, and he did not build the lock.|$|R
5000|$|Chapter 1, is a {{very late}} Vedic chapter, which even has some Puranic names; it is usually called the Āruṇa praśna for the {{particular}} style of <b>fire-brick</b> piling {{dealt with in the}} text. It is also referred to as the [...] "Surya namaskara chapter" [...] by South Indian Brahmins who have created a ritual of reciting it with surya namaskara exercises after each of its 132 anuvakas. Parts of the Kaṭha version of this section has been published by L. v. Schroeder in 1898. Chapter 2, discusses the five Mahā-yajñas that every Brahmin has to do daily, most importantly the daily recitation of the Veda (svādhyāya). Further, the sacred thread, the yajñopavīta, sāndhyā worship, that of the ancestors (pitṛ), the brahma-yajña, and the cleansing homa-sacrifice ('kūṣmāṇḍa-homa') are all treated in detail. - In this chapter the word 'shramana' is used (2-7-1) in the meaning of an ascetic (tapasvin); this word was later used also for the Buddhist and Jain ascetics. - Discussed and translated by Ch.

50|$|In 1844, the Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway (OWWR) {{announced}} {{their intention to}} build a line which would partly run parallel to both the canal and the Dudley Canal. Despite opposition by the canal company, the line was built and opened in 1852 and 1853. However, its effect was not immediately significant, and a proposed reduction in tolls was not deemed to be necessary. Some goods were transferred to the railway from a private basin, which ultimately led to an agreement on tolls for such transfers and the construction in 1858 of a transhipment siding on Stourbridge wharf. Trade held up well, derived from six ironworks and a tinplate works situated on the canal above the Stourbridge flight, traffic from the collieries on the Extension Canal, and various other industrial concerns, including <b>fire-brick</b> manufacturers and glassworks. In 1865, a new Act of Parliament introduced powers to charge mileage tolls for traffic using the upper level, but not passing through any locks. Income gradually dropped, and the dividend was below 8 per cent {{for the first time}} in 1873. For many canal companies, the Railway and Canal Traffic Act, which became law in 1888, had a detrimental effect on revenue, but the Stourbridge tolls increased significantly, from £1,695 in 1894 to £2,718 in 1896.|$|E
50|$|In June 2012 a {{proposal}} by developer Ross Harrison was put {{forward to the}} Launceston City Council to incorporate the Vertical Retort House and Carburetted Water Gas Building into a restaurant and bar with additional commercial space. In late July 2012, the site changed zoning from industrial to commercial and work commenced on cleaning {{the building of the}} accumulated pigeon droppings and polystyrene blocks that were dumped inside it. In mid-September removal of the Corrugated Asbestos Roofing started. On the 10 October 2012, the original 1932 machinery was blow-torched out of the building to be taken away followed by disassembly of the <b>fire-brick</b> retorts except for the coke extractors which were partially retained for aesthetic value. The completed works now link the two buildings with a glass atrium as the earlier proposal had intended. A bar and reception area are currently located on the 1st floor (ground level) of the Vertical Retort House under the former retort blocks with restaurant space occupying the area between the two buildings and into the Carburetted Water Gas Building. The upper levels of both buildings have been remodeled to support retail and office spaces. The machinery within the Vertical Retort House underwent a heritage survey to assess the historic value of the surviving equipment and from that, local architectural firm, ARTAS, was left to incorporate this into the final design. Removed machinery was intended to be kept as museum exhibits but has yet to be utilized for such purposes. At present all the machinery in the Vertical Retort has been removed except for a few components on the ground level and the waste heat boiler on the floors above, with salvaged components stored in the Horizontal Retort House.|$|E

40|$|Identification of cremated bodies is {{problematic}} {{due to the}} effect of burning on the tissues of the body. Since hard tissues are altered by burning, it is likely that identification techniques that rely on these tissues will also be affected. The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine how heat-induced changes in the hard tissues of the body influence the results of anthropological methods of analysis. Twelve sheep Os coxae were burned in a <b>fire-brick</b> furnace. Eight measurements were taken from the sheep Os coxae before and after burning. Heat-induced shrinkage was calculated as a percentage. The significance of the differences between the measurements taken before and after burning was assessed statistically (Wilcoxon Signed Rank). The alternative hypothesis, that the difference was significant, was accepted. The influence of heat-induced shrinkage on sex assessment techniques was examined algebraically, then demonstrated with metric methods of sex assessment. The conclusion reached was that uniform shrinkage of the pelvis would not affect metric sex determination techniques, but that differential shrinkage of the variables that comprise the metric sex assessment technique can result in misclassification of male cremated pelves as female, and vice versa...|$|E
40|$|A {{method has}} been {{investigated}} for measuring vapor-liquid equilibrium ratios, or K-values, of a solute distributed between a gas phase and a non-volatile liquid phase. A gas-liquid partition chromatographic technique is employed in which an inert, porous <b>fire-brick</b> is impregnated with the liquid phase, and the resulting liquid-containing solid is packed into a tube. The gas phase is flowed through the tube, and the solute of interest is eluted through the tube by the flowing gas phase. The data taken for the solute elution process is then related to the K-value of this solute in the vapor-liquid system maintained in the column. A previous mathematical solution describing the chromatographic elution process for a one component elution gas and which {{may be used to}} relate K-values to retention times for the solute at infinite dilution in the vapor-liquid equilibrium system is reviewed and expanded to include the effect of elution gas solubility in the liquid phase. A new mathematical solution is presented relating K-values to retention times for the case of a solute being eluted by a binary elution gas mixture composed of components soluble in the liquid phase. This solution covers the case of the solute sample being one of the components of the elution gas, in which the calculated K-values would be for the solute present at some finite composition in the system, and the case of the solute not being initially present in the elution gas, in which case the calculated K-value would be for the solute at infinite dilution in the vapor-liquid equilibrium system. Data were taken for ethane, propane, and n-butane solutes at infinite dilution in the methane-n-decane system at 160, 70, 40, 0, and - 20 °F from 20 [...] 2000 psia; for propane at infinite dilution in n-hexadecane at 70 °F and 20 [...] 225 psia; and propane in the system methane-propane-n-decane at 40 °F from 20 [...] 460 psia. The chromatographically determined K-values for n-butane at infinite dilution in methane-n-decane were compared over portions of the 40 and 160 °F isotherms with published static equilibrium values and found in agreement. Data for all the solute isotherms were compared at atmospheric pressure with the results of the Bronsted-Koefed relation for predicting activity coefficients, and, again, close agreement was found. The applicability of the chromatographic method for determining freezing points was investigated, and the solid-liquid-gas line for the methane-decane system was measured...|$|E
