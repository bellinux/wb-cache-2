5000|$|Foetal {{cerebral}} redistribution or 'brain-sparing' is {{a diagnosis}} in <b>foetal</b> <b>medicine.</b> It is characterised by preferential {{flow of blood}} towards the brain {{at the expense of}} the other vital organs, and it occurs as a haemodynamic adaptation in foetuses which have placental insufficiency. [...] The underlying mechanism is thought to be vasodilation of the cerebral arteries. Cerebral redistribution is defined by the presence of a low middle cerebral artery pulsatility index (MCA-PI). Ultrasound of the middle cerebral artery to examine the Doppler waveform is used to establish this. Although cerebral redistribution represents an effort to preserve brain development in the face of hypoxic stress, it is nonetheless associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcome. The presence of cerebral redistribution will be one factor taken into consideration when deciding whether to artificially deliver a baby with placental insufficiency via induction of labour or caesarian section.|$|E

40|$|Background: Nausea and {{vomiting}} during pregnancy (NVP) {{is one of}} the most commonly experienced pregnancy complaints and has been associated with decreased quality of life and occupational and daily life functioning, as well as negative socioeconomic consequences. Though several treatment guidelines exist for NVP, including recommendations for medicines that are safe to use during pregnancy, we know little about how this condition is managed, both internationally and nationally in Norway. We also know little about attitudes to treatment of this complaint. Ginger is included in most guidelines. However, only one study exists that was designed to investigate the safety of its use during pregnancy. Objectives: The main aim of this doctorial work was to explore various aspects of treatment of NVP. The specific objectives were: 1) to investigate whether exposure to ginger, a common NVP herbal drug, was associated with an increased risk of congenital malformations or other selected negative pregnancy outcomes; 2) to explore patterns of and factors related to NVP and its treatment across countries in Europe, North America, and Australia; 3) to explore thoughts and attitudes among Norwegian pregnant women and GPs about the treatment of NVP, and to identify potential barriers to optimal care for women with NVP; 4) to investigate the treatments used for NVP according to NVP severity among women in Norway, and to assess whether maternal characteristics and attitudes were related to the use of pharmacological treatment of NVP. Methods: In order to address the above objectives, several methods and data sources were used. 1) The large population-based Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort study, which provides information on the use of ginger and several potential confounders, was linked to the Medical Birth Registry of Norway from which information on pregnancy outcomes was retrieved (Paper I). 2) The Multinational Medication Use in Pregnancy Study, a web-based cross-sectional study carried out among women and new mothers in 18 countries (Paper II). 3) Focus group discussions were used to explore thoughts about and attitudes to the treatment of NVP among pregnant women and general practitioners (Paper III). 4) A web-based cross-sectional study was conducted among pregnant women and new mothers in Norway with NVP (Paper IV). Results: The study in Paper I showed that the use of ginger during pregnancy was neither associated with any increased risk of congenital malformations nor with any increased risk of stillbirth/perinatal death, preterm birth, low birth weight, or low Apgar score. In the study in Paper II, nausea during pregnancy was reported by 73. 5 % of women, 17. 9 % of whom used conventional medicines and 8. 3 % herbal medicines. The prevalence of self-reported nausea and its treatment varied across countries. Education, working status and folic acid use were significantly associated with the use of conventional medicines against nausea. Respondents who suffered from nausea also had a high burden of comorbidity. In the focus group study in Paper III, the GPs thought it was important to normalise NVP symptoms. However, the women felt that their distress due to NVP was trivialised by the GPs. The women were sceptical about using medicines while pregnant, and avoidance was sought despite being ill. The GPs, who appeared to be uncertain and rather restrictive with respect to medical treatment of NVP, seemed to regard sick leave as an important part of the treatment regime. The women had good experience of graded sick leave. The Norwegian study described in Paper IV showed that, of the 712 women who were included in the study, 8. 7 %, 61. 7 % and 29. 5 % had mild, moderate and severe NVP, respectively. A total of 38. 9 % women had used one or more antiemetics, of which meclizine was the most commonly used, closely followed by metoclopramide. Different drug utilisation patterns were found between the groups of women with mild, moderate and severe NVP, and many women with moderate and severe NVP had not used medicines for NVP (70. 2 % and 32. 9 %, respectively). Sick leave was prescribed without initiating medical treatment in the case of 62. 1 % of the women who had been on sick leave. The women’s beliefs about medicines had an important impact on their use of medicines for NVP. Conclusion and implications: The findings of this doctorial work show that there are potential areas for improvement with respect to the management of NVP. The findings indicate 1) a need to increase awareness among healthcare personnel of the great distress women suffering from NVP may experience, and 2) that it is necessary to educate them about the recommendations in guidelines for the treatment of NVP. Due to the pregnant women’s fear of teratogenic effects of medicines, balanced evidence-based information about the maternal and <b>foetal</b> risks of <b>medicines</b> for NVP and tailored risk communication are necessary in order to reassure pregnant women in need of NVP medication. </p...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} the problem of data heaping that arises when {{measurements}} are recorded to varying degrees of precision. The work is motivated by an application in <b>foetal</b> <b>medicine</b> where measurements obtained from ultrasound images are rounded to varying numbers of decimal places causing heaping at integer values. We demonstrate the dangers of ignoring heaping before presenting a case-study of the ultrasound measurements. A mixture model, in which the different components represent different levels of rounding, is used for the heaping process. We illustrate a range of graphical posterior predictive checks to assess the fit of the model and we explore some extensions of the model. We adopt a Bayesian approach implemented by using the Gibbs sampler...|$|E
40|$|Aims and Objectives: The fourth ventricle, seen as {{intracranial}} translucency (IT) at 11 – 13 + 6 weeks, {{has been}} reported to be obliterated in cases of open spina bifida (OSB). Our aim was to assess its role in detecting OSB at 11 – 13 + 6 weeks. Materials and Methods: This prospective study was conducted at <b>foetal</b> <b>medicine</b> unit from January 2014 to June 2015. All women who underwent both first and mid-trimester scan in our unit were included in the study. IT was categorized as normal, obliterated or not clear. Spine was examined during both scans. Results: Totally, 341 cases were included in the study. IT was found to be obliterated in four cases and not clear in one case. There was demonstrable OSB at 11 – 13 + 6 weeks in two cases, at 15 – 16 weeks in two cases and at 24 weeks in one case. In the remaining 336 cases with normal IT, spine was found to be normal at target scan. Conclusion: Mid-sagittal view of face that is routinely used to measure nuchal translucency (NT) {{can also be used to}} detect OSB. It is feasible to integrate IT into the routine 11 – 13 + 6 weeks scan...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To compare {{ultrasound}} diagnosis with autopsy {{findings in}} two tertiary referral <b>foetal</b> <b>medicine</b> centres, only one routinely using 3 D and 4 D ultrasound, and to compare results between the centres. METHODS: A retrospective study of 138 cases with a termination of pregnancy for foetal abnormalities after 21 weeks' gestation from January 2004 through May 2006 was carried out. We compared prenatal ultrasound and autopsy findings for each organ, calculating the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive and negative predictive values, and false-positive and false-negative rates for ultrasound. RESULTS: Abnormalities were found most {{frequently in the}} brain (48. 9 %), heart and thorax (34. 0 %), limbs (31. 9 %), face (15. 9 %), and abdomen, urogenital tract and spine (14. 5 %). Sensitivity between centres did not differ statistically for the brain, spine, limbs and abdomen, but was different for the face (p = 0. 005) and heart (p = 0. 007). The detection rate was higher for facial malformations at the centre with routine 3 D and 4 D scans, and better for the heart and thorax at the other centre. CONCLUSION: Diagnostic ultrasound cannot give a complete assessment of foetal anatomy. Autopsy examination is always strongly recommended for accurate genetic counselling. As already reported, 3 D and 4 D ultrasound may improve ultrasound performance in facial anomalies...|$|E
40|$|Problem statement: The {{heart is}} the first organ and most {{importantly}} to form in the body, where is found the most powerful generator of electromagnetic energy in the human body. Electrophysiology is the best method used to diagnose human heart problem. Knowledge of the electrical potentials in human heart is a quantum leap in the science of the human heart. Recently, {{there has been a}} growing interest in studying the human ECG. However, is unfortunately a very complicated issue which requires a relatively good understanding of everything that has been said about the heart. Focus on the review of physical, electromagnetic basis of human heart's biopotentials and understanding the basic equations of cardiac electrophysiology that represents the basis to all clinicians whether in postnatal (pediatric or adult) or prenatal (<b>foetal)</b> <b>Medicine.</b> Approach: Mathematical method used for derivation of the essential equations of human heart electrical potentials, this equation will develop the principle sciences of human heart, the equation also outlier finding of the electromagnetic base of human electrophysiology. Results: Heart is important electrical generator in human body. The voltage and current which was generated in human heart represent the basis of heart biosciences. The electromagnetic energy of the heart not only envelops every cell of the human body, but also extends out in all directions in the space around human body. Conclusion: The proposed technique for electrophysiology and potentials on human ECG was useful and the results may contribute to the references for later studies...|$|E
40|$|Foetal {{movements}} commence {{at seven}} weeks of gestation, with the foetal movement repertoire including twitches, whole body movements, stretches, isolated limb movements, breathing movements, {{head and neck}} movements, jaw movements (including yawning, sucking and swallowing) and hiccups by ten weeks of gestational age. There are two key biomechanical aspects to gross foetal movements; the first being that the foetus moves in a dynamically changing constrained physical {{environment in which the}} freedom to move becomes increasingly restricted with increasing foetal size and decreasing amniotic fluid. Therefore, the mechanical environment experienced by the foetus affects its ability to move freely. Secondly, the mechanical forces induced by foetal movements are crucial for normal skeletal development, as evidenced by a number of conditions and syndromes for which reduced or abnormal foetal movements are implicated, such as developmental dysplasia of the hip, arthrogryposis and foetal akinesia deformation sequence. This review examines both the biomechanical effects of the physical environment on foetal movements through discussion of intrauterine factors, such as space, foetal positioning and volume of amniotic fluid, and the biomechanical role of gross foetal movements in human skeletal development through investigation of the effects of abnormal movement on the bones and joints. This review also highlights computational simulations of foetal movements that attempt to determine the mechanical forces acting on the foetus as it moves. Finally, avenues for future research into foetal movement biomechanics are highlighted, which have potential impact for a diverse range of fields including <b>foetal</b> <b>medicine,</b> musculoskeletal disorders and tissue engineering...|$|E
40|$|Background/Objective: The {{radiology}} examinations can {{be easily}} sent over high speed, it has made a filmless department and reporting of radiological examinations {{far away from the}} hospitals. The Baltic eHealth project focuses on telemedicine as a tool for rural development. The purpose of the eRadiology pilot is therefore to test the telemedicine solution between the Funen hospital and the radiological departments of Vilnius University Hospital and East Tallinn Central Hospital. In the pilot, it will be investigated if the solution is technically, financially, culturally and linguistically feasible. "nPatients and Methods: Internet- based health care networks are a step forward compared to first generation health care networks, which has been limited to pushing text - based massages between different systems. An internet- based network can also "pull" data - and not only text but any digital data - for instance images and video sequences. The internet-based networks can fulfil the vision to access to regardless of time and location more effectively. "nResults: The main result of the Baltic eHealth project is the Baltic Health Network (BHN), which connects not only all hospitals in Norway, Sweden and Denmark but also two hospitals in Lithuania and Estonia. This is demonstrated in the project in two pilots. In the eUltrasound pilot the midwives in the rural areas of V&auml;sterbottan County, Sweden, are awaiting the establishment of BHN to get access to second opinions from specialists at National Center for <b>Foetal</b> <b>Medicine</b> at the University Hospital of Trondheim, Norway. In the eRadiology pilot we try to overcome the problem of a lack of radiologists in Denmark, which leads to vacant positions and discomfort to patients as they have to wait months for simple radiological examinations. To remedy the problem of absent radiologists, x-rays taken at the Funen Hospital will be sent for description to a hospital in another country, which does not have a lack of radiologists. "nConclusion: In the Baltic eHealth project we hope to create the sustainable and balanced development of rural areas in Baltic sea region through a trans national cooperation in telemedicine. Once the usefulness of BHN is documented in Baltic Sea Region, the BHN will be strong candidate for universal European model for the next generation health care network...|$|E
