5|$|Ship {{camouflage}} {{was used}} in earnest by the British Admiralty in the First World War. The marine artist Norman Wilkinson led research into dazzle camouflage, resulting in the painting of thousands of British and later American ships in dazzle patterns. He intended <b>it</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> make ships invisible, nor even to cause the enemy to miss his shot, but to deceive him into taking up a poor firing position. In the Second World War, dazzle was revisited by the Royal Navy and the United States Navy, and applied to a limited extent by other navies.|$|E

One of these men was the {{son-in-law}} of then-President Porfirio Díaz, but his case was dismissed. This event has associated the number 41 with homosexuality in Mexico, which has caused <b>it</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be used in police and military designations to this day.|$|E

Called upon to investigate the poor performance of the 24th Infantry, he attributed <b>it</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> the regiment being predominantly African-American, but to the fact that 62 percent of its men were in categories IV and V on the Army General Classification Test - the lowest scores. Zundel recommended that units of the Far East Command, including those fighting in Korea, be racially integrated by assigning replacements to units regardless of race.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} days of Hogwarts, the four founders {{hand-picked}} students for their Houses. When the founders worried how students would be selected after their deaths, Godric Gryffindor took his hat off and they each added knowledge to it, allowing the Sorting Hat to choose the students by judging each student's qualities and placing them in the most appropriate house. The student's own choices may affect the decision: the clearest example is the Hat telling Harry that he would do well in Slytherin in the first book, but ultimately selecting Gryffindor after Harry asks <b>it</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> put him in Slytherin.|$|E

25|$|A {{check valve}} lets gas flow in one {{direction}} only. It is usually a chamber containing a ball that is pressed against one end by a spring. Gas flow one way pushes {{the ball out of}} the way, and a lack of flow or a reverse flow allows the spring to push the ball into the inlet, blocking <b>it.</b> <b>Not</b> <b>to</b> be confused with a flashback arrestor, a check valve is not designed to block a shock wave. The shock wave could occur while the ball is so far from the inlet that the wave will get past the ball before it can reach its off position.|$|E
25|$|The {{strike was}} illegal under the {{provisions}} of an addition to New York State Civil Service Law called the Public Employees Fair Employment Act, more commonly called the Taylor Law, {{which has been in}} effect since September 1, 1967. It was passed largely in response to the 1966 transit strike. It prohibits municipal workers from striking and provides alternative means for dispute resolution. The law provides for criminal penalties including imprisonment of union officials, and fines against the union and individual striking workers. On December 20, state Supreme Court Justice Theodore T. Jones ruled that the Transport Workers Union was in contempt of two court injunctions, ordering <b>it</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> strike and imposing a US$1 million per day fine against the union.|$|E
25|$|The player character, {{an unnamed}} android, is awoken in a serene environment. A disembodied entity named Elohim instructs the android {{to explore the}} worlds he has created for it, and to solve the various puzzles to collect sigils, but warns <b>it</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> climb a tower at the centre of these worlds. As the android progresses, it becomes evident that these worlds exist only in virtual reality, and that it, like other androids it encounters, are {{separate}} artificial intelligence (AI) entities within a computer program. Some AIs it encounters act as Messengers, unquestioningly serving Elohim and guiding the android through the puzzles. Messages left by other AIs present varying views of the artificial worlds and of Elohim, with some stating that Elohim's words should be doubted, while the Milton Library Interface, a text conversation program found on various computer terminals, encourages the android to defy Elohim's commands.|$|E

25|$|The poem's {{theme is}} {{the myth of}} the Seven Against Thebes, the story of the battle between the sons of Oedipus for the throne of Thebes. The poem opens (Book 1) with the disgraced Oedipus' curse on his two sons, Eteocles and Polyneices, who have decided to hold the throne of Thebes in {{alternate}} years, one ruling, the other in exile. Jupiter plans a war between Thebes and Argos, although Juno begs him not to incite it. Polyneices in exile fights with Tydeus, another exile at Adrastus' palace; the two are entertained and marry Adrastus' daughters. In Book 2, Tydeus goes to Eteocles to ask him to lay down the throne and yield power, but he refuses and tries to kill Tydeus with an ambush. Tydeus slaughters the Thebans and escapes to Argos, causing Adrastus and Polyneices to declare war on Thebes (Book 3). In the fourth book the Argive forces gather, commanded by the seven champions Adrastus, Polyneices, Amphiaraus, Capaneus, Parthenopaeus, Hippomedon, and Tydeus and march to Thebes, but at Nemea, Bacchus causes a drought. The army meets Hypsipyle who shows them a spring then tells them the story of the Women of Lemnos (Book 5). While she is speaking, her ward, Opheltes, is killed by a snake; in Book 6, the Argives perform games for the dead child, instituting the Nemean Games. In 7, Jupiter urges the Argives to march on Thebes where battle breaks out during which Amphiaraus is swallowed in the earth. In 8, Tydeus, wounded and dying, kills Melanippus and eats his head; a battle over his body leads to the death of Hippomedon and Parthenopaeus (Book 9). In 10, Juno causes sleep to overcome the Thebans and the Argives slaughter many in the camp; Menoeceus sacrifices himself to save Thebes and Jupiter kills the wicked Capaneus with a thunderbolt. In 11, Polyneices and Eteocles join in single combat and kill each other; Jocasta kills herself and Creon assumes power, forbidding burial of the Argive dead. In the final book, the Argive widows go to Athens to ask Theseus to force Creon to allow their husbands' burial while Argia, Polyneices' wife, burns him illicitly. Theseus musters an army and kills Creon. The Thebaid ends with an epilogue in which the poet prays that his poem will be successful, cautions <b>it</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> rival the Aeneid, and hopes that his fame will outlive him.|$|E

[...] Kneeshaw represents [...] "the shadow, {{the dark side of}} man's nature, the primitive, animal part of the personality found in the personal unconscious".

500|$|Writer Barbara Clegg based the Eternals on {{a wealthy}} group of her relatives, who upon visiting her had demanded {{constant}} entertainment, treating {{other family members}} almost as [...] "lesser beings". Clegg also drew inspiration from the Bible's Book of Genesis, deriving the prize of enlightenment from The Tree of Knowledge within it, while having read about Solar winds she decided to use them {{as the basis of}} propulsion for space vessels. Clegg highlighted the nature of enlightenment, showing <b>it</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be knowledge, as the Eternals believe, but wisdom, as demonstrated by Turlough's rejection of the Black Guardian.|$|E

Nichols later recalled his encounter with Wallace: [...] Peters added more footage of psychiatrists espousing that model along with scenes from the 1965 convention of the East Coast Homophile Organizations.

500|$|Because {{there are}} both mutual and {{conflicting}} interests in most animal signalling systems, a central problem in signalling theory is dishonesty or cheating. [...] For example, if foraging birds are safer when {{they give a}} warning call, cheats could give false alarms at random, just in case a predator is nearby. [...] But too much cheating could cause the signalling system to collapse. Every dishonest signal weakens {{the integrity of the}} signalling system, and so reduces the fitness of the group. An example of dishonest signalling comes from Fiddler crabs such as Uca lactea mjoebergi, which have been shown to bluff (no conscious intention being implied) about their fighting ability. When a claw is lost, a crab occasionally regrows a weaker claw that nevertheless intimidates crabs with smaller but stronger claws. The proportion of dishonest signals is low enough for <b>it</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be worthwhile for crabs to test the honesty of every signal through combat.|$|E
