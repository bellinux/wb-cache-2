I {{am sure that}} this unique endgame position was discovered {{with the help of}} Thompson’s famous computer database. <b>Is</b> <b>this</b> <b>a</b> 'flaw,' diminishing the composer's achievement? [...] Yes, the computer database is an instrument, available to anyone nowadays. Out of it, no doubt, we could probably extract yet more unique positions – there are some chess composers who do so regularly. The standard for evaluation here should be the result achieved. Thus: miracles, based upon complex computer analysis rather than on their content of sharp ideas, are probably of interest only to certain aesthetes.|$|E
