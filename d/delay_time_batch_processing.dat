40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} a practical scheduling problem commonly arising from batch production in a flexible manufacturing environment. Different part-types {{are to be}} produced in a flexible manufacturing cell organized into a two-stage production line. The jobs are processed in batches on the first machine, and the completion time of a job {{is defined as the}} completion <b>time</b> of the <b>batch</b> containing it. When processing of all jobs in a batch is completed on the first machine, the whole batch of jobs is transferred intact to the second machine. A constant setup time is incurred whenever a batch is formed on any machine. The tradeoff between the setup <b>times</b> and <b>batch</b> <b>processing</b> <b>times</b> gives rise to the batch composition decision.

We apply the models to several hypothetical scenarios with varying weather feature arrival and processing rates.

They all support online stream processing, high scalability, and tasks monitoring. While how to evaluate stream processing systems before choosing one in production development is an open question. In this thesis, we introduce StreamBench, a benchmark framework to facilitate performance comparisons of stream processing systems. A common API component and a core set of workloads are defined.

40|$|AbstractScreening {{patients}} for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) carriage at hospital admission is widely accepted {{as an essential}} part of MRSA control programmes. It is assumed, although not proven, that rapid reporting of screening results will improve MRSA control, provided that a clear action plan for positive cases is in place and is being followed. An effective culture screening method is direct inoculation of pooled nose, throat and perineal swabs on a well-performing MRSA-selective chromogenic agar; presumptive MRSA colonies can be confirmed rapidly by latex agglutination with antibodies directed against penicillin-binding protein 2 a. This method will usually produce a positive result after 24 h of incubation in > 95 % of true-positive cases, and will be sufficient for most initial treatment and infection control decisions; full antimicrobial susceptibilities will be available on the next day. Inoculation of selective enrichment broth containing a colorimetric growth indicator is an alternative overnight culture method, but there may be problems with overgrowth of other organisms, such as enterococci. PCR methods are now available that can produce same-day results, provided that samples reach the laboratory in <b>time</b> for <b>batch</b> <b>processing,</b> but cultures are required for susceptibility testing. In comparison with culture-based methods, PCR tests are costly, and some have relatively high false-positivity rates; definitive evidence of their clinical cost-effectiveness is lacking.
