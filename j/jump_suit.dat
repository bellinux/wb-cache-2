5|$|The stage {{show at the}} semi-final {{included}} Dustin in his trolley, {{wearing a}} silver suit. The trolley was dressed in green, white and gold, with the girls wearing gold dresses, green gloves and head-dresses in green, white and gold. Two of the male backing dancers wore large green, white and gold wings and danced around the stage, while the third back-up dancer wore a gold <b>jump</b> <b>suit.</b> The stage involved rippling effects of black and white, as well as waves of orange, white and green through the LCD screens on the stage. Despite {{being one of the}} favourites to win the contest outright, Dustin only managed to receive 22 points, placing 15th of the 19 countries competing and failing to reach the final.|$|E
500|$|On the Confessions Tour, [...] "Lucky Star" [...] was {{performed}} with Madonna {{dressed in a}} purple and white leotard, designed by Jean-Paul Gaultier. Following the performance of [...] "La Isla Bonita" [...] Madonna lies face-down on the stage. Her dancers wrap a cape around her that proclaim the word [...] "Dancing Queen" [...] at the back. The intro to [...] "Lucky Star" [...] is heard, Madonna gets up and faces the audience. The lights go off and Madonna opens the cape to reveal {{the inside of the}} cape to be lit. Her backup singers join her and together they move around the stage, while singing the song. Towards the end of the song, Madonna also sings the chorus of the next performance, [...] "Hung Up". The performance was included on both the CD and the DVD version of The Confessions Tour, released in 2007. Ed Gonzalez of Slant Magazine compared Madonna's performance of [...] "Lucky Star" [...] as [...] "a soul butterfly fluttering to the disco heavens during a remix of [...] that actually makes [...] sound good." [...] Thomas Inskeep from Stylus called the performance fresh. Christian John Wikane from PopMatters was not impressed with the performance; he felt that singing the song over the newly arranged chord progression, is cold and pairing the original arrangement with the ABBA sample is [...] " [...] match not made in heaven, though Madonna's skin-tight, ABBA-esque <b>jump</b> <b>suit</b> is an amusing intertextualization." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{official}} mascot was Footix, {{a rooster}} first presented in May 1996. It {{was created by}} graphic designer Fabrice Pialot and selected from a shortlist of five mascots. Research carried out about the choice of having a cockerel as a mascot was greatly received: 91% associated it immediately with France, the traditional symbol of the nation. Footix, the name chosen by French television viewers, is a portmanteau of [...] "football" [...] and the ending [...] "-ix" [...] from the popular Astérix comic strip. The mascot's colours reflect those of the host nation's flag and home strip – blue for the <b>jump</b> <b>suit,</b> a red crest and with the words 'France 98' coloured in white.|$|E

40|$|Advancements {{of science}} and {{technology}} have progressively been introduced in speed sports especially in ski jumping. AerodYnanJics plays a pivotal role in the overall performance of ski jumping. In ski jumping, the skier body position, ski, ski <b>jumping</b> <b>suit</b> and other associated gears- all play a combined role in the flight trajectory of the ski jumper (skier). Although some studies have been conducted on the skier&# 039;s body and ski positions, scant or no study on aerodynamic behaviour of the ski suits and skier has been reported in the open literature. Therefore, a comprehensive study on aerodynamics of ski suits is required to understand the role of ski suits and skier in ski jumping. A full scale testing along with all gears is extremely important to understand the aerodynamics of skier and ski suits. The primary objectives of this study are to design and develop a full scale experimental setup and evaluate the aerodynamic performance of skier and ski <b>jumping</b> <b>suits</b> along with skies, boots, goggles, helmet and gloves. The full scale experimental setup can not only be used to measure the aerodynamic properties of the ski <b>jumping</b> <b>suits</b> and skier but also {{can be used as a}} training simulator...|$|R

50|$|The {{winner is}} decided with a scoring {{system based on}} distance, style, inrun length, gate factor and wind conditions. In the {{individual}} event, the scores from each skier's two competition jumps are combined to determine the winner. Aerodynamics has become a factor of increasing importance in modern ski jumping, with recent rules addressing the regulation of ski <b>jumping</b> <b>suits.</b>|$|R
40|$|In today&# 039;s sport, a {{combined}} effort of individual skill, science & technological advancement and rigorous training {{is important for}} the success. In addition, athletes need both simulated and field training to be prepared physically and mentally. It is especially important for technically challenging sports like ski jumping where aerodynamics playa vital role. To achieve aerodynamic efficiency (manipulate drag and lift), the ski jumper&# 039;s body postures, position & profile of the skis and other associated gears need to be optimised. Due to the short duration of ski jumping, a wind tunnel environment is an effective tool for both aerodynamic optimisation and training. This paper describes a design of a wind tunnel experimental rig that {{can be used as a}} training simulator as well as for the aerodynamic optimisation of the ski jumper&# 039;s body posture and <b>jumping</b> <b>suits.</b> Using the developed full scale experimental rig, the aerodynamic perfonnance of two ski <b>jumping</b> <b>suits</b> with an articulated mannequin was evaluated and presented in this paper...|$|R
