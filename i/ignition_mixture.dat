In this regard two main parts have been taken into consideration, aiming to convert an MPFI gasoline engine to direct injection natu-ral gas engine. In {{the first part of}} the study of multi-dimensional numerical simula-tion of transient injection process, mixing and flow field have been performed via three different validation cases in order to assure the numerical model validity of results. Adaption of such a modeling was found to be a challenging task because of required computational effort and numerical instabilities. In all cases present re-sults were found to have excellent agreement with experimental and numerical re-sults from literature. In the second part, using the moving mesh capability the validated model has been applied to methane injection into the cylinder of a direct injection engine. Five dif-ferent piston head shapes along with two injector types have been taken into consid-eration in investigations. A centrally mounted injector location has been adapted to all cases. The effects of injection parameters, combustion chamber geometry, injec-tor type, and engine rpm have been studied on mixing of air-fuel inside cylinder. Based on the results, suitable geometrical configuration for a naturel gas direct in-jection engine has been discussed.

40|$|This work focuses {{particularly}} on solid energetic materials designed to produce high-pressure gas for pressurizing or inflating devices. In cool gas generators sodium azide is often used. Unfortunately this chemical exhibits drawbacks concerning toxicity and yield of gas. Another gas-generating agent is double base propellant, which {{has traditionally been}} used in the rocket-industry. However, it delivers toxic and reactive gases and its combustion temperature is high. In previous work a series of gas-generating materials have been proposed as potential alternatives fueled with double base propellant, azodicarbonamide, nitroguanidine, or guanidine nitrate and stoichiometricly oxidized with potassium nitrate or potassium perchlorate. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to examine and compare the burning characteristics of the previously proposed compositions. To carry out this characterization. methods typical for propellant technology are used. Ignition delay, time from ignition to maximum pressure, burning rate. and absolute vivacity have been investigated through closed vessel tests. Thanks to the use of a gaseous <b>ignition</b> <b>mixture</b> the form function of the tested grains is not deteriorated. This leads to fairly reproducible results for the burning rate and the absolute vivacity, despite possible discrepancies in the ignition delay. In most of the studied cases, the addition of an oxidizer tends to improve the ignition delay and the time from ignition to maximum pressure. In addition the burning rate and absolute vivacity increase significantly. The only exception is double base propellant, where the presence of an oxidizer causes relatively minor changes in its combustion properties. status: publishe...|$|E
