5|$|<b>Hooper</b> {{finished}} school aged 16, then {{wrote the}} script for his first professional short film, entitled Painted Faces. He {{spent the next two}} years raising capital for the short by courting advertisement directors, whose financial dominance during the late 1980s was noticed by <b>Hooper.</b> Director Paul Weiland invested in the short, which provided <b>Hooper</b> with the equipment he needed. After two years of financing and production, Painted Faces was completed. <b>Hooper</b> wrote, produced, directed and edited it. It was sold to Channel 4 and broadcast on the channel's First Frame strand in 1992, had a screening at the 35th London Film Festival and had a limited theatrical release.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hooper</b> has not {{represented}} England at any level. His paternal grandfather William <b>Hooper</b> {{was raised in}} the Scottish Borders, and this led to hopes that <b>Hooper</b> could be eligible to play for Scotland. Then Scotland head coach Craig Levein sought clarification as to the place of birth his grandfather's birth certificate recorded, as he had been born in a hospital in the English border town Berwick-upon-Tweed. The possibility was closed off when it was confirmed that his grandfather was included in the English Births Index. On 13 March 2011, <b>Hooper</b> was included by Stuart Pearce in his 31-man squad for the England under-21 team to play Denmark and Iceland. However, <b>Hooper</b> pulled out of the squad due to injury. On 3 May 2011, he was named in the 40-man provisional squad for the UEFA Under-21 Championship, but did not make the final selection.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hooper</b> {{produced}} the film {{for less than}} $300,000 (about $ adjusted for inflation) and used a cast of relatively unknown actors drawn mainly from central Texas, where the film was shot. The limited budget forced <b>Hooper</b> to film for long hours seven days a week, {{so that he could}} finish as quickly as possible and reduce equipment rental costs. Due to the film's violent content, <b>Hooper</b> struggled to find a distributor. Louis Perano of Bryanston Pictures eventually purchased the distribution rights. <b>Hooper</b> limited the quantity of onscreen gore in hopes of securing a PG rating, but the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) rated it R. The film faced similar difficulties internationally.|$|E

2500|$|In response, Ridley {{rejected}} <b>Hooper's</b> {{insistence on}} biblical origins and countered <b>Hooper's</b> interpretations of his chosen biblical texts. He {{points out that}} many non-controversial practices are not mentioned or implied in scripture. Ridley denies that early church practices are normative for the present situation, and he links such primitivist arguments with the Anabaptists. Joking that <b>Hooper's</b> reference to Christ's nakedness on the cross is as insignificant as the clothing King Herod put Christ in and [...] "a jolly argument" [...] for the Adamites, Ridley does not dispute <b>Hooper's</b> main typological argument, but neither does he accept that vestments are necessarily or exclusively identified with Israel and the Roman church. On <b>Hooper's</b> point about the priesthood of all believers, Ridley says {{it does not follow}} from this doctrine that all Christians must wear the same clothes.|$|R
5|$|In 1999, <b>Hooper</b> {{directed}} two {{episodes of}} Granada Television's comedy-drama television series Cold Feet, which marked his move to bigger-budget productions.

On 24 October, <b>Hooper</b> scored twice in a 3–1 League Cup win over Leeds United. He went on to make 18 appearances for Southend in the Championship, although only two were starts. On 15 March, <b>Hooper</b> joined League One club Leyton Orient on loan {{for the rest of the}} season.

A number of players were out injured for the match and, five days after his recall, <b>Hooper</b> started in the 4–1 defeat to Southampton.|$|E

5|$|Their {{first two}} days at sea are {{unproductive}} and they return to port each night. On the third day, <b>Hooper</b> wants to bring along a shark proof cage.

On the ocean, the shark finally shows up. <b>Hooper</b> guesses the animal {{must be at least}} twenty feet long, and is visibly excited and in awe. After several unsuccessful attempts by Quint to harpoon the shark, <b>Hooper</b> goes underwater in the cage. He resolves to first take photos of the shark, before trying to kill it with a bang stick. However, the shark attacks the cage, and, after ramming the bars apart, kills and eats <b>Hooper.</b>|$|E
