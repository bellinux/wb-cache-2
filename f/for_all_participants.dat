25|$|The four parties, {{supported}} by some Social Democrats who had remained in Berlin, offered fresh elections, a cabinet reshuffle and an amnesty <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>participants</b> in the putsch, if Kapp and Lüttwitz were to resign. The putschists offered only {{the resignation of}} Kapp and Lüttwitz tried to hold on for another day as head of a military dictatorship but his commanders deserted him. They suggested to Schiffer, {{in the absence of}} Ebert in charge of the government's affairs, that he appoint Seeckt as head of the Reichswehr, which Schiffer did in the name of Ebert. When Lüttwitz offered his resignation on 18 March, Schiffer accepted—again in Ebert's name—while granting him full pension rights. Schiffer also suggested Pabst and Lüttwitz should leave the country, until the National Assembly had decided on the question of an amnesty and even offered them false passports and money.|$|E

500|$|UC Santa Cruz is {{also well}} known for its {{cannabis}} culture. On April 20, 2007, approximately 2,000 UCSC students gathered at Porter Meadow to celebrate the annual [...] "420". Students and others openly smoked marijuana while campus police stood by. The once student-only event has grown since the city of Santa Cruz passed Measure K in 2006, an ordinance making marijuana use a low-priority crime for police. The 2007 event attracted a total of 5,000 participants. The university does not condone the gathering, but has taken steps to regulate the event and ensure security <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>participants.</b> On April 20, 2010, the school administration shut down the west entrance to campus and limited the number of buses that could drive through campus.|$|E
500|$|The Lancaster House Agreement called <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>participants</b> in the Rhodesian Bush War {{to agree}} to a ceasefire, with a British governor, Christopher Soames, {{arriving}} in Rhodesia to oversee an election in which the various factions could compete as political parties. It outlined a plan for a transition to formal independence as a sovereign republic under black-majority rule, also maintaining that Rhodesia would be renamed Zimbabwe, a name adopted from the Iron Age archaeological site of Great Zimbabwe. The agreement also ensured that the country's white minority retained many of its economic and political privileges, with 20 seats to be reserved for whites in the new Parliament. By insisting on the need for a democratic black majority government, Carington was able to convince Mugabe to compromise on the other main issue of the conference, that of land ownership. Mugabe agreed to the protection of the white community's privately owned property on the condition that the UK and US governments provide financial assistance allowing the Zimbabwean government to purchase much land for redistribution among blacks.|$|E
500|$|In ancient Rome, chariot races {{commonly}} {{took place}} in a circus. The main centre of chariot racing was the Circus Maximus in the valley between Palatine Hill and Aventine Hill, which could seat 250,000 people. It was the earliest circus in the city of Rome. The Circus was supposed to date to the city's earliest times, but it was rebuilt by Julius Caesar around 50 BC so that it had a length of about [...] and a width of about [...] One end of the track was more open than the other, as this was where the chariots lined up to begin the race. The Romans used a series of gates known as carceres, an equivalent to the Greek hysplex. These were staggered {{in the same way as}} the hysplex, but they were slightly different because Roman racing tracks also had a median (the spina) in the centre of the track. The carceres took up the angled end of the track, and the chariots were loaded into spring-loaded gates. When the chariots were ready, the emperor (or whoever was hosting the races, if they were not in Rome) dropped a cloth known as a mappa, signalling the beginning of the race. The gates would spring open, creating a perfectly fair beginning <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>participants.</b>|$|E
