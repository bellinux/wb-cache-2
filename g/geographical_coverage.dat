40|$|Environmental {{factors which}} {{influence}} the distributions of malaria vectors in northern Australia (Anopheles farauti ss, A. farauti 2 and A. farauti 3) were investigated by ecological niche modelling and data mining using an extensive data set of species presence and absence records obtained by systematic field surveys. Models were generated with GARP (the genetic algorithm for rule-set prediction) using <b>geographical</b> <b>coverages</b> of 41 climatic and topographic parameters {{for the north}} of the continent. Environmental variables associated with species records were identified with the ranking procedures of the decision tree software packages CART and KnowledgeSeeker. There was consistent agreement in the variables ranked by both methods. This permitted the selection of reduced sets of environmental variables to develop GARP models for the three target species with equivalent predictive accuracy to those which used all of the environmental information. The environmental parameters which define the realised distributions of A. farauti ss and A. farauti 3 were well described by this approach but the results were less satisfactory for A. farauti 2. Atmospheric moisture was shown to be a critical variable for each species which accords with many field and laboratory observations concerning the influence of humidity on adult mosquito survival. ...|$|R

25|$|The first Apple Stores were {{originally}} opened as two locations in May 2001 by then-CEO Steve Jobs, {{after years of}} attempting but failing store-within-a-store concepts. Seeing a need for improved retail presentation of the company's products, he began an effort in 1997 to revamp the retail program to get an improved relationship to consumers, and hired Ron Johnson in 2000. Jobs relaunched Apple's online store in 1997, and opened the first two physical stores in 2001. Despite initial media speculation that Apple would fail, its stores were highly successful, bypassing the sales numbers of competing nearby stores and within three years reached US$1 billion in annual sales, becoming the fastest retailer in history to do so. Over the years, Apple has expanded the number of retail locations and its <b>geographical</b> <b>coverage,</b> with 498 stores across 22 countries worldwide as of July 2017. Strong product sales have placed Apple among the top-tier retail stores, with sales over $16 billion globally in 2011.|$|E
25|$|Indeed, of all {{the current}} {{newspapers}} published within Cornwall, only one is independent, the St. Ives Times & Echo, which formed out of the merger of Western Echo and the St. Ives Times in 1972. All of the others are either owned by Tindle Newspaper Group, Newsquest or Northcliffe Newspapers Group. The <b>geographical</b> <b>coverage</b> of the existing papers is also haphazard, {{with a lot of}} duplication (for example, Callington is covered by the East Cornwall Times, The Cornish Times and the Cornish & Devon Post) while some areas (particularly North Cornwall/Bude) are poorly served (just the North Cornwall edition of the St Austell centric Cornish Guardian). There is an argument that Cornwall would be better served having at least one weekly paper which covers the entire county, as {{one of the main reasons}} for purchasing the weekly paper is by prospective property buyers and people buying and selling cars and job seekers. Indeed, The West Briton has gone some way to accommodate this; although there are four separate news editions of the paper, each week a classified/job vacancy section and a property section cover all of mid and west Cornwall, though places east of Bodmin, for no known reason, are generally excluded.|$|E

500|$|The Alliance Premier League {{was formed}} in 1979, pushing the Regional League further down the English {{football}} league system. [...] Successful Regional League clubs such as Bilston Town, Hednesford Town and Halesowen Town began applying to, and being accepted into, the Southern League, reducing the Regional League {{to the status of}} a feeder league, although their departures continued to be offset by a flow of new members from lower-level leagues. [...] Reflecting the demographics of the West Midlands area, a number of British Asian teams joined the league, including Sikh Hunters, England's first ever all-Sikh team. [...] At the same time the catchment areas of the Regional League and the then-Midland Football Combination were increasingly converging, and by the early 1990s the standard of play and <b>geographical</b> <b>coverage</b> of the two competitions were considered to be almost identical. [...] A new competition {{was formed in}} 1994 to cater for the best clubs previously split across the two leagues, and thus the Regional League lost ten of its member clubs to the Midland Football Alliance, further reducing its own status.|$|E

In 2005 the University completed the renovation of historic Herring Hall, and the University of Arizona Fungal Herbarium, renamed the Robert L. Gilbertson Mycological Herbarium was inaugurated on Friday, March 11, 2005. The names of the fungi were current ones, unusual for wood decay fungi, a group in which genus level reassignments remain common.

2500|$|Despite the provisions, {{control and}} {{regulations}} of Reserve Bank of India, most banks in India {{had continued to}} be {{owned and operated by}} private persons. Businessmen who owned the banks were often accused of channeling the deposits into their own companies, and ignoring the priority sector. Furthermore, there was a great resentment against class banking in India, which had left the poor (the majority population) unbanked. After becoming Prime Minister, Gandhi expressed the intention of nationalising the banks in a paper titled, [...] "Stray thoughts on Bank Nationalisation" [...] in order to alleviate poverty. The paper received the overwhelming support of the public. In 1969, Gandhi moved to nationalise fourteen major commercial banks. After the nationalisation of banks, the branches of the public sector banks in India rose to approximate 800 percent in deposits, and advances took a huge jump by 11,000 percent. Nationalisation also resulted in a significant growth in the <b>geographical</b> <b>coverage</b> of banks; the number of bank branches rose from 8,200 to over 62,000, most of which were opened in the unbanked, rural areas. The nationalization drive not only helped to increase household savings, but it also provided considerable investments in the informal sector, in small and medium-sized enterprises, and in agriculture, and contributed significantly to regional development and to the expansion of India's industrial and agricultural base. Jayaprakash Narayan, who became famous for leading the opposition to Gandhi in the 1970s, was solid in his praise for her bank nationalisations.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION Advances in sensor and {{communication}} technologies {{have made it}} possible to manufacture small sensors with sensing, processing, and wireless communication capabilities in a costeffective fashion. A sensor network can be formed by deploying specialized sensors in the region of interest to perform certain sensing and networking tasks. Application scenarios of wireless sensor networks include battlefield surveillance, environment monitoring, and etc. Many of the above application scenarios involve a large number of sensors deployed in a vast <b>geographical</b> area. <b>Coverage</b> and detectability are two fundamental measures of the performance of a sensor network. In general, sensing coverage represents how well an area is monitored by sensors; and detectability represents the capability that a sensor network detects an object that moves through the network. Formal definitions of the coverage and detectability will be introduced shortly. Characterizations of these two measures presen...|$|R

40|$|Satellite image {{classification}} {{has been a}} major research field for many years with its varied applications in the field of Geography, Geology, Archaeology, Environmental Sciences and Military purposes. Many different techniques have been proposed to classify satellite images with color, shape and texture features. Complex indices like Vegetation index (NDVI), Brightness index (BI) or Urban index (ISU) are used for multi-spectral or hyper-spectral satellite images. In this paper we will show the efficiency of structural features describing man-made objects in mid-resolution satellite images to describe image content. We will then show the state-of-the-art to classify large satellite images with structural features computed from road networks and urban regions extracted on small image patches cut in the large image. Fisher Linear Discriminant (FLD) analysis is used for feature selection and a one-vsrest probabilistic Gaussian kernel Support Vector Machines (SVM) classification method is used to classify the images. The classification probabilities associated with each subimage of the large image provide an estimate of the <b>geographical</b> class <b>coverage.</b> ...|$|R
