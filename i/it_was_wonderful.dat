They carry with them the esteem and affection of the townspeople, {{who have come to}} appreciate their rare qualities. Before her departure, Mrs. Adelina Türr insisted upon visiting the orphanages, where the children greeted her with a most abundant dose of confetti. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>wonderful</b> to see this scion of one of the greatest and most powerful families of Europe caress and kiss the sons of our labourers, and make the effort of conversing with them in their Pallanzese dialect.|$|E

I thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>wonderful.</b> He was kind and gentle and respectful and humble, and always tried to do his best." ...|$|E

500|$|The Max Weinberg 7 {{released}} a self-titled album in 2000 on Hip-O Records; Weinberg said {{he waited until}} then because [...] "I wanted to change my style of playing and hone my style before I committed to a record." [...] He was especially proud that the band had successfully backed Tony Bennett during a late 1990s appearance on Late Night: [...] "Two years ago if you'd asked me if I could play with Tony Bennett, I would have said absolutely not. I'm not in his league. But we played with him the other night, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>wonderful.</b> We swung." ...|$|E
500|$|Havers {{returned}} to Coronation Street on 17 February 2012. While appearing on Loose Women the previous year, Havers {{revealed that he}} had been in talks with Coronation Street producers about a return to the show. He stated that he had adored his role as Lewis and that he had to return and apologise to Audrey. Later that year, ITV announced that Havers would return to Coronation Street in 2012 to reprise his role as Lewis. Series producer Phil Collinson said that Havers had started filming his scenes in January 2012 and he would return on-screen from February. Collinson also said that Lewis would have a lot of ground to cover to win Audrey back, that the character is [...] "a great hoot" [...] and that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>wonderful</b> to have Havers back. Peter Dyke and Katie Begley of the Daily Star wrote that [...] Lewis' return storyline would show Audrey and her daughter, Gail Platt (Helen Worth), unexpectedly meeting Lewis at a country pub. Havers told Allison Jones of Inside Soap that Lewis then tries to convince them he is his own twin brother, Hugh. Havers said, [...] "Audrey is totally floored to see him again— as you can imagine. And if I said that Gail is angry when they bump into Lewis, it would be a massive understatement!" [...] Lewis begs Audrey and Gail not to call the police and he decides to return to Weatherfield.|$|E
500|$|While Creation {{were pleased}} with the final album, and the initial music press reviews were positive, the label soon {{realised}} that although, {{in the words of}} plugger James Kyllo, [...] "it was such a beautiful record, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>wonderful</b> to have it... it just didn't sound like a record that was going to recoup all the money that had been spent on it." [...] Alan McGee liked the record, but admitted, [...] "It was quite clear that we couldn't bear the idea of going through that again, because there was just nothing to say that [...] wouldn't do exactly the same again. That's enough. Lets step back". Despite a severe shortage of money, Creation funded a short tour of the north of England late in 1991. At the time the band were making the marketing of Loveless difficult—there would be no singles, and the band's name was forbidden to appear on the record sleeve. McGee was by now exhausted and frustrated. He recalled, [...] "I thought: I went to the wall for you. If this record bombs, I've stolen my father's money. And they were so...not understanding of anybody else's position." [...] McGee dropped My Bloody Valentine from Creation soon after the album's release because he could not bear working with Shields again; [...] "It was either him or me", he told The Guardian in 2004. Loveless peaked at number 24 on the UK Albums Chart, and failed to chart in the United States, where it was distributed by Sire Records. In 2003 Rolling Stone estimated the sales figures for Loveless as 225,000 copies sold.|$|E

2500|$|Oberman {{described}} her time on EastEnders as [...] "hectic", leading her to depart the show during December 2005. However, {{the role of}} Chrissie has remained a defining point of her career. In a recent interview, Oberman remarked: [...] "Chrissie was such a wonderful character and the show was watched by so many people, especially the murder of Den, that it opened up doors that I never thought it would. I had some fantastic offers when I left, there was film and theatre... <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>wonderful</b> for me; EastEnders {{is a very good}} calling card." [...] Oberman has also recently declared her willingness to return to the part of Chrissie and EastEnders, even if only to provide a resolution for the character.|$|E
2500|$|... "Kaiowas" [...] was {{recorded}} live among {{the ruins of}} the medieval castle of Chepstow. It was an entirely acoustic track, with Andreas Kisser and Max Cavalera on the guitars and brother-drummer Igor Cavalera and bassist Paulo Jr. handling the percussion duties. When they recorded [...] "Kaiowas", the quartet never even considered playing the track live, because they thought it would be too difficult to recreate the drumming on stage. They changed their minds after seeing a video of the American band Neurosis: [...] "We saw in that live video that the Neurosis guys put down their guitars and everybody started to play the drums on stage", lead guitarist Andreas remembers. [...] "We decided to try the same thing. We rehearsed it once and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>wonderful.</b> We haven't stopped playing the song live since." ...|$|E
2500|$|The seventh series {{aired in}} early 1991. Jason and Sullivan were {{involved}} with other projects, and {{it was confirmed that}} there were no plans for a new series. Despite this, the show continued in Christmas specials until 1993. Sullivan nonetheless wanted a final episode to tie up the show. In late 1996, three more one-hour episodes were filmed, to be broadcast over Christmas 1996. All three were well received and, due to the ending, were assumed to be the last. The show made a return in Christmas 2001 with the first of three new episodes which were shot together but ultimately broadcast over three consecutive Christmases from 2001 to 2003. Despite rumours of further episodes, in a 2008 interview, Sullivan was quoted as saying: [...] "There will not be another series of Only Fools And Horses. I can say that. We had our day, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>wonderful</b> but it is best to leave it now". Though Sullivan died in 2011, it returned for a special Sport Relief episode in 2014.|$|E
