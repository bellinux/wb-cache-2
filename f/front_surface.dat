5|$|The {{coat was}} a uniform bluish-grey, with a pale whitish belly, {{which was not}} contrasted on the flanks. The limbs had a faint dark line along their <b>front</b> <b>surface.</b> The {{forehead}} was brown, darker than the face, and the upper lip and patch {{in front of the}} eyes were lighter than the body. The neck-mane was directed forwards and not as developed as in the roan and sable antelopes, and the throat-mane was almost absent. Other differences between the bluebuck and its extant relatives included its shorter and blunter ears not tipped with black, a darker tail tuft (though little darker than its general colour), and smaller teeth. The bluebuck also lacked the contrasting black and white patterns seen on the heads of its relatives.|$|E
5|$|The type {{specimen}} preserves the right canine. Like other therocephalians, the canine of Euchambersia was very large, {{resulting in a}} specialized predatory lifestyle that incorporates a sabertooth bite into prey killing. It is round in cross-section, and bears a prominent ridge {{on the side of}} its <b>front</b> <b>surface.</b> Immediately beside this ridge is a shallow depression that becomes wider {{near the top of the}} tooth, which is probably the same structure as the groove interpreted by some authors. Theriodonts usually replace their teeth in an alternating (or distichial) pattern, such that the canine tooth is always functional; both skulls of Euchambersia show no sign of any replacement teeth developing, suggesting that Euchambersia was reliant on having both canines present and functional simultaneously.|$|E

25|$|The human vagina is {{an elastic}} muscular canal that {{extends from the}} vulva to the cervix. It is reddish pink in color, and it connects the outer vulva to the cervix of the uterus. The part of the vagina {{surrounding}} the cervix is called the fornix. The opening of the vagina lies near {{the middle of the}} perineum, between the opening of the urethra and the anus. The vaginal canal then travels upwards and backwards, between the urethra at the front, and the rectum at the back. Near the upper vagina, the cervix protrudes into the vagina on its <b>front</b> <b>surface</b> at approximately a 90 degree angle. The vaginal and urethral openings are protected by the labia.|$|E
25|$|In August 1959, Noyce {{formed at}} Fairchild {{a group to}} develop {{integrated}} circuits. On May 26, 1960, this group, led by Jay Last, produced the first planar integrated circuit. This prototype was not monolithic – two pairs of its transistors were isolated by cutting a groove on the chip, according to the patent by Last. The initial production stages repeated the Hoerni's planar process. Then the 80-micron-thick crystal was glued, face down, to the glass substrate, and additional photolithography was carried on the back surface. Deep etching created a groove down to the <b>front</b> <b>surface.</b> Then the back surface was covered with an epoxy resin, and the chip was separated from the glass substrate.|$|E
25|$|Proper {{choice of}} plasmatic metal nano-particles {{is crucial for}} the maximum light {{absorption}} in the active layer. <b>Front</b> <b>surface</b> located nano-particles Ag and Au are {{the most widely used}} materials due to their surface plasmon resonances located in the visible range and therefore interact more strongly with the peak solar intensity. However, such noble metal nano-particles always introduce reduced light coupling into Si at the short wavelengths below the surface plasmon resonance due to the detrimental Fano effect, i.e. the destructive interference between the scattered and unscattered light. Moreover, the noble metal nano-particles are impractical to implement for large-scale solar cell manufacture due to their high cost and scarcity in the earth's crust. Recently, Zhang et al. have demonstrated the low cost and earth abundant materials Al nano-particles to be able to outperform the widely used Ag and Au nano-particles. Al nano-particles, with their surface plasmon resonances located in the UV region below the desired solar spectrum edge at 300nm, can avoid the reduction and introduce extra enhancement in the shorter wavelength range.|$|E

2500|$|As a {{consequence}} of light pressure, Einstein in 1909 predicted the existence of [...] "radiation friction" [...] which would oppose the movement of matter. He wrote, “radiation will exert pressure {{on both sides of}} the plate. The forces of pressure exerted on the two sides are equal if the plate is at rest. However, if it is in motion, more radiation will be reflected on the surface that is ahead during the motion (<b>front</b> <b>surface)</b> than on the back surface. The backwardacting force of pressure exerted on the <b>front</b> <b>surface</b> is thus larger than the force of pressure acting on the back. Hence, as the resultant of the two forces, there remains a force that counteracts the motion of the plate and that increases with the velocity of the plate. We will call this resultant 'radiation friction' in brief.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Although {{the types}} of telescopes that amateurs build vary widely, {{including}} Refractors, Schmidt–Cassegrains and Maksutovs, the most popular telescope design is the Newtonian reflector, described by Russell W. Porter as “The Poor Man's Telescope”. The Newtonian {{has the advantage of}} being a simple design that allows for maximum size for the minimum expense. And since the design employs a single <b>front</b> <b>surface</b> mirror as its objective it only has one surface that has to be ground and polished, as opposed to three for the Maksutov and four for the refractor and the Schmidt–Cassegrain.

2500|$|In some applications, {{generally}} {{those that}} are cost-sensitive or that require great durability, mirrors are made from a single, bulk material such as polished metal. For technical applications such as laser mirrors, the reflective coating is typically applied by vacuum deposition on the <b>front</b> <b>surface</b> of the substrate. This eliminates refraction and double reflections, also called [...] "ghost reflections" [...] (a weak reflection {{from the surface of}} the glass, and a stronger one from the reflecting metal), and reduces absorption of light by the mirror. Technical mirrors may use a silver, aluminium, or gold coating (the latter typically for infrared mirrors), and achieve reflectivities of 90–95% when new. A protective transparent overcoat may be applied to prevent oxidation of the reflective layer. Applications requiring higher reflectivity or greater durability, where wide bandwidth is not essential, use dielectric coatings, which can achieve reflectivities as high as 99.999% over a narrow range of wavelengths.|$|E

The rear contact is formed by screen-printing a metal paste, typically aluminium. Usually this contact covers the entire rear, though some designs employ a grid pattern. The paste is then fired at several hundred degrees Celsius to form metal electrodes in ohmic contact with the silicon. Some companies use an additional electro-plating step to increase efficiency. After the metal contacts are made, the solar cells are interconnected by flat wires or metal ribbons, and assembled into modules or [...] "solar panels". Solar panels have a sheet of tempered glass on the front, and a polymer encapsulation on the back.|$|E
