5|$|In sport, an iron puddler, Robert Chambers of the company's Walker works, won the {{sculling}} {{championship at}} the 1857 Thames Regatta. The heavy work stirring the iron {{was said to}} have strengthened his arms and shoulders. Chambers also won the return match, held on the Tyne on 19 April 1859, even after a collision with a moored boat left him a <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> behind.|$|E
5|$|Most tornadoes {{take on the}} {{appearance}} of a narrow funnel, a few <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> (meters) across, with a small cloud of debris near the ground. Tornadoes may be obscured completely by rain or dust. These tornadoes are especially dangerous, as even experienced meteorologists might not see them. Tornadoes can appear in many shapes and sizes.|$|E
5|$|Protesters {{began to}} gather outside Tottenham police station, a few <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> from Broadwater Farm, around 1:30am on Sunday morning, 6 October. Four of the station's windows were smashed, but the Jarrett family asked {{the crowd to}} disperse. Later that day, two police {{officers}} were attacked with bricks and paving stones at the Farm, and a police inspector was attacked in his car.|$|E

50|$|The {{next week}} at Mankato the Sioux {{ran away from}} the Mavs as Aaron Schwenzfeier ran for one <b>hundred</b> forty-three <b>yards</b> and Travis Lueck had one <b>hundred</b> thirty-five <b>yards</b> {{receiving}} in the forty-one to twenty-five win.|$|R
50|$|British Railways {{closed the}} station pre-Beeching in 1962 {{and plans for}} a freight use were {{abandoned}} at the same time. Goods trains continue to pass the site for a few <b>hundreds</b> <b>yards</b> northwards, to Round Oak Steel Terminal.|$|R
5|$|The JNA intervened {{directly}} against Croatia for {{the first}} time on 3 July 1991, driving Croatian forces out of Baranja, north of the city of Osijek, and out of Erdut, Aljmaš and Dalj east of Osijek. The advance was followed by intermittent fighting around Osijek, Vukovar and Vinkovci. At several points, JNA positions approached to within several <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> of Osijek city limits.|$|E
5|$|The {{sheer number}} of guns fired {{broadside}} meant a sail battleship could wreck any wooden enemy, holing her hull, knocking down masts, wrecking her rigging, and killing her crew. However, the effective range of the guns was {{as little as a}} few <b>hundred</b> <b>yards,</b> so the battle tactics of sailing ships depended in part on the wind.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} three {{different}} stations {{in the area of}} Filton Abbey Wood. The first, Filton, opened in 1863 just north the site of the current Filton Abbey Wood, and was closed in 1903. A second station was opened a few <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> to the north, and was known as Filton Junction. This station closed in 1996, replaced by Filton Abbey Wood.|$|E
50|$|Following several singles {{releases}} {{on behalf}} of both bands, the label released its first new album in {{six and a half}} years in late 2007 - SixNationState's self-titled debut album. In May 2008, Parka's own debut, Attack of the <b>Hundred</b> <b>Yard</b> Hardman was also released.|$|R
50|$|Tarbolton (Tarbowton) is {{a village}} in South Ayrshire, Scotland. It is near Failford, Mauchline and the same {{distance}} bar a few <b>hundreds</b> <b>yards</b> to Ayr and Kilmarnock. The old Fail Monastery was nearby and Robert Burns connections are strong, including the Bachelors' Club museum.|$|R
50|$|The High Street area {{constitutes}} the sixth most important retail centre in London, and {{is home to}} many restaurants and major retail names. It is pedestrianised {{for most of its}} length, and a conservation area runs down a three <b>hundred</b> <b>yard</b> section. There are three examples of public art in the street, and parks at either end of it.|$|R
5|$|A few <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> {{from the}} airfield, his plane crashed nose {{first into the}} ground. He was quickly freed from the {{aircraft}} by his men, but died in an ambulance minutes later; his orders to return home were found in his jacket pocket. Baker was buried in a small military cemetery near Toul; in 1921, his mother had his remains moved to her family plot in West Laurel Hill Cemetery, Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|At 05:30 on 22 May, the Anglo-Egyptian advance continued, but {{the nature}} of the country, which {{consisted}} mainly of rolling low level sand-hills, with plenty of concealed ground and scattered bushes, reduced visibility down to just a few <b>hundred</b> <b>yards.</b> From the start, large groups of Fur camaliers and cavalry were observed. So instead of sending out his scouts Kelly formed an advance guard of the mounted infantry, a camel company and four Maxim machine guns. At 10:30, the Fur troops were observed in a strong entrenched position around the village of Beringia.|$|E
5|$|Behind the Wells Fargo {{office is}} a powder house which, as of 2011, {{contains}} models of the town, the town's major mills, and its Catholic church. The Catholic and Protestant cemeteries were restored by the Leeds Lion's Club in 1998 and can be visited. Several other original buildings remain, including the Clancy Market, McCormick Store, the two-story Harrison House Hotel, {{and some of the}} mining buildings. Main Street, once a mile long, is now only a few <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> long and is surrounded by private homes.|$|E
50|$|The {{stadium is}} located in Pontificio Oratorio San Pietro, the Vatican's sport complex, in Rome only a few <b>hundred</b> <b>yard</b> from Vatican City as Vatican City is not large enough to house sports fields. It has a {{capacity}} of 500 spectators and is equipped with artificial turf and floodlights. The field is known for having {{a clear view of}} Saint Peter's Basilica.|$|R
50|$|The pier {{was built}} in the 19th century; it {{replaced}} a smaller, earlier pier built a few <b>hundreds</b> <b>yards</b> to the north. A diesel cable winch is situated {{at the top of the}} pier for the purpose of hauling boats from the slipway to the shore and vice versa. The harbour has a total capacity of 18 boats, although only about half of those berths are used each year.|$|R
50|$|Williams is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} greatest wide receivers in school history, after setting 15 records, including career marks with 3,177 receiving yards, 33 touchdowns, 16 one <b>hundred</b> <b>yard</b> receiving games, 11 receptions over 50 yards, the first UL Monroe player to gain over 1,000 yards twice in a career, the top two single-season yardage totals, two of the top four single-season reception totals and the top three single-season touchdown totals.|$|R
5|$|By {{the time}} the train reached Eccles, the day's drizzle had been {{replaced}} by a storm. The doctors carried Huskisson, still on his door, off the train into a torrent of hail and thunder and walked the few <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> to the vicarage, frequently losing their footing as they climbed the deep cutting. Meanwhile, Stephenson and Wilton restarted the train and went on to Manchester to fetch medical assistance.|$|E
5|$|Goodensnake's body is cremated in a {{traditional}} ceremony, while the agents watch from a distance. Mulder shares with Scully his belief that both the culprits in both the current case and Hoover's investigation are werewolves. Scully dismisses this theory and instead credits the belief to clinical lycanthropy. The elder Parker is subsequently ripped apart by an unseen animal outside his home, and Lyle is found naked and unconscious a few <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> away.|$|E
5|$|On the 16th RCT front, at {{the eastern}} end of Easy Red, was another area between strongpoints. This allowed G/16 and the support {{battalion}} to escape complete destruction in their advance up the beach. Nevertheless, most of G/16's 63 casualties for the day came before they had reached the shingle. The other 2nd Battalion company landed in the second wave; H/16 came in a few <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> to the left, opposite the E-3 draw, and suffered for it – they were put out of action for several hours.|$|E
50|$|Technically similar, in {{covering}} the <b>hundred</b> <b>yard</b> dash in New York's Madison Square Garden, Morse {{wanted to put}} the start, middle, and finish of the race in the same picture. He was able to place wiring under the track, but no place existed for situating the cameras. Morse had a hanging box built under the balcony in which he mounted his equipment. His assistant tripped the lights at the required intervals, and Morse made the photograph.|$|R

50|$|Within the one <b>hundred</b> <b>yard</b> {{reach of}} the Catholic Church is a branch of a well known fabric store Yufe's where one can obtain fabrics of {{different}} textures and styles to allow the homeowner to create drapes, cushion covers, bed spreads and clothes if that is their desire. Alternatively, one may employ {{the services of a}} dressmaker or seamstress who may purchase the material and prepare the outfit, thus reducing the time and effort taken by the individual to source an item.|$|R
5|$|The scenery {{of rocky}} headlands, ravines, waterfalls and towering cliffs gained the Exmoor coast {{recognition}} as a Heritage Coast in 1991. The Exmoor Coastal Heaths have been recognised as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) due to the diversity of species present. The path passes the smallest parish church in England, Culbone Church, in Culbone. The path crosses the county boundary into Devon, a few <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> north of the National Park Centre at County Gate.|$|E
5|$|Although the Falaise Gap was {{narrowed to}} a {{distance}} of several <b>hundred</b> <b>yards,</b> attacks and counter-attacks by two battle groups of the 1st Polish Armoured Division and the II SS Panzer Corps on Hill 262 (Mont Ormel) prevented the quick closing of the gap and thousands of German troops escaped. During two days of nearly continuous fighting, Polish forces using artillery barrages and close-quarter fighting, managed to hold off counter-attacks by seven German divisions. On 21 August, elements of the First Canadian Army relieved the Polish survivors and sealed the Falaise Pocket by linking up with the Third US Army. This led to the surrender and capture of the remaining units of the German 7th Army in the pocket.|$|E
5|$|Ever {{since the}} victory against an Egyptian army at the Battle of Tel-el-Kebir, the {{standard}} British tactic against an entrenched position was an approach march {{at night in}} close order to maintain cohesion, followed by deployment into open order within a few <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> of the objective and a frontal attack with the bayonet at first light. Methuen planned to bombard the Boer positions with artillery from 16:50 to 18:30 on 10 December. Following the barrage, the newly arrived Highland Brigade under Major General Wauchope {{was to make a}} night march that would position them to launch a frontal attack on the Boers at dawn the following day. Wauchope had argued for a flanking attack along the Modder River, but had been unable to convince his superior.|$|E

5|$|From 2005 to 2009 a Thomas Heatherwick sculpture, B of the Bang, was {{situated}} {{to the southeast}} of the stadium at the junction of Ashton New Road and Alan Turing Way. Built after the Commonwealth Games to commemorate them, it was the tallest sculpture in the United Kingdom. However, numerous structural problems led to the 184ft. sculpture being dismantled in 2009 for safety reasons. In 2014, money recovered by the Manchester City Council {{as a result of}} lengthy legal battles consequent to this debacle was used to fund a new £341,000 public sculpture a few <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> further south.|$|E
5|$|Hunter's force {{advanced}} {{towards the}} town in a semi-circle formation, composed by the four battalions arranged {{from left to right}} in the following order: the 10th Sudanese, 9th Sudanese, the reduced 3rd Egyptian, and the 11th Sudanese. The artillery battery was with the 3rd Egyptian. The force reached the ridge of the plateau overlooking the town, about three <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> away, at a quarter past six. Major-General Hunter, finding the Mahdist garrison prepared for the assault and entrenched in their defenses, ordered the artillery to bombard their positions, which commenced at six-thirty. However, the artillery proved ineffective, as the guns were unable to strike within the narrow trenches or blast aside the cover behind which the Mahdist infantry waited. Hunter ceased the barrage, and ordered Lieutenant MacDonald to lead his brigade in a general advance. The command to fix bayonets was given, and the troops began an orderly advance across the three <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> that separated them from their objective. However, facing a line of Mahdist riflemen well-protected in their trenches, the soldiers of each advancing battalion were compelled to open fire without direct orders. The uncoordinated volleys of the advancing brigade were moderately effective against the Mahdist riflemen, who had not yet returned fire. When the battalions were about halfway across the three hundred yard stretch, their lines of fire began to converge due to their semi-circle formation, and the 10th Sudanese, on the left, was forced to halt to avoid coming under the fire of the rightmost 11th Sudanese.|$|E
5|$|In 1818 a {{golf course}} was founded on the moor for the Manchester Golf Club, a group of Manchester businessmen, {{some of whom had}} emigrated from Scotland. This was only the second course to be built outside Scotland. The course at that time {{consisted}} of only five holes and had no fairways or greens as the players had to share the ground with other users. The club was very exclusive and by 1825 a club house had been built on Singleton Road. By 1869 the course had increased to nine holes and the club continued playing on the moor until 1862 when a new course was built a few <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> away at Kersal Vale.|$|E
50|$|Initial {{plans for}} fortifications were drawn {{up with the}} {{assistance}} of Captain James Nocquet, chief engineer for General Breckinridge. Along with loaning his engineering staff, Breckinridge also authorized Ruggles to gather needed supplies and tools using the Clinton and Port Hudson railroad, and whatever labor the area could provide for construction. Three different layouts for earthworks were considered, a central fort mounting cannon supported by angled outworks, a line of lunettes arranged along a four <b>hundred</b> <b>yard</b> line, and a continuous ring of redoubts, trenches, and parapets surrounding the entire position.|$|R
