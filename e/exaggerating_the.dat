5|$|The Man-Eating Myth {{was widely}} {{reviewed}} in academic journals and also attracted attention from mainstream press. Views were mixed, with most reviewers highlighting the intentionally provocative {{nature of the}} work. Critics charged Arens with constructing straw man arguments and for <b>exaggerating</b> <b>the</b> methodological problems within anthropology. Although influential, in ensuing decades, increasing archaeological study of cannibalism led many to dismiss Arens' hypothesis.|$|E
5|$|The {{deployment}} of Spitfires to Australia was kept secret {{so that the}} Japanese were not alerted to their presence, and the Australian Government directed that the aircraft {{be referred to as}} Capstans (after the brand of cigarettes) and their Merlin engines as Marvels. General Douglas MacArthur, the commander of Allied forces in the South West Pacific Area, agreed that the Australian Government could choose when to announce the presence of the Spitfires, but warned against <b>exaggerating</b> <b>the</b> impact they were likely to have.|$|E
5|$|Jacobson's case {{attracted}} {{some national}} media attention. Civil liberties advocates supported him, worried {{over what they}} saw as dangerous growth in government police powers during the Reagan and Bush administrations, when law enforcement were alleged to have cracked down on drugs as well as pornography distribution {{at the behest of the}} Religious Right. Operation Looking Glass, the USPS claimed, had netted 147 convictions, but only 35 where evidence was found that the offenders had either been involved in producing child pornography or molested children. Critics claimed that the government was <b>exaggerating</b> <b>the</b> child-porn problem at best and contributing to it at worst, possibly by introducing some consumers to material they might never have developed a taste for otherwise.|$|E

5|$|The {{commander}} of Fort Sumter, South Carolina, Major Robert Anderson, sent {{a request for}} provisions to Washington, and the execution of Lincoln's order to meet that request was seen by the secessionists {{as an act of}} war. On April 12, 1861, Confederate forces fired on Union troops at Fort Sumter, forcing them to surrender, and began the war. Historian Allan Nevins argued that the newly inaugurated Lincoln made three miscalculations: underestimating the gravity of the crisis, <b>exaggerating</b> <b>the</b> strength of Unionist sentiment in the South, and not realizing the Southern Unionists were insisting there be no invasion.|$|E
5|$|The {{surfaces}} {{should be}} broad and simple, {{defined by a}} bold and clear design, accentuated in the important places. The enlargement of the details or their multiplicity is to be feared. By <b>exaggerating</b> <b>the</b> forms, in order to render them more clearly visible, or by enriching them with details, we would destroy {{the proportion of the}} work. Finally, the model, like the design, should have a summarized character, such as one would give to a rapid sketch. Only it is necessary that this character should be the product of volition and study, and that the artist, concentrating his knowledge, should find the form and the line in its greatest simplicity.|$|E
5|$|Las Casas {{has also}} often {{been accused of}} <b>exaggerating</b> <b>the</b> atrocities he {{described}} in the Indies, some scholars holding that the initial population figures given by him were too high, making the population decline look worse than it actually was, and that epidemics of European disease were the prime cause of the population decline, not violence and exploitation. Demographic studies {{such as those of}} colonial Mexico by Sherburne F. Cook in the mid-20th century suggested that the decline {{in the first years of}} the conquest was indeed drastic â€“ ranging between 80 and 90%, due of course to many different causes, but all ultimately traceable to the arrival of the Europeans. The overwhelming main cause was disease introduced by the Europeans. It has also been noted that exaggeration of numbers was the norm in writing in 16th-century accounts, and both contemporary detractors and supporters of Las Casas were guilty of similar exaggerations.|$|E

5|$|One month later, {{while the}} British warship HMS Romney was in port, {{one of the}} tidesmen changed his story: he now claimed {{that he had been}} {{forcibly}} held on the Liberty while it had been illegally unloaded. On June 10, customs officials seized the Liberty. Bostonians were already angry because the captain of the Romney had been impressing colonists, and not just deserters from the Royal Navy, an arguably illegal activity. A riot broke out when officials began to tow the Liberty out to the Romney, which was also arguably illegal. The confrontation escalated when sailors and marines coming ashore to seize the Liberty were mistaken for a press gang. After the riot, customs officials relocated to the Romney, and then to Castle William (an island fort in the harbor), claiming that they were unsafe in town. Whigs insisted that the customs officials were <b>exaggerating</b> <b>the</b> danger so that London would send troops to Boston.|$|E
5|$|The {{evidence}} against the batmen was largely circumstantial: both {{had been seen}} to possess unusually large amounts of gold soon after the column's return, and both had since bought farming rights, paying cash. Daniel said he had won the money in his possession playing cards, while Wilson claimed to have brought his {{with him when he}} came to Rhodesia. Witnesses confirmed that there had been heavy gambling at Inyati camp, in which Daniel and Wilson had actively taken part, both possessing noticeable reserves in gold sovereigns. Sehuloholu claimed in his statement that both of the men he had met in the rear guard had fluently and perfectly spoken to him in Sindebele, but neither of the accused men knew the language, and {{the only member of the}} column who did at a fluent level was a medical orderly who had never been near the rear guard. The prosecutor proposed that Sehuloholu could be <b>exaggerating</b> <b>the</b> standard of Sindebele spoken by the men he had met, pointing out that most of the phrases quoted were actually relatively basic, and did not imply a profound understanding of the language.|$|E

25|$|There {{has also}} been {{criticism}} of the campaign.

25|$|The {{most common}} and {{well-known}} use of corsets is to slim the body and make it conform to a fashionable silhouette. For women, this most frequently emphasizes a curvy figure by reducing the waist and thereby <b>exaggerating</b> <b>the</b> bust and hips. However, in some periods, corsets have been worn to achieve a tubular straight-up-and-down shape, which involved minimizing the bust and hips.|$|E
25|$|During the 1990s, press {{releases}} alleging violent insurrections in Xinjiang and reportedly <b>exaggerating</b> <b>the</b> number of Chinese migrants {{and the number}} of Uyghurs in Xinjiang were made by Soviet-supported former United Revolutionary Front of East Turkestan leader Yusupbek Mukhlisi. Violent attacks were carried out by Turkish-, Afghan- and Central Asian-based groups. A February 1992 Urumqi bus bombing, attributed to the Shock Brigade of the Islamic Reformist Party, resulted in three deaths.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} {{successful}} ageing {{can be traced}} back to the 1950s and was popularised in the 1980s.

25|$|There was {{outrage over}} the closure plan: critics pointed out {{that this was a}} main line, not a small branch railway.

25|$|Real-life {{crime scene}} {{investigators}} and forensic scientists warn that popular television shows like CSI (often specifically citing CSI) {{do not give}} a realistic picture of the work -- wildlly distorting the nature of crime-scene investigators' work, and <b>exaggerating</b> <b>the</b> ease, speed, effectiveness, drama, glamour, influence, scope, and comfort level of their jobs -- which they describe as far more mundane, tedious, limited, and boring, and very commonly failing to solve a crime.|$|E
25|$|Many {{scholars}} {{think these}} numbers are exaggerated (records are inadequate, they are much larger than those from similar societies, soldiers were paid {{by the number of}} enemies they killed and the Han dynasty had an interest in <b>exaggerating</b> <b>the</b> bloodiness of the age before China was unified). Regardless of exaggeration, it seems clear that warfare had become excessive during this period. The bloodshed and misery of the Warring States period goes a long way in explaining China's traditional preference for a united throne.|$|E

In The Effect of Severity of Initiation on Liking for a Group (1956), to qualify for admission to a discussion group, two groups of people underwent an embarrassing initiation, of varied psychologic severity.

Darine {{tells him that}} she has the cure, but she will give it to him only if he promises to love her. Sir Ethais agrees, and observing that one beautiful woman is as good as another, gives Selene's ring to Darine. He takes the potion, and is cured. Sir Phyllon enters, and Sir Ethais accosts him. Their argument escalates, and Sir Ethais turns to Darine to confirm that Sir Phyllon had accused him of cowardice. Darine admits that this was only an artifice. Sir Ethais asks Sir Phyllon's forgiveness and renounces Darine. She implores him to reconsider.|$|E
