25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{different}} forms of validity. Criterion-related validity can be assessed by correlating a measure with a criterion measure theoretically expected to be related. When the criterion measure is collected {{at the same time as}} the measure being validated the goal is to establish concurrent validity; when the criterion is collected later the goal is to establish predictive validity. A measure has construct validity if it is related to measures of other constructs as required by theory. Content validity is a demonstration that the items of a test do an adequate job of covering the domain being measured. In a personnel selection example, test content is based on a defined statement or set of statements of knowledge, skill, ability, or other characteristics obtained <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> analysis.|$|E

A career in business held no appeal; during a weekend vacation with a fellow Princeton graduate, Baker revealed that he felt his life was over, and he would never again experience the thrills of football or hockey. In 1966, author John D. Davies published a biography of Baker, in which he noted that a relative of Baker's could not see a future for him in the post-war world.

500|$|When Samuel White's widow, Anne, died in 1880, she bequeathed {{the estate}} to her late husband's nephew, John Thomas, 6th Baron Massy. The Massys were a Protestant Ascendancy family {{who had come}} to Ireland in 1641 and owned {{extensive}} lands in Counties Limerick, Leitrim and Tipperary. Massy used Killakee House to entertain guests while shooting game on nearby Cruagh and Glendoo mountains. He also used the house to host parties during major events on the Dublin social calendar such as the Dublin Horse Show, the Punchestown Races and the Dublin Castle Season. During these events long lines of guests' carriages could be seen stretched along the road leading to the house. However, as a result of declining rental income and poor investment decisions, John Thomas Massy was in considerable debt when he died in 1915. By the time John Massy's grandson, Hugh Hamon Charles, 8th Baron Massy, inherited the estate, the family's finances were in an irreversible decline and in 1924 he was declared bankrupt and evicted from Killakee House. The Massys initially moved into the Stewards House before taking up residence in Beehive Cottage, the estate's gate lodge, by agreement with the bank. Hamon Massy, unable to find a job on account of his alcoholism became dependent on his wife, Margaret, whose modest salary <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> with the Irish Hospitals' Sweepstake was the family's only income. In the years up to his death in 1958, Hamon Massy, who became known as the [...] "Penniless Peer", could be seen collecting firewood in the woods of his former family estate.|$|E

30|$|We use the {{retrospective}} {{information provided by}} the third wave of SHARE – the Survey on Health, Age and Retirement in Europe - to reconstruct the labour market transitions from age 50 onwards by males aged 55 to 70, who held <b>a</b> career <b>job</b> (defined as <b>a</b> full-time <b>job</b> lasting more than 10 years) at age 50. We find that 8.86 % of the individuals in our sample have transited <b>from</b> <b>a</b> career to <b>a</b> bridge <b>job</b> and eventually to retirement, 0.71 % have retained their career job but switched from full to part-time, 51.53 % have transited directly <b>from</b> <b>a</b> career <b>job</b> to permanent retirement and the remaining 38.90 % are still in their career job. We also highlight that the traditional patterns of retirement – <b>from</b> <b>a</b> career <b>job</b> to permanent withdrawal from the labour force – is much more frequent in Mediterranean Europe (Italy, France and Spain) than in Northern and Central Europe (Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark and Sweden).|$|R
2500|$|A {{possible}} {{window into}} the killer's motives appeared nearly {{a month after the}} event. An apartment manager of a complex about a mile from Huff's residence called police about a possible bomb he found while inspecting dumpsters, although that bomb turned out to be just modeling clay and wires. In the investigation afterwards, police found a handwritten note in the dumpster apparently written by Huff. On June 6, the police released the letter, not yet authenticated, to the media. A week later, the Washington State Patrol's State Crime Lab concluded that it was [...] "highly probable" [...] that the letter was authentic. Arguments in favor of authenticity included the fact that the letter was written on stationery from the apartment complex where the Huff brothers lived and matched several known samples of the killer's writing, according to crime lab experts. The Stranger, an alternative weekly, earlier claimed that the handwriting on the letter appeared to be identical to samples <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> application of Huff's that the periodical had obtained.|$|E
2500|$|Harassment and {{victimisation}} {{cannot be}} justified, but in principle {{there are exceptions}} or justifications for all forms of direct and indirect discrimination. Apart from direct age discrimination which can also be objectively justified, the general rule for direct discrimination, elaborated in EA 2010 Schedule 9, is that an employer may only be exempt if it can show that having a worker fit a particular description is a [...] "genuine occupational requirement". This means the (otherwise) discriminatory practice must pursue a legitimate aim {{in terms of the}} nature of the occupation itself (not the employer's business needs generally) and the practice must be proportionate. The test is stringent. In Etam plc v Rowan a man was turned down for a job at a woman's clothing store, with the excuse that a man should not operate women's change rooms. But this did not count as a genuine occupational requirement because the shift allocation could have been easily changed. By contrast, it was held in Wolf v Stadt Frankfurt am Main that a requirement to be under 30 years old when joining the fire service could be a genuine occupational requirement, to ensure fitness. Controversially, the European Court of Justice has repeatedly said that it is within a member state's margin of discretion to say being male is a genuine occupational requirement for work in the military. This was even so, in Sirdar v The Army Board & Secretary of State for Defence, for a lady who applied to work as a chef in the Royal Marines, because the policy on [...] "interoperability" [...] meant every member had to be capable of combat. Cases involving religion are subject to a special provision, so that if a job's functions require adherence to an organisation's ethos, the organisation has an exemption from direct discrimination. In an action for judicial review of the legislation, Richards J rejected that a faith school would be exempt in any way, rather than an actual religious establishment like a church. Even there, it was rejected that a gay person could be dismissed <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> as a cleaner or bookshop worker, if that was incompatible with the religious [...] "ethos", because the ethos would not be a genuine requirement to carry out the job.|$|E
