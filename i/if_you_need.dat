25|$|This is {{something}} that a Muslim gynecologist can tell you <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> to or not… There {{used to be a}} lady who used to do this for women, or, I mean, young girls. She is expected to cut only the tip of the sexual sensitive part in the girl, so that she is not hypersexually active. This is the purpose... you see in societies where circumcision of girls is completely prohibited, hypersexuality takes over the entire society, and a woman is not satisfied with one person, or two, or three. This, God forbid, is now happening even in Muslim societies where they prohibit circumcision. They use a mistake in practice to prohibit the tradition, and they end up causing a lot of damage on the extreme side of the sexual life of the woman.|$|E

500|$|Metalholic said 'I’m back…” [...] I can’t {{think of}} a more {{appropriate}} way to flow into the second track “Tragic Magic.” [...] Ronnie Radke is most definitely back {{and he is not}} afraid to tell you so.' This fairly slow tempo song obviously takes a few jabs at Radke’s former band Escape the Fate, but overall is a solid melodic song, [...] The third track “The Drug in Me is You” was the second single and the band’s first video and might I add a very entertaining video. “The Drug in Me is You,” is a nicely constructed musical performance that is just flat out catchy. [...] To me the song is about something most people can relate to, the battle you have with yourself, with your morality, with your demons. [...] We all know that we can be our own worst enemy and the only person that you truly have to blame in many instances is yourself. [...] “Trying to consume, the drug in me is you and I’m so high on misery can’t you see,” evokes the feeling that you are your own drug, the creator of your misery and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> to point fingers at someone try looking in the mirror first. [...] “If we are born to die and we all die to live, then what’s the point of living life if life just contradicts?” [...] Questions we all ask when we pick ourselves up off the floor and do the only thing we can do, try again. [...] Life is what you make of it, if you have lost yourself, it is up to you to find your way again. [...] I got all profound there for a second, it happens.|$|E

[...] She also made an uncredited cameo appearance in Mother's Day.|$|E
2500|$|On September 11, Afzali called Zazi's father.

2500|$|In his 2015 book, Farage {{reflected}} {{that based on}} his experiences, [...] "the NHS is so over-stretched {{that if you can}} afford private health care, you should take it, particularly for diagnostics and preventative medicine. In the NHS, the system is so battered and poorly run that unless you are really lucky, you will fall through the cracks. The NHS is, however, astonishingly good at critical care. But what testicular cancer taught me is that the NHS will probably let you down <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> screening, fast diagnosis and an operation at a time that suits you". He supports reform within the NHS, saying that its resources have become stretched due to increased immigration, and blaming Labour for high costs of new hospitals built through private finance initiatives.|$|E
2500|$|At 3:44p.m. EDT, Benoit called Guerrero back, {{stating that}} he had not {{answered}} the call because he {{was on the phone with}} Delta Air Lines changing his flight. Benoit stated {{that he had}} a stressful day due to Nancy and Daniel [...] "being sick from food poisoning." [...] Guerrero then replied with [...] "All right man, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> to talk, I'm here for you." [...] Benoit ended the conversation by saying [...] "I love you, Chavo." [...] During a 2014 appearance on Chris Jericho's Talk is Jericho podcast, Guerrero said Benoit sounded [...] "off" [...] when he talked to him, especially when he said [...] "I love you". Another co-worker who often traveled with Benoit called him from outside the Houston airport and Benoit answered. Benoit told the coworker that Nancy was vomiting blood and that Daniel was also vomiting.|$|E
2500|$|Upon its Western release, Xenoblade Chronicles X {{earned an}} {{aggregated}} review score of 84/100 at Metacritic, indicating [...] "generally favorable" [...] reception. Nintendo Life praised the game's battle system, deep upgrade pathways, vast world size, and graphics, but criticized the occasional difficulty spike and fetch quest. IGN scored it 8.2/10, stating that, [...] "Out in the wilderness, Xenoblade Chronicles X presents seemingly endless reasons {{to fight and}} wander the planet.", and that [...] "Xenoblade Chronicles X is a massive RPG with enough surface area, sub quests, and customization to keep you busy". However, the game was criticized by IGN with a narrative that [...] "makes important moments feel bland, with low production value that robs emotional scenes of any dramatic weight". Nintendo World Report scored it 9.5/10, stating that it is [...] "required playing for anyone with the slightest inclination toward RPGs, and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> to buy the system then do it" [...] as it is [...] "an {{essential part of the}} Wii U library." ...|$|E
