5|$|Al-Qazdughli, a {{powerful}} Mamluk bey, sponsored several additions and renovations {{in the early}} 18th century. Under <b>his</b> <b>direction,</b> a riwaq for blind students was added in 1735. He also sponsored the rebuilding of the Turkish and Syrian riwaqs, both of which had originally been built by Qaytbay.|$|E
5|$|Another early {{application}} of the Reuleaux triangle, by Leonardo da Vinci circa 1514 (or possibly {{by one of his}} followers at <b>his</b> <b>direction),</b> was a world map in which the spherical surface of the earth was divided into eight octants, each flattened into the shape of a Reuleaux triangle.|$|E
5|$|In June 1895, at an {{organizational}} meeting White was appointed {{the president of}} the board for the Douglass Memorial Hospital. Under <b>his</b> <b>direction,</b> he appropriated state funds for the hospital in 1898 from Alexander K. Pedrick of the State Senate. Having succeeded in procuring the funds, White resigned from his position but maintained a seat on the board until his death on November 11, 1902.|$|E

5|$|Jacob L. Beilhart (March 4, 1867 – November 24, 1908) was {{the founder}} and leader of a communitarian group known as the Spirit Fruit Society. Beilhart {{believed}} that jealousy, materialism, {{and the fear of}} losing another's love were at the root of much of the illness in the world. Under <b>his</b> <b>direction,</b> the Spirit Fruit Society sought to model and practice those beliefs.|$|E
5|$|After the war Cockcroft {{became the}} {{director}} of the Atomic Energy Research Establishment (AERE) at Harwell, where the low-powered, graphite-moderated GLEEP became the first nuclear reactor to operate in western Europe when it was started on 15 August 1947. This was followed by BEPO in 1948. Harwell was involved {{in the design of the}} reactors and the chemical separation plant at Windscale. Under <b>his</b> <b>direction</b> it took part in frontier fusion research, including the ZETA program. His insistence that the chimney stacks of the Windscale reactors be fitted with filters was mocked as Cockcroft's Folly until the core of one of the reactors ignited and released radionuclides during the Windscale fire of 1957.|$|E
5|$|Brigadier David Whitehead of the 26th Infantry Brigade assumed {{responsibility}} for Lae after its capture. Under <b>his</b> <b>direction,</b> garbage was burned, Japanese bodies were cremated, and bomb craters, shell holes and Japanese trench latrines were filled in. American and Australian malaria control units sprayed mosquito breeding grounds. He handed over {{responsibility for}} the town to US Brigadier General Carl W. Connell, the commander of US Base E. The advance party of Lieutenant Colonel O. A. Kessels' Australian Lae Base Sub Area headquarters arrived by air on 18 September, followed by the main body by sea on 30 September. To control the Australian and American bases, Herring created the Lae Fortress under Major General Edward Milford.|$|E

5|$|Gielgud {{continued}} to try, without much success, {{to find new}} plays that suited him as an actor, but <b>his</b> <b>direction</b> of Peter Shaffer's first play, Five Finger Exercise (1958), received acclaim. While in the US for the Shaffer play, Gielgud revived Much Ado About Nothing, this time with Margaret Leighton as his Beatrice. Most of the New York critics praised the production, and they all praised the co-stars. He gave his first performances on television during 1959, in Rattigan's The Browning Version for CBS and N C Hunter's A Day by the Sea for ITV. He appeared in more than fifty more plays on television {{over the next four}} decades.|$|E
5|$|He used actors {{of diverse}} backgrounds, from famous film stars {{to people who}} {{had never seen a}} film (as in Aparajito). Robin Wood and others have lauded him as the best {{director}} of children, pointing out memorable performances in the roles of Apu and Durga (Pather Panchali), Ratan (Postmaster) and Mukul (Sonar Kella). Depending on the talent or experience of the actor, Ray varied the intensity of <b>his</b> <b>direction,</b> from virtually nothing with actors such as Utpal Dutt, to using the actor as a puppet (Subir Banerjee as young Apu or Sharmila Tagore as Aparna). Actors who had worked for Ray praised his customary trust but said he could also treat incompetence with total contempt.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{was born}} in Winchester Castle on 1 October 1207. He was the eldest son of King John and Isabella of Angoulême. Little is known of Henry's early life. He was {{initially}} looked after by a wet nurse called Ellen {{in the south of}} England, away from John's itinerant court, and probably had close ties to his mother. Henry had four legitimate younger brothers and sisters – Richard, Joan, Isabella and Eleanor – and various older illegitimate siblings. In 1212 his education was entrusted to Peter des Roches, the Bishop of Winchester; under <b>his</b> <b>direction,</b> Henry was given military training by Philip D'Aubigny and taught to ride, probably by Ralph of St Samson.|$|E

5|$|In 1849 Bennett {{became the}} {{founding}} {{president of the}} Bach Society in London, whose early members included Sir George Smart, John Pyke Hullah, William Horsley, Potter and Davison. Under <b>his</b> <b>direction</b> the Society gave the first English performance of Bach's St Matthew Passion on 6 April 1854. Further performances of the Passion were given by the Society in 1858 and 1862, the latter coinciding {{with the publication of}} Bennett's own edition of the work, with a translation of the text into English by his pupil Helen Johnston.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Newsom {{pushed for}} a state law to allow {{communities}} in California to create policy restricting certain breeds of dogs. He requested that then state senator Jackie Speier introduce a change to then-existing California law, which stated that counties could not target specific breeds of dog. The animal control agency under <b>his</b> <b>direction</b> created a working dog task force report that cited Denver, Colorado, as a best practice for a law in California.|$|E
5|$|Nargis was the director's {{first choice}} {{for the role of}} Radha, and despite only being aged 26 at the time, she played the role of the new wife, young single mother and an aged mother of two sons. Nargis—the reigning queen of Hindi cinema at the time—had started her career in a leading role with Khan's Taqdeer (1943) and acted under <b>his</b> <b>direction</b> in Humayun (1945) and Andaz (1949). Mother India is {{generally}} regarded as Nargis's best performance and was her last major film before retirement after marriage.|$|E

5|$|Peter Acworth founded Fucking Machines as {{the second}} website within his company Cybernet Entertainment, Inc., and it {{launched}} on September 25, 2000. Cybernet Entertainment subsequently began to use the name Kink.com for business purposes. The director and webmaster of the site, who uses the professional name Tomcat, received a university degree in film and media, and had experience with filmmaking and operating the sex-machines. He began work at Kink.com as a production assistant. He focused <b>his</b> <b>direction</b> style on filming the female participants experiencing sincere pleasure from the machines.|$|E
5|$|Pick had {{a strong}} {{interest}} in design and its use in public life. He steered the development of the London Underground's corporate identity by commissioning eye-catching commercial art, graphic design and modern architecture, establishing a highly recognisable brand, including the first versions of the roundel and typeface still used today. Under <b>his</b> <b>direction,</b> the UERL's Underground network and associated bus services expanded considerably reaching out into new areas and stimulating the growth of London's suburbs. His impact on the growth of London between the world wars led to him being likened to Baron Haussmann and Robert Moses.|$|E
5|$|Ray won 21 {{awards for}} <b>his</b> <b>direction,</b> {{including}} seven Bengal Film Journalists' Association Awards, six Indian National Film Awards, two Silver Bear at the Berlin International Film Festival, and two Golden Gate Awards at the San Francisco International Film Festival. In addition to directing, Ray was a music composer and also wrote the screenplay, lyrics, and dialogues for several films. He won twelve awards for his screenplay writing, including one posthumous award in 1994, one {{award for his}} original story idea, seven awards for his dialogues, five awards for his music compositions, and two awards for lyric-writing.|$|E

5|$|Count Karl-Wilhelm Finck von Finckenstein, Frederick the Great's prime minister, {{believed}} that any Austrian acquisition in Bavaria would shift {{the balance of}} power in the Holy Roman Empire, diminishing Prussia's influence. Prussia's recent gains had been hard-won: thirty years earlier, Frederick had engaged in protracted wars in Silesia and Bohemia, resulting in Prussia's annexation of most of Silesia, and now, with the economy and society modernizing under <b>his</b> <b>direction,</b> Prussia was emerging as a world power. In the Silesian Wars and the Seven Years' War, Frederick had earned a new, if grudging, respect for his kingdom's military and diplomatic prowess from the European powers of France, Russia, Britain and Austria. To protect Prussia's status and territory, Finck and Frederick constructed an alliance with the Electorate of Saxony, ostensibly to defend the rights of Charles II August, Duke of Zweibrücken.|$|E
5|$|Dave Sexton {{replaced}} Docherty {{as manager}} {{in the summer of}} 1977. Despite major signings, including Joe Jordan, Gordon McQueen, Gary Bailey, and Ray Wilkins, the team failed to achieve any significant results; they finished in the top two in 1979–80 and lost to Arsenal in the 1979 FA Cup Final. Sexton was dismissed in 1981, even though the team won the last seven games under <b>his</b> <b>direction.</b> He was replaced by Ron Atkinson, who immediately broke the British record transfer fee to sign Bryan Robson from West Bromwich Albion. Under Atkinson, Manchester United won the FA Cup twice in three years – in 1983 and 1985. In 1985–86, after 13 wins and two draws in its first 15 matches, the club was favourite to win the league, but finished in fourth place. The following season, with the club in danger of relegation by November, Atkinson was dismissed.|$|E
5|$|Early in 1944, with an Allied {{invasion}} of Nazi-occupied Europe becoming ever more likely, Field Marshal Erwin Rommel {{was assigned to}} improve the wall's defences. Believing the existing coastal fortifications to be entirely inadequate, he immediately began strengthening them. Rommel's main concern was Allied air power. He had seen it first-hand when fighting the British and Americans in North Africa, and it had left a profound impression on him. He feared that any German counterattack would be broken up by Allied aircraft long before it could make a difference. Under <b>his</b> <b>direction,</b> hundreds of reinforced concrete pillboxes were built on the beaches, or sometimes slightly inland, to house machine guns, antitank guns, and light and heavy artillery. Land mines and antitank obstacles were planted on the beaches, and underwater obstacles and naval mines were placed in waters just offshore. The intent was to destroy the Allied landing craft before they could unload on the beaches.|$|E
