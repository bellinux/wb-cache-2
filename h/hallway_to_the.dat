25|$|Inside this residence, {{the house}} {{originally}} {{had a very}} simple interior, with a large living room {{to the right of}} the front door, a simple dining room straight ahead, a long <b>hallway</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left of the front door, a simple spiral staircase in the front hall, and a small kitchen and servants' quarters in the back (now a bigger kitchen). In the interior of the house, the forms of the rooms were simple but combined to make a more complex structure like Breuer and Gropius advocated. The house has four bedrooms and four bathrooms.|$|E
2500|$|Much of the cloister area is {{occupied}} by the [...] "Museo Virrenal" [...] (Colonial Era) founded in 1925 in what were the portico, the kitchen the refectory and the <b>hallway</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> refectory. It has three main halls which give a detailed explanation {{of the construction of}} the site, the lives of the monks and the collection of paintings and religious objects that are on display. The museum contains more than 120 pieces. Many of the religious artwork and objects are in the third hall and include furniture, cloaks, and other religious garb (some embroidered in gold thread), sculptures in stone, wood and corn stalk paste, and oils from the 16th to the 19th centuries.|$|E
2500|$|The new {{foundation}} {{was made}} of steel-reinforced concrete with pilings sunk [...] to [...] The [...] "new" [...] Number 10 consisted of about 60% new materials; the remaining 40% was either restored or replicas of originals. Many rooms and sections of the new building were reconstructed exactly {{as they were in}} the old Number 10. These included: the garden floor, the door and entrance foyer, the stairway, the <b>hallway</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Cabinet Room, the Cabinet Room, the garden and terrace, the Small and Large State Rooms and the three reception rooms. The staircase, however, was rebuilt and simplified. Steel was hidden inside the columns in the Pillared Drawing Room to support the floor above. The upper floors were modernised and the 3rd floor extended over Numbers 11 and 12 to allow more living space. As many as 40 coats of paint were stripped from the elaborate cornices in the main rooms revealing details unseen for almost 200 years in some cases.|$|E
50|$|Counting <b>Hallways</b> <b>To</b> <b>The</b> Left is Embrace The End's first {{full-length}} album. It {{was released}} on June 28, 2005 on the independent label Abacus Recordings. It was also released on colored vinyl by Man Alive.|$|R
50|$|Designed by Duplessis and Labelle, it is {{a normal}} side {{platform}} station built partially in tunnel, with access through a deep open cut leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> single entrance. Murals by Guy Montpetit are exhibited in the entrance building and <b>the</b> <b>hallways</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> stairwell.|$|R
50|$|The {{commission}} dedicated {{the bust}} of William Frederick Cody on June 12, 1969, {{and placed his}} bust {{in the last of}} the six niches of the Great Hall. The commission placed subsequent busts on limestone plinths throughout the second floor courtyard <b>hallways</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north and south of the legislative chambers.|$|R
60|$|He {{slipped into}} {{part of his}} clothing, and, taking the water pitcher, made {{his way through the}} <b>hallway</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nearest of the bathrooms. Here he {{obtained}} the coldest drink possible, and then, filling the pitcher, started to return to dormitory No. 12.|$|E
60|$|Leaving {{the others}} to settle down in the rooms as best they could, Fred and Jack hurried through the <b>hallway</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> main {{corridor}} of {{the second floor of}} the Hall. Old cadets and new pupils were coming and going in all directions, and many were the glances of curiosity directed towards the Rovers.|$|E
60|$|The boys took a walk, and {{purposely}} {{kept out}} of the way of Dave and Roger. They did not return to the Hall until fifteen minutes before the first bell for supper. Then they came in by a side entrance and passed swiftly up the stairs and along the <b>hallway</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> room occupied by Job Haskers.|$|E
50|$|On the interior, {{the central}} lobby has a marble counter with <b>hallways</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> men's and women's {{facilities}} on either side. Mirrors cover {{the walls in}} the lobby. The floor of the sun porch is covered with quarry tile, {{and most of the}} remaining floors in the building are finished with acrylic tile. Ceilings are concrete and painted plaster. Interior walls are brick and hollow tile finished with plaster.|$|R
30|$|Disadvantage: {{after death}} occurs, the patient’s body must be wheeled rapidly through <b>the</b> <b>hallways</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{operating}} room, creating {{an atmosphere of}} urgency that is not conducive <b>to</b> <b>the</b> serenity desirable under these circumstances. Extubation in the ICU may per se contribute <b>to</b> <b>the</b> failure of organ retrieval, thereby jeopardizing the reciprocal commitments made by <b>the</b> healthcare team <b>to</b> <b>the</b> family and by <b>the</b> family <b>to</b> <b>the</b> last wishes of the patient.|$|R
50|$|Internally {{the house}} {{consists}} of a wide, central arched <b>hallway</b> with <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right a living and dining room, each with a cedar fireplace, and <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left three bedrooms.|$|R
60|$|Just as it {{had done}} before, when Bridge and The Oskaloosa Kid had taken refuge there with the girl, the THING moved down the <b>hallway</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> closed door. The {{dragging}} chain marked each foot of its advance. If it made other sounds they were drowned by the clanking of the links over the time roughened flooring.|$|E
60|$|Breaking {{the thought}} off abruptly, he passed down the dim <b>hallway</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{door of the}} club-rooms. He raised the axe {{and was about to}} smash the lock when he espied a key in the keyhole. The door was not locked. Lane set down the axe and noiselessly turned the knob and peeped in. The first room was dark, but the door on the {{opposite}} side was ajar, and through it Lane saw the larger lighted room and the shiny floor. Moving figures crossed the space. Removing the key, Lane slipped inside the room and locked the door. Then he tip-toed to the opposite door.|$|E
6000|$|Despite the superlative snappiness of Mr. Silberfarb's dress-suits his {{establishment}} was a loft over a delicatessen, {{approached by}} a splintery stairway along which hung shabby signs announcing the upstairs offices of [...] "J. L. & T. J. O'Regan, Private Detectives," [...] "The Zenith Spiritualist Church, Messages by Rev. Lulu Paughouse," [...] "The International Order of Live Ones, Seattle Wigwam," [...] and [...] "Mme. Lavourie, Sulphur Baths." [...] The dead air of the hallway suggested petty crookedness. Milt felt {{that he ought to}} fight somebody but, there being no one to fight, he banged along the flapping boards of the second-floor <b>hallway</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground-glass door of Silberfarb the Society Tailor, who was also, as an afterthought on a straggly placard, [...] "Pressng & Cleang While U Wait." ...|$|E
50|$|Construction of Skyline Middle School And Smithland Elementary was {{completed}} in 2008. The schools are distinctly separate student bodies, but are located within one physically consolidated building. The fifth grade {{is located on the}} middle school side in <b>the</b> central connecting <b>hallway,</b> <b>to</b> allow <b>the</b> fifth grade <b>to</b> return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> elementary student body - should the school system decide to change grade configuration.|$|R
2500|$|On May 21, 2013, Aunor celebrated her 60th {{birthday}} dubbed as [...] "Nora at 60" [...] at the Meralco Multi-Purpose Hall. The venue {{was transformed}} into a virtual museum as posters of her classic films adorned the lobby and <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ballroom.|$|R
50|$|Constructed of granite, {{the tomb}} has a {{rectangular}} base surmounted by a 117 ft-high obelisk, and a semicircular receiving room, on one end, with the semicircular crypt {{on the opposite}} side. A bronze reproduction of sculptor Gutzon Borglum's head of Lincoln in the U.S. Capitol rests on a pedestal {{in front of the}} entrance way. Four flights of balustraded stairs—two flanking the entrance at the front and two at <b>the</b> rear—lead <b>to</b> a level terrace. The balustrade extends around <b>the</b> terrace <b>to</b> form a parapet where several statues are located. Inside the ground level entrance is a rotunda with connecting <b>hallways</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> crypt. Marble is used throughout the interior and several well-known, specially cast statues of Lincoln are displayed. Stained glass windows adorn the crypt.|$|R
6000|$|Presently the automobile, after {{speeding}} up the asphalt of Grant Avenue, stopped before the new house. In spite of the change that house had made in my life, in three weeks I had become amazingly used to it; yet I had an odd feeling that Christmas eve as I stood under the portico with my key in the door, the same feeling of the impersonality of the place which I had experienced before. Not that for one moment I would have exchanged it for the smaller house we had left. I opened the door. How often, in that other house, I had come in the evening seeking quiet, my brain occupied with a problem, only to be annoyed by the romping of the children on the landing above. A noise in one end of it echoed to the other. But here, as I entered the hall, all was quiet: a dignified, deep-carpeted stairway swept upward before me, and on either side were wide, empty rooms; and in the subdued light {{of one of them}} I saw a dark figure moving silently about--the butler. He came forward to relieve me, deftly, of my hat and overcoat. Well, I had it at last, this establishment to which I had for so long looked forward. And yet that evening, as I hesitated in the hall, I somehow was unable to grasp that it was real and permanent, the very solidity of the walls and doors paradoxically suggested transientness, the butler a flitting ghost. How still the place was! Almost oppressively still. I recalled oddly a story of a peasant who, yearning for the great life, had stumbled upon an empty palace, its tables set with food in golden dishes. Before two days had passed he had fled from it in horror back to his crowded cottage and his drudgery in the fields. Never once had the sense of possession of the palace been realized. Nor did I feel that I possessed this house, though I had the deeds of it in my safe and the receipted bills in my files. It eluded me; seemed, in my bizarre mood of that evening, almost to mock me. [...] "You have built me," [...] it seemed to say, [...] "but I am stronger than you, because you have not earned me." [...] Ridiculous, when the years of my labour and the size of my bank account were considered! Such, however, is the verbal expression of my feeling. Was the house empty, after all? Had something happened? With a slight panicky sensation I climbed the stairs, with their endless shallow treads, to hurry through the silent <b>hallway</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> schoolroom. Reassuring noises came faintly through the heavy door. I opened it. Little Biddy was careening round and round, crying out:--"To-morrow's Chris'mas! Santa Claus is coming tonight." ...|$|E
5000|$|Also, the <b>hallway</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{utility room}} {{was used as}} part of [...] "The Factory" [...] task.|$|E
5000|$|At its peak, all {{available}} spaces for exhibits were rented out, including {{the balcony of}} Civic Auditorium, and the <b>hallway</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> restrooms in Brooks Hall (where Bob Wallace ("Quicksoft") introduced [...] "PC Write").|$|E
50|$|One <b>hallway</b> is {{dedicated}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Christmas card collection Rangel designed for UNICEF and the New York Graphic Society, {{which gave him}} international recognition.|$|R
25|$|Inside, the house's decor {{reflects}} later Victorian stylings, due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> era {{in which}} it was rebuilt. The walls are plaster on lath; the floorboards are thin oak. The woodwork, particularly the mantels, use Eastlake decorative motifs. In <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> next <b>to</b> <b>the</b> main staircase is the church's safe. The basement is, like the church's, unfinished.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — <b>To</b> our knowledge, <b>the</b> indoor {{location}} system which currently achieves {{the best performance}} using inexpensive offthe-shelf equipment locates a mobile within 1. 5 meters with probability 77 % in hallways. Even while maintaining this accuracy, the system often reports logical errors such as the mobile in the wrong cubicle of an office or even {{on the wrong side}} of a wall when broadening the domain of application to within rooms. We propose an extension of the work using the same Markov localization framework, however incorporating system dynamics (necessitating no post-processing of the output) and motion constraints which implicitly encode the physical properties of the survey area. Our system retains the advantages of its predecessor of low cost, wireless LAN connectivity and security, and largescale deployment, however extending the survey area from simple <b>hallways</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> whole office environment, while maintaining the same precision without logical errors.

50|$|Two third-grade students, {{chosen as}} {{classroom}} helpers, were {{walking down the}} <b>hallway</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> office to deliver the morning attendance sheet as the shooting began. Teacher Abbey Clements pulled both children into her classroom, where they hid.|$|E
50|$|On August 12, 1936, {{at the age}} of 63 Inspector John Edward Benson {{died from}} a heart attack. The Board of {{education}} decided to honour Mr. Benson by renaming Wyandotte Street School, giving it its current name, J.E. Benson School. A commemorative plaque can be seen hung in the <b>hallway</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Auditorium.|$|E
50|$|There {{is a small}} {{gift shop}} {{associated}} with the chapel; income goes to support the nuns and the chapel. There are also two doors in carved wood, designed by Matisse, for the confessionals. Along the <b>hallway</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gift shop are photos of Matisse designing the chapel. There are also some of Matisse's original sketches for the Stations and vestments.|$|E
50|$|Embrace the End were a metalcore {{band from}} Sacramento, California, formed in 1999. Originally {{consisting}} of only four members, the band went through several line-up changes, {{at one point}} having {{as many as six}} members, including two vocalists. However, shortly after the departure of vocalist Pat Piccolo following the release of their major label debut in 2005, they decided to continue with only Jesse Alford on vocals. Throughout their history, they featured members of the bands First Blood, Killing the Dream, and Alcatraz. After a series of small independent releases with various line-ups, Counting <b>Hallways</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Left was released on CD in summer 2005 on Abacus Records. Steady touring for band occurred {{in the years that followed}} across the United States, through the release of their second and final album Ley Lines in 2008. The band has since been on indefinite hiatus, engaging in various independent musical projects.|$|R
25|$|He {{then held}} his classmates hostage before he allowed two {{students}} <b>to</b> leave <b>the</b> classroom shortly after. He then allowed students <b>to</b> leave <b>the</b> room {{in groups of}} two every minute, and allowed the last five hostages <b>to</b> leave <b>the</b> classroom at 3:01p.m. He himself walked outside of the classroom, where he surrendered to two police officers waiting in <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> adjacent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> classroom.|$|R
50|$|Like {{everything}} else in Morgans, the 114 guest rooms steered away from formulaic institutional design. To update guest lodgings, Ms. Putman began in the hotel corridors, which are covered in wool carpet in rich taupe with a black-and-white checkerboard patterned border. Guest room doors are of French custom-birdseye maple. With only four to eight rooms per floor, each <b>hallway</b> contributes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hotel's residential feel.|$|R
5000|$|In 2008 renovations {{began in}} the science wing, the auditorium, the locker rooms, and turned the stage in the {{cafeteria}} into the new weight room. The old weight room is now a technology room. The Freeman entrance was also renovated, adding a larger <b>hallway</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> exit {{as well as a}} handicap ramp. All the renovations were complete by September 2010.~ ...|$|E
50|$|The private rooms {{comprise}} a master bedroom and second bedroom opening off the central hall, and a side passage leading west {{from the central}} <b>hallway</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dressing room, bathroom, and another bedroom. A small bedroom at {{the northwest corner of}} the house is accessed from the now enclosed rear verandah. There is another room, possibly a former bedroom, which also opens off the back verandah, but has been modified substantially.|$|E
50|$|The Sherlock Holmes Museum is {{situated}} within an 1815 townhouse {{very similar to}} the 221B described in the stories and is located between 237 and 241 Baker Street. It displays exhibits in period rooms, wax figures and Holmes memorabilia, with the famous study overlooking Baker Street the highlight of the museum. The description of the house can be found throughout the stories, including the 17 steps leading from the ground-floor <b>hallway</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> first-floor study.|$|E
50|$|Downstairs is the entrance, a <b>hallway</b> leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> laundry with shower, kitchen, {{bathroom}} with toilet, {{dining room and}} terrace. Upstairs are two bedrooms (other homes in the Casa Bloc {{have three or four}} bedrooms, a variable that was expected <b>to</b> meet <b>the</b> needs of families). All rooms are exterior, with natural light and ventilation. The house also has openings {{on both sides of the}} block, allowing easy cross ventilation.|$|R
2500|$|Inside many {{original}} finishes remain. The lobby {{has been}} restored to its original appearance. From <b>the</b> lobby <b>hallways</b> lead <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Garden Terrace restaurant in a western annex, with an adjacent outdoor terrace south of the swimming pool. The first floor {{is also home to}} several meeting spaces, including the [...] Grand Ballroom in the northeast corner of the rear block, the only aboveground ballroom in Aspen, with [...] ceilings.|$|R
50|$|In the 1930s the {{residence}} was remodeled, updating {{the kitchen and}} creating a master suite built over the garage. One of the original bedrooms was reduced in size and a closet eliminated {{to make way for}} a <b>hallway</b> leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> new suite, which consisted of a dressing chamber, bathroom, and sleeping chamber. The addition incorporated the same casement windows of diamond-shaped leaded glass prevalent in the rest of the house.|$|R
