40|$|We examine {{differences}} {{in the structure of}} wages between domestic <b>establishments</b> and foreign-owned <b>establishments</b> in Japan. Our empirical analysis uses high-quality wage datasets from the Japanese government. We construct a large employer-employee matched database consisting of 50, 000 <b>establishments</b> matched with a sample of approximately 1 million workers in the year 1998. Our results confirm that foreign-owned <b>establishments</b> in Japan pay higher wages than domestic <b>establishments</b> even after accounting for human capital and industry composition. We estimate that a one percentage increase in foreign ownership share of equity raises wages by 0. 3 percent. Our results also highlight the distinction in the structure of wages between domestic and foreign-owned <b>establishments.</b> Tenure effects on wages are considerably weaker among foreign-owned <b>establishments,</b> where wages are determined more by general skills as observed by the higher returns to education and work experience. These effects become more pronounced among <b>establishments</b> with a higher share of foreign ownership. Women in foreign-owned <b>establishments</b> earn more than women in domestic <b>establishments,</b> resulting in a smaller gender wage gap among foreign-owned <b>establishments.</b> Given the high degree of gender segregation and the lack of long-term prospects for women in Japan, foreign-owned <b>establishments</b> may be one source of “brain-drain ” for highly-skilled women in the Japanese labor market...|$|R

Relying on unique data that cover all <b>establishments,</b> firms and individuals in the Danish private sector, {{we are able to}} distil a number of different subsets from the total set of new <b>establishments</b> – subsets which allow us to more precisely capture the "truly new" or "entrepreneurial" <b>establishments</b> than in previous studies. Using these data, we find that while new <b>establishments</b> in general account for one third of the gross job creation in the economy, entrepreneurial <b>establishments</b> are responsible for around 25 % of this, and thus only account for about 8 % of total gross job creation in the economy. However, entrepreneurial <b>establishments</b> seem to generate more additional jobs than other new <b>establishments</b> in the years following entry. Finally, the jobs generated by entrepreneurial <b>establishments</b> are to a large extent low-wage jobs, as they are not found to contribute to the growth in average wages. job creation; entrepreneurial establishments; wage growth...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} location {{dynamics of}} logistics <b>establishments</b> {{in relation to}} spatial cluster- ing. Such an analysis is relevant for both decision makers within logistics firms and regional policy makers, as co-located logistics <b>establishments</b> as well as {{society as a whole}} can benefit from co-location of logistics <b>establishments.</b> For this analysis, longitudinal empirical data on logistics <b>establishments</b> in a Dutch province are used. Six general conclusions are drawn on spatial concen- tration and location decisions of logistic firms. First, logistics employment spatially concentrates in particular areas, called Absolute and Relative Concentration areas (AREC areas). Second, larger logistics <b>establishments</b> locate relatively often in AREC areas. Third, logistics <b>establishments</b> that relocate within the province locate relatively more in AREC areas than in other areas, while new logistics <b>establishments</b> do not. Fourth, logistics <b>establishments</b> from AREC areas are more likely to relocate in AREC areas than <b>establishments</b> from non-AREC areas. Hence, experience mat- ters in location decisions of logistics firms. Fifth, transport <b>establishments</b> locate relatively often in emerging AREC areas. Finally, data on employment growth show that intermodal container terminals attract logistics employment, in their direct vicinity as well as on a municipal level.
