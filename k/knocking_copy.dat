The song debuted on the UK Singles Chart on 18 September 2004 at number-one, with sales of 35,435 <b>copies,</b> <b>knocking</b> Nelly's single [...] "My Place" [...] off the top spot.

2500|$|Reciprocal sign {{epistasis}} {{also leads}} to genetic suppression whereby two deleterious mutations are less harmful together than either one on its own, i.e. one compensates for the other. This term can also apply sign epistasis where the double mutant has a phenotype intermediate between {{those of the}} single mutants, {{in which case the}} more severe single mutant phenotype is suppressed by the other mutation or genetic condition. [...] For example, in a diploid organism, a hypomorphic (or partial loss-of-function) mutant phenotype can be suppressed by <b>knocking</b> out one <b>copy</b> of a gene that acts oppositely in the same pathway. [...] In this case, the second gene is described as a [...] "dominant suppressor" [...] of the hypomorphic mutant; [...] "dominant" [...] because the effect is seen when one wild-type copy of the suppressor gene is present (i.e. even in a heterozygote). [...] For most genes, the phenotype of the heterozygous suppressor mutation by itself would be wild type (because most genes are not haplo-insufficient), so that the double mutant (suppressed) phenotype is intermediate between those of the single mutants.|$|R
40|$|Current models {{envision}} replicative senescence to {{be under}} dual 		 control by the p 53 and retinoblastoma (RB) tumour-suppressor pathways. The role 		 of the p 16 INK 4 a–RB pathway is controversial, and the 		 function of RB in human cells has not been tested directly. We used targeted 		 homologous recombination to <b>knock</b> out one <b>copy</b> of RB in presenescent 		 human fibroblasts. During entry into senescence, RB+/− 		 cells underwent spontaneous loss of heterozygosity and the resultant 		 RB−/− clones bypassed senescence. The 		 extended lifespan phase was eventually terminated by a crisis-like state. The 		 same phenotype was documented for p 21 CIP 1 /WAF 1 and 		 p 53 heterozygous cells, indicating that loss of function of all three 		 genes results in failure to establish senescence. By contrast, the abolition of 		 p 16 function by {{the expression of a}} p 16 -insensitive cyclin-dependent kinase 4 		 protein or siRNA-mediated knockdown provided only minimal lifespan extension 		 that was terminated by senescence. We propose that p 53, p 21 and RB act in a 		 linear genetic pathway to regulate cell entry into replicative senescence...|$|R

40|$|The {{conventional}} biochemical platform featuring {{enzymatic hydrolysis}} involves five key steps: pretreatment, cellulase production, enzymatic hydrolysis, fermentation, and product recovery. Sugars are produced as reactive intermediates for subsequent fermentation to fuels and chemicals. Herein, an alternative biochemical route is proposed. Pretreatment, enzymatic hydrolysis and cellulase production is consolidated into one single step, {{referred to as}} consolidated aerobic processing, and sugar aldonates are produced as the reactive intermediates for biofuels production by fermentation. In this study, we demonstrate the viability of consolidation of the enzymatic hydrolysis and cellulase production steps in the new route using Neurospora crassa as the model microorganism and the conversion of cellulose to ethanol as the model system. We intended to prove the two hypotheses: 1) cellulose can be directed to produce cellobionate by reducing β-glucosidase production and by enhancing cellobiose dehydrogenase production; and 2) both of the two hydrolysis products of cellobionate [...] glucose and gluconate [...] {{can be used as}} carbon sources for ethanol and other chemical production. Our results showed that <b>knocking</b> out multiple <b>copies</b> of β-glucosidase genes led to cellobionate production from cellulose, without jeopardizing the cellulose hydrolysis rate. Simulating cellobiose dehydrogenase over-expression by addition of exogenous cellobiose dehydrogenase led to more cellobionate production. Both of the two hydrolysis products of cellobionate: glucose and gluconate can be used by Escherichia coli KO 11 for efficient ethanol production. They were utilized simultaneously in glucose and gluconate co-fermentation. Gluconate was used even faster than glucose. The results support the viability of the two hypotheses that lay the foundation for the proposed new route...|$|R

The next week, on the issue of 15 July 2006, it rose to the summit of the chart, selling 39,501 <b>copies,</b> <b>knocking</b> Shakira's Hips Don't Lie off the top spot and spending two consecutive weeks there. It later descended to number four, being replaced by McFly's Please, Please. It was her very first single in her home country's main charts, following a top 40 entry with the limited release of [...] "LDN" [...] the same year. It ended 2006 as UK's 11th best selling single of the year. Allen was surprised at the success of it, stating: [...] "Of course, I never thought the record would chart - I didn't even think I'd get a record contract". She was named [...] "one of the brightest hopes for domestic crossover rap" [...] because of this single. The song shared similar success in Ireland, where it debuted on the issue of 6 July 2006 and peaked inside the top ten at six, holding on the chart for nine weeks. In mainland Europe, it broke the top 40 of most countries, but wasn't as successful as in the singer's home country. Notable successes were ten on the Dutch Top 40, sixteen on the French Singles Chart and 21 on the Swiss Singles Chart. Across the ocean, [...] "Smile" [...] reached 14 on the ARIA Charts and in New Zealand peaked inside the top ten at six.|$|R
