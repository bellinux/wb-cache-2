5|$|If {{the bell}} was rung, it would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>most</b> likely rung by Andrew McNair, {{who was the}} doorkeeper both of the Assembly and of the Congress, and was {{responsible}} for ringing the bell. As McNair was absent on two unspecified days between April and November, {{it might have been}} rung by William Hurry, who succeeded him as doorkeeper for Congress. Bells were also rung to celebrate the first anniversary of Independence on July 4, 1777.|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys nelsoni is an extinct rodent of María Madre Island, Nayarit, Mexico. Within {{the genus}} Oryzomys {{of the family}} Cricetidae, it may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>most</b> {{closely related to the}} {{mainland}} species O.albiventer. Since its first description in 1898, most authors have regarded it as a distinct species, but it has also been classified as a mere subspecies of the marsh rice rat (O.palustris).|$|E
5|$|The {{house sparrow}} has an {{extremely}} large range and population, {{and is not}} seriously threatened by human activities, so it is assessed as least concern for conservation on the IUCN Red List. However, populations have been declining {{in many parts of}} the world. These declines were first noticed in North America, where they were initially attributed to the spread of the house finch, but <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>most</b> severe in Western Europe. Declines have not been universal, as no serious declines have been reported from Eastern Europe, but have even occurred in Australia, where the house sparrow was introduced recently.|$|E

5|$|Celebrities, artists, {{and merchants}} enjoyed fine food, opium, and liquor at the Great Southern Hotel, which had novel Western pleasures, {{such as a}} disco ball {{specially}} imported from the USA. The allure of Western goods and traditions even extended to weddings held at the hotel. A prolific Chinese writer, Wu Sijing, held her 17-table wedding banquet there in 1952, and was photographed in a white bridal dress, {{with her husband in}} a white suit and bowtie. This choice of dress would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>most</b> unusual amongst mainland Chinese due to the nationalistic influence of Mao-era China, highlighting Singapore's confluence between Eastern and Western cultures, of which the hotel was at the forefront. Both in decor, and activities.|$|E

25|$|Today {{conversions}} to Christianity <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>most</b> {{common in}} Algeria, {{especially in the}} Kabylie, and Morocco and Tunisia. A 2015 study estimates 380,000 Muslims converted to Christianity in Algeria. While it's estimated that between 8,000-40,000 Moroccans converted to Christianity in the last decades; although some estimate the number to {{be as high as}} 150,000. In Tunisia, however, the number of Tunisian Christians is estimated to be around 23,500.|$|E

25|$|Most of {{the roads}} in Awka-Etiti are tarred.This has been {{possible}} thanks only to individual philanthropic and community efforts. In this regard, Awka-Etiti {{is representative of the}} situation in the neighbouring towns and Igboland, where little or no government induced infrastructural development has been felt. Despite this, the Iruowelle Youths Association and the Umunocha Development Association <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>most</b> prominent in tarring the roads in their villages. Beyond that, several important link roads have been tarred by the single handed efforts of philanthropic citizens.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the most}} {{striking}} differences between the Jewish movements {{in the 21st century}} is their response to pressures of assimilation, such as intermarriage between Jews and non-Jews. Reform and Reconstructionist rabbis <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>most</b> accepting of intermarried couples, with some rabbis willing to officiate in mixed religious ceremonies, although most insist that children in such families be raised strictly Jewish. Conservative rabbis are not permitted to officiate in such marriages, but are supportive of couples when the non-Jewish partner wishes to convert to Judaism and raise children as Jewish.|$|E
25|$|At {{the height}} of his success, there was talk and {{promotion}} of a fight between him and the former boxing Undisputed Heavyweight Champion Mike Tyson. The two had a face to face confrontation immediately after Sapp's victory in Las Vegas over Kimo. K-1 signed Tyson to a contract and the fight looked to be on. However, Tyson's status as a convicted felon made him unable to get a visa to fight in Japan where the fight would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>most</b> profitable. Other locations for the proposed fight were made, but the fight ultimately never happened.|$|E

On one occasion he attacked and shot down an enemy plane {{which had been}} engaged at firing on our infantry. He then led his patrol over the enemy's lines, dived down to an altitude of 100 feet, and attacked large numbers of hostile infantry with machinegun fire, causing the utmost panic amongst them and inflicting heavy casualties.

25|$|Streptococcus dysgalactiae is a gram positive, beta-haemolytic, coccal {{bacterium}} {{belonging to}} the family Streptococcaceae. It is capable of infecting both humans and animals, but is most frequently encountered as a commensal of the alimentary tract, genital tract, or less commonly, {{as a part of}} the skin flora. The clinical manifestations in human disease range from superficial skin-infections and tonsillitis, to severe necrotising fasciitis and bacteraemia. The incidence of invasive disease has been reported to be rising. Several different animal species are susceptible to infection by S.dysgalactiae, but bovine mastitis and infectious arthritis in lambs (joint ill) <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>most</b> frequently reported.|$|E

25|$|The Department of Justice later {{narrowed the}} charges against Minister King Shabazz and {{dismissed}} {{the charges against}} the New Black Panther Party and Jerry Jackson. The decision to dismiss the charges has led to accusations that the Department of Justice under the Obama administration is biased against white victims and unwilling to prosecute minorities for civil rights violations. These charges <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>most</b> notably made by J. Christian Adams, who in May 2010 resigned his post in the Department of Justice in protest over the Obama administration's perceived mishandling of the case, and by his former supervisor Christopher Coates.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, the United Nations Development Programme {{launched}} a project, called the Chernobyl Recovery and Development Programme (CRDP), for {{the recovery of}} the affected areas. The program, initiated in February 2002, based its activities on the Human Consequences of the Chernobyl Nuclear Accident report recommendations. The main goal of the CRDP's activities is supporting the efforts of the Government of Ukraine to mitigate the long-term social, economic, and ecological consequences of the Chernobyl disaster. CRDP works in the four areas of Ukraine that <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>most</b> affected by the Chernobyl nuclear accident: Kiev Oblast, Zhytomyrska Oblast, partially Kiev, Chernihivska Oblast, and Rivne Oblast.|$|E
25|$|Out in {{the real}} world, however, the {{response}} has been overwhelmingly positive. I've signed books in five stores, with more than 1,000 buyers at each site. I've had one negative remark—that I should be tried for treason—and one caller on C-SPAN said that I was an anti-Semite. My most troubling experience has been the rejection of my offers to speak, for free, about the book on university campuses with high Jewish enrollment and to answer questions from students and professors. I <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>most</b> encouraged by prominent Jewish citizens and members of Congress who have thanked me privately for presenting the facts and some new ideas.|$|E
