40|$|Women as a {{population}} have been marathoning {{for less than}} thirty years, many are fresh and new to the sport, and are making such sacrifices by squeezing the sport into their full lives along with their career and <b>familiar</b> <b>responsibilities.</b> Many women, Black and White, some with family responsibilities, others with demanding careers, several with both, are running. By doing so, they are challenging male dominance and demand an equality {{on and off the}} road. Women have created meaning in their lives as a result of marathoning. Their lives, perceptions and experiences, and bodies have changed in the process...|$|E
40|$|There has {{recently}} been increasing scholarly interest in early modern correspondence and specifically also in women’s letter writing and reading. Starting from the late Middle Ages <b>familiar</b> <b>responsibilities</b> and domestic obligations led many women to write to their absent husbands or other relatives to exchange health news and inform them about family affairs. It is however in the early modern period that corresponding with relatives and friends became a widespread social practice ranging from official to familiar and personal correspondence; in this period female literacy increased thus allowing growing numbers of women to write and read their own letters. A growing number of female voices can thus be heard depicting early modern social life. The article focuses on a neglected aspect of women’s correspondence: it investigates not the sender’s epistolary identity, but that of the recipient through {{the analysis of the}} personal correspondence of Lady Cornwallis Bacon. The main theme of the article is to show how the epistolary identity of an early modern gentlewoman was constructed by her correspondents. It is assumed that modes of communicating information and achieving a specific goal through letters varied not only according to the relationship connecting the correspondents but also the purpose and content of letters.  </p...|$|E
40|$|There {{is a lack}} of {{systematic}} empirical evidence for a link between parental behavior and family functioning; although there have been studies showing that both family functioning and parenting practices, specifically parental monitoring, influence children’s wellbeing, their joint impact on developmental outcomes has not yet been investigated. In the research reported here we address this gap. The relationships among family functioning, parental monitoring and <b>familiar</b> <b>responsibility</b> were examined in a sample of 320 Italian adolescents in two age ranges 14 – 15 years (n = 186) and 18 – 19 years (n = 133) in respectively the first and last years of secondary school. A questionnaire containing scales of the studied dimensions was administered in the classroom. A simple mediation model to investigate mediation of parental monitoring and a mediated moderation model to test the indirect conditional effect of adolescents’ age were run. Our results showed that parental monitoring amplified the positive impact of healthy family functioning on adolescent <b>familiar</b> <b>responsibility</b> and buffered the negative impact of problematic family functioning. Contrary to predictions, adolescent age did not moderate the strength of the observed relationships. Taken together these results confirm the protective function of parental monitoring during adolescent development and provide support for the concept of <b>familiar</b> <b>responsibility</b> as a relational competence indicating psychosocial maturity and linked to family variables, rather than a simply characteristic of the individual. Implications for research and practice are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Current {{curricula}} {{in management}} accounting stress {{the role of}} transfer pricing {{as a tool for}} measuring the performance of responsibility centers and their managers. Recently, however, multinational enterprises (MNEs) have felt increasing pressure to comply with transfer pricing tax regulation. As a result, tax risk management considerations {{play a key role in}} the transfer pricing decisions of MNEs today. This paper seeks to provide instructors and students of management accounting with examples of the core principles of international transfer pricing, as well as to allow them to discuss international transfer pricing in the context of responsibility accounting. Specifically, the paper presents a case study of a fictional MNE, allowing you to apply the OECD Guidelines in practice to cross-border transfers within an MNE, and to discuss the implications of tax-based transfer pricing for responsibility accounting. As a basis for working on the case study, the Appendix provides an overview of the ‘OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations’ (OECD, 2010), hereafter OECD Guidelines, upon which most transfer pricing regulations worldwide are based. It includes an introduction to the arm’s length principle, OECD-accepted transfer pricing methods, and comparability analysis procedures for identifying comparable transactions between independent parties. The case study assumes that you are <b>familiar</b> with <b>responsibility</b> accounting and transfer pricing as discussed by standard management accounting textbooks. status: accepte...|$|R
40|$|Objective To {{understand}} the situations and communications experienced by caregivers {{of children with}} tuberculosis (TB) with regard to directly observed therapy (DOT). Method A descriptive exploratory study with a qualitative approach was applied and developed in the ambulatory of Programa Einstein na Comunidade de Parais&# 243;polis (PECP). The data were collected using semi-structured interviews of 13 caregivers of children with TB in DOT. The Collective Subject Discourse (CSD) method was {{used to analyze the}} data. Results Seven CSDs were identified and grouped into four categories: "Living in a difficult situation", "Changing the family routine", "Responsibility almost always fall son the mother", and "Adapting to the DOT". Conclusions The difficulties faced by the caregiver of the child at the beginning of DOT significantly changed the <b>familiar</b> routine. The <b>responsibility</b> for its continuity was assigned to the mother, who must adapt {{to the demands of the}} treatment and face the situation...|$|R
40|$|To have a conversation, the {{appropriate}} language is needed. The language {{is just starting}} to emerge in both Asia and the West {{for one of the}} most important conversations the world is now having—the discussion about the future of business and capitalism. Thailand’s King Bhumibol refers to the sufficiency economy. Harvard’s Michael Porter speaks of shared value. Ellen MacArthur’s eponymous foundation supports the transition to the circular economy. John Elkington proposes breakthrough capitalism. Bhutan’s call to measure progress by gross national happiness (GNH), rather than the narrow metric of gross domestic product (GDP), is now attracting attention around the globe. The explosion of terms, concepts and practices takes us far beyond the <b>familiar</b> corporate social <b>responsibility.</b> All are efforts to grapple with the same issue: capitalism as we have known it is not fit for the 21 st century.

40|$|In Portugal, {{feminine}} {{activity rate}} of working mother is high but remains structural asymmetries of responsibilities {{between women and men}} in familiar spheres. Based on quantitative and qualitative data results are presented that show that, in spite of a global feminization rate of 58, 6 %, women workers in State Administration remains with major responsibilities in familiar/private lives than men. Women in technical and leadership functions have the same patterns of <b>familiar</b> and domestic <b>responsibilities</b> but different patterns of work-time. Women in technical functions tend to have a strategy of work-family time balance, despite less career opportunities, while women in leadership functions adopt a supremacy of wok-time, just as men. Nevertheless, both women, in technical and leadership functions, feel a permanent conflict between career and family responsibilities, which is not felt by men. Gender roles define dominant models of work and family organisation which conduct to different professional strategies and career opportunities...|$|R

If you’ve recently relocated from the suburbs to the Prince William countryside {{you may not be}} <b>familiar</b> with the <b>responsibilities</b> associated with protecting and maintaining your well and septic system. The following is some basic information taken from two new free publications available in the District office, “How to Protect Your Well ” and “Your Septic System: A Reference Guide for Homeowners. ” “A common myth is that our groundwater originates hundreds of miles away. In reality, most local groundwater come from rain that has fallen nearby, within a few miles or closer. The sources of pollution that could harm our wells are often located in our neighborhood or even on our own property. ” Some common sources of well contaminants include coliform bacteria and nitrates. Coliform bacteria are found in people, animals, soil, and vegetation. Nitrates are found in fertilizers, sewage, and animal waste. Nitrates are very hazardous to infants. “The Public Health Service recommends that drinking water contain no coliform bacteria and 10 parts per million or less of nitrates...|$|R
