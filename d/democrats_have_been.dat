5|$|Senate {{committees}} can {{be affected}} by the party composition of the Senate. The Clerk of the Senate, Harry Evans, argued that a government majority of seats in the Senate resulted in limitations on what the committees inquired into, and how readily governments responded to their queries and requests for information. Statistics published by centrist political party the Australian <b>Democrats</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> used to support the contention that committee operations have been inhibited by government control of the Senate, particularly in respect of selection of topics for committee inquiry. However Senator Minchin, the leader of the government in the Senate in the mid-2000s, pointed out that their political rivals had previously cut off debate on more bills in the Senate than had his government.|$|E

25|$|Prior to the American Civil War, Pittsburgh was {{strongly}} abolitionist. It {{is considered the}} birthplace of the national Republican Party, as the party held its first convention here in February 1856. From the Civil War to the 1930s, Pittsburgh was a Republican stronghold. The effects of the Great Depression, combined with entrenched local GOP scandals, resulted in a shift among voters to the Democratic Party. With the exceptions of the 1973 and 1977 elections (where lifelong Democrats ran off the party ticket), <b>Democrats</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> elected consecutively to the mayor's office since the 1933 election. The city's current ratio of party registration is 5 to 1 Democrat.|$|E
25|$|While {{only five}} Democratic presidential nominees have carried Indiana since 1900, 11 Democrats were elected {{governor}} during that time. Before Mitch Daniels became governor in 2005, Democrats {{had held the}} office for 16consecutive years. Indiana elects two senators and nine representatives to Congress. The state has 11electoral votes in presidential elections. Seven of the districts favor the Republican Party according to the CPVI rankings; there are currently seven Republicans serving as representatives and two Democrats. Historically, Republicans have been strongest in the eastern and central portions of the state, while <b>Democrats</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> strongest in the northwestern part of the state. Occasionally, certain counties {{in the southern part}} of the state will vote Democratic. Marion County, Indiana's most populous county, supported the Republican candidates from 1968 to 2000, before backing the Democrats in the 2004, 2008, 2012, and 2016 elections. Indiana's second most populous county, Lake County, strongly supports the Democratic party and has not voted for a Republican since 1972. In 2005, the Bay Area Center for Voting Research rated the most liberal and conservative cities in the United States on voting statistics in the 2004presidential election, based on 237cities with populations of more than 100,000. Five Indiana cities were mentioned in the study. On the liberal side, Gary was ranked second and South Bend came in at 83. Among conservative cities, Fort Wayne was 44th, Evansville was 60th and Indianapolis was 82nd on the list.|$|E
500|$|Some {{supporters}} {{and opponents of}} the NPVIC have based their position {{at least in part}} on a perceived partisan advantage of the compact. Former Delaware Governor Pierre S. du Pont IV, a Republican, has argued that the compact would be an [...] "urban power grab" [...] and benefit Democrats. However, Saul Anuzis of the Republican National Committee wrote that Republicans [...] "need" [...] the compact, citing what he believes to be the center-right nature of the American electorate. New Yorker essayist Hendrik Hertzberg maintains that the compact would benefit neither party, noting that historically both Republicans and <b>Democrats</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> successful in winning the popular vote in presidential elections. In the last five presidential elections, simulations of close results with the electoral vote system have favored Democrats in three (2004, 2008, 2012) and favored Republicans in two (2000, 2016). In those same five presidential elections, Democrats won the popular vote in four of them.|$|E

2500|$|The Liberal <b>Democrats</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{strongly}} {{in favour of}} European integration. The party maintains a [...] "strong and positive" [...] commitment to the European Union; the Liberal Democrats and its predecessors (the SDP–Liberal Alliance) have been consistently in favour of British EU membership, with the Liberal Party originally proposing membership into the predecessor European Coal and Steel Community. However, the Liberal Democrats oppose the European federalism espoused by their counterparts.|$|E

2500|$|However, the Democrats {{have made}} strong {{gains in the}} past years with winning two gubernatorial races in a row, regaining control of the Virginia Senate, and electing Democrat Jim Webb to the U.S. Senate in the Democratic wave of the 2006 {{midterms}} over incumbent Republican George Allen. <b>Democrats</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> able to make such gains in Virginia {{due in large part}} to the ever-expanding Northern Virginia, particularly the suburbs surrounding Washington, D.C. [...] Historically, this area had been strongly Republican. [...] However, in recent years it has been dominated by white liberals who tend to vote Democratic. It was, ultimately, this rapid demographic change that provided a huge new influx of Democratic voters to Virginia.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to the book's publication, {{during the}} U.S. midterm {{election}} campaign {{period in the}} third week of October 2006, several prominent Democrats criticized both the book and the author, a fellow Democrat. Specifically, Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean issued a statement: [...] "While I have tremendous respect for former President Carter, I fundamentally disagree and do not support his analysis of Israel and the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. On this issue President Carter speaks for himself, the opinions in his book are his own, they are not the views or position of the Democratic Party. I and other Democrats will continue to stand with Israel in its battle against terrorism and for a lasting peace with its neighbors." [...] Then-House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi stated: With all due respect to former President Carter, he does not speak for the Democratic Party on Israel. <b>Democrats</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> steadfast in their support of Israel from its birth, in part because we recognize that to do so is in the national security interests of the United States. We stand with Israel now and we stand with Israel forever.|$|E
