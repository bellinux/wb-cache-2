25|$|Combining a small culvert Fence with a Pond Leveler Pipe {{is another}} {{effective}} method to protect culverts from beaver damming. The culvert fence is made {{small enough to}} encourage the beavers to dam on it, but the resulting pond is prevented from rising to a dangerous level by a Pond Leveler Pipe installed through the culvert fence. The Fence and Pipe <b>flow</b> <b>device</b> needs very little maintenance and limits where and how high the beavers can dam; however, to be most effective, the intake end of the pipe should usually sit in at least 3 feet of water.

2500|$|Outside San Francisco, in {{downtown}} Martinez, California, {{a male and}} female beaver arrived in Alhambra Creek in 2006. The Martinez beavers built a dam 30 feet wide and at one time 6 feet high, and chewed through half the willows and other creekside landscaping the city planted {{as part of its}} $9.7 million 1999 flood-improvement project. When the City Council wanted to remove the beavers because of fears of flooding, local residents organized to protect them, forming an organization called [...] "Worth a Dam". Resolution included installation of a <b>flow</b> <b>device</b> through the beaver dam so that the pond's water level could not become excessive. Now protected, the beavers have transformed Alhambra Creek from a trickle into multiple dams and beaver ponds, which in turn, led to the return of steelhead trout and river otter in 2008, and mink in 2009. The Martinez beavers probably originated from the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, which once held the largest concentration of beavers in North America.|$|E

40|$|Allergen {{control plans}} are {{increasingly}} {{used by the}} food industry to prevent allergen cross-contact and validation of these plans involves methods to detect allergen protein residues. A commonly used rapid allergen detection method is lateral <b>flow</b> <b>devices,</b> although research about their validation is lacking. The objective {{of this research was}} to investigate lateral <b>flow</b> <b>devices,</b> their specificity and sensitivity to milk proteins and milk-derived ingredients, swabbing conditions, and applications in cleaning validation. Several lateral <b>flow</b> <b>devices</b> advertised to detect total milk did not detect whey proteins or whey-derived ingredients. The overload level of the kits was highly variable (ranging from 100 - 10, 000 ppm milk protein), stressing the necessity of validating each kit for its intended purpose. Milk soils were produced on stainless steel panels in order to assess swabbing conditions. There was essentially no difference in sensitivity achieved from using the swab provided by a kit as compared to a common swab, but certain swabs were better suited to scraping soils rather than absorbing liquid soils. The milk soils that were dried at high heat had a lower recovery than unheated or low heat soils. Concentration dependent interferences with lateral <b>flow</b> <b>devices</b> and general protein tests were found with caustic cleaning solutions and oxidizing sanitizers, respectively. Four food-processing surfaces: 316 grade stainless steel, HDPE, Nylon 6 / 6, and Delrin, were soiled with milk and cleaned with each cleaning solution of a typical CIP system separately and then sequentially. When used separately, a commercial caustic solution was observed to outperform a commodity caustic solution. The acidic and sanitizing solutions did not contribute to milk soil removal. The stainless steel surface was most easily cleaned. The lateral <b>flow</b> <b>devices</b> were able to detect milk soils with similar frequency, while the general protein kit had a lower sensitivity. An enhanced visualization method which employed protein staining and scanning of the soils was used, but more development of this method is necessary prior to further use. Advisors: Joseph L.

50|$|On average, sinks were 15% of U.S. indoor {{water use}} in 1999. There are, however, easy methods to rectify {{excessive}} water loss. Available for purchase is a screw-on aerator.

Additionally, {{there is a}} flip-valve available that allows flow to be turned off and back on at the previously reached temperature.

50|$|The main {{advantage}} in using {{this type of}} filtration is that it proceeds much more quickly (several orders of magnitude) than simply allowing the liquid to drain through the filter medium via the force of gravity.
