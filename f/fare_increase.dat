5|$|In 1995 and 1997, then Gov. John Rowland {{proposed}} to replace Shore Line East and the Waterbury Branch with bus service, citing a high subsidy of $18.70 per rider per trip, {{in order to}} decrease the unpopular gas tax. Lawmakers from the region called the proposals political and defended the line's ability to reduce congestion and pollution, while opponents of the line called it an example of government waste. The Shore Line East Rider's Association and other groups lobbied to save both services each time, and after public hearings a small <b>fare</b> <b>increase</b> was enacted in late 1997 instead.|$|E
5|$|Many {{of the new}} routes {{terminated}} at the Anacostia Station {{rather than}} continue into downtown Washington, as they once had. WMATA officials admitted that fares for most Anacostia residents would rise an average of 50 percent, and that Anacostia residents {{would be forced to}} pay more and travel farther to access the services (such as doctors) and shopping that most District residents can readily access. To help mediate the impact of the total <b>fare</b> <b>increase</b> on Anacostia residents, WMATA reduced basic bus fares for many routes in the area from $1 to 35 cents.|$|E
5|$|Fares on Community Transit buses {{are priced}} into three groups: adult, youth, and reduced. Adult fare is charged for {{passengers}} {{between the ages}} of 19 and 64, youth fare is charged for passengers between ages 6 & 18, and the reduced fare is charged for passengers over the age of 65 or those with disabilities or Medicare card holders. Up to two children under 5 ride free with a chaperone paying full or reduced fare for themselves. Fares also change based on service level, with local service within Snohomish County costing the least and commuter service to Seattle being more expensive; commuter service from southern Snohomish County and Everett is also less costly compared to commuter service from northern and eastern Snohomish County. The last <b>fare</b> <b>increase</b> occurred on July 1, 2015, raising the adult and DART fares by 25 cents.|$|E

5|$|The city soon {{experienced}} {{its most}} dire fiscal crisis yet, {{due to the}} stagnant economy of the early 1970s, combined with the massive outflow of city residents to the suburbs. The system was already in decline; the subway had seen a 40% decrease in ridership since 1947, and a $200 million subsidy for the MTA {{as well as a}} 1952 <b>fare</b> <b>increase</b> had not been enough to pay for basic upkeep for the subway system, let alone fund massive expansion projects like the Second Avenue Subway. When plans were finalized in 1971, the subway had been proposed for completion by 1980, but two years later, its completion date was forecast as 2000. In October 1974, the MTA chairman, David Yunich, announced that the completion of the line north of 42nd Street was pushed back to 1983 and the portion to the south in 1988. On December 13, 1974, New York City mayor Abraham Beame proposed a six-year transit construction program that would reallocate $5.1 billion of funding from the Second Avenue Line to complete new lines in Queens and to modernize the existing infrastructure, which was rapidly deteriorating and in dire need of repair. Beame issued a stop-work order for the line in September 1975, whereupon construction of the section between Second and Ninth Streets was halted, and no other funding was allocated to the line's construction. Besides the Chrystie Street Connection, only three sections of tunnel had been completed; these tunnels were sealed.|$|E
5|$|When the {{railways}} were nationalised in 1948, services at Montpelier {{came under the}} control of the Western Region of British Railways. Staff levels were reduced further, down to two booking clerks, four porters, a checker and a weighbridge operator by 1950. Service levels had decreased slightly by 1955 to 28 towards Avonmouth and 29 towards Bristol, but the services were at regular intervals. Passenger numbers however dropped sharply in 1961 as the result of a <b>fare</b> <b>increase,</b> and so in 1962 a new reduced timetable was enacted, which lost more passengers. A year later in 1963, the Beeching report suggested the complete withdrawal of services along the line, but ultimately only those beyond Severn Beach or via Henbury were withdrawn. The goods yard at Montpelier closed on 18 November 1965, with the signal box following on 10 May 1967. Staff were completely withdrawn on 17 July 1967 with tickets issued by the train guard. The general reduction in passenger traffic, as well as the transfer of Avonmouth goods traffic to the Henbury Loop Line, allowed the removal of the northern track from 19 October 1970, with all services using the southern platform. The former goods yard is now a small industrial estate. By 1974, service had reduced to 19 trains per day in each direction, with no Sunday services beyond Avonmouth.|$|E
5|$|When the {{railways}} were nationalised in 1948, services at Shirehampton {{came under the}} aegis of the Western Region of British Railways. Staff levels decreased by 1958 to two clerks, two leading porters, one porter, and a stationmaster who was also responsible for Sea Mills railway station. Service levels had decreased slightly by 1955 to 28 towards Avonmouth and 29 towards Bristol, but the services were at regular intervals. Passenger numbers however dropped sharply in 1961 as the result of a <b>fare</b> <b>increase,</b> and so in 1962 a new reduced timetable was enacted, which lost more passengers. A year later in 1963, the Beeching report suggested the complete withdrawal of services along the line, but ultimately only those beyond Severn Beach or via Henbury were withdrawn. Goods services from the station ended on 29 November 1965, and from 17 July 1967 all staffing was withdrawn from stations along the line, including Shirehampton, with tickets issued by the train guard. An 800-ton oil storage tank was built in the station yard in 1967, with deliveries continuing until the mid-eighties. By 2005 the yard had been redeveloped and was occupied by a commercial vehicle hire company. The general reduction in passenger traffic, as well as the transfer of Avonmouth goods traffic to the Henbury Loop Line, allowed the removal of the second track from 19 October 1970, with all services using the original, northern platform. The signal box was taken out of service at the same time, and the buildings on the remaining platform sold off before being destroyed by a fire in the 1990s. The station master's house is now a private dwelling, with the garden containing a small brick building with a chimney surviving from the station buildings. By 1974, service had reduced to 19 trains per day in each direction, with no Sunday services beyond Avonmouth.|$|E
25|$|In April 2012, the MBTA Advisory Board {{approved}} major <b>fare</b> <b>increases</b> on all MBTA services, and cutbacks or terminations of some transit routes. In July 2014, <b>fares</b> were <b>increased</b> {{further by}} an average of 5%.|$|R

25|$|Much debate {{continues}} over annual <b>fare</b> <b>increases,</b> {{although the}} government has now pledged to keep regulated rail <b>fare</b> <b>increases</b> at Retail Prices Index (RPI) inflation {{for the remainder of}} this Parliament. In addition much debate has continued over the financing of various rail schemes driven primarily by the huge cost and time overrun on the GWML route modernisation and electrification scheme. In connection with this, and to coincide with the Chancellor's Autumn statement on 25 November 2015, the Bowe and Hendy reports were produced.|$|R
25|$|Patrick {{proposed}} {{raising the}} state gas tax by 19¢ per gallon to forestall Massachusetts Turnpike toll and MBTA <b>fare</b> <b>increases,</b> fully fund Regional Transit Authority and Turnpike operations, and address {{part of the}} capital shortfall identified by the TFC, but this was defeated in the state legislature. Instead, a sales tax increase of 1.25% was passed, with part of that dedicated to transportation.

25|$|Prior to the December 28, 2014 <b>fare</b> <b>increase,</b> {{passengers}} paid a {{flat rate}} of RMB(¥) 2.00 (including unlimited fare-free transfers) for all lines except the Airport Express, which cost ¥25.

25|$|Moscoe defended a taxi <b>fare</b> <b>{{increase}}</b> in 2003, {{arguing that}} it was first such increase in seven years and was necessary to cover rising insurance and gas prices. In 2005, he argued that drivers deserved a further fifty-cent increase per ride to cope with soaring fuel costs. He has supported a motion to have all Toronto cabs painted the same colour, arguing that this measure will help crack down on illegal drivers.|$|E
25|$|The {{budget was}} {{approved}} unanimously by the Council {{and resulted in}} a 4.9% tax increase, including 1.4% for the police force budget, 2% for the infrastructure levy and 1.5% for capital and operation costs. The budget also included a 7.5% OC Transpo <b>fare</b> <b>increase</b> until 2010, user fee increases such as rents and parking spaces, and cost cuts.

50|$|<b>Fare</b> <b>increases</b> {{normally}} occur {{annually in}} July, {{to coincide with}} increased fuel and labor expenses, and have generally averaged between 3.5% and 5% per year (although the restructuring caused a larger jump in rates).

50|$|On December 1, 2009, SMART {{raised its}} fares by $0.50. There {{was also a}} $0.50 charge added to {{regional}} monthly pass users and DDOT transfers. <b>Fare</b> <b>increases</b> were made to prevent possible cuts in bus services.|$|R
25|$|For {{most of the}} 20th century, {{the ferry}} was famed as the biggest bargain in New York City, as it charged the same one-nickel fare as the New York City Subway. In 1882, riders protested against a {{proposed}} <b>fare</b> <b>increase</b> to 10 cents per ride, but were unsuccessful in obtaining a fare reduction. The fare-reduction movement resurfaced in 1894, with multiple petitions being submitted to the New-York Sinking Fund Commissioners. However, these petitions were all denied. By 1898, the fare {{had been reduced to}} a nickel, or five cents.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} the optimistic outlook for the Second Avenue line's construction, the subway had seen a 40% {{decrease}} in ridership since 1947, and its decline was symptomatic of {{the downfall of the}} city as a whole. A $200 million subsidy for the MTA, as well as a 1952 <b>fare</b> <b>increase</b> from 30 cents to 35 cents, was not enough to pay for basic upkeep for the subway system, let alone fund massive expansion projects like the Second Avenue Subway.

25|$|On January 1, 2011, Caltrain cut 4 midday trains but {{upgraded}} 4 weekend {{trains to}} Baby Bullet {{service as a}} pilot program. This reduced its schedule from 90 to 86 trains each weekday. At the same time, it raised fares $0.25 and continued to contemplate cutting weekday service to 48 trains during commute hours only. By April 2011, Caltrain's board had approved a budget with fare increases to take effect on July 1, 2011, and no service cuts.

25|$|Moscoe {{recommended}} several {{reforms to}} transit policy following his {{appointment to the}} TTC in 1991. He supported lower rates for Toronto's poorer residents, arguing that transit passes could be mailed out with welfare cheques. This idea was opposed by then-TTC chair Mike Colle. Moscoe also advocated lower advertising rates for small businesses, noting that a national recession was resulting in many spaces being left unused. He opposed the TTC's elimination of environmentally friendly trolley services in January 1992, and led a successful initiative for their restoration later in the same year. Moscoe also opposed a 16% <b>fare</b> <b>increase</b> in 1992, arguing that the TTC could cut expenses through administration instead.|$|E
