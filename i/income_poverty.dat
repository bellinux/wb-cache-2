25|$|GDP, long {{stuck at}} its 1973 level {{even with a}} growing population, grew by about a third from early 1991 to late 1994. Fixed investment, {{depressed}} since the 1981–82 crisis, more than doubled during this period. Consumers also benefited: <b>income</b> <b>poverty</b> fell by about half (to under 20%) and new auto sales (likewise depressed since 1982) jumped fivefold, to about 500,000 units. This boom, however, had its problems early on. Tight federal budgets kept the budget deficits of the provinces from improving and, though many benefited from Cavallo's insistence that large employers translate higher productivity into higher pay, this same productivity boom (as well as the nearly 200,000 layoffs the privatizations caused) helped unemployment jump from about 7% in 1991–92 to over 12%, by 1994. The 1995 Mexican Crisis shocked consumer and business confidence and ratcheted joblessness to 18% (the highest since the 1930s).|$|E
25|$|Asset {{poverty is}} an {{economic}} and social condition that is more persistent and prevalent than <b>income</b> <b>poverty.</b> It {{can be defined as}} a household's inability to access wealth resources that are enough to provide for basic needs for a period of three months. Basic needs refer to the minimum standards for consumption and acceptable needs.Wealth resources consist of home ownership, other real estate (second home, rented properties, etc.), net value of farm and business assets, stocks, checking and savings accounts, and other savings (money in savings bonds, life insurance policy cash values, etc.).Wealth is measured in three forms: net worth, net worth minus home equity, and liquid assets. Net worth consists of all the aspects mentioned above. Net worth minus home equity is the same except it does not include home ownership in asset calculations. Liquid assets are resources that are readily available such as cash, checking and savings accounts, stocks, and other sources of savings. There are two types of assets: tangible and intangible. Tangible assets most closely resemble liquid assets in that they include stocks, bonds, property, natural resources, and hard assets not in the form of real estate. Intangible assets are simply the access to credit, social capital, cultural capital, political capital, and human capital.|$|E

2500|$|This {{index is}} useful in {{understanding}} and illuminating the differences between human poverty (which focuses on the denial of basic rights, such as dignity and freedom) and <b>income</b> <b>poverty.</b> For example, despite the U.S.'s high income stability, it is also ranked among the highest developed nations in human poverty. In her article, [...] "Towards a Gendered Human Poverty Measure", Elizabeth Durbin critiques HPI and expands {{on the possibility of}} a gender-sensitive index. She argues that HPI incorporates three dimensions of poverty: life span measured by the proportion of the population expected to die before age 40, lack of knowledge measured by the proportion who are illiterate, and a decent standard of living measured by a composite index of access to health services, access to safe water, and malnutrition among children less than 5, that could specifically account for gender disparities. Despite its uses, however, {{it is important to note}} that HPI cannot be a true measure of poverty because it fails to examine certain deprivations, such as lack of property ownership and credit, that are essential to a stronger bargaining position in the household for women.|$|E
