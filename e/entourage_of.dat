40|$|On proximities {{generated}} by countable families <b>of</b> <b>entourages.</b> (English summary) Comment. Math. Univ. Carolin. 45 (2004), no. 3, 535 – 541. It {{is still an}} open problem whether each proximity {{generated by}} a countable family <b>of</b> <b>entourages</b> <b>of</b> the diagonal must be metrizable. The main result of the paper states that any proximity that is generated by a countable family <b>of</b> <b>entourages</b> <b>of</b> the diagonal is sequential. Some corollaries are derived from that result. For example, the following partial answer to the previously stated problem: if a proximity generated by a countable family Ω <b>of</b> <b>entourages</b> <b>of</b> the diagonal verifies that the family {U ◦ U − 1 ◦ U ◦ U − 1 : U ∈ Ω} also generates the proximity, then it is metrizable...|$|R

5|$|The {{chronology}} {{and circumstances}} surrounding the conclusion of Lǫgmaðr's reign are uncertain. According to one source, he voluntarily resigned the kingship and journeyed to Jerusalem where he died. This account could be evidence that he died on crusade: one possibility is the First Crusade, perhaps in the <b>entourage</b> <b>of</b> Robert II, Duke of Normandy; another possibility is the so-called Norwegian Crusade, in the <b>entourage</b> <b>of</b> Sigurðr Magnússon, King of Norway. Although one source claims that Lǫgmaðr's trek to the Holy Land was undertaken in remorse for the cruelty he had inflicted upon Haraldr, {{another possibility is that}} he was forced into exile instead. Whatever the case, it is apparent that about a decade after Magnús' death, the Crovan dynasty was restored to the kingship in the person of Lǫgmaðr's youngest brother.|$|E
5|$|In 1320, {{following}} the death of Michael IX Palaiologos (eldest son of Andronikos II and co-emperor from 1295 on), his son Andronikos III was crowned as co-emperor by Andronikos II. Although initially popular with his grandfather, the younger Andronikos and his <b>entourage</b> <b>of</b> young nobles, to which Syrgiannes belonged, had by that time caused the elder emperor's displeasure by their extravagance. Their excesses culminated in the mistaken-identity murder of the young emperor's younger brother, Manuel; enraged, the elder Andronikos annulled his grandson's titles, and a deep personal rift was opened between the two.|$|E

5|$|The wealthy {{families}} {{living on the}} estates of these scholar-officials – as well as rich merchants, princes, and nobles—often maintained a massive <b>entourage</b> <b>of</b> employed servants, technical staffs, and personal favorites. They hired personal artisans such as jewellers, sculptors, and embroiderers, while servants cleaned house, shopped for goods, attended to kitchen duties, and prepared furnishings for banquets, weddings, and funerals. Rich families also hosted literary men such as secretaries, copyists, and hired tutors to educate their sons. They were also the patrons of musicians, painters, poets, chess players, and storytellers.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the size}} of noble {{households}} shrank slightly during the 16th century, the number of guests at the largest castle events continued to grow. 2,000 came to a feast at Cawood Castle in 1466, while the Duke of Buckingham routinely entertained up to 519 people at Thornbury Castle {{at the start of}} the 16th century. When Elizabeth I visited Kenilworth in 1575 she brought an <b>entourage</b> <b>of</b> 31 barons and 400 staff for a visit that lasted an exceptional 19 days; Leicester, the castle's owner, entertained the Queen and much of the neighbouring region with pageants, fireworks, bear baiting, mystery plays, hunting and lavish banquets. With this scale of living and entertainment the need to find more space in older castles became a major issue in both England and Scotland.|$|E

5|$|As {{soon as the}} two armies {{were drawn}} up, a clamour arose from the German ranks, loudly {{demanding}} that Chnodomar and his <b>entourage</b> <b>of</b> chiefs should dismount and lead {{the main body of}} German foot warriors from the front. Chnodomar and the chiefs immediately complied. In so doing, Chnodomar forfeited any strategic control of the battle, as, trapped in the centre of the action, he would {{have no way of knowing}} what was happening in other sectors. Julian, on the other hand, maintained a detached position throughout (with his escort) and so was able to respond to events all over the field, such as the initial rout of his cavalry. It is unclear exactly where Julian was stationed but it was likely in the gap between the two Roman lines.|$|E
5|$|Baldwin and {{his group}} arrived at Tyre on 16 September 1190. Richard did not arrive in Syria until 1191. It is unclear exactly why they were sent ahead of the king; perhaps it was {{to look out for}} the king's {{interests}} while Richard took a more leisurely route, or perhaps to rid the king's <b>entourage</b> <b>of</b> a family grouping around Glanvill that the king did not trust. Baldwin was not a member or close associate of the Glanvill faction, so most likely he was sent ahead to look after the king's interests, whatever the reasons for the inclusion of his companions. Another concern may have been to get help to the Kingdom of Jerusalem as quickly as possible after the king learned of Frederick Barbarossa's death {{on the way to the}} Holy Land.|$|E
5|$|Basil II accorded Mansur the fief of Shih al-Laylun (Loulon) {{near the}} Byzantine–Arab frontier. According to {{historian}} Jean-Claude Cheynet, this fief {{could not have}} been the frontier fortress of Loulon, but rather a group of villages from which Mansur received his income during his asylum in Antioch. Mansur later built a fortress in his fief. Basil II also granted Mansur a building in Antioch itself. Mansur received a salary and he and his men served in the Byzantine army of Antioch, where he commanded a tagma (professional regiment) of 700 men. He was in the <b>entourage</b> <b>of</b> Emperor Romanos III at the Battle of Azaz in 1030, which was fought against Salih's son and successor, Shibl al-Dawla Nasr. Mansur's presence likely indicates Romanos's intention to restore Mansur to Aleppo, according to Zakkar, though the attempt ended in a decisive Byzantine defeat.|$|E

5|$|Famous {{painters}} included Ni Zan and Dong Qichang, {{as well as}} the Four Masters of the Ming dynasty, Shen Zhou, Tang Yin, Wen Zhengming, and Qiu Ying. They drew {{upon the}} techniques, styles, and complexity in painting achieved by their Song and Yuan predecessors, but added techniques and styles. Well-known Ming artists could make a living simply by painting due to the high prices they demanded for their artworks and the great demand by the highly cultured community to collect precious works of art. The artist Qiu Ying was once paid 2.8kg (100oz) of silver to paint a long handscroll for the eightieth birthday celebration of the mother of a wealthy patron. Renowned artists often gathered an <b>entourage</b> <b>of</b> followers, some who were amateurs who painted while pursuing an official career and others who were full-time painters.|$|E
5|$|John Constantine, {{the main}} {{character}} of Hellblazer, was portrayed {{as a kind of}} confidence man and occult detective who did morally questionable things, arguably for the greater good. He usually triumphed through guile, deceit, and misdirection, but often made more enemies in the process than he defeated. Indeed, it was a common theme in the book that Constantine was unable to effect any lasting change or enjoy unequivocal victories. While sometimes striving for the good of mankind, Constantine was often manipulative and a dangerous person to have as a friend, as the lives and souls of those around him became perilously involved in his misadventures. He took pains to protect himself from direct attacks, but his friends and relatives were often endangered in order to strike at him. The spirits of deceased friends haunted him, individually or as an <b>entourage</b> <b>of</b> ghosts.|$|E
5|$|Mary Tudor, {{daughter}} of Catherine of Aragon and Henry VIII, spent 19 months at Ludlow overseeing the Council of the Marches between 1525 and 1528, {{along with her}} <b>entourage</b> <b>of</b> servants, advisors, and guardians. The relatively small sum of £5 was spent restoring the castle before her arrival. The council's wide ranging role was reinforced in legislation in 1534, and its purpose was further elaborated in the Act of Union of 1543; some presidents, such as Bishop Rowland Lee, used its harsher powers extensively to execute local criminals, but later presidents typically preferred to punish with the pillory, whipping or imprisonment in the castle. The Great Chamber itself {{was used as the}} council's meeting room.|$|E

5|$|The Queen was a {{prominent}} figure in Roman society. Her presence at the proxy wedding of Grand Prince Ivan III of Russia and the Byzantine princess Sophia Palaiologina in 1472 was widely noted, as was her pilgrimage to L'Aquila {{on the occasion of}} the translation of Bernardino of Siena's relics to a new church (the construction of which was funded, among others, by King Thomas). That she lived a comfortable life can be deduced from the impression she left on Roman chroniclers, who wrote about the <b>entourage</b> <b>of</b> 40 mounted knights accompanying her on a pilgrimage to St. Peter's Basilica to celebrate the new year 1475.|$|E
5|$|The {{imperial}} {{courts of}} the emperor's palace {{were filled with}} his <b>entourage</b> <b>of</b> court painters, calligraphers, poets, and storytellers.

A prime example of a highly venerated court painter was Zhang Zeduan (1085–1145) who painted an enormous panoramic painting, Along the River During the Qingming Festival. Emperor Gaozong of Song initiated a massive art project during his reign, known as the Eighteen Songs of a Nomad Flute from the life story of Cai Wenji (b. 177). This art project was a diplomatic gesture to the Jin dynasty while he negotiated for the release of his mother from Jurchen captivity in the north.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth {{viewed the}} {{partially}} finished results at Kenilworth in 1572, but the complete effect of Leicester's work was only apparent during the queen's last visit in 1575. Leicester was keen to impress Elizabeth {{in a final}} attempt to convince her to marry him, and no expense was spared. Elizabeth brought an <b>entourage</b> <b>of</b> thirty-one barons and four hundred staff for the royal visit that lasted an exceptional nineteen days; twenty horsemen a day arrived at the castle to communicate royal messages. Leicester entertained the Queen {{and much of the}} neighbouring region with pageants, fireworks, bear baiting, mystery plays, hunting and lavish banquets. The cost was reputed to have amounted to many thousand pounds, almost bankrupting Leicester, though it probably did not exceed £1,700 in reality. The event was considered a huge success and formed the longest stay at such a property during any of Elizabeth's tours, yet the queen did not decide to marry Leicester.|$|E
