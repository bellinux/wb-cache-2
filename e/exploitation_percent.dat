40|$|Graduation date: 1981 Aquatic {{communities}} {{consisting of}} guppies, amphipods, copepods, snails, nematodes, rotifers, protozoans, euglenoid flagellates, and other microorganisms {{were established in}} sixteen laboratory microcosms. Guppies were exploited at four different levels (0 percent, 10 percent, 20 percent, and 40 {{percent of the population}} biomass) with four communities at each level of exploitation. An alfalfa ration (0. 4 g/day) was introduced as a nutrient source for the communities. The general objective {{of this study was to}} advance the understanding of community structure and organization by conceptualizing communities as hierarchical arrangements of subsystems influenced by the external environment and by explaining how both the interactive performances of these subsystems and the external environmental conditions may influence the dynamics of community structure. Environmental perturbations imposed on the sixteen communities included introduction of a toxicant, dieldrin, an increase in nutrient input and habitat availability, and exploitation of the guppy populations at four levels. The level of guppy exploitation had a direct effect on community structure. The biomasses of the guppy populations that were maintained in the systems decreased as the level of exploitation increased. The guppies apparently preyed on the amphipod and nematode populations as well as competed with the amphipods for the alfalfa nutrient source. As the biomass of the guppy populations decreased with increased exploitation, the populations of amphipods and nematodes increased. Dieldrin was introduced into four systems (one at each level of exploitation) after these systems had exhibited near steady-state behavior on a guppy-amphipod phase plane for approximately one year. The most direct impact of the toxicant was on the guppy population. Guppy biomass was decreased substantially at 0 <b>percent</b> <b>exploitation,</b> 10 <b>percent</b> <b>exploitation,</b> and 20 <b>percent</b> <b>exploitation.</b> A subsequent increase in amphipods occurred as a result of the decreased intensity of predation and competition. New near steady-state biomasses were established for these populations. The system at 40 <b>percent</b> guppy <b>exploitation</b> showed no apparent immediate response to the dieldrin. Microinvertebrate populations also showed no apparent response to the toxicant. In eight of the remaining systems, nutrient input was increased and additional rock habitat was introduced to provide increased cover fo 7 the invertebrates. This environmental perturbation greatly altered community structure. Immediate and dramatic increases in the guppy and amphipod populations occurred. The increased rock cover caused an oxygen depletion in the sediments and thus decreased the habitat available for the microinvertebrates. Substantial decreases occurred in the populations of nematodes, protozoans, and other previously abundant organisms. A system of intersecting isoclines is used to explain the general locations of the domains of behavior of these systems in phase space before and after the introduction of dieldrin and before and after the increase in nutrient and habitat availability. The increase in nutrient and habitat availability altered the domain of behavior for the communities more dramatically than did dieldrin...|$|R

Contrary to popular belief, boys are subject to sexual abuse as frequently as girls. In reported cases of children subject to commercial sexual <b>exploitation,</b> 77 <b>percent</b> of the children came from broken homes. Twenty-three percent lived with their parents, but in those homes domestic violence was common. The biggest risk faced by children who run away and live {{on the street is}} sexual exploitation. Children kidnapped from southeastern provinces are forced into prostitution here. Today, it is impossible to say for certain how many children in Turkey are being subjected to commercial sexual exploitation, but many say official information is off by at least 85 percent.|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} on the “exploitation factor" {{in the natural}} dipterocarp forest of Pulau Laut, South Kalimantan {{was carried out in}} 1981. Sixty tree with a diameter at breat height from 50 to 160 cm were selected at a sample from the stands in north and central Pulau Laut. From the investigation the following conclusions are in order : The logging waste in the natural dipterocarp forest of Pulau Laut is 20 percent, with a standard error of 1, 4 <b>percent.</b> <b>Exploitation</b> factor in the Pulau Laut natural dipterocarp forest ranges from 76, 8 to 82, 4 percent, averaging 80 percent. The volumes of the trees obtained by estimating the diameters at breast height and the heights of the clear boles are consistanly smaller than those obtained by measuring the dimateres and lengths of the clear boles after the trees were cut especially in hilly forests. Both diameter and clear bole length have significant effect on exploitation factor, their relationship being quadratic. Optimum diameter for highest yield is approximately 77 cm. This however, requires further research especially in relation with silviculture and felling cycle...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1981 Organization and the {{adaptation}} of aquatic laboratory ecosystems to resource availability, exploitation, and a toxicant were examined in a 34 -month study. Sixteen 560 -liter microcosms including prey, predator, and competitor populations were employed {{over a wide range}} of energy and habitat resource availability and exploitation of the top predator. Chronic exposure to the pesticide dieldrin was used to perturb systems near steady states. Empirical generalizations from ecological theory, productivity theory, and fishery exploitation theory were incorporated to explain in part such performances as development, structure, and persistence of the laboratory ecosystems, their communities, populations, and individual organisms. Dynamic (developmental) and near steady-state community structure and organization were detailed for guppy, amphipod, snail, planaria, and algae populations and for a benthic detritus and microorganism component. Near steady-state population performances including density, production, yield, and size-specific growth and reproduction were determined for the guppy population in order to demonstrate the concordance of life history, population, and community level performances with changes in environmental conditions. A system of isoclines on a series of interrelated resource-utilizer and competition phase planes was employed {{to gain a better understanding}} of the structure and apparent organization of the laboratory systems. The 16 systems were established with a 0. 6 gram/day alfalfa ration, 20 percent of each tank bottom covered with gravel for invertebrate habitat, and 0, 10, 20, or 40 <b>percent</b> guppy <b>exploitation</b> per month. Exploitation directly affected the size of the guppy populations near steady state (through observed changes in production, yield, growth, and reproduction) and indirectly affected the size of snail and amphipod populations which responded to competition and/or predation from guppies. Following many months of near steady-state system behavior (i. e. restricted fluctuations of population biomasses), eight systems were shifted to a 4. 0 grams/day alfalfa ration and 95 percent gravel cover. These high energy and habitat level systems were characterized by relatively complex trophic and habitat resource partitioning. These systems developed different population interactions and community structure and had much higher population densities. At the same time, four low energy and habitat level systems (one at each guppy exploitation rate) with well established near steady states began continuous exposure to 1. 0 ppb dieldrin in the water. The response of the laboratory systems to the toxicant was determined by the levels of prevailing environmental conditions as well as by the system's organization and the capacity of the populations to adapt and to persist. There were both density-dependent (via exploitation) and time-dependent components to the response to toxicant perturbation. In general, dieldrin reduced the growth and reproduction of the guppies, this resulting in smaller population biomasses. Amphipod biomasses increased in response to reduced predation and competition. The ecosystem with 0 <b>percent</b> <b>exploitation</b> (i. e. the largest guppy biomass) responded immediately with apparent dieldrin induced mortalities of mature fish. However, eventually the population recovered its lost biomass. There was no apparent initial response at 40 <b>percent</b> <b>exploitation</b> (i. e. smallest guppy biomass), but after 15 months of exposure the guppy population went extinct apparently from the. combined stress of exploitation and toxicant. Community organization and its expression in community development, structure, and persistence involved {{the adaptation}} of species populations to each other, to available energy and materials, to habitat, to climatic conditions including water quality and temperature, to exploitation, and to the introduction of the toxicant. Manipulating energy and habitat availability, exploitation levels, and toxicant presence altered near steady-state community, population, and individual organism performances. In these responses to environmental conditions, there was a certain concordance of community, population, and life history patterns that constitutes adaptation of the community and its subsystems...|$|R
