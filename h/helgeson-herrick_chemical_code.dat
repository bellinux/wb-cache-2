Whether the same <b>chemical</b> <b>coding</b> exists in varicose axons of different functional classes has not been systematically tested. In this study, we quantified the coexistence of markers that define classes of nerve cell bodies in the myenteric plexus of the guinea-pig ileum, in varicose axons of the same neurons. Profound differences between the combinations of immunohistochemical markers in myenteric nerve cell bodies and in their varicosities were identified. These discrepancies were particularly notable for classes of neurons that had previously been classified as cholinergic, based on immunoreactivity for choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) in their cell bodies. To detect cholinergic varicose axons of enteric neurons in this study, we used antiserum against the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT). ChAT-immunoreactivity has been reported to be consistently co-localized with 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) in interneuronal cell bodies, yet only 29  ±  5 % (n =  4) of 5 -HT-immunoreactive varicosities contained vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT). Somatostatin coexists with ChAT-immunoreactivity in a class of descending interneuron but only 21  ±  1 % (n =  4) of somatostatin-immunoreactive varicosities were VAChT-immunoreactive. Comparable discrepancies were also noted for non-cholinergic markers. The results suggest that <b>chemical</b> <b>coding</b> of cell bodies does not necessarily reflect <b>chemical</b> <b>coding</b> of varicose axon terminals and that the assumption that nerve cell bodies that contain ChAT are functionally cholinergic may be questionable...|$|R

40|$|Abstract A {{subpopulation}} of the pig inferior mesenteric ganglia (IMG) neurons projecting to {{the colon}} exhibit calbindin-like immunoreactivity. It {{is not known}} {{if there are any}} changes in the <b>chemical</b> <b>coding</b> patterns of these neurons during porcine proliferative enteropathy (PE). To answer this question, juvenile Large White Polish pigs with clinically diagnosed Lawsonia intracellularis infection (PE; n 03) and a group of uninfected controls (C; n 03) were compared. The retrograde tracer fast blue (FB) was injected into the descending colons of all animals and then tissue comprising IMGs from both groups was processed for double-labeling immunofluorescence with calbindin-D 28 k (CB) in combination with either tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), neuropeptide Y (NPY), somatostatin (SOM), vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), nitric oxide synthase, Leu-enkephalin, substance P, vesicular acetylcholine transporter, galanin, or pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypep-tide. Immunohistochemistry revealed changes in the chem-ical coding pattern of calbindin-immunoreactive neurons in the inferior mesenteric ganglia of the pig. In control animals, FB/CB-positive neurons were immunoreactive to TH, NPY, SOM, and VIP. In the experimental group, TH-expressing neurons were unaffected, NPY-expressing neurons were increased, whereas the number of neurons immunoreactive to SOM or VIP was reduced.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{establish}} the effect of intravesical administration of resiniferatoxin (RTX) and tetrodotoxin (TTX) on the <b>chemical</b> <b>coding</b> of paracervical ganglion (PCG) neurons supplying the urinary bladder in the pig. In order to identify the PCG neurons innervating the bladder, retrograde tracer Fast Blue was injected into the bladder wall prior to intravesical RTX or TTX administration. Consequent application of immunocytochemical methods revealed that in the control group 76. 82 % of Fast Blue positive PCG neurons contain nitric oxide synthetase (nNOS), and 66. 92 % contain acetylcholine transferase (ChAT). Intravesical infusion of RTX resulted in a reduction of the nNOS-IR neurons to 57. 74 % and ChAT-IR to 57. 05 %. Alternative administration of TTX induced an increase of nNOS-IR neurons up to 79. 29 % and a reduction of the ChAT-IR population down to 3. 73 % of the Fast Blue positive PCG cells. Our data show that both neurotoxins affect the <b>chemical</b> <b>coding</b> of PCG cells supplying the porcine urinary bladder, but the effects of their action are different. Moreover, these results shed light on the possible involvement of NO-ergic and cholinergic neurons in the mechanisms of therapeutic action exerted by RTX and TTX in curing the overactive bladder disorder...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: As enteric neurons are {{regarded}} {{to be highly}} adaptive in their response to various pathological states, including inflammation, {{it appears to be}} of interest to study the <b>chemical</b> <b>coding</b> of neurons in the intramural ganglia of the ileum wall in the course of porcine proliferative enteropathy (PPE) evoked by Lawsonia intracellularis. The study was performed on 12 juvenile pigs of the Large White Polish breed. The pigs were divided into the control (C, n = 6) group and the group consisting of pigs with clinically diagnosed Lawsonia intracellularis infection (E, n = 6). In E group animals the infection was confirmed with a PCR-based test. All the animals were sacrificed and segments of the ileum being pathologically changed were processed for double-labelling immunofluorescence using antibody against protein gene-product 9. 5 (PGP 9. 5) combined with antibody for dopamine β-hydroxylase (DβH), vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) or nitric oxide synthase (NOS). Immunohistochemistry revealed in the inner submucous plexus (ISP) and outer submucous plexus (OSP) an increase of the number of neurons containing DβH and VAChT in the E group. Interestingly, a {{decrease in the number of}} DβH- and VAChT-positive neurons in meynteric plexus (MP) ganglia of the E group animals was observed.

The CaMG neurons were visualized with retrograde tracer Fast blue (FB) and their chemical profile was disclosed with double-labeling immunohistochemistry using antibodies against tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), neuropeptide Y (NPY), vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), somatostatin (SOM), calbindin (CB), galanin (GAL) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). It was found that in both the control (n = 6) and TTX-treated pigs (n = 6), the vast majority (92. 6 % ± 3. 4 % and 88. 8 % ± 2 %, respectively) of FB-positive (FB+) nerve cells were TH+.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the arrangement and <b>chemical</b> <b>coding</b> of enteric nerve structures in the human large intestine affected by cancer. Tissue samples comprising all layers of the intestinal wall were collected during surgery form both morphologically unchanged and pathologically altered segments of the intestine (n= 15), and fixed by immersion in buffered paraformaldehyde solution. The cryostat sections were processed for double-labelling immunofluorescence to study the distribution of the intramural nerve structures (visualized with antibodies against protein gene-product 9. 5) and their <b>chemical</b> <b>coding</b> using antibodies against somatostatin (SOM), substance P (SP) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). The microscopic observations revealed distinct morphological differences in the enteric nerve system structure between the region adjacent to the cancer invaded area and the intact part of the intestine. In general, infiltration of the cancer tissue resulted in the gradual (depending on the grade of invasion) first decomposition and reduction to final partial or complete destruction and absence of the neuronal elements. A comparative analysis of immunohistochemically labeled sections (from the unchanged and pathologically altered areas) revealed a statistically significant decrease in the number of CGRP-positive neurons and nerve fibres in both submucous and myenteric plexuses in the transitional zone between morphologically unchanged and cancer-invaded areas. In this zone, a decrease was also observed in the density of SP-positive nerve fibres in all intramural plexuses. Conversely, the investigations demonstrated statistically insignificant differences in number of SP- and SOM-positive neurons and a similar density of SOM-positive nerve fibres in the plexuses of the intact and pathologically changed areas.

40|$|<b>Chemical</b> <b>coding</b> of {{sympathetic}} preganglionic neurons (SPN) {{suggests that}} the chemical content of subpopulations of SPN can define their function. Since neuropeptides, once synthesized are transported to the axon terminal, most demonstrated <b>chemical</b> <b>coding</b> has been identified using immunoreactive terminals at the target organ. Here, we use {{a different approach to}} identify and quantify the subpopulations of SPN that contain the mRNA for pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) or enkephalin. Using double-labeled immunohistochemistry combined with in situ hybridization (ISH) we firstly identified the distribution of these mRNAs in the spinal cord and determined quantitatively, in Sprague–Dawley rats, that many SPN at the T 4 -T 10 spinal level contain preproPACAP (PPP+, 80 ± 3 %, n= 3), whereas a very small percentage contain preproenkephalin (PPE+, 4 ± 2 %, n= 4). A similar neurochemical distribution was found at C 8 -T 3 spinal level. These data suggest that PACAP potentially regulates a large number of functions dictated by SPN whereas enkephalins are involved in few functions. We extended the study to explore those SPN that control adrenal chromaffin cells. We found 97 ± 5 % of adrenally projecting SPN (AP-SPN) to be PPP+ (n= 4) with only 47 ± 3 % that were PPE+ (n= 5). These data indicate that adrenally projecting PACAPergic SPN regulate both adrenal adrenaline (Ad) and noradrenaline (NAd) release whereas the enkephalinergic SPN subpopulation must control a (sub) population of chromaffin cells – most likely those that release Ad. The sensory innervation of the adrenal gland was also determined. Of the few adrenally projecting dorsal root ganglia (AP-DRG) observed, 74 ± 12 % were PPP+ (n= 3), whereas 1 ± 1 % were PPE+ (n= 3). Therefore, if sensory neurons release peptides to the adrenal medulla, PACAP is most likely involved. Together, these data provide a neurochemical basis for differential control of sympathetic outflow particularly that to the adrenal medulla. 11 page(s...|$|R
