Tensions {{exploded}} with the 1907 Peasants' Revolt, when General Averescu was called on by the PNL to organize the violent repression. This incident was later <b>invoked</b> <b>against</b> his claim <b>to</b> represent the interests of Romanian peasants. It was also {{the start of a}} bitter rivalry between Averescu and the PNL Prime Minister, Ion I. C. Brătianu. From 1918 to 1927, their problematic relationship was to be a national affair, affecting the course of Romanian politics. As historian Gheorghe I. Florescu writes, in the course of it Brătianu went from a [...] "manic" [...] mistrust of Averescu to a more benevolent arrogance.|$|R
