25|$|From 1899 the {{competitive}} pilot system was abolished {{and a new}} piloting law was introduced, establishing the Naval Pilot Authority. By 1910 {{there was only one}} pilot left at Fedje. This was dramatically changed during the First World War, when series of British convoys traveled up and down the coast. Soon there were four pilots stationed at Fedje, and when needed experienced fishermen were also used. After {{the end of the war}} in 1918 things settled down and from 1920 there was only a single pilot working out of Fedje. This was further increased to two in 1927.
