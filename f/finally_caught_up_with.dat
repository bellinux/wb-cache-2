5|$|Rising anxiety {{levels in}} the white {{settlers}} caused Captain James W. Stephenson to gather 12 volunteers and move toward {{the area of the}} disturbances from Galena. Stephenson recruited more men at Apple River Fort and then traveled eastward. Stephenson and his men rose before dawn on June 18 and started following the trail of the band of Sauk who had stolen the horses. The militia marched through pounding rain before they <b>finally</b> <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the Sauk.|$|E

Known for his speed, Lom <b>finally</b> <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> Riegels at California's 3-yard line and tried to turn him around, but he was immediately hit by a wave of Tech players and tackled back to the 1-yard line. The Bears chose to punt rather than risk a play so close to their own end zone, but Tech's Vance Maree blocked Lom's punt for a safety, giving Georgia Tech a 2–0 lead.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Wisconsin Heights was the {{penultimate}} {{engagement of}} the 1832 Black Hawk War, fought between the United States state militia and allies, and the Sauk and Fox tribes, led by Black Hawk. The battle {{took place in}} what is now Dane County, near present-day Sauk City, Wisconsin. Despite being vastly outnumbered and sustaining heavy casualties, Black Hawk's warriors managed to delay the combined government forces long enough to allow the majority of the Sauk and Fox civilians in the group to escape across the Wisconsin River. This reprieve was temporary; when the militia <b>finally</b> <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the fleeing band it resulted in the Bad Axe massacre {{at the mouth of the}} Bad Axe River.|$|E

In the late 1960s {{after a number}} of {{vacations}} on Deer Isle, Maine, the foggy conditions ultimately led to a significant shift in Kahn's painting. Years of monochromatic work concentrated on varying tonalities finally gave way to intense color. Kahn recalled later, [...] "I began to let the color come through on my canvases...my pastels were always intense, and <b>finally</b> my painting <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> them." ...|$|R
50|$|An ambush by 32 Battalion {{was planned}} for 22 May 1988. The {{plan called for}} a mortar attack on an outpost south of Techipa which would draw out the Cubans who would be then ambushed. Members of 32 Battalion company ambushed a Cuban de-mining team before the mortaring began and then found {{themselves}} being attacked by four BRDM-2 armoured personnel carriers and from two other hidden outposts. Fleeing back to the mortar position under covering mortar fire, the Cubans <b>finally</b> <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> and attacked <b>with</b> the BRDM's resulting in the abandonment of three damaged Unimogs. The 32 Battalion company retreated again as BM-21s started shelling. The Cubans eventually gave up the chase and the company was {{able to return to}} the mortar position in search of the missing vehicles but these had been removed by the Cubans. The remaining missing 32 Battalion members turned up at Ruacana and Calueque the following day.|$|R
2500|$|During an {{interview}} with MTV News in November 2009, Clarkson stated that while performing on the All I Ever Wanted Tour, she would also be {{in the process of}} writing new material for her fifth studio album, which she hoped for a late 2010 release. Later, during the Chart Show TV, Clarkson revealed that she wanted to do something different for the album. Her label felt the same way. On March 4, 2010, Clarkson was announced to perform on the revived Lilith Fair music festival. However, low ticket sales and scheduling conflicts led Clarkson and Norah Jones to cancel their upcoming performances. Clarkson remarked she would focus on recording for her upcoming album instead. Clarkson took a six-month break from her music career in 2010. Clarkson, who had a hectic schedule following the release of her sophomore album Breakaway, admitted that her music career had a bad effect on her health, saying [...] "Because my career went from zero to 100, there was no 'growing'. I learnt well under pressure, but, like, four years passed by and I hit rock bottom, Breakaway just exploded everywhere. Everyone was making a lot of money, so everyone was pushing the train. That's when it <b>finally</b> all <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> me. I came down with 'walking pneumonia' {{for the second time in}} a year. My body was physically giving up. I took six months off and went home. I love working, but at the end of the day you've got to take care of yourself." ...|$|R
5|$|With the {{exception}} of Villeneuve's fugitives, the French Mediterranean Fleet had been annihilated. Nine of eleven ships of the line had been captured or destroyed, {{as well as two}} frigates. French casualties totalled more than 3,000 and possibly as many as 5,000, compared to British losses of 218 killed and 677 wounded. However, many of Nelson's ships were seriously damaged, and urgent repairs were required for both his own ships and the captured prizes before they could begin the long voyage back to Britain. For more than two weeks Nelson remained in Aboukir Bay, effecting repairs, writing despatches and assessing the strategic situation in Egypt. The first ship detached from his squadron was Leander, sent on 5 August to the fleet under Earl St. Vincent off Cadiz with reports of the battle. On 8 August Aboukir Island was stormed and captured, and on 12 August Emerald, Alcmene and Bonne Citoyenne <b>finally</b> <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the fleet, followed on 17 August by Seahorse and Terpsichore. Mutine was detached on 13 August with despatches for the Admiralty and on 14 August Nelson sent seven ships with the six seaworthy prizes to the mouth of Aboukir Bay under the command of Saumarez. This convoy sailed for Gibraltar on 15 August and the following day Nelson burnt Heureux, followed on 18 August by Mercure and Guerrier, none of which were fit for continued service. On 19 August Nelson separated his remaining ships, leading three vessels northwards towards Naples and leaving a blockade squadron off Alexandria of Zealous, Goliath, Swiftsure and the frigates, under Captain Samuel Hood.|$|E

50|$|In 1893 an Englishman {{arrived in}} Rossport. He {{appeared}} to be wealthy and told people he was Allan Sutherland, Captain of the Argyll Highlanders and the 5th Lancers. He had an entourage of servants and workers with him - game keepers, dogs, guns, meat, fish, whiskey, wine and fishing tackle. When he went into Belmullet the shopkeepers all gave him credit so delighted with their distinguished guest as they were. Mr. Allan Sutherland borrowed everywhere he went and paid nobody. He always seemed to have forgotten his cheque book. He bought horses locally which he kept on a trial basis but in reality he sold them to Dublin for £10 each. He lived in Rossport House even though the Bournes family in London did not want him there. He had found the property in the Field magazine but he never paid the Bournes a penny of rental. <b>Finally</b> the law <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> {{him and he was}} sentenced to seven-years' penal servitude for horse stealing and other offences. He pleaded guilty to all the charges. It was disclosed in court that he had received a legacy of over £4,000 and had squandered the lot on horses and gambling.|$|R
50|$|Vidocq {{returned}} to Arras in 1800. His {{father had died}} in 1799, so he hid in his mother's house for almost half a year before he was recognized and had to flee again. He assumed the identity of an Austrian and {{spent some time in}} a relationship with a widow, with whom he moved to Rouen in 1802. Vidocq built up a reputation as a businessman and finally felt secure enough to let his mother come live with him and the widow; but <b>finally,</b> his past <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> him. He was arrested and brought to Louvres. There, he learned that he had been sentenced to death in absentia. With the help of the local procurator-general, Ransom, he filed an appeal and spent the following five months in prison waiting for a retrial. During this time, Louise Chevalier contacted him to inform him of their divorce. When it seemed {{that there would be no}} decision concerning his sentence, he decided to flee again. On 28 November 1805, while unattended for a moment, he jumped out of a window into the adjacent river Scarpe. For the next four years, he was a man on the run once again.|$|R

25|$|The militia regrouped at Fort Blue Mounds {{and picked}} up Black Hawk's trail again on 28 July near Spring Green, Wisconsin.

25|$|The {{following}} year Cork {{had the opportunity}} of capturing a record-equaling fourth successive All-Ireland.

Age and the exertions of the three previous campaigns <b>finally</b> <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> Cork in the All-Ireland semi-final and a 2–14 to 1–13 defeat by Galway brought the four-in-a-row dream to an end.|$|E
25|$|Age and {{injuries}} <b>finally</b> <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the Bullets. In the 1979–80 NBA season, they barely {{made the playoffs}} as they captured the sixth and final playoff spot with a tiebreaker despite posting a 39–43 record. In the playoffs, they were swept by the Philadelphia 76ers in a 2–game playoff series. The following year the Bullets {{failed to make the}} playoffs {{for the first time in}} 13 years. Wes Unseld retired and Elvin Hayes was traded to the Houston Rockets the following season.|$|E
25|$|In 1931, though already forty-eight - an age {{at which}} most cricketers even in that era had already retired - Charlie Parker equalled Jack Hearne's record of taking 100 wickets by 12 June and his total {{aggregate}} was the second highest of his career. However, age <b>finally</b> <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> Parker in 1932 after a promising beginning. Though he still spun the ball considerably, he lost his accuracy of length and consequently was expensive. Because Gloucestershire had no support for him and Goddard, Parker continued to play until 1935, but never recovered his former powers.|$|E
50|$|After beta {{releases}} in September and November 1997, {{the next}} official release came in December 1997, {{with the name}} changed to Caldera DR-OpenDOS 7.02, soon followed by a further release in March 1998, when the DR-DOS name returned as Caldera DR-DOS 7.02, {{now for the first}} time written with a hyphen. Version 7.02 (now reporting itself as BDOS 7.3) incorporated improved BIOS and BDOS issues, developed by Paul, adding many new boot and configuration options, integrating many compatibility enhancements, bug-fixes and optimizations for size and speed, and re-implementing all fixes of the missing Novell DOS updates. The BIOS improved the coexistence of DR-DOS with Windows 9x and its support for third-party disk compression drivers such as Microsoft's DriveSpace. It introduced a diagnostics mode (activated by Scroll Lock), integrated debugger support (with DEBUG=ON and a debugger loaded before or from within CONFIG.SYS) and more flexible CONFIG.SYS tracing capabilities via the F5/F6/F7/F8 hotkeys and the TRACE and TIMEOUT commands, thereby also improving the integration of alternative command line shells such as 4DOS. Together with LOADER, SYS /DR:ext and the CHAIN directive, it brought enhanced multi-configuration support for DR/D/CONFIG.ext files and came with enhancements to the BASIC-like CONFIG.SYS language for more powerful boot menus, convenient user interaction and programmatical acting upon conditions (CPU386), return codes and error levels (ERROR, ONERROR). It also allowed to change the SCROLLOCK, CAPSLOCK, INSERT and VERIFY settings as well as the SWITCHAR, YESCHAR, NOCHAR and RESUMECHAR characters. Various behavioural details could be controlled with new parameters /Q, /L, /Y and /S for SWITCHES. Further, it provided optional support for a LPT4: device and allowed to configure the built-in COMx: and LPTx: devices as well as to change the PRN: and AUX: defaults. The handling of environment variables in CONFIG.SYS was improved and new load-high facilities included such as the HIFILES/FILESHIGH and HIFCBS/FCBSHIGH options to relocate file handles and FCB structures into UMBs, which typically gave between 1 and 4 KB (and up to 15 KB) more free conventional memory compared to previous versions, or the HISHELL/SHELLHIGH SIZE directive to control the pre-allocation of HMA memory for COMMAND.COM, which helped to avoid memory fragmentation and thereby typically gave between 5 and 8 KB more continuous HMA memory for HMA-capable third-party drivers to work with in conjunction with third-party command line shells, which could not load into the HMA as COMMAND.COM with its /MH option. At a reduced memory footprint version 7.02 also brought an enhanced NLS 4.xx sub-system by Paul to allow multiple, distributed and possibly user-configured COUNTRY.SYS files to be used by the system at the same time in a hierarchical model. This also gave dynamic parser support for MS-DOS/PC DOS COUNTRY.SYS file formats in addition to DR-DOS' own COUNTRY.SYS formats, and it introduced support for the ISO 8601 international date format (including automatic detection) and the then-new Euro currency. DR-DOS 7.02 was fully Year 2000 compliant and provided special support to work with buggy system BIOSes. It also came with an updated FDISK, which could partition and format FAT32 volumes (but not yet work with LBA). The sources of the Novell patches for the external tools and drivers had meanwhile been found in Germany and could thus be retro-fitted into the system as well, so that DR-DOS 7.02 <b>finally</b> not only <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> Novell DOS 7, but was a true step forward. The release was followed by various updates in June, August and September 1998.|$|R

25|$|While {{the first}} two full seasons in Hartford were not {{glittering}} (the Whalers recorded losing records both years), the final two WHA seasons saw more success. They went to the finals again in 1978, with a veteran team spearheaded by the Howes–50-year-old Gordie led the team in scoring—future NHL stars Gordie Roberts and Mike Rogers, All-Star defenseman Ron Plumb, and forwards John McKenzie, Dave Keon and Mike Antonovich, and possessed of the league's best defense. The next season was not so fine, however, but while age <b>finally</b> <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> Gordie Howe, the slack {{was picked up by}} Andre Lacroix, the WHA's all-time leading scorer, acquired from the Aeros.|$|E
25|$|The last attack {{occurred}} on 11 April. Sylvia sighted a lugger proa at anchor under Krakatoa that got under weigh as the British approached. Drury sent Sub-Lieutenant Chesnaye and another party of volunteers in the proa that Sylvia had captured on 7 April. As the British proa approached the lugger, the lugger took flight and both proas passed behind an island that shielded them from Sylvias sight. When Sylvia <b>finally</b> <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the two, the British {{were about to}} board the pirate lugger proa, which was putting up a stiff resistance. Sylvia opened fire on the enemy until the lugger sank. She had been armed with three 18-pounders and had had a crew of 72 men; pirate casualties were unknown. The British suffered eight men severely wounded, one of whom later died.|$|E
25|$|On 4 December Atalante {{captured}} the privateer lugger Succès (or Success). Atalante {{came upon a}} lugger {{in the act of}} capturing a brig, and immediately set off in pursuit. The privateer abandoned her prize and tried to escape. About three hours later Atalante dropped off her master in her jolly boat to recapture the brig, and continued the pursuit without stopping. After a pursuit of about 11 hours Atalante <b>finally</b> <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> and {{captured the}} privateer. Succès was armed with six guns and had a crew of 48 men under the command of Francois Matthieu Blondin. She was six days out of Boulogne and the interrupted capture was her first prize. The master, Edward Lewington, and crew of the prize were aboard Succès and they reported that they had been sailing from London to Belfast when the privateer had captured them the night before west of Dungeness.|$|E

25|$|On 29 July, Isonomy {{ran in the}} Goodwood Cup, {{in which}} he was asked to concede {{thirteen}} pounds to Parole. An outsider named The Bear set off in front and at one stage opened up a lead of two hundred yards. Isonomy <b>finally</b> <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the front-runner in the straight and pulled away in the closing stages to win easily by three lengths, with Parole third A few days later on 6 August he was sent to Brighton Racecourse for the two-mile Brighton Cup, in which he carried 136 pounds and started at odds of 1/10 against three opponents. After settling in third place he moved into the lead in the straight and went three lengths clear, before being eased down in the closing stages to record a three-quarter-length win over Paul's Cray. Isonomy was then sent north for the Ebor Handicap at York on 27 August, for which he was made 8/11 favourite. Despite the very difficult conditions ("mud and water flying in all directions"), and conceding at least thirty pounds to his opponents, he won impressively by eight lengths.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{reaching}} the Cayos Arcas, where {{the rest of}} his flotilla had remained, Moore found that the San Jacinto had run aground on a sand bar {{and the rest of the}} ships were not to be seen. Austin set out to find the rest of the ships, Zavala and San Bernard, touching at the port of Campeche on 8 November and Sisal on 10 November. The flagship <b>finally</b> <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the rest of the ships at Frontera on 14 November. In order to salvage the San Jacinto and provide fuel for the lone steamship, Zavala, Moore hatched a plan to gain money. The Zavala towed the other two ships 60 miles up the San Juan Bautista River to the capital of the Mexican state of Tabasco, Villahermosa. There the small flotilla pointed their guns at the city and then sent troops into the seemingly deserted capital. Commodore Moore encountered a man bearing a white flag on a tree branch, and when he ascertained that this was the Mayor, the Texas commodore demanded $25,000 or he would level the town. The Mayor asked if silver would be acceptable, and upon receiving an affirmative reply, delivered the ransom. The commodore set sail with the silver and used the money to repair and outfit his ships.|$|E
