40|$|Global Information Technology (IT) {{outsourcing}} {{has been}} recognized to have important potential benefits. However, researchers and practitioners also recognize potential risks involved in <b>global</b> IT <b>outsourcing,</b> which sometimes lead to undesirable consequences. This paper develops a model to assess risks in <b>global</b> IT <b>outsourcing.</b> Specifically, this paper begins by identifying <b>global</b> IT <b>outsourcing</b> risk factors by considering the national infrastructure, organizational infrastructure, and project environment. Second, a <b>Global</b> IT <b>Outsourcing</b> (GITO) engagement model for risk assessment is developed to logically link all these risk factors together. Third, one quantifiable approach based on a relative-weighted assessment model is presented to demonstrate how the risks in the GITO engagement model can actually be measured and assessed. Such an overall measurement of <b>global</b> IT <b>outsourcing</b> risks establishes a reference point for assessing <b>global</b> IT project <b>outsourcing</b> risks, and will assist managers to enhance global IT outsourcing’s effectiveness and realize its vast potential. This paper will also benefit high-level decision makers including executives, policy planners, and managers working on decisions regarding <b>global</b> IT <b>outsourcing,</b> such as decisions on selecting an outsourcee country with {{a lower level of}} risk...|$|R

40|$|A {{growing number}} of {{retailers}} consider building collaborative relationships with <b>global</b> <b>outsourced</b> suppliers as a key strategy to ensure efficiency in their supply chain. Extant literature {{has suggested that the}} collaborative relationships with suppliers benefit retailers by allowing them to reduce cost, enhance product quality, and to deliver products on-time. Although collaborative relationships between fashion retailers and <b>global</b> <b>outsourced</b> suppliers have drawn great attention in the fashion industry, little research has explored collaborative relationships in the context of fashion supply chain. In addition, while fashion retailers recognize the positive effect of the collaborative relationship with suppliers on their performance, lack of understanding about their suppliers prevents fashion retailers from developing and managing such collaborative relationships effectively (Fawcett et al., 2015). Furthermore, although suppliers 2 ̆ 7 perception and attitudes are identified as crucial factors in creating effective collaborative relationships between retailers and suppliers (Fawcett et al., 2015), not much research has illuminated collaborative relationships from the stance of <b>global</b> <b>outsourced</b> suppliers. To fill in the aforementioned void, we adopt a qualitative approach to identify the antecedents of building effective collaborative relationships between retailers and suppliers from the suppliers 2 ̆ 7 perspectives, specifically in the domain of global fashion supply chain...|$|R

Previous research in IS has focused on the analysis of values, beliefs, customs, and other elements of culture whereas other inherent characteristics of culture, such as its dynamic and subjective nature, have been widely ignored. Hence, we suggest analyzing culture and identity in relation to action thereby accounting in more detail for the above mentioned characteristics. In particular, we develop a conceptual model describing the relationship between social identity and conflict in <b>global</b> IS <b>outsourcing</b> relationships. Propositions are derived from social identity and interpersonal conflict theory. The concept of cognitive flexibility (derived from cultural intelligence theory) is introduced as a moderator variable, influencing the relationship between social identity and interpersonal conflict. The conceptual model developed in this paper makes a theoretical contribution to the <b>global</b> IS <b>outsourcing</b> domain and serves as a basis for future empirical research...|$|R
