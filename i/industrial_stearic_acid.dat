Lean body mass was increased in the <b>stearic</b> <b>acid</b> fed group compared to all other groups by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Dietary <b>stearic</b> <b>acid</b> significantly reduced serum glucose compared to all other diets and increased monocyte chemotactic protein- 1 (MCP- 1) compared to the low fat control.

40|$|AbstractCerebellar granule cells, {{differentiated}} in vitro, were parallelly {{fed with}} [Sph- 3 H]GM 1 and [stearoyl- 14 C]GM 1, under identical conditions (10 − 6 M ganglioside; pulse, from 1 – 4 h; chase, up to 24 h after 4 h pulse) and the salvage pathways of sphingosine and <b>stearic</b> <b>acid</b> were investigated. It was observed that both sphingosine and <b>stearic</b> <b>acid,</b> liberated during the intralysosomal degradation of ganglioside, are metabolically recycled, along distinct pathways. Sphingosine {{is used for}} the biosynthesis of a number of sphingolipids, particularly ceramide, glucosyl-ceramide, gangliosides and sphingomyelin; <b>stearic</b> <b>acid</b> is utilized for the biosynthesis of sphingolipids, and to a greater extent, glycero-phospholipids, especially those endogenously richer in <b>stearic</b> <b>acid</b> (phosphatidyl-ethanolamine and phosphatidyl-choline). No evidence was provided for a salvage pathway for ceramide...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Stearates are commonly used in polymer technology as slip additives and lubricants. The release properties of <b>stearic</b> <b>acid</b> and its metallic derivatives are extensively manipulated in rubber processing industries where they are used as mold release agents. Previous unrelated {{studies have shown that}} increased additions of <b>stearic</b> <b>acid</b> consistently reduced mold sticking. Despite their widespread usage, however, few studies have been directed to study their mechanism of action. In a preliminary study conducted by AWE and Loughborough University, the attainment of low levels of adhesion was studied and in particular the use of <b>stearic</b> <b>acid</b> as an adhesion modifier was studied. It was found that adding minute amounts of <b>stearic</b> <b>acid</b> resulted in dramatic reductions to the strength of aluminium bonded with a PDMS-based adhesive. The cause of this fall-off in adhesion (as measured by T-peel test) was initially attributed to the migration of <b>stearic</b> <b>acid</b> to the surface forming a weak boundary layer. The possibility that <b>stearic</b> <b>acid</b> acts as an inhibitor for the cure reaction was also considered. Surface analysis predominantly with static secondary ion mass spectrometry (SSIMS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out to ascertain locus of failure and the likelihood of <b>stearic</b> <b>acid</b> at the interface. Failure was identified as having taken place in a cohesive, and potentially interphasial, layer near the interface of the joint. No evidence was given to support the WBL theory proposed by most researchers, thus findings from the present study contradicted existing literature. Fourier Transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy in collaboration with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to investigate the effect of <b>stearic</b> <b>acid</b> on the cure reaction.

40|$|In this study, stearoyl-ACP desaturase (SAD), {{the enzyme}} that {{converts}} <b>stearic</b> <b>acid</b> into oleic acid, is silenced by artificial microRNA {{in the green}} microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Two different constructs, which target different positions on the mRNA of stearoyl-ACP desaturase, were tested. The mRNA levels for SAD were reduced after the silencing construct was induced. In one of the strains, the reduction in SAD mRNA resulted in a doubling of the <b>stearic</b> <b>acid</b> content in triacylglycerol molecules, which shows that <b>stearic</b> <b>acid</b> production in microalgae is possible. </p...|$|R
