25|$|Most {{testicular}} {{germ cell}} tumors {{have too many}} chromosomes, and most often they are triploid to tetraploid. An <b>isochromosome</b> 12p (the short arm of chromosome 12 {{on both sides of}} the same centromere) is present in about 80% of the testicular cancers, and also the other cancers usually have extra material from this chromosome arm through other mechanisms of genomic amplification.|$|E
25|$|In the {{majority}} of cases where monosomy occurs, the X chromosome comes from the mother. This may be due to a nondisjunction in the father. Meiotic errors that lead to the production of X with p arm deletions or abnormal Y chromosomes are also mostly found in the father. <b>Isochromosome</b> X or ring chromosome X on the other hand are formed equally often by both parents. Overall, the functional X chromosome usually comes from the mother.|$|E
25|$|Turner {{syndrome}} {{is caused by}} the absence of one complete or partial copy of the X chromosome in some or all the cells. The abnormal cells may have only one X (monosomy) (45,X) or they may be affected by one of several types of partial monosomy like a deletion of the short p arm of one X chromosome (46,X,del(Xp)) or the presence of an <b>isochromosome</b> with two q arms (46,X,i(Xq)) Turner syndrome has distinct features {{due to the lack of}} pseudoautosomal regions, which are typically spared from X-inactivation. In mosaic individuals, cells with X monosomy (45,X) may occur along with cells that are normal (46,XX), cells that have partial monosomies, or cells that have a Y chromosome (46,XY). The presence of mosaicism is estimated to be relatively common in affected individuals (67–90%).|$|E

Cytogenetic investigation disclosed a female karyotype with <b>isochromosomes</b> of 2 p and 2 q replacing the two normal chromosomes 2. Her husband and both of her parents had normal karyotypes. Molecular studies revealed maternal only inheritance for chromosome 2 markers. Reduction to homozygosity of all informative markers indicated that the <b>isochromosomes</b> derived from a single maternal chromosome 2.

40|$|Rearrangements of the {{acrocentric}} chromosomes (Robertsonian translocations and <b>isochromosomes)</b> {{are associated}} with an increased risk of aneuploidy. Given this, and the large number of reported cases of uniparental disomy (UPD) associated with an acrocentric rearrangement, carriers are presumed to be at risk for UPD. However, an accurate risk estimate for UPD associated with these rearrangements is lacking. A total of 174 prenatally identified acrocentric rearrangements, including both Robertsonian translocations and <b>isochromosomes,</b> were studied prospectively to identify UPD for the chromosomes involved in the rearrangements. The overall goal {{of the study was to}} provide an estimate of the risk of UPD associated with nonhomologous Robertsonian translocations and homologous acrocentric rearrangements. Of the 168 nonhomologous Robertsonian translocations studied, one showed UPD for chromosome 13, providing a risk estimate of 0. 6 %. Four of the six homologous acrocentric rearrangements showed UPD, providing a risk estimate of 66 %. These cases have also allowed delineation of the mechanisms involved in producing UPD unique to Robertsonian translocations. Given the relatively high risk for UPD in prenatally identified Robertsonian translocations and <b>isochromosomes,</b> UPD testing should be considered, especially for cases involving the acrocentric chromosomes 14 and 15, in which UPD is associated with adverse clinical outcomes...|$|R
25|$|Germ cell {{tumors of the}} ovary develop {{from the}} ovarian germ cells. Germ cell tumor {{accounts}} for about 30% of ovarian tumors, but only 5% of ovarian cancers, because most germ-cell tumors are teratomas and most teratomas are benign. Malignant teratomas tend to occur in older women, {{when one of the}} germ layers in the tumor develops into a squamous cell carcinoma. Germ-cell tumors tend to occur in young women (20s–30s) and girls, making up 70% of the ovarian cancer seen in that age group. Germ-cell tumors can include dysgerminomas, teratomas, yolk sac tumors/endodermal sinus tumors, and choriocarcinomas, when they arise in the ovary. Some germ-cell tumors have an <b>isochromosome</b> 12, where one arm of chromosome 12 is deleted and replaced with a duplicate of the other. Most germ-cell cancers have a better prognosis than other subtypes and are more sensitive to chemotherapy. They {{are more likely to be}} stage I at diagnosis. Overall, they metastasize more frequently than epithelial ovarian cancers. In addition, the cancer markers used vary with tumor type: choriocarcinomas are monitored with beta-HCG and endodermal sinus tumors with alpha-fetoprotein.|$|E
50|$|An <b>isochromosome</b> can be {{abbreviated}} as i(chromosome {{number and}} arm). For example, an <b>isochromosome</b> of chromosome 17 containing two q arms {{can be identified}} as i(17q).|$|E
50|$|An <b>isochromosome</b> is an {{unbalanced}} {{structural abnormality}} {{in which the}} arms of the chromosome are mirror images of each other. The chromosome consists of two copies of either the long (q) arm or the short (p) arm because <b>isochromosome</b> formation is equivalent to a simultaneous duplication and deletion of genetic material. Consequently, there is partial trisomy of the genes present in the <b>isochromosome</b> and partial monosomy of the genes in the lost arm.|$|E
40|$|Uniparental {{isodisomy}} {{resulting from}} the simultaneous presence of <b>isochromosomes</b> of the p and q arms of a chromosome and absence of a normal homologue is an exceptionally rare event. We have observed a growth-retarded female infant in whom the normal chromosome 7 homologues were replaced by what appeared cytogenetically to be <b>isochromosomes</b> of 7 p and 7 q. Polymorphic microsatellite loci spanning the length of 7 p and 7 q were analyzed in the proband and her parents to ascertain the parental origin and extent of heterozygosity of the proband's rearranged chromosomes. These studies demonstrated that the 7 p alleles of the proband were derived only from the father, the 7 q alleles were derived only from the mother, and there was homozygosity for all chromosome 7 loci analyzed. The mechanisms leading {{to the formation of}} the proband's <b>isochromosomes</b> could reflect abnormalities of cell division occurring at meiosis, postfertilization mitosis, or both. We believe that the present case may result from incomplete mitotic interchange in the pericentromeric regions of chromosome 7 homologues, with resolution by sister-chromatid reunion in an early, if not first, zygotic division. Phenotypically, our proband resembled three previously reported cases of maternal isodisomy for chromosome 7, suggesting that lack of paternal genes from 7 q may result in a phenotype of short stature and growth retardation...|$|R

40|$|We report {{here on the}} {{successful}} painting of a specific plant chromosome within its own genome. <b>Isochromosomes</b> for the long arm of chromosome 5 of the wheat B genome (5 BL) were microdissected from first meiotic metaphase spreads of a monoisosomic 5 BL line of the common wheat Triticum aestivum cv. Chinese Spring. The dissected <b>isochromosomes</b> were amplified by degenerate oligonucleotide-primed PCR in a single tube reaction. The amplified DNA {{was used as a}} complex probe mixture for fluorescent in situ hybridization on first meiotic metaphase spreads of lines carrying 5 BL as a distinctive marker. Hybridization signals were observed, specifically, along the entire 5 BL. In some of the cells, labeling was also detected in two bivalents, presumably those of the 5 B "homoeologues" (partial homologues) found in common wheat (5 A and 5 D). The probe also revealed discrete domains in tapetal nuclei at interphase, further supporting the probe's high specificity. These data suggest that chromosome and homoeologous group-specific sequences are more abundant in 5 BL than genome-specific sequences. Chromosome-painting probes, such as the one described here for 5 BL, can facilitate the study of chromosome evolution in polyploid wheat...|$|R
50|$|The <b>isochromosome</b> i(12p) can be {{primarily}} detected in samples of skin fibroblasts, {{as well as}} in chorionic villus and amniotic fluid cell samples. Very rarely, it can also be detected in blood lymphocytes. It is also possible to detect the <b>isochromosome</b> in circulating lymphocytes, as well as other amniotic and placental samples. There is no strict limit as to where the <b>isochromosome</b> can be found. However, it is often unlikely that these samples will be tested when the blood karyotype is normal.|$|E
50|$|The {{tetrasomy}} {{can also}} be formed independently of cell division. Double stranded breaks in the short arm of chromosome 9 may be repaired incorrectly, resulting {{in the formation of}} an <b>isochromosome</b> of 9p with a single centromere. This <b>isochromosome</b> can then be passed on during cell division.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} <b>isochromosome</b> is the X sex chromosome. Acrocentric {{autosomal}} chromosomes 13, 14, 15, 21, and 22 are also common candidates for <b>isochromosome</b> formation. Chromosomes containing smaller arms {{are more likely}} to become isochromosomes because the loss of genetic material in those arms can be tolerated.|$|E
50|$|The {{tetrasomy}} {{is typically}} {{caused by the}} incorrect distribution of chromosomes during meiosis or mitosis, called nondisjunction. When cell division occurs normally, each daughter cell receives one short arm and one long arm of each chromosome. However, errors during this process may cause one daughter cell to receive two short arms of chromosome 9, while the other cell receives two long arms. The identical arms are subsequently connected via a centromere. In most cases, <b>isochromosomes</b> of 9p contain two centromeres, called a dicentric chromosome.|$|R

Four cases had results indicative of an isochromosome: one t(14 q 14 q) case with mild mental retardation and maternal uniparental disomy (UPD) for chromosome 14, one t(15 q 15 q) case with the Prader-Willi syndrome and UPD(15), a phenotypically normal carrier of t(22 q 22 q) with maternal UPD(22), and a phenotypically normal t(21 q 21 q) case of paternal UPD(21). All UPD cases showed complete homozygosity throughout the involved chromosome, which is supportive of a postmeiotic origin. In the remaining four cases, maternal and paternal inheritance of the involved chromosome was found, which unambiguously implies a somatic origin. One t(15 q 15 q) female had a child with a ring chromosome 15, which was also of probable postmeiotic origin as recombination between grandparental haplotypes had occurred prior to ring formation. UPD might be expected to result from de novo Robertsonian translocations of meiotic origin; however, all de novo homologous translocation cases, so far reported, with UPD of chromosomes 14, 15, 21, or 22 have been <b>isochromosomes.</b> These data provide the first direct evidence that nonmosaic Robertsonian translocations, as well as <b>isochromosomes,</b> are commonly the result of a mitotic exchange...|$|R

Other characterized syndromes have also been linked to pseudodicentric chromosomes, such as Edwards syndrome, a trisomy of chromosome 18, and Turner syndrome, a loss (or partial loss) of the X chromosome. Pseudodicentric chromosomes alone do not define these syndromes, because the contribution of other chromosomal abnormalities are also considered, such as the presence of <b>isochromosomes</b> in Turner patients.|$|R

40|$|Recently we {{developed}} a novel strategy for differentially painting all 24 human chromosomes. It is termed COBRA–FISH, short for combined binary ratio labeling–fluorescence in situ hybridization. COBRA–FISH is distinct from the pure combinatorial approach in that only 4 instead of 5 fluorophores are needed to achieve color discrimination of 24 targets. Furthermore, multiplicity can be increased to 48 by introduction of a fifth fluorophore. Here we show that color identification by COBRA–FISH {{of all of the}} p and q arms of human chromosomes is feasible, and we apply the technique for detecting and elucidating intra- and interchromosomal rearrangements. Compared with 24 -color whole chromosome painting FISH, PQ-COBRA–FISH considerably enhances the ability to determine the composition of rearranged chromosomes as demonstrated by the identification of pericentric inversions and <b>isochromosomes</b> as well as the elucidation of the arm identity of chromosomal material involved in complex translocations that occur in solid tumors...|$|R
50|$|The extra {{chromosome}} content {{can arise}} through several different ways. The {{most common cause}} (about 92-95% of cases) is a complete extra copy of chromosome 21, resulting in trisomy 21. In 1.0 to 2.5% of cases, some of the cells in the body are normal and others have trisomy 21, known as mosaic Down syndrome. The other common mechanisms that can give rise to Down syndrome include: a Robertsonian translocation, <b>isochromosome,</b> or ring chromosome. These contain additional material from chromosome 21 and occur in about 2.5% of cases. An <b>isochromosome</b> results when the two long arms of a chromosome separate together rather than the long and short arm separating together during egg or sperm development.|$|E
50|$|Neoplasia is {{uncontrolled}} cell growth, {{resulting in}} the creation of a tumour. In many different forms of neoplasia, <b>isochromosome</b> 17q is the most frequent neoplasia associated <b>isochromosome</b> and corresponds with poor patient survival. Unique DNA sequences, known as low copy repeats, occur in the pericentric region of the p arm, so a crossover event in that area can create a dicentric <b>isochromosome</b> through U-type strand exchange. The neoplasia created from i(17q) is caused by a decrease and increase in gene dosage from the monosomy of the p arm and trisomy of the q arm, respectively. Many candidate tumour suppressor genes are found on the lost p arm, allowing the tumour cell population to be maintained. It is debated whether the loss of tumour suppressor gene p53, located on 17p, is involved in the central pathogenesis of some neoplasia. The presence of one p53 gene can be functionally active, but its relation to other oncogenes can alter its expression levels when present only in one copy. Since the genetic sequences involved in i(17q) neoplasia are large, it is difficult to determine which genes, or combination of genes, are involved in tumour growth.|$|E

By analyzing {{a large number}} of <b>isochromosomes</b> of the long arm of chromosome X (i(Xq)), using whole genome tiling path array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH), ultra-high resolution targeted aCGH and sequencing, we provide evidence that the FoSTeS and MMBIR mechanisms can generate large-scale gross chromosomal rearrangements leading to the deletion and duplication of entire chromosome arms, thus suggesting an important role for DNA replication-based mechanisms in both the development of genomic disorders and cancer. Furthermore, we elucidate the mechanisms of dicentric i(Xq) (idic(Xq)) formation and show that most idic(Xq) chromosomes result from non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) between palindromic low copy repeats (LCRs) and highly homologous palindromic LINE elements. We also show that nonrecurrent-breakpoint idic(Xq) chromosomes have microhomology-associated breakpoint junctions and are likely catalyzed by microhomology-mediated replication-dependent recombination (MMRDR) mechanisms such as FoSTeS and MMBIR.
