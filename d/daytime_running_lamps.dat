5000|$|A <b>daytime</b> <b>running</b> <b>lamp</b> (DRL, also <b>daytime</b> <b>running</b> light) is an {{automotive}} lighting and bicycle lighting device {{on the front}} of a roadgoing motor vehicle or bicycle, automatically switched on when the vehicle is moving forward, emitting white, yellow, or amber light to increase the [...] of the vehicle during daylight conditions.|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} an {{extension}} of the previously published two-step freeform optics tailoring algorithm using a Monge-Kantorovich mass transportation framework. The algorithm's ability to design multiple freeform surfaces allows for the inclusion of multiple distinct light paths and hence the implementation of multiple lighting functions in a single optical element.

25|$|The fourth {{generation}} GS had its world premiere at the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance in California in August 2011. The vehicle {{was shown to}} have a more subtle version of the LF-Gh's spindle grille, while overall exterior dimensions are almost identical to the previous generation. L-shaped LED front <b>daytime</b> <b>running</b> <b>lamps</b> and rear LED tube lamps are a new design feature. The new GS was the centerpiece of Toyota chairman Akio Toyoda's initiative to restore passion to the Lexus brand and better compete with German luxury automakers that had been gaining market share in the United States. It was reported that Toyoda initially opposed the styling choices made for the new model, but since thanked the design team that persuaded him to greenlight the project.|$|E

Adoption of LEDs for other signal functions on passenger cars is gradually increasing with demand for the technology and related styling updates. In North America, the 2000 Cadillac Deville was the first passenger car with LED taillights. The 2002 Kia Opirus/Amanti was an early adopter of LED front turn signals.
