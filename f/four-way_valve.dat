40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} control {{approach}} that provides significant energy savings {{for the control}} of pneumatic servo systems. The control methodology is formulated by decoupling the standard <b>four-way</b> spool <b>valve</b> used for pneumatic servo control into two three-way valves, then using the resulting two control degrees of freedom to simultaneously satisfy a performance constraint based on the sliding mode sliding condition, and an energy-saving dynamic constraint that mini-mizes cylinder pressures. The control formulation is presented, followed by experimental results that indicate significant energetic savings with essentially no compromise in tracking perform-ance relative to a standard sliding mode approach. Relative to a standard <b>four-way</b> spool <b>valve</b> controlled pneumatic servo actuator under sliding mode control, the experimental results indicate energy savings of 27 to 45 %, depending on the desired tracking frequency.

This system is integrated with a solar roof, {{which is used}} as a thermal source to provide heat in winter months (HP mode) and electricity in summer months (ORC mode) when an excess irradiation is available on the solar roof. The main advantage of the proposed unit is its similarity with a traditional HP: the HP/ORC unit only requires the addition of a pump and <b>four-way</b> <b>valves</b> compared to a simple HP, which can be achieved at a low cost. A methodology for the optimal sizing and design of the system is proposed, based on the optimization of both continuous parameters such as heat exchanger size or discrete variables such as working fluid.

40|$|Abstract. Conventional {{electro-hydraulic}} precision {{motion control}} systems {{are controlled by}} either servo valves or proportional directional control valves. Neither of the valves are {{able to control the}} pressures at the two cylinder chambers independently or to use the regeneration flow. The result is that while precision motion control is possible, significant energy saving is not. In order to save energy while maintaining excellent motion performance, the independent control of the pressures at the two cylinder chambers and the accurate use of the regeneration flow are two key factors. The programmable valves, a combination of five independently controlled poppet-type cartridge valves, break the mechanical linkage between the meter-in and meter-out orifices, maintain the full functionality of conventional <b>four-way</b> <b>valves</b> and enable the accurate control of the regeneration flow via the true cross port valve. Therefore, the programmable valves are capable of both precision motion control and significant energy saving. This paper introduces the configuration of the programmable valves as well as how to control the programmable valves to achieve the dual objectives of precision motion control and energy saving.

40|$|Abstract—Proportional poppet-type {{cartridge}} valves are the {{key elements}} of the energy-saving programmable valves, which {{have been shown to}} be able to achieve good motion control performance while significantly saving energy usage in our previous studies. Unlike costly conventional <b>four-way</b> <b>valves,</b> the cartridge valve has a simple structure and is easy to manufacture, but the complicated mathematical model of its flow mapping makes the controller design and implementation rather difficult. Although off-line individually calibrated or manufacturer supplied flow mappings of the cartridge valves can be used, neither method is ideal for wide industrial applications. The former method is time-consuming and needs additional flow sensors while the latter may lead to significantly degraded control performance due to the inaccuracy of the manufacturer supplied flow mappings. Furthermore, due to inevitable system worn out and/or changing working conditions, actual cartridge valve flow mapping may change significantly over the life span of the system and need to be updated periodically in order to maintain the same level of control performance. Sometime, it may be even impractical to do off-line calibrations once the valve leaves the manufacturing plant. To solve this practically significant problem, this paper focuses on the automated onboard modeling of the cartridge valve flow mappings without using any extra sensors and removing the valves from the system. The estimation of flow mappings is based on the pressure dynamics of the hydraulic cylinder with the consideration of effects of some unknown system parameters such as the effective bulk modulus of the working fluid. Localized orthogonal basis functions are proposed to bypass the lack of persistent exciting identification data over the entire domain of the flow mapping during onboard experiments. Experimental results are obtained to illustrate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed novel automated modeling method.

This paper presents a defrosting method for air-to-water screw heat pumps, i. e. the cross hot-gas bypass defrosting method, which uses two air heat exchangers for hot air from one air heat exchanger to melt the frost and absorb heat from another heat exchanger through the corresponding <b>four-way</b> reversing <b>valve.</b> The principle and process of this method are illustrated. The dynamic characteristics are experimentally investigated on a 359 kW air-to-water screw heat pump. The discharge temperature of the unit is at the normal range and the pressure varies little.

They are widely-used because their design is simple, they are available in wide range of number of ports, they have high efficiency and smooth flow rate, and {{they are easy to}} operate and maintained.

40|$|AbstractDigital {{hydraulic}} valve {{system is a}} new kind of hydraulic control valve assembly, which has potential to save energy and improve performance of valve controlled actuators. The typical digital valve system has 4 - 6 parallel connected on/off valves per control edge totaling 16 - 24 valves in the <b>four-way</b> <b>valve</b> configuration. The flow capacities of the parallel connected valves are set according to the powers of two such {{that it is possible to}} achieve 2 N different flow rates with N valves. An alternative approach is to use equally sized valves, which means that N parallel connected valves give only N+ 1 different flow rates. This approach has several benefits, but the number of valves becomes very large. This paper shows that it is possible to implement valve assembly having 128 miniaturized valves, such that it can be installed instead of traditional CETOP 3 servo or proportional valve. Careful electromagnetic optimization and mechatronic design are used together with novel manufacturing methods and new type of power electronics. The prototype is build and experimentally studied and results show that the performance of this kind of digital valve system is superior to traditional four-way control valves in terms of response time and fault tolerance...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} a heat pump is to control the {{temperature}} of an enclosed space. This is done by using heat exchange with a heat source, for example water, air, or ground. In the {{air source heat pump}} that has been studied during this master thesis, a refrigerant exchanges heat with the outdoor air and with a water distribution system. The heat pump is controlled through the circuit containing the refrigerant and it is therefore crucial that this circuit is functional. To ensure this, a diagnosis system has been created, to be able to detect and isolate sensor errors. The diagnosis system is based on mathematical models of the refrigerant circuit with its main components: a compressor, an expansion valve, a plate heat exchanger, an air heat exchanger, and a <b>four-way</b> <b>valve.</b> Data has been collected from temperature- and pressure sensors on an air source heat pump. The data has then been divided into data for model estimation and data for model validation. The models are used to create test quantities, which in turn are used by a diagnosis algorithm to determine whether an error has occurred or not. There are nine temperature sensors and two pressure sensors on the studied air source heat pump. Four fault modes have been investigated for each sensor: Stuck, Offset, Short circuit and Open circuit. The designed diagnosis system is able to detect all of the investigated error modes and isolate 40 out of 44 single errors. However, there is room for improvement by constructing more test quantities to detect errors and decouple more fault modes. To further develop the diagnosis system, the existing models can be improved and new models can be created...|$|E

A sketch showing the basic concept of the vibrator design is shown in Chapter 1.

40|$|A {{system has}} been {{developed}} and qualified as flight hardware for the measurement of micturition volumes voided by crewmen during Gemini missions. This Chemical Urine Volume Measurement System (CUVMS) is used for obtaining samples of each micturition for post-flight volume determination and laboratory analysis for chemical constituents of physiological interest. The system is versatile with respect to volumes measured, with a capacity beyond the largest micturition expected to be encountered, and with respect to mission duration of inherently indefinite length. The urine sample {{is used for the}} measurement of total micturition volume by a tracer dilution technique, in which a fixed, predetermined amount of tritiated water is introduced and mixed into the voided urine, and the resulting concentration of the tracer in the sample is determined with a liquid scintillation spectrometer.

It was assumed that all the state variables are defined as the perturbations in the physical quantities; therefore, linearized relations were used. These linearized relations were combined to form the state-variable representation of the model;The model was then simulated to investigate the control characteristics of the proposed system. The responses of a stand alone flapper-nozzle valve were evaluated first. Excellent agreement between the experimental data and theoretical data of output pressure rise of the valve was found;The open-loop system performance of the axial piston pump and flapper-nozzle valve combination was unstable. To enhance {{the stability of the}} system, an optimal control design was applied. It was found that the computed results of the nonaugmented optimal design lack robustness for improving the existing control system. Thus the augmented optimal control method was used to enhance the system performances;Time responses of the augmented optimal control system were evaluated. It was observed that the increase of input current had little effect on the system responses. Doubling the discharge flow rate also doubled the overshoot. Whereas increasing the discharge volume tended to slow down the system responses. Finally, the increase of the rotational speed of the pump shaft produced a higher overshoot and a slower response of the system;The performances of the control of an axial piston pump using a flapper-nozzle valve as a controller were compared to the performances of using a <b>four-way</b> hydraulic <b>valve,</b> a single-stage electrohydraulic servovalve, and a two-stage electrohydraulic servovalve as controllers.
