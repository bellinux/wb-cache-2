5|$|Hitler {{created a}} public {{image as a}} celibate man without a {{domestic}} life, dedicated entirely to his political mission and the nation. He met his lover, Eva Braun, in 1929, and married her in April 1945. In September 1931, his half-niece, Geli Raubal, took her own life with Hitler's gun in his Munich apartment. It was rumoured among contemporaries that Geli was in a romantic relationship with <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> death {{was a source of}} deep, lasting pain. Paula Hitler, the younger sister of Hitler and the last living member of his immediate family, died in 1960.|$|E

She begins dating Jesse McGregor (Ben Unwin), {{but it does not}} last. She starts feuding with Jack Holden and they realise they are falling in love with each other. They later begin a relationship. Martha plays a joke on Jack, which goes wrong and he hits his head. At the hospital, Jack is told he is deaf. Jack blames Martha for the {{accident}} and they split up.|$|E
5|$|Princess Victoria of Kent is the heiress {{presumptive}} to {{the throne}} during {{the last years of}} the reign of her uncle King William IV and is subject to a political tug of war for influence over her. On the one side is her mother, the Duchess of Kent, along with the comptroller of the Duchess's household, Sir John Conroy, who tries to force Victoria to sign papers declaring a regency and giving <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> mother power.|$|E
60|$|She {{turned her}} left {{shoulder}} upon <b>him</b> <b>and</b> addressed <b>her</b> host.|$|R
60|$|She snuggled up to <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> laid <b>her</b> {{cheek against}} his breast.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked at}} <b>him</b> strangely, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> face was white with pain.|$|R
5|$|The groom Shiva {{is shown}} calm and young, while Parvati is {{depicted}} as shy and emotional. Her head is tilted towards <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> eyelids joyfully lowered, while his hand (now broken) is holding hers. Their dress reflect the Hindu customs. He wears the sacred thread across his chest, she the customary jewelry. The other characters shown in the wedding carry items or are shown holding items that typically grace a Hindu wedding. Chandra (moon god), for example, holds a traditionally decorated water vessel (kalash). Brahma, the priest, is squatting {{on the floor to}} the right tending the yajna fire (agni mandapa).|$|E
5|$|Cibber and Katherine had 12 {{children}} between 1694 and 1713. Six died in infancy, {{and most of}} the surviving children received short shrift in his will. Catherine, the eldest surviving daughter, married Colonel James Brown and seems to have been the dutiful one who looked after Cibber in old age following his wife's death in 1734. She was duly rewarded at his death with most of his estate. His middle daughters, Anne and Elizabeth, went into business. Anne had a shop that sold fine wares and foods, and married John Boultby. Elizabeth had a restaurant near Gray's Inn, and married firstly Dawson Brett, and secondly (after Brett's death) Joseph Marples. His only son to reach adulthood, Theophilus, became an actor at Drury Lane, and was an embarrassment to his father because of his scandalous private life. His other son to survive infancy, James, died in or after 1717 before reaching adulthood. Colley's youngest daughter Charlotte followed in her father's theatrical footsteps, but she fell out with <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> sister Catherine, and she was cut off by the family.|$|E
5|$|During this time, Chad meets {{and falls}} in love with Whitney Russell. Their {{relationship}} is complicated by her sister Simone Russell's crush on <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> parent's disapproval of him. Eve discourages both of her children from pursuing a relationship with Chad, fearing he will be a bad influence on her daughter in the same way Julian was on her teenage self. Whitney and Chad keep their romantic and sexual encounters secret for years while he pretends to be in love with Simone. The love triangle continues until Simone catches Whitney kissing Chad. Simone breaks up publicly with Chad and tells everyone in Harmony about his relationship with Whitney. During 2003, Chad's connection to Whitney steadily unravels after the discovery of his marriage to Latoya and her attempt to murder Whitney.|$|E

5|$|In June 2013, Dimitri {{received}} an Email from his old friend, and former lover, Brooke English. Brooke {{was shocked when}} Dimitri responded by showing up at her door, {{and told him that}} she thought she'd never see him again. Dimitri revealed that he and Alex had divorced, and that he had not bothered remaining in touch with Edmund's family and had reverted to his reclusive ways, but that Europe was beginning to bore <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> timing couldn't have been better. Upon returning to town, he stopped by his former residence, Wildwind, only to find that the place was empty. Brooke explained that after its last occupant, Caleb Cortlandt, had moved out, Sam and Maddie, Edmund's children, had not bothered to rent the mansion out again. Dimitri told Brooke that, while at Wildwind, he stopped by the mausoleum and made amends to Edmund, who had died in a fire 8 years earlier.|$|E
5|$|Shakespeare {{also uses}} sub-plots {{to offer a}} clearer view {{of the actions of}} the main characters. For example, when the play begins, Romeo is in love with Rosaline, who has refused all of his advances. Romeo's infatuation with her stands in obvious {{contrast}} to his later love for Juliet. This provides a comparison through which the audience can see the seriousness of Romeo and Juliet's love and marriage. Paris' love for Juliet also sets up a contrast between Juliet's feelings for <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> feelings for Romeo. The formal language she uses around Paris, as well as the way she talks about him to her Nurse, show that her feelings clearly lie with Romeo. Beyond this, the sub-plot of the Montague–Capulet feud overarches the whole play, providing an atmosphere of hate that is the main contributor to the play's tragic end.|$|E
5|$|The Countess {{was left}} rich under Leicester's will; yet the {{discharge}} of his overwhelming debts diminished her wealth. In 1604–1605 she successfully defended her widow's rights in court when her possessions and her good name were threatened by the Earl's illegitimate son, Robert Dudley, who claimed that he was his father's legitimate heir, thus implicitly declaring her marriage bigamous. Lettice Knollys was always close to her large family circle. Helpless at the political eclipse of her eldest son, the second Earl of Essex, she lost both <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> third husband to the executioner in 1601. From the 1590s she lived chiefly in the Staffordshire countryside, where, in reasonably good health until the end, she died at age 91 on Christmas Day 1634.|$|E
60|$|With those words, {{she passed}} <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> laid <b>her</b> {{hand on the}} door.|$|R
60|$|They were nearing Westminster. Julien {{drew his}} wife towards <b>him</b> <b>and</b> kissed <b>her.</b>|$|R
60|$|She shot {{a glance}} at <b>him</b> <b>and</b> shrugged <b>her</b> shoulders. She was evidently displeased.|$|R
5|$|On 16 January 1945, {{following}} the Wehrmacht's {{defeat in the}} Battle of the Bulge, Misch {{and the rest of}} Hitler's personal staff moved into the Führerbunker and Vorbunker under the Reich Chancellery garden in Berlin. His FBK commanding officer, Franz Schädle, appointed Misch to be the bunker telephone operator. Misch handled all of the direct communication from the bunker. He did not leave it for any significant period of time until the war ended in May 1945. On 22 April 1945, Schädle called him on the phone and told him there was a place reserved for his wife and young daughter on one of the last planes out of Berlin. Misch was temporarily released from duty and drove to pick up his family to take them to the aircraft. However, his wife refused to take their daughter and leave <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> parents in Berlin. Upon returning to the Reich Chancellery, Misch learned that Hitler was releasing most of the remaining staff to leave Berlin. By that date, as the Red Army was entering Berlin, propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels and his wife Magda brought their six young children to stay in the Vorbunker. Joseph Goebbels moved into the room next to Misch's telephone exchange in the lower level of the Führerbunker. The Goebbels children would play in the corridor around Misch's post.|$|E
25|$|Miss Oneeta: Mr. Sengupta's obese, talkative, self-important, {{overwhelmingly}} emotional, generous wife, {{disappointed in}} her husband after he has eloped with Soraya. In her dismay, she disowns <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> married name. It is she who reveals that Soraya has deserted her family and that her act has given Haroun his disorder, and also announces her return.|$|E
25|$|In 1958, Peter Hall, who {{had been}} {{appointed}} to run the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, approached Ashcroft with his plans for a permanent company, with bases in Stratford and London, and a regular, salaried company, presenting a mixture of classical and new plays. Ashcroft immediately agreed to join <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> lead was, in Hall's view, key {{to the success of}} the new Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC).|$|E
60|$|She stepped {{close up}} to <b>him</b> <b>and</b> rested <b>her</b> hand lightly upon his shoulder.|$|R
60|$|She {{stretched}} a hand towards <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> dropping <b>her</b> {{head on his}} bosom, wept.|$|R
60|$|She {{dropped into}} a chair before <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> put <b>her</b> cold hand on his arm.|$|R
25|$|In late July 2006, {{not long}} after Greg has been killed, Josh finally discovers the truth about his birth {{at the opening of}} the nightclub ConFusion. He is devastated and decides to leave town. Erica tries to explain to him that she does not hate <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> reasons for making the {{decision}} to have an abortion all those years ago, but Josh does not want to listen to her.|$|E
25|$|In {{the course}} of the next few years Lokhvitskaya {{published}} dozens of new poems including the extensive <b>Him</b> <b>and</b> <b>Her.</b> Two Words (Он и Она. Два слова) and two epic dramas, Eastward (На пути к Востоку) and Vandelin. Springtime Fairytale. By the time her Volume III (1898–1900) came out, Lokhvitskaya was Russia's most popular and best-loved woman poet. Far from enjoying her stardom, though, she spent the last five years of her life in physical pain and mental turmoil.|$|E
25|$|On February 9, 1864, Custer married Elizabeth Clift Bacon (1842–1933), whom he {{had first}} seen when he was ten years old. He had been {{socially}} introduced to her in November 1862, when home in Monroe on leave. She was not initially impressed with <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> father, Judge Daniel Bacon, disapproved of Custer as a match {{because he was the}} son of a blacksmith. It was not until well after Custer had been promoted to the rank of brevet brigadier general that he gained the approval of Judge Bacon. He married Elizabeth Bacon fourteen months after they formally met.|$|E
60|$|She {{poured out}} <b>her</b> {{grievance}} to <b>him</b> <b>and</b> suggested <b>her</b> scheme. She even elaborated it.|$|R
60|$|She {{rose and}} went up to <b>him</b> <b>and</b> placed <b>her</b> white fingers upon his arm.|$|R

25|$|In 1886 the ten-year-old Zewditu {{was married}} to Ras Araya Selassie Yohannes, son and heir of Emperor Yohannes IV. The {{marriage}} was political, having been arranged when Menelik agreed to submit to Yohannes' rule. Yohannes and Menelik eventually fell into conflict again, however, with Menelik launching a rebellion against Yohannes' rule. Zewditu's marriage was childless, being very young during her marriage, although her husband had fathered a son by another woman. When Araya Selassie died in 1888, she left Mekele {{and returned to her}} father's court in Shewa. Despite the hostility between Menelik and Yohannes, Zewditu managed throughout the conflict to maintain good relations with both. In a sign of his high regard and affection for his daughter-in-law, Emperor Yohannes IV sent Zewditu back to Shewa with a large gift of valuable cattle, at a time when relations between <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> father were at a particularly low point.|$|E
25|$|Magda and Ruggero {{have been}} living {{together}} on the French Riviera for some months. They talk about their first meeting and happiness together, living quietly by the sea. Ruggero tells Magda that he has written to his mother to ask for money to pay their growing debts and for her consent to his marriage to Magda. Ruggero imagines their happy married life and the child they may have (Aria: Dimmi che vuoi seguirmi). Magda is deeply touched, but also uneasy: she knows that her past life as a courtesan would make her unacceptable to Ruggero's family, and possibly to Ruggero if he knew who she really was. As Ruggero leaves to post his letter she meditates on her dilemma, torn between her desire to tell Ruggero everything, her wish not to hurt <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> fear of losing his love. Prunier and Lisette arrive. Lisette has had a brief and disastrous career as a music-hall singer: her performance in Nice the previous evening was a catastrophe. She and Prunier bicker with each other while waiting for Magda. When Magda appears, Lisette begs for her job back, and Magda consents. Prunier expresses surprise that Magda can be happy away from Paris, and delivers a message to Magda from Rambaldo: he is happy to take her back on any terms. Magda refuses to listen. Prunier takes his leave of Lisette (first arranging a rendezvous with her for that evening) and Lisette resumes her duties as Magda's maid. Ruggero returns with a letter from his mother, in which she says that if Ruggero's fiancée has all the virtues he has described to her, {{he will have a}} blissful marriage. She looks forward to welcoming the couple to her home and sends Magda a kiss. Magda is unable to keep her secret any longer. She tells Ruggero about her past and declares that she can never be his wife – she would cause his parents too much grief. Ruggero implores Magda not to abandon him (Ma come puoi lasciarmi), but Magda is adamant that they cannot remain together, and that Ruggero must return home. Like a swallow, she flies back to Rambaldo and her old life, leaving Ruggero behind, devastated.|$|E
500|$|In 1916, Coolbrith sent {{copies of}} her poetry {{collections}} to her cousin Joseph F. Smith who publicized her {{sending them to}} <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> identity as a niece of Joseph Smith, which upset her. She told him that [...] "To be crucified for a faith in which you believe is to be blessed. To be crucified for one in which you do not believe is to be crucified indeed." [...] She assured him she was not angry but she certainly was not pleased.|$|E
