Another group of people involves people with severe limb injuries. The sick people who are expected to undergo amputation are admitted to hospitals at surgical ortraumatology standard wards or intensive care units, and it is necessary that nurses have theoretical knowledge as well as practical nursing skills related to those patients because if a sick person wants to start a full-value life after the amputation, he or she needs to be provided with a quality nursing care. The nursing care is multidisciplinary because it <b>involves</b> <b>care</b> <b>provided</b> not only by medical professionals at emergencies, rehabilitation wards and ambulances but also by technical orthopaedic professionals. The thesis has two objectives. The first objective was find out whether the nurses can care of the patients with an amputated limb. The second objective was to find out whether the nurse apply a holistic approach to care. These objectives were given three hypotheses. Hypotheses 1 : The nurse follow correct procedures while taking care of the client after the amputation. Hypotheses 2 : The nurses have enough information on care of the client after the amputation. Hypothesis 3 : The nurses focus on physical needs of the client. All three hypotheses have not been confirmed. The objectives of the thesis have been fulfilled.

40|$|Excerpt] Extended working {{lives and}} life expectancies mean that {{increasing}} numbers of workers in Europe, especially older workers, are now <b>providing</b> <b>care</b> for dependent relatives while they are in employment. Although many actors are <b>involved</b> in <b>providing</b> <b>care</b> – the state, family, companies and social partners – it is still {{for the most part}} delivered by unpaid family members. Given the range of institutional policy frameworks with vested interests in the area of reconciling work and care, it is difficult to arrive at a coordinated strategy. Families often tend to organise care themselves, delegating care to family members who have the least opportunity costs. But with increasing employment participation at an older age, carers are nowadays more likely to be still engaged in paid work. This report highlights the issue of people of working age combining employment with <b>providing</b> <b>care</b> to dependent relatives, either children or older persons. It analyses the situation of working carers, how they manage to combine work and care and what measures are available to support them in their responsibilities beyond their professional activity. The study examines developments in national labour legislation, collective agreements and company initiatives. It is based on responses to a questionnaire completed by Eurofound’s network of European correspondents in all 28 EU Member States...|$|R

In 2007, professors from Penn State Abington {{analyzed}} the tradeoff between working overtime and home and family life activities. A major find was that workers struggled to take time off for personal or family needs. However, the additional income from working long hours could limit the actual impact of this loss of time. More specifically, the impact of having a child exponentially increase the impact of working overtime. Especially at a young age, it is very important for children development for the parents to be <b>involved</b> to <b>provide</b> <b>care</b> and positive experiences.

40|$|Objective: People with {{advanced}} cancer who {{may benefit from}} specialised palliative care (SPC) do not necessarily access such services. Methods: To obtain {{a deeper understanding of}} issues affecting access to SPC, five focus groups were undertaken with nurses (35), physicians (three), allied health professionals (seven) and an academic <b>involved</b> in <b>providing</b> <b>care.</b> Results: Thematic analysis revealed that palliative care providers consistently view palliative care as a broad holistic approach to care benchmarked on good symptom management. Whilst participants themselves perceived SPC as aiming to maximise {{the quality of life of}} the patient and family across all domains of care, they perceived that some health professionals and community members viewed palliative care largely as symptom control and terminal care for access after all disease-modifying treatment has been exhausted. Concern was expressed that such misconceptions were an important barrier to timely SPC.

METHODSThis nationwide population-based survey included 622 (73 %) of 851 youths who, 6 to 9 years earlier, at age 13 to 16 years, lost a parent to cancer.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{access to}} health care by poorer residents in Chennai, India. It reveals constraining and enabling conditions for impoverished users seeking treatment. We explore patterns of health-seeking behaviour through the reasoning of residents themselves as well as stakeholders <b>involved</b> in <b>providing</b> <b>care</b> for these users. Particular attention is paid to the needy residents' preference for private health care providers despite the costs involved and that free public facilities are available. We address this issue by combining Sen's entitlement approach with Penchansky and Thomas' work on {{access to health}} care. Based on data gathered in a qualitative field-based research design including interviews with 14 residents and 58 stakeholders <b>involved</b> in <b>caring</b> for poor people, we argue that the availability of health care facilities within walking distance is a necessary but not sufficient precondition for satisfactory access. Rather, we demonstrate the influence of 'entitlements to health care' which allow poor households that are endowed with resources such as income, knowledge and social networks to realise access. The narratives we present reveal not only experiences of health care, but also feelings about its utilisation. The latter, we contend, are crucial in determining choice of health care facilities. This finding suggests that analyses of affordability and physical {{access to health care}} in less developed countries should include a focus on emotional dimensions of utilisation.
