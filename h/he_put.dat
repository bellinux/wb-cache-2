5|$|Chaptal did not {{consider}} his experiment a success. When he retired in 1946, <b>he</b> <b>put</b> the condenser out of order, possibly {{because he did not}} want to leave an improper installation to mislead those who might later continue studies on air wells.|$|E

5000|$|What was Rabbi Akiva like? - A {{worker who}} goes {{out with his}} basket. He finds wheat - <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> it in, barley - <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> it in, spelt - <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> it in, beans - <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> it in, lentils - <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> it in. When he arrives home he sorts out the wheat by itself, barley by itself, spelt by itself, beans by themselves, lentils by themselves. So did Rabbi Akiva; he {{arranged}} the Torahrings by rings. Avot deRabbi Natan ch. 18; see also Gittin, 67a ...|$|R

5|$|Pennant's first {{publications}} were scientific {{papers on}} the earthquake he had experienced, other geological subjects and palaeontology. One of these so impressed Carl Linnaeus, that in 1757, <b>he</b> <b>put</b> Pennant's name forward and he was duly elected {{a member of the}} Royal Swedish Society of Sciences. Pennant felt very honoured by this and continued to correspond with Linnaeus throughout his life.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of the}} {{promotion}} for the event, Hogan appeared on Hot Properties four days prior to WrestleMania, where <b>he</b> <b>put</b> host Richard Belzer into a front chinlock —a move that cuts off {{the flow of blood}} to the brain. Belzer, however, fell to the floor unconscious and began to bleed profusely. His injury required eight stitches. Belzer later sued Hogan for $5million, but they eventually settled out of court. The night before WrestleMania, Hogan and Mr. T hosted an episode of Saturday Night Live to help promote the event.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1967, Favaloro began {{to consider the possibility}} of using the saphenous vein in coronary surgery. <b>He</b> <b>put</b> his ideas into practice {{for the first time in}} May of that year. The basic principle was to bypass a diseased (obstructed) segment in a coronary artery in order to deliver blood flow distally. The standardization of this technique, called bypass or transmyocardial revascularization surgery, was the fundamental work of his career, and ensured that his prestige would transcend the limits of his country, as the procedure radically changed the treatment of coronary disease. In 1970 he published one of his best-known volumes, Surgical Treatment of Coronary Arteriosclerosis.|$|E

5|$|Bethe {{entered the}} University of Munich in April 1926, where Sommerfeld took him on {{as a student}} on Meissner's recommendation. Sommerfeld taught an {{advanced}} course on differential equations in physics, which Bethe enjoyed. Because {{he was such a}} renowned scholar, Sommerfeld frequently received advance copies of scientific papers, which <b>he</b> <b>put</b> up for discussion at weekly evening seminars. When Bethe arrived, Sommerfeld had just received Erwin Schrödinger's papers on wave mechanics.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland posted an 11–1 {{record in}} 1951, losing their only game to the San Francisco 49ers {{in the season}} opener. That gave the Browns another spot in the {{championship}} game, again against the Rams. This time, however, the Rams won 24–17. Graham fumbled {{the ball in the}} third quarter, setting up a touchdown that put the Rams ahead 14–10. Three of his throws were intercepted, but <b>he</b> <b>put</b> up 280yards of passing and a touchdown. After the season, Graham was named the league's Most Valuable Player.|$|E

Several people responded, and one person had paid two dollars for the same sack of potatoes.|$|E

5|$|Early in {{his final}} year on campus, Middleton was once again pressed by the {{university}} president to retire from the army {{and go to work}} for the college. Again, Middleton could not do that, and began looking for a suitable follow-on assignment. Not having been overseas in over sixteen years, <b>he</b> <b>put</b> in a request for duty in the Philippines. He finished his tenure at LSU in the summer of 1936, having overseen the increase in students completing the ROTC program from about 500 to over 1700 cadets.|$|E
5|$|Following the war, {{his return}} for England came against Scotland on 12 April 1947 at Wembley, in a match which {{finished}} as a 1–1 draw. In the summer he {{took part in}} England's tour of Switzerland and Portugal. Following a surprise defeat to the Swiss, England cantered to a 10–0 win over the Portuguese, with Matthews scoring the 10th. In September, <b>he</b> <b>put</b> {{in one of his}} finest performances in an England shirt as he set up all of England's five goals in a 5–2 victory over Belgium.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} couple of years, Phillips made music {{compilation}} discs for local businesses such as the local ice rink or cinema, men singing songs for loved ones, children playing an instrument, or even a neighbour’s dog howling along to piano accompaniment. As the record shop and studio took over the business, he had a brass plate made which <b>he</b> <b>put</b> on the wall just outside the front door, and had labels made for the discs, but changed the design of the disc label every year. By 1957, Phillips was recording more and more groups of young men with guitars, basses, washboards and drums, who played skiffle.|$|E

In the following game, batting at No 9, <b>he</b> <b>put</b> on 112 for the eighth wicket with Lindsay Hassett, making 51 runs himself. He did not appear in Victoria's other Sheffield Shield matches that 1938–39 season, but later, playing against Western Australia in Perth in a first-class non-Shield match– Western Australia did not join the Sheffield Shield until after the Second World War– he took six wickets for 97 runs in Western Australia's first innings.|$|E
5|$|In the 85thminute, Scholes clipped {{the ball}} {{over the top of}} the Barcelona {{defensive}} line to Rooney, who chested the ball down for Tevez, only to be given offside. Scholes then found Rooney again on the left wing with a raking ball from deep inside his own half, but Rooney's first touch was heavy, allowing Puyol to get back and put the ball out for a corner. Rooney took the corner short to Tevez, whose cross was just beyond the reach of Berbatov and diverted behind again by Puyol. Rooney also took the second corner, which was met by Berbatov, but <b>he</b> <b>put</b> the ball high over the crossbar.|$|E
