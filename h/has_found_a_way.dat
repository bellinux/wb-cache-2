500|$|The soap opera's {{official}} website describes the character as the [...] "powerful millionaire-tycoon {{with a secret}} agenda to take everything from his long-lost mother Katherine Chancellor (Jeanne Cooper)." [...] Nichols describes Tucker as [...] "a self-made success, a regular guy who can tend bar and shoot pool and talk shit with anybody. He's very unassuming in many ways." [...] Nichols stated that he doesn't consider Tucker a villain, but considers him a [...] "player". Following the reveal that Katherine was Tucker's long lost mother, Nichols was asked if Tucker has abandonment issues, to which he stated: [...] "He has all that stuff, but he <b>has</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to create a very strong armor. He doesn’t let it break very often. He does not let anyone see his true feelings, and I think the reason {{he is such a}} player is, and it’s my take on it now, is that it’s for that very reason. He does not want to get close to anyone. He does not want to get hurt." [...] In a separate interview, the actor stated: [...] "Family and Katherine in particular means more to Tucker than he is willing to admit and his feelings for Katherine are sneaking up on him." [...] He also described the character as [...] "very, very cool, and [...] "full of a lot of fire and a lot of surprises".|$|E
500|$|Oscar Moralde from Slant Magazine {{noted that}} in the video, [...] "Gaga fully embraces the monstrous {{as a part of}} her." [...] Moralde further {{explained}} that previously the singer had acknowledged her role as [...] "Mother Monster", but never to the visceral, fully embodied extent that she does in the video. [...] "The things that are monstrous, the things that are different—for Gaga, {{those are the things that}} are beautiful," [...] he concluded. Gina Serpe from E! Online criticized it for being a [...] "Madonna rip-off", while Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone noted similarities to some of Madonna's work and the imagery from in the 1927 German expressionist film, Metropolis. Ann Powers from Los Angeles Times noted that the video paid tribute to the Goddess movement and feminism. According to her, with the video Gaga made goddess culture accessible to the mass, by portraying images borrowed from fine art, cinema and cool subcultures. Examples given by her included the portrayal of Rico as her partner, instead of a conventional-looking male or female consort. Powers further added that [...] "Gaga <b>has</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to place female empowerment at the center of her vision without sacrificing the gains she makes by being a daddy's girl or a 'boy toy'." [...] Megan Powers from Time criticized the video and Gaga's usage of shock-imagery, which she still found [...] "strange". The video has been noted for its cultural references and artistic similarities, not only to other recording artists such as Jackson and Madonna, but to Greek and Roman mythology, surrealism and the work of Swiss painter H. R. Giger and late fashion designer Alexander McQueen.|$|E

2500|$|The Munsters (1964-1966) {{featured}} [...] "Grandpa" [...] Sam Dracula, a vampire, who identifies {{himself as}} being the Count Dracula in one episode.

He still retains his abilities to turn into a wolf or a bat. Instead of the quasi-Eastern European accent usually associated with Dracula, Grandpa Munster speaks with a Brooklyn accent.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his review}} for The Guardian, Peter Bradshaw rated the film {{five out of}} five stars, calling it an [...] "astonishing debut film" [...] and [...] "a horror movie of {{extraordinary}} focus and courage". He ended his review writing: [...] "Nemes's film <b>has</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to create a fictional drama with a gaunt, fierce kind of courage...." [...] Writing for Time Out, Dave Calhoun also gave the film five out of five stars. Indiewires Eric Kohn awarded the film an A- rating, calling it [...] "a remarkable refashioning of the Holocaust drama that reignites the setting with extraordinary immediacy". In his review written for The Hollywood Reporter, Boyd van Hoeij praised the cinematography and the soundwork of the film. He writes: [...] "Shot (and shown in Cannes) on 35mm, often in sickly greens and yellows and with deep shadows, Erdely's cinematography {{is one of the}} film's major assets, but it wouldn't be half as effective without the soundwork, which {{plays a major role in}} suggesting what is happening around Saul, with audiences often forced to rely on the sound to imagine the whole, horrible picture". Writing for The Film Stage, Giovanni Marchini Camia gave the film an A rating, and called it [...] "a towering landmark for filmic fictionalizations of the Holocaust". A.A. Dowd of The A.V. Club gave the film an A- rating, and praised the movie's unique perspective: [...] "Son of Saul is the rare Holocaust drama that finds actual drama, and not just despair, in the living hell of a concentration camp". [...] "Son of Saul sees humanity in effort, identity in action; it watches someone with nothing, a man reduced to a statistic, get a piece of himself back, mostly by finding some meaning in a place of meaningless evil".|$|E
2500|$|This {{technique}} of separating the 3D image {{has been called}} a new shot in filmmaking, although it is partially comparable to shots in the first 3D feature film The Power of Love. Calum Marsh of The Dissolve said that [...] "the vocabulary of the cinema has been enriched. There is a new tool available to filmmakers: a new technique, like the jump cut before it", and that in his previous films Godard has [...] "been searching for a way to unify ideas—to join disparate images to create a new one. This shot is the realization." [...] Erin Whitney of The Huffington Post wrote that [...] "The moment is so innovative and unusual that Godard and his cinematographer, Fabrice Aragno, didn't even have a name for it (Aragno has referred to the shot as [...] "separation," [...] {{for lack of a better}} term)." [...] David Ehrlich of The Dissolve has described the technique as a [...] "choose your own adventure" [...] shot and wrote that [...] "by rendering the disparate images separate but simultaneous, Godard <b>has</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> for viewers to compare separate images at the moment they see them. Goodbye To Language effectively argues that every cut is porous, and that seeing is just looking, if it's distracted by memory." [...] Amy Taubin of Film Comment called the shot [...] "a mindboggling, eyeball-dislocating, narratively profound sequence" [...] and reported that after the shot concluded the audience erupted into applause at the film's premiere during the Cannes film festival. Jonathan Romney of Film Comment said that [...] "it's in-camera magic of a Méliès vintage: a piece of cheap trickery, but brilliantly and simply carried off, finding hitherto unsuspected delight in a simple 'improper' use of 3-D." ...|$|E
