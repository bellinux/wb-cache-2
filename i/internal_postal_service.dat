40|$|This {{study is}} making {{the case that the}} Universal <b>Postal</b> <b>Service</b> as {{currently}} defined at the European level should be modernized. The European Union plans to liberalize and build up an <b>internal</b> market for <b>postal</b> <b>services</b> by 2009 with the aim to foster improved services and innovations in the postal sector to benefit the customer. This paper argues that the European Union has to improve it’s Universal Service rules to take into account technological changes that increasingly shape consumer behaviour and in fact make the existing Universal Service Obligation (USO) obsolete. If the EU is to take postal innovation outside the existing USO initiated by postal operators and changing consumer behaviour into account then a new and updated USO has to be less strict and more encouraging of further innovative developments. Indeed, the fact that the postal sector innovates outside the USO shows that the market is fully capapble of catering for the needs of customers. The study takes the perspective of a fully liberalized postal sector driven by the information and communication technologies. This in turn shall be supported by an USO that supports innovation and dynamicsm in the industry so to offer the customer the best service available...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} EU postal sector {{policy of the}} second Barroso Commission from 2010 to 2014. The main goal of the Commission is to achieve a single European market for <b>postal</b> <b>services.</b> The paper distinguishes between the {{following}} three objectives, whose implementation should lead to the achievement of an <b>internal</b> <b>postal</b> market: implementation of the Third Postal Directive; fostering e-commerce and parcel delivery; and enforce its State aid framework in the postal sector. The analysis shows that almost all Member States have transposed the Directive into national law and fully liberalized their markets, but nevertheless competition in all Member States has only developed to a limited extent. While there is strong growth of the e-commerce sector, a consistent alignment of State Aid policy with USO and full market opening is still under development. The current design of the USO and its financing may not be appropriate in times of fast changing technology and consumer needs. Therefore, the paper presents new approaches, suggesting to include new technologies or even proposing to establish an intermodal USO for <b>postal</b> and telecommunication <b>services...</b>|$|R
