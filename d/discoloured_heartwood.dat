40|$|The studied Quercus robur {{trees were}} oaks {{protected}} as monuments of nature (200 - 350 years old) and oaks growing in forest stands (200 - 300 years old). The most visible symptoms occurring in aboveground organs included defoliation (25 - 75 %), dying of twigs and branches. <b>Discoloured</b> <b>heartwood,</b> obtained with an 80 -cm Pressler borer, differed in colour intensity from normal wood and {{was divided into}} two groups: stained brown and dark brown. The brown-stained heartwood was a more active site, considering the number of fungi {{and their ability to}} produce enzymes (phenoloxidase, pectinase and cellulase) in comparison with the dark-brown-stained heartwood. This brown-stained heartwood contained also statistically more Ca, Mg and Mn...|$|E
40|$|Rising {{interest}} in using wood in non-residential multi-story building structures opens up {{new opportunities for}} utilising low-grade hardwoods. The primary objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the geographic variation in modulus of elasticity (MOE) and modulus of rupture (MOR) of sugar maple and yellow birch wood in relation to stand and tree characteristics for two regions in New Brunswick, Canada. Mixed effects statistical models were developed to test the effects of stand, tree, and wood sample variables. A second objective was to examine geographic variation in heartwood discolouration in relation to stand and tree characteristics. Between-tree differences (trees nested within sites) accounted for 44 % and 35 % of the total variation in yellow birch (MOE and MOR, respectively) and for 69 % and 60 % of total variation in sugar maple. The fixed effects explained only a very small part for the variation in MOE and MOR in the sugar maple data (10 % for MOE and 5 % for MOR). For sugar maple, mechanical properties (MOE and MOR) at 50 % of the radius were considerably lower than those close to the bark, but this radial variation was not noteworthy for yellow birch. <b>Discoloured</b> <b>heartwood</b> proportion had no significant effect on wood mechanical properties.
