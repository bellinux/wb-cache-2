50|$|Some of the Irish convicts {{had been}} transported to Australia <b>for</b> <b>political</b> <b>crimes</b> or social {{rebellion}} in Ireland, so the authorities were suspicious of Roman Catholicism {{for the first}} three decades of settlement and Roman Catholic convicts were compelled to attend Church of England services.|$|R

50|$|Authorities in the People's Republic of Romania {{aimed to}} educate the laboring masses in science, {{politics}} and culture to help them fight superstition and mysticism, thereby reducing the influence of religion and resulting in a communist atheistic society, in which religion would be considered {{the ideology of the}} bourgeoisie. After the communist takeover in 1948, some church personnel were imprisoned <b>for</b> <b>political</b> <b>crimes.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{presence}} of Catholicism in Australia {{came with the}} 1788 arrival of the First Fleet of British convict ships at Sydney.

50|$|After 1956 Lukács {{narrowly}} avoided execution. Due to {{his role}} in Nagy's government, {{he was no longer}} trusted by the party apparatus.

Lukács's books The Young Hegel and The Destruction of Reason have been used to argue that Lukács was covertly critical of Stalinism as an irrational distortion of Hegelian-Marxism.|$|R

Dreyfus was not sentenced to death, {{as it had been}} abolished <b>for</b> <b>political</b> <b>crimes</b> since 1848.|$|R

50|$|Once in England, the King {{began his}} {{negotiations}} with the government. One of his four issues he asked was an amnesty on those undergoing <b>imprisonment</b> <b>for</b> <b>political</b> offences; otherwise he would abdicate. He strongly objected to the government’s treatment of the Boworadet rebels. The government disagreed with his demand. The King delayed signing the death warrants and automatically prevented the execution to take place, because {{at that time the}} Penal Code required a written royal consent before the executions could take place.|$|R
50|$|Extradition may be requested, granted or {{offered in}} {{accordance}} with treaties or a relevant statute. Extradition is not granted <b>for</b> <b>political</b> <b>crimes</b> (Article 35).

Following the adoption of article 35 by the Constituent Assembly in June 1991, Pablo Escobar voluntarily turned himself in. Extradition was reestablished by a constitutional amendment in 1997.|$|R
25|$|The exact {{location}} of Moro's imprisonment is disputed.

5000|$|In Iran, hiraba {{is known}} as [...] "moharebeh" [...] and is {{translated}} variously in English-language media as [...] "waging war against God," [...] "war against God and the state," [...] "enmity against God."

5000|$|However, {{public opinion}} had already {{condemned}} him. The press claimed that Dreyfus had exposed {{the system of}} national defense.

People were indignant that the penalty of death <b>for</b> <b>political</b> <b>crimes</b> had been abolished by the constitution of 1848; even death seemed too light a punishment. The only excuse that they found for him was that his race had predisposed him to commit an act of treason, the [...] "fatalité du type." ...|$|R
