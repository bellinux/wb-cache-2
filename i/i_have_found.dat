5|$|Over {{the years}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> {{that it is}} {{difficult}} if not impossible to bring to consciousness of another person the nature of his tacit assumptions when, by some special experiences, I have been made aware of them. This became painfully evident to me in my attempts during the 1950s to convince geneticists that the action of genes had to be and was controlled. It is now equally painful to recognize the fixity of assumptions that many persons hold on the nature of controlling elements in maize and the manners of their operation. One must await the right time for conceptual change.|$|E
25|$|Above the settlement, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> almost everywhere, on both banks, {{abandoned}} Indian settlements, {{where one}} {{has only to}} settle farmers, who will have no more to do than cut canes or reeds or bramble before they sow.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> {{the land}} good all along, the banks being flooded in some places. The {{greater part of}} the banks is covered with cypress trees, which are very fine, tall thick, straight. All the islands, too, are covered with cypresses, oaks, and other trees.|$|E
60|$|I sought my bed, but in it {{knew little}} of sleep. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>found</b> her for whom during all the long years <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been searching, though I did not {{understand}} that I was searching. After the ages <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>found</b> her and she <b>had</b> <b>found</b> me. Her eyes said it, and, unless I dreamed, her sweet voice said it also.|$|R
60|$|At this <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a happy inspiration. I {{began to}} believe that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>found</b> an ally, and I {{answered}} him at once.|$|R

25|$|In {{search of}} sanctuary, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> {{my way to}} that country, the nobility of whose traditions, and whose ever-present charm, have already been as balm to my soul. I shall be glad and {{grateful}} if I can spend some few years of peace and repose in France and Paris, and still more grateful to be enabled to repay the hospitality accorded to me, by making available those abundant stores of knowledge acquired throughout my career.|$|E
25|$|How the Other Half Lives sold {{well and}} was much quoted. Reviews were {{generally}} good, although some reviewers criticized it for oversimplifying and exaggerating. Riis attributed the success {{to a popular}} interest in social amelioration stimulated by William Booth's In Darkest England and the Way Out, and also to Ward McAllister's Society as <b>I</b> <b>Have</b> <b>Found</b> It, {{a portrait of the}} moneyed class. The book encouraged imitations such as Darkness and Daylight; or, Lights and Shadows of New York Life (1892), which somehow appropriated Riis's own photographs.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> {{that in the}} {{composition}} of the human body as compared with the bodies of animals, the organs of sense are duller and coarser... I have seen in the Lion tribe that the sense of smell is connected with part of the substance of the brain which comes down the nostrils, which form a spacious receptacle for the sense of smell, which enters by a great number of cartilaginous vesicles with several passages leading up to where the brain, as before said, comes down.|$|E

25|$|I {{have spent}} 70 {{years of study}} and travel in order to equip myself with {{information}} that would enable me to speak and write with authority on the course of world affairs. The authority I have sought is not in any sense political. It is the authority that results from collecting and classifying information on a scientific level and interpreting facts as <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> them. Since I do not speak with political authority I have no means of communicating my conclusions except by putting them in print myself and distributing them in the most advantageous way that is available to a private citizen.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Budan's theorem was of such great importance, the {{appearance}} of Sturm's theorem in 1827 gave it (and Vincent's theorem) the death blow. Sturm's theorem solved the real root isolation problem, by defining the precise number of real roots a polynomial has in a real open interval (a, b); moreover, Sturm himself, p.108, acknowledges the great influence Fourier's theorem had on him: « C'est en m'appuyant sur les principes qu'il a posés, et en imitant ses démonstrations, que j'ai trouvé les nouveaux théorèmes que je vais énoncer. » which translates to «It is by relying upon the principles he has laid out and by imitating his proofs that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> the new theorems which I am about to present.» Because of the above, the theorems by Fourier and Sturm appear in almost all the books on the theory of equations and Sturm's method for computing the real roots of polynomials {{has been the only}} one widely known and used ever since – up to about 1980, when it was replaced (in almost all computer algebra systems) by methods derived from Vincent's theorem, the fastest one being the Vincent–Akritas–Strzeboński (VAS) method.|$|E
500|$|However, on April 28, 2009, Specter {{stated that}} [...] "As the Republican Party has moved {{farther and farther}} to the right, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> myself {{increasingly}} {{at odds with the}} Republican philosophy and more in line with the philosophy of the Democratic Party." [...] He said that he was switching party affiliation and would run as a Democrat in the 2010 election.|$|E

6000|$|... "In various treatises on 'How to Succeed in Literature,'" [...] said Psmith sadly, [...] "which <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{read from}} time to time, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> always <b>found</b> it stated that what the novice chiefly needed was an editor who {{believed}} in him.

The last two nights <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> the drafting committee fagged [...] and despairing, {{and now they have}} pitched the conundrums at me and gone out for a smoke; and then I worked out algebraic formulas to clear the thing up, drafted clauses accordingly, and when the committee returned we had plain sailing.|$|E
500|$|In mid-2009 Vogg stated: [...] "It {{has been}} {{the hardest thing for}} me to move on without Vitek by my side, but he would have wanted me to {{continue}} with the band.

500|$|Times public editor Arthur Brisbane {{wrote in}} 2012: [...] "When The Times covers a {{national}} presidential campaign, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> that the lead editors and reporters are disciplined about enforcing fairness and balance, and usually succeed in doing so. Across the paper's many departments, though, so many share {{a kind of}} political and cultural progressivism — {{for lack of a}} better term — that this worldview virtually bleeds through the fabric of The Times." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 579. ~till <b>I</b> <b>had</b> found~. The {{language}} is extremely condensed here, the meaning being, 'I began my flight, {{and continued to}} run till <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>found</b> you'; the pluperfect tense is used because the speaker is looking back upon his meeting with the brothers after completing a long narration of the circumstances {{that led up to}} it. If, however, 'had found' be regarded as a subjunctive, the meaning is, 'I began my flight, and determined to continue it until <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>found</b> (i.e. should <b>have</b> <b>found)</b> you.' Comp. Abbott § 361.|$|R

"He's in {{a strange}} place and wants to be accepted—which is a {{situation}} that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> myself in many times when travelling {{from city to city}} all over the world. He's most comfortable with children, and I have a great love for kids. He gives love and wants love in return, which is me. And he has that super power which lets him lift off and fly whenever he wants to get away from things on Earth, and I can identify with that. He and I are alike in many ways" ...|$|E
500|$|Science {{fiction writer}} Jerry Pournelle named Starflight his {{game of the}} month for January 1987, stating that it was [...] "as much {{a career as a}} game" [...] and [...] "fascinating". Fellow writer Orson Scott Card wrote, [...] "Starflight is the first science fiction {{computer}} game that actually gives you something of the experience of roaming through the galaxy. ... <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> this game obsessively fascinating—and the graphics and player interface are superb". He called it the [...] "Star Wars of science fiction games. Brilliantly designed and programmed ... the standard against which all other space-exploration games must be measured". Compute! listed it in May 1988 as one of [...] "Our Favorite Games", stating that [...] "Starflight captures the feel of a certain type of science fiction ... the game can take hundreds of hours to play fully, yet those hours are anything but boring".|$|E
500|$|Sibelius {{continued}} to make changes to {{the final version of}} the tone poem as he sailed across the Atlantic Ocean aboard the steamship SS Kaiser Wilhelm II and even during rehearsals in Norfolk, but these last-minute changes, Andrew Barnett argues, must have been relatively [...] "minor", as the orchestral parts had been copied before his departure from Finland. Sibelius was delighted with the new piece, writing to Aino, [...] "It's as though <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> myself, and more besides. The Fourth Symphony was the start. But in this piece there is so much more. There are passages in it that drive me crazy. Such poetry". Neither the suite nor the Yale version of the tone poem was performed in Sibelius's lifetime, receiving their world premieres by Osmo Vänskä and the Lahti Symphony Orchestra on 19September and 24October 2002, respectively.|$|E

500|$|Jackson Benson {{believes}} Hemingway used autobiographical {{details as}} framing devices {{about life in}} general—not only about his life. For example, Benson postulates that Hemingway used his experiences and drew them out with [...] "what if" [...] scenarios: [...] "what if I were wounded {{in such a way}} that I could not sleep at night? What if I were wounded and made crazy, what would happen if I were sent back to the front?" [...] Writing in [...] "The Art of the Short Story", Hemingway explains: [...] "A few things <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> to be true. If you leave out important things or events that you know about, the story is strengthened. If you leave or skip something because you do not know it, the story will be worthless. The test of any story is how very good the stuff that you, not your editors, omit." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Maxwell's papers, {{when news}} of the {{destruction}} of the sandstone slab reached Bengal, James Prinsep asked the Governor of the Straits Settlements, Colonel William John Butterworth, to secure any legible fragments that might still exist and to send them to the Royal Asiatic Society's museum. Butterworth replied: [...] "The only remaining portion of the stone you mention, except what Colonel Low may have, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> lying in the verandah of the Treasury at Singapore, where it was used as a seat by the Sepoys of the guard and persons in waiting to transact business. I lost no time in sending it to my house, but, alas! not before the inscription was nearly erased. Such as the fragment was then however – i.e., in 1843 – it is now; for I have preserved the stone with much care, and shall have much pleasure in sending it for your museum, having failed to establish one, as I hoped to have done, in Singapore." ...|$|E
500|$|Amidst all of {{this family}} turmoil, Imlay still found time to ponder larger social issues. The utopian socialist Robert Owen came to visit Godwin {{in the summer of}} 1816 and he and Imlay {{discussed}} the plight of the working poor in Britain. She agreed with many of Owen's proposals, but not all of them. She decided, in the end, that his utopian scheme was too [...] "romantic", because it depended heavily on the goodwill of the rich to sacrifice their wealth. That same summer, George Blood—the brother of Fanny Imlay's namesake—came to meet {{her for the first time}} and told her stories of her mother. After this meeting she wrote to Mary Godwin and Shelley: [...] "I have determined never to live to be a disgrace to such a mother... <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> that if I will endeavour to overcome my faults I shall find being's [...] to love and esteem me" [...]|$|E
