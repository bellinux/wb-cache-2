5|$|Linda J. Laubenstein (May 21, 1947 – August 15, 1992) was a {{physician}} and early HIV/AIDS researcher.

5|$|In 1965, while {{a student}} at Bennington College, Dworkin was arrested during an anti-Vietnam War protest at the United States Mission to the United Nations {{and sent to the}} New York Women's House of Detention. Dworkin testified that the <b>doctors</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House of Detention gave her an {{internal}} examination which was so rough that she bled for days afterwards. She spoke in public and testified before a grand jury about her experience, and the media coverage of her testimony made national and international news. The grand jury declined to make an indictment in the case, but Dworkin's testimony contributed to public outrage over the mistreatment of inmates. The prison was closed seven years later.|$|E
5|$|The highest {{professional}} {{board for}} accountants is the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Zimbabwe (ICAZ) with direct relationships with similar bodies in South Africa, Canada, the UK and Australia. A qualified Chartered Accountant from Zimbabwe {{is also a}} member of similar bodies in these countries after writing a conversion paper. In addition, Zimbabwean-trained doctors only require one year of residence to be fully licensed <b>doctors</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States. The Zimbabwe Institution of Engineers (ZIE) is the highest professional board for engineers.|$|E

5|$|Cucurbita {{have been}} used in various {{cultures}} as folk remedies. Pumpkins {{have been used}} by Native Americans to treat intestinal worms and urinary ailments. This Native American remedy was adopted by American <b>doctors</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early nineteenth century as an anthelmintic for the expulsion of worms. In southeastern Europe, seeds of C. pepo were used to treat irritable bladder and benign prostatic hyperplasia. In Germany, pumpkin seed is approved for use by the Commission E, which assesses folk and herbal medicine, for irritated bladder conditions and micturition problems of prostatic hyperplasia stages 1 and 2, although the monograph published in 1985 noted a lack of pharmacological studies that could substantiate empirically found clinical activity. The FDA in the United States, on the other hand, banned the sale of all such non-prescription drugs for the treatment of prostate enlargement in 1990.|$|E
5|$|During {{the debate}} over the {{proposed}} Patients' Bill of Rights legislation, Fletcher opposed a Democratic proposal that would have allowed individuals to sue their health maintenance organizations (HMOs), favoring instead a more limited bill drafted by Republican leadership that expanded the patient's ability to appeal HMO decisions. Many <b>doctors</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Republican legislative caucus felt their party's bill did not go far enough; Fletcher and Tennessee Senator Bill Frist were notable exceptions. Fletcher's position cost him the support of the Kentucky Medical Association (KMA). After contributing to his campaign against Scorsone in 1998, KMA backed Scotty Baesler's bid to regain his old seat from Fletcher in 2000. However, Baesler only captured 35 percent of the vote to Fletcher's 53 percent. The remaining 12 percent went to third-party candidate Gatewood Galbraith.|$|E
5|$|Spruyt {{was the son}} of Jacobus Spuyt (1796–1839), a Dutch medical doctor, and Antje Landskroon. Both the Spruyt and Landskroon {{families}} {{stood in}} a tradition of medical practice, and three of the four brothers Spruyt had were <b>doctors</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Netherlands. Spruyt himself trained as a lawyer at Leiden University, but probably did not finish his studies. He went on to work as a schoolteacher in the village of Oosterwolde in the north of the Netherlands. It was here that professor U.G. Lauts recruited him for South Africa in 1851. Lauts was {{one of a group of}} Dutchmen, interested in the development of good education in the new Boer settlements in South Africa. As such, Spruyt was one of the many Dutch immigrants that settled in the new Boer republics around the middle of the nineteenth century.|$|E

25|$|Fentanyl {{may produce}} more {{prolonged}} respiratory depression than other opioid analgesics. In 2006 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) began investigating several respiratory deaths, but <b>doctors</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom were not {{warned of the}} risks with fentanyl until September 2008. The FDA reported in April 2012 that twelve young children had died and twelve more made seriously ill from separate accidental exposures to fentanyl skin patches.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, the {{university}} had a student population {{as small as}} one thousand, consisting largely of upper-class pupils training to become civil servants, lawyers and <b>doctors.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> coming decades it started to grow significantly, until it {{became one of the}} country's largest. In 1964 the social sciences were split from the Faculty of Humanities. Lund Institute of Technology was established in 1961 but was merged with Lund University eight years later.|$|E
25|$|Between 1929 and 1938, 250,000 Jews {{arrived in}} Palestine (Fifth Aliyah). 174,000 arrived between 1933 and 1936, {{after which the}} British {{increasingly}} restricted immigration. The influx contributed to the 1933 Palestine riots. Migration was mostly from Europe and included professionals, doctors, lawyers and professors from Germany. As a consequence German architects of the Bauhaus school made Tel-Aviv the world's only city with purely Bauhaus neighborhoods and Palestine had the highest per-capita percentage of <b>doctors</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world.|$|E

25|$|Nurses are {{not truly}} doctor's assistants. This is {{possible}} in certain situations, but nurses more often are independently caring for their patients or assisting other nurses. Registered Nurses treat patients, record their medical history, provide emotional support, and provide follow-up care. Nurses also help doctors perform diagnostic tests. Nurses are almost always working {{on their own or}} with other nurses. Nurses will assist <b>doctors</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> emergency room or in trauma care when help is needed.|$|E
25|$|Computer-aided {{detection}} (CADe), {{also called}} computer-aided diagnosis (CADx), are systems that assist <b>doctors</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> interpretation of medical images. Imaging techniques in X-ray, MRI, and ultrasound diagnostics yield {{a great deal}} of information that the radiologist or other medical professional has to analyze and evaluate comprehensively in a short time. CAD systems process digital images for typical appearances and to highlight conspicuous sections, such as possible diseases, in order to offer input to support a decision taken by the professional.|$|E

Many important figures {{in the field of}} theology were educated at the university, particularly in its earlier history, giving rise to the Aberdeen <b>doctors</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 17th century and prolific enlightenment philosopher Thomas Reid in the 18th. Five Nobel laureates have since been associated with Aberdeen.|$|E
