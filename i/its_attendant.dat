Since the late 1980s light gun controllers have been generally manufactured to look like toys by painting them in bright colours. In Japan, which lacks the gun crime found in the United States and in which civilians cannot legally own guns, more realistic light guns are widely available.|$|E
5|$|The Pandharpur image, {{when not}} clothed by <b>its</b> <b>attendant</b> priest to receive devotees, {{provides}} Vithoba with the detailed features distinctive {{of a male}} body, visible in full relief. However, close inspection of the stonework reveals {{the outline of a}} loincloth, supported by a kambarband (waist belt), traced by thin, light carvings. Other images and pictures depict Vithoba clothed, usually with pitambara – a yellow dhoti and various gold ornaments—the manner in which he is attired by the priests in the daily rites.|$|E

5|$|Work by {{engineer}} Mieczysław G. Bekker {{implies that}} the distribution of irregularities in natural terrains is log-normal; that is, small obstacles are far more common than larger ones. Thus, obstacle navigation presents a challenge to wheeled locomotion in natural terrains at all size scales. The primary means of obstacle navigation are to go around obstacles and to go over them; each has <b>its</b> <b>attendant</b> challenges.|$|E
5|$|Although {{science fiction}} had been {{published}} in the United States before the 1920s, it did not begin to coalesce into a separately marketed genre until the appearance in 1926 of Amazing Stories, a pulp magazine published by Hugo Gernsback. By the end of the 1930s, the field was undergoing its first boom, but World War II and <b>its</b> <b>attendant</b> paper shortages led to the demise of several titles. By the late 1940s, the market began to recover. From a low of eight active magazines in 1946, the field expanded to 20 in 1950, and a further 22 had commenced publication by 1954.

5|$|Mike Brown {{counters}} {{these claims}} by saying that, far from not having cleared their orbits, the major planets completely control {{the orbits of}} the other bodies within their orbital zone. Jupiter may coexist {{with a large number}} of small bodies in its orbit (the Trojan asteroids), but these bodies only exist in Jupiter's orbit because they are in the sway of the planet's huge gravity. Similarly, Pluto may cross the orbit of Neptune, but Neptune long ago locked Pluto and <b>its</b> <b>attendant</b> Kuiper belt objects, called plutinos, into a 3:2 resonance, i.e., they orbit the Sun twice for every three Neptune orbits. The orbits of these objects are entirely dictated by Neptune's gravity, and thus, Neptune is gravitationally dominant.|$|E
5|$|The postwar {{drive-in}} theater boom {{was vital}} to the expanding independent B movie industry. In January 1945, there were 96 drive-ins in the United States; a decade later, {{there were more than}} 3,700. Unpretentious pictures with simple, familiar plots and reliable shock effects were ideally suited for auto-based film viewing, with all <b>its</b> <b>attendant</b> distractions. The phenomenon of the drive-in movie became one of the defining symbols of American popular culture in the 1950s. At the same time, many local television stations began showing B genre films in late-night slots, popularizing the notion of the midnight movie.|$|E
5|$|The first {{science fiction}} magazine, Amazing Stories, {{appeared}} in 1926. By {{the end of}} the 1930s, the genre was flourishing in the United States, but World War II and <b>its</b> <b>attendant</b> paper shortages led to the demise of several magazines. In the late 1940s, the market began to recover. From a low of eight active US magazines in 1946, the field expanded to 20 just four years later. Galaxys appearance in 1950 was part of this boom. According to sf historian and critic Mike Ashley, its success was the main reason for a subsequent flood of new releases: 22 more science fiction magazines appeared by 1954, when the market dipped again as a side effect of US Senate hearings into the putative connection between comic books and juvenile delinquency.|$|E

5000|$|The {{presentation}} of the Endowment was particularly challenging in this temple, {{because it was the}} first international one, requiring many different languages for <b>its</b> <b>attendants.</b> It was solved by using a film, dubbed in all required languages. Gordon B. Hinckley supervised the initial making of this film and was the person responsible for transporting the film to Switzerland. [...] Since then all new temples have been equipped with recordings in lieu of live presentations by temple workers. Today, only the Manti Utah Temple and the Salt Lake Temple use live presentation instead of film.|$|R

5|$|Tombstone, {{near the}} Mexican border, {{was founded in}} March 1879. After silver was {{discovered}} in the area, Tombstone grew rapidly into a frontier mining boomtown. At its founding, it had a population of just 100, and only two years later, in late 1881, the population was more than 7,000 (excluding Chinese, Mexicans, women, and children), making it the largest boomtown in the Southwest. Silver mining and <b>its</b> <b>attendant</b> wealth attracted many professionals and merchants, who brought their wives and families. With them came churches and ministers. They brought a Victorian sensibility and became the town's elite. By 1881 there were fancy restaurants, a bowling alley, four churches, an ice house, a school, an opera house, two banks, three newspapers, and an ice cream parlor, along with 110 saloons, 14 gambling halls, and numerous brothels, all situated {{among a number of}} dirty, hardscrabble mines.|$|E

At the bottom of the hill, MD 410 intersects Jones Mill Road and Beach Drive, the main road through Rock Creek Park. The state highway crosses Rock Creek, passes to the north of Meadowbrook Park and leaves the valley as a four-lane road with narrow median and flanking service roads. MD 410 reaches {{the top of the hill}} at Grubb Road and descends into the valley of a branch of Rock Creek. The highway becomes undivided at Sundale Drive and crosses the stream just west of the northern corner of the District of Columbia and <b>its</b> <b>attendant</b> boundary marker, then leaves the stream valley and ascends to an intersection with MD 390 (16th Street) at the western edge of downtown Silver Spring.|$|E

50|$|The {{influence}} of the Alfred Wolfsohn Voice Research Centre remains evident across discreet disciplines {{as a result of}} the diverse ways in which <b>its</b> <b>attendants</b> have inherited and adapted the work initiated by its German founder in 1935. This evidence includes the clinical application of song as a therapeutic intervention with elderly populations by Sarah Povey; the vocal psychotherapy developed by Diane Austin; the training workshops in extended vocal technique taught by Noah Pikes; the appropriation of musical vocal expression as a medium of therapeutic communication in the expressive therapies; and the use of a variety of extended vocal techniques by many vocalists including Meredith Monk and Diamanda Galas.|$|R
