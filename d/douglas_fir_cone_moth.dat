40|$|Climate change {{provides}} {{new challenges}} to Nordic forestry. Use of non-native species, such as <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir,</b> {{can be a}} means of mitigating the {{effects of climate change}} and meeting the growing demand for biomass. When <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir</b> is grown in Sweden, it is several degrees of latitude north of its normal range, which can affect timing of growth cessation, hardening of seedlings, and seedling storability. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate tolerance to freezing and sub-zero storability of seven <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir</b> provenances and make comparisons with the native Norway spruce. Freezing tolerance and storability were evaluated by measuring the electrolytic leakage of shoots and roots after freezing, complemented with a three-week cultivation test after storage. All provenances of <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir</b> used in this study were able to tolerate frozen storage at − 4 °C for about four months. Norway spruce and the interior <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir</b> provenance, Three Valley, could be stored earlier in the autumn than the southern coastal <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir</b> provenances. Consequently, it should be possible to store <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir</b> seedlings with the same routines as for Norway spruce...|$|R

40|$|The {{need for}} species that will grow well through ongoing climate change has {{increased}} the interest in <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir</b> [Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco] in Sweden. One {{of the most common}} problems seen in plantations of <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir</b> seedlings is damage caused by late spring frost, known to be highly correlated with the timing of bud burst. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate spring-related bud development under Nordic conditions of seven <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir</b> provenances and to compare data with a local provenance of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst). Results from a field trial and a greenhouse-based study were compared. The interior <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir</b> provenances exhibited an earlier bud burst than coastal provenances, both in the greenhouse and in the field trial. When comparing differences within the groups of interior and coastal <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir</b> provenances, no differences could be found. The local Norway spruce, only grown in the greenhouse, showed an intermediate bud development profile similar to the interior <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir</b> provenance Three Valley. We therefore suggest that Three Valley could be planted at the same locations as the investigated local provenance of Norway spruce in mid-Sweden. To avoid spring frost damage the <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir</b> seedlings need to be frozen stored and planted late in spring. Planting under shelterwood can also help protect the seedlings from spring frost damages. As similar results for bud development patterns of <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir</b> and Norway spruce provenances were obtained from the greenhouse and field trials, greenhouse tests could facilitate selection of provenances...|$|R
50|$|Pseudotsuga menziesii, {{commonly}} known as <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir</b> or Douglas-fir, is an evergreen conifer species native to western North America. One variety, the coast <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir,</b> grows along the Pacific Ocean from central British Columbia south to central California.

(Japanese larch), and Larix decidua Miller (European larch), and of mixtures of <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir</b> with Japanese larch, and <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir</b> with European larch was studied for growth trends over a 13 -year period from age 19 to 32 years. Two thinning treatments (unthinned control and thinned to 500 stems/ha at age 19 years) were tested in permanent sample plots established in the pure and the mixed blocks. When <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir</b> was planted in mixture with Japanese larch on this site it became dominated and supressed by the larch species. However, when planted in mixture with European larch almost the reverse occurred, although the mixture could not be considered to be successfully self-thinning at age 32 years. When thinned at age 19 years, <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir</b> was more responsive in subsequent basal area growth than the two larch species. Thus, although early growth of Japanese larch was superior on this site, <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir</b> {{is likely to be the}} most productive of the three species at final rotation. Results from this study support the case that manual thinning to achieve a desired regime should remain the preferred management technique for <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir</b> in New Zealand...|$|R

40|$|Alien {{plants are}} {{subjected}} to different biotic and environmental barriers that limit their establishment success in the introduced range. Pseud- otsuga menziesii (<b>Douglas</b> <b>fir),</b> a native conifer from Northwest America, {{is considered one of}} the most invasive forestry conifers in Europe. However, little is known about the ecological filters that constrain plant establishment at early life-cycle stages and differences in habitat invasibility to this species. We conducted field experiments to compare the establishment potential (i. e. post-dispersal seed removal, seed ger- mination, seedling survival and growth) of <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir</b> in beech forests, holm-oak forests and heathlands; and compared it with the taxonomically close native conifer Abies alba (Silver <b>fir).</b> <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir</b> seeds were more removed than Silver fir in holm-oak and in heathlands. In all habitats, seed germination was significantly higher for <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir</b> compared to that of Silver fir and, seedling mortality was extremely high in both species due to soil disturbance by wild boars and drought stress. <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir</b> mortality was only lower than Silver fir in beech forests. However, species did not differ in seedling growth. Overall, the probability of invasion success of <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir</b> decreased along the sequential stages of plant estab- lishment in all habitats. Only high seed germination rates of <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir</b> would predict its high invasive capacity but these advantages are counterbalanced by high seedling mortality. Results showed a mismatch between invasibility and current pattern of <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir</b> invasion in the study area. Therefore, future research focused on seed production and on different compo- nents of biotic resistance is recommended to eluci- date which processes are favoring its establishment success.
