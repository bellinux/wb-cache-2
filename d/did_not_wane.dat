Cattle ranching and foodstuff production proliferated after the population growth, both of which relied heavily on slave labor. 1.7 million slaves were imported to Brazil from Africa from 1700 to 1800, and the rise of coffee in the 1830s further enticed expansion of the slave trade.|$|E
25|$|Local {{interest}} in the church <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>wane.</b> The following year an architect appraised the building and found its older elements had seriously deteriorated. A local Eagle Scout did an inventory of the graves and markers for his project. The Somers Historical Society replaced the roof again; another Eagle Scout redid the interior walls as his project. These efforts culminated in 1984 with research into the church's history and ownership. As a result, the United Methodist Church formally transferred the church to the town two years later; its remaining records {{and some of its}} other artifacts were removed to the custody of the historical society, which has had responsibility for the site ever since.|$|E

He had also been considering an independent bid, but said raising money would be too difficult under campaign finance laws. Upon his withdrawal, Mathias stated he would work with the Republican Party in the upcoming elections. However, despite his pledge to support the Republican candidate, Mathias' criticism of the party <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>wane,</b> stating that [...] "over and over again during the primaries, I have felt uncomfortably like a member of the chorus in a Greek tragedy".

Gold brought a [...] "sophisticated intellectual subtlety" [...] to magazine science fiction according to Pohl, who added that [...] "after Galaxy it was impossible to go on being naive." [...] SF historian David Kyle agrees, commenting that [...] "of all the editors in and out of the post-war scene, the most influential beyond any doubt was H. L. Gold". [...] Kyle suggests that the new direction Gold set [...] "inevitably" [...] led to the experimental New Wave, the defining science fiction literary movement of the 1960s.|$|E
500|$|In 1729, Linnaeus wrote a thesis, [...] on plant sexual reproduction. This {{attracted}} the attention of Rudbeck; in May 1730, he selected Linnaeus to give lectures at the University although the young man was only a second-year student. His lectures were popular, and Linnaeus often addressed an audience of 300 people. In June, Linnaeus moved from Celsius' house to Rudbeck's to become the tutor of the three youngest of his 24 children. His friendship with Celsius <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>wane</b> and they continued their botanical expeditions. Over that winter, Linnaeus began to doubt Tournefort's system of classification and decided to create one of his own. His plan was to divide the plants by the number of stamens and pistils.

Park’s poetry, especially his later work, reveals a fervent love for life that <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>wane</b> despite his diligent acknowledgment of the ever-present threat of the end. He is celebrated for the cautious optimism of his work and his ability to subtly internalize conflicts of empiric reality in his deceptively localized and dialectal poetry.|$|R

Suppose a man repeatedly dosed with such a preparation: he would live an active and record life indeed, but he would be an adult at eleven, middle-aged at twenty-five, and by thirty well on the road to senile decay. It seemed to me that so far Gibberne was only going to do for any one who took his drug exactly what Nature has done for the Jews and Orientals, who are men in their teens and aged by fifty, and quicker in thought and act than we are all the time. The marvel of drugs has always been great to my mind; you can madden a man, calm a man, make him incredibly strong and alert or a helpless log, quicken this passion and allay that, all by means of drugs, and here was a new miracle to be added to this strange armoury of phials the doctors use! But Gibberne was far too eager upon his technical points to enter very keenly into my aspect of the question.|$|E

With our balanced panel of 17 countries over the 1991 - 2006 period, we implement fixed effects models, controlling for the endogenous decision to enacted full or partial privatization of the public pension system and several other covariates whose choice is informed by the rich empirical literature on FDI. Our econometric results indicate that privatization triggers a significant increase in net FDI inflows within a year of reform implementation and that the effect <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>wane</b> over time.

5000|$|Salzedo was {{involved}} in many arenas, including the burgeoning [...] "new music" [...] circles in New York, where he co-founded the International Composers Guild with Edgard Varèse. The Guild was {{the first group of}} its kind, and presented the most prominent European composers and others in concert, figures such as Ravel and Casella. This later {{led to the formation of}} the rival League of Composers, which was organized to support [...] "American" [...] composers, causing a rift in musical circles not healed for many years. Salzedo was in the forefront of artistic ideas, and social circles. Salzedo became familiar with the dancer/choreographer Martha Graham, who was the roommate of one of his pupils, and perceiving her genius, he used his influence to help her to receive a Rockefeller Foundation grant which was instrumental in the development of her career. He toured with Adolf Bolm, the well-known Diaghilev dancer and choreographer, as a conductor and performer, as well as composer. Bolm's Ballet Intime performed a ballet to Salzedo's composition, Bolmimerie, written for a six-harp ensemble. Salzedo's compositions of this period, which were performed by major orchestras (The Enchanted Isle), reflect a searching, creative mind with originality and a timeless freshness of sonority. His pieces have a great appeal that <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>wane,</b> and show off the harp as an imaginative, eloquent instrument of great drama and poetic, lyric expressiveness, as well as abstract qualities and dazzling virtuoso display.|$|R

50|$|The Blue Nile has {{a similar}} pattern. It {{contributes}} 17% of the Nile's waters in the low-water season and 68% during the high-water season. In contrast, the White Nile provides only 10% of the Nile's waters during the high-water season but contributes more than 80% during the low-water period. Thus, before the Aswan High Dam was completed in 1971, the White Nile watered the Egyptian stretch of the river throughout the year, whereas the Blue Nile, carrying seasonal rain from Ethiopia, caused the Nile to overflow its banks and deposit a layer of fertile mud over adjacent fields. The great flood of the main Nile usually occurred in Egypt during August, September, and October, but it sometimes began as early as June at Aswan and often <b>did</b> <b>not</b> completely <b>wane</b> until January.|$|R

40|$|Naturally {{acquired}} immunity to Plasmodium falciparum presents a changing landscape as malaria control programs and vaccine initiatives are implemented. Determining which immunologic indicators remain surrogates of past infection, {{as opposed to}} mediators of protection, led us to compare stability of immune responses across regions with divergent malaria transmission intensities. A repeat cross-sectional study of Kenyan children from a malaria-holoendemic area and an epidemic-prone area {{was used to examine}} longitudinal antibody and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) responses to the 3 D 7 and FVO variants of merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP 1). Antibodies to MSP 1 were common in both study populations and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> significantly <b>wane</b> over a 21 -month time period. IFN-gamma responses were less frequent and rapidly disappeared in children after a prolonged period of no malaria transmission. Antibody and IFN-gamma responses rarely correlated with each other; however, MSP 1 -specific IFN-gamma response correlated with lack of concurrent P. falciparum parasitemia of the same genotype, though only statistically significantly in the malaria-holoendemic region (odds ratio = 0. 31, 95 % confidence interval = 0. 12 - 0. 84). This study affirms that antimalarial antibodies are informative for evaluation of history of malaria exposure within individuals, whereas cell-mediated immunity, though short lived under natural exposure conditions, might provide an assessment of recent infection and protection from parasitemia...|$|R

50|$|Women’s {{oversized}} fashion at {{the turn}} of the century is largely displayed in various accessories. At the beginning of the 2000s, many designers began using sizable and bulky glasses and jewelry in their lines, and women in the spheres of fashion, music, and film began wearing these oversized decorations. Celebrities such as Nicole Richie and Rachel Zoe helped to further this wearing of oversized accessories, and assisted in making the items popular in everyday wear. As the decade progressed, the utility of oversized accessories <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>wane,</b> but rather became even more widely used.|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{availability}} of safe and effective measles vaccines since 1963, measles still accounts for approx-imately 10 percent of global mortality from all causes among children aged < 5 years—an estimated 36. 5 mil-lion cases and 1 million deaths in 1996 (1). Worldwide in 1996, routine coverage with one dose of measles vaccine was 81 percent; the African Region of the World Health Organization continues to report the lowest coverage (56 percent) and the largest propor-tion of measles cases and deaths (2). For these reasons, the work of Dr. Badara Cisse and colleagues is partic-ularly relevant. We agree {{that there is an}} urgent need to strengthen measles control and to conduct research on the most effective ways to achieve this, especially in areas such as West Africa. However, we <b>do</b> <b>not</b> agree that the data presented in the paper by Cisse et al. (3) demonstrate that the 1995 outbreak in Niakhar, Senegal, was due primarily to waning of vaccine-induced immunity among school-age children. Therefore, we <b>do</b> <b>not</b> think <b>waning</b> immunity can be used as the justification for introducing a multidose vaccination schedule (e. g., administering a second dose of measles vaccine prior to school enrollment) as a priority strategy for improving measles control in developing countries. Our opinion is based mainly on three arguments. Firstly, the data presented in the paper suggest that low vaccination coverage with the first dose of measles vac-cine (64 percent among children aged 1 - 14 years) was the major reason for the outbreak. This coverage esti-mate was for 1995, and the outbreak occurred betwee...|$|R
