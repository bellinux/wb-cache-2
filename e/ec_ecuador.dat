40|$|Since the WTO's {{inception}} in 1995, {{the number of}} cases it has dealt with has exceeded the number of disputes under the GATT. This suggests that Members have found the WTO dispute settlement system a useful means to pursue their interests. In this paper, we analyze an ongoing WTO dispute to illustrate the economic and political costs and benefits that accrue to parties when they engage themselves into the formal dispute process. We draw on the Philippine-Australian case, which challenges the latter's quarantine policy on fresh fruit and vegetables, to understand further how the WTO dispute settlement system affects state behavior and litigation patterns. This particular case is also of keen interest to a number of countries, including the <b>EC,</b> US, Canada, <b>Ecuador,</b> Thailand, China, India and Chile.

40|$|Despite {{the efforts}} of breeders and the {{extensive}} use of fungicide control measures, late blight still remains {{a major threat to}} potato cultivation worldwide. The introduction of genetic resistance into cultivated potato is considered a valuable method to achieve durable resistance to late blight. Here, we report the identification and cloning of Rpi-vnt 1. 1, a previously uncharacterized late-blight resistance gene from Solanum venturii. The gene was identified by a classical genetic and physical mapping approach and encodes a coiled-coil nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat protein with high similarity to Tm- 22 from S. lycopersicum which confers resistance against Tomato mosaic virus. Transgenic potato and tomato plants carrying Rpi-vnt 1. 1 were shown to be resistant to Phytophthora infestans. Of 11 P. infestans isolates tested, only isolate <b>EC</b> 1 from <b>Ecuador</b> was able to overcome Rpi-vnt 1. 1 and cause disease on the inoculated plants. Alleles of Rpi-vnt 1. 1 (Rpi-vnt 1. 2 and Rpivnt 1. 3) that differed by only a few nucleotides were found in other late-blight-resistant accessions of S. venturii. The late blight resistance gene Rpi-phu 1 from S. phureja is shown here to be identical to Rpi-vnt 1. 1, suggesting either that this strong resistance gene has been maintained since a common ancestor, due to selection pressure for blight resistance, or that genetic exchange between S. venturii and S. phureja has occurred at some time...|$|R
