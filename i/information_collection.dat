2500|$|On average, Communications service {{providers}} utilize {{an average of}} just 35 to 40 percent of available network capacity. Recently, telecommunications software vendors such as Telcordia and Ericsson have promoted yield management as a strategy for communications {{service providers}} to generate additional revenue and reduce capital expenditures by maximizing subscriber use of available network bandwidth. Approaches include basing a strategy on innovative services explicitly designed to use only spare capacity and borrowing proven methods from the airline industry. The approach can {{be more difficult to}} implement in the telecommunications industry than the airlines sector because of the difficulty to control and sometimes refuse network access to customers. Similarities that exist between the airline and telecom industries include a large sunk cost combined with low marginal cost, perishable inventory, reservations, pricing flexibility and the opportunity to upsell. Differences that present challenges for communications service providers include low-value transactions and overall network complexity. Suggested approaches to executing a successful yield management strategy include accurate network <b>information</b> <b>collection,</b> bandwidth capacity allocation that doesn’t impact service quality, the deployment of service management software such as real time policy and real-time charging, and using new marketing channels to target consumers [...] with innovative services.|$|E

40|$|Recognizing that {{information}} from different sources {{refers to the}} same (real world) entity is a crucial challenge in instance level information integration, {{as it is a}} pre-requisite for combining the information about one entity from different sources. The required entity matching is time consuming and thus imposes a crucial limit for largescale, dynamic information integration. An increased re-use of entity identifiers (or names) across different <b>information</b> <b>collections</b> such as RDF repositories, databases and document collections, eases this situation. In the ideal case, entity matching can be reduced to the trivial problem of spotting the same entity identifier in different <b>information</b> <b>collections.</b> In this paper we propose the use of a Entity Name System (ENS) – as it is currently under development in the EUfunded project OKKAM – for systematically supporting the re-use of entity identifiers. The main purpose of the ENS is to provide unique and uniform names for entities for the use in <b>information</b> <b>collections,</b> so that the same name is used for an entity, even when it is referenced in different contexts. Of course the creation of an ENS that can efficiently deal with entities on the Web scale raises scalability issues of its own. However, this paper focuses on the role of an ENS in contributing to the scalability of ad-hoc and on demand information integration tasks. ...|$|R

The World Wide Web has introduced to such collections ideas such as filing Web pages or noting their existence in 'Bookmarks' and 'Favourites'. Argument. It is suggested that personal <b>information</b> <b>collections</b> are created in anticipation of some future need for that information- personal, anticipated information need, which also underlies the design of formal information systems. Elaboration. Examination of the literature of information needs and information seeking behaviour leads to the formulation of five propositions that elaborate the concept of personal, anticipated information need. These propositions draw upon concepts such as uncertainty, predictability, sensitivity and the valuation of information sources. Conclusion. An individual's understanding of personal, anticipated information need and how this understanding guides the acquisition and management of personal information will determine the effectiveness of that collection...|$|R
