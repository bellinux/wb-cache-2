5|$|In 1989, {{shortly after}} the fall of the Berlin Wall, Zacharias was invited to speak in Moscow. While there <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> {{students}} at the Lenin Military Academy as well as political leaders at the Center for Geopolitical Strategy. This was the first of many evangelism opportunities towards the political world. Future events included an invitation to Bogota, Colombia in 1993, where <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> the judiciary committee on the importance of having a solid moral foundation.|$|E
5|$|Affleck was {{involved}} in the 2004 presidential campaign of John Kerry. During the Democratic National Convention in Boston, <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> many delegations, appeared on political discussion shows, and attended fundraising events. Affleck took part in a voter registration public service announcement, and traveled with Kerry during the opening weekend of his Believe in America Tour, making speeches at rallies in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Ohio.|$|E
5|$|As he grew older, Sadler {{generally}} {{remained in}} good health, {{with the exception}} of a condition that led to the removal of an eye. He died on April 26, 1969, at 93 years of age. Christensen recalls that Sadler was visited by friends and family while on his deathbed; <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> them of his confidence in a joyful life after death. He received a full-column obituary in the Chicago Tribune, which discussed his success as a doctor but not his association with The Urantia Book.|$|E
60|$|And as <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>he</b> pointed <b>to</b> the babe; for {{its face}} shone like the morning star.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{sat there}} smoking, and I sat there thinking. Twice <b>'e</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> me, and I held my 'and {{up and said}} 'H'sh.' Then I turned to 'im {{all of a sudden}} and pinched his arm so hard he nearly dropped 'is beer.|$|R
60|$|As <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> gently <b>to</b> Nell a noble dignity shone {{upon his}} dark face.|$|R
5|$|Southard {{traveled}} to New York City on February 1, 1920 to lecture to medical societies. <b>He</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> the Society of Neurology of New York on February 3, and delivered a mental-hygiene lecture at the New York Academy of Medicine {{the following day}} before developing pneumonia on February 5. Despite care by three Presbyterian Hospital physicians at the Prince George Hotel, Southard died on February 8, {{at the age of}} 43.|$|E
5|$|The Dominion of India {{became an}} {{independent}} country as official ceremonies {{took place in}} New Delhi. Nehru assumed office as the first prime minister, and the viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, continued as its first governor general. Gandhi's name was invoked by crowds celebrating the occasion; Gandhi himself however took no part in the official events. Instead, he marked {{the day with a}} 24-hour fast, during which <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> a crowd in Calcutta, encouraging peace between Hindu and Muslim.|$|E
5|$|When Dave Rosten, another Sydney evangelist, {{attempted}} to imitate Jenner's method of evangelism, he was {{punched in the}} midriff by the first person <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to,</b> so he decided that Jenner's approach to evangelism was not for others to emulate. In 1947, Jenner asked his question to a man named Angus Carruthers, who responded {{that he was a}} Christian and going to heaven. Jenner invited Carruthers back to his home, where Carruthers met Jenner's daughter, Ann. Carruthers and Ann married three years later.|$|E
60|$|As <b>he</b> <b>spoke,</b> <b>he</b> pointed <b>to</b> a young mobile who {{was brought}} in, his chest {{literally}} torn {{open with a}} shell.|$|R
60|$|As <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>he</b> went <b>to</b> {{the little}} {{companion}} hatch, or {{door to the}} fore-cabin, and tried to open it, but could not.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>spoke</b> softly <b>to</b> White Fang {{until he}} had quieted him, then his voice became firm.|$|R
5|$|Almost {{immediately}} after his arrival, Hess began exhibiting amnesia, {{which may have}} been feigned in the hope of avoiding the death sentence. Medical personnel who examined Hess reported he was not insane and was fit to stand trial. At least two examiners, the British doctor and the Soviet one, noted their belief that Hess's amnesia might be fake. Efforts were made to trigger his memory, including bringing in his former secretaries and showing old newsreels, but he persisted in showing no response to these stimuli. When Hess was allowed to make a statement to the tribunal on 30 November, he admitted that he had faked memory loss as a tactic. <b>He</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> the tribunal again on 31 August 1946, the last day of closing statements.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with ten}} other former senior officers, Manstein was called on in 1955 by the Amt Blank to {{formulate}} {{plans for the}} re-founding of the German army. On 20 June 1953, <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> the Bundestag, giving his analysis of strategic power considerations and the country's defence and spoke about whether the country should have a professional army or a conscripted army. His opinion was that the length of service for Bundeswehr conscripts {{should be at least}} 18 months, preferably 24 months. His idea to form a reserve force was later implemented.|$|E
5|$|By early 1960, James Kinne was contemplating divorce, {{partially}} {{because of his}} wife's spendthrift habits and {{partially because}} he strongly suspected she was being unfaithful to him. <b>He</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> his parents {{about the possibility of}} divorce on March 18, 1960, telling them that Sharon had agreed to give him a divorce if he allowed her to keep the house and the couple's daughter and paid her $1,000, but the elder Kinnes, devout Mormons, urged James to stay in his marriage. Sharon, too, was thinking about ways out of the marriage; according to John Boldizs, she once offered him $1,000 to kill her husband or find someone who would, although he later claimed that she may have been joking.|$|E
60|$|But she had {{disappeared}} through a side door, and <b>he</b> never <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> her again.|$|R
60|$|As <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>he</b> stepp'd <b>to</b> {{the open}} casement, put his brawny hands under the boy's arms, and lifted {{him into the}} room bodily.|$|R
60|$|While <b>he</b> <b>spoke,</b> <b>he</b> {{attempted}} <b>to</b> {{throw his}} arms again around her; but she eluded his grasp, and proceeded {{in the same}} tone of firm decision.|$|R
5|$|During {{his second}} term in office, Tainan City became the first Taiwanese city to enter the Alliance for Healthy Cities of the World Health Organization. In addition, Tainan also became the first Taiwanese city to enter the Global Cities Dialogue. Hsu also {{believes}} that Tainan should become a city of international tourism and culture, and he is working towards that purpose. In September 2007, <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> the 2007 Asia-Pacific Cities Summit participants and stated that Tainan is blessed with natural, historic, cultural and humanistic characteristics, and that Tainan also possesses great conditions for high-tech, trade and investment development.|$|E
5|$|<b>He</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> Harold Howitt {{when he was}} {{thinking}} of leaving the BTC and was informed that Miles Thomas needed an experienced accountant to institute strict financial controls at BOAC. Smallpeice would turn down the role initially, fearing BOAC (also state owned) would be similar to the BTC in terms of culture and manageability. Howitt pressed Smallpeice to reconsider and following a meeting a few days with Miles Thomas and he accepted the position at BOAC, which was tailored to the role he and Miles Thomas desired he have within the company.|$|E
5|$|In January 1905, Yamashita {{got a job}} {{teaching}} judo at the U.S. Naval Academy. There {{were about}} 25 students in his class, including a future admiral, Robert L. Ghormley. The position ended {{at the end of}} the school term, and Yamashita was not rehired for the following year. When President Roosevelt heard of this, <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> the Secretary of the Navy, who in turn told the Superintendent of the Naval Academy to rehire Yamashita. Consequently, Yamashita's judo was taught at the Naval Academy throughout the first six months of 1906.|$|E
60|$|He {{controlled}} {{himself by}} an effort--he {{was quiet and}} polite again when <b>he</b> next <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> me.|$|R
60|$|Henery Walker went off, and as 'e {{passed the}} cottage where old Clark used to live, and which George Barstow 'ad moved into, <b>'e</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> {{the old man}} over the palings and told 'im wot Joe Clark 'ad said. George Barstow only grunted and went on stooping and prying over 'is front garden.|$|R
6000|$|... "Captain," [...] he said, and as <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>he</b> pointed <b>to</b> the {{pursuing}} ships, [...] "Colonel Bishop holds us. We're in no case {{either to}} run or fight." ...|$|R
5|$|List began lecturing {{on these}} subjects; for instance, in February 1893 <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> the {{nationalist}} Verein 'Deutsches Geschichte' ("'German History' Association) {{on the ancient}} priesthood of Wotan. He also worked as a playwright, and in December 1894 his play Der Wala Erweckung ("The Wala's Awakening") was premiered at an event organised by the Bund der Germanen (Germanic League) which was devoted to the German nationalist cause, with Jews being explicitly banned from attending the event. Alongside his affiliation with the Bund, List was {{also a member of}} the Deutscher Turnverein (Germanic Gymnastic League), a strongly nationalistic group to whom he contributed literary works for their events.|$|E
5|$|On 10 January 2017, Dutch club SC Heerenveen {{confirmed}} that Ødegaard had joined them on loan for 18 months. He made his Eredivisie debut {{four days later}} in a 2–0 home win over ADO Den Haag, replacing Arber Zeneli in the last seconds. After the game, <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> Fox Sports {{about how he was}} pleased with his new surroundings. He scored his first goal for the Frisians on 18 May in his 15th appearance, a 3–1 home loss to FC Utrecht in the first leg of a play-off semi-final (5–2 aggregate).|$|E
5|$|St. Laurent {{tried to}} project an {{image as a}} family man, and to that end often {{addressed}} schoolchildren. As he had in previous elections, <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> small groups of children regarding Canadian history or civics. The strategy backfired while addressing children in Port Hope, Ontario. With the children inattentive, some playing tag or sticking cameras in his face, St. Laurent angrily told them that it was their loss {{if they did not}} pay attention, as the country would be theirs to worry about far longer than it would be his.|$|E
6000|$|... “Here he comes, Lazy,” {{answered}} Dave, and as <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>he</b> pointed <b>to</b> a path {{across the}} snow-covered campus, along which another boy was hurrying, skates in hand.|$|R
60|$|As <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>he</b> went <b>to</b> a phonograph, which screwed fast {{to a small}} table, {{and wound}} up the spring of the {{instrument}} and adjusted the big gold horn.|$|R
5000|$|In February 2009, <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> out <b>to</b> {{journalist}} Paul Kimmage investigating doping in rugby, {{stating that}} {{he was aware of}} it: ...|$|R
5|$|Blaine {{accepted}} his narrow defeat and {{spent most of}} the next year working on the second volume of Twenty Years of Congress. The book continued to earn him enough money to support his lavish household and pay off his debts. Although <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> friends of retiring from politics, Blaine still attended dinners and commented on the Cleveland administration’s policies. By the time of the 1886 Congressional elections, Blaine was giving speeches and promoting Republican candidates, especially {{in his home state of}} Maine. Republicans were successful in Maine, and after the Maine elections in September, Blaine went on a speaking tour from Pennsylvania to Tennessee, hoping to boost the prospects of Republican candidates there. Republicans were less successful nationwide, gaining seats in the House while losing seats in the Senate, but Blaine’s speeches kept him and his opinions in the spotlight.|$|E
5|$|Later that evening, Jiminy and {{his parents}} {{convince}} a couple {{to give up some}} goods in exchange for a tonic that will supposedly make them immune to a plague. He soon discovers that his father switched Rumpelstiltskin's tonic with the one they sold, and finds that the couple have been turned into dolls. Even worse, he then discovers that the couple were the parents of the young boy <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> earlier. Having realized what he has done, Jiminy makes a wish and receives an answer from The Blue Fairy, who shows up to give him his one true wish: becoming a cricket. Jiminy is also told that {{he has a chance to}} help someone in the future, starting with the young boy, who would grow up to be Gepetto. As for the cursed dolls, they end up as a collection at Mr. Gold's (Carlyle) pawn shop.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{principal}} RPF targets in Ruhengeri was the prison, which was Rwanda's largest. When he learned of the invasion the warden, Charles Uwihoreye, telephoned the government in Kigali, to request instructions. <b>He</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> Colonel Elie Sagatwa, one of the akazu, who ordered him to kill every inmate in the prison, to avoid escape and defections during the fighting, and to prevent high-profile political prisoners and former insiders from sharing secret information with the RPF. Uwihoreye refused to obey, even after Sagatwa called him to repeat the order, having confirmed it with the president. Eventually the RPF stormed the buildings, and the prisoners were saved. Several prisoners were recruited into the RPF, including Theoneste Lizinde, a former close ally of President Habyarimana, who had been arrested following a failed coup attempt in 1980.|$|E
60|$|Adam <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> his own man, Davenport, who was {{standing}} by, having arrived with the bailiff of Lesser Hill, who had followed Mr. Salton in a pony trap. As <b>he</b> <b>spoke,</b> <b>he</b> pointed <b>to</b> an attentive ship's steward, and presently {{the two men were}} conversing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come!" [...] {{said one}} of her captors, both of whom had {{retained}} a hold upon her. As <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>he</b> tried <b>to</b> lead her away with him toward the nearest tower.|$|R
6000|$|... "Are {{those the}} banners you captured, Sam?" [...] {{questioned}} Tom, {{when the boys}} entered the room, and as <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>he</b> pointed <b>to</b> two banners which were nailed up on the wall.|$|R
