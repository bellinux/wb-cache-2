O preparo das estacas livre de vírus dos porta-enxertos consistiu em deixar apenas uma folha na parte {{superior}} da estaca e um nó na base, ficando as mesmas com 20 cm de comprimento e 0, 5 cm de diâmetro. Para o enraizamento, as estacas foram então dispostas em caixas plásticas perfuradas contendo o substrato casca de arroz carbonizada em câmara de nebulização. Após quatro semanas, os porta-enxertos foram transplantados para sacos de polietileno com substrato a base de terra e mantidos em casa de vegetação. Avaliou-se a enxertia da videira ‘Rubi’ livre de vírus realizada em três épocas após o transplantio dos porta-enxertos (30, 60 e 90 dias). O delineamento experimental foi o inteiramente casualizado com 6 tratamentos e 5 repetições, sendo cada parcela composta por 10 mudas, em esquema fatorial 2 x 3. Aos 80 dias após cada época de enxertia, foram avaliados os seguintes parâmetros: porcentagem de enxertos brotados, comprimento e diâmetro dos brotos, matérias seca e fresca das raízes por muda e quantificação do sistema radicular (área de raízes e comprimento total de raízes por estaca) através da análise de imagem no programa SIARCS®. Com base nos principais resultados, pôde-se concluir que: a) a obtenção antecipada de mudas de videira ‘Rubi’ é possível realizando-se a enxertia verde em estacas herbáceas dos porta-enxertos ‘Campinas’ e ‘Jales’ 90 dias após o seu enraizamento e b) o emprego da enxertia verde sobre a produção antecipada de mudas de videira ‘Rubi’ reduz em 5 - 6 meses o tempo necessário para a produção de mudas em casa de vegetação e c) mudas de videira ‘Rubi’ produzidas por enxertia verde em estacas herbáceas dos porta-enxertos ‘Campinas’ e ‘Jales’ não apresentam diferenças quanto às características dos enxertos brotados e do seu sistema radicular. The objetive of {{this research}} was to evaluate the feasibility to produce nursery trees of ‘Rubi’ grapevine through <b>green</b> <b>grafting</b> on herbaceous cutting of two vine rootstocks (‘Campinas’ - IAC 766 and ‘Jales’ - IAC 572). Rootstocks cuttings were taken from a virus-free stock plant, and consisted of the leaves elimination of the basal portion, leaving just one leaf in the superior part of each one. Cuttings were prepared with a cut below the node in the basal portion and a cut in the internode in the superior portion, leaving each one with 20 cm of length and 0. 5 cm of diameter. Cuttings were then placed in plastic boxes containing hull rice coal growth medium on mist chamber. After four weeks, the rooted rootstocks were transferred into plastic bags containing soil mix. The ‘Rubi’ <b>green</b> <b>grafting</b> was performed in three different periods after the rootstocks transplantation (30, 60 and 90 days). A randomized design was used as statistical model with 6 treatments and 5 replications. Each plot was composed by 10 trees. The treatments were compared 80 days after each grafting period through the following parameters: porcentage of shooting grafts, length and diameter of shooting grafts, fresh and dry weigth of roots and root quantification (root area and total root length) through image analysis using SIARCS® software. It was possible to conclude that: a) the production advance of ‘Rubi’ young trees is possible performing the <b>green</b> <b>grafting</b> on ‘Campinas’ and ‘Jales’ rootstocks 90 days after their rooting, b) the <b>green</b> <b>grafting</b> technique reduces the time necessary to produce ‘Rubi’ young trees by 5 - 6 months on greenhouse condition and c) nursery trees of ‘Rubi’ grapevine produced through <b>green</b> <b>grafting</b> on herbaceous cuttings of ‘Campinas’ and ‘Jales’ rootstocks do not show differences in relation to the shooting grafts and the root system characteristics...|$|E

With the aim to obtain more information about appearance of rugose wood disease observed on cultivar ‘Refošk’, ‘Refošk’ vines from collection vineyard in Komen were used for <b>green</b> <b>grafting</b> on SO 4 rootstock and autografts for control were made as well. Rugose wood symptoms were observed on grafts of two ‘Refošk’ biotypes, which confirmed graft transmissibility.

40|$|Muscadinia rotundifolia is a wild grape {{native to}} the Southeast U. S. In field trials, {{as well as in}} the wild, this species {{exhibits}} strong resistance to Pierce’s disease (PD). Incorporating this resistance into Vitis vinifera production systems in California will require identifying prime breeding material and increasing our understanding of the mechanism of resistance. The first objective of this study was to determine if resistance to Xylella fastidiosa (Xf) and PD varies among wild M. rotundifolia populations across a natural gradient of disease pressure. Greenhouse trials are underway using material collected in Florida, Georgia and Tennessee. The second objective was to test the common belief that some M. rotundifolia cultivars are more Xf resistant than others are. Again, trials are currently underway. Thirdly, we want to test if Xf resistance in M. rotundifolia is consistent when challenged with different Xf strains from Florida and California. Lastly, we want to examine the potential for conferring Xf and PD resistance to V. vinifera scions by grafting them to resistant M. rotundifolia rootstocks. This project is ongoing and only very preliminary results are available now. One such result is that even the least resistant M. rotundifolia selections are much more resistant than the Vitis vinifera cultivars. We have also confirmed that supposed graft incompatibility between the two species can be overcome using <b>green</b> <b>grafting</b> techniques. These grafted plants are entering disease trials now...|$|E

A tobamovirus particle examined in the rootstock of the sample {{but not in the}} scion showing necrosis. The virus isolated from the rootstock was identified as Pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV), pepper tobamovirus pathotype P 1. 2. (PMMoV- 2), by nucleotide sequence analysis and host plant reaction. The virus isolate infected systematically in 6 commercial rootstock varieties using for <b>green</b> pepper <b>grafting</b> seedling production. <b>Green</b> pepper varieties ``Long green mart`` and ``Daechan`` represented resistance to the virus showing local lesions only on the inoculated leaves and ``Manitda`` was systematically infected. In the experiment with <b>grafting</b> ``Long <b>green</b> mart`` or ``Daechan`` onto the those rootstocks, the upper leaves of the scions first showed vein necrosis and wilt symptoms 7 days after inoculation with PMMoV- 2 on the cotyledon of the rootstock, following to the scion stem necrosis and then only the scion death. The virus was detected in the rootstock but not in the scion. However, ``Manitda`` of susceptible variety in the grafting system showed mottle symptom on the leaves of the scion but not necrosis on the plant. PMMoV- 3 isolate, pepper tobamovirus pathotype P 1. 2. 3, did not cause the scion death in the grafting system. All of the varieties were susceptible to PMMoV- 3. These results suggest that the scion death is caused by infecting with pepper tobamovirus pathotype P 1. 2. in the <b>green</b> pepper <b>grafting</b> system combined with the susceptible rootstock and the resistance scion to the virus pathotype...|$|R

40|$|Chemical {{modification}} of mesoporous SiO 2 SBA- 15 with thiol groups was performed using mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane (MPTMS) dissolved in supercritical CO 2 (scCO 2). Thiol groups serve as adsorbents for the selective removal of contaminant metal cations and in catalysis. Functionalization {{was carried out}} in scCO 2 at temperatures ranging from 40 to 150 °C and pressures from 15. 0 to 29. 0 MPa. For comparison purposes, the reaction was also performed in toluene at 80 and 110 °C. As opposed to toluene, scCO 2 is considered a <b>green</b> solvent. <b>Grafting</b> of the thiol groups was confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and elemental analysis. Grafting density and surface coverage of the materials modified using scCO 2 increased with temperature, CO 2 density, time and stirring and varied from 1. 3 to 4. 4 mmol g− 1 and from 1. 3 to 4. 0 molecules nm− 2, respectively. On the other hand, surface area and pore size decreased as grafting density increased. At temperatures of 80 °C or higher, the pore size remained constant, suggesting the formation of a compact monolayer. Modification at higher temperatures led to larger grafting densities but very low surface areas. Assuming total hydrolysis and condensation of the precursor, the optimum grafting density and surface coverage of 2. 3 mmol g− 1 and 2. 4 molecules nm− 2, respectively, were obtained in scCO 2 at 80 °C and 25. 0 MPa for 4 h. Grafting densities of the samples prepared in toluene were by far much lower than those obtained using scCO 2 at lower temperatures and shorter times, which demonstrates the advantages of CO 2 as a green functionalization medium...|$|R

Emerging cell therapies {{for the restoration of}} sight have focused on two areas of the eye that are critical for visual function, the cornea and the retina. The relatively easy access of the cornea, the homogeneity of the cells forming the different layers of the corneal epithelium and the improvement of cell culture protocols are leading to considerable success in corneal epithelium restoration. Rebuilding the entire cornea is however still far from reality. The restoration of the retina has recently been achieved in different animal models of retinal degeneration using immature photoreceptors, and two other promising strategies have been demonstrated: transplantation of endothelial precursors to rescue retinal vessels and neurons, and transplantation of retinal pigmented epithelial cells to preserve vision over the long term.

The pattern of RGC axon ingrowth into OEG containing cografts {{was similar to that}} in control grafts. However, in Schwann cell cografts there was reduced host retinal input into presumptive target areas and many RGC axons were scattered throughout the neuropil. Given that OEG in cografts had minimal impact on axontarget cell recognition, OEG might be an appropriate cell type for direct transplantation into injured neuropil when attempting to stimulate specific pathway reconstruction...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectivesWe {{proposed}} to fabricate a tissue-engineered esophagus {{and to use}} it for replacement of the abdominal esophagus. MethodsEsophagus organoid units, mesenchymal cores surrounded by epithelial cells, were isolated from neonatal or adult rats and paratopically transplanted on biodegradable polymer tubes, which were implanted in syngeneic hosts. Four weeks later, the tissue-engineered esophagus was either harvested or anastomosed as an onlay patch or total interposition <b>graft.</b> <b>Green</b> Fluorescent Protein labeling by means of viral infection of the organoid units was performed before implantation. Histology and immunohistochemical detection of the antigen α-actin smooth muscle were performed. ResultsTissue-engineered esophagus grows in sufficient quantity for interposition grafting. Histology reveals a complete esophageal wall, including mucosa, submucosa, and muscularis propria, which was confirmed by means of immunohistochemical staining for α-actin smooth muscle. Tissue-engineered esophagus architecture was maintained after interposition or use as a patch, and animals gained weight on a normal diet. Green Fluorescent Protein–labeled tissue-engineered esophagus preserved its fluorescent label, proving the donor origin of the tissue-engineered esophagus. ConclusionsTissue-engineered esophagus resembles the native esophagus and maintains normal histology in anastomosis, with implications for therapy of long-segment esophageal tissue loss caused by congenital absence, surgical excision, or trauma...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundEarly {{coronary}} bypass graft failures may be preventable if identified intraoperatively. The {{purpose of this}} investigation was to compare the diagnostic accuracy of two intraoperative graft assessment techniques, transit-time ultrasound flow measurement and indocyanine <b>green</b> fluorescent-dye <b>graft</b> angiography. MethodsPatents undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass grafting with no contraindications for postoperative angiography were enrolled in the study. Patients were randomly assigned to be evaluated with either indocyanine green angiography (Novadaq Spy angiography system; Novadaq Technologies Inc, Concord, Ontario, Canada) and then transit-time ultrasonic flow measurement (Medtronic Medi-Stim Butterfly Flowmeter TTF measurement system; Medtronic Inc, Minneapolis, Minn) or transit-time flow then indocyanine green angiography. Patients underwent x-ray angiography on postoperative day 4. The primary end point of the trial was to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the two techniques versus reference standard x-ray angiography to detect graft occlusion or greater than 50 % stenosis in the graft or perianastomotic area. ResultsBetween February 2004 and March 2005, 106 patients were enrolled and x-ray angiography was performed in 46 patients. In total, 139 grafts were reviewed with all three techniques and 12 grafts (8. 2 %) were demonstrated to have greater than 50 % stenosis or occlusion by the reference standard. The sensitivity and specificity of indocyanine green angiography to detect greater than 50 % stenosis or occlusion was 83. 3 % and 100 %, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of transit-time ultrasonic flow measurement to detect greater than 50 % stenosis or occlusion was 25 % and 98. 4 %, respectively. The P value for the overall comparison of sensitivity and specificity between indocyanine green angiography and transit-time flow ultrasonography was. 011. The difference between sensitivity for indocyanine green angiography and transit-time flow measurement was 58 % with a 95 % confidence interval of 30 % to 86 %, P =. 023.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{describes}} {{for the first}} time the synthesis of silica nanoparticles starting from sodium silicate and oleic acid (OLA). The interactions between OLA and sodium silicate require an optimal OLA/OLANa molar ratio able to generate vesicles that can stabilize silica particles obtained by the sol-gel process of sodium silicate. The optimal molar ratio of OLA/OLANa can be ensured by a proper selection of OLA and respectively of sodium silicate concentration. The titration of sodium silicate with OLA revealed a stabilization phenomenon of silica/OLA vesicles and the dependence between their average size and reagent’s molar ratio. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements emphasized the successful synthesis of silica nanoparticles starting from renewable materials, in mild condition of <b>green</b> chemistry. By <b>grafting</b> octadecyltrimethoxysilane on the initial silica particles, an increased interaction between silica particles and the OLA/OLANa complex was achieved.

Similarly, eight months after inoculation the percentage of plants showing foliar symptoms was greater in the N. parvum treatments than in the D. seriata treatments. During the emergence of foliar symptoms, plant stress-related responses were modulated in green stems and leaves, especially a down-regulation of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and fasciclin-like arabinogalactan protein (fascAGP) and an up-regulation of stilbene synthase (STS) with an accumulation of phenolics.

Growth of cultured human epidermal cells into multiple epithelia suitable for grafting. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 1979; 76 (11) : 5665 - 8], stimulating these cells to produce specific peptides that start an immunological chain reaction in the epidermis [O'Connor NE, Mulliken JB, Banks-Schlegel S, Kehinde O, <b>Green</b> H. <b>Grafting</b> of burns with cultured epithelium prepared from autologous epidermal cells. Lancet 1981;(1) : 75 - 8]. the immune reaction causes the release of cytokines and growth factors. {{the objective of this}} study was to test whether the presence of keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) alters P. aeruginosa proliferation in an experimental burn model. Methods: Human keratinocytes derived from neonatal foreskins were isolated and cultured following standard methods [Gallico III, GG, O'Connor NE, Compton CC, Kehinde O, Green H. Permanent coverage of large burn wounds with autologous cultured human epithelium. N Engl J Med 1984; 311 (7) : 448 - 51]. Some of these cells were genetically modified to produce KGF, and the other cells were supplemented with different KGF concentrations in the culture media. Both groups of keratinocytes were seeded in collagen matrices and cultured to form stratified epithelia. A hot plate was used to produce burn defects. Each matrix was inoculated with luminescent P. aeruginosa strain. Experiments were made using keratinocytes without KGF, keratinocytes supplemented with different concentrations of KGF, and keratinocytes genetically modified to produce KGF. Statistical analyses were made using Wilcoxon paired test. Results: When KGF was added to P. aeruginosa in the presence of keratinocytes, bacterial growth was inhibited, and the same was observed when genetically modified keratinocytes were used. Conclusion: Many studies have been done on KGF, where its known properties were defined as a mitogen for keratinocytes [Munster AM. Cultured skin for massive burns: a prospective, controlled trial. Ann Surg 1996; 224 (3) : 372 - 7]. This method allows for a qualitative and quantitative evaluation in real time of the bacterial growth in wound sites after bacterial inoculation. KGF was involved in the reduction of bacterial viability. However, as KGF alone did not produce any effect on P. aeruginosa, it seems to modulate the skin innate immune response.

MethodsCultured embryonic stem cell-derived cells were transfected with green fluorescent protein. Embryonic stem cell-derived cells were administered through the tail vein (approximately 107 cells in 1 mL of medium for each rat) every other day for 6 days in 45 rats after myocardial infarction. Six weeks after myocardial infarction and cell infusion, cardiac function, blood flow, and the numeric density of arterioles were measured to test the benefits of cell therapy. An in vitro Transwell assay was performed to evaluate the embryonic stem cell migration. ResultsVentricular function, regional blood flow, and arteriole density were significantly increased in rats receiving intravenously infused embryonic stem cell-derived cells compared with control rats after myocardial infarction. Histologic analysis demonstrated that infused embryonic stem cell-derived cells formed <b>green</b> fluorescent protein-positive <b>grafts</b> in infarcted myocardium. Additionally, positive immunostaining for cardiac troponin I was found in hearts after myocardial infarction receiving embryonic stem cell-derived cell infusion that corresponded to the green fluorescent protein-positive staining. The Transwell migration assay indicated that cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes with overexpression of tumor necrosis factor α induced greater migration of embryonic stem cells compared with cardiomyocytes without tumor necrosis factor α expression. ConclusionsOur data demonstrate that intravenously infused embryonic stem cell-derived cells homed to the infarcted heart, improved cardiac function, and enhanced regional blood flow at 6 weeks after myocardial infarction.

Verificou-se que a cultivar Gigante das Alagoas foi superior à Crioula quanto ao pegamento do enxerto aos 60 e 90 dias após a enxertia. O melhor método de enxertia dependeu do tipo de recipiente, pois, quando se utilizaram sacos de polietileno, o método de enxertia por borbulhia em escudo foi superior aos de garfagens nas avaliações realizadas aos 60 e 90 dias após a enxertia, apresentando a percentagem média de pegamento do enxerto de 100 e 95 %, respectivamente. Entretanto, utilizando recipientes de tubetes, todos os três métodos de enxertia testados apresentaram porcentagem média de pegamento do enxerto superior a 75 %, porém, não diferiram estatisticamente entre si.
