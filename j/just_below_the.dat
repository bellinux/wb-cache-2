5|$|Like {{most other}} Proteaceae, B.spinulosa has proteoid roots, roots with dense {{clusters}} of short lateral rootlets that form a mat {{in the soil}} <b>just</b> <b>below</b> <b>the</b> leaf litter. These enhance solubilisation of nutrients, allowing nutrient uptake in low-nutrient soils such as the phosphorus-deficient native soils of Australia.|$|E
5|$|Like {{most other}} Proteaceae, B.telmatiaea has proteoid roots, roots with dense {{clusters}} of short lateral rootlets that form a mat {{in the soil}} <b>just</b> <b>below</b> <b>the</b> leaf litter. These roots are particularly efficient at absorbing nutrients from nutrient-poor soils, such as the phosphorus-deficient native soils of Australia.|$|E
5|$|The uniform worn for {{practicing}} aikido (aikidōgi) {{is similar}} to the training uniform (keikogi) used in most other modern martial arts; simple trousers and a wraparound jacket, usually white. Both thick ("judo-style"), and thin ("karate-style") cotton tops are used. Aikido-specific tops are available with shorter sleeves which reach to <b>just</b> <b>below</b> <b>the</b> elbow.|$|E

5|$|An optical phenomenon, {{known as}} a green flash, can {{sometimes}} be seen shortly after sunset or before sunrise. The flash is caused by light from the Sun <b>just</b> <b>below</b> <b>the</b> horizon being bent (usually through a temperature inversion) towards the observer. Light of shorter wavelengths (violet, blue, green) is bent more than that of longer wavelengths (yellow, orange, red) but the violet and blue light is scattered more, leaving light that is perceived as green.|$|E
5|$|Hatchlings were {{described}} as grey and downy, but their exact appearance is unknown, since no skins exist today. Juvenile birds had fewer prominent grooves in their beaks than adults and they had mottled white and black necks, while the eye spot found in adults was not present; instead, a grey line ran through the eyes (which still had white eye rings) to <b>just</b> <b>below</b> <b>the</b> ears.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to improve the Australian line of {{communications}} in the sector, engineers from the 16th Field Company later constructed a road using a bulldozer that had to haul itself up the ridge via a steel cable that was manhandled {{up to a point}} <b>just</b> <b>below</b> <b>the</b> ridge over the course of eight days. A light rail system was also established between Barges' Hill and Pearl Ridge.|$|E

5|$|Like most Proteaceae, T.truncata has fine proteoid {{roots that}} arise from larger roots. These are roots with dense {{clusters}} of short lateral rootlets that form a mat in the soil <b>just</b> <b>below</b> <b>the</b> leaf litter. They are particularly efficient at absorbing nutrients from nutrient-poor soils, including the phosphorus-deficient native soils of Australia. Waratah seeds are often eaten—and destroyed—by animals and do not travel far (just several metres) from the parent plants.|$|E
5|$|Like {{most other}} Proteaceae, B.ericifolia has proteoid roots—roots with dense {{clusters}} of short lateral rootlets that form a mat {{in the soil}} <b>just</b> <b>below</b> <b>the</b> leaf litter. These enhance solubilisation of nutrients, allowing nutrient uptake in low-nutrient soils such as the phosphorus-deficient native soils of Australia. The species lacks a lignotuber, and so is killed by fire and regenerates from seed.|$|E
5|$|Like {{most other}} Proteaceae, B.integrifolia has proteoid roots, roots with dense {{clusters}} of short lateral rootlets that form a mat {{in the soil}} <b>just</b> <b>below</b> <b>the</b> leaf litter. These enhance solubilisation of nutrients, thus allowing nutrient uptake in low-nutrient soils such as the phosphorus-deficient native soils of Australia. Studies on B.integrifolia suggest that its proteoid root mat achieves this by chemically modifying its soil environment.|$|E

5|$|Like {{most other}} Proteaceae, B.sessilis has {{compound}} cluster roots, roots with dense clusters of short lateral rootlets that form a mat {{in the soil}} <b>just</b> <b>below</b> <b>the</b> leaf litter. These exude a range of carboxylates, including citrate, malonate and trans-aconitate, that act as acid phosphatase, allowing the absorption of nutrients from nutrient-poor soils, such as the phosphorus-deficient native soils of Australia.|$|E
5|$|Like {{most other}} Proteaceae, Banksia violacea has proteoid roots, roots with dense {{clusters}} of short lateral rootlets that form a mat {{in the soil}} <b>just</b> <b>below</b> <b>the</b> leaf litter. These enhance solubilisation of nutrients, thus allowing their uptake in low-nutrient soils such as the phosphorus-deficient soils of Australia. B.violacea is highly susceptible to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback.|$|E
5|$|Metalloids lie {{on either}} side of the {{dividing}} line between metals and nonmetals. This can be found, in varying configurations, on some periodic tables. Elements to the lower left of the line generally display increasing metallic behaviour; elements to the upper right display increasing nonmetallic behaviour. When presented as a regular stairstep, elements with the highest critical temperature for their groups (Li, Be, Al, Ge, Sb, Po) lie <b>just</b> <b>below</b> <b>the</b> line.|$|E

5|$|Most Proteaceae and all Banksia species, {{including}} B.scabrella, have proteoid roots, roots with dense {{clusters of}} short lateral rootlets that form a mat {{in the soil}} <b>just</b> <b>below</b> <b>the</b> leaf litter.

5|$|T. oreades has {{a central}} taproot and few lateral roots. Like most Proteaceae, it has fine proteoid roots {{that arise from}} larger roots.

5|$|The {{two main}} {{parts of the}} wreck of Titanic present a {{striking}} contrast. Although fourteen survivors testified that the ship had broken apart as she sank, this testimony was discounted by the official inquiries, and it was supposed that the ship had sunk intact.

5|$|Upper-level jet streams. Associated with {{upper level}} jet streams is a {{phenomenon}} known as clear air turbulence (CAT), caused by vertical and horizontal wind shear connected to the wind gradient {{at the edge of}} the jet streams. The CAT is strongest on the anticyclonic shear side of the jet, usually next to or <b>just</b> <b>below</b> <b>the</b> axis of the jet.|$|E

In very young fruit bodies, stems and caps are very pale buff, {{but soon the}} color of the cap deepens and becomes cinnamon. The intensity of the color appears to be dependent on light, for when fruit bodies are grown in diffuse light (temperature and humidity being constant) they are a uniform pale buff color, but in bright light they are cinnamon or tan.|$|E
