5|$|For {{the general}} {{case of a}} line {{terminated}} in some arbitrary impedance it is usual to describe the signal as a wave traveling down the line and analyse it in the frequency domain. The impedance is consequently represented as a frequency <b>dependant</b> complex function.|$|E
5|$|In {{some unusual}} ionic compounds: fast ion conductors, and ionic glasses, {{one or more}} of the ionic {{components}} has a significant mobility, allowing conductivity even while the material as a whole remains solid. This is often highly temperature <b>dependant,</b> and may be the result of either a phase change or a high defect concentration. These materials are used in all solid-state supercapacitors, batteries, and fuel cells, and in various kinds of chemical sensors.|$|E
5|$|After a jet-set life in Singapore, Adam {{returns to}} Manchester {{to visit his}} old friends and to see son Matthew (now portrayed by Ceallach Spellman), {{breaking}} the news of his upcoming nuptials with businesswoman Angela Zubayr (Karen David). This isn't well received amongst the group, especially Matthew who sees Angela {{as a replacement for}} his mother Rachel. Struggling to support his family, Pete finds himself in two run down jobs and suffering from depression, which Jenny seems oblivious too. Seeing a fault in their love life, she pursues a fling with client Trevor Green (Nicholas Gleaves), who begins to stalk her. Torn apart after the death of Harry (James Bolam), an old man who he was caring for, Pete considers suicide. David is entangled through a wrongdoing at work and is arrested, something which his wife Robyn finds humiliating and throws him out of their luxury Cheshire home. Karen finds herself on the dating game, and soon falls for Adam's father-in-law Eddie (Art Malik), though later discovers that they live in two very different worlds, with Karen's twin daughters Ellie (Ella Hunt) and Olivia (Daisy Edgar-Jones) still <b>dependant</b> on her. Jenny's ex-partner Robert (Robert Webb) from her time in New York City turns up on her doorstep determined to see their daughter Chloe (Madeleine Edmondson), who still believes that Pete is her father. Struggling to cope with living in Manchester and being step-mother to Matthew, Angela decides to end her marriage with Adam, who fell quickly for his landlord Tina Reynolds (Leanne Best). At Adam's 49th Birthday party, the Marsden's eldest son Josh (Callum Woodhouse) arrives from Spain with former nanny Ramona (Jacey Salles), and it is later revealed that he is gay.|$|E

40|$|The {{question}} of which household members should consume medical services, {{and in what}} quantities, is examined by using Japanese household-level data. Two key concepts are employed, health risk and income risk, and whether family heads or <b>dependants</b> bear these risks investigated. Health risk is the risk that a household member falls ill, while income risk is the risk that future household income decreases. It is found that both heads and <b>dependants</b> make fewer visits to doctors as household size increases. It is also found that only <b>dependants</b> visited doctors less frequently following the reform {{of the public health}} insurance system, which raised the co-payment rate of family heads from 10 % to 20 %. These findings imply that heads and <b>dependants</b> share health risk but <b>dependants</b> bear income risk. ...|$|R

25|$|NMDA receptors {{are another}} cation channel {{that is more}} {{permeable}} to Ca2+. The function of NMDA receptors is <b>dependant</b> on Glycine receptor binding as a co-agonist within the channel pore. NMDA receptors do not function without both ligands present.|$|E
25|$|As it is {{commonly}} the case for Monte-Carlo methods, this algorithm performs particularly well when the dimension is higher than , and one only needs a small set of values. Indeed, the computational cost increases linearly with the dimension, whereas the cost of grid <b>dependant</b> methods increase exponentially with the dimension.|$|E

25|$|Tissue {{repair and}} {{maintenance}} are {{important parts of}} the life cycle of an organism, cells and tissues must remain in homeostasis to ensure survival.

25|$|Various {{changes were}} also {{made to the}} tax system which benefited workers on low and middle incomes. Married couples with low incomes benefited from the {{increases}} in the single personal allowance and marriage allowance. In 1965, the regressive allowance for national insurance contributions was abolished and the single personal allowance, marriage allowance and wife's earned income relief were increased. These allowances were further increased in the tax years 1969–70 and 1970–71. Increases in the age exemption and <b>dependant</b> relative's income limits benefited the low-income elderly. In 1967, new tax concessions were introduced for widows.|$|E
25|$|The {{collapse}} of the French absolute monarchy with the French Revolution had an important impact on the French Navy: the Navy was strongly linked to the monarchy by its officer corps, largely recruited from the nobility, and trained in highly technical disciplines; it was also enormously <b>dependant</b> on funds and supplies to maintain ships and crews. The {{collapse of}} Royal power triggered a shift of authority towards local governments, the revolutionary municipalities. These municipalities were both the rivals of the former detentors of authority under the Ancien Régime, and potential rivals to the central power in Paris.|$|E
25|$|The 135 {{members of}} the Parliament of Catalonia were elected using the D'Hondt method and a closed list {{proportional}} representation, with a threshold of 3 per 100 of valid votes—which included blank ballots—being applied in each constituency.

Additionally, {{the use of the}} D'Hondt method might result in an effective threshold over three percent, <b>dependant</b> on the district magnitude.

25|$|Student nurses {{currently}} {{receive a}} bursary {{from the government}} to support them during their nurse training. Diploma students in England receive a non-means-tested bursary of around £6,000 – £8,000 per year (with additional allowances for students with <b>dependant</b> children), whereas degree students have their bursary means tested (and often receive considerably less). Degree students are, however, eligible for a proportion of the government's student loan, unlike diploma students. But in Scotland and Wales, all student nurses (regardless of which course they are undertaking) receive the same bursary {{in line with the}} English diploma course. All student nurses in Wales study, initially, for a degree, but may chose to remain at Level 2 for their third year, thereby achieving a diploma rather than a degree.|$|E
