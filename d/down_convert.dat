50|$|Carry one.carry allThe National Association of Broadcasters, {{which did}} not return {{requests}} for comment, {{is probably going to}} be unhappy because the FCC plans to allow DirecTV and Dish to <b>down</b> <b>convert</b> broadcasters’ HD signals to a less pristine picture resolution for several years.The satellite giants-which combined serve about 30 million pay-TV subscribers-convinced FCC officials that they lacked the channel capacity to provide every eligible station in HD immediately. They insisted that they needed several years to prepare for a full HD carriage requirement.HD signals stress capacity because they take up much more bandwidth than digital signal transmitted at lower resolution.The FCC’s HD rules for satellite were far more lenient than the ones originally proposed by FCC chairman Kevin Martin. He started off at full HD carriage in February 2009, coupled with a market-by-market waiver process.Martin scuttled his original plan after DirecTV and Dish Network complained that it was draconian and damaging to their ability to compete with cable.Instead, the FCC decided to give DirecTV and EchoStar until 2013 to carry all stations in HD within any market where they have elected to carry any station's signal in HD format.The “carry one, carry all in HD” principle kicks in when a satellite company starts carrying local signals in HD. DirecTV’s decision to carry local TV signals in HD does not force Dish to do likewise in the same market.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project {{is to set up}} a system for {{creating}} entangled photon pairs for use in various quantum mechanical experiments, including the testing of Bell’s inequalities which demonstrates the fundamentally indeterministic nature of quantum mechanics. The photons are created by pumping a beta barium borate crystal with 405 nm laser light then, due to a process called type 1 spontaneous parametric down conversion, a single pump photon can be converted into two 810 nm photons in an entangled state.

40|$|An RF {{front end}} {{receiver}} system {{refers to the}} analog down conversion stages of the wireless communication system. The Digital base-band signals cannot be transmitted directly through wireless channels due to the properties of electromagnetic waves. The baseband signals need to be converted to analog through a digital-to-analog converter (DAC), up converted to higher frequency using an up conversion mixer and then transmitted through the channel. The received signals are <b>down</b> <b>converted</b> to base band frequency and then converted to digital again using the {{analog to digital converter}} (ADC). The processes which the analog signal undergoes at the RF front end include amplification, mixing and filtering. The RF Front End receiver developed in this thesis makes use of a differential low noise amplifier (LNA) with center frequency at 1. 75 GHz.

40|$|Subsampling {{receivers}} utilise the subsampling {{method to}} <b>down</b> <b>convert</b> signals from radio frequency (RF) {{to a lower}} frequency location. Multiple signals can also be down converted using the subsampling receiver, but using the incorrect subsampling frequency could result in signals aliasing one another after down conversion. The existing method for subsampling multiband signals focused on down converting all the signals without any aliasing between the signals. The case considered initially was a dual band signal, {{and then it was}} further extended to a more general multiband case. In this thesis, a new method is proposed with the assumption that only one signal is needed to not overlap the other multiband signals that are down converted at the same time. The proposed method will introduce unique formulas using the said assumption to calculate the valid subsampling frequencies, ensuring that the target signal is not aliased by the other signals. Simulation results show that the proposed method will provide lower valid subsampling frequencies for down conversion compared to the existing methods...|$|E

40|$|A digital down {{converter}} (DDC) typically receives a digital input {{that has been}} generated by an {{analog to digital converter}} (ADC) operating at intermediate frequency (IF) in an RF receiver chain. The function of the DDC is to <b>down</b> <b>convert</b> the IF signal to baseband in phase (I) and quadrature (Q) signals and is a very important component in wireless receivers. A Digital Down Converter (DDC) is developed based on square wave local oscillators facilitating a multiplier-less implementation with no constraints on the sampling frequency. The DDC includes a pseudo multi-rate SINC low pass filter which exhibits better performance compared to the standard multi-stage SINC filter. The pseudo multi-rate SINC filter can be implemented with a unique cascaded integrator comb (CIC) filter to obtain the same improved performance.

Our final aim {{is to use a}} GFET to <b>down</b> <b>convert</b> an optical to a radiofrequency signal. The technological steps used for the devices fabrication as well as the photoelectrical characterization will be reported.

The electrical signal out of the GFETs (in a common source amplifier configuration) was measured using a lock-in amplifier synchronized to the same reference frequency of the laser driver. This gave us the possibility to evaluate the optical response as a function of both the incident laser power and the DC biasing of the device. In particular, in order to explore the GFETs photovoltaic characteristics, we decided to perform low noise measurements at zero bias (VDS= 0) and with VGS ranging between - 2 V and + 2 V.

The infrared region near 3 microns suffers from chemiluminescence and from spectral contamination due to water. The ultraviolet region near 300 nm requires solar illumination. The three techniques for OH emission measurements in the THz region include Fourier Transform interferometry, Fabry-Perot interferometry, and heterodyne radiometry.
