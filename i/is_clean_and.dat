25|$|In {{reciting the}} Scout Oath, Scouts promise {{to do their}} duty to God and to be morally straight; the Scout Law holds that a Scout <b>is</b> <b>clean</b> <b>and</b> reverent. As early as 1978, the Boy Scouts of America {{circulated}} a memorandum among national executive staff stating {{that it was not}} appropriate for homosexuals to hold leadership positions in BSA. Similarly, since at least 1985, the BSA has interpreted the Scout Oath and Law as being incompatible with agnosticism and atheism. In both instances, the organization asserted {{that it was not a}} new policy to oppose and disfavor atheism, agnosticism and homosexuality, but rather, it was just enforcing long-held policies which had never been published or publicly challenged.|$|E

25|$|Lake Nockamixon is an {{artificial}} reservoir formed by a dam on Tohickon Creek {{and serves as}} the centerpiece of Nockamixon State Park. Swimming is not allowed in the lake, but boating is popular, and the park maintains several marinas and boat rentals. Fishing is also popular, and common species include walleye, pickerel, carp, and various kinds of bass and catfish. The water <b>is</b> <b>clean</b> <b>and</b> blue and has a very faint current, since the lake is part of the course of Tohickon Creek, which feeds in midway along the northwestern edge of the lake and discharges at the dam at the southeast corner. Lake Nockamixon is also fed by two other creeks known as Haycock Run, which feeds in at the northernmost point, and Three Mile Run, which feeds in at the southernmost point.|$|E
25|$|Stimulation from {{anal sex}} can {{additionally}} {{be affected by}} popular perception or portrayals of the activity, such as erotica or pornography. In pornography, anal sex is commonly portrayed as a desirable, painless routine that does not require personal lubricant; this can result in couples performing anal sex without care, and men and women believing that it is unusual for women, as receptive partners, to find discomfort or pain instead of pleasure from the activity. By contrast, each person's sphincter muscles react to penetration differently, the anal sphincters have tissues that {{are more prone to}} tearing, and the anus and rectum do not provide lubrication for sexual penetration like the vagina does. Researchers say adequate application of a personal lubricant, relaxation, and communication between sexual partners are crucial to avoid pain or damage to the anus or rectum. Additionally, ensuring that the anal area <b>is</b> <b>clean</b> <b>and</b> the bowel is empty, for both aesthetics and practicality, may be desired by participants.|$|E

25|$|Maimonides {{taught that}} techelet refers to wool dyed light blue, {{the color of}} the sky {{opposite}} the sun on a clear day. The term refers to a specific dye, and use of any other dye is unfit even though it is sky-blue in color. The techelet of tzitzit is dyed by soaking wool in lime. Afterwards, it is taken and washed until it <b>is</b> <b>clean</b> <b>and</b> then boiled with bleach to prepare it to accept the dye. They take the blood of a chilazon fish, found in the Mediterranean Sea, whose color is like {{the color of the}} sea and whose blood is black like ink, and place the blood in a pot together with herbs, boil it, and insert the wool until it becomes sky-blue. Maimonides taught that one may buy techelet from an outlet that has established a reputation for authenticity without question, and one may rely on its reputation until a reason for suspicion arises. When a garment is entirely red, green, or any other color other than white, its white strands should be made from the same color as the garment itself. If the garment is techelet, its white strands should be made from any color other than black.|$|E
500|$|The game {{takes place}} on Anachronox (a {{portmanteau}} of anachronism and noxious, meaning [...] "poison from the past"), a small planet floating inside a huge artificial sphere known as Sender One. Husks of futuristic cities exist on artificial tectonic plates, which constantly shift to connect {{different parts of the}} planet. Inhabitants believe that diseased aliens were quarantined there eons ago, resulting in the name Anachronox. Northern Anachronox <b>is</b> <b>clean</b> <b>and</b> upscale, while southern Anachronox is crime-ridden and run-down. Humanity travels to different planets from Sender One, which had been the center of a transportation system for a race of non-humanoids enabling faster-than-light travel.

Civilizations conduct business using currency like the one-dollar coin known as a [...] "loonie", while several people collect MysTech—shards of rock with markings, believed to be dormant weapons or art pieces created by an extinct alien race.

2500|$|In bowling, a pinsetter, or pinspotter, was {{originally}} {{a person who}} manually reset bowling pins to their correct position, cleared fallen pins, and returned bowling balls to players. [...] Probably {{due to the nature}} of the work (low-paid, often part-time, manual labor that most frequently took place evenings), many pinsetters were teenage boys, and thus pinboy is another name used to describe the job. In 1936, Harry Franklin invented the mechanical pinsetter while with the AMF firm, which largely did away with pinsetting as a manual profession, although a small number of bowling alleys still use human pinsetters. [...] While humans usually no longer set the pins, a pinchaser, or in slang 'pin monkey', often is stationed near the equipment to ensure that it <b>is</b> <b>clean</b> <b>and</b> working properly, and to clear minor jams.|$|E

2500|$|Reading the {{injunction}} against eating pork in [...] a Midrash found {{signs of the}} duplicity of the Romans and their spiritual progenitor, Esau. Rabbi Phinehas (and other say Rabbi Helkiah) taught in Rabbi Simon's name that Moses and Asaph (author of [...] ) exposed the Romans' deception. Asaph said in [...] "The boar of the wood ravages it." [...] While Moses said in [...] "you shall not eat of [...] [...] [...] the swine, because he parts the hoof but does not chew the cud." [...] The Midrash explained that Scripture compares the Roman Empire to a swine, because when the swine lies down, it puts out its parted hoofs, as if to advertise that it <b>is</b> <b>clean.</b> <b>And</b> so the Midrash taught that the wicked Roman Empire robbed and oppressed, yet pretended to execute justice. So the Midrash taught that for 40 years, Esau would ensnare married women and violate them, yet {{when he reached the}} age of 40, he compared himself to his righteous father Isaac, telling himself that as his father Isaac was 40 years old when he married (as reported in [...] ), so he too would marry at the age of 40.|$|E

[...] Neon Limelight wrote, [...] "The upbeat song is really less about her career and more about where she is now in her life and her [...] ability to appreciate what really matters." [...] Hardeep Phull of the New York Post gave the song three stars, saying: [...] "this is the euphoric sound of her (Clarkson) looking to the future.

[...] Jocelyn Vena of MTV News also added, [...] "Kelly Clarkson is still pop's sassy [...] "Miss Independent", but these days, she's a bit more willing to ask for help. Clarkson's uplifting new single [...] "Catch My Breath" [...] not only pays homage to her strong-willed musical persona, but also to the people who have helped her grow into the woman she is today." ...|$|E
