Respective {{associates}} of each tag team, Spike Dudley for the Dudley Boyz, Rhyno for Edge and Christian, and Lita for the Hardy Boyz, interfered during the match. With Spike and Rhyno both laying on two tables outside the ring, Jeff Hardy set up a huge ladder beside them and performed a Swanton Bomb onto them through the tables. Jeff tried to unhook the belts but had the ladder beneath him pulled away by Bubba Ray Dudley, leaving him <b>hanging</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> and allowing Edge to jump off another ladder and spear Jeff to the ground. Bubba Ray and Matt Hardy climbed the same ladder but Rhyno tipped the ladder over, sending Bubba Ray and Matt through four stacked tables at ringside. With Edge holding onto D-Von's legs, Christian sat on Rhyno's shoulders and unhooked the belts, making him and Edge the new Tag Team Champions.|$|E

Certainly, in her timid yet earnest advance to friendship, it could not be denied that there was a most exquisite and fairy charm.|$|E
60|$|The {{captain was}} right. In {{less than the}} time he named, a terrific sea had got up. The Paramatta had already made more than one circuit of the compass. There was no {{regularity}} in the sea. It seemed to rise suddenly in heaps, now striking the ship on one side, now on another, and pouring sheets of water over her bulwarks. The motion of the vessel was so tremendous that even Bill Hardy and the older seamen could only move along with the greatest difficulty {{to carry out the}} orders of the captain; while Reuben clung to the shrouds, now half buried in water, now almost <b>hanging</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> with the sea racing along under his feet.|$|E

But on cross-examination their counsel would not allow them to tell whose week of power the current week was. The judge insisted upon their answering, and proposed to compel them, but even the prosecution took fright and came to the rescue then, and helped stay the sturdy jurist's revolutionary hand. So the case had to go to the jury with that important point <b>hanging</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> They were out an hour and brought in this verdict: ...|$|E

The dwarf swung loose, <b>hanging</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> but she was very light, of the weight of a five-year-old child, perhaps, no more, and Rachel was very strong. With an effort she lifted her up till the monkey-like fingers gripped the rough bark again.

60|$|It {{was strange}} indeed what {{influence}} that weird kite seemed to exercise. Even human beings {{were affected by}} it, as if both it and they were realities.

The ceiling of the dome was divided into compartments, which were covered with paintings. These paintings had become a good deal faded and decayed; and {{on one side of the}} dome, nearly two hundred feet above where the party was standing, there was a platform <b>hanging</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> with workmen and artists upon it repainting the figures.

But here, in what was thought to be the rainless Soudan, the line south of Sarras followed for mile after mile the bottom of the long valley of Khor Ahrusa, and no provision had been made, or had been thought necessary, for culverts in the embankments where minor hollows were crossed. Thus, when the flood came, it was not merely that the railway was cut through here and there by the rushing deluge.

The lecturer had not arrived. But the lady of the manor seated herself at the speaker's table, singling out Scotch wits in the audience--for whom she was more than a match--while the sculptor and I looked on and grinned and resisted her blandishments to make speeches. When at last the lecturer came he sat down informally on the table with one foot <b>hanging</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> and grinned, too, at her bantering but complimentary introduction. It was then I discovered for the first time that he was one of the best educational experts of that interesting branch of the British Government, the Department of Reconstruction, whose business it is to teach the convalescents the elements of social and political science. This was not to be a lecture, he told them, but a debate in which every man must take a part. And his first startling question was this: ...|$|E

I must hold them tight though, for I feel them sliding away, and in their stead are the Mannings, husband and wife, hanging {{on the top of}} Horse- monger Lane Jail. In connexion with which dismal spectacle, I recall this curious fantasy of the mind. That, having beheld that execution, and having left those two forms dangling {{on the top of the}} entrance gateway - the man's, a limp, loose suit of clothes as if the man had gone out of them; the woman's, a fine shape, so elaborately corseted and artfully dressed, that it was quite unchanged in its trim appearance as it slowly swung from side to side - I never could, by my uttermost efforts, for some weeks, present the outside of that prison to myself (which the terrible impression I had received continually obliged me to do) without presenting it with the two figures still <b>hanging</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning <b>air.</b> Until, strolling past the gloomy place one night, when the street was deserted and quiet, and actually seeing that the bodies were not there, my fancy was persuaded, as it were, to take them down and bury them within the precincts of the jail, where they have lain ever since.|$|R

The eye is well opened, with thick and curly lashes, but the tunica conjunctiva is rarely of a pure white; the large teeth are of good shape and colour. Extensive tattoos appear on breasts, backs, and shoulders; the wearers are generally slaves, also known by scantier clothing, by darker skins, and by a wilder expression of countenance. During their [...] "country nursing," [...] the children run about wholly nude, except the coating of red wood applied by the mothers, or the dust gathered from the ground.

[...] "Should Shop Assistants Marry?" [...] I am puzzled to think what some periods and schools of human history would have made of such a question. The ascetics of the East or of some periods of the early Church would have thought that the question meant, [...] "Are not shop assistants too saintly, too much of another world, even to feel the emotions of the sexes?" [...] But I suppose that is not what the purple poster means. In some pagan cities it might have meant, [...] "Shall slaves so vile as shop assistants even be allowed to propagate their abject race?" [...] But I suppose that is not what the purple poster meant. We must face, I fear, the full insanity of what it does mean. It does really mean that a section of the human race is asking whether the primary relations of the two human sexes are particularly good for modern shops. The human race is asking whether Adam and Eve are entirely suitable for Marshall and Snelgrove. If this is not topsy-turvy I cannot imagine what would be. We ask whether the universal institution will improve our (please God) temporary institution. Yet I have known many such questions.
