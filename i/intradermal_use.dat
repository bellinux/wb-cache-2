40|$|The {{efficiency}} of mass screenings for tuberculosis {{in children and}} adolescents was determined as a proportion of persons who were found to have tuberculosis. The diagnostic effectiveness of the skin test with recombinant tuberculosis allergen (Diaskintest) was 0. 1 %; that of traditional diagnosis using purified tuberculosis allergen in standard dilution for <b>intradermal</b> <b>use</b> (2 TU PPD-L) was 0. 003 %. With the use of a combined regimen (firstly, mass diagnosis with Mantoux test with 2 TU, then additional examination of identified risk groups with the Diaskintest), the efficiency was 0. 006 %. The authors made a cost-effectiveness analysis of the skin tests with recombinant tuberculosis allergen (Diaskintest) and purified tuberculosis allergen in standard dilution (2 TU PPD-L) used to diagnose tuberculosis infection {{in children and adolescents}}. Pharmacoeconomically, the analysis showed the advantages of the Diaskintest. The cost-effectiveness coefficient of a Diaskintest model was 178, 400 rubles; that of the combined regimen and traditional tuberculin diagnosis was 2, 573, 166 and 4, 870, 666 rubles, respectively.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Vaccination against {{hepatitis}} A virus (HAV) is unaffordable to {{many developing}} countries. Substantial reductions in cost occur when vaccines are administered intradermally at low doses. Aluminum-free HAV vaccines are considered {{more suitable for}} <b>intradermal</b> <b>use</b> than traditional vaccines which can cause long-lasting local reactions. Thus, we compared the immunogenicity and safety of an aluminum-free virosomal HAV vaccine (Epaxal) administered by different routes: intradermal (i. d.), subcutaneous (s. c.), and intramuscular (i. m.). METHODS: Two open pilot studies were conducted as sub-studies of a large lot consistency trial. Healthy subjects aged 18 to 45 were enrolled. Study 1 compared two i. d. regimens of a lower dose of Epaxal [0. 1 mL (4. 8 IU), one or two injection sites] with i. m. administration of the standard dose [0. 5 mL (24 IU) ]. Study 2 compared the s. c. with the i. m. administration of the standard dose. At month 12, subjects in study 1 received a booster dose of 0. 1 mL i. d. or 0. 5 mL i. m.; subjects in study 2 received 0. 5 mL via the respective route (s. c. or i. m.). Serum was tested for antibodies at baseline, 2 weeks (study 1), and 1 and 6 months after the primary vaccination as well as prior and 1 month after the booster dose. Incidences of solicited and unsolicited adverse events were recorded. RESULTS: Seroprotection rates (anti-HAV geometric mean concentration of > or = 20 mIU/mL) after 1 month ranged from 93. 2 % to 100 % in all groups and remained high until month 12 (range 85. 2 &- 90. 2 %). Complete (100 %) seroprotection was achieved by all subjects in all groups after booster vaccination. All routes of administration were well tolerated. Local reactions were more common in subjects vaccinated i. d. and s. c. than i. m. CONCLUSIONS: The aluminum-free virosomal HAV vaccine Epaxal is highly immunogenic and well tolerated when administered either via i. d., s. c., or i. m. Vaccination via the i. d. route may confer significant cost savings over the conventional i. m. route...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{demonstrate}} the safety of <b>using</b> <b>intradermal</b> absorbable sutures for pilonidal sinus skin closure. METHODS: The study was prospectively carried out in 203 patients randomized into two groups of patients. In the first group (103 patients), interrupted sutures were used; in the second group (100 patients), a continuous <b>intradermal</b> suture was <b>used.</b> We have analyzed the time off work, time to walk without pain, time to sit on the toilet without pain, wound infections, satisfaction rate and esthetic results. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the groups with regard to the time off work, time to walk without pain and time to sit on a toilet without pain. There was also no significant difference between the groups with regard to the wound infection rates (p = 0. 64).

Significant differences of fluorescence intensity were observed between different skin structures (P[*] [*] 0. 05). Intradermal ALA is potent. ALA concentrations ≥ 0. 25 % followed by red light exposures caused a very intense vascular PDT reaction. Moderate doses of injected ALA concentration (∼ 0. 06 %), selectively targeted EG.

Bovine TB is a major disease of cattle and has serious implications for public health and for international trade of milk, meat and live animals. Despite many efforts it still occurs in many countries. Control programmes are based on a test-and-slaughter policy and <b>use</b> <b>intradermal</b> tests as diagnostic methods. Bovine TB is a complex disease and presents many phases. Briefly, in the first stages of the disease lesions are infrequent, and a cell-mediated immune (CMI) response is predominant. With the advance of the disease, lesions become more evident and numerous, the bacillary load increases and the humoral immune response is important. For the past 10 years we have been studying naturally infected cattle in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. With the aim of determining the best diagnostic method for bovine TB (both antemortem and postmortem), we <b>used</b> <b>intradermal</b> tests (single and comparative), interferon-g assay, ELISA with crude and recombinant antigens (Ag 85, ESAT- 6, MPB 70 and MPB 83), histopathology and immunochemistry of lesions, and PCR. After many studies, we have realised that no single diagnostic test will be able to detect 100 per cent of the infected animals from a herd. Considering the evolution of the infection, the interferon-g assay and intradermal tests may detect some cows with recent infection, but not all, when the CMI is predominant. Nevertheless, for anergic cattle and those in the more advanced stages of the disease, ELISA must be considered.

After 10 minutes, the injection site is measured to look for growth of wheal, a small swelling of the skin. Two millimeters of growth in 10 minutes is considered positive. If 2 mm of growth is noted, then a second injection at a higher concentration is given to confirm the response. The end point is the concentration of antigen that causes {{an increase in the}} size of the wheal followed by confirmatory whealing. If the wheal grows larger than 13 mm, then no further injection are given since this is considered a major reaction.|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{articles}} on mesotherapy treatment with phos-phatidylcholine (PC) have been published. We hope to clarify and specify the medical applications of PC on cellulite and localized fat. Cellulite Cellulite is an incorrect term but is commonly used. Cellulite refers to fat deposits located above the fascia superficialis, {{and these are}} less accessible to techniques like liposuction. The use of soy lecithin is not indicated {{for the treatment of}} cellulite. This unaesthetic condition can be improved through mesotherapy. The most appropriate technique is repetitive <b>intradermal</b> injections <b>using</b> a single needle, a technique called nappage. Treatments should be done weekly. The average number of treatments is about 8, and the quantity of the mixture required depends on the degree of cellulite. In all cases the formation of subcutaneous nodules, which are the result of bad technique, must be avoided. Localized Fat Deposits Soy lecithin can be used for the treatment of localized fat deposits. This substance has been used in Brazil for the past 10 years. For the past 2 years soy lecithin has been quite widely used in North America. A recent article in Skin and Aging in the US reveals an extraordinary interest in North America, {{but at the same time}} criticizes the lack of evidence for the effectiveness of the technique and the large number of side effects of these in-jections. Above all, we want to warn our colleagues abou...|$|R
40|$|Smallpox vaccinations were {{performed}} in a well-vaccinated prison population by multiple-pressure technique and by <b>intradermal</b> jet injection <b>using</b> serial dilutions of vaccine. A total of 140 subjects were divided into groups, and each group was vaccinated by the multiple-pressure technique or by jet injection using 1 of 3 vaccine dilutions with the following calculated titres: ID-Jet 1 = 107. 0 TCID 50 /ml, ID-Jet 1 a = 106. 3 TCID 50 /ml, ID-Jet 2 = 106. 0 TCID 50 /ml. Clinical observations were made at intervals {{during the first week}} after vaccination. Prevaccination and post-vaccination serum samples were obtained immediately before and 30 days after the vaccination. Results based on clinical and serological evaluations indicated that smallpox vaccination by jet injection with the ID-Jet 1 vaccine was at least as efficacious as vaccination by the standard multiple-pressure technique...|$|R
40|$|The {{accessibility}} of skin {{makes it an}} ideal target organ for nucleic acid-based therapeutics; however, effective patient-friendly delivery remains a major obstacle to clinical utility. A variety of limited and inefficient methods of delivering nucleic acids to keratinocytes have been demonstrated; further advances will require well-characterized reagents, rapid noninvasive assays of delivery, and well-developed skin model systems. Using intravital fluorescence and bioluminescence imaging and a standard set of reporter plasmids we demonstrate transfection of cells in mouse and human xenograft skin <b>using</b> <b>intradermal</b> injection and two microneedle array delivery systems. Reporter gene expression could be detected in individual keratinocytes, in real-time, in both mouse skin as well as human skin xenografts. These studies revealed that non-invasive intravital imaging {{can be used as}} a guide for developing gene delivery tools, establishing a benchmark for comparative testing of nucleic acid skin delivery technologies...|$|R
40|$|Vaccines {{have to be}} {{administered}} via an appropriate route, i. e. a route, which is optimal regarding safety, immunogenicity and practicability. In addition, there are factors, such as body site, needle length, injection technique, depth of injection, type of antigen, vaccine formulation, adjuvants, age, sex, race/ethnicity, body mass, and pre-existing immunity, which {{can have an impact}} on the reactogenicity and tolerability and/or on the immunogenicity of a given vaccine. For parenteral vaccine administration there are currently three routes licensed: intramuscular, subcutaneous and <b>intradermal,</b> either by <b>using</b> conventional hypodermic needles or by using alternative or needle-free injection devices. The factors potentially impacting on the 'performance' of a given route of administration, as reported in recent literature, are outlined and discussed in view of their importance. These factors need to be accounted and controlled for when designing vaccine studies and should be reported in a transparent and standardised way in publication...|$|R

In 1943, he developed a unique technique used by the US Army to rehabilitate facial disfigurements from war injuries. According to his discharge papers, [...] "Made drawings {{in the operating room}} of surgical procedures, modeling of features for reconstructive surgery, and carving cartilage for grafting in plastic surgery, pigmentation of skin in plastic procedures. Had three assistants working under him. Served at Valley Forge General Hospital in Plastic Surgery Department."Following his service, the unique research Eliscu did on tattooing pigmentation to cover the discoloration from skin grafts and for people with port wine stains was used at the New York Hospital. Eliscu applied for a patent for the tool he developed to <b>use</b> <b>intradermal</b> injections of permanent pigments.|$|R
40|$|More than 99 % of {{all human}} rabies deaths in the world occur in {{tropical}} developing countries. In India alone, 30, 000 to 50, 000 people may die of rabies each year. The Lyssaviruses (Family Rhabdoviridae) include rabies and rabies-related viruses, 3 of which have caused human disease. Rabies is a zoonosis, principally affecting domestic and stray dogs {{in most parts of}} Africa, Asia and Latin America. In North America, southern Africa, parts of the Caribbean and Europe, the principal mammalian reservoir species are wild carnivores. The pathogenesis, clinical features and differential diagnosis of rabies are discussed. The planning of rabies control strategies requires background information on the distribution and incidence of rabies in animals and the species involved. In some parts of the world, such as Latin American cities, most domestic dogs, even apparent strays, have an owner and can be immunized with conventional canine vaccines during well publicized campaigns. However, in areas such as India, where there may be a high proportion of stray domestic dogs without owners, and in those areas where wild mammals are the principal reservoir species, immunization may be possible using live attenuated or recombinant oral vaccines distributed in baits. In the poor tropical developing countries, unsatisfactory nervous tissue vaccines are still widely used. However, economical multisite <b>intradermal</b> regimens <b>using</b> tissue culture vaccines have proved effective and have begun to replace nervous tissue vaccines in some countries...|$|R
