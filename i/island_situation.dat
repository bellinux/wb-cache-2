40|$|Land {{reclamation}} {{in coastal}} areas {{may have a}} significant effect on local ground water systems. Steady-state analytic solutions based on Dupuit and Ghyben-Herzberg assumptions are derived to evaluate this effect. Two situations are considered, both with ground water flow resulting from precipitation recharge: the coastal aquifer of an extensive landmass and an island. The results show that after reclamation, the water table rises and the salt water-fresh water interface moves seaward. The degree of these changes depends on the extent of reclamation and the hydraulic conductivity of the fill material. For the <b>island</b> <b>situation,</b> the reclamation displaces the ground water divide and changes the ground water conditions in the entire island. An unintended advantage of the reclamation is an increase of fresh ground water resource because the reclaimed land can be an additional aquifer and rain recharge takes place over a larger area. © 2007 National Ground Water Association. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been a growing {{interest}} in incorporating microgrids in electrical power networks. This is due to various advantages they present, particularly the possibility of working in either autonomous mode or grid connected, which makes them highly versatile structures for incorporating intermittent generation and energy storage. However, they pose safety issues in being able to support a local island in case of utility disconnection. Thus, {{in the event of an}} unintentional <b>island</b> <b>situation,</b> they should be able to detect the loss of mains and disconnect for self-protection and safety reasons. Most of the anti-islanding schemes are implemented within control of single generation devices, such as dc-ac inverters used with solar electric systems being incompatible with the concept of microgrids due to the variety and multiplicity of sources within the microgrid. In this paper, a passive islanding detection method based on the change of the 5 th harmonic voltage magnitude at the point of common coupling between grid-connected and islanded modes of operation is presented. Hardware test results from the application of this approach to a laboratory scale microgrid are shown. The experimental results demonstrate the validity of the proposed method, in meeting the requirements of IEEE 1547 standards.

40|$|Placenames or toponyms have {{traditionally}} been of interest to history and philology but not linguistics. In toponymy there is a deficit of theory and methods which consider a linguistic analysis of toponym structure in parallel with a detailed cultural analysis of the socio-historical significance of toponyms and processes of toponymy. Documenting patterns of pristine toponymy, or toponymic knowledge in locations where people remember the locations and histories of people and events associated with extant placenames, seems a worthwhile endeavour in linguistically pristine island environments, i. e. islands that were uninhabited prior to colonisation. Conducting an empirical pristine toponymic study in isolated, small island situations, that have witnessed recent human habitation, involves analysing convenient and confined parameters. In order to test the utility of pristine toponymy as a conceptual tool to observe relationships between toponyms as linguistic and cultural artefacts and their connection to specific pristine socio-historical and natural island ecologies, this study used the toponymy of Norfolk Island, South Pacific as a main study and compared it to the toponymy of Dudley Peninsula, Kangaroo Island, South Australia. Applying linguistic and cultural levels of analysis, the official and unofficial toponymy of Norfolk Island was compared to the unofficial toponymy of Dudley Peninsula. The principal research question for the study sought to establish whether the difference between official and unofficial toponyms and processes of toponymy in the two island environments was {{a consequence of the}} degree of linguistic, cultural and ecological embeddedness of these toponyms and toponymic processes. Norfolk Island (35 km²), 1700 kilometres east of Sydney, is an external territory of Australia. The linguistic situation on Norfolk is diglossic: English and Norf‘k, the language of the descendants of the Bounty mutineers, are spoken. Both languages are present in the contemporary toponymic landscape on the island. Norfolk is a political and cultural anomaly in Australia and its anomalous nature is depicted in the unclear boundaries not only of its human history but also in the blurring of boundaries in its toponymic history as a result of distinct and changing patterns of land use and differing linguistic and toponymic perceptions of the same geographical space. The presence of the Melanesian Mission on Norfolk Island from 1867 to 1920 and patterns of modern toponymy after the construction of the Norfolk Island airport in 1942 have had a marked effect on the history of Norfolk toponymy. Dudley Peninsula (650 km²), the eastern peninsula on Kangaroo Island, is less remote and less politically and culturally anomalous than Norfolk. Dudley Peninsula was selected as an island comparative study to contrast principles of unofficial toponymy with unofficial Norfolk Island toponymy. Employing a comparative method also made it possible to ascertain {{the extent to which a}} nexus and theory of pristine toponyms, transparent versus opaque toponymic histories and the official versus unofficial status of toponyms is practical across two island toponymic case studies. The study employed an ecolinguistic fieldwork methodology to gain large amounts of primary data. A taxonomy of four data sets was employed. These were topographical names, house names, road names and fishing ground names. The primary Norfolk data were coupled with secondary archival data (n = 1068) and analysed using general grammatical analyses, tagmemic analysis of Norf‘k toponyms, spatial orientation analysis, analysis of official and unofficial toponyms and cultural analysis. The unofficial Dudley Peninsula data (n = 254) of topographical names and fishing ground names were analysed using general grammatical analysis and cultural analysis. A microtoponymic case study for each <b>island</b> <b>situation</b> was also presented and subsequently compared. The results of this study revealed that the differences between official and unofficial toponyms can be accounted for by the establishment of a typology involving four toponym categories: (1) common colonial forms, (2) official and unofficial descriptive toponyms, (3) unofficial names commemorating local people, and (4) unofficial and esoteric names commemorating local events and people. While these categories appear mutually exclusive and distinct, the blurring of boundaries between the effectiveness of these categories was extensive in Norfolk Island toponymy. The linguistic structure of unofficial Dudley Peninsula toponyms, while still governed by their cultural and ecological placement and existence, did not exhibit the same degree of boundary blurring and esoteric and insider identity compared to Norfolk Island toponyms. It was claimed these differences in the linguistic, socio-cultural and ecological history in the two island environments were due to there being more political pressures for the Norfolk Island population on Norfolk Island to express their cultural allegiances to England and Tahiti through toponymy rather than through any marked connection to Australia as compared to Dudley Peninsula‘s clear political and social connection to (South) Australia. The overall results suggested a broad continuum within and between ‘conscious toponymic wisdom‘ and ‘unconscious toponymic wisdom‘, which is realised differently in the two locations with a tendency for more ‘conscious toponymic wisdom‘ within Norfolk Island‘s toponymic ethos as compared to Dudley Peninsula‘s more ‘unconscious toponymic wisdom‘. It was argued that ecolinguistic fieldwork, which makes informants aware of the importance of their intricate knowledge of their local toponymy, is a productive means to foreground the significance of local, unofficial and esoteric toponymic knowledge by working with informants. In conclusion, this thesis argued that the concept of insular toponymies, i. e. undertaking an analysis of toponyms based predominantly in the documentation and analysis of primary toponymic field data, was appropriate to describe the nature of toponymy in isolated and insular island societies. As a part of documenting the history of the Norf‘k language, the importance of Norf‘k toponyms to language contact studies, the role of islands to toponymic theory and the application of toponymy to island studies, this study used the term toponymic ethnography as a worthwhile concept within the parameters of this research and is arguably of benefit for future toponymic and cultural analyses.

40|$|Placing DG {{closer to}} the load in the system can improve the grid {{reliability}} and power quality, however {{it can lead to}} some technical issues such as islanding which requires attention from utility and Independent Power Producer (IPP). One of the important issues in power system distribution is islanding detection for protecting the DG when islanding operation occurred. The detection technique is employed so that the islanding event can be detected within the time frame. The main reason of detecting <b>islanding</b> <b>situation</b> at distribution level is to monitor the DG output or system parameters thus can determine the occurrence of <b>islanding</b> <b>situation</b> from the change of these parameters. Therefore, this paper presents the performance of multiple parameters of passive islanding detection technique in distribution system connected with synchronous type of DG. Sixteen passive parameters including rate of change of frequency (df/dt), rate of change of voltage (dv/dt), rate of change of active power (dp/dt), and rate of change of reactive power (dq/dt) are evaluated. The sensitivity analysis of these parameters are determined via simulation in terms of variation of loads, fault events and load switching on various events that are islanding and non-islanding events. The analysis indicates that each parameter displays a different pattern of sensitivity towards islanding event...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Intentional {{islanding}} {{describes the}} {{condition in which}} a microgrid or {{a portion of the}} power grid, which consists of a load and a distributed generation (DG) system, is isolated from the remainder of the utility system. Under normal operation, each DG inverter system in the microgrid usually works in constant current control mode. When the microgrid is cut off from the main grid, each DG inverter system must detect this <b>islanding</b> <b>situation</b> and must switch to a voltage control mode. In this mode, the microgrid will provide a constant voltage to the local load. This paper describes a control strategy that is used to implement grid-connected and intentional-islanding operation of distributed power generation.
