40|$|In this study, I {{propose a}} {{systematic}} method of detecting aircraft deviation due to {{air traffic controller}} (ATC) intervention. The aircraft deviations associated with ATC interventions are detected using a heuristic algorithm developed from analyzing the actual positions of an aircraft to its filed flight plan when the aircraft trajectories were identified as having an encounter in a loss-of-separation incident. An actual (closed-loop) flight trajectory of the Cleveland Air Route Traffic Control Center (ZOB ARTCC) was collected from the FlightAware database. This was compared with the corresponding planned (open-loop) trajectory dataset generated by the Microsoft© Flight Simulator X (FSX). I implemented a conflict-detection algorithm in Matlab to identify open-loop flight trajectories that encounters in loss-of-separation. I analyzed {{the differences between the}} closed-loop and open-loop flight trajectories of aircrafts that were identified to have encounters in loss of separation. The analysis identified operationally significant deviations in the closed-loop trajectory data with respect to the horizontal paths of the aircrafts. I then developed and validated a heuristic algorithm, the ATC intervention detection algorithm, based on the findings from the analysis. When used with a test dataset to validate the algorithm, it achieved an 85. 7 % detection rate in detecting horizontal deviations made by the ATC in resolving identified conflicts, and a false-alarm rate of 68 %. In addition to the ATC intervention detection algorithm, I present in this paper an analysis of <b>deviated</b> <b>flight</b> trajectories in an effort to display how the presented methodology can be utilized to provide insight into air traffic controller resolution strategies. ...|$|E

50|$|SHK {{concluded}} that the incident took place because the Gripen pilot inadvertently went below his assigned flight level and {{ended up on the}} same flight level at the passenger aircraft. SHK placed the root cause of this with the lack of adequate routines in the Swedish Air Force for receiving and reading back instructions from air traffic control. A contributary cause of the incident was said to be a lack of support systems in the Gripen to help the pilot with the aforementioned task. Such a system is currently being introduced in the Swedish Air Force Gripens. The system will alert the pilot if the <b>flight</b> <b>deviates</b> from the assigned flight level.|$|R

50|$|To {{understand}} {{the discipline of}} handling qualities, the concept of stability should be understood. Stability can be defined only when the vehicle is in trim; that is, there are no unbalanced forces or moments acting on the vehicle to cause it to <b>deviate</b> from steady <b>flight.</b> If this condition exists, and if the vehicle is disturbed, stability refers to the tendency of the vehicle {{to return to the}} trimmed condition. If the vehicle initially tends to return to a trimmed condition, it is said to be statically stable. If it continues to approach the trimmed condition without overshooting, the motion is called a subsidence. If the motion causes the vehicle to overshoot the trimmed condition, it may oscillate back and forth. If this oscillation damps out, the motion is called a damped oscillation and the vehicle is said to be dynamically stable. On the other hand, if the motion increases in amplitude, the vehicle is said to be dynamically unstable.|$|R
5000|$|During the flight, the {{co-pilot}} {{acted as}} the Pilot Flying {{and the captain}} as Pilot Monitoring. En route, the <b>flight</b> <b>deviated</b> {{to the left and}} climbed to 12000 ft to avoid clouds. Over the Ghorepani area, the Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) began to sound. The aircraft was flying through clouds with a little visibility between clouds. A descent to 10000 ft was initiated and at 10200 ft the GPWS sounded again, but the captain responded not to worry about it. The captain was accustomed to hearing GPWS warnings in normal flight, so it became a habit to disregard the warnings. About one minute before the accident the captain took over control and initiated a climb. The aircraft impacted a mountainside at 10700 ft and came to a rest at 10982 ft near Dana village, Myagdi district. Aviation Safety Network gives the probable cause as a loss of situational awareness when entering clouds while flying under Visual Flight Rules (VFR).|$|R
50|$|Preliminary {{investigation}} {{found that the}} Progress had separated from the third stage six minutes and 23 seconds into launch, and that third stage telemetry failed. The reason for the premature separation was unclear. Although the Blok I computer system was capable of issuing a manual shutoff command {{in the event of}} a malfunction, this could only occur if engine chamber pressure dropped below a certain level or the booster began <b>deviating</b> from its <b>flight</b> path and telemetry data up to the point of the malfunction indicated normal third stage performance. Sensing normal separation, the Progress began deploying its antennas and preparing to fire its propulsion system, but the Blok I was still thrusting and apparently collided with the spacecraft at least twice, sending it into a tailspin and possibly rupturing the instrument module. As evidence of this, the Progress began activating its thermal control system in response to loss of instrument module compartment temperatures. It was suspected that the loss of Blok I telemetry could have been caused by the collision with the Progress, which may have damaged antennas on the booster.|$|R
5000|$|An {{accidental}} pad {{firing of}} a launch escape system {{occurred during the}} attempted launch of the unmanned Soyuz 7K-OK No.1 spacecraft on December 14, 1966. The vehicle's strap-on boosters did not ignite, preventing the rocket from leaving the pad. About 30 minutes later, while the vehicle was being secured, the LES engine fired. Separation charges started {{a fire in the}} rocket's third stage, leading to an explosion that killed multiple pad workers. During the attempted launch, the booster switched from external to internal power as it normally would do, which then activated the abort sensing system. Originally it was thought that the LES firing was triggered by a gantry arm that tilted the rocket past 7 degrees, meeting one of the defined in-flight abort conditions. However, a more thorough investigation found a different cause: the Earth's rotation caused the rate gyros to register an approximately 8° tilt, which the abort sensing system interpreted as the booster <b>deviating</b> from its <b>flight</b> path. The system was subsequently redesigned to prevent recurrence of this unanticipated error.|$|R
5000|$|Mace MGM-13A was {{launched}} from a translauncher (transporter erector launcher) and the MGM-13B {{was launched}} from a hardened underground bunker using a solid rocket booster for initial acceleration and an Allison J33-A-41 turbojet for cruise flight.

In August 1952, Air Materiel Command initiated the mating of the Goodyear ATRAN with the MGM-1 Matador. This mating resulted in a production contract in June 1954. The ATRAN guidance system was difficult to jam and was not range-limited by line-of sight as in the older Matador radar command and control system, but its range was restricted by the availability of radar maps. In time, it became possible to construct radar maps from topographic maps.|$|R
5000|$|On February 1, 2013, an Intelsat {{satellite}} {{launched from}} the Sea Launch Odyssey platform in the equatorial Pacific. The nighttime launch performed nominally for about 20 seconds {{when the first}} stage abruptly lost thrust. Approximately 40 seconds after liftoff, all telemetry data ceased. Subsequent investigation showed that the Zenit had begun <b>deviating</b> from its <b>flight</b> path when the pitch and roll maneuver started. The onboard computer sensed an abnormal situation and sent an automatic shutdown command to the first stage at T+23 seconds, and impact with the ocean occurred about one minute after liftoff. Ultimately, the failure was traced to a defective hydraulic pump that controlled gimbaling of the first stage engines. This resulted in the booster starting an uncontrolled rolling motion which caused the computer system to terminate all thrust. Although anomalous conditions began around T+11 seconds, the Zenit's flight computer was [...] "locked" [...] to prevent engine shutdown until at least 20 seconds after liftoff so the booster would not come down {{on or near the}} launch complex. Impact occurred about two miles downrange, but attempts to recover booster debris were unsuccessful.|$|R
2500|$|The newer {{information}} {{is supported by}} the fate of 63-13287. On 14 December 1965, operating TDY from Incirlik Air Base in Turkey as [...] "Big Rib 06", it disappeared during a mission over the Black Sea whose route passed through telemetry range for Soviet ICBMs. What actually happened is still uncertain. There was speculation that the aircraft had been shot down by a Soviet S-75 Dvina (NATO designation [...] "SA-2 Guideline") surface-to-air missile, but the official statement by the USAF was that the aircraft was on its third pass along its route when it <b>deviated</b> from its <b>flight</b> plan, orbiting and spiraling down to below minimum radar tracking altitude, indicating that the aircraft crew had probably perished from an oxygen system failure. Although searches for the wreckage continued until 28 December, only small bits and pieces of it were recovered, although unsubstantiated reports asserted that the two crew members had been captured alive by the Soviets. However one of the recovered pieces was an inner wing panel that a team of structural experts concluded was struck by an object, likely a missile. The crew was declared dead after being missing for six months. The Soviets used the incident to argue successfully against U.S. intelligence-gathering missions originating from Turkish air bases.|$|R
50|$|Since {{tracking}} cameras around LC-31 {{had been}} turned off when the launch aborted, there was no film footage of the fire or explosion for analysis, but telemetry data found that the igniter in the Blok D strap-on had failed to activate. This was a minor problem and could have been easily fixed by simply installing a new igniter. The bigger question was why the LES activated. Initially, it was suspected that the booster had been bumped when the gantry tower was put back in place following the abort and that this somehow managed to trigger the LES, but a more thorough investigation found a different cause. During the attempted launch, the booster switched from external to internal power as it normally would do, which then activated the abort sensing system. The Earth's rotation caused the rate gyros to register an approximately 8° tilt 30 minutes after the aborted liftoff, which the abort sensing system then interpreted as meaning that the booster had <b>deviated</b> from its <b>flight</b> path, and thus it activated the LES. The abort sensing system in the Soyuz was thus redesigned to prevent a recurrence of this unanticipated design flaw. On the other hand, the LES had also worked flawlessly and demonstrated its ability to safely pull cosmonauts from the booster should an emergency arise (as it did years later in the Soyuz T-10-1 abort).|$|R
25|$|At Lindbergh's request, {{the large}} main and forward fuel tanks {{were placed in}} the forward section of the fuselage, in front of the pilot, with the oil tank acting as a firewall. This {{arrangement}} improved the center of gravity and reduced the risk of the pilot being crushed to death between the main tank and the engine {{in the event of a}} crash. This design decision meant that there could be no front windshield, and that forward visibility would be limited to the side windows. This did not concern Lindbergh as he was used to flying in the rear cockpit of mail planes with mail bags in the front. When he wanted to see forward, he would slightly yaw the aircraft and look out the side. To provide some forward vision as a precaution against hitting ship masts, trees, or structures while flying at low altitude, a Ryan employee who had served in the submarine service installed a periscope which Lindbergh helped design. It is unclear whether the periscope was used during the flight. The instrument panel housed fuel pressure, oil pressure and temperature gauges, a clock, altimeter, tachometer, airspeed indicator, bank and turn indicator, and a liquid magnetic compass. The main compass was mounted behind Lindbergh in the cockpit, and he read it using the mirror from a women's makeup case which was mounted to the ceiling using chewing gum. Lindbergh also installed a newly developed Earth Inductor Compass made by the Pioneer Instrument Company which allowed him to more accurately navigate while taking account of the magnetic declination of the earth. Lindbergh's ultimate arrival in Ireland <b>deviated</b> from his <b>flight</b> plan by just a few miles.|$|R
50|$|Due to bad weather, Nizhneangarsk Airport closed, and {{the crew}} rerouted the {{aircraft}} to land at an airfield in nearby Ust-Barguzin. Mountains surrounding Lake Baikal were at that time obscured by the cloud cover, and visibility was only about 5 km with rain and winds of up to 5 m/s. Foggy conditions and low visibility were likewise reported on Holy Nose Peninsula, what would later become the aircraft's crash site. At 10:30 MSK, almost an hour after takeoff, the crew reported a nearby flight, and at 10:41 began communications with the air tower at Ulan-Barguzin in preparation for landing. Conditions around the Ust-Barguzin airfield were slightly more favorable than had been projected at the aircraft's height. At 11:02 the aircraft called in to report their location, but in violation of air rules, the crew instead called the air control tower at Ulan-Ude and did not report back to Ust-Barguzin. Additionally, they did not report their location or weather conditions. The aircraft's data finder, ARP-6, {{was found to be}} unstable, about which the Ust-Barguzin air tower warned Flight 498 well in advance. Due to the faulty equipment, the <b>flight</b> <b>deviated</b> to the right from its course about 32 km. At 11:16, the aircraft descended from a height of 3600 m to 2700 m. Shortly before the crash, the flight crew intentionally misinformed the flight deck that the airfield was in sight, and the air tower gave them visual instructions on landing; the crew accepted these instructions at 11:21, without actually being in sight of the air field. The pilot then mistook the Holy Nose Peninsula for the location of the air field.|$|R
40|$|Capsule Little Ringed Plovers {{breeding}} in South Sweden migrate {{towards the}} southeast in the autumn, via the Middle East, to winter in Saharan and sub-Saharan locations or in India, while the spring migration is more directly towards the north. Aims To study the migration routes and wintering area of Little Ringed Plovers (Charadrius dubius) breeding in South Sweden, and {{to investigate the}} migration strategy and speed for this little studied shorebird. Methods We use light-level geolocators to track the year-round movements of Little Ringed Plovers breeding in South Sweden. Results Autumn migration proceeded towards the southeast, in three birds via lengthy stopovers in the Middle East, followed by movements towards the west and southwest to final winter destinations in Africa, while one male made a long stopover in northwestern Iran before migrating to India. The birds wintering in Africa probably stayed at freshwater locations in the Sahara or just south or north of the Sahara. Spring migration was more directly back to the breeding area. Overall migration speeds were similar during autumn and spring migration at about 189 and 209 km/day, respectively. The migration was carried out mainly as many short flights between stopovers. In particular, autumn migration was longer than the direct distance between breeding and wintering sites. Conclusions This study shows that the geolocator method can successfully be used with relatively small (40 g) shorebirds. We found that a local population of Little Ringed Plover may have widely differing wintering sites (low connectivity), from sub-Saharan Africa to the Indian subcontinent. The migration strategy of the Little Ringed Plover, with multiple short <b>flights,</b> <b>deviates</b> from that of many other long-distance migrating shorebirds that, instead, make {{one or a few}} long flights...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} traffic {{forecasts}} of Airspace Users for Air Navigation Service Providers. Currently {{there is a}} high amount of uncertainty in the traffic forecast. Air Traffic Flow Managers anticipate for unforeseen traffic by increasing the forecasted maximum capacity threshold by more than 10 %. The European ATM research program SESAR aims ultimately to reduce the difference between the forecast and real maximum capacity threshold by less than 3 %. Prediction uncertainty results in sector over-load and sub-optimal traffic flow in the air transportation system. The objective of this thesis is to investigate sector demand predictability by quantification of the difference between real and forecast traffic, and evaluate the predictability improvement by improvement of departure time predictions. Statistical analysis is performed by plotting time & count uncertainty against look-ahead time to sector entry. On a busy day, for a look-ahead time of 2 hours and longer, flights have a higher probability to be delayed than to be earlier as planned. A comparison is made between the forecast and real number of flights entering a sector for a given time of day window. Looking at the forecast time period, {{it can be seen that}} some forecasted flights did not enter in the window anymore (out), and some additional flights entered in the window that were initially not forecasted (in). `In' and `out' flights can be explained due to flights being earlier or delayed, or <b>flights</b> <b>deviating</b> from the planned route. Looking at 10 minutes before entry, about 30 % to 40 % are in/out flights, which is a large amount. In general, for a look-ahead of 0 to 3 hours, there are more `out' than `in' flights resulting in an over-prediction. Over-prediction means that there are more flights anticipated than really entered for a given time window. In order to reduce over-prediction, it is suggested, taking safety into account, to reduce the number of `out' <b>flights</b> that <b>deviate</b> from the planned route. For a high capacity Maastricht Upper Area Control sector on a normal day, a 5 % decrease of these `out' flights, reduces the over-prediction by 10 %. Furthermore, flight phases that are major causes of uncertainty are descent, taxi and the slot allocation process. A departure time prediction improvement of 50 % results in 20 % arrival time error reduction, and 30 % mean sector entry time error reduction, for a 6 hour look-ahead time. The used sensitivity method does not yield realistic sector occupancy count because the effect of changed ATC procedures due to improved predictability is not incorporated.
