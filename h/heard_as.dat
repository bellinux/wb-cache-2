5|$|Hearing aids or {{cochlear}} implants {{may be used}} if {{the hearing}} loss is severe or prolonged. Hearing aids work by amplifying {{the sound of the}} local environment and are best suited to conductive hearing loss. Cochlear implants transmit the sound that is <b>heard</b> <b>as</b> if it were a nervous signal, bypassing the cochlea.|$|E
5|$|In harmony it {{is often}} better {{for the sake of}} {{consistency}} to maintain a whole succession of clusters, once they are begun; since one alone, or even two, may be <b>heard</b> <b>as</b> a mere effect, rather than as an independent and significant procedure, carried with musical logic to its inevitable conclusion.|$|E

5|$|Since {{this case}} {{challenged}} {{the authority of}} the federal courts to try Indian-on-Indian crime, this case was <b>heard</b> <b>as</b> an interlocutory appeal, meaning that the Supreme Court would have to decide the constitutionality of the claimed jurisdiction before Kagama could be tried for the killing of Iyouse in federal court.|$|E
5|$|At about 3:30 or 4:00 a.m., roughly {{five minutes}} after Engine Co. 22 evacuated, the {{building}} exploded. The explosion flattened six to eight buildings, blew in the fronts of the opposite houses on Broad Street, and wrenched shutters and doors from buildings at {{some distance from the}} immediate area. It propelled bricks and other missiles through the air, threw many people down who had gone as far as Beaver Street, and spread the fire far and wide so that the whole neighborhood was set ablaze. The explosion shattered windows a mile away and was <b>heard</b> <b>as</b> far away as Sandy Hook, New Jersey.|$|E
5000|$|Nicholas Lemann, {{writing in}} New Yorker {{magazine}} in 2015, wrote that George W. Bush's [...] "description of himself, in the 2000 campaign, as a 'compassionate conservative' was brilliantly vague - liberals <b>heard</b> it <b>as</b> 'I'm {{not all that}} conservative,' and conservatives <b>heard</b> it <b>as</b> 'I'm deeply religious.' It was about him as a person, not a program." ...|$|R

5|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{visit the}} Area 51 {{installation}} in Nevada {{after receiving a}} tip from an inside source concerning alien spacecraft. As they drive on the highway, the agents are surrounded by Jeeps carrying soldiers led by a Man in Black named Morris Fletcher (Michael McKean). A rumbling noise is <b>heard</b> <b>as</b> a mysterious craft flies overhead and a bright light from the object passes over them. Mulder and Fletcher find that their minds have been swapped into each other's bodies, but nobody else present is aware of this. Fletcher and Scully depart, watched by the soldiers.|$|E
5|$|In most Western music, tone {{clusters}} {{tend to be}} <b>heard</b> <b>as</b> dissonant. Clusters may {{be performed}} with almost any individual instrument on which three or more notes can be played simultaneously, {{as well as by}} most groups of instruments or voices. Keyboard instruments are particularly suited to the performance of tone clusters because it is relatively easy to play multiple notes in unison on them.|$|E
5|$|On 14 February 2014, major {{tourist attractions}} in Yogyakarta and Central Java, {{including}} Borobudur, Prambanan and Ratu Boko, were closed to visitors, after being severely {{affected by the}} volcanic ash from the eruption of Kelud volcano in East Java, located around 200 kilometers east from Yogyakarta. Workers covered the iconic stupas and statues of Borobudur temple to protect the structure from volcanic ash. The Kelud volcano erupted on 13 February 2014 with an explosion <b>heard</b> <b>as</b> far away as Yogyakarta.|$|E

Author William Berger was <b>heard</b> occasionally <b>as</b> a commentator along with Juntwait.|$|R

5|$|On {{the west}} coast of Scotland, the Cailleach ushers in winter by washing her great plaid (Gaelic: féileadh mòr) in the Gulf of Corryvreckan (Gaelic: Coire Bhreacain - 'cauldron of the plaid'). This process is said to take three days, during which the roar of the coming tempest is <b>heard</b> <b>as</b> far away as twenty miles (32km) inland. When she is finished, her plaid is pure white and snow covers the land.|$|E
5|$|Japanese temple bells are struck {{externally}} {{with either}} a hammer or a suspended beam rather than with an internal clapper. The sound of the bell {{is made up of}} three parts. First is the atari, the impact of the strike. A well-made bell should produce a clean, clear tone. The initial sound of the strike is immediately followed by the prolonged oshi, the reverberation that continues to sound after the bell is struck. This is higher in pitch and is a low rumble with a sorrowful air, rich in harmonics; it lasts for up to ten seconds. Finally comes the okuri or decay, the resonance that is <b>heard</b> <b>as</b> the vibration of the bell dies away, which can last up to a minute. There are also continuous harmonic overtones heard throughout the tolling of the bell. These multiple tones create a complex pitch profile.|$|E
5|$|However, {{at least}} in the UK, there are signs that the courts may be moving towards showing more {{flexibility}} in granting advisory declarations. In R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Salem (1999), Salem, a citizen of Libya, was granted temporary admission to the UK to pursue an asylum claim. One month later, the Home Office recorded in an internal file that Salem's asylum claim had been refused, but did not communicate the decision to him. Salem only found out when his income support ceased, and the Benefits Agency told him that they had been informed that he had been refused asylum. Subsequently, Salem unsuccessfully sought leave to apply for judicial review of the Home Secretary's decision to notify the Department of Social Security that his asylum claim had been rejected. He then obtained leave to appeal the matter to the House of Lords, but was then granted refugee status. Before the House of Lords, Salem argued that his appeal should still be <b>heard</b> <b>as</b> the question of law in his case was one of general public importance. The court held that it had discretion to hear an appeal which concerns an issue involving a public authority as to a question of public law, even where {{there is no longer any}} live issue which would affect the rights and duties of the parties themselves. However, the court cautioned that this discretion has to be exercised with circumspection and entertained only where there was a good public interest reason to do so. It is not yet known whether the Singapore High Court will adopt a similar approach.|$|E
