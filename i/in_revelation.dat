5|$|For Myst III: Exile and Myst IV: Revelation, {{composer}} Jack Wall {{created the}} music, developing {{a more active}} musical style different from Miller's ambient themes. Wall looked at the increasing complexity of games {{as an opportunity to}} give players a soundtrack with as much force as a movie score, and tried to create a distinctive sound that was still recognizable as Myst music. <b>In</b> <b>Revelation,</b> Wall adapted the themes for the recurring characters of Myst, and collaborated with Peter Gabriel, who provided a song to the game as well as voicework.|$|E
5|$|The Dalek {{ability to}} fly or hover {{dates back to}} The Chase, where a Dalek was implied to have taken flight, while <b>in</b> <b>Revelation</b> of the Daleks, a Dalek hovered to exterminate two victims. The {{first part of the}} 1988 serial Remembrance of the Daleks shows a Dalek who was clearly seen to hover up a flight of stairs to the Doctor's horror. Rose and Adam allude to a long-held fan joke about the Daleks' {{inability}} to climb stairs, and are horrified when it does so.|$|E

The gameplay, which revolves around tactical movement of units across a grid-based battlefield, shares many mechanics with previous Fire Emblem games, although some elements are unique to each scenario.|$|E

5|$|Yeesha is {{the only}} {{daughter}} of Atrus and Catherine. She is briefly mentioned in the novel Myst: The Book of D'ni, and is first seen as an infant in Exile. Yeesha is seen by her parents as a correction to the mistakes they made with their wayward sons. Her parents teach her D'ni and the Art. <b>In</b> <b>Revelation,</b> her brother Sirrus attempts to use Yeesha in a plan to learn the Art and kill his parents, but Yeesha is freed by the Stranger and Achenar.|$|E
5|$|End of Ages {{takes place}} in the present day, {{sometime}} after the events of , and begins as the player responds to a letter from Atrus. Atrus is a writer of special volumes called linking books, which serve as portals or links to worlds known as Ages. A linking book to the Age of Myst, the setting of the original game, lies sealed in the ruins of the ancient D'ni civilization. The D'ni had the ability to craft linking books, but their society crumbled from within; Atrus and his family have been trying to restore the D'ni people and created an Age for the survivors to live on, known as Releeshahn (introduced in Exile). Atrus by this period is an old man, mourning the deaths of his sons Sirrus and Achenar <b>in</b> <b>Revelation,</b> and the death of his wife Catherine in the period after. In his letter, Atrus expresses concern that his daughter, Yeesha, may be lost as well.|$|E
5|$|The Bereans {{were formed}} by John Barclay in Edinburgh in 1773. Barclay {{was one of}} the most {{prominent}} followers of moral philosopher Archibald Campbell and espoused a rigorous form of pre-destination and insisted on Biblical-based preaching. Having been rejected from various pastorships and by the General Assembly, he founded independent churches in Scotland and then in England, taking the name Bereans from the people mentioned in Acts 17:11. After Barclay's death in 1798 his followers joined the congregationalists. The Buchanites were a Millenarian cult that broke away from the Relief Church when Hugh White, minister at Irvine, declared Elspeth Buchan to be a special saint identified with the woman described <b>in</b> <b>Revelation</b> 12. They attracted less than fifty followers and having been expelled by local magistrates they formed a community at a farm known as New Cample in Nithsdale, Dumfriesshire. The sect collapsed after the death of Buchan in 1791. Other minor sects include the McMillanites, reported as a group of Covernanters who had separated from kirk discipline in Dumfrisshire in 1721. Another group in the same area, called the Hebronites, were alleged to have sworn at a minister. The Hebronites were later absorbed into the Secession Church with other Covenanters after 1736.|$|E

5|$|The {{gameplay}} was {{refined and}} expanded from the version they used in Awakening. The My Castle feature was suggested by Maeda {{as an alternative}} activity for players, {{and to provide a}} means for getting to know the main characters outside battle. The amount of content included in the feature made some staff comment that it could be its own game. The social elements of My Castle were originally going to be exclusive to StreetPass, but it was suggested that players in areas with low StreetPass activity should be able to access the functions through a normal Internet connection. Some ideas thought up by Maeda for earlier titles, such as the Dragon Vein ability and the way skills were inherited by second generation characters, were also implemented. Due to the necessity for multiple versions, map designing became a larger task than anticipated, with very few maps being shared between versions. The Phoenix Mode was included to bring new fans into the series, a philosophy that they had neglected up until Awakening and improved for Fates. For {{the first time in the}} Fire Emblem series, the option for the main character to marry a character of the same sex was included: the potential male and female partners respectively appear in Conquest and Birthright, and both appear <b>in</b> <b>Revelation.</b> According to Nintendo, this move was done to reflect the diversity of their player base.|$|E

25|$|One theory, Revelation Draft Hypothesis, {{sees the}} book of Revelation {{constructed}} by forming parallels with several texts in the Old Testament such as Ezekiel, Isaiah, Zechariah, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Exodus, and Daniel. For example, Ezekiel's encounter with God is in reverse order as John's encounter with God (Ezek 1:5-28; Rev 4:2-7; note both accounts have beings with faces of a lion, ox or calf, man, and eagle (Ezek 1:10; Rev 4:7), both accounts have an expanse before the throne (Ezek 1:22; Rev 4:6). The chariot's horses in Zechariah's are the same colors as the four horses <b>in</b> <b>Revelation</b> (Zech 6:1-8; Rev 6:1-8). The nesting of the seven marches around Jericho by Joshua is reenacted by Jesus nesting the seven trumpets within the seventh seal (Josh 6:8-10; Rev 6:1-17; 8:1-9:21; 11:15-19). The description of the beast <b>in</b> <b>Revelation</b> is taken directly out of Daniel (see Dan 7:2-8; Rev 13:1-7). The method that John used allowed him to use the Hebrew Scriptures as the source and also use basic techniques of parallel formation, thereby alluding to the Hebrew Scriptures.|$|E
25|$|The first {{mention of}} the two names occurs in the Book of Ezekiel, where Gog is an {{individual}} and Magog is his land; in Genesis 10 Magog is a person, son of Japheth son of Noah, but no Gog is mentioned. <b>In</b> <b>Revelation,</b> Gog and Magog together are the hostile nations of the world. Gog or Goug the Reubenite occurs in 1 Chronicles 5:4, but {{he appears to have}} no connection with the Gog of Ezekiel or Magog of Genesis.|$|E
25|$|In Christian faith, {{theologians and}} {{philosophers}} {{make a distinction}} between: (a) preambles of faith and (b) articles of faith. The preambles include alleged truths contained <b>in</b> <b>revelation</b> which are nevertheless demonstrable by reason, e.g., the immortality of the soul, the existence of God. The articles of faith, on the other hand, contain truths that cannot be proven or reached by reason alone and presuppose the truths of the preambles, e.g., the Holy Trinity, is not demonstrable and presupposes the existence of God.|$|E
