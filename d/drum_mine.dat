5000|$|On 2 March 2007, Paice held a drum clinic {{organised}} by the University of Glamorgan. The {{show was}} organised {{in partnership with}} ATRiuM the University's Cardiff School of Creative & Cultural Industries. Commenting after the show Paice said: [...] "ATRiuM {{will be a great}} place for young musicians to learn their craft, not to mention all the other things they’ve got going on there. This <b>drum</b> clinic of <b>mine</b> will hopefully demonstrate that drummers are also musicians, despite the jokes!".|$|R
500|$|The {{musical score}} for Hulk was {{composed}} by Danny Elfman, who scored Spider-Man the previous year. Frequent Ang Lee collaborator, Mychael Danna, {{was the original}} composer for the film. However, Danna's score was rejected by studio executives for its non-traditional approach, which featured Japanese taiko, African drumming, and Arabic singing. Elfman was then approached by Universal's president of film music, Kathy Nelson. With 37 days to compose over two hours of music, Elfman agreed out of respect to Lee. While instructing to retain much {{of the character of}} Danna's score, Lee pushed Elfman to write material that did not sound like his previous superhero scores. [...] "They did leave some of my music in the movie," [...] said Danna, [...] "so the Arabic singing and some of the <b>drumming</b> is <b>mine.</b> What happened is that they panicked, they brought in Danny and he heard what I've been doing and I guess he liked it." ...|$|R
25|$|High {{levels of}} carbon {{monoxide}} (CO) and methane gas in the mine atmosphere made it necessary for rescuers to wait 12 hours after the explosion to begin to reach the miners. Tests taken through holes drilled from the surface showed that the air near where the miners were last known to be stationed contained 1,300 parts per million of CO. More than 200 parts per million is considered unsafe. However, each miner had a Self-Contained Self-Rescuer (SCSR) device that provided one hour of breathable air. Emergency supplies were stored in 55-gallon drums (205 L <b>drums)</b> within the <b>mine.</b>|$|R
25|$|Naturally {{occurring}} {{deposits of}} nahcolite (NaHCO3) {{are found in}} the Eocene-age (55.8–33.9 Mya) Green River Formation, Piceance Basin in Colorado. Nahcolite was deposited as beds during periods of high evaporation in the basin. It is commercially mined using common underground mining techniques such as bore, <b>drum,</b> and longwall <b>mining</b> in a fashion very similar to coal mining. A very small portion is also obtained using in situ leach techniques involving dissolution of the nahcolite by heated water pumped through the nahcolite beds that have previously been mined using the aforementioned techniques. It is then reconstituted through a natural cooling crystallization process. Currently only Tronox (formerly FMC) in the Green River Wyoming basin has successfully commercially solution mined the product.|$|R
30|$|The {{longitudinal}} vibrations of ropes in mine hoist {{have been}} widely studied by many researchers. The single-rope <b>mine</b> <b>drum</b> is the catenary–vertical rope system and the coupled lateral–longitudinal dynamic response of the cables was studied by Kaczmarczyk and Ostachowicz (2003 a, 2003 b). Qin (2007) analyzed the longitudinal vibration of hoisting ropes by using the Lagrange principle. Li (2010) established Horizontal and vertical vibration models of the hoisting container under the steel guide and the vibration characteristic of hoisting container under different faults of steel guide was studied. To master the impact dynamical behaviors of the hoisting rope during the skip loading, the mechanical model of the coupled longitudinal-torsional vibration for hoisting rope were built by Cao (2010).|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In {{the surface}} stress {{detection}} {{system of the}} <b>mine</b> hoist machine <b>drum,</b> the wireless sensor nodes placed on the drum need to be powered by a battery. Since the sampling frequency is high and the wireless transmitting and receiving data is enormous, the battery needs to be replaced very frequently. To solve this problem, this paper designed wind-induced piezoelectric energy harvestingx 8 device for wireless sensor node on the <b>drum</b> of <b>mine</b> hoist, which can charge the battery by obtaining the energy from the environment. In this paper, {{the structure of the}} energy harvesting device was introduced, the working principle of wind-induced piezoelectric energy harvesting device on the drum surface of the mine hoist was analyzed, and the piezoelectric bimorph cantilever beam energy harvesting circuit with ultra-low loss characteristics was designed. Based on these, we conducted several experiments with the wind-induced piezoelectric energy harvesting device. The result indicates that the final storage voltage can reach 4. 4 V at both ends of C 3 in the piezoelectric energy harvesting circuit, which means it is able to charge the lithium ion battery.

50|$|Stewart Pixley {{proved an}} {{aggressive}} rival. He won {{much of the}} 10-ounce 998 gold bar business with India, ordering from Johnson Matthey's new refinery. He also kept close track of silver, whose price fell 50% between 1850 and 1900 as European nations turned from gold and silver. In pursuit of American silver, he took a train to Montana (his great-grandson prized the ticket a hundred years later) and bought {{a stake in the}} <b>Drum</b> Lummon <b>mine.</b> However, Frederick Wilkins (son of the first 1847 partner) had retained the connections with Mexican and South American mines that James Sharp had fostered half a century earlier. Wilkins gave a precise analysis of silver output in Mexico (the foremost producer) to the 1876 House of Commons Select Committee on the Depreciation of Silver. The firm's status as silver broker also secured them the chairmanship of the London Silver Fixing, which was held in their office at 32 Great Winchester Street, from 1897. They were joined by Mocatta & Goldsmid, Pixley & Abell and Samuel Montagu & Co. at 1.45 pm Monday through Friday and 11.45 am on Saturday.|$|R
5000|$|Tarja Turunen explains:“The idea {{of having}} a symphonic orchestra, choir and Mr. Terrana on <b>drums</b> was {{originally}} <b>mine.</b> Mike has done a recording with drums over classical pieces that I think it is great. I immediately imagined it performed live on a stage with a real orchestra {{as a part of a}} bigger concept. I believe this kind of combination of instruments, particularly playing mainly classical music, is very unique. I have been making collaborations with orchestras before and I could foresee a great outcome. Our main goal with these kind of concerts is that the younger audience experiences the beauty and power of a symphonic orchestra and choir. Hopefully it will serve as an introduction to classical music for some of our fans.” ...|$|R
