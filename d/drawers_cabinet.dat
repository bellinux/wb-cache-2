Many different types of door latches are available from simple door knob covers to top-of-door latches that can be operated {{from both sides of}} the door. Another type of lock is an inexpensive device which can be easily installed into <b>drawers,</b> <b>cabinets,</b> or other openables to prevent easy opening. It consists of a bendable plastic rod with a blunt hook on one side, and is situated on the inside of the <b>drawer</b> or <b>cabinet.</b>|$|R

50|$|Another type of lock is an {{inexpensive}} device {{which can be}} easily installed into <b>drawers,</b> <b>cabinets,</b> or other openables to prevent easy opening. It consists of a bendable plastic rod with a blunt hook on one side, and is situated {{on the inside of}} the <b>drawer</b> or <b>cabinet.</b> The hook catches on part of the drawer or door and prevents opening unless the rod is bent downward simultaneously to disengage the hook. These devices are helpful to pet owners as well — a typical housecat may be able to paw open a cabinet filled with food, but would have trouble operating the hook mechanism. Also available are electromagnetic cabinet locking devices that are activated via remote control.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, a {{modeling}} method to handle furniture is proposed. In real environment, {{there is a}} lot of furniture such as <b>drawer,</b> <b>cabinet</b> and so on. If mobile robots can handle these furniture autonomously, it is expected that multiple daily tasks, for example, storing a small object in a drawer, can be performed by the robots. However, it is a perplexing process to give several pieces of knowledge about the furniture to the robots manually. So we propose direct teaching based approach which can easily give not only how to handle the furniture but also an appearance and 3 D shape of it simultaneously. The main topic is about the appearance and shape information acquisition using external sensors. I...|$|R
50|$|Shenmue {{features}} a persistent world with {{level of detail}} considered unprecedented for games at the time. Shops open and close, buses run to timetables, and characters have their own routines, each {{in accordance with the}} in-game clock. Though not all objects are interactive, the player can inspect elements including <b>drawers,</b> <b>cabinets</b> and shelves. Ryo receives a daily allowance which can be spent on items including food, raffle tickets, audio cassettes and capsule toys. There are several minigames; in the local arcade, for example, Ryo can throw darts or play complete versions of the Sega arcade games Hang-On and Space Harrier. Later in the game, Ryo gets a part-time job at the docks and must ferry crates between warehouses and compete in races using a forklift.|$|R

40|$|The {{preliminary}} {{design of a}} virtual environment based file management system is described. 1. Background Current virtual environments model real or imagined scenes at various scales.

Pre-Virtual Environment 3 -Dimensional Models of Linear Systems Long before virtual reality, people used 3 -dimensional schemes for visualizing abstractions which are essentially linear in nature. For example, the traditional physical card catalog in a library was essentially a linear alphabetical list of records arranged spatially in <b>drawers,</b> <b>cabinets,</b> and rows of cabinets for efficient access.

The storage unit has a storage surface for storing objects. Image recording units e. g. charge-coupled device-line scanning camera (10) and lens (11), with the storage surface of the storage unit detect upward- and downward movements relative to the frame structure in sections. A personal computer (16) is connected with the image recording units. Upward and downward documentation images are produced from upward and downward movement-image data at a time point. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a storage- and/or removal method for storage of objects in a storage device. USE - Storage device e. g. <b>drawer</b> <b>cabinet,</b> refrigerator, automatic lift system and rotating rack, for storage of consumer objects e. g. tool such as drill and grinding wheel, food (all claimed) and drug packages in a hospital.
