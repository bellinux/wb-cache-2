40|$|This Corrective Action Investigation Plan (CAIP) {{addresses}} one {{of three}} leachfield systems associated with Test Cell A, which is located in Area 25 at the Nevada Test Site (NTS). The NTS is approximately 105 kilometers (km) (65 miles [mi]) northwest of Las Vegas, Nevada (see Leachfield Work Plan Figure 1 - 1). Corrective Action Unit 500 is comprised of the Test Cell A Septic System (CAS 25 - 04 - 05) and the associated leachfield system presented in Figure 1 - 1 (FFACO, 1996). The leachfield is located 60 meters (m) (200 feet [ft]) southeast of the Building 3124 gate, and approximately 45 m (150 ft) southwest of Building 3116 at Test Cell A. Test Cell A operated during the 1960 s to support nuclear rocket reactor testing {{as part of the}} Nuclear Rocket Development Station (NRDS) (SNPO, 1970). Various operations within Buildings 3113 B (Mechanical Equipment Room), 3115 (Helium Compressor Station), 3116 (Pump House), a water tank drain and overflow, a ''yard and <b>equipment</b> <b>drain</b> system'' outside of Building 3116, and a trailer have resulted in potentially hazardous effluent releases to the leachfield system (DOE, 1988 a). The leachfield system components include discharge lines, manways, a septic tank, an outfall line, a diversion chamber, and a 15 by 30 m (50 by 100 ft) leachfield (see Leachfield Work Plan Figure 3 - 1 for explanation of terminology). In addition, engineering drawings show an outfall system {{that may or may not}} be connected to the CAU 500 leachfield. In general, effluent contributed to the leachfield was sanitary wastewater associated with floor drains, toilet and lavatory facilities in Building 3113 B and floor drains in the remaining source buildings.

40|$|Phenolic {{compounds}} {{are important}} constituents {{of white wine}} that can impart bitterness and astringency and influence stability and colour. The specific types and concentrations of phenolic compounds vary between the different grape tissues. For example grape skins contain much higher concentrations of phenolics than grape pulp. Consequently, grape processing techniques, particularly the method by which juice is expressed, can influence the phenolic profile of white wines. Concerns of elevated phenolic levels tend to lead to conservative practices such as limiting the time between machine harvesting and winery processing, {{and the use of}} relatively expensive batch <b>draining</b> and pressing <b>equipment.</b> Phenolic extraction during pomace contact, such as might occur after machine harvesting prior to winery processing, was investigated at a controlled laboratory scale. Contact time significantly increased phenolic extraction as did the fraction of broken berries. However, given the uncertainty in the amount of berry breakage in industrial practice, full scale transport trials should be performed by wineries where economic advantage could be gained from relaxing restriction on times between harvesting and winery processing. Techniques used for white grape juice expression both now and in the past were critically reviewed and winery sampling was performed to develop a practical understanding of operational issues. For the expression of juice from white grapes, pneumatic membrane presses have been increasingly adopted both for pressing and draining. This is principally a product of their ability to express high yields of juice with relatively low levels of phenolics and suspended solids. These devices can be operated in many different manners and quality and productivity is highly dependent on the specific mode of operation. Adaptive programmes based principally on continuous assessment of juice flow rate, and the use of conductivity measurement to monitor skin extraction are important tools that can aid economic optimisation of expression operations. The principal problem with the pneumatic membrane press {{is that it is a}} batch operation with a relatively low throughput. In the longer term, the ideal outcome would be the development of expression equipment that achieved the high throughput and relatively low cost per tonne of continuous inclined drainers and screw presses, while still maintaining the quality obtained with pneumatic membrane presses. Continuous devices that mimic the repeated cycles of compression and crumbling of these batch presses may be one means of achieving this. Exploration of the different continuous screw presses used historically suggests that there still may be room for improvement in these devices. This merits further specific investigation. Experiments involving repeated cycles of compression and crumbling were performed with a constant rate laboratory apparatus. These experiments demonstrated the importance of bed height, pressing speed, sieve plate design and crumbling on press operation. Solids content appears to be a major issue in the development of rapid juice expression equipment. One means of achieving appropriately low solids levels, without requiring large devices with large cake beds for juice filtration, may be to maintain the structure of the grape for as long as possible so that juice is filtered as it is expelled from the berry.

VSP' {{goal is to}} assist the industry {{to develop and implement}} comprehensive sanitation programs to protect the health of passengers and crew aboard cruise vessels. Every cruise vessel that has a foreign itinerary, carries 13 or more passengers, and calls on a U. S. port is subject to biannual operational inspections and when necessary, re-inspection by VSP. The vessel owner pays a fee, based on gross registered tonnage (GRT) of the vessel, for all operational inspections. The Vessel Sanitation Program Operations Manual (VSP Operations Manual), which is available on the VSP Web site (www. cdc. gov/nceh/vsp), covers details of these inspections. Additionally, cruise vessel owners or shipyards that build or renovate cruise vessels may voluntarily request plan reviews, on-site shipyard construction inspections and/or final construction inspections of new or remodeled vessels before their first or next operational inspection. The vessel owner or shipyard pays a fee, based on GRT of the vessel, for on-site and final construction inspections. VSP does not charge a fee for plan reviews or consultations. Section 3. 0, Procedures for Making Requests for Plan Reviews and Construction-Related Inspections covers details pertaining to plan reviews, consultations, or construction inspections. The Recommended Shipbuilding Construction Guidelines for Cruise Vessels Destined to Call on U. S. Ports, has been renamed as the Vessel Sanitation Program Construction Manual (referred to in this documents as "these guidelines". The main purpose of these guidelines is to provide a framework of consistent construction and design guidelines that protect passenger and crew health. CDC is committed to promoting high construction standards to protect the public's health. Compliance with these guidelines will help to ensure a healthy environment on cruise vessels. CDC reviewed many references {{from a variety of sources}} to develop this document. These references are indicated in Section 32. 2, Standards, Codes and Other References Reviewed for Guidance. These guidelines cover various components of the vessel's facilities related to public health, including food storage, preparation, and service; water bunkering, storage, disinfection, and distribution. Vessel owners and operators may select the design and equipment that best meets their needs. However, the design and equipment must also meet the sanitary design criteria of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) or equivalent organization, and VSP'sroutine operational inspection requirements. These guidelines are not meant to limit the introduction of new designs, materials or technology for shipbuilding. A shipbuilder, owner, manufacturer, or other interested party may request VSP to periodically review or revise these guidelines in relation to new information or technology. VSP reviews such requests in accordance with the criteria described in Section 2. 0, "Revisions and Recommended Changes. " New cruise vessels must comply with all international code requirements (e. g., International Maritime Organization [IMO] Conventions). Those include requirements of the Safety of Life-at-Sea Convention (SOLAS), International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL), Tonnage and Load Line Convention, International Electrical Code (IEC), International Plumbing Code (IPC), and International Standards Organization (ISO). This document does not cross-reference related and sometimes overlapping standards that new cruise vessels must meet. These guidelines went into effect on June 1, 2005.
