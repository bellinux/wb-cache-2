25|$|The European Parliament heard {{testimony}} about organ harvesting in China during a 6 December 2012 session {{on human rights}} in China.

In March 2014, the European Economic and Social Committee in Brussels convened a follow-up event on organ transplant abuses in China. Participants and speakers at the session endorsed the recommendations of the parliamentary resolution, which recognized that Falun Gong and other minority groups are targets of <b>forced</b> <b>organ</b> <b>harvesting</b> in China.

In April 1999, over ten thousand Falun Gong practitioners gathered at Communist Party of China headquarters, Zhongnanhai, in a silent protest following an incident in Tianjin.

Since 1999, Falun Gong practitioners in China {{have been subject to}} torture, arbitrary imprisonment, beatings, <b>forced</b> labor, <b>organ</b> <b>harvesting,</b> and psychiatric abuses.

According to an informant interviewed on the program 20/20, the plastinated cadavers came from executed prisoners. Again, however, Gutmann notes a disparity in the numbers: the body plastination factories operating in Dalian processed thousands of cadavers—far more than could be expected to be donated or taken from legally executed prisoners. The establishment of the body plastination factories coincided with the onset of the persecution of Falun Gong.|$|E
50|$|In October 2014, reports {{surfaced}} {{that according}} to Ethan Gutmann, an investigative writer who testified before the U.S. Congress on <b>forced</b> <b>organ</b> <b>harvesting,</b> Ko reportedly visited China in 2004 and tried to negotiate good prices for the organs illegally harvested from newly executed Falun Gong practitioners. Ko denied the accusation, and said he told Gutmann {{that there were some}} doctors in Taiwan who had been involved in buying or selling organs for transplant, but that he was not one of them. He added {{that he did not know}} whether the organs came from Falun Gong practitioners or not, and that he only stated in the interview with Gutmann that the majority of organ sources in mainland China were unclear. Ko's office stated that a recording of a conversation between Gutmann and Ko drastically contradict with details provided by Gutmann. Ko has also designated an attorney to request Gutmann to correct all false allegations in his book. Gutmann responded saying he had not said that Ko was involved in the organ trade and that he might have been intentionally misinterpreted.|$|E

40|$|Evidence on FOH {{from the}} global {{investigations}} As you’ve heard the evidence provided by Hon. David Kilgour, I will now highlight just the major findings from various investigations on this issue. What do we know as of today? Since 1999, China has performed over 150, 000 transplants. This constitutes the second largest national transplant volume in the world, yet voluntary donation at home is nearly non-existent. China {{did not have any}} organ donations until 2003. Out of the 120, 000 transplants performed between 1999 and 2010, a mere 130 official donations were registered. David Kilgour and David Matas ’ report is not the only investigation that found Falun Gong practitioners as the major target of <b>forced</b> <b>organ</b> <b>harvesting</b> in China. Investigations from Israel and the United States have come to the same conclusions. China’s large volume of annual transplants made it {{the only place in the}} world that can offer organs within weeks of a request, instead of years. Chinese hospitals advertised on their websites that transplantations could be scheduled in advance and performed within 1 - 4 weeks. Organ transplant rates in China climaxed in 2005 - 2006.

Hybridimaging,wheremicroPETactivitiesarecross- calibrated using post scan <b>harvested</b> <b>organs,</b> can improve quantification. <b>Organ</b> <b>harvesting,</b> dynamic imaging and hybrid imaging {{were applied to}} determine the human and mouse radiation dosimetry of 6 -[18 F]fluoro-L-DOPA and 2 -[18 F]fluoro-L-tyrosine and compared. Procedures: Two-hour dynamic microPET imaging was performed with both tracers in four separate mice for 18 F-FDOPA and three mice for 18 F-FTYR. <b>Organ</b> <b>harvesting</b> was performed at 2, 5, 10, 30, 60 and 120 min post tracer injection with n= 5 {{at each time point}} for 18 F-FDOPA and n= 3 at each time point for 18 F-FTYR. Human radiation dosimetry projected from animal data was calculated for the three different approaches for each tracer using OLINDA/EXM. S- factors for the MOBY phantom were used to calculate the animal dosimetry. Results: Correlations between dose estimates based on <b>organ</b> <b>harvesting</b> and imaging was improved from r= 0. 997 to r= 0. 999 for 18 F-FDOPA and from r= 0. 985 to r= 0. 996 (p< 0. 0001 for all) for 18 F-FTYR by using hybrid imaging. Conclusion: Hybrid imaging yields comparable results to traditional <b>organ</b> <b>harvesting</b> while partially overcoming the limitations of pure imaging.
