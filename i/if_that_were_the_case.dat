Frank Williams said the demands were 'impossible'; Mansell concluded that <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> he would be happy to retire. Three weeks later the impossible had happened and Mansell was a Williams driver.|$|E

Senior pathologist James McNamara was consulted about what might have happened to Holt's body, and suggested that it may have trapped by kelp and then consumed by sea creatures (specifically sharks, crayfish, and/or sea lice). <b>If</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> [...] "the body would have been reduced to a skeleton in a period as short as 24 to 48 hours".

2500|$|The {{disease is}} theorized {{to include the}} artery of the ligmentum teres femoris being {{constricted}} or even blocked too early, not allowing for time when the medial circumflex femoral artery takes over. [...] The medial circumflex femoral artery is the principal source of blood supply to the femoral head. [...] LCP disease is a vascular restrictive condition of idiopathic nature. [...] Symptoms like femoral head disfigurement, flattening, and collapse occur typically between ages four and ten, mostly male children of Caucasian descent. [...] Children affected by LCP disease often display uneven gait and limited range of motion, and they experience mild to severe pain in the groin area. [...] For example, a child may be six years old chronologically but may have grown only four years old in terms of bone maturity. The child may then engage in activities appropriate for a six-year- old child, but lacking the bone strength of an older child, these activities may lead to flattening or fracture of the hip joint. Genetics {{do not appear to}} be a determining factor, but a deficiency of blood factors with anticoagulant property used to disperse blood clots may lead to blockages in the vessels supplying the joint. A deficiency of protein C and protein S, which also act as blood anticoagulants, may also exist; <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> their deficiency could cause clot formation in ligamentum teres femoris artery and hinder blood supply to the femoral head. However, no evidence of this has been found; over the years, many theories have been published, but none has stood up to professional research.|$|E

30|$|With the two {{procedural}} norms {{described in}} the previous sections, we can now analyze whether these two norms are indeed beneficial to reconciling different responsibility conceptions.

2500|$|After {{a series}} of adventures with Generation X, Howard gets {{a job as a}} {{department}} store Santa Claus, which gets him dragged to the North Pole, where the real Santa Claus has sold out to Hydra. [...] Howard goes through several dimensions, apparently through the power of Man-Thing, who can now talk but does not understand this ability, and lands on a version of Duckworld where his parents are essentially Ward and June Cleaver, he has a sister named Princess, and he is regarded as a hero because his activities on Earth-616 were recognized by Duckworld's version of Reed Richards. [...] This origin traces the source of these dimensions to be projections from Franklin's mind, though through the course of the adventure, Howard has a romance with Tana Nile, culminating in a kiss, after which he apologizes and tells her of his attachment to Beverly. When Franklin understands that he has shaped all these worlds, they find themselves back in Man-Thing's swamp. [...] While Man-Thing became a self-appointed guardian to Franklin Richards, Howard went off on his own and was captured by the Cult of Entropy, who wrapped him in swaddling clothes. [...] Although we last saw him in the swamp, he states that he was thrown into baggage and transported on a plane. [...] The cult wants him because he has part of the Nexus of All Realities, which shattered during Heroes Reborn, inside him, which he knows because it is making him nauseous. [...] Man-Thing enters his gullet, and Howard vomits him back out with the fragment, but the former is left desiccated and practically dead. He then encountered Namor, who thought he had slain the creature, but Howard explains {{that he would not be}} lugging his friend's body <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b> [...] Howard sets Man-Thing down in the water, and he revives during the conversation with Namor.
