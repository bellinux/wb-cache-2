The expected heating demands were computed from the model based on weather data and the GSHP system was designed accordingly. A compromise was made between minimizing the size of the heat pump and the achievable energy savings, which could have important implications for the way incentives for low-emissions heating systems are set up.

40|$|Introduction: Asbestos {{has been}} {{employed}} in {{a myriad of}} industrial applications {{for more than a}} century. Of the 181 Mt of asbestos produced worldwide, over 31 Mt was consumed in the U. S. The production and consumption of this mineral eventually was found to cause asbestosis, lung cancer and mesothelioma. While the brunt of the human exposure to asbestos occurred in <b>insulation</b> <b>work,</b> many more workers in other jobs were expose to asbestos fibers. Very {{little is known about the}} potential exposure to asbestos in research labs. Goal: In order to investigate potential research lab work exposures, we simulated lab work with various asbestos-containing items commonly found in research laboratories: 6 wire gauze pads, 3 gloves, 3 beaker tongs, and 3 Transite boards. All samples were analyzed by Phase Contrast Microscopy and, when appropriate, by Transmission Electron Microscopy and Polarized Light Microscopy. Results: All tested items were confirmed by bulk sampling to have asbestos fibers in their composition. Exposures from the 7 wire gauze pads were significantly lower than the PEL and the excursion limit, the highest exposure concentration measuring 0. 029 f/cc. For the 3 beaker tongs with asbestos sleeves, exposure was below the PEL for 2 of the 3, with one resulting in an exposure of 0. 160 f/cc (8 -h TWA = 0. 01 f/cc). For the Transite boards had the highest exposures of all tested items, with a maximum concentration of 0. 320 f/cc (8 -h TWA = 0. 02 f/cc).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{contract}} {{is to develop a}} process for converting light alkane gases to methyl chloride via oxyhydrochlorination using highly selective, stable catalysts in fixed-bed reactors designed to remove the large amount of heat generated, so as to control the reaction temperature. Further, the objective is to obtain the engineering data base necessary for developing a commercially feasible process and to evaluate t economics of the process. Significant progress was made in six different technical areas during this quarter. These key highlights are: (1) Evaluation of catalyst samples from UCI led to the ordering of the OHC PDU catalyst batch. This catalyst batch arrived, was screened and found to be defective, and was reordered. (2) Natural gas containing higher hydrocarbons was used as a methane source. The reactant mixture formed oxygenates at temperatures lower than observed in the past. Burning at such low temperatures seems to create a product stream containing very little CH{sub 2 }Cl{sub 2 }. (3) Although it has not been decided if the PDU will use natural gas from the plant or methane or natural gas from cylinders as a methane feed source, it was concluded that an adsorption unit to remove sulfur and higher hydrocarbons is not necessary at this time.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{new models}} and investigations into switching transient phenomena {{related to the}} shunt reactors and the Mechanically Switched Capacitor with Damping Network (MSCDN) operations used for reactive power control in the transmission system. Shunt reactors and MSCDN are similar in that they have reactors. A shunt reactor is connected parallel to the compensated lines to absorb the leading current, whereas the MSCDN is a version of a capacitor bank that has been designed as a C-type filter {{for use in the}} harmonic-rich environment. In this work, models have been developed and transient overvoltages due to shunt reactor deenergisation were estimated analytically using MathCad, a mathematical program. Computer simulations were then undertaken using the ATP/EMTP program to reproduce both single-phase and three-phase shunt reactor switching at 275 kV operational substations. The effect of the reactor switching on the circuit breaker grading capacitor was also examined by considering various switching conditions. The main original achievement of this thesis is the clarification of failure mechanisms occurring in the air-core filter reactor due to MSCDN switching operations. The simulation of the MSCDN energisation was conducted using the ATP/EMTP program in the presence of surge arresters. The outcome of this simulation shows that extremely fast transients were established across the air-core filter reactor. This identified transient event has {{led to the development of}} a detailed air-core reactor model, which accounts for the inter-turn RLC parameters as well as the stray capacitances-to-ground. These parameters are incorporated into the transient simulation circuit, from which the current and voltage distribution across the winding were derived using electric field and equivalent circuit modelling. Further analysis of the results has revealed that there are substantial dielectric stresses imposed on the winding insulation that can be attributed to a combination of three factors. (i) First, the surge arrester operation during the MSCDN energisation, which causes steep voltage change at the reactor terminal. (ii) Second, the nonuniform voltage distribution, resulting in high stresses across the top inter-turn windings. (iii) Third, the rapid rate-of-change of voltage in the assumed worst-case reactor winding location. This is accompanied by a high dielectric (displacement) current through the inter-turn winding <b>insulation.</b> <b>Work</b> within this investigation proposes that a synergistic effect of high electric field and high dielectric current occurring at worst energisation, followed by the thermal effects of steady state operation contributes to the failure of air-core reactors used on the 400 kV MSCDN...|$|E
40|$|This Master’s Thesis was {{performed}} at Electrolux Cooking Plant in Dudley Park, Adelaide. Since 2004 a consolidation project called Dudley Park Product Rationalisation Project, (DPPRP), has proceeded at Electrolux Cooking Plant. DPPRP is initiated to reduce costs, increase the efficiency, {{improve the quality}} of the products and reduce the number of components. This Master’s Thesis {{is a part of the}} DPPRP and was commenced in the phase of introducing the electric 600 underbench oven. The objective of this thesis is to develop efficient and functional solutions for the cavity subassembly build area so that the demand of an annual production of 70, 200 ovens can be met. Initially the project was defined within the project group and then the methods were chosen. To get an understanding of the assembly process, the existing electric 600 upswept assembly line was studied as a current situation and a Process Failure Mode Effect Analysis, (PFMEA) {{was performed}}. Within the investigation areas layout, material handling, organisation, safety and ergonomics the problem areas were identified. By structuring a theoretical framework the current situation could be analysed. The results of the analysis have formed the basis for finding practicable solutions. By using the Engineered Planning Approach and Simplified Systematic Layout Planning, (SSLP), three conceptual layout proposals were developed. These proposals were compared and evaluated against the specification of requirements to decide which one to develop in detail. The suggested solution for the electric 600 underbench cavity build is a serial production system consisting of three cavity work stations and one <b>insulation</b> <b>work</b> station. The system is flexible to cater for fluctuating production volumes and can meet the production volume demand of 70, 200 cavities per year with a line balance efficiency of 96 %. The work station design facilitates that the operator performs ergonomically and the storage of components is optimised to be in accordance with the Kanban material handling system. The final layout solution has been evaluated to ensure that it corresponds with the specification of requirements. To make it easy for new employees to learn the assembly process, and prevent failures, work instructions have been developed. A recommendation to Electrolux is to start with using only two cavity work stations during the implementation phase in January when the production volume is 36, 800 cavities per year and then add a third cavity work station when the production volume increases.

It reports on an action research experiment conducted {{in the context of the}} Interreg project ‘SUN’ (Sustainable Urban Neighbourhoods). The results of this experiment are quite promising. Within a few months, some 80 energy retrofitting interventions (energy audits or <b>insulation</b> <b>works)</b> were implemented in one neighbourhood of the city of Liège. Our evaluation of the experiment showed that the prospect of achieving cost reductions was one of the main initial expectations of participants to the GGPs.

These benefits were mostly related to the guidance they received, to the facilitation with contractors and to the social dynamics generated by the initiative. Several weaknesses were also identified by participants, like the lack of follow-up during and after the works. Our evaluation also highlighted that the main landlords did not participate in the initiative and that the influence of GGPs on costs was limited to specific types of interventions. Despite observed limitations and possible improvements, such a neighbourhood-based approach certainly constitutes a promising avenue for public authorities to support and accelerate the energy retrofitting of private residential buildings in urban neighbourhoods.

Such goals as cost reduction, reducing installation time and increasing the service life of structures are accomplishing by creating new technologies of erecting buildings and developing ways ofquickconstruction, using different types of fixed formwork. One of themis textstone. Textstone is an artificial construction stone, containing on the outer surface the reinforcing fine-mesh shell with multifunctional properties, formed by the interwoven threads of a vigorous fixed formwork textile material (basalt, linen, silica and other glass yarns) adhered by binding material. The innovative construction technology of production and installation {{of a new generation}} of textstone buildings has been registered as a brand TextStone. The fundamental difference between texstone and reinforced concrete and all known building materials is that the whole outer surface of solidified light binders is protected by strong, vigorous and fixed formwork made from inexpensive textile materials. Manufacturing textile shells allows using it as an internal finishing material, reducing or eliminating the cost of finishing work. The use of fixed textile construction shutters during the construction of buildings has obvious technical, economic, operational, sanitary and environmental benefits: short construction time (from 3 to 10 days), compact packaging and light weight of fabric shells, high fire resistance, frost resistance, ease of engineering services installation in the hollow communicating shells; minimal amount of finishing, roofing, heat and noise <b>insulation</b> <b>works.</b> Texstone is a durable solid monolithic construction that provides high viability and earthquakes, hurricanes wind, solar sultriness and frost resistance.
