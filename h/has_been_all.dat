Cliff McCormack (Daran Norris), a local public defender, also arrives, and tells Veronica that she <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>all</b> but cleared, but Sheriff Lamb will keep her in custody {{for as long as}} he can because he still {{believes}} she was involved in Josh's disappearance. Keith returns to Mars Investigations, where Hank Landry arrives and says that he found a bugging device in his phone. Landry had been implicated in the ongoing investigation into the death of Cyrus O’Dell, dean of Hearst College where Veronica is a student. Keith denies that he or Veronica placed the device in his phone, but Hank becomes angry, telling him to stop investigating him.|$|E

The pair escape City 17 via an evacuation train as the Citadel core goes critical, sending out the Combine message. The resulting shockwave derails their train.|$|E

25|$|While {{these data}} {{demonstrate}} that analgesic nephropathy <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>all</b> but eliminated in some regions, {{in other regions}} the condition persists. Notably, in Belgium, the prevalence of analgesic nephropathy among people having dialysis was 17.9% in 1984 and 15.6% in 1990. Michielsen and de Schepper suggest that analgesic nephropathy persists among people in Belgium having dialysis not due to non-phenacetin analgesics, but because Belgium accepts {{a higher proportion of}} elderly people for dialysis. According to these authors, a greater proportion have analgesic nephropathy because a greater percentage of people in Belgium having dialysis have been exposed to long-term use of phenacetin.|$|E
25|$|Evan-Thomas {{continued}} {{to suffer from}} illness while in the Mediterranean, and in 1894 received sick leave to return to England. While he was indeed ill, the leave was also granted {{to allow him to}} formally propose to and marry Hilda Barnard, who he had intended to marry immediately before his unexpected posting to the Mediterranean. The wedding took place on 18 July 1894 at St. Saviours Church, Walton Place, Knightsbridge. In November the couple moved to Valletta on Malta where the fleet was based. Social life on Malta remained impressive, with royalty and other dignitaries stopping at Malta and being entertained at Admiralty House. Evan-Thomas' term in the Mediterranean ceased in December 1896. Culme-Seymour wrote that 'he has great tact and judgement - a thorough knowledge of his duties (signal and otherwise) and both with the fleet in the summer at sea and on shore in Malta <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>all</b> that I could wish'. On 1 January 1897 he was promoted to commander.|$|E

The band also announced that it would be celebrating the 10-year anniversary of The Devil and God are Raging Inside Me by playing it in its entirety the remainder of the tour.

500|$|Lekson and McKenna {{note that}} {{following}} the rediscovery of Chetro Ketl {{in the early}} 19th century, the building's [...] "pace of dissolution increased alarmingly... has deteriorated {{at a faster rate}} over the last century and a half than in the previous six." [...] Chetro Ketl's wooden elements have proven especially vulnerable in a region that lacks timber, with soldiers, cattlemen, and transients scavenging them from the structure. The rear balcony was present in 1901, but by 1921 the beams had been removed by people scouring the canyon for wood. The process of uncovering beams during excavation has further hastened their deterioration. Chaco Wash, which deepens and widens during summer rain showers, also threatens the canyon's ruins. The once prominent refuse mound <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>all</b> but destroyed by repeated trenching and by diverting arroyos near Chetro Ketl. Treasure hunting, livestock grazing, and early National Park Service stabilization efforts also contributed to the degradation of the structure, as have deep excavations that left Chaco Wash prone to flooding. Archeology was responsible for the catastrophic effects of a 1947 flood that destroyed the walls of twenty rooms and collapsed [...] of the north wall. It also toppled Chetro Ketl's tallest remnants.|$|E
500|$|In 2003, Katherine and Jill were {{believed}} to be mother and daughter after Katherine's friend, Charlotte Ramsey, provided factual proof. Of the storyline, Walton stated: [...] "She's [...] going down a bad road. In looking back over the past 16 years, she's gone down a lot of bad roads, for a lot of different reasons. She'll survive this one and, hopefully, maybe this time she'll learn something from it." [...] She also described Jill as being in a [...] "soul-searching period" [...] during the storyline, saying: [...] "Now she's numbing herself with the alcohol because all those feelings of love are coming up for her mother, and she doesn't {{know how to deal with}} them." [...] Walton said she felt Jill had been [...] "shaken to the very foundation" [...] upon the revelation that Katherine is her mother, stating: [...] "A big part of who she <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>all</b> these years has to do with her anger towards Katherine. She always shoved any feeling of love down. Now, she's questioning everything about herself. That's why she is in such pain and why she is drinking. That hate thing is baseless now." [...] While admitting to having been surprised with the maternity revelation, Walton thought it was [...] "fabulous and rich, and it's opened up a whole new facet to the story". However, in 2009, the characters' history was rewritten by Maria Arena Bell; Charlotte had made up this information for revenge against Katherine, and they were not mother and daughter.|$|E

In his book Opening to You: Zen-Inspired Translations of the Psalms (Viking, 2002), Fischer replaced the words [...] "God", [...] "King", and [...] "Lord" [...] with the word [...] "You." [...] He explains:"For many of the religious seekers I encounter, the word God <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>all</b> but emptied of its spiritual power. The relationship to God that is charted out in the Psalms is a stormy one, co-dependent, passionate, confusing, loyal, petulant, sometimes even manipulative.

2500|$|The lack {{of convincing}} {{scientific}} evidence supporting its efficacy {{and its use}} of preparations without active ingredients have led to characterizations as pseudoscience and quackery, or, {{in the words of}} a 1998 medical review, [...] "placebo therapy at best and quackery at worst". The Russian Academy of Sciences considers homeopathy a [...] "dangerous 'pseudoscience' that does not work", and [...] "urges people to treat homeopathy 'on a par with magic. The Chief Medical Officer for England, Dame Sally Davies, has stated that homeopathic preparations are [...] "rubbish" [...] and do not serve as anything more than placebos. Jack Killen, acting deputy director of the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, says homeopathy [...] "goes beyond current understanding of chemistry and physics". He adds: [...] "There is, to my knowledge, no condition for which homeopathy has been proven to be an effective treatment." [...] Ben Goldacre says that homeopaths who misrepresent scientific evidence to a scientifically illiterate public, have [...] "... walled themselves off from academic medicine, and critique <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>all</b> too often met with avoidance rather than argument". Homeopaths often prefer to ignore meta-analyses in favour of cherry picked positive results, such as by promoting a particular observational study (one which Goldacre describes as [...] "little more than a customer-satisfaction survey") as if it were more informative than a series of randomized controlled trials.|$|E
2500|$|Gwynn's {{physical}} appearance defied his athleticism. He stood , thick {{around the middle}} and thighs. Even at his athletic prime when he could really run, he weighed around [...] and was considered pudgy. His roly-poly frame was a self-described [...] "body by Betty Crocker", {{a reference to the}} food product brand. Towards the end of his breakout season in 1984, he conceded that his [...] "extra weight hasn't helped me. My bat's slower than it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>all</b> year." [...] At the time, he attributed his weight gain to soft drinks: [...] "It's killing me. It's always been a weakness. I've gotta cut down on the soda pop." [...] Jim Murray of the Los Angeles Times opined in 1993 that Gwynn's [...] "deceptive" [...] looks and not [...] "look the part" [...] contributed to his regularly being overlooked in the voting for league MVP. Gwynn was sensitive about his weight. His knee injuries over his career prompted the Padres organization, media, and fans to question his weight, conditioning, and eating habits. However, he rejected the notion that his weight led to his injuries. Gwynn contended that his weight was only a topic when he was struggling, and not when he was performing. He also believed that the criticism stemmed mainly from his not fitting people's profile of what an athlete should look like. He said he had [...] "a football player's body", with his father, grandfather and brothers also being big. Gwynn said his hitting style put a lot of torque on his knees. He started experiencing problems with his legs in 1986, when he suffered from shin splints. In his career, he had 13 operations, including eight involving his knees. Limited by injuries, he played over 135 games just once in his final 11 seasons. Gwynn used to run a great deal to keep in shape, but his last five years were mostly limited to working out in the gym. His actual weight is generally thought to have been under-reported during the latter part of his career, when it was officially listed between [...]|$|E
