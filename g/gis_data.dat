40|$|Nowadays, the {{development}} of the technology of computer and internet greatly facilitate the production and dissemination of images, text, audio, video and other digital media. The single watermarking algorithm of <b>GIS</b> vector <b>data</b> can’t meet people’s need in some aspects as featured in bad robustness. By making up the disadvantages of the traditional watermarking to some degree, the multiple watermarking can embed several watermarks in the host in one way or several ways. However, several multiple watermarking studies are centered on the multimedia, and less on <b>GIS</b> vector <b>data.</b> In this paper, by integrating with <b>GIS</b> vector <b>data</b> characterized by the requirement for data accurateness, has put forward four multiple watermarking solutions available to <b>GIS</b> vector <b>data</b> and verified them by experiments. The multiple watermarking combines the advantages of the single watermarking and enhances its robustness. The multiple watermarking has achieved the goal of providing multiple protections for <b>GIS</b> vector <b>data</b> with liability and feasibility.

40|$|<b>GIS</b> vector <b>data</b> {{is closely}} {{linked with the}} {{development}} of social economy and national defense, which is of high production cost and high precision, so the copyright protection of <b>GIS</b> vector <b>data</b> means a great deal and the copyright authentication of <b>GIS</b> vector <b>data</b> has become an increasingly complex topic. In recent years, researches about copyright protection of <b>GIS</b> vector <b>data</b> mainly focuses on copyright marking techniques delegated by watermarking, but it seems like the traditional watermarking are incapability. In this paper, a new copyright authentication method is presented. The watermark signal is constructed utilizing the original data's macroscopical topology characteristics and microcosmic topology characteristics, and then it is registered to authority organ for notarization and authentication. This method is applied to topography map, and the experiment results show that this method can avoid data distortion bringing by watermark embedding and can resolve conflict between imperceptibility and robustness of digital watermark. 1.

[...] ArcCatalog is the data management application, used to browse datasets and files on one's computer, database, or other sources. [...] In addition to showing what data is available, ArcCatalog also {{allows users to}} preview the data on a map. [...] ArcCatalog also provides the ability to view and manage metadata for spatial datasets. [...] ArcMap is the application used to view, edit and query geospatial data, and create maps. [...] The ArcMap interface has two main sections, including a table of contents {{on the left and}} the data frame(s) which display the map. [...] Items in the table of contents correspond with layers on the map. [...] ArcToolbox contains geoprocessing, data conversion, and analysis tools, along with much of the functionality in ArcInfo. [...] It is also possible to use batch processing with ArcToolbox, for frequently repeated tasks. ArcScene is an application which allows the user to view their <b>GIS</b> <b>data</b> in 3-D and is available with the 3D Analyst License. [...] In the layer properties of ArcScene there is an Extrusion function which allows the user to exaggerate features three dimension-ally. ArcGlobe is another one of ArcGIS's 3D visualization applications available with the 3D Analyst License. ArcGlobe is a 3D visualization application that allows you to view large amounts of <b>GIS</b> <b>data</b> on a globe surface.
