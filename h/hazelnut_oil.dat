Two hundred and sixteen brown egg layers raised in contiguous wire cages were used. The duration of the experi-ment was 24 wk consisting of six periods of 4 wk. In the trial, six diets containing different levels of HKOM replacing 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 % of SBM protein, respectively, were utilized as the treatments. Differences among the diets in terms of egg yield, feed consumption, feed efficiency ratio, egg weight, egg yolk and albumen ratios, shell thickness, shell weight, and Roche color values of the yolk were not statistically significant (P>. 01).

5|$|Trees are {{the source}} of many of the world's best known fleshy fruits. Apples, pears, plums, {{cherries}} and citrus are all grown commercially in temperate climates and a wide range of edible fruits are found in the tropics. Other commercially important fruit include dates, figs and olives. Palm oil is obtained from the fruits of the oil palm (Elaeis guineensis). The fruits of the cocoa tree (Theobroma cacao) are used to make cocoa and chocolate and the berries of coffee trees, Coffea arabica and Coffea canephora, are processed to extract the coffee beans. In many rural areas of the world, fruit is gathered from forest trees for consumption. Many trees bear edible nuts which can loosely be described as being large, oily kernels found inside a hard shell. These include coconuts (Cocos nucifera), Brazil nuts (Bertholletia excelsa), pecans (Carya illinoinensis), hazel nuts (Corylus), almonds (Prunus dulcis), walnuts (Juglans regia), pistachios (Pistacia vera) and many others. They are high in nutritive value and contain high-quality protein, vitamins and minerals as well as dietary fibre. Walnuts are particularly beneficial to health and contain a higher level of antioxidants than do other nuts. A variety of nut oils are extracted by pressing for culinary use; some such as walnut, pistachio and <b>hazelnut</b> <b>oils</b> are prized for their distinctive flavours, but they tend to spoil quickly.|$|R

The major active components of olive oil include oleic acid, phenolic compounds and squalene which have different benefits such as cancer prevention, antimicrobial and antioxidant activities, and lowering the incidence of skin cancer, respectively. In recent years, the number of studies about the biochemical properties of different varieties of olive oils and their phenolic contents has dramatically increased. In this study, Turkish EVOO from different varieties and their phenolic compounds were investigated in terms of their antimicrobial and antioxidant properties as well as refined olive, <b>hazelnut</b> and canola <b>oils.</b> Antimicrobial activities of EVOOs and ten phenolic compounds were tested against three foodborne pathogenic bacteria, Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7, Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella Enteritidis which are the foremost bacterial cause of the largest number of outbreaks, cases and deaths in the world. While all EVOOs showed bactericidal effect the phenolics demonstrated slight antimicrobial activity with percent inhibition between 0 - 25 of growth rate of bacteria. Moreover, refined olive, <b>hazelnut</b> and canola <b>oils</b> did not show any antimicrobial activity. Finally, antioxidant activities of EVOOs, refined olive, <b>hazelnut</b> and canola <b>oils</b> were determined by B-carotene-linoleic acid model system and ABTS radical scavenging method.

Since the fillings are often softer than the chocolate coatings, the filling lipids can {{function as an}} activator for diffusion processes {{with the formation of}} fat bloom as a consequence. Filling lipids can merge with chocolate during production or storage. However, in most studies concerning crystallization or migration cocoa butter and <b>hazelnut</b> <b>oil</b> were analyzed, investigations on chocolate are rare. To cover a broad variety of fillings, dark chocolate was blended with <b>hazelnut</b> <b>oil,</b> butterfat, and coconut oil and crystallization was analyzed. All investigated lipids reduced the solid fat content to the same extend. However, crystallization behavior of the blended samples differed. <b>Hazelnut</b> <b>oil</b> accelerated crystallization rate and did not affect crystallization time, while butterfat reduced crystallization rate and time. The effect of coconut oil addition was in between those of <b>hazelnut</b> <b>oil</b> and butterfat. Nucleation and crystal growth rate, which affect the crystallization speed, {{have been shown to be}} affected by the type of filling lipid. Additionally, there is evidence that crystal transformation during crystallization is also affected by filling lipids. Practical applications: Based on the results of this study, manufacturers of filled chocolate products may adapt their processing parameters such as temperature and retention time in the cooling tunnel accordingly. The analytical methods may be used to control the production of confectionery and to determine filling fat concentrations in the chocolate shells of freshly produced pralines. As different filling lipids in small contents cause similar softening of chocolate shells, the solid fat content (SFC) of chocolate is an appropriate method to control filling lipid migration into chocolate.

The biodiesel yield increased with increasing temperature from 25 to 65 °C and with increasing catalyst concentration from 0. 1 to 0. 7 wt%.

Hazelnut oil-based biodiesel had an average viscosity of 8. 82 cP at 25 °C, which was slightly higher than that of the commercial soy-based diesel (7. 92 cP at 25 °C).
