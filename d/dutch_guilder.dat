However, incorporation into the Netherlands in 1815 resulted in the <b>Dutch</b> <b>guilder</b> becoming Luxembourg's currency. Following Belgium's independence from the Netherlands, the Belgian franc was adopted in 1839 and circulated in Luxembourg until 1842 and again from 1848. Between 1842 and 1848, Luxembourg (as part of the German Zollverein) used the Prussian Thaler.|$|E

40|$|The {{release of}} lead to {{drinking}} water from lead materials {{has been a}} source of concern for many years. At present, it is considered to lower the Dutch drinking water standard for lead from 50 mug/l to 10 or 15 mug/l, for toxicological reasons. This report intends to list the consequences of such a reduction, based on information provided by the water works. The conclusion of the report is that the current standard of 50 mug/l usually is not exceeded, but a lower standard of 10 or 15 mug/l will be exceeded when (non-tin-lined) lead lines are nog replaced. Replacement of lead service lines would probably cost about 250 to 300 million <b>Dutch</b> <b>guilders.</b> The replacement of lead household plumbing might cost a billion <b>Dutch</b> <b>guilders.</b> As long as lead lines are in use, softening results in a lower lead release. ...|$|R
