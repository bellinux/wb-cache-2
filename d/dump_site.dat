40|$|The {{interaction}} of dumped sediments {{with the existing}} morphological and sedimentological conditions and the recovery after cessation of dumping activities is still poorly known, especially on the long-term. We present a quantitative impact study of the dumping of dredged material on two overlapping <b>dumping</b> <b>sites,</b> situated on different morphological entities; an old <b>dumping</b> <b>site</b> closed in 1999 and located on a sandy shoal, and a new one located in a tidal swale. Chronosequential single-beam echosoundings, high-resolution multibeam bathymetrical and backscatter data, ground-truthed with boxcores and vibrocores, were used. Dumping has caused a clear depth reduction between 1995 and 2004. Different yearly growth values and sedimentation patterns were found for {{the old and new}} <b>dumping</b> <b>sites,</b> due to the difference in morphological setting. The present morphology of the old <b>dumping</b> <b>site</b> -an irregular-shaped <b>dump</b> mound, with sand piles on the edges and a depression in the centre- reflects the way of disposal. On the new <b>dumping</b> <b>site,</b> a <b>dump</b> mound is found, which is characterised by impact features such as depressions and topographic highs. After cessation of the disposal of dredged sediments on the old <b>dumping</b> <b>site,</b> the site has restored quickly its morphodynamic equilibrium. Bedforms were formed within less than one year and their distribution and corresponding sedimentology is representative for the Belgian coastal zone.

A Budweiser towel, a bloody car seat box, a wad of Harrison's hair, gloves, a plaid shirt and jeans were all found {{in the vicinity of the}} <b>dump</b> <b>site.</b> Examination of the remains indicated that the body was subjected to high temperatures, which was likely a consequence of her body remaining inside of the vehicle for a long period of time during summer weather.

It was later concluded that the fibers on Harrison's body and the carpet in the van were a likely match and records from Sears indicated that Buell had purchased the same type of car seat that was once contained in the bag and box used to conceal the body. Paint found on the jeans near the <b>dump</b> <b>site</b> matched that on the outside of Robert Anthony Buell's residence as well. The jeans themselves were similar to other pairs that he owned. Spray paint in his garage was also matched to some that was present on the box. A fingerprint on plastic concealing Harrison's body did not.|$|E

The huge waves which battered northern Somalia after the tsunami are believed to have stirred up tonnes of nuclear and toxic waste that was illegally dumped in Somali waters by several European firms – front companies created by the Italian mafia. The European Green Party followed up these revelations by presenting before the press and the European Parliament in Strasbourg copies of contracts signed by two European companies—the Italian Swiss firm, Achair Partners, and an Italian waste broker, Progresso—and representatives of the warlords then in power, to accept 10 million tonnes of toxic waste in exchange for $80 million (then about £60 million). According to a report by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) assessment mission, there are far higher than normal cases of respiratory infections, mouth ulcers and bleeding, abdominal hemorrhages and unusual skin infections among many inhabitants of the areas around the northeastern towns of Hobbio and Benadir on the Indian Ocean coast—diseases consistent with radiation sickness. UNEP continues that the current situation along the Somali coastline poses a very serious environmental hazard not only in Somalia but also in the eastern Africa sub-region.|$|E
