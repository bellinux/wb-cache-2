A {{study by the}} Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in 2010 noted that [...] "Germany, now poised to derive the greatest gains from the euro's crisis-triggered decline, should boost its domestic demand" [...] to help the periphery recover. In March 2012, Bernhard Speyer of Deutsche Bank reiterated: [...] "If the eurozone is to adjust, southern countries {{must be able to}} run trade surpluses, and that means somebody else must run deficits. One {{way to do that is}} to allow higher inflation in Germany but I don't see any willingness in the German government to tolerate that, or to accept a current account deficit." [...] According to a research paper by Credit Suisse, [...] "Solving the periphery economic imbalances does not only rest on the periphery countries' shoulders even if these countries have been asked to bear most of the burden. Part of the effort to re-balance Europe also has to been borne by Germany via its current account." [...] At the end of May 2012, the European Commission warned that an [...] "orderly unwinding of <b>intra-euro</b> <b>area</b> macroeconomic imbalances is crucial for sustainable growth and stability in the euro area," [...] and suggested Germany should [...] "contribute to rebalancing by removing unnecessary regulatory and other constraints on domestic demand". In July 2012, the IMF added its call for higher wages and prices in Germany, and for reform of parts of the country's economy to encourage more spending by its consumers.|$|E

In this paper we test whether these gains are distributed asymmetrically among Euro area countries with respect to country size.

We argue that the implications of this model do also apply to the introduction of a common currency and test for a small country bonus using aggregate trade data and disaggregated trade data at the SITC 1, SITC 2, and SITC 3 level. The results suggest that there is indeed strong evidence for a small country bonus with respect to the gains from trade after the introduction of the Euro.

40|$|Before the {{financial}} and economic crisis, monetary policy unification and interest rate convergence resulted in the divergence of euroarea countries' financial cycles. This divergence is deeply rooted in {{the financial}} integration spurred by currency union and strongly correlated with <b>intra-euro</b> <b>area</b> capital flows.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an empirical {{analysis of the}} determinants of government bond yield spreads in the euro area {{with a focus on}} developments during the global financial crisis that started in 2007. In line with the previous literature, we find that international factors, in particular general risk perception, {{play a major role in}} explaining governments bond yields differentials. Â While domestic factors such as liquidity and sovereign risk appear to be smaller but non-negligible drivers of yield spreads our results point to significant interaction of general risk aversion and macroeconomic fundamentals. Moreover, the impact of domestic factors on bond yield spreads increase significantly during the crisis, when international investors started to discriminate more between countries. In particular, the combination of high risk aversion and large current account deficits tend to magnify the incidence of deteriorated public finances on government bond yield spreads. Overall, our results suggest that an improvement in global risk perception will lead to a narrowing of <b>intra-euro</b> <b>area</b> bond yield differentials. However, the differing impact of the crisis on Member States' public finances and the expected higher risk awareness of investors after the crisis could keep government bond yield spreads at a higher level then in the pre-crisis period. sovereign bond, <b>intra-euro</b> <b>area</b> government bond spreads, spread determinants, financial crisis Barrios, Iversen, Lewandowska, Setzer...|$|E

40|$|Global {{current account}} {{imbalances}} and <b>intra-euro</b> <b>area</b> imbalances {{have been at}} the forefront of academic and policy debates for the last ten years. This thesis examines the determinants of current account balances and external adjustment. It consists of an introduction and four empirical studies. This thesis highlights the importance of institutional factors such as differences in national cultures and cross-country differences in the coordination of wage bargaining on external balances. The first study investigates the effects of deep determinants on current account balances. The point estimates are economically and statistically significant, suggesting that countries populated by Roman Catholics tend to have larger current account deficits than do non-Catholic countries. This finding is supported by microdata on values. The World Values Survey indicates that Roman Catholics do not consider thriftiness as important as other religious groups do. At the macrolevel, this finding is explained, at least to some extent, by an inclination of Catholic countries toward uncertainty avoidance. The second study examines the determinants of the speed of adjustment of the current account toward its long-run equilibrium. The rate of current account reversion decreases monotonically with the degree of coordination of wage bargaining; that is, fragmented firm-level wage bargaining facilitates external adjustment. In addition, there is a negative interaction between the effects of the coordination of wage bargaining and exchange rate stability on the rate of current account reversion. In the third and fourth studies, a country’s <b>intra-euro</b> <b>area</b> trade balance is distinguished from its trade balance with the rest of the world. The third study shows that intra-euro trade balances have not become more sensitive to differences in per-capita incomes and also suggests that a variable measuring differences in national cultures (i. e., the dimension of individualism-collectivism) has explanatory power on intra-euro trade balances over the standard economic variables. The fourth study indicates that in spite of increased integration, there remain significant differences in the long-run relations among trade balance, real effective exchange rate, domestic GDP and foreign GDP trade balance across the EMU- 12 countries...|$|E

This is consistent with indications that trade imbalances tend to be smaller when nominal exchange rates are flexible. Much of the observed increase in <b>intra-euro</b> <b>area</b> imbalances can be traced to a higher degree of persistence, some of which is linked to labor market inflexibility. Reviewing the direction of imbalances, we find evidence that bilateral trade surpluses are decreasing in the real exchange rate, decreasing in growth differentials, and increasing in the relative volatility of national business cycles.

40|$|During the {{sovereign}} debt crisis investors rebalanced out of stressed and into non-stressed euro area countries, thereby {{contributing to the}} tensions in euro area financial markets. This paper examines the geographical pattern of this great rebalancing. Specifically, we test whether euro area and non-euro area investors adjusted their holdings of debt securities of euro area stressed and non-stressed countries dis-proportionately relative to benchmarks derived from a standard gravity model for portfolio choice. We find that non-euro area investors under-invested in stressed euro area countries, but did not over-invest in non-stressed euro area countries. As regards <b>intra-euro</b> <b>area</b> flows, we do not find evidence for a disproportionate slowdown of capital flows from non-stressed into stressed euro area countries. Instead, our results suggest that investors in stressed euro area countries disproportionately shifted capital into debt securities of non-stressed euro area countries. Finally, we find that both non-euro area investors' under-investment in stressed countries and stressed euro area investors' over-investment in non-stressed euro area countries ceased after {{the announcement of the}} ECB's OMT programme...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we address}} the {{question}} of whether cross-country differences in civic capital, notably interpersonal trust, have contributed to the build-up of macroeconomic imbalances over the last three decades. We analyse the link between a stylised index of economic imbalances (a combination of the government budget balance, the inflation rate and the current account balance) and interpersonal trust, alongside other measures of civic and cultural capital, obtained from value survey data for 65 advanced and emerging countries. For the whole set of countries, we find robust empirical evidence for a negative and significant relationship between trust and macroeconomic imbalances which may therefore partly reflect underlying heterogeneity in civic capital. Within the euro area, differences in trust exist although they are not particularly large from an international perspective. With the nexus between trust and macroeonomic imbalances being equally robust we can attribute one fifth of the variation in <b>intra-euro</b> <b>area</b> imbalances to differences in interpersonal trust. Euro area membership and EU fiscal rules do not appear to have weakened the link between the two variables...|$|E

40|$|The issue: The European Union's pre-crisis growth {{performance}} was disappointing enough, but the performance has {{been even more}} dismal since {{the onset of the}} crisis. Weak growth is undermining private and public deleveraging,and is fuelling continued banking fragility. Persistently high unemployment is eroding skills, discouraging labour market participation and undermining the EU’s long-term growth potential. Low overall growth is making it much tougher for the hard-hit economies in southern Europe to recover competitiveness and regain control of their public finances. Stagnation would reduce the attractiveness of Europe for investment. Under these conditions, Europe's social models are bound to prove unsustainable. Policy Challenge: The European Union's weak long-term growth potential and unsatisfactory recovery from the crisis represent a major policy challenge. Over and above the structural reform agenda, which vitally important, bold policy action is needed. The priority is to get bank credit going. Banking problems need to be assessed properly and bank resolution and recapitalisation should be pursued. Second, fostering the reallocation of factors to the most productive firms and the sectors that contribute to aggregate rebalancing is vital. Addressing <b>intra-euro</b> <b>area</b> competitiveness divergence is essential to support growth in southern Europe.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{potential}} instabilities in the Eurozone stemming from an insufficient interplay between monetary policy and reform {{effort on the}} one hand and the emergence of <b>intra-Euro</b> <b>area</b> divergences on the other. As a first step, we assess the effect of EMU on structural reform and investigate this question by an examination of the relationship between fixed exchange rates and reform in two wider samples of countries. We also stress that loose monetary conditions, which prevailed until some months ago, can also manifest themselves in asset price inflation, notably in the housing market. When these bubbles burst (e. g., when housing prices stop rising) this often leads to a prolonged period of economic instability and weakness rather than consumer price inflation. As a second step, we point out that risks for EMU are not only increasing because longer-term disequilibria become evident in fiscal and monetary policy, but also because serious divergences are now appearing within the Euro area which threaten its long-term cohesiveness. The most manifest example of this threat comes from what promises to be a long-term divergence between Germany and Italy, which for the time being was offset by asynchronous developments of house prices in both countries. There are still large differences within the Euro area, with the small countries performing much better than the large ones on almost every indicator. This suggests that better policies can make a large difference even if monetary policy is the same for everybod...|$|E

40|$|The {{financial}} and {{economic crisis in}} the Euro area has revealed {{a number of important}} flaws in the economic policy framework in Europe. On the one hand, the imbalances, which have dominated European development since the introduction of the euro, are not sustainable; and this is more serious in a period of crisis in particular. On the other hand, it has become clear that the Euro area suffers from a serious lack of institutions and policy concepts, which will not allow coping with deep {{financial and}} economic crises unless a deep restructuring takes place. The policy reactions of European governments, the European Commission and the European Central Bank in cooperation with the IMF will, therefore, hardly be able to initiate recovery. On the one hand, some important steps towards financial stabilisation have been made. On the other hand, however, these are combined with restrictive fiscal and wage policies, which will impose deflationary pressure on major parts of the Euro area and thus prevent stabilisation (or reduction) of public debt-GDP ratios. In the paper we will first analyse the imbalances, which have been built up in the Euro area, before we briefly review the policy responses towards the crisis. Since the prescribed fiscal and wage policies are still dominated by the New Consensus Macroeconomics theoretical framework, we will then develop an alternative macroeconomic policy model based on Keynesian and Post-Keynesian principles. It will be shown that stabilising wage and active fiscal policies will have major roles to play in order to cope with the imbalances and to initiate recovery for the EU as a whole.
