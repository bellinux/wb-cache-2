Supporters of the Partisans formed a local unit and directed workers <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>fields</b> and a nearby mine. The Partisans also set up a workshop in the town to manufacture hand grenades. After their failed attack on Bogatić, the two Chetnik detachments decided to attack Banja Koviljača. Launched on 1 September, this attack was initially unsuccessful. After being reinforced by the Podrinje Partisans, the town was captured {{in the early hours}} of 6 September. In the meantime, other elements of the Podrinje Partisan Detachment had expelled the German garrison and collaborationist gendarmes from Bogatić on 3 September. On 6 October 1941, Loznica was re-occupied during the German Mačva operation.|$|E

Birju, embittered since childhood by {{the demands of}} Sukhilala, takes out his frustrations by pestering the village girls, especially Sukhilala's daughter, Rupa. Ramu, by contrast, has a calmer temperament and is married soon after. Birju's anger finally becomes dangerous and, after being provoked, he attacks Sukhilala and his daughter and steals Radha's kangan (marriage bracelets) that were pawned with Sukhilala. He is chased out of the village and becomes a bandit. Radha promises Sukhilala that she will not let Birju cause harm to Sukhilala's family. On Rupa's wedding day, Birju returns with his gang of bandits to exact his revenge. He kills Sukhilala and kidnaps Rupa. When he tries to flee the village on his horse, Radha, his mother, shoots him. He dies in her arms. The film returns to 1957; Radha opens {{the gate of the}} canal and its reddish water flows <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>fields.</b>|$|E

25|$|Exodus says {{each day}} one omer of manna was {{gathered}} per family member (about 3.64 litres), and may imply this was {{regardless of how}} much effort was put into gathering it; a midrash attributed to Rabbi Tanhuma remarks that although some were diligent enough to go <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>fields</b> to gather manna, others just lay down lazily and caught it with their outstretched hands. The Talmud states that this factor was used to solve disputes about the ownership of slaves, since the number of omers of manna each household could gather would indicate {{how many people were}} legitimately part of the household; the omers of manna for stolen slaves could be gathered only by legitimate owners, and therefore legitimate owners would have spare omers of manna.|$|E
25|$|According to the narrative, Nimrod became {{extremely}} arrogant due to {{his wealth}} and power, {{to the point that}} he made the claim that he possessed the power of creation. Claiming divinity for himself, Nimrod quarreled with Ibrahim, but the Qur'an describes that he only deepened in confusion. According to Romano-Jewish historian Flavius Josephus, Nimrod was a man who set his will against that of God. Nimrod proclaimed himself as a living god and was worshipped as such by his subjects. Nimrod's consort Semiramis was also worshipped as a goddess at his side. (See also Ninus.) Before Abraham was born, a portent in the stars tells Nimrod and his astrologers of the impending birth of Abraham, who would put an end to idolatry. Nimrod therefore orders the killing of all newborn babies. However, Abraham's mother escapes <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>fields</b> and gives birth secretly.|$|E

500|$|One day, the {{adolescent}} Tubman {{was sent to}} a dry-goods store for supplies. There, she encountered a slave owned by another family, who had left the fields without permission. His overseer, furious, demanded that she help restrain him. She refused, and as he ran away, the overseer threw a two-pound weight at him. He struck her instead, which she said [...] "broke my skull." [...] She later explained her belief that her hair – which [...] "had never been combed and...stood out like a bushel basket" [...] – might have saved her life. Bleeding and unconscious, she was returned to her owner's house and laid on the seat of a loom, where she remained without medical care for two days. She was sent back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>fields,</b> [...] "with blood and sweat rolling down my face until I couldn't see." [...] Her boss said she was [...] "not worth a sixpence" [...] and returned her to Brodess, who tried unsuccessfully to sell her. She began having seizures and would seemingly fall unconscious, although she claimed to be aware of her surroundings while appearing to be asleep. These episodes were alarming to her family, who were unable to wake her when she fell asleep suddenly and without warning. This condition remained with her {{for the rest of her}} life; Larson suggests she may have suffered from temporal lobe epilepsy as a result of the injury.|$|E
500|$|Stephen Crane's {{fiction is}} {{typically}} categorized {{as representative of}} Naturalism, American realism, Impressionism or a mixture of the three. [...] Critic Sergio Perosa, for example, wrote in his essay, [...] "Stephen Crane fra naturalismo e impressionismo," [...] that the work presents a [...] "symbiosis" [...] of Naturalistic ideals and Impressionistic methods. [...] When asked {{whether or not he}} would write an autobiography in 1896, Crane responded that he [...] "dare not say that I am honest. [...] I merely say that I am as nearly honest as a weak mental machinery will allow." [...] Similarities between the stylistic techniques in Crane's writing and Impressionist painting—including the use of color and chiaroscuro—are often cited to support the theory that Crane was not only an Impressionist but also influenced by the movement. [...] H. G. Wells remarked upon [...] "the great influence of the studio" [...] on Crane's work, quoting a passage from The Red Badge of Courage as an example: [...] "At nightfall the column broke into regimental pieces, and the fragments went <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>fields</b> to camp. Tents sprang up like strange plants. Camp fires, like red, peculiar blossoms, dotted the night.... From this little distance the many fires, with the black forms of men passing to and fro before the crimson rays, made weird and satanic effects." [...] Although no direct evidence exists that Crane formulated a precise theory of his craft, he vehemently rejected sentimentality, asserting that [...] "a story should be logical in its action and faithful to character. [...] Truth to life itself was the only test, the greatest artists were the simplest, and simple because they were true." ...|$|E
500|$|At 21:00, a lone Japanese plane dropped eight bombs, cutting {{telephone}} wires. Once it had departed, yellow flares {{went up and}} a Japanese infantry {{attack was}} launched, supported by mortar fire. Offshore, Dechaineux' destroyers came under attack from four Betty bombers. 1st Squadron, 5th Cavalry, was attacked by about two reinforced platoons, which were met by heavy automatic weapons and mortar fire. The heavy jungle in this sector permitted some infiltration but the Japanese force was {{not strong enough to}} overrun the position. The main Japanese attack was delivered by 2nd Battalion, 1st Independent Mixed Regiment, {{from the direction of the}} native skidway, together with detachments from the Porlaka area, and fell on 2ndSquadron, 5thCavalry. The troopers noticed a change in Japanese tactics. Instead of infiltrating silently, they advanced across the open, talking and in some cases singing. Their advance took them straight into anti-personnel mines and booby traps, which duly exploded, and then <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>fields</b> of fire of the Americans' automatic weapons, including several [...]30 water-cooled Browning machineguns, but the advance continued. The guns of the 211th Coast Artillery (AA) Battalion and 99th Field Artillery Battalion fired through the night, attempting to break up the Japanese attack from Porlaka. Shortly after midnight, Japanese barges attempted to cross Hyane harbour but were engaged by anti-aircraft guns and did not reach the American positions. A Bofors 40mm gun position was captured by the Japanese, who in turn were driven off by the Seabees. Manning the [...]30s, the 5thCavalry's gunners piled up the Japanese dead until the guns had to be moved to get clear fields of fire. One of the Browning guns that held the position was later left in its place, as a monument. Sergeant Troy McGill occupied a revetment with his squad of eight men. All were killed or wounded except McGill and another man, whom he ordered to fall back to the next revetment. McGill fired his rifle until it jammed, then clubbed the Japanese with it until he was killed. He was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor.|$|E
