25|$|Soon after {{deciding}} {{to focus on}} modelling, Beauchamp began a fitness regime {{in order to stay}} in shape. When this caused her breasts to sag, she made the decision to undergo breast augmentation surgery, increasing <b>her</b> <b>cup</b> size from a 32C to a 34D. After a year, finding the saline implants unsatisfactory, she underwent surgery a second time, getting slightly bigger silicone implants and increasing <b>her</b> <b>cup</b> size to 32DD. In 2009, Beauchamp went for an additional breast surgery, this time increasing the silicone implants to 800cc and <b>her</b> <b>cup</b> size 32FF. She dismisses criticism about the implants, deeming it hypocritical to applaud people for improving their intellects while condemning them for improving their bodies.|$|E
500|$|The Jet VTOL {{ship from}} Ultramans Science Patrol descends {{out of the}} sky toward Earth, as a school girl, {{carrying}} her randoseru, observes from behind a tree. The Science Patrol offer the girl a cup of water and ask her to deliver it to [...] "DAICON". The girl salutes and races away, but she quickly experiences trouble as Punk Dragon blocks her path. He summons a mecha from Starship Troopers, and it and the girl begin battling. The girl tosses the mecha aside and Gomora rises from the earth. Using a booster concealed in her backpack, the girl flies up into the sky and evades Gomora's blast, with the mecha flying after her. They continue their battle in mid-air. A blow from the mecha sends the girl falling, imperiling <b>her</b> <b>cup</b> of water. At the last moment, she has a vision of the Science Patrol and regains consciousness. She snatches the cup before it crashes to the ground. Resuming her battle with the mecha, she catches one of its missiles and hurls it back at the mecha, causing a huge explosion. The destroyed mecha launches a rocket, summoning Godzilla with the Ideon symbol. With King Ghidorah and Gamera chasing her, the girl flies through the air with her jet-propelled backpack. A Star Destroyer, a TIE fighter, and Martian fighting machines from the film The War of the Worlds (1953) cross the background. Reaching into her backpack, the girl pulls out a bamboo ruler, which magically becomes a lightsaber. After slicing an Alien Baltan in half, the girl launches a number of miniature missiles from her backpack. Hit by one of the missiles, a Maser Tank from the Godzilla series catches fire. The Atragon breaks in two as the Yamato, the USS Enterprise, an X-wing fighter and Daimajin explode in complete chaos. The girl pours <b>her</b> <b>cup</b> of water on a shriveled daikon buried in the ground. As the daikon absorbs the water, it turns into the spaceship Daicon. Bathed in light, and now wearing a naval uniform, the girl boards the ship, where the film's producers, Toshio Okada and Yasuhiro Takeda, sit at the controls. As the landing gear retracts, Daicon departs for {{the far reaches of the}} universe.|$|E
2500|$|With the recital of the Ten Plagues, each {{participant}} removes {{a drop of}} wine from his or <b>her</b> <b>cup</b> using a fingertip. Although this night is one of salvation, Don Isaac Abravanel explains that one cannot be completely joyous when some of God's creatures had to suffer. A mnemonic acronym for the plagues is also introduced: [...] "D'tzach Adash B'achav", while similarly spilling a drop of wine for each word.|$|E

2500|$|Miharu Takeshita is Yamada's {{best friend}} and classmate. She is {{described}} as [...] "dry and sarcastic", and a [...] "foil for the loud, sex-obsessed Yamada". Despite Yamada's prurient interests, she tries her best to help, even {{going so far as}} to invite Takashi and Yamada on a double date at the water park. Yamada gives her the moniker [...] "F-shita" [...] as a reference to <b>her</b> <b>cup</b> size.
