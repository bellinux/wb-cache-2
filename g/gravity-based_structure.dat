50|$|<b>Gravity-based</b> <b>structures</b> {{are also}} used for {{offshore}} wind power plants. By the end of 2010, 14 of the world's offshore wind farms were supported by <b>gravity-based</b> <b>structures.</b> The GBS are suited for water depths greater than 20 m. The deepest registered offshore wind farm with <b>gravity-based</b> <b>structures</b> is Thornton Bank 1, Belgium, with a depth up to 27.5 m. As offshore wind power plants are growing in size and moving towards deeper waters, the GBS is considered competitive in comparison with other support structures.|$|R

40|$|Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is a {{potentially}} flexible and cost-effective approach {{to study the}} interaction of waves with offshore structures. However, extensive validation is required to determine whether CFD modelling {{can be used to}} complement or even replace a physical modelling approach. Ocean, Coastal, and River Engineering (OCRE) portfolio of the National Research Council of Canada (NRC) previously conducted a series of physical hydraulic model tests to assist in designing an offshore Natural Gas processing platform to safely and optimally withstand extreme wave conditions forecasted for the deployment site. For three different wave headings (00, 330 and 900), the model was tested using a combination of long-crested regular and irregular waves as well as short-crest irregular waves for conditions associated with return periods up to 10, 000 years. The model platform was tested in several different configurations, including the steel gravity sub-structure (SGS) alone, and also with various other components (such as superstructure consisting of solid or grated decks, and wave deflectors). A large quantity of high quality data on wave run-up, airgap, forces, moments, and pressures was obtained. The present paper validates the OpenFOAM CFD toolbox for use in numerical modelling of this wave-rigid structure interaction problem. The interaction of long-crested regular waves with the structure is modelled. Global forces, overturning moments, pressures, and water levels are compared with results from the physical model. The present CFD model successfully predicts a large majority of experimental results {{with a high level of}} accuracy and proves to be a viable option for the prediction of the interaction of extreme waves with offshore <b>gravity-based</b> <b>structures.</b> Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
50|$|Condeep (abbr. {{concrete}} {{deep water}} structure) {{refers to a}} make of <b>gravity-based</b> <b>structure</b> for oil platforms developed by engineer Olav Mo in Hoeyer-Ellefsen and fabricated by Norwegian Contractors in Stavanger, Norway. A Condeep usually consists of a base of concrete oil storage tanks from which one, three or four concrete shafts rise. The Condeep base always rests on the sea floor, and the shafts rise to about 30 meters above the sea level. The platform deck itself is {{not a part of}} the construction.|$|E
50|$|A <b>gravity-based</b> <b>{{structure}}</b> (GBS) is {{a support}} structure {{held in place}} by gravity. A common application for a GBS is an offshore oil platform. These structures are often constructed in fjords since their protected area and sufficient depth are very desirable for construction. A GBS intended for use as an offshore oil platform is constructed of steel reinforced concrete, often with tanks or cells which can be used to control the buoyancy of the finished GBS. When completed, a GBS is towed to its intended location and sunk. Prior to deployment, a study of the seabed will have been done in order to ensure it can withstand the vertical load exerted on it by that structure.|$|E
5000|$|Offshore {{structures}} are mainly represented by platforms, notably jackup rigs, steel jacket structures and gravity-based structures. The {{nature of the}} seabed {{has to be taken}} into account when planning these developments. For instance, a <b>gravity-based</b> <b>structure</b> typically has a very large footprint and is relatively buoyant (because it encloses a large open volume). Under these circumstances, vertical loading of the foundation may not be as significant as the horizontal loads exerted by wave actions and transferred to the seabed. In that scenario, sliding could be the dominant mode of failure. A more specific example is that of the Woodside [...] "North Rankin A" [...] steel jacket structure offshore Australia. The shaft capacity for the piles making up each of the structure's legs was estimated on the basis of conventional design methods, notably when driven into siliceous sands. But the soil at that site was a lower capacity calcareous sand. Costly remediation measures were required to correct this oversight.|$|E
40|$|For the {{purposes}} of guiding air-gap design, wave-structure interaction is modelled using linear and 2 nd-order diffraction theory. A 4 -column <b>gravity-based</b> <b>structure</b> is considered, consisting of a subsurface caisson with 4 large-diameter columns mounted on top. The diffraction analyses are combined with the spectral response surface (SRS) method of Tromans and Vanderschuren to compute extreme surface elevation statistics. Water is predicted to reach very high elevations both close to the columns and at the geometric center of the structure. Comparisons with real wave data are made and conclusions {{on the ability of}} this approach to reproduce real wave measurements beneath a <b>gravity-based</b> <b>structure</b> are discussed.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the diffraction of water waves by offshore structures, with the ultimate aim of proposing tools for guiding airgap design. The diffraction of monochromatic waves by an array of four bottom mounted cylinders and a <b>gravity-based</b> <b>structure</b> is studied in detail using linear and second order theory. The phenomenon of near-trapping is investigated, allowing guidelines for airgap design to be established. When contemplating airgap design, however, it is crucially important that consideration is given to the largest waves in a sea state. Therefore, in this study a design wave, called NewWave, is proposed as a realistic model for large ocean waves and is used as the incident wave field in the wave-structure diffraction analysis. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|In October 1992, the Institute for Marine Dynamics (IMD) {{conducted}} {{a series of}} experiments with a 1 : 100 scale model of a <b>Gravity-Based</b> <b>Structure</b> (GBS). The experiments were performed in the Wave/Tow Tank at the Memorial University of Newfoundland (MUN). The primary purpose of the experiments was to demonstrate that the IMD has the capability to perform tow tests with waves and wind-induced moment, with measurements of model motions in six degrees of freedom, and bottom clearance in shallow water conditions. It was not intended that this be an exhaustive set of experiments which covers all combinations of drafts, tow and wind speeds, water depths, wave heights and periods, and towline geometries that might be specified in a commercial Request for Proposal. This report gives details of the model, the apparatus, and the instrumentation system. This report also defines the scope of the experiments and describes the experimental procedures, and finally outlines future experiments which would continue the study. This report presents the data in coherent form, and provides preliminary analysis of the data. This report makes suggestions for further analysis of the data and future experiments.

40|$|Sandwell Engineering Inc. and Canatec Consultants Ltd., both of Calgary, Alberta, were {{contracted}} {{to perform a}} study of Ice Regimes off the West Coast of Newfoundland. The study had two major aspects, the first was to access and document available ice and environmental data for the geographical area of investigation. The second aspect was to use this ice and environmental data to provide recommendations, where appropriate, on offshore oil/gas drilling structure concepts and structures. The study was to concentrate on data applicable to the offshore oil lease areas on the West Coast of Newfoundland. As part of the project, Canatec accessed and reviewed available environmental data for the West Coast of Newfoundland. Sandwell reviewed offshore oil production structure concepts from ice covered regions of the world. The wave and ice regimes data were used by Sandwell to estimate environmental forces on representative structure geometries. The types of geometries considered were a vertically sided <b>gravity-based</b> <b>structure</b> 100 m by 100 m and a cylindrical structure from 5 m to 20 m diameter. These two candidate geometries were selected because it is impractical to perform load estimate on the many structural concepts that have been proposed for drilling structures in ice covered waters. The candidate geometries were used to investigate, in general terms, which aspects of the environmental forces are dominant as the water depth is varied. The ice force was calculated from either the 1 in 100 year iceberg impact or from a 1 in 100 -year first-year pressure ridge. The wave force was calculated using the 1 in 100 year wave for the region. In water depths of less than approximately 30 m, the wave force is governed by the wave breaking action. As the water depth increases, the ice force remains essentially constant whereas the wave force increases. This relationship along with the calculations on the various cylindrical structures indicates that structures, which reduce the wave forces, could be considered. Examples of such geometry are multi-legged structures, monocones or monopods. Floating production systems may have difficulty in resisting the ridge ice force or the iceberg force and thus bottom-founded structures may be more appropriate for this region. A summer only production system could be investigated given the relatively long open water season. The ice and wave environment off the West Coast of Newfoundland was compared to {{other regions of the}} world. The Canadian and American Beaufort Seas have a more severe ice environment but less severe wave environment. The Grand Banks region have a more severe wave environment but the West Coat of Newfoundland has first-year pressure ridges as the significant ice event rather than iceberg impact. The wave, ice and water depths are similar to that in the Sakhalin region of the Sea of Okhotsk. This suggests that designs and concepts for that region may be applied to the West Coast of Newfoundland. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
