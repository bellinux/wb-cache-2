50|$|The other {{measurement}} {{consisted of}} the rate of mutual information transfer between the nerve signal and a broadband stimulus combined with varying levels of broadband noise uncorrelated with the signal. The power spectrum SNR could not be calculated {{in the same manner}} as before because there were signal and noise components present at the same frequencies. Mutual information measures the degree to which one signal predicts another; independent signals carry no mutual information, while perfectly identical signals carry maximal mutual information. For varying low amplitudes of signal, stochastic resonance peaks were found in plots of mutual <b>information</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>rate</b> as a function of input noise with a maximum increase in <b>information</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>rate</b> of 150%. For stronger signal amplitudes that stimulated the interneurons in the presence of no noise, however, the addition of noise always decreased the mutual information transfer demonstrating that stochastic resonance only works in the presence of low-intensity signals.

At the optimum level of noise, the cells were more likely to spike, resulting in spikes with more information and more precise temporal coherence with the stimulus.|$|E

40|$|Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs) measure brain {{signals of}} brain {{activity}} intentionally and unintentionally {{induced by the}} user, and thus provide a promising communication channel that {{does not depend on}} the brain’s normal output pathway consisting of peripheral nerves and muscles. Present-day Brain Computer Interfaces determine the intent of the user from a variety of different electrophysiological signals. They translate these signals in real-time commands that operate a computer display or other device. Successful operation requires that the user encode commands in these signals and that the BCI derive the commands from the signals. Thus, the user and the BCI system need to adapt to each other both initially and continually so as to ensure stable performance.

However, the type of stimuli used in most brain computer interface system may have a detrimental influence on the <b>information</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>rates</b> (ITR) achieved. Steady state evoked potentials (SSEP) have been well studied and applied in EEG-based BCI-systems, reaching high ITRs, {{but the number of}} SSEP-stimuli that can be applied simultaneously is limited. These responses also suffer from noise due to spontaneous oscillations that occur in the brain. In spread spectrum techniques, signals are distributed over a broader bandwidth in a pseudorandom fashion, making them much more robust against interference from noise or cross-stimulus interactions. Broadband noise signals have been successfully used in other neurological disciplines, but have remained a relatively neglected class of stimuli in BCI-systems. Spread spectrum elicited evoked potentials offer a valuable extension of the palette of AEPs and VEPs available for BCI-systems, as their favourable auto- and cross-correlation characteristics provide good anti-interference properties, which make them especially beneficial in systems using multiple simultaneously presented stimuli, like speller-setups. This thesis gives an introduction into spread spectrum techniques and the pseudorandom noise sequences used herein.

40|$|Abstract. Brain {{computer}} interfaces (BCI) {{that use}} the steady-state-visual-evoked-potential (SSVEP) as neural source, offer two main ad-vantages over other types of BCIs: shorter calibration times and higher <b>information</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>rates.</b> SSVEPs elicited by high frequency (larger than 30 Hz) repetitive visual stimulation are less prone to cause visual fatigue, safer, and more comfortable for the user. However in the high fre-quency range there is a practical limitation because only few frequencies can elicit sufficiently strong SSVEPs for BCI purposes. We bypass this limitation by using only one stimulation frequency and different phases. To detect the phase from the recorded SSVEP, we use spatial filtering combined to phase synchrony analysis. We developed an online BCI im-plementation which was tested on six subjects and resulted on an average accuracy of 95. 5 % and an average bit rate of 34 bits-per-minute.
