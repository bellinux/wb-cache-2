5000|$|Each {{line module}} unit {{converts}} analogue signals from {{a maximum of}} 64 subscriber lines in the access network to the 64 kilobit/s digital binary signals used in the core network. This is done by sampling the incoming signal {{at a rate of}} 8 kS/s and coding each sample into an 8-bit word using pulse code modulation (PCM) techniques. The line module also strips out any signalling information from the subscriber line, e.g., dialled digits, and passes this to the control unit. Up to 32 line modules are connected to a <b>digital</b> <b>concentrator</b> switch unit using 2 Mbit/s paths, giving each concentrator a capacity of up to 2048 subscriber lines. The <b>digital</b> <b>concentrator</b> switch multiplexes the signals from the line modules using time-division multiplexing and concentrates the signals onto 30 time slots on up to 32-channel high speed paths for connection to the digital local switching unit via the digital line termination units. The other two time slots on each channel are used for synchronisation and signalling.|$|E
50|$|The {{concentrator}} unit {{consists of}} four main sub-systems, line modules, <b>digital</b> <b>concentrator</b> switch, digital line termination (DLT) units and control unit. Its purpose is to convert speech from analogue signals to digital format and concentrate the traffic for onward transmission to the digital local exchange (DLE). It also receives dialled information from the subscriber and passes this to the DLE, so that the call can be routed to its destination. In normal circumstances, it does not switch signals between subscriber lines but has limited capacity to do this if connection to the DLE is lost.|$|E
40|$|The {{aim is to}} {{optimize}} the process for combined servicing of the telephone talks and data by a concentrator. The receiving and servicing process of the talks and data by a <b>digital</b> <b>concentrator</b> as a two-stream model of the queueing system has been formalized. The correlations between reception intensitites of the calls and data and also {{the number of the}} controlling device release expectation places at which the income of the telephone set administration is maximal have been chosenAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E
40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{bases for}} statistical {{control of the}} automatic telephone exchange (ATX), functions of the holding duration distribution at cancellations, models and methods {{for control of the}} "looms" with short and combined holding, multidimensional criterion for evalustion of the ATX functioning quality and also the criterion for comparison of the systems with losses and with expectation have been developed. The engineering recommendations on constructing control system in the centralized operation conditions and also the recommendations on constructing the <b>digital</b> <b>concentrators</b> have been given. The efficiency is expressed in the reduction of costs for the telephone set equipment and in the increase of concentrator use efficiency.

5000|$|Three-letter entity codes often {{begin with}} two letters to {{identify}} combinations of switching {{equipment such as}} MG (crossbar exchange - marker group), SG (step-by-step exchange - step group), CG (electronic switching system - control group), DS (<b>digital</b> switch), CT (<b>concentrator)</b> or RS (remote switcher).|$|R
5000|$|The DMS name {{arose from}} a {{designation}} for a switching matrix design {{that was developed}} in the exploratory phase of the project. The Digital Multiplexed Switch was selected as the basic switching design for the project. The product was intended as a successor for Nortel's first electronic switch the SP1 and was to be called the SP2. However the DMS acronym was mellifluous and was eventually (1975) adopted as the designation for the DMS-10 and DMS-100 family of products, with the [...] "S" [...] standing for [...] "system" [...] rather than [...] "switch". It was then applied to the entire digital switching family as well as the DMS-1 family of <b>Digital</b> Transmission <b>Concentrators.</b>|$|R
