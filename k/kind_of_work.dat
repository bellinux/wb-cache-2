5|$|Feminist economists {{join the}} UN {{and others in}} {{acknowledging}} care work, as a <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> which includes all tasks involving caregiving, as central to economic development and human well-being. Feminist economists study both paid and unpaid care work. They argue that traditional analysis of economics often ignores the value of household unpaid work. Feminist economists have argued that unpaid domestic work is as valuable as paid work, so measures of economic success should include unpaid work. They have shown that women are disproportionately responsible for performing such care work.|$|E
5|$|As far as {{possible}} elderly inmates were expected to undertake the same <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> as the younger men and women, although concessions were made to their relative frailty. They might alternatively be required to chop firewood, clean the wards, or carry out other domestic tasks. In 1882 Lady Brabazon, later the Countess of Meath, set up a project to provide alternative occupation for non-able-bodied inmates, known as the Brabazon scheme. Volunteers provided training in crafts such as knitting, embroidery and lace making, all costs initially being borne by Lady Brabazon herself. Although slow to take off, when workhouses discovered that the goods being produced were saleable and could make the enterprise self-financing, the scheme gradually spread across the country, and by 1897 {{there were more than}} 100 branches.|$|E

5|$|Caprioli's {{memorial}} {{was broken}} {{up in the}} nineteenth century, so only the Caprioli Adoration remains. A masterpiece of Cairano's, this was placed in 1841 by Rodolfo Vantini on the high altar of the St Francis of Assisi church. Cairano demonstrates a high technical mastery, {{not only in the}} extremely precise orientation of the boxes, but also in the choice of the monolithic block, which, in fact, is not strictly necessary for this <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>work.</b> From Bernardino Faino and Francesco Paglia and other seventeenth and eighteenth century scholars, we know that the relief was placed by some architectural system. It {{was supposed to be a}} figurative piece, created perhaps by the same artist, but which has not been traced.|$|E
5|$|Peter Molyneux {{stated that}} {{he came up with}} the idea of {{creating}} Theme Park because he felt the business genre was worth pursuing. He said that Theme Park is a game he had always wanted to create, and wanted to avoid the mistakes of his earlier business simulation game, The Entrepreneur: he wanted to create a business simulation game and make it fun so people would want to play it. In an interview, he explained that the primary reason he created Theme Park was because he wanted players to create their dream Theme Park. Another reason is he wanted players to understand the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> running one entails. The three difficulty settings enable players to choose the desired depth: simply having fun creating a theme park, or making all the business decisions too. Molyneux stated that the most difficult part to program was the visitors' behaviour.|$|E

25|$|Since the UCC {{prescribed}} {{a minimum}} copyright term of 25 years, chapter IV of the Fundamentals was changed accordingly. Copyright henceforth ran generally for {{the lifetime of}} the author plus 25 years, only for photographic <b>works</b> and <b>works</b> <b>of</b> applied art, there were shorter terms {{in some of the}} republics. In the Georgian SSR, these <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>works</b> were copyrighted for 20 years since their publication or creation, in the Moldavian and Uzbek SSR, for 15 years, and in Azerbaijan for ten years. In Kazakhstan, photographic works were protected for ten years and collections of photos for 15 years. These reduced terms took advantage of a provision in the UCC that set a minimum term of ten years since publication for these <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>works.</b> The law <b>of</b> the Russian SSR did not contain any such reduced copyright terms for these <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>works.</b> The new, longer copyright term only applied to works that were still copyrighted in the USSR in 1973.|$|R

25|$|Another {{aspect of}} {{community}} or collective authorship that Fitzpatrick explores {{is related to}} remix culture.

She suggests that scholars use a Creative Commons license for scholarly work to facilitate the use and reuse of material for the collective benefit of the community.|$|E
