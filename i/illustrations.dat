5|$|Convinced {{the book}} would be popular, Jewett made the unusual {{decision}} (for the time) to have six full-page <b>illustrations</b> by Hammatt Billings engraved {{for the first}} printing.

5|$|As {{printing}} became available, it {{was promptly}} used to publish herbals, the first printed matter being known as incunabula. In Europe, the first printed herbal with woodcut (xylograph) <b>illustrations,</b> the Puch der Natur of Konrad of Megenberg, appeared in 1475. Metal-engraved plates were first used in about 1580. As woodcuts and metal engravings could be reproduced indefinitely they were traded among printers: there was therefore a large {{increase in the}} number of <b>illustrations</b> together with an improvement in quality and detail but a tendency for repetition.|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I explore {{the role and}} {{significance}} of editorial <b>illustration,</b> developed in printed publications and evolving within online publishing structures. Editorial <b>illustration</b> {{has a long tradition}} of illustrating stories in news publications, but I argue that in current online news websites its particular role has all but failed. Online publishing has become the driving force within editorial publishing and this raises the question whether, and how, editorial <b>illustration</b> can continue to be a successful constituent in an online publishing environment? I argue that the continuation of editorial <b>illustration</b> lies within digitally native narrative forms, from online interactive documentaries, game-based storytelling, data-visualisation to memes: viral images spread through social media. Within these forms the significance and agency of <b>illustration</b> is not only clearly present but evolving, except here <b>illustration</b> is interwoven with the story. I argue that these forms of <b>illustration,</b> as well as printed <b>illustration,</b> are based on the same conceptual model and articulate editorial illustration’s inherent attributes. I propose a constellation of four attributes (manifestation, translation, reflection, and engagement) that together give rise to the key quality that <b>illustration</b> offers to the reader, deliberation. <b>Illustration</b> should not be understood as a separate artifact, positioned next to a text, but as a multimodal practice, always related to a story, enabled by the specific qualities of its contextualizing medium. As practice-led research, the thesis explores this proposition in practice and theory within printed and online forms of editorial <b>illustration</b> and in relation to online media technologies and material properties. Central is the development of a potential method of online editorial <b>illustration</b> that I call data driven <b>illustration,</b> a formation employing the material and semiotic expressive potential of live data and code. The research draws primarily from the ideas of media materiality (Hayles, Kittler, Manovich), but in doing so is supplemented with other relevant theories found in semiotics (Barthes, Hayles, Kress and van Leeuwen) and audience reception (Hall). This interdisciplinary approach is applied to the field of <b>illustration</b> through a historical study of wood-engraved news <b>illustration</b> in the Illustrated London News; through my own practice as an illustrator, in this case, work undertaken for the NRC newspaper; and explorations of various examples of online <b>illustration.</b> This thesis offers a first step in constructing a framework for editorial <b>illustration,</b> to move beyond the print paradigm and provide a language through which to explore <b>illustration</b> as an emergent practice...|$|R
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1914, Beebe's {{pheasant}} monograph {{was essentially}} complete in manuscript. While the text was written by Beebe, the <b>illustrations</b> were provided by several artists: Robert Bruce Horsfall, who had accompanied Beebe on the expedition, painted the environmental scenes for the illustrations' backgrounds, while the pheasants themselves were painted by other artists including George Edward Lodge, Charles R. Knight, and Louis Agassiz Fuertes. Due to the elaborate nature of the book's color artwork, no American publisher was considered capable of reproducing it. The publisher which Beebe chose for his work was George Witherby and Sons of London, {{as a result of}} their success publishing the artwork of John James Audubon. The reproduction of the <b>illustrations</b> themselves was to be handled by several companies in Germany and Austria. Reproductions of the <b>illustrations</b> were in the process of being printed when World War I began, holding up the completion of the project for the next four years.|$|E
