50|$|The {{centerpiece}} of the <b>Instrument</b> <b>Room</b> is the large electrostatic generator built by John Cuthbertson in 1784. This apparatus is the largest flat-plate electrostatic generator {{of the world and}} the oldest piece in the room itself, which is filled mostly with items from the 19th century. Surrounding this centerpiece are 10 numbered cabinets filled with instruments accompanied by numbered cards that can be cross-referenced to a guide located in the room.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Instrument</b> <b>Room</b> is {{a room in}} Teylers Museum {{which houses}} {{a part of the}} museum's Cabinet of Physics: a {{collection}} of scientific instruments from the 18th and 19th centuries. The instruments in the collection were used for research as well as for educational public demonstrations. Most of them are demonstration models that illustrate various aspects of electricity, acoustics, light, magnetism, thermodynamics, and weights and measures. The rest are high-quality precision instruments that were used for research.|$|E

50|$|While Mayall {{hoped to}} join the Mount Wilson team upon earning his doctorate, there were no {{openings}} during the Great Depression. Instead, {{he began his career}} at Lick, which was afforded by the number two janitor resigning and Mayall being given a one-year position as observing assistant with janitorial duties limited to maintaining the darkrooms and keeping <b>instrument</b> <b>rooms</b> clean. The following year, one of the senior astronomers joined the Berkeley department and his salary was split between Mayall and another young astronomer, Arthur Bambridge Wyse.|$|R

50|$|The Hilda Lindley House {{was built}} by the Army {{at a cost of}} about $22,000. The two-story structure, {{standing}} on a hill about 87 feet above mean low tide and approximately a half-mile back from the beach, contained two instrument rooms on the ground floor and another <b>instrument</b> <b>room</b> on the second floor, where soldiers used azimuth telescopes to look for enemy shipping on Block Island Sound. The soldiers looked through the fire control station’s characteristic mullioned observation slots — long, narrow windows with vertical supports.|$|E
50|$|The Greek Revival-style {{observatory}} {{building was}} completed in 1844, though the equatorial mounted Troughton & Simms 8 in refracting telescope was not mounted until 1849. The observation room was built with a large central section, capped by a revolving 18 ft diameter dome. At {{the west end of}} the building was a transit <b>instrument</b> <b>room</b> with a north-south slit in the roof. Opposite the transit room was an office. The transit room contained a Troughton and Simms transit circle with a 4 in objective and a focal length of 5 ft. It used a 4 ft circle, readable to a single arc second.|$|E
50|$|The large {{electrostatic}} generator (Dutch: Van Marum electriseermachine) {{is a large}} handcrafted electromechanical instrument designed by Martin van Marum and built by John Cuthbertson in 1784 for the Teylers Museum in Haarlem, where it forms {{the centerpiece of the}} <b>instrument</b> <b>room.</b> The concept of an {{electrostatic generator}} was new, and the battery (array) of leiden jars was the largest ever built (only one of the 4 sets of leiden jars is on display to conserve space). The two glass disks of the generator are 1.65 meters in diameter, and the machine is capable of generating a potential of 330,000 volts.|$|E
50|$|The {{basement}} comprises {{storage rooms}} for pianos and 300 percussion <b>instruments.</b> All <b>rooms</b> {{are connected to}} the same ventilation system used by the recording stages, so the stored instruments are always pre-acclimated for recording. An elevator connects the storage rooms directly with Stage A.|$|R

50|$|Finished in 2008, Steinbrenner Band Hall is The Pride of the Sunshine's {{rehearsal}} hall, {{and also}} houses offices, instrument storage, the band library and an <b>instrument</b> issue <b>room.</b> Construction {{of the band}} hall {{was made possible by}} a generous gift from George Steinbrenner and his wife Joan in 2002.|$|R
50|$|The {{staff at}} Montgomery station {{requested}} clearance for the stopping train {{to run to}} Abermule, and Signalman Jones pressed the release on the tablet instrument for the Montgomery-Abermule section, allowing the train to proceed. He then checked that the express was running to time, and was informed that it had just passed Moat Lane Junction {{on the far side}} of Newtown, as scheduled. Jones went to the signal box to open the level crossing gates and clear the signals for the stopping train. Meanwhile, Relief Stationmaster Lewis returned from his lunch. A permanent way sub-inspector attracted his attention with an urgent enquiry, and the stationmaster immediately went with the sub-inspector to the goods yard, without entering the <b>instrument</b> <b>room</b> or inquiring as to the position of any trains approaching Abermule.|$|E
5000|$|Cahill built three versions: The Mark I version weighed 7 tons. The Mark II version weighed almost 200 tons, {{as did the}} Mark III. Each was a {{considerable}} advancement over the features of its predecessor. A small number of performances {{in front of a}} live audience were given in addition to the telephone transmissions. Performances in New York City (some at [...] "Telharmonic Hall", 39th and Broadway) were well received by the public in 1906, and the performer would sit at a console (see picture) to control the instrument. The actual mechanism of the instrument itself was so large it occupied an entire room [...] - [...] wires from the controlling console were fed discreetly through holes in the floor of an auditorium into the <b>instrument</b> <b>room</b> itself, which was housed in the basement beneath the concert hall.|$|E
50|$|Originally {{all of the}} museum's {{collections}} were {{housed in}} the Oval Room from 1784. The electricity instrument demonstrations tended {{to make a lot}} of noise and distracted the readers of the books in the gallery, and after the mineralogical cabinet was built for the center of the room, demonstrations there became more difficult and a new demonstration and lecture room was built on the north side (today the Print room). This new room shared its purpose with the art gallery but as the number of instrument cabinets increased, was felt to be too dark, leading to the creation of a separate painting gallery in 1838. The current <b>instrument</b> <b>room</b> was built as part of an 1880-1885 extension of the museum, designed to have daylight from both sides for better viewing of the experiments. It is located between the Fossil Room II and the Oval Room.|$|E
40|$|To support multi-disciplinary {{research}} in the AMI (Augmented Multi-party Interaction) project, a 100 hour corpus of meetings is being collected. This corpus is being recorded in several <b>instrumented</b> <b>rooms</b> equipped {{with a variety of}} microphones, video cameras, electronic pens, presentation slide capture and white-board capture devices. As well as real meetings, the corpus contains a significant proportion of scenario-driven meetings, which have been designed to elicit a rich range of realistic behaviors. To facilitate research, the raw data are being annotated at a number of levels including speech transcriptions, dialogue acts and summaries. The corpus is being distributed using a web server designed to allow convenient browsing and download of multimedia content and associated annotations. This article first overviews AMI research themes, then discusses corpus design, as well as data collection, annotation and distribution...|$|R
