40|$|Video {{techniques}} {{were used to}} study the coordination of different flagella on single filamentous cells of Escherichia coli. Filamentous, nonseptate cells were produced by introducing a cell division mutation into a strain that was polyhook but otherwise wild type for chemotaxis. Markers for its flagellar motors (ordinary polyhook cells that had been fixed with glutaraldehyde) were attached with antihook antibodies. The markers were driven alternately clockwise and counterclockwise, at angular velocities comparable to those observed when wild-type cells are tethered to glass. The <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> <b>rotation</b> <b>of</b> different markers on the same cell were not correlated; reversals of the flagellar motors occurred asynchronously. The bias of the motors (the fraction of time spent spinning counterclockwise) changed with time. Variations in bias were correlated, provided that the motors were within a few micrometers of one another. Thus, although the <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> <b>rotation</b> <b>of</b> flagellar motors are not controlled by a common intracellular signal, their biases are. This signal {{appears to have a}} limited range...|$|R

25|$|A commutated {{electrically}} excited series or parallel wound motor {{is referred}} to as a universal motor because it can be designed to operate on AC or DC power. A universal motor can operate well on AC because the current in both the field and the armature coils (and hence the resultant magnetic fields) will alternate (reverse polarity) in synchronism, and hence the resulting mechanical force will occur in a constant <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>rotation.</b>|$|E

25|$|In two dimensions, {{the angular}} {{velocity}} {{is a single}} number with an orientation but no direction. The angular velocity in two dimensions is a pseudoscalar, a quantity that changes its sign under a parity inversion (for example {{if one of the}} axes is inverted or if axes are swapped). The positive <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>rotation</b> is taken, by convention, to be in the direction towards the y axis from the x axis. If the parity is inverted, but the orientation of a rotation is not, then the sign of the angular velocity changes.|$|E

25|$|Although now obsolete, CRT {{computer}} displays {{suffered from}} reflection {{by the glass}} envelope, causing glare from room lights and consequently poor contrast. Several anti-reflection solutions were employed to ameliorate this problem. One solution utilized the principle of reflection of circularly polarized light. A circular polarizing filter {{in front of the}} screen allows for the transmission of (say) only right circularly polarized room light. Now, right circularly polarized light (depending on the convention used) has its electric (and magnetic) field direction rotating clockwise while propagating in the +z direction. Upon reflection, the field still has the same <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>rotation,</b> but now propagation is in the −z direction making the reflected wave left circularly polarized. With the right circular polarization filter placed in front of the reflecting glass, the unwanted light reflected from the glass will thus be in very polarization state that is blocked by that filter, eliminating the reflection problem. The reversal of circular polarization on reflection and elimination of reflections in this manner can be easily observed by looking in a mirror while wearing 3-D movie glasses which employ left- and right-handed circular polarization in the two lenses. Closing one eye, the other eye will see a reflection in which it cannot see itself; that lens appears black. However the other lens (of the closed eye) will have the correct circular polarization allowing the closed eye to be easily seen by the open one.|$|E

Its <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>rotation</b> is not certain at present, due to a twofold {{ambiguity}} in lightcurve data that is exacerbated by its long rotation period—which makes single-night telescope observations span at best {{only a fraction of}} a full rotation—but it is believed to be retrograde. [...] Lightcurve analysis indicates that Hygiea's pole points towards either ecliptic coordinates (β, λ) = (30°, 115°) or (30°, 300°) with a 10° uncertainty.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of {{function of the}} bacterial flagellar switch, which determines the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> flagellar <b>rotation</b> and is essential for chemotaxis, has remained an enigma for many years. Here we show that the switch complex associates with the membrane-bound respiratory protein fumarate reductase (FRD). We provide evidence that FRD binds to preparations of isolated switch complexes, forms a 1 : 1 complex with the switch protein FliG, and that this interaction is required for both flagellar assembly and switching the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> flagellar <b>rotation.</b> We further show that fumarate, {{known to be a}} clockwise/switch factor, affects the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> flagellar <b>rotation</b> through FRD.
