Evans later stated that he felt his admission of having only trained for ten days had lowered his standing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> the selectors.

5|$|Membership in B'nai Israel was {{restricted}} to men, and attendance at the (at least) quarterly meetings was mandatory. Men who missed a meeting without a reasonable excuse were fined.
