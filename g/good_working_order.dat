25|$|Captains, mates (officers), and pilots {{supervise}} ship {{operations on}} domestic waterways {{and the high}} seas. A captain (master) is in overall command of a vessel, and supervises the work of other officers and crew. A captain {{has the ability to}} take the conn from a mate or pilot at any time he feels the need. On smaller vessels the captain may be a regular watch-stander, similar to a mate, directly controlling the vessel's position. Captains and department heads ensure that proper procedures and safety practices are followed, ensure that machinery is in <b>good</b> <b>working</b> <b>order,</b> and oversee the loading and discharging of cargo and passengers. Captains directly communicate with the company or command (MSC), and are overall responsible for cargo, various logs, ship's documents, credentials, efforts at controlling pollution and passengers carried.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{phenomenon}} {{associated with}} HID lamp wear and aging is discoloration of the emitted light beam ("fading"). Commonly, a shift towards blue and/or violet can be observed. This shift is slight {{at first and}} is more generally {{a sign of the}} lamps being [...] "broken in" [...] whilst still being in <b>good</b> overall <b>working</b> <b>order,</b> but towards the end of its life, the HID lamp is often perceived as only producing blue and violet light. Based on Planck's law, this {{is a direct result of}} the increased voltage and higher temperature necessary to maintain the arc.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} was to explore the attitudes toward social {{documentation}} held by care personnel, as well as factors that could {{have an impact on}} the process of social documentation. The study is based on a survey encompassing 100 respondents working as care personnel at six different eldercare units at Kungsholmen in Stockholm. The data was analyzed by quantitative methods, using a statistical software package (SPSS).   The main questions in the study are whether the respondents know how, what and why they should document, what obstacles they experience and what they would need in order to document more or better, as well as whether there are factors that influence their attitudes and knowledge regarding documentation.   The key results show that more time is the most common need, and lack of time the most common obstacle to social documentation reported by the respondents. Furthermore, the results show that those who report that they are satisfied with their working conditions are most likely to also report that they know how and why social documentation should be conducted. These results suggest that it is urgent for organizations to create <b>good</b> <b>working</b> conditions in <b>order</b> to increase motivation for social documentation.   The results are analyzed using organizational theories. Additionally, we discuss the experiences reported by the personnel from a historical perspective...|$|R
25|$|The {{purpose of}} dive {{planning}} {{is to ensure}} that divers do not exceed their comfort zone or skill level, or the safe capacity of their equipment, and includes scuba gas planning to ensure that the amount of breathing gas to be carried is sufficient to allow for any reasonably foreseeable contingencies. Before starting a dive both the diver and their buddy do equipment checks to ensure everything is in <b>good</b> <b>working</b> <b>order</b> and available. Recreational divers are responsible for planning their own dives, unless in training, when the instructor is responsible. Divemasters may provide useful information and suggestions to assist the divers, but are generally not responsible for the details unless specifically employed to do so. In professional diving teams all team members are usually expected to contribute to planning and to check the equipment they will use, but the overall responsibility {{for the safety of the}} team lies with the supervisor.|$|E
25|$|The King's County coroner, Henry C. Simms, {{convened a}} jury on the {{disaster}} which heard testimony through December and January 1877. When {{it was published}} {{at the end of}} January 1877, it was especially harsh on the theatrical managers, Sheridan Shook and A. M. Palmer. The jury held Shook and Palmer responsible for failing to take adequate precautions against fire, failing to train stage hands in either fire prevention or the management of incipient fires, failing to establish clear chains of command in the theatre's management, permitting the stage to become cluttered with properties and failing to maintain in <b>good</b> <b>working</b> <b>order</b> fire fighting equipment and emergency exits that had originally been installed. The jury found lesser fault with the design of the building, observing that the five-year-old structure had better exits than many other public buildings in the city. Fault was found with the stairways leading to the family circle and the auditorium, which lacked a firewall between the audience and the stage. In delivering the verdict, the jury reported that death occurred mainly through suffocation in the dense smoke that prevailed in the gallery, likely in the few minutes after Charles Vine dropped from the family circle to the balcony below.|$|E
500|$|In 1869, stone barracks {{were built}} to sleep up to 50 men. However, the 1881 Census for Flat Holm {{shows that the}} barracks were {{occupied}} only by the Master Gunner, Thomas Barrett, his family, and five soldiers. Barrett's son, Albert, was born on the island on 31 December 1881. The men were stationed on the island to keep the guns in <b>good</b> <b>working</b> <b>order</b> but the garrison would have been reinforced by regular artillery and volunteer troops if ever an invasion had been imminent. The barracks for the battery were located near the southernmost battery emplacement. Other fortifications included a large drainage basin, underground storage tank, an administrative building and a secure store. A [...] "ditch-and-bank" [...] system served to protect the Lighthouse Battery from cross-island attack. The barracks were vacated in 1901 and the buildings have now been restored by the Flat Holm Project for educational use.|$|E

40|$|We use a {{sensemaking}} lens {{to explore}} how women managers experience and articulate work–life concerns upon their return to paid work following maternity leaves. We focus on 11 women who held different types of managerial positions, including vice presidents, circulation managers, and human resources experts. We found that our participants re‐framed the good mother image into a <b>good</b> <b>working</b> mother role that fit their lifestyles and interests. To accomplish this reframing, participants engaged in three thematic processes supportive of the <b>good</b> <b>working</b> mother image: (a) <b>good</b> <b>working</b> mothers arrange quality child care; (b) <b>good</b> <b>working</b> mothers are (un) equal partners; and (c) <b>good</b> <b>working</b> mothers feel pleasure in their working mother role. These themes and image were both ironic and fragile constructions of working motherhood. Because these themes and images enable participants {{to make sense of}} and establish the worth of working motherhood to family members, friends, acquaintances, organizational members, and community members, they provide a reason why middle‐ or upper‐class working and stay‐at‐home mothers may be in conflict about work and family choices...|$|R

2500|$|In {{an effort}} to relieve the sick man from {{the heat of a}} Washington summer, Navy {{engineers}} rigged up an early version of the modern air conditioner. Fans blew air over a large box of ice and into the President's sickroom; the device worked well enough to lower the temperature twenty degrees. Doctors continued to probe Garfield's wound with dirty, unsterilized fingers and instruments, attempting to find the location of the bullet. Alexander Graham Bell devised a metal detector specifically for the purpose of finding the bullet lodged inside Garfield. [...] He was unsuccessful, partly because Garfield's metal bed frame made the instrument malfunction, and partly because Bliss allowed Bell to use the device only on Garfield's right side, where Bliss insisted the bullet had lodged. Bell's subsequent tests indicated that his metal detector was in <b>good</b> <b>working</b> <b>order,</b> and that he would have found the bullet had he been allowed to use the device on Garfield's left side.|$|E
2500|$|The {{availability}} of multiple shots offered by Colt's rifle {{was seen as}} an advantage against the Seminole warriors, who had learned the vulnerability of troops who had already fired the conventional single-shot military arms of the day. [...] Reports of use in combat illustrated the delicate and complicated construction of the rifles, which easily put them out of service. [...] Although the guns were not perfect and prone to defect, the use of the new weapons against the Seminoles yielded significant gains. [...] In 1839, nearly a year after acquiring fifty First Model rifles, Colonel Harney remarked that all but two were in <b>good</b> <b>working</b> <b>order.</b> [...] Later in July 1839, however, a surprise Seminole attack led to the loss of thirty Ring Lever rifles, though fourteen were eventually recovered. [...] In spite of the rifle's reliability problems, support for Colt's rifles was garnered from field officers, especially from Lieutenant Colonel Harney. [...] Harney commented on Colt's Ring Lever rifle favorably, stating: [...] "I honestly believe that, but for these arms, the Indians would now be luxuriating in the Everglades of Florida." ...|$|E

2500|$|After an {{incident}} in which an aircraft with 145 people on board was lost for hours, eventually making an emergency landing in West Sumba, East Nusa Tenggara, some 525 kilometers away from its intended destination, the pilots blamed a malfunctioning navigation system. Adam Air claimed the equipment to be in <b>good</b> <b>working</b> <b>order,</b> and had the pilots arrested on charges of endangering passenger safety. Immediately after the incident, the Directorate General of Air Communications (DGAC) sent instructions to Adam Air to repair the faulty system. Adam Air was then required to conduct a total of 13 test flights with DGAC inspectors aboard before the aircraft could be returned to commercial service. Adam Air instead left behind a team from the National Transportation Safety Committee (KNKT), who {{they were supposed to}} transport to the site, and sent only their own engineers. According to Adam Air, they repaired the fault, and the aircraft was immediately returned to service without any inspection. Iksan Tatang, director general of air transportation, said the incident was [...] "a serious violation", and promised a full investigation. However, no sign of the investigation's findings exists on the public record, and it is unclear whether the investigation took place at all. Critics say Adam Air used its political connections to sidestep aviation authorities.|$|E
