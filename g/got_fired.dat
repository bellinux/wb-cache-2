25|$|At the time, Lai Min's old debating rival, Meng Guang, was as equally {{notorious for}} being {{unbridled}} {{in his speech}} and was, in some ways, worse than Lai Min in this regard. Meng Guang not only carelessly divulged state secrets (probably due to a slip of the tongue), but also discussed politics in an inappropriate setting. Nevertheless, both of them got off lightly because they held much prestige among the literati for their status as learned Confucian scholars. Lai Min, in particular, came from an elite family background and had previously served as an attendant to the Shu emperor Liu Shan when the emperor was still crown prince, therefore {{he was able to}} return to service every time after he <b>got</b> <b>fired.</b>|$|E
25|$|Social {{networking}} {{sites have}} created issues among getting hired {{for jobs and}} losing jobs because of exposing inappropriate content, posting photos of embarrassing situations or posting comments that contain potentially offensive comments (e.g., racist, homophobic or defamatory comments), or even political comments that are contrary {{to those of the}} employer. There are works which recommend friends to social networking users based on their political opinions. Many people use social networking sites to express their personal opinions about current events and news issues to their friends. If a potential applicant expresses personal opinions on political issues or makes potentially embarrassing posts online on a publicly available social networking platform, employers can access their employees' and applicants' profiles, and judge them based on their social behavior or political views. According to Silicon Republic's statistics, 17,000 young people in six countries were interviewed in a survey. 1 in 10 people aged 16 to 34 have been rejected for a job because of comments made on an online profile. This shows the effects that social networks have had on people's lives. There have been numerous cases where employees have lost jobs because their opinions represented their companies negatively. In September 2013, a woman <b>got</b> <b>fired</b> over Facebook because she posted disruptive information about her company stating that military patrons should not receive special treatment or discounts. A manager of the company found her opinion online, disagreed with it, and fired her because it went against the company's mission statement. In November 2012, a woman posted a racist remark about the President of the United States and mentioned a possible assassination. She lost her job, and was put under investigation by the Secret Service.|$|E

[...] Peckinpah's version was to be shot in black-and-white to give the film a 1930s period feel.

At the plant, Homer is often ignored and completely forgotten by his boss Mr. Burns, and constantly falls asleep and neglects his duties. Matt Groening has stated that he decided to have Homer work at the power plant because of the potential for Homer to wreak havoc. Each of his other jobs has lasted only one episode. In {{the first half of the}} series, the writers developed an explanation about how he <b>got</b> <b>fired</b> from the plant and was then rehired in every episode.

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by series creator Matt Groening, the lone episode (discounting the Tracey Ullman shorts) in which he {{received}} an individual writing credit, though he has co-written for the episodes [...] "Some Enchanted Evening", [...] "The Telltale Head", and [...] "22 Short Films About Springfield". [...] "Colonel Homer" [...] was partly based on the 1980 film Coal Miner's Daughter, which {{tells the story of}} country music singer Loretta Lynn. Groening said he had always wanted to write an episode in which Homer is offered a chance at being rich and famous, other than being with his family, but then chooses his family over glamour at the end. He pitched the idea to the writers of the show, who suggested the parody of Coal Miner's Daughter and also that Homer should become a manager for a country singer. Show runner Mike Reiss was originally skeptical about the episode, as he did not think Homer could get a new job when he already had a full-time job at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. Reiss eventually gave in, but in future episodes the writers tried to develop the explanation that he <b>got</b> <b>fired</b> from the plant and then rehired at the end. Groening said that during the episode production, he received comments from the production team that Homer was acting like a [...] "jerk" [...] in it, but his explanation was that Homer's behavior was due to his desire to make Lurleen a star and he was oblivious to her attempts to seduce him until the end. Mike Reiss stated that [...] "Whenever we want to write stories about characters getting divorced or actually having an affair, rather than with Homer and Marge, which we could never do, we use secondary characters for that." ...|$|E
