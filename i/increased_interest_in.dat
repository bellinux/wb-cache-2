In later years, a number of authors of biographies or literary analyses of Tolkien conclude that during his writing of The Lord of the Rings, Tolkien gained <b>increased</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> the value of wild and untamed nature, and in protecting what wild nature was left in the industrialized world.|$|E
5|$|Federer {{helped to}} lead a revival in tennis known {{by many as the}} Golden Age. This led to <b>increased</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> the sport, which in turn led to higher {{revenues}} for many venues across tennis.

Over its long history, it has expanded as necessary to reflect the <b>increased</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> black culture. This willingness to adapt has allowed it to survive while other museums faltered due to a weakening economy and decreased public support. The museum was the eighth one located on Park District land. Although it focuses on exhibiting African American culture, it is one of several Chicago museums that celebrates Chicago's ethnic and cultural heritage.|$|E

Since its introduction, the allowance of percussion instruments has <b>increased</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> the competition among young people. The competition has five stages, which consist of regional auditions, category auditions, category finals, semi-finals and the final. The biennial competition is managed and produced by BBC Cymru Wales.|$|E

Although the TV show Storage Wars created <b>increased</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> the auctions, most units do not contain anything of substantial economic value.

In 2007, a customer's belongings were auctioned for non-payment while he was serving the US military in Iraq. After receiving negative publicity, Public Storage apologized and gave him $8,000 as compensation for his sold belongings.|$|E

The history of childhood emerged as a sub-discipline of history during the 1960s, and other disciplines such as the study of ancient medicine have been influenced by feminist approaches to the classics.|$|E
5|$|Born {{and raised}} in Los Angeles, Monroe {{spent most of her}} {{childhood}} in foster homes and an orphanage and married at the age of sixteen. While working in a radioplane factory in 1944 as part of the war effort, she was introduced to a photographer from the First Motion Picture Unit and began a successful pin-up modeling career. The work led to short-lived film contracts with Twentieth Century-Fox (1946–1947) and Columbia Pictures (1948). After a series of minor film roles, she signed a new contract with Fox in 1951. Over the next two years, she became a popular actress with roles in several comedies, including As Young as You Feel and Monkey Business, and in the dramas Clash by Night and Don't Bother to Knock. Monroe faced a scandal when it was revealed that she had posed for nude photos before becoming a star, but rather than damaging her career, the story resulted in <b>increased</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> her films.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{low gross}} on its initial release, Manhunter grew in {{popularity}} by the 2000s {{and has been}} mentioned in several books and lists of cult films. These reappraisals often cite the success of Silence of the Lambs and its sequels {{as the reason for}} the <b>increased</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> Manhunter, while still favoring the earlier film over its successors. Telling of this resurgence in appreciation are the film's ratings on review aggregation sites such as Metacritic or Rotten Tomatoes. Compiled mostly from reviews written decades after its original release, Manhunter has a metascore of 78 on Metacritic, based on ten reviews, and a 94% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes, from 33 reviews.|$|E
5|$|In 1928, Joehana {{opened the}} Romans Bureau, which was advertised as {{offering}} {{a variety of}} services, including the writing and printing of advertisements, translations (from or into English, Dutch, Malay, and Sundanese), and the preparation of story concepts for other writers. Joehana may have also opened a writing course, although apparently most of his income {{was derived from the}} royalties of his publications. These publications, particularly his novels, were generally inspired by the types of works that were popular at the time of writing. One of his students, Abdullah Syafi'i Sukandi, recalled that Nangis Wibisana (The Tears of Wibisana) had been written when the dangding (a traditional lyrical form) Tjeurik Oma (Oma's Cry) was popular, whereas Goenoeng Gelenjoe (The Smiling Mountain) had been written during a period of <b>increased</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> humorous anecdotes.|$|E
5|$|Rimsky-Korsakov {{eventually}} became an excellent {{teacher and a}} fervent believer in academic training. He revised everything he had composed prior to 1874, even acclaimed works such as Sadko and Antar, {{in a search for}} perfection that would remain with him throughout the rest of his life. Assigned to rehearse the Orchestra Class, he mastered the art of conducting. Dealing with orchestral textures as a conductor, and making suitable arrangements of musical works for the Orchestra Class, led to an <b>increased</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> the art of orchestration, an area into which he would further indulge his studies as Inspector of Navy Bands. The score of his Third Symphony, written just after he had completed his three-year program of self-improvement, reflects his hands-on experience with the orchestra.|$|E
