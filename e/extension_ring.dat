SOLSE is intended to perform ozone distribution that a nadir instrument can achieve. This will be performed using Charged Coupled Device (CCD) technology to eliminate moving parts in a simpler, low cost, ozone mapping instrument. The experiment is housed in a Hitchhiker (HH/GAS) canister with canister <b>extension</b> <b>ring</b> and equipped with a Hitchhiker Motorized Door Assembly (HMDA). Instrumentation includes an Ultraviolet (UV) spectrograph with a CCD array detector, CCD array and visible light cameras, calibration lamp, optics and baffling. Once on orbit a crew member will active SOLSE which will perform limb and Earth viewing observations. Limb observations focuses on the region 20 km to 50 km altitude above the horizon for the Earth's surface. Earth viewing observations will enable SOLSE to correlate the data with other nadir viewing, ozone instruments.|$|E

Inside the heating chamber, multi-level metal racks are used to elevate the contents during the cooking process. Within the heating assembly are the circular halogen lamp, a fan, and the controls for the oven which frequently include an automatic shut-off timer and a temperature control interface. On a basic model, the heating assembly has a handle to allow users to safely lift the lid off the unit. More elaborate models have a hinged lid mounted on an adjustable rear support which can be raised to accommodate an <b>extension</b> <b>ring.</b> This raises the heating assembly to reduce the grilling effect as well as increasing {{the volume of the}} oven. Hinged models are safer and easier to use. A safety shut-off switch turns off the lamp when the lid is raised during operation. The glass bowl is positioned in a stand which raises the bowl off the table-top and decreases the transfer of heat to the surrounding surfaces. Handles are often incorporated into the stand to allow for users to move the unit, providing safety especially during or after operation.|$|E

The main question considered in this paper is whether there exists a finite integral <b>extension</b> <b>ring</b> A of R for which the nilradical of IA is a projectively full ideal that is projectively equivalent to IA. A related and stronger question that we also consider is whether there exists a finite integral <b>extension</b> <b>ring</b> A of R for which the nilradical J of IA is projectively equivalent to IA and for which all the Rees integers of J are one. The following two results are special cases of the main theorems in the present paper: (1) If R is a Noetherian integral domain, then there exists a finite integral <b>extension</b> <b>ring</b> A of R such that the nilradical of IA is projectively equivalent to IA. (2) If also R contains a field of characteristic zero, then there exists a finite free integral <b>extension</b> <b>ring</b> A of R for which the nilradical of IA is a projectively full ideal that is projectively equivalent to IA...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Given a {{polynomial}} f with coefficients from a field F, is {{it easier}} to compute f over an <b>extension</b> <b>ring</b> R than over F? We address this question, and show the following. For every polynomial f, there is a noncommutative <b>extension</b> <b>ring</b> R such that F is {{in the center of}} R and f has a polynomial-size formula over R. On the other hand, if F is algebraically closed, no commutative <b>extension</b> <b>ring</b> R can reduce formula or circuit complexity of f. To complete the picture, we prove that over any field, there exist hard polynomials with zero-one coefficients. (This is a basic theorem, but we could not find it written explicitly.) Finally, we show that low-dimensional extensions are not very helpful in computing polynomials. As a corollary, we obtain that the elementary symmetric polynomials have formulas of size n O(loglogn) over any field, and that division gates can be efficiently eliminated from circuits, over any field.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} chest size on coronary calcium score (CCS) as assessed with new-generation CT systems from 4 major vendors. Methods: An anthropomorphic, small-sized (300 × 200 mm) chest phantom containing 100 small calcifications (diameters, 0. 5 - 2. 0 mm) was evaluated with and without an <b>extension</b> <b>ring</b> on state-of-the-art CT systems from 4 vendors. The <b>extension</b> <b>ring</b> was used to mimic a patient with a large chest size (400 × 300 mm). Image acquisition was repeated 5 times with small translations and/or rotations. Routine clinical acquisition and reconstruction protocols for small and large patients were used. CCS was quantified as Agatston and mass scores with vendor software. Results: The small-sized phantom resulted in median (interquartiles) Agatston scores of 10 (9 - 35), 136 (123 - 146), 34 (30 - 37), and 87 (85 - 89) for Philips, GE, Siemens, and Toshiba, respectively. Mass scores were 4 mg (3 - 9 mg), 23 mg (21 - 27 mg), 8 mg (8 - 9 mg), and 20 mg (20 - 20 mg), respectively. Adding the <b>extension</b> <b>ring</b> resulted in reduced Agatston scores for all vendors (17 %- 48 %) and mass scores for 2 vendors (11 %- 49 %). Median Agatston scores decreased to 9 (5 - 10), 79 (60 - 80), 27 (24 - 32), and 45 (29 - 53) units, and median mass scores remained similar for Philips at 4 mg (4 - 6 mg) and Siemens at 8 mg (7 - 8 mg) and decreased for the other vendors to 13 mg (11 - 14 mg) and 10 mg (8 - 13 mg), respectively. Conclusion: This multivendor phantom study showed that CCS can be underestimated up to 50 % (49 %- 66 %) for Agatston scores and 49 % (36 %- 59 %) for mass scores at a larger chest size, which may be relevant for women and large patients. However, CCS underestimation by chest size differs considerably by vendor...|$|E
