5|$|The {{practice}} of hare coursing <b>has</b> <b>only</b> <b>recently,</b> in historical terms, been debated in Parliament, although Parliament created an exemption in 1921 from the cruelty legislation, the Protection of Animals Act 1911, for animals released for coursing. Eric Heffer, MP for Liverpool Walton, {{was a major}} opponent of coursing in the late 1960s, and Prime Minister Harold Wilson joined in the criticism.|$|E
5|$|At the prison, Coulson and agent Melinda May {{find the}} staff {{have been turned}} against them by Lucy's ghostly influence. Defending themselves, they call Mack for backup. He arrives with Daisy Johnson / Quake—a rogue agent that <b>has</b> <b>only</b> <b>recently</b> joined back with the team—and Robbie Reyes / Ghost Rider—a demon-like vigilante and Morrow's nephew, {{as well as a}} newly {{developed}} antidote to Lucy's influence. Meanwhile, Mace is debating the anti-Inhuman Senator Ellen Nadeer on live television, who brings up the prison situation which he is not aware of. Faced with further questions from Nadeer, Mace reveals that he is an Inhuman himself.|$|E
5|$|Banksia spinulosa {{was named}} by James Edward Smith in England in 1793, after being {{collected}} by John White, most likely in 1792. He {{gave it the}} common name prickly-leaved banksia, though this has fallen out of use. With four currently recognised varieties, the species has had a complicated taxonomic history, with two varieties initially described as separate species in the early 19th century. A fourth, from the New England region, <b>has</b> <b>only</b> <b>recently</b> been described. However, there has been disagreement whether one, var.cunninghamii, is distinct enough to once again have specific status. The pre-eminent authority on Banksia, Alex George, concedes there is still more {{work to be done}} on the Banksia spinulosa complex.|$|E

5|$|Much of {{the local}} {{woodland}} was devastated by the Great Storm of 1987, which in October swept across south-east England with hurricane-force winds. A {{significant part of the}} exposed woodland to the north-east of Wormshill was felled and, after replanting, <b>has</b> <b>only</b> <b>recently</b> shown signs of maturing. An ancient yew tree believed to have stood for several hundred years in the grounds of the house at Norwood Farm was destroyed along with other long-standing trees. However, some 25years later, the village displays few obvious signs of the damage.|$|E
5|$|Body {{adornment}} <b>has</b> <b>only</b> <b>recently</b> {{become a}} subject of serious scholarly research by archaeologists, who have been hampered in studying body piercing by a sparsity of primary sources. Early records rarely discussed the use of piercings or their meaning, and while jewellery is common among grave goods, {{the deterioration of the}} flesh that it once adorned makes it difficult to discern how the jewellery may have been used. Also, the modern record has been vitiated with the 20th-century inventions of piercing enthusiast Doug Malloy. In the 1960s and 1970s, Malloy marketed contemporary body piercing by giving it the patina of history. His pamphlet Body & Genital Piercing in Brief included such commonly reproduced urban legends as the notion that Prince Albert invented the piercing that shares his name in order to diminish the appearance of his large penis in tight trousers, and that Roman centurions attached their capes to nipple piercings. Some of Malloy's myths are reprinted as fact in subsequently published histories of piercing.|$|E
5|$|The native {{range of}} emerald ash borer in Asia was {{surveyed}} for parasitoid species that parasitize emerald ash borer {{and do not}} attack other insect species in the hope they would suppress populations when released in North America. Three species imported from China were approved for release by the USDA in 2007 and in Canada in 2013: Spathius agrili, Tetrastichus planipennisi, and Oobius agrili, while Spathius galinae was approved for release in 2015. Excluding Spathius galinae, which <b>has</b> <b>only</b> <b>recently</b> been released, the other three species have been documented parasitizing emerald ash borer larvae one year after release, indicating that they survived the winter, but establishment varied among species and locations. Tetrastichus planipennisi and Oobius agrili established and have had increasing populations in Michigan since 2008; Spathius agrili has had lower establishment success in North America, which {{could be due to}} a lack of available emerald ash borer larvae at the time of adult emergence in spring, limited cold tolerance, and better suitability to regions of North America below the 40th parallel.|$|E

5|$|Water covers 71% of the Earth's surface. Of this, 97.5% is {{the salty}} {{water of the}} oceans and only 2.5% freshwater, most of which is locked up in the Antarctic ice sheet. The {{remaining}} freshwater is found in glaciers, lakes, rivers, wetlands, the soil, aquifers and atmosphere. Due to the water cycle, fresh water supply is continually replenished by precipitation, however {{there is still a}} limited amount necessitating management of this resource. Awareness of the global importance of preserving water for ecosystem services <b>has</b> <b>only</b> <b>recently</b> emerged as, during the 20th century, more than half the world's wetlands have been lost along with their valuable environmental services. Increasing urbanization pollutes clean water supplies and much of the world still does not have access to clean, safe water. Greater emphasis is now being placed on the improved management of blue (harvestable) and green (soil water available for plant use) water, and this applies at all scales of water management.|$|E

25|$|The {{movement}} of snakes in arboreal habitats <b>has</b> <b>only</b> <b>recently</b> been studied. While on tree branches, snakes use several modes of locomotion depending on species and bark texture. In general, snakes {{will use a}} modified form of concertina locomotion on smooth branches, but will laterally undulate if contact points are available. Snakes move faster on small branches and when contact points are present, in contrast to limbed animals, which do better on large branches with little 'clutter'.|$|E
