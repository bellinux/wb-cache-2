5|$|By 1898, American {{financier}} Charles Tyson Yerkes {{had made}} a large fortune developing the <b>electric</b> <b>tramway</b> and elevated railway systems in Chicago, but his questionable business methods, which included bribery and blackmail, had finally drawn the disapproving attention of the public. Yerkes had unsuccessfully attempted to bribe the city council and Illinois state legislature into granting him a 100-year franchise for the tramway system. Following a public backlash, he sold his Chicago investments and {{turned his attention to}} opportunities in London.|$|E
5|$|To {{serve the}} growing {{population}} of the council estate, the Middleton Light Railway, an <b>electric</b> <b>tramway,</b> was built in 1925 by Leeds Corporation. The tramway from Leeds ran parallel to the colliery line to Hunslet Moor staithes and then headed south through Middleton Woods to a terminus on the Ring Road. The tramway {{was made into a}} circular route in 1949 when it was extended to Belle Isle Road and Balm Road in Hunslet. The tramway closed in 1959. Its route through the park is now a footpath.|$|E
5|$|As Osijek grew as a city, the fort's {{presence}} hindered {{the potential}} for urban development. The demolition {{of most of the}} fort walls happened between 1923 and 1926, with the construction of an <b>electric</b> <b>tramway.</b> The last gunpowder magazine, located behind the church of St. Michael, was demolished in 1958. While most of the fortifications have been demolished (only the first and eighth bastions and the northern wall with its so-called 'water gate' were kept), the center of Tvrđa remains intact. The Yugoslav People's Army maintained a garrison and a military hospital in Tvrđa, but in the 1980s these buildings were gradually being abandoned, and adapted into ateliers for local painters and sculptors.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{generally}} favourable {{public opinion}} on bringing electric trams to Christchurch there were some objectors. These included the Royal Society who believed an <b>electric</b> <b>tramway</b> system would cause magnetic disturbances that would interfere with readings made at its Christchurch observatory; the municipal utilities who feared leakage from the return current of an <b>electric</b> <b>tramway</b> would corrode underground pipes through electrolysis; and the telephone authority who believed that the flow of electricity through such a system would interfere with earth currents in telephone circuits and thus render them useless. Solutions were found {{for all of the}} utilities concerns.|$|E

25|$|The Hobart <b>Electric</b> <b>Tramway</b> Company {{commenced}} {{operation in}} 1893, providing Hobart {{with the first}} complete <b>electric</b> <b>tramway</b> in the Southern Hemisphere. The tramway proved very popular and the route from the city to Sandy Bay Beach was always crowded in summers during the early 20th century. The tramways expanded rapidly, and suburban growth was encouraged by the lines. By the early 20th century, tramlines ran from the city depot to North Hobart, Lenah Valley, Springfield, Glenorchy, Cascade Brewery, Proctor's Road, and Sandy Bay. Single deck trams were introduced in 1906, and the Hobart City Council took {{over control of the}} company in 1912, renaming it the Hobart Metropolitan Tramways. Electric trolley buses were introduced in 1935.|$|E
25|$|Test runs {{started on}} 10 January 1894. The {{official}} {{opening of the}} first Nordic <b>electric</b> <b>tramway</b> took place on 2 March 1894 and ordinary operation commenced the following day. It was the seventh <b>electric</b> <b>tramway</b> to open in Europe. Amongst the concerns in the public debate was that horses, such as those from the competing KSS, {{would not be able}} to cope with seeing a tram running without being pulled by a horse. The competitor's labor union proposed that KES used stuffed horses in front of their trams, but the horses soon learned to cope with the autonomous vehicle. At first the trams ran every six minutes, but this proved difficult to operate and it was reduced to an eight-minute headway.|$|E
