Upon Carmella's introduction, her only family member was her mobster father Rocco, who {{had been sent to}} prison. In 2006, Carmella was given a sister, when Natalie Saleeba was cast in the role of Rosetta Cammeniti. Blair opined that Rosie's inclusion brought out different sides to Carmella's character. Many viewers told Blair they felt the casting was good because they look alike. One of the significant changes to Carmella was that she started having fun again—Blair felt this meant they worked well together. Later, Erin McNaught was cast as her cousin Sienna Cammeniti.

40|$|Businesses {{today are}} {{constantly}} {{on the lookout for}} new investment opportunities. Often, they have to move away from their home market and enter new countries in order to continue to grow. One question that is sometimes omitted when planning such moves is that of corruption. Especially when moving into transition economies, the issue of corruption can be an obscure and complex one, on which little research has been made to date. Russia is one such economy, with a huge investment potential, but very unclear rules about how business is and should be conducted. It would be <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> extent corruption in Russia has affected Swedish companies’ entry strategies in the Russian market. The method chosen {{for the purpose of this}} thesis was to conduct a survey of 20 Swedish firms currently present in Russia. We also conducted interviews with 3 experts in the field of Russian business, and one representative of a Swedish firm considering expanding their operations in Russia. This combination of quantitative and qualitative methods would allow us to look at things from different perspectives and get a better view of the state of corruption in Russia. The interviews were in some cases conducted in person, allowing for a broader and less formal discussion of the topic, helping the authors gain more insight and generate new ideas to be used in the paper. The authors found that Swedish companies operating in Russia usually attribute little importance to the issue of corruption during the planning stages of the market penetration strategy. Many of these firms did encounter corruption at later stages of market penetration, and were forced to rethink their strategies accordingly, showing that corruption affect entry strategies to a great extent. It was concluded that the most appropriate method for Swedish firms to enter the Russian market is through fully-owned subsidiaries, with the assistance of local consulting agencies, which provide help when dealing with those areas where corruption is most likely to exist...|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of the current maps available on the web with a standard browser are raster-based, which impose a couple of limitations with regard to functionality as well as performance. Most work is done on the server, and the raster image tiles that are rendered on the client can not be interacted with directly. Some solutions are available that solve this partially, but in the {{majority of}} cases, they depend on technology that is not standardised, and rely on third-party extensions that are only available on certain platforms. Creating map tiles and implementing efficient caching are crucial in high availability web maps, whether they are raster-based or vector-based. Due to the different storage models of raster images and vector data structures, there are also techniques that differ in their application (such as compression, client rendering and generalisation), and the increased exposure of raw information with vector data needs attention. The data formats chosen for representing spatial data in vector-based maps, have lots of implications for the efficiency and usability of the map application itself. The accelerated development and standardisation of the open web [...] namely HTML 5 [...] are giving developers better tools to meet the functionality and performance requirements for vector maps on the web, without resorting to third-party software that is not supported across platforms. Previously, with the technology available, creating a functional, efficient vector map on the web was hard or impossible using only open technology, but with the recent advancements, it is <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> extent this can be accomplished.

This {{is the first in}} a series of updates to classic epidemiologic-methods papers that EP&I has commissioned. When EP&I was launched, we planned to commission updates to classic methods papers. We thought it would be <b>interesting</b> and useful <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> changes the original authors would make to a must-read paper if that paper were written today. We {{are pleased to}} publish the first paper in this series: an update to "Identifiabiliity, exchangeability and epidemiological confounding" (IEEC) by Sander Greenland and James Robins [1], origi-nally published in 1986 in the International Journal of Epidemiology [2]...|$|R
