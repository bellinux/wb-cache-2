40|$|Water {{distribution}} {{systems in}} cities throughout South Asia (and many other countries) only supply water on an intermittent basis (currently averaging less than 5 hrs/day in most Indian cities). Intermittent Water Supply (IWS) creates inequities in water availability and carries public health {{risks associated with}} the ingress of contaminants from the surrounding ground through flaws in the aged piping systems. It is a major challenge to upgrade from intermittent to continuous water supply (CWS) as this involves {{an increase in the}} operating water pressures which promotes higher rates of leakage. There are currently no reliable computational models for characterizing the transient hydraulic behavior of IWS systems (including pipe filling and draining events) and hence, it is difficult to understand and control IWS systems. In a recent PhD thesis, Lieb (2015) developed an open-source code to solve the dynamics of IWS pipe networks through finite volume solution of the governing 1 -D Saint Venant equations using the Preismann slot approximation. The current thesis extends and refines the algorithms proposed by Lieb to enable more robust simulations for pipe networks. Specific modification include algorithms for <b>dry</b> <b>pipes</b> and three-pipe junctions. The thesis proposes a new algorithm for representing the conservation of fluid mass, momentum and energy at a three-pipe junction which is validated by comparing computed loss coefficients with measured data reported in the literature. The research also validates predictions of mixed flow conditions (open-channel and pressured pipe flow conditions) with results from laboratory model tests. The proposed formulation has been applied to simulate a skeletonized pipe network (at a test site in Delhi), where simulations are compared with water pressures during intermittent water supply periods. The proposed analysis represents a first step towards comprehensive modeling of IWS {{that can be used to}} improve understanding and control of these systems and to manage the upgrading process for CWS operations. by Xin Zhang.

The difference is that a water mist system uses a compressed gas as an atomizing medium, which is pumped through the sprinkler pipe.

Systems can be applied using local application method or total flooding method, similar to Clean Agent Fire Protection Systems.|$|E

Since the {{basic understanding of}} the transfer mechanisms of heat, momentum and mass in porous media during phase change have still developed, the two phase change flows have possible applications in geophysics and engineering problems such as geothermal energy, steam stimulation of oil fields, food <b>drying</b> and heat <b>pipes</b> problems (Ebinuma and Nakayama 1990). Al-Nimr and Alkam (1997) have studied steady film condensation on a vertical plate imbedded in a porous medium and have considered the Brinkman-Darcy model by neglecting the macroscopic and microscopic inertial terms to obtain analytical solutions for the three following requests: liquid film thickness, condensate mass flow rate and convective heat transfer coefficient. In the same way, Masoud et al. (2000) have adopted the Brinkman-extended Darcy model to found analytical solutions that describe the transient behavior of the three latter requests.

5000|$|Dottle can be {{produced}} by different factors. The primary cause of an excessive amount of dottle is a tightly packed or otherwise improperly packed pipe, where the tobacco has been improperly prepared or is compressed and will not burn properly. A second possible cause can be the excessive moisture content of the tobacco and the tobacco being smoked too quickly. This can result in tobacco that is too wet to burn. Rapid or hard draws on the pipe can and will produce an excessively hot ember in the bowl causing the moisture content of the tobacco to vaporize and then condense in bottom of the bowl and in the draft hole, preventing the tobacco from burning properly. A third contributor {{to the creation of}} dottle is propylene glycol or [...] "PG". This innocuous preservative used primarily in aromatic tobaccos can keep the moisture content high in pipe tobaccos even after <b>drying.</b> Smoking the <b>pipe</b> too fast can also produce a foul tasting liquid that collects {{at the bottom of the}} bowl and in the draft hole resulting in [...] "pipe gurgle"; this can be inadvertently tasted.

Steam rises up more generating tubes and finally back into the steam drum where the <b>dry</b> <b>pipe</b> is located then into the plant.

40|$|A {{flexible}} pipe consists of {{several layers of}} steel and fluid barriers, where the fluid barriers keep the inside (steel) of the flexible <b>pipe</b> <b>dry.</b> Unfortunately, the most frequently damaged component of the {{flexible pipe}} is the external sheath, which is the outer fluid barrier. Water in the annulus {{is an indication of}} leakage, and replacement is then needed. To protect against or avoid severe damage of the flexible pipe, several inspection methods to detect damage of different parts of the flexible pipe are available. To detect the presence of air or water inside a gap between two steel armour plates in this work, an inspection method was necessary. The performed inspection was normal incident pulse-echo ultrasonic inspection. Both unfocused (plane) and focused transducers were used to scan a simplified flexible pipe model. The model consisted of a high density polyethylene (HDPE) external sheath and steel armour plates beneath it. The gaps between two steel plates beneath the HDPE-sheath was filled with either air or water and inspected. A realistic gap size between steel plates was found in theory to be in the range from 1 to 2 mm if the gaps were evenly distributed over the circumference of the flexible pipe. To detect whether air or water was present, only the focused transducer fitted this purpose. The focused transducer detected difference between air and water for a 2 mm gap between steel plates when the transducer gradually inspected from steel over the gap and to steel again. From circle segment area consideration, it should be possible in theory to see a 180 ° phase-shift for 1. 2 mm gap between steel plates to differ air and water. Another way to differ air and water was to detect the plexiglass-container layer beneath both the HDPE-plate and the water layer. If air was present the layer could not be detected, but if water was present a 0. 5 mm gap between the steel plates could be identified by amplitude consideration. In the lab-test this layer was a plexiglass-container, but for a real flexible pipe this layer is an antiwear layer or another steel layer beneath the first steel layer. </p...|$|R

5000|$|... ==Characteristics of boiler feedwater== Water has higher heat {{capacity}} {{than most other}} substances. This quality makes it an ideal raw material for boiler operations. Boilers {{are part of a}} closed system as compared to open systems in a gas turbine. The closed system that is used is the Rankine cycle. This means that the water is recirculated throughout the system and is never in contact with the atmosphere. The water is reused and needs to be treated to continue efficient operations. Boiler water must be treated in order to be proficient in producing steam. Boiler water is treated to prevent scaling, corrosion, foaming, and priming. Chemicals are put into boiler water through the chemical feed tank to keep the water within chemical range. These chemicals are mostly oxygen scavengers and phosphates. The boiler water also has frequent blowdowns {{in order to keep the}} chloride content down. The boiler operations also include bottom blows in order to get rid of solids. Scale is precipitated impurities out of the water and then forms on heat transfer surfaces. This is a problem because scale does not transfer heat very well and causes the tubes to fail by getting too hot. Corrosion is caused by oxygen in the water. The oxygen causes the metal to oxidize which lowers the melting point of the metal. Foaming and priming is caused when the boiler water does not have the correct amount of chemicals and there are suspended solids in the water which carry over in the <b>dry</b> <b>pipe.</b> The <b>dry</b> <b>pipe</b> is where the steam and water mixture are separated.|$|E
