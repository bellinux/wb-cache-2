5|$|A {{government}} {{motion to}} reopen the same-sex marriage debate <b>failed.</b> The 38th Canadian Parliament, led by the Liberals, had legalized same-sex marriage a year earlier. Several provinces had legalized same-sex marriage before that. During his campaign, Harper promised a parliamentary vote on reopening the issue. The motion <b>failed</b> 175–123 leaving the same-sex marriage legal in Canada and the legal debate about it closed.|$|E

The play did not earn him the money he had hoped for, though, until Garrick produced it in 1749.|$|E

However, they achieved only part of their objectives; the JNA <b>failed</b> to secure the area surrounding the barracks or remove all the weapons and equipment in it, and the planned coordinated advance against Turanj also <b>failed.</b> Croatian forces <b>failed</b> in their primary objective: containing the garrison.

This takes typical memory array <b>fail</b> patterns into account. Examples for different failure types are given. This scheme allows minimizing the necessary catch memory size for <b>fail</b> classification. A 64 Mbit <b>fail</b> map can be compressed to 2 k allowing classification of 13 <b>fail</b> types. Since catch ram requirements are small, this scheme can be implemented in a manufacturing environment for all processed hardware. Compressed bit <b>fail</b> maps can be used to generate wafer and lot maps for diagnosis...|$|R
