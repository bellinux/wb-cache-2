Only nutrients whose concentration in leaves taken in July were below the critical levels were applied in the former treatment, whereas in the latter 500 kg ha- 1 of a 15 - 15 - 15 complex fertilizer, and three foliar sprays of micronutrients and aminoacids were applied annually. Four olive orchards were selected. One orchard has a small effective depth (33 cm) limited by a petrocalcic horizon. The second has an effective soil depth of 60 cm, and is representative of broad level uplands on hard calcareous rocks. The third orchard has a deep soil (~ 90 cm), typical of rolling areas with soft marls; and the fourth is a soil whose effective depth is also large (~ 90 cm), representative of flat areas on soft clayey sediments, partially decalcified. One homogeneous zone of 2 -ha was split into two plots within each orchard, and the treatments {{were randomly assigned to}} each plot. After five years, no sig-nificant differences were found in yield, fruit weight, oil content or vegetative growth, but polyphenols in the oil decreased in trees subjected to the traditional fertilization.

40|$|Cocoa is {{globally}} {{the third}} agricultural commodity traded {{in terms of}} value. The cocoa world production is relatively stable since 2010, amounting to around 4. 5 million tonnes. Eight countries account for 90 % of the cocoa production, of which four West African countries. Under traditional cultivation practices, cocoa yields are poor {{with an average of}} ten fruits per cacao (Theobroma cacao L.), even though it has a potential to yield more than 100 fruits. As for most tree crops, the yields are depending on many factors, of which the more important are planting material, climate, cultural practices, and soil. Cacao is cultivated on many types of soil, and in various conditions, from agroforestry systems to full sun. Soil degradation and low soil fertility are among the main causes of low cocoa productivity. However, despite this inherent low fertility, most of the cocoa farmers do not use fertilizer because they are not well informed of the agricultural and fertilizers issues. Here we first review why fertilizers are used and how to optimize their effects, particularly farming practices and soil fertility management in full sun or shaded plantations. Secondly, we describe soil diagnosis and the <b>foliar</b> <b>diagnosis,</b> the two complementary approaches that were developed to assess the nutritional needs of cacao. The soil diagnosis provides a means to improve soil nutrient availabilities, while <b>foliar</b> <b>diagnosis</b> provides information on the cacao health. Third, we review the methods used to design fertilizer formulae and doses, and how they are calculated. Fertilizer inputs and mode of application are determined from the local conditions and farming practices. Finally, we review the effects of nutrients on the characteristics of the cocoa tree and cacao product. Finally, some current issues are discussed, {{such as the use of}} advising a single formula for a whole region or country and how to develop adoption of fertilizer by cocoa farmers.

Furthermore, there should be an analysis of whether urea with the urease enzyme inhibitor NBPT is less harmful, benefiting BNF in grasses. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of N sources and N rates associated with inoculation with Azospirillum brasilense regarding <b>foliar</b> <b>diagnosis</b> and leaf chlorophyll index (LCI), agronomic efficiency (AE), and corn grain yield in the Cerrado (Brazilian tropical savanna) region. The experiment was conducted in a no-tillage system in a Latossolo Vermelho Distroférrico (Oxisol). A randomized block experimental design was used with four replications in a 2 × 5 × 2 factorial arrangement as follows: two N sources - urea and Super N, urea with urease enzyme inhibitor NBPT [N - (n-butyl thiophosphoric triamide) ]; five N rates (0, 50, 100, 150, and 200 kg ha- 1) applied in topdressing; and two seed inoculation treatments, one with and one without A. brasilense. N rate positively influenced the LCI and concentrations of N, S, and Mn in leaves, and may increase the concentrations of P, Cu, and Fe; however, higher N rates can reduce AE. The N sources had similar effects, and therefore urea is recommended for N fertilization. Inoculation with A. brasilense decreased leaf concentration of Fe and increased LCI, leaf concentration of P, AE, and corn grain yield; the use of this diazotrophic bacterium is therefore viable even when high rates of N are applied...|$|E
40|$|Foliar {{analysis}} {{is a valuable}} tool for evaluating the pollution status of forests. However, the use of <b>foliar</b> <b>diagnosis</b> in large-scale surveys is a complicated process owing to the high variability within the crown. The method used to express foliar concentrations has often been found to diminish the variability. The effect of the method used to express element concentrations on the spatial variability of cadmium (Cd) in the leaves of crack willow (Salix fragilis L.) was investigated by sampling the leaves of one willow at 292 locations in the crown, each sampling location having a volume of 0. 027 m 3 (0. 3 m × 0. 3 m × 0. 3 m). Cadmium showed a distinct spatial trend in the crown of the tree. Concentrations as low as 2. 4 mg kg- 1 dry weight (DW) or 23. 1 mg kg- 1 dry ash weight (DAW) were obtained {{in the top of}} the crown, and 10. 6 mg kg- 1 DW or 73. 0 mg kg- 1 DAW in the bottom of the crown. The lower relative standard deviation and weaker correlation with the sampling height support the use of DAW in large-scale surveys especially. The lower variability of the DAW Cd concentration makes this variable less sensitive to fluctuations caused by differences in growing conditions and sampling methodology. However, the majority of publications in this field report metal concentrations on a DW basis. Therefore, the restrictions set on the use of results expressed on a DAW basis in large-scale surveys of foliar metal concentrations have to be offset against the advantages offered by a reduction of the variability in metal concentrations...|$|E

Najveća koncentracija K utvrđena je u lišću Golden Deliciousa, a najmanja u lišću sorte Idared. Razlika je statistički opravdana u odnosu na sorte Melorese i James Grieve. Ustanovljena je podudarnost rezultata s našim ranijim istraživanjima genetske specifičnosti mineralne ishrane sorti Golden Delicious, Idared i Starkrimson, koja su provedena u plantažama na pseudogleju (Dugo Selo, Donja Zelina, Katoličko Selište) u Posavini i Moslavini (Anić Jelka i Miljković I.; 1994.) i u plantaži Borinci na eutričnom smeđem tlu na karbonatnom lesu u Slavoniji (Miljković I. i Vrsaljko A.; 2009.). In recent years, {{control of}} the soli plant-feeding {{capacity}} in orchards has been performed by the method of <b>foliar</b> <b>diagnosis,</b> because it is considered more reliable than soil analysis. The paper {{presents the results of}} several years of research on concentration of N, P, K, Ca and Mg, and the sum of cations and cation balance. Investigations were carried out in Donje Međimurje in orchards Nedelišće, Čehovec and Cirkovljan. Orchards were raised on a series of alluvial soils. In the orchard Nedelišće research was carried out on the varieties: Starkrimson, Golden Delicious, Idared and Golden Spur. In the orchard Čehovec research was carried out on varieties: Wellspur Delicious, Golden Spur, Golden Delicious and Idared, and in the orchard Cirkovljan on the varieties: Golden Delicious, Idared, Melrose and James Grieve. According to the criteria put forward by the researchers Bould (1966), Fiedler (1970), Grouppe (1960), Lalatta (1986), Kenworthy (1963) and others, apples are well supplied with biogenic elements. Larger variations were found between the concentrations of N, K and Ca. Genetic or varietal specifics are reflected in the concentration of N, K and Ca, while Mg and P levels are generally similar in all varieties. In the orchard Nedelišće there is significantly higher concentration of N and K in the leaves of Starkrimson than in varieties Golden Spur, Golden Delicious and Idared. A significantly lower concentration of N was found in the leaves of Idared than in other three varieties. Significantly higher concentration of Ca was found in the leaves of Golden Delicious and Golden Spur than in Idared and Starkrimson. In the orchard Čehovec significantly higher concentration of N were found in the leaves of Golden Delicious than in varieties Golden Spur, Wellspur Delicious and Idared. Significantly higher concentration of Ca was found in the leaves of Golden Delicious and Golden Spur than in Wellspur Delicious and Idared. The leaves of Idared contained significantly lower concentration of K than other three varieties. In the orchard Cirkovljan significantly higher concentration of N and lower concentration of Ca were found in the leaves of the variety James Grieve than in varieties Idared, Golden Delicious and Melrose. The highest concentration of K was found in the leaves of Golden Delicious, and the lowest in the leaves of Idared. The difference was statistically significant compared to the varieties Melorese and James Grieve. The compliance with the results from our previous studies of genetic specificity of mineral nutrition was established for varieties Golden Delicious, Idared and Starkrimson in plantations on pseudogley soil (Dugo Selo, Donja Zelina, Katoličko Selište) in Posavina and Moslavina (Anić Jelka and Miljković I.; 1994) and the plantation Borinci on eutric brown soil on calcareous loess in Slavonia (Miljković I. and Vrsaljko A.; 2009) ...|$|E

O delineamento {{experimental}} utilizado foi inteiramente casualizados em esquema fatorial (3 x 4), sendo três doses de nitrogênio (0, 267 e 534 kg ha- 1 ciclo fonte ureia) e quatro doses de K 2 O (200, 800, 1600 e 2400 kg ha- 1 ciclo- fonte KCl) conduzidas em três densidades de plantio, com três repetições, foram utilizadas mudas da cultivar Nanicão 2001 proveniente de cultura de tecidos. Os tratamentos foram parceladas em quatro épocas (planta mãe), foram coletadas amostras de solo na profundidade de 0 - 20 cm e 20 - 40 cm, para determinação do pH (água), P, K, Na, Cu, Fe, Mn, Zn, Ca, Mg, H+Al, N total e matéria orgânica e amostras de tecido vegetal (folhas) sendo utilizada a 3 ª folha para diagnóstico foliar. Os frutos foram analisados quanto ao diâmetro e comprimento, as relações polpa/casca, número de frutos por penca, número de pencas, comprimento do fruto, resistência da polpa, produtividade, teor de sólidos solúveis (grau brix) e acidez titulável. Os resultados mostram que para se obter o máximo de produtividade, independentemente das doses de N e K, os teores de P, Ca, Mg, S e dos micronutrientes têm que estar dentro ou um pouco acima das faixas consideradas adequadas. Os atributos químicos do solo (pH, P, Na, Ca, Mg, H+Al, Al, N total, MO, Cu, Fe, Mn e Zn) foram afetados pelo adensamento das plantas e tratamentos aplicados (doses de N e K). Com o aumento da densidade de plantio houve incremento na produção, porém, prolongou a produtividade anual, com aumento gradativo do ciclo; O tamanho do cacho, número de pencas, textura, acidez, sólidos solúveis não apresentaram correlação entre si e nem entre os teores foliares e do fruto de N e K. Devido a não significância entre as doses 267 e 534 kg ha- 1 de N na produtividade, recomenda-se no espaçamento 3 m x 1 m, utilizar a menor dose de N, diminuindo o elevado custo de produção do bananal na região, ocasionado pelo alto preço dos fertilizantes.

40|$|Until 1942 {{cultivation}} of pepper P. nigrum L. in Sarawak produced relatively small but regular yields. High demands after 1945 and restricted use of "burnt earth" compelled farmers {{to abandon the}} application of this traditional fertilizer. Instead, "fool proof" manufactured fertilizers of mainly organic origin were successfully applied in massive volumes and large yields were obtained. In 1954 and following years a sharp fall in price induced a decline in production, in part owing to much reduced applications of fertilizer. As a result the economic crop cycle of some 16 years was limited to some 1 - 3 years; {{the bulk of the}} total yield was obtained {{in the first year of}} production. An initial survey on leaf symptoms and die-back indicated unbalanced and inadequate mineral nutrition of the crop. The current system induced severe deterioration of plant appearance in the period of monsoon rains, which coincide with berry expansion. During this time no fertilizers are applied as a rule. A method has been worked out to diagnose the nutritional demands of N, P, K, Ca and Mg by chemical foliar analysis. Major aspects involved in the establishment of a sampling procedure were systematically studied. The effect on chemical concentrations was investigated of the portion of the vine, the presence of fruit, the branch, the age of the leaf, the presence of the petiole, leaf size, leaf thickness, sunshine, different stems on a plant, location of fertilizer dressings and the number of leaves to be sampled per vine. Similarly, the influence of the mode of cleaning of the leaves, of the drying temperature on loss of N and the effect of length of storage on the content of N were studied. Studies on the error of bulk sampling and the effect of appropriate stratification of the different leaves in the canopy on the reduction of this error showed that suitable division into strata reduced the number of vines to be included in a bulk sample up to 16 times as compared with random sampling, assuming the same degree of precision. Furthermore the inclusion Of 4 appropriately stratified leaves from each of 60 - 70 vines in each bulk sample obtained from homogeneous areas, would represent chemical concentrations with a precision of 10 % of the population mean (P = 0. 05) irrespective of physiological condition. Data on seasonal variation indicated declining levels of N and K within the monsoon; this was accompanied by gradually rising levels of leaf P and leaf Ca. Leaf Mg tended towards constancy. Bivariate ratios showed, on most occasions, a regular relationship with time, but constant values were observed only occasionally. A sand experiment on deficiencies of nutrients showed characteristic discolourations due to nutrient shortage. Concurring foliar concentrations and ratios associated with full nutrients, partial or complete deficiency of a single element allowed tentative registration of normal, fair, critical and deficient threshold values in the leaves for each element (table 18). Single and multiple deficiencies could be recognized by using an appropriate grouping of concentrations and their ratios. Application of these values to random field data showed a satisfactory power of discrimination. The ratio values gave a good indication of the order of importance in the case of multiple deficiencies. The influence was studied of dressings of NPK fertilizers on leaf concentrations and ratios. It was observed that increasing dressings of N, P, and K were directly reflected in risising concentrations of leaf N, leaf Pand leaf K, respectively. Simultaneously, N- P "antagonism" and "antagonism" between bases was also operative. Apparently, considered balancing of applications of different fertilizers is essential. The ratios between elements gave some indication of priorities of different dressings. It was also observed that under the influence of the very heavy, early applications leaf concentrations of N, K and Mg fall to deficiency levels. This indicates that the distribution in time also requires adjustment. The development of physiological exhaustion could be attributed to an inadequate net supply of N, K and Mg to the leaves during translocation processes of nutrients in the period of fruit development. Stability of yield at a high level of production can be maintained by preventing development of nutrient shortages and ensuring fair to normal concentrations of N, P, K, Ca and Mg in the leaves throughout the year. Threshold values, independently obtained from field vines corroborate the tentative values for the normal levels found in the pot experiment. The latter may therefore be considered as fundamentally correct. Rather complicated interactions of "antagonisms" and "synergisms" may become operative if foliar levels fall below these normal levels. The data have also shown convincingly that the values for log N/P can be used as a satisfactory control for abundance of flowers at a specific potential for flowering. Finally, the agricultural implications of these findings are discussed in Ch. 10. The data allowed a plausible interpretation of crop behaviour and crop performance under the traditional system of cultivation before 1942 and that in the period after 1945. By integrating the leaf data of this work with information concerning factors affecting the supply of nutrients to the plant, it was shown that <b>foliar</b> <b>diagnosis</b> furnished a suitable foundation to devise an appropriate fertilizer policy for pepper...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (DScAgric) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 1958. OBJECTIVE. High {{economic}} {{production has}} ever been the aim and aspiration of the agriculturist and no less that of the fruit farmer. In striving towards this aim the latter has {{for a long time}} been at a disadvantage with regard to control of his nutritional programme. Even on naturally fertile soil, the question continually arises as to what the correct fertilizer treatment should be to maintain high productivity and how such a decision can be arrived at. A satisfactory answer to these questions could have been obtained from fertilizer trials if it was not such a difficult matter, in view of the extensive and long-term nature of such trials with fruit trees, to establish a sufficient number for each fruit species on different soil types and under different climatic conditions. Efforts to find a new approach to the problem have turned attention to the plant itself and its chemical make-up as affording the best index of its nutritional requirements. Intensive work in this direction has resulted in the evolution of a new tool in agriculture, the technique of diagnostic leaf analysis or 1 Toliar diagnosis" as originally proposed by Lagatu and Maume in France and Thomas in u. s. A. A review of the literature is presented indicating the prodigous amount of research which has been applied to studies of the relationship between plant response and nutrient supply in terms of plant composition. Agriculturists have been quick to recognize the potentialities of leaf analysis as a practical guide in nutritional problems and advisory services based on foliar analysis have already been established for certain crops overseas. The experimental basis for formulating such a scheme for deciduous fruit in the Western Cape Province is provided by the factual evidence presented in this thesis. THE TECHNIQUE. The technique of diagnostic leaf analysis comprises sampling of leaves, preparation of sample for analysis and the analysis itself followed by interpretation of the analytical results by comparison with previously determined nutritional standards. Numerous factors were found to influence the final composition of the leaf sample as determined by analysis, such that strict adherence to a standardized procedure through all phases of sampling and preparation of leaf samples for analysis is required to eliminate or reduce errors likely to cause misleading interpretations. Experimental data are presented suggesting how the leaf sample should be selected on a tree and how it should be handled, cleaned, dried, ground and stored to reduce sampling and other errors. The final procedure as adopted eliminates most of the potential sources of experimental error but two unavoidable sources of e~ror remain to be accounted for, that due to tree variation and seasonal effect. The variation in leaf composition from tree to tree was found to be very considerable, so that aampling from a large enough group of trees (6 to 10) to reduce the error involved is essential in order to obtain leaf data which correctly reflects the nutrient status of the portion of the orchard concerned. Secondly, on the grounds of marked consistency found in different fruit species as to seasonal and year to year variation in mineral nutrient concentration, correction factors have been formulated and are suggested as a means of overcoming these sources of error. THEORETICAL BASIS. A diagnosis of the nutrient status in terms of the analytical results as finally determined is obtained by comparison of the data with previously established leaf composition standards of reference and by correct interpretation of the deviations from these standards. The theoretical basis for setting up these index values is discussed. The criterion used is based on the concept of Optimum Values which aaequately integrates the known relationships between plant response and nutrient supply in terms of internal nutrient concentration. A modification of this concept is proposed to the effect that for maximum growth and yield there exists an optimum range of nutrient concentrations with upper and lower limits for each of the functional elements, and that within this range the interrelationship between the individual nutrient elements is also optimal. Since no local fertilize~ trials with deciduous fruit trees are available and only one for grapes, data from highly productive plants in commercial orchards and vineyards were used to determine the upper and lower limits of the "optimum range", on the following premise. If leaf analysis data are available from a sufficient number of high performance orchards in different localities representing a wide range of nutrient supply and environment, the highest and lowest values obtained may be considered to represent a close approximation of the limits of the range required for optimum performance. It is contended that index values obtained in this way must be of practical value in assessing the nutrient status of fruit trees. It is further postulated that the lower limits for the micro-nutrients and even for magnesium may be justifiably adjusted according to the concentration levels associated with symptom expression. INDEX VALUES. The necessary data for determining standards of leaf composition were obtained from leaf analysis surveys of orchards and vineyards and from a grape fertilizer experiment in the Western Cape Province. Visual symptoms of prevailing nutritional disorders are described (supplemented by photographic illustrations) and their relation to leaf composition indicated. Tentative index values have been determined on the basis indicated for each fruit species, apple, pear, peach, apricot, plum, prune and grapes. These nutritional levels comprise upper and lower limits for the nutrients N, P, K, Ca, Mg 1 Mn 1 Fe and Cu, as well as the upper limits for B and Na. DIAGNOSTIC INTERPRETATIONS. Assessment of the nutrient status in terms of these index values suggests that many orchards and vineyards in the Western Cape Province, particularly prune, apricot and grapes, are suffering from malnutrition in some form and are likely to show a marked response to nutritional treatment as suggested by <b>foliar</b> <b>diagnosis.</b> The use of diagnostic leaf analysis constitutes an important advance in dealing with orohard problems in that an immediate decision is possible regarding nutrient status and related aspects such as selection of suitable sites for fertilizer trials and adjustment of the fertilizer programme.
