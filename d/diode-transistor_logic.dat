2500|$|High {{reliability}} was required of the D-17B. It controlled a key weapon {{that would have}} just one chance to execute its mission.

50|$|Using a high {{collector}} supply voltage and diode clamping decreased collector-base and wiring capacitance charging time.

50|$|Transistor-transistor logic (TTL) is a {{class of}} digital {{circuits}} built from bipolar junction transistors (BJTs) and resistors.

50|$|<b>Diode-transistor</b> <b>logic</b> (DTL) is a {{class of}} digital {{circuits}} that is the direct ancestor of transistor-transistor logic.

50|$|The 7400 {{series of}} transistor-transistor logic (TTL) {{integrated}} circuits {{are the most}} popular family of TTL integrated circuit logic. Quickly replacing <b>diode-transistor</b> <b>logic,</b> it was used to build the mini and mainframe computers of the 1960s and 1970s. Several generations of pin-compatible descendants of the original family have since become de facto standard electronic components.|$|E
50|$|The first {{semiconductor}} logic {{family was}} resistor-transistor logic.

Some DTL designs used two power-supplies with alternating layers of NPN and PNP transistors to increase the fanout.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} logic {{families}} with different characteristics (power consumption, speed, cost, size) such as: RDL (resistor-diode logic), RTL (resistor-transistor logic), DTL (<b>diode-transistor</b> <b>logic),</b> TTL (transistor-transistor logic) and CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor).

5000|$|In {{the later}} 8/S model, two {{different}} logic voltages increased the fan-out of the inexpensive <b>diode-transistor</b> <b>logic.</b> The 8/S also {{reduced the number}} of logic gates by using a serial, single-bit-wide data path to do arithmetic. The CPU of the PDP-8/S had only about 519 logic gates. In comparison, small microcontrollers (as of 2008) usually have 15,000 or more. The reductions in the electronics permitted a much smaller case, {{about the size of a}} bread-box.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{advantage}} of RTL technology {{was that it}} used a minimum number of transistors. In circuits using discrete components, before integrated circuits, transistors were the most expensive component to produce. Early IC logic production (such as Fairchild's in 1961) used the same approach briefly, but quickly transitioned to higher-performance circuits such as <b>diode-transistor</b> <b>logic</b> and then transistor-transistor logic (starting 1963 at Sylvania), since diodes and transistors were no more expensive than resistors in the IC.|$|E
50|$|The Minuteman-II {{program was}} the first mass-produced system to use a {{computer}} constructed from integrated circuits (the Autonetics D-37C).

The other major customer of early integrated circuits was the Apollo Guidance Computer, which had similar weight and ruggedness constraints. The Apollo integrated circuits were resistor-transistor logic made by Fairchild Semiconductor. The Minuteman-II flight computer continued to use rotating magnetic disks for primary storage.

50|$|The {{duplicate}} Harvard architecture {{central processor}} or CC (Central Control) for the 1ESS operated at approximately 200 kHz. It comprised five bays, each two meters high and totaling about four meters in length per CC. Packaging was in cards approximately 4x10 inches (10x25 centimeters) {{with an edge}} connector in the back. Backplane wiring was cotton covered wire-wrap wires, not ribbons or other cables. CPU logic was implemented using discrete <b>diode-transistor</b> <b>logic.</b> One hard plastic card commonly held the components necessary to implement, for example, two gates or a flipflop.|$|E

50|$|To build a {{functionally}} complete logic system, relays, valves (vacuum tubes), or transistors can be used. The simplest {{family of}} logic gates using bipolar transistors is called resistor-transistor logic (RTL). Unlike simple diode logic gates (which {{do not have}} a gain element), RTL gates can be cascaded indefinitely to produce more complex logic functions. RTL gates were used in early integrated circuits. For higher speed and better density, the resistors used in RTL were replaced by diodes resulting in <b>diode-transistor</b> <b>logic</b> (DTL). Transistor-transistor logic (TTL) then supplanted DTL. As integrated circuits became more complex, bipolar transistors were replaced with smaller field-effect transistors (MOSFETs); see PMOS and NMOS. To reduce power consumption still further, most contemporary chip implementations of digital systems now use CMOS logic. CMOS uses complementary (both n-channel and p-channel) MOSFET devices to achieve a high speed with low power dissipation.|$|E
5000|$|Most of {{the logic}} {{circuitry}} of the 1401 was {{a type of}} <b>diode-transistor</b> <b>logic</b> (DTL), that IBM referred to as CTDL (Complemented Transistor Diode Logic).

Typical logic levels of these circuits were (S & U Level) high: 0 V to -0.5V, low: -6 V to -12 V; (T Level) high: 6 V to 1 V, low: -5.5 V to -6 V.|$|E
50|$|The logic {{circuits}} of the KDF9 were entirely solid-state. The KDF9 used transformer-coupled <b>diode-transistor</b> <b>logic,</b> built from germanium diodes, about 20,000 transistors, and about 2,000 toroid pulse transformers (magnetic amplifiers). They ran on a 1 MHz clock that delivered two pulses of 250ns separated by 500ns, in each clock cycle. The maximum configuration incorporated 32K words of 48-bit core storage (192K bytes) with a cycle time of 6 microseconds. Each word could hold a 48-bit integer or floating-point number, two 24-bit integer or floating-point numbers, six 8-bit instruction syllables, or eight 6-bit characters. There was also provision for efficient handling of double-word (96-bit) numbers in both integer and floating point formats. However, {{there was no}} facility for byte or character addressing, so that non-numerical work suffered by comparison. Moreover, there was no standard character set. Each I/O device type had its own more or less similar character set. Not every character that could be read from paper tape could be successfully printed, for example.|$|E
