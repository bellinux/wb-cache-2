40|$|As {{virtualization}} {{becomes a}} key technique for supporting cloud computing, much {{effort has been}} made to reduce virtualization overhead, so a virtualized system can match its native performance. One major overhead is due to memory or page table virtualization. Conventional virtual machines rely on a shadow mechanism to manage page tables, where a shadow page table maintained by the VMM (Virtual Machine Monitor) maps virtual addresses to machine addresses while a guest maintains its own virtual to physical page table. This shadow mechanism will result in expensive VM exits whenever there is a page fault that requires synchronization between the two page tables. To avoid this cost, both Intel and AMD provide hardware assists, EPT (<b>extended</b> <b>page</b> table) and NPT (nested page table), to facilitate address translation. With the hardware assists, the MMU (Memory Managemen...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a process and a tool developed as an Eclipse plug-in for automatically enhancing the navigation structure of Web sites. The process <b>extends</b> each <b>page</b> of a site with a Semantic Navigation Map, i. e., {{a set of}} links connecting the page to other pages of the site showing similar or related content. The process uses Latent Semantic Indexing to compute a dissimilarity measure between {{the pages of the}} site, a graph theoretic clustering algorithm to identify groups of pages with similar or semantically related content, and AJAX code to <b>extend</b> each <b>page</b> with the corresponding Semantic Navigation Map. Semantic navigation maps for a given Web site are recovered once and kept up to date as new pages are added to the site or content of existing pages is updated. Additionally to presenting the process, the underlying techniques and the tool supporting the process, the paper also presents the results obtained from a case study involving a real world Web site...|$|R

40|$|Cellular {{telephones}} save {{power by}} {{switching to a}} low power, or dormant, mode {{when there is no}} active traffic. In dormant mode, the telephone periodically checks for a beacon, and if the beacon indicates that the phone has moved to a new paging area, the telephone performs a paging area update. Paging area update signaling requires considerably less power than is required to move an active traffic channel. When a call comes in, the network pages the telephone by flood signaling the paging area on a special channel, and the telephone brings up an active traffic channel. Recent work has attempted to <b>extend</b> <b>paging</b> to IP networks, in particular, networks running the Mobile IP mobility management protocol. In this paper, we compare Mobile IPv 6 and IP paging for dormant mode location updating. Simulations are presented for a typical macrocellular scenario and a hotspot scenario, where broadband microcells supplement the narrowband macrocells. The results show that Mobile IPv 6 dormant mode location management is roughly comparable to IP paging...|$|R
