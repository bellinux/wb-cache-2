5|$|As a song full of {{gospel and}} soulful influences, it allowed Mariah to really tear loose and show {{what she could}} do – which in reality was {{far more than the}} vocal {{gymnastics}} that seemed to comprise her reputation so far. <b>From</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> rumble to a high wail, she covered five octaves wonderfully, as the power of the tune built. The backing vocals – which once again had those churchy harmonies – filled out the spare melody, as did the stately horns, which entered towards the end. The song was truly a vocal showcase for Mariah.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days, houses were wooden boards fronted by a four-board-high fence which was fronted with a boardwalk. Most {{of the streets}} were dirt roads. Winters were bitterly cold, and teams of horses {{dragging}} V-shaped wooden plows cleared the streets. In {{the center of town}} was the community pump, from which the village would draw water at stipulated hours. Water was pumped from the mine twice a day through a big open pipe. Everyone had to carry water home during pumping time. There was no shutoff valve, so buckets, tubs and barrels were used for water storage. Later, a water tower was built to hold water drawn <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> well. St. Bernard dogs helped carry the water from the well to the homes. Running water and bathtubs came only after ditches were dug for pipes to provide water from Gilbert around 1916. Kerosene lamps provided the means of lighting until 1916, when power lines were installed. Initially, the only telephone was at the Elba mine office.|$|E
5|$|The blue {{wildebeest}} (Connochaetes taurinus), {{also called}} the common wildebeest, white-bearded wildebeest or brindled gnu, is a large antelope {{and one of the}} two species of wildebeest. It is placed in the genus Connochaetes and family Bovidae and has a close taxonomic relationship with the black wildebeest. The blue wildebeest is known to have five subspecies. This broad-shouldered antelope has a muscular, front-heavy appearance, with a distinctive robust muzzle. Young blue wildebeest are born tawny brown, and begin to take on their adult colouration at the age of two months. The adults' hues range <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> slate or bluish gray to light gray or even grayish brown. Both sexes possess a pair of large curved horns.|$|E

25|$|The river {{enters the}} valley after {{emerging}} <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> gorge in the Allegheny Plateau above Lock Haven, then turns east entering a broad alluvial flood plain, where it receives the Bald Eagle Creek after passing the town. The flood plain {{lies at the}} foot of the Bald Eagle Mountain ridge, with large fertile farm fields in and around the river's meanders and islands. The valley above the flood plain is a series of knolls below the plateau. Further down the valley, the river receives Pine Creek which has also entered the valley <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> gorge, Pine Creek Gorge (also known as the Grand Canyon of Pennsylvania). East of Williamsport, the Bald Eagle ridge ends, the river turns south, and the valley opens up and follows the river to the water gap at Lewisburg.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the duties}} of {{defensive}} midfielders are primarily defensive, some midfielders are deployed as deep-lying playmakers, due {{to their ability to}} dictate tempo <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> position with their passing. Sometimes a defensive midfielder will be paired with a central midfielder who will act as the deep-lying playmaker. When ever the central midfielder ventures forward the defensive midfielder will hold back.|$|E

25|$|Freediving {{blackout}} {{can occur}} on any dive profile: at constant depth, on an ascent from depth, {{or at the}} surface following ascent from depth and may be described {{by a number of}} terms depending on the dive profile and depth at which consciousness is lost.

25|$|Pinot gris, Pinot grigio or Grauburgunder is a {{white wine}} grape variety of the species Vitis vinifera.

Mullery finished what he had started, by driving the ball home past the German goalkeeper Sepp Maier. Tactically, this goal combines {{the power of the}} long pass with that of the two-man combination, and indeed, before his pass to Newton, Mullery had exchanged passes with Francis Lee before setting off on his final combination run.|$|E
25|$|Understanding {{how these}} troughs {{formed in the}} young Raditladi basin could provide an {{important}} indicator of processes that acted relatively recently in Mercury’s geologic history. There are two main theories of graben formation. The first is that they represent a surface manifestation of ring dikes or cone sheets. Both types of structures form when magma <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> reservoir intrudes into the overlying rocks along conical or cylindrical fractures. The second hypothesis holds that the graben formed {{as a result of}} the floor uplift caused by the weight of the smooths plains outside the crater. Such plains are indeed present to the north and east of Raditladi, although their thickness and age are not known.|$|E
25|$|The sleep {{cycle of}} {{alternate}} NREM and REM sleep takes {{an average of}} 90 minutes, occurring 4–6 times in a good night's sleep. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) divides NREM into three stages: N1, N2, and N3, the last of which is also called delta sleep or slow-wave sleep. The whole period normally proceeds in the order: N1 → N2 → N3 → N2 → REM. REM sleep occurs as a person returns to stage 2 or 1 <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> sleep. There is a greater amount of deep sleep (stage N3) earlier in the night, while the proportion of REM sleep increases in the two cycles just before natural awakening.|$|E

25|$|After a long, painful {{battle with}} infections, {{possibly}} {{brought on by}} his doctors' poking and probing the wound with unwashed hands and non-sterilized instruments, Garfield died on September 19, eleven weeks after being shot. Most modern physicians {{familiar with the case}} state that Garfield would have easily recovered from his wounds with sterile medical care, which was common in the United States ten years later, while Candice Millard argues that Garfield would have survived Guiteau's bullet wound had his doctors simply left him alone. Garfield's biographer Allan Peskin stated that medical malpractice did not contribute to Garfield's death; the inevitable infection and blood poisoning that would ensue <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> bullet wound resulted in damage to multiple organs and spinal bone fragmentation.|$|E
25|$|In 1888, a young Massachusetts writer named Edward Bellamy {{published}} {{a work of}} utopian fiction entitled , telling the Rip Van Winkle-like tale of a 19th-century New England capitalist who awoke <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> slumber to find a completely changed society in the far-distant year of 2000. In Bellamy's tale, a non-violent revolution had transformed the American economy and thereby society; private property had been abolished in favor of state ownership of capital {{and the elimination of}} social classes and the ills of society that he thought inevitably followed from them. In the new world of the year 2000, there was no longer war, poverty, crime, prostitution, corruption, money, or taxes. Neither did there exist such occupations seen by Bellamy as of dubious worth to society, such as politicians, lawyers, merchants, or soldiers.|$|E
25|$|In the 1970s, Thomas Gold {{proposed}} {{the theory that}} life first developed not {{on the surface of}} the Earth, but several kilometres below the surface. It is claimed that discovery of microbial life below the surface of another body in our Solar System would lend significant credence to this theory. Thomas Gold also asserted that a trickle of food <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep,</b> unreachable, source is needed for survival because life arising in a puddle of organic material is likely to consume all of its food and become extinct. Gold's theory is that the flow of such food is due to out-gassing of primordial methane from the Earth's mantle; more conventional explanations of the food supply of deep microbes (away from sedimentary carbon compounds) is that the organisms subsist on hydrogen released by an interaction between water and (reduced) iron compounds in rocks.|$|E

25|$|The {{basement}} {{is thought}} to be Older North American basement, especially in the North, and a number of different accreted terranes, which are mostly covered by Cenozoic volcanism. The northern extent of the Sierra Madre is the Cortés Terrane, although the northern extreme of this contains {{a small portion of the}} Carborca Terrane. Some of the northern end may also be underlain by a Precambrian basement placed around the same time as the Grenville Orogeny. Some of this area has a series of Paleozoic sedimentary sequences <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> marine environment underlying it, which considered by some to be part of the Cotes Terrane and by others to be transported. In some areas distinct sedimentary rocks can be identified by shallow-water Silurian and Mississippian sedimentary rocks underlying deep-water Pennsylvanian and Permian, which are divided by Mississippian rhyolite. The Permian clastics contain some detrital rock that sit alongside low-grade metamorphosed sedimentary and volcanic rocks with serpentinite.|$|E
25|$|The García {{government}} tried {{a series}} of major and minor new policy packages from early 1988 into 1990 to no avail. The new policies never succeeded in shutting off the rapid infusion of Central Bank credit that was feeding inflation, even when they did succeed in driving production down significantly in 1989. Manufacturing production fell 18 percent in that year, agricultural output 3 percent, and total GDP 11 percent. Simultaneously, inflation increased from a record 666 percent in 1988 to a new record of 3,399 percent for 1989. The one positive change was the external current-account deficit: the fall in domestic production and income was so steep that the current account went <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> deficit to a substantial surplus. The internal cost was perhaps clearest in terms of real wages: the minimum wage in real terms for urban labor fell 61 percent between 1987 and 1989, and average real wages in manufacturing fell 59 percent.|$|E
