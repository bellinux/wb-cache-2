5|$|Modern Shift: In today’s society, we are {{beginning}} to see a shift in gender representation in the media particularly in the male fashion industry. Fashion <b>designers</b> <b>are</b> now starting to blur the lines between masculinity and femininity. In the first advertisement, the male has a very soft delicate hold on the rose compared to the typical aggressive grip men exhibit in ads. In the other two examples, both men are not only portraying the idea of feminine touch but the concept of self-touch as well.|$|E
5|$|The {{increasing}} {{importance of}} creative industries (and especially design) in knowledge-intense industries is reflected {{not only in}} the policies and studies on EU levels, but has initiated design and creative policies and programmes in the most advanced economies. Furthermore, design and creativity has been recognised on a regional and local level as a driving force for competitiveness, economic growth, job market, and citizen's satisfaction. The investment in creative and cultural industries are considered a significant component of EU growth in the Lisbon Strategy and the Europe 2020 strategy; and <b>designers</b> <b>are</b> increasingly involved in innovation issues.|$|E

50|$|The {{remaining}} <b>designers</b> <b>were</b> {{flown to}} the Gold Coast for inspiration {{for their next}} challenge. <b>Designers</b> <b>were</b> split into pairs {{in order to create}} two resort wear looks inspired by the Gold Coast. Anna, Timothy, Nerida & Claire (the four most recently eliminated <b>designers)</b> <b>were</b> brought back and told that one of them would win a place back in the competition.|$|R
5|$|The programmers {{identified}} {{early on}} that pathfinding—the ability of the variable-sized characters to navigate through the environment—would be a problem. Huebner cited the difficulty of programming characters to navigate {{an environment in which}} level <b>designers</b> <b>are</b> free to add stairs, ramps, and other 3D objects. They came up with a temporary solution and planned to improve the pathfinding later into development. By the time they properly addressed the problem, many of the levels were almost complete and featured few markers the programmers could use to control movement. They could identify walkable tiles but not walls, cliffs, and other environmental hazards. Ideal solutions, such as creating zones for characters could walk through would have taken too much time to retroactively add into the 100 created levels, so the programmers spent several weeks making small, iterative fixes to conceal the obvious errors in the pathfinding and leave less obvious ones intact.|$|E
25|$|The E-Move Charging Station is {{equipped}} with eight monocrystalline solar panels, which can supply 1.76kWp of solar power. With further refinements, the <b>designers</b> <b>are</b> hoping to generate about 2000kWh of electricity from the panels over the year.|$|E
25|$|The art {{and craft}} of {{designing}} typefaces is called type design. Designers of typefaces are called type designers and are often employed by type foundries. In digital typography, type <b>designers</b> <b>are</b> sometimes also called font developers or font designers.|$|E
50|$|The <b>designers</b> <b>were</b> {{asked to}} create a fashionable children's look to be modeled {{by a group of}} girls aged 5-9. Later the <b>designers</b> <b>were</b> asked {{to create a}}n {{additional}} companion look for their adult models.|$|R
50|$|Main <b>designers</b> <b>were</b> Stanisław Rogalski and Jerzy Drzewiecki of the RWD team, other <b>designers</b> <b>were</b> Bronisław Żurakowski, Tadeusz Chylinski, Leszek Dulęba and Andrzej Anczutin {{and several}} engineers, {{including}} Henry Millicer.

25|$|Other {{manufacturers}} and suppliers include Lane#1, Track, DV8, Roto-Grip, Hammer, Circle Athletic, Columbia 300, Dyno-Thane, Fun Balls, Legends, MoRich, Robby, and Via Bowling. Specially designed shoe design and manufacture {{is also a}} significant enterprise that many companies have gotten involved in next to ball production. Some of the major shoe <b>designers</b> <b>are</b> Circle, Dexter, Etonic, and Linds.|$|E
25|$|Road {{signs in}} the United Kingdom are governed by an {{extremely}} complex and detailed set of guidelines. The basic units of measurement used by sign <b>designers</b> <b>are</b> the 'x-height' (the height of the lower case letter 'x') and the 'stroke width' (sw) (4 sw = 1 x-height). The sizes of borders, symbols and arrows and the spacing and layout of the sign face are expressed in sw, {{so that all the}} elements remain in proportion. The x-height of a sign is dictated mainly by the speed of traffic approaching it, hence 300mm x-heights are common on motorways, whereas parking signs are mostly at 15mm or 20mm x-height.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{distinction}} between measuring and improving software quality in an embedded system (with emphasis on risk management) and software quality in business software (with emphasis on cost and maintainability management) is becoming somewhat irrelevant. Embedded systems now often include a user interface and their <b>designers</b> <b>are</b> as much concerned with issues affecting usability and user productivity as their counterparts who focus on business applications. The latter are in turn looking at ERP or CRM system as a corporate nervous system whose uptime and performance are vital {{to the well-being of}} the enterprise. This convergence is most visible in mobile computing: a user who accesses an ERP application on their smartphone is depending on the quality of software across all types of software layers.|$|E
50|$|<b>Designers</b> <b>were</b> {{to create}} a {{pregnancy}} look for supermodel Rebecca Romijn, who was carrying twins. She {{was looking for something}} that was fashionable and easy to move in, but also something appropriate for a pregnant woman to wear out in public. <b>Designers</b> <b>were</b> given 30 minutes to sketch, a 30-minute shopping spree at Mood with a budget of $100, and two days to complete the look. The prize for the winning <b>designer</b> <b>was</b> immunity for the next challenge.|$|R
5000|$|Episode 2 was an {{unconventional}} materials challenge. In one day, the young <b>designers</b> <b>were</b> required to create garments out of items {{found at a}} carwash. They had three minutes to stuff two bags full of sponges, car mats, hoses, license plates, reflectors, fuzzy dice, and more. Of note <b>is</b> four <b>designers</b> <b>were</b> judged high and two low before a winning designer and an eliminated <b>designer</b> <b>were</b> selected. Zachary, as the winner, has immunity for the third challenge.|$|R
50|$|Mecha fans {{think the}} mecha {{was similar to}} the MSN-100 Hyaku Shiki from Yoshiyuki Tomino's Mobile Suit Z Gundam, {{thinking}} that the mechanical <b>designer</b> <b>was</b> Kunio Okawara. However this was proven false as the true mecha <b>designer</b> <b>was</b> manga artist Takaya Kenji.|$|R
25|$|Competitiveness between {{boats in}} the class is {{maintained}} by requiring the boats to be {{in compliance with the}} 12 Metre formula. Designers and builders are required to take into account such things as the sail area, the boat length at the waterline and the boat girth (the measurement around the boat from one sideboard, under the keel, and then over the top on the opposite side back to the original side). The measurements are then weighted in the formula. For example, the present formula takes the square root of the sail area rather than total area. The combination of weighted measurements must be {{less than or equal to}} 12 metres. <b>Designers</b> <b>are</b> free to change any of the component variables, as well as other details, such as the size of the rudder and keel, so long as the corresponding changes elsewhere produce an ultimate sum of 12 metres and the resulting boat is both seaworthy and safe. Though disparity between boats are minimized by the rule, enough variation exists so that races are as much about design and construction as they are about seamanship and tactics.|$|E
500|$|During the film's {{production}} in 2005, Wintour was reportedly threatening prominent fashion personalities, particularly designers, that Vogue would not cover {{them if they}} made cameo appearances in the movie as themselves. She denied it through a spokesperson {{who said she was}} interested in anything that [...] "supports fashion." [...] Many <b>designers</b> <b>are</b> mentioned in the film. Only one, Valentino Garavani, appeared as himself.|$|E
500|$|Critics praised Super Meat Boys {{platforming}} elements, {{and often}} {{commented on the}} game's difficulty. X-Play reviewer Alexandra Hall said the game had [...] "riveting platforming action", and added that [...] "Super Meat Boys <b>designers</b> <b>are</b> masters of their craft." [...] Henry Gilbert of GamesRadar felt the platforming was [...] "perfect". He wrote that [...] "while it's always tough and demanding, it never feels cheap, or like the game is cheating you." [...] A reviewer from GameTrailers stated that [...] "the difficulty rides the perfect line between driving you utterly bonkers when you fail and making {{you feel like a}} platform pro when you succeed". Joystiq's Richard Mitchell echoed other reviewers' comments: [...] "Super Meat Boy is tough, as tough as the toughest nails in the toughest universe." [...] Gilbert cited the level of difficulty, which he believed made the game inaccessible to some players, as his reason for not awarding the game a perfect score. Tom McShea of GameSpot praised the game's [...] "precise control", [...] "excellent level design", and [...] "smooth difficulty curve". Reviewer Tom Bramwell of Eurogamer warned that Super Meat Boy is [...] "a hard game. It should make you want to throw the pad across the room".|$|E

500|$|Upon its release, {{the album}} met with mixed reviews. At Metacritic it holds an {{aggregate}} score of 54 out of 100 points, indicating generally mixed or average reviews. Simon Cage from the Daily Express gave the album {{three out of}} five stars and felt that although she [...] "has a winning way with ostentatious hats", Gaga's true talent lies in selling the same album over and over again. [...] "It’s great but... enough already!" [...] Music critic J. D. Considine, while reviewing the album for The Globe and Mail, complimented the piano and voice version of [...] "Poker Face" [...] adding that the latter was [...] "the smartest track on her newest remix album". He felt that the song [...] "brings out her inner Elton John. And yes, this move, too, is probably just another bit of calculated image management, but that doesn’t make it any less brilliant." [...] Robert Copsey from Digital Spy noted that the release of The Remix was a more natural progression than music labels trying to [...] "cash-in" [...] by releasing something not associated with the artist. He complimented the remixers featured in the album, calling them [...] "as vital to keeping the singer's music fresh as her Haus Of GaGa <b>designers</b> <b>are</b> to her image." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{way that}} brands are {{displayed}} {{is also part}} of the overall retail design. Where a product is placed on the shelves has implications for purchase likelihood as a result of visibility and access. Products placed too high or too low on the shelves may not turn over as quickly as those placed at eye level. [...] With respect to access, store <b>designers</b> <b>are</b> increasingly giving consideration to access for disabled and elderly customers.|$|E

2500|$|Plans for {{the library}} {{included}} an enlarged space for books and for a children's library and local studies centre, with a space for teenagers. Local people including teachers were involved with planning. Canterbury City Council, Kent County Council, private sources and donations made up the project funding to £11.5 million, with the South East England Development Agency (SEEDA) contributing £975,000. Planners were John Miller & Partners; architects were Sidell Gibson who oversaw restoration of Windsor Castle after the fire; interior <b>designers</b> <b>are</b> Casson Mann, who have devised a theme of [...] "explorer points".|$|E
2500|$|The {{neighbourhood}} of Palermo, {{particularly the}} {{area known as}} Soho, is where the latest fashion and design trends are presented. The [...] "sub-barrio" [...] of Palermo Viejo is also a popular port of call for fashion in the city. An increasing number of young, independent <b>designers</b> <b>are</b> also setting up their own shops in the bohemian neighbourhood of San Telmo, known for its wide variety of markets and antique shops. Recoleta, on the other hand, is the quintessential neighbourhood for exclusive and upscale fashion houses. In particular, Avenida Alvear {{is home to the}} most exclusive representatives of haute couture in the city.|$|E
2500|$|The second challenge, the Elimination Challenge, has each contestant, either {{individually}} or {{as part of}} a team, create a design based on certain requirements or goals.
