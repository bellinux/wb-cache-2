5|$|Badami, also {{referred}} to as Vatapi, Vatapipura, Vatapinagari and Agastya Tirtha in historical texts, the capital of Chalukya dynasty in the 6th century, is at the exit point of a ravine between two steep mountain cliffs. Four cave temples in the <b>escarpment</b> of the hill to the south-east of the town were carved into the cliff's monolithic stone face. The <b>escarpment</b> is above a man made lake called Agastya Lake, created by an earthen dam faced with stone steps. To the west end of this cliff, at its lowest point, is the first cave temple. The largest and highest cave is Cave 3, which is further to the east on the northern face of the hill. The fourth cave, Cave 4, is a few steps down further east.|$|E

50|$|When {{sedimentary}} {{beds are}} tilted and {{exposed to the}} surface, erosion and weathering may occur. <b>Escarpments</b> erode gradually and over geological time. The mélange tendencies of <b>escarpments</b> results in varying contacts between a multitude of rock types. These different rock types weather at different speeds, according to Goldich dissolution series so different stages of deformation can often {{be seen in the}} layers where the <b>escarpments</b> have been exposed to the elements. These varying levels of erosion can lead to strange features forming in the exposed rock.|$|R
5|$|Beyond the Upper Ottawa Street crossing, {{residential}} {{developments are}} confined to {{the north side of}} the Linc as it curves southward, descending towards the top of the Red Hill Valley. Surrounded by undeveloped land, it meets the northern end of Dartnall Road at a trumpet interchange, with Mt. Albion Conservation Area to the southeast and the Red Hill Creek passing beneath the interchange to traverse the Niagara <b>Escarpment</b> at Albion Falls. The Linc gradually curves back northeast, now surrounded, passing under Pritchard Road. Immediately east of there, the Mud Street interchange branches off as the route curves northward and becomes the Red Hill Valley Parkway, which descends the <b>escarpment</b> towards the QEW.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{incarnation of}} Highway55 travelled through Hamilton. It {{was established in}} 1937, following Upper Gage Avenue north from Rymal Road (itself designated Highway53 that same year) to Crockett Avenue and the Sherman Access.

5|$|The prehistoric {{breakup of}} the supercontinent Gondwana {{separated}} the Madagascar–Antarctica–India landmass from the Africa–South America landmass around 135million years ago. Madagascar later split from India about 88million years ago, allowing plants and animals on the island to evolve in relative isolation. Along {{the length of the}} eastern coast runs a narrow and steep <b>escarpment</b> containing much of the island's remaining tropical lowland forest.|$|E

5|$|Throughout its length, {{the highway}} gently climbs the Niagara <b>Escarpment,</b> {{reaching}} the top east of Stanley Avenue before crossing the Niagara Gorge.

5|$|After {{crossing}} into Greene County, {{the road}} intersects NY23A at an undeveloped junction. NY32 remains in its straight course through the lowlands below the <b>escarpment,</b> passing through mostly woodlands and the hamlet of Kiskatom, then winding around {{the north side}} of Cairo Roundtop before it joins with NY23 at Cairo. After , NY32 leaves the divided highway to once again strike north as a two-lane route. It trends west to its westernmost point until turning to the north-northeast just south of Freehold.|$|E

40|$|For large fishes, {{seagrass}} canopies typically {{provide a}} relatively flat habitat on seabeds, but seagrasses in the genus Posidonia can provide additional habitat complexity by forming organic-rich deposits known as mats. Erosional processes can scour channels through the mats, {{resulting in the}} formation of <b>escarpments</b> with caves. Here we report that reef fishes, such as groupers, inhabit the caves found within mat <b>escarpments.</b> The characteristics of the cavities are highly variable, ranging from small-elongated holes to deep caves with large entrances. The origin of these caves (biological and/or geological) is unknown, but it is possible that fish behavior enhance their formation. Posidonia seagrass <b>escarpments</b> provide a complex 3 D habitat for reef fish that is not provided by typical canopy structure of seagrass. Further studies are required to gain insights into the natural history of seagrass <b>escarpments</b> and their ecological importance...|$|R

It served as the terminus of Great Eastern Railway services from London and Norwich. Initially named Cromer on opening, it was renamed Cromer High on 27 September 1948.|$|E
5|$|Div Cav resumed the {{offensive}} on 4 November, advancing south-west against retreating Axis forces and ending {{the day at}} Agramiya. The regiment advanced on the northern flank of the New Zealand Division the next day, screening the division at the recaptured Baggush Box on 6 November. It then set off towards Mersa Matruh on the coast road and the <b>escarpment,</b> {{in contact with the}} 9th Armoured Brigade. The regiment halted at Gambut on 13 November, moving east to Menastir six days later.|$|E
5|$|King's Highway55, {{commonly}} referred to as Highway55 and historically as the Niagara Stone Road and Black Swamp Road, was a provincially maintained highway in the Canadian province of Ontario, which connected the Queen Elizabeth Way (QEW) with Niagara-on-the-Lake, following Niagara Stone Road. The route divided a swath of wineries {{at the foot of the}} Niagara <b>Escarpment,</b> passing at an oblique angle to the concession road grid.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} <b>escarpments</b> (cliffs) {{to the south}} of Tobruk (and indeed in all of Cyrenaica, the eastern half of Libya). These <b>escarpments</b> {{generally}} have their high sides to the south and their low sides (dip slopes) to the north.

5|$|The Apennine mountains, which rise to {{a height}} of nearly farther above the mare plain than the Himalayan front above the Indian and Nepalese plainsare {{hypothesized}} to be fault-block mountains displaced upward and segmented by the impact that formed Mare Imbrium. The frontal <b>escarpment</b> of Mons Hadley Delta {{is believed to be}} an exposed segment of the pre-Imbrium impact lunar crust. This made the mountain one of the mission's primary objectives, as it would allow the astronauts to obtain samples of the lunar crust as it was before the creation of Mare Imbrium.|$|E
5|$|The Lincoln Alexander Parkway, nicknamed The Linc, is a {{municipal}} expressway in the Canadian city of Hamilton, Ontario, which connects Highway403 with the Red Hill Valley Parkway, which continues {{north to the}} Queen Elizabeth Way (QEW). Collectively, the two expressways form a southern and eastern bypass of Hamilton. Located on the Hamilton mountain, atop the Niagara <b>Escarpment,</b> the freeway was named after the former Progressive Conservative MP and first black Lieutenant Governor of Ontario, Lincoln Alexander in July 1997, despite him never holding a driver's license.|$|E
5|$|The long-awaited {{excavation}} {{began on}} 29 September 2004, {{led by a}} handful of archaeologists and dedicated archaeology volunteers called Southeast Asian Archaeology. Nearly 2 metres down, the volunteers uncovered significant remains of the fort still in situ—a pair of infantry bastions that did not appear in the original plans, the perimeter of the moat's inner <b>escarpment</b> and {{what appears to be the}} drawbridge superstructure. Experts call it Singapore's only 'true fort'—one with protection all around—and it was considered one of Singapore's most important archaeological finds.|$|E

5|$|The waterfalls are on {{the section}} of Kitchen Creek that flows down the Allegheny Front, a steep <b>escarpment</b> between the Allegheny Plateau {{to the north and}} the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians to the south. The glens are made of {{sedimentary}} rocks from the Huntley Mountain and Catskill Formations that formed up to 370million years ago in the Devonian and Carboniferous periods. The waterfalls are the result of increased flow in Kitchen Creek from glaciers enlarging its drainage basin during the last Ice Age.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{learning}} that the Prussian army {{was able to}} support him, Wellington decided to offer battle on the Mont-Saint-Jean <b>escarpment,</b> across the Brussels road. Here he withstood repeated attacks by the French throughout the afternoon, aided by the progressively arriving Prussians. In the evening Napoleon committed his last reserves to a desperate final attack, which was narrowly beaten back. With the Prussians breaking through on the French right flank, Wellington's Anglo-allied army counter-attacked in the centre, and the French army was routed.|$|E
