40|$|The {{settlement}} rule used {{to determine}} payments in electricity market auctions can have {{a profound impact on}} the amount paid for a particular service. This paper evaluates two auction settlement rules: the uniform price auction in which the last offer accepted determines the price paid to all participants and the <b>discriminatory</b> <b>price</b> auction in which each participant is paid the amount bid by that party. Using an electricity market simulation tool to model the markets for energy and various ancillary services in a large control area, it is demonstrated that under conditions of market power substantial revenues with commensurately high profits can be commanded under a uniform price auction. By employing a <b>discriminatory</b> <b>price</b> rule, much of the impact of market power can be ameliorated. In addition, a <b>discriminatory</b> <b>price</b> auction, by virtue of requiring each bidder to explicitly state their desired revenue rate, provides greater visibility of attempts to make use of strategic pricing and market power. By discouraging the use of market power through greater price visibility, <b>discriminatory</b> <b>price</b> auctions also have the potential to reduce instances of strategic capacity withholding, which in turn, should enhance overall system reliability. 1...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} selling a single item to one of n bidders who arrive sequentially with values drawn independently from identical distributions, and ask how much more revenue {{can be obtained by}} posting <b>discriminatory</b> <b>prices</b> to individual bidders rather than the same anonymous price to all of them. The ratio between the maximum revenue from <b>discriminatory</b> <b>pricing</b> and that from anonymous pricing is at most 2 - 1 /n for arbitrary distributions and at most 1 /(1 -(1 - 1 /n) ^n) ≤ e/(e- 1) ≈ 1. 582 for regular distributions, and these bounds can in fact be obtained by using one of the <b>discriminatory</b> <b>prices</b> as an anonymous one. The bounds are shown via a relaxation of the <b>discriminatory</b> <b>pricing</b> problem rather than virtual values and thus apply to distributions without a density, and they are tight for all values of n. For a class of distributions that includes the uniform and the exponential distribution we show the maximization of revenue to be equivalent to the maximization of welfare with an additional bidder, in the sense that both use the same <b>discriminatory</b> <b>prices.</b> The problem of welfare maximization is the well-known Cayley-Moser problem, and this connection can be used to establish that the revenue gap between <b>discriminatory</b> and anonymous <b>pricing</b> is approximately 1. 037 for the uniform distribution and approximately 1. 073 for the exponential distribution...|$|R

40|$|The auction {{literature}} {{indicates that}} {{uncertainty about the}} value of auctioned goods increases underpricing in <b>discriminatory</b> <b>price</b> auctions. Such uncertainty has a smaller effect on uniform price auctions because the pricing rule aggregates bidders' information. We find that uncertainty resulting from inexperience with an auction mechanism has similar effects. Using initial public offering (IPO) data from Japan and Israel, we find that average underpricing increases temporarily in Japan's <b>discriminatory</b> <b>price</b> auctions after changes in the auction rules, which suggests that bidders reduce their bids in response to uncertainty.

40|$|Results of {{the recent}} US Treasury {{experiment}} comparing uniform and <b>discriminatory</b> <b>price</b> auctions suggest that uniform price auctions achieve lower award concentration and higher average revenues but experience higher variance of revenues from auction to auction relative to <b>discriminatory</b> <b>price</b> auctions. In other words, uniform pricing offers higher risk for higher return. This apparent trade-off may deter some sellers considering the switch from discriminatory to uniform pricing; thus, {{it is important to}} investigate whether these results can be generalized. The Treasury's results are driven by the tendency for bidders in the uniform auctions to submit multiple bids at a wide range of prices, essentially steep bid curves, instead of the flat bids submitted in the discriminatory auctions. However, theory and data from discriminatory auctions in Sweden and Portugal suggest that bidders in discriminatory auctions will submit steeper bids when there is more potential for winner's curse. It is possible that bidders in the US auctions, which are preceded by a when-issued market, are relatively unconcerned with the winner's curse. We examine the auction formats in an environment much more likely to generate the winner's curse: the initial public offering market. We compare <b>discriminatory</b> <b>price</b> auctions in Japan and uniform price auctions in Israel on the basis of revenue and slope of the demand curves and test a number of divisible good auction theory implications. In contrast with the Treasury's results, we find that revenues are likely to be insignificantly different in the discriminatory and uniform price auctions and that bid curves may be equally steep under both formats in markets with information asymmetry. The winner's curse increases underpricing and steepens demand curves in Japan's <b>discriminatory</b> <b>price</b> auctions but not in Israel's uniform price auctions.

40|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} {{debate in the}} literature concerning whether uniform or discriminatory pricing raise more revenue in Treasury Bill auctions. A standard ap-proach has been to examine empirically how revenue changes given a switch from one type to the other. The weakness {{of this approach is}} that such a revenue change may be due to changes in economic conditions. This paper is the first to examine the two meth-ods while taking into account changes in economic conditions. To do this, it adopts a three-stage procedure. First, it fits a logistic function to the cumulative bid distribution for each auction. Second, it estimates two sets of equations relating the logistic function parameters to economic conditions, one for uniform and one for discriminatory pricing, on the assumption that T-bill offerings by the government are exogenous. And third, using the estimated equations, it predicts how much revenue would have been raised from <b>discriminatory</b> <b>price</b> auctions if instead uniform pricing had been used, holding economic condition constant, and vice versa. The data employed are for Turkish Trea-sury auctions from 2000 - 2002, in the middle of which the Turkish Treasury switched auction types.

We study whether this choice depends on the uncertainty about the number of participating bidders by comparing expected revenues under <b>discriminatory</b> and uniform <b>pricing</b> within an auction model with affiliated values, stochastic number of bidders, and linear bidding strategies. We show that if uncertainty about the number of bidders is substantial, then the <b>discriminatory</b> <b>pricing</b> generates higher expected revenues than the uniform pricing. In particular, the first-price auction might generate higher revenues than the second-price auction. Therefore, uncertainty about the number of bidders is an important factor to consider when choosing the pricing rule.
