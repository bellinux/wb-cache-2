5|$|The <b>Gila</b> <b>monster</b> has one close living relative, the {{beaded lizard}} (H. horridum), {{as well as}} many extinct {{relatives}} in the Helodermatidae, the evolutionary history of which may {{be traced back to the}} Cretaceous period. The genus Heloderma has existed since the Miocene, when H. texana lived, and fragments of osteoderms from the <b>Gila</b> <b>monster</b> have been found in late Pleistocene (10,000–8,000 years ago) deposits near Las Vegas, Nevada. Because the helodermatids have remained relatively unchanged morphologically, they are occasionally regarded as living fossils. Although the <b>Gila</b> <b>monster</b> appears closely related to the monitor lizards (varanids) of Africa, Asia and Australia, their wide geographical separation and the unique features not found in the varanids indicate the <b>Gila</b> <b>monster</b> is better placed in a separate family.|$|E

5|$|Prey may {{be crushed}} to death if large or eaten alive if small, {{swallowed}} head-first, and helped down by muscular contractions and neck flexing. Unusually, after food has been swallowed, the <b>Gila</b> <b>monster</b> immediately resumes tongue flicking and search behavior, probably {{as a result}} of a history of finding clumped prey such as eggs and young in nests. Gila monsters are able to climb trees and cacti in search of eggs.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the social {{behavior}} of H. suspectum, but they have been observed engaging in male-male combat, in which the dominant male lies on top of the subordinate one and pins it with its front and hind limbs. Both lizards arch their bodies, pushing against each other and twisting around in an effort to gain the dominant position. A wrestling match ends when the pressure exerted forces them to separate, although bouts may be repeated one after the other. These bouts are typically observed just before the mating season. Those with greater strength and endurance are thought to win more often and enjoy greater reproductive success. Although the <b>Gila</b> <b>monster</b> has a low metabolism and one of the lowest lizard sprint speeds, it {{has one of the highest}} aerobic scope values (the increase in oxygen consumption from rest to maximum metabolic exertion) among lizards, allowing them to engage in intense aerobic activity for a sustained period of time. Males have been observed to have higher aerobic scopes than females, presumably because of sexual selection for a trait advantageous in prolonged combat. The <b>Gila</b> <b>monster</b> may live up to 20 years in the wild, or 30 in captivity.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Gila</b> <b>monster</b> {{is found}} in the Southwestern United States and Mexico, a range {{including}} Sonora, Arizona, parts of California, Nevada, Utah, and New Mexico (potentially including Baja California). They inhabit scrubland, succulent desert, and oak woodland, seeking shelter in burrows, thickets, and under rocks in locations with ready access to moisture. In fact, Gila monsters seem to like water and can be observed immersing themselves in puddles of water after a summer rain. They avoid living in open areas such as flats and farmland.|$|E

50|$|In the description, Estesia was {{assigned}} to Varanoidea, as the sister group to Varanidae, based on skull characters. However, the new material found in 1993 provided evidence that Estesia was not closely related to modern varanids, but rather a distant relative of <b>Gila</b> <b>monsters.</b> The phylogenetic analysis presented by Norell and Gao (1997) actually supported {{the creation of a}} new group that included modern <b>Gila</b> <b>monsters</b> and extinct pre-historic forms, the Monstersauria.|$|R

25|$|Other {{reptiles}} in {{the region}} include lizards and turtles. Lizards are highly represented {{in the region}}, the most distinctive denizen being the <b>Gila</b> <b>monster,</b> native only to the American Southwest {{and the state of}} Sonora in Mexico. Other lizards include: Sonoran collared lizard (Crotaphytus nebrius); several types of geckos, including western banded gecko (Coleonyx variegatus), the common house gecko (Hemidactylus frenatus), and the Mediterranean house gecko (Hemidactylus turcicus), the last two species being non-native to the region but have been introduced; the desert iguana (Dipsosaurus dorsalis); the chuckwalla (Sauromalus ater); the greater earless lizard (Cophosaurus texanus scitulus); several sub-species of horned lizards (Phrynosoma); numerous species of spiny lizards (Sceloporus); Gilbert's skink (Plestiodon gilberti); the western skink (Plestiodon skiltonianus); Trans-Pecos striped whiptail (Aspidoscelis inornata heptagrammus); and the Arizona night lizard (Xantusia arizonae). Turtles are less numerous than their other reptilian counterparts, but several are found in the region, including: the western painted turtle (Chrysemys picta bellii); the Rio Grande cooter (Pseudemys gorzugi); the desert box turtle (Terrapene ornata luteola); the Big Bend slider (Trachemys gaigeae gaigeae); the Sonora mud turtle (Kinosternon sonoriense); and the desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii).|$|E

500|$|Though the <b>Gila</b> <b>monster</b> is venomous, its laggard {{movement}} {{means it}} poses little threat to humans. However, it {{has earned a}} fearsome reputation and is often killed by humans because of fear. Among Native American tribes, the <b>Gila</b> <b>monster</b> had a mixed standing. The Apache believed its breath could kill a man, and the Tohono O'Odham and the Pima believed it possessed a spiritual power that could cause sickness. In contrast, the Seri and the Yaqui believed the Gila monster's hide had healing properties. The <b>Gila</b> <b>monster</b> has even starred as a monster in a B movie, The Giant <b>Gila</b> <b>Monster</b> (though the titular monster was actually portrayed by a Mexican beaded lizard). It played a minor role in the motion picture The Treasure of the Sierra Madre. [...] Myths about the animal include that the animal's breath is toxic enough to kill humans, that it can spit venom and that it can leap several {{feet in the air}} to attack. Another myth held that the <b>Gila</b> <b>monster</b> did not have an anus and therefore expelled waste from its mouth, the source of its venom and [...] "fetid breath". The official mascot of [...] Eastern Arizona College located in Thatcher, Arizona, is Gila Hank, a gun-toting, cowboy-hat-wearing <b>Gila</b> <b>monster.</b> A similar character as an old western outlaw was seen in 2011 animated film Rango, called Bad Bill; the character was voiced by Ray Winstone.|$|E
500|$|The <b>Gila</b> <b>monster</b> (Heloderma suspectum, [...] ) is {{a species}} of venomous lizard native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexican state of Sonora. A heavy, {{typically}} slow-moving lizard, up to [...] long, the <b>Gila</b> <b>monster</b> is the only venomous lizard native to the United States and {{one of only two}} known species of venomous lizards in North America, the other being its close relative, the Mexican beaded lizard (H. horridum). Though the <b>Gila</b> <b>monster</b> is venomous, its sluggish nature means it represents little threat to humans. However, it has earned a fearsome reputation and is sometimes killed despite being protected by state law in Arizona.|$|E

It uses its extremely acute sense of smell to locate prey, especially eggs. Its sense of smell is so keen, it can locate and dig up chicken eggs buried [...] deep and accurately follow a trail made by rolling an egg.|$|E

50|$|The {{teeth of}} Estesia were sharp and recurved, like in modern varanoids. These teeth possess {{longitudinal}} grooves that run {{both from the}} anterior and posterior tooth surfaces during the entire tooth length.

500|$|The <b>Gila</b> <b>monster</b> {{produces}} venom in modified {{salivary glands}} in its lower jaw, unlike snakes, whose venom {{is produced in}} the upper jaw. The <b>Gila</b> <b>monster</b> lacks the musculature to forcibly inject the venom; instead, the venom is propelled from the gland to the tooth by chewing. Capillary action brings the venom out of the tooth and into the victim. The teeth are loosely anchored, which allows them to be broken off and replaced throughout life. Gila monsters have been observed to flip over while biting the victim, presumably to aid {{the flow of the}} venom into the wound. Because the Gila monster's prey consists mainly of eggs, small animals, and otherwise [...] "helpless" [...] prey, the Gila monster's venom is thought to have evolved for defensive rather than for hunting use. A defensive use would explain the Gila monster's bright warning coloration.|$|E
500|$|Fossilized skin {{impressions}} {{have also}} been found.

In the later Ankylosauria, these small scutes may have developed into larger scutes, fusing into the multi-osteodermal plate armour seen in genera such as Ankylosaurus.|$|E
500|$|Dr. Handy's friend, Dr. George Goodfellow of Tombstone, {{was among}} the first to {{research}} the actual effects of <b>Gila</b> <b>monster</b> venom. Scientific American reported in 1890 that [...] "The breath is very fetid, and its odor can be detected at some little distance from the lizard. It is supposed that this is one way in which the monster catches the insects and small animals which form a part of its food supply—the foul gas overcoming them." [...] Goodfellow offered to pay local residents $5.00 for <b>Gila</b> <b>monster</b> specimens. He bought several and collected more on his own. In 1891 he purposefully provoked one of his captive lizards into biting him on his finger. The bite made him ill and he spent the next five days in bed, but he completely recovered. When Scientific American ran another ill-founded report on the lizard's ability to kill people, he wrote in reply and described his own studies and personal experience. He wrote that he knew several people who had been bitten by Gila monsters but had not died from the bite.|$|E
