He had a career-high 32 points on January 2, 2013, to propel Villanova to a 98–86 overtime victory over St. John's. This performance earned Arcidiacono Big East rookie of the week honors for the week of January 6. In the January 26 contest against third-ranked Syracuse, Arcidiacono made a 3-pointer with 2.2 seconds remaining in regulation {{to tie the game}} at 61. The Wildcats ended up defeating Syracuse in overtime 75–71. Arcidiacono earned his fourth rookie of the week honors in the last week of the regular season.|$|E

5|$|Hennessey {{attended}} Youngstown State University and set several {{school records}} {{during his tenure}} with the team. In 2001, he was selected by the Giants {{in the first round}} of the draft. He did not pitch in 2002 because of surgery to remove a non-cancerous tumor <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>back.</b> In 2004, he reached the major leagues for the first time. He spent much of the 2005 season in the major leagues, making 21 starts and posting a 4.64 earned run average (ERA). In 2006, Hennessey spent time both in the Giants' starting rotation and the bullpen. He became a relief pitcher full-time in 2007, spending the entire season in the majors and closing for the Giants part of the time. After posting a 7.81 ERA with the Giants in 2008, Hennessey was outrighted to the minors; he refused the assignment and became a free agent. He attempted to pitch for the Baltimore Orioles in 2009 but was unable due to injury. Hennessey then spent parts of 2010 and 2011 in the minor leagues.|$|E
5|$|In early 2008, he was {{diagnosed}} with malignant melanoma, a severe form of skin cancer. He had fought the disease before, when he had a form of skin cancer removed <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> in 2006. Cooksey suspected his cancer originated from a six-month spell coaching schoolchildren in the searing heat of Las Vegas in the United States. In April 2008, Grays Athletic staged a benefit match for Cooksey. The match consisted of former professional players, as well as current professionals such as Leroy Lita, Nicky Shorey, Aaron McLean, Ray Parlour, Justin Edinburgh, Iain Dowie, Bob Dowie, Clive Allen, Scott Fitzgerald and Paul Merson. He returned to his former club Oldham Athletic in May 2008, where another benefit match was staged for his appeal at Boundary Park, attended by 1,500 fans to see such former players as John Barnes, Luther Blissett and Chris Waddle as well as television actors from Coronation Street.|$|E

25|$|Howard {{finished}} {{the season with}} his lowest scoring average since his second year in the NBA, and he made under 50% of his free throws {{for the second straight}} year. However, he was the league leader in rebounding and ranked second in field goal percentage. Although he was recovering <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> surgery, he only missed six games all season—all due to his torn labrum. Howard was named to the All-NBA Third Team after five consecutive first-team honors. He became a free agent in the summer, and was offered a maximum contract of five years for $118 million from the Lakers matched with four years for $88 million from other teams.|$|E

He won a unanimous decision over UFC veteran Jeremy Horn {{in his first}} fight, and then another over Pancrase veteran Ryushi Yanagisawa. These two wins qualified him for the final event of the tournament, in March 2001. Before that, he was offered {{a shot at the}} UFC Heavyweight Championship against Kevin Randleman on Nov. 17, 2000. He was taken down in the first two rounds, but defended well <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>back,</b> negating most of Randleman's ground and pound attempts. In the third round, he tripped Randleman to the mat and landed several strikes from full mount for a TKO victory and his second UFC Heavyweight Championship.|$|E

25|$|Finally it was {{announced}} that Kiyoshi Tamura and Kazushi Sakuraba were set to fight at the K-1 Dynamite!! 2008 event on December 31. The fight featured Sakuraba fighting mostly <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>back,</b> attempting armbars, kneebars and triangle chokes from his guard while Tamura defended them and applied ground and pound. At {{the end of the first}} round, Sakuraba appeared to have an armbar locked in, but the bell sounded before he could extend the arm. Tamura held on at the second, controlling much of the action and consistently kicking Sakuraba's injured legs; he was taken down in the final minute by Sakuraba, who immediately launched a barrage of punches, only for the bell to end his attacks again. Ultimately, Tamura was awarded a unanimous decision.|$|E
25|$|Bird's body, however, {{continued}} to break down. He had been bothered by back problems for years, and his back became progressively worse. After leading the Celtics to a 29–5 {{start to the}} 1990–91 season, he missed 22 games due to a compressed nerve root in his back, a condition that would eventually lead to his retirement. He had off-season surgery to remove a disc <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>back,</b> but his back problems continued and he missed 37 games during the 1991–92 season. His past glory would be briefly rekindled, however, {{in a game that}} season in which he scored 49 points in a double-overtime victory over the Portland Trail Blazers. During the 1992 Eastern Conference semi-finals against the Cleveland Cavaliers, Bird missed four of the seven games in the series due to those recurring back problems.|$|E
25|$|The MCC had {{announced}} immediately before First Test that the Cambridge and Sussex all-rounder Ted Dexter would be flown in as a reinforcement and {{he arrived in}} Sydney in time join the team {{on its way to}} Tasmania. Willie Watson was brought back as an opener instead of Arthur Milton. The first day was lost to rain, but Peter May won the toss, batted and saw Richardson (56) and Watson (30) add 72 against the weak Tasmanian attack. Dexter made 38 and May 80 (including 2 sixes) when he declared on 229/7. Fred Trueman (3/36) had recovered <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> illness by drinking copious amounts of lemon juice and he and Frank Tyson reduced the home team to 18/3 before stumps. On the next drizzle-filled day they reached 94/4 thanks to 52 not out from left-hander Ray Stokes before rain finally stopped play.|$|E

Billy shows one of the mogwai to his former science teacher Mr. Hanson, spawning another mogwai, who Hanson experiments on. Back at home, Stripe’s gang tricks Billy into feeding them after midnight by chewing out the power cord to his bedside clock. They make cocoons, as does Hanson’s mogwai. Shortly after, the cocoons hatch and they emerge as mischievous, reptilian monsters that torture Gizmo and try to murder Billy’s mother, while Hanson is killed by his gremlin.|$|E
25|$|The {{loss of the}} First Test was {{not the end of}} {{the series}} and Peter May well remembered the {{crushing}} Brisbane defeat in the First Test of the 1954–55 Ashes series, which Len Hutton had won 3–1. Arthur Milton had returned to form with innings of 85 against Tasmania, but had broken his finger in a gutsy 37 against South Australia. With the spare opener Raman Subba Row nursing a broken wrist Willie Watson—who had been part of the 1950 FIFA World Cup England squad in Brazil—was brought in, but Trevor Bailey was promoted to the opening spot regardless of his paralysing influence at Brisbane. Fred Trueman had recovered <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> trouble to take 5/46 and 4/33 against South Australia and said he was fully fit, but was not chosen. Instead May preferred to keep the pace attack that had bowled so accurately in the first innings at Brisbane. The Australians dropped Peter Burge from their twelve-man squad and brought in the 22-year-old Keith Slater who had taken 4/33 for Western Australia in the first match of the tour and could bowl both fast-medium and off-spin. In the end he was twelfth man instead of the talented batsman Bobby Simpson, who made his Ashes debut.|$|E
25|$|Later Krishna told Arjuna how {{he could}} bring down Bhishma, through the help of Sikhandhi. The Pandavas were {{initially}} not agreeable to such a ploy, as by using such cheap tactics {{they would not be}} following the path of Dharma, but Krishna suggested a clever alternative. And thus, on the next day, the tenth day of battle Shikhandi accompanied Arjuna on the latter's chariot and they faced Bhishma who put his bow and arrows down. He was then felled in battle by Arjuna, pierced by innumerable arrows. Using Sikhandhi as a shield, Arjuna shot arrows at Bhishma, piercing his entire body. Thus, as was preordained (Mahadeva's boon to Amba that she would be the cause of Bhishma's death) Shikhandi, that is, Amba reincarnated was the cause of Bhishma's fall. As Bhishma fell, his whole body was held above the ground by the shafts of Arjuna's arrows which protruded <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>back,</b> and through his arms and legs. Seeing Bhishma lying on such a bed of arrows humbled even the gods who watched from the heavens in reverence. They silently blessed the mighty warrior. When the young princes of both armies gathered around him, inquiring if there was anything they could do, he told them that while his body lay on the bed of arrows above the ground, his head hung unsupported. Hearing this, many of the princes, both Kaurava and the Pandava alike brought him pillows of silk and velvet, but he refused them. He asked Arjuna to give him a pillow fit for a warrior. Arjuna then removed three arrows from his quiver and placed them underneath Bhishma's head, the pointed arrow tips facing upwards. To quench the war veteran's thirst, Arjuna shot an arrow into the earth, and a jet stream of water rose up and into Bhishma's mouth. It is said that Ganga herself rose to quench her son's thirst.|$|E
