25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century Atlantic City and the South Jersey {{seashore}} were major seaside vacation destinations for the Philadelphia area's wealthy and working class populations. The popularity of South Jersey's seashore {{was made possible}} by rail transport which provided inexpensive and <b>fast</b> <b>service</b> between the Philadelphia area's population centers and the seashore.|$|E
25|$|Clipper ships sacrificed cargo {{capacity}} for speed, {{but in some}} markets, the <b>fast</b> <b>service</b> allowed their owners to charge premium rates (Tea from China tasted better if it was fresh, so the cargo on the first ship of the season to arrive in New York was worth more). Also, faster speed meant that the vessel could complete more voyages in a given time period, which also helped {{make up for the}} diminished {{cargo capacity}}.|$|E

25|$|Bypassing 30th Street Station {{by using}} the New York-Pittsburgh Subway would allow trains to skip a {{time-consuming}} stop and reverse of directions at 30th St Station and allow <b>fast</b> <b>service</b> between New York and Harrisburg. Historically, the PRR fast trains going to NY from the west would bypass 30th St Station, and passengers for Philadelphia would change trains at North Philadelphia. One study suggested two daily electric-train round-trips between New York and Harrisburg with stops in North Philadelphia and Ardmore, a routing last used by Keystone trains in 1994.|$|E
25|$|London Midland {{also run}} a <b>fast</b> <b>service</b> between Watford Junction and London Euston along the West Coast Main Line (which runs {{parallel}} to the Watford DC Line), calling at Bushey and Harrow & Wealdstone before running non-stop to Euston. The service offers a quicker alternative to the all-stations London Overground service, especially as the operator now accepts TfL's Oystercard ticketing. Some peak services to/from Euston are advertised as starting/terminating at South Hampstead or Queens Park or Harrow and Wealdstone in order to persuade passengers to take the frequent faster services.|$|E
25|$|Installation {{and service}} / {{maintenance}} of off-shore wind farms are a specific challenge for technology and economic {{operation of a}} wind farm. , there are 20 jackup vessels for lifting components, but few can lift sizes above 5MW. Service vessels have to be operated nearly 24/7 (availability higher than 80% of time) to get sufficient amortisation from the wind turbines. Therefore, special <b>fast</b> <b>service</b> vehicles for installation (like Wind Turbine Shuttle) {{as well as for}} maintenance (including heave compensation and heave compensated working platforms to allow the service staff to enter the wind turbine also at difficult weather conditions) are required. So-called inertial and optical based Ship Stabilization and Motion Control systems (iSSMC) are used for that.|$|E

25|$|After {{the slow}} start, {{electric}} trams rapidly became very popular; by 1903, there were 300 electric tramcars in London, which carried 800,000 passengers over Whitsun weekend in 1903. The London County Council Tramways first electric line opened in May 1903 between Westminster Bridge and Tooting and the LCC sold 3.3 million tickets {{in its third}} year of business or five times the traffic carried by its horse trams. The LCC saw the electric trams {{as a way of}} driving social change, as its cheap, <b>fast</b> <b>service</b> could encourage workers {{to move out of the}} crowded inner city and live healthier lives in the suburbs. Although the City of London and the West End of London never gave permission for tram lines to be built, soon other London boroughs introduced their own electric services, including West Ham, Leyton, Dartford and Bexley.|$|E
25|$|Electrification {{was carried}} out in several smaller steps, with the first part from Oslo Ø to Ljan {{completed}} on 9 December 1936 and the last section from Sarpsborg to Halden, on 11 November 1940. NSB Class 66 was introduced as an express servie on the Østfold Line, running a round trip from Oslo to Halden each day, bringing travel time down to two hours. This lasted until 1956, when they were replaced with the slower NSB Class 65. The international trains were from 1948 served with the Swedish State Railways' SJ X5 units, able to run from Oslo to Copenhagen in less than ten hours. The <b>fast</b> <b>service</b> was named Skandiapilen. A landslide in 1953 washed away part of the track past Bekkelaget, resulting in the Bekkelaget Tunnel opening there five years later. The regional traffic received the new NSB Class 68 multiple units from the mid 1950s. A regular train with pyrite started running in 1966, hauling up to 600,000 tonnes per year from Hjerkinn on the Dovre Line to Borregaard. They remained until the 1990s.|$|E

2500|$|Dramatic {{changes were}} {{occurring}} in the service industries, as well. [...] Beginning in 1955 McDonald's provided {{one of the first}} innovations in service operations. [...] McDonald's is founded on the idea of the production-line approach to service. [...] This requires a standard and limited menu, an assembly-line type of production process in the back-room, high customer service in the front-room with cleanliness, courtesy and <b>fast</b> <b>service.</b> While modeled after manufacturing in the production of the food in the back-room, the service in the front-room was defined and oriented to the customer. It was the McDonald's operations system of both production and service that made the difference. McDonald's also pioneered the idea of franchising this operation system to rapidly spread the business around the country and later the world.|$|E
2500|$|By 1991 it {{had become}} clear that the {{deployment}} of the 11 locomotives {{of the first two}} series of class 112 in heavy and <b>fast</b> <b>service</b> had taken its toll. [...] Several gear wheel malfunctions during service caused heavy damage to motor and transmission of the affected units. [...] The maximum speed was reduced to [...] as an emergency measure, and the locomotives were only utilized as express trains in the Munich area. At the time they were already re-designated as class 113, in order to free up the designation of class 112 in the new German number scheme (for the more numerous and modern class 212 locomotives of the former East German Deutsche Reichsbahn of the GDR). [...] In the meantime these locomotives, after some units had been fitted with refurbished Henschel high-speed bogies in the mid-1990s, were able to again work at the speed of 160km/h, but were considered not to be much better than the normal class 110 units, and were soon listed for impending retirement.|$|E
2500|$|Pizza / Mcpizza – McDonald's {{has also}} {{attempted}} pizza at various times, with an apple-pie–like McPizza and more conventional McDonald's Pizza. A line of personal-sized pizzas was first {{seen in the}} late 1970s in test-market stores near interstate highways around Milwaukee and Madison. In Canada (c. 1992–99), the pizza originally began as a family-sized pizza that was brought out to the table by an employee and placed on a raised rack in {{the centre of the}} table. Later it was scaled down to a personal-sized pizza. However, variations have found their way into some international markets such as India (the pie-like [...] "Pizza McPuff"). McDonald's also test marketed a 14-inch, round, traditional-style pizza in Evansville, Indiana, and nearby Owensboro, Kentucky, in 1989. By 1991, the McDonald's test markets for pizza had grown to over 500 McDonald's locations before the pizza test was placed on hold. Pizza was discontinued in most restaurants by 2000. The reason for eliminating the pizza from the menu was that the time to cook a pizza took 11 minutes, and McDonald's wanted to keep its reputation for <b>fast</b> <b>service.</b> As of March 2017, two McDonald's locations, one in Pomeroy, Ohio, and the other in Spencer, West Virginia still offer the family style McPizza.|$|E

These trains provided a non-stop service to King's Cross Thameslink twice an hour. In 2009, several morning peak southbound <b>fast</b> <b>services</b> (stopping only at West Hampstead) and several evening peak northbound <b>fast</b> <b>services</b> (stopping only at West Hampstead) were reinstated.|$|R
2500|$|In 2001, the MTA {{suggested}} routing {{the proposed}} AirTrain JFK airport service over the line. The route {{was to begin}} at Penn Station, following {{the route of the}} original Rockaway Beach Branch, through Rego Park, Ozone Park, and ultimately branching off at the current Howard Beach–JFK Airport subway station ( [...] train) served by the IND Rockaway Line. The routing was met with approval from advocacy groups including the Rockaway-based Committee for Better Transit, Inc. and the Rockaway Transit Coalition. However, local and political opposition from Forest Hills, Kew Gardens, Richmond Hill and Glendale hurt the prospects of restored service, as residents along the line complained that noise levels would increase and neighborhoods would be aesthetically marred. An MTA study of the feasibility of reactivating the line found {{that it would not be}} convenient to 68% of commuters traveling between the outer boroughs and the Rockaways; in addition, people traveling from Far Rockaway would have to wait longer, on average, for a train. MTA also cited high operational and construction costs as detriments. It has been argued that restoration is needed to enable redevelopment of the Rockaways, [...] "a potentially very attractive area that has long suffered from slow transit service. Higher property values and influxes of people attracted by <b>fast</b> <b>service</b> to Midtown could revitalize en-route neighborhoods like Richmond Hill." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1968, at the {{suggestion}} of Hamilton City Council, an 88-seater was refurbished for a new <b>fast</b> <b>service</b> between Hamilton and Auckland aimed at business customers, and it started on Monday, 8 April 1968. [...] It was fitted with carpet and re-upholstered fabric-covered seats, and was painted in a new two-tone blue colour scheme that prompted the nickname Blue Streak. The seating was reduced to 84 to accommodate a servery area from which light meals and assorted alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks could be purchased. This was notable as {{the first time that a}} regularly scheduled passenger train service in New Zealand had reinstated on board catering since dining cars had been withdrawn across the network as a World War 1 economy measure. This initial service was unsuccessful, with patronage well below the levels needed to be profitable. The service might have been successful if run the other way round from Hamilton to Auckland in the morning but in 1968 the Wellington-Auckland Limited and Express were still timetabled to cater for the early morning commuter market from Hamilton and Huntly or in the other direction from Palmerston North and Levin and those leaving Auckland or Wellington in the evening for the Waikato or Manawatu or Horewhenua, while the NZR long term desire to maintain the New Plymouth- Auckland twinset service was much more because it brought people into Auckland in the morning, leaving Taurmaranu at 6.30 am and Hamilton at 9.30am and returned in the afternoon rather than for its night social and paper service through the King Country which Government cabinets saw as essential. Therefore, the Hamilton commuter market was served by many other services at lower second class fare cost in 1968 and the Blue Streak experiment was simply in the wrong direction at the wrong time.|$|E
