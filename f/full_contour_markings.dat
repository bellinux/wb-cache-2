40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Background: Traditionally, {{zirconia}} {{has been}} used as a core material for allceramic crowns that are later covered by a more esthetic veneering layer. Recently, new zirconia materials with higher translucency commonly referred to as the “full contour zirconia” have been introduced with the aim to allow dentist to fabricate entire allceramic crown from the material with acceptable esthetic and mechanical functions without the need for veneering. However, there is little information in the literature regarding the translucency of <b>full</b> <b>contour</b> zirconia and the degree of conversion of resin cement underneath the <b>full</b> <b>contour</b> zirconia. Objectives: 1) To investigate the translucency parameter (TP) of recently marketed <b>full</b> <b>contour</b> zirconia and compare that to traditional zirconia and lithium disilicate glass ceramic (LDGC) at different thicknesses. 2) To evaluate the degree of conversion (DC) of the resin cement through different thicknesses of the <b>full</b> <b>contour</b> zirconia, traditional zirconia and LDGC. Alternative hypothesis: The new generation zirconia at the clinically recommended thickness has lower translucency than that of LDGC and higher than that of non-veneered traditional zirconia. In addition, DC of resin cement under <b>full</b> <b>contour</b> zirconia is lower than that of LDGC and higher than that of traditional zirconia. Methods: 150 ceramic specimens (12 x 12 mm with thickness of 1 - 2 mm for LDGC and Zirconia) were divided into 6 groups according to the type of material, as follow: LDGC (IPS e-max CAD), Traditional Zirconia (CAP QZ), <b>full</b> <b>contour</b> zirconia (CAP FZ, Zirlux, Bruxzir, KDZ Bruxer). The TP for materials at various thicknesses were measured by a spectrophotometer (CM- 2600 D). The DC of the light curing resin cement (Variolink II) underneath the ceramic disks was measured by FTIR. Result: All <b>full</b> <b>contour</b> zirconia has lower translucency parameter and light transmission than LDGC. The translucency parameter decreases with increasing thickness of any type of ceramic. There were no significant differences in the degree of conversion of resin cement among the type of ceramic disc, except Bruxzir. The correlation of TP between various thicknesses and the types of ceramic materials was established by a regression analysis...|$|R
40|$|Rationale and Objectives. Manual {{annotation}} of the <b>full</b> <b>contour</b> of the vertebrae in lateral x-rays {{for subsequent}} morphometry is time-consuming. The standard six-point morphometry {{is commonly used}} instead. It {{has been shown that}} the information from the complete contour improves the quality of the study. In this article, the six landmarks are given and the vertebrae are segmented taking advantage of that information. The result is a semiautomatic system in which the <b>full</b> <b>contour</b> is found with high precision, and that only requires a radiologist to mark six points per vertebra. Materials and Methods. A shape model was built for both the six landmarks and the <b>full</b> <b>contours</b> of the vertebrae L 1, L 2, L 3, and L 4 of 142 patients. The distribution of the principal components of the <b>full</b> <b>contour</b> was then modeled as a Gaussian conditional distribution depending on the principal components of the six landmarks. The conditional mean was used as initialization for active shape model optimization, and the conditional variance was used to constrain the solution to plausible shapes. Results. The achieved point-to-line error was 0. 48 mm, and 95 % of the points were located within 1. 36 mm of the annotated contour. The accuracy is superior to those of previously published studies, at the expense of requiring the six points to be marked. Fractures and osteophytes are well approximated by the model, although they are sometimes oversmoothed. Conclusions. The proposed method provides hence a richer description than the six points, and can be used as input for shape-based morphometry to detect and quantify vertebral deformation more accurately...|$|R

This study aimed to assess the fatigue fracture strength of three-unit implant-supported <b>full</b> <b>contour</b> zirconia and pre-sintered cobalt-chromium (Co-Cr) alloy posterior fixed partial dentures (FPDs). Materials and Methods: In this in-vitro experimental study, 28 posterior three-unit implant-supported FPDs were fabricated of <b>full</b> <b>contour</b> zirconia and pre-sintered Co-Cr alloy, and were cemented on implant abutments. To simulate the oral environment, FPDs were subjected to 10, 000 thermal cycles between 5 - 55 °C for 30 seconds, and were then transferred to a chewing simulator (100, 000 cycles, 50 N, 0. 5 Hz). Afterwards, fatigue fracture strength was measured using a universal testing machine. Data were analyzed by Mann-Whitney U test. Results: The {{mean and standard deviation}} of fracture strength were 2108. 6 ± 440. 1 N in <b>full</b> <b>contour</b> zirconia, and 3499. 9 ± 1106. 5 N in pre-sintered Co-Cr alloy. According to Mann- Whitney U test, the difference in this respect was statistically significant between the two groups (P= 0. 007). Conclusions: Since the fracture strength values obtained in the two groups were significantly higher than the maximum mean masticatory load in the oral environment, both materials can be used for fabrication of posterior three-unit FPDs, depending on the esthetic demands of patients. </div...|$|R

40|$|Retrofit {{introduction}} of contour marking for lorries. The Netherlands has an annual number of approximately 300 fatal or serious injury crashes involving lorries (rigid lorries, articulated lorries and trailers). European Commission CARE data indicates that in 2010 around 5000 people died on EU roads in crashes involving Heavy Goods Vehicles (HGVs), and 75 % of these fatalities were occupants of other vehicles. Road traffic crashes involving lorries {{tend to be}} more serious than other crashes because of the great size and mass of these vehicles. Part of these crashes are due to lateral and rear-end collisions at dusk or in the dark. Previous SWOV research has shown that contour marking on lorries can contribute to the prevention of these types of crashes. EU directive 2007 / 35 /EC states that from 10 July 2008, lorries with a minimum weight of 7. 5 tonnes and trailers from a maximum mass of 3. 5 tonnes must be fitted with contour marking that is approved and applied in the correct manner in order to pass the type approval test. From 10 July 2011, retroreflecting contour marking must not only be applied to new vehicle types, but also to older vehicle types that are licensed for the first time (European Union, 2007 a, 2007 b). The contour marking is not compulsory for existing vehicles that are already licensed. 3 M wants to know which substantive arguments can be put forward to plead for {{introduction of}} contour marking for the existing vehicle park in the Netherlands and the European Union, the so-called retrofit, and asked SWOV to investigate the issue. The 3 M request resulted in the following research questions: - What road safety effects can be expected as a result of retrofit application of contour marking on lorries in the Netherlands? - What are the social costs and benefits of this measure and is the measure socially cost-effective? - What are the costs and benefits for transport companies? - What is the effect of retrofit contour marking on the number of fatalities and seriously injured in the EU due to traffic crashes? Dutch and international literature were studied and a cost-benefit analysis was conducted to answer these questions. Based on Dutch and international research, it is estimated that in the present situation in the Netherlands, retrofit contour marking leads to an estimated maximum prevention of 3 fatalities, 16 serious road injuries and 481 crashes per year. This data is only valid for a situation in which none of the vehicles in the Dutch vehicle fleet would be fitted with contour marking and contour marking would be applied to all vehicles at the same time. This is not the actual situation and lorries are replaced when their service life has ended. In addition, due to previous European legislation, contour marking will already be applied to part of the vehicle fleet on 1 January 2015 (commencement date for the measure in our calculations). Statistics Netherlands (CBS) data indicates that the average lifespan of rigid lorries and of articulated lorries is 13 years, and of trailers the average lifespan is 22 years. Gradual implementation of contour marking would imply that the entire fleet of trailers would continue to drive without retrofit for approximately 11 years, and the entire fleet of rigid lorries and articulated lorries for approximately 6, 5 years. This data could be used to calculate the effect of implementing retrofit contour marking for all vehicles at once, if not for the fact that some lorries have already been fitted with contour marking. The fact that adaptations have already taken place, affects both the relevant fleet size (the share without retrofit) and the average lifespan of that share. There are various ways to include fleet changes in the calculation of the effect. The present calculations show that both factors (fleet size and lifespan) influence safety proportionally. Therefore, their effect on safety is the same, irrespective of, for example, fleet size or lifespan being half the size. If the above is taken into account, the total savings over the period during which the measure is being introduced (i. e. from 1 January 2015 until contour marking has been applied to all lorries) amounts to: • 8 fatalities; • 42 serious road injuries; • 1268 crashes. Chapter 2 discusses the reasons for possible over- or underestimates of these numbers. The costs of the retrofit introduction of contour marking for trucks in the Netherlands consist of the costs of the marking itself and the costs of applying the marking. The costs of applying the marking have been calculated for two different scenarios: a ‘maximum’ scenario in which <b>full</b> side <b>contour</b> <b>markings</b> are applied to the sides of all trucks, and a ‘minimum’ scenario in which only the bottom and the upper corners are marked, in accordance with the minimum requirements of the European Union...|$|R
40|$|Abstract-A {{traditional}} {{approach to the}} problem of human object recognition is to assume that the visual system represents an object in terms of invariant quantities. This study considers a generalization of this approach {{to the problem of}} visually recognizing differences in shape, specifically between <b>contour</b> <b>markings</b> on a planar surface, as the position of the surface varies in space. For a given 'shape cue', perceived differences in contour may be quantified by threshold values-Weber fractions-at a particular criterion level of performance. A necessary theoretical condition for the Weber fraction to be constant with the relative viewpoint of the observer is that the cue should be a relative invariant under the natural spatial transformations of the image. Some data are reviewed showing how statistically efficient some cues are in explaining the observed discriminability of symmetric curved contours at a fixed criterion performance level of 75 %. A new, fuller analysis is presented showing that the efficiency of the most efficient cue satisfying the invariance condition is maintained over a wide range of criterion performance levels, from 53 % to 92 % correct, corresponding to discrimination index values of 0. 1 to 2. 0. Over these levels, Weber's law was found empirically to hold almost exactly. 1...|$|R

This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the color value of four kinds of highly transparent ceramics (Zenostar Zirconia, Lava Zirconia, Cercon Zirconia and Upcera Zirconia) after veneered on three different post core materials including noble metal alloy, Co-Cr alloy and composite resin. Highly transparent ceramics after veneered were made into specimens with 10 mm in diameter and 1. 0 mm in thickness. The color of core ceramics after veneered on different post core materials were measured with Color Analyzes. The results showed that their color value were significantly different from each other.

This {{can be done with}} submillimetric accuracy using nonlinear predictive mappings trained on hundreds or thousands of contours extracted from ultrasound images. Collecting and segmenting this amount of data from a speaker is difficult, so a more practical solution is to adapt a well-trained model from a reference speaker to a new speaker using a small amount of data from the latter. Previous work proposed an adaptation model with only 6 parameters and demonstrated fast, accurate results using data from one speaker only. However, the estimates of this model are biased, and we show that, when adapting to a different speaker, its performance stagnates quickly with the amount of adaptation data. We then propose an unbiased adaptation approach, based on local transformations at each contour point, that achieves a significantly lower reconstruction error with a moderate amount of adaptation data.

Human participants saw two micro-Gabor arrays in a random order, with the task to indicate whether the first (S 1) or the second stimulus (S 2) contained a contour of collinearly aligned elements.

In addition, it is claimed {{that it is possible}} to make a <b>full</b> <b>contour</b> high translucent zirconia crown close to natural tooth color by using coloring liquid. However, there is little information in the literature regarding the effect of coloring techniques and cement color on the optical properties of high translucent zirconia. Objective : 1) To evaluate the effect of the coloring liquid technique on the resulting optical properties of a monolithic high translucent zirconia 2) To evaluate the cumulative effect of the cement color on the resulting optical properties of a monolithic high translucent zirconia. Alternative hypothesis: There is a significant difference in optical properties between the high translucent monolithic zirconia ceramics with different color staining technique. In addition, the use of shaded resin cement has an effect on the final optical properties of high translucent monolithic zirconia ceramics. Materials and methods: 35 specimens of high translucent zirconia (11 mm x 11 mm) with thickness 1 mm was divided into 5 groups according coloring technique, as follows: no color, submerge, two layers of painting, four layers of painting, and six layers of painting. All specimens were measured for the Δ E, transparent parameter (TP), and opalescence parameter(OP) by spectrophotometer (CM- 2600 D) after firing. Forty-two specimens of high translucent zirconia (11 mm x 11 mm) with thickness 1 mm were divided into three groups according to cement color, as follows: clear, opaque, and A 2. After firing and cementing with ND 4 resin Block. The Δ E, TP and OP will be measured by spectrophotometer. Statistics: The data were analyzed with significant level set at 0. 05 one way ANOVA followed by pair-wise group comparisons using Fisher’s Protected Least Significant Differences. Result: 1) The shade of cement significantly affected the mean value of ΔE of E-max CAD and BruxZir high translucent zirconia restoration. Using opaque cement combined with E-max CAD resulted in color difference that was above the clinically perceptible level (ΔE> 3. 7). 2) With more layers of staining liquid application, the ΔE and value decreased. The six-layered group showed lowest mean delta ΔE value of 22 (0. 78). ΔE was significantly different among groups (p< 0. 0001). The submerged group showed higher ΔE than the all painting groups. Conclusions: Based on the results of the study, the colors of BruxZir high translucent zirconia and E-max CAD restorations were affected by the shade of cement, whereas white opaque resin cement resulted in BruxZir high translucent zirconia more yellowish. The results of the study demonstrated that the staining technique has an influence on value and final color of Lava-Plus high translucent.

These local effects are consistent with findings in previous studies on Vietnamese (Đỗ et al. 1998; Nguyễn and Boulakia 1999; Vũ et al. 2006; Brunelle et al., 2012) and Chinese – another tone language (Yuan et al., 2002; XiaoLi, Martin and Boulakia, 2004). Furthermore, the presence of a final rise in questions, which could be interpreted as a high boundary tone, is found in all speakers despite it occurs more frequently in some speakers and less in other speakers. Although {{there appears to be a}} great deal of variation in the use of local f 0 rises sentence-finally, this can be interpreted as an optional use of intonational high boundary tones, consistent with Brunelle et al. (2012)‘s results for Northern speakers.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a two-step, semi-automated method for reconstructing a three-dimensional (3 D) {{shape of the}} prostate from a 3 D transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) image. While the method has been developed for prostate ultrasound imaging, it can potentially be applicable to any other organ {{of the body and}} other imaging modalities. The proposed method takes as input a 3 D TRUS image and generates a watertight 3 D surface model of the prostate. In the first step, the system lets the user visualize and navigate through the input volumetric image by displaying cross sectional views oriented in arbitrary directions. The user then draws partial/full contours on selected cross sectional views. In the second step, the method automatically generates a watertight 3 D surface of the prostate by fitting a deformable spherical template to the set of user-specified contours. Since the method allows the user to select the best cross-sectional directions and draw only clearly recognizable partial or <b>full</b> <b>contours,</b> the user can avoid time-consuming and inaccurate guesswork on where prostate contours are located. By avoiding the usage of noisy, incomprehensible portions of the TRUS image, the proposed method yields more accurate prostate shapes than conventional methods that demand complete cross-sectional contours selected manually, or automatically using an image processing tool. Our experiments confirmed that a 3 D watertight surface of the prostate can be generated within five minutes even from a volumetric image {{with a high level of}} speckles and shadow noises...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{stereolithography}} for {{the manufacture}} of implantable prostheses is relatively new. 3 Stereolithography {{has been used in}} oral and maxillofacial surgery to create models for diagnosis, treatment planning and surgical simulation. 1, 2, 5, 6 This technique was first used in oral and maxillofacial surgery by Brix and Lambrecht in 1987. 1 Studying and manipulating pre-operative models prior to mandibular resection allows more sophisticated planning of the contour and better preparation of the metallic framework to be inserted. This frame-work rejoins the sections of the mandible, returning some function but providing no soft tissue support. Hence, the aesthetic results are not optimal. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the accuracy with which a stereolithographic model could be made to completely reunite both surfaces of the resected mandible and restore <b>full</b> <b>contour.</b> Materials and methods After consultation with maxillofacial surgeons at the Perth Dental Hospital, a large surgical defect was created on the right side of a dried human mandible beginning mesially from the angle of the mandible and extending approximately 5 cm along the body of the mandible. This area of the mandible was chosen as this is a common area of the mandible affected with tumours. 7, 8 An acrylic mounting rig was constructed to support the mandible at an angle similar to that found in clinical mandible scans, after advice from the radiography department at th...|$|R

The proposed system recognises each name {{by using an}} approach for whole word recognition. In the proposed system, the Gaussian Grid Feature (GGF), and Modified Direction Feature (MDF), together with a proposed hybrid feature extraction technique called Water Reservoir, Loop and Gaussian Grid Feature (WRLGGF) were investigated on <b>full</b> word <b>contour</b> images of each name sample. Artificial neural networks and support vector machines were used as classifiers. An encouraging recognition accuracy of 99. 25 % was achieved employing the proposed technique compared to 98. 59 % for GGF, and 96. 63 % using MDF.

The proposed method is valid under weak perspective projection, {{does not require}} to search for correspondences between frames, can handle scaling between consecutive images. thus can estimate the full Euclidean surface structure, and does not require camera calibration or camera motion measurement. Extensive experimental {{results show that the}} method is robust to the occlusion of feature points and image noise unlike previous affine-based approaches. Qualitative and quantitative results for the relation between the required minimum viewing angle change for the detection and the surface curvature are also presented...|$|R
60|$|And now, {{as the two}} stood {{frozen in}} terror, I saw the author of that fearsome sound {{creeping}} stealthily into view. It was a huge tiger--such as hunted the great Bos through the jungles primeval when the world was young. In <b>contour</b> and <b>markings</b> it was not unlike the noblest of the Bengals of our own world, but as its dimensions were exaggerated to colossal proportions so too were its colorings exaggerated. Its vivid yellows fairly screamed aloud; its whites were as eider down; its blacks glossy as the finest anthracite coal, and its coat long and shaggy as a mountain goat. That {{it is a beautiful}} animal there is no gainsaying, but if its size and colors are magnified here within Pellucidar, so is the ferocity of its disposition. It is not the occasional member of its species that is a man hunter--all are man hunters; but they do not confine their foraging to man alone, for there is no flesh or fish within Pellucidar that they will not eat with relish in the constant efforts which they make to furnish their huge carcasses with sufficient sustenance to maintain their mighty thews.|$|R

40|$|It is {{possible}} to recover the <b>full</b> midsagittal <b>contour</b> of the tongue with submillimetric accuracy from the location of just 3 – 4 landmarks on it. This involves fitting a predictive mapping from the landmarks to the contour using a training set consisting of contours extracted from ultrasound recordings. However, extracting sufficient contours is a slow and costly process. Here, we consider adapting a predictive mapping obtained for one condition (such as a given recording session, recording modality, speaker or speaking style) to a new condition, given only a few new contours and no correspondences. We propose an extremely fast method based on estimating a 2 D-wise linear alignment mapping, and show it recovers very accurate predictive models from about 10 new contours.
