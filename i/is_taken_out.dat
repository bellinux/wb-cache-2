5|$|The film {{opens with}} Rover, a collie {{playing with a}} child {{in front of a}} fireplace. Later that day, the baby <b>is</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> in a pram by her nurse. The nurse refuses to aid a beggar woman, and is then distracted upon meeting a soldier. While talking to the soldier, she pays no {{attention}} to the baby, and the beggar woman approaches from behind and snatches the sleeping child.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, the Autobot penal {{facility}} on Garrus-9 is {{attacked by the}} Combaticons, who escape with the Monstructor component Transformers, forcing a reluctant Fortress Maximus to dispatch Arcee to track them down. Learning of this, Prime pulls Prowl's detachment away from Earth to help contain the problem, though Hot Rod elects to stay to learn Sunstreaker's fate. Nightbeat also suspects someone has tampered with his memory. Elsewhere, Sixshot, having encountered and felt a kinship with the Reapers before, defects to their side, but <b>is</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> by a returned Starscream (revived by the other Decepticons {{to stand up to}} Megatron), leading to a full-scale battle between the Decepticons and Reapers. The Decepticons win, with aid from Galvatron, who escapes with Sixshot's body as the US military locates the Decepticons' base. Scorponok merges with the human Dante into a new body, but is unable to prevent Hunter, now merged with Sunstreaker's mind in a copy of his body, from escaping. In the Dead Universe Nemesis Prime, Jhiaxus, and Galvatron agree the endgame is about to begin.|$|E
5|$|Monique Jeffries is a {{tough and}} street-wise detective with the Special Victims Unit of the New York City Police Department. After briefly partnering with Ken Briscoe (Chris Orbach), she becomes the {{permanent}} partner of John Munch (Richard Belzer) after his previous partner, Brian Cassidy (Dean Winters), leaves the unit. The two occasionally clash personalities and have a sarcastic rapport with each other. While chasing a rape suspect during one case, Jeffries is nearly killed when the suspect gets into a car that explodes. She initially appears traumatized by the incident, but later feels exhilarated over having survived and starts behaving recklessly. She begins having several one-night stands and takes greater and greater risks at work, becoming something of a loose cannon at the Special Victims Unit. One night at a bar, she meets {{a man who had}} been a suspect in a previous rape case and has sex with him. When she reveals the incident during a session with a police therapist, she <b>is</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> of active duty per One Police Plaza and works a desk job. She objects to the transfer and threatens to sue the department. Instead, she is transferred to the Vice department, and her old job in the Special Victims Unit is taken by Fin Tutuola (Ice-T).|$|E

5|$|While in the {{car with}} Mace, Lenny plays the disc the contact gave him and watches Iris being brutally raped and murdered by an {{attacker}} at the Sunset Regent hotel. As they approach the hotel, Iris <b>is</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> on a stretcher. The next day, Lenny and Mace take the disc to Tick, who cannot identify the source of the recording, but recalls that Iris was looking for Lenny. Mace deduces that Iris may have left something in Lenny's car, and the two go to the impound and find Iris's disc. Steckler and Engleman appear and demand the disc at gunpoint, but Lenny and Mace escape in her car before being forced to stop at a dock. Steckler pours gasoline on the car and sets it on fire, but Mace drives it into the harbor, extinguishing the flames. When they reach the surface, the cops have left.|$|E
5|$|Burnout 3: Takedown is {{a racing}} video game with arcade-style {{gameplay}} that emphasises dangerous and fast-paced driving. The game features standard circuit races which {{take place on}} carriageways and city streets populated with traffic. The Single Race mode pits the player against five AI opponents in a single or multiple lap race. During a race, boost, which is earned by acts of reckless driving such as drifting around corners, near misses with traffic, and driving in oncoming lanes, {{can be used to}} rapidly increase a car's speed. Boost can be used immediately in Burnout 3, unlike previous Burnout games which required the boost meter to be full. The quickest method for earning boost is a Takedown—a central mechanic introduced in this instalment of the series. A Takedown involves shunting opposing vehicles until they crash. Each one fills the boost meter and can provide an additional boost segment, causing the meter to extend up to four times its initial size. Ramming opponents will cause them to behave more aggressively in return; their level of hostility is indicated by a coloured arrow above their vehicle. When the player crashes or <b>is</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> by an opponent, boost is lost and a bonus boost segment is withdrawn. During the crash sequence, a slow-motion mode called Impact Time can be activated. In Impact Time, the Aftertouch mechanic can be used to manoeuvre the wrecked car chassis into an opponent to get a Takedown, which acts as recovery move by negating the penalty of crashing.|$|E

25|$|Alveolar osteitis usually occurs {{where the}} blood clot fails to form or is lost from the socket (i.e., the defect {{left in the}} gum when a tooth <b>is</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out).</b> This leaves an empty socket where bone is exposed to the oral cavity, causing a {{localized}} alveolar osteitis limited to the lamina dura (i.e., the bone which lines the socket). This specific type of alveolar osteitis {{is also known as}} dry socket or, less commonly, fibrinolytic alveolitis, and is associated with increased pain and delayed healing time.|$|E
25|$|Small lung nodules {{identified}} on a thorax CT {{need to be}} examined for malignancy, thus a small portion of sample tissue <b>is</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> in a needle procedure. The needle is advanced through the bronchial tree, or trans-thoracically, towards the position of the nodule. To make sure tissue is captured from the nodule as opposed to accidentally taking healthy lung tissue, imaging modalities such as mobile C-Arms, ultrasound, or bronchoscopes are used. The yield rate of biopsies in small nodules is reported to be between 33–50% in tumors smaller than 3cm.|$|E
25|$|When , the truss {{is said to}} be statically determinate, {{because the}} (m+3) {{internal}} member forces and support reactions can then be completely determined by 2j equilibrium equations, once we know the external loads and the geometry of the truss. Given a certain number of joints, this is the minimum number of members, in the sense that if any member <b>is</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> (or fails), then the truss as a whole fails. While the relation (a) is necessary, it is not sufficient for stability, which also depends on the truss geometry, support conditions and the load carrying capacity of the members.|$|E

25|$|The SS plan to {{evacuate}} the camp. They order camp elder Krämer, {{who is also the}} communists' covert leader, to organize the prisoners for transport. Krämer manages to stall the preparations by pretending to cooperate. Resistance leader Bogorski, a Soviet prisoner-of-war, reveals that he hid the child on his own, where Kluttig would not find him. As the deadline for evacuation nears, the boy <b>is</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> from his hiding. Kluttig enters the room where the inmates are gathered, intending to shoot the child, but the prisoners form a wall around him and force Kluttig to leave. Krämer orders an armed uprising. The prisoners, led by Bogorski, drive out the remaining SS. Most of them survive and flee wearing civilian clothing. Höfel and Kropinski are freed from their cells. Krämer takes the boy out as the camp is liberated.|$|E
25|$|Christmas {{is celebrated}} for three days. On {{the second day}} of Christmas, neighbors visit each other. On the third day, Christmas straw <b>is</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> of the house. Little bundles are made with it, and hung on fruit trees to make their fruit better. A bigger bundle may be stored in a dry place: it will be burned on St. George's Day, as a {{protection}} of fields against hail. Another bundle is taken away across the nearest stream – a symbolic elimination of all the vermin that may be present in the house. Men make crosses from the remnant of the thicker side of badnjak, and stick them under eaves, on fields, meadows, vineyards, and apiaries. It is believed this will help that the ensuing year be happy and fruitful. A good sign that this will be the case is when {{there is a lot of}} snow on Christmas Day.|$|E
25|$|Aquifers {{may occur}} at various depths. Those {{closer to the}} surface are not only {{more likely to be}} used for water supply and irrigation, but {{are also more likely to}} be topped up by the local rainfall. Many desert areas have {{limestone}} hills or mountains within them or close to them that can be exploited as groundwater resources. Part of the Atlas Mountains in North Africa, the Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon ranges between Syria and Lebanon, the Jebel Akhdar in Oman, parts of the Sierra Nevada and neighboring ranges in the United States' Southwest, have shallow aquifers that are exploited for their water. Overexploitation can lead to the exceeding of the practical sustained yield; i.e., more water <b>is</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> than can be replenished. Along the coastlines of certain countries, such as Libya and Israel, increased water usage associated with population growth has caused a lowering of the water table and the subsequent contamination of the groundwater with saltwater from the sea.|$|E
