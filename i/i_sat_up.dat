500|$|Then, I {{looked over}} and saw this man on the extreme right aisle sort of {{galloping}} to the podium. He was tall, he was thin, {{and the way he}} was galloping it looked as though he was going someplace much more important than the podium. ... He got to the podium—and <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> straight. I was impressed with him.|$|E
2500|$|... "The {{first night}} I saw dailies," [...] replied art {{director}} Wallace, [...] "projected on a bedsheet in the producer's ratty apartment… My jaw dropped and <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> so straight I {{cast a shadow}} with my head. This looked like a zillion dollars. This looked like a real movie." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1980 Cavett {{experienced}} what he {{characterized as}} his [...] "biggest depressive episode". While {{on board a}} Concorde before take off, Cavett broke out into a sweat and became agitated. After he {{was removed from the}} plane, Cavett was taken to Columbia Presbyterian Hospital in New York City, where he later underwent electroconvulsive therapy. Regarding this method of treatment, Cavett is quoted as saying, [...] "In my case, ECT was miraculous. My wife was dubious, but when she came into my room afterward, <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> and said, 'Look who's back among the living.' It was like a magic wand." ...|$|E
60|$|Then, not {{as it were}} gradually, {{but quite}} suddenly, <b>I</b> woke <b>up,</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up,</b> and looked about me.|$|R
60|$|The {{incident}} that Jephson's remark had reminded me of, {{she told me}} one afternoon, as <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> propped <b>up</b> by the fire, trying to drink a glass of port wine, and feeling somewhat depressed at discovering I did not like it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Forgive me for intruding on you," [...] she said, [...] "and {{please do}} not stop smoking, for I like the smell. <b>I</b> have <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> {{expressly}} to hear Jeekie's story of the Yellow God. Alan, produce Jeekie, or I shall {{go to bed at}} once." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> even straighter than my companion, {{and gazed}} steadfastly at him.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up,</b> {{black with}} rage. My stranger's face glimmered obscurely in the gloom.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> noiseless, tense, and alert. And then, very quietly, {{somebody}} {{entered the}} room.|$|E
6000|$|... "Stood our old Sammy {{off to the}} northward, {{to get out of}} {{the blazing}} hot weather there on the Line. But it was no use--I did all <b>I</b> could; <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> with him nights; was very severe with him in the matter of diet-" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He wouldn't {{go to bed}} at all. <b>I</b> {{guess he}} <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> all night in the public parlor. He wasn't in bed at twelve o'clock: I know that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't think I {{was much}} good on that vyage, for <b>I</b> went and <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> in the bow, {{with my back}} to the others, and my eyes fixed far ahead.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up,</b> and at {{the rustle}} of my motion {{he looked at me}} quickly.|$|E
60|$|She {{stopped at}} my gesture. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up,</b> and the canoe rocked with my movement.|$|E
60|$|Instantly <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up,</b> {{conscious}} of my circumstance and surroundings, and at my movement this visitor spoke.|$|E
60|$|I went to Sadler {{and found}} him, to my surprise, in bed. As <b>I</b> entered he <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> and turned a face toward me which sickened me as I looked at it.|$|R
6000|$|... 'They don't tell you,' {{he said to}} Merry in his quavering voice, as he {{sat down}} again, and patted her upon the head. 'They don't tell me either; but I'll watch, I'll watch. They shall not hurt you; don't be frightened. When you have <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> {{watching}}, <b>I</b> have <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> watching too. Aye, aye, I have!' he piped out, clenching his weak, shrivelled hand. 'Many a night I have been ready!' ...|$|R
6000|$|Doctor Franck came in as <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> sewing <b>up</b> the rents {{in an old}} shirt, that Tom {{might go}} tidily to his grave. New shirts were needed for the living, {{and there was no}} wife or mother to [...] "dress him {{handsome}} when he went to meet the Lord," [...] as one woman said, describing the fine funeral she had pinched herself to give her son.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> in bed {{tingling}} {{with excitement}} at the developments which already I saw arising from his last night's imprudence.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> {{and stared}} at Aunt Philippa. I was so amazed that it is useless to try to express my amazement.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> {{in the bed}} and saw {{a figure}} {{advancing}} towards me. It was Oros, who bore a lamp in his hand.|$|E
6000|$|The night--(I sing by night--sometimes an owl, [...] And now {{and then}} a nightingale)--is dim, [...] And the loud shriek of sage Minerva's fowl [...] Rattles around me her {{discordant}} hymn: [...] Old portraits from old walls upon me scowl-- [...] I wish to Heaven they would not look so grim; [...] The dying embers dwindle in the grate-- [...] I think too that <b>I</b> have <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> too late: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But didn't {{you think}} I {{was exactly what}} I ought not to have been? Didn't you imagine, now, that <b>I</b> habitually <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> all night, gambling, and {{drinking}} buckets of champagne and brandy-and-water? And that I lay in bed all day, devising iniquity in my dreams? Come now, tell the truth, and shame the devil; if I am the devil, I know people have made me out to be." ...|$|R
6000|$|I say, the Sun {{is a most}} glorious sight, [...] I've {{seen him}} rise full oft, indeed of late [...] <b>I</b> have <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> on purpose all the night,[bn][153] [...] Which hastens, as {{physicians}} say, one's fate; [...] And so all ye, who {{would be in the}} right [...] In health and purse, begin your day to date [...] From daybreak, and when coffined at fourscore, [...] Engrave upon the plate, you rose at four.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> staring round me wildly, {{and a voice}} spoke {{above me}} in Castilian, not to me indeed but to some comrade.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up.</b> The {{lights were}} on, and I {{was on the}} floor, with old Bill {{kneeling}} beside me with a soda siphon.|$|E
60|$|I fancied for the moment, as {{most people}} would under similar circumstances, that I must be dreaming. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up,</b> and rubbed my eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Monseigneur," [...] he ended, [...] "knowing what danger awaited {{you along}} the road, <b>I</b> have <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> all night, praying God and His saints {{that you might}} come this far, and that thus I might warn you. Had I been less bruised and sore, I had got myself a horse and ridden out to meet you; as it was, I could but {{hope and pray that}} you would reach Blagnac, and that--" ...|$|R

60|$|In {{the salon}} I found the Chevalier de Canaples with Mesdemoiselles and Andrea {{awaiting}} me, and the kindness wherewith they overwhelmed me, as <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> propped <b>up</b> with pillows, {{was such that}} I asked myself again and again if, indeed, I was that same Gaston de Luynes who but {{a little while ago}} had held himself as destitute of friends as he was of fortune. I was the pampered hero of the hour, and even little Geneviève had a sunny smile and a kind word for me.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> with a start--still in my {{berth in}} the Pullman car--with {{the voice of the}} porter calling through the {{curtains}} [...] "Toronto! Toronto!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He will, if {{telegraphing}} {{can bring}} him. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> {{half the night}} with the operator. She was very obliging when she understood the case." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up,</b> {{opened my}} eyes, {{and carried the}} tankard to my lips with both my hands. And as I drank I looked at Pons.|$|E
6000|$|... 'My dear Winifred, as if <b>I</b> had not <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> till twelve {{last night}} laying them before Albinia. How sick the poor child must be of our arguments, {{when there is}} no real objection, and she is so much attached! Have you heard {{anything}} about these connexions of his? Did you not write to Mrs. Nugent? I wish she were at home.' ...|$|R
60|$|I {{hardly know}} whether I had slept or not after this musing; at any rate, I started wide awake on hearing a vague murmur, {{peculiar}} and lugubrious, which sounded, I thought, just above me. I wished I had kept my candle burning: {{the night was}} drearily dark; my spirits were depressed. <b>I</b> rose and <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> in bed, listening. The sound was hushed.|$|R
5000|$|Under the {{guidance}} of the Vineyard Fellowship, Dylan was asked to attend a course held at the Vineyard School of Discipleship, which would run four days a week over the course of three months. [...] "At first I said, 'There's no way I can devote three months to this,'" [...] Dylan would say in a 1980 interview. [...] "'I've got to be back on the road soon.' But I was sleeping one day and <b>I</b> just <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> in bed at seven in the morning and I was compelled to get dressed and drive over to the Bible school." ...|$|R
