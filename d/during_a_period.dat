5|$|Attacks may {{be brought}} on by {{physical}} exertion, drinking alcohol, or eating food high in carbohydrates or salt. This may explain why attacks are more common in summer, when more people drink sugary drinks and engage in exercise. Exercise-related attacks tend to occur <b>during</b> <b>a</b> <b>period</b> of rest immediately after exercise; exercise may therefore be recommended to abort an attack.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} roles of a bank in a conglomerate, roles which are best {{investigated}} <b>during</b> <b>a</b> bad <b>period.</b> We examine two hypotheses using Taiwan’s unique bank loan transaction data. Firstly, our extended liquidity constrained hypothesis which argues that <b>during</b> <b>a</b> bad <b>period,</b> investments of firms in a non-bank group are more severely constrained than they are <b>during</b> <b>a</b> normal <b>period</b> cannot be rejected. The same argument, however, does not hold true for firms in a bank group. Secondly, our extended liquidity insurance hypothesis which argues that <b>during</b> <b>a</b> bad <b>period,</b> firms can obtain funds only {{when they are in}} a bank group with a financially related core business is also accepted. When they are in a bank group with a core business unrelated to finance, the hypothesis is not expected to hold...|$|R

5|$|Bednar {{was hired}} by the Canadian National Exhibition in 1998, <b>during</b> <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>during</b> <b>a</b> <b>period</b> where both the CNEA and Exhibition Place grounds had low {{profitability}} or were losing money. The CNEA made just $70,000 in 1997. He said he was being paid less than his predecessor, Bryan Tisdall, who was one of five departing executives that the CNEA and Exhibition Place grounds made large severance payments to. When Bednar joined, the 1998 fair was already planned, and he would not comment on its future direction. The following year, CNE started promoting its events on weekends, which there was previously a policy against. The change in policy allowed corporate partners to offer discounted or free ticket promotions. This led to a 7 percent increase in admissions, but a large reduction in revenues. According to a city councillor on the CNEA board, the crowding and traffic of the event discouraged potential customers from continuing to visit the event in the final week.|$|E

5|$|The {{attitude}} toward the Chinese language was contradictory. In Teishi's court, Chinese had been flaunted and considered a symbol of imperial rule and superiority. Yet, in Shōshi's salon {{there was a great}} deal of hostility towards the language—perhaps owing to political expedience <b>during</b> <b>a</b> <b>period</b> when Chinese began to be rejected in favor of Japanese—even though Shōshi herself was a student of the language. The hostility may have affected Murasaki and her opinion of the court, and forced her to hide her knowledge of Chinese. Unlike Shōnagon, who was both ostentatious and flirtatious, as well as outspoken about her knowledge of Chinese, Murasaki seems to have been humble, an attitude which possibly impressed Michinaga. Although Murasaki used Chinese and incorporated it in her writing, she publicly rejected the language, a commendable attitude <b>during</b> <b>a</b> <b>period</b> of burgeoning Japanese culture.|$|E
