5|$|In 1993 Reyne {{appeared}} as Tina Turner's manager Roger Davies in What's Love Got to <b>do</b> <b>With</b> <b>It?.</b> He featured in twelve episodes of State Coroner during 1998 and in 2003's The Postcard Bandit. Reyne {{lives on the}} Mornington Peninsula with his partner, Tina, and a daughter. He has released his eighth solo studio album, Every Man a King (2007) and still performs occasionally.|$|E
5|$|Despite this, while {{commanding}} Army Group Centre, {{he refused}} to dispatch troops {{to put down the}} Warsaw uprising (a task that ultimately was carried out by the SS), viewing it as a rear-area matter. He stated that the revolt arose from the mistreatment of the Polish population by the Nazis, and the army should have nothing to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> On the other hand, he showed no hesitation in clearing the Warsaw suburbs of Praga and Saska Kępa, through which vital supply lines ran.|$|E
5|$|Soule was {{promptly}} given the task by Square to score Secret of Evermore. The finished game features an untraditional score incorporating ambient background sounds (like wind blowing and ocean waves) {{into the music}} and utilizing a more mellow orchestral sound. Part {{of the reason for}} this was that the sound program used in Evermore was not up to the technical challenge of what Soule wanted to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>it,</b> forcing him to work creatively within his limitations. When Ron Gilbert of LucasArts left to form his own company, Humongous Entertainment, and Square moved from Seattle to Los Angeles, Soule quit Square to score Gilbert's children's adventure game series, Putt-Putt; he was the company's third employee. Soule composed the soundtracks to 11 children's games over the next three years, with multiple titles in the Putt-Putt, Pajama Sam, Freddi Fish and Spy Fox series.|$|E

5|$|The Treaty of Paris was {{frequently}} amended as the EC and EU evolved and expanded. With the treaty due to expire in 2002, debate {{began at the}} beginning of the 1990s on what to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> It was eventually decided that it should be left to expire. The areas covered by the ECSC's treaty were transferred to the Treaty of Rome and the financial loose ends and the ECSC research fund were dealt with via a protocol of the Treaty of Nice. The treaty finally expired on 23 July 2002. That day, the ECSC flag was lowered for the final time outside the European Commission in Brussels and replaced with the EU flag.|$|E
5|$|The {{station is}} located on Roosevelt Island, which was once home to a penitentiary and some asylums. Then known as Welfare Island, the island became neglected. During the 1960s, some groups started proposing uses for the island. More {{suggestions}} for what to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> were made once the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) {{announced that it would}} build a subway station on the island. The station was intended as a way to encourage transit-oriented development on the island. When construction of the line was delayed, the Roosevelt Island Tram was built in 1973. The Roosevelt Island Operating Corporation was formed in 1984 to develop the island, but was not successful until October 1989 when the subway station opened {{along with the rest of}} the 63rd Street Line. The opening encouraged the development of the island, which has made the station busier.|$|E
5|$|As Jerry is {{sleeping}} on the plane he dreams of returning to his apartment only to find several FBI agents there interrogating Kramer, who apparently has ratted out Jerry. When Jerry protests that {{he had nothing to}} <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>it,</b> they reveal that the Russian was an undercover FBI agent. Jerry tries to flee only to be gunned down by the agents. This jolts him awake. He finds his show is canceled due to bad weather, and George picks up Jerry at the airport. Jerry is initially amazed that George is perfectly willing, even anxious to drive Jerry home. When he informs George they cannot go back to his apartment because of the baby shower, George insists and Jerry discovers that George is wearing the red shirt and is just using the favor as a chance to encounter Leslie at the baby shower. Meanwhile, Kramer and the two Russians crash the shower to install cable television, start to eat all the food and get into a heated argument. When George and Jerry arrive, George's plan proves unsuccessful, as he cannot muster the courage confront Leslie and instead awkwardly tries to curry her favor. He is interrupted when one of the other party guests (Margaret Reed as Mary) suddenly confronts Jerry because he never called her back after a date. This unpleasant scene is the final straw and the guests leave hurriedly. On {{the way out of the}} bathroom the angry woman bumps Leslie and her dessert into George, adding a chocolate cake stain to the Bosco stain already on the shirt. Jerry changes his mind about the cable hook-up, but is still charged with a large amount of money. When he refuses to pay, the Russians break the picture tube of his television set.|$|E

25|$|Although a {{third season}} was considered, series creator J. Michael Straczynski {{made it clear}} that if the show ran a further season he would have nothing to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> The show {{concluded}} {{with the end of the}} second season resolving most plot threads.|$|E

25|$|Annie Proulx {{wrote an}} essay expressing her extreme {{disappointment}} {{in the film}} not winning the Best Picture Award.

25|$|In October 1834 a great fire {{destroyed}} {{much of the}} Palace of Westminster, which Adelaide considered divine retribution for {{the vagaries}} of reform. When the Whig ministry of Lord Melbourne was dismissed by the King, The Times newspaper blamed the Queen's influence, though {{she seems to have}} had very little to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> Influenced by her similarly reactionary brother-in-law, the Duke of Cumberland, she did write to the King against reform of the Church of Ireland.|$|E

25|$|In January 2011, Sony Computer Entertainment sued George Hotz over {{violating the}} Section 1201 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act {{as well as}} the Federal Fraud and Abuse Act due to facilitating {{consumers}} to jailbreak their PlayStation 3 consoles. Hotz argued that because he had purchased the product, he had the right to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> as he pleased. After three months, Sony and Hotz decided to settle out of court. This also included an injunction against George Hotz, barring him from hacking any more Sony products.|$|E
25|$|The 1954 movie Salt of the Earth, {{directed}} by Herbert J. Biberman, {{a member of}} the blacklisted Hollywood Ten, portrays a year-and-a-half long strike by New Mexico zinc miners who belonged to Mine Mill; many of the actors were rank-and-file members of that union. The producers found it difficult, however, to recruit Anglo actors to play strikebreakers or deputy sheriffs; those who disliked the union wanted nothing to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>it,</b> while those who sympathized {{did not want to be}} seen switching sides, even as actors.|$|E
25|$|I don't {{know what}} Color Field {{painting}} means. I {{think it was}} probably invented by some critic, which is okay, but I don't think the phrase means anything. Color Field painting?

25|$|Black Widow tracked a knife {{covered in}} Wolverine's {{blood in the}} {{possession}} of A.I.M. to a research facility in Moscow. Captain America and Deadpool went to retrieve it in order to prevent A.I.M. from misusing Wolverine's DNA. Deadpool was given the blood-covered knife by Captain America to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> as he wanted. Deadpool had recently acquired an incubator that could create new bodies using a DNA sample. Deadpool deferred the decision to bring Wolverine back to life until he had more time to think on whether it would have been what Wolverine wanted.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, under Ashcroft, {{curtains}} {{were installed}} blocking the Spirit of Justice statue in the Robert F. Kennedy Department of Justice Building, {{which is of}} a woman wearing a toga-like dress with one breast revealed, from view during speeches. The curtains were first used on a rental basis during the administration of Dick Thornburgh. Justice officials long insisted that the curtains were put up to improve the room's use as a television backdrop and that Ashcroft had nothing to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> Ashcroft's successor, Alberto Gonzales, removed the curtains in June 2005.|$|E
25|$|Hughes vehemently opposed Japan's racial {{equality}} proposition.
