50|$|Valve {{oscilloscopes}} {{share this}} very high input impedance {{and thus can}} be used to measure voltages even in very high impedance circuits. There may typically be 3 or 4 stages of amplification per display channel. In later oscilloscopes, a type of amplifier using a series of tubes connected at equal distances along transmission lines, known as a <b>distributed</b> <b>amplifier</b> was employed to amplify very high frequency vertical signals before application to the display tube. Valve oscilloscopes are now obsolete.|$|E
50|$|For a <b>distributed</b> <b>amplifier</b> {{the input}} is fed in series into the {{amplifiers}} and parallel out of them. To avoid {{losses in the}} input, no input signal is allowed to leak through. This is avoided by using a balanced input and output also known as push-pull amplifier. Then all signals which leak through the parasitic capacitances cancel. The output is combined in a delay line with decreasing impedance. For narrow band operation other methods of phase-matching are possible, which avoid feeding the signal through multiple coils and capacitors. This may be useful for power-amplifiers.|$|E

50|$|Because of the Miller {{effect a}} common source {{transistor}} {{acts as a}} capacitor (non inverting) at high frequencies and has an inverting transconductance at low frequencies. The channel of the transistor has three dimensions. One dimension, the width, is chosen depending on the current needed. The trouble is for a single transistor parasitic capacitance and gain both scale linearly with the width. For the <b>distributed</b> <b>amplifier</b> the capacitance - that is the width - of the single transistor is chosen based on the highest frequency and the width needed for the current is split across all transistors.|$|E
5000|$|The {{design of}} the {{distributed}} amplifiers was first formulated by William S. Percival in 1936. [...] In that year Percival proposed a design by which the transconductances of individual vacuum tubes could be added linearly without lumping their element capacitances at the input and output, thus arriving at a circuit that achieved a gain-bandwidth product {{greater than that of}} an individual tube. Percival's design did not gain widespread awareness however, until a publication on the subject was authored by Ginzton, Hewlett, Jasberg, and Noe in 1948. It is to this later paper that the term <b>distributed</b> <b>amplifier</b> can actually be traced. Traditionally, DA design architectures were realized using vacuum tube technology.|$|E

5000|$|Simons {{began at}} Jerrold Electronics Corporation as a {{part-time}} consulting engineer in 1951. His first project was to design a high-to-low frequency converter. He and other Jerrold engineers worked out of Simons' personal laboratory located {{on the second floor}} of a stained glass factory in Bryn Athyn, Pa., until a new Jerrold lab was built in Hatboro, Pa., in 1955. Simons characterized his role at Jerrold in his resume: [...] "Three of us were primarily responsible for equipment design in the early years. Donald Kirk was talented in coming up with new ideas, my contribution was often in getting a system to work, and Henry Arbeiter took all the bright ideas and made them producible." [...] Other engineering colleagues included Eric Winston, Mike Jeffers, Frank Ragone, Caywood Cooley, Vic Nicholson, Len Ecker, and Bill Felsher. [...] Simons successively became chief engineer, chief test equipment engineer, vice president and director of advanced development. Some of his noteworthy designs include the Model 704B Field Strength Meter. In a technology area based on rapid and constant change, the 704B was of note in being in production and use for more than 20 years [...] The 704 name is honored even today in a fraternal organization of its users The Loyal Order of the 704, commemorating the meter’s defining role in cable development.
