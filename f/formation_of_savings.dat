40|$|The {{objective}} of the paper is twofold. First, the possible links between the feared decrease of the <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> <b>savings</b> and the strong territorial imbalances that characterised the demographic evolution are examined. Second, the authors aim to demonstrate that {{it makes sense to}} address the problem of lack of savings in the global economy above all if it is seen in relative terms, comparing it with the specific investment needs that must be met in order to mitigate economic and demographic imbalances. Attention is focused on a specific and particularly significant aspect of the problem: that of the relationship between family savings and optimal accumulation of human capital at different stages of economic development and population growth. The authors conclude that more than a problem of absolute world savings scarcity, there is a predominant redistributive problem, in the face of a marked economic and demographic dualism that takes on a worrisome destabilising potential.   JEL Codes: E 21, J 24, O 16  </p...|$|E

Subjects of almost homogenous ethnic groups [...] low income, low education, currently unemployed [...] were subjected to experiments based on an in-depth questionnaire (Romany N = 35, N = 25 non-Romany). In addition to time preferences, {{their relationship with the}} socio-economic and demographic characteristics was inspected. The sub-tests showed a difference across ethnic groups in regard to the discounting models. Romany ethnic group is better characterized by an inconsistent model compared to the non-Romany using an more consistent model.

40|$|This {{project of}} income {{improvement}} at household level {{is a result}} of the need assessment conducted in Masama-Rundugai ward in early 2006. Assessment indicated that low income is a root cause of the core problem of poverty. Lack of employment, lack of skills to run micro business, ignorance and poor leadership commitment are other causes contributing to the problem. Goal and objectives were set through involving stakeholders. Implementation was conducted following the assessment which indicated what strategies to undertake to achieve the intended goals. Through survey researcher identified two appropriate strategies: The first was the <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Savings</b> and Credit Cooperative Society (SACCOS). It was necessary for community members to form their own SACCOS close to their destinations to ease access of soft loans. This was the reason of this project in this area. The second was capacity building for community members on entrepreneurship. During project implementation entrepreneurship manual for training at community level was developed and used to train community members who have been sensitized to borrow soft loans and apply in their micro business. SACCOS steering committee developed constitution, and was one of registration requirements. District Cooperative officers were consulted for registration process. Community members were mobilized to join the SACCOS. The response was that 57 women and 46 men joined the SACCOS (MKALONGO SACCOS) in the first place. Some organization promised to provide soft loan in 2006 / 2007 budget through the MKALONGO SACCOS. (Author abstract) Mweta, G. A. (2007).

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to examine the motives that drive the propensity of households to save and households' portfolio allocation decisions. This interest has been spurred by the issue <b>of</b> low personal <b>saving</b> rates that has been observed across the globe over the past two decades. In addition, the perplexities concerning portfolio allocation choices despite rapid innovations of financial products warrants the need for further investigation on household's asset allocation decisions. Motivated by the above phenomena, this study was conducted with three main objectives. First, the study sought to identify the factors that are instrumental to the <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> household's <b>saving</b> motives, by examining households' socio-demographic and behavioural factors that influence their motivations to save. Second, the study aimed to determine the factors that influence the household's propensity to save. Third, the study targeted to evaluate the factors that impact the choice of assets that households save in, by examining their preferences in regards to low-risk assets, risky assets, and life insurance. The 2004 U. S. Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF), which a government sponsored triennial cross-section survey on the financial situation of American families, was chosen as an empirical basis to address the three research objectives mentioned above. Various econometric tools were used to analyze the relationships under investigation. Results indicate that all categories <b>of</b> <b>saving</b> motives, namely the life-cycle, precautionary, bequest and profit motives are significant determinants of the propensity to save. This suggests that planned saving are relevant in the household's saving decisions. Nonetheless, results also show that unplanned saving, stemming from the household's capabilities and opportunities to save, is a stronger determinant <b>of</b> household <b>saving.</b> Saving motivations are also found to be related to portfolio allocation choice. In particular, life-cycle and profit motives significantly impinged on the decision to own risky assets, while life-cycle and bequest motives strongly influenced the probability of owning life insurance. Meanwhile, results indicate that age and income are salient factors influencing the household's <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> <b>saving</b> motives, their propensity to save, and portfolio allocation choices.

40|$|Even though overall {{growth in}} India has {{recently}} accelerated, it has largely bypassed {{rural areas and}} agriculture; {{in fact it is}} agreed that the ratio of rural to urban poverty has increased. As a consequence, some of the marginalized groups in a society that is already characterized by a high level of inequality in opportunities and segregation along lines of, gender, caste, and social status, are widely reckoned to not have benefited from overall growth. To enable women and backwards castes to expand their livelihood opportunities, a vast range of government programs have been initiated and large amounts of resources are being channeled to poor areas. An increasingly popular approach to do so relies on the concept of Community Driven Development (CDD) whereby resources are made available to encourage <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> <b>savings</b> groups at the local level and, once they have attained a certain degree of maturity, the channeling to such groups of funds (either as a credit or a grant) which they can use for small projects aimed to improve their livelihood. This paper uses one of the earliest projects of this type, the Andhra Pradesh (AP) District Initiatives Project, a US $ 250 Mn intervention that was started in 2000, to provide an initial assessment of {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the CDD approach. One of the interesting characteristics of the CDD approach is its desire to combine interventions to increase food security and deal with immediate needs with social mobilization to overcome long-standing patterns of discrimination and prejudices and attention to longer-term economic needs. Two interesting aspects of the AP program that greatly facilitate assessment of impact is the fact that only women's groups were eligible and that even in cases where it built on pre-existing group structures, the project aimed to establish second-tier organizations at the village and mandal (county) level which, by pooling the resources of individual groups aimed to significantly expand their ability to respond to shocks. It is therefore possible to compare between women and men in the project area, as well as between pre-existing groups in areas affected by the project and in areas that were not eligible, to assess project impacts. To do so, we rely on a comprehensive set of surveys that included 2, 700 households (with separate questionnaires being administered to men and women in the household), 2, 200 self help groups, and 200 village organizations in both project and control areas conducted in mid- 2004. In addition to the standard issues, the questionnaire elicited retrospective information on most issues so as to be able to compare differences in differences between project and control areas. It also contained an elaborate section on social empowerment, participation in groups, and actual as well as hypothetical borrowing capacity. The issues to be addressed are, first, to what extent the project succeeded in improving the governance structure of the community organizations involved;, second to what extent women have been empowered to overcome social barriers that have traditionally stymied their economic advancement, and finally to what extent the project has led to an increase in levels of income and productivity. We use simple t-tests of differences in differences to assess whether areas or groups (women) targeted by the project have advanced significantly more than others. For such differences to translate into significant improvements for the poor, it is necessary that the program is able to target poorer segments in the overall population or those who are organized in self-help groups. Participation regressions indeed confirm that, by focusing on the poorest areas and by aiming to include poorer parts of the population, the project has been able to significantly expand the range of households organized in self-help groups and to target support for institutional strengthening towards the most needy. Comparison between pre-existing groups in intervention and control areas points towards significantly different rates of improvements in terms of group management and internal controls (e. g. members being fined for non-attendance, internal bookkeeping being of high quality). These, together with the federated structure, appear to have allowed groups in intervention areas to significantly expand the availability of credit to members and to access loans by other financial institutions. Second-tier institutions in self help group federations were able to take on completely new activities (e. g. taking over distribution of subsidized food grains from "fair price shops" which were had often remained out of the reach of the poor) that significantly improved participants' ability to smooth consumption. This is supported by evidence from the household level suggesting that, even though the incidence of shocks was higher for households in treatment areas than outside, households were able to deal with such shocks more easily than they had been able to in the past. The hypothesis that the improvement in access to credit can be attributed to the project is supported by the finding that the unambiguous and significant increase in the amount which women in areas eligible for the project as compared to those that were not, were able to borrow both from the formal and the informal sector is not matched by a commensurate increase in credit availability for men. To the contrary, credit access for men was higher in areas not eligible for the project (marginally significant) as compared to areas that were eligible. The logic of the project to use improved access to resources to empower women and overcome social barriers is corroborated by the fact that the change in the share of women who receive high respect in their family and who were not subject to domestic violence was indeed significantly lower in control than in intervention areas where women also have significantly higher participation in family matters relating to income generating activities, debt and savings, as well as family planning and the number of children. In fact, the improvements in women's participation seem to transcend the realm of the family and extent to the community level: the change in the share of women who always know of or participate in village assemblies, who are aware of other types of community institutions, and who are able to freely interact with government officials and villagers of other caste or religion is significantly higher in intervention than in control villages. While all of this suggests that the project has not only improved access to credit and risk diversification but also significantly increased women's empowerment, these significant effects were, however, not matched by increased beneficiary savings, possibly because the resources generated by productive activities initiated under the project are yet to mature. To explore this, a closer look at the extent to which the project has increased access of the poor to resources and/or enabled them to use these resources more effectively. Even though productivity of resource use is similar between areas eligible and non-eligible for the project, there is clear evidence that the project has helped to significantly expand the share of households who own productive assets. The key challenge to ensure sustainability and replicability of the intervention is thus to match the rather impressive performance in terms of social empowerment with an equally significant transfer of technical skills that would, by facilitating more productive use of such assets, put participants economic basis on a stronger footing. The ability to use the federated structure to provide effective technical assistance and to liaise with line ministries to ensure that services are available to the poor, the feasibility of which has been demonstrated in a number of individual cases, is likely to be a key issue in doing so.

It shows that age-saving profiles per se cannot separate competing theories <b>of</b> <b>saving</b> behavior. This means that the estimations of Euler-equation are not identified. ...|$|R

The article underlines problems of development and attraction of a wide circle of the population to the non-state pension provision. It identifies directions of solution of problems of accumulation of free financial resources and direction of them into investment projects. Results of theoretical and empirical studies testify {{to the fact that the}} pension system is capable of forming “long money”, which gives a possibility to invest capital for a long term, even in projects with slow payback, which is a significant advantage compared to the bank capital. Creation of an efficient institute of non-state pension provision should facilitate maximal attraction <b>of</b> <b>saving</b> <b>of</b> the population into economy of the country with the use of possibilities of insurance companies and non-state pension funds. It is expedient to continue study of mechanisms of provision of state incentives and guarantees for attraction of the population into active use <b>of</b> <b>savings</b> in the system of pension provision with the goal <b>of</b> <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> a significant investment potential for development of the national economy, which results in the necessity and urgency of study of these problems...|$|R

This paper focuses on Mexico and discusses a variety of policies through which the government of Mexico could stimulate a higher rate <b>of</b> <b>saving.</b> These ideas are building blocks rather than an overall plan. Some are mutually exclusive but most are options that could be combined to achieve a higher rate <b>of</b> <b>saving.</b> Although {{the emphasis is on}} policy options that can be helpful in raising saving, the paper also discusses proposals that would be likely to reduce the rate <b>of</b> <b>saving.</b> The primary focus of the paper is on tax reforms, {{but there is also a}} discussion of financial regulation, government debt management, and the new system <b>of</b> retirement <b>saving</b> accounts. ...|$|R
5000|$|Following the June 2002 {{parliamentary}} election, Garga {{and four}} other notable northern politicians released a statement in July, in which they alleged electoral fraud and announced the <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> a [...] "resistance front". They warned that the governing Cameroon People's Democratic Movement (RDPC) was moving the country back to single-party rule and called on politicians [...] "to transcend any divergence, selfishness and personal ambition {{in order to create}} a movement capable <b>of</b> <b>saving</b> Cameroon from collapse". Garga also joined other northern politicians in signing a September 2002 memo decrying the government's alleged marginalization and neglect of the north and urging that more attention be paid to addressing the north's problems.|$|R
