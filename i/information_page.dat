40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze the Web {{coverage}} of three search engines, Google, Yahoo and MSN. We conducted a 15 month study collecting 15, 770 Web content or <b>information</b> <b>pages</b> linked from 260 Australian {{federal and local}} government Web pages. The key feature of this domain is that new <b>information</b> <b>pages</b> are constantly added but the 260 web pages tend to provide links only to the more recently added <b>information</b> <b>pages.</b> Search engines list {{only some of the}} <b>information</b> <b>pages</b> and their coverage varies from month to month. Meta-search engines do little to improve coverage of <b>information</b> <b>pages,</b> because the problem is not the size of web coverage, but the frequency with which information is updated. We conclude that organizations such as governments which post important information on the Web cannot rely on all relevant pages being found with conventional search engines, and need to consider other strategies to ensure important information can be found...|$|R

25|$|Although {{counties}} {{are no longer}} used for local governmental purposes, they remain a popular means of describing where places are. They are officially used while applying for an Irish passport, which requires one to state one's county of birth. The name of that county then appears in both Irish and English on the passport's <b>information</b> <b>page,</b> {{as opposed to the}} town or city of birth on the United Kingdom passport. The Gaelic Athletic Association still uses the counties as its primary means of organisation and fields representative teams of each GAA county. The original system of car registration numbers largely based on counties still remains in use. In 2000, the telephone numbering system was restructured into an 8 digit scheme with (except for Belfast) the first digit approximately reflecting the county.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – This project {{initiative}} {{seeks to}} develop an integrated framework for managing the Library subscribed Databases. It aims to provide a single workflow for {{the administration of the}} subscribed databases and <b>information</b> web <b>pages,</b> as well as provide a modern and intuitive end-user interface for library patrons to access with ease and connect with social networks for information dissemination and sharing purposes. Findings – The initial workflow was disjointed and involved many parties in publishing subscribed database’s information on the database Web pages. This delayed the process of getting the information to the end-user. After reviewing the system and working with the IT support to enhance the workflow, publishing of a subscribed database on the webpage could be done much faster. The Subject librarians no longer need to know HTML coding as a WYSIWYG user interface using CSS technology is provided and control is now at their fingertips for publishing/updating database <b>information</b> <b>pages</b> under their purview in real time. Deliverables: Empower user (the Librarians) to publish and update <b>information</b> <b>pages</b> for databases under their purview independently and in real time. Enhance community resource sharing by linking <b>Information</b> <b>pages</b> to social networking sites...|$|R
