5|$|Higher-staged cancers {{are more}} likely to recur, as are those that have invaded the myometrium or cervix, or that have metastasized into the lymphatic system. Papillary serous {{carcinoma}}, clear cell carcinoma, and endometrioid carcinoma are the subtypes at the highest risk of recurrence. High-grade <b>histological</b> subtypes are also at elevated risk for recurrence.|$|E
5|$|<b>Histological</b> {{analysis}} of the lines of arrested growth within the tibiae from the various ontogenetic stages of Limusaurus indicates that the animal was skeletally mature at six years in age. In older specimens, the outermost lines of arrested growth are very close together (forming {{what is known as}} the external fundamental system), indicating that rapid growth had ceased in these particular individuals.|$|E
5|$|Long-bone {{histology}} enables {{researchers to}} estimate the age that a specific individual reached. A study by Eva Griebeler etal. (2013) examined long-bone <b>histological</b> data and concluded the Apatosaurus sp.SMA0014 weighed , reached sexual maturity at 21years, and died aged 28. The same growth model indicated Apatosaurus sp.BYU 601–17328 weighed , reached sexual maturity at 19years, and died aged 31.|$|E
5|$|Psoriasis is {{classified}} as a papulosquamous disorder and is most commonly subdivided into different categories based on <b>histological</b> characteristics. Variants include plaque, pustular, guttate, and flexural psoriasis. Each form has a dedicated ICD-10 code. Psoriasis can also be classified into nonpustular and pustular types.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{students}} of certain biological sciences, paramedics, prosthetists and orthotists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, nurses, podiatrists, and medical students learn gross anatomy and microscopic anatomy from anatomical models, skeletons, textbooks, diagrams, photographs, lectures and tutorials, and in addition, medical students generally also learn gross anatomy through practical experience of dissection and inspection of cadavers. The study of microscopic anatomy (or histology) can be aided by practical experience examining <b>histological</b> preparations (or slides) under a microscope.|$|E
5|$|Large thin flat mineralized plates {{have been}} found next to the ribs' sides. Their {{function}} is unknown; they {{may have played a}} role in respiration. However, muscle scars or other indications of attachment have not been found for the plates, which argues against a respiratory function. Recent <b>histological</b> study of layered plates from a probable subadult indicates that they may have started as cartilage and became bone as the animal aged. Such plates are known from several other ornithopods and their cerapodan relatives.|$|E
5|$|Lung cancers are {{classified}} according to <b>histological</b> type. This classification {{is important for}} determining management and predicting outcomes of the disease. Lung cancers are carcinomas—malignancies that arise from epithelial cells. Lung carcinomas are categorized by the size and appearance of the malignant cells seen by a histopathologist under a microscope. For therapeutic purposes, two broad classes are distinguished: non-small-cell lung carcinoma and small-cell lung carcinoma.|$|E

25|$|Mast cell tumors do not {{necessarily}} follow the <b>histological</b> prognosis. Further prognostic information can be provided by AgNOR stain of <b>histological</b> or cytological specimen. Even then, {{there is a risk}} of unpredictable behavior.|$|E
25|$|Ovarian cancers are histologically and genetically {{divided into}} type I or type II. Type I cancers are of low <b>histological</b> grade, and include endometrioid, mucinous, and clear-cell {{carcinoma}}s. Type II cancers are of higher <b>histological</b> grade and include serous carcinoma and carcinosarcoma.|$|E

25|$|Osteosarcoma is {{the most}} common <b>histological</b> form of primary bone cancer. It is most {{prevalent}} in teenagers and young adults.|$|E
25|$|From the <b>histological</b> {{point of}} view the WHO system {{is based on the}} same {{criteria}} as the St Anne-Mayo system.|$|E
25|$|SCLC is {{generally}} considered to be the most aggressive of these major forms of lung cancer, with the worst long term prognosis and survival rates. As a result, it is recommended that all multiphasic malignant lung tumors (i.e. those with more than one <b>histological</b> pattern) that are found to contain any proportion of SCLC cells should be classified as c-SCLC, and not as combined forms of any of the other <b>histological</b> variants present in the tumor. Currently, the only exception to this recommendation occurs in cases where anaplastic large cell lung carcinoma (LCLC) is the second <b>histological</b> component. In these instances, a minimum of 10% of the viable malignant cells present must be identified as LCLC before the tumor {{is considered to be a}} c-SCLC. Under the WHO-2004 classification scheme, c-SCLC is the only recognized variant of SCLC.|$|E
25|$|The giant-cell {{glioblastoma}} is a <b>histological</b> {{variant of}} glioblastoma, presenting a prevalence of bizarre, multinucleated (more than 20 nuclei) giant (up to 400 μm diameter) cells.|$|E
25|$|Lymphoma (lymphosarcoma) is a {{malignant}} cancer that is classified by location, cell type, and <b>histological</b> grade. The {{most common form}} in dogs is multicentric, involving the lymph nodes.|$|E
25|$|Definitive {{diagnosis}} involves <b>histological</b> {{evidence of}} eosinophilic infiltration in biopsy slides. Microscopy reveals >20 eosinophils per high power field. Infiltration is often patchy, can be missed and laparoscopic full thickness biopsy may be required.|$|E
25|$|Spermatidogenesis is the {{creation}} of spermatids from secondary spermatocytes. Secondary spermatocytes produced earlier rapidly enter meiosis II and divide to produce haploid spermatids. The brevity of this stage means that secondary spermatocytes are rarely seen in <b>histological</b> studies.|$|E
25|$|<b>Histological</b> {{grade is}} related to the {{aggressiveness}} of the cancer, and it is classified in 4 grades, with 1 having the best prognosis (5 year survival over 89%), and 4 with the worst prognosis (46% of 5 year survival).|$|E
25|$|LCLC-RP {{were first}} {{recognized}} as a distinct entity under the 3rd (published in 1999) revision of the World Health Organization (WHO) lung tumor <b>histological</b> typing scheme. Its placement in the classification schema went unchanged during the 2004 revision.|$|E
25|$|The antiendomysial {{antibody}} test is a <b>histological</b> assay for patient serum binding to esophageal tissue from primate. EmA {{are present in}} celiac disease. They do not cause any direct symptoms to muscles, but detection of EmA is useful in the diagnosis of the disease.|$|E
25|$|Renal cell {{carcinoma}} (RCC) {{is not a}} single entity, but rather a collection of different types of tumours, each derived from the various parts of the nephron (epithelium or renal tubules) and possessing distinct genetic characteristics, <b>histological</b> features, and, to some extent, clinical phenotypes.|$|E
25|$|Some {{individuals}} with CAIS or PAIS {{do not have}} any AR mutations despite clinical, hormonal, and <b>histological</b> features sufficient to warrant an AIS diagnosis; up to 5% of women with CAIS do not have an AR mutation, as well as between 27 and 72% of {{individuals with}} PAIS.|$|E
25|$|Reticula {{are located}} on the lateral and medial {{surfaces}} (sides) of the foot and were originally thought to be separate scales. However, <b>histological</b> and evolutionary developmental {{work in this area}} revealed that these structures lack beta-keratin (a hallmark of reptilian scales) and are entirely composed of alpha-keratin.|$|E
25|$|Progesterone antagonists such as {{mifepristone}} {{have been}} tested, {{there is evidence}} that it relieves some symptoms and improves quality of life but because of adverse <b>histological</b> changes that have been observed in several trials it can not be currently recommended outside of research setting.

25|$|Carnegie {{constructed}} commodious swimming-baths for {{the people}} of his hometown in Dunfermline in 1879. In the following year, Carnegie gave £8,000 {{for the establishment of a}} Dunfermline Carnegie Library in Scotland. In 1884, he gave $50,000 to Bellevue Hospital Medical College (now part of New York University Medical Center) to found a <b>histological</b> laboratory, now called the Carnegie Laboratory.|$|E
25|$|Histopathology - the {{microscopic}} examination of stained tissue sections using <b>histological</b> techniques. The standard stains are haematoxylin and eosin, {{but many others}} exist. The use of haematoxylin and eosin-stained slides to provide specific diagnoses based on morphology {{is considered to be}} the core skill of anatomic pathology. The science of staining tissues sections is called histochemistry.|$|E
25|$|Quantifying {{vasculature}} parameters such as microvascular density has various complications due to {{preferential staining}} or limited representation of tissues by <b>histological</b> sections. Recent {{research has shown}} complete 3D reconstruction of tumor vascular structure and quantification of vessel structures in whole tumors in animal models. This {{has been applied to}} assessing effects of chemotherapeutic drugs.|$|E
25|$|A committee, {{including}} Langley, {{was made}} up to investigate. Both the dog and the monkey were chloroformed. The right hemisphere of the dog was delivered to Cambridge for examination. Sherrington performed a <b>histological</b> examination of the hemisphere, acting as a junior colleague to Langley. In 1884, Langley and Sherrington reported on their findings in a paper. The paper was the first for Sherrington.|$|E
25|$|The {{mesocolon}} regions were traditionally {{taught to}} be separate sections with separate insertions into the posterior abdominal wall. In 2012, the first detailed observational and <b>histological</b> {{studies of the}} mesocolon were undertaken and this revealed several new findings. The study included 109 patients undergoing open, elective, total abdominal colectomy. Anatomical observations were recorded during the surgery and on the post-operative specimens.|$|E
25|$|Though {{environmental}} enrichment {{research has been}} mostly done upon rodents, similar effects occur in primates, {{and are likely to}} affect the human brain. However, direct research upon human synapses and their numbers is limited since this requires <b>histological</b> study of the brain. A link, however, has been found between educational level and greater dendritic branch complexity following autopsy removal of the brain.|$|E
