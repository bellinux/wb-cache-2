25|$|Alvin Smith {{was born}} in 1798, the first {{surviving}} child of Joseph Smith Sr. and Lucy Mack Smith. During his youth, Smith worked as a carpenter’s helper to assist the Smith family in saving up sufficient funds to make a <b>down</b> <b>payment</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> farm in Manchester Township, south of Palmyra, New York. Smith also assisted his father in clearing timber, planting wheat and tapping maple trees {{for the purpose of}} making maple sugar. A neighbor, Orlando Saunders, stated that the members of the Smith family “have all worked for me many a day; they were very good people. Young Joe (as we called him then) has worked for me, and he was a good worker; they all were.” In the early 1820s, Smith was involved with his father and brothers in a number of treasure digging excavations in the Palmyra–Manchester area.|$|E

5000|$|Leontyne Price {{was born}} in Laurel, Mississippi. Her father James worked in a lumber mill and her mother Katie was a midwife who sang in the church choir. They had waited 13 years for a child, and Leontyne {{became the focus of}} intense pride and love. Given a toy piano at the age of three, she began piano lessons with a local teacher. When she was in kindergarten, her parents traded in the family {{phonograph}} as the <b>down</b> <b>payment</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> upright piano.

500|$|Newton met Holmes {{early in}} October 1975 when, the former claimed, {{he was given}} a <b>down</b> <b>payment</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> fee of £10,000. Holmes later denied any such transaction, admitting only an {{agreement}} that Newton would carry out a frightening operation. On 12 October Newton, calling himself [...] "Peter Keene", drove to Barnstaple in a yellow Mazda car where he approached Scott, claiming to have been hired to protect Scott from a supposed Canadian hit man. This seemed plausible to Scott, who had been beaten up a few weeks earlier, and he agreed to meet [...] "Keene" [...] at a later date. However, he was sufficiently cautious to ask a friend to make a note of the stranger's car registration number.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Tim Riggins has developed over time from an unfocused and moody alcoholic {{to a young}} man of character and dependability. Sometimes that dependability is reflected in his uncanny ability to make the wrong choices for the right reasons, which usually involve his brother. Even though he has proven his ability to help others correct their misguided choices, unfortunately there is no one who does this for Tim. In this season, his irresponsible, headstrong, but lovable brother again entices Tim into another wrong choice by convincing Tim that {{the only way they can}} make any money is by transforming their newly opened garage into a chop shop. Just as they finally end this side business and Tim has enough for the <b>down</b> <b>payment</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> large amount of land he's been dreaming about, the police show up to arrest him at the garage. The police officers recognize Tim as [...] "number 33" [...] giving Tim no chance to deny that it's his chop shop. True to his character, he makes the decision to take the rap and allows his brother to be with his new wife and child. The season ends as Tim walks toward the jail.|$|E

He proposes to her in [...] "Spiffany's" [...] just as Betty and Jughead happen to walk by and witness. Veronica accepts and Betty runs weeping in an unknown direction. Jughead later chastises Archie for not telling him his plan. Eventually, Archie and Veronica tell Mr. Lodge, who accepts Archie as his future son-in-law {{as long as he}} works for Lodge Industries. Without any other jobs lined up, Archie goes along with it as his fiancee plans the biggest wedding Riverdale has ever seen.|$|R
2500|$|In 1894, the Wilder {{family moved}} to Mansfield, Missouri, and used their savings to make the <b>down</b> <b>payment</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> undeveloped {{property}} just outside town. They named the place Rocky Ridge Farm and moved into a ramshackle log cabin. At first, Wilder and her husband earned income only from wagon loads of fire wood they would sell in town for 50 cents. [...] Financial security came slowly. Apple trees they planted did not bear fruit for seven years. Wilder's parents-in-law visited around that time and gave them the deed to the house they had been renting in Mansfield, which was the economic boost Wilder's family needed. They then added to the property outside town, and eventually accrued nearly 200 acres (80.9 hectares). Around 1910, they sold the house in town, {{moved back to the}} farm, and completed the farmhouse with the proceeds. What began as about 40 acres (16.2 hectares) of thickly wooded, stone-covered hillside with a windowless log cabin became in 20 years a relatively prosperous poultry, dairy, and fruit farm, and a 10-room farmhouse.|$|R

It was a nine-mile paddle or sail, and a fifteen-mile walk or ride along a trail through the forest to the farm. Thomas Blinkhorn ultimately brought sixty acres under cultivation and established a dairy herd. Sandwich Islanders, called Kanakas, were employed to clear the land. Most of the other farm labourers were brought over from England. Blinkhorn also managed William Fraser Tommie's farm at Cloverdale, fifteen miles away.|$|R

In early 1969, Thompson finally received a $15,000 royalty check for the paperback sales of Hell's Angels and used two-thirds of the money for a <b>down</b> <b>payment</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> modest home and property where he would live {{for the rest of}} his life.

2500|$|Granger's father {{found work}} as a clerk in the North Hollywood branch of the California Department of Unemployment, and his salary allowed him to put a small <b>down</b> <b>payment</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> house in Studio City, where their {{neighbor}} was actor/dancer Donald O'Connor. At his office, Granger's father became acquainted with unemployment benefits recipient Harry Langdon, who advised him to take his son to a small local theatre where open auditions for The Wookie, a British play about Londoners struggling to survive during World War II, were being held. Granger's use of a Cockney accent impressed the director, and he was cast in multiple roles. The opening night audience included talent agent Phil Gersh and Samuel Goldwyn casting director Bob McIntyre, and the following morning Gersh contacted Granger's parents {{and asked them to}} bring him to his office that afternoon to discuss the role of Damian, a teenaged Russian boy in the film The North Star.|$|E
2500|$|When Lucy Stone {{married into}} the Blackwell family, she became an eager {{investor}} too but kept her purchases and accounts separate from her husband's. In 1857 they took equal ownership {{in a house}} in Orange, New Jersey, for which they traded western lands. They later sold the house to make a <b>down</b> <b>payment</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> farm in Montclair, New Jersey, and traded more western land to purchase a neighboring tract. After their return from Illinois in September 1859, Blackwell opened a real estate business, through which, in addition to selling and trading for clients, he traded western land for eastern properties. In this way both he and Stone became owners of a string of rental properties. While they were [...] "land rich," [...] they were [...] "cash poor," [...] so to raise funds for tax and interest payments, Blackwell briefly sold kitchen stoves manufactured by fellow abolitionist Cornelius Bramhill and then, from 1862 to 1864, was bookkeeper for the sugar refining business of one of his father's former employees.|$|E

2500|$|The Hells Angels became {{involved}} in a dispute between a Dutch drug trafficker and a Liverpool crime family in late 1992. The Liverpudlian gang had made a significant <b>down</b> <b>payment</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> large shipment of cannabis from Amsterdam which was seized by British customs officials during a routine check of a Dutch-registered ship docking at Manchester. Under {{the terms of the}} agreement, the drugs were no longer the responsibility of the Dutchman once they had left Dutch waters but the Liverpool family refused to pay the £140,000 owed and so the trafficker, a former Hells Angel, contracted the club to collect the debt owed to him. Three Hells Angels, Michael [...] "Long Mick" [...] Rowledge (vice-president of the Hells Angels' Wolverhampton chapter), Andrew Trevis (also from Wolverhampton) and Stephen Pollock (from the Windsor chapter) travelled to Aintree on October 7, 1992 and agreed to meet the Liverpudlians outside a supermarket in the Old Roan area. While the Hells Angels waited in their car, a gunman approached and shot Rowledge four times in the chest, killing him, before escaping in a waiting vehicle. In 1993, Delroy Davies was acquitted after a trial at Liverpool Crown Court and Thomas Dures was jailed for 13 years for conspiracy to murder.|$|E
2500|$|In 1909 Bartlett Richards bought 20,000 head {{of cattle}} from Mexico and in November of that year a very strong snow storm {{incapacitated}} the area. [...] "The Spade lost 10,000 of those cattle," [...] Lawrence said, [...] "and there was a pile of hides in Ellsworth {{as high as the}} depot." [...] Lawrence and his brother Ona skinned cattle for 50 cents a head, 25 cents per calf and everyday the intense cold brought more losses to the Spade. When Lawrence was old enough to file on a homestead, he described his land on the Alkali Lake Meadow as a quarter-mile deep and two miles wide, but he met requirements and received patent on the string of 40's in 1918. In 1925 Brass and Meyers arranged with Lawrence to buy the hay and have him care for and feed their cattle which were branded with Sandhills Land and Cattle Company's Sugar Bowl brand. Early on, Brass assisted Bixby with a $2,000.00 ($24,031.37 current) <b>down</b> <b>payment</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> loan to buy 2,000 acres (810 ha) of the Spade land. [...] Beginning in 1925, Bixby slowly began to obtain sections of the old Spade Ranch range by hard work and perseverance, aided by bankers willing to take a chance. In 1926, Brass and Meyers suggested Bixby move to the ranch headquarters in the Spade home valley. The same year Lawrence was asked by the Union Pacific assistant treasurer C.T. Cullen for permission to bring a hunting party to the Spade and {{for a number of years}} the men came in a private railroad car, bringing their own cook and paid handsomely for hunting rights on Bixby land and lakes. Mr. Cullen dropped by the day Lawrence was checking applications for the district school, where he was a board member. [...] "Hire this one with the Irish eyes," [...] Mr. Cullen suggested and in time Miss Eleanor Riordan of York, Nebraska began teaching Cherry County District #168. Lawrence conscientiously kept in touch with the young teacher and the day after her term ended they were married in Alliance, Nebraska on May 26, 1927.|$|E
