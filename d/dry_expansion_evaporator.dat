40|$|Under the {{supervision}} of Professors Sanford Klein and Douglas Reindl; 166 pp. Industrial refrigeration systems {{can be found in}} applications ranging from ice making to food processing and preservation to industrial chemical processes. These systems typically consist of many different components, each component may be produced by a different manufacturer. The operational data provided by the different manufacturers for each component is used by system designers to specify installation and operational procedures of the system. Often times, the optimum control of an individual piece of equipment results in sub-optimal system performance due to unforeseen interactions between the different system components. It is important to identify and monitor key parameters of the system, such as power consumption and refrigeration effect, in order to optimize the performance. The efforts of this research focused on modeling an operating, ammonia vapor compression, refrigeration system serving a two-temperature food storage and distribution facility located near Milwaukee, WI. This system utilized a combination of both single-screw and reciprocating compressors operating under single-stage compression, an evaporative condenser, and both liquid overfeed and direct <b>expansion</b> <b>evaporators.</b> The model was verified with experimental data recorded from the system and then used to identify alternative designs and operating techniques that lead to optimum system performance.

40|$|Performance of Organic Rankine Cycles is {{sensitive}} {{not only to}} the entry  temperature ratio betweenheat source and heat sink but also to the temperature  degradation of the heat source flow, caused bythe heat transfer to the process in pre-heater, evaporator and super heater. In order to adopt the cycleto the great variety of heat sources a multitude of fluids are required. Alternatively fluid mixtures,trans-critical or supercritical fluid conditions can be used to match the process temperatures with theheat source. Screw expanders offer an alternative, new approach to the matching problem of ORC’s asthey allow for flexible multi-phase expansion. Hereby the vapour fraction at the expander entry can beused to  partially match the temperatures of the process to a particular heat source. To provide aperspective on the use of such screw expanders in ORC-systems previous experimental andcommercial experience have been reviewed and discussed. Screw expanders are versatile machines used for the production of mechanical work in power rangesfrom 3 kW to 1. 5 MW. As the functional characteristics differ significantly  from dynamic expandersthe explanatory models used to generalise results are different. Plenty of research has resulted in wellgeneralized explanatory models for dynamic expander analysis. For screw expanders similarexplanatory models exist mainly in commercially confidential environments. A few public sourcesdisclose test data. In the few cases data has been investigated the analyses tend to rely onthermodynamic models suitable for <b>dry</b> gas <b>expansion.</b> Typically that leads to reasonable replicationof test results but seldom to models suitable for detailed understanding of the process. In applicationswith 2 -phase expansion the theories used to simulate functional characteristics is entirely insufficient. The main reason for  the scarcity of work in this field is probably the empirical difficulties in obtaininggood measuring data in multi-phase conditions. This paper describes a review of multi-phase screw expander experiences and explains why a uniquetheory is required to model its characteristics. In the absence of such a unique theory a correlationbased in empirical data is presented. This allow for estimations of screw expander efficiency in multi-phase conditions. Measured efficiency with <b>dry</b> <b>expansion,</b> or such efficiency simulated, can be usedto estimate adiabatic efficiency with expansion entry vapor fractions ranging from 0 to 1 by using thiscorrelation. Hence estimating expansion efficiency during multi-phase expansion is simplified,allowing for better optimisation of the ORC-systems.

40|$|To {{meet the}} terms of the Montreal Protocol, CFCs and HCFCs have been {{gradually}} phased out and they have been replaced by refrigerants that have zero ozone depletion potential. However, some of these fluids, such as R- 410 A, have global warming potential (GWP) that might still be of concern from an environmental perspective in case of leakage or improper charge management. Few studies of refrigerants that have zero ozone depletion potential and GWP less than 500 are available in the literature. Preliminary findings from these studies suggested that new development refrigerants were viable options. System COP and capacity were promising but there is not much information on the heat transfer and pressure drop characteristics of these low GWP refrigerants. This paper contributes to address this gap and provides new data for the two phase flow boiling heat transfer coefficient (HTC) and pressure drop of two new low GWP developmental refrigerant alternatives for R- 410 A. Heat transfer measurements were conducted for a copper tube commonly used in direct <b>expansion</b> <b>evaporators</b> of air conditioning systems with a 9. 5 mm (0. 375 in.) outside diameter and internally enhanced micro-finned surface. Data of local two phase flow HTC and pressure drop are presented for refrigerants R- 410 A, R- 32, R- 1234 yf and the two new developmental refrigerants referred to as DR- 5 and DR- 5 A. The experimental findings from this work indicated that the refrigerant R- 32 had similar and slightly higher heat transfer coefficient than that of R- 410 A at same refrigerant mass flux and similar heat flux conditions on the outer surface of the tube. Refrigerant R- 1234 yf had about 15 to 20 % lower heat transfer coefficient than R 410 -A at 4 ?C saturation temperature. For this saturation temperature the developmental refrigerants DR- 5 and DR- 5 A had heat transfer coefficients between R- 32 and R- 1234 yf when the vapor quality ranged from 0. 2 to 0. 7. An increase of the saturation temperature from 4 °C to 9 °C decreased the heat transfer coefficients for all of the refrigerants tested. The two phase flow boiling pressure drops increased monotonically if the vapor quality of the refrigerant increased.
