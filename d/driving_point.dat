5|$|The {{development}} of network analysis {{needed to take}} place before network synthesis was possible. The theorems of Gustav Kirchhoff and others and the ideas of Charles Steinmetz (phasors) and Arthur Kennelly (complex impedance) laid the groundwork. The concept of a port also {{played a part in}} the {{development of}} the theory, and proved to be a more useful idea than network terminals. The first milestone on the way to network synthesis was an important paper by Ronald M. Foster (1924), A Reactance Theorem, in which Foster introduces the idea of a <b>driving</b> <b>point</b> impedance, that is, the impedance that is connected to the generator. The expression for this impedance determines the response of the filter and vice versa, and a realisation of the filter can be obtained by expansion of this expression. It is not possible to realise any arbitrary impedance expression as a network. Foster's reactance theorem stipulates necessary and sufficient conditions for realisability: that the reactance must be algebraically increasing with frequency and the poles and zeroes must alternate.|$|E

500|$|This is {{sometimes}} referred to as the <b>driving</b> <b>point</b> impedance because it is the impedance at the place in the network at which the external circuit is connected and [...] "drives" [...] it with a signal. [...] In his paper, Foster describes how such a lossless rational function may be realised (if it can be realised) in two ways. [...] Foster's first form consists of a number of series connected parallel LC circuits. [...] Foster's second form of <b>driving</b> <b>point</b> impedance consists of a number of parallel connected series LC circuits. [...] The realisation of the <b>driving</b> <b>point</b> impedance is by no means unique. [...] Foster's realisation has the advantage that the poles and/or zeroes are directly associated with a particular resonant circuit, but there are many other realisations.

An approximation of this equation is calculated {{on the assumption}} that the gap capacities are negligible as is the case with ordinary antennas, and it is used to explain the stationary property of the input impedance. If the electric current distribution is expressed by the sum of a number of trial functions, the equation for determining the coefficients of the functions is found from this condition for the stationary properties. This equation is an improvement of the circuit equation for antennas written in terms of self- and mutual impedances defined by the EMF method. The mutual impedance is affected by all antenna elements. The trial functions for the electric current distribution must be smooth near the <b>driving</b> <b>points</b> and must be approximately constant within the gap.

[...] In order to maintain the constant resistance, the pairs of components C1/L1', C2/L2' etc., must remain dual impedances as the component is adjusted, so both parts of the pair must be adjusted together.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Tool path {{generation}} {{is an important}} part of ultra-precision manufacturing, and spiral tool path is one typical driving path. For single point diamond turning (SPDT), two methods are commonly used to generate the <b>driving</b> <b>points</b> on the spiral tool path, which are equally spaced angles and equally spaced arcs for two adjacent cutting points. But these two methods both have the defects for machining radial sinusoidal surface with SPDT. In this paper, the theoretical analyses of the two different methods are conducted and compared respectively. Then, an optimal method of generating the spiral cutting tool path is proposed on the base of theoretical analyses, which can avoid disadvantages of two original methods. The proposed method can enhance the machining accuracy and fabricating efficiency for ultra-precision machining of the radial sinusoidal surface with SPDT...|$|R
