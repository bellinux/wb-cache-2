5|$|The Immortals of Meluha is {{the first}} novel of the Shiva trilogy series by Amish Tripathi. The story {{is set in the}} land of Meluha and starts {{with the arrival of the}} Shiva. The Meluhans believe that Shiva is their fabled saviour Neelkanth. Shiva decides to help the Meluhans in their war against the Chandravanshis, who had joined forces with a cursed Nagas; however, during his journey and the fight that ensues, Shiva learns how his choices {{actually}} reflect who he aspires to be and how they lead to <b>dire</b> <b>consequences.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hindu scriptures provide diverse {{accounts}} {{of the birth of}} Kamadhenu. While some narrate that she emerged from the churning of the cosmic ocean, others describe her as the daughter of the creator god Daksha, and as the wife of the sage Kashyapa. Still other scriptures narrate that Kamadhenu was in the possession of either Jamadagni or Vashista (both ancient sages), and that kings who tried to steal her from the sage ultimately faced <b>dire</b> <b>consequences</b> for their actions. Kamadhenu plays the important role of providing milk and milk products to be used in her sage-master's oblations; she is also capable of producing fierce warriors to protect him. In addition to dwelling in the sage's hermitage, she is also described as dwelling in Goloka - the realm of the cows - and Patala, the netherworld.|$|E
5|$|Shruti's employer, Suryanarayana, {{suggests}} that she marry {{the man she}} loves. To repel Pasupathy's advances, she meets Pandu and proposes to him. After an attack by Narayana's henchmen, who are murdered by Pandu, he reveals {{that he is a}} gangster and {{suggests that}} she might want to rethink her proposal. After Shruti distances herself from Pandu, Pasupathy frames her with a mock sexual assault by a few gangsters unbeknownst to her family and the other villagers. He intends this act to ruin her life and subsequently force her to be his mistress. Learning this, Pandu confronts Pasupathy and warns him that he will face <b>dire</b> <b>consequences</b> if he is found guilty of being involved.|$|E

50|$|The story {{centers on}} the lives of Zeny (played by Gina Alajar) and her {{daughter}} Lira (played by Kris Bernal). In the story, Zeny is a loving and protective mother who takes all risks to save her daughter from death only to be abandoned by the same daughter after she literally had a change of heart. Soon, Zeny realizes that this is the <b>dire</b> <b>consequence</b> of one irreversible mistake she committed in the past.|$|R
5|$|Sudeshna's {{brother and}} Matsya's chief army {{commander}} Kichaka returns victorious from a conquest. Kichaka sees Sairandhri and is mesmerised with her beauty. He warns Sudeshna of <b>dire</b> <b>consequences</b> if Sairandhri does not willingly submit herself for unison. As Kichaka is the supreme power of Matsya, Virata and Sudeshna do not dare to oppose. Sairandhri warns and pleads Kichaka several times which bear no result. One night, Valala disguises {{himself as a}} woman and waits in the dance hall. Believing the woman to be Sairandhri, Kichaka enters the hall and is killed by Valala. Valala also kills Kichaka's hundred brothers who attempt to kill Sairandhri by making her perform Sati with Kichaka's corpse.|$|E
5|$|Another legend {{tells the}} story of {{conversion}} of Chamunda into a Jain goddess. According to this story, Chamunda sculpted the Mahavira image for the temple in Osian, Jodhpur and was happy with the conversions of the Oswals to Jainism. At the time of Navratri, a festival that celebrates the Divine Mother, Chamunda expected animal sacrifices from the converted Jains. The vegetarian Jains, however, were unable to meet her demand. Ratnaprabhasuri intervened, and as a result, Chamunda accepted vegetarian offerings, forgoing her demand for meat and liquor. Ratnaprabhsuri further named her Sacciya, one who had told the truth, as Chamunda had told him the truth that a rainy season stay in Osian would be beneficial for him. She also became the protective goddess of the temple and remained the clan goddess, Kuladevi, of the Oswals. The Sachiya Mata Temple in Osian was built in her honour. Some Jain scriptures warn of <b>dire</b> <b>consequences</b> of worship of Chamunda by the Hindu rites and rituals.|$|E
5|$|In Scandinavia, Haakon {{regularly}} {{met with}} neighbouring rulers in the border-area around Elven {{from the late}} 1240s through the 1250s. Using grand fleets as envoys, Haakon's fleet at most reportedly counted over 300 ships. Haakon sought to expand his kingdom southwards of Elven into the Danish province of Halland. He thus looked for alliance with the Swedes, as well as ties with opponents of the ruling line of monarchs of Denmark. Haakon {{made a deal with}} Swedish leader Earl Birger in 1249 about a joint Swedish-Norwegian invasion into Halland and Scania, but the agreement was eventually abandoned by the Swedes (see Treaty of Lödöse). Haakon claimed Halland in 1253, and finally invaded the province on his own in 1256, demanding it as compensation for the looting of Norwegian ships in Danish seas. He was however forced to renounce his claims in 1257 after a peace agreement was made with Christopher I of Denmark. Haakon thereafter negotiated a marriage between his only remaining son Magnus and Ingeborg, daughter of former Danish king Eric Ploughpenny. Haakon had also reconciled with the Swedes when he had his son Haakon the Young marry a daughter of Earl Birger. Haakon's Nordic policies initiated the build-up to the later personal unions (called the Kalmar Union), that in the end had <b>dire</b> <b>consequences</b> for Norway as it did not have the economic and military resources to persevere and maintain Haakon's aggressive policies.|$|E
60|$|With {{that she}} broke from him, white and scared, {{and reached the}} door. Yet with her hand upon the latch she paused. Looking at him she {{saw that he was}} smiling, and perhaps horror of her {{betrayal}} of him overwhelmed her. It must be that she then desired to warn him, yet with Bothwell within earshot she realized that any warning must precipitate the tragedy, with <b>direst</b> <b>consequences</b> to Bothwell and herself.|$|R
25|$|Conditions {{justifying}} {{newborn screening}} for any disorder include (1) a simple test with an acceptable sensitivity and specificity, (2) a <b>dire</b> <b>consequence</b> if not diagnosed early, (3) an effective treatment if diagnosed, and (4) a frequency {{in the population}} high enough to justify the expense. In the last decade more states and countries are adopting newborn screening for salt-wasting CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, which leads {{to death in the}} first month of life if not recognized.|$|R
50|$|Even at this era, it {{is quite}} {{difficult}} to see an Oru daughter married at Ibele community. Few years ago, a man known as Mattias Iheme from Eloka village of Ibele community wanted to break that covenant by going to marry a lady from Oru community. The community is precisely Awo-Omamma. When he intimated the elders of his intention to marry from Oru community, they {{reminded him of the}} covenant and <b>dire</b> <b>consequence</b> of breaking the covenant laid by ancestors.|$|R
5|$|The safest way to {{view the}} Sun's disk is by {{indirect}} projection. This {{can be done by}} projecting an image of the disk onto a white piece of paper or card using a pair of binoculars (with one of the lenses covered), a telescope, or another piece of cardboard with a small hole in it (about 1mm diameter), often called a pinhole camera. The projected image of the Sun can then be safely viewed; this technique can be used to observe sunspots, as well as eclipses. Care must be taken, however, to ensure that no one looks through the projector (telescope, pinhole, etc.) directly. Viewing the Sun's disk on a video display screen (provided by a video camera or digital camera) is safe, although the camera itself may be damaged by direct exposure to the Sun. The optical viewfinders provided with some video and digital cameras are not safe. Securely mounting #14 welder's glass in front of the lens and viewfinder protects the equipment and makes viewing possible. Professional workmanship is essential because of the <b>dire</b> <b>consequences</b> any gaps or detaching mountings will have. In the partial eclipse path, one {{will not be able to}} see the corona or nearly complete darkening of the sky, however, depending on how much of the Sun's disk is obscured, some darkening may be noticeable. If three-quarters or more of the sun is obscured, then an effect can be observed by which the daylight appears to be dim, as if the sky were overcast, yet objects still cast sharp shadows.|$|E

50|$|Thus, in Racine the hamartia, {{which the}} thirteenth chapter of Aristotle’s Poetics had {{declared}} {{a characteristic of}} tragedy, is not merely an action performed in all good faith which subsequently has the <b>direst</b> <b>consequences</b> (Œdipus's killing a stranger {{on the road to}} Thebes, and marrying the widowed Queen of Thebes after solving the Sphinx's riddle), nor is it simply an error of judgment (as when Deianira, in the Hercules Furens of Seneca the Younger, kills her husband when intending to win back his love); it is a flaw of character.|$|R

5000|$|Severely raised ICP, if {{caused by}} a {{unilateral}} space-occupying lesion (e.g. a hematoma) can result in midline shift, a dangerous sequela in which the brain moves toward one side {{as the result of}} massive swelling in a cerebral hemisphere. Midline shift can compress the ventricles and lead to hydrocephalus. [...] Prognosis is much worse in patients with midline shift than in those without it. Another <b>dire</b> <b>consequence</b> of increased ICP combined with a space-occupying process is brain herniation (usually uncal or tonsilar). In uncal herniation, the uncus hippocampus becomes compressed against the free edge of the tentorium cerebelli, frequently leading to brainstem compression. If brainstem compression is involved, it may lead to respiratory depression and is potentially fatal. This herniation {{is often referred to as}} [...] "coning".|$|R

30|$|As for bus drivers, {{the gender}} of the third parties {{involved}} in the accident is not correlated to the severity outcome of the accident. Unlike for bus drivers, the age of the third parties involved is related to higher levels of accident severity. The <b>direst</b> <b>consequences</b> are for collision partners over 45  years old, with a sharp increase of 43.0  % and 121.5  % in the probability of severe injuries and deaths for elderly over 65  years old. Moreover, the consumption of alcohol and the failure to wear seatbelts by drivers of the third parties are also associated with an increase in accident severity. Interestingly, these two negligent behaviors exhibit different trends, as alcohol intoxication relates to an increase in the likelihood of light (60.3  %) rather than severe (54.5  %) or fatal (21.7  %) injuries, while non-use of seatbelts relates to a rise in the probability of fatal (37.8  %) rather than severe (26.6  %) or light (11.9  %) injuries.|$|R
30|$|Surface {{conditions}} are correlated to bus accident severity and bus passenger injury probability. However, the measured effects {{in terms of}} increase in the probability of higher severity and injury occurrence are relatively mild and suggest that the road maintenance plan administered by the Danish road directorate likely mitigates the consequences of bus accidents. Notably, bus accidents are almost equally distributed across seasons, across weekdays and across time of day. Only time of day is related to accident severity with off-peak hours during both day and night increasing the probability of <b>direr</b> <b>consequences</b> for all persons involved in general and bus passengers in particular. Possibly, {{the organization of the}} shifts and the driving times could account for the need of the drivers to adapt to different traffic conditions within the same shift, as well as to different climate conditions in light of findings relating bus accident rates to high temperatures in Sweden [6].|$|R
