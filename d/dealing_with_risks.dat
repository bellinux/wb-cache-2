Second, the provision of risk information is likely to trigger a focus on relevant adaptation measures. Third, <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>risks</b> and local knowledge can vary between countries and therefore influence behaviour. Finally, adaptive behaviour can depend {{on the existence of}} and reliance on public adaptation. However, other implemented adaptation measures did not significantly differ between countries, indicating that an implementation of these measures does not depend on background, risk information, general <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>risks</b> or public adaptation.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} how companies <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>risk</b> in business networks. Drawing on empirical evidence from German food retailer-manufacturer networks and existent research {{conducted at the}} intersection of business network and institutional research, this thesis examines two under-researched questions: What constitutes risk in business networks? And how do companies <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>risk</b> in business networks? In answering these questions, this research refines our understanding of risk in business networks by proposing an uncertainty-based conceptualisation of risk and developing an institution-based explanation of how companies <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>risk</b> in business networks. While network research provides a relevant ontological understanding of business interactions, this thesis draws on institutional research to explain how companies use institutional devices, including industry standards, General Terms and Conditions and framework contracts, for <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>risk</b> at three interdependent levels of interaction: Network, focal, and dyadic interaction. In this way, the thesis offers one of the first ventures developing an institution-based explanation of how companies <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>risk</b> in business networks. The institution-based explanation of how companies <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>risk</b> is captured in the development of an integrative framework. This framework conceptually crystallizes the synthesis of network and institution-based research by mapping companies’ use of institutional devices onto the three levels of network interaction. The institution-based explanation illuminates how institutional devices facilitate <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>risk</b> interactively across direct and indirect interactions, because their manifestation in business artefacts enables transcending time and space. This contribution is informed by empirical analysis of business artefacts-in-use and is conceptually captured in extending the Actor-Resources-Activities model. Methodologically, this thesis employs a critical realist epistemology and network ontology to underpin qualitative case study research in German food retailer-manufacturer networks. The empirical evidence involves data triangulation from 42 in-depth semi-structured interviews, participant observation and analysis of business artefacts-in-use, including documentation of the International Featured Standard, eleven General Terms and Conditions and six framework contracts...|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{active welfare state}} (Hanesch 2001, Kazepov 2002, van Berkel 2003) {{represents}} an attempt to describe the recursive transformations of socio-economic phenomena and the policies that try to deal them. In particular, it depicts the changing scenario by means of these aspects (van Berkel 2003 : 1) : {{the emergence of new}} risks and social problems, new ways of perceiving them, new ways of <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>risks</b> and social problems, and the redefinition of the social responsibilities of actors in producing and <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>risks</b> and social problems (fig. 1). The interaction between these dimensions of change produces particular combinations that kindle very different policy models and practices. The paper try to sketch a theoretical approach, looking at the change strategies promoted and legitimated by different activation policies, particularly highlighting how the modes of construction of knowledge affect the underlying nature of activation daily practices, transversally to specific measures and governance processes. The object is to comprehend which conditions allow to promote inclusion and citizenship, and in turn making more effective local governance and welfare intervention. The main questions are: which learning processes are present {{as a result of the}} welfare system? How these processes are connected to the organisational dynamics? The attempt to answer these, is based on a classification of policies by means of the logical categories of learning (Bateson 1972) and of a combined typology of change strategies. As a conclusion the paper distinguishes three different concepts of activation, whose definition require further investigation both theoretically and in the field...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn {{the field}} of risk management, decision-aiding is often {{confused}} with and reduced to a problem of assessment. The decision-aiding cycle (canonical model) {{presented in this paper}} consists in several steps ranging from "stating and framing the decision problem" to "working out recommendations". The kernel of the canonical model relies on two main steps: "resorting to a decision-making model" and "eliciting judgmental information". Moreover, the canonical model is exemplified and tested on two fullscale cases experienced at EDF and INERIS from which elements of guidance are drawn. When <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>risks,</b> addressing such methodological questions should yield a sound basis of exchanges between the analyst and the decision-maker.
