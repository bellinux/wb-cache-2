Trends such as Arctic sea ice decline, reduced snow cover, evapotranspiration patterns, and other weather anomalies are <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the Arctic heat up faster than other parts of the globe. This in turn reduces the temperature gradient that drives jet stream winds, causing the jet stream to become weaker and more variable in its course.|$|E

5|$|Nilofar {{originated}} {{from a low}} pressure area between India and the Arabian Peninsula. It developed into a depression on October25 and moved generally northward through an area of favorable conditions. The system intensified into a cyclonic storm on October26. Quickly organizing due to the conditions, Nilofar developed a well-defined eye and structure, attaining its peak intensity on October28. At the time, Nilofar was <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> landfall in western India, prompting evacuations and preparations. However, high wind shear caused the storm to rapidly weaken, and Nilofar degraded into a remnant low pressure area on October31 off the Indian state of Gujarat.|$|E
5|$|The second issue, ironically, {{came about}} due to {{concerns}} about a Soviet ABM system. The US's existing SM-65 Atlas and SM-68 Titan both used re-entry vehicles with blunt noses that greatly slowed the warheads {{as they entered}} the lower atmosphere and made them relatively easy to attack. The new LGM-30 Minuteman missile used sharp-nosed reentry shapes that traveled at much higher terminal speeds, and included a number of decoy systems that were <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> interception very difficult for the Soviet ABMs. This would guarantee the US's deterrent. If there was a budget choice to be made, McNamara supported Minuteman, although he tried not to say this.|$|E

The state government set up storm shelters in schools and other public buildings. With emergency supplies at the ready, the state of Yucatán, Quintana Roo's neighbour to the northwest, declared a green alert. On August 19 a hurricane watch was issued on the Yucatán Peninsula from Chetumal to San Felipe and residents made their last-minute preparations.|$|E
5|$|According to Yoichi Wada, then-CEO of Square Enix, XIV {{was being}} planned {{as a serious}} rival to {{successful}} western MMORPG World of Warcraft. The game was developed primarily for Windows, and was then ported across to PS3. XIV was originally scheduled for simultaneous release on Windows and PS3 in 2010, but the PS3 version was delayed into 2011. This was explained as due to it taking longer than <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the adjustments needed so the game could fit within the console's limited memory. The game {{did not use the}} PlayOnline service used for XI. This was explained as being due to the marked decrease of content on the service. Instead, they would migrate to a new service that still allowed cross-platform gameplay, including the use of a universal Square Enix ID that would allow players to play from wherever they left off. In October 2009, the game's Beta release was announced as being only for Windows. First print runs of the PS3 version of Final Fantasy XIII contained a bonus code for the PS3 version of XIV for a special in-game item.|$|E

However, Chadwick chose to further his interest in Evangelical Christianity, which had existed from his school days. He graduated in 1941 and began his theological training in 1942, at Ridley Hall, Cambridge, being ordained deacon by the Archbishop of Canterbury, in Canterbury Cathedral, in 1943 and priest by the Bishop of Dover in 1944. He served a curacy at the Evangelical parish of Emmanuel, Croydon, arriving {{towards the end of}} the Second World War, as Croydon was attacked by German V-weapons, which provided a difficult pastoral challenge. From there, he became an assistant master at Wellington College. He married Peggy Browning in 1945, and they had three daughters.|$|E
