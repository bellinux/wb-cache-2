5|$|The direct {{participation}} of the royal and viceroyal figures in areas of governance is limited. In practice, {{their use of the}} executive powers is directed by the Cabinet, a committee of ministers of the Crown responsible to the elected House of Commons and chosen and headed by the Prime Minister of Canada (at present Justin Trudeau), the head of government. The governor general or monarch may, though, in certain crisis situations exercise their power without ministerial advice. To ensure the stability of government, the governor general will usually appoint as prime minister the person who is the current leader of the political party that can obtain the confidence of a plurality in the House of Commons. The Prime Minister's Office (PMO) is thus {{one of the most powerful}} institutions in government, initiating most legislation for parliamentary approval and selecting for appointment by the Crown, besides the aforementioned, the governor general, lieutenant governors, senators, federal court judges, and heads of Crown corporations and government agencies. The leader of the party with the second-most seats usually becomes the Leader of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition and is part of an adversarial parliamentary system intended to <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> in check.|$|E

25|$|Periphery {{countries}} are continuously exploited by countries {{due to the}} exportation of surpluses of raw goods to the more technologically industrialized core countries for manufacturing and distribution. Recently some of the manufacturing has been moved to periphery countries {{but it is still}} controlled and owned by the core countries. There are, however, ways in which periphery countries can rise from their poor status and become semi-periphery countries or even core countries. It is crucial for the core countries to <b>keep</b> exploiting <b>the</b> natural resources of the periphery countries and to <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>governments</b> semi-stable or else it could cause economic unrest for the core countries as a whole.|$|R
25|$|The direct {{participation}} of the royal and viceroyal figures {{in any of these}} areas of governance is limited, though; in practice, their use of the executive powers is directed by the Executive Council, a committee of ministers of the Crown responsible to the unicameral, elected House of Assembly and chosen and headed by the Premier of Nova Scotia (presently Stephen McNeil), the head of government. To ensure the stability of government, the lieutenant governor will usually appoint as premier the person who is the current leader of the political party that can obtain the confidence of a plurality in the House of Assembly.

25|$|With independence, {{the office}} of Chief Minister was renamed Prime Minister, but its {{functions}} were substantially unchanged. Mara retained power in the first post-independence election of 1972. Internal divisions within the ethnic Fijian electorate led to the narrow defeat of his Alliance Party by the Indo-Fijian dominated National Federation Party (NFP) in the election of March 1977. He tendered his resignation as Prime Minister, but the NFP splintered three days later in a leadership dispute, and a constitutional crisis developed. The official representative of Queen Elizabeth, Governor-General Ratu Sir George Cakobau, ended up calling on Mara {{to form a new}} government. Although unquestionably constitutional, the Governor-General's actions were controversial. Many Indo-Fijians were outraged at what they saw as a deliberate cynical move on his part to <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> of Ratu Mara, his fellow-chief (and distant cousin) in power at all costs. A subsequent election to resolve the impasse in September that year, however, appeared to vindicate Cakobau, when the Alliance Party won a record 36 seats out of 52.|$|E
500|$|In September 1869, {{financial}} manipulators Jay Gould and Jim Fisk set up {{an elaborate}} scam to corner the gold market through buying up all the gold {{at the same time}} to drive up the price. The plan was to <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>Government</b> from selling gold, thus driving its price. [...] President Grant and Secretary of Treasury George S. Boutwell found out about the gold market speculation and ordered the sale of $4million in gold on (Black) Friday, September 23. [...] Gould and Fisk were thwarted, and the price of gold dropped. The effects of releasing the gold by Boutwell were disastrous. Stock prices plunged and food prices dropped, devastating farmers for years.|$|E

The {{magazine}} noted that this denial was contradicted by a 1990 version of Barton's video America's Godly Heritage, in which Barton said: On January 1, 1802, Jefferson wrote to that group of Danbury Baptists, and in this letter, he assured them—he said the First Amendment has erected a wall of separation between church and state, he said, but that wall is a one-directional wall.

500|$|On 2 March 1835 Emperor Francis died, {{succeeded by}} his epileptic son Ferdinand I. Despite {{widespread}} opinion that Ferdinand was a [...] "ghost of a monarch", Metternich valued legitimacy highly and worked to <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> running. He soon accompanied Ferdinand {{on his first}} meeting with Tsar Nicholas and the King of Prussia, again at Teplitz. Ferdinand was overwhelmed, especially as the delegations paraded into Prague. Overall, however, it was an untroubled meeting. The next few years passed relatively peacefully for Metternich: diplomatic incident was limited to the occasional angry exchange with Palmerston and Metternich's failure to be a mediator between the British and Russians over their Black Sea dispute. He also put effort into bringing new technology like the railways into Austria. The most pressing issue was Hungary, where Metternich remained reluctant to support the centrist (but still nationalist) Széchenyi. His hesitancy is [...] "a sad commentary on his declining powers of political presence". At court Metternich increasingly lost power to the rising star Franz Anton von Kolowrat-Liebsteinsky, particularly in his proposals to increase military budgets. After his failed attempt in 1836 to force constitutional reform (which would have afforded him greater influence)—largely thwarted by the more liberally minded Archduke John—Metternich was forced to share more power with Kolowrat and Archduke Ludwig as part of Austria's Secret State Conference. Decision making ground to a halt. Entertaining and maintaining his estates at Johannisberg, Königswart and Plasy (together with Mariánská Týnice) were consuming much of his resources {{at a time when he}} had four young children to support, causing him more stress.|$|E
2500|$|Ferdinand was his parents' third son, his {{elder brother}} Charles was {{expected}} to inherit Naples and Sicily. When his father ascended the Spanish throne in 1759 he abdicated Naples in [...] Ferdinand's favor {{in accordance with the}} treaties forbidding the union of the two crowns. A regency council presided over by the Tuscan Bernardo Tanucci was set up. The latter, an able, ambitious man, wishing to <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> as much as possible in his own hands, purposely neglected the young king's education, and encouraged him in his love of pleasure, his idleness and his excessive devotion to outdoor sports.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the initial}} {{distrust}} of the King and Crown Prince and the loathing of Queen Augusta, Bismarck soon acquired a powerful hold over the King by force of personality and powers of persuasion. Bismarck was intent on maintaining royal supremacy by ending the budget deadlock in the King's favour, {{even if he had}} to use extralegal means to do so. Under the Constitution, the budget could be passed only after the king and legislature agreed on its terms. Bismarck contended that since the Constitution did not provide for cases in which legislators failed to approve a budget, there was a [...] "legal loophole" [...] in the Constitution and so he could apply the previous year's budget to <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> running. Thus, {{on the basis of the}} 1861 budget, tax collection continued for four years.|$|E
50|$|While {{leaving the}} {{sequestration}} in place, the House approved a bipartisan bill on March 6 {{by a vote}} of 267 to 151 to extend the continuing resolution from March 27 to September 30 and to <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> federal <b>government</b> from shutting down. The bill also provides Defense and Veterans Affairs some flexibility to fine-tune the sequester cuts.|$|R

On January 16, 2014, Congress passed a $1.1 trillion appropriations bill that will <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> federal <b>government</b> funded until October 2014. President Obama signed the appropriations bill into law on January 18.|$|R
50|$|On July 1, 1888, he {{resigned}} his Senate seat {{to become the}} Lieutenant-Governor of Manitoba. He was instructed to <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> Macdonald <b>government</b> updated on developments in the province, and to attempt to influence <b>the</b> <b>government</b> of Thomas Greenway on matters involving Macdonald's National Policy. He played little part in <b>the</b> Greenway <b>government's</b> anti-bilingualism legislation (which resulted in the Manitoba Schools Question), though he dutifully signed it into law on March 1, 1890, following Macdonald's orders. Schultz subsequently sought concessions for francophone schools.|$|R
2500|$|On 10 May 1940, Nazi Germany invaded France and the Low Countries. The Blitzkrieg (Lightning War) tactics {{took the}} Western powers by surprise. By {{the time of}} the {{resignation}} of the French Prime Minister Paul Reynaud on 16 June, it was obvious that Germany victory in the Battle of France was inevitable. In the Channel Islands, civilians worried about the consequences of remaining on the Islands but, to avoid panic, were told by the authorities to stay put. Senior officials were ordered to stay in order to maintain order and to <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>Government</b> functioning. On the 15 June, the British government decided to demilitarise the Islands, evacuating the British garrisons and leaving them undefended. The Germans were not informed however. [...] Evacuation boats for civilians only became available on 20 June and again, to stop a panic, people were still told to remain where they were and that only women and children should be taken. Only when the Lieutenant Governors of the islands evacuated were the recommendation relaxed. The last official ships sailed on 23 June.|$|E
2500|$|The opium {{trade has}} been a {{continuing}} source of financing for the Taliban. Taliban insurgents force farmers to grow opium poppies to fund their operations. [...] Daud was recently quoted as saying, [...] ""The Taliban have forged an alliance with drug smugglers, providing protection for drug convoys and mounting attacks to <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> away and the poppy flourishing." [...] General Mohammad Daud was further quoted in The New Yorker about this alliance, saying, [...] "There {{has been a}} coalition between the Taliban and the opium smugglers. This year, they {{have set up a}} commission to tax the harvest." [...] In return, he said, the Taliban had offered opium farmers protection from the government's eradication efforts. The switch in strategy has an obvious logic: it provides opium money for the Taliban to sustain itself and helps it to win over the farming communities. [...] In a continued effort to curb the opium trade in Afghanistan Mohammed Duad reported in June 2008 that police in Kabul set fire to 7.5 tonnes of narcotics. In April 2009, the Afghan anti-drug officers burned more than six-and-a-half tons of seized heroin, opium, hashish and drug-manufacturing chemicals worth up to £70 million on the UK market. [...] "If we do not burn the drugs, thousands of others will become drug addicts", said Daud, deputy minister for counter narcotics at the Interior Ministry. By burning this amount of opium and narcotics we show the people we are committed to the fight against drugs." ...|$|E

50|$|Convergence {{has also}} raised several debates about {{classification}} of certain telecommunications services. As {{the lines between}} data transmission, and voice and media transmission are eroded, regulators {{are faced with the}} task of how best to classify the converging segments of the telecommunication sector. Traditionally, telecommunication regulation has focused on the operation of physical infrastructure, networks, and access to network. No content is regulated in the telecommunication because the content is considered private. In contrast, film and Television are regulated by contents. The rating system regulates its distribution to the audience. Self-regulation is promoted by the industry. Bogle senior persuaded the entire industry to pay 0.1 percent levy on all advertising and the money was used to give authority to the Advertising Standards Authority, which <b>keeps</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> away from setting legislature in the media industry.|$|R
50|$|The Governor-in-Council {{recalled}} parliament on January 26, 2009. Its first business (after the Throne Speech) was {{to present}} the federal budget, which included a large deficit.

But at this moment the assent of her understanding went alone; it was given unwillingly. Her heart was recoiling from a right allied to so much narrowness; a right apparently entailing that hard systematic judgment of men which measures them by assents and denials quite superficial to the manhood within them. Her affection and respect were clinging with new tenacity to her godfather, and with him to those memories of her father which {{were in the same}} opposition to the division of men into sheep and goats by the easy mark of some political or religious symbol.|$|E
60|$|Finding this {{condition}} of things, and believing {{it to be}} an imperative duty upon the incoming executive to prevent, if possible, the consummation of such attempt to destroy the Federal Union, a choice of means to that end became indispensable. This choice was made and was declared in the inaugural address. The policy chosen looked to the exhaustion of all peaceful measures before a resort to any stronger ones. It sought only to hold the public places and property not already wrested from the government, and to collect the revenue, relying for the rest on time, discussion, and the ballot-box. It promised a continuance of the mails, at government expense, to the very people who were resisting the government; and it gave repeated pledges against any disturbance to any of the people, or any of their rights. Of all that which a President might constitutionally and justifiably do in such a case, everything was forborne without which it was believed possible to <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> on foot.|$|E

60|$|By {{the end of}} December Mr. Parnell {{decided that}} there was not the {{slightest}} possibility of any settlement being offered by the conservatives under the existing circumstances. “Whatever chance there was,” he said, “disappeared when the seemingly authoritative statements of Mr. Gladstone’s intention to deal with the question were published.” He regarded it as quite probable that in spite of a direct refusal from the tories, the Irish members might prefer to pull along with them, rather than run the risk of fresh coercion from the liberals, should the latter return to power. “Supposing,” he argued, “that the liberals came into office, and that they offered a settlement of so incomplete a character that we could not accept it, or that owing to defections they could not carry it, should we not, if any long interval occurred before the proposal of a fresh settlement, incur considerable risk of further coercion?” At any rate, they had better <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> in, rather than oust them in order to admit Lord Hartington or Mr. Chamberlain with a new coercion bill in their pockets.|$|E

The way is open for the working man to pass even to the Cabinet. And you are nothing of the sort. The cause of the people is not in any country so shamefully and badly represented. You have a bourgeoisie which maintains itself in almost feudal luxury by means of the labour which it employs, and that labour is content to squeak and open its mouth for worms, when it should have the finest fruits of the world. And all this is for want of leadership. Up you come you David Sands, you Phineas Crosses, you Nicholas Fenns, you Thomas Evanses. You each think that you represent Labour, but you don't. You represent trade--the workers at one trade. How they laugh at you, the men who like to <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> of this country in their own possession! They stretch down a hand to the one who has climbed the highest, they pull him up into the Government, and after that Labour is well quit of him. He has found his place with the gods.

6000|$|Of the subtreasury, then, as {{contrasted with}} a {{national}} bank for the before-enumerated purposes, I lay down the following propositions, to wit: (1) It will injuriously affect the community by its operation on the circulating medium. (2) It will be a more expensive fiscal agent. (3) It will be a less secure depository of the public money. To show {{the truth of the}} first proposition, let us take a short review of our condition under the operation of a national bank. It was the depository of the public revenues. Between the collection of those revenues and the disbursement of them by the government, the bank was permitted to and did actually loan them out to individuals, and hence the large amount of money actually collected for revenue purposes, which by any other plan would have been idle a great portion of the time, was kept almost constantly in circulation. Any person who will reflect that money is only valuable while in circulation will readily perceive that any device which will <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> revenues in constant circulation, instead of being locked up in idleness, is no inconsiderable advantage. By the subtreasury the revenue is to be collected and kept in iron boxes until the government wants it for disbursement; thus robbing the people of the use of it, while the government does not itself need it, and while the money is performing no nobler office than that of rusting in iron boxes. The natural effect of this change of policy, every one will see, is to reduce the quantity of money in circulation. But, again, by the subtreasury scheme the revenue is to be collected in specie. I anticipate that this will be disputed. I expect to hear it said {{that it is not the}} policy of the administration to collect the revenue in specie. If it shall, I reply that Mr. Van Buren, in his message recommending the subtreasury, expended nearly a column of that document in an attempt to persuade Congress to provide for the collection of the revenue in specie exclusively; and he concludes with these words: ...|$|E
