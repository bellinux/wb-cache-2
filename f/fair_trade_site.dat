40|$|Whilst {{there have}} been many {{accounts}} of success stories of <b>fair</b> <b>trade</b> in a variety of low income producer communities, {{there have been}} few critical accounts that examine the varied lived experiences of people in such communities. This thesis advances a developing critical literature by exploring reasons for unequal and uneven experiences of members of a Fairtrade certified producer organisation. As <b>fair</b> <b>trade</b> has expanded into new commodities and countries, both sugar and Malawi have to date been underresearched. This thesis addresses these gaps by focussing on Kasinthula Cane Growers Limited (KCGL) in southern Malawi. Developing a critical reflection that incorporates postcolonial and post-Marxist critiques, the thesis problematises definitions and assumptions regarding empowerment as a people-centred development approach and community as a cooperative social and political formation. This reflection is used to expand existing analytical frameworks to create a Postcolonial Agricultural Production Network as a framework to focus on a complex geography embedded in a local postcolonial production place. Doing so opens space to explore uneven geographies of production and empowerment shaped by embedded social and political factors. By un-masking inequalities, hierarchies, and dependencies in the institutional environment of a producer community, and incorporating perspectives from a range of producers, both intended and unintended outcomes from Fairtrade certification are examined. The thesis reveals that despite <b>fair</b> <b>trade</b> intentions to promote democracy, transparency, and participation, unintended consequences of exacerbating inequalities and discrepancies between low income producers, and over expectations of an impoverished society, have led to variable experiences of <b>fair</b> <b>trade.</b> Identifying <b>sites</b> of local inequality and unable and unwilling agents of empowerment highlights the important role of place in analysis. This demonstrates how embedded social and political formations in a particular place shape different experiences of <b>fair</b> <b>trade.</b> The findings propose a lesson to incorporate a more nuanced understanding of place in <b>fair</b> <b>trade</b> approaches that challenge assumptions of harmonious producer communities to sharpen focus on embedded inequalities and uneven producer community landscapes.

40|$|This thesis answers some {{important}} {{questions about how}} <b>Fair</b> <b>Trade</b> is experienced and perceived by some Northern sellers, consumers, activists, advocates, practitioners, and an importer. As it relates to sellers, I focus only on small scale independent businesses (i. e. I do not include large corporate businesses in my interview sample). <b>Fair</b> <b>Trade</b> works to establish a dignified livelihood for many producers in the South. Some {{of the most important}} actors in the <b>Fair</b> <b>Trade</b> movement are the people who buy, sell, and/or advocate for <b>Fair</b> <b>Trade</b> in the North. <b>Fair</b> <b>Trade</b> is largely a consumer movement which relies on the purchase of <b>Fair</b> <b>Trade</b> products. Without consumers purchasing <b>Fair</b> <b>Trade</b> products, retailers providing the products for sale, and activists raising awareness of <b>Fair</b> <b>Trade,</b> the movement, as it is presently constituted, would be non-existent. This qualitative research is based on 19 in-depth i. nterviews with nine interviewees involved with <b>Fair</b> <b>Trade</b> in Canada. I focus on benefits, challenges, and limitations of <b>Fair</b> <b>Trade</b> {{in the context of their}} involvement with it. I describe and analyze how people become involved with <b>Fair</b> <b>Trade,</b> what motivates them to do so, what they hope to achieve, and the benefits of being involved. I also describe and analyze how people understand and deal with any challenges and limitations associated with their involvement with <b>Fair</b> <b>Trade.</b> I also explore whether involvement with <b>Fair</b> <b>Trade</b> influences how people think about other products that they purchase and, if so, in what ways. I focus mainly on the commodity of coffee, but my discussion is not limited to this single commodity. Interviewees' experiences with and participation in <b>Fair</b> <b>Trade</b> vary in terms of their level of involvement and interest in the broader <b>Fair</b> <b>Trade</b> movement (as opposed to just participating in the market component). This research reveals that while <b>Fair</b> <b>Trade</b> is a small movement, sellers, consumers, and activists have had much success in the advancement of <b>Fair</b> <b>Trade.</b> While challenges have not deterred interviewees from continuing to participate in <b>Fair</b> <b>Trade,</b> analysis and explanation of such challenges provides the opportunity for <b>Fair</b> <b>Trade</b> practitioners to develop effective solutions in an effort to meet the needs of various <b>Fair</b> <b>Trade</b> actors...|$|R
