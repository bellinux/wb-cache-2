Based on the deep HETG 2007 and 2011 data sets, and confirmed by RGS and other HETG observations, the v-b component has a width of 9300 ± 2000 km s[superscript – 1] FWHM and contributes of order 20 % of the current 0. 5 - 2 keV <b>flux.</b> <b>Guided</b> by this result, SN 1987 A's X-ray spectra are modeled as the weighted sum of the non-equilibrium-ionization emission from two simple one-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations; this " 2 × 1 D" model reproduces the observed radii, light curves, and spectra with a minimum of free parameters. The interaction with the H II region (ρinit ≈ 130 amu cm[superscript – 3], ± 15 ° opening angle) produces the very broad emission lines and most of the 3 - 10 keV flux. Our ER hydrodynamics, admittedly a crude approximation to the multi-D reality, gives ER densities of ~ 10 [superscript 4] amu cm[superscript – 3], requires dense clumps (× 5. 5 density enhancement in ~ 30 % of the volume), and predicts that the 0. 5 - 2 keV flux will drop at a rate of ~ 17 % per year once no new dense ER material is being shocked.

Molecular oxygen {{from the source}} is coupled to a magnetic guide, delivering a cold, continuous, <b>guided</b> <b>flux</b> of 3 e 12 oxygen molecules per second, with a molecule temperature of a few kelvin.

A determination of the magnitude of the solar quadrupole moment, is one such constraint; it places limits on the density, angular velocity and magnetic field distributions inside the sun...|$|R
