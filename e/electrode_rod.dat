30|$|Raw {{data for}} the time series of the {{electrostatic}} potential of each sensor relative to the common electrode are processed in the following manner. First, outliers are removed from the data using a robust Kalman filter (RKF) with the Wiener filter (e.g., Kaneda et al. 2012). The RKF parameters are obtained by minimizing Akaike’s information criterion (AIC) (e.g., Kitagawa 1993). Second, using linear least-squares fitting, constant and linear components are removed from the RKF processed time series. At this stage, any combination of two electrodes gives the electric field parallel to the <b>electrode</b> <b>rod</b> when divided by the sensor distance (see Fig.  2 b). However, results demonstrate that Ch. 1 and 3 include more noise than other channels throughout the survey. Moreover, Ch. 3 shows large drift (Additional file 1 : Fig. A 1); we therefore decide not to use these channels for analyses. Third, we take an average of Ch. 2, 4, and 5 to obtain the electric field at each time. Finally, the electric field can be integrated along a survey line to ascertain the effective self-potential. This figure is not exact because the survey depth was not always constant. Moreover, the <b>electrode</b> <b>rod</b> might not be horizontal. Therefore, it is labeled as effective, but integration can produce a reasonable picture for practical purposes such as identifying the locations of self-potential anomalies.|$|E

NTP technology has not been commercialised as yet, due to its high rate of energy consumption. Therefore, it is important to seek out new methods to improve NTP performance. Residence time is a crucial parameter in engine exhaust emissions treatment. In this paper, different electrode shapes are analysed and the corresponding residence time and NOx removal efficiency are studied. An axisymmetric laminar model is used for obtaining residence time distribution numerically using FLUENT software. If the mean residence time in a NTP plasma reactor increases, there will be a corresponding increase in the reaction time and consequently the pollutant removal efficiency increases.
