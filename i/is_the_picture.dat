500|$|After another {{period of}} erosion, {{a series of}} lava eruptions from {{fissures}} across northeastern Oregon, southeastern Washington, and western Idaho inundated much of the Blue Mountain province with liquid basalt. Extruded in the middle Miocene between 17 and 12million years ago, more than 40 separate flows contributing to the Columbia River Basalt Group have been identified, the largest of which involved up to [...] of lava. The most prominent of these formations within the monument <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>Picture</b> Gorge Basalt, which rests above the John Day Strata.|$|E

500|$|Chaplin felt The Gold Rush was {{the best}} film he had made to that point. It opened in August 1925 {{and became one of}} the highest-grossing films of the silent era with a profit of $5 million. The comedy {{contains}} some of Chaplin's most famous sequences, such as the Tramp eating his shoe and the [...] "Dance of the Rolls". Macnab has called it [...] "the quintessential Chaplin film". Chaplin stated, [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> that I want to be remembered by" [...] {{at the time of the}} film's release.|$|E
500|$|The dance song [...] "Big Time" [...] has funk {{influences}} and {{is built on}} a [...] "percussive bass sound". Its lyrics satirise the yuppie culture of the 1980s, materialism and consumerism and {{are the result of}} Gabriel's self-examination, after he considered whether he may have desired fame after all. [...] "We Do What We're Told (Milgram's 37)" [...] was a song written for Peter Gabriel or [...] "Melt" [...] and is described as an interlude. It references the experiment on obedience carried out by American social psychologist Stanley Milgram, intended as a reference to the obedience citizens show to dictators during times of war. Marotta's drums on the song – said to resemble [...] "a heartbeat heard from the womb" [...] – were coupled with Shankar's violin and [...] "two overdubbed guitar tracks by Rhodes". The album is completed by [...] "This <b>Is</b> <b>The</b> <b>Picture</b> (Excellent Birds)", which Gabriel decided, forty-eight hours before his album submission, was to be included. [...] "Excellent Birds" [...] was composed with American musician Laurie Anderson and featured on her 1984 album Mister Heartbreak. This was interpolated with a recording called [...] "This Is The Picture", on which Nile Rodgers plays rhythmic guitar.|$|E
500|$|The {{principal}} {{rooms are}} contained {{on the piano}} nobile behind the west-facing garden façade {{at the rear of}} the palace. The centre of this ornate suite of state rooms is the Music Room, its large bow the dominant feature of the façade. Flanking the Music Room are the Blue and the White Drawing Rooms. At the centre of the suite, serving as a corridor to link the state rooms, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>Picture</b> Gallery, which is top-lit and [...] long. The Gallery is hung with numerous works including some by Rembrandt, van Dyck, Rubens and Vermeer; other rooms leading from the Picture Gallery are the Throne Room and the Green Drawing Room. The Green Drawing Room serves as a huge anteroom to the Throne Room, and is part of the ceremonial route to the throne from the Guard Room at the top of the Grand Staircase. The Guard Room contains white marble statues of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, in Roman costume, set in a tribune lined with tapestries. These very formal rooms are used only for ceremonial and official entertaining, but are open to the public every summer.|$|E

2500|$|Poirot {{reveals that}} the true murderer had been Elsa, who had become disillusioned and betrayed when she overheard Amyas reassure his wife {{that he had no}} {{intention}} of leaving her; he had made the promise to Elsa of doing so, merely to keep her from leaving so that he could complete his portrait of her, unaware that his model had taken his promise quite seriously. Although she falsely recalled the gist of this conversation, the mention of Caroline saying to Amyas, [...] "you and your women", showed to Poirot that Elsa was in the same category as all of Amyas' other, discarded mistresses, despite having been too young to realise this at the time, while he further notes that the remark made by Amyas of [...] "see to her packing" [...] was in regards to his intention to send Elsa packing once he was finished with his painting, and not about Angela; Caroline was distressed by his cruelty to Elsa despite his reassurances, and remonstrated with him on a second occasion about this. After overhearing their conversation, Elsa recalled seeing Caroline help herself to the coniine the day before, and stole some under the pretence of fetching a cardigan, which she then used on a glass of warm beer she provided Amyas; Poirot noted that his exclamation of [...] "everything tastes foul today," [...] meant that he must have drunk something already, before the cold beer that Caroline had provided, that had tasted foul as well. Amyas did not know he was poisoned until he began to become gradually weaker while Elsa was posing for his artwork, and that he knew by who by the [...] "malevolent glare" [...] he gave to the painting that Meredith had seen. Poirot notes the unusual vitality in the face of the portrait and says, [...] "It is a very remarkable picture. It <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> of a murderess painted by her victim – it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> of a girl watching her lover die." ...|$|E
2500|$|The chief {{representative}} of the German school {{in the thirteenth century}} was Rabbi Meir ben Baruch of Rothenburg. Many of his responsa have been preserved, the oldest collection being the [...] "She'elot u-Teshubot" [...] (Cremona, 1557) with 315 responsa, while another corpus, which contained 1,022 responsa, appeared under the same title at Prague in 1608. A collection of unedited responsa was issued at Lemberg in 1860, and in 1891 Moses Bloch published at Berlin a new corpus of unedited responsa of Meïr of Rothenburg under the title [...] "Sefer Sha'are Teshubot Maharam". Maharam, famously, rules that a man may not hit his wife, [...] "since,he may not hit another man, despite not owing him honour, whereas he owes her honour...". The special interest of Meïr's responsa <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> they give of the condition of the German Jews of his time, and of their sufferings from the caprice of princes and from heavy taxation. The collections of the responsa of Meïr of Rothenburg contain also the rulings of other older and contemporary rabbis of the Franco-German school.|$|E

60|$|Harmonious order {{governing}} eternally continuous progress--the web and woof {{of matter}} and force interweaving by slow decrees, without a broken thread, that veil which lies {{between us and the}} Infinite--that universe which alone we know or can know; such <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> which science draws of the world, and in proportion as any part of that picture is in unison with the rest, so may we feel sure that it is rightly painted.|$|E
60|$|Its {{appearance}} in modern days <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> of its character for ages past.
