40|$|Abstract. It is {{well known}} that a polynomial-based {{approximation}} scheme applied to a singularly perturbed equation is not uniformly convergent over the geometric <b>domain</b> <b>of</b> <b>study.</b> Such scheme results in a numerical solution, say σ which suffers from severe inac-curacies particularly in the boundary layer. What we say in the current paper is this: when one uses a grid which is not “too coarse ” the resulted solution, even being nonuniformly convergent may be used in an iterated scheme to get a “good ” approximation solution that is uniformly convergent over the whole geometric <b>domain</b> <b>of</b> <b>study.</b> In this paper, we use the collocation method as model of polynomial approximation. We start from a precise localization of the boundary layer then we decompose the <b>domain</b> <b>of</b> <b>study,</b> say Ω into the boundary layer, say Ω and its complementary Ω 0. Next we go to the heart of our work which is to make a repeated use of the collocation method. We show that the second generation of polynomial approximation is convergent and it yields an improved error bound compared to those usually appearing in the literature...|$|E

The ideas are extended to quadratic estimators of quadratic estimands.
