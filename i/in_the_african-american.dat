5|$|As {{the city}} grew, the hotels {{reflected}} ambitions {{of the strong}} economy, {{as evidenced by the}} eleven-story skyscraper Lamar Hotel built in 1927. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979, the Lamar Hotel was adapted for use as a county annex building. In 1988 it was listed as a Mississippi Landmark. The E.F. Young Hotel was built in 1931. A staple <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>African-American</b> business district that developed west of the city's core, the hotel was one of the only places in the city during the years of segregation where a traveling African American could find a room.|$|E
5|$|Harold Washington, {{the subject}} of the portrait, was elected in 1965 to the Illinois House of Representatives. After the death of Richard J. Daley in late 1976, Washington won Chicago's 1983 Democratic mayoral primary election. He was elected mayor, {{prevailing}} over Bernard Epton in a racially polarizing general election. His first four-year term was characterized by the Council Wars, a period of political conflict with the mostly white aldermanic majority in City Council. Seven Washington-backed aldermanic challengers prevailed in the April, 1986 special municipal election, facilitating progress with Washington's agenda. Washington died suddenly {{of a heart attack in}} his office. His death was followed by a period of mourning by Chicagoans, particularly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>African-American</b> community.|$|E

5|$|Winter in America juxtaposes {{themes of}} nostalgic hope {{to the social}} {{problems}} of the early 1970s, particularly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>African-American</b> community and inner cities. Also a prominent theme in Scott-Heron's lyrics is people's faith in their culture in a bleak, impoverished environment. The album features Scott-Heron's examination of maintaining one's cultural roots in a discouraging environment. Other themes include love, fatherhood, freedom, alcoholism, and political scandal. The themes of social disillusionment and the human condition featured on the album are also depicted on the Winter collage, representing the grim, sullen images of poverty, decay, and death in generally urban areas and ghettos. Created by artist Peggy Harris, the collage was featured on the original LP's inner sleeve and in the liner booklet of Winter in Americas CD reissue.|$|E
5|$|Letitia Woods Brown (October 24, 1915 – August 3, 1976) was an African American {{researcher}} and historian. Earning a master's degree in 1935 from Ohio State University and a Ph.D. in 1966 from Harvard University, {{she served as}} a {{researcher and}} historian for over four decades {{and became one of}} the first black woman to earn a PhD from Harvard University in history. As a teacher, she started her career in Macon County, Alabama between 1935 and 1936. Later in 1937, she became Tuskegee Institute's instructor in history but left in 1940. Between 1940 and 1945 she worked at LeMoyne-Owen College in Memphis, Tennessee as a tutor. From 1968 to 1971, she served as a Fulbright lecturer at Monash University and Australia National University followed by a period in 1971 working as a consultant at the Federal Executive Institute. Between 1971 and 1976 she served as a history professor <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>African-American</b> faculty of George Washington University and became the first full-time black member. She also served as a primary consultant for the Schlesinger Library’s Black Women Oral History project during the course of her professional career. Aside from teaching history, Brown wrote and contributed to books on Washington DC such as Washington from Banneker to Douglas, 1791 – 1870 and Washington in the New Era, 1870 – 1970.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} these suspicions, many African-American leaders {{supported}} efforts to supply birth control to the African-American community. In 1929, James H. Hubert, a black social worker and leader of New York's Urban League, asked Sanger to open a clinic in Harlem.Engelman, p. 160. Sanger secured funding from the Julius Rosenwald Fund and opened the clinic, staffed with African-American doctors, in 1930. The clinic was guided by a 15-member advisory board consisting of African-American doctors, nurses, clergy, journalists, and social workers. It was publicized <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>African-American</b> press and African-American churches, and received the approval of W. E. B. Du Bois, co-founder of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). In the early 1940s, the Birth Control Federation of America (BCFA) initiated a program called the Negro Project, managed by its Division of Negro Service (DNS).Engelman, pp. 175–177. As with the Harlem clinic, the primary aim of the DNS and its programs was to improve maternal and infant health. Based on her work at the Harlem clinic, Sanger suggested to the DNS that African Americans {{were more likely to}} take advice from a doctor of their own race, but other leaders prevailed and insisted that whites be employed in the outreach efforts. The discriminatory actions and statements by the movement's leaders during the 1920s and 1930s have led to continuing allegations that the movement was racist.Allegations of racism can be found in Franks, Angela (2005), Margaret Sanger's Eugenic Legacy: The Control of Female Fertility, McFarland; and in Davis, Angela (1981), Women, Race, and Class.|$|E

25|$|The {{religious}} institutions of African-American Christians commonly {{are referred to}} collectively as the black church. During slavery, many slaves were stripped of their African belief systems and typically denied free religious practice, forced to become Christian.

These practices, including dance, shouts, African rhythms, and enthusiastic singing, remain a large part of worship <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>African-American</b> church.|$|E

25|$|The {{rates of}} {{breastfeeding}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>African-American</b> community remain {{much lower than}} any other race, {{for a variety of}} reasons. These include the legacy of Wet nursing during slavery, as well as systemic racism in the American healthcare system that does not offer adequate support to African-American breastfeeding mothers. While for other races as socio-economic class raises rates of breastfeeding also go up, for the African-American community breastfeeding rates remain consistently low regardless of socio-economic class.|$|E
25|$|This {{apparent}} {{weakness is}} balanced by mutual-aid systems established by extended {{family members to}} provide emotional and economic support. Older family members pass on social and cultural traditions such as religion and manners to younger family members. In turn, the older family members are cared for by younger family members when they cannot care for themselves. These relationships exist at all economic levels <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>African-American</b> community, providing strength and support both to the African-American family and the community.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the South Carolina campaign, most pundits had {{predicted}} Barack Obama the winner, {{primarily because of}} the state's large African-American population.

25|$|Funeral traditions tend to vary {{based on}} a number of factors, {{including}} religion and location, but {{there are a number of}} commonalities. Probably the most important part of death and dying <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>African-American</b> culture is the gathering of family and friends.

25|$|In the 19th century, as {{the result}} of the blackface {{minstrel}} show, African-American music entered mainstream American society. By the early 20th century, several musical forms with origins <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>African-American</b> community had transformed American popular music. Aided by the technological innovations of radio and phonograph records, ragtime, jazz, blues, and swing also became popular overseas, and the 1920s became known as the Jazz Age. The early 20th century also saw the creation of the first African-American Broadway shows, films such as King Vidor's Hallelujah!, and operas such as George Gershwin's Porgy and Bess.|$|E
25|$|In {{the decades}} after slavery and {{particularly}} during the depression era, Islam reemerged {{in the form of}} highly visible and sometimes controversial movements <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>African-American</b> community.

Ali had a profound influence on Wallace Fard, who later founded the Black nationalist Nation of Islam in 1930. Elijah Muhammad became head of the organization in 1934. Much like Malcolm X, who left the Nation of Islam in 1964, many African-American Muslims now follow traditional Islam.|$|E
