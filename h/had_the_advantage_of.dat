5|$|A {{secondary}} cutoff {{named the}} Slate Creek or Kinney Cutoff breaks {{from the main}} trail near the Lombard Ferry on the Green River, and meets the Sublette cutoff on Slate Creek Ridge at Emigrant Springs. This route was slightly longer than the Sublette, but <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> only 10 waterless miles rather than the 45 endured on the Sublette trail.|$|E
5|$|Nearly {{a decade}} after the Tagora had ceased production, the view of the car in the {{automotive}} press was that it was merely average though there was little actively wrong with the car. The view was that the Tagora <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> refinement, good manners and, in V6 form, good performance. Rust was identified as the single biggest problem for the surviving cars, usually around the rear suspension mountings. Buckley suggested that the car might attain collectible status by 2003.|$|E

5|$|Placing {{the engines}} within the wings <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> a {{reduction}} in the risk of foreign object damage, which could seriously damage jet engines. The low-mounted engines and good placement of service panels also made aircraft maintenance easier to perform. However, the Comet's buried engine configuration increased its structural weight and complexity. Armour had to be placed around the engine cells to contain debris from any serious engine failures; also, placing the engines inside the wing required a more complicated wing structure.|$|E
5|$|The All Blacks played Glamorgan in Swansea on 21 December. The All Blacks <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> {{the wind}} in the first 30 minutes. Late in the first half Roberts worked a move from a scrum to pass to Smith, who passed to Harold Abbott. Abbott then passed back to Smith who scored in the corner. In the second half Glamorgan {{attacked}} but could not score, and late in the game the All Blacks scored tries to McDonald and Wallace to win 9â€“0.|$|E
5|$|The Comet's thin metal {{skin was}} {{composed}} of advanced new alloys and was both riveted and chemically bonded, which saved weight and reduced the risk of fatigue cracks spreading from the rivets. The chemical bonding process was accomplished using a new adhesive, Redux, which was liberally used {{in the construction of}} the wings and the fuselage of the Comet; it also <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> simplifying the manufacturing process.|$|E

5|$|The lighter Lewis gun {{was adopted}} for land and {{aircraft}} use in October 1915. The Lewis gun <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> being about 80% faster to build than the Vickers, {{and far more}} portable. By the end of World War I, over 50,000 Lewis Guns had been produced; they were nearly ubiquitous on the Western Front, outnumbering the Vickers gun by a ratio of about 3:1.|$|E
5|$|The {{series of}} events that caused Kean to change the {{direction}} of DeChow's attack toward Komam-ni began at 01:00, September 3. The 1st Battalion, 35th Infantry, protruded farther westward at this time than any other unit of the UN forces in Korea. Behind its positions on Sibidang-san the main supply route and rear areas were in North Korean hands, and only in daylight and under escort could vehicles travel the road. On Sibidang-san the battalion had held its original positions after the heavy fighting of September 1, completely surrounded by barbed wire, booby traps, and flares, with all supporting weapons inside its tight perimeters. The battalion <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> calling for protective artillery fire covering all approaches. An hour after midnight a North Korean assault struck the battalion. The fight there continued until dawn September 3, when the 1st Battalion, 35th Infantry, counted 143 North Korean dead in front of its positions, and on that basis estimated that the total North Korean casualties must have been about 500 men. The 35th units also <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> well-constructed strong points throughout the battle which the North Koreans could not penetrate.|$|E
5|$|Two {{industrial}} zones {{were set}} up within the township in 1974 by the Saline County Industrial Development Co., one located in Dorrisville, and the other located near the Harrisburg-Raleigh Airport. The one in Dorrisville <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> rail spur prior to {{the removal of the}} New York Central tracks. A Tax Increment Finance district was built on the property of the old rail yard north of the city where the Harrisburg Professional Park was built.|$|E

5|$|Voorhis <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> incumbency, {{but this}} was {{balanced}} by other factors favoring Nixon. Due to the press of Congressional business, Voorhis was able to devote only two months to the campaign, while Nixon campaigned in the district for ten months. Voorhis's time was further limited when, while en route to California from Washington D.C. in August, {{he was forced to}} have surgery for hemorrhoids in Ogden, Utah. He spent two weeks in an Ogden hotel recuperating from the operation.|$|E
5|$|When {{several of}} the {{fuselage}} alloys were discovered to be vulnerable to weakening via metal fatigue, a detailed routine inspection process was introduced. As well as thorough visual inspections of the outer skin, mandatory structural sampling was routinely conducted by both civil and military Comet operators. The need to inspect areas not easily viewable by the naked eye led {{to the introduction of}} widespread radiography examination in aviation; this also <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> detecting cracks and flaws too small to be seen otherwise.|$|E
5|$|As {{far as the}} Belgians were concerned, the Dyle Plan had advantages. Instead of {{the limited}} Allied advance to the Scheldt, or meeting the Germans on the Franco-Belgian border, the move to the Dyle river would reduce the Allied front in central Belgium by , freeing more forces {{for use as a}} {{strategic}} reserve. It was felt it would save more Belgian territory, in particular the eastern industrial regions. It also <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> absorbing Dutch and Belgian Army formations (including some 20 Belgian divisions). Gamelin was to justify the Dyle Plan after the defeat using these arguments.|$|E

5|$|As the Confederate forces {{approached}} Vicksburg, Pemberton {{could put}} only 18,500 troops in his lines. Grant had over 35,000, {{with more on}} the way. However, Pemberton <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> terrain and fortifications that made his defense nearly impregnable. The defensive line around Vicksburg ran approximately 6.5 miles, based on terrain of varying elevations that included hills and knobs with steep angles for an attacker to ascend under fire. The perimeter included many gun pits, forts, trenches, redoubts, and lunettes. The major fortifications of the line included Fort Hill, on a high bluff north of the city; the Stockade Redan, dominating the approach to the city on Graveyard Road from the northeast; the 3rd Louisiana Redan; the Great Redoubt; the Railroad Redoubt, protecting the gap for the railroad line entering the city; the Square Fort (Fort Garrott); a salient along the Hall's Ferry Road; and the South Fort.|$|E
5|$|Bridges {{and other}} key points were {{prepared}} for demolition at short notice by preparing chambers filled with explosives. A Depth Charge Crater was a site in a road (usually at a junction) prepared with buried explosives that could be detonated to instantly form a deep crater as an anti-tank obstacle. The Canadian pipe mine (later known as the McNaughton Tube after General Andrew McNaughton) was a horizontally bored pipe packed with explosivesâ€“ once in place this {{could be used to}} instantly ruin a road or runway. Prepared demolitions <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> being undetectable from the airâ€”the enemy could not take any precautions against them, or plot a route of attack around them.|$|E
5|$|But {{in early}} August, Holmes Ã  Court {{contacted}} Jackson and talks resumed. Jackson only raised {{his bid to}} $47.5million, but he <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> being able to close the deal faster, having completed due diligence of ATV Music prior to any formal agreement. He also agreed to visit Australia as a guest of Holmes Ã  Court and appear on the Channel Seven Perth Telethon. Holmes Ã  Court included some more assets and agreed to establish a scholarship in Jackson's name at a U.S. university. Branca closed the deal and purchased ATV Music on Jackson's behalf for $47.5million on August 10. 1985. In October 1985, Jackson fulfilled his contract provision to visit Perth, Western Australia and appear on the telethon, where he spoke briefly and met with two children.|$|E

5|$|Entering the season, Boudreau had amassed 189 wins in 309 NHL games. The win total put him {{on track}} to surpass Don Cherry as the fastest head coach to reach 200 NHL victories. After {{reaching}} 199 wins, Washington went on a four-game losing streak before finally earning Boudreau the milestone win. Despite the losing streak, Boudreau registered his 200th win in 326 games, eclipsing Cherry's previous mark of 341 games. While Boudreau set the record, he <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> overtime and shootout victories, which did not exist during Cherry's coaching career. Boudreau was fired seven days after setting the record.|$|E
5|$|Hesse had {{anticipated}} {{some kind of}} attack from the rear and had kept a mobile force in reserve to guard against such an eventuality. It was formed by an English company, and two Spanish companies: a regular company under captain Francisco de Sandoval and a Catalan company of miquelets under Jaume Burguy, numbering 300 men, all of them led by Hesse's brother Heinrich. This reserve immediately responded and engaged the Spanish Bourbons at Middle Hill. Although the Bourbons <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> height, they were effectively trapped against the precipice of the Rock and only had three rounds of ammunition each, {{as a result of}} travelling light; they had not come prepared for a pitched battle.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the Navy {{withdrew from the}} project. Stormfury began to refocus its efforts on understanding, rather than modifying, {{tropical}} cyclones. At the same time, the Project's aircraft were {{nearing the end of}} their operational lifetimes. At the cost of $30million (year unknown) two Lockheed P-3's were acquired. Due to the rarity of Atlantic hurricanes meeting the safety requirements, plans were made to move Stormfury to the Pacific and experiment on the large number of typhoons there. This action required many of the same safety requirements as in the Atlantic, but <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> a much higher number of potential subjects.|$|E
