5|$|Most of Leonardo's {{writings}} are in mirror-image cursive. While secrecy {{is often}} suggested {{as the reason}} for this style of writing, it may have been more of a practical expediency.

5|$|According to {{writer and}} film {{director}} Jukka Virtanen, Vainio usually wrote his lyrics {{at the same}} time as the music. This is evident in the song Vanhojapoikia viiksekkäitä, written as a waltz and whose lyrics feature an aged bachelor who never got to dance at his own wedding. Virtanen has said that while Vainio worked at a fast pace, songs were never easy for <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>write.</b> His work did not become easier when he quit drinking, but it did become more emotional.|$|E

Following Macedonski's intercession, Caion was also supported by the historian Grigore Tocilescu, who made Caragiale the sole topic of his Romanian Atheneum conference (January 24, 1902).|$|E

5|$|Although {{he never}} {{abandoned}} {{the idea of}} composing a full opera, and considered many subjects– including that of the Nibelung saga later adapted by Wagner, about which he corresponded with his sister Fanny– he never wrote {{more than a few}} pages of sketches for any project. In Mendelssohn's last years the opera manager Benjamin Lumley tried to contract <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> an opera from Shakespeare's The Tempest on a libretto by Eugène Scribe, and even announced it as forthcoming in 1847, the year of Mendelssohn's death. The libretto was eventually set by Fromental Halévy. At his death Mendelssohn left some sketches for an opera on the story of the Lorelei.|$|E
5|$|Blitz {{conceived}} a rough storyline for {{the film}} while making Spellbound, a documentary about 1999's Scripps National Spelling Bee, but an HBO Films executive persuaded <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> the film based on his own adolescence {{when he told her}} about his experiences as a stutterer. The film's producers visited several cities in the United States and Canada; Thompson was cast based on a tape which his agent had sent and a follow-up audition after the first actor cast in the lead was forced to pull out. The film was shot over 30 days in Baltimore, Maryland and Trenton, New Jersey.|$|E
5|$|Daniel Knauf {{felt that}} Brother Justin shares {{patterns}} with certain religious leaders who were often persecuted for their delusional visions. Historical figures like Father Coughlin, Aimee Semple McPherson and Brigham Young served as inspiration, although the writers refrained from re-telling their particular stories. Daniel Knauf originally thought of making Brother Justin a Protestant minister, {{but when the}} producers needed to decide on a specific religious affiliation, Knauf contested their plans {{to make him a}} Catholic priest. Knauf, a Catholic himself, settled on the Methodist denomination, which he perceived as significantly less clichéd, suspicious or controversial. When asked whether God had influenced <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> the story, Knauf replied no.|$|E
50|$|In his career, Benjamin {{was also}} a noted figure in {{comparative}} international education. He traveled to many Latin countries comparing the way the U.S. and other countries ran their higher education systems, which led <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>writing</b> a well-known book Higher Education in the American Republic (Guthrie 169). Harold R.W. Benjamin’s main purpose in his work was to preserve the democratic processes in American schooling and for an awakening of instructional consciousness toward individual differences. This belief led <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>writing</b> another well known book, The Saber-Tooth Curriculum. The Saber-Tooth Curriculum was written by Benjamin in a pseudo name of J. Abner Peddiwell. Published in 1939, The Saber-Tooth Curriculum is satirical commentary explaining how unexamined traditions of schooling can result in resisting needed changes (Guthrie 169). He believed education needs to be responsive to the emerging needs of the life experience and he felt education in his time was sticking to teachings of old rather than of present times.|$|R

It was followed by productions of Blithe Spirit in which he starred with Claudette Colbert, Lauren Bacall and Mildred Natwick and This Happy Breed with Edna Best and Roger Moore. Despite excellent reviews, the audience viewing figures were moderate.|$|E
5|$|In August 1968, in an {{interview}} to Rolling Stone, Townsend talked about a new rock opera, which had the working title of Deaf, Dumb and Blind Boy, and described the entire plot in great detail, which ran to 11 pages. Who biographer Dave Marsh subsequently said the interview described the narrative better than the finished album. Townshend later regretted publishing so much detail, as he felt it forced <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> the album according to that blueprint. The rest of the Who, however, were enthusiastic about the idea, and let him have artistic control over the project.|$|E

5|$|In mid-1877, Rimsky-Korsakov thought {{increasingly}} {{about the}} short story May Night by Nikolai Gogol. The story had long been a favorite of his, and his wife Nadezhda had encouraged <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> an opera based on it from the day of their betrothal, when they had read it together. While musical ideas for such a work predated 1877, now they came with greater persistence. By early 1878 the project took an increasing amount of his attention; in February he started writing in earnest, and he finished the opera by early November.|$|E
