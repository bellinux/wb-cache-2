This {{was partly}} due to the festival seating, where the first to enter get the best positions. Some fans waiting outside mistook the band's soundcheck for the concert, and {{attempted}} to force their way <b>inside.</b> <b>As</b> only a few entrance doors were opened, a bottleneck situation ensued with thousands trying to gain entry, and the crush became deadly.|$|E

The next year, they launched a socialist-oriented journal, Siasat (Tactics), which was published weekly. During this period Soedjatmoko dropped the name Mangoendiningrat, as it reminded him of the feudal aspects of Indonesian culture.|$|E
