50|$|The last zone is {{a cooling}} zone to {{gradually}} cool the processed board and solidify the solder joints. Proper cooling inhibits excess intermetallic formation or thermal {{shock to the}} components. Typical temperatures in the cooling zone range from 30 - 100 °C (86 - 212 °F). A fast cooling rate is chosen to create a fine grain structure that is most mechanically sound. Unlike the maximum ramp-up rate, the ramp-down rate is often ignored. It {{may be that the}} ramp rate is less critical above certain temperatures, however, the maximum allowable slope for any component should apply whether the component <b>is</b> <b>heating</b> <b>up</b> or cooling down. A cooling rate of 4°C/s is commonly suggested. It is a parameter to consider when analyzing process results.|$|E

50|$|In a {{globular}} cluster 65 million light years from Earth evidence is accumulating {{that a black}} hole, one thousand times more massive than the sun, has caused {{the destruction of a}} white dwarf star. It appears that the white dwarf <b>is</b> <b>heating</b> <b>up</b> as it falls toward the black hole. This event creates an intense stellar astrophysical X-ray source, called an ultraluminous X-ray source. The indication of this type of strong X-ray source means that it is more luminous than any known stellar X-ray source, but less luminous than the X-ray intensity of supermassive black holes, which places it in the range of theorized intermediate black holes. Their exact nature of ULXs has remained a mystery, but one suggestion is that some ULXs are black holes with masses between about a hundred and a thousands times that of the Sun.|$|E

He fears that the Irgun will damage his efforts, especially since the British have put a price on Akiva's head.|$|E

5000|$|During the party, Patrick insults Spencer's {{upbringing}} and belittles him {{in front}} {{of the rest of the}} partygoers. In retaliation, Spencer hits Patrick in the face and disrupts the event. In the aftermath, Brian shares a drink with Rebecca and tries to apologise for his behaviour. However, Rebecca still feels that Brian is in love with Alice and encourages him to follow his heart and tell her how he feels. He takes her advice and arrives at Alice's flat to declare his love, but discovers Spencer already there. Excited by his violent behaviour at the party, she had invited him back to her place. Brian feels betrayed by both Alice and Spencer, especially since he had told his friend how he had felt about her. Brian falls into a depression and struggles with not only concentrating during University Challenge practices, but also with his studies, threatening his university place. Patrick becomes increasingly frustrated with Brian, and just as they arrive for their University Challenge match, berates him for his lack of focus. Brian headbutts Patrick in response, but only ends up knocking himself unconscious. He is revived backstage by Rebecca who has come to watch the show and gives him encouragement before he is escorted to the set. However, as he is being brought back to his team, Brian is briefly left with an open envelope containing the quiz questions. He reads one of the cards before putting it back in the envelope, and, inspired by the relative ease of the question, rejoins his team. The match starts off poorly, with nerves clearly getting to Patrick as he fails to answer several questions and puts the team in a hole. Brian slowly but surely digs them out of it, getting into his swing as he answers question after question. As the match <b>is</b> <b>heating</b> <b>up</b> and Brian's team has the momentum, Brian inadvertently gives the answer to the card that he had previously seen even before quizmaster Bamber Gascoigne has even begun to read the question (he has merely introduced it as [...] "an astronomy question"). Realising that Brian has seen the cards, Gascoigne suspends the match and Brian's team is disqualified.|$|E
