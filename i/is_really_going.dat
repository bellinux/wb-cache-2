25|$|Fairly {{straightforward}} statistics provide {{estimates of}} whether associations between genes on lists {{are greater than}} what one would expect by chance. These statistics are interesting, even if they represent a substantial oversimplification of what <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> on. Here is an example. Suppose there are 10,000 genes in an experiment, only 50 (0.5%) of which play a known role in making cholesterol. The experiment identifies 200 regulated genes. Of those, 40 (20%) {{turn out to be}} on a list of cholesterol genes as well. Based on the overall prevalence of the cholesterol genes (0.5%) one expects an average of 1 cholesterol gene for every 200 regulated genes, that is, 0.005 times 200. This expectation is an average, so one expects to see more than one some of the time. The question becomes how often we would see 40 instead of 1 due to pure chance.|$|E

[...] "When we did Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge, we didn't fit in," [...] he said. [...] "There was a little less screaming and a little more melody, but it was still us. Never was it a case of, 'Don't put that melody there because Hardcore Chuck, who took me to my first show at Fairfield American Legion Hall, <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> to be bummed at me.'

500|$|In April 2016, {{on moving}} the {{universe}} to Phase Four and reflecting on the first three, Feige said, [...] "I {{think there will be}} a finality to moments of Phase Three, as well as new beginnings that will mark a different, a [...] different, a distinctively different chapter in what will someday be a complete first saga made up of three phases." [...] Joe Russo added, [...] "You build things up and people enjoy the experiences you've built up. But then you kind of reach an apex or you reach a climax, a moment where you go, 'This structure <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> to start to be repetitious if we do this again, so what do we do now?' So now, you deconstruct it. We're in the deconstruction phase with [...] and leading into , which are the culmination films."

500|$|Rex Britten, {{portrayed by}} Dylan Minnette, is Michael's son who is {{featured}} in Michael's [...] "green reality". Green is Rex's favorite color. He is a teenage school student. Outside of school, Rex claims {{he is going}} to the beach, although he <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> to his best friend Cole's house to work on a motorbike with him. Like Hannah, Rex is also very emotional, and often gets angry, due to Hannah's death in the crash. He kept a tennis racket to remain, and make him deal with Hannah's death. However, Cole accidentally broke it, Rex fights with him because of this. He later apologizes to him. He hates [...] "cereal and soda night" [...] because Michael doesn not cook [...] "actual food" [...] for dinner. Rex has an aunt named Carol, who is mentioned in [...] "Two Birds", in Michael's [...] "green reality". She wants {{to spend more time with}} Rex since the crash.|$|E

A. A. Gill for The Times recommended that people should [...] "eat here at least once to find out what <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> on in your mouth". Also in 2005, German food critic Wolfram Siebeck visited the restaurant complained of the delays in service and of several of the dishes, described the mustard ice cream in a red cabbage gazpacho soup as a [...] "fart of nothingness", while chef Nico Ladenis said of the restaurant, [...] "Someone who makes egg and bacon ice cream is hailed a genius. If you vomit and make ice cream out of it, are you a star?" [...] Tony Naylor of The Guardian enjoyed his trip to the restaurant in 2008, and afterwards criticised those who thought that spending £323.13 on a meal for two at lunchtime was too much.|$|E

500|$|Rachel informs Monica (Courteney Cox) {{that she}} has managed to find two male nurses who {{would be willing to}} go out on a date with either of them. Monica declines the offer at first, not wanting to {{jeopardize}} her secret relationship with Chandler (Matthew Perry) but when he assumes she is willing to go out with nurse Dan, Monica decides to date him after all. Chandler in response asks a female nurse {{to go out on a}} date with him; she declines immediately, adding to his embarrassment. After Phoebe gives birth, Chandler approaches Monica in a hallway to ask if she <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> to date Dan. She replies to him that since both of them are just [...] "goofing around", she figured why not [...] "goof around" [...] with Dan too; Chandler asks if Monica had checked up the term in the dictionary, noting the technical definition is “two friends who care a lot about each other, and have amazing sex, and just want to spend more time together”. Monica, smitten by Chandler's words, kisses him and goes to call off her date with Dan.|$|E
500|$|Because {{the use of}} {{medicinal}} {{marijuana is}} prominently featured in the episode, Fox had [...] "incredible fears" [...] about it and were very hesitant to have it broadcast. They especially disapproved of {{a scene in which}} Homer smokes marijuana for the first time, since {{they did not want to}} instruct children how to smoke. The staff discussed the scene for a long time with the network until they came up with a compromise. Just before the joint touches Homer's lips, the scene cuts to a psychedelic sequence that transpires from the joint's tip. Despite their concerns, Jean opined that the network gave the staff a [...] "pretty good amount" [...] of creative freedom with the episode. [...] " [...] obviously, the network didn't want us glorifying casual marijuana use", he said in an interview with the music magazine Relix. [...] " [...] like we usually do, we look at everything from two sides and it's supposed to be a thoughtful look at a serious thing". Despite the modification of the scene, the network and the series' staff members were still worried about how the episode would be received. [...] "Weeks before it aired, we were going 'This <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> to kill everything...'", Jean said in the episode's DVD commentary.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, {{thanks to}} Kenny, {{the two men}} are mistakenly {{diagnosed}} to have [...] "pinkeye", but they turn into zombies and go around biting other people, turning them into zombies. Back home, Chef, who sees the outbreak on TV, tries to warn both the doctor and Mayor McDaniels (who is having sex with Officer Barbrady), but his pleas are ignored. The boys go trick-or-treating (Kyle now dressed as a vampire), not noticing the outbreak, and abandon Kenny, who continues to eat people. They arrive at Chef's home, and Chef tells them what <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> on before taking them to the morgue to stop the outbreak. After discovering the hotline number on the Worcestershire sauce bottle, the boys and Chef are attacked by the zombies with Chef becoming the next victim and dancing with other zombies. Stan and Cartman kill the other zombies with chainsaws and Stan hesitates to kill a zombified Wendy. After Kyle discovers he has to kill the original zombie (after being told complicatedly by the hotline lady), he slices Kenny in half, killing him. The spell is broken and all the zombies turn back to normal. Stan makes up with Wendy and they are about to kiss but he ends up puking on her, leaving her disgusted.|$|E

500|$|Damon Wise of Empire called Changeling [...] "flawless", and McCarthy {{said it was}} [...] "emotionally {{powerful}} and stylistically sure-handed". He stated that Changeling was a more complex and wide-ranging work than Eastwood's Mystic River, saying the characters and social commentary were brought into the story with an [...] "almost breathtaking deliberation". He said that as [...] "a sorrowful critique of the city's political culture", Changeling sat {{in the company of}} films such as Chinatown and L.A. Confidential. Honeycutt said the film added a [...] "forgotten chapter to the L.A. noir" [...] of those films, and that Eastwood's melodic score contributed to an evocation of a city and a period [...] "undergoing galvanic changes". Honeycutt said, [...] " [...] small-town feel to the street and sets... captures a society resistant to seeing what <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> on". Séguret said that while Changeling had few defects, it was mystifying that other critics had such effusive praise for it. Denby said it was beautifully made, but that it shared the chief fault of other [...] "righteously indignant" [...] films in congratulating the audience for feeling contempt for the [...] "long-discredited" [...] attitudes depicted. Ansen concluded that the story was told in such a sure manner that only a hardened cynic would be left unmoved by the [...] "haunting, sorrowful saga".|$|E
500|$|Eric Goldman of IGN {{scored the}} episode an 8.5 out of 10, {{indicating}} a [...] "great" [...] episode, highlighting the reunion {{of the six}} original team members and their evolved dynamic, despite {{what he called a}} [...] "contrived" [...] set up for that situation. He felt that using the characters of List and Hill to tie the series into Age of Ultron was [...] "the right way" [...] to tie the two together, and was also positive of the character beats for Simmons and Palamas. Goldman also made special mention of Tancharoen's direction of the one-shot fight, though he felt that Tancharoen's May vs. Agent 33 fight from [...] "Face My Enemy" [...] was the superior sequence, and of the visual effects for the shooting down of the Bus. The A.V. Clubs Oliver Sava graded [...] "The Dirty Half Dozen" [...] a 'B+', also noting that [...] "has to take some shortcuts to reunite the original team, but the momentum picks up considerably once everyone is in the same room". Discussing the changed in the main characters {{from the start of the}} series, Sava particularly noted the development of Skye into [...] "kick-ass Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.", and praised Tancharoen as [...] "the one director on this series that <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> out of his way to create memorable action sequences". Sava called the Age of Ultron tie-in [...] "overt", with Raina's clairvoyance [...] "a convenient plot device to put certain pieces in place", but ultimately felt that [...] "those big-screen connections don’t interrupt the focus on relationships".|$|E
2500|$|Rubio's {{reviews from}} {{students}} have been positive, even from students who disagree with him politically. He generally gives the impression of being unbiased and nonpartisan, and when offering his own opinion identifies it as such.

2500|$|Although {{originally}} {{set to be}} {{filmed in}} Jakarta, permission to film in Indonesia was denied, so {{the bulk of the}} film was shot in the Philippines. Death threats against Weir and Gibson from Muslims who believed the film would be anti-Islam forced the production to move to Australia. Gibson downplayed the death threats, saying, [...] "It wasn't really that bad. We got a lot of death threats to be sure, but I just assumed that when there are so many, it must mean nothing <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> to happen. I mean, if they meant to kill us, why send a note?" ...|$|E

[...] She chides her sons, particularly Biff, for not helping Willy more, and supports Willy lovingly even though Willy sometimes treats her poorly, ignoring her opinions over those of others. She is the first to realize that Willy is contemplating suicide {{at the beginning of the}} play, and urges Biff to make something of himself, while expecting Happy to help Biff do so.|$|E
2500|$|In present day, Linden (Mireille Enos) and Holder (Joel Kinnaman) {{look for}} Jamie at Richmond's {{election}} rally. Gwen (Kristin Lehman) tells them he is late, as is Richmond. Holder {{calls in a}} search for Jamie's campaign car. In the parking garage, Gwen tells them that a driver dropped Richmond off at Jamie's grandfather's house. At the house, Jamie finds his grandfather, Ted Wright (Marcel Maillard), talking to Richmond. As Jamie leaves with Richmond, Ted mentions figuring out where Jamie was the night [...] "that girl got killed". Jamie brings Richmond back to the office and informs him that Mayor Adams is conceding. After Richmond demands to know what <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> on, Jamie admits he arranged to plant the Indian bones at the waterfront construction site to hurt Adams' campaign. Chief Jackson and Michael Ames helped and, in exchange, Jamie promised that Richmond would approve the construction of a casino on the site. When Richmond asks what happened to Rosie, Jamie admits to an [...] "accident".|$|E

2500|$|Weill {{also contributed}} {{greatly to the}} Verfremdungseffekt by his music. Often the music would {{intentionally}} be unsuited for the onstage action, preventing the audience from getting carried away by the onstage emotion. For example, in act 2, scene 13, the hurricane has spared Mahagonny, and the people feel free to do whatever makes them happy. For Jacob Schmidt, this means eating a lot. He sings of how he has not had his fill yet with such lines as [...] "Not enough by half! / I may eat myself for supper." [...] And yet, the music betrays the seeming unbridled ecstasy of Jacob; he is singing to a discordant melody, and the accordion accompaniment sounds stark and rather macabre. The intention is that the audience realizes that all this is very wrong; Jacob claims {{to be having a}} great time, but the music suggests all may not be well, thus the audience needs to pay attention and think about what <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> on. To further this point, Jacob then dies and the chorus sings of how happy he was while dragging out his corpse. This last twist of welcoming death is unexpected and contributes to the alienation.|$|E
2500|$|When Edmund {{reveals that}} he has tuberculosis, Mary refuses to believe it, and {{attempts}} to discredit Dr. Hardy, due to her inability to face the reality and most importantly {{the severity of the}} situation. She accuses Edmund of attempting to get more attention by blowing everything out of proportion. In retaliation, Edmund reminds his mother that her own father died of tuberculosis, and then, before exiting, he adds {{how difficult it is to}} have a [...] "dope fiend for a mother." [...] By herself, Mary admits that she needs more morphine and hopes that someday she will “accidentally” overdose, because she knows that if she did so on purpose, the Virgin would never forgive her. When James comes back with more alcohol he notes that there was evidence that Jamie had attempted to pick the locks to the whiskey cabinet in the cellar, as he has done before. Mary ignores this and bursts out that she is afraid that Edmund is going to die. She also confides to James that Edmund does not love her because of her drug problem. When James attempts to console her, Mary again rues having given birth to Edmund, who appears to have been conceived to replace a baby they had lost before Edmund’s birth. When Cathleen announces dinner, Mary indicates that she is not hungry and is going to bed. James goes in to dinner all alone, knowing that Mary <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> upstairs to get more drugs.|$|E
