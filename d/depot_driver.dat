50|$|In 2002 an {{automatic}} train operation (ATO) system was added, which controls {{the speed of the}} train for the driver and ensures that all trains will stop when arriving at every station. Under normal circumstances, most trains are operated in ATO mode except for scenarios such as operation of trains in and out of train <b>depots,</b> <b>driver</b> training, or at times when the ATO system fails to function properly.|$|R

Artists included Bachman-Turner Overdrive, Parliament, General Johnson and the Chairmen of the Board. Studios for WRQK and WPET were on Meadowview Road near the Greensboro <b>Depot.</b> <b>Drivers</b> passing by could see the DJs through the three glass walls, and some even yelled their requests to the DJs. Battleground Avenue had billboards showing the DJs. At one time the station's name was K-99. WRQK leaned toward classic rock in 1980, when it was also called [...] "Heart of Gold". Later the name became [...] "99-RQK." ...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} an operational routing problem {{to decide the}} daily routes of logging trucks in forestry. The industrial problem is difficult and includes aspects such as pickup and delivery with split pickups, multiple products, time windows, several time periods, multiple <b>depots,</b> <b>driver</b> changes and a heterogeneous truck fleet. In addition, the problem size is large and the solution time limited. We describe a two-phase solution approach which transforms the problem into a vehicle routing problem with time windows. In the first phase, we solve an LP problem {{in order to find}} a destination of flow from supply points to demand points. Based on this solution, we create transport nodes each of which defines the origin(s) and destination for a full truckload. In phase two, we make use of a standard tabu search method to combine these transport nodes, which can be considered to be customers in vehicle routing problems, into actual routes. The standard tabu search method is extended to consider some new features. The solution approach is implemented as part of a newly developed decision support system and we report on tests made on a set of industrial cases from major forest companies in Sweden.

40|$|Due to its {{environmentally}} sustainable and energy-saving characteristics, railway transportation nowadays plays {{a fundamental}} role in delivering passengers and goods. Emerged {{in the area}} of transportation planning, the crew (workforce) sizing problem and the crew scheduling problem have been attached great importance by the railway industry and the scientific community. In this paper, we aim to solve the two problems by proposing a novel two-stage optimization approach {{in the context of the}} electric multiple units (EMU) <b>depot</b> shunting <b>driver</b> assignment problem. Given a predefined depot shunting schedule, the first stage of the approach focuses on determining an optimal size of shunting drivers. While the second stage is formulated as a bi-objective optimization model, in which we comprehensively consider the objectives of minimizing the total walking distance and maximizing the workload balance. Then we combine the normalized normal constraint method with a modified Pareto filter algorithm to obtain Pareto solutions for the bi-objective optimization problem. Furthermore, we conduct a series of numerical experiments to demonstrate the proposed approach. Based on the computational results, the regression analysis yield a driver size predictor and the sensitivity analysis give some interesting insights that are useful for decision makers...|$|R
50|$|Within {{the main}} office {{building}} is located Selhurst traincrew <b>depot,</b> where many <b>drivers</b> and conductors are based. The depot has extensive stabling sidings, the three main groups of which are known as: Chalk, AC (which were so named because that was where the trains of the former AC system were stabled) and North. There is a large maintenance shed, an AC test rig (for dual voltage units equipped with pantographs), a train wash plant, and a cleaning shed. At the north east corner of the site near to Norwood junction station is the smaller Norwood drivers' depot, and beside it the diesel fuelling point. Selhurst is unusual in that the maximum speed within the depot is 15 mph rather than the usual 5 mph, and signalled train movements are permissive.|$|R
2500|$|On 26 October 2015, about 41,000 commuters were {{affected}} during morning peak hour when a power fault crippled the whole line from Punggol to Harbourfront stations. This {{is the first}} time that both the north- and south-bound service are affected which resulted in the mobilization of about 100 free shuttle buses across the NEL. The Alstom Metropolis C751C train was returning to the Sengkang <b>Depot</b> when the <b>driver</b> saw sparks from above the train and stopped the train [...] at a stretch where the mainline and depot catenary system wires overlap. This resulted in arching between the wires of the mainline and the depot. This caused the catenary system wires to melt and eventually snap. As a precautionary measure, SBS Transit has marked non-stopping areas at all overlapping zones and reduced electrical voltage difference between the catenary system wires at the overlap point, in case trains stop at this stretch.|$|R
40|$|Distribution {{networks}} of many logistics service providers have evolved from single-depot to complex, dynamic multidepot networks. In a single-depot network, the deliveries from each depot {{are planned for}} that <b>depot</b> only, and <b>drivers</b> {{return to the starting}} depot to pick up each new order. In a multidepot network, the deliveries from multiple depots can be planned simultaneously; therefore, a logistics service provider can efficiently combine its resources, thus reducing its labor and transport costs. However, an increasing emphasis on reliability, customization, and flexibility is affecting the logistics structures. This paper describes the shift from single-depot planning to multidepot planning for Nabuurs B. V., a large Benelux logistics service provider that implemented a centralized, automated multidepot planning process throughout its organization. We developed a simulation model to evaluate system performance and to address performance challenges. In this paper, we discuss the results of extensive simulation tests and the specific recommendations that Nabuurs B. V. management implemented...|$|R
30|$|The Tyne & Wear Metro {{operates}} {{on its own}} infrastructure {{as well as some}} sections using shared track with Network Rail. Thus there is a variety of signalling used, all fixed block. Most of the system has simple two-aspect signalling with occasional fixed distants and three-aspect signals. However, the Pelaw to South Hylton route uses Network Rail infrastructure and subsequently utilises standard mainline four-aspect signalling with yellow and double yellow signals. As of May 2014, signals using LED technology were only installed on the section shared with Network Rail {{as well as at the}} <b>depot.</b> The Metro <b>drivers</b> do not have the benefit of automatic warning system (AWS) or train protection and warning system (TPWS) available to the mainline train drivers on the same route. The automatic train protection (ATP) system controls overspeeding and signal passed at danger (SPaD). However, the speed control infrastructure is at certain locations only. The ATP system used is the Indusi system which is a version of German mainline railway warning and supervision system Induktives Sicherungssystem.|$|R
5000|$|In 1937 it {{had become}} obvious the {{original}} suspension system was unreliable and ineffective. After many trials it was replaced in the 1940 production run, after the 1540 vehicles had been built with the original design, by an AMX system using twelve wheels fitted with six vertical springs (AMX was the new name of the military division of Renault nationalised on 2 December 1936). About {{the same time the}} radio and a much more powerful gun were introduced. The long-barrelled L/35 37 mm SA38 in the adapted cast APX-R1 turret (with L767 sight) gave it an effective anti-tank capacity: 40 mm at 500 metres. The new combination was named the Char léger modèle 1935 R modifié 1939 but is more commonly known as the Renault R40. It was delivered in time to equip one battalion of the Polish 10th Armoured Cavalry Brigade of the Polish Army in France and the last two French tank battalions to be formed. It was intended to fit the R 40 with the welded FCM turret {{in the second half of}} 1940, while refitting all existing R 35s with the longer SA 38 gun and bringing R 40 production levels up to 120 per month for the duration of the war. From January 1940, the vehicles of light tank unit commanders were gradually uparmed with the longer gun; but as absolute priority was given to tanks serving in armoured divisions, which were of the Hotchkiss type, of the 273 platoon, company and battalion commanders eligible in Renault units, only a few if any received this [...] "R 39". The only official possible exception to the rule that Hotchkiss tanks had to be modified first was made on 12 February 1940 when it was ordered to replace the turrets of 24 Infantry tanks, without specifying the type, present in <b>depot</b> or <b>driver</b> schools in order to obtain older turrets to be fitted on R 35 export vehicles. In the same period a crash programme was executed to produce 200,000 armour piercing rounds per month for the shorter gun, as there had been only minimal stocks of this ammunition type.|$|R
40|$|Degree of Bachelor of Science in Information Technology for Management StudiesIGIM Disanayake {{developed}} a windows based Depot Management Information System for Matara Bus Depot. The {{objective of this}} project is to develop an windows based Depot Management Information System among the SLTB bus depot in Sri Lanka. The Matara bus depot was the nationalized enterprise which handled all public bus transport in Sri Lanka since 1958. Number of employees work in Matara bus <b>depot</b> such as <b>Drivers,</b> Conductors, Administration staff and other workers. Other workers mean cleaners, maintain workers and security people. Matara bus depot comprises 80 buses & 240 employees. These 240 employees are divided in to 4 sectors (Drivers, Conductors, Administration staff and other workers). Matara bus depot has manual payroll system and they pay salary beginning of the months. As well as they prepare daily income of all buses in the depot. Daily income of all buses is different day by day. SLTB originally painted its buses red and blue, and the second-hand London Transport which was {{the backbone of the}} modern fleet just needed to be half-painted in blue, saving on costs. When Aluminum bus bodies became the norm, large areas of the surface were left unpainted, with just red front and back and blue strips down the side, in order to save money. The aim is to develop the Depot Management Information System for bus depot in Matara. The main objective of developing the Depot Management information System is to have a quality and feasible information system which is to improve the current system that bus depot is using...|$|R
