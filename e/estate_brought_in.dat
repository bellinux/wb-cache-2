50|$|Webster's <b>estate</b> <b>brought</b> {{a lawsuit}} <b>in</b> Maryland's U.S. District Court against the National Football League. The estate contended that Webster was {{disabled}} {{at the time}} of his retirement, and was owed $1.142 million in disability payments under the NFL's retirement plan. On April 26, 2005, a federal judge ruled that the NFL benefits plan owed Webster's estate $1.18 million in benefits. With the addition of interest and fees, that amount was estimated to exceed $1.60 million. The NFL appealed the ruling. On December 13, 2006, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Richmond, Virginia, affirmed the Baltimore federal judge's 2005 ruling that the league's retirement plan must pay benefits reserved for players whose disabilities began while they were still playing football.|$|R

50|$|The early {{phase of}} „feudalization“ {{together}} with the acquisition of wide real <b>estates,</b> <b>brought</b> huge amounts of capital to certain families.

The leading stratum was obviously involved in trading very heavily, {{much more than the}} nobility of the neighbouring mainland.|$|R

50|$|The film is {{noteworthy}} as a precedent in copyright law. The movie was made without {{the permission of}} the author's estate, which was common practice at that time. The screenwriter, Gene Gauntier, remarked in her 1928 autobiography how the film industry at that time infringed upon everything. As a result of the production of Ben Hur, Harper & Brothers and the author's <b>estate</b> <b>brought</b> suit against Kalem Studios, the Motion Picture Patents Company, and Gauntier for copyright infringement. The United States Supreme Court ultimately ruled against the film company in 1911.

With the backing of the former Aberdeen District Council (see Aberdeen City Council), the Secretary of State for Scotland and supported financially by Ashdale Land and Property Company Ltd., the new settlement of Westhill was created upon the old farming land. Since construction of the first houses in 1968, Westhill has undergone a gradual expansion, much of which is tied to the North East's oil and gas economy.
