50|$|Once a {{child has}} been born {{as a result of}} a {{surrogacy}} agreement the child will then need to be formally adopted by the intended parents. The Adoption Act 1955 governs this and deals with matters such as whose consent is required and who are the legal parents.If a child was born overseas and was brought to New Zealand a temporary visa must be granted to the child and the habitual residence must then decided by the court. If the court concludes that the child is a <b>habitual</b> <b>resident</b> of New Zealand the Adoption Act 1955 applies, however if it concludes that it is the resident of another State then the Adoption (Intercountry) Act 1997 will apply to the situation. The Court of Appeal set a test whereby the habitual residence of a child could be decided upon. Broadly, test is to look at the intentions of the parents and where they intended the child to be residence of.|$|E

50|$|The {{remoteness}} {{ensured that}} the area remained strongly Scottish Gaelic speaking until the mid 20th century. In the 1881 census, around 90% of the population were able to speak Gaelic and over a third unable to speak English.

60|$|There {{remained}} the schoolmaster--probably now a reverend parson. But {{he could not}} possibly hunt up such a respectable man just yet; so raw and unpolished was his condition, so precarious were his fortunes. Thus he still remained in loneliness. Although people moved round him he virtually saw none. Not as yet having mingled with the active life of the place it was largely non-existent to him. But the saints and prophets in the window-tracery, the paintings in the galleries, the statues, the busts, the gargoyles, the corbel-heads--these seemed to breathe his atmosphere. Like all newcomers to a spot on which the past is deeply graven he heard that past announcing itself with an emphasis altogether unsuspected by, and even incredible to, the <b>habitual</b> <b>residents.</b>|$|R
