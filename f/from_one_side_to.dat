5|$|In the past, some palaeontologists, notably Robert Bakker, {{have speculated}} that the plates may have been mobile to some degree, {{although}} others disagree. Bakker suggested the plates were the bony cores of pointed horn-covered plates that a Stegosaurus could flip <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> another to present a predator {{with an array of}} spikes and blades that would impede it from closing sufficiently to attack the Stegosaurus effectively. The plates would naturally sag to the sides of the Stegosaurus, the length of the plates reflecting the width of the animal at that point along its spine. His reasoning for these plates to be covered in horn is that the surface fossilized plates have a resemblance to the bony cores of horns in other animals known or thought to bear horns, and his reasoning for the plates to be defensive in nature is that the plates had insufficient width for them to stand erect easily in such a manner as to be useful in display without continuous muscular effort. S. stenops also had disk-shaped plates on its hips.|$|E

25|$|When open, doors admit people, animals, {{ventilation}} or light. The door is used {{to control}} the physical atmosphere within a space by enclosing the air drafts, so that interiors may be more effectively heated or cooled. When closed, a door normally impedes the transfer of air <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> the other. Similar structures that do allow air to be transferred through some form of a grillwork are called gates.|$|E

Horses do not need lengthy times to raise steam in the boiler, and can also take short cuts <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>siding</b> <b>to</b> another. At Hamley Bridge tenders were called for the supply of horses, in part because normal railway staff lacked horse handling skills.|$|R

25|$|To begin {{making a}} rug, one needs a {{foundation}} consisting of warps and wefts: Warps are strong, thick threads of cotton, wool or silk which {{run through the}} length of the rug. Similar threads which pass under and over the warps <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> the other are called wefts. The warps {{on either side of the}} rug are normally plied into one or more strings of varying thickness that are overcast to form the selvedge.|$|E
25|$|A funnel {{water slide}} {{requires}} riders {{to sit in}} a 2 or 4 seater round tube. Riders drop from inside a tunnel out into the ride's main element shaped like a funnel on its side. Riders oscillate <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> the other until they exit through the back of the funnel and into a splash pool. The most common type of funnel is the ProSlide Tornado which is installed at almost 60 locations around the world dating back to 2003. In 2010, WhiteWater West began developing a competing product known as the Abyss, utilizing a raft that holds up to six riders.|$|E
25|$|Another notable {{feature in}} some stories {{is that the}} arms {{are said to be}} {{connected}} to each other through the torso and can slide <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> the other. While they are primarily water creatures, they do on occasion venture onto land. When they do, the plate can be covered with a metal cap for protection. In some versions of the legends, kappa spend spring and summer in the water, {{and the rest of the}} year in the mountains as Yama-no-Kami (山の神, “mountain gods”).

25|$|The {{first episode}} {{took place in}} 1389–90, during the delta campaign. For months, Razadarit's forces could not {{overcome}} the well fortified cities of Myaungmya and Bassein (Pathein). The Hanthawaddy command then devised a plan to lure the Bassein navy out of their entrenched position to an area downstream at Pan-Hlaing. There, the Hanthawaddy navy had planted stakes across the river <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> another with enough space that only small war boats of Hanthawaddy could pass through. The plan was to attack the larger Bassein boats as they rammed into the stakes. The task of luring the Bassein navy fell to Lagun Ein. The king himself selected Lagun Ein to lead the mission.|$|E
25|$|The {{inscriptions}} on the stele are badly preserved. They {{fill the}} negative {{spaces in the}} scenes and run continuously <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> the other. The text is written in Sumerian cuneiform script. From these inscriptions, {{it is known that}} the stele was commissioned by Eannatum, an ensi or ruler of Lagash around 2460 BC. On it, he describes a conflict with Umma over a tract of agricultural land located between the two city-states. The conflict ends in a battle in which Eannatum, described as the beloved of the god Ningirsu, triumphs over Umma. After the battle, the leader of Umma swears that he will not transgress into the territory of Lagash again upon penalty of divine punishment.|$|E

His primary residence was the palace on the Neva, which was so large that his brother Grand Duke Sergei, who lived with him, used a bicycle to go <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> the other.

25|$|An air-wedge {{shearing}} interferometer {{is described}} in and was employed in set of experiments described in. This interferometer consists of two optical glass wedges (~2-5deg), pushed together and then slightly separated <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> create a thin air-gap wedge. This air-gap wedge has a unique property- it is very thin (micrometer scale) and it has perfect flatness (~λ/10). There are four nearly equal intensity Fresnel reflections (~4% for refraction coefficient 1.5) from the air-wedge interferometer (Fig.1): 1-2 from the first glass wedge, and 3-4 from the second one. The angle between beams 1-2 and 3-4 is non adjustable and depends only on the glass wedge. The angle between beams 2-3 is easily adjusted by varying the air-wedge angle. The distance between the air-wedge and an image plane should be long enough to spatially separate reflections 1 from 2 and 3 from 4. The overlap of beams 2 and 3 in the image plane creates an interferogram.|$|E
25|$|In {{the earlier}} stage of rib vaulting, the arched ribs {{consisted}} of independent or separate voussoirs {{down to the}} springing; the difficulty, however, of working the ribs separately led to two other important changes: (1) {{the lower part of}} the transverse diagonal and wall ribs were all worked out of one stone; and (2) the lower horizontal, constituting what is known as the tas-de-charge or solid springer. The tas-de-charge, or solid springer, had two advantages: (1) it enabled the stone courses to run straight through the wall, so as to bond the whole together much better; and (2) it lessened the span of the vault, which then required a centering of smaller dimensions. As soon as the ribs were completed, the web or stone shell of the vault was laid on them. In some English work each course of stone was of uniform height <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> the other; but, as the diagonal rib was longer than either the transverse or wall rib, the courses dipped towards the former, and at the apex of the vault were cut to fit one another. In the early English Gothic period, in consequence of the great span of the vault and the very slight rise or curvature of the web, it was thought better to simplify the construction of the web by introducing intermediate ribs between the wall rib and the diagonal rib and between the diagonal and the transverse ribs; and in order to meet the thrust of these intermediate ribs a ridge rib was required, and the prolongation of this rib to the wall rib hid the junction of the web at the summit, which was not always very sightly, and constituted the ridge rib. In France, on the other hand, the web courses were always laid horizontally, and they are therefore of unequal height, increasing towards the diagonal rib. Each course also was given a slight rise in the centre, so as to increase its strength; this enabled the French masons to dispense with the intermediate rib, which was not introduced by them till the 15th century, and then more as a decorative than a constructive feature, as the domical form given to the French web rendered unnecessary the ridge rib, which, with some few exceptions, exists only in England. In both English and French vaulting centering was rarely required for the building of the web, a template (Fr. cerce) being employed to support the stones of each ring until it was complete. In Italy, Germany and Spain the French method of building the web was adopted, with horizontal courses and a domical form. Sometimes, in the case of comparatively narrow compartments, and more especially in clerestories, the wall rib was stilted, and this caused a peculiar twisting of the web, where the springing of the wall rib is at K: to these twisted surfaces the term ploughshare vaulting is given.|$|E

50|$|The 3-2/2-3 clave {{concept and}} {{terminology}} {{was developed in}} New York City during the 1940s by Bauza while he was the music director of Machito and his Afro-Cubans. Bauzá was a master at moving the song <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> of clave <b>to</b> the other. The following melodic excerpt is taken from the opening verses of “Que vengan los rumberos” by Machito and his Afro-Cubans. Notice how the melody goes <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> of clave <b>to</b> the other and then back again. A measure of 2/4 moves the chord progression from the two-side (2-3), to the three-side (3-2). Later, another measure of 2/4 moves {{the start of the}} chord progression back to two-side (2-3).|$|R
500|$|The raised {{forecastle}} and {{the prominent}} sheer and flare {{of the bow}} ensured that the Chacal-class ships were good seaboats, but they proved to be topheavy with poor lateral stability despite [...] bilge keels.

50|$|The game {{is divided}} into four stages or chapters, each {{featuring}} several levels. After completing a level the player will be shown a map which displays the player's current location and the paths they can take. Most of the levels are linear side-scrolling segments where the player must simply walk <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> the other while fighting every enemy who gets in the way. Other levels are dungeon mazes in which the player must figure out the correct path to the goal while avoiding traps.

If unable to rise, some have survived—with medical care—as long as 14 days and were ultimately able to get back on their feet. Appropriate medical treatment for a downer cow to prevent further injury includes rolling <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> the other every three hours, careful and frequent feeding of small amounts of fodder, and access to clean water.|$|E
500|$|... "Dream Scene" [...] is a {{combination}} of segments that Harrison edited together. Along with [...] "Ski-ing", it is the only track on the album that combines Indian and Western music.
