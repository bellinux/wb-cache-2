50|$|Denman {{was known}} as a {{criminal}} law reformer. He <b>gave</b> <b>evidence,</b> however, <b>to</b> the Royal Commission on Capital Punishment 1864-66, supporting the retention of public executions. In parliament he interested himself in the reform of the law of evidence in criminal trials, and on 20 June 1860 moved the second reading of the Felony and Misdemeanor Bill, which aimed to assimilate proceedings for a criminal trial to those current in civil trials (at nisi prius). The bill passed the Commons, but was abandoned after alteration in the Lords. Five years later, 22 February 1865, he successfully carried through a similar measure, the Felony and Misdemeanor Evidence and Practice Act. The Evidence Further Amendment Act of 1869, popularly known as Denman's Act, was his personal initiative. It meant that witnesses professing no religious belief were able to affirm in courts of justice, and parties previously <b>incompetent</b> were able <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>evidence.</b>|$|R
