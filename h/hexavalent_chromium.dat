40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to provide information on the {{physical and chemical properties}} of groundwater in Jimeta-Yola area in order to appreciate the impacts of indiscriminate waste disposal practice on the quality of groundwater and to discuss its suitability for human consumption from the water quality index values. This has been determined by collecting groundwater samples from hand-dug wells and boreholes in the dry season and rainy season periods and subjected to physicochemical analysis. The results indicate that electrical conductivity (EC), chloride, nitrate and dissolved oxygen exceeded World Health Organization (WHO) standards in the dry season and chloride, nitrate, dissolved oxygen, total hardness and <b>chromium</b> <b>hexavalent</b> exceeded WHO standards in the rainy season. Spatial distribution of EC, chloride, nitrate and <b>chromium</b> <b>hexavalent</b> in the dry and rainy season indicated that the sources of these contaminants result from point sources such as house hold solid wastes, sewage effluents and wastewater. The overall water quality index (WQI) value in the dry season was 96. 4 which indicate good water quality. The overall WQI value in the rainy season was 138. 5 which indicate poor water quality. The high value of WQI {{has been found to be}} mainly from chloride, nitrate, dissolved oxygen, <b>chromium</b> <b>hexavalent</b> and EC. The source of these contaminants is attributed to anthropogenic origin. The study revealed that the water quality is unfit for human consumption without treatment...|$|R

5|$|Chromium, arsenic, cadmium, mercury, {{and lead}} have the {{greatest}} potential to cause harm on account of their extensive use, the toxicity {{of some of their}} combined or elemental forms, and their widespread distribution in the environment. <b>Hexavalent</b> <b>chromium,</b> for example, is highly toxic as are mercury vapour and many mercury compounds. These five elements have a strong affinity for sulfur; in the human body they usually bind, via thiol groups (–SH), to enzymes responsible for controlling the speed of metabolic reactions. The resulting sulfur-metal bonds inhibit the proper functioning of the enzymes involved; human health deteriorates, sometimes fatally. Chromium (in its hexavalent form) and arsenic are carcinogens; cadmium causes a degenerative bone disease; and mercury and lead damage the central nervous system.|$|E
5|$|In the European Union, the {{directive}} on the Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (see RoHS) bans mercury from certain electrical and electronic products, and limits {{the amount of}} mercury in other products to less than 1000 ppm. There are restrictions for mercury concentration in packaging (the limit is 100 ppm for sum of mercury, lead, <b>hexavalent</b> <b>chromium</b> and cadmium) and batteries (the limit is 5 ppm). In July 2007, the European Union also banned mercury in non-electrical measuring devices, such as thermometers and barometers. The ban applies to new devices only, and contains exemptions for the health care sector and a two-year grace period for manufacturers of barometers.|$|E

5|$|In a study {{published}} in 2007, the National Institutes of Health deemed <b>hexavalent</b> <b>chromium</b> VI (chromium-6) to be a likely carcinogen in lab animals when consumed in large quantities in drinking water. Prior to the NIH study, a World Health Organization study found that chromium-6 was a likely cause of lung cancer when inhaled by humans. In 2010, test results released from a California non-profit group known as the Environmental Working Group showed that Norman's tap water has a chromium-6 concentration level of 12.90 parts per billion (ppb), which was the highest level detected among 35 U.S. cities sampled in the study. The group is studying chromium-6 levels in water supplies in an attempt to prove a causal link between the element's ingestion and cancer in humans, and as a result improve the country's water standards.|$|E

40|$|The marked {{affinity}} of erythrocytes for hexa-valent chromate anion {{was reported}} in 1950 by Gray and Sterling (1). Since then, erythrocytes labeled with radioactive sodium chromate have been used extensively for the determination of erythrocyte survival in vivo (1 - 5) and the deter-mination of blood volume (4 - 6). The anionic <b>hexavalent</b> form of <b>chromium</b> is bound firmly to erythrocytes, is not reutilized, and is excreted mainly in the urine (2). Gray and Sterling sug-gested that the <b>hexavalent</b> form of <b>chromium</b> in the erythrocyte is probably bound to hemoglobin. Recent work, however, has shown {{that not all of}} the chromium is attached to hemoglobin, but that some of it is combined with a substance of low molecular weight, possibly glutathione (7). Ebaugh, Emerson, and Ross (2) showed that small amounts of chromate, up to 9. 5 Fg of chromium per ml of blood, had no apparent effect on the survival of erythrocytes in vivo. When 35 pg per ml of blood was used, however, there was significant hemolysis in vivo during the first 24 hours. Donohue and associates (5) found that amounts below 25 ug of chromium per ml of erythrocytes did not affect erythrocyte survival, but that larger amounts were toxic. In this paper we report the results of studies of the effect of chromate on erythrocyte en-zymes. A marked inhibition of glutathione-re-ductase (GSSG-R) activity was observed.
