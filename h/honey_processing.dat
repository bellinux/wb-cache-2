40|$|Temperature and {{moisture}} in the hive represent optimal conditions for growth and development of microorganisms, which at obtaining energy in fermentation process from sugars in honey and pollen, produce different metabolites, that include ethanol, acetic and lactic acid. In {{the first part of}} our research we wanted to determine which concentrations of acetic and lactic acid the bees consume. We also tried to find out if they are capable of distinguishing ethanol, acetic and lactic acid solutions on the basis of associative learning with proboscis extension reflex. Bees preferred lower concentrations of acetic and lactic acid solutions. The learning turned out to be unsuccessful, because the bees were not able to connect the conditional stimulus with the unconditional stimulus, where the conditional stimulus was ethanol or specific organic acid solution. In {{the second part of the}} experiment, we studied the role of our test substances for <b>honey</b> <b>processing</b> in the hive. The bees tended to open the honeycomb cells with ethanol solution, but they closed those with acetic and lactic acid solutions.

40|$|Honey is rich {{in sugar}} content and {{dominated}} by fructose and glucose that make honey prone to crystallize during storage. Due to honey composition, the anhydrous glass transition temperature of honey is very low that makes honey difficult to dry alone and drying aid or filler is needed to dry honey. Maltodextrin is a common drying aid material used in drying of sugar-rich food. The present study aims to study the <b>processing</b> of <b>honey</b> powder by vacuum drying method {{and the impact of}} drying process and formulation on the stability of honey powder. To achieve the objectives, the series of experiments were done: investigating of maltodextrin DE 10 properties, studying the effect of drying temperature, total solid concentration, DE value, maltodextrin concentration and anti-caking agent on <b>honey</b> powder <b>processing</b> and stability. Maltodextrin provide stable glass compared to lower molecular weight sugars. Dynamic Dew Point Isotherm (DDI) data could be used to determine amorphous content of a system. The area under the first derivative curve from DDI curve is equal to the amount of water needed by amorphous material to crystallize. The drying temperature affected the amorphous content of vacuum-dried honey powder. The higher temperature seemed to result in honey powder with more amorphous component. The ratio of maltodextrin affected more significantly the stability of honey powder compared to the treatments of total solids concentration, DE value and drying temperature. The critical water activity of honey powder was lower than water activity of the equilibrium water content corresponding to BET monolayer water content.

40|$|Goma is {{endowed with}} {{different}} flora and adequate moisture which favors honey production. As a result, bee farmers started producing honey since time immemorial using traditional hives, mostly made of bamboo. Improved hive {{production in the}} Woreda started in 1987 among cooperatives formed during the military regime. In 2007, apiculture was identified {{as one of the}} priority commodity for Goma PLW through participatory priority commodities identification. Major constraints identified were shortage and/or substandard inputs supply, poor quality honey, lack of market, skill and knowledge limitations of bee farmers and technical staff. To address the challenges, value-chain development approach was exercised and in this regard the following developments were recorded. One interested honey shop was upgraded to become an apiculture input shop in Agaro town with financial assistance from OCSSCo/IPMS and technical assistance from the District Livestock Development and Production Agency (LDPA) and IPMS. This input shop supplied considerable inputs to bee farmers who also provide commercial services for their neighbours. One of the important inputs delivered to bee farmers was imported honey extractor but less demand was observed due to its high price. Moreover, one interested honey producers association named Wojin Gudina Honey Producers Association was formed and got legal identity. The association is expected to play market regulatory role, quality assurance, do bulking of member produce as well as non members to maintain bargaining power. About 44 interested farmers and 12 technical staff received skill and knowledge upgrading training and in this regard Jima University (JU) played a big role. More focus was given to transforming traditional to transitional hives (Kenya Top Bar), which was a change for the frame hives (modern hives) which had been introduced before. Twenty interested farmers received 123 transitional hives in Acha Afeta PA through credit and also transitional hive use has shown significant increase within and outside interested farmers in the last two years. To address market constraints, an effort was made to link honey producer with <b>honey</b> <b>processing</b> and export enterprises and in this regard Beza Mar <b>honey</b> <b>processing</b> and exporting enterprise has already started the process to buy Goma honey. Prior to this, an attempt was also made with another commercial processor but was not successful. The effects of various interventions are just emerging and are expected to come to full fruition over time. A household (HH) survey conducted by the project indicated however that adopters of improved apiculture technologies produced in 2008, on average, about birr 3, 400 of honey per year compared to birr 225 by traditional bee keepers. Major lessons learned include that the intervention stimulated increased demand for improved hives and better use of existing hives. As compared to other Districts, involvement of private sector in the sale of accessories for improved bee hives and <b>honey</b> <b>processing</b> is emerging. Most of the honey produced from framed hives is extracted using locally made crude extractors with less or no food graded approval and also less quality honey. These extractors are operated commercially by private individuals, but require further technical support to improve quality. The development of a quality honey market is just emerging, however as indicated in the prices, no clear price incentive for quality honey is observed yet, probably because of the still relatively small volume entering into this market segment. Another indication of the still limited demand for clear honey is the increase in the numbers of traditional hives in the last two to three years. Canadian International Development Agenc...|$|E
30|$|With {{regard to}} cooperatives in Tigray, The survey {{conducted}} by the Agricultural Transformation Agency of Ethiopia has indicated that there were no cooperatives before 1991 (Bernard et al. 2008).

These cooperatives are operating in the production and marketing of honey. Farmer cooperatives possess common apiary sites and individual beehives and obligate members to commit themselves to take care of apiary cites. They also have common processing technology such as honey extractors, masks and smokers that are provided by government or other development partners (e.g. ARDO, REST, and World Vision). The marketing cooperatives not only collect honey from farmers but provide different processing technology to honey producers. They also facilitate access to credit to acquire modern beehives for their members. These cooperatives also supply honey for the other processing companies (Wukiro Mar and Wolela Mar) that are operating at small-scale level.|$|E

This increase is partially the result of government and NGO interventions to supply modern hive technology, training and extension to enhance honey production and quality, as part of a poverty-reduction strategy. Different projects, e.g. ARDO (credit from Dedebit Credit and Saving Institution and other development partners), the Myzegzeg project, World Vision, the Catholic Church and the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahido Church, provided modern beehives and technology to farmers and 35  % of honey producers in the sample received modern technology through this channel.
