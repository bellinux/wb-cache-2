50|$|The M1500, {{while being}} {{comparatively}} low priced {{compared to other}} overseas models, has been judged {{to have all the}} delicacy and robustness one would expect from Japanese <b>engineering.</b> <b>Spare</b> parts have also sold fairly well, however starting with the incursion of Remington into the Japanese domestic market, foreign companies with stronger brand recognition and more competitive prices have caused M1500 sales to become sluggish. For this reason, more than 95% of Howa's M1500 are produced in stripped down form for overseas export.|$|R

40|$|AbstractCompound {{semiconductor}} equipment manufacturers are well represented in this year’s VLSI customer satisfaction survey. Conducted annually, the survey looks at equipment performance and customer service, and asks semiconductor manufacturing equipment users to rank suppliers on a 10 point scale. Equipment performance {{is measured in}} terms of: build quality, cost of ownership, uptime, software, usable throughput, quality of results, and product performance. For customer service, the measures are: process support, field <b>engineering</b> support, <b>spares</b> support, support after sales, technical leadership in the supplier’s field and the supplier’s overall commitment to supporting its customers’ needs.

50|$|Born in 1883, the {{eleventh}} {{son of a}} Wolverhampton draper, Cox left school at thirteen but chose to study electrical <b>engineering</b> in his <b>spare</b> time, and through a succession of jobs, earned himself the post of Engineer at a Wolverhampton power station {{by the age of}} eighteen. Deciding that anyone who could put electricity into peoples homes would become rich, Cox was determined to be just that, and moved to the post of Assistant Engineer at Leamington, and from there to Ryde Corporation on the Isle of Wight. In doing so he learned the art of salesmanship, selling electrical power installation to the inhabitants of Ryde.|$|R
5000|$|Born in Charleston, Arkansas on February 10, 1880, Vincent {{came from}} a {{promising}} lineage for his chosen career. His maternal grandfather had been the Union Army's director of railroad design and engineering for its rail network during the Civil War, pivotal in the Confederacy's inevitable defeat. Vincent studied <b>engineering</b> in his <b>spare</b> time from a course offered by International Correspondence Schools. Vincent established himself with [...] "a thick portfolio of patents" [...] at the Burroughs Adding Machine Company in Detroit {{before moving on to}} become acting chief engineer for the Hudson Motor Car Company late in 1910. Jesse Vincent was a very close friend of Hudson's Howard E. Coffin.|$|R
25|$|The {{first major}} {{shipment}} of CONEXes, containing <b>engineering</b> supplies and <b>spare</b> parts, {{was made by}} rail from the Columbus General Depot in Georgia to the Port of San Francisco, then by ship to Yokohama, Japan, and then to Korea, in late 1952; shipment times were almost halved. By {{the time of the}} Vietnam War the majority of supplies and materials were shipped by CONEX. By 1965 the US military used some 100,000 Conex boxes, and more than 200,000 in 1967. making this the first worldwide application of intermodal containers. After the US Department of Defense standardized an 8-foot by 8-foot cross section container in multiples of 10-foot lengths for military use, it was rapidly adopted for shipping purposes.|$|R
5000|$|Ischi {{was born}} and raised in Tokyo, Japan. In high school, he was a loner, but it was during this time that he first heard yodeling on the radio. Following his father, Ischi went to {{university}} for mechanical <b>engineering.</b> In his <b>spare</b> time he became engrossed with the zither and the hammered dulcimer, and learned to play these instruments. Using Franzl Lang's records, he taught himself to yodel, and began performing on Japanese television. During a six-month period where he studied abroad in Germany, Ischi went to Switzerland, where he sang at a beer hall in Zurich. He soon started earning money from this. From there he sang in front of Lang, his idol, and Lang took him under his wing. He performed on television with Maria Hellwig, and after that became known in German language circles as the [...] "Japanese yodeler"..|$|R

40|$|The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) {{primary mirror}} (PM) is 6. 6 m in {{diameter}} and consists of 18 hexagonal segments, each 1. 5 m point-to-point. Each segment has a six degree-of-freedom hexapod actuation system and a radius-of-curvature (RoC) actuation system. The full telescope will be tested at its cryogenic operating temperature at Johnson Space Center. This testing will include center-of-curvature measurements of the PM, using the Center-of-Curvature Optical Assembly (COCOA) and the Absolute Distance Meter Assembly (ADMA). The COCOA includes an interferometer, a reflective null, an interferometer-null calibration system, coarse & fine alignment systems, and two displacement measuring interferometer systems. A multiple-wavelength interferometer (MWIF) is used for alignment & phasing of the PM segments. The ADMA is used to measure, and set, the spacing between the PM and {{the focus of the}} COCOA null (i. e. the PM center-of-curvature) for determination of the ROC. The performance of these metrology systems was assessed during two cryogenic tests at JSC. This testing was performed using the JWST Pathfinder telescope, consisting mostly of <b>engineering</b> development & <b>spare</b> hardware. The Pathfinder PM consists of two spare segments. These tests provided the opportunity to assess how well the center-of-curvature optical metrology hardware, along with the software & procedures, performed using real JWST telescope hardware. This paper will describe the test setup, the testing performed, and the resulting metrology system performance. The knowledge gained and the lessons learned during this testing will be of great benefit to the accurate & efficient cryogenic testing of the JWST flight telescope...|$|R
