25|$|In 2014, Alstom and General Electric (GE) {{announced}} that a US$17billion (€12.4billion) bid for the company's power and grid divisions had been made and provisionally accepted. After modification of the deal following political controversy in France relating to the take over by a foreign company of a strategic player in heavy industry, GE's bid was modified; to include joint ventures in power generation and electrical transmission, and the sale of its own rail signalling business to Alstom. The GE acquisition deal for the power and grid division was accepted by EU and US anticompetition authorities in mid 2015, subject to the sale of Alstom's heavy gas turbine business. The acquisition was finalised on 2 November 2015, with GE acquiring Alstom's power generation and electricity transmission business (combined as <b>GE</b> <b>Power)</b> leaving the Alstom company operating solely in the rail transport market.|$|E

25|$|Companies like General Electric {{have had}} {{a major impact on}} the growth of the city. The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) of the early 1990s saw a major shift in trading {{patterns}} for many Canadian companies. Other innovations like just in time delivery and pressure to produce ever cheaper goods impacted some of the large multi-nationals in the 1970s and 1980s. GE operations in Peterborough consists of GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy Canada and <b>GE</b> <b>Power</b> Conversion. Despite this, today GE, PepsiCo Quaker, Siemens and numerous smaller manufacturing companies are experiencing significant growth. Minute Maid (Coca-Cola) recently invested $CDN20 million in a new warehouse and product line while auto parts supplier Ventra has doubled in size. United Canadian Malt Ltd. is a manufacturer {{of a wide variety of}} extracts of malted barley, and other grains. Manufacturing job creation kept pace with the provincial average from 1991–2001. Lower costs, reliable labour and high quality post-secondary institutions are a competitive advantage for Peterborough.

2500|$|The FEC {{completed}} its [...] "second generation" [...] dieselisation with {{the purchase of}} 49 GP40s and GP40-2s and 11 GP38-2s, ranging in the 400's. [...] Most of these locomotives have been extensively rebuilt with others being retired. [...] In 2002, the FEC acquired 20 ex-UP SD40-2s, which were numbered in 700s. These ex UP locomotives remained in their original colors with FEC markings, however as of 2014 seven {{of them have been}} repainted into the [...] "retro" [...] Champion scheme. As of 2015 the majority of these were leased to CSXT. [...] In 2006 The FEC leased four SD70M-2's numbered in the 100 series (100-103) in a blue and yellow livery known by fans as the [...] "Classic" [...] or the [...] "Alaskan" [...] schemes. [...] In 2009 when RailAmerica came into the picture, they added four more SD70M-2's (104-107) in the Red, Pearl & Blue scheme which was the standard RailAmerica scheme. That brought the total SD70M-2 count to eight. Seeking further power improvements, in 2009, the FEC leased three CITX SD70M-2's making the count now of 11 of the big EMD's. These locomotives were numbered 140, 141 and 142, all are big blue and white striped units. All of the SD70M-2's served on the railway until the end of 2014 when they were replaced with new power. The fleet GP38-2s are used principally for yard and road switching as well as the occasional local. [...] The others are used as available in road service. Some test runs have been made to observe the effect on fuel consumption of dynamic braking and combinations of new and old power. In 2014 the railway purchased 24 GE ES44C4's, the first <b>GE</b> <b>power</b> to be owned by the FEC. All of the GE's have been delivered by the end of 2014 with the first run on November 21, 2014. In 2015 the railway will begin to experiment with LNG fuel that will help with costs and efficiency. With the arrival of the GE's the majority of the FEC's SD40-2's and a number of the SD70M-2's have been temporarily leased to CSXT. Two SD40-2's remain numbers 711 and 715 usually assigned to the Port of Miami jobs. Eventually, all the SD70M-2's will be returned to their respective leasing companies by the end of 2015 and the SD40-2's will remain on the FEC with the exception of leases to other companies.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The use {{of radio}} {{frequency}} identification (RFID) technologies is becoming widespread in all kind of wireless network-based applications. As expected, applications based on sensor networks, ad-hoc or mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) can be highly benefited from the adoption of RFID solutions. There is a strong need to employ lightweight cryptographic primitives for many security applications because of the tight cost and constrained resource requirement of sensor based networks. This paper mainly focuses on the security analysis of lightweight protocols and algorithms proposed {{for the security of}} RFID systems. A large number of research solutions have been proposed to implement lightweight cryptographic primitives and protocols in sensor and RFID integration based resource constraint networks. In this work, an overview of the currently discussed lightweight primitives and their attributes has been done. These primitives and protocols have been compared based on gate equivalents (<b>GEs),</b> <b>power,</b> technology, strengths, weaknesses and attacks. Further, an integration of primitives and protocols is compared with the possibilities of their applications in practical scenarios...|$|R
