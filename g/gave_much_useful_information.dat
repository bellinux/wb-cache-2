40|$|A {{two stage}} {{approach}} to performing ab initio calculations on medium and large sized molecules is described. The {{first step is}} to perform SCF calculations on small molecules or molecular fragments using the OPIT Program. This employs a small basis set of spherical and p-type Gaussian functions. The Gaussian functions can be identified very closely with atomic cores, bond pairs, lone pairs, etc. The position and exponent of any of the Gaussian functions can be varied by OPIT to produce a small but fully optimised basis set. The second stage is the molecular fragments method. As an example of this, Gaussian exponents and distances are taken from an OPIT calculation on ethylene and used unchanged in a single SCF calculation on benzene.

One of the most important objectives of the Church after the Council of Trent was the recovery of a closer relationship between the clergy and the faithful and it was pursued through the establishment and renewal of confraternities.

40|$|While many {{publications}} {{concentrate on}} the characterization of the mechanical and physical properties of resin composites in order to guide practitioners in their material’s choice according to particular clinical conditions there is only very scarce reference of studies on their rheological properties. The purpose of this work was to study the flow characteristics of resin composites before curing {{as an attempt to}} complete their physical and mechanical characterization. A first part of this work presents a characterization study of composites focusing on the comparison of their mechanical properties and the characterization of their inorganic fraction. Such characterization, although <b>giving</b> <b>much</b> <b>useful</b> <b>information</b> for the prediction of composites performance, is insufficient to determine proper clinical indications to restorative materials. The rheological study of resin composites first focuses on the viscoelastic properties of commercially available materials. It was shown that they exhibit complex rheological properties. They are non-Newtonian, viscoelastic materials. Their viscosity dramatically decreases as the frequency or rate of deformation increases, they show solid-like behavior at rest and their rheological properties are time-dependant {{in such a way that}} when they are submitted to flow, viscosity drastically decreases and takes many hours to return to its original value. From there, an evaluation of the influence of each component, organic as well as inorganic, on the rheological properties of final materials was performed with the help of model experimental formulations. The complex flow properties that were demonstrated with commercial formulations were confirmed by the experimental ones. It was also shown that the inorganic particles, and in particular sub-micronic particles, are the determinants of the complex rheological behavior since they induce many types of interaction mechanisms with their surrounding environment that lead to time-dependant local rearrangements of the structure of materials. Finally, a third part develops links from rheological properties to possible clinical implications. Different flowable resin composites and pit and fissure sealants were characterized mechanically and rheologically, and attempts of clinical indications based upon both their flow properties and their mechanical behavior were made. On the other hand, since rheology is time-dependent, mechanical properties were also investigated as a function of processing time. It was demonstrated that some materials present a progressive increase of their dynamic elastic modulus as a function of time after deformation. This particular behavior is linked to the type of microfiller and nanofiller they contain but cannot be explained on the basis of their rheological properties alone. (DENT 3) [...] UCL, 200...|$|R

40|$|Within a small region (e. g., < 10 cM), {{there can}} be {{multiple}} quantitative trait loci (QTL) underlying phenotypes of a trait. Simultaneous fine mapping of closely linked QTL needs an efficient tool to remove confounded shade effects among QTL within such a small region. We propose a variance component method using combined linkage disequilibrium (LD) and linkage information and a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling for model selection. QTL identity-by-descent (IBD) coefficients between individuals are estimated by a hybrid MCMC combining the random walk and the meiosis Gibbs sampler. These coefficients are used in a mixed linear model and an empirical Bayesian procedure combines residual maximum likelihood (REML) to estimate QTL effects and a reversible jump MCMC that samples the number of QTL and the posterior QTL intensities across the tested region. Note that two MCMC processes are used, i. e., an (internal) MCMC for IBD estimation and an (external) MCMC for model selection. In a simulation study, {{the use of the}} multiple-QTL model clearly removes the shade effects between three closely linked QTL located at 1. 125, 3. 875, and 7. 875 cM across the region of 10 cM, using 40 markers at 0. 25 -cM intervals. It is shown that the use of combined LD and linkage <b>information</b> <b>gives</b> <b>much</b> more <b>useful</b> <b>information</b> compared to using linkage information alone for both single- and multiple-QTL analyses.

40|$|Imagery {{formed from}} {{wide-angle}} {{synthetic aperture radar}} (SAR) measurements has fine cross-range resolution in principle. However, conventional SAR image formation techniques assume isotropic scattering, which is not valid with wide-angle apertures. Also, the spatial location of scattering centers may migrate {{as a function of}} viewing angle across the aperture. The problem of jointly forming images and characterizing anisotropy as well as characterizing scattering center migration in wide-angle SAR is considered in the thesis. The approach not only compensates for anisotropy and migration in the image formation process, but <b>gives</b> <b>much</b> more <b>information,</b> <b>useful</b> for scene interpretation, than a simple image would. A method based on a sparse representation of anisotropic scattering with an over-complete basis composed of basis vectors with varying levels of angular persistence is presented. Solved as an inverse problem, the result is a complex-valued, aspect-dependent response for each scatterer in a scene. The non-parametric approach jointly considers all scatterers within one system of equations. (cont.) The choice of the overcomplete basis set incorporates prior knowledge of anisotropy, but the method is flexible enough to admit solutions that may not match a family of parametric functions. Sparsity is enforced through regularization based on the lp quasi-norm, p < 1, leading to a non-convex minimization problem. A quasi-Newton method is applied to the problem and a novel greedy graph-structured algorithm is developed and also applied. Results are demonstrated on synthetic examples and realistic examples with XPatch data, including the backhoe public release dataset. by Kush R. Varshney. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|During {{the last}} years {{perovskite}} materials have taken the photovoltaic community by storm, bringing promises of solar cells with efficiencies comparable to conventional silicon devices but at a lower price. However perovskite solar cells so far are facing two main obstacles, they are unstable {{in the presence of}} air, moisture and heat and they are usually toxic due to being based on lead-halide materials. This has spurred investigations into alternative materials with similar properties but without the mentioned drawbacks. Just next to Pb in the periodic table is bismuth (Bi) with just one more electron in its outer-shell, Bi however is less toxic. In this work the perovskite derived compounds of Ag-Bi-I and Cu-Bi-I are characterized and their properties as light absorbing material in solar cell devices are investigated. Devices are prepared by preparing Ag-Bi-I and Cu-Bi-I solutions which are then spin-coated on top of a mesoporous TiO 2. A conducting polymer, P 3 HT, was then deposited and serve as hole transport material. For Ag-Bi-I, the molar ratios of AgI:BiI 3 = 1 : 2 and 2 : 1 were observed with SEM to form homogeneous crystal films with one dominating crystal phase, which by XRD could be determined to most likely have formed a cubic AgBi 2 I 7 crystal structure for the 1 : 2 ratio and a hexagonal Ag 2 BiI 5 crystal structure for the 2 : 1 ratio. The Cu-Bi-I materials were not successfully synthesized to form homogeneous films with a dominating crystal phase, although several molar ratios were investigated. All investigated compositions of both Cu and Ag devices showed to in principle work as light absorbing materials, the best Ag-Bi-I device showing a PCE of 1. 92 %, for the 2 : 1 ratio, while the Cu-Bi-I devices at best reached 0. 32 % for a ratio of 1 : 1. XPS measurements were carried out with a classical in-house XPS using an Al K X-ray source of 1486. 7 eV {{as well as at the}} Diamond Light Source (UK) synchrotron facility using photon energies of 758 eV and 2200 eV so that a depth resolution of the composition could be observed. Because of their inhomogeneous crystal formation, XPS couldn’t <b>give</b> <b>much</b> <b>useful</b> quantitative <b>information</b> regarding the Cu devices. For Ag devices it was observed that the stoichiometry at the extreme surface deviated from that predicted by XRD, but deeper into the surface the relative ratio of elements approach the predicted ones, hinting towards a different structure at the outermost surface or a lot of surface defects. For all samples, two types of bismuth atoms were observed, metallic (Bi 0) as well as a cationic (Bi+x), the later corresponding to Bi atoms which are partaking in the crystal bond. The ratio of metallic to cationic Bi was observed to decrease notably just a few nm below the extreme surface. The effect of the high presence of metallic Bi on final device performance was not concluded with certainty but not believed to be positive. By varying the annealing temperature, after spin coating the light absorber solution on the TiO 2, it was observed that lower temperature resulted in a lower ratio of metallic Bi. As final conclusions, it was said that the synthesis method of Cu-Bi-I needs to be improved before those materials can be studied further. The synthesis of Ag-Bi-I is showing much more promise and one can start looking into further optimizing their final device structure to boost efficiency. Both Cu-Bi-I and Ag-Bi-I devices are relatively simple, cheap and energy efficient (with annealing temperatures around 150 C) to produce, great aspects for solar cells. UVVis measurements showed they have band gaps around 1. 6 - 1. 7 eV which makes them a great potential material for use in tandem solar cells together with a semiconductor of lower band gap such as silicon...|$|R
