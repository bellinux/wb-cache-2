Notwithstanding these needs, only few materials are marketed which feature reasonably good both thermal and acoustic insulation properties. More often, materials with good sound insulation proprieties show poor thermal efficiency and vice versa. Further, most of materials which have good both acoustic and thermal properties are thicker than either acoustic or thermals insulators which creates technical difficulties in their use, particularly in the buildings’ renovation.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{addition}} of gaseous fuels to the intake manifold of diesel engines can have significant benefits in terms of both reducing emissions of hazardous gases and soot and improving fuel economy. Particularly, the addition of LPG has been investigated in numerous studies. Drawbacks, however, of such dual fuel strategies can be found in storage complexity and end-user inconvenience. It {{is for this reason that}} on-board refining of a single fuel (for example, diesel) could be an interesting alternative. A second-generation fuel reformer has been engineered and successfully tested. The reformer can work with both gaseous and liquid fuels and by means of partial oxidation of a rich fuel-air mix, converts these into syngas: a mixture of H 2 and CO. The process occurs as partial oxidation takes place in an adiabatic ceramic reaction chamber. High efficiency is ensured by the high temperature inside the chamber due to heat release. Thus, <b>efficient</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>insulation</b> is crucial to maintain said temperature. Heat recuperation from the reformer exhaust also improves the thermal efficiency. The prototype yields up to 20 % of H 2 (80 % of the theoretical maximum) and 22 % of CO with all kinds of fuels tested, including automotive diesel fuel. <b>Efficient</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>insulation</b> allows to keep the dimensions below 40 cm in any direction for a full burning power of 10 - 30 kW while outer wall of the reformer is exposed to air at normal temperature...|$|E

40|$|Buildings consume {{about 40}} % of the {{national}} energy requirement in a developed country, {{and the addition of}} <b>thermal</b> <b>insulation</b> in building envelope construction is considered as the most primary and effective way to reduce energy consumption in buildings. Recent upgrades of energy codes in Europe and North America have also recommended higher levels of insulation in building envelopes. All these factors have provided a fresh impetus for the search for high-performance <b>thermal</b> <b>insulation.</b> Among various nonconventional insulations being introduced in the construction industry, as the next-generation <b>thermal</b> <b>insulation,</b> vacuum insulation panel (VIP) appears {{to be one of the}} most promising insulation materials, with the highest thermal insulating capacity (up to 10 times more thermally <b>efficient</b> than conventional <b>thermal</b> <b>insulation</b> materials). Quite naturally, the application of VIP in building envelope construction offers many advantages such as increased energy efficiency of exterior building envelopes, thinner wall thickness, optimum space use, reduced material consumption, etc. However, the acceptance of VIP in the construction industry is critically dependent on the cost and long-term performance. The expensive core material (e. g., precipitated silica or fumed silica) is one of the main reasons for the higher cost of VIPs that offer a satisfactory long-term service life in building envelope applications. To overcome this cost barrier for the mass application of VIPs in the building industry, researchers at the National Research Council Canada - Construction Portfolio have developed a low-cost fiber-powder composite core material for the VIP. This paper briefly introduces the concept of fiber-powder composite and present performance assessment data from laboratory-scale trial VIPs (300 mm by 300 mm) constructed with fiber-powder composite core materials.

40|$|Energy audits for {{companies}} have been promoted since more than four decades, but no evaluation has yet been carried out {{which is based on}} the counterfactual behaviour of a large comparable control group. This paper empirically analyses the effect of the German energy audit program on small participating companies’ decision to adopt energy efficiency measures. Non-parametric propensity score matching estimators are employed to estimate the average effect of the audit on more than 500 small companies (< 50 employees) participating in the program thereby relying on also more than 500 observations from a control group survey. Our findings so far are fairly robust across alternative matching algorithms and suggest that audit participation resulted in higher adoption of lower cost measures in particular, i. e. of energy efficient lighting (+ 20 percentage points) and of measures optimizing the heating system (+ 28 percentage points). The audit increased the adoption of <b>thermal</b> <b>insulation</b> measures by about 11 percentage points and of heating replacements by about 6 – 15 percentage points. Thus, the energy audits roughly doubled the adoption rates of energy <b>efficient</b> lighting, <b>thermal</b> <b>insulation</b> and heating replacements, and almost quadrupled the rates for heating optimization. For measures which companies had considered for implementation independent of the audit but had not (yet) planned to implement them, the audit effect remains the same for the lower cost measures, and increases significantly for the higher cost measures. Thus for the four measures considered, audits may contribute little to overcoming the lack of information about technology availability. Instead, energy audits appear to rather help overcome organizational barriers like intra-company priority setting, or lack of strategic importance...|$|R

30|$|The thermophysical {{properties}} of solar salt {{are important to}} the efficiency and safety of thermal storage systems in power plants. The most important thermal storage properties are specific heat capacity (SHC), melting temperature, and startup heat. The volume and total cost of a storage system can decrease if molten salt with a high value of SHC is utilized [2]. The melting temperature of molten salt determines the low limit of the operation temperature in a thermal storage system. Meanwhile, if the melting point is high, then the temperature difference between the thermal storage material and the surrounding would be large. This phenomenon can result in increased heat dissipation and thus requires highly <b>efficient</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>insulation</b> [3]. With regard to startup heat, a large amount of heat is required to heat solar salt for solid-to-liquid phase transformation during the startup of a solar thermal power plant. Excessive startup heat slows down the melting process and increases the risk of local over-heating of molten salt [1].|$|E

These term are defined in ASTM C 168 (2017): thermal conductivity is {{the rate of}} steady state heat flow through a unit area of a material induced by a unit temperature gradient in a direction perpendicular to the unit area; thermal resistance is the quantity determined by the temperature difference, at steady state, between two defined surfaces of a material that induces a unit heat flow through a unit area; and thermal transmittance is the heat transmission in unit time through a unit area of a material and the boundary air films, induced by unit temperature differences between the environments on each side. Thermal conductivity and resistance are indices of heat flow from surface to surface, but thermal transmittance is an index from environment to environment; therefore, the environmental temperatures of both sides must be well defined.
