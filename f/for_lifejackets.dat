2500|$|Various items, {{previously}} discarded, {{were saved}} after use {{for what was}} called [...] "recycling" [...] years later. Families were requested to save fat drippings from cooking for use in soap making. Neighborhood [...] "scrap drives" [...] collected scrap copper and brass for use in artillery shells. Milkweed was harvested by children ostensibly <b>for</b> <b>lifejackets.</b>|$|E
50|$|Charges {{of looting}} were dropped after {{extensive}} questioning. The crewmen maintained {{that they had}} only broken into cabins to search <b>for</b> extra <b>lifejackets.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Joyita {{carried a}} dinghy and three Carley liferafts, but all were missing. She did not carry enough <b>lifejackets</b> <b>for</b> {{everyone}} on board.|$|R
50|$|There {{is also a}} {{conflict}} between the requirements <b>for</b> a <b>lifejacket,</b> which must keep the wearer face up and afloat even when unconscious, and a buoyancy compensator, which should allow the diver freedom to control trim attitude both underwater and floating at the surface. Diving buoyancy compensators are generally labelled with a warning {{that they are not}} a substitute for life jackets.|$|R
50|$|The Lakonia was {{outfitted}} {{with a number of}} safety features. She carried 24 lifeboats capable of holding 1,455 people. The ship had an automatic fire alarm system and two fire stations with specialized firefighting equipment. There were <b>lifejackets</b> <b>for</b> every person on board and an extra 400 stowed on deck.|$|R
5000|$|Four Chaplains Memorial, outside St. Stephen's Church, Kearny, NJ. St. Stephen's was Father Washington's last {{assignment}} {{before he}} joined the Army. On the 70th Anniversary of {{the sinking of the}} Dorchester, this statue was dedicated. The front shows the four men, arms locked, praying on the stern of the Dorchester, and the back is an angel, carrying four <b>lifejackets</b> <b>for</b> the men.|$|R
5000|$|In 2008 {{there were}} no {{full-time}} residents or permanent structures on the island. [...] Hill announced his intention to erect a structure on the island, without planning permission. [...] He travelled {{to and from the}} island on a small flat-bottomed plywood home made boat; in September 2008 he had to be rescued by a Coastguard helicopter and RNLI Lifeboat after his vessel began to sink. His boat was described as [...] "ramshackle" [...] and a [...] "floating wardrobe" [...] and was criticised by his rescuers <b>for</b> having no <b>lifejacket</b> or radio aboard.|$|R
50|$|The Ontario Sailing Association (OSA) runs a BOOM Sailing Program at Kennisis Lake {{during the}} summer. The program offers Kennisis {{resident}} members and non-members {{five days of}} lessons. This program includes in-water and in-class sessions teaching Kennisis members how to sail on the lake. The Ontario Sailing Association provides professional instructors tending to a limited class of sixteen students. The OSA also supplies instructional boats, teaching aids and <b>lifejackets</b> <b>for</b> all the participants. Although the summer program targets children ages nine to fifteen, the OSA offers an adult “learn to sail” program with a more limited number of participants.|$|R
50|$|In {{exchange}} for {{his involvement in the}} Ontario Progressive Conservative Party, he was appointed Ontario's chief coroner in 1961. In 1963, he was named Chief Coroner of the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto. Shulman was outspoken and used his position as coroner to crusade {{on a number of issues}} such as enacting tougher regulations on <b>lifejackets</b> <b>for</b> small boats, having government regulate car safety, the introduction of breathalysers into Ontario, and against then-restrictive abortion laws after he investigated the deaths of women who had died while trying to terminate their pregnancies. In other crusades, he helped to force surgeons to count instruments before and after surgery, and construction companies to provide better bracing in trenches. His years as a coroner became the inspiration for the Canadian television drama Wojeck.|$|R
40|$|Recreational boating {{education}} in the United States is offered through a system of government agencies and non-government organizations, including the boating industry. The "best practices " in boater safety {{education in}}clude means of ensuring the availability of education programs, ensuring the content {{and quality of the}} educational programs, getting more people to obtain the education, and finally, getting people to act on what they learn. The best practices include development of educational programs that are age-appropriate and suitable for boaters of all skill levels (including instructors); compliance with official boating education standards; and provision of boating courses through a variety of means, including traditional classes, self study, and online courses. Boater safety education programs in the United States are described. Commonly used specific practices include videos, practice examinations, provision of materials and equipment (such as loaner <b>lifejackets</b> <b>for</b> kids), mascots, incentives, and special events. There is a trend towards mandatory boater education, as mor...|$|R
50|$|The Lac Du Saint Sacrement is {{considered}} to be the flagship of the Lake George Steamboat Company in Warren County, New York. It is the largest and newest boat in the company. The boat runs on caterpillar diesel engines and carries <b>lifejackets</b> <b>for</b> every passenger on board in case of an emergency. It also has rescue boats, an emergency generator, and incombustible furniture throughout the boat.The ship consists of 4 decks, 3 of which are heated and air-conditioned, cocktail lounges, a dance floor, a snack shop, a gift shop, and wheel chair lifts on the first 3 floors. The name “Lac Du Saint Sacrement” comes from the original name of Lake George until it was renamed in 1755 after King George II. Lac du Saint Sacrement, the original name of the Lake until the English won the French and Indian War in 1756, was given by Father Isaac Jogues, a French Canadian missionary who found the lake in 1646.|$|R
50|$|As she patrolled Bungo Suido, she {{was often}} {{assigned}} as lifeguard for air strikes against the Japanese islands. While off Omino Shima before sunrise on 25 May, she received word that a B-29 Superfortress was in trouble. She began the search in state four seas with only fair visibility and, two hours after dawn, homed in by friendly air cover, she rescued two Army aviators who had been floating in their <b>lifejackets</b> <b>for</b> three and one-half hours. Twenty minutes later, she rescued another aviator and then continued her search for additional survivors {{until late in the}} day. While patrolling on the surface on the following morning, she made radar contact with a possible target at 2000 yd. The submarine turned toward the contact and shortly thereafter a torpedo wake crossed her bow, indicating that an enemy vessel had first located her. Toro dove and had no further contact with the unseen attacker. Toro continued patrols and lifeguard duty in Bungo Suido until 14 June when she set her course for the Mariana Islands. She moored at Apra Harbor five days later.|$|R
40|$|Military personnel’s {{equipment}} {{has become}} heavier {{in recent years}} in order to provide improved combat protection. These encumbered personnel are required to wear a <b>lifejacket</b> <b>for</b> operations over water. Yet only limited published research has been identified that addresses the adequacy and efficiency of lifejackets to protect heavily encumbered military personnel from drowning. The research presented in this thesis investigates a buoyancy system, known as the multi purpose lifejacket concept that combines an inflatable lifejacket with additional buoyancy placed lower on the body in order to adequately support encumbered military personnel in the water. A comparison study has been conducted on yoke and bib lifejackets to investigate the effects of temperature and pressure on lifejacket volume, and the expected mouth freeboard tolerances of good and poor fitting lifejackets. The thesis also considers the effect that the shape of the bladder around the head has on face-plane angle and mouth freeboard. These both impact on head tilt angle. Positive head tilt was expected to improve the survival prospects in water. Static pool experiments with the two buoyancy systems have indicated how much load can be supported. This work was reinforced with wave tank experiments to determine the water ingress into a manikin’s mouth under various load and sea conditions, resulting in recommendations for suitable mouth freeboard clearances. This study identified that the particular bib lifejacket supported additional load more effectively than the yoke lifejacket investigated, when used in conjunction with buoyancy worn on the thighs. Computer models were developed to gain an understanding of the buoyancy relationships and what effect the centre of buoyancy had on supporting the encumbered load. An investigation of the three most relevant standards for this study suggested that the ISO standard best addresses the aspects of encumbered military personnel from drowning. However, it is recommended the technical requirements that can support encumbered military personnel should be additional criteria to this standard...|$|R
