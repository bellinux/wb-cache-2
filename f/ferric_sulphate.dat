It is found that the effect of temperature complicates the identification of a given Fe(3 +) phase based on the position of the 6 A 1 - 4 T 1 absorption feature. While the Fe(3 +) crystal field transitions are spin forbidden, most of the iron oxide polymorphs exhibit anomalously intense crystal field absorption features due to magnetic coupling between adjacent FeO 6 octahedra. It is suggested that the resulting deviations from observed remotely sensed reflectance spectra of Mars may provide a basis for the exclusion of many iron oxide phases as significant components of the Martian Fe(3 +) mineralogy. A comparison of these results with the visible region spectra of Martian bright regions indicates that the predominant Fe(3 +) -bearing phase may be a magnetically disordered material, such as amorphous gels, some <b>ferric</b> <b>sulphates,</b> and other minerals in which Fe(3 +) ions in the crystal structure are not magnetically coupled...|$|R

The study examines the influence of varying the leaching protocol on the rate of release of U, Th, Y and REEs. Leaching protocols were designed to simulate a range of heap/in situ stope leaching scenarios. Protocol variants included flushing frequency, leachate recycle, nutrient (9 K salts) addition and <b>ferric</b> <b>sulphate</b> addition to cells. Maximum extractions over 52 weeks were: 58 % U, 50 % Th, 36 % Y and 45 % of the REEs; observed in cells flushed fortnightly with a <b>ferric</b> <b>sulphate</b> lixiviant (0. 5 g/l, pH 3. 5). Flushing with tap water once monthly resulted in second highest observed extractions (57 % U, 6 % Th, 27 % Y, 37 % REEs) {{with the exception of}} Th, where the lower release was due to insufficiently low pH for Th mobilisation. Pourbaix plots indicate that redox potentials within the leaching system were buffered by coffinite dissolution. The high redox potentials, acidic pH and elevated sulphate concentrations required for metals dissolution were found to be a consequence of (a) direct addition of <b>ferric</b> <b>sulphate</b> as a lixiviant or (b) in situ generation of acidity and <b>ferric</b> <b>sulphate</b> via microbially-mediated oxidation of accessory pyrite. Generation and maintenance of acidic sulphate-rich interstitial water appear to control the dissolution of Th, Y and REEs in addition to U. The presented data highlight that significant U, Th, Y and REEs can be mobilised from rock materials by the addition of a <b>ferric</b> <b>sulphate</b> lixiviant, furthermore periodic flushing with water alone is sufficient to achieve similar release of U, Y and REEs where accessory pyrite is available in the reacting system.

40|$|In this work, the kinetic and {{equilibrium}} {{profiles of}} each individual reaction step involved {{in the production of}} hematite at 200 °C via oxydrolysis of ferrous sulphate in concentrated zinc sulphate media were established. Crystallization of ferrous sulphate was found to {{play a crucial role in}} the overall process due to its relatively low solubility and fast crystallization kinetics at elevated temperatures. In fact, the overall kinetics of the oxydrolysis process were found to be limited by the re-dissolution of ferrous sulphate. Pre-crystallization of ferrous sulphate prior to oxidation was found to result in enhanced overall kinetics, cutting down the required retention time from 3 to 2 hours. Enhanced kinetics were also achieved by performing oxydrolysis in two-temperature stages: a low temperature (T = 180 °C) first stage with retention time > 20 min and an elevated temperature (T = 200 °C) second stage with retention time > 100 min. The typical composition of the hematite material produced in this work was 64. 3 % Fe, 1. 3 % S (as SO 4), 0. 6 % Zn, and 4. 6 % H 2 O. The sulphur content was found to be predominantly (0. 6 [...] 0. 8 %) due to formation of sodium jarosite with the remaining (0. 3 [...] 0. 5 %) attributed to SO 4 chemisorption, and (to less extent) basic <b>ferric</b> <b>sulphate</b> formation. In the absence of zinc sulphate, the majority of sulphate contamination was due to basic <b>ferric</b> <b>sulphate</b> formation.

Conventional water treatment which involves a train of operating units such as coagulation, flocculation and sand filtration consumes substantial spaces and high Hydraulic Retention Time (HRT). Besides that it relies most on chemical consumption such as aluminium <b>sulphate,</b> <b>ferric</b> chloride and poly-aluminium chloride which end up as sludge waste contaminated with aluminium or ferric oxides. Furthermore, the chemical reaction between Natural Organic Matter (NOM) and disinfectant agent such as chlorine or chloramines has been extensively reported to form carcinogenic Disinfection By-Product (DBPs) which is potential in causing deleterious cancers diseases. Therefore, a more reliable and greener technology such as membrane technology has been employed as it possesses better capability in producing water of exceptional quality and practicality over the conventional treatment process. However, the widespread of this potential feature is significantly restricted by fouling issue which reduces its productivity, permeate quality and treatment performance...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPreviously {{we showed}} that {{preincubation}} of cells with ferric ammonium citrate (FAC) resulted in a marked increase in Fe uptake from both 59 Fe-transferrin (Tf) and 59 Fe-citrate (D. R. Richardson, E. Baker, J. Biol. Chem. 267 (1992) 13972 – 13979; D. R. Richardson, P. Ponka, Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1269 (1995) 105 – 114). This Fe uptake process was independent of the transferrin receptor {{and appeared to be}} activated by free radicals generated via the iron-catalysed Haber-Weiss reaction. To further understand this process, the present investigation was performed. In these experiments, cells were preincubated for 3 h at 37 °C with FAC or metal ion solutions and then labelled for 3 h at 37 °C with 59 Fe-Tf. Exposure of cells to FAC resulted in Fe uptake from 59 Fe-citrate that became saturated at an Fe concentration of 2. 5 μM, while FAC-activated Fe uptake from Tf was not saturable up to 25 μM. In addition, the extent of FAC-activated Fe uptake from citrate was far greater than that from Tf. These results suggest a mechanism where FAC-activated Fe uptake from citrate may result from direct interaction with the transporter, while Fe uptake from Tf appears indirect and less efficient. Preincubation of cells with FAC at 4 °C instead of 37 °C prevented its effect at stimulating 59 Fe uptake from 59 Fe-Tf, suggesting that an active process was involved. Previous studies by others have shown that FAC can increase ferrireductase activity that may enhance 59 Fe uptake from 59 Fe-Tf. However, {{there was no difference in}} the ability of FAC-treated cells compared to controls to reduce ferricyanide to ferrocyanide, suggesting no change in oxidoreductase activity. To examine if activation of this Fe uptake mechanism could occur by incubation with a range of metal ions, cells were preincubated with either FAC, <b>ferric</b> chloride, ferrous <b>sulphate,</b> ferrous ammonium sulphate, gallium nitrate, copper chloride, zinc chloride, or cobalt chloride. Stimulation of 59 Fe uptake from Tf was shown (in order of potency) with <b>ferric</b> chloride, ferrous <b>sulphate,</b> ferrous ammonium sulphate, and gallium nitrate. The other metal ions examined decreased 59 Fe uptake from Tf. The fact that redox-active Cu(II) ion did not stimulate Fe uptake while redox-inactive Ga(III) did, suggests a mechanism of transporter activation not solely dependent on free radical generation. Indeed, the activation of Fe uptake appears dependent on the presence of the Fe atom itself or a metal ion with atomic similarities to Fe (e. g. Ga) ...|$|R
