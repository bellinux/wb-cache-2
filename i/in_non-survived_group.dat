40|$|Objectives: Necrotizing {{fasciitis}} (NF) is rare {{but life}} threatening soft tissue infection {{characterized by a}} necrotizing process of the subcutaneous tissues and fascial planes. The Laboratory Risk Indicator for Necrotizing Fasciitis (LRINEC) score has been verified as a useful diagnostic tool for detecting necrotizing fasciitis. A certain LRINEC score might also be associated with mortality. The aims {{of this study are}} to determine risk factors affecting the prognosis and to evaluate the prognostic value of the LRINEC score in NF. Methods: Twenty-five patients with necrotizing fasciitis treated in Samsun Education and Research Hospital between January 2008 and April 2013 were enrolled in the study. Surviving and <b>non-surviving</b> patient <b>groups</b> were compared regarding demographic data, co-morbidity, predisposing factors, causative agents, number of debridements and LRINEC score. Results: Mean age was 55. 6 ± 16. 79 years (min: 17 -max: 84), and the female/male ratio was 16 / 9. Mortality was observed in 6 (24 %) patients. The most frequent comorbid diseases were diabetes mellitus (52) and peripheral circulatory disorders (24 %), and the most frequent etiologies were cutaneous (32 %) and perianal abscess (20 %). Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection was higher <b>in</b> the <b>non-surviving</b> <b>group</b> (p= 0. 006). The mean number of debridements and LRINEC score were higher <b>in</b> the <b>non-surviving</b> <b>group</b> than <b>in</b> the surviving group (p= 0. 003 and p= 0. 003, respectively). Conclusions: Pseudomans aeruginosa infection and multiple debridements are related with mortality. The LRINEC score might help predict mortality in NF...|$|R

Twelve patients hospitalized and treated between August 2007 and August 2013 were included in this study. Distinct features were noted after one or two weeks of hospitalization. We did not observe a significant correlation between death risk and the extent of necrosis in this patient set. However, the extent of necrosis tended to correlate with the duration of hospitalization in the survivors.

40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the prognosis of patients following cardiopulmonary resuscitation in an inten-sive care unit (ICU) using bispectral index (BIS) monitoring. The study was a prospective comparative study performed at the academic department of an ICU. A total of 33 adults who received cardiopulmonary resuscitation were enrolled and divided into the surviving and <b>non-surviving</b> <b>groups</b> according to their 7 -day survival status. During their stay in the ICU, the BIS and arterial oxygen saturation (SaO 2) levels of all the patients were continuously monitored. The neurological condi-tion of the patients was measured according to the Glasgow coma scale (GCS). Acute physiological and chronic diseases were measured according to the acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II). SaO 2 was monitored in all patients. The jugular bulb venous oxygen saturation (SjO 2) levels were continuously monitored in 23 patients and the difference between the SaO 2 and SjO 2 values was used to indicate oxygen metabolism in the brain. The variables in the present study were compared between the 2 groups. The corre-lations between BIS values and GCS or APACHE II scores were analyzed. The BIS values were significantly higher in the surviving <b>group</b> than <b>in</b> the <b>non-surviving</b> <b>group</b> (P< 0. 01). The difference between the SaO 2 and SjO 2 was significant (P< 0. 01). There was a positive correlation between BIS values and GCS scores (r= 0. 821, P< 0. 01) and between BIS values and APACHE II scores (r= 0. 434, P< 0. 05).

40|$|Objectives: To {{describe}} clinical, laboratory, microbiological features, {{and outcomes}} of necrotizing fasciitis. Methods: From January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2011, 115 patients (79 males, 36 females) diagnosed with necrotizing fasciitis were admitted to Mackay Memorial Hospital in Taitung. Demographic data, clinical features, location of infection, type of comorbidities, microbiology and laboratory results, and outcomes of patients were retrospectively analyzed. Results: Among 115 cases, 91 survived (79. 1 %) and 24 died (20. 9 %). There were 67 males (73. 6 %) and 24 females (26. 4 %) {{with a median}} age of 54 years (inter-quartile ranges, 44. 0 – 68. 0 years) in the survival group; and 12 males (50 %) and 12 females (50 %) with a median age of 61 years (inter-quartile ranges, 55. 5 – 71. 5 years) <b>in</b> the <b>non-surviving</b> <b>group.</b> The most common symptoms were local swelling/erythema, fever, pain/tenderness in 92 (80 %), 87 (76 %) and 84 (73 %) patients, respectively. The most common comorbidies were liver cirrhosis in 54 patients (47 %) and diabetes mellitus in 45 patients (39 %). A single organism was identified in 70 patients (61 %), multiple pathogens were isolated in 20 patients (17 %), and no microorganism was identified in 30 patients (26 %).

40|$|BLOOD {{has been}} known for many years to contain {{bacteriostatic}} agents called bactericidins which are capable of inhibit-ing or destroying certain organisms. One of the earliest workers was Nuttall (1888) who showed clearly that blood had the property of destroying "anthrax-subtilus. " Buckner (1889) showed that if the leuco-cytes were removed from the serum, the bactericidal property was retained. Irwin and Hughes (1933) report that whole blood from two inbred strains of rats, highly sus-ceptible to S. enteritidis, showed little or no bactericidal action. Individuals whose blood showed varying degrees of bacteri-cidal activity when infected artificially were approximately equally distributed <b>in</b> sur-viving and <b>non-surviving</b> <b>groups.</b> Wulf (1934) gives a report of a thermostabile bactericidal substance in human sera dur-ing fever; its effects was particularly seen with a strain of meningococcus. Silver-thorne (1937) presented data to show that guinea-pigs are protected against meningo-cocci when bactericidal power has been stimulated in their blood by previous vac-cination with living cultures. It is also re-ported that young children vaccinated with fresh virulent strains of the meningococcus develop bactericidins in their blood. Irwin and Ferguson (1938) found that the bac-tericidal power of the serum of cows gradu-ally became stronger after the first few weeks following artificial infection with B. abortus. The authors do not know of any studies on bactericidins in the domestic fowl. Since bactericidins are one of the entities in im-munity, they may have some practical im-portance in preventing the spread of infec-tion.

40|$|Introduction] Intra-aortic balloon {{occlusion}} (IABO) {{is useful}} for proximal vascular control, by clamping the descending aorta, in traumatic haemorrhagic shock. However, there are limited clinical studies regarding its effectiveness. This study aimed at investigating the effectiveness of IABO for traumatic haemorrhagic shock. [Methods] This retrospective, observational study included trauma patients who underwent IABO at the Emergency and Critical Care Center of Nippon Medical School Tama-Nagayama Hospital between January 2009 and March 2013. 14 patients were included to this study who were in shock on arrival (systolic blood pressure [SBP] < 90 mmHg or shock index ≥ 1), underwent IABO for resuscitation and temporary haemostasis, and subsequently underwent haemostatic intervention (operation or transcatheter arterial embolization). Patient characteristics, physiological status, SBP, heart rate (HR), initial fluid and blood transfusion, time course, and total occlusion time were compared before and after IABO {{as well as between}} the survived (n[*]=[*] 5) and <b>non-survived</b> (n[*]=[*] 9) <b>groups.</b> [Results] The majority of patients experienced blunt injuries, with an average injury severity score of 29. 5. The liver, pelvis, spleen, and mesenterium represented the majority of injured organs. SBP, but not HR, was significantly higher after IABO than before IABO (123. 1 vs. 65. 5 mmHg, P[*]=[*] 0. 0001). The revised trauma score and probability of survival were significantly different between the survived and <b>non-survived</b> <b>groups</b> (both, P[*]=[*] 0. 04). The survived group required significantly less blood transfusion volume than the <b>non-survived</b> <b>group</b> (20 vs. 33. 7 red blood cell units, P[*]=[*] 0. 04). In addition, the survived group required a significantly shorter total occlusion time than the <b>non-survived</b> <b>group</b> (46. 2 vs. 224. 1 min, P[*]=[*] 0. 002). [Conclusions] IABO was used for relatively severe trauma patients. SBP was significantly higher after IABO, but was not related to survival. However, blood transfusion volume and total occlusion time were related to survival; therefore, it is important to reduce or shorten these parameters, i. e., immediate definitive haemostasis. IABO is effective for traumatic haemorrhagic shock; however, {{it is also important to}} consider these points and potential complications...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Community-acquired {{pneumonia}} (CAP) {{is considered}} the most important cause of death from infectious disease in developed countries. Severity assessment scores partially address the difficulties in identifying high-risk patients. A lack of specific and valid pathophysiologic severity markers affect early and effective sepsis therapy. HMGB- 1, sRAGE and RAGE {{have been involved in}} sepsis and their potential as severity markers has been proposed. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate HMGB- 1, RAGE and sRAGE levels in patients with CAP-associated sepsis and determine their possible association with clinical outcome. Method We evaluated 33 patients with CAP-associated sepsis admitted to the emergency room and followed in the medical wards. Severity assessment scores (CURB- 65, PSI, APACHE II, SOFA) and serologic markers (HMGB- 1, RAGE, sRAGE) were evaluated on admission. Results Thirty patients with a diagnosis of CAP-associated sepsis were enrolled in the study within 24 hours after admission. Fourteen (46. 6 %) had pandemic (H 1 N 1) influenza A virus, 2 (6. 6 %) had seasonal influenza A and 14 other diagnoses. Of the patients in the study group, 16 (53. 3 %) had a fatal outcome. ARDS was observed in 17 (56. 6 %) and a total of 22 patients had severe sepsis on admission (73 %). The SOFA score showed the greatest difference between surviving and <b>non-surviving</b> <b>groups</b> (P =. 003) with similar results in ARDS patients (P =. 005). sRAGE levels tended to be higher <b>in</b> <b>non-surviving</b> (P =. 058) and ARDS patients (P =. 058). Logistic regression modeling demonstrated that SOFA (P =. 013) and sRAGE (P =. 05) were the only variables that modified the probability of a fatal outcome. Conclusion The association of elevated sRAGE with a fatal outcome suggests that it may have an independent causal effect in CAP. SOFA scores were the only clinical factor with the ability to identify surviving and ARDS patients. </p...|$|R

40|$|Sepsis is {{a complex}} disease that is {{characterized}} by activation and inhibition of different cell signaling pathways according to the disease stage. Here, we evaluated genes involved in the TLR signaling pathway, oxidative phosphorylation and oxidative metabolism, aiming to assess their interactions and resulting cell functions and pathways that are disturbed in septic patients. Blood samples were obtained from 16 patients with sepsis secondary to community acquired pneumonia at admission (D 0), and after 7 days (D 7, N = 10) of therapy. Samples were also collected from 8 healthy volunteers who were matched according to age and gender. Gene expression of 84 genes was performed by real-time polymerase chain reactions. Their expression was considered up- or down-regulated when the fold change was greater than 1. 5 compared to the healthy volunteers. A p-value of ≤ 0. 05 was considered significant. Twenty-two genes were differently expressed in D 0 samples; {{most of them were}} down-regulated. When gene expression was analyzed according to the outcomes, higher number of altered genes and a higher intensity in the disturbance was observed in non-survivor than in survivor patients. The canonical pathways altered in D 0 samples included interferon and iNOS signaling; the role of JAK 1, JAK 2 and TYK 2 in interferon signaling; mitochondrial dysfunction; and superoxide radical degradation pathways. When analyzed according to outcomes, different pathways were disturbed <b>in</b> surviving and <b>non-surviving</b> patients. Mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative phosphorylation and superoxide radical degradation pathway were among the most altered <b>in</b> <b>non-surviving</b> patients.

Methods: We performed a prospective, observational, multicenter study in six Spanish Intensive Care Units with 297 severe septic patients. We measured RDW, serum levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) to assess oxidative stress, and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) -a to assess inflammation at days 1, 4, and 8. The end-point was 30 -day mortality. Results: We found higher RDW <b>in</b> <b>non-surviving</b> (n = 104) than in surviving (n = 193) septic patients at day 1 (p = 0. 001), day 4 (p = 0. 001), and day 8 (p = 0. 002) of ICU admission. Cox regression analyses showed that RDW at day 1 (p, 0. 001), 4 (p = 0. 005) and 8 (p = 0. 03) were associated with 30 -day mortality. Receiver operating characteristic curves showed that RDW at day 1 (p, 0. 001), 4 (p, 0. 001), and 8 (p, 0. 001) could be used to predict 30 -day mortality.

30|$|The {{association}} {{that we have}} found between increased serum TAC levels and mortality in patients with severe MMCAI could seem initially counterintuitive because improved protection against oxidative processes would instead protect the brain against reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced damage.

We postulate that non-surviving MMCAI patients display higher serum TAC levels to compensate the higher ROS production, as it was observed by our group in severe septic patients [21] and in patients with severe traumatic brain injury [22]; thus, non-surviving patients showed higher serum levels of TAC and MDA than surviving patients.|$|R

Patients were divided into surviving and <b>non-surviving</b> <b>groups,</b> and the data elicited were subjected to statistical comparisons. Results: The mean age of the 18 patients diagnosed with NMS was 46. 9 Â Â±Â  4. 8 years, and 50 % were women. In addition to antipsychotics among the drugs leading to NMS, the syndrome also developed as a result of levodopa withdrawal in three patients and metoclopramide use in one patient. Statistically significant differences were determined between the surviving and <b>non-surviving</b> patients <b>in</b> terms of blood pressure, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatine kinase (CK) and mean platelet volume (MPV) values (pÂ â¤Â  0. 05). Conclusion: In this study the most common agent that cause NMS was atypical antipsychotics. Also advanced age, increased blood pressure and serum CK, BUN and MPV values were identified as potential risk factors for mortality in NMS...|$|R
40|$|Background: Acute {{exacerbations}} {{of chronic}} obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) impose a considerable burden of morbidity, mortality, {{and health care}} cost and frequently require hospital admission. Clinicians lack a validated tool for risk stratification of such admissions. Aim: To find the best prognostic score for prediction of in-hospital mortality due to AECOPD by comparing between the DECAF, the modified DECAF, the BAP- 65 and the 2008 scores. Methods: 264 patients admitted to Chest Department, Menoufia University Hospitals for management of AECOPD were included; either retrospectively from January 2014 to February 2015 or prospectively from March to September 2015. The 4 scores were calculated for each of them. Results: Twenty patients (7. 58 %) died during their hospital stay. The <b>non-surviving</b> <b>group</b> had a statistically significant higher age, all were males and 19 of them were smokers. The DECAF score had an area under receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0. 828, its sensitivity was 0. 8, while its specificity was 0. 623. The AUROC of the modified DECAF score was 0. 774, its sensitivity and specificity were 0. 8 and 0. 443 respectively. The BAP score had the highest AUROC (0. 861), its sensitivity and specificity were 0. 8 and 0. 951 respectively. The 2008 score had an AUROC of 0. 774, its sensitivity and specificity were 1 and 0. 279 respectively. Conclusion: BAP-score had higher AUROC and was more accurate in predicting in-hospital mortality than DECAF, modified DECAF and the 2008 scores...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Higher {{circulating}} {{levels of}} tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMP) - 1 {{at the time}} of severe sepsis diagnosis have been reported in nonsurviving than in surviving patients. However, the following questions remain unanswered: 1) Does TIMP- 1 /MMP- 9 ratio differ throughout the first week of intensive care between surviving and non-surviving patients? 2) Is there an association between TIMP- 1 /MMP- 9 ratio and sepsis severity and mortality during such period? 3) Could TIMP- 1 /MMP- 9 ratio during the first week be used as an early biomarker of sepsis outcome? 4) Is there an association between TIMP- 1 /MMP- 9 ratio and coagulation state and circulating cytokine levels {{during the first week of}} intensive care in these patients? The present study sought to answer these questions. Methods: Multicenter, observational and prospective study carried out in six Spanish Intensive Care Units (ICUs) of 295 patients with severe sepsis.

40|$|This study {{identified}} 14 adjustment strategies {{employed by}} household and business managers {{to cope with}} overlapping work and family demands using data from 1997 and 2000 versions of the National Family Business Survey (NFBS). Significant {{differences were found between}} surviving small family firms by managerial role (single or dual) regarding gross income, gender, number of children under age 18, community size and trade sector. Both surviving and non-surviving enterprises tended to bring household work to the business field when times were hectic and demanding, and took care of family responsibilities while at the business. However, <b>in</b> <b>non-surviving</b> businesses, business managers reported a greater tendency to bring work home, demonstrating that work entered the family field more frequently than in surviving businesses.

40|$|SUMMARY Human atheromatous {{material}} was {{injected into the}} cerebral vasculature of anaesthetized rabbits via the left common carotid artery. The lethality of varying dosages was determined and the distribution and general character of occlusive vascular lesions which developed were analyzed by light and transmission electron microscopy. It was found that a dose exceeding 55 mg of the atheramatous material (125 mg/nil saline) was lethal in New Zealand white male rabbits weighing between 3 and 5 kg. <b>In</b> <b>non-surviving</b> animals, parts of the Circle of Willis and usually {{one or more of}} its major tributaries were occluded. Some surviving animals exhibited signs of neurologic deficit evidenced by motor dysfunction. Occlusive vascular lesions found in surviving animals were predominently localized in ipselateral cortical and subcortical vessels within the distribution territory of the middle cerebral artery. The character of occlusive lesions showed strong evidence of thrombosis. These results demonstrated that this experimental system may be useful {{as a model for the}} study of blood-atheroembolic vascular reactions, cerebral infarc-tion development and the testing of agents potentially prophylactic against the development or stabilization of occlusive lesions.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundGlasgow Coma Scale (GCS) {{remains a}} key measure in {{neurological}} assessment after head injury {{and in most}} studies classification {{of the severity of}} the trauma is still based on the admission GCS. The aim of the workThe aim of the work was to correlate between Jugular venous oxygen saturation (Sjvo 2) with GCS in cases with severe traumatic brain injury. Patients and methodsA 44 patients met the inclusion criteria, were included in the present study. They were selected from the neurosurgical and intensive care units at Al-Azhar University hospital during the period from June 2010 till June 2012. All therapeutic interventions were performed in accordance with Guidelines for the Management of Severe Traumatic Brain Injury. The following variables were collected: patients’ demographics, Sjvo 2, ICP, MAP, CPP and GCS. All pressures were monitored invasively and with identical transducers connected to monitors, and expressed numerically in mmHg. Measurements were always performed at 8. 00 a. m. At the same time, patients were neurologically examined and these data were expressed as GCS score. ResultsThere was statistically significant increase of GCS, MAP, CPP, Sjvo 2 and Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOSE) and decrease of ICP in survived <b>in</b> comparison to <b>non-survived</b> cases. <b>In</b> survived cases, there was positive significant correlation between Sjvo 2 and GCS, MAP, CPP and GOSE, while there was significant negative correlation with ICT. On the other hand, <b>in</b> <b>non-survived</b> cases, there was only positive moderate, significant correlation between Sjvo 2 and GCS. Running simple linear regression analysis, only GCS and Sjvo 2 can predict mortality in studied cases. ConclusionResults of the present study proved that, Sjvo 2 is proportionally correlated with GCS and both can predict the prognosis of severe traumatic injury...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{evaluate}} whether pulse pressure (PP) in elderly people is a better predictor of coronary mortality than systolic and diastolic blood pressure taken alone. For this aim, 3282 elderly subjects aged >or= 65 years were studied in a population-based frame. Blood pressure was repeatedly measured and averaged; historical data, anthropometrics, blood tests and 14 -year coronary mortality were recorded. Statistics included analysis of covariance, Cox analysis and bivariate vectorial analysis. Coronary mortality in women was predicted by PP (1. 01 excess risk/mm Hg PP) and was significantly higher in the 3 rd than in the 1 st tertile of PP (relative risk 2. 90); neither systolic nor diastolic pressure taken alone influenced mortality. When systolic and diastolic pressures were both entered into a Cox model, the former had a positive and the latter {{a negative effect on}} survival, confirming a prognostic role of PP. For any given level of systolic pressure, mortality was inversely associated with diastolic pressure. Finally, the mean vector representing both systolic and diastolic pressures of non-surviving women was characterised by higher systolic and lower diastolic components than <b>in</b> <b>non-surviving.</b> No significant trend of mortality in relation to either systolic blood pressure or PP was observed in men. In conclusion, the combination of systolic and diastolic pressure called PP is an independent predictor of coronary mortality in elderly females, and a better predictor than systolic or diastolic pressure alone...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this pilot}} study was to {{investigate}} variability of oxidative stress during sepsis evolution. ICU patients with the diagnosis of septic shock were included. Thiobarbituric-acid reactive substances, total antioxidant capacity, protein carbonyls in plasma, reduced, oxidized glutathione and catalase activity in erythrocyte lysate were assessed in the 1 st, 3 rd, 5 th and 8 th day after sepsis appearance. A total of 17 patients were divided in two groups: survivors (n = 7) and non-survivors (n = 10). APACHE II was 11. 5 +/- 5. 4 and 19. 9 +/- 4. 97 in survivors and non-survivors respectively (p = 0. 005), while mean age and SOFA score at sepsis diagnosis, were similar between the two groups. GSH levels, catalase activity and protein carbonyls presented significant different course in time between survivors and non-survivors (p < 0. 05). Catalase activity was significantly higher in survivors (238. 8 +/- 51. 5) than non-survivors (166. 4 +/- 40. 2; p = 0. 005), while protein carbonyls levels were significantly lower in survivors (0. 32 +/- 0. 09) than non-survivors (0. 48 +/- 0. 16; p = 0. 036) on the 1 st day. Yet, non-survivors exhibited a declining course in GSH levels during time, while GSH levels were maintained in survivors. Conclusively, a longstanding antioxidant deficiency <b>in</b> <b>non-surviving</b> patients was noted. This phenomenon was clearly prominent in patients' erythrocytes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This was performed under fresh (resting) conditions and after incubation for 6 h without (unstimulated) and with (stimulated) Escherichia coli endotoxin. The malignant groups showed higher mTF levels than {{each of the three}} controls for resting (P < 0. 05 breast, P < 0. 05 colorectal) unstimulated (P < 0. 05 breast, P < 0. 05 colorectal) and stimulated cells (P < 0. 001 breast, P < 0. 01 colorectal). Similarly, the benign inflammatory groups had higher mTF levels than controls for resting (P < 0. 05 colorectal), unstimulated (P < 0. 05 colorectal) and stimulated cells (P < 0. 01 breast, P < 0. 01 colorectal). There {{was no significant difference between}} malignant and benign inflammatory groups in each organ. mTF levels showed an increase corresponding to that of histological tumour progression and were higher <b>in</b> <b>non-surviving</b> patients. <b>In</b> conclusion, mTF levels are raised in malignant and inflammatory disease compared to controls and patients with non-inflammatory conditions.

Our previous study revealed circulating levels of amino-terminal fragment of laminin γ 2 -chain (G 2 F) reflect epithelial tumor invasiveness in carcinoma patients, but its physiological role in alveolar epithelial injury remains unknown. Sampling of epithelial lining fluids or pulmonary edema fluids from patients with acute lung injury (ALI) or related diseases was performed. Plasma samples were obtained from {{them at the time}} of disease onset or later. G 2 F concentrations were determined by immunoassay constructed by ourselves. We found a significantly higher amount of G 2 F in pulmonary edema and epithelial lining fluids of patients with ALI, as compared with those with the other respiratory diseases. Their plasma levels were also elevated significantly early at the onset of ALI (mean ± SD; 147  ±  82  ng/ml <b>in</b> <b>non-surviving</b> and 90  ±  56 in surviving patients) as compared with those in the patients with cardiogenic pulmonary edema (59  ±  36) or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (37  ±  17), indicating alveolar epithelium rapidly secrete laminin- 5 in ALI. At 5  days after onset, non-surviving patients maintained higher plasma concentrations (152  ±  84), but in contrast, the levels in surviving patients declined (71  ±  35), suggesting secretion of laminin- 5 was suppressed, associated with recovery from ALI.

Objectives We aimed to determine mortality rate and its main indicators among premature neonates in our region with the aim of making good decisions to improve public health and reduce neonatal mortality. Patients and Methods Four-hundred and ninety-two consecutive premature neonates hospitalized in neonatal intensive care unit entered this cross-sectional study. The study information was extracted from hospital recorded files. Results Neonatal death rate was overall 27. 4 %, which was significantly higher in gestational age subgroup of less than 28 weeks compared with other gestational age subgroups. The most prevalent etiologies of neonatal death were respiratory distress syndrome (73. 8 %), congenital abnormalities (13. 8 %) and sepsis (5. 4 %), respectively. Preeclampsia and history of multiple pregnancies were more prevalent <b>in</b> <b>non-survived</b> neonates. According to multivariable regression modeling, low gestational age, low birth weight, low Apgar scores, need for intensive supports, history of disease in mother, occurrence of pneumothorax, multiple gestation and preeclampsia could all strongly predict occurrence of death in premature infants. Conclusions Approximately one quarter of premature neonates had early mortality, which can be predicted by low gestational age, low birth weight, low Apgar score, need to intensive supports, postpartum complications, multiple gestation and history of maternal illnesses...|$|R
40|$|Capture of {{wildlife}} {{often leads to}} high animal mortality. In many species, capture is associated with development of a high body temperature. This stress-induced hyperthermia appears to form {{an integral part of}} capture-related mortalities, since it occurs before, during and after exposure to capture. I used two wildlife species, impala and blesbok, and exposed them to darting and net capture so as to investigate thermal and haematological changes that occur during capture. We implanted the animals with temperature-sensitive data loggers within the abdominal cavity (for core body temperature) and caudal aspect of the thigh (for muscle temperature). Activity loggers were tethered to the abdominal wall to measure locomotor activity. Blood samples were taken after capture when the animal became recumbent and another sample 10 minutes after the first sample in order to determine haematological changes. Impala had higher abdominal body temperatures during net capture in comparison to darting, whereas blesbok abdominal body temperatures did not differ between capture methods. Different species and individuals of the same species respond differently to various capture procedures. However, I found that irrespective of the capture event or whether impala or blesbok were captured, human presence before capture caused abdominal body temperatures to rise. Similar to thermal responses, there also was high variability between individuals in terms of blood variable concentrations used to quantify physiological responses to capture. Overall, blood variable changes (total protein, sodium, lactate, haematocrit, noradrenaline, adrenaline, potassium, creatine phosphokinase, pH) were similar for impala and blesbok in response to the two capture procedures. Cortisol values in blesbok however showed a greater response during darting whereas impala showed a greater response during net capture. Similarly, osmolality values showed a greater response during net capture whereas impala showed a greater response during darting. Both the species showed that sodium and lactate correlated positively as well as noradrenaline and adrenaline correlated positively. The correlation between two variables allows us to measure only one of the variables, predicting the change of another. Unpredictable differences in thermal and blood variable measurements of impala and blesbok between different capture procedures did not allow me to correlate the thermal responses after a capture event to stress-related blood variables. The issue of obtaining a practical and accurate measurement of the hyperthermic response during capture also often arises. Rectal temperature is currently the method of choice to determine body temperature in the field. I aimed to investigate whether muscle temperature measurement {{can be used as a}}n alternative body temperature measurement in the field. When abdominal core body temperatures were high, muscle temperature measurements were close to and even slightly higher than the abdominal body temperature measurements in both the species. However, low abdominal body temperatures, muscle temperature measurements were at lower and much less accurate in predicting abdominal body temperatures. Muscle temperatures can therefore predict abdominal body temperatures with sufficient accuracy during a capture event, since animals respond to capture with elevated body temperatures thus increasing the similarity between the abdominal and muscle temperature measurements measured. One potential problem with muscle temperature, is that it may reflect exercise-induced temperature increases during capture, independently of a rise in abdominal body temperature. I found that the rise in muscle temperature was not only a result of the increase in activity during a capture event but rather as a result of stress-induced hyperthermia. The increase in activity only contributes to the overall hyperthermia of the animal. The degree to which stress-induced hyperthermia contributes to mortality during capture is unclear. During my study, five impala died unexpectedly. Four impala died during the first trial while the fifth impala died before the completion of the last trial. I therefore compared the hyperthermic and haematological changes <b>in</b> surviving and <b>non-surviving</b> individuals. Both non-surviving and surviving impala in my study showed a rise in abdominal body temperature during the capture however the highest abdominal body temperatures occurred in individuals in both the surviving and <b>non-surviving</b> <b>group.</b> Very high abdominal body temperatures greater than 41 ºC and 43 ºC occurred in individuals of both the non-surviving and surviving animals, respectively. Some animals with an abdominal body temperature of 43 ºC, therefore survived whereas other individuals died when experiencing abdominal body temperature of less than 41 ºC. Blood variable responses (Creatine phosphokinase, glucose, potassium, calcium, sodium, lactate, osmolality, noradrenaline, adrenaline, pH) of the non-surviving individuals showed high values in comparison to the blood variable measurements of the surviving group. The blood variable measurements were however sampled late which will affect the measurements but can still be used to predicted mortality <b>in</b> the <b>non-surviving</b> impala. The blood variable measurements therefore were associated with mortality <b>in</b> the <b>non-surviving</b> impala. <b>In</b> conclusion, whether stress-induced hyperthermia can be used as a sole measure to identify a compromised individual during a capture event and concomitantly enable us to give appropriate treatment is unclear. It is evident from my study that capture induced a hyperthermic response in excitable impala as well as in the much less excitable blesbok. My study is one of few systematic studies on capture stress and shows that body temperature used in conjunction with other parameters may be useful in estimating the degree of stress in captured animals, and thus predicting likelihood of mortality or morbidity. My study also revealed that muscle temperature, possibly measured in the field by a needle-stab method, may provide an index of core body temperature...|$|R
40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{described}} reduced plasma concentrations of arginine, the substrate for {{nitric oxide synthase}} (NOS) in infants with necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). No information on the plasma concentrations of the endogenous NOS inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) in patients with NEC is currently available. We investigated whether plasma concentrations of arginine, ADMA, and their ratio differ between premature infants with and without NEC, and between survivors and non-survivors within the NEC group. In a prospective case-control study, arginine and ADMA concentrations were measured in ten premature infants with NEC (median gestational age 193 d, birth weight 968 g), and ten matched control infants (median gestational age 201 d, birth weight 1102 g), who were admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. In the premature infants with NEC, median arginine and ADMA concentrations (micromol/l), and the arginine:ADMA ratio were lower compared to the infants without NEC: 21. 4 v. 55. 9, P= 0. 001; 0. 59 v. 0. 85, P= 0. 009 and 36. 6 v. 72. 3, P= 0. 023 respectively.

We sought to evaluate the behavior and diagnostic utility of procalcitonin, C-reactive protein and four other molecules in patients with suspected 2009 Influenza A H 1 N 1 infection. METHODS: The serum levels of procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor &# 945;, interferon &# 947;, interleukin 1 &# 946;, and interleukin 10 were tested on admission and on days 3, 5, and 7 in 35 patients with suspected 2009 H 1 N 1 infection who were admitted to two ICUs. RESULTS: Twelve patients had confirmed 2009 influenza A H 1 N 1 infections, 6 had seasonal influenza infections, and 17 patients had negative swabs. The procalcitonin levels at inclusion and on day 3, and the C-reactive protein levels on day 3 were higher among subjects with 2009 influenza A H 1 N 1 infections. The baseline levels of interleukin 1 b were higher among the 2009 influenza A H 1 N 1 patients compared with the other groups. The C-reactive protein levels on days 3, 5, and 7 and procalcitonin on days 5 and 7 were greater <b>in</b> <b>non-surviving</b> patients.

Hyperbaric oxygen {{treatment}} (HBO 2) has been shown to alter the inflammatory response during sepsis and to reduce mortality. A therapeutic window of HBO 2 treatment has been demonstrated experimentally, but optimal timing remains uncertain.

Method Fifty-five male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent CLP and were randomized to the following groups: 1) HBO 2 2. 5  bar absolute pressure (pabs); 2) NBO 2 1. 0  bar pabs; 3) Control (no-treatment), and they were individually monitored for 72  h with intermittent blood sampling. Results IL- 6, TNF-α, and IL- 10 were increased 24  h after the procedure, and IL- 6 was significantly higher in non-survivors than in survivors. The level of IL- 10 was significantly higher at hour 48 in the HBO 2 group compared to control (p[*]=[*] 0. 01), but {{this was not the case}} at other time points.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Additional {{biomarkers}} in sepsis {{are needed}} to tackle the challenges of determining prognosis and optimizing selection of high-risk patients for application of therapy. In the present study, conducted in a cohort of medical intensive care unit patients, {{our aim was to}} compare the prognostic value of mid-regional pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) levels with those of other biomarkers and physiological scores. METHODS: Blood samples obtained in a prospective observational study conducted in 101 consecutive critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit were analyzed. The prognostic value of pro-ANP levels was compared with that of the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score and with those of various biomarkers (i. e. C-reactive protein, IL- 6 and procalcitonin). Mid-regional pro-ANP was detected in EDTA plasma from all patients using a new sandwich immunoassay. RESULTS: On admission, 53 patients had sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock, and 68 had systemic inflammatory response syndrome. The median pro-ANP value in the survivors was 194 pmol/l (range 20 - 2000 pmol/l), which was significantly lower than in the nonsurvivors (median 853. 0 pmol/l, range 100 - 2000 pmol/l; P > 0. 001). On the day of admission, pro-ANP levels, but not levels of other biomarkers, were significantly higher <b>in</b> <b>non-surviving</b> [corrected] than <b>in</b> surviving [corrected] sepsis patients (P = 0. 001). In a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis for the survival of patients with sepsis, the area under the curve (AUC) for pro-ANP was 0. 88, which was significantly greater than the AUCs for procalcitonin and C-reactive protein, and similar to the AUC for the APACHE II score. CONCLUSION: Pro-ANP appears to be a valuable tool for individual risk assessment in sepsis patients and for stratification of high-risk patients in future intervention trials. Further studies {{are needed to}} validate our results...|$|R
