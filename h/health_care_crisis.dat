40|$|Hollywood 1980 s {{films are}} so {{distinctive}} {{that we can}} identify them immediately, partly for their aesthetic but mostly for their mood, for the reassuring tone of family-centered stories with clear moral lessons. These kinds of films provided reassuring dramas {{in the midst of}} cultural unrest and political uncertainty. The 1980 s were an era of major transformations: increased immigration and transit across the border, the rise of globalization, military defense build-up, the waning of the Cold War, and the US-backed wars in Central America. It was a time troubled by the recent past of the Vietnam War, Watergate, assassinations of public figures, and the revolution in social attitudes wrought by the civil rights era, feminism, gay and lesbian rights, and by the <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>crises</b> related to HIV/AIDS and Medicare/Medicaid. Hollywood border films are symptoms of this cultural morass; they stage immigrant disruptions to national identity in story lines drawn from a cinematic repertoire of “American ” good guys: vigilantes, cowboys, and buddy cops. The bad guys are the male border crossers who infiltrate the national body as carriers of cultural, economic, and political ills. These Hollywood narratives provide or suggest solutions that double as fantasmatic resolutions and templates for public policy. Several border films work together to form a coherent cultural response to crises of the 1980 s: Borderline (1980) with Charles Bronson...|$|R

This clearly demonstrates that when utilization is contingent on financing, changes can occur rapidly; and that an integrated approach is required when monitoring equity. From a policy perspective, the Argentine health system appears vulnerable to economic downturns mainly due to high reliance on out-of-pocket payments and the strong link between health insurance and employment. <b>Health</b> <b>care</b> financing Income redistribution <b>Health</b> <b>care</b> utilization Economic <b>crisis</b> Argentina...|$|R

40|$|AIM: To explore carers' {{experience}} of caring during {{a mental health}} crisis. BACKGROUND: Community mental <b>health</b> <b>care</b> including <b>crisis</b> <b>care</b> relies increasingly on carers. The relationship between carers and professionals is at times fraught due to issues {{of what constitutes a}} crisis, confidentiality and a perception of lack of empathy. The caring experience can lead carers to feel isolated and neglected. DESIGN: A qualitative study with a phenomenological approach. Eight carers participated and were interviewed individually using a semi-structured approach. METHOD: Analysis used the Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis method including transcribing of interviews, initial noting, searching for connections and patterns across the transcripts and cases. The themes were checked with the participants for their views on the emerging themes. The data were collected from November 2011 -May 2012. FINDINGS: Carers experienced 'double deprivation' by not receiving support from professionals and protecting their social network from the trauma of the <b>crisis.</b> The <b>caring</b> in <b>crisis</b> invoked complex feelings of guilt and loyalty which made discussing aggression difficult. Caring was described as a terrifying experience {{not just because of the}} aggression but also because of the perception of abandonment by professionals. CONCLUSION: The experience was an overwhelmingly negative one with a wish for acknowledgement of the crisis and support from mental health services. For most of the participants the <b>caring</b> during <b>crisis</b> was traumatic which left the carer feeling isolated and unsupported. The study should be used to help educate professionals on the complexities of <b>caring</b> during a <b>crisis...</b>|$|R
