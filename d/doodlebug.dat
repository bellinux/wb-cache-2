50|$|<b>Doodlebugs</b> {{sometimes}} pulled an unpowered trailer car, {{but were}} more often used singularly. They were popular with some railroads {{during the first}} part of the 20th century to provide passenger and mail service on lightly used branch lines, obviating the need to operate conventional trains consisting of a locomotive and coaches. Several railroads, mostly small regional and local networks, provided their main passenger services through <b>doodlebugs</b> in a cost cutting effort.|$|R
25|$|The first diesel {{locomotive}} {{to operate in}} regular service in Michigan arrived in 1938. It was Grand Trunk Western 7800 an EMC SC switching locomotive to work in Detroit. Previously in 1925 GTW acquired from EMC an early motorized gas-electric railcar known as a <b>Doodlebug.</b> The cars were self-propelled units resembling a passenger car with a baggage compartment and a coach section for passengers that GTW used on its Detroit to Port Huron and Richmond to Jackson routes until 1953. GTW also had another gas-electric locomotive {{referred to as a}} box-cab built by Brill in 1926. Originally built for the Long Island Rail Road, GTW purchased it in 1934 and numbered it 7730. It was relegated to loading and unloading freight cars from GTW ferries in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The unit was eventually converted to diesel power in 1939 and served in Milwaukee until 1960.|$|E

He also made a third short, <b>Doodlebug</b> (1997), about a man chasing an insect around a flat with a shoe, only to discover when killing it {{that it is a}} miniature of himself. During this period of his career, Nolan had little or no success getting his projects off the ground; he later recalled the [...] "stack of rejection letters" [...] that greeted his early forays into making films, adding [...] "there's a very limited pool of finance in the UK. To be honest, it's a very clubby kind of place... Never had any support whatsoever from the British film industry." ...|$|E

The world's first public broadcasts of (then) [...] "high-definition" [...] television were made from Alexandra Palace in 1936, an event which is alluded to by the rays in the modern coat of arms of the London Borough of Haringey. Two competing systems, Marconi-EMI's 405-line system and John Logie Baird's 240-line system, were installed, {{each with its own}} broadcast studio and were transmitted on alternate weeks until the 405-line system was chosen in 1937. The palace continued as the BBC's main transmitting centre for London until 1956, interrupted only by the Second World War when the transmitter found an alternative use jamming German bombers' navigation systems. In 1944 a German <b>doodlebug</b> exploded just outside the organ end of the Great Hall and blew in the Rose Window, leaving the organ exposed to the elements.|$|E

Many Sperry cars were created by rebuilding existing railway cars, particularly <b>doodlebugs.</b>|$|R
5|$|The antlions are a {{group of}} about 2,000 species of insect in the family Myrmeleontidae, known for the {{fiercely}} predatory habits of their larvae, which in many species dig pits to trap passing ants or other prey.

50|$|The <b>Doodlebug</b> was {{produced}} {{too late to}} compete, but was granted an exemption. The aircraft's tail folded upward in initial demonstrations at Mitchel Field in New York, and allowed more extensions to repair damages. After a forced landing due to engine failure, the <b>Doodlebug</b> missed {{the opportunity to be}} judged in the competition. The winner of the competition was a Curtiss Tanager.
