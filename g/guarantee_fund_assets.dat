40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{possibility}} of hedging discrete stochastic jumps and their tradeoffs in <b>guaranteed</b> <b>funds</b> under discrete dynamic hedging. Since a <b>guaranteed</b> <b>fund</b> price process is composed of diffusion and jump process, its expected rate of return is above the risk-free rate of interest. When delta dynamic hedging occurs at discrete instants, the rate differential will be manifested in non-zero expected hedging errors. We employ the dynamic <b>guaranteed</b> <b>fund</b> as our example, whose exotic fund structure excludes {{the possibility of}} static hedge. We derive a pricing model and develop hedging formulas for discrete dynamic <b>guaranteed</b> <b>funds.</b> We show our discrete-time delta hedging formulas induce smaller hedging errors than those based on applying the continuous-time hedging formula of Gerber and Pafumi (2000) at discrete instants. Nevertheless, this discrete-time model still incurs significant negative expected hedging errors induced partly by the guarantee jumps. We introduce a gamma-adjusted delta hedging strategy. The simulation {{results indicate that the}} strategy can effectively improve the discrete hedging performance of dynamic <b>guaranteed</b> <b>funds.</b> ...|$|R

Analysis of the functioning UFG and BFG shows that their diversed activities are needed to strengthen the protection of customers of both banking and insurance sector, particularly during the crisis in the economy. Organizational and financial effort bore in order to create mechanisms (such as <b>guarantee</b> <b>funds)</b> protecting clients potentially produces benefits.
