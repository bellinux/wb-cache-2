5000|$|During {{his time}} as sheriff, Riser seemed {{repeatedly}} {{at odds with the}} Webster Parish Police Jury, the parish governing body akin to the county commission in most other states. The dispute centered over the housing and reimbursement of the costs of prisoners. Riser accused the police jury of not paying its bills after the jurors offered barely half of what the sheriff said was owed. The police jury, led by its president, Charles Roger [...] "Charlie" [...] Walker, Sr. (1931-2015) of Doyline, subsequently sued Riser, whom it accused of allowing his employees and <b>inmate</b> <b>crews</b> to sabotage the vacant parish penal farm; the damages rendered the facility inoperable for further use as a jail.Josh Beavers, former publisher of the Minden Press-Herald, said that Walker handled the controversy with Riser fairly: [...] "Through all of the turmoil, I never felt like Mr. Walker was trying to be subversive. He was always honest, always open." ...|$|R
500|$|Following the {{hurricane}} in North Carolina, 10 counties were declared federal disaster areas, while 30 counties became eligible for public and individual assistance. Shelters were opened in 11 counties, and the Raleigh-Durham International Airport briefly canceled all flights. To remove {{the tens of}} thousands of tires that washed ashore, hundreds of inmates from state prisons were sent to the Bouge Banks. Some of the tires were buried in sand, and could only be removed during low tide. About 700 more state prisoners were sent around the state to clear debris, and 39 <b>inmate</b> <b>crews</b> were deployed to help farmers salvage the severely damaged tobacco fields. In South Carolina, Horry County was declared a federal disaster area due to the damage. In Virginia, the cities of Chesapeake, Norfolk, Portsmouth, Suffolk, and Virginia Beach became eligible for individual and public assistance programs. After the storm's departure, a thunderstorm temporarily halted power restoration by Virginia Power company crews. Virginia Governor Jim Gilmore allowed for over $11million (1998 USD) in state and federal funds to help five cities recover. The storm also contributed to a 13.6% decline in home sales across the southern United States during the month of August by [...] "discouraging potential home buyers" [...] in coastal areas.|$|R

5000|$|Throughout the negotiations, {{there was}} {{leadership}} and organization among the prisoners. Frank [...] "Big Black" [...] Smith was appointed {{as head of}} security, and he also kept the hostages and the observers safe. Additionally, an ardent orator, 21-year-old Elliott James [...] "L.D." [...] Barkley, was a strong force during the negotiations, speaking with great articulation to the <b>inmates,</b> the camera <b>crews,</b> and outsiders at home.

50|$|On September 3, {{officials}} {{announced that the}} Station Fire was caused by arson and that a homicide investigation had been initiated because of {{the deaths of the}} firefighters involved. Investigators discovered a substance at the fire's point of origin which they believe may have accelerated the flames. The two firefighters, supervisors of <b>inmate</b> fire <b>crews</b> (jointly operated by the Los Angeles County Fire Department and California Department of Corrections), had been conducting ignition operations in order to protect personnel and Mt Gleason Camp 16 from the advancing fire front. As of September 15, $93.8 million (US) had been spent fighting the fire at 91% contained with full containment by September 19. It was 100% contained at 7:00 pm PST on Friday, October 16, 2009, due to moderate rainfall. Property owners and concerned citizens are demanding a formal Congressional investigation as to why the U.S. Forest Service did not contain the fire within the first 48 hours when it was manageable. To date there has been no rigorous casual evidence broght forth, showing a breech of duty by Fire Managment Officials. At 160557 acre, the Station Fire is the 10th largest in modern California history, and the largest wildfire in the modern history of Los Angeles County, passing the 105000 acre Clampitt Fire of September 1970.|$|R
5000|$|Now awake, and {{apparently}} {{possessed by the}} ship's dead captain, Ashland dons an officer's uniform from the Kriegsmarine and announces {{that he is the}} captain.

40|$|Report {{completed}} by the Workforce Capacity Work Group for the 2004 Oregon Fire Program Review. Technical editing by the Institute for Natural Resources at Oregon State UniversityFor a variety of reasons, the Oregon Department of Forestry (ODF) Protection from Fire Program is facing growing difficulties in maintaining an adequate wildfire workforce. The Workforce Capacity Workgroup was formed {{as part of the}} 2004 Oregon Fire Program Review. The goal of the workgroup was to review workforce capacity issues and recommend strategies to ensure that adequate numbers of qualified and experienced personnel are available to supervise and perform the essential tasks of the ODF Protection from Fire Program fire prevention and suppression system. Issues were identified and recommendations made for each of the following objectives: 1. Review opportunities to ensure, enhance and support the continued use of local landowner and operator resources through establishment of appropriate Administratively Determined (AD) use and rates, qualification standards and provisions for training for local area deployment. 2. Review pilot projects and prototypes currently in place and make recommendations for improvement and expanded use of local overhead resources used at the district level on a statewide basis. 3. Review opportunities to enhance relationships and effective utilization of resources from rural fire departments, rangeland protective associations, Oregon National Guard, etc. 4. Review and modify as needed current policies and direction and make recommendations for effective utilization of contracted firefighting resources in addition to interagency agreements. 5. Review current policies and direct making recommendations for continued and expanded effective utilization of <b>inmate</b> firefighting <b>crews.</b> 6. Review current policies and direction to enhance ODF workforce for firefighting or fire support through sound policies, cost efficient training and fire overhead succession management. 7. Review and make recommendations for full utilization of the Northwest Wildland Fire Protection Agreement (Northwest Compact). HIGHEST Priority Recommendations 1. Adopt the 8 -hour Non-Agency Single Resource Boss Program as the statewide ODF standard for non-agency personnel. 2. Review and update the Protection Training & Certification Manual and require only the training, qualifications and fitness standards necessary for each Incident Command System (ICS) position. 3. Identify the critical shortage of ICS positions on a statewide level, and develop and implement a mitigation plan. 4. Strengthen and clarify the responsibility of all ODF employees to participate in the complete and coordinated protection system in an active or supporting role. 5. Provide adequate funding and staffing for effective administration of the Interagency Crew Agreement...|$|R
