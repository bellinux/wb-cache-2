His father Thomas John [...] "Jack" [...] Burge was a {{salesman}} who rose to be a <b>departmental</b> <b>manager</b> of D. & W.

40|$|The Swedish law {{tells us}} that {{employers}} and co-workers are responsible to encourage gender equality work {{in order to make}} equal opportunities for both women and men in the Swedish work force. Different organizations have different conditions to change and the gender equality work {{is an example of a}} work of change. Previous research shows that gender equality work come across opposition in several ways. The aim of this study is to explain how <b>departmental</b> <b>managers</b> in care units work with gender equality and furthermore how the organization gives them conditions to do so. The question I aim to answer is: How is the <b>departmental</b> <b>managers</b> gender equality work influenced by the organizations particular conditions? To fulfil the aim of the study and answer the question I used a qualitative approach. Four <b>departmental</b> <b>managers</b> in care units were interviewed by means of semi- structured interviews. The material was processed with a thematic approach. I searched for common themes in the interviews and interpreted it with the assistance of select theory. The theories were Göran Ahrnes and Apostolis Papakostas organization theory about mechanisms of rigidity and Yvonne Hirdmans concept gender system. The results of the study show that written gender equality documents make mechanisms of rigidity and contribute to an inability to change. The organizations give the <b>departmental</b> <b>managers</b> capacity to diminish the need of gender equality work by means of shifting in time, category and responsibility. The analysis gives an explanation of the conditions with the assistance of the gender systems involvement in the organizations structure and culture. The conclusion means that the gender system makes the gender-differentiated organization inartificial, and therefore affects the conditions of the <b>departmental</b> <b>managers</b> gender equality work. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between organizational justice (OJ) and turnover intentions (TI) among the lower and middle-level hotel <b>departmental</b> <b>managers.</b>   Organizational justice, comprising three-dimensional measures of distributive justice (DJ), procedural justice (PJ), and interactional justice (IJ) was measured through inferential statistics.   Distributive justice and procedural justice had a significant negative effect on managers’turnover intentions while interactional justice {{did not support the}} proposed relationship. The perceptions of fairness of reward allocation and procedure received in organizations prompt the lower and middle hotel <b>departmental</b> <b>managers</b> to reciprocate their turnover intention behaviour. These research findings offer some insight for the hotel top management into how to prevent their valuable managers from leaving the organization...|$|R

Structural equation analysis of data from <b>departmental</b> <b>managers</b> and employees in China suggested interdepartmental structures promote cooperative but not competitive or independent goals among departments and salient organizational identity, which in turn result in departmental and interdepartmental effectiveness.
