25|$|Mining {{resources}} include lead, copper, chromium, and zinc, {{the reserves}} {{of which are}} almost exhausted. There is {{a considerable amount of}} lignite, however because its ash and sulfur ratios are high, it suitable only for industrial use. Magnesite, fire clay, gypsum, manganese, <b>diatomite,</b> marble, rock salt and perlite are also present. The few natural geothermal resources, except one, are not suitable for economic investments, and they are used as natural springs.|$|E
25|$|Below {{these trees}} the river {{broadens}} into the oddly shaped Kentmere Tarn. A natural waterbody was drained in the 1830s {{to extend the}} available farmland, but the scheme failed and merely resulted {{in an area of}} marsh. It was later found that the tarnbed was rich in <b>diatomite,</b> a mineral used to produce thermal insulation. Extraction began in the 1930s and continued until 1971, producing the lines of the present man-made tarn.|$|E
25|$|The Fur Formation is {{a unit of}} diatomitic {{sediment}} approximately 60 meters thick {{consisting of}} diatoms and clay minerals with up to 180 layers of volcanic ash. In Danish literature the formation has informally {{been referred to as}} the moler (Ler means clay). The <b>diatomite</b> comprises 2/3 opal tests of diatoms and 1/3 clay, interbedded with layers of volcanic ash and a few limestone horizons (‘cementstones’), and has exceptionally complete fossil preservation.|$|E

Silver is a distant second, with [...] worth $69million mined in 2004 (see Silver mining in Nevada). Other minerals mined in Nevada include construction aggregates, copper, gypsum, <b>diatomite</b> and lithium. Despite its rich deposits, the cost of mining in Nevada is generally high, and output is very sensitive to world commodity prices.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} known fossil diatoms {{date from}} the early Jurassic (~185 Ma ago), [...] although the molecular clock and sedimentary evidence suggests an earlier origin. It {{has been suggested that}} their origin {{may be related to the}} end-Permian mass extinction (~250 Ma), after which many marine niches were opened. [...] The gap between this event and the time that fossil diatoms first appear may indicate a period when diatoms were unsilicified and their evolution was cryptic. [...] Since the advent of silicification, diatoms have made a significant impression on the fossil record, with major deposits of fossil diatoms found as far back as the early Cretaceous, and some rocks (diatomaceous earth, <b>diatomite,</b> kieselguhr) being composed almost entirely of them.|$|E

2500|$|The valley used to {{be known}} for its bobbin mills and for Waterfoot factory which dredged the bottom of the Kentmere Tarn in the 1950s searching for <b>diatomite.</b> A water mill was {{established}} by the first Lord of the Manor in 1272. The records state that he had [...] "Liberty granted to erect a mill {{on the banks of the}} River Kent at Ulthwaite, upstream of Croft Head" [...] they also stated that the mill was used to cut the sleepers for the Kendal and Windermere Railway in 1860. The mill was restored in the 1970s and is now a pottery studio producing handmade ceramics. Also, at the Staveley end of the valley, is a photographic paper manufactory known as Kentmere Ltd. A fishery is situated beside the reservoir and every year trout and salmon are released into the River Kent for the benefit of anglers because the river's native population has been diminished.|$|E
