The rising waters of the River Nile (a result {{of the construction of}} the Aswan High Dam) threatened the ancient Abu Simbel temple complex. The entire site was dismantled and reassembled 200 m <b>further</b> <b>from</b> the river, and 65 m higher, at a cost of around US$36 million.|$|E
5|$|As coal was {{extremely}} expensive on the West Coast of the Americas, HMS Zealous generally used her sails and covered more miles under sail {{than any of}} the other Victorian sailing ironclads, and in her whole career never once travelled in company with another ironclad.

5|$|Discussion of the disorganized {{attachment}} style sometimes includes {{this style}} {{under the rubric}} of attachment disorders because disorganized attachment is seen as the beginning of a developmental trajectory that will take the individual ever <b>further</b> <b>from</b> the normal range, culminating in actual disorders of thought, behavior, or mood. Early intervention for disorganized attachment, or other problematic styles, is directed toward changing the trajectory of development to provide a better outcome later in the person's life.|$|E
5|$|Evolving even <b>further</b> <b>from</b> metalcore comes mathcore, a more rhythmically {{complicated}} and progressive style {{brought to light}} by bands such as The Dillinger Escape Plan, Converge, and Protest the Hero.

5|$|Gastroparesis {{is another}} common misdiagnosis. Like {{rumination}} syndrome, patients with gastroparesis often bring up food following the ingestion of a meal. Unlike rumination, gastroparesis causes vomiting (in contrast to regurgitation) of food, {{which is not}} being digested <b>further,</b> <b>from</b> the stomach. This vomiting occurs several hours after a meal is ingested, preceded by nausea and retching, and has the bitter or sour taste typical of vomit.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, the {{strength}} of the American and British bomber fleets had increased. Based in Britain, they began operations against German targets. The first thousand-bomber raid was staged on Cologne on 30 May 1942. Air raids continued on targets <b>further</b> <b>from</b> Britain after auxiliary fuel tanks were installed on American fighter aircraft. Göring refused to believe reports that American fighters had been shot down as far east as Aachen in winter 1943. His reputation began to decline.|$|E
5|$|Neptune has 14 known moons, {{which are}} named for minor water deities in Greek mythology. By {{far the largest}} of them is Triton, {{discovered}} by William Lassell on October 10, 1846, just 17 days after the discovery of Neptune itself; over a century passed before {{the discovery of the}} second natural satellite, Nereid. Neptune's Neso, which has an orbital period of about 26 Julian years, orbits <b>further</b> <b>from</b> its planet than any other moon in the Solar System.|$|E

5|$|Sculptural {{fragments}} to Rodin were autonomous works, and {{he considered}} them {{the essence of}} his artistic statement. His fragments– perhaps lacking arms, legs, or a head– took sculpture <b>further</b> <b>from</b> its traditional role of portraying likenesses, and into a realm where forms existed for their own sake. Notable examples are The Walking Man, Meditation without Arms, and Iris, Messenger of the Gods.|$|E

5|$|Viewers {{of early}} footage {{encouraged}} DiDuro to separate it <b>further</b> <b>from</b> Sonic, so he replaced rings with red leaves and altered the characters' abilities. Ziyo had drawn Lilac as a hedgehog, but DiDuro redesigned the character to be a dragon. Lilac's wall-jump ability {{was based on}} a similar game mechanic from Ristar. Originally, her level of energy was to be dependent on her speed, but this proved too difficult to control.|$|E
5|$|Winds within {{high-pressure}} areas flow {{outward from}} the higher pressure areas near their centers towards the lower pressure areas <b>further</b> <b>from</b> their centers. Gravity adds to the forces causing this general movement, because the higher pressure compresses the column of air {{near the center of}} the area into greater density – and so greater weight compared to lower pressure, lower density, and lower weight of the air outside the center.|$|E
5|$|Aristotle, {{a student}} of Plato, {{observed}} an occultation of Mars by the Moon in 365 BCE. From this he concluded that Mars must lie <b>further</b> <b>from</b> the Earth than the Moon. He noted that other such occultations of stars and planets had been observed by the Egyptians and Babylonians. Aristotle used this observational {{evidence to support the}} Greek sequencing of the planets. His work De Caelo presented a model of the universe in which the Sun, Moon, and planets circle about the Earth at fixed distances. A more sophisticated version of the geocentric model was developed by the Greek astronomer Hipparchus when he proposed that Mars moved along a circular track called the epicycle that, in turn, orbited about the Earth along a larger circle called the deferent.|$|E
