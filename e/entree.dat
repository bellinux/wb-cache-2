5|$|As {{with all}} major fast food vendors, BK has a menu that {{specifically}} targets children. The company introduced its child-oriented product line in North America {{during the summer}} of 1990 with an advertising program called the Burger King Kid's Club. In the United States, the meal is called the Kids Club Meal and it is primarily positioned against the popular Happy Meal from McDonald's. The meal includes an <b>entrée,</b> a side order, beverage, and a toy. The toy is usually a product tie-in with a movie or popular television show.

40|$|Reductions in {{dietary fat}} have been {{recommended}} {{in the prevention}} of coronary heart disease. Because <b>entrees</b> contribute substantially to total meal fat content, we evaluated a cafeteria-based intervention for increasing the purchase rate of low-fat <b>entrees</b> (M = 6. 83 g) relative to nonlow-fat <b>entrees</b> (M = 25. 59 g). The intervention included a poster listing the benefits of a LF diet and the daily LF <b>entrees</b> (i. e., broiled or baked chicken and fish dishes). During 6 days per phase, food selections (N = 3, 264) were monitored by trained observers. The intervention, which cost $ 80. 00, produced significant increases (i. e., from 20 % to 35 %) in the purchase rate of LF <b>entrees...</b>|$|R

In restaurants, fusion cuisine, with the melding of classic cuisines such as French and Japanese with local ingredients has become widespread. In the 2000s, the trend of “eating healthy” {{with an emphasis on}} organic and whole grain foods has become prominent, and medical research has led many Israelis to re-embrace the Mediterranean diet, with its touted health benefits.|$|E
5|$|Le dîner (dinner) often {{consists}} of three courses, hors d'œuvre or <b>entrée</b> (appetizers or introductory course, sometimes soup), plat principal (main course), and a cheese course or dessert, sometimes with a salad offered before the cheese or dessert.

Most {{of the time the}} bread would be a baguette which is very common in France and is made almost every day. Main meat courses are often served with vegetables, along with potatoes, rice or pasta. Restaurants often open at 7:30pm for dinner, and stop taking orders between the hours of 10:00pm and 11:00pm. Some restaurants close for dinner on Sundays.|$|E
5|$|Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year, {{is widely}} celebrated with festive family meals and {{symbolic}} foods. Sweetness {{is the main}} theme and the Rosh Hashana dinners typically begin with apples dipped in honey, and end with honey cake. The challah is usually round, often studded with raisins and drizzled with honey, and other symbolic fruits and vegetables are eaten as an <b>entree,</b> such as pomegranates, carrots, leeks and beets. Fish dishes, symbolizing abundance, are served; for example, gefilte fish is traditional for Ashkenazim, while Moroccan Jews prepare the spicy fish dish, chraime.

It {{has been described}} by Zoe Williams as being distinctly Gordon Ramsay in composition, despite the influences of head chef Sean Burbidge. The meals come with an amuse-bouche, a pre-starter course, and after dinner chocolates in addition to the items listed on the menus themselves. A number of pan fried fish dishes have been on the menu, including mackerel with tomato chutney and a niçoise salad, and a sea bream course served with brown shrimp, samphire and an oyster velouté sauce.

40|$|INTRODUCTION. The {{availability}} of healthy menu options in restaurants {{is an important}} factor in the prevention of obesity. The Mass in Motion Initiative and two Community Transformation Grant (CTG) projects are conducting statewide longitudinal surveys to determine the {{availability of}} healthy food in restaurants in the state of Massachusetts. METHODS. The Community Nutrition Environment Evaluation Data System-Restaurant (C-NEEDS-R) was developed for food environment surveillance. C-NEEDS-R takes into account seasonal and geographic variations in food supplies, cultural relevance, and USDA dietary recommendations. Between summer 2012 and winter 2013, 506 restaurants in 36 Massachusetts towns and cities were surveyed and analyzed. Through menu and site evaluation, the availability of healthy <b>entrees</b> was examined for each restaurant, and the total number of healthy <b>entrees</b> as well as the percent of healthy <b>entrees</b> was calculated for each restaurant. For each municipality, the average number and average percentage of healthy <b>entrees</b> for restaurants within the community was also calculated. RESULTS. The surveyed restaurants had average 3. 2 healthy <b>entrees</b> on the menu, accounting for 13. 4 % of the total number of <b>entrees</b> available. The percentage of healthy options varied widely by restaurant and restaurant type, ranging from 0 to 84 %, and only 15 of the 506 surveyed restaurants (DISCUSSION. As noted, menu evaluation demonstrated that the large majority of the surveyed restaurants had few healthy <b>entrees,</b> indicating a need to increase availability of healthy options. Analysis of restaurant- and community-level variations in availability is useful for CTG programs to formulate and prioritize interventions. Future longitudinal surveys of food stores in the intervention and control communities will help evaluate the effectiveness of CTG interventions...|$|R

Between June and December 1710, Campra and Danchet experimented with a total of two prologues and eight <b>entrées</b> and the opera ran for several dozen performances, reaching its 51st mounting on 14 October when it was restructured in a version with a shortened prologue and four <b>entrées</b> (which were to become five in the following month of December).|$|R
