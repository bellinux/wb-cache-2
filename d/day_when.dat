5|$|Ant Island is {{a colony}} of ants led by the Queen and her daughter, Princess Atta. Every season, {{they are forced to}} give food to a gang of marauding {{grasshoppers}} led by Hopper.

5|$|Homing pigeons use {{magnetic}} field information with other navigational cues. Pioneering researcher William Keeton showed that time-shifted homing pigeons could not orient themselves correctly {{on a clear}} sunny day, but could do so on an overcast day, suggesting that the birds prefer {{to rely on the}} direction of the sun, but switch to using a {{magnetic field}} cue when the sun is not visible. This was confirmed by experiments with magnets: the pigeons could not orient correctly on an overcast <b>day</b> <b>when</b> the magnetic field was disrupted.|$|E

5|$|In a later match, against Essex, Miller was {{involved}} in a famous incident that is frequently cited when his character is discussed; it also spotlighted his differences with Bradman. On a <b>day</b> <b>when</b> the Australians set a world-record of 721runs in a single day, Miller came to the crease with his side already dominating, with the score 2/364. He deliberately allowed himself to be bowled first ball, much to Bradman's displeasure, in a protest against the one-sided nature of the contest.|$|E
