40|$|Phosphorus (P), a major {{nutrient}} for plants, is a finite non-renewable resource of modern agriculture. Nevertheless, {{the efficiency of}} P usage today hardly reaches 20 % with the rest ending in wastewater or carried away by runoff from fields to rivers and to the oceans. In our study, we will investigate the potential to close the cycle from waste back to agriculture by exploiting the capability of microalgae to accumulate large P quantities. This potential of algae for a ‘luxury P uptake’ will be combined {{with the benefit of}} delayed release of P from the algal biomass applied as a fertilizer to soil. To achieve our goals, first we selected best suitable algae subspecies of Clorella vulgaris with regard to maximal P incorporation. Afterwards, the pre-culture conditions were optimized in regard of tracer uptake. In several experiments we compared the behavior of washed and different starved out algae in the following, simple experimental setup: erlenmayer flasks with algae in radioactive labelled nutrition solution (in form of orthophosphate) were gently shaked in an incubator under appropriated illumination. In various time intervals sampling occurs and the aliquots were centrifuged. The sedimented, labelled algae were digested with concentrated HNO 3. Thereafter, both, the digested solutions derived from the sediments as well as the supernatants containing still free orthophosphate were measured in the liquid scintillation counter (LSC) for their activities. Effects of lighting were additional investigated as well as the possibility to label greater amounts by means of using algae different optical depths. As result, main influence to achieve fast and possibly complete incorporation of the label is an extreme low, but not missing phosphorous content in the nutrition solution, as we studied by systematic investigations using hungry algae out of the pre-culture. In future, (in such way) <b>labelled</b> algae <b>shall</b> <b>be</b> used for rhizotrone experiments to study how P in algae derived fertilizer deploys to the soil and is taken up by wheat plants by means of bioimaging. Furthermore, soil aliquots as well as different plant parts <b>shall</b> <b>be</b> digested after harvest and measured in LCS for quantitation purposes...|$|R

Similarly, the multilabel learning may also suffer from the problems of high dimensionality, and little {{attention has been paid to}} this issue. In this paper, we propose a new ensemble learning algorithms for multilabel data. The main characteristic of our method is that it exploits the features with local discriminative capabilities for <b>each</b> <b>label</b> to serve the purpose of classification. Specifically, for <b>each</b> <b>label,</b> the discriminative capabilities of features on positive and negative data are estimated, and then the top features with the highest capabilities are obtained. Finally, a binary classifier for <b>each</b> <b>label</b> is constructed on the top features. Experimental results on the benchmark data sets show that the proposed method outperforms four popular and previously published multilabel learning algorithms...|$|R
