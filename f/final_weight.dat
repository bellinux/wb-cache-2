At the completion of filming for the show, Kimberley weighed in at a <b>final</b> <b>weight</b> of 149lbs; down a total of 27lbs. from her original start weight of 176lbs. A feature in the September 10th issue of People Magazine shows Kimberley at 141lbs., only 3 pounds away from her goal. Locke announced through her official MySpace blog on October 8, 2007 that she had finally achieved her 40-pound weight loss goal.|$|E

The vehicle would mount a 76 or 105mm main gun in a limited-traverse turret, which also housed the three-man crew; namely: driver, gunner and commander. The anti–armour {{capability}} would be met by a Swingfire missile system (then under development) mounted at the rear. The design would come in both tracked and wheeled versions and share the same engine and transmission as the FV432 armoured personnel carrier. The <b>final</b> <b>weight</b> of the prototype was over 13 tons, which exceeded the weight limit if it was to be transported by air.|$|E

The woman's abdomen will transform in shape as it drops due to the fetus turning in a downward position ready for birth. During the second trimester, the woman's abdomen would have been upright, whereas in the third trimester it will drop down low. The fetus moves regularly, and is felt by the woman. Fetal movement can become strong and be disruptive to the woman. The woman's navel will sometimes become convex, [...] "popping" [...] out, due to the expanding abdomen.|$|E

In literature, techniques such as weight elimination, weight decay have been proposed and a tendency to decay to zero for the connections between neurons is subsequently employed {{in order to obtain}} a smaller network which improves the generalization capability. Within this paper a new method to achieve compactness in the <b>final</b> <b>weights</b> is proposed.

2500|$|To produce pu'er, many {{additional}} {{steps are}} needed {{prior to the}} actual pressing of the tea. First, a specific quantity of dry máochá or ripened tea leaves pertaining to the <b>final</b> <b>weight</b> of the bingcha is weighed out. The dry tea is then lightly steamed in perforated cans to soften {{and make it more}} tacky. This will allow it to hold together and not crumble during compression. A ticket, called a [...] "nèi fēi" [...] (...) or additional adornments, such as colored ribbons, are placed on or {{in the midst of the}} leaves and inverted into a cloth bag or wrapped in cloth. The pouch of tea is gathered inside the cloth bag and wrung into a ball, with the extra cloth tied or coiled around itself. This coil or knot is what produces the dimpled indentation at the reverse side of a tea cake when pressed. Depending on the shape of the pu'er being produced, a cotton bag may or may not be used. For instance, brick or square teas often are not compressed using bags.|$|E
