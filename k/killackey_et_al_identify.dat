5000|$|A conference {{paper by}} Oguchi <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> sought to <b>identify</b> and test {{differences}} in definitions of product lifetime expectations. Oguchi <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> illustrated that previous research into expected product lifetimes has been inconsistent {{in its use}} of the term expected product lifetimes. For example, Cooper enquires about [...] "reasonable" [...] expected lifetimes, while Brook Lyndhurst [...] discusses [...] "normal" [...] expected lifetimes. Wieser <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>identified</b> the tension between everyday expectations and desires, distinguishing between these expectations in his study of 21 products. In addition, earlier work by Tasaki <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> and more recent work by WRAP have asked users to report both how long they have owned an item for, and how long they expect to use the item for in future: WRAP term this [...] "active use". Building on these previous studies (described above), Oguchi <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>identified</b> and tested three distinct definitions of expected product lifetimes, these are outlined below.|$|R
50|$|Exhaustive {{work has}} been {{undertaken}} by Murakami <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> and Oguchi <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> and to outline several definitions and discuss methods for identifying actual product lifetimes. Murkami <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>identify</b> the following overarching concepts in product lifetime definitions which are discussed below: Age, Residential time, Service life, Possession span and Duration of use.|$|R

30|$|With the {{advancement}} of mass spectrometry, a panel of sialylated glycoproteins could be identified simultaneously, accelerating the screening of cancer markers. For example, Zhao <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>identified</b> approximately 130 sialylated glycoproteins and found sialylated plasma protease C 1 inhibitor was down-regulated in pancreatic cancer serum (Zhao, <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 2006).|$|R
