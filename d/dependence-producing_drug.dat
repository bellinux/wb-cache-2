40|$|INTRODUCTION: Waterpipe tobacco smoking {{involves}} self-administration of the <b>dependence-producing</b> <b>drug</b> nicotine. Few {{studies have}} examined if dependence in waterpipe smokers influences toxicant exposure and smoking behavior. METHOD: Current waterpipe tobacco smokers were categorized based on Lebanese Waterpipe Dependence Scale- 11 (LWDS- 11) score (LWDS- 11 : LOW 13; N = 59). Participants abstained from smoking for 12 hr and then completed a single 30 -min waterpipe tobacco smoking episode. Expired-air carbon monoxide (CO) was measured before and 5 min after smoking and puff topography was measured during smoking. RESULTS: Total mean smoking time was 30. 9 min (SD = 3. 5) and {{did not differ significantly}} by LWDS- 11 score. CO boost was greater for participants in the HIGH versus LOW groups (62. 3 vs. 43. 6 ppm,...|$|E
40|$|Electronic {{cigarettes}} (ECIGs) use {{an electric}} heater to aerosolize a liquid that usually contains propylene glycol, vegetable glycerin, flavorants, and the <b>dependence-producing</b> <b>drug</b> nicotine. ECIG-induced nicotine dependence {{has become an}} important concern, as some ECIGs deliver very little nicotine while some may exceed the nicotine delivery profile of a tobacco cigarette. This variability is relevant to tobacco cigarette smokers who try to switch to ECIGs. Products with very low nicotine delivery may not substitute for tobacco cigarettes, so that ECIG use is accompanied by little reduced risk of cigarette-caused disease. Products with very high nicotine delivery may make quitting ECIGs particularly difficult should users decide to try. For non-smokers, the wide variability of ECIGs on the market is especially troublesome: low nicotine products may lead them to initiate nicotine self-administration and progress to higher dosing ECIGs or other products, and those that deliver more nicotine may produce nicotine dependence where it was not otherwise present. External regulatory action, guided by strong science, {{may be required to}} ensure that population-level nicotine dependence does not rise...|$|E

CO boost was greater for participants in the HIGH versus LOW groups (62. 3 vs. 43. 6 ppm, p <. 01). Similarly, those in the HIGH versus LOW group took more puffs (198. 6 vs. 157. 1 puffs, p <. 01), longer duration puffs (2. 7 vs. 2. 3 s, p <. 05), puffs with lower flow rate (10. 3 vs. 12. 6 L/min, p <. 01), and less time between puffs (8. 0 vs. 12. 4 s, p <. 001). Conclusion: The puff topography of waterpipe tobacco smokers can be predicted by LWDS- 11 score, with those scoring higher taking longer duration and lower velocity puffs at a higher frequency. These behavioral differences may underlie the 40 % greater CO exposure observed for those with higher LWDS- 11 scores. To the extent that waterpipe dependence is associated with more smoke inhalation, more dependent smokers will be exposed to greater amounts of toxic smoke constituents. Â© The Author 2013.

40|$|The mesolimbocortical {{dopamine}} (DA) {{system is}} pivotal for {{the mediation of}} the reinforcing effects of many <b>dependence-producing</b> <b>drugs.</b> It consists of cell bodies in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) that project to e. g. the nucleus accumbens (NAC), the central nucleus of amygdala (CNA) and the medial prefrontal cortex. In experimental animals, nicotine increases DA output in the NAC, exerts a locomotor stimulatory effect and is readily self-administered. These effects of systemic nicotine appear largely mediated via nicotinic receptors (nAChRs) in the VTA. Moreover, recently the a 7 nAChR subtype has been implicated {{in some of the}} acute effects of nicotine. The effects of nicotine withdrawal on behavior and mesolimbocortical dopaminergic neurotransmission in rats have remained largely unknown. Therefore, utilizing behavioral methods, in vivo microdialysis, intracerebral drug injections and immunohistochemistry, we explored in detail the effects of nicotine withdrawal on these parameters. Rats were, by means of subcutaneously implanted minipumps, treated chronically with a dose of nicotine that yielded plasma levels similar to those encountered in heavy smokers. A somatic nicotine abstinence reaction was induced through removal of the infusion pump or through administration of a nAChR antagonist, acting either centrally and peripherally or peripherally only. Administration of nicotine or of a peripherally acting nAChR agonist both reversed the withdrawal reaction. Systemic administration of the nAChR antagonist mecamylamine significantly reduced DA output in the NAC selectively in the nicotine-treated group. The somatic withdrawal signs and the reduction in NAC DA appeared not to be specifically or causally related. Also intrategmental injection of mecamylamine elicited a reduction in accumbal DA output, somatic withdrawal signs as well as hypolocomotion, whereas intraaccumbal administration of mecamylamine failed to elicit any changes in NAC DA output or in somatic signs. Similarly, intrategmental application of an a 7 nAChR antagonist resulted in a decreased NAC DA output and a reduction in locomotor activity. Finally, nicotine withdrawal precipitated by a systemic injection of mecamylamine both attenuated DA output and activated c?fos in the CNA. These results demonstrate a significant contribution of peripheral nAChRs to the nicotine withdrawal reaction and predict that drugs stimulating selectively peripheral nAChRs may have some usefulness in smoking cessation. The withdrawal-induced reduction in NAC DA, if it occurs also in man, may have bearing on clinical symptoms such as depression and dysphoria that are often encountered in association with smoking cessation. In addition, the clinical efficacy of bupropion in smoking cessation programmes may largely be due to its ability to restore a compromised mesolimbic DA function. Specifically, nAChRs {{at the level of the}} VTA rather than in the NAC seem to contribute to the behavioral and biochemical consequences of nicotine withdrawal precipitated with systemic mecamylamine, and a role for a 7 nAChRs within the VTA is indicated in this regard. The withdrawal-induced selective activation of c-fos in the CNA may have bearing on anxiety and distress, symptoms that in animals can be elicited from this brain region and frequently occur in nicotine abstinent humans...|$|R
40|$|Tobacco-smoking {{represents}} {{a form of}} drug addiction to nicotine (NlC) and thereinforcing and dependence-producing properties of NIC depend largely on centraldopamine (DA) neurons, located in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and projectingmainly to the nucleus accumbens (NAc; mesolimbic DA system) and the medial prefrontalcortex (PFC; mesocortical DA system). Generally, the mesolimbic DA system plays apivotal role in the reinforcing effects of natural rewards {{as well as of}} drugs ofabuse. Thus, in the present study the mode of action of NIC on these two centralDA systems was further explored in the rat. Microdialysis of extracellular DA was carried out in freely moving animals. Dopamineoutput was also monitored with differential normal pulse voltammetry (DNPV) in anesthetizedanimals. Neuronal activity of VTA DA cells was registered by means of single cellrecordings in vivo. Moreover, measurements of locomotor activity in an open fieldwere performed as well as assessments of expression of immediate early genes, e. g. c-fos, in several brain regions by means of immunohistochemical detection of theirprotein products, i. e. Fos-like immunoreactivity (FLI). By means of local infusions of the nicotinic receptor (nAChR) antagonist mecamylamine(MEC), systemic nicotine-induced DA release in the NAc was found to be mainly executedwithin the VTA. Systemic NIC also increased DA release in the PFC and this effectwas enhanced during subchronic NIC treatment, whereas NIC-induced accumbal DA releasewas unaltered by the same treatment. In addition, a selective DA D,-mediated increasein FLI was observed both in the PFC and in the shell region of the NAc, a subdivisionof the NAc intimately coupled to the PFC, during chronic NIC administration. By meansof DNPV, NIC was found to preferentially stimulate DA release in the shell of theNAc, both in acute and chronic experiments. Moreover, behavioral sensitization toNIC-induced locomotor stimulation was observed in chronic experiments both with systemicand intra-VTA application of NIC. The latter treatment also increased FLI in theNAc. In addition, systemic NIC preferentially increased VTA DA neuronal burst activity,i. e. an effect similar to the physiological reward response of these cells, startingat a lower dose in NIC-pretreated than in drug-naive animals. The effects of systemic NIC on mesolimbic DA neurotransmission, including neurochemicalalterations in postsynaptic regions, as well as on DA-related behavior, seem thusto be essentially mediated via stimulation of nAChRs located within the VTA. Theobserved pattern of response of central DA systems to chronic NIC administrationappears rather unique among <b>dependence-producing</b> <b>drugs,</b> and its subjective benefitsmay accordingly be related to augmented DA activity in the PFC, and include, forexample, focused attention and cognitive enhancement, at least under certain conditions. A preferential facilitation of prefrontal DA output seems to be a common denominatorfor several atypical antipsychotic drugs which, similarly to chronic NIC, have beenshown to augment burst firing in VTA DA neurons as well as DA release and c-fos expressionpreferentially in the shell of the NAc and in the PFC. The data underline the notion,that the extremely high prevalence of cigarette smoking in schizophrenia may indeedrepresent a forrn of attempted self-medication.
