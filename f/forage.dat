5|$|All {{species are}} predators and scavengers. Iridomyrmex ants tend to many Hemiptera insects and {{butterfly}} larvae to receive honeydew. Workers <b>forage</b> and scavenge for small insects, and they collect nectar from flowers and hunt for prey. Iridomyrmex ants normally <b>forage</b> on the ground, but most species will <b>forage</b> up into trees and vegetation {{to look for}} food. Most ants are diurnal foragers, but some are nocturnal. These nocturnal ants will sometimes become active during the day, but this depends on the suitability of the weather. They will also block their entrance holes when it is daytime; however, I. bigi is nocturnal and never comes out during the day. In a few species, a nest will not {{be placed in a}} shaded area; this is so it can warm up during the early mornings and workers can <b>forage</b> shortly after sunrise.|$|E

40|$|Wide-ranging marine {{central place}} foragers often exhibit <b>foraging</b> site {{fidelity}} to oceanographic features over differing spatial scales (i. e., localized coastal upwellings and oceanic fronts). Few studies have tested how {{the degree of}} site fidelity to <b>foraging</b> areas varies {{in relation to the}} type of ocean features used. In order to determine how <b>foraging</b> site fidelity varied between continental shelf and oceanic <b>foraging</b> habitats, 31 lactating New Zealand fur seals (Arctocephalus australis forsteri 1) were satellite tracked over consecutive <b>foraging</b> trips (14 – 108 d). Thirty-seven <b>foraging</b> trips were recorded from 11 females that <b>foraged</b> on the continental shelf, in a region associated with a coastal upwelling, while 65 <b>foraging</b> trips were recorded from 20 females that <b>foraged</b> in oceanic waters. There {{were no significant differences in}} the mean bearings (to maximum distance) of individual's consecutive <b>foraging</b> trips, suggesting individual fidelity to <b>foraging</b> areas. However, overlap in area and time spent in area varied considerably between continental shelf and oceanic foragers. Females that <b>foraged</b> on the continental shelf had significantly greater overlap in consecutive <b>foraging</b> trips when compared to females that <b>foraged</b> in oceanic waters (overlap in 5 × 5 km grid cells visited on consecutive trips 55. 9 %± 20. 4 % and 13. 4 %± 7. 6 %, respectively). Females that <b>foraged</b> on the continental shelf also spent significantly more time within the same grid cell than females that <b>foraged</b> in oceanic waters (maximum time spent in 5 × 5 km grid cells: 14 %± 5 % and 4 %± 2 %, respectively). This comparatively high <b>foraging</b> site fidelity may reflect the concentration of productivity associated with a coastal upwelling system, the Bonney Upwelling. Lower <b>foraging</b> site fidelity recorded by seals that <b>foraged</b> in oceanic waters implies a lower density/larger scale habitat, where prey are more dispersed or less predictable at fine scales, when compared to the continental shelf region.

40|$|<b>Foraging</b> Optimization Algorithm (BFOA) for {{distributed}} optimization and control. Biologic <b>foraging</b> {{strategies are}} diverse.

To assess <b>foraging</b> site fidelity in king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) breeding at the Falkland Islands (51. 48 °S, 57. 83 °W), we measured overlap in time spent in <b>foraging</b> areas (at a 0. 1 ° ×  0. 1 ° grid resolution) between successive <b>foraging</b> trips and <b>foraging</b> route consistency during the crèche period. In total, 30 complete <b>foraging</b> trips from seven king penguins were recorded between April and October 2010.

40|$|Desert lizards are {{typically}} either widely <b>foraging</b> or sit-and-wait predators, and these <b>foraging</b> modes are correlated with major differences in ecology. <b>Foraging</b> mode {{is related to}} the type of prey eaten by lizards. Widely <b>foraging</b> lizards in the Kalahari desert, the Western Australian desert, and the North American desert generally eat more prey that are sedentary, unpredictably distributed, and clumped (e. g., termites) or that are large and inaccessible (inactive scorpions) than do sit-and-wait lizards. In contrast, sit-and-wait lizards eat more prey that are active. <b>Foraging</b> mode also appears to influence the types of predators that in turn eat the lizards. For example, a sit-and-wait snake eats predominately widely <b>foraging</b> lizards. Crossovers in <b>foraging</b> mode thus exist between trophic levels. Widely <b>foraging</b> lizards may also encounter predators more frequently, as suggested by analyses of relative tail lengths; but tail break frequencies are ambiguous. Daily maintenance energetic expenditures of widely <b>foraging</b> lizards appear to be about 1. 3 - 1. 5 times greater than those of sit-and-wait lizards in the same habitats, but gross food gains are about 1. 3 - 2. 1 times greater. Widely <b>foraging</b> species also have lower relative clutch volumes, apparently in response to enhanced risks of predation. <b>Foraging</b> mode within one species varies with changes in food availability. Physiology, morphology, and risk of predation might generally restrict the flexibility of <b>foraging</b> mode. Because <b>foraging</b> mode constrains numerous important aspects of ecology, any general model of <b>foraging</b> velocity must be complex. ...|$|R

5|$|The Sind sparrow is gregarious, {{generally}} forming {{small groups}} of four to six birds while feeding.

The Sind sparrow feeds mainly on the seeds of grasses and other plants such as Polygonum plebeium. It may also <b>forage</b> for insects such as caterpillars, especially to feed nestlings.

40|$|<b>Foraging</b> {{specialization}} {{plays an}} important role in the ability of social Hymenoptera to efficiently allocate labor and adapt to environmental changes. However, relatively little is known about whether bumble bees, important social pollinators, can flexibly allocate their <b>foraging.</b> I removed pollen specialists at different stages in the life of a Bombus impatiens colony and recorded the pollen and nectar <b>foraging</b> of every forager on each <b>foraging</b> trip over the lifetimes of five established colonies. Adult bumble bee foragers were defined as pollen specialists (>̲ 90 % of all <b>foraging</b> visits on pollen), nectar specialists (>̲ 90 % of all <b>foraging</b> visits on nectar) or generalists (all other foragers). The removal of pollen specialists at early and late phases in colony life led to increased pollen <b>foraging</b> (36 % and 14 % increase, respectively) by generalist foragers. After pollen specialists were reintroduced, generalists decreased pollen <b>foraging</b> to prior levels. A uniform, proportional extraction of all forager types had no effect on the <b>foraging</b> of generalists remaining in the colony. Thus, the specific removal of pollen specialists caused the <b>foraging</b> compensation by generalists. This shows the importance of pollen specialists and the colony's ability to reallocate their <b>foraging</b> labor in response to pollen <b>foraging</b> labor shortage...|$|R

40|$|Social bees collect nectar and pollen from {{flowering}} plants for {{energy of the}} adult bees and for feeding the larvae in the colony. The flowering patterns of plants imply that periods of high food availability are often followed by periods of meagre <b>foraging</b> conditions. Being dependent on such a dynamic food source may have serious implications {{for the survival of}} adult bees and for a steady production of brood. To adjust <b>foraging</b> behaviour to food conditions in the field, colonies may often have to reallocate the labour that is available for <b>foraging</b> over the different <b>foraging</b> tasks. There are two ways in which social bee colonies can adjust the labour devoted to different <b>foraging</b> tasks; 1) adjust the total <b>foraging</b> force allocated for a particular task and 2) adjust the individual effort of foragers already working on the task. An increase in <b>foraging</b> force for a particular task can be attained in two ways. Firstly, individuals can switch from other <b>foraging</b> tasks to the required task. Switching <b>foraging</b> tasks is physically possible and has been observed in both stingless bee and honeybee foragers. Specialising on one <b>foraging</b> task, however, is thought to result in more efficient <b>foraging</b> and switching tasks might be costly. Apart from forager task switching, increasing the <b>foraging</b> force for a particular task can also be achieved by allocating new foragers to the task. This assumes a reserve supply of labour that can be allocated over <b>foraging</b> tasks in response to stress. The objective {{of the present study was}} to systematically investigate the occurrence and plasticity of <b>foraging</b> task specialisation and the dynamics of forager allocation in stingless bees. Stingless bees (Apidae, Meliponini) occur in the tropics and live in colonies of the same complexity as the honeybees. With the data obtained a contribution to the basic understanding of how social insect colonies can respond adaptively to a dynamic environment is aimed. The results of this thesis show that the adaptive tuning of the colony <b>foraging</b> behaviour of stingless bees can involve changes in the total <b>foraging</b> force as well as changes in the individual <b>foraging</b> effort. The importance of each mechanism to adjust colony <b>foraging</b> behaviour seems to depend on the circumstances. Increase in individual <b>foraging</b> effort seems to occur mainly in situations when large amounts of food are available. Even though increase in <b>foraging</b> effort decreases longevity, in periods of high opportunity, when food is available in large quantities close to the hive, this might be worth the offer. Switching between <b>foraging</b> tasks can be mainly observed when <b>foraging</b> success declines. Successfully employed bees probably do not switch easily to other <b>foraging</b> tasks. As switching is costly, switches between tasks can be economically made when the success of the original task declined. Allocation of new foragers occurs mainly in situations of food stress or when new <b>foraging</b> tasks appear. By allocating non-foragers, <b>foraging</b> on other tasks can continue without interruption, avoiding consequent decrease in storage levels of the other commodities. This thesis contributes to the identification of the mechanisms used by stingless bee colonies to adjust colony <b>foraging</b> activity under different conditions and makes clear the complexity of the organisation of <b>foraging</b> in stingless bees...|$|R
