40|$|The Waimakariri River {{is known}} for its unpredictability; flood and drought events can occur at any time of the year. Knowledge about the return period of extreme events is crucial for water {{management}} and planning. Frequency analysis uses the stochastic nature of these extreme events as a basic concept to account for uncertainty by describing the expected occurrence of floods and droughts. While frequency estimates for the Waimakariri River have been produced in the past, sampling from the historical stream record has almost exclusively relied on annual maximum series (AMS), in combination with a few selected probability distributions based on theoretical considerations. Low <b>flow</b> <b>frequency</b> analysis, albeit an informative tool for water planning, is seldom utilised and no estimates are published for the Waimakariri River. However, low <b>flow</b> <b>frequency</b> estimates can provide valuable information for the management of instream biota under pressures from flow modification. This thesis produced flood and low <b>flow</b> <b>frequency</b> estimates for the Waimakariri River, using the partial duration series (PDS) approach to sampling for the first time. Previous estimates utilised in floodplain management have solely relied on the use of AMS. Graphical and statistical testing methods were employed to determine the best fitting probability distributions, guided by the empirical streamflow record. Low <b>flow</b> <b>frequency</b> estimates were produced with ‘runs theory’ to reflect the multiple dimensions that characterise low flows. Current developments in the Waimakariri catchment are reflected by developing a discharge series subtracting consented water abstractions, which was compared to the current discharge series. Together with a rapid systematic literature review, the results from the low <b>flow</b> <b>frequency</b> analysis were used for a qualitative narrative assessment summarising the likely effects of flow modifications on the Waimakariri River environment. Statistical results indicate that the PDS produces a better fit to the empirical flood and low flow data than the often applied AMS approach. The procedures for threshold selection and best fit decision making in this study identified methods for choosing the optimum PDS. Contrary to the published literature, the Gumbel distribution is not a good fit for the flood series of the Waimakariri River. Results indicate a better fit of four alternative distributions, i. e. the Log-Pearson III, Pearson III, Generalised Extreme Value and Generalised Pareto distributions. All dimensions of low flow series are equally well described by these four distributions. Design estimates for floods produced by the four alternative distributions are markedly higher than current estimates used in floodplain management. Low <b>flow</b> <b>frequency</b> estimates were produced for duration and deficit series, reflecting the current water allocation regime of the Waimakariri River. The longer low flow durations and higher deficits are expected to significantly impact not only on the reliability of river flow dependent catchment developments, but also on the flow dependent biotic and abiotic environment. Results showed that both habitat quantity and quality ensuring flows are significantly affected by flow modifications...|$|E
40|$|This study employs Bayesian {{multiple}} regression analysis using the ordinary least squares method for regional low <b>flow</b> <b>frequency</b> analysis. The parameter estimates using the Bayesian {{multiple regression}} analysis were compared to conventional analysis using the t-distribution. In these comparisons, the mean values from the t-distribution and the Bayesian analysis at each return period are not significantly different. However, the difference between upper and lower limits is remarkably reduced using the Bayesian multiple regression. Therefore, {{from the point of}} view of uncertainty analysis, Bayesian {{multiple regression analysis}} is more attractive than the conventional method based on a t-distribution because the low flow sample size at the site of interest is typically insufficient to perform low <b>flow</b> <b>frequency</b> analysis. Also, we performed low flow prediction, including confidence intervals, at two ungauged catchments using the developed Bayesian multiple regression model.

The main objective of this thesis is to assess the significance of the impacts of human activities such as construction of reservoirs, water supply diversions, increased water use and return flows on streamflows by the recently completed Texas WAM (Water Availability Modeling) system. The major river basins in the state of Texas were selected as suitable study basins.

40|$|Overbank {{sedimentation}} {{rates were}} studied in former channels of three rivers in south-eastern France. Depth and {{spatial distribution of}} sediment, as well as geometry, hydrological connectivity and age of 39 lakes, were both measured and calculated. The mean sedimentation rate of lakes varied between 0 and 2 · 57 [*]cm[*]year− 1. Sedimentation rates are linked to water depth and often undergo a decreasing gradient from the downstream outlet to the inner part of the lake. Multiple regression modelling demonstrates that sediment depth is essentially a function of overbank <b>flow</b> <b>frequency.</b> The greater the difference between upstream and downstream overbank <b>flow</b> <b>frequency,</b> the faster the sedimentation rate. These differences in sedimentation rates also correspond to different former channel geometry: the rates are slower in narrow and straight channels (former braided, and point-bar backwater channels), and faster in large and sinuous channels (exhibiting meanders, anastomosing channels and coves). The suspended sediment flux is variable from one reach to another, the middle reach of the Rhône conveying more sediment than the upper reaches, the Doubs or the Ain reaches. The suspended sediment flux does not explain a statistical difference in lake sedimentation rates between the reaches, which also provide clear evidence {{of the importance of}} local connectivity controls. Sedimentation patterns were also complicated by temporal changes in lake connectivity associated with geomorphological or anthropogenic changes operating within the main channel...|$|E

The dispersion mechanism {{is found to be}} controlled by the ratio τ m /T of the molecular diffusion time across the gap and the oscillation period (when molecular diffusion parallel to the flow is negligible). Gaussian distributions of the concentration with a width constant across the gap are achieved after a time lapse scaling like τ m. For τ m /T 2, the front spreads through Taylor-like dispersion and the normalized dispersivity scales as τ m /T. The front oscillates parallel to the flow with an amplitude constant across the gap; its width increases monotonically at a rate modulated at twice the <b>flow</b> <b>frequency,</b> due to variations of the instantaneous dispersivity. For τ m /T 20, the molecular diffusion distance during a period of the flow is smaller than the gap and the normalized dispersivity scales as (τ m /T) − 1.

40|$|Being able to {{estimate}} low flows {{at any point}} of a river is really important nowadays for a good integrated management of rivers. Knowing the magnitude {{as well as the}} frequency of such extreme events becomes essential. In order to build a model of low flow calculation, usable in ungauged catchments and which takes also into account low <b>flow</b> <b>frequency,</b> we started with a low <b>flow</b> <b>frequency</b> analysis including a comparison of different distributions. Two-parameter Lognormal and Gamma were the most common distributions that fit low flow data in Wallonia. This was followed by a regionalisation of low flows using 25 different climatic and physical catchment variables, and the development of regression models that can be used {{to estimate}} the minimum 7 -day average flow for different return periods, using catchment characteristics. The variables the most correlated to specific minimum 7 -day average flows were the recession coefficient and percolation, regardless of the return period. The determination coefficients of the models ranged from 0. 51 to 0. 67 for calibration and from 0. 61 to 0. 80 for validation. Finally, regression coefficients were logarithmically linked to the return period. This enabled us to develop a single model per region and for the whole study area, in function of the return period. In conclusion, the method developed in this study allows us to estimate low flows in gauged and ungauged catchments of a given region for a given return period.
