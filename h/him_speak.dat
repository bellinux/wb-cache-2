5|$|In 1888, Indiana Senator Benjamin Harrison, {{grandson}} of territorial Governor William Henry Harrison, was elected President after an intense battle that attracted more than 300,000 partisans to Indianapolis to hear <b>him</b> <b>speak</b> from his famous front porch. Fort Benjamin Harrison was named in his honor. Six Hoosiers {{have been elected}} as Vice-President. The most recent was Mike Pence, elected in 2016.|$|E
5|$|As Juliet anesthetizes Ben and Jack {{begins the}} operation, Pickett goes {{with another man}} to Sawyer's cage. Kate and Sawyer attempt to fight, but Pickett's {{companion}} overpowers Kate and holds her at gunpoint, leading Sawyer to surrender. Meanwhile, Jack sabotages the operation by cutting Ben's kidney sack, and demands that Tom (M.C. Gainey) let <b>him</b> <b>speak</b> with Kate. Before Pickett can shoot Sawyer, Tom calls over the walkie-talkie. As Pickett gives the walkie to Kate, Jack tells her she has an hour's head start, and directs her to call him on the radio when she is safe.|$|E
5|$|Joseph {{was also}} {{unable to stop}} those who came to hear <b>him</b> <b>speak</b> from desecrating the Sabbath, and his Yiddish sermons had {{no impact on the}} younger generation. In addition, he had to contend with a number of obstacles: he had no {{administrative}} experience or training, local Orthodox rabbis (particularly Joshua Seigel) and Jews outside his congregation did not accept his authority, and non-Orthodox Jews and groups criticized him. These problems were exacerbated by a stroke suffered in 1895, which partially incapacitated him, followed by a relapse in 1900 which left him bedridden.|$|E

5|$|The {{artist has}} {{performed}} at political rallies led by Beck, and at campaign rallies for Herman Cain. Her husband joined Cain's presidential campaign as state director for Tennessee after hearing <b>him</b> <b>speak</b> at events where Branch performed. Branch said Cain {{was a natural}} choice {{for her and her}} husband because she felt their beliefs aligned with Cain's. Since 2010, she received three payments that totaled $10,000 for live entertainment services provided at political rallies from several political action committees associated with Cain's campaign.|$|E
5|$|A capable preacher, though {{doubtful}} of {{his ability}} when preaching to a non-academic congregation, Chadwick was well regarded as a lecturer and companion at High Table. However, a natural shyness could give him a rather remote air. On an American lecture tour, he noticed three young women who came to every lecture, but took no notes. At the end of lectures he asked the women how they had enjoyed them, {{to be told that}} they had no real interest in the subject itself, but they loved to hear <b>him</b> <b>speak.</b> The character of the college provost in the A Staircase in Surrey novels of Christ Church colleague J. I. M. Stewart was based on that of Chadwick.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{broken and}} {{incoherent}} radio messages between Lieber {{and the search}} party are intercepted by intelligence agents tracking their progress, and rumours begin to spread across the world of Hitler's capture. Debates flare up over his impending trial, {{where it will be}} held and under whose jurisdiction. Orosso is identified as the nearest airfield to the last known location of the search party, and aircraft begin arriving at the hitherto unknown town. But when the search party loses radio contact with Lieber, they must make a decision to either wait out the storms and deliver their captive to Lieber later, or try Hitler in the jungle. They choose the latter, given that they would likely lose control of the situation if they attempted to transport their prisoner. Against Lieber's advice ("You must not let <b>him</b> <b>speak...</b> his tongue is like no other") they prepare for a trial with a judge, prosecution and defence attorneys selected from the members of the search party. Teku, a local Indian tracker, is asked to observe the trial as an independent witness.|$|E

5|$|Nomura {{redesigned}} Cloud for {{his appearance}} in Kingdom Hearts. He is depicted with a claw and a crimson cape, and {{the blade of}} his sword is wrapped in bandages. Stating that Cloud's left arm was inspired by Vincent Valentine, Nomura explained {{that he wanted to}} give the character a more demon-like appearance due to his ties to the dark side in the game. Nomura stated that he wanted to leave the question of whether Cloud was searching for Aerith open to the player's interpretation. Teruaki Sugawara, the game's voice director, recommended Takahiro Sakurai, Cloud's Japanese voice actor, to Nomura for the role. Nomura had originally asked Sakurai to play the protagonist of The Bouncer, Sion Barzahd, but found that his voice best suited Cloud after hearing <b>him</b> <b>speak.</b> Sakurai received the script without any accompanying visuals, and first arrived for recording under the impression that he would be voicing a different character than the one featured in Final Fantasy VII.|$|E
25|$|The blow {{failed to}} kill Trotsky instantly; {{he got up}} and grappled with Mercader. Hearing the commotion, Trotsky's guards burst in the room and nearly beat Mercader to death, but Trotsky, heavily wounded but still conscious, ordered them to spare his attacker's life and let <b>him</b> <b>speak.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 2007, {{longtime}} UCC member Barack Obama (then a Democratic Presidential candidate) {{spoke at}} the UCC's Iowa Conference meeting and at the General Synod 26.

25|$|Soon {{after the}} church opened the Methodist evangelist James Caughey spent {{four months in}} Kingston. Hundreds of people came to hear <b>him</b> <b>speak</b> at the Sydenham Street Methodist Church, and {{it is said that}} he was {{directly}} responsible for almost four hundred conversions or experiences of sanctification.|$|E
25|$|To capture what {{is special}} about Francis’ {{theology}} {{it is helpful}} to let <b>him</b> <b>speak</b> in his own words: the specialty is often watered down in generalizations. His statements have been well described as “snarky” and “stunners”. The fervor of his determination to turn around the church appears in his way of expressing himself.|$|E
25|$|He {{completed}} his education till middle grade {{from a local}} Christian missionary school called Tyndale Biscoe School, {{which used to be}} situated at Fateh Kadal locality of Srinagar back then. Here he must have learnt languages like Sanskrit, Persian, Urdu and scripts like Sharda and Devanagari. Some of his close devotees, at times, had heard <b>him</b> <b>speak</b> English too.|$|E

25|$|James {{married his}} first wife, Juanita Young, in Trinidad in 1929, but his move {{three years later}} to Britain led to their estrangement. He met his second wife, Constance Webb (1918–2005), an American model, actress and author, after {{he moved to the}} US in 1938; she wrote of having first heard <b>him</b> <b>speak</b> in the spring of 1939 at a meeting in California. They married in 1946 and were {{divorced}} in 1953, when James was deported to Britain. He and Webb had a son, C. L. R. James, Jr, familiarly known as Nobbie. In 1956 James married Selma Weinstein (née Deitch), who had been a young member of the Johnson-Forest Tendency; they remained close political colleagues for more than 25 years. She is best known as the founder of the International Wages for Housework Campaign.|$|E

500|$|Angelou met novelist John Oliver Killens in 1959 and, at his urging, {{moved to}} New York to {{concentrate}} on her writing career. [...] She joined the Harlem Writers Guild, where she met several major African-American authors, including John Henrik Clarke, Rosa Guy, Paule Marshall, and Julian Mayfield, and was published for the first time. [...] In 1960, after meeting civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. and hearing <b>him</b> <b>speak,</b> she and Killens organized [...] "the legendary" [...] Cabaret for Freedom to benefit the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), and she was named SCLC's Northern Coordinator.

500|$|Jeff Lindsay was {{initially}} against casting Michael C. Hall to play Dexter, but {{changed his mind}} after seeing <b>him</b> <b>speak</b> only one line of the script. The crew began filming the pilot in Miami, but were unable to finish due to the overlap of production with the hurricane season. In spite of a subsidy {{from the state of}} Florida, the crew moved to Los Angeles, where the remainder of filming took place; footage shot in both Miami and Los Angeles were used in the episode. [...] "Dexter" [...] was watched by over one million viewers, giving Showtime its highest ratings in almost two years. Critical reception of the pilot was mostly positive, though critics of Variety, LA Weekly, and The Wall Street Journal found that it was [...] "unpleasant" [...] to watch.|$|E
500|$|According to Bertram Davis, [...] "For {{every person}} who remembers Sir John Hawkins {{as the author of}} the first {{full-length}} biography of Samuel Johnson, many remember him as the man Johnson once described as 'unclubable'." [...] Although [...] "unclubable" [...] reflects Hawkins's relationship with others of Johnson's circle, Johnson and Hawkins had a close friendship as Miss Reynolds describes: [...] "As we were returning from the meadows that day, I remember we met Sir John Hawkins, whom Dr. Johnson seemed much rejoiced to see; and no wonder, for I have often heard <b>him</b> <b>speak</b> of Sir John in terms expressive of great esteem and much cordiality of friendship" [...] Their relationship began around 1739 and they were both involved with The Gentleman's Magazine. Later, Hawkins was, in 1749, a member of Johnson's first club: the Ivy Lane club.|$|E
