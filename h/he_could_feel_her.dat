60|$|She came to him, and in {{his arms}} <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> trembling.|$|E
60|$|Already {{they were}} closing round him, and <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> breath upon his cheek, when the charm broke, and he {{wrenched}} himself free.|$|E
6000|$|They {{crouched}} {{so close}} to each other that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> furs against him. Neither had spoken since they left the roadway till she said, with attempted unconcern: 'This is unfortunate.' ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> through <b>her</b> veil the {{surprise}} {{with which she}} turned to him: [...] "You said, whenever we are in doubt, we must act unselfishly." ...|$|R
60|$|He was {{suddenly}} intensely moved. He {{was filled with}} the warmth of her. In the glow <b>he</b> <b>could</b> almost <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> as if she were present--her arms, her shoulders, her bosom, see them, feel them, almost contain them.|$|R
60|$|He {{turned back}} {{the way he had}} come, the rhythm of the engine {{pounding}} in his ears. He began to doubt the reality of what memory told him. He halted under a tree and allowed the rhythm to die away. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> not <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> near him in the darkness nor her voice touch his ear. He waited for some minutes listening. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> hear nothing: the night was perfectly silent. He listened again: perfectly silent. He felt that he was alone.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh yes!" [...] she said, and {{the little}} hand pressed his arm once more very eagerly, and the girl clung to him so that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> heart beating on his shoulder.|$|E
60|$|She {{took his}} arm; <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> heart {{throbbing}} against it. Kindly silent, {{he led her}} back to the open space. Some garden chairs were placed here and there; he suggested that she should rest for a while.|$|E
6000|$|... "I love you!" [...] She {{was resting}} {{perfectly}} quiet against him, while her heart ceased gradually to beat so fast. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> cheek rubbing against his coat of Harris tweed. Suddenly she sniffed at it, and whispered: ...|$|E
6000|$|Isabel's {{confidence}} in him, however, {{was greater than}} any <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> in <b>her.</b> Not that he thought her capable of committing an atrocity; but, turn it over as he would, there was something ominous {{in the way she}} reserved her option. As she took his hand she felt a great respect for him; she knew how much he cared for her and she thought him magnanimous. They stood so for a moment, looking at each other, united by a hand-clasp which was not merely passive on her side. [...] "That's right," [...] she said very kindly, almost tenderly. [...] "You'll lose nothing by being a reasonable man." ...|$|R
6000|$|And now all {{conversation}} was stopped. Poor Madeline, {{who had been}} so ready with her questions, so eager with her answers, so communicative and so inquiring, was stricken dumb on the instant. She had ceased {{for some time to}} lean upon his arm, and therefore <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> hand tremble; and he was too generous and too kind to look into her face; but he knew that he had touched the fibres of her heart, and that all her presence of mind had for the moment fled from her. Of course such was the case, and of course he knew it. Had he not brought her out there, that they might be alone together when he subjected her to the violence of this shower-bath? ...|$|R
60|$|The anthem ceased, {{the last}} {{notes of the}} organ died away, and the lady rose. Half an hour before, Jack would have gladly stepped forward to have {{challenged}} even a passing glance from the beautiful eyes of the stranger; now a timidity and distrust new to the man took possession of him. He even drew back closer in the shadow as she stepped toward the pillar, which supported on its face a font of holy water. She had already slipped off her glove, and now she leaned forward--so near <b>he</b> <b>could</b> almost <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> warm breath--and dipped her long slim fingers into the water. As she crossed herself with the liquid symbol, Jack gave a slight start. One or two drops of holy water thrown from her little fingers had fallen on his face.|$|R
6000|$|He {{must have}} drifted into a dream--and an extravagant one--for he was master of Charleroi and Adèle was his wife. She {{was coming out}} to him now; {{he could hear her}} steps; <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> hand upon his shoulder-- ...|$|E
60|$|Washington wriggled uneasily. Unable {{to endure}} the {{piercing}} stare of his mother, he had withdrawn to the window, and was looking out with his back turned. But even there <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> eyes {{on the back of}} his neck.|$|E
60|$|But a last {{dance with}} her to-night! The right {{to hold her}} in his arms! this he had never done, though his muscles had often ached with the longing to hold her. But dancing with her <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> against him, clasp her closely, feel her breath against his cheek.|$|E
5|$|Too weak {{to stand}} or walk, Beauchamp was loaded onto a cart to be {{conveyed}} to the gallows. He begged to see Anna, but the guards {{told him she}} was not seriously injured. The guards finally allowed him to see Anna, and Beauchamp was angered that they had underplayed her critical condition. He stayed with her until <b>he</b> <b>could</b> no longer <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> pulse; then the guards took him to the gallows to be hanged before he died of his stab wounds.|$|R
500|$|Weakened {{by his own}} wounds, Beauchamp {{was loaded}} on a cart {{to be taken to}} the gallows and hanged before he bled to death. He insisted on seeing his wife before being executed, but doctors told him she was not {{severely}} injured and would recover. Beauchamp protested that not being allowed to see his wife was cruel, and the guards consented to take him to her. Upon arriving, he was angered to see that the doctors had lied to him; Anna was too weak even to speak to him. He remained with her until <b>he</b> <b>could</b> no longer <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> pulse. He kissed her lifeless lips and declared [...] "For you I lived [...] for you I die." ...|$|R
60|$|Gwendolen {{felt sure}} that he spoke in that way out of {{delicacy}} to her and Grandcourt--because he knew they must hear him; and that he probably thought {{of her as a}} selfish creature who only cared about possessing things in her own person. But whatever he might say, {{it must have been a}} secret hardship to him that any circumstances of his birth had shut him out from the inheritance of his father's position; and if he supposed that she exulted in her husband's taking it, what <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>feel</b> for <b>her</b> but scornful pity? Indeed it seemed clear to her that he was avoiding her, and preferred talking to others--which nevertheless was not kind in him.|$|R
60|$|She was {{standing}} in the far corner motionless, deadly pale, quivering from head to foot; and when he flung his arms round her, she gave a long sigh, closing her eyes. With his lips on hers, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> almost fainting; and he too had no consciousness of anything but that long kiss.|$|E
60|$|The {{warning was}} unnecessary, for the Canarios were already {{crouching}} {{forward in the}} surfboats bottom, and as Austin sprang in among them there was a whirr and a crash. The craft swayed beneath him; <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> dipping in the flood, but she rose with a staggering lurch, slanted slightly, and held down by something huge and heavy.|$|E
60|$|He drew {{a little}} closer to her, so close that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> {{shoulder}} under the shawl quivering against his arm. Her many petticoats brushed about his shins, and he could hear her quick, warm breath as it came and went. He bent his head quite close to her, as he had done that day, five years ago, in the mazes of the csárdás, and now--as then--his lips almost touched her soft young neck.|$|E
5000|$|Weakened {{by his own}} wounds, Beauchamp {{was loaded}} on a cart {{to be taken to}} the gallows and hanged before he bled to death.

6000|$|Chad {{was not in}} fact on this {{occasion}} to keep his promise of coming back; but Miss Gostrey had soon presented herself with an explanation of his failure. There had been reasons at the last for his going off with ces dames; and he had asked her with much instance {{to come out and}} take charge of their friend. She did so, Strether felt as she took her place beside him, in a manner that left nothing to desire. He had dropped back on his bench, alone again for a time, and the more conscious for little Bilham's defection of his unexpressed thought; in respect to which however this next converser was a still more capacious vessel. [...] "It's the child!" [...] he had exclaimed to her almost as soon as she appeared; and though her direct response was for some time delayed <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> in <b>her</b> meanwhile the working of this truth. It might have been simply, as she waited, that they were now in presence altogether of truth spreading like a flood and not for the moment to be offered her in the mere cupful; inasmuch as who should ces dames prove to be but persons about whom--once thus face to face with them--she found she might from the first have told him almost everything? This would have freely come had he taken the simple precaution of giving her their name. There could be no better example--and she appeared to note it with high amusement--than the way, making things out already so much for himself, he was at last throwing precautions to the winds. They were neither more nor less, she and the child's mother, than old school-friends--friends who had scarcely met for years but whom this unlooked-for chance had brought together with a rush. It was a relief, Miss Gostrey hinted, to feel herself no longer groping; she was unaccustomed to grope and as a general thing, he might well have seen, made straight enough for her clue. With the one she had now picked up in her hands there need be at least no waste of wonder. [...] "She's coming to see me--that's for YOU," [...] Strether's counsellor continued; [...] "but I don't require it to know where I am." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{wished that}} he knew the truth in the matter; or rather <b>he</b> wished <b>he</b> <b>could</b> know whether or no she were innocent, without knowing whether or no she were guilty. The fight in his hands would be {{conducted}} on terms so much more glorious if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> sure of <b>her</b> innocence. But then if he attempted that, and she were not innocent, all might be sacrificed by the audacity of his proceedings. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> not venture that, unless he were sure of his ground. For {{a moment or two}} he thought that he would ask her the question. He said to himself that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> forgive the fault. That it had been repented ere this he did not doubt, and it would be sweet to say to her that it was very grievous, but that yet it might be forgiven. It would be sweet to feel that she was in his hands, and that he would treat her with mercy and kindness. But then a hundred other thoughts forbade him to think more of this. If she had been, guilty,--if she declared her guilt to him,--would not restitution be necessary? In that case her son must know it, and all the world must know it. Such a confession would be incompatible with that innocence before the world which it was necessary that she should maintain. Moreover, he must be able to proclaim aloud his belief in her innocence; and how <b>could</b> <b>he</b> do that, knowing her to be guilty--knowing that she also knew that he had such knowledge? It was impossible that he should ask any such question, or admit of any such confidence.|$|R
6000|$|He {{could hear}} her sobbing; <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> agony {{dragging}} him to her. But no woman's arms should drug his anger, this time, to let it ache again. For once he definitely {{did not want to}} go to her. So futile to make up and quarrel, make up and quarrel. He was impatient that her distant sobs expressed so clearly a wordless demand that he come to her and make peace. [...] "Hell!" [...] he crawked; jerked his top-coat from its nail, and left the flat--eleven o'clock of a chilly November evening.|$|E
60|$|He {{laid her}} down on the bank. She was quite {{unconscious}} and running with water. He made the water come from her mouth, he worked to restore her. He did not have to work very long before he could feel the breathing begin again in her; she was breathing naturally. He worked a little longer. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> live beneath his hands; she was coming back. He wiped her face, wrapped her in his overcoat, looked round into the dim, dark-grey world, then lifted her and staggered down the bank and across the fields.|$|E
60|$|The {{instant he}} blew her candle out, {{she dropped the}} china candlestick, in a {{paroxysm}} of terror. It fell, and broke, with a deadened sound, {{on one of the}} many portfolios lying on the floor about her. He had hardly time to hear this happen, before the dumb moaning, the inarticulate cry of fear which was all that the poor panic-stricken girl could utter, rose low, shuddering, and ceaseless, in the darkness--so close at his ear, that he fancied <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> breath palpitating quick and warm on his cheek.|$|E
60|$|I do not {{suppose it}} was with the notion of keeping her weight down that Mrs. Alderling rowed a good deal on the cove before the cottage; but she had a boat, which she managed very well, and which she was out in, pretty much the whole time when she was not cooking, or eating or sleeping, or roaming the berry-pastures with me, or sitting to Alderling for his Madonnas. He did not care for the water himself; he said he knew every inch of that cove, and was tired of it; but he rather liked his wife's going, and they may both have had an {{unconscious}} relief from each other in the absences which her excursions promoted. She swam as well as she rowed, and often we saw her going down water-proofed to the shore, where we presently perceived her pulling off in her bathing-dress. Well out in the cove she had the habit of plunging overboard, and after a good swim, she rowed back, and then, discreetly water-proofed again, she climbed the lawn back to the house. Now and then she took me out in her boat, but so far as I remember, Alderling never went with her. Once I ventured to ask him if he never felt anxious about her. He said no, he should not have been afraid to go with her, and she could take better care of herself than <b>he</b> <b>could.</b> Besides, by means of their telepathy they were in constant communion, and <b>he</b> <b>could</b> make <b>her</b> <b>feel</b> at any sort of chance, that he did not wish her to take it, and she would not. This was the only occasion when he treated their peculiar psychomancy boastfully, and the only occasion when I felt a distinct misgiving of his sincerity.|$|R
6000|$|... “Well,” said Nettie with {{a little}} smile, though she <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> heart beating, “I feel more like a torpedo than ever just now.” ...|$|R
60|$|She <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> last {{strength}} going, and {{the barrel}} resisted her. Hans hurried to her, and the barrel went {{out from under}} Michael Dennin.|$|R
6000|$|... "Would {{you mind}} if I showed you my drawings? It would be awfully good of you. You could tell me about them." [...] And with dismay he saw her open a portfolio. While he {{scrutinized}} those schoolgirl drawings, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> looking at him, as animals do when they are making up their minds whether or no to like you; then she came and stood so close that her arm pressed his. He redoubled his efforts to find something good about the drawings. But in truth there was nothing good. And if, in other matters, he could lie well enough to save people's feelings, where Art was concerned he never could; so he merely said: ...|$|E
60|$|She leaned {{a little}} forward, and the madness fired his blood. Half stupefied, she yielded to his embrace, her lips rested upon his, her frightened eyes were half closed. His arms held {{her like a}} vise, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> heart {{throbbing}} madly against his. How long they remained like it he never knew--who can measure the hours spent in Paradise! She flung him from her at last, taking him by surprise with a sudden burst of energy, and before he could stop her {{she had left the}} room. In her place, the Baroness was standing upon the threshold, dressed in a wonderful blue wrapper, and with a cigarette between her teeth. She burst into a little peal of laughter as she looked into his distraught face.|$|E
60|$|Then honesty {{demanded that}} he probe his own feelings. Sternly, as if judging a renegade, he searched {{out in his}} simple way the truth. This big-eyed lass with her nameless charm would bewitch even a borderman, unless he avoided her. So much he had not {{admitted}} until now. Love he had never believed could be possible for him. When she fell asleep her hand had slipped from his arm to his fingers, and now rested there lightly as a leaf. The contact was delight. The gentle night breeze blew a tress of hair across his lips. He trembled. Her rounded shoulder pressed against him until <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> slow, deep breathing. He almost held his own breath lest he disturb her rest.|$|E
60|$|And for {{a minute}} {{it was his turn}} to study her. And study her he did, till she <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> cheeks {{flushing}} under his gaze.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Charmond embraced Grace {{more and}} more tightly, and the younger woman <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> neighbor's breathings grow deeper and more spasmodic, as though {{uncontrollable}} feelings were germinating.|$|R
60|$|I did {{not look}} at <b>her,</b> but I <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> standing, {{watching}} me. If I had looked up, she would, I knew, have held out her arms to me....|$|R
