25|$|The Lake Victoria basin while {{generally}} rural {{has many}} major centres of population. Its shores {{in particular are}} dotted with the key cities and towns, including Kisumu, Kisii, and Homa Bay in Kenya; Kampala, Jinja and Entebbe in Uganda; and Bukoba, Mwanza, and Musoma in Tanzania. These cities and towns also are home to many factories that discharge some chemicals directly into the lake or its <b>influent</b> rivers. Large parts of these urban areas also discharge untreated (raw) sewage into the river, increasing its eutrophication that in turn is helping to increase the invasive water hyacinth.|$|E
25|$|Thermal {{oxidation}} (or incineration) {{can also}} be an effective remediation technology. This approach is somewhat controversial because of the risks of dioxins released in the atmosphere through the exhaust gases or effluent off-gas. Controlled, high temperature incineration with filtering of exhaust gases however should not pose any risks. Two different technologies can be employed to oxidize the contaminants of an extracted vapor stream. The selection of either thermal or catalytic depends on the type and concentration in parts per million by volume of constituent in the vapor stream. Thermal oxidation is more useful for higher concentration (~4,000 ppmV) <b>influent</b> vapor streams (which require less natural gas usage) than catalytic oxidation at ~2,000 ppmV.|$|E
25|$|The <b>influent</b> in {{sewage water}} {{passes through a}} bar screen to remove all large objects like cans, rags, sticks, plastic packets etc. carried in the sewage stream. This is most {{commonly}} done with an automated mechanically raked bar screen in modern plants serving large populations, while in smaller or less modern plants, a manually cleaned screen may be used. The raking action of a mechanical bar screen is typically paced according to the accumulation on the bar screens and/or flow rate. The solids are collected and later disposed in a landfill, or incinerated. Bar screens or mesh screens of varying sizes {{may be used to}} optimize solids removal. If gross solids are not removed, they become entrained in pipes and moving parts of the treatment plant, and can cause substantial damage and inefficiency in the process.|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) in seven major {{wastewater treatment plants}} (WWTPs) in Beijing was investigated in the current study. We detected nine PFCs in all the wastewater and sludge samples. Perfluorooctane acid (PFOA) is the dominant PFCs in <b>influents</b> and effluents, while perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) is the major contaminant in sludge. The highest PFC concentration was found in plants at Qinghe and Jiuxianqiao WWTP, while the lowest was found at Fangzhuang WWTP. The total values of PFC range from 2. 88 to 176 ng/L in <b>influents,</b> from 5. 48 to 498 ng/L in effluents, and from 1. 21 to 32. 0 ng/g (dry wt) in sludge. The fact that effluents usually contain higher levels of PFCs than <b>influents</b> suggests that additional PFCs are produced during the wastewater treatment processes. However, PFOS decreases in effluents than in <b>influents</b> in 62 % of the water samples. This {{may be due to}} the adsorption and removal of the sludge during the active process. Perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (PFCAs) were found significantly correlated with each other in the effluents, which may indicate their similar sources or the existence of their potential precursors in the wastewater or treatment processes. The mass flows of PFC discharges into WWTPs are 0. 4 - 51. 4 mg/day, and the mass flows of PFCs in effluents exceed those in <b>influents</b> by 127 %. Domestic and commercial wastewaters are suggested to be the major sources of PFC pollution in WWTPs in Beijing...|$|R

40|$|International audienceMunicipal {{effluents}} {{are known}} to impede the immune system of aquatic organisms. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the immunotoxicity of urban wastewaters before and after 6 treatment processes from 12 cities toward trout leucocytes. Freshly prepared trout leucocytes were exposed to increasing concentrations of solid phase (C 18) extracts of wastewaters for 24 hr at 150 C. Immunocompetence was determined by following changes in leucocyte viability and the proportion of cells able to ingest at least one (immunoactivity) and at least three (immunoefficiency) fluorescent beads. The <b>influents</b> were treated by six different treatment strategies consisting of facultative aerated lagoons, activated sludge, biological aerated filter, biological nutrient removal, chemically-assisted physical treatment and trickling filter/solid contact. Water quality parameters of the wastewaters revealed that the plants effectively removed total suspended solids and reduced the chemical oxygen demand. The results revealed that the effluents' immunotoxic properties were generally more influenced by the properties of the untreated wastewaters than by the treatment processes. About half of the incoming <b>influents</b> decreased leucocyte viability while 4 treatment plants were able to reduce toxicity. The <b>influents</b> readily increased phagocytosis activity for 8 / 12 <b>influents</b> while it was decreased in 4 / 12 <b>influents.</b> This increase was abolished for 4 / 12 of the effluents using treatments involving biological and oxidative processes. In conclusion, municipal effluents have the potential to alter the immune system in fish and more research will be needed to improve the treatments of wastewaters to better protect the quality of the aquatic environment...|$|R
25|$|The {{quality of}} sewage sludge is {{controlled}} under section 405(d), where limitations are set with methods of use or disposal for pollutants in sludge. EPA, under section 405(d)(3), established a containment approach to limit pollutants instead of numerical limitations. This methodology is more reasonable than numerical limitations and includes design standards, equipment standards, management practice, and operational standards or combination of these. Limits on sewage sludge quality allows treatment works that generate less contaminated pollutants {{and those that do}} not meet the sludge quality standards for use and disposal practice must clean up <b>influent,</b> improve sewage sludge treatment and/or select another use of disposal method. EPA has set standards for appropriate practices of use and disposal of biosolids in order to protect public health and the environment, but choice of use or disposal practices are reserved to local communities. Listed under section 405(e) of CWA, local communities are encouraged to use their sewage sludge for its beneficial properties instead of disposing it.|$|E
25|$|The {{extinction}} of cichlids in the genus Haplochromis {{has also been}} blamed on the lake's eutrophication. The fertility of tropical waters depends on {{the rate at which}} nutrients can be brought into solution. The <b>influent</b> rivers of Lake Victoria provide few nutrients to the lake in relation to its size. Because of this, most of Lake Victoria's nutrients are thought to be locked up in lake-bottom deposits. By itself, this vegetative matter decays slowly. Animal flesh decays considerably faster, however, so the fertility of the lake is dependent on the rate at which these nutrients can be taken up by fish and other organisms. There is little doubt that Haplochromis {{played an important role in}} returning detritus and plankton back into solution. With some 80 percent of Haplochromis species feeding off detritus, and equally capable of feeding off one another, they represented a tight, internal recycling system, moving nutrients and biomass both vertically and horizontally through the water column, and even out of the lake via predation by humans and terrestrial animals. The removal of Haplochromis, however, may have contributed to the increasing frequency of algal blooms, which may in turn be responsible for mass fish kills.|$|E

These bioreactors had different technological configurations: conventional activated sludge (CAS) systems and very highly loaded A-stage systems. A-stage processes are proposed {{as the first step}} in an energy producing municipal wastewater treatment process. Pyrosequencing analysis indicated that bacterial community structure of all <b>influents</b> was similar. Also the bacterial community of all CAS bioreactors was similar. Bacterial community structure of A-stage bioreactors showed a more case-specific pattern. A core of genera was consistently found for all <b>influents,</b> all CAS bioreactors and all A-stage bioreactors, respectively, showing that different geographical locations in The Netherlands and Spain did not affect the functional bacterial communities in these technologies. The ecological roles of these bacteria were discussed. <b>Influents</b> and A-stage bioreactors shared several core general, while none of these were shared with CAS bioreactors communities. This difference is thought to reside in the different operational conditions of the two technologies. This study shows that bacterial community structure of CAS and A-stage bioreactors are mostly driven by solids retention time (SRT) and hydraulic retention time (HRT), as suggested by multivariate redundancy analysis.
