30|$|The Ka and Ks ratio {{has been}} used to denote the rate of {{divergence}} and methods of selection pressure. The value of less than, <b>equal</b> <b>to</b> <b>or</b> <b>great</b> than 1 have been considered as purifying, neutral or positive selection, respectively (Redwan et al. 2015). Pyrus pyrifolia revealed a lower divergence than P. persica from E. japonica as Ka and Ks between E. japonica and P. pyrifolia were much lower (Additional file 4 : Table S 4). Both Ka and Ks in IR regions were much lower than those in LSC and SSC (Table  5), which suggested that IR region evolved at a slower rate than LSC and SSC (Yi and Kim 2012). The Ka and Ks ratios of all gene groups were lower than 1, suggesting that a purifying selection might act on most E. japonica chloroplast genes.|$|R

30|$|Moreover, the {{negative}} affect variables (high, low activation) showed very skewed distributions {{that could not}} be corrected with standard data cleaning actions such as transformations (Hair et al. 1998; Tabachnick and Fidell 2007). Specifically, most participants scored very low on daily negative affect. To address the issue, each negative affect variable was dichotomized as “high” and “low” based on the values that partitioned the observations into pairs of relatively evenly sized categories. Specifically a) for high activation negative affect, scores <b>equal</b> <b>to</b> 12 <b>or</b> <b>greater</b> were considered “high” and coded as “ 1 ” (< 12 as “ 0 ”) and b) for low activation negative affect, scores <b>equal</b> <b>to</b> 11 <b>or</b> <b>greater</b> were considered “high” and coded as “ 1 ” (< 11 as “ 0 ”). Given binary variables, HGLM was used to test negative affect models using a log-link function with a Bernoulli distribution (Raudenbush et al. 2004). Specifically, unit-specific models (correcting for overdispersion) with robust standard errors were examined to determine the odds of scoring high on negative affect.|$|R
25|$|The {{age of the}} {{universe}} is estimated to be 13.8 billion years. While it is commonly understood that nothing can accelerate to velocities <b>equal</b> <b>to</b> <b>or</b> <b>greater</b> than that of light, it is a common misconception that the radius of the observable universe must therefore amount to only 13.8 billion light-years. This reasoning would only make sense if the flat, static Minkowski spacetime conception under special relativity were correct. In the real universe, spacetime is curved in a way that corresponds to the expansion of space, as evidenced by Hubble's law. Distances obtained as the speed of light multiplied by a cosmological time interval have no direct physical significance.|$|E
25|$|The {{common name}} {{alludes to the}} {{supposed}} ability these snakes have to launch themselves at an attacker during a strike, thereby bridging a distance that is <b>equal</b> <b>to</b> <b>or</b> <b>greater</b> than {{the length of the}} body. Mehrtens (1987) states that they live up to their name, striking at their assailants with such force that they actually leave the ground. Campbell and Lamar (2004), on the other hand, describe this as greatly exaggerated, saying that actually these snakes are only able to strike about half of their own body length. In addition, they describe them as slow moving and non-aggressive. However, when provoked all species will put on a rather dramatic open-mouthed threat display.|$|E
25|$|The ANA test detects the autoantibodies {{present in}} an individual's blood serum. The common tests used for {{detecting}} and quantifying ANAs are indirect immunofluorescence and {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA). In immunofluorescence, the level of autoantibodies is reported as a titre. This is the highest dilution of the serum at which autoantibodies are still detectable. Positive autoantibody titres at a dilution <b>equal</b> <b>to</b> <b>or</b> <b>greater</b> than 1:160 are usually considered as clinically significant. Positive titres of less than 1:160 are present in up to 20% of the healthy population, especially the elderly. Although positive titres of 1:160 or higher are strongly associated with autoimmune disorders, they are also found in 5% of healthy individuals. Autoantibody screening is useful in the diagnosis of autoimmune disorders and monitoring levels helps to predict the progression of disease. A positive ANA test is seldom useful if other clinical or laboratory data supporting a diagnosis are not present.|$|E

40|$|A novel #Plasmodium falciparum$ gene, denoted cg 2 gene, {{has been}} {{recently}} discovered, and a distinct genotype, characterized by 12 point mutations and 3 size polymorphisms, {{has been shown}} to be associated with chloroquine resistance in laboratory-adapted parasite strains. One of the polymorphic regions, denoted the omega region, consists of 16 tandem repeat units in chloroquine-resistant strains, while the chloroquine-sensitive strains have either less than <b>or</b> <b>equal</b> <b>to</b> 15 <b>or</b> <b>greater</b> than <b>or</b> <b>equal</b> <b>to</b> 17 repeat units. In this study, the in vivo and in vitro responses were compared with the number of repeat units in the omega region of the cg 2 gene for 75 Cameroonian isolates determined either by DNA sequencing or agarose gel electrophoresis. The 16 -repeat units that characterise the resistant strains were found in 10 chloroquine-sensitive isolates (50 % inhibitory concentration (IC 50) is less than 100 nM) and 30 chloroquine-resistant isolates (IC 50 is <b>greater</b> than <b>or</b> <b>equal</b> <b>to</b> 100 nM). Thirty-five isolates (28 chloroquine-sensitive isolates and 7 chloroquine-resistant isolates) displayed less than <b>or</b> <b>equal</b> <b>to</b> 15 <b>or</b> <b>greater</b> than <b>or</b> <b>equal</b> <b>to</b> 17 repeat units. Of the 18 patients (11 with isolates carrying 16 repeat units and 17 with isolates carrying less than <b>or</b> <b>equal</b> <b>to</b> 15 <b>or</b> <b>greater</b> than <b>or</b> <b>equal</b> <b>to</b> 17 repeat units) showed an adequate clinical response. The sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value were 81 % (83 %), 74 % (61 %), and 75 % (58 %), respectively compared with in vitro (or in vivo) responses.
