25|$|Despite his {{admitted}} cowardice, Flashman is a dab hand at fighting {{when he has}} to. Though he dodges danger {{as much as he}} can, {{and runs}} away when no one is watching, after the Piper's Fort incident, he usually controls his fear and often performs bravely. Almost every book contains one or more incidents where Flashman has to fight or perform some other daring action, and he holds up long enough to complete it. For instance, he is ordered to accompany the Light Brigade on its famous charge and rides {{all the way to the}} Russian guns. However, most of these acts of 'bravery' are performed only when he <b>has</b> <b>absolutely</b> no choice and to do anything else would result in his being exposed as a coward and losing his respected status in society, or being shot for desertion. When he can act like a coward with impunity, he invariably does.|$|E
500|$|Speculation that Rutherford was {{secretly}} buried at Beth Sarim {{has been called}} [...] "private rumor", 'frequently disproven', and [...] "myth". The May 4, 1942 issue of Time magazine noted Rutherford's burial at Rossville, New York, on Staten Island; a private burial plot for Watch Tower branch volunteers is on Woodrow Road. In 2002, a caretaker at the immediately adjoining graveyard answered an inquiry about Watch Tower's graveyard by noting, [...] "I couldn't tell you who is buried on it because it <b>has</b> <b>absolutely</b> no markers or headstones".|$|E

500|$|Additionally, Marc N. Kleinheinz at Screen Rant {{discussed}} how the series [...] "continues to resist a status quo", from the destruction and rebuilding of S.H.I.E.L.D., to {{the fallout from}} the Sokovia Accords. He noted that a major driving force behind the changes was the MCU films, with the series being forced [...] "to constantly adapt to a changing narrative landscape that it <b>has</b> <b>absolutely</b> no control over." [...] He also believed that the series was obligated to adapt various Marvel characters to screen which wouldn't be appearing in films, such as Daisy Johnson, Mockingbird, and Ghost Rider. However, Kleinheinz felt that this mindset also came from within the series crew rather than just from Marvel, saying, [...] "there's also the storytelling modus operandi that showrunners Jed Whedon and Maurissa Tancharoen have very obviously demonstrated during their four-year tenure. It seems that constantly staking out new ground from season to season is just as much a personal predilection as it is, possibly, a corporate mandate." ...|$|E

Martin went on to further explain that the word [...] "yellow" [...] <b>has</b> <b>absolutely</b> no meaning whatsoever and while writing the rest of the song he tried his best to change [...] "yellow" [...] to something else since every lyric before yellow made no sense but in the end the word [...] "yellow" [...] just sounded right. Martin also told Stern that through the years depending on the attitude and manner of whoever interviews him, he would make up some story about a song or album titles just {{to move on to the}} next question. Martin applauded Stern saying [...] "I like you, Howard, so that's the first time I've ever told anyone the truth behind 'Yellow'." ...|$|E
500|$|Costa's {{singing voice}} is a {{combination}} of classical and pop singing. Aurora's songs were recorded within the first year of production. Costa would practice her songs live with the orchestra before recording them. After working on the film for three years, Costa finally finished recording in 1955, long before the film was completed; it would take the animators another several years to complete the footage to accompany Costa's vocals and dialogue. Costa would often return to the studio to re-record lines as the story changed and evolved, which she described as a [...] "painstaking" [...] process. However, with only 18 spoken lines, Aurora speaks less than any other main character in a full-length Disney animated feature – aside from Dumbo, who is completely silent – and <b>has</b> <b>absolutely</b> no dialogue once she is awoken from her deep sleep. The character's lack of dialogue is attributed to the fact that she remains asleep {{for the majority of the}} film. Ultimately, Costa's performance in Sleeping Beauty – and Walt Disney himself – inspired her to pursue a full-time career as a professional opera singer. Costa's salary was $250 per week.|$|E

500|$|Rise Against {{finished}} recording their sixth studio album, Endgame, in January 2011, after recording some last-minute guest vocals. The {{lyrics of}} the album focus on real world events, such as Hurricane Katrina and the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. According to McIlrath, although the lyrics discuss grim topics, they actually take on a positive view and were written from the perspective of: [...] "What if the place {{on the other side}} of this transition is a place we'd all rather be living in?" [...] On January 12, 2011, Rise Against announced the release date of Endgame as March 15, 2011. Although Spin Magazine labeled Endgame as a concept album, on January 7, 2011, McIlrath tweeted a clarifying message stating that [...] "the record is not a concept record and, fret not, <b>has</b> <b>absolutely</b> nothing to do with the Dixie Chicks." [...] The first single from the album, [...] "Help Is on the Way", debuted on KROQ on January 17. A second song from the album, [...] "Architects", was debuted and released digitally on February 15. As a promotion effort, the band embarked on a short tour of South America in February and then a month-long tour of Europe in March. Upon returning to the United States, the band announced a U.S. spring tour with Bad Religion and Four Year Strong.|$|E
500|$|They {{discover}} a nearby planet that {{shows signs of}} a previous civilization but has been stripped of all industrial and mechanical elements, similar to destruction found several months ago to Federation outposts bordering the Romulan Neutral Zone. Moments later, they detect and are then met by a much larger, cube-shaped vessel which does not answer their hails. Guinan warns Picard that the ship belongs to the Borg, a powerful, cyborg-like race that nearly wiped out her people, scattering the survivors across the galaxy, and again urges Picard to leave immediately or face certain destruction. Though Picard orders the Enterprise shields raised, a single, speechless Borg transports into Engineering and begins to probe the Enterprises computer systems. Lt. Worf (Michael Dorn) initially attempts to incapacitate the intruder with his phaser set on stun, which <b>has</b> <b>absolutely</b> no effect, and is forced to increase power in order to neutralize the Borg. Immediately afterwards, a second Borg appears and [...] continues probing the computer, proving to be immune to phaser fire. Completing its mission, it strips several components from the dead Borg, then transports away and the dead Borg disintegrates. The Borg ship then contacts the Enterprise and demands their surrender. The Borg then immobilizes the Enterprise with a tractor beam, disables the shields, and uses a cutting beam to slice into the saucer section to remove a cross-section of the ship, killing eighteen people.|$|E
