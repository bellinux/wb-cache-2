5|$|A {{mendelevium}} atom has 101 electrons, {{of which}} at least three (and perhaps four) can act as valence electrons. They {{are expected to be}} arranged in the configuration 5f137s2 (ground state term symbol 2F7/2), although <b>experimental</b> <b>verification</b> of this electron configuration had not yet been made as of 2006. In forming compounds, three valence electrons may be lost, leaving behind a 5f12 core: this conforms to the trend set by the other actinides with their 5fn electron configurations in the tripositive state. The first ionization potential of mendelevium was measured to be at most (6.58±0.07)eV in 1974, {{based on the assumption that}} the 7s electrons would ionize before the 5f ones; this value has since not yet been refined further due to mendelevium's scarcity and high radioactivity. The ionic radius of hexacoordinate Md3+ had been preliminarily estimated in 1978 to be around 91.2pm; 1988 calculations based on the logarithmic trend between distribution coefficients and ionic radius produced a value of 89.6pm, as well as an enthalpy of hydration of −(3654±12)kJ·mol−1. Md2+ should have an ionic radius of 115pm and hydration enthalpy −1413kJ·mol−1; Md+ should have ionic radius 117pm.|$|E
5|$|A {{nobelium}} atom has 102 electrons, {{of which}} three {{can act as}} valence electrons. They {{are expected to be}} arranged in the configuration 5f147s2 (ground state term symbol 1S0), although <b>experimental</b> <b>verification</b> of this electron configuration had not yet been made as of 2006. In forming compounds, all the three valence electrons may be lost, leaving behind a 5f13 core: this conforms to the trend set by the other actinides with their 5fn electron configurations in the tripositive state. Nevertheless, {{it is more likely that}} only two valence electrons may be lost, leaving behind a stable 5f14 core with a filled 5f14 shell. The first ionization potential of nobelium was measured to be at most (6.65±0.07)eV in 1974, based on the assumption that the 7s electrons would ionize before the 5f ones; this value has since not yet been refined further due to nobelium's scarcity and high radioactivity. The ionic radius of hexacoordinate and octacoordinate No3+ had been preliminarily estimated in 1978 to be around 90 and 102pm respectively; the ionic radius of No2+ has been experimentally found to be 100pm to two significant figures. The enthalpy of hydration of No2+ has been calculated as 1486kJ·mol−1.|$|E

25|$|According to Neil deGrasse Tyson, {{the central}} {{difference}} between the nature of science and religion is that the claims of science rely on <b>experimental</b> <b>verification,</b> while the claims of religions rely on faith, and these are irreconcilable approaches to knowing. Because of this both are incompatible as currently practiced and the debate of compatibility or incompatibility will be eternal. Philosopher and physicist Victor J.

25|$|Interest in the JTE {{increased}} {{after its}} first <b>experimental</b> <b>verification.</b> Various model systems were developed probing {{the degree of}} degeneracy {{and the type of}} symmetry. These were solved partly analytically and partly numerically to obtain the shape of the pertinent potential energy surfaces (PES) and the energy levels for the nuclear motion on the JT-split PES. These energy levels are not vibrational energy levels in the traditional sense because of the intricate coupling to the electronic motion that occurs, and are better termed vibronic energy levels. The new field of ‘vibronic coupling’ or ‘vibronic coupling theory’ was born.|$|E

25|$|On {{returning}} to DuPont in 1984, Arduengo resumed {{a position in}} CR and continued the research into the recently discovered ADPO molecule and related structures. This line of research proved to be extremely fruitful and resulted in a steady string of publications on new and unusual bonding arrangements.

25|$|The {{dynamical}} Casimir {{effect is}} {{the production of}} particles and energy from an accelerated moving mirror. This reaction was predicted by certain numerical solutions to quantum mechanics equations made in the 1970s. In May 2011 an announcement was made {{by researchers at the}} Chalmers University of Technology, in Gothenburg, Sweden, of the detection of the dynamical Casimir effect. In their experiment, microwave photons were generated out of the vacuum in a superconducting microwave resonator. These researchers used a modified SQUID to change the effective length of the resonator in time, mimicking a mirror moving at the required relativistic velocity. If confirmed this would be the first <b>experimental</b> <b>verification</b> of the dynamical Casimir effect.|$|E
25|$|<b>Experimental</b> <b>verification</b> of {{gravitational}} redshift using terrestrial sources took several decades, {{because it is}} difficult to find clocks (to measure time dilation) or sources of electromagnetic radiation (to measure redshift) with a frequency that is known well enough that the effect can be accurately measured. It was confirmed experimentally {{for the first time in}} 1959 using measurements of the change in wavelength of gamma-ray photons generated with the Mössbauer effect, which generates radiation with a very narrow line width. The Pound–Rebka experiment measured the relative redshift of two sources situated at the top and bottom of Harvard University's Jefferson tower. The result was in excellent agreement with general relativity. This was one of the first precision experiments testing general relativity. The experiment was later improved to better than the 1% level by Pound and Snider.|$|E

500|$|Instead, Goeppert became {{interested}} in physics, and chose to pursue a Ph.D. In her 1930 doctoral thesis she worked out the theory of possible two-photon absorption by atoms. Eugene Wigner later described the thesis as [...] "a masterpiece of clarity and concreteness". At the time, the chances of experimentally verifying her thesis seemed remote, but {{the development of the}} laser permitted the first <b>experimental</b> <b>verification</b> in 1961 when two-photon-excited fluorescence was detected in a europium-doped crystal.:Eu2+ |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=7 |issue=6 |pages=229–232 |year=1961 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.7.229|bibcode = 1961PhRvL...7..229K }} To honor her fundamental contribution to this area, the unit for the two-photon absorption cross section is named the Goeppert-Mayer (GM) unit. One GM is 10−50 cm4 s photon−1. Her examiners were three Nobel prize winners: Max Born, James Franck and Adolf Otto Reinhold Windaus (in 1954, 1925, and 1928, respectively).|$|E
500|$|Calculations have {{confirmed}} {{the accuracy of}} this simple extrapolation, although <b>experimental</b> <b>verification</b> of this is currently impossible as the half-lives of the known tennessine isotopes are too short. Significant differences between tennessine and the previous halogens are likely to arise, largely due to spin–orbit interaction— the mutual interaction between the motion and spin of electrons. The spin–orbit interaction is especially strong for the superheavy elements because their electrons move faster— at velocities comparable to the speed of light— than those in lighter atoms. In tennessine atoms, this lowers the 7s and the 7p electron energy levels, stabilizing the corresponding electrons, although two of the 7p electron energy levels are more stabilized than the other four. The stabilization of the 7s electrons is called the inert pair effect; the effect that separates the 7p subshell into the more-stabilized and the less-stabilized parts is called subshell splitting. Computational chemists understand the split as a change of the second (azimuthal) quantum number l from 1 to 1/2 and 3/2 for the more-stabilized and less-stabilized parts of the 7p subshell, respectively. For many theoretical purposes, the valence electron configuration may be represented to reflect the 7p subshell split as [...]|$|E
