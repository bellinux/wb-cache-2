An algorithm that adjusts video Presentation Time Stamp (PTS) based on audio PTS is presented, which aims at the problem that audio is not synchronized with video existing during playback.

40|$|A motion compression/reconstruction method {{based on}} max t-norm {{composite}} fuzzy relational equations (MCF) is proposed, where a motion sequence {{is divided into}} intra-pictures (<b>I-pictures)</b> and predictive-pictures (P-pictures). The <b>I-pictures</b> and the P-pictures are compressed by using uniform coders and non-uniform coders, respectively. A design method of non-uniform coders is proposed to perform eective compression/reconstruction of the P-pictures based on an overlap level of fuzzy sets and a fuzzy equalization. An experiment using 10 P-pictures conrms that the root means square error of the proposed method is decreased to 89 : 4 % of {{that one of the}} uniform coders under the condition that compression rate is 0. 0057.

Adaptive, application-layer channel coding for broadband wireless, compared to a fixed-rate code, reduces the bitrate overhead by several percent.

40|$|Abstract —This paper {{proposes a}} dynamic GOP {{structure}} selection method to provide seamless video streaming for vertical handoff in the heterogeneous wireless network. The proposed method dynamically changes the interval of Ipictures {{by using the}} received signal strength indication (RSSI) and the pilot strength (Ec/Io) {{in order to reduce}} error propagation due to packet losses. Thus, with the proposed method, the client can always receive the <b>I-picture</b> right after vertical handoff. Experimental results show that the proposed method can significantly reduce the video quality degradation caused by vertical handoff in the realtime video encoding applications.

3000|$|SVA-based MVC {{experiments}} are implemented on the JMVM 7.0 reference software with seven multiview video sequences and their ROI masks, Ballet, Breakdancers, Doorflowers, Alt Moabit, Pantomime, Champagne tower, and Dog, {{to evaluate the}} effectiveness of the proposed SVA-based bit allocation. The MVC-HBP prediction structure is adopted for MVC simulation. Eight views and GOP Length are 15, fast motion/disparity estimation is enabled, and search range is 64. There are three kinds of picture in the MVC-HBP prediction structure: intracoded picture (<b>I-picture),</b> interpredicted picture (P-picture), and hierarchical bidirectional predicted picture (B-picture). In the coding experiment, all B- and P-pictures are coded with regional bit allocation optimization and I-pictures are coded with original MVC scheme without bit allocation optimization. The bQP is set as 12, 17, 22, 27, or 32, and the QPs of background and ROI are set according to (16) and obtain optimal [...]...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — An image {{registration}} technique for compressed video such as motion JPEG or the <b>I-picture</b> of MPEG is investigated in this paper. The proposed technique {{is based on}} the DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform) coefficient matching. First, the coarse edge features are extracted by applying several edge detectors to luminance DC coefficients. Each detector generates one difference map for a single input image. A threshold is set up for each difference map to produce a binary map. Then, the alignment parameters are determined based on the binary maps of both input images generated by the same detector. Finally, the actual displacement in the pixel domain is calculated by averaging parameters from all detectors. It is shown by experimental results that the proposed method reduces the computational cost of {{image registration}} dramatically as compared with the pixel domain and edgebased DCT domain registration techniques while achieving certain quality of composition.

40|$|In this paper, error-resilient schemes are {{proposed}} to support robust video transmission for digital terrestrial TV broadcasting (DTTB). In particular, a temporal error concealment incorporated with a low-complexity block-matching is developed, achieving an effective reception of predictive pictures in harsh terrestrial environment. Special algorithms are also designed for isolated <b>I-pictures.</b> Moreover, {{combined with an}} intra/inter case prediction, an adaptive error concealment scheme is further contrived to fit for different error conditions. Extensive simulations have been conducted under various DTTB channel conditions, even with a very high packet error rate, to verify {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed schemes...|$|R
30|$|Recall {{from the}} PWD design {{that the concept}} of EPL-based {{priority}} weighting has been demonstrated to be successful, and the above inequality was slightly modified to be ωAC_VI ≧ ωAAC_VI, where the equality holds only when non-real-time I-packets (from AAC_VI) encounter real-time P-packets of least importance (from AC_VI), e.g. P 8 -packets in the case of Fig.  2 a. Also recall that the importance levelling of EPL is linearly descending from the leading <b>I-picture</b> to its subsequent P-pictures within a given GOP, and the values of ωAC_VI are proportional to the corresponding EPL values and equally spaced among the range [0.5, 1]. Meanwhile, the normalisation condition ωAAC_VI = 1 − ωAC_VI constraints the values of ωAAC_VI to be within [0, 0.5]. Hence, it is difficult in general for non-real-time I-packets to compete with any type of real-time packets, and the best chance is to get an equal weighting factor when a non-real-time I-packet encounters a real-time P-packet of least importance at the head-of-line. Obviously, this could be the weakness of PWD because I-packets with long delays can induce much more serious error propagation than any subsequent P-packets within the same GOP in terms of the decoded video quality at the video receiver when exceeding the playback deadline.|$|E
40|$|UnrestrictedSeveral {{challenging}} {{issues for}} applications of image/video mosaicking and upsampling with high resolution are addressed here, {{all of which}} are mainly conducted in DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform) domain so that lower computation complexity can be achieved.; First of all, color matching and compensation techniques are proposed to remove the seam lines between image boundaries due to the different color tones of the inputs. Color deviation of each input image is corrected first and color differences between input images are then compensated using the polynomial-based contrast stretching technique. The proposed approach is attractive for its lower computational complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that the color-matching problem can be satisfactorily solved in the compressed domain even when the DCT blocks of original input images are not aligned.; Two block-level image registration techniques for compressed video such as motion JPEG or the <b>I-picture</b> of MPEG are investigated. The proposed methods are based on edge estimation and extraction in DCT domain so that the computational cost of image registration is reduced dramatically while achieving certain quality of composition. In order to reach higher accuracy of registration, hybrid block/pixel level alignment, is proposed so that the displacement vector resolution can be enhanced from the block level to the pixel level. The inverse DCT transform is not performed to the whole image but only to some selected blocks. It is shown by experiments that the proposed algorithm saves around 40 % of the computational complexity while achieving the same quality.; In the last part, a content adaptive technique is proposed to upsample an image to an output image of higher resolution. The proposed technique is a block-based processing algorithm that offers the flexibility in choosing the most suitable up-sampling method for a particular block type. Block classfication is fist conducted in the DCT domain to categorize each image block into several types: smooth areas, textures, edges and others. For the plain background and smooth surfaces, simple patches are used to enlarge the image size without degrading the resultant visual quality. The unsharp masking method is applied to the textured region to preserve high frequency components. Since human eyes are more sensitive to edges, we adopt a more sophisticated technique to process edge blocks. That is, they are approximated by a facet model so that the image data at subpixel positions can be generated accordingly. A post-processing technique such as 1 D directional unsharp masking can be used to enhance edge sharpness furthermore. Experimental results are given to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed techniques...|$|E
