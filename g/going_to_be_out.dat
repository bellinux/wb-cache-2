500|$|The period {{following}} Enema of the State saw {{the band}} experience great transition. [...] "We {{had gone from}} playing small clubs and sleeping on people's floors to headlining amphitheaters and staying in five-star hotels," [...] recalled Hoppus in 2013. [...] "After years of hard work, promotion, and nonstop touring, people knew who we were, and listened to what we were saying... it scared {{the shit out of}} us." [...] The band was rushed into recording the follow-up, as according to DeLonge, [...] "the president of MCA was penalizing us an obscene amount of money because our record wasn't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> in time for them to make their quarterly revenue statements. [...] And we were saying, 'Hey, we can't do this right now, we need to reorganize ourselves and really think about {{what we want to do}} and write the best record we can.' They didn't agree with us." ...|$|E
500|$|On April 17, 2015, Hanigan hit {{his first}} {{home run in}} a Red Sox uniform off of Ubaldo Jiménez of the Baltimore Orioles. The two run shot tied the game that Boston {{eventually}} won in walk-off fashion. On May 1, 2015, Hanigan left the game after a ball struck his hand after Mark Teixeira got struck in his hand first. The next day, X-rays tested positive that Hanigan's hand was fractured, placing him on the 15-day disabled list. The Red Sox projected that he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> indefinitely but other sources projected that the injury did not end his 2015 year. On May 3, 2015, Hanigan {{was placed on the}} 60-day disabled list. Hannigan finished the season with a [...]171 batting average. On November 2, 2016, the Red Sox declined to pick up Hanigans team option, thus making him a free agent.|$|E
500|$|In October 2010, Jackman {{confirmed}} that Aronofsky would direct the film. Jackman commented that with Aronofsky directing, Wolverine 2 {{will not be}} [...] "usual" [...] stating, [...] "This is, hopefully for me, <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> of the box. It's {{going to be the}} best one, I hope... Well, I would say that, but I really do feel that, and I feel this is going to be very different. This is Wolverine. This is not Popeye. He's kind of dark... But, you know, this is a change of pace. Chris McQuarrie, who wrote The Usual Suspects, has written the script, so that'll give you a good clue. [...] going to make it fantastic. There's going to be some meat on the bones. There will be something to think about as you leave the theater, for sure".

500|$|Wale {{had wanted}} to {{collaborate}} with Lady Gaga on the track since January 2009, believing that she embodied the party-record feel of the song. He explained: [...] "If music was a high school, I feel like I'll be the dude on the football team, {{and it would be}} like, 'OK, Gaga's having a party!' And you know all the bad girls are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> there." [...] Upon hearing that some were surprised by the collaboration, Wale went on to say, [...] "If Jay-Z can work with Coldplay, then Wale should be able to work with Gaga." [...] Wale's mentor, Mark Ronson, sent the track to Gaga. She commented that her portion of the song, which includes lyrics such as [...] "Lookin' at, lookin' at, lookin' at me/ Eyes all stickin' like honey on bees", is narcissistic, but in a positive way. The lyrics capture the life and image of Wale's home areas Maryland and District of Columbia. About incorporating the hook in the song, Gaga said: ...|$|E
500|$|In March 2013, {{researchers}} {{published the}} DNA {{sequence of the}} genome of a strain of HeLa cells. The Lacks family discovered this when the author Rebecca Skloot informed them. There were objections from the Lacks family about the genetic information that was available for public access. [...] Jeri Lacks Whye, a grandchild of Henrietta Lacks, said to The New York Times, [...] "the biggest concern was privacy - what information was actually <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> there about our grandmother, and what information they can obtain from her sequencing that will tell them about her children and grandchildren and going down the line". [...] That same year another group working on a different HeLa cell line's genome under NIH funding submitted it for publication. In August 2013, an agreement was announced between {{the family and the}} National Institutes of Health that gave the family some control over access to the cells' DNA sequence found in the two studies along with a promise of acknowledgement in scientific papers. In addition, two family members will join the six-member committee which will regulate access to the sequence data.|$|E
500|$|During pre-season, {{ahead of}} the 2006–07 campaign, May injured his {{shoulder}} in training, resulting in him missing the club's pre-season tour of Iceland. Millwall manager Nigel Spackman revealed that May's injury would rule {{him out of the}} first two months of the season — [...] "He fell over during the close season, and it looks like he is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> for a couple of months". He made his first appearance of the season in October 2006, coming on as a second-half substitute in Millwall's 2–0 home win against Bournemouth in the Football League Trophy, scoring Millwall's second goal with his first touch of the game. In his first start of the season, he scored after six minutes in the club's 2–1 FA Cup win against Havant & Waterlooville in a game played at Fratton Park, netting from close range after good work from Chris Hackett. Five days later, he provided the assist for Darren Byfield's goal in a 2–2 home draw with Doncaster Rovers. May scored his third goal in five appearances when he scored in Millwall's 3–1 loss at Nottingham Forest on 24 November 2006. After Millwall's 2–0 home win against Bradford City, a game in which May assisted Filipe Morais in scoring Millwall's first goal, Millwall manager Willie Donachie stated — [...] "There's more to come from this team, especially Darren Byfield and Ben May, who are as good as anyone in this league. They're committed, honest players who want to work for each other". Three days later, on 12 December 2006, May's pacey cross resulted in Nathan Doyle putting the ball into his own net, giving Millwall a 1–0 win against Bradford City after extra-time in the FA Cup. May scored the only goal of the game in a 1–0 victory at Yeovil Town on 3 February 2007, converting Darren Byfield's cross to give Millwall the three points. However, he was substituted after 53 minutes in the same game with an ankle injury, and in March 2007, he was ruled out of first-team action {{for the rest of the}} 2006–07 season. Despite this, he made a second-half substitute appearance on the last day of the season in a 2–2 draw at Bradford City, assisting Darren Byfield's goal just after coming on. May scored four times in 19 appearances in a season disrupted by injuries.|$|E

One, the elder, had a bagpipe whose bag was patched with shirting: the younger was dressed in greenish clothes, he had his face lifted, and was yelling the verses of the unintelligible Christmas ballad: short, rapid verses, followed by a brilliant flourish on a short wooden pipe he held ready in his hand. Alvina felt he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> of breath. But no, rapid and high came the next verse, verse after verse, with the wild scream on the little new pipe in between, {{over the roar of}} the bagpipe. And the crumbs of snow were like a speckled veil, faintly drifting the atmosphere and powdering the littered threshold where they stood--a threshold littered with faggots, leaves, straw, fowls and geese and ass droppings, and rag thrown out from the house, and pieces of paper.|$|E

Sir Thomas went over noiselessly to the side table, where the decanters were standing, and helped himself to a brandy and seltzer, squeezing down the cork of the bottle carefully with his thumb, to prevent its popping, till all the gas had escaped piecemeal. Then he crept back, still noiselessly, feeling more like a convicted thief himself than a Knight Commander of the Most Honourable Order of the Bath, and wondering when the deuce this pilfering lock-breaker was going to begin his nightly depredations. Not till after Harry came back most likely. The thief, whoever he or she was, would probably be afraid to venture into the library while there was still a chance of Harry returning unexpectedly and disturbing the whole procedure. But when once Harry had gone to bed, they would all have heard from Morton that Sir Thomas was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> late, and the thief would then doubtless seize so good an opportunity of helping himself unperceived to the counted sovereigns.|$|E
