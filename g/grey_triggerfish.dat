5|$|The most {{significant}} predator of S.latus is the <b>grey</b> <b>triggerfish,</b> Balistes capriscus, although {{a number of}} other fish species have also been reported to prey on S.latus, including dusky groupers (Epinephelus guaza), combers (Serranus spp.), Mediterranean rainbow wrasse (Coris julis), red groupers (Epinephelus morio) and gag groupers (Mycteroperca microlepis). An Octopus vulgaris has been observed to eat S.latus in an artificial setting, but it is unclear whether S.latus is preyed on by octopuses in nature.|$|E

50|$|Some {{species of}} triggerfish, {{such as the}} titan triggerfish, may be ciguatoxic and should be avoided. Others, such as the <b>grey</b> <b>triggerfish</b> (Balistes capriscus), are {{excellent}} table-fare.|$|E
50|$|The <b>grey</b> <b>{{triggerfish}}</b> (Balistes capriscus) is a ray-finned {{fish in the}} triggerfish family. The {{species is}} native to shallow parts of the western Atlantic from Nova Scotia to Argentina and also the eastern Atlantic, the Mediterranean Sea and off Angola {{on the west coast}} of Africa.|$|E
50|$|In its {{appearance}} and habits, the <b>grey</b> <b>triggerfish</b> {{is a typical}} member of the genus Balistes except for its drab, uniformly grey colouration. It is a relatively small fish, usually less than 2.3 kg (5 lb) in weight. It is fished recreationally and despite its tough skin, is an excellent food-fish.|$|E
50|$|Locomotion in the <b>grey</b> <b>triggerfish</b> is {{by means}} of {{undulations}} of the dorsal fins. If threatened, the fish can work its way into a protective crevice and wedge itself in place by erecting its front dorsal spine. It is difficult to dislodge from this position. The second spine {{is connected to the}} first and when it is depressed, it triggers the unlocking of the first spine.|$|E

50|$|The <b>grey</b> <b>triggerfish</b> is fished recreationally around Florida and elsewhere. It {{is known}} as a notorious bait stealer and is found over hard bottom in 20 to 40 m depths off the Atlantic Coast of Florida, often in {{association}} with black sea bass and red snapper. Because of its bony mouth it needs a small sharp hook which is usually baited with squid or cut bait. The flesh is of high quality but the consumption of this fish has been linked to isolated cases of ciguatera poisoning.|$|E
50|$|The <b>grey</b> <b>triggerfish</b> is principally a fish of shallow {{waters in}} the western Atlantic Ocean. Its native range extends from Nova Scotia to the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico and Bermuda, and southwards to Argentina. It is {{typically}} found over hard bottoms on reefs and rocky areas, in lagoons and in bays, at depths down to about 55 m. It is also found {{on the other side}} of the Atlantic, around the British Isles, in the Mediterranean Sea and off the coast of Angola. It may have crossed the Atlantic as a result of the movement of water in the Gulf Stream. It does not breed in the waters around Britain but does do so in the Mediterranean.|$|E
50|$|The <b>grey</b> <b>triggerfish</b> is a {{demersal}} species and feeds on bottom-dwelling invertebrates such as shrimps, crabs, molluscs, sea urchins, sand dollars, starfish and sea cucumbers. It has strong teeth specialised for making holes in hard-shelled prey. An interesting feeding behaviour has been observed, {{in which the}} fish positions itself vertically above a sandy seabed and puffs a stream of water out of its mouth. This disturbs the substrate and may reveal something edible. Further puffs expose more, and the prey item is gripped with the fish's sharp teeth and removed from the seabed. If it is a sand dollar, the fish drops it and picks it up again several times until the prey lands upside down. The fish then adopts its vertical stance once more and attacks the middle with closed jaws, crushing the soft central area. It then scoops out and devours the flesh.|$|E
50|$|The <b>grey</b> <b>triggerfish</b> is a {{medium-sized}} fish that can grow to 60 cm, {{but a more}} common length is 44 cm. The small beak-like mouth {{at the tip of}} the snout has fleshy lips. The eyes are set far back near the top of the head. The body is laterally compressed and deep-bodied with a tough, leathery skin. The front dorsal fin has three spines, the first being very strong and much longer than the other two. The second dorsal fin has 26 to 29 soft rays and is much the same size and shape as the anal fin directly below it which has no spines and 23 to 26 soft rays. The pectoral fins are small and rounded. The outer rays of the caudal fin are elongated in larger individuals. The scales on the head and front half of the body are large while those on the hind half are smaller and smooth.|$|E
40|$|The fish catch {{statistics}} of <b>grey</b> <b>triggerfish</b> (Balistes capriscus) in Ghana from 1972 to 2003 have suggested a possible 'regime shift' of triggerfish in coastal waters of Ghana. This suggests possible influence of local environmental parameters (sea surface temperature, salinity and coastal wind speed) and/or exploitation on <b>grey</b> <b>triggerfish</b> resource. The observed variability in environmental conditions and triggerfish landings off Ghana occurred seasonally. Time series analyses of sea surface temperature, salinity and coastal wind speed from alongshore recording stations of Marine Fisheries Research Division in Tema, Ghana and Ghana Meteorological Agency {{over the period}} 1974 - 2004 suggest possible link between local environmental parameters and triggerfish catch in Ghana. Again, the identification of maximum mean temperature partitioning (between the periods 1972 - 76 and 1985 - 89) and maximum mean critical temperature (in 1987) support {{the notion of the}} contribution of sea warming in the disappearance of the triggerfish resource. The insights from the seasonal time series analysis of salinity and wind speed suggest their seasonal control of sea temperature and hence the major coastal cooling along the coast of Ghana. Size-weight relationships of grey and blue-spotted triggerfish indicate that for a given size <b>grey</b> <b>triggerfish</b> tends to weigh less than blue-spotted triggerfish. However, in both equations the exponent for length is sufficiently close to 3. 0, a situation which indicates that B. capriscus and B. punctatus grow isometrically. The maximum age of triggerfish in this study was age 11 which is lower than previously reported age of <b>grey</b> <b>triggerfish</b> in northeastern Gulf of Mexico. The asymptotic length, L&# 8734; was greater and rate of growth, K slower than previously reported for the <b>grey</b> <b>triggerfish</b> in Ghana. The estimated natural mortality, M for <b>grey</b> <b>triggerfish</b> (0. 40) in this study (derived from Rikhter and Efanov's method) was found to be lower than Ofori-Danson's estimates (0. 81) on Ghana <b>grey</b> <b>triggerfish</b> stocks in 1980. <b>Grey</b> <b>triggerfish</b> exploitation ratio (0. 2727) obtained in this study shows that the triggerfish resource is underexploited as compared to the exploitation ratio of 0. 67 derived from 1980 growth results of <b>grey</b> <b>triggerfish.</b> There is indication that Balistes capriscus and Balistes punctatus have habitat overlap in the western Gulf of Guinea. The gut analysis of B. capriscus and B. punctatus indicate that both triggerfish species are more planktivorous at juvenile stage (12. 0 - 21. 9 cm size class) and more benthivorous at later stage in life. The gut analysis of B. capriscus in this study is much comparable to the previous stomach content analysis in 1980 and hence, the possibility of change in diet might not have been the cause of triggerfish disappearance in Ghanaian coastal waters...|$|E
40|$|Unlike other balistids, <b>grey</b> <b>triggerfish</b> Balistes capriscus {{occur in}} social groups in {{subtropical}} reef assemblages {{and have been}} noted to cooperate in capturing large crustacean prey. The objective {{of this study were}} to determine the structure of dominance hierarchies of these social groups and the factors that influence hierarchies of wild-caught <b>grey</b> <b>triggerfish</b> in a naturalistic setting. From observations of four groups of triggerfish (n = 19 fish) in both dyad and group (4 – 5 fish) settings, we provide a description of triggerfish behaviors and coloration patterns and an explanation of the social context in which suites of behaviors are used by dominant, middle-ranking, and subordinate fish. Sixteen behaviors and nine coloration patterns were noted for <b>grey</b> <b>triggerfish.</b> <b>Grey</b> <b>triggerfish</b> groups form linear hierarchies in both dyads and groups as measured by Landau’s Index of Linearity (h = 1. 0 for Groups 1, 3, and 4 and h = 0. 95 for Group 2 in dyads; h = 1. 0 for all groups in group settings). Dyadic hierarchies, however, were not necessarily good predictors of the hierarchies found in larger group settings, as they only predicted two of the four group hierarchies. Sex played no role in influencing status or behavior. Size had the greatest influence on dominance status, with larger fish being more dominant than smaller fish. An individual’s dominance ranking influenced both body coloration and posture. These results suggest that color patterns and body postures may also be used by observers as an indicator of an individual’s social status in groups [Current Zoology 56 (1) : 18 – 35 2010]...|$|E
40|$|Fifteen live {{specimens}} of Conchoderma virgatum {{were attached to}} a <b>grey</b> <b>triggerfish</b> (Balistes capriscus) caught in S. W. Portugal. The barnacles were distributed in three groups (right abdominal external face, anterior side of the insertion of the pelvic spine, and close to (5 mm) the left eye (on the lacrymal bone)). The specimens were very different in size, ranging from 2 mm to 18. 9 mm (maximum capitular length, CL). The four largest barnacles (CL 16. 4 mm) had egg lamellae. Signs of potential predation on the barnacles (rests of barnacles and half-cut cirri in a barnacle) were detected. The left-eye blindness of the grey trigger fish could {{have been caused by}} traumatic action performed by the barnacles that settled close to the eye. The skin surrounding the barnacle cluster attached to the right abdominal external face was inflamed. Skin lesions were of sub-acute or chronic nature and the gall-bladder dilatation was consistent with a prolonged status of injury. Both traumatic and inflammatory lesions could have contributed to the loss of body condition of the <b>grey</b> <b>triggerfish.</b> This study is the first report of C. virgatum in S. W. Portugal and the first record of attachment to a <b>grey</b> <b>triggerfish...</b>|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the parasitic inventory of Balistes capriscus (Teleostei: Balistidae) (B. capriscus) from the Gulf of Gabès (Southern Tunisia, Central Mediterranean Sea). Methods: A parasitological {{survey of the}} <b>grey</b> <b>triggerfish</b> B. capriscus (Gmelin, 1788) from the Gulf of Gabès (Southern Tunisia, Central Mediterranean Sea) was conducted monthly from May 2007 to April 2009. A total of 480 fishes were collected from commercial catches by pelagic trawl net at different fishing ports at Chebba (34 ° 14 ' N, 11 ° 06 ' E), Kerkennah (34 ° 45 ' N, 11 ° 17 ' E) and Zarzis (33 ° 41 ' N, 11 ° 48 ' E). The weight, the size, the sex, the date and the area of capture of each specimen were recorded. B. capriscus were then examined to search for ectoparasites and endoparasites. For each parasite species, parasitological indices were calculated. Results: Five species of parasites were identified, among which a new species of Digenea Hypocreadium caputvadum was discovered and two species of parasites were reported {{for the first time}} in the Mediterranean. Conclusions: It is the first inventory of the ecto and endoparasites of <b>grey</b> <b>triggerfish</b> collected from the Gulf of Gabès Mediterranean Sea...|$|E
40|$|The monthly {{analysis}} of maturity stage frequency suggested that spawning of the <b>grey</b> <b>triggerfish</b> Balistes capriscus (Gmelin, 1788) is annual, total and occurs from November to February {{in the south}} of São Paulo State, Brazil. Size at first maturity is 169 mm for females and 200 mm for males. Condition factor estimated considering and disconsidering gonad weight (K and K') showed maximum values related to periods of higher frequency of females at advanced maturity stage. &# 916;K was higher in December, January and February, and was related to the maximum frequency of mature females. As K estimates the gonad condition it {{could be used as a}} maturity and breeding season index for this species. The gonadosomatic relation behaved the same as K values...|$|E
40|$|Chondroitin sulfate/dermatan sulfate GAGs were {{extracted}} and purified {{from the}} skins of <b>grey</b> <b>triggerfish</b> (GTSG) and smooth hound (SHSG). The disaccharide composition produced by chondroitinase ABC treatment showed {{the presence of}} nonsulfated disaccharide, monosulfated disaccharides ΔDi 6 S and ΔDi 4 S, and disulfated disaccharides in different percentages. In particular, the nonsulfated disaccharide ΔDi 0 S of GTSG and SHSG were 3. 5 % and 5. 5 %, respectively, while monosulfated disaccharides ΔDi 6 S and ΔDi 4 S were evaluated to be 18. 2 %, 59 % and 14. 6 %, 47. 0 %, respectively. Capillary elecrophoresis analysis of GTSG and SHSG contained 99. 2 % and 95. 4 % of chondroitin sulfate/dermatan sulfate, respectively. PAGE analysis showed a GTSG and SHSG having molecular masses with average values of 41. 72 KDa and 23. 8 KDa, respectively. HCT 116 cell proliferation was inhibited (p< 0. 05) by 70. 6 % and 72. 65 % at 200 μg/mL of GTSG and SHSG respectively.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} season, size and sex on the dynamic of gill metazoan parasite infesting the Balistes capriscus (Gmelin, 1788) (Teleostei: Balistidae) (B. capriscus) of the Gulf of Gabès (Southern Tunisia, Central Mediterranean Sea). Methods: A parasitological survey of the <b>grey</b> <b>triggerfish</b> B. capriscus from the Gulf of Gabès (Southern Tunisia, Central Mediterranean Sea) was conducted monthly from June 2011 to June 2012. A total of 1080 fish were collected from commercial catches by pelagic trawl net at different fishing ports at Chebba (34 ° 14 ' N, 11 ° 06 ' E), Kerkennah (34 ° 45 ' N, 11 ° 17 ' E) and Zarzis (33 ° 41 ' N, 11 ° 48 ' E). The weight, size, sex, date and area of capture of each specimen were recorded. Then, B. capriscus was examined to search for ectoparasites. For each parasite species, parasitological indices were calculated. Results: The parasite species are indentified as two copepods: Naobranchia variabilis, Taneacanthus ballistae and a monogenean: Ancyrocephalus balisticus.

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} the spawning activity using gonadosomatic index (GSI) and gonad histology the Balistes capriscus (Teleostei: Balistidae) of the Gulf of Gabès (Southern Tunisia, Central Mediterranean Sea). Methods: The reproductive biology of the species, based on 756 (480 females and 276 males), collected from commercial catches at several fishing ports including Chebba, Kerkennah and Zarzis at respective GPS coordinates (34 ° 14 ' N, 11 ° 06 ' E), (34 ° 45 ' N, 11 ° 17 ' E), (33 ° 41 ' N, 11 ° 48 ' E) was studied over 28 months (January 2008 -April 2010) using GSI and gonad histology. Sizes {{used in this}} study ranged from 11. 30 to 45. 60 cm in fork length. Results: Both GSI and gonad histology suggest that spawning activity occurred mainly between July and mid-September with a peak in July, coinciding with summer time. The first maturation occurred at 20. 26 cm fork length for females and 21. 30 cm fork length for males. The monthly values of hepatosomatic index and condition factor (K) indicated that the liver is the main organ responsible for the mobilization process of the energizing reserves during the sexual cycle. Conclusions: It is the first inventory of gonadal maturation and histological observations of the <b>grey</b> <b>triggerfish</b> Balistes capriscus Gmelin, 1789 (Teleostei: Balistidae) in the Gulf of Gabès, (Southern Tunisia, Central Mediterranean Sea) ...|$|E
40|$|A new {{and more}} {{comprehensive}} estimation method for stock-production models is proposed, to provide more reliable stock assessment when data availability is limited. Using difference equations to implement a non-equilibrium production model, the new approach (named POEEM, for Process and Observation Errors Estimation Method) incorporates uncertainties due to both process and observation errors, employing a non-linear model fitting approach. The method has been evaluated using both simulated and real data sets, and {{has been applied to}} data from some Brazilian fish stocks. The weighting ratio between process and observation errors {{has proved to be a}} crucial factor in determining the model results, and a fully satisfactory method for selecting this ratio is still required. Sensitivity analyses conducted with the simulated data have been used to study the behaviour of the method for a range of exploitation and noise levels. Data series with low and medium levels of noise yielded consistent results irrespective of the level of exploitation, whereas very noisy data series did not provide reliable results. For comparison, data from a previously analysed stock was also tested with POEEM and resulted in peculiar results for the stock status and management advice. Data from four demersal species caught o® southeastern Brazilian coast were also analysed employing POEEM, and more conventional methods. For all of them further analyses on mapping some parameters sensitivity must be conducted in order to increased the reliability of the results. Two species have the POEEM estimated assessment trend corroborated by independent biological studies. King weakfish is apparently on the verge of a collapse, with very low levels of production and biomass. Jamaican weakfish is around its maximum sustainable yield and the exploitation level on this stock should not be intensified. For the other two species, high levels of uncertainty were responsible for contradictory outcomes. For whitemouth croaker, the balance between process and observation error could not be consistently achieved, because of high amount of observation noises. For <b>grey</b> <b>triggerfish,</b> the assessment revealed a collapsed stock, but previous biological studies do not corroborate this scenario. Discarding onboard and fleet behaviour appear to be confusing the analysis of this data series. In general, the new method seems to be capable of giving useful results, consistent with biological studies, when a limited amount of data is available. However, further work is needed to find a satisfactory method for fixing the weighting ratio. In order to improve the Brazilian stock assessments, both fishery and biological data must be continuously collected to maintain and update the results, and e®ort data needs to be collected for other fleets, and incorporated in the analysis.
