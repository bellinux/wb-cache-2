40|$|The paper {{explores the}} {{question}} of how the EC and several European governments almost simultaneously launched research and technological development programmes during the 1980 s.

An analytical approach of policy diffusion is outlined in order to study the linkages between national and EU policy processes. A policy diffusion perspective, which entails how policies are formed in a communication between various national political-administrative systems, can be seen as an important contribution {{to the study of the}} dynamics behind the European integration process. It is suggested that the OECD with <b>its</b> <b>informal</b> <b>and</b> non-hierarchical cooperation structure is an institutional condition for policy diffusion, and that this type of cooperation also can be found within the EU. The EU, which can be characterized as a type of multilevel governance, enhances communication between national political-administrative systems and thus the processes of policy diffusion...|$|R

However, well before the crisis, calls for a new order in global economic governance had mounted as the credibility and importance of existing patterns of global governance had waned.

By way of <b>its</b> <b>informal</b> <b>and</b> non-legal structure, the G 20 has been able to promote international cooperation between interdependent states in some areas. Among other things, the G 20 rapidly coordinated international stimulus packages to contain the recent financial crisis.

However, the informal, soft-law, nature appears to threaten the effectiveness of the G 20, as it leaves it without an effective mechanism for ensuring compliance of its agreements.

It is sculpted by Liss Eriksson (1919-2000) in 1954 and was inaugurated in 1967. It retells the memory from the artist's childhood of when he during sleepless night {{used to sit}} on his bed {{to stare at the}} moon through his window. Made of sandstone and wrought iron, its stylized form contrasts the warmth of <b>its</b> expression; <b>its</b> <b>informal</b> <b>and</b> restrained manners {{making it one of the}} most appreciated pieces of art in the city, fondled by crowds of tourists every year, as the shiny head shows, and given coins and goodies, while Stockholmers occasionally knits neckerchiefs and caps for the boy to wear during winters. [...] According to the artist, the smallness of the sculpture enlarges the empty space around it, and, as this empty space is part of the sculpture, it is actually a rather large piece of art. Martin Stugart, an expert on the history of Stockholm, writes the coins tourists give to the sculpture, in spite of the advices given by the guides, are collected by the Finnish Church which attempts to restrain the phenomenon. According to the low-key cult surrounding the boy, however, stealing these coins means bad luck as the child sees everything but forgets nothing.|$|R

The purpose of this dissertation is to reexamine the historical basis of adult education in the United States by critically examining the contributions radical German-American workers made towards the development of workers' education. Focusing on German-American workers in nineteenth-century Chicago, the study investigates the impact this community had on in introducing radical socialist ideas to the larger American society. The study is guided by recent research into immigrant working-class life by both European and American labor historians. Sources include both German and English language newspapers, memoirs and reminiscences of contemporaries, and various published and unpublished documents. The study begins by reviewing the major histories of American adult education, arguing that workers' education in general, and immigrant workers' education in particular, has been excluded from the study of American adult education. The study then argues that by failing {{to take into account the}} contributions of English adult education historians and American labor historians, adult education in the United States has developed an apolitical and ahistorical perspective which ignores the rich traditions of radical adult education. The study then traces the development of a radical German-American working-class culture in which education, in both <b>its</b> <b>informal</b> <b>and</b> nonformal contexts, was intimately interwoven. Workers' clubs, radical newspapers, and social clubs, as well as informal learning experiences are examined to determine how radical and socialist ideas were introduced and adapted to American society. The dissertation concludes by examining the impact of German-American radicalism on workers' education and its implications for reconceptualizing the history of American adult education...|$|R
