50|$|In July 2000 the Øresund Bridge was inaugurated, {{creating}} a <b>fixed</b> <b>rail</b> and road link between Sweden and Denmark.|$|R
50|$|Joints {{are used}} where the moving points meet the <b>fixed</b> <b>rails</b> of the switch. They allow the points to hinge easily between their positions. Originally the movable switch blades were {{connected}} to the <b>fixed</b> closure <b>rails</b> with loose joints, but since steel rails are somewhat flexible {{it is possible to}} make this join by thinning a short section of the rail itself. This can be called a heelless switch.|$|R
50|$|A recent {{development}} of tramway {{technology has been}} the guided bus (or tram on tyres), a rubber-tyred vehicle guided by a <b>fixed</b> <b>rail</b> in the ground, which draws current from overhead electric wires like a conventional tram.|$|R
50|$|A {{development}} of the guided bus is the tramway on tyres, in which a vehicle is guided by a <b>fixed</b> <b>rail</b> in the road surface and draws current from overhead electric wires (either via pantograph or trolley poles).|$|R
25|$|Various methods {{exist for}} <b>fixing</b> the <b>rail</b> to the sleeper. Historically spikes {{gave way to}} cast iron chairs fixed to the sleeper, more {{recently}} springs (such as Pandrol clips) are used to <b>fix</b> the <b>rail</b> to the sleeper chair.|$|R
5000|$|A Rubber-tyred [...] "tram" [...] is a {{trolleybus}} {{which is}} guided by a <b>fixed</b> <b>rail</b> {{on the ground and}} uses overhead cables like a conventional tram. This can allow the vehicles to match the capacity of conventional trams and cope with gradients up to 13% due to the rubber tyres. There are two systems which use this technology: the Guided Light Transit (GLT) and Translohr. The GLT [...] "trams" [...] are legally considered buses as they have steering wheels and can leave the <b>fixed</b> <b>rail</b> when requirements dictate e.g. when journeying to a depot while a Translohr [...] "tram" [...] cannot operate without a guidance rail and are generally not considered buses.|$|R
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a rail-bound transport system comprising self-propelled vehicles running along a <b>rail</b> system, <b>fixed</b> <b>rail</b> sections and movable rail sections, shunted wagons, lifts, turntables, etc. The rail-bound transport system {{is characterized by}} the vehicles having at least one bumper to prevent them travelling over open rail ends and having at least a stopping element for the fixed and movable open rail ends, which are movable between an operating point at which they stop the vehicle on contact with the bumper, and an external operating point at which they permit the passage of the vehicle, the transition of the contact element from operating point to external operating point taking place by means of an operating equipment, when a moving rail end is positioned in relation to the open <b>fixed</b> <b>rail</b> end such that a vehicle can travel over the joint position...|$|R
50|$|A rail {{fastening}} system {{is a means of}} <b>fixing</b> <b>rails</b> to railroad ties (North America) or sleepers (British Isles, Australasia, and Africa). The terms rail anchors, tie plates, chairs and track fasteners are used to refer to parts or all of a {{rail fastening}} system. Various types of fastening have been used over the years.|$|R

25|$|A {{rapid transit}} system is an {{electric}} railway characterized by high speed and rapid acceleration. It uses passenger railcars operating singly or in multiple unit trains on <b>fixed</b> <b>rails.</b> It operates on separate rights-of-way {{from which all}} other vehicular and foot traffic are excluded (i.e. is fully grade separated from other traffic). It uses sophisticated signaling systems, and high platform loading.|$|R
25|$|The {{principle}} of a rail connection to Heathrow {{from the south}} had {{been the subject of}} considerable discussion and study for 50 years. Since 1960, there have been more than 10 studies or proposals that considered how to improve surface access to Heathrow by means of an additional <b>fixed</b> <b>rail</b> link and in 1984 studies confirmed the viability of the link.|$|R

50|$|In March 2002, the pylons {{emerged from}} the ground. The speed of {{construction}} then rapidly increased. Every three days, each pylon increased in height by 4 m. This performance was mainly due to sliding shuttering. Thanks {{to a system of}} shoe anchorages and <b>fixed</b> <b>rails</b> {{in the heart of the}} pylons, a new layer of concrete could be poured every 20 minutes.|$|R

25|$|These {{innovations}} he {{based on}} functional grounds: the block size, {{to enable the}} creation of a quiet interior open space (60 m by 60 m) and allow ample sunlight and ventilation to its perimeter buildings; the rectilinear geometry, the wide streets and boulevards to sustain high mobility and the truncated corners to facilitate turning of carts and coaches and particularly vehicles on <b>fixed</b> <b>rails.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{option for}} a new <b>fixed</b> <b>rail</b> link has {{implications}} for several wider transport proposals. One of the proposed routes for an Irish Sea Tunnel is from Fishguard, which would generate large amounts of extra freight traffic which the current Severn tunnel—already operating at capacity—could not handle. Additionally, a new high-speed rail route has been suggested between London, Bristol, and Cardiff, which faces similar capacity constraints.|$|R

50|$|An {{overhead}} crane, {{commonly called}} a bridge crane, {{is a type}} of crane found in industrial environments. An overhead crane consists of parallel runways with a traveling bridge spanning the gap. A hoist, the lifting component of a crane, travels along the bridge. If the bridge is rigidly supported on two or more legs running on a <b>fixed</b> <b>rail</b> at ground level, the crane is called a gantry crane (USA, ASME B30 series) or a goliath crane (UK, BS 466).|$|R
50|$|In 1803 the tramway {{was made}} double-track, with the {{exception}} of Stodhart Tunnel and below Buxton Road Bridge, using the same method of <b>fixing</b> the <b>rails.</b>|$|R

Light rail vehicles are typically driven electrically with power being drawn from an overhead electric line via a trolley [...] or a pantograph; driven by an operator on board the vehicle; and may have either high platform loading or low level boarding using steps." ...|$|R
50|$|Top-{{carriage}} recoil {{is where}} the gun is mounted in an upper carriage that moves on wheels on <b>fixed</b> <b>rails.</b> The gun and upper carriage recoil together, restrained by the usual hydraulic buffers. Return to battery is effected either by gravity, {{through the use of}} inclined rails, which the gun and carriage have run up, by springs, or even by rubber bands, on some improvised mounts. It is not well-suited to firing at high elevations because it cannot absorb much of the vertical component of the recoil force.|$|R
50|$|The {{need for}} a whistle on a {{locomotive}} exists because trains move on <b>fixed</b> <b>rails</b> and thus are uniquely susceptible to collision. This susceptibility is exacerbated by a train's enormous weight and inertia, which {{make it difficult to}} quickly stop when encountering an obstacle. Hence a means of warning others of the approach of a train from a distance is necessary. As train whistles are inexpensive compared to other warning devices, the use of loud and distinct whistles became the preferred solution for railway operators.|$|R
25|$|Amtrak trains serve {{both the}} nearby Windsor Locks and Windsor stations. The Hartford Line, which is {{expected}} to begin service in 2018, will increase the speed, frequency and reliability of trains along the corridor. Presently, 12 trains serve Windsor Locks station daily. This is expected to increase to 32 in 2018 and 70 by 2020. Plans call for every train at Windsor Locks Station to be met by a shuttle bus connection directly to and from the terminal. Officials have discussed plans to construct a <b>fixed</b> <b>rail</b> link to the airport.|$|R
50|$|Railway {{signalling}} is {{a system}} used to direct railway traffic and keep trains clear of each other at all times. Trains move on <b>fixed</b> <b>rails,</b> making them uniquely susceptible to collision. This susceptibility is exacerbated by the enormous weight and inertia of a train, which {{make it difficult to}} quickly stop when encountering an obstacle. In the UK, the Regulation of Railways Act 1889 introduced a series of requirements on matters such as the implementation of interlocked block signalling and other safety measures {{as a direct result of}} the Armagh rail disaster in that year.|$|R
50|$|Trains move on <b>fixed</b> <b>rails,</b> {{making them}} uniquely {{susceptible}} to collision. This susceptibility {{is exacerbated by}} the enormous weight and inertia of a train, which {{make it difficult to}} quickly stop when encountering an obstacle. Also, trains generally do not stop at grade crossings (level crossings), instead relying upon pedestrians and vehicles to clear the tracks when they pass. Therefore, from their beginnings locomotives have been equipped with loud horns or bells to warn vehicles or pedestrians that they are coming. Steam locomotives had steam whistles, operated from steam produced by their boilers.|$|R
25|$|Fang bolts or {{rail anchor}} bolts {{have also been}} used for <b>fixing</b> <b>rails</b> or chairs to sleepers. The fang bolt is a bolt {{inserted}} {{through a hole in}} the sleeper with a fanged nut that bites into the lower surface of the sleeper. For fastening flat-bottomed rails, an upper-lipped washer can be used to grip the edge of the rail. They are more resistant to loosening by vibrations and movement of the rail. They are thought more effective than spikes and screws and so are used in positions such as switch (point) tieplates and on sharp curves.|$|R

40|$|Public {{transport}} advocates {{argue that}} if higher density housing were promoted around transport hubs or along transport corridors, particularly those with tramlines, that this would achieve {{a significant increase in}} public transport use. This advocacy is mistaken in the case of Melbourne because only a small proportion of jobs is located close to <b>fixed</b> <b>rail</b> or tram routes. This helps explain the key empirical finding of this paper: only a tiny minority of employed persons who live within walking distance of a train station or a tram stop in Melbourne actually use the train or tram for journeys to work...|$|R
50|$|Imagine a one {{kilometre}} {{length of}} CWR {{that has some}} stress in it. The rail is restrained by being fixed to the sleepers/ties. Also imagine a one kilometre length of rail {{lying on the ground}} next to the track. In a hot summer, the unconstrained rail lying next to the track is going to expand, while the <b>fixed</b> <b>rail</b> will experience compression. The unconstrained rail will expand to become longer than one kilometre. Likewise, in extreme cold, the unfixed rail will shrink and become shorter than one kilometre, while the rail that is constrained to one kilometre in length will experience tension.|$|R
50|$|In 1933, a {{decision}} was made to gradually convert the system to trolley buses (trackless trams). Slowed by the effects of the Great Depression and World War II, the process took 15 years to compete. On 5 September 1948, the last two <b>fixed</b> <b>rail</b> trams ran along Neil Avenue and Main Street. A lack of investment in maintenance of the tracks, as well as the age of the automobile had slowly brought the demise of the system. The trolley buses did not last long either, being gradually replaced by diesel buses as well. The last trolley bus ran on 30 May 1965.|$|R
50|$|Several {{attempts}} {{had been}} made since Anderson's cancellation of HART to construct a <b>fixed</b> <b>rail</b> mass transit system. All attempts stalled in Honolulu City Council hearings until in 2004, the city, county and state approved development of an action plan for a system {{to be built in}} several phases. The initial line proposed linking Kapolei in West Oahu to the University of Hawaii at Manoa. However, on December 22, 2006 the city council approved a fixed-guideway system meant to accommodate either rail or buses, running from Kapolei in West Oahu to Ala Moana, with spurs into Waikiki and Manoa.|$|R
