Since the 1970s, particularly {{from the time of}} the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 in the United States, and since the Insolvency Act 1986 in the UK, two broad strands of thought emerged. The first and very prominent view, stemming primarily from work by Thomas H. Jackson and Douglas Baird is known as the [...] "creditors' bargain model". The authors posited (adapting visibly a methodology from A Theory of Justice (1971) by John Rawls) that if one wished to determine what the best bankruptcy rules were, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>discovered</b> by imagining that hypothetically all creditors, secured and unsecured, could set down and reach an agreement about how assets would be distributed. Jackson, Baird and other co-authors argued that the primary (and almost exclusively) good thing that modern insolvency law achieves is to create a collective debt collection mechanism among creditors. Imagining what would happen if the law did not have collective insolvency rules, it was argued there would be significant increase in costs as individual creditors attempted to ensure repayment, namely (1) the costs of uncertainty in racing to court to claim one's entitlement, and so higher, duplicated monitoring costs by each creditor before a company goes insolvency (2) the risk that a company would be dismantled bit by bit, when acting together creditors would agree that a company could be kept or sold as a going concern, and (3) higher administrative costs of collecting debts individually, when a collective procedure would save time and money. Such individual action exemplifies both the economic model of the prisoners' dilemma (because without knowing or trusting what another individual does, everyone can reach worse outcomes for the group) and the tragedy of the commons (because individual action leads to quicker depletion and exhaustion of a common pool of resources, as opposed to collective planning to preserve assets for future use). Hypothetically, all creditors would agree by consent for their mutual benefit to set up a collective procedure. In reality, transaction costs and hold-up problems prevent mutual agreements being made. But then the law should mimic what would have been agreed in absence of such real world costs. Jackson and Baird further argue that hypothetical creditors would also choose pari passu distribution, but also it is [...] "a key assumption that consensually negotiated security interests have aggregate efficiencies". The law protecting security interests should be inviolable, because it increases the amount of credit available to a company, which through the continuation of business indirectly benefits all creditors. Any other groups of creditor, if they lose out from this insolvency model, ought to be protected by labour, tort or social insurance laws outside the scope of insolvency law.

60|$|I {{have done}} with the forms of government. During {{the course of my}} inquiry you may have {{observed}} a very material difference between my manner of reasoning and that which is in use amongst the abettors of artificial society. They form their plans upon what seems most eligible to their imaginations, for the ordering of mankind. I discover the mistakes in those plans, from the real known consequences which have resulted from them. They have enlisted reason to fight against itself, and employ its whole force to prove that it is an insufficient guide to them in the conduct of their lives. But unhappily for us, in proportion as we have deviated from the plain rule of our nature, and turned our reason against itself, in that proportion have we increased the follies and miseries of mankind. The more deeply we penetrate into the labyrinth of art, the further we find ourselves from those ends for which we entered it. This has happened in almost every species of artificial society, and in all times. We found, or we thought we found, an inconvenience in having every man the judge of his own cause. Therefore judges were set up, at first, with discretionary powers. But it was soon found a miserable slavery to have our lives and properties precarious, and hanging upon the arbitrary determination of any one man, or set of men. We fled to laws as a remedy for this evil. By these we persuaded ourselves we might know with some certainty upon what ground we stood. But lo! differences arose upon the sense and interpretation of those laws. Thus we were brought back to our old incertitude. New laws were made to expound the old; and new difficulties arose upon the new laws; as words multiplied, opportunities of cavilling upon them multiplied also. Then recourse was had to notes, comments, glosses, reports, responsa prudentum, learned readings: eagle stood against eagle: authority was set up against authority. Some were allured by the modern, others reverenced the ancient. The new were more enlightened, the old were more venerable. Some adopted the comment, others stuck to the text. The confusion increased, the mist thickened, until <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>discovered</b> no longer what was allowed or forbidden, what things were in property, and what common.

5000|$|Choniates {{gives an}} account of John's rivalry with the epi tou kanikleiou (keeper of the {{imperial}} inkstand), Theodore Styppeiotes, who was deposed and blinded at Manuel's orders in 1158/9. According to Choniates, John resented the fact that, although formally less powerful than John, who was logothetes tou dromou, Styppeiotes' office allowed him immediate access to and therefore influence on the emperor. Consequently, Styppeiotes managed to have his own ideas promoted, while John [...] "saw his demands dispersed {{in the air like}} dreams". Frustrated, John forged a correspondence between Styppeiotes and the Norman king of Sicily, William II (r. 1166-89), which he hid so that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>discovered</b> easily.

Other authors give different reasons for Styppeiotes' downfall, and the details of Choniates' version have been proven to be inaccurate, at least in their chronology, by the historian Otto Kresten. Nevertheless, as Choniates {{was a member of the}} Constantinopolitan bureaucracy and well-informed about its recent history, it is very likely that his information that John succeeded Styppeiotes as mesazon (chief minister), before being replaced as both logothetes tou dromou and mesazon by Michael Hagiotheodorites, is correct.|$|E

5000|$|In 1158/9, however, {{while on}} {{campaign}} in Cilicia, Manuel ordered Styppeiotes {{to be arrested}} and blinded. The reasons for this act are unclear, with different reasons being given by contemporary authors. According to John Kinnamos he publicly announced some kind of prophecy according to which Manuel would die soon, and that [...] "the Roman senate should no longer grant power to a strapping young man, but to a man of properly advanced years, in order that under him, ruling by the letter by learning the affairs of state might be managed as in a democracy". The German chronicler Rahewin, on the other hand, reports that the kanikleios had hired three men to assassinate Manuel, but that the empress discovered the plot and informed the emperor. Niketas Choniates gives a rather different account, which according to the historian Paul Magdalino may represent the [...] "unofficial" [...] version of the affair, but the details of which were proven to be mostly fictitious by the Byzantinist Otto Kresten. According to Choniates, Styppeiotes' downfall {{was the result of}} his rivalry with John Kamateros, the logothetes tou dromou, who became frustrated with the special relationship between Styppeiotes and the emperor; Styppeiotes's goals were being fulfilled through his constant ties to Manuel while Kamateros's limited access to the emperor resulted in his demands never being met. Kamateros therefore forged a correspondence between Styppeiotes and the Norman king of Sicily, William II (r. 1166-89), which he hid so that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>discovered</b> easily. Styppeiotes was ultimately charged with treason by Kamateros, resulting in Emperor Manuel having Styppeiotes blinded and his tongue severed. Styppeiotes' downfall coincided with the blinding of Michael Glykas and the escape of the emperor's cousin and future emperor Andronikos I Komnenos (r. 1182-85), and although the Byzantine sources make no explicit connection, it is very likely connected to both events. As a result it may indicate, according to Magdalino, both of a faction at court which desired a return to a more consensus-based mode of ruling, with the emperor consulting with the Senate as was the practice before the rise of the Komnenoi, as well as of a pro-Sicilian faction opposed to Manuel's pro-German stance, manifested in his alliance with the Hohenstaufen and reinforced by his empress, Bertha of Sulzbach.|$|E

40|$|In {{magnetized}} plasma physics, {{almost all}} developed analytic theories assume a Maxwellian distribution function (MDF) {{and in some}} cases small deviations are described using the perturbation theory. The deviations with respect to the Maxwellian equilibrium, called kinetic effects, are required {{to be taken into account}} specially for fusion reactor plasmas. Generally, because the perturbation theory is not consistent with observed steady-state non-Maxwellians, these kinetic effects are numerically evaluated by very CPU-expensive codes, avoiding the analytic complexity of velocity phase space integrals. We develop here a new method based on analytic non-Maxwellian distribution functions constructed from non-orthogonal basis sets in order to (i) use as few parameters as possible, (ii) increase the efficiency to model numerical and experimental non-Maxwellians, (iii) help to understand unsolved problems such as diagnostics discrepancies from the physical interpretation of the parameters, and (iv) obtain analytic corrections due to kinetic effects given by a small number of terms and removing the numerical error of the evaluation of velocity phase space integrals. This work does not attempt to derive new physical effects even if <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> possible to <b>discover</b> one from the better understandings of some unsolved problems, but here we focus on the analytic prediction of kinetic corrections from analytic non-Maxwellians. As applications, examples of analytic kinetic corrections are shown for the secondary electron emission, the Langmuir probe characteristic curve, and the entropy.

6000|$|But yet, {{though the}} public opinion of the mass <b>could</b> not <b>be</b> {{depended}} on, there was a body left, distinct from the mass, and priding itself so much on that distinctness that it was ready to say at times--of course in more courteous--at least in what it considered more Scriptural language: [...] "This people which knoweth not the law is accursed." [...] To it therefore--to the religious world--some over-sanguine Sanitary Reformers turned their eyes. They saw in it ready organised (so it professed) for all good works, a body {{such as the world}} had never seen before. Where the religions public of Byzantium, Alexandria, or Rome numbered hundreds, that of England numbered its thousands. It was divided, indeed, on minor points, but it was surely united by the one aim of saving every man his own soul, and of professing the deepest reverence for that Divine Book which tells men that the way to attain that aim is, to be good and to do good; and which contains among other commandments this one--"Thou shaft not kill." [...] Its wealth was enormous. It possessed so much political power, {{that it would have been}} able to command elections, to compel ministers, to encourage the weak hearts of willing but fearful clergymen by fair hopes of deaneries and bishoprics. Its members were no clique of unpractical fanatics--no men less. Though it might number among them a few martinet ex-post-captains, and noblemen of questionable sanity, capable of no more practical study than that of unfulfilled prophecy, the vast majority of them were landowners, merchants, bankers, commercial men of all ranks, full of worldly experience, and of the science of organisation, skilled all their lives in finding and in employing men and money. What might not be hoped from such a body, to whom that commercial imperium in imperio of the French Protestants which the edict of Nantes destroyed was poor and weak? Add to this that these men's charities were boundless; that they were spending yearly, and on the whole spending wisely and well, ten times as much as ever was spent before in the world, on educational schemes, missionary schemes, church building, reformatories, ragged schools, needlewomen's charities--what not? No object of distress, <b>it</b> seemed, <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>discovered,</b> no fresh means of doing good devised, but these men's money poured bountifully and at once into that fresh channel, and an organisation sprang up for the employment of that money, as thrifty and as handy as was to be expected from the money-holding classes of this great commercial nation.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{factors that affect}} the growth of {{manufacturing}} firms in Germany. It addresses which factors might be needful and which factors might be helpful for the different growth stages of these firms. Most firms face turning points in their life course, and thus do not grow continuously. By using panel data on German manufacturing firms over the period 1992 - 2007, we analyse a sample of 278 enterprises. The criterion used for selecting the sample was that they belong to the category of manufacturing sector (NACE- 2 -digit industries), which are surveyed by the Centre for European Economic Research (ZEW). <b>It</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>discovered</b> that a set of firm specific factors such as export orientation, R&D activities, firm size and type of industry {{are more likely to}} affect the growth process of a firm. The results from regression analysis indicate that some indicators are related to the growth process of firms. So, it can be stated that some indicators might be needful or helpful for the growth of manufacturing firms...|$|E
40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis {{focuses on}} magical {{thinking in the}} age of adulthood. The primary aim is to discover and define the particular manifestations of the magical thinking in adulthood and compare them with magical thinking in childhood. A further aim is to find a link between magical thinking and religion, and between magical thinking and field of education of participants. Research methodologies include qualitive field research accompanied by semi- structured interviews. The finding of the research show that magical thinking is more often found in child thinking, but <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>discovered</b> in adulthood as well, there are no differences among principles and forms of magical thinking in childhood and adulthood. Magical thinking is more often found in atheists and there is no link between magical thinking and field of education of participants. The discussion concludes that magical thinking emerges in stressful situations and it is associated with anxiety and feelings of uncertainty. Magical thinking serve important functions - it is a coping strategy and it could reduce an anxiety...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to discover}} the concept of nationalism and education by Agus Salim. Agus Salim is an Indonesian nationalist who bring out the brilliant idea of nationalism. This research uses historical research by Kuntowijoyo. The stages of this research are finding topic, heuristic, source critics, interpreting, and historiography. It results that instruments used by Agus Salim are Neratja and Fadjar Asia. Articles written by Agus Salim was more critical to talk about colonial government regulation and Fadjar Asia was being a camp for Agus Salim. In Agus Salim’s opinion, {{he found out that}} mass media was abused since it became a disadvantage instrument. He fought for Indonesia to against colonial government. <b>It</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>discovered</b> from his statements in mass media. For instance, he wrote I prefer to burn this island out to give this island for Dutch! His deportment was different from the other nationalists like Abdul Rivai in Bintang Hindia and Wahidi Soedirohusodo in Retnodumilah who were more cooperative with Hindi-Dutch government. Nationalism for Agus Salim is fighting from the bottom. It means nationalism must be built from community which has one purpose to fight for community rights and to develop country as devotion.

40|$|Electroweak {{precision}} measurements {{indicate that}} the standard model Higgs boson is light and that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> have already <b>been</b> <b>discovered</b> at LEP 2, or might {{be found at the}} Tevatron Run 2. In the context of a TeV^- 1 size extra dimensional model, we argue that the Higgs boson production rates at LEP and the Tevatron are suppressed, while they might be enhanced at the LHC or at CLIC. This is due to the possible mixing between brane and bulk components of the Higgs boson, that is, the non-trivial brane-bulk `location' of the lightest Higgs. To parametrize this mixing, we consider two Higgs doublets, one confined to the usual space dimensions and the other propagating in the bulk. Calculating the production and decay rates for the lightest Higgs boson, we find that compared to the standard model (SM), the cross section receives a suppression well below but an enhancement close to and above the compactification scale M_c. This impacts the discovery of the lightest (SM like) Higgs boson at colliders. To find a Higgs signal in this model at the Tevatron Run 2 or at the LC with sqrt(s) = 1. 5 TeV, a higher luminosity would be required than in the SM case. Meanwhile, at the LHC or at CLIC with sqrt(s) ~ 3 - 5 TeV one might find highly enhanced production rates. This will enable the latter experiments to distinguish between the extra dimensional and the SM for M_c up to about 6 TeV. Comment: 15 pages, 3 figures.

40|$|On {{sitting down}} to write my {{contribution}} to this Colloquy, I found myself pulled in many directions, as Joan Williams’s new book is rich with fascinating and provocative ideas. From the incredibly valuable documentation of how rigid masculine norms harm men {{who want to do}} right by their families, to the highlighting of deep tensions between “femmey” and “tomboy” feminists, to the courageous exploration of cultural and political tensions driven by class performance, there is much in Reshaping the Work-Family Debate to discuss. One of the aspects of the book I deeply admire is Williams’s attempt to spur different groups to make nice—femmes and tomboys, working-class parents and upper-middle-class progressives. This is driven not by a Pollyannaish desire to see us all get along, but by an acknowledgement of political reality. Without collaboration among these currently divided groups, the progressive policies that Williams hopes will improve the lives and chances of many will never gain wide enough support. I’m admittedly skeptical about coming together with femmes or working-class parents, particularly {{in the context of the}} work-family debate, because I’m skeptical that we really share enough common ground to create policies all these groups can get behind. But there’s no way that common ground, if <b>it</b> exists, <b>could</b> ever <b>be</b> <b>discovered</b> without confronting and examining our differences, and Williams is doing just that. Thus, this book is the only thing I’ve read in the past five years that even begins to mitigate my skepticism. Unwillingness to confront these differences is a major barrier that Williams is bravely breaking down. With that in mind, in this Essay I hope to explore some of my hesitations, in the hopes of making finding common ground more likely...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{landmarks}} in {{the history}} of the physiology of reproduction is the discovery by Stockard and Papanicolaou 7 that the progress of the sexual cycle of mammals, conditioned by ovarian changes, is reflected in a spectacular rhythm of changes in the cell content of the vaginal lumen. Those changes <b>could,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>discovered,</b> readily <b>be</b> recognized by examination of a specimen from the vagina. The simplicity and reliability of the "vaginal smear" technic at once recommended itself as a most convenient tool for the determination of the stages (ovulation, for example) of the estrous cycle. The stimulus of this new method to research in reproductive phenomena is hard to over-estimate. In 1923 the vaginal smear method found an important application in the hands of Edgar Allen and E. A. Doisy 5 in their development of what is known today as the "Allen-Doisy test, " which consists of the vaginal response of the ovariectomized mouse to the injection of "estrogenic " hormones. The establishment of this method of assay led to the final discovery, in 1930, of the chemical constitution of estrone ("theelin " of Allen and Doisy). The writer of these lines is gratified to present herewith a small contribution in the field in which the man we wish to honor has pioneered. This laboratory's renewed interest in problems relating to the vaginal cycle may be said to be due to the cooperative study of Dr. Ines de Allende and the writer at the Carnegie Laboratory of Embryology, Baltimore, and of Dr. Ephraim Shorr at the New York Hospital. Dr. de Allende's task was to make a comparative study of the vaginal cyde of the monkey and of women. In the course of this study, a certain cell type (termed "Shorr " cell in the present paper) attracted our attention (type II of de Allende, Shorr, and Hartman 6). With the aid of students (especially R. C. Melick) the writer has, during the past two years, as occasion offered, investigated the occurrence of this and other cell types in numerous specie...|$|R
