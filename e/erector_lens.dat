50|$|Telescopic sights {{based on}} refracting telescopes using image erector lenses {{to present the}} user with an upright image have two planes of focus where a reticle can be placed: at the focal plane between the {{objective}} and the image <b>erector</b> <b>lens</b> system (the First Focal Plane (FFP)), or the focal plane between the image <b>erector</b> <b>lens</b> system and the eyepiece (the Second Focal Plane (SFP)). On fixed power telescopic sights {{there is no significant}} difference, but on variable power telescopic sights a first focal plane reticle expands and shrinks {{along with the rest of}} the image as the magnification is adjusted, while a second focal plane reticle would appear the same size and shape to the user as the target image grows and shrinks. In general, the majority of modern variable-power scopes are SFP unless stated otherwise. Every European high-end telescopic sight manufacturer offers FFP reticles on variable power telescopic sights, since the optical needs of European hunters who live in jurisdictions that allow hunting at dusk, night and dawn differ from hunters who traditionally or by legislation do not hunt in low light conditions.|$|E
