5|$|In June 1945 the Soviet {{authorities}} {{took over}} Auschwitz I and converted it to a POW camp for German prisoners. The <b>hospital</b> <b>had</b> {{to move beyond}} the camp perimeter into former administrative buildings, where it functioned until October 1945.|$|E
5|$|It {{was decided}} to hold the games in Perth because the city was to host the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games and Royal Perth <b>Hospital</b> <b>had</b> a well {{developed}} spinal unit that could support paraplegic athletes. The Commonwealth Paraplegic Games were held before the main Games as to not impact on this event and provide the opportunity for athletes to stay on for the main Games.|$|E
5|$|A <b>hospital</b> <b>had</b> {{originally}} been installed at Alcatraz during its {{time as a}} military prison in the late 19th century. During its time as a federal penitentiary, it was located above the dining hall on the second floor. Hospital staff were U.S. Public Health Service employees assigned to the Federal Prison Service at Alcatraz. Doctors often lasted fewer than several days or months at Alcatraz, because few of them could tolerate the violent inmates who would often terrify them if they failed to be given certain drugs. Prisoners in ill health were often kept in the hospital, most famously, Stroud and Al Capone, who spent years in it.|$|E

5|$|After {{a drunken}} and violent fight with Graham in 1938, Scott {{returned}} to Asheville. A group from Zelda's <b>hospital</b> <b>had</b> {{planned to go}} to Cuba, but Zelda had missed the trip. The Fitzgeralds decided to go on their own. The trip was a disaster even by their standards: Scott was beaten up {{when he tried to}} stop a cockfight and returned to the United States so intoxicated and exhausted that he was hospitalized. The Fitzgeralds never saw each other again.|$|E
5|$|By the 1940s it was {{recognized}} that this arrangement was unsatisfactory. The American Medical Association conducted {{a series of}} studies in 1948, followed by a Department of the Interior study in 1950. They highlighted the deficiencies of the program: commitment procedures in Alaska were archaic, and the long trip to Portland had a negative effect on patients and their families. In addition, an audit of the hospital contract found that the Sanatorium Company, which owned the <b>hospital,</b> <b>had</b> been padding its expenses. This had enabled it to make an excess profit of $69,000 per year (equivalent to over $588,000 per year at 2007 prices).|$|E
5|$|Filming in the Czech Republic's Barrandov Studios {{began in}} May. The crew took over {{sections}} of the Old Town in Prague. While filming in the city on April 26, people were injured when a bus and several cars collided with a four-wheel-drive vehicle that appeared to have braking problems. The emergency services confirmed those taken to <b>hospital</b> <b>had</b> minor injuries. Filming wrapped after a month in Prague. Additional second unit filming took place in Paris, Egypt, Tokyo, the Arctic, and underwater.|$|E

5|$|For a time, the Australian Voluntary Hospital was {{the only}} Australian {{presence}} on the Western Front, but in April 1916, Australian Army units began arriving from the Middle East in large numbers. The Australian Voluntary Hospital's site in Wimereux {{was taken over by}} No. 3 Australian General Hospital, AIF in June 1916. The Australian Voluntary Hospital was then absorbed into the British Army as No. 32 Stationary Hospital, with Eames remaining in command. By 1 May 1919, the <b>hospital</b> <b>had</b> treated 73,868 patients.|$|E
5|$|The {{health system}} has {{more or less}} collapsed. At the end of November 2008, some {{operations}} at three of Zimbabwe's four major referral hospitals had shut down, along with the Zimbabwe Medical School, and the fourth major <b>hospital</b> <b>had</b> two wards and no operating theatres working. Due to hyperinflation, those hospitals still open {{were not able to}} obtain basic drugs and medicines. The situation changed drastically after the Unity Government and the introduction of the multi-currency system in February 2009 although the political and economic crisis also contributed to the emigration of the doctors and people with medical knowledge.|$|E
5|$|The {{hospital}} in Kirkuk received {{large numbers of}} patients with symptoms that doctors recognised from the 1960 outbreak. The first case of alkylmercury poisoning was admitted to hospital on 21 December. By 26 December, the <b>hospital</b> <b>had</b> issued a specific warning to the government. By January 1972, the government had started to strongly warn the populace about eating the grain, although dispatches {{did not mention the}} large numbers already ill. The Iraqi Army soon ordered disposal of the grain and eventually declared the death penalty for anyone found selling it. Farmers dumped their supplies wherever possible, and it soon got into the water supply (particularly the River Tigris), causing further problems. The government issued a news blackout and released little information about the outbreak.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{requirements}} of the Foundling Hospital was that babies were to be less than six months old at the time of admittance, but the hospital did not keep more accurate records of age. Another requirement was that foundlings were given a new name and a reference number, so Sabrina became Girl Ann Kingston no. 4759. She was taken in by a wet nurse, Mary Penfold, who brought her to Wotton, Surrey, where she remained until 1759, when she was two years old. Although it was usual for foundlings to remain with their wet nurse until the age of five or six, the Foundling <b>Hospital</b> <b>had</b> received an influx of new babies and moved many children who no longer required nursing, including Sabrina, to the Shrewsbury branch of the Foundling Hospital. The Shrewsbury building was not completed until 1765, so in the meantime Sabrina and another foundling were cared for by a nurse, Ann Casewell, at her home.|$|E
5|$|Only a {{week after}} Typhoon Chataan struck Guam and left $60million in damage, Typhoon Halong also {{threatened}} the island, although it veered to {{the south in the}} day before it would have struck. Due to the storm, all flights were canceled in Guam and the Northern Marianas Islands, and officials advised residents in low-lying areas to evacuate. While passing to the south, Halong produced waves as high as 6m (20ft) in Inarajan. The waves left beach erosion along Guam's southern coast, and were higher than during Chataan's passage. The typhoon produced peak sustained winds of 69km/h (43mph), with gusts to 90km/h (56mph); both observations were recorded at Guam's National Weather Service. Damage on the island was estimated at $40,000. The storm disrupted work to repair damage from Chataan. Portions of the island, including Guam Memorial <b>Hospital,</b> <b>had</b> their power restored after Chataan, only to lose electricity during Halong. The additional damage caused by Halong contributed to Governor Carl T.C. Gutierrez declaring the island as a state of emergency on July22, which activated the Guam National Guard.|$|E
5|$|The Imperial War Museum {{originated}} {{during the}} First World War in 1917 as the National War Museum committee, {{formed by the}} British government to record the war effort and sacrifice of Britain and her Empire. The museum opened in 1920, by which point it had been renamed the Imperial War Museum. With {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War, the museum's terms of reference were enlarged to include the conflict. The museum's terms of reference was broadened again in 1953 to include all modern conflicts in which British or Commonwealth forces were engaged. The effect of these expansions of remit was to cause the museum's collections to expand enormously, to the point that many parts of the collection, especially those of aircraft, vehicles and artillery, could not be effectively stored or exhibited. Although the museum's south London home (a nineteenth-century building in Southwark which was previously the Bethlem Royal <b>Hospital)</b> <b>had</b> been extended in 1966, {{by the end of the}} decade the museum was seeking additional space.|$|E

5|$|They {{were not}} the first Australians {{to serve on the}} Western Front. An Australian Voluntary <b>Hospital</b> <b>had</b> been formed in England in August 1914 from Australian expatriates. All medical {{practitioners}} in the unit were Australians and although women were not allowed to serve as doctors, Australian nurses were accepted. The unit left for France in August 1914 and from October was based at Wimereux, where the 2nd General Hospital joined it in June 1916. In July 1916, the Australian Voluntary Hospital was absorbed into the British Army. Another group of Australians had also arrived in France before I Anzac Corps. In June 1915, the 1st Siege Artillery Brigade was formed under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Walter Adams Coxen, the Australian Army's Director of Artillery, for service on the Western Front. About half the men in the unit were permanent gunners of the Garrison Artillery. The brigade departed Melbourne for England on 17 July 1915 and landed in France on 27 February 1916. Its 54th Siege Battery was equipped with 8 inch howitzers and its 55th Siege Battery with 9.2 inch howitzers.|$|E
