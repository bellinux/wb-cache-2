40|$|Labyrinth {{air seal}} static and dynamic {{performance}} was evaluated using solid, abradable, and honeycomb lands with standard and advanced seal designs. The effects on leakage of land surface roughness, abradable land porosity, rub grooves in abradable lands, and honeycomb land cell size and depth were studied using a standard labyrinth seal. The effects of rotation on the optimum seal <b>knife</b> <b>pitch</b> were also investigated. Selected geometric and aerodynamic parameters for an advanced seal design were evaluated to derive an optimized performance configuration. The rotational energy requirements were also measured {{to determine the}} inherent friction and pumping energy absorbed by the various seal knife and land configurations tested in order to properly assess the net seal system performance level. Results indicate that: (1) seal leakage can be significantly affected with honeycomb or abradable lands; (2) rotational energy absorption does not vary significantly {{with the use of}} a solid-smooth, an abradable, or a honeycomb land; and (3) optimization of an advanced lab seal design produced a configuration that had leakage 25 % below a conventional stepped seal...|$|E
50|$|Drop {{point is}} a style of knife blade that slopes on {{the spine of the}} blade from the handle of the knife to the tip of the blade. This allows the spine of the blade (where the blade is thicker, and thus stronger) to {{continue}} forward to the tip of the blade. This way the {{point is a}}lso aligned with the center axis of the <b>knife,</b> eliminating any <b>pitch</b> momentum when stabbing.|$|R
