50|$|This {{sword is}} almost {{identical}} to Niabor, but with a hilt resembling that of Mandau. The blade has a convex edge and concave back. On both sides a broad rib runs from the <b>finger</b> <b>guard</b> to the tip. The <b>finger</b> <b>guard</b> is smaller than of the Niabor and is further removed from the hilt. Unlike the <b>finger</b> <b>guard</b> of the Niabor, the Langgai Tinggang has a <b>finger</b> <b>guard</b> that is similar of the Mandau's. Another feature that separates the Langgai Tinggang from Niabor is the pommel of the Langgai Tinggang is always decorated with animal hair.|$|E
50|$|It has a convex {{edge and}} concave back {{broadening}} towards the tip so that {{so that the}} center of gravity lies at the point. The edge curves in a faint curve towards the tip. The blade usually has one or more broken hollow sections and no midrib. They are usually not decorated. In some versions, a nose-shaped projection is forged to the blade, which is seated on the cutting edge. This projection serves as a kind of parry and <b>finger</b> <b>guard</b> is called Kundieng. It is typical of these swords. Below the <b>finger</b> <b>guard</b> of the blade is rectangular. This place is called Sangau. Between the <b>finger</b> <b>guard</b> and the hilt is called Temporian. The hilt is made of antler or deer horn, just like the Mandau. The pommel is carved in the traditional way and never decorated with animal hair.|$|E

50|$|A thimble {{is a small}} hard pitted cup worn for {{protection}} on the finger that pushes the needle in sewing. Usually, thimbles with a closed top are used by dressmakers but special thimbles with an opening at the end are used by tailors as this allows them to manipulate the cloth more easily. <b>Finger</b> <b>guards</b> differ from tailors' thimbles in that they often have a top but are open on one side. Some <b>finger</b> <b>guards</b> {{are little more than}} a finger shield attached to a ring to maintain the guard in place. The Old English word þȳmel, the ancestor of thimble, is derived from Old English þūma, the ancestor of our word thumb.|$|R
25|$|The {{purpose of}} door guards (also known as hinge guards, anti-finger {{trapping}} devices, or <b>finger</b> <b>guards)</b> {{is to reduce}} the number of finger trapping accidents in doors, as doors pose a risk to children especially when closing. Door <b>guards</b> protect <b>fingers</b> in door hinges by covering the gap that is created by opening doors by covering the hinges of doors with a piece of rubber or plastic that wraps from the door frame to the door. There are also door safety products which eject the fingers from the push side of the door as it is being closed.|$|R
5000|$|Orbit {{fans are}} fans that use a {{mechanism}} to oscillate at 360 degrees. They are also typically flushed to the ceiling like hugger type fans. They are also very small in size, usually about 16" [...] and have a similar construction to that of many pedestal fans and desk fans, and usually have <b>finger</b> <b>guards.</b> These are once again, popular mostly {{in many developing countries}} as they are a cheap alternative to traditional paddle type ceiling fans. Many American manufacturers, such as [...] "Fanimation" [...] have started producing high quality designer versions of such fans for their retro design, however, unlike the orbit huggers discussed earlier, these usually include downrods, like many early versions of the orbit fan.|$|R
5000|$|Technique {{for the use}} of a chef's knife is an {{individual}} preference. For more precise control, most cooks prefer to grip the blade itself, with the thumb and the index finger grasping the blade just {{to the front of the}} <b>finger</b> <b>guard</b> and the middle finger placed just opposite, on the handle side of the <b>finger</b> <b>guard</b> below the bolster. This is commonly referred to as a [...] "pinch grip". Those without culinary training often grip the handle, with all four fingers and the thumb gathered underneath.|$|E
50|$|Most paper cutters come {{equipped}} with a <b>finger</b> <b>guard</b> to prevent users from accidentally cutting themselves or severing a digit while using the apparatus. However, injuries are still possible if the device is not used with proper care or attention.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are many}} {{regional}} variants of karambit. The {{length of the}} blade, for example, could vary from one village or blacksmith to another. Some have no <b>finger</b> <b>guard</b> and some feature two blades, {{one on each side}} of the handle. Traditional types include: ...|$|E
50|$|In the UK, {{guidelines}} {{established by}} the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) provide recommendations for the construction and use of test lamps. Probes must be well-insulated, with minimal exposure of live terminals, with <b>finger</b> <b>guards</b> to prevent accidental contact, and must not expose live wires if the test lamp glass bulb is broken. To limit the energy delivered {{in case of a}} short-circuit, test lights must have a current-limiting fuse or current-limiting resistor and fuse. The HSE guidelines also recommend procedures to validate operation of the test light. When a known live circuit is not available, a separate proving unit that provides a known test voltage and sufficient power to illuminate the lamp is used to confirm operation of the lamp before and after testing a circuit.|$|R
50|$|A single steel needle {{from the}} time of the Han Dynasty ancient China (206BC - 202AD) was found in a tomb in Jiangling, and it could conceivably be assumed that {{thimbles}} were in use at this time also although no thimble seems to have been discovered with the needle. The earliest known thimble — in the form of a simple ring — dates back to the Han Dynasty ancient China also and was discovered during the Cultural Revolution of the People's Republic of China (PRC) in a lesser dignitary's tomb. Oddly, neither the Romans nor the Greeks before them appear to have used metal thimbles. It may be that leather or cloth <b>finger</b> <b>guards</b> proved sufficiently robust for their purposes. There are so-called Roman thimbles in museum collections, but the provenance of these metal thimbles is, in fact, not certain, and many have been removed from display. No well-documented archeological data link metal thimbles to any Roman site.|$|R
50|$|SPC 2022: A {{more compact}} {{version of the}} SP 2022 that is only {{available}} in 9×19mm. The SPC 2022 has a slightly shorter barrel and slide, as well as flat magazine base plates which make its grip shorter by 7 mm. It {{is equipped with a}} Picatinny rail and a <b>finger</b> groove trigger <b>guard.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The handgun {{takes the}} form of only a gun handle when not activated, but {{projects}} a barrel, <b>finger</b> <b>guard</b> and a holographic function display when activated. It has several different kinds of selectable ammunition (e.g., normal bullets, explosive bullets, various tracking beacons or darts). It appears that the gun never needs reloading so the ammunition is probably somehow generated or manufactured by the gun itself and it also has user identification so that it will emit a lethal charge to the user if he/she is unauthorized.|$|E
50|$|The blade {{broadens}} {{from the}} hilt to the point, {{which is usually}} quite blunt. While both edges are sharp, one side usually has a strengthening plate along most of its length, which both adds weight to downward cuts and allows the wielder to place their hand on the plated edge. The hilt has a large plate guard and a wide <b>finger</b> <b>guard</b> connected to the pommel. The pommel is round and flat with a spike projecting from its centre. The spike may be used offensively or as a grip when delivering a two-handed stroke.|$|E
50|$|Unlike other {{traditional}} combat weapon's, the Sewar's handle lacks a <b>finger</b> <b>guard.</b> Usually a ferrule made of brass is mounted {{at the base}} of the handle to better secure the handle and the blade. For ceremonial versions, a ferrule clamp is extremely ornate (Tampo). Its design can be rectangular, hexagonal, octagonal, or triangular (Glupa). Traditionally the handle is made of wood and often decorated with carvings or metal ornaments. Various versions of the handle are crafted differently, in styles such as the Hulu Boh Glimo or the Akar Bahar.|$|E
50|$|By 1928, Luigi D'Andrea was the Henry Ford of guitar picks, with semi-automated {{equipment}} to punch, tumble and imprint {{as many as}} 59 differently shaped picks in both celluloid and real tortoise shell. His New York City factory produced flat picks, thumb and <b>finger</b> picks, pick <b>guards,</b> as well as guitar, bass, sax, accordion & drum bags, and cases.|$|R
50|$|Eventually, Princess Susti makes a speech, {{stating that}} the {{brothers}} must prove their devotion to her by obtaining four priceless items, namely, the Idol of Needs on Kazbrack, an island off {{the east coast of}} Illmoor inhabited by fire demons, Ezra's Opal, which belongs to Lady Khan, wife of Mad Count Craven, the zombie ruler of Wemeru the undead city in the voodoo jungles of Rintintetly, Pagoda's Box, a treasure chest in the Finion <b>Finger</b> Mountains <b>guarded</b> day and night by harpies, and the jewelled eyes of Torche, a giant dragon in the Fastrush Pass. These legendary items are, in fact, non-existent, made up by Modeset. However, the dangers that each of the four places possess are all too real.|$|R
5000|$|While Dennehy was on remand {{before the}} trial prison staff found an escape plot in her diary. This {{involved}} killing or seriously injuring a prison guard, cutting {{off one of the}} <b>guard's</b> <b>fingers</b> and using the amputated finger to fool the biometric system in the prison. Dennehy was placed in solitary confinement from September 2013 (before the court proceedings) to September 2015 (after the proceedings) because of the above plot. She claims isolation left her 'tearful and upset' and led to self harm.|$|R
50|$|The karambit is {{held with}} the blade {{pointing}} downward {{from the bottom}} of the fist, usually curving forwards however occasionally backwards. While it is primarily used in a slashing or hooking motion, karambit with a finger ring are also used in a punching motion hitting the opponent with the finger ring. Some karambit are designed to be used in a hammering motion. This flexibility of striking methods is what makes it so useful in self-defense situations. The <b>finger</b> <b>guard</b> makes it difficult to disarm and allows the knife to be maneuvered in the fingers without losing one's grip.|$|E
6000|$|... 'He {{said not}} a word. He just crooked his long white <b>finger</b> to the <b>guard</b> {{at the door}} while the {{carriage}} steps were let down, and I skipped into the house, and they slammed {{the door in the}} crowd's face. '"You go there," [...] says a soldier, and shoves me into an empty room, where I catched my first breath since I'd left the barge. Presently I heard plates rattling next door--there were only folding doors between--and a cork drawn. [...] "I tell you," [...] some one shouts with his mouth full, [...] "it was all that sulky ass Sieyes' fault. Only my speech to the Five Hundred saved the situation." ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- We {{present the}} {{analysis}} and measurement of spurious responses generated {{at the ends of}} interdigital transducers (IDT). Filters fabricated on LiNb 03 show an un-wanted pass band ripple whose period indicates additional generation of acoustic waves at the IDT end. As this ef-fect cannot be explained by methods of analysis based on the infinite array approximation, an exact analysis of the complex-valued, frequency-dependent electric charge distri-bution on the finite IDT structure is required. Utilizing the method of moments our analysis is based on a Green's function concept and a spectral domain representa-tion. Three effects are shown: The first is the charge accumulation on grounded <b>guard</b> <b>fingers</b> located closely to the IDT end, resulting in unwanted end radiation. The second is acoustic end reflections in split-finger IDT's, occurring at the transi-tion from the periodic finger structure to the free substrate. The third is the finger charge induced by the metallic ground plane when the transducer is driven unbalanced to ground. Computer simulations based on our method agree well with measurements. I...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{a globalized}} world, {{terrorism}} {{will be the}} issue of forthcoming decades. Yet, the obvious idea of fighting terrorism by stepping on public security measures might lead astray. In the first instance, an integrative approach of psychological, sociological and anthropological concepts is {{necessary in order to}} meet the dimensions of the global terrorism phenomenon. Especially the spirit of terrorism, as it were, the dynamics in terrorism, is rendered hard to come to terms with. Therefore, this paper will enunciate theses that not only take a look on global terrorism but suggest options of guidelines to deal with it. In psychological rationale, violence prevention is a means to be applied as early as in infant and early childhood education. By way of socio-emotional learning, i. e. learning from constant relational objects, children will internalize objects, identify with objects, and form social competencies. Violence prevention programs may support these processes. Underneath child rearing practices, from a sociological and anthropological perspective there are hidden motifs in groups and nations as well as there is societal structure itself. Structure, as grid of objective reality, may act as an agent of hidden repression and with that, of shrouded violence. So any increase of technical security might go along with an increase, not a decrease, of violence, like in anti-burglary fingerprint identification in some sentient building that will not necessarily lead to a decrease of burglaries on the premises but rather to a higher occurrence of brutality, e. g. in burglars cutting off the security <b>guard’s</b> <b>finger...</b>|$|R
