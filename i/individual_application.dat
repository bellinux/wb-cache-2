Browne made a habit of riding to training with his ordinary bike with heavy wheels to the club, carrying the lighter racing tyres on his back and changing his tyres upon his arrival. He earned extra money to fund a bicycle upgrade by working as a newspaper boy. There was little formal coaching at the club, and the cyclists learned by <b>individual</b> <b>application</b> and by watching and copying others. Browne and his club-mates raced on Saturdays and trained on Sundays.|$|E

On June 1, Adobe launched Acrobat.com, a series of web applications geared for collaborative work. Creative Suite 4, which includes Design, Web, Production Premium and Master Collection came out in October 2008 in six configurations at prices from about USD $1,700 to $2,500 or by <b>individual</b> <b>application.</b> The Windows version of Photoshop includes 64-bit processing.

40|$|This paper {{identifies}} application-aware adaptation as {{an essential}} capability of mobile clients, and {{provides an overview of}} Odyssey, an architecture that supports this capability. Functionality that has hitherto been implemented monolithically must now be split between the operating system and <b>individual</b> <b>applications.</b> The role of the operating system is to sense external events, and to monitor and allocate scarce resources. In contrast, the role of <b>individual</b> <b>applications</b> is to adapt to changing conditions by using the information and resources provided by the operating system. 1. Introduction In this position paper we put forth the view that access to shared data in mobile computing systems is best achieved by a collaborative partnership between the operating system and <b>individual</b> <b>applications.</b> This strategy characterizes the design space between two extremes. At one extreme, the system provides total transparency: applications are completely unaware of mobility. At the other [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Today, {{with the}} {{increasing}} popularity of multicore processors, one approach to optimizing the processor’s performance {{is to reduce the}} execution times of <b>individual</b> <b>applications</b> running on each core by designing and implementing more powerful cores. Another approach, which is the polar opposite of the first, optimizes the processor’s performance by running a larger number of applications (or threads of a single application) on a correspondingly larger number of cores, albeit simpler ones. The difference between these two approaches is that the former focuses on reducing the latency of <b>individual</b> <b>applications</b> or thread...|$|R
6000|$|Obviously, {{this is the}} rudest of classifications, and no Utopian {{has ever}} {{supposed}} {{it to be a}} classification for <b>individual</b> <b>application,</b> a classification so precise that one can say, this man is [...] "poietic," [...] and that man is [...] "base." [...] In actual experience these qualities mingle and vary in every possible way. It is not a classification for Truth, but a classification to an end. Taking humanity as a multitude of unique individuals in mass, one may, for practical purposes, deal with it far more conveniently by disregarding its uniquenesses and its mixed cases altogether, and supposing it to be an assembly of poietic, kinetic, dull, and base people. In many respects it behaves as if it were that. The State, dealing as it does only with non-individualised affairs, is not only justified in disregarding, but is bound to disregard, a man's special distinction, and to provide for him on the strength of his prevalent aspect as being on the whole poietic, kinetic, or what not. In a world of hasty judgments and carping criticism, it cannot be repeated too often that the fundamental ideas of a modern Utopia imply everywhere and in everything, margins and elasticities, a certain universal compensatory looseness of play.|$|E
60|$|These {{few words}} passed amid the bustle and murmur of the evening, while the guests were assembling, {{and all were}} {{awaiting}} the marriage with that interest which the event continually brings with it, common as it is, so that nothing but death is commoner. Everybody congratulated the modest Rose, who looked quiet and happy; and so she stood up at the proper time, and the minister married them with a certain fervor and <b>individual</b> <b>application,</b> that made them feel they were married indeed. Then there ensued a salutation of the bride, the first to kiss her being the minister, and then some respectable old justices and farmers, each with his friendly smile and joke. Then went round the cake and wine, and other good cheer, and the hereditary jokes with which brides used to be assailed in those days. I think, too, there was a dance, though how the couples in the reel found space to foot it in the little room, I cannot imagine; at any rate, there was a bright light out of the windows, gleaming across the road, and such a sound of the babble of numerous voices and merriment, that travellers passing by, on the lonely Lexington road, wished they were of the party; {{and one or two}} of them stopped and went in, and saw the new-made bride, drank to her health, and took a piece of the wedding-cake home to dream upon.|$|E
