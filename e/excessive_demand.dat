5|$|Water {{was taken}} at first {{from the town}} well {{opposite}} St Giles Church, but the <b>excessive</b> <b>demand</b> diminished the supply and spoiled its quality. The tunnellers' water was then pumped from a site near the Dyneley Arms crossroads. At {{the same time the}} tunnel was draining away the local farmers' natural water supply and the source of Bramhope town well. Litigation on this subject continued for some years. To mitigate the situation, a public waterworks scheme with a reservoir and an aqueduct was proposed but not implemented.|$|E
25|$|There was one unusual {{occurrence}} of a station having to close because of <b>excessive</b> <b>demand.</b> The tiny halt at Eden between Carrickfergus and Kilroot had platforms that were barely one coach long yet about one hundred passengers were forcing themselves {{on to it}} at the morning peak. There was a danger that some would be swept off by non-stop trains and the halt was closed. Later, Eden was reopened for some off peak services.|$|E

At the time, some competitors expressed fears for their safety in the new location, but Belfast authorities were keen to ensure the event's success to improve the city's reputation as a tourist destination. The 2001 Championships, planned {{to be held in}} Ennis, were cancelled due to the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in Great Britain, from where nearly 35% of that year's competitors were expected to travel. The first Worlds to be cancelled caused <b>excessive</b> <b>demand</b> for the North American National Championships, traditionally held at the end of July. Furthermore, as a result of qualifiers for the 2001 event being allowed to carry over their qualification status to 2002, the next year in Glasgow saw a one-third increase on the usual number of competitors.|$|E

40|$|An {{algorithm}} {{for integrating}} instruction scheduling and register allocation must support mechanisms for detecting excessive register and functional unit demands and applying reductions for lessening these <b>demands.</b> The <b>excessive</b> <b>demands</b> for functional units {{can be detected}} by identifying the instructions that can execute in parallel, and can be reduced by scheduling some of these instructions sequentially. The <b>excessive</b> <b>demands</b> for registers can be detected on-the-fly while scheduling by maintaining register pressure values or may be detected prior to scheduling using an appropriate representation such as parallel interference graphs or register reuse dags. Reductions in <b>excessive</b> register <b>demands</b> {{can be achieved by}} live range spilling or live range splitting.

500|$|Tickets for European shows {{first went}} on sale in mid-March, with high demand. Shows in Gothenburg, Amsterdam and Milan sold out {{reasonably}} fast, with second dates being added in each city; those also sold out quickly. In The Netherlands, demand rendered all of KPN's 0900 paid service numbers unreachable. The nearly 90,000 tickets for the opening concert in Barcelona were sold in 54 minutes, establishing a new record for concerts in Spain. The tour set a record by selling 650,000 tickets in seven hours. Regarding the quick sellout of two Croke Park shows in Dublin, Bono said: [...] "It's overwhelming, really. It's {{a very big deal}} for us to sell-out our hometown at such speed, it's unbelievable. ... We don't take anything for granted." [...] Fans from all around the world travelled to Ireland for the band's hometown shows, leading the Gaelic Athletic Association to close their museum in Croke Park {{for the duration of the}} events due to fears over security and <b>excessive</b> <b>demand.</b> The Croke Park shows later won Top Boxscore at the 2009 Billboard Touring Awards.|$|E
2500|$|The {{construction}} work {{then went on}} rapidly, until the resources of concrete and bricks began to be depleted due to the <b>excessive</b> <b>demand</b> placed on them so suddenly. Also, {{the performance of the}} early street shelters was a serious blow to public confidence. Their walls were shaken down either by earth shock or blast, and the concrete roofs then fell onto the helpless occupants, and this was there for all to see. [...] At around the same time rumours of accidents started to circulate, such as on one occasion people being drowned due to a burst main filling up the shelter with water. Although much improved designs were being introduced whose performance had been demonstrated in explosion trials, communal shelters became highly unpopular, and shortly afterwards householders were being encouraged to build or have built private shelters on their properties, or within their houses, with materials being supplied by the government.|$|E
60|$|These {{last years}} were indeed years of an <b>excessive</b> <b>demand</b> upon his vitality; {{he was not}} only worn out with sorrow, he was worn out by hope. The {{singular}} invention to which he gave the name of telpherage, had of late consumed his time, overtaxed his strength and overheated his imagination. The words in which he first mentioned his discovery to me - 'I am simply Alnaschar' - were not only descriptive of his state of mind, they were in a sense prophetic; since whatever fortune may await his idea in the future, it was not his to see it bring forth fruit. Alnaschar he was indeed; beholding about him a world all changed, a world filled with telpherage wires; and seeing not only himself and family but all his friends enriched. It was his pleasure, when the company was floated, to endow those whom he liked with stock; one, at least, never knew that he was a possible rich man until the grave had closed over his stealthy benefactor. And however Fleeming chafed among material and business difficulties, this rainbow vision never faded; and he, like his father and his mother, may be said to have died upon a pleasure. But the strain told, and he knew that it was telling. 'I am becoming a fossil,' he had written five years before, as a kind of plea for a holiday visit to his beloved Italy. 'Take care! If I am Mr. Fossil, you will be Mrs. Fossil, and Jack will be Jack Fossil, and all the boys will be little fossils, and then we shall be a collection.' There was no fear more chimerical for Fleeming; years brought him no repose; he was as packed with energy, as fiery in hope, as at the first; weariness, to which he began to be no stranger, distressed, it did not quiet him. He feared for himself, not without ground, the fate which had overtaken his mother; others shared the fear. In the changed life now made for his family, the elders dead, the sons going from home upon their education, even their tried domestic (Mrs. Alice Dunns) leaving the house after twenty-two years of service, it was not unnatural that he should return to dreams of Italy. He and his wife were to go (as he told me) on 'a real honeymoon tour.' He had not been alone with his wife 'to speak of,' he added, since the birth of his children. But now he was to enjoy the society of her to whom he wrote, in these last days, that she was his 'Heaven on earth.' Now he was to revisit Italy, and see all the pictures and the buildings and the scenes that he admired so warmly, and lay aside for a time the irritations of his strenuous activity. Nor was this all. A trifling operation was to restore his former lightness of foot; and it was a renovated youth that was to set forth upon this reÃ«nacted honeymoon.|$|E
