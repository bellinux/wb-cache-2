Past research in China has appropriately discuss the present situation and variation tendency of household investment, but few research has exploited its influencing factors with systematic econometric models. Using cross-section data from nationwide survey in China, this paper employs Tobit regression for censored data of household investments, and particularly add to the model the human capital measured as educational investments which has been ignored by people.

For that, an organizing framework based on Balanced Scorecard concepts is first presented to tie those functions to strategic business processes; and then, the impact of service levels on business performance is estimated using quantitative techniques from management science. The result is a quantitative approach for SLA objective setting and investment allocation to improve business results. The approach serves as decision support for investment policies within an ITIL Financial Management for IT Services context. Application {{to the case of}} a drugstore chain showed that the approach is instrumental in analyzing complex IT servicebusiness process interdependency scenarios.

This causes burden on the nation like increase in generation capacity or energy import. Energy policies and regulations are framed by various nations. Majority of energy is consumed by industrial sector. An effort in energy conservation by improving the energy efficiency in industries {{in the light of}} these policies and strategies formed for industries to improve the energy efficiency can be effective. In this paper, the energy policies of some nations including India are discussed. Energy saving strategies for industries are proposed. Energy efficiency can be improved by these strategies.

These measures culminated in a new Asset Purchase Program under the Comprehensive Monetary Easing (CME) which differs from typical quantitative easing in other central banks by including purchases of risky asset {{in an effort to}} reduce term and risk premia. This note assesses the impact of monetary easing measures on financial markets using an event study approach.

40|$|It {{has been}} said that "home bias" exists among investors due to informational {{disadvantage}} involved in cross-border investment. But, real estate has become a major asset class and cross-border real estate investment has been surging. Behind this phenomenon is heightened awareness among investors of the modem portfolio theory and the benefits of diversification. Japan is not an exception. Since late 1990 's, a large amount of capital has flowed into Japanese real estate markets. The markets have also experienced significant transformation. However, in the eyes of foreign investors they are far from transparent due to, among other things, lack of reliable <b>investment</b> <b>indices</b> of commercial real estate. Such indices cannot be generated overnight, and lack of such indices can be a critical issue for global real estate investors. This issue is contributing to under-investment in Japan's real estate from overseas. Facing this problem, researchers and industry practitioners launched a number of <b>investment</b> <b>indices</b> for private real estate in recent years, each of which has strong and weak points. Compared to other indices, the ARES J-REIT Property Index seems potentially the most reliable and promising index for Japanese commercial real estate. (cont.) The purposes {{of this paper is to}} analyze and compare various <b>investment</b> <b>indices</b> for Japanese private real estate; to understand distortions i. e. the "lagging" and "smoothing" effects involved in appraisal-based <b>investment</b> <b>indices</b> to see the "true" pictures of private real estate returns; and then to apply such indices to an international portfolio analysis to see the relative position of Japan's private real estate as a global asset class.

The monumental Cimon terrace under the Parthenon on the Athenian Acropolis is a case study, and its relationship with its surrounding monuments and with terraces at Delphi and Persepolis is explored. The terraces are compared based on their implied <b>investment</b> <b>index</b> values, a calculated ratio of the maximum volume of stone to the area of the horizontal space.

40|$|Family firm {{researchers}} have found a host of characteristics that are unique to family firms. These familial attributes are often taken as plausible explanations for governance and operational differences between family firms and their non-family competitors. We use these familial characteristics {{as well as a}} host of ‘non-family’ specific provisions to build an <b>Investment</b> Reputation <b>Index</b> that measures the reputation of a family firm as an investment opportunity. The results of an empirical study of 199 ‘quoted’ family firms supported the hypothesis that the investment reputation of a family firm has a positive impact on its performance. However, a similar empirical analysis using a measure of the <b>Investment</b> Reputation <b>Index</b> without the familial attributes, showed a stronger impact on performance, signifying a negative association with recognizing the familial characteristics of the firm. An empirical analysis on a matched sample of 304 family- and non-family firms revealed that the investment reputation of a family firm can only be brought into comparable terms with the reputation of a non-family firm if the familial attributes are included in the analysis. Understanding ‘How family is the family firm?’ is important from an investor’s point of view as it highlights the good practices of some family firms. An investor instead of grouping all family firms into one category can now differentiate between ‘good’ and ‘bad’ family firms {{with the help of the}} <b>Investment</b> Reputation <b>Index.</b> Corporate Governace, Family business, reputation <b>investment</b> <b>index...</b>|$|R

The driving characteristics of the tool developed are transparency, reproducibility, specificity and clarity. Currently, the approach to selecting countries in which to invest is driven purely by ad hoc frameworks that often lack the characteristics driving this <b>investment</b> <b>index</b> tool. The <b>investment</b> <b>index</b> was designed to have three main components: market conditions, economic environment and supporting infrastructure. Market conditions for the product of interest – in this case flour – were defined to encompass per capita wheat-based food consumption growth rate, wheat production versus wheat consumption and wheat flour imports growth rate. The economic environment was defined to incorporate the growth rate of per capita gross domestic product, corporate tax rate, labor productivity, foreign direct investment growth rates, position on the World Bank’s Doing Business 2012 rankings, and the number and extent of the country’s membership in regional economic and trade groups. Supporting infrastructure included electricity reliability, transportation quality, urbanization rate and the physical presence of the investing company in the country. The rationale for this last variable is that when the investing company already has a presence in the country under consideration, it has already incurred some of the hurdle costs that it would have to include in investments in a location where it does have current physical activities. The study started by filtering the scope of potential opportunities by a set of well-defined criteria: target geographical locations; Doing Business 2012 scores; and quantity of wheat flour imports in 2009. This led to four countries emerging as leading candidates for investment considerations: Brazil, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand. The <b>investment</b> <b>index</b> ranked these countries according to their relative suitability for investment. The three components of the index carry different weights because of their effect on the potential investment outcome. There is no data to support these weighting and therefore executives must utilize different probing approaches to weight the components. To this end, a base scenario and two other scenarios based on alternative weights were considered. The robustness of the ranking is revealed by the consistency of the rankings under the alternative weights applied to the components. The results showed that under the base scenario Malaysia had the highest <b>investment</b> <b>index</b> score. The results also showed that varying the alternative weights for the scenarios did not affect the overall outcome with Malaysia leading with the highest overall index score {{for each of the three}} scenarios...|$|R
