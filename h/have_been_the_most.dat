5|$|Burnell was a {{dominant}} figure {{during the first}} part of Edward's reign, and he controlled most aspects of royal administration. He was involved not only in domestic issues but also in foreign relations, a responsibility he retained for two decades after Edward's return to England in 1274. Huscroft argues that he may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> important royal administrator of the 13th century.|$|E

5|$|Once the British {{were aware}} of the leak, they were {{concerned}} that Cicero had leaked information that might help crack the British cipher, but that did not occur. Lastly, the intelligence might have made the Germans believe that there was no danger of attack in the Balkans, which may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> potentially damaging information gleaned by Cicero for the Germans.|$|E

5|$|The Great Gatsby (1926), by Herbert Brenon– {{a silent}} movie of a stage adaptation, {{starring}} Warner Baxter, Lois Wilson, and William Powell. It is a famous {{example of a}} lost film. Reviews suggest that it may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> faithful adaptation of the novel, but a trailer of the film at the National Archives {{is all that is}} known to exist.|$|E
5|$|Although other retired {{high-ranking}} officers, including generals James Gavin and Matthew Ridgway, joined Shoup in this, it was Shoup's pointed criticisms {{that regularly}} made {{the front pages}} of newspapers, because they went beyond the war to American government, business, and military leadership. He feared the conflict had endangered the nation's historical identity, and argued increasing the troop levels in Vietnam would only aggravate the strategic problems there. Historian Robert Buzzanco noted that Shoup may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> vocal former military member to oppose the war.|$|E
5|$|American {{swimmers}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> {{successful in}} winning awards, with 52 titles, {{more than three}} times that of Australia (13). Michael Phelps of the United States has won the global award eight times, followed by Katie Ledecky of the United States and Ian Thorpe of Australia with four. Regionally, German, Hungarian and Dutch swimmers have had the most success in Europe, while Australians have won more than three-quarters of the Pacific awards.|$|E

5|$|Among the adapiforms, frugivory {{seems to}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> common diet, {{particularly}} for medium-sized to large species, such as Cantius, Pelycodus and Cercamonius. Folivory was also common among the medium and large-sized adapiforms, including Smilodectes, Notharctus, Adapis and Leptadapis. Sharp cusps on {{the teeth of}} some of the smaller adapiforms, such as Anchomomys and Donrussellia, indicate that they were either partly or primarily insectivorous.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{economic}} background, large-scale systems are presently distributed where the support regimes <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> consistent, or the most advantageous. Total capacity of worldwide PV plants above 4 MWAC was assessed by Wiki-Solar as 36 GW in c. 2,300 installations {{at the end of}} 2014 and represents about 25 percent of total global PV capacity of 139GW. The countries which had the most capacity, in descending order, were the United States, China, Germany, India, United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, Canada and South Africa. Activities in the key markets are reviewed individually below.|$|E
5|$|Burnell {{was behind}} {{the efforts of the}} royal {{officials}} to enforce royal rights during his term of office as chancellor, including the implementation of the Quo warranto procedures. He also helped with the legislative and legal reforms of Edward's reign. During Burnell's tenure the chancellor's office and records became fixed in London rather than travelling with the king. Burnell went abroad on diplomatic missions for Edward, and for a time governed Gascony. He continued to enjoy the king's trust until his death in 1292; one historian has suggested that Burnell may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> important royal official of the 13th century.|$|E

5|$|Filmed in Canada, {{principal}} photography {{took place}} in Montreal, Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, and several other Quebec locations {{during the summer and}} autumn of 1999. In January 1999, Travolta flew his private Boeing 727 on a secret visit to Montreal to scout out locations for shooting. The film was reported to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> expensive production shot in Canada up to that point. It was also reported that the production costs would have been twice as high had the film been shot in the United States. Almost every shot in the film is at a Dutch angle, because, according to Roger Christian, he wanted the film to look like a comic book.|$|E
5|$|Harry's Walls are {{the remains}} of an {{unfinished}} artillery fort, started in 1551 {{by the government of}} Edward VI to defend the island of St Mary's in the Isles of Scilly. Constructed to defend the harbour of Hugh Town from possible French attack, the fortification incorporated Italianate-style bastions with protective orillons and would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> advanced design in the kingdom at the time. It was not completed, probably due to a shortage of funds and the passing of the invasion threat, and only the south-west side remains. In the 21st century, Harry's Walls are managed by English Heritage and open to visitors.|$|E
5|$|Historically, insects <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> {{significant}} herbivores, and {{the evolution}} of land plants is closely associated with the evolution of insects. While most plant defenses are directed against insects, other defenses have evolved that are aimed at vertebrate herbivores, such as birds and mammals. The study of plant defenses against herbivory is important, not only from an evolutionary view point, but also in the direct impact that these defenses have on agriculture, including human and livestock food sources; as beneficial 'biological control agents' in biological pest control programs; {{as well as in the}} search for plants of medical importance.|$|E

The paths connect with the major north-south axis that runs between San Pedro de Atacama and Copiapo. This axis is associated with the extensive Inca road system.|$|E
5|$|Minneapolis {{is home to}} five {{professional}} sports teams. In recent years, the Minnesota Lynx <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> successful sports team {{in the city and}} a dominant force in the WNBA, reaching the WNBA Finals in 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2016, and 2017 and winning in 2011, 2013, 2015 and 2017. The Minnesota Timberwolves brought NBA basketball back to Minneapolis in 1989, followed by the Lynx in 1999. Both basketball teams play in the Target Center, but the Lynx played the 2017 season at the Xcel Energy Center in St. Paul and the 2017 postseason in the University of Minnesota's Williams Arena during remodeling at Target Center.|$|E
5|$|Norte Chico {{sites are}} notable for {{exceptional}} collective density, {{as well as}} individual size. Haas argues that the density of sites in such a small area is globally unique for a nascent civilization. During the third millennium BC, Norte Chico may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> densely populated area of the world (excepting, possibly, northern China). The Supe, Pativilca, Fortaleza, and Huaura River valleys each have several related sites.|$|E

Bob Fitzsimmons was set to fight Tom Sharkey {{that night at the}} Mechanics' Pavilion in San Francisco. Earp had refereed 30 or so matches in earlier days, though not under the Marquess of Queensberry Rules, but under the older and more liberal London Prize Ring Rules. The fight may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> anticipated fight on American soil that year. Fitzsimmons was favored to win, and the public and even civic officials placed bets on the outcome.|$|E
5|$|The European Cup was an {{association}} football competition contested from 1956 to 1992. Spanish manager José Villalonga Llorente led Real Madrid {{to success in}} the inaugural final in 1956 and repeated the feat the following season. English clubs and managers dominated the competition in the late 1970s and early 1980s, winning every tournament from 1977 to 1982.
