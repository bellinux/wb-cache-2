5|$|These {{advantages}} {{offset the}} <b>high</b> <b>stress,</b> physical exertion costs, and other {{risks of the}} migration. Predation can be heightened during migration: Eleonora's falcon Falco eleonorae, which breeds on Mediterranean islands, has a very late breeding season, coordinated with the autumn passage of southbound passerine migrants, which it feeds to its young. A similar strategy is adopted by the greater noctule bat, which preys on nocturnal passerine migrants. The higher concentrations of migrating birds at stopover sites make them prone to parasites and pathogens, which require a heightened immune response.|$|E

5|$|Both {{environmental}} factors and genetics {{are associated with}} alcoholism with about half the risk attributed to each. A person with a parent or sibling with alcoholism is {{three to four times}} more likely to be alcoholic themselves.

People may continue to drink partly to prevent or improve symptoms of withdrawal. A low level of withdrawal may last for months following stopping.

25|$|A related area of {{research}} is the neuroscience basis of nightmares. Many studies have confirmed a high prevalence of nightmares and some have correlated them with <b>high</b> <b>stress</b> levels. Multiple models of nightmare production have been proposed including neo-Freudian models {{as well as other}} models such as image contextualization model, boundary thickness model, threat simulation model etc. Neurotransmitter imbalance has been proposed as a cause of nightmares, as also affective network dysfunction- a model which claims that nightmare is a product of dysfunction of circuitry normally involved in dreaming. As with dreaming, none of the models have yielded conclusive results and studies continue about these questions.|$|E

25|$|Approximately 1800 of the world's 10,000 {{bird species}} are long-distance migrants. The primary {{motivation}} for migration {{appears to be}} food; for example, some hummingbirds choose not to migrate if fed through the winter. Also, the longer days of the northern summer provide extended time for breeding birds to feed their young. This helps diurnal birds to produce larger clutches than related non-migratory species that remain in the tropics. As the days shorten in autumn, the birds return to warmer regions where the available food supply varies little with the season. These advantages offset the <b>high</b> <b>stress,</b> physical exertion costs, and other risks of the migration such as predation.|$|E
25|$|Steel, {{carbon fiber}} and glass among others are usually {{considered}} linear materials, while other {{materials such as}} rubber and soils are non-linear. However, {{this is not an}} absolute classification: if very small stresses or strains are applied to a non-linear material, the response will be linear, but if very <b>high</b> <b>stress</b> or strain is applied to a linear material, the linear theory will not be enough. For example, as the linear theory implies reversibility, it would be absurd to use the linear theory to describe the failure of a steel bridge under a high load; although steel is a linear material for most applications, it is not in such a case of catastrophic failure.|$|E
25|$|Rearranging the Laplace and Poiseuille {{relations}} {{suggests that}} radial growth occurs {{as a result}} of circumferential stretch and circumferential growth {{occurs as a result}} of shear stress. Shear stress is proportional to the speed inside the vessel as well as the pressure drop between two fixed points on the vessel wall. The precise mechanism of vessel remodelling is believed to be <b>high</b> <b>stress</b> on the inner wall of the vessel which can induce growth, which heads toward uniform compressive and tensile stress {{on both sides of the}} vessel wall. Generally, it has been found that circumferential residual stress is compressive and tensile, indicating that inner layers of the endothelial tube grow more than outer layers.|$|E
30|$|In summary, <b>high</b> glucose <b>stress</b> {{improved}} more reservoirs for intracellular pigments storage {{by increasing}} the content of Monascus mycelia and the lipids content in Monascus mycelia. Simultaneously, <b>high</b> glucose <b>stress</b> up-regulated the expression of pigment biosynthetic genes, especially the genes involved in yellow pigments biosynthetic. Thereby, {{a high proportion of}} intracellular yellow pigments rather than orange pigments were achieved under <b>high</b> glucose <b>stress.</b> <b>High</b> glucose <b>stress</b> also improved the fluidity and permeability of the cell membrane and enhanced the trans-membrane conversion of intracellular pigments to extracellular water-soluble yellow pigments and secretion into the broth, resulted in a twofold increase of extracellular water-soluble yellow pigments compared to low IGC condition. Further studies are needed to elucidate the molecular pathways through which <b>high</b> glucose <b>stress</b> regulates yellow pigments production. Thus, submerged fermentation under <b>high</b> glucose <b>stress</b> has potential application in the production of Monascus yellow pigments.|$|R
50|$|All MHV {{models are}} {{vulnerable}} to thrombus formation due to <b>high</b> shear <b>stress,</b> stagnation, and flow separation. The caged-ball designs experience <b>high</b> <b>stresses</b> at the walls that can damage cells, as well as flow separation due to high-velocity reverse flow surrounded by stagnant flow. Tilting-disc valves have flow separation behind the valve struts and disc {{as a result of}} a combination of high velocity and stagnant flows. The bileaflet models have <b>high</b> <b>stresses</b> during forward and leakage flows as well as adjacent stagnant flow in the hinge area. As it turns out, the hinge area is the most critical part of bileaflets and is where the thrombus formation usually prevails.|$|R

25|$|In general, {{facilitation}} is {{more likely}} to occur in physically stressful environments than in favorable environments, where competition {{may be the most important}} interaction among species. This can also occur in a single habitat containing a gradient from low to <b>high</b> <b>stress.</b> For example, along a New England, USA, salt marsh tidal gradient, a presence of black needle rush (Juncus gerardii) increased the fitness of marsh elder (Iva annua) shrubs in lower elevations, where soil salinity was higher. The rush shaded the soil, which decreased evapotranspiration, and in turn decreased soil salinity. However, at higher elevations where soil salinity was lower, marsh elder fitness was decreased in the presence of the rush, due to increased competition for resources. Thus, the nature of species interactions may shift with environmental conditions.|$|E
25|$|Approximately 10 {{percent of}} IBS cases are {{triggered}} by an acute gastroenteritis infection. Genetic defects {{relating to the}} innate immune system and epithelial barrier as well as <b>high</b> <b>stress</b> and anxiety levels appear to {{increase the risk of}} developing post-infectious IBS. Post-infectious IBS usually manifests itself as the diarrhea-predominant subtype. Evidence has demonstrated that the release of high levels of proinflammatory cytokines during acute enteric infection causes increased gut permeability leading to translocation of the commensal bacteria across the epithelial barrier resulting in significant damage to local tissues, which can result in chronic gut abnormalities in sensitive individuals. However, increased gut permeability is strongly associated with IBS regardless of whether IBS was initiated by an infection or not. A link between small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and tropical sprue has been proposed {{to be involved in the}} aetiology of post-infectious IBS.|$|E
25|$|Film {{capacitors}} for use {{in electronic}} equipment are packaged in the common and usual industry styles: axial, radial, and SMD. Traditional axial type packages are less used today, but are still specified for point-to-point wiring and some traditional through-hole printed circuit boards. The most common form factor is the radial type (single ended), with both terminals {{on one side of}} the capacitor body. To facilitate automated insertion, radial plastic film capacitors are commonly constructed with terminal spacings at standardized distances, starting with 2.5mm pitch and increasing in 2.5mm steps. Radial capacitors are available potted in plastic cases, or dipped in an epoxy resin to protect the capacitor body against environmental influences. Although the transient heat of reflow soldering induces <b>high</b> <b>stress</b> in the plastic film materials, film capacitors able to withstand such temperatures are available in Surface Mounted Device“ (SMD) packages.|$|E
