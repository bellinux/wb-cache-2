As a rule they did not wear face-masks, only little dominoes of black cloth or green cloth or white cloth coming down to the mouth. Which is much better. For the old modelled <b>half-masks</b> with the lace frill, the awful proboscis sticking forward white and ghastly like the beaks of corpse-birds--such as the old Venice masks--these I think are simply horrifying.

A few days later, an audio recording of this exchange was released by The Guardian newspaper. Recruitment Gone Wrong reenacts this exchange by animating each of its four main characters through the automation of four ventriloquists’ <b>half-masks.</b> Unlike conventional ventriloquists’ dummies, <b>half-masks</b> can be worn by an individual, transforming a person into a comical ‘living’ dummy, and so although each mask will be moving according to its assigned character even when suspended in the gallery space, a visitor or group of visitors can choose to wear any of them at prescribed times, thus channeling {{the words of the}} students and/or recruiters through their own (cyborg) bodies. We think of Recruitment Gone Wrong as an automated mechanical reenactment and a kind of karaoke, constantly re-breathing life into a covert audio recording that touches on issues of our human rights to freedom of information and privacy in our contemporary world –issues that we think comprise part of the critical framework surrounding the need for Open Data, Open source culture and net neutrality. For us, this exchange between students and recruiters highlights a burgeoning culture, where we are encouraged to accept ubiquitous invasions of privacy for commercial and political gain as a ‘new normal. ...|$|R
5000|$|Adam de Coster {{was not in}} {{the habit}} of signing or dating his works. As a result, many of his works were {{attributed}} to other Caravaggisti. His oeuvre has been reconstituted mainly on the basis of an engraving made by Lucas Vorsterman the Elder (1595-1675) after the lost painting [...] [...] The engraving depicted tric-trac players and a musician illuminated by two burning candles on a table. The engraving states in the lower margin: [...] "A De Coster pi:", which shows that it was engraved after an original work by de Coster. [...] This work provided the basis for the attribution of further paintings. [...] The English art historian Benedict Nicolson {{played an important role in}} the rediscovery of the artist and the re-attribution of works to de Coster.Adam de Coster’s oeuvre is mainly composed of genre paintings with half-length figures and dramatic light effects. He preferred stark chiaroscuro and returned time and again to the motif of half-length figures illuminated by candlelight. He was clearly familiar with the work of Caravaggio and his followers and in particular the Utrecht Caravaggists. De Coster's paintings show a certain affinity with those of Georges de La Tour and other French variations of the tenebrist movement in Caravaggism. More direct influences, however, are Gerard Honthorst and Antonio Campi. [...] He often used the trope of the <b>half-masked</b> flame in his compositions.|$|R
2500|$|Fit {{testing of}} tight-fitting masks of negative-pressure {{respirators}} became {{widely used in}} US industry in 1980-s. At the beginning, {{it was thought that}} the <b>half-mask</b> fit quite well to the worker's face, if during a fit test the protection factor (fit factor) is not less than 10 (later, experts began to use [...] "safety factor" [...] = 10 during the fit test; threshold fit factor become 10 × 10 = 100). The widespread use of fit testing in the industry gives professionals optimism, and they allowed to the employers restrict the use of half mask respirators in accordance with the values of worker's personal fit factor (the maximum concentration of pollutants = personal Fit Factor × PEL), but not more than 100 × PEL. However, scientific studies have shown that although such test increases the effectiveness of protection, the risk of leakage of large amounts of unfiltered air is maintained. Furthermore, the studies have shown that non-filtered air under the mask is not uniformly mixed with the filtered air, which leads to large errors in the measurement of the in-facepiece concentration of contaminants, and subsequent calculations of fit factors - the latter is often much smaller than the [...] "measured" [...] value. So, specialists recommend not allowed usage negative pressure half mask respirators then harmful substances' concentrations exceeds 10 PEL. Therefore, OSHA standards require to restrict using of <b>half-mask</b> negative-pressure respirators up to 10 PEL after obtaining fit factor {{greater than or equal to}} 100 during the mask selection for the worker (they used a safety factor = 10).|$|E
2500|$|A {{preview of}} the first act was staged at Sydmonton (Lloyd Webber's home) in 1985, {{starring}} Colm Wilkinson (later {{the star of the}} Toronto production) as the Phantom, Sarah Brightman as Kristin (later Christine), and Clive Carter (later a member of the London cast) as Raoul. This very preliminary production used Richard Stilgoe's original unaltered lyrics, and many songs sported names that were later changed, such as [...] "What Has Time Done to Me" [...] ("Think of Me"), and [...] "Papers" [...] ("Notes"). The Phantom's original mask covered the entire face and remained in place throughout the performance, obscuring the actor's vision and muffling his voice. Björnson designed the now-iconic <b>half-mask</b> to replace it, and the unmasking sequence was added. Clips of this preview performance were included on the DVD of the 2004 film production.|$|E

The following week on Raw, Kane won the Intercontinental Championship from Chris Jericho, despite interference from Triple H and Ric Flair. On the October 7 episode of Raw, Kane successfully single-handedly defended the World Tag Team Championship in a four-team Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match, as The Hurricane had been attacked earlier that evening by Triple H and Ric Flair and was unable to compete.

60|$|Donop led on {{his troops}} in gallant style {{under cover of}} a heavy fire from his battery. They {{advanced}} in two columns to attack the outworks in two places. As they advanced they were excessively galled by a flanking fire from the American galleys and batteries, and by sharp volleys from the outworks. The latter, however, as had been concerted, were quickly abandoned by the garrison. The enemy entered at two places, and imagining the day their own, the two columns pushed on with shouts to storm {{different parts of the}} redoubt. As yet no troops were to be seen; but as one of the columns approached the redoubt on the north side, a tremendous discharge of grape-shot and musketry burst forth from the embrasures in front, and a <b>half-masked</b> battery on the left. The slaughter was prodigious; the column was driven back in confusion. Count Donop, with the other column, in attempting {{the south side of the}} redoubt, had passed the abatis when a similar tempest of artillery and musketry burst upon them. Some were killed on the spot, many were wounded, and the rest were driven out. Donop himself received a mortal wound; Lieutenant-colonel Mingerode, the second in command, was also dangerously wounded. Several other of the best officers were slain or disabled. The troops retreated in confusion, hotly pursued, and were again cut up in their retreat by the flanking fire from the galleys and floating batteries. The loss of the enemy in killed and wounded, in this brief but severe action, was about four hundred men; that of the Americans, eight killed and twenty-nine wounded.|$|R
40|$|In {{director}} John Bell’s fast-paced farce, Ephesus is a Turkish {{town with}} (in Jennie Tate’s lively design) splodgy whitewashed walls, market stalls and sinister types in Commedia <b>half-masks.</b> The fez is the chapeau of choice, as are turbans like minarets {{and the sort}} of harem pants Jeannie would dream of. And, adding to the Maxfield Parrish colour and the catchy Arabic grooves from composer Phillip Johnston, is some real before-your-eyes magic from Ross Skeffington, tying scarves in knots, frisking an audience member’s jacket and materialising fluttering doves. The play opens as the Duke (David Davies) looking more like a South American brigand, demands that the beleaguered Egeon (played with distinction by Robert Alexander) explain himself. It is the longest speech in the play and Alexander navigates it with measured care. But, from then on, the pace is hectic as the interchanging Antipholi and Dromios perplex themselves and everybody else by not recognising each other, or a wife, or the merchant who sold them a gold chain until, eventually, everything is in a spin of cross-purposes. There are some excellent performances here. Blazey Best is notable as the bewildered wife Adriana, especially when she despatches a clunky exposition speech with fast forward speed. Anna Volsky transforms from Sister Wendy to Emilia the long lost mother. Sean O’Shea and Christopher Stollery play the Antipholus twins with raffish charm and Paul Eastway as Dromio of Ephesus is a nice foil to Dareen Gilshenan who is outstanding as Dromio One - all swagger and comic business in clown-red cap and stripes. He is hilarious to watch and his nasal delivery, complete with Ron Glumm intonation, only adds more appeal to a portrait of a wily servant...|$|R
60|$|The sun on {{the grass}} was dry and hot. So in {{plunging}} into the wood they had a cool shock of shadow, as of divers who plunge into a dim pool. The inside of the wood was full of shattered sunlight and shaken shadows. They made a sort of shuddering veil, almost recalling the dizziness of a cinematograph. Even the solid figures walking with him Syme could hardly see for the patterns of sun and shade that danced upon them. Now a man's head was lit as with a light of Rembrandt, leaving all else obliterated; now again he had strong and staring white hands {{with the face of}} a negro. The ex-Marquis had pulled the old straw hat over his eyes, and the black shade of the brim cut his face so squarely in two that it seemed to be wearing one of the black <b>half-masks</b> of their pursuers. The fancy tinted Syme's overwhelming sense of wonder. Was he wearing a mask? Was anyone wearing a mask? Was anyone anything? This wood of witchery, in which men's faces turned black and white by turns, in which their figures first swelled into sunlight and then faded into formless night, this mere chaos of chiaroscuro (after the clear daylight outside), seemed to Syme a perfect symbol {{of the world in which}} he had been moving for three days, this world where men took off their beards and their spectacles and their noses, and turned into other people. That tragic self-confidence which he had felt when he believed that the Marquis was a devil had strangely disappeared now that he knew that the Marquis was a friend. He felt almost inclined to ask after all these bewilderments what was a friend and what an enemy. Was there anything that was apart from what it seemed? The Marquis had taken off his nose and turned out to be a detective. Might he not just as well take off his head and turn out to be a hobgoblin? Was not everything, after all, like this bewildering woodland, this dance of dark and light? Everything only a glimpse, the glimpse always unforeseen, and always forgotten. For Gabriel Syme had found in the heart of that sun-splashed wood what many modern painters had found there. He had found the thing which the modern people call Impressionism, which is another name for that final scepticism which can find no floor to the universe.|$|R

One face wore a black <b>half-mask,</b> and under it the mouth was twisting about in such a madness of nerves that the black tuft of beard wriggled round and round like a restless, living thing. The other was the red face and white moustache of Colonel Ducroix. They were in earnest consultation.|$|E

60|$|He turned round immediately, {{and saw a}} masked woman {{standing}} alone in the room, dressed entirely in yellow from head to foot. She had a yellow hood, a yellow <b>half-mask</b> with deep fringe hanging down over her mouth, and a yellow domino, cut at the sleeves and edges into long flame-shaped points, which waved backward and forward tremulously in the light air wafted through the doorway. The woman's black eyes seemed to gleam with an evil brightness through the sight-holes of the mask, and the tawny fringe hanging before her mouth fluttered slowly with every breath she drew. Without a word or a gesture she stood before the table, and her gleaming black eyes fixed steadily on Fabio the instant he confronted her. A sudden chill struck through him, as he observed that the yellow of the stranger's domino and mask was of precisely the same shade as the yellow of the hangings and furniture which his wife had chosen after their marriage for the decoration of her favorite sitting-room.|$|E
60|$|An {{observer}} standing, at this time, at {{the corner}} of Paradise avenue and Great White Throne walk in Sorrel Hill cemetery would have seen a human figure moving among the graves toward the Superintendent's residence. Dimly and fitfully visible in the intervals of thinner gloom, this figure had a most uncanny and disquieting aspect. A long black cloak shrouded it from neck to heel. Upon its head was a slouch hat, pulled down across the forehead and almost concealing the face, which was further hidden by a <b>half-mask,</b> only the beard being occasionally visible as the head was lifted partly above the collar of the cloak. The man wore upon his feet jack-boots whose wide, funnel-shaped legs had settled down in many a fold and crease about his ankles, as could be seen whenever accident parted the bottom of the cloak. His arms were concealed, but sometimes he stretched out the right to steady himself by a headstone as he crept stealthily but blindly over the uneven ground. At such times a close scrutiny of the hand would have disclosed in the palm the hilt of a poniard, the blade of which lay along the wrist, hidden in the sleeve. In short, the man's garb, his movements, the hour--everything proclaimed him a reporter.|$|E
