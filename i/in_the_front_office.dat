5|$|The Indians rehired Peckinpaugh {{as their}} manager in 1941, signing {{him to a}} two-year contract; team {{president}} Alva Bradley, who fired Peckinpaugh in 1933, promised Peckinpaugh full cooperation and minimal interference. After the 1941 season, {{he was promoted to}} vice president, later serving as Cleveland's general manager (GM) and president. When Bill Veeck bought the Indians in July 1946, he brought Harry Grabiner and Joseph C. Hostetler with him to serve <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>office.</b> Peckinpaugh and Bradley resigned.|$|E

50|$|Roosevelt's {{popularity}} swept many Republican house candidates into office, cementing their majority {{over the}} opposition Democratic Party. Because Roosevelt {{came from a}} liberal wing of the Republican Party, his ideology was prevalent among freshman representatives. Progressive Republicanism mobilized a new base of support and proved to be especially popular among the Protestant middle-class workers who held jobs in business or <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>offices</b> of industrial facilities.|$|R
5|$|As {{the trade}} {{deadline}} approached, it was {{speculated that the}} Phillies would surrender older players to obtain younger ones. They made two deals, neither involving key components of the team. In August they had their best month of the season: a 14–13 record, thanks to strong pitching and adequate hitting. Although the Phillies began September with four pitchers combining for a no-hitter, their month deteriorated from there. The squad had an 11–15 record, finishing the season with 73 wins and 89 losses. Significant personnel changes {{on the field and}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>office</b> were expected during the offseason.|$|E
5|$|Nap Lajoie {{discovered}} Peckinpaugh as a {{high school}} student, and signed him to his first professional contract. Peckinpaugh debuted with the Naps, who traded him to the Yankees in 1913. He managed the Yankees for 20 games in 1914 and was the team captain for the remainder of his time with the club. The Senators acquired Peckinpaugh, where he continued to play until his final season, spent with the White Sox. After his playing career, Peckinpaugh managed the Indians from 1928 through 1933 and in 1941. He was also a minor league baseball manager, and served <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>office</b> of the Indians and Buffalo Bisons from 1942 through 1947.|$|E
5|$|The Avalanche's success came amid {{considerable}} turmoil <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>office.</b> COMSAT's diversification into sports ownership was proving a {{drain on}} the company. In particular, cost overruns associated {{with the construction of}} Pepsi Center had shareholders up in arms. Finally, in 1997, COMSAT agreed in principle to sell Ascent to Liberty Media. However, Liberty was not interested in sports ownership at the time (though it has since bought Major League Baseball's Atlanta Braves), and made the deal contingent upon Ascent selling the Avalanche and Nuggets.|$|E

5|$|With the {{acquisition}} of speed in a trade with the Pittsburgh Pirates, including Dots Miller, Art Butler, Cozy Dolan and Chief Wilson, the Cardinals contended for the NL pennant in 1914. Finishing in third place, it was the Cardinals' best finish since 1876, but they fell back to sixth in 1915 and last in 1916. When Britton sold the team after that season, she offered Huggins a chance to buy {{a part of the}} team. While he was attempting to raise money from the Fleischmann family, Britton sold the team to a group headed by Samuel Breadon, who hired Branch Rickey to run the team's day-to-day operations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>office.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Habs {{finished}} the 2011–12 season last in their conference {{for the first}} time in over 80 years, as injuries decimated the team all season. After a disappointing season, the Canadiens started over <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>office.</b> They fired General Manager Pierre Gauthier, and Marc Bergevin was named the new general manager on May 2, 2012. The search then began for a new head coach and on June 5, Michel Therrien was named the new head coach. This would be Therrien's second stint as the Canadiens head coach after he previously coached the team from 2000 to 2003; and Randy Cunneyworth and Randy Ladouceur were relieved of their assistant coaching duties. On June 15, Gerard Gallant, J. J. Daigneault and Clement Jodoin were added to Montreal's coaching staff as assistant coaches.|$|E

25|$|Following his retirement, Clarke's first {{stint as}} Flyers general manager lasted six seasons and {{included}} two {{trips to the}} Stanley Cup Finals in 1985 and 1987.

25|$|During {{the summer}} of 2003, long-time GM Jerry Krause retired, and former player and color {{commentator}} John Paxson was tapped as his successor. Jay Williams, coming off a promising rookie campaign, was seriously injured in a motorcycle accident. His contract was bought out by the Bulls in February 2004 and {{he has yet to}} return to the game. Paxson selected point guard Kirk Hinrich with the seventh pick in the draft, and signed veteran free agent and former franchise player Scottie Pippen. With Pippen playing, Cartwright at the sidelines, and Paxson <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>office,</b> the Bulls hoped that some of the championship magic from before would return.|$|E
25|$|Cox {{returned}} to the dugout as manager {{in the middle of}} the 1990 season, replacing Russ Nixon. The Braves finished the year with the worst record in baseball, at 65–97. They traded Dale Murphy to the Philadelphia Phillies after it was clear he was becoming a less dominant player. Pitching coach Leo Mazzone began developing young pitchers Tom Glavine, Steve Avery, and John Smoltz into future stars. That same year, the Braves used the number one overall pick in the 1990 MLB draft to select Chipper Jones, who became one of the best hitters in team history. Perhaps the Braves' most important move was not on the field, but <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>office.</b> Immediately after the season, John Schuerholz was hired away from the Kansas City Royals as general manager.|$|E

25|$|One {{reason for}} the team's struggles was disarray <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>office.</b> Marshall began a mental decline in 1962, and the team's other {{stockholders}} {{found it difficult to}} make decisions without their boss. Marshall died on August 9, 1969, and Edward Bennett Williams, a minority stockholder who was a Washington resident and one of America's most esteemed attorneys, was chosen to run the franchise while the majority stockholder, Jack Kent Cooke, lived in Los Angeles and ran his basketball team, the Los Angeles Lakers. In 1966 Otto Graham was hired as the new head coach. Graham coached the Redskins between 1966 and 1968, but whatever magic he had as an NFL player disappeared on the sidelines as the team recorded a mark of 17–22–3 during that time period. After resigning the Redskins' post in favor of Vince Lombardi, Graham returned as athletic director of the Coast Guard Academy before retiring at the end of 1984.|$|E
25|$|Model {{validation}} (MV) {{takes the}} models and methods developed by front office, library, and modeling quantitative analysts and determines their validity and correctness. The MV group {{might well be}} seen as a superset of the quantitative operations in a financial institution, since it must deal with new and advanced models and trading techniques from across the firm. Before the crisis however, the pay structure in all firms was such that MV groups struggle to attract and retain adequate staff, often with talented quantitative analysts leaving at the first opportunity. This gravely impacted corporate ability to manage model risk, or to ensure that the positions being held were correctly valued. An MV quantitative analyst would typically earn a fraction of quantitative analysts in other groups with similar length of experience. In the years following the crisis, this has changed. Regulators now typically talk directly to the quants in the middle office such as the model validators, and since profits highly depend of the regulatory infrastructure, model validation has gained in weight and importance with respect to the quants <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>office.</b>|$|E
25|$|During the {{continued}} playoff drought, instability <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>office</b> mirrored the Islanders' substandard {{performance on the}} ice. Pickett sold the team to Dallas businessman John Spano in 1996. However, {{three months after the}} 1997 closing, Spano had only paid Pickett a fraction of the first installment on the cable rights deal. Several Islanders executives tipped off Newsday that something was amiss about their new boss. In July, Newsday exposed Spano as a fraud who did not have the assets required to complete the deal. The investigation showed that Spano had deliberately misled the NHL and the Islanders about his net worth, and also had two lawsuits pending against him. Within days of the report, Spano was forced to relinquish the team to Pickett. Federal prosecutors turned up evidence that Spano had forged many of the documents used to vouch for his wealth and to promise payment to Pickett, and even appeared to have sent many of the documents from his own office in Dallas. He was sentenced to 71 months in prison for bank and wire fraud. The NHL took additional heat when reports surfaced that the league spent well under $1,000 (depending on the source, the league spent either $525 or $750) to check Spano's background. It subsequently stiffened the process for vetting future owners. The incident and its aftermath were covered in the ESPN 30 for 30 documentary, Big Shot. Pickett finally found a buyer, a group led by Howard Milstein and Phoenix Coyotes co-owner Steven Gluckstern, a deal which almost fell through when Spectacor Management Group, which managed the Coliseum for Nassau County, tried to force Pickett to certify that the Coliseum was safe. Pickett refused, since the Coliseum had fallen into disrepair in recent seasons. SMG backed down under pressure from the Islanders, the NHL, and Nassau County officials.|$|E
