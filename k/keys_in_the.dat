5|$|Despite this, many post-grunge bands {{adopted a}} hard rock sound {{and in the}} 2000s there came a renewed {{interest}} in established bands, attempts at a revival, and new hard rock bands that emerged from the garage rock and post-punk revival scenes. Out of this movement came garage rock bands like the White Stripes, the Strokes, Interpol and, later on, the Black <b>Keys.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 2000s, only a few hard rock bands from the 1970s and 1980s managed to sustain highly successful recording careers.|$|E

40|$|This paper proposes {{optimization}} {{models of}} crude oil distillation column for both limited and unlimited feed stock and market value of known products prices. The feed to the crude distillation column {{was assumed to be}} crude oil containing naphtha gas, kerosene, petrol and diesel as the light-light key, light key, heavy key and heavy-heavy key respectively. The models determined maximum concentrations of heavy <b>key</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> distillate and light <b>key</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bottom for limited feed stock and market condition. Both were impurities in their respective positions of the column. The limiting constraints were sales specification concentration of light <b>key</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> distillate [ ], heavy <b>key</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bottom [ ] and an operating loading constraint of flooding above the feed tray. For unlimited feed stock and market condition, the optimization models determined the optimum separation [ and ] and feed flow rate that would give maximum profit with minimum purity sales specification constraints of light <b>key</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> distillate and heavy <b>key</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bottom as stated above. The feed loading was limited by the reboiler capacity. However, there is need to simulate the optimization models for an existing crude oil distillation column of a refinery in order to validate the models...|$|R

When Joplin used minor <b>keys</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{previous}} sections, he used the relative key of G minor (i.e., relative to the main key of B-flat major). However, in this fourth section, he instead used the parallel key. This strain also features sections where the right hand and left hand play notes in unison, and in which the standard 2/4 time left-hand beat is noticeably absent.|$|E

5|$|September 25, 1998 - Hurricane Georges {{passes over}} Key West as a Category2 {{hurricane}}, and days later it moves eastward through the Florida Panhandle after hitting Biloxi, Mississippi.

There, Georges damages 1,363homes and destroys 173houses, with damage amounting to $270million (1998USD) in the <b>Keys.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Florida Panhandle, the storm drops 38.46inches (977mm) of rain in Munson and results in $70million in damage (1998USD, $93million 2008USD).|$|E

5|$|Kuznetsova rebounded at the Wuhan Open, {{reaching}} the semifinals which boosted her hopes {{to qualify for}} the WTA Finals {{for the first time since}} 2009. This run included defeating defending champion Venus Williams and Agnieszka Radwańska, after saving match point. She then lost to fellow Singapore contender Dominika Cibulková in a tight three set match. At the China Open, Kuznetsova received a bye into the second round due to her impressive performance at Wuhan. She defeated Misaki Doi but lost to yet another Singapore Contender Madison <b>Keys</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> third round. Being the favourite for the title in Tianjin after top seed Agnieszka Radwańska withdrew from her Quarterfinal match, Kuznetsova disappointingly lost to Alison Riske in the semifinals. This would have kept her out of Singapore, until Serena Williams withdrew from Singapore and that left a spot up to grabs.|$|E

5000|$|To {{add a new}} list {{of numbers}} and arrive at a total, the user was first {{required}} to [...] "ZERO" [...] the machine. Then, to add sets of numbers, the user was required to press numbered keys on a keyboard, which would remain depressed (rather than immediately rebound like the keys of a computer keyboard or typewriter or the buttons of a typical modern machine). The user would then pull the crank, which caused the numbers to be shown on the rotary wheels, and the keys to be released (i.e. to pop back up) <b>in</b> preparation for <b>the</b> next input. To add, for example, the amounts of 30.72 and 4.49 (which, in adding machine terms, on a decimal adding machine is 3,072 plus 449 [...] "decimal units"), the following process took place: Press <b>the</b> 3 <b>key</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> column fourth from the right (multiples of one thousand), <b>the</b> 7 <b>key</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> column 2nd from right (multiples of ten) and <b>the</b> 2 <b>key</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rightmost column (multiples of 1). Pull the crank. The rotary wheels now showed 3072. Press <b>the</b> 4 <b>key</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 3rd column from the right, <b>the</b> 4 <b>key</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2nd column from right, and <b>the</b> 9 <b>key</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rightmost column. Pull the crank. The rotary wheels now show a running 'total' of 3521 which, when interpreted using the decimal currency colour-coding of the key columns, equates to 35.21. Keyboards typically did not have or need [...] "0" [...] (zero) keys; one simply did not press any <b>key</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> column containing a zero. Trailing zeros (those {{to the right of}} a number), were there by default because when a machine was zeroed, all numbers visible on the rotary wheels were reset to zero. Subtraction was impossible, except by adding the complement of a number (for instance, subtract 2.50 by adding 9,997.50).|$|R
