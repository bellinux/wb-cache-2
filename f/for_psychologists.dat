25|$|One role <b>for</b> <b>psychologists</b> in the {{military}} is to evaluate and counsel soldiers and other personnel. In the U.S., this function began during World War I, when Robert Yerkes established the School of Military Psychology at Fort Oglethorpe in Georgia, to provide psychological training for military staff military. Today, U.S Army psychology includes psychological screening, clinical psychotherapy, suicide prevention, and treatment for post-traumatic stress, {{as well as other}} aspects of health and workplace psychology such as smoking cessation.|$|E

25|$|The {{concept has}} a long history in {{philosophical}} and ethical thought. The term was originally coined in the 19th century by the founding sociologist and philosopher of science, Auguste Comte, and has become a major topic <b>for</b> <b>psychologists</b> (especially evolutionary psychology researchers), evolutionary biologists, and ethologists. Whilst ideas about altruism from one field can affect the other fields, the different methods and focuses of these fields always lead to different perspectives on altruism. In simple terms, altruism is caring about the welfare of other people and acting to help them.|$|E
2500|$|In his 1998 book Ethics in Psychology, Gerald Koocher {{notes that}} some believe [...] "reprinting {{copies of the}} Rorschach plates ... and listing common {{responses}} represents a serious unethical act" [...] <b>for</b> <b>psychologists</b> and is indicative of [...] "questionable professional judgment".|$|E

2500|$|Minority stress {{describes}} chronically {{high levels}} of stress faced by members of stigmatized minority groups. [...] It {{may be caused by}} a number of factors, including poor social support and low socioeconomic status, but the most well understood causes of minority stress are interpersonal prejudice and discrimination. Indeed, numerous scientific studies have shown that minority individuals experience a high degree of prejudice, which causes stress responses (e.g., high blood pressure, anxiety) that accrue over time, eventually leading to poor mental and physical health. Minority stress theory summarizes these scientific studies to explain how difficult social situations lead to chronic stress and poor health among minority individuals. [...] It is an important concept <b>for</b> <b>psychologists</b> and public health officials who seek to understand and reduce minority health disparities.|$|E
2500|$|The field {{began to}} {{organize}} {{under the name}} [...] "clinical psychology" [...] in 1917 with {{the founding of the}} American Association of Clinical Psychology. [...] This only lasted until 1919, after which the American Psychological Association (founded by G. Stanley Hall in 1892) developed a section on Clinical Psychology, which offered certification until 1927. Growth in the field was slow {{for the next few years}} when various unconnected psychological organizations came together as the American Association of Applied Psychology in 1930, which would act as the primary forum <b>for</b> <b>psychologists</b> until after World War II when the APA reorganized. In 1945, the APA created what is now called Division 12, its division of clinical psychology, which remains a leading organization in the field. Psychological societies and associations in other English-speaking countries developed similar divisions, including in Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.|$|E
2500|$|In Germany, the {{practice}} of psychotherapy for adults is restricted to qualified psychologists and physicians (including psychiatrists) who have completed several years of specialist practical training and certification in psychotherapy. As psychoanalysis, psychodynamic therapy, and cognitive behavioral therapy {{meet the requirements of}} German health insurance companies, mental health professionals regularly opt for one of these three specializations in their postgraduate training. <b>For</b> <b>psychologists,</b> this includes three years of full-time practical training (4.200 hours), encompassing a year-long internship at an accredited psychiatric institution, six months of clinical work at an outpatient facility, 600 hours of supervised psychotherapy in an outpatient setting, and at least 600 hours of theoretical seminars. Social workers may complete the specialist training for child and teenage clients. Similarly in Italy, {{the practice}} of psychotherapy is restricted to graduates in psychology or medicine who have completed four years of recognised specialist training.|$|E

2500|$|The {{introduction}} of the GIDC diagnosis into the DSM-III in 1980 was preceded by numerous US studies and treatments on feminine boys beginning {{as early as the}} 1950s and 1960s, most prominently by John Money and Richard Green at the Johns Hopkins Hospital and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). The prevention of transsexuality and / or homosexuality was explicitly stated as the goal of many of these studies: [...] "My focus will be what we might consider the prevention of transsexualism." [...] Bryant notes that feminine boys were not a new phenomenon at this time; however, the public emergence of adult transsexual women (male to female) in the 1950s was new and created a number of problems <b>for</b> <b>psychologists,</b> motivating some to undertake efforts at preventing their further emergence. Meyerowitz chronicles the deep disagreements which erupted between psychologists and physicians after Christine Jorgensen's public gender transition, namely over whether transsexuals should be permitted to align their bodies with their inner identities or whether their inner identities must be brought in line with their bodies. At the time, transsexual women were beginning to publish first-person narratives which highlighted their awareness of their femininity at a young age and Bryant notes that some clinicians and researchers thus turned their attention to feminine boys, constructing sissies as a new [...] "medicalized patient and research population." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{states that}} at the moment of the {{explosion}} he distinctly thought he was killed. He felt lifted off his feet and driven forcibly backward. It is a curious fact <b>for</b> <b>psychologists</b> that he thought clearly during his backward flight, and wondered whether he should hit the chemistry cupboard or the blackboard easel. His heels struck ground, and he staggered and fell heavily into a sitting position on something soft and firm. For a moment the concussion stunned him. He became aware at once of a vivid scent of singed hair, and he seemed to hear the voice of Lidgett asking for him. You will understand that for a time his mind was greatly confused.|$|E
60|$|Only a great {{force of}} {{prejudice}} can explain this acceptance, by psychologists, {{of one kind}} of marvellous tale on no evidence, and this rejection of another class of marvellous tale, when supported by first hand, signed and corroborated evidence, of living witnesses. I see only one escape <b>for</b> <b>psychologists</b> from this dilemma. Their marvellous tales are possible, though unvouched for, because they have always heard them and repeated them in lectures, and read and repeated them in books. Our marvellous tales are impossible, because the psychologists {{know that they are}} impossible, which means that they have not been familiar with them, from youth upwards, in lectures and manuals. But man has no right to have 'clear ideas of the possible and impossible,' like Faraday, a priori, except in the exact sciences. There are other instances of weak evidence which satisfies psychologists.|$|E

60|$|We now examine, {{at greater}} length, the psychical {{conditions}} in which, according to Mr. Tylor, contemporary savages differ from civilised men. Later we shall ask {{what may be}} said as to possible or presumable psychical differences between modern savages and the datelessly distant founders of the belief in souls. Mr. Tylor attributes to the lower races, and even to races high above their level, 'morbid ecstasy, brought on by meditation, fasting, narcotics, excitement, or disease.' Now, we may still 'meditate'--and how far the result is 'morbid' is a matter <b>for</b> <b>psychologists</b> and pathologists to determine. Fasting we do not practise voluntarily, nor would we easily accept evidence from an Englishman as to the veracity of voluntary fasting visions, like those of Cotton Mather. The visions of disease we should set aside, as a rule, with those of 'excitement,' produced, for instance, by 'devil-dances.' Narcotic and alcoholic visions are not in question.[19] For our purpose the induced trances of savages (in whatever way voluntarily brought on) are analogous to the modern induced hypnotic trance. Any supernormal acquisitions of knowledge in these induced conditions, among savages, would be {{on a par with}} similar alleged experiences of persons under hypnotism.|$|E
