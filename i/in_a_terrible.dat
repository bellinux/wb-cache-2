5|$|Despite the {{previous}} season's heroics, Primus {{was not used}} regularly {{in the early part}} of Portsmouth's first Premier League season. Harry Redknapp had ditched his 3–5–2 formation in favour of the more conventional 4–4–2 and partnered new record signing Dejan Stefanović with Arjan de Zeeuw. During December, Portsmouth were <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> run of form and Redknapp decided to bring one of his most reliable players back into his plans for the derby match with Southampton. In spite of a 3–0 loss, Primus retained his starting place for the remainder of the season.|$|E
25|$|The {{peculiar}} {{policy of}} the government in employing so weak and vacillating a person as General Miles to look after the uneasy Indians, has resulted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> loss of blood to our soldiers, and a battle which, at best, is a disgrace to the war department. There has been plenty of time for prompt and decisive measures, the employment of which would have prevented this disaster.|$|E
25|$|Very {{soon after}} the cost of getting the tithes removed had been met, the town {{was struck by the}} Eyemouth Disaster when, on 14 October 1881, most of the fishing fleet, some 20 boats and 129 men from the town, were lost <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> storm. Including victims from other coastal towns, a total of 189 men lost their lives. This is commemorated in the Eyemouth Tapestry housed in the Museum.|$|E

25|$|I {{remember}} {{one set of}} twins in particular: Guido and Ina, aged about four. One day, Mengele took them away. When they returned, they were <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> state: they had been sewn together, back to back, like Siamese twins. Their wounds were infected and oozing pus. They screamed day and night. Then their parents—I remember the mother's name was Stella—managed to get some morphine and they killed the children in order to end their suffering.|$|E
25|$|KSC {{finished}} {{fifth in}} their first season in the 2. Bundesliga after relegation, only two points behind third-place SSV Ulm 1846 which was promoted to the Bundesliga. However, a last place finish <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> 1999–2000 season played under dire financial circumstances dropped {{them down to the}} Regionalliga Süd (III). The club rebounded and on the strength of a first-place result in the Regionalliga made a prompt return to second division play. After four seasons of mediocre play that saw KSC narrowly avoid being sent further down, the team turned in a much-improved performance and earned a sixth-place result in 2005–06.|$|E
25|$|The {{three other}} {{survivors}} were many miles from a settlement and {{were forced to}} survive on shell fish and dead penguins cast up by the sea. Unable {{to keep up with}} the others due to injuries and exposure, Kilpatrick was too ill to continue. The two others made him as comfortable as possible and he was left behind. Simpson and Mitchell were eventually found seventeen days after the disaster <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> state, slowly making their way to the Cape Borda Lightstation. They were without food, having given all they possessed to Kilpatrick, but the remains of two dead penguins were tied around their necks.|$|E

25|$|I knew Germany was <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> crisis; I felt {{responsible}} for German music, {{and it was}} my task to survive this crisis, as much as I could. The concern that my art was misused for propaganda had to yield to the greater concern that German music be preserved, that music be given to the German people by its own musicians. These people, the compatriots of Bach and Beethoven, of Mozart and Schubert, still had to go on living under the control of a regime obsessed with total war. No one who did not live here himself in those days can possibly judge what it was like.|$|E

Joan, my wife, said you better go. He sounded really desperate. There wasn't much he could do for such a long time. Of course, when he did start to get brave, he was too old for going around and picking up what he might enjoy. He was the first of our mega stars; there seem to be mega stars everywhere now. In those days, living in such a Sleepy Hollow like Melbourne, he found his life terribly, terribly difficult. And you can understand in those days. The times have changed. It's almost compulsory to be homosexual now.|$|E
25|$|The abbey we {{now know}} as Vale Royal was founded by Prince Edward, the future Edward I, prior to his {{accession}} to the throne. In 1263 the prince was undertaking a sea voyage from France when his ship was caught <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> storm. He then made a vow that if he came safe to land he would found an abbey of unprecedented size and grandeur as a thanksgiving to God for saving him. Political problems and civil war meant that the vow could not be fulfilled immediately, but by 1266 negotiations were in hand {{for the establishment of}} a monastery of Cistercian monks in the secluded location of Darnhall in Cheshire. In August 1270, Edward granted a charter to his new abbey along with an endowment of lands and churches.|$|E

25|$|The city at {{this time}} was <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> confusion. Crowds of the people, on horse and foot, rushed in {{disorder}} on the streets, vainly searching for already deceased Khan. Bewildered residents hid {{in their homes and}} barns, women filled the air with frantic cries. Meanwhile, Russian soldiers with bayonets cleared the street, entirely covered with dead bodies, and seized the booty, finding on a horseback some precious gold jewelry. By noon the battle began to subside, and broke again only for a moment when, according to Tstsianov, the soldiers came upon five hundred men, who have entrenched themselves in the Juma mosque. At first they offered to surrender, but when one Armenian said that among them are some Lezgins, it was the signal for the death of all defenders, because the hatred of Lezghins was so strong among the Russian troops.|$|E
25|$|One morning, Harold finds Elsie {{sitting on}} a log in the woods, crying {{about the state of}} her life. He comforts her and, as he escorts her back to the hotel, they come across one of the Polish women. He wonders how much she saw. That evening, Elsie bursts into Harold's room. Her husband has arrived at the hotel {{unexpectedly}} and is <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> rage. At that moment, Philip Clayton runs in. He is carrying a spanner and screams at Elsie, accusing her of having an affair just as one of the Polish women had told him. He chases Elsie out of Harold's room and back to her own. Harold runs after him and is in time to see Elsie throw a paperweight at her husband in self-defence. He falls to the ground and Elsie begs Harold to leave them before he gets himself into trouble. Half an hour later, Mrs Rice joins Harold and tells him that Philip is dead, killed by the blow.|$|E
25|$|In 1979, Ronald Reagan {{visited the}} NORAD command base, Cheyenne Mountain Complex, {{where he was}} first {{introduced}} to the extensive tracking and detection systems extending throughout {{the world and into}} space. However, he was struck by their comments that while they could track the attack down to the individual targets, there was nothing one could do to stop it. Reagan felt that {{in the event of an}} attack this would place the president <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> position, having to choose between immediate counterattack or attempting to absorb the attack and then maintain an upper hand in the post-attack era. Shultz suggests that this feeling of helplessness, coupled with the defensive ideas proposed by Teller a decade earlier, combined to form the impetus of the SDI. In the fall of 1979, at Reagan's request, Lieutenant General Daniel O. Graham, the former head of the DIA, briefed Reagan on a concept he called the High Frontier, a missile shield composed of multi-layered ground- and space-based weapons that could track, intercept, and destroy ballistic missiles, which would theoretically be possible because of emerging technologies. It was designed to replace the MAD doctrine that Reagan and his aides described as a suicide pact. In September 1981, Graham formed a small, Virginia-based think tank called High Frontier to continue research on the missile shield. The Heritage Foundation provided High Frontier with space to conduct research, and Graham published a 1982 report entitled, “High Frontier: A New National Strategy” that examined in greater detail how the system would function.|$|E

500|$|Hartman wrote {{a number}} of {{screenplay}}s that were never produced. In 1986 he began writing a screenplay for a film titled Mr. Fix-It, and completed the final draft in 1991. Robert Zemeckis was signed to produce the film, with Gil Bettman hired to direct. Hartman called it [...] "a sort of a merger of horror and comedy, like Beetlejuice and Throw Momma From the Train", adding, [...] "It's an American nightmare about a family torn asunder. They live next to a toxic dump site, their water supply is poisoned, the mother and son go insane and try to murder each other, the father's face is torn off <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> disfiguring accident in the first act. It's heavy stuff, but it's got a good message and a positive, upbeat ending." [...] Zemeckis could not secure studio backing, however, and the project collapsed. Another movie idea involving Hartman's Groundlings character Chick Hazard, Private Eye also fell through.|$|E
500|$|On 13 April 1962, Kirchherr met {{the group}} at Hamburg Airport, telling them that Sutcliffe had died a few days before. Sutcliffe's mother flew to Hamburg with the Beatles' manager Brian Epstein, and {{returned}} to Liverpool with her son's body. Sutcliffe's father did not hear of his son's death for three weeks, as he was sailing to South America, although the family arranged for a padre to tell him when he docked in Buenos Aires. After Sutcliffe's death, Kirchherr {{wrote a letter to}} his mother, apologising for being too ill to attend his funeral in Liverpool and saying how much she and Lennon missed him: [...] "Oh, Mum, he (Lennon) is <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> mood now, he just can't believe that darling Stuart never comes back. [...] just crying his eyes out... John is marvellous to me, he says that he knows Stuart so much and he loves him so much that he can understand me." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{second part}} of the season, which begins with episode 11, takes place three months after the events of episode 10. On the {{structure}} of the season and shifting the focus between the two parts, Bell stated it was the intent to follow the format from season two, by tying [...] "a whole bunch of [...] but not all of them off by the midseason. And then we launch something exciting for the back half...the promise of more to come." [...] Whedon added that [...] "though we do break the season up, we feel that the season as a whole is one arc" [...] and so the series would explore the same themes in the second half, [...] "themes {{of what it means to}} be human and Inhuman. What does it mean to all these people when they have to live with their actions? Are they capable of the things their enemies are capable of?...What is the true nature of a person? Is everybody capable of everything if put <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> position? Or is there true good and a true evil?" [...] The second half of the season sees the introduction of the comics' right-wing hate group the Watchdogs, depicted as radicals wishing to [...] "eliminate the Inhumans", as well as a [...] "cure" [...] that can prevent terrigenisis in yet-to-transition Inhumans.|$|E

500|$|In July, Clark held {{another set}} of congressional {{hearings}} on the issue, attracting widespread media coverage. The hearings were tense with Clark, Kennedy, Javits, and testifying medical observers frequently clashing with Mississippi Senators John Stennis and James Eastland (both staunch segregationists), and Mississippi Board of Health officer A. L. Gray. Kennedy called child psychologist Robert Coles to testify on poverty's effect on children in the Mississippi Delta. One North Carolina doctor described [...] "an unwritten policy {{on the part of}} those who control the State to eliminate the Negro Mississippian either by driving him out of the State or starving him to death." [...] When Stennis and Eastland accused the doctor of committing libel against the welfare workers of their state, he invited them and other state officials to go see conditions for themselves, to which none accepted. On the second day of proceedings Secretary Freeman and Senator Javits got into a shouting match, with the senator arguing that the secretary should disregard local authorities' opinions, declare an emergency, and immediately supply food to the region. He remarked, [...] "We seem to be able to send airplanes to the Congo <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> hurry. We first heard of the desperation point of poor Mississippi Negroes 18 months agoand we are still hearing that there is starvation in Mississippi." [...] Kennedy openly expressed his frustration with Johnson administration officials' perceived inability to understand the extent of the Delta's problems and other bureaucratic complications, saying, [...] "It seems to me we are floundering around a great deal." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the fourth}} season opener, Rita and Dexter are living happily {{together}} in a suburban neighborhood with Astor, Cody, and new baby Harrison. In [...] "Remains to be Seen" [...] Dexter is <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> car accident, and Rita demands that he give her his keys {{so that she can}} drive him. In [...] "If I Had a Hammer," [...] friction begins to develop in the couple's relationship, and Dexter seeks guidance from Arthur Mitchell (John Lithgow), a family man who appears to balance his responsibilities with his secret life as the [...] "Trinity Killer". In [...] "Hungry Man," [...] Rita works hard to prepare Thanksgiving dinner. She shares a kiss with the next door neighbor, Elliot Larson (Rick Peters), when she asks if she can use his stove. Dexter arrives for an appointment with Rita for marriage counseling, but gets called to a crime scene as soon as he arrives. Soon after, Rita confesses that she and Elliot kissed, although Dexter tries to brush it off. Rita later admits that she felt hurt that he did not seem to care about her indiscretion. Dexter then punches Elliot and warns him to stay away from Rita, which reassures her that Dexter loves her. In the fourth season finale, Dexter asks her to go out of town so they can have a belated honeymoon; in reality, Dexter wants to keep her safe from Mitchell, who has learned his real identity and threatened to kill him and his family. After killing Mitchell, Dexter returns home and finds a message from Rita that she returned to pick up her identification for the flight. Dexter finds her dead in the bathtub [...] Mitchell's last victim. In the fifth season premiere [...] "My Bad", Dexter realizes, much to his own surprise, that he genuinely loved Rita and is devastated by her death. Julie Benz reprised her role as Rita as a special guest star in a flashback to her and Dexter's first date, and as a corpse.|$|E
500|$|A {{few years}} later, Griswold {{moved back to}} New York City, leaving his younger {{daughter}} {{in the care of}} the Myers family and his elder daughter, Emily, with relatives on her mother's side. He had by now earned the nickname [...] "Grand Turk", and in the summer of 1847 made plans to edit an anthology of poetry by American women. He believed that women were incapable of the same kind of [...] "intellectual" [...] poetry as men and believed they needed to be divided: [...] "The conditions of aesthetic ability in the two sexes are probably distinct, or even opposite", he wrote in his introduction. The selections he chose for The Female Poets of America were not necessarily the greatest examples of poetry but instead were chosen because they emphasized traditional morality and values. That same year, Griswold began working on what he considered [...] "the maximum opus of his life", an extensive biographical dictionary. Although he worked on it for several years and even advertised for it, it was never produced. He also helped Elizabeth F. Ellet publish her book Women of the American Revolution, and was angered when she did not acknowledge his assistance in the book. In July 1848, he visited poet Sarah Helen Whitman in Providence, Rhode Island, although he had been suffering with vertigo and exhaustion, rarely leaving his apartment at New York University, and was unable to write without taking opium. In autumn of that year, he had an epileptic fit, the first of many he would suffer for the remainder of his life. One fit caused him to fall out of a ferry in Brooklyn and nearly drown. He wrote to publisher James T. Fields: [...] "I am <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> condition, physically and mentally. I do not know what the end will be... I am exhaustedbetwixt life and deathand heaven and hell." [...] In 1849, he was further troubled when Charles Fenno Hoffman, with whom he had become good friends, was committed to an insane asylum.|$|E
