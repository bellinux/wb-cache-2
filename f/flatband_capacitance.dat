40|$|In {{this paper}} we have {{calculated}} the <b>flatband</b> <b>capacitance</b> (CFB) for high-k dielectric material hafnia oxide (HfO 2) as an insulator and silicon carbide (SiC) as a semiconductor material for metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) devices. We simulate the capacitance-voltage (C-V) {{characteristics of the}} MOS devices with ultrathin oxide using ATLAS, a commercially available TCAD tool from SILVACO. The tool has investigated the effect on C-V characteristics of different oxide thickness and doping concentration of SiO 2 and HfO 2 as insulators and Si and SiC as semiconductor based MOS devices. Excellent agreement was observed {{over a wide range}} of oxide thickness and substrate doping for the materials. The C-V characteristics of different polytype of SiC semiconductor also studied for n-type MOS devices. When you are citing the document, use the following link [URL]...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{outlines}} the design, principles of operation, and calibration of a five-IC network {{intended to give}} a rapid, precise, and automatic determination of the flatband voltage of MOS capacitors. The basic principle of measurement is to compare the analog output voltage of a capacitance meter - which is directly proportional to the capacitance being measured - with a preset or dialed-in voltage proportional to the calculated <b>flatband</b> <b>capacitance</b> {{by means of a}} comparator circuit. The bias to the MOS capacitor supplied through the capacitance meter is provided by a ramp voltage going from a negative toward a positive voltage level and vice versa. The network employs two monostable multivibrators for reading and recording the flatband voltage and for resetting the initial conditions and restarting the ramp. The flatband voltage can be held and read on a digital voltmeter...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} method to {{accurately}} determine the surface potential (ψS) based on depletion capacitance, and the interface state density (DIT) was evaluated based on the difference between quasi-static and theoretical capacitances in SiC metal-oxide-semiconductor capacitors (C−ψS method). We determined that this method gives accurate values for ψS and DIT. From the frequency dependence of the capacitance measured at up to 100 [*]MHz, a significant fast-interface-state response exists at 1 [*]MHz, which results in the overestimation of ψS if it is determined based on the <b>flatband</b> <b>capacitance</b> at 1 [*]MHz. The overestimation of ψS directly affects {{the accuracy of the}} energy level. DIT at a specific energy level is underestimated by the overestimation of ψS. Furthermore, the fast interface states that respond at 1 [*]MHz cannot be detected by the conventional high(1 [*]MHz) -low method. The C−ψS method can accurately determine the interface state density including the fast states without high-frequency measurements...|$|E
40|$|Understanding charged {{defects in}} high {{dielectric}} constant insulators {{is a critical}} challenge for advanced devices. We have formed thin Zr and Hf silicates by oxidation of thin metal films sputtered on clean Si(100) and studied the effect of oxidation time (15 to 300 s) and temperature (600 or 900 °C) on the <b>flatband</b> voltage using <b>capacitance</b> vs. voltage measurements. We find that the thermal budget during oxidation {{and the type of}} oxidizing agent (slow vs. fast) affect the amount of fixed charge in the film significantly. Oxidation of 0. 8 nm of Zr metal on Si at 600 °C in N 2 O for 15 s results in EOT= 1. 2 nm and a shift in the flatband voltage by ~- 0. 2 V indicating generation of positive fixed charge. Oxidation of similar films for 300 s result in EOT= 2. 8 nm and shift of the flatband voltage by ~- 0. 95 V. Hf films oxidized in N 2 O also show increased concentrations of fixed charge for longer oxidation times. By comparison, Si oxidized in the same environment does not show this extent of flatband voltage shift. A significantly reduced charge generation rate is observed for Hf oxidation under low O 2 partial pressure. Extended oxidations (up to 1 h) result in increased EOT and a slight decrease in the charged defect state density. Forming Gas Anneal (FGA) results in partial neutralization of the charge. FGA after the Al gate deposition also leads to significant decrease of the EOT (from 2. 7 to 2. 1 nm) indicating significant reaction of the film with the gate metal. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy for thin films indicates formation of Zr and Hf-silicates. However, for thick Hf films the low O 2 oxidation process results in less silicon incorporation in the film as compared to films oxidized in N 2 O. Results suggest that understanding oxidation mechanisms will be important in isolating and controlling fixed charge in high-k dielectrics...|$|R
40|$|Dc current-voltage (I-V) {{measurement}}, Hall measurement, Deep-level transient-spectroscopy (DLTS), and <b>flatband</b> <b>capacitance</b> measurement {{have been}} used to investigate electrical activation energies in diamond. However, the deviations still exist in the published activation energies obtained by these methods. In this paper, we report the first measurement of impedance on free-standing diamond films from 0. 1 Hz to 10 MHz up to 300 °C. A wide range of CVD materials have been investigated, but here we concentrate on 'black' diamond grown by MWPECVD. The Cole-Cole (Z′ via Z″) plots are well fitted to a RC parallel circuit model and the equivalent Resistance and Capacitance for the diamond films have been estimated using the Zview curve fitting. The results show only one single semicircle response at each temperature measured. It was found that the resistance decreases from 62 MΩ at room temperature to 4 KΩ at 300 °C, with an activation energy around 0. 15 eV. The equivalent capacitance is maintained at the level of 102 pF up to 300 °C suggesting that the diamond grain boundaries are dominating the conduction. At 400 °C, the impedance at low frequencies shows a linear tail, which can be explained that the AC polarization of diamond/Au interface occurs...|$|E
