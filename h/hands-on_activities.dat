5|$|Morse died in 1940, after 34 {{years as}} director, and several {{years went by}} without a strong local leadership. To ensure a sounder footing for the future, Coonley merged Avery Coonley with the National College of Education (NCE, {{formerly}} the Chicago Kindergarten College and now National-Louis University) in Evanston, Illinois, in 1943. The two institutions had close ties dating back to Morse's Kindergarten College days, and the arrangement {{took advantage of the}} NCE's financial and teaching resources while Avery Coonley provided a living laboratory for teacher training and educational research. Under NCE management, ACS continued to offer a curriculum that emphasized practical learning, outdoor education—including farming—and <b>hands-on</b> <b>activities</b> like automobile repair. German and French were added in 1949, with students beginning conversational French in first grade.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 1970s, the CTW's main non-television efforts {{changed from}} {{promotion}} {{to the development}} of educational materials for preschool settings. Early efforts included mobile viewing units that broadcast the show in the inner cities, in Appalachia, in Native American communities, and in migrant worker camps. During the early 1980s, the CTW created the Preschool Education Program (PEP), whose goal was to assist preschools, by combining television viewing, books, <b>hands-on</b> <b>activities,</b> and other media, in using the series as an educational resource. The Workshop also provided materials to non-English speaking children and adults. Starting during 2006, the Workshop expanded its programs by creating a series of PBS specials and DVDs largely concerning how military deployment affects the families of soldiers. Other efforts by the Workshop concerned families of prisoners, health and wellness, and safety.|$|E

5000|$|Mayer (2004) {{developed}} a literature review spanning fifty years and concluded [...] "The {{research in this}} brief review shows that the formula constructivism = <b>hands-on</b> <b>activity</b> is a formula for educational disaster." [...] His argument is that active learning is often suggested by those subscribing to this philosophy. In developing this instruction these educators produce materials that require learning to be behaviorally active and not be [...] "cognitively active". That is, although they are engaged in activity, {{they may not be}} learning (Sweller, 1988). Mayer recommends using guided discovery, a mix of direct instruction and <b>hands-on</b> <b>activity,</b> rather than pure discovery: [...] "In many ways, guided discovery appears to offer the best method for promoting constructivist learning." ...|$|R

25|$|Steiner's {{division}} {{of child development}} into three major stages {{is reflected in the}} schools' approach to early childhood education, which focuses on practical, <b>hands-on</b> <b>activities</b> and creative play; to elementary education, which focuses on developing artistic expression and social capacities; and to secondary education, which focuses on developing critical reasoning and empathic understanding. The overarching goal is to develop free, morally responsible, and integrated individuals equipped {{with a high degree of}} social competence. Qualitative assessments of student work are integrated into the daily life of the classroom, with quantitative testing playing a minimal role in primary education and standardized testing usually limited to that required for college entry. Individual teachers and schools have a great deal of autonomy in determining curriculum content, teaching methodology, and governance.|$|E

30|$|Despite my {{presence}} as the supporting teacher, {{the noise level}} from the students increased {{up to a point}} when Kenny struggled in giving instructions on the <b>hands-on</b> <b>activity.</b> My decision to step in and establish some form of ground rules using the “ 3 Ps” was to provide support for Kenny so that the <b>hands-on</b> <b>activity</b> could be carried out properly.
