40|$|Summary. The {{effect of}} rams on the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> oestrous {{behaviour}} was studied with oestrogen-treated spayed ewes. Different degrees of association between ewes and rams influenced the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> oestrus in two ways. First, the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> oestrus <b>measured</b> by teasing ewes with active rams once every 4 hr was shorter when ewes and rams remained together {{than when they}} were kept apart between observations. Continuous contact with rams appeared to limit the duration ofoestrus by inhibiting the neural mechanism controlling the expression of oestrous behaviour. Second, the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> oestrus <b>measured</b> by teasing ewes individually every 4 hr and keeping them with rams between observations was longer than that measured when ewes were kept in continuous uncontrolled association with rams. Regular teasing probably resulted in a longer <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> oestrus because it eliminated competition between ewes and rams and overcame the apparent unwillingness of rams to continue to mate with the same ewes for the full <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> their oestrus. The incidence, time <b>of</b> onset, and <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> oestrous behaviour all responded linearly to increasing doses ofoestrogen, but the slopes of these dose-response relationships were not affected by the different methods <b>of</b> <b>measuring</b> oestrous behaviour...|$|R

Emitted radiations from a focus volume <b>of</b> a <b>measuring</b> optical path <b>of</b> the arrangement are collected within a temporal measuring interval. The focus volume is moved over a surface or volume section of a sample by an optical scanner unit, where the surface or volume section corresponds to multiple of the focus volume.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a device for executing a method for spectroscopy analysis of a surface or volume section of a sample.

40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of wavelet packet transform (WPT) component energy {{with respect to}} local change in the system parameters is derived analytically based on the dynamic response sensitivity. A sensitivity-based method is then used for damage detection of structures. The WPT component energy sensitivity is classified into two types and their inclusion in the identification equation is discussed. The identification equation is solved using measured responses from two states of the structure with regularization in the solution. Both acceleration and strain responses have been used separately or in combination in the simulation study, and the {{sensitivity of}} acceleration with respect to local change of structural parameter is shown both analytically and numerically to be much better than that from strains.

Because of the diversity of the materials used in MEMS and the nature of their surfaces, it is necessary to use different optical measuring techniques. The microcomponents or complete MEMS' are automatically channelled into the measuring module, where they can be tested and examined. The module can be evacuated for the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>measuring</b> and testing processes. Simultaneously, an electrical wiring-up of the examinees, e. g. for function tests, is possible. The whole process, from the input <b>of</b> the <b>measuring</b> object over the measuring process up to the output, occurs automatically, likewise a corresponding 'superior/inferior' quality decision can be obtained. Besides 3 D-measurement techniques, a multispectral ellipsometer for the characterization of optical layers and the gray scale correlation used for the determination of surface shift can be used. The measuring module can be used as an independent solution, or can be bound in existing technological clusters. In the pertinent SMIF (standard mechanical interface) transport boxes, the measuring objects are protected from atmospheric contamination (cleanroom independence).

The study is exemplary and explorative in character. Conclusions regarding a population are not possible. In the data set examined the number of early integrations is considerable. About two thirds of the participants entering employment were integrated before the end <b>of</b> the <b>measure,</b> {{and there seems to be}} a trend of increasing permeability in particular among men in the period under examination (1992 to 2001). The chance of a participant completing the measure fully before entering employment is especially low for young foreign men with a low level of school education and vocational training and a short <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> unemployment before starting the measure. This applies even more if the integration occurred outside the firm providing the period of on-the-job training. Here the offer of further training apparently acts first and foremost as an invitation to move into regular employment. Conversely the chance of completing the training measure fully before entering employment is especially high for older German women with a high level of school education and vocational qualifications and a longer period of unemployment before commencing the measure, especially if they are integrated in the firm providing the training. The <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> the <b>measure</b> as a determinant of the search intensity loses significance as the permeability of the further training measures increases. In contrast, the risk of false investment in training measures gains significance if it is not ensured by means <b>of</b> an adequate <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> the training course that qualifications are imparted which permanently improve the matching efficiency, increase the competitive pressure on insiders and raise the productivity.
