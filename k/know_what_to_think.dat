5|$|Adaptation {{had been}} in {{development}} {{as far back as}} 1994. Jonathan Demme brought the project to Columbia Pictures with Kaufman writing the script. Kaufman experienced writer's block and did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of The Orchid Thief. Finally he wrote a script based on his experience of adapting the book into a screenplay. Jonze signed to direct, and filming was finished in June 2001. Though the film is billed as an adaptation of The Orchid Thief, its primary narrative focus is Charlie Kaufman's struggle to adapt The Orchid Thief into a film, while dramatizing the events of the book in parallel. Adaptation also adds a number of fictitious elements, including Kaufman's twin brother (also credited as a writer for the film) and a romance between Orlean and Laroche, and culminates in completely invented events including fictional versions of Orlean and Laroche three years after the events related in The Orchid Thief.|$|E
500|$|Wilson {{was brought}} on board to {{continue}} rewriting work with McDowell, though Burton replaced McDowell and Wilson with Skaaren due to creative differences. Burton's original choice for Betelgeuse was Sammy Davis, Jr., but Geffen suggested Keaton. Burton was unfamiliar with Keaton's work, but was quickly convinced. Burton cast Ryder upon seeing her in Lucas. O'Hara quickly signed on, while Burton claimed {{it took a}} lot of time to convince other cast members to sign, as [...] "they didn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of the weird script." ...|$|E
2500|$|Darwin replied on 3 May: [...] "With {{respect to}} your {{suggestion}} of a sketch of my view; I hardly <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>think,</b> but will reflect on it; but it goes against my prejudices. To give a fair sketch would be absolutely impossible, for every proposition requires such an array of facts. If I were to do anything it could only refer to the main agency of change, selection,—& perhaps point out a {{very few of the}} leading features which countenance such a view, & some few of the main difficulties. But I do not know what to think: I rather hate the idea of writing for priority, yet I certainly shd be vexed if any one were to publish my doctrines before me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "However, I <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of it, [...] When I beheld {{you in your}} jesting way, [...] Flitting and {{whispering}} {{round about}} the spit [...] Where Belial, upon duty for the day[hg], [...] With Fox's lard was basting William Pitt, [...] His pupil; I <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>think,</b> I say: [...] That fellow even in Hell breeds farther ills; [...] I'll have him gagged--'twas {{one of his own}} Bills[537].|$|R
60|$|About the {{operator}} {{on the other}} side, Harry scarcely <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>think.</b> If it were necessary to hire any one, that would eat terribly into the profits.|$|R
6000|$|... “I {{should have}} <b>known</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of them,” said Bertie; “if {{you choose to}} excite {{yourself}} over other people’s correspondence it’s your own fault. Anyhow, I’m going for a doctor.” ...|$|R
60|$|Miss Mackenzie {{said that}} she really didn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>think.</b>|$|E
60|$|Jane did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> {{on such a}} subject, and so she did not reply.|$|E
6000|$|The {{father did}} not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>think,</b> and told one of his friends, who said, 'To-morrow we had better keep watch ourselves.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish I <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of {{your real}} bona fide belief {{respecting}} these documents," [...] said Jekyl, {{not a little}} puzzled by the steady and unembarrassed air of his friend.|$|R
6000|$|... "Just so;" [...] {{and then}} he took up the two letters and read them again, while Staveley still sat on {{the foot of the}} bed. [...] "I wish I <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about it," [...] said Felix.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Very; exquisite, really; the {{blending}} of the tones is so perfect. I wish I <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about these things. I can't {{make up my}} mind about them. Sometimes I think it's all right to make them and buy them; sometimes I think it's all wrong.' ...|$|R
60|$|Somewhat amused, I {{replied that}} I did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>think,</b> but I would try if he wished {{me to do}} so.|$|E
6000|$|... "One {{does not}} <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>think,</b> Razumov. You must have bitten {{something}} bitter in your cradle." [...] Razumov {{gave her a}} sidelong glance.|$|E
60|$|They {{knocked down}} half the wall, and never found {{so much as}} a four- penny bit. My {{brother-in-law}} did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>think.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "You ought <b>to</b> have <b>known</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>think.</b> There; let me go,"--for {{now he had}} got his arm {{round her}} waist. [...] "You don't care for me a bit. I know you don't. It would be {{all the same to}} you whom I married;--or whether I died." ...|$|R
60|$|Tom sauntered away. Wilson felt a {{good deal}} depressed. He hardly <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>think.</b> He was loath to {{withdraw}} his faith from the twins, and was resolved {{not to do it}} on the present indecisive evidence; but--well, he would think, and then decide how to act.|$|R
60|$|Thomas. We {{shall be}} driven to great extremities. I <b>know</b> not <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of it.|$|R
6000|$|THE FEMALE FIGURE. How can {{you expect}} my husband to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of you if you give him his breakfast without his paper? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>think,</b> to {{tell the}} truth. We have fallen in {{with all kinds of}} evil {{characters}} since we began this trip." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>think.</b> But I'm {{going to}} take uncle's advice and count every man an enemy until he proves himself a friend." ...|$|E
60|$|This {{event at}} last took place. She saw her--at the window--mount the steps, {{and she went}} to await her in the hall, where she pounced upon her as soon as she had entered the house, and drew her into the parlour, closing the door with solemnity. Catherine was flushed, and her eye was bright. Mrs. Penniman hardly <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>think.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The battle {{lasted for}} a long time. New demons succeeded the others however; the victory {{remained}} with the personages in the boat, who were taken back to the landing of the Piazzetta. The gondolier scarcely <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of their strange conduct; until, as {{they were about to}} separate, the oldest of the group, suddenly causing his nimbus to shine out again, said to the gondolier: ...|$|R
60|$|But dazed {{as she was}} {{she kept}} her self-command, at least she kept silence and sat in sombre, almost sullen dejection amid it all. Mrs. Thatcher hardly <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of her, but the Doctor comprehended her mood better for he had passed through such {{experiences}} himself. He talked to her {{for a few minutes}} about her plans, and then they went out to dinner.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is a {{very curious}} {{communication}}," [...] he said thoughtfully, [...] "a very curious communication indeed. I do not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Lander did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>think,</b> and she asked, [...] "But didn't {{it almost}} perish you, stayin' {{through the winter}} in an {{unfinished}} house?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>think.</b> One {{thing is}} sure, {{something}} very {{much out of}} the way has happened, or Dick wouldn't have sent that telegram." ...|$|E
6000|$|Lord Valleys had {{recently}} been told of the nursing episode, and had received the news with the dubious air of one hearing something about an eccentric person, which, heard about anyone else, could have had but one significance. If Eustace had been a normal young man his father would have shrugged his shoulder's, and thought: [...] "Oh, well! There it is!" [...] As it was, he had literally not <b>known</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>think.</b>|$|R
60|$|Fuller hardly <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of his companion's credulity. At {{times he}} {{appeared}} to defer to the marvelous and the traditions of his tribe; then, again, the lights of education would seem to gleam upon the darkness of his superstition, and leave him a man of inductive reason. As for himself, he was probably not altogether {{as much of the}} last as his pride of race would have led him to hope.|$|R
60|$|He sat on {{the east}} gate of the dairy-yard, and <b>knew</b> not <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of himself. Feeling had indeed smothered {{judgement}} that day.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, deacon, railly I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> now: there's my Joe, he's took {{and been}} a courting that 'ere Susan," [...] said Uncle Jaw.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Marian, not a word. Tell me, pray tell me, {{what you}} think about it. I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>think,</b> or what to do next." ...|$|E
60|$|I made no answer, for {{in truth}} I did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>think,</b> also I feared lest further rash admissions should be {{followed}} by swift vengeance.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{must allow}} for his impatience," [...] Mrs. Touchett answered. Ralph <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of his father's impatience; but, making no rejoinder, he offered his mother his arm. This {{put it in}} his power, as they descended together, to stop her a moment on the middle landing of the {{staircase}}--the broad, low, wide-armed staircase of time-blackened oak {{which was one of the}} most striking features of Gardencourt. [...] "You've no plan of marrying her?" [...] he smiled.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>know</b> not <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of this matter; but I {{believe a}} {{perfectly}} natural solution of this seeming mystery {{will one day}} be arrived at." ...|$|R
5000|$|Charlie: Charlie never <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about Edgar. She {{fails to}} {{recognize}} his character. She likes Edgar, {{but not his}} lifestyle. She is a [...] "strong" [...] woman, who cannot easily be abused or be played by others (even by her fiancé, Dieter). Sometimes the reader is {{led to believe that}} Charlie has the desire to be unfaithful to Dieter with Edgar, but she only kisses Edgar. Being attractive, intelligent and friendly, but also ignorant, argumentative and somewhat arrogant, she’s an ambivalent figure.|$|R
