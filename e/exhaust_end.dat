50|$|A {{parking orbit}} is a {{temporary}} orbit used during the launch of a satellite or other space probe. A launch vehicle boosts into the parking orbit, then coasts for a while, then fires again to enter the final desired trajectory.

25|$|However, as speeds rise, the {{resultant}} exhaust speed goes down, {{and the overall}} vehicle energetic efficiency rises, reaching a peak of around 100% of the engine efficiency when the vehicle is travelling exactly {{at the same speed}} that the exhaust is emitted. In this case the exhaust would ideally stop dead in space behind the moving vehicle, taking away zero energy, and from conservation of energy, all the energy would end up in the vehicle. The efficiency then drops off again at even higher speeds as the <b>exhaust</b> <b>ends</b> up travelling forwards- trailing behind the vehicle.|$|R

50|$|The kiln {{connects with}} a {{material}} exit hood {{at the lower}} end and to ducts for waste gases. This requires gas-tight seals {{at either end of the}} kiln. The exhaust gas may go to waste, or may enter a preheater which further exchanges heat with the entering feed. The gases must be drawn through the kiln, and the preheater if fitted, by a fan situated at the <b>exhaust</b> <b>end.</b> In preheater installations which may have a high pressure-drop, a lot of fan power may be needed, and the fan is often then largest drive in the kiln system. Exhaust gases contain dust and there may be undesirable constituents such as sulfur dioxide or hydrogen chloride.

A high tip speed transonic fan rotor was scaled directly to 20. 0 inches (0. 508 m) from a 28. 74 -inch (0. 73 -m) diameter rotor. A new stator {{was designed and}} fabricated for the fan and incorporated with a test rig housing and adapter hardware for installation in the NASA-LeRC Jet Noise Facility for acoustic evaluation. The stator was designed to allow mounting at three axial locations, and the fan, housing, and adapters are reversible so that either the inlet or the <b>exhaust</b> <b>ends</b> of the assembly face the open room of the test facility.

50|$|It uses a {{solution}} of 2 fluids with different boiling points for its working fluid. Since the solution boils over a range of temperatures as in distillation, more of the heat can be extracted from the source than with a pure working fluid.

50|$|Cable jetting is {{the process}} of blowing a cable through a duct while {{simultaneously}} pushing the cable into the duct. Compressed air is injected at the duct inlet and flows through the duct and along the cable at high speed. (Preferably, no suction pig is used at the cable head.) The high speed air propels the cable due to drag forces and pressure drop. The friction of the cable against the duct is reduced by the distributed airflow, and large forces that would generate high friction are avoided. Because of the expanding airflow, the air propelling forces are relatively small at the cable inlet and large at the air <b>exhaust</b> <b>end</b> of the duct. To compensate for this, an additional pushing force is applied to the cable by the jetting equipment. The pushing force, acting mainly near the cable inlet, combined with the airflow propelling forces, increases the maximum jetting distance considerably. Special lubricants have been developed for cable jetting to further reduce friction.|$|E

40|$|The {{multi-stage}} Collins-type cryocooler uses {{a floating}} piston {{design for the}} working fluid expansion in each stage. The piston floats between a cold volume, where the working fluid is expanded, and a warm volume. The piston's motion is controlled by opening and closing valves connecting several reservoirs at various pressures to the warm volume. Ideally, these pressures should be distributed between {{the high and low}} system pressure to gain good control of the piston motion. In past prototypes, helium flow through the piston-cylinder gap resulted in a loss of pressure in the reservoirs causing the piston to become immobile. A more complex control algorithm is required to maintain a net zero helium flow through this gap to allow for steady expander operation. A numerical quasi-steady thermodynamic model is developed for the piston cycle. The model determines the steady state pressure distribution of the reservoirs for an ideal expander with no helium flow through the piston-cylinder gap. This pressure distribution is dependent on the total mass of helium in pressure reservoirs as well as the points at which the warm helium intake as well as the cold helium <b>exhaust</b> <b>end.</b> The pressures in the pressure reservoirs show varyin...|$|E
40|$|As {{part of the}} Diesel Emissions Evaluation Program (DEEP) consortium, Noranda Inc. has {{undertaken}} a field project to evaluate the overall performance of the latest diesel particulate filter technology (DPF) at its Brunswick Mine in Bathurst, New Brunswick. Performance of the filtration systems is evaluated {{with respect to their}} ability to reduce tailpipe emissions and concentrations of diesel particulate matter (DPM) and noxious gases in mine air, efficiency of filter regeneration process, maintenance requirements, reliability, and acceptance. Four different particulate filter systems deployed on heavy production vehicles are subjected to an 18 -month field evaluation. Over the evaluation period the vehicles will have accumulated approximately 4000 operating hours in production. This paper presents the results of testing conducted mid way through the 18 -month field trials. The 400 - meter section of the mine drift at 525 - 5 sub level, hereinafter referred to as the "isolated zone" was isolated between intake and exhaust fan systems and sealed with bulkheads against leakage. The isolated zone was ventilated at the rate required per CSA Standards and issued by CANMET for the engines tested. Four vehicles, two load-haul-dumps (LHDs) and two trucks, retrofitted with particulate filter systems were tested along with a new identical model LHD and truck equipped with exhaust systems consisting of a catalytic converter (DOC) and muffler. The test vehicles were operated individually inside the isolated zone for approximately 4 hours over simulated production duty cycles. Measurements of ambient concentrations of particulate matter, tailpipe emissions, and engine parameters were performed for each of the tested vehicles. The DPM samples for carbon were collected at the most up- stream end of the isolated zone, at the vehicle next to the operator, and at the most downstream or <b>exhaust</b> <b>end</b> of the isolated zone. The DPM samples were analyzed for total (organic and elemental) carbon using NIOSH Analytical Method 5040. Ambient concentrations of particulate matter at the <b>exhaust</b> <b>end</b> of the zone were also measured using Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS), and real time PAH monitor (PAS 2000). Efficiency of the filters was also evaluated on a basis of tailpipe measurements performed using raw exhaust instruments the NanoMet and the UGAS. In addition, relevant engine parameters were obtained using Detroit Diesel Diagnostic Link (DDDL) and from exhaust backpressure and temperature measurements. Results from the tests proved conclusively that diesel particulate filters can significantly reduce the concentrations of air- borne DPM, but not without careful monitoring of both ambient and tailpipe emissions and not without careful attention with respect to maintaining the integrity of the DPF systems...|$|E
40|$|PaperPg. 19 - 27. This paper {{presents}} {{the highlights of}} a complete rotor dynamics analysis and bearing optimization study that was performed on a 3800 HP multistage steam turbine. This unit is coupled to a three stage, poster-type, centrifugal air compressor with two high speed pinion shafts engaging a common bull gear. The turbine drives the lower speed pinion at a maximum speed of 10, 500 rpm. Located {{at the other end}} of this same pinion is the first stage impeller wheel. The second and third stages are mounted on the higher speed pinion, rotating at a maximum speed of 13, 600 rpm. The maximum speed of the bull gear is 1, 940 rpm. All the existing compressor bearings are the four-lobe type. The original turbine rotor consists of three stages and has a 41. 34 inch bearing span. The bearings are lemon-bore type with journal diameters of 3. 0 and 4. 0 inches on the inlet and exhaust ends, respectively. This turbine has exhibited subsynchronous vibration, at approximately half rotational speed, during field testing. The half frequency vibration prevented operation above 9, 400 rpm because a shaft resonance was excited and vibration levels became prohibitively high. The analysis of the existing rotor-bearing system predicts that the turbine operates close to the second critical speed and that the rotor is stable under normal load conditions. However, the rotor becomes unstable when the lemon-bore bearings are unloaded. There are two major sources of bearing load in addition to gravity. These loads are misalignment and gear mesh loading. Misalignment can result from differential thermal growth of the turbine and compressor cases and supports. If the coupling does not act as an ideal joint, this differential growth can impose external loads at the bearings. The bearing load resulting from the gear mesh is a reaction to the torque transmission at the gear interface. For example, the turbine driver rotates in the counter-clockwise direction. Therefore, the low speed pinion gear tends to climb up the bull gear, which causes an upward external load on the pinion bearings. As in the case of misalignment, if the coupling is not ideal, the turbine bearings can also be affected by these gear mesh reaction loads. This analysis is primarily concerned with the effect of these external loads that oppose gravity and cause degrees of net bearing unloading because the unloading causes rotor instability. The rotor is unstable with 75 pounds unloading at each bearing or 110 pounds unloading at the <b>exhaust</b> <b>end</b> bearing alone (with a normal gravity load at the inlet end bearing). As a solution to the problem, a new set of bearings was designed to stabilize the rotor and move the peak response speeds away from the operating speed range. The new bearings are five-shoe-tilt-pad bearings with load-between-pad orientation. The inlet end bearing has a 3. 0 inch diameter bore with length-to-diameter ratio of 1. 0; and preload of 0. 8. The <b>exhaust</b> <b>end</b> bearing has a 3. 995 inch diameter bore with a length-to-diameter ratio of 0. 4 and preload of 0. 0. With the new tilt-pad bearing design there are no response peaks in the normal operating speed range and the system log decrement is 2. 8 times higher than with the existing system, under normal load conditions. The log decrement for the tilt-pad bearings is + 0. 52 for an unloading of 100 pounds. Therefore, the tilt-pads provide a stable rotor support that is not sensitive to unloading...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a novel Stagnation Point Reverse Flow (SPRF) combustor concept that can burn gaseous or liquid fuels in premixed or non-premixed modes of combustion with ultra low NOx emissions. The combustor {{consists of a}} tube with open and closed ends. Contrary to most combustors, the reactants and products enter and leave this combustor at the same (open) end. In the investigated configuration, the reactants are injected along the combustor center line, moving towards the closed end, where the flow velocity must be zero. This creates a low velocity region towards the closed end of the combustor that helps stabilize the combustion process. Furthermore, {{the presence of a}} closed end forces the generated combustion products and burning gas pockets to reverse their flow direction and move towards the open (<b>exhaust)</b> <b>end</b> of the combustor. Thus, a portion of the hot products, laden with radicals, are entrained back into the incoming reactants to form a more chemically reactive mixture. The presence of radicals in the mixture lowers its ignition temperature and, thus, the lean blowout limit of the combustor. Thus, the SPRF combustor’s geometry produces a combination of stagnation and reverse flow entrainment that allows this combustor to operate stably at very low temperatures with ultra low NOx emission in the 1 ppm range and below. It is also shown that these low NOx emissions can be attained with premixed or non-premixed modes of combustion. Finally, it is shown that the developed combustor can operate with high combustion intensities, in the 30 - 40 MW/m 3 range at atmospheric pressure, without experiencing combustion instabilities.

Upon receiving all the pieces of equipment, the research team first {{spent a great deal of}} time in calibration of various instruments and then began assembling the pieces for the experimental work. The use of Swage-lock fittings helped in arresting the gas leaks fairly easily. The entire assembly consisted of teflon tube connections (a) from gas cylinders to the flow meters, manifold and buffer vessel, (b) from buffer vessel to the inlet of the reactor enclosed in the middle, by a furnace, (c) from the <b>exhaust</b> <b>end</b> of the reactor to the NOx analyzer via gas dryer and (d) from the analyzer to the vent. Details of the experimental setup are given in the subsequent section. Once the setup was checked for leaks and the leaks were arrested, the facility was operational.

The flow rates for various gases were calculated for five reburning stoichiometric ratios and the experiments were conducted for three different reaction temperatures. The results are presented later on in this report. These results indicate favorable reduction of NO by reburning with methane, consistent with their computer projections, and hence, present a good base for investigating further on nitric oxide reburning with other fuels as well. Experiments on nitric oxide reburning with (1) a combination of methane and acetylene, and (2) a combination of methane and ammonia, will be considered in the next quarter.

40|$|LecturePg. 123 - 132 Two similar large steam {{turbines}} in an ethylene plant are profiled. One drives the cracked gas compressor train {{and the other}} drives the propylene refrigeration compressor. The two machines are similar and this paper concentrates on the turbine driving the cracked gas compressors. Both turbines {{had a history of}} high vibration, short bearing life, and unusual sensitivity to thermal changes and imbalance due to operation near the second critical speed. In addition, numerous blade failures had occurred. When additional turbine performance was required, a complete review of the entire turbine including the blade designs, rotordynarnics, and governor operation was commissioned. The performance upgrade included new blading, disks, seals, and other changes to the steam path. A turning gear was added for slow-roll operation to relieve thermal effects and rotor bow. A technique was developed for mounting the turbine disks on the rotor to minimize axial disk runout and local couple imbalances. The high bearing temperatures and high vibration issues were addressed with changes in shaft and bearing designs. A submerged arc welding process increased the governor end journal diameter from 51 / 4 inches to 7 inches. A rotordynamic optimization analysis resulted in replacing the tilting pad bearing on the governor end with an offset-half lobed journal bearing. The tilting pad bearings on the <b>exhaust</b> <b>end</b> of the turbines were retained but redesigned for optimum performance. Interchangeability of bearings between the two machines was maintained. These shaft and bearing changes resulted in a significant reduction in babbitt temperature, shaft vibration, and imbalance sensitivity as well as control of the second critical speed. The interaction of the rotor with the foundation substructure was found to be significant, and its inclusion in the analysis was required to properly design the optimized bearings. The blade design changes and steam path changes produced a more reliable design and greater than the required extra power. The addition of a turning gear drive has eliminated the thermal bow problems. A new electronic governor system has eliminated the wear associated with the original hydraulic governor. Both turbines are now operating very smoothly at the capacity of the production facility...|$|E
