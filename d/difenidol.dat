40|$|R) -Hexahydro-difenidol has {{a higher}} {{affinity}} for M_ 1 receptors in NB-OK 1 cells, pancreas M_ 3 and striatum M_ 4 receptors (pKi 7. 9 to 8. 3) than for cardiac M 2 receptors (pKi 7. 0). (8) -Hexahydro-difenidol, by contrast, is nonselective (pKi 5. 8 to 6. 1). Our goal {{in the present study}} was to evaluate the importance ofthe hydrophobic phenyl, and cyclohexyl rings of hexahydro-difenidol for the stereoselectivity and reeeptor selectivity of hexahydro-difenidol binding to the four muscarinic receptors. Our results indieated that replacement of the phenyl ring of hexahydro-difenidol by a cyclohexyl group < dicyclidol) and ofthe cyclohexyl ring by a phenyl moiety < <b>difenidol)</b> indueed a !arge (4 - to 80 -fold) decrease in binding affinity for all musearlnie receptors. <b>Difenidol</b> had a signifieant preference for M_ 1, M_ 3, and M_ 4 over M_ 2 receptors; dicyclidol, by eontrast, had a greater affinity for M_ 1 and M_ 4 than for M_ 2 and M_ 3 receptors. The binding free energy deerease due to replacement ofthe phenyl and the cyelohexyl groups of(R) -hexahydro-difenidol by, respectively, a eyclohexyl and a phenyl moiety was almostadditive in the ease of M_ 4 (striatum) binding sites. In the ease ofthe cardiac M_ 2, pancreatic M_ 3, or NB-OK 1 M_ 1 receptors the respective binding free energies were not eompletely additive. These results suggest that the four (R) -hexahydro-difenidol "binding moieties" (phenyl, cyclohexyl, hydroxy, and protonated amino group) cannot simultaneously form optimal interaetions with the M_ 1, M_ 2, and M_ 3 muscarinic receptors. When eaeh of the hydrophobic groups is modified, the position of the whole molecule, relative to the four subsites, was changed to allow an optimal overall interaction with the musearlnie receptor...|$|E
40|$|In {{an attempt}} to assess the {{structural}} requirements of hexahydro-sila-difenidol for potency and selectivity, a series of analogues modified in the amino group and the phenyl ring were investigated for their affinity to muscarinic M 1 - (rabbit vas deferens), Mr (guinea-pig atria) and Mr (guinea-pig ileum) receptors. All compounds were competitive antagonists in the three tissues. Their affinities to the three muscarinic receptor subtypes differed by more than two orders of magnitude and the observed receptor selectivities were not associated with high affinity. The pyrrolidino and hexamethyleneimino analogues, compounds substituted in the phenylring with a methoxy group or a chlorine atom as weil as p-fluoro-hexahydro-difenidol displayed the same affinity profile as the parent compound, hexahydro-sila-difenidol: M 1 = M 3 > M 2 • A different selectivity patternwas observed for p-fluoro-hexahydro-sila-difenidol: M 3 > M 1 > M 2 • This compound exhibited its highest affinity for M 3 -receptors in guinea-pig ileum (pA 2 = 7. 84), intermediate affinity for M 1 -receptors in rabbit vas deferens (pA 2 = 6. 68) and lowest affinity for the Mrreceptors in guinea-pig atria (pA 2 = 6. 01). This receptor selectivity profile of p-fluoro-hexahydro-sila-difenidol was confirmed in ganglia (M 1), atria (M 2) and ileum (M 3) of the rat. Furthermore, dose ratios obtained with either pirenzepine (Mt) or hexahydrosila- <b>difenidol</b> (M 2 and M 3) and the p-fluoro analogue used in combination suggested that the antagonism was additive, implying mutual competition with a single population of muscarinic receptor subtypes. These results indicate that p-fluoro-hexahydro-sila-difenidol represents a valuable tool for characterization of muscarinic receptor subtypes...|$|E
