5|$|A church {{close to}} the {{refinery}} {{was used as a}} point for families seeking information on relatives employed at the facility. So many people turned up that police requested that each family send only one representative. At the close of the day of the explosion, six people were missing, with no confirmed deaths. Overnight, several <b>deep-seated</b> fires were uncovered and firefighting continued the next day.|$|E
5|$|As {{is common}} in Northern Ireland, most of the schools in Lurgan are {{attended}} mainly by children from one or other of the two main ethno-religious blocs, reflecting the existence of <b>deep-seated</b> ethnic, sectarian and political divisions in society. Some schools are in the Catholic 'maintained' sector, i.e. maintained by the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools, and others are controlled directly by the state. Directly-controlled state schools generally have a predominantly Protestant intake.|$|E
5|$|Devil May Care is a James Bond {{continuation}} novel {{written by}} Sebastian Faulks. It {{was published in}} the UK by Penguin Books on 28 May 2008, the 100th anniversary of the birth of Ian Fleming, the creator of Bond. The story centres on Bond's investigation into Dr Julius Gorner, a megalomaniac chemist with a <b>deep-seated</b> hatred of England.|$|E
5|$|Dodd also {{understood}} the <b>deep-seated</b> rivalry with the University of Georgia. His teams won 8 {{games in a}} row over the Bulldogs from 1946–1954 outscoring the Bulldogs 176–39 during the winning streak. This 8–game winning streak against Georgia remains the longest winning streak by either team in the series. Dodd would finish his career with a 12–9 record against the Bulldogs.|$|E
5|$|From the 9th century, {{waves of}} Viking raiders plundered Irish monasteries and towns. These raids {{added to a}} pattern of raiding and endemic warfare that was already <b>deep-seated</b> in Ireland. The Vikings also were {{involved}} in establishing {{most of the major}} coastal settlements in Ireland: Dublin, Limerick, Cork, Wexford, Waterford, as well as other smaller settlements.|$|E
5|$|Moscow {{had built}} up a {{military}} that consumed as much as 25percent of the Soviet Union's gross national product {{at the expense of}} consumer goods and investment in civilian sectors. Soviet spending on the arms race and other Cold War commitments both caused and exacerbated <b>deep-seated</b> structural problems in the Soviet system, which saw at least a decade of economic stagnation during the late Brezhnev years.|$|E
5|$|Suslov was {{becoming}} progressively {{more critical of}} Khrushchev's policies, his political intransigence, and his campaign to eliminate {{what was left of}} the old Stalinist guard. There were also <b>deep-seated</b> divergences in foreign and domestic policy between Suslov and Khrushchev. Suslov opposed the idea of improving Soviet Union–United States relations, and was against Khrushchev's attempts at rapprochement with Yugoslavia. Domestically, Suslov opposed Khrushchev's policy of de-Stalinisation and his economic decentralisation scheme.|$|E
5|$|Years earlier, Angier and Borden work as shills for Milton the Magician, {{alongside}} Cutter {{and assistant}} Julia, Angier's wife. Milton's famous trick is the water tank trick, where Julia is bound in ropes and dropped {{in a water}} tank from which she frees herself and escapes. Borden, with Julia's consent, ties her hands with a riskier slip knot. Julia fails to slip the knot and drowns, devastating Angier and fueling his <b>deep-seated</b> grudge against Borden.|$|E
5|$|Another {{hypothesis}} is that the Anahim hotspot is supplied by a miniplume. These mantle plumes have their roots in the upper mantle but they may later originate from the lower mantle. Arguments for an Anahim miniplume are centred {{on the existence of}} two small dike swarms at the western (hence oldest) end of the Anahim Volcanic Belt. This assumption is in turn based on the notion that giant dike swarms mark the arrival of <b>deep-seated</b> mantle plumes.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the 1973 oil crisis, {{combined}} with the growing influence of Third World alignments such as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and the Non-Aligned Movement, less-powerful countries had more room to assert their independence and often showed themselves resistant to pressure from either superpower. Meanwhile, Moscow was forced to turn its attention inward to deal with the Soviet Union's <b>deep-seated</b> domestic economic problems. During this period, Soviet leaders such as Leonid Brezhnev and Alexei Kosygin embraced the notion of détente.|$|E
5|$|He {{was known}} for the {{following}} eponyms: Murphy’s button (a mechanical device used for intestinal anastomosis), Murphy’s punch (a punch tenderness at the costo-vertebral angle in cases of perinephric abscess), Murphy's sign (a sign of inflammation of the gallbladder), Murphy’s test (a test for <b>deep-seated</b> tenderness and muscular rigidity in cases of perinephric abscess), Murphy drip for administration of fluids by proctoclysis in patients with peritonitis, and Murphy-Lane bone skid (a common commercial steel instrument used for femoral head procedures).|$|E
5|$|Jay Baruchel as Kevin Sandusky: A novice actor, he is {{the only}} cast member to have read the script and book and {{attended}} the assigned boot camp prior to the film. Sandusky plays a young soldier named Brooklyn in the film-within-a-film. Brooklyn and Sandusky each occupy the position of straight man in character in the film-within-a-film and its cast, being the only actor without an internal conflict or <b>deep-seated</b> insecurity. He often serves as a mediator when tensions between the cast get high.|$|E
25|$|Chondroid lipomas are <b>deep-seated,</b> firm, yellow tumors that {{characteristically}} {{occur on}} the legs of women.|$|E
25|$|Poland: The number {{remained}} unchanged, with 48 {{percent of}} the population showing <b>deep-seated</b> antisemitic attitudes.|$|E
25|$|As the {{governor}} of the province was removed and replaced by Avni Bey, a man who held a <b>deep-seated</b> hatred for Armenians, orders were given on October 24, 1895, by Ottoman authorities to use the troops to begin razing several of the Armenians villages near Zeitun.|$|E
25|$|The {{source of}} metal and sulfur in VMS {{deposits}} {{is a combination of}} incompatible elements which are leached from the volcanic pile in the sub-seafloor hydrothermal alteration zone by hydrothermal circulation. Hydrothermal circulation is generally considered to be driven via heat in the crust often related to <b>deep-seated</b> gabbro intrusions.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{most major}} college rivalries, the Carolina–Clemson rivalry {{did not start}} innocently and because of {{competitive}} collegiate sports. The <b>deep-seated</b> bitterness began between the two schools long before Clemson received its charter and became a college. The two institutions were founded eighty-eight years apart: South Carolina College in 1801 and Clemson Agricultural College in 1889.|$|E
25|$|Barrichello {{formerly}} {{held the}} fastest time by a Formula One driver around the Top Gear test track during the show's Star in a Reasonably Priced Car segment. His lap time of 1:44.3 put him ahead of The Stig by 0.1 seconds. This led to Jeremy Clarkson making frequent references to The Stig developing a <b>deep-seated</b> hatred of Barrichello.|$|E
25|$|Farris's close {{connection}} to conservative {{leaders such as}} Jerry Falwell of the Moral Majority, Pat Robertson of the Christian Coalition and Phyllis Schlafly of the Eagle Forum, {{as well as his}} adherence to the Quiverfull movement stirred <b>deep-seated</b> feelings and led some prominent Virginia Republicans such as U.S. Senator John Warner supported Beyer rather than Farris.|$|E
25|$|Wisden Cricketers' Almanack for 1960, {{reporting}} on the tour, said that {{the record of the}} team was even worse than that of the New Zealand cricket team in England in 1958, which was itself regarded as the worst in living memory. It suggested that the problem was <b>deep-seated,</b> in that the side appeared only rarely to play as a team, though talented individuals made occasional contributions.|$|E
25|$|The {{horror and}} revulsion at the cruelty and inhumanity that he {{witnessed}} still {{left him with}} a <b>deep-seated</b> hostility towards Germany; in the late-1980s he wrote that he would disembark from a lift rather than ride with a German of his generation. Nevertheless, three of his more memorable film roles were as Germans, one of them as a former SS officer in The Night Porter (1974).|$|E
25|$|The Cantle Report was {{published}} coincidentally with the Ritchie Report in 2001 and {{was produced by}} an Independent Review Team appointed by the Home Secretary. The Team considered all of the disturbances in English northern towns and created the concept of 'parallel lives' to describe the <b>deep-seated</b> segregation in the areas reviewed. It was not specific to Oldham and made recommendations for national and local government.|$|E
25|$|The {{creation}} of the Arrow Groups angered Kony, who began to feel {{that he no longer}} had the support of the population. In response the LRA mutilated numerous Acholi whom they believed to be government supporters. While the government efforts were a failure, the LRA reaction caused many Acholi to finally turn against the insurgency. However, this was tempered by the <b>deep-seated</b> antagonism towards the occupying government forces.|$|E
25|$|The union {{lost more}} than half of its members {{in the first years of}} the Great Depression as {{construction}} dwindled to almost nothing. The Union at first opposed unemployment insurance, consistent with the conservative politics of the AFL and the <b>deep-seated</b> opposition of its President William Hutcheson to governmental intervention of any sort in labor and employment matters. The union eventually dropped its opposition to unemployment insurance by 1934.|$|E
25|$|A marine seismic {{reflection}} {{study found}} evidence of faulting {{at the mouth of}} Budd Inlet, just north of the Olympia structure, and aligning with faint lineaments seen in the lidar imagery. These faults are not quite aligned with the Olympia structure, striking N75W (285°) rather than N45W (315°). It is uncertain how these faults relate to the structure, and whether they are <b>deep-seated</b> faults, or fractures due to bending of the shallow crust.|$|E
25|$|Further {{accusations against}} ASIO {{were raised by}} the Attorney-General {{following}} a series of bombings from 1963 to 1970 on the consulate of Communist Yugoslavia in Australia by Croatian far-right militia. Attorney-General Lionel Murphy alleged that ASIO had withheld information on the group which could have led to preventative measures taken against further bomb attacks (however, Murphy {{was a member of}} the recently sworn-in Labor government, which still held a <b>deep-seated</b> suspicion of ASIO).|$|E
25|$|On her {{voyage to}} Hobart Hibernias surgeon was Charles Carter, {{who had a}} <b>deep-seated</b> {{antipathy}} towards clergymen. Unfortunately for Carter, Hibernia carried Rev. Richard Hill. Hill complained that Carter had prohibited Hill from visiting prisoners in the hospital quarters, and had ridiculed Hill's efforts at moral instruction. Carter countered that visits from clergymen depressed the sick. Eventually, Carter's inability to exercise tact when dealing with the clergy led to his dismissal from the convict service.|$|E
25|$|It {{remains a}} paradox of the mystics that the {{passivity}} {{at which they}} appear to aim is really {{a state of the}} most intense activity: more, that where it is wholly absent no great creative action can take place. In it, the superficial self compels itself to be still, in order that it may liberate another more <b>deep-seated</b> power which is, in the ecstasy of the contemplative genius, raised to the highest pitch of efficiency.|$|E
25|$|Generally, the {{approach}} {{is to focus on}} the present problem, rather than the abuse itself. Treatment is highly varied and depends on the person’s specific issues. For instance, a person with a history of sexual abuse suffering from severe depression would be treated for depression. However, there is often an emphasis on cognitive restructuring due to the <b>deep-seated</b> nature of the trauma. Some newer techniques such as eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) {{have been shown to be}} effective.|$|E
25|$|Several sources {{consider}} sizable Muslim {{populations and}} <b>deep-seated</b> Islamic, Central Asian and Afghan influences to be defining characteristics of North Indian culture, both linguistically and culturally. Some of these influences are pre-Islamic, {{such as the}} Bactrian-originated Kushan Empire (modern day Afghanistan) that maintained twin capitals in Mathura (now in Uttar Pradesh) and Peshawar (in the present-day Pakistani Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province), {{as well as the}} Hun confederacies that periodically asserted their rule over large parts of North India.|$|E
25|$|Despite their similarities, works {{produced}} by divers artists were neither homogeneous nor isotropic. This venture was essentially nonlinear. Cubism was omnidirectional, growing {{like a tree}} with many branches. The progression of each artist was unique. Even when paths would cross, artists would not necessarily fall under one another's influence. Despite a growing awareness, a 'collective consciousness' based on a nonacademic passion for structure and mobility, and despite the sense of group unity that would attain a maxima circa 1912, <b>deep-seated</b> differences arose sporadically, often fueled by critics and dealers.|$|E
25|$|Hall reprised {{his role}} as Rusty Griswold in 2012 {{in a series of}} Old Navy holiday {{commercials}} featuring the Griswold family. From 2011-12, he guest starred in Warehouse 13 in the role of Walter Sykes, a man who once benefited from the use of an artifact but harboured a <b>deep-seated</b> anger towards the Warehouse and its agents when the artifact was taken from him (episodes 3.09, 3.11, 3.12). He also guest starred in Z Nation in the role of Gideon, a former communications manager leading a group of zombie apocalypse survivors (only episode 2.11).|$|E
25|$|Social ecology is a {{philosophy}} developed by Murray Bookchin in the 1960s; it holds that present ecological problems {{are rooted in}} <b>deep-seated</b> social problems, particularly in dominatory hierarchical political and social systems. These have resulted in an uncritical acceptance of an overly competitive grow-or-die philosophy. It suggests that this cannot be resisted by individual action such as ethical consumerism but must be addressed by more nuanced ethical thinking and collective activity grounded in radical democratic ideals. The complexity of relationships between people and with nature is emphasised, along with the importance of establishing social structures that take account of this.|$|E
25|$|The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community is {{the oldest}} {{continuous}} Muslim community in the United States. Ahmadi Muslims were among the earliest Muslim missionaries in America, the first being Mufti Muhammad Sadiq, and between 1921 and 1925 alone they converted over 1000 people to Islam. Although at first their efforts were broadly concentrated over {{a large number of}} racial and ethnic groups, subsequent realization of the <b>deep-seated</b> racial tensions and discrimination made Ahmadi missionaries focus their attention on mainly African Americans and the Muslim immigrant community and became vocal proponents of the African-American Civil Rights Movement. Many Ahmadi Muslims fled countries like Pakistan due to persecution in recent times.|$|E
25|$|Many {{patients}} first {{complain of}} pain {{that may be}} worse at night, may be intermittent and of varying intensity {{and may have been}} occurring for some time. Teenagers who are active in sports often complain of pain in the lower femur, or immediately below the knee. If the tumor is large, it can present as overt localised swelling. Sometimes a sudden fracture is the first symptom, because affected bone is not as strong as normal bone and may fracture abnormally with minor trauma. In cases of more <b>deep-seated</b> tumors that are not as close to the skin, such as those originating in the pelvis, localised swelling may not be apparent.|$|E
25|$|Steep rocky crags {{guard the}} whole {{western side of}} the fell, rising {{abruptly}} from the green valley of St John's in the Vale. This western face of Clough Head, is steep, rough and rocky. The principal rock features are, from north to south: Buck Castle, Wanthwaite Crags and Bram Crag. South of Wanthwaite Crags is the very steep Fisher's Wife's Rake, a grassy break in the cliffs (though with scree) which allows determined fell-walkers to ascend the fell on this side. North of Bram Crag is a <b>deep-seated</b> rocky ravine called Sandbed Gill. This gill contains a considerable flow of water in its rocky gorge, but it often has only a dry bed by the time it gets down to valley level.|$|E
