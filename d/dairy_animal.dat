40|$|Abstract- This paper {{deals with}} the new aid for {{detection}} of Estrus (Heat) in <b>dairy</b> <b>animals.</b> As <b>dairy</b> Technology is developing day by day, therefore reproductive performance of <b>dairy</b> <b>animals</b> is major concern in dairy industry. This Reproductive performance of <b>dairy</b> <b>animals</b> requires accurate and regular Estrus detection. Estrus {{is nothing but a}} behavioural symptom in mammals which indicate that female is mated close to the ovulation. That’s why Timely detection of estrus is the only solution to increase the fertility rate in <b>dairy</b> <b>animals.</b> Failure to detect animal in estrus and breeding animals which are not in estrus result in economic loss for the owner because of extended calving interval and additional semen expenses. Accurate Estrus detection gives idea about proper timing of Artificial Insemination. So Estrus detection is the key solution for effective growth in dairy technology...|$|R

40|$|This {{study has}} been {{conducted}} to optimize farm plans in different farming systems in Orathanadu block of the Thanjavur district in Tamil Nadu by randomly selecting 150 livestock farmers from 6 villages.

The net returns from dairying have been found as Rs 25, 864, which is about 29. 7 per cent to the total and it also could contribute maximum to employment (55 per cent). The optimal plan for small-farmer category has revealed that <b>dairy</b> <b>animals</b> have contributed maximum net returns (Rs 31, 640) to the aggregate net returns (Rs 49, 105). <b>Dairy</b> <b>animals</b> have also generated an employment of 840 humandays as against 45, 80 and 38. 6 humandays, from paddy–I, paddy–II and groundnut crops, respectively. The optimal plan for marginal farmers has indicated that <b>dairy</b> <b>animals</b> and sheep could be more attractive in terms of income and employment generation. Optimal plan for landless households has revealed that 5 <b>dairy</b> <b>animals,</b> 15 goats and 15 sheep could be valuable for increasing their income and employment.

This study has sought to define the survival and dispersal of a defined cohort of cattle born in Co. Kerry during 2000. The cohort was observed for a maximum of four years, from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2004. Beef and <b>dairy</b> <b>animals</b> moved an average 1. 31 and 0. 83 times, respectively.

40|$|The current {{document}} {{begins with}} a general overview of milk production in India. This {{is followed by a}} detailed study of dairy farming in Haryana State, particularly of the small-scale producers owning two to four milking animals who form the majority. The purpose is to assess their prospects for earning more from dairy farming, and to identify which areas of intervention in terms of management or policy are likely to be most favourable to them, and whether they are vulnerable to international competition. A further objective has been to evaluate the methodology used. The Review applies a method of economic analysis developed by the International Farm Comparison Network (IFCN) which is based on the concept of 'typical farms'. Four farm sizes were selected to represent typical farms in Haryana State, with two, four, 22 and 37 <b>dairy</b> <b>animals</b> respectively. Each farm is described in detail with assets, costs, profits and other economic information presented both graphically and in the text. A series of variables is introduced to model the effect of changes - in market prices or in production practices, for example - and these are discussed {{in the light of the}} reality facing small-scale dairy farmers. The Review concludes that the 'typical' farms with four and 22 <b>dairy</b> <b>animals</b> have the potential to cut their production costs and compete with imports. However, farmers with two <b>dairy</b> <b>animals</b> - the majority - are unlikely to be able to compete in future, even on the domestic market, without major changes. Nevertheless, the Review also recognises that in India, as in most other countries, farmers will keep their <b>dairy</b> <b>animals</b> as long as no alternative employment opportunities exist.

40|$|Interview {{questionnaires}} {{were administered to}} the general public in central Scotland and northern England during summer 2007 to investigate consumer awareness of UK dairy production methods, welfare issues and recognition of 'quality assurance' product logos. Fifty percent of respondents gave UK <b>dairy</b> <b>animal</b> welfare a positive rating. Recognition of individual quality assurance logos was poor and 75 % of respondents stated that they did not intentionally seek to buy products with any of the logos. Respondents' perceptions of good dairy welfare included: appropriate feeding, good stockmanship, plenty of space, freedom to room/free range and environmental cleanliness. Half of respondents felt they were poorly informed about food production and the majority of respondents (68 %) would like more information on food production. Respondents believed that information on animal welfare provided by veterinarians and farmers would be reliable. Most respondents (93 %) said they would pay more for good dairy welfare.

Phosphorus contamination has originated from manure-loaded soils found adjacent to milking barns, holding pens, feed lots under intensive animal use, and also developed pastures. In various batch-incubation studies, manure-loaded soils (7. 0 to 120. 9 g kg- ’ as total organic C) were treated alone or in combination with varying rates of calcium carbonate (to pH 7. 5), gypsum (0 to 100 g kg- ’ soil), ferrous sulfate (0 to 1000 mg kg- ’ as Fe), and alum (0 to 1000 mg kg- ’ as Al). The influence of aerobic and anaerobic conditions on soluble P were also studied. Soluble phosphate concentrations were reduced 40 to 63 % from gypsum application up to 100 mg kg- ’ soil; nitrate and soluble organic carbon concentrations were similarily reduced by 45 % and 49 %, respectively.
