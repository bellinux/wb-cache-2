Sleep paralysis occurs in a transition time and the person is in a dream-like state, hallucinations can occur just before falling asleep (hynogogic hallucination) or just after (<b>hypnopompic</b> <b>hallucination).</b> These hallucinations feel real to the person experiencing sleep paralysis and can often be accompanied by sensory features: musty smells, shuffling sounds, visions of ghosts, aliens, and monsters.

One history with the title 'Of the Night-Mare' describes the nightly experiences of the 50 -year-old woman. This case report is subject of this article. The experiences in this case could without doubt be diagnosed as sleep paralysis accompanied by hypnagogic hallucinations.

40|$|One factor {{limiting}} research involving hypnagogic and <b>hypnopompic</b> (H&H) <b>hallucinations</b> is {{the lack}} of a brief, valid and reliable self-report measure of such experiences. The present paper reports {{on the development of the}} Durham Hypnagogic and <b>Hypnopompic</b> <b>Hallucinations</b> Questionnaire (DHQ), which consists of three unidimensional subscales assessing the presence of auditory, visual, and felt-presence experiences in the H&H state. In a sample of 18 - 29 year olds (N = 365) this scale was found to have satisfactory psychometric properties. A subsample (n = 293) completed self-report measures of intrusive thoughts, thought suppression and transliminality. Intrusive thoughts and the conscious desire to undertake thought suppression both correlated with levels of auditory, but not visual or felt-presence H&H hallucinations.

40|$|Aim: Hypnagogic and <b>hypnopompic</b> <b>hallucinations</b> are {{characteristic}} symptoms of narcolepsy, as are excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy and sleep paralysis. Narcolepsy patients may also experience daytime hallucinations unrelated to sleep-wake transitions. The effect of medication on hallucinations {{is of interest}} since treatment of narcolepsy may provoke psychotic symptoms. We aim to analyze the relation between sodium oxybate (SXB) treatment and psychotic symptoms in narcolepsy patients. Furthermore, we analyze the characteristics of hallucinations to determine their nature as mainly psychotic or hypnagogic and raise a discussion about whether SXB causes psychosis or if psychosis occurs as an endogenous complication in narcolepsy. Method: We present altogether four patients with narcolepsy who experienced psychotic symptoms during treatment with SXB. In addition, we searched the literature for descriptions of hallucinations in narcolepsy and similarities and differences with psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia. Results: Three out of four patients had hallucinations typical for psychosis and one had symptoms that resembled aggravated hypnagogic hallucinations. Two patients also had delusional symptoms primarily associated with mental disorders. Tapering down SXB was tried and helped in two out of four cases. Adding antipsychotic treatment (risperidone) alleviated psychotic symptoms in two cases. Conclusion: Psychotic symptoms in narcolepsy may appear during SXB treatment. Hallucinations resemble those seen in schizophrenia however the insight that symptoms are delusional is usually preserved. In case of SXB-induced psychotic symptoms or hallucinations, reducing SXB dose or adding antipsychotic medication can be tried...|$|R
40|$|By definition, {{hallucinations}} {{occur only}} in the full waking state. Yet similarities to sleep-related experiences such as hypnagogic and <b>hypnopompic</b> <b>hallucinations,</b> dreams and parasomnias, have been noted since antiquity. These observations have prompted researchers to suggest a common aetiology for these phenomena based on the neurobiology of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. With our recent understanding of hallucinations in different population groups and at the neurobiological, cognitive and interpersonal levels, {{it is now possible}} to draw comparisons between the 2 sets of experiences as never before. In the current article, we make detailed comparisons between sleep-related experiences and hallucinations in Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and eye disease, at the levels of phenomenology (content, sensory modalities involved, perceptual attributes) and of brain function (brain activations, resting-state networks, neurotransmitter action). Findings show that sleep-related experiences share considerable overlap with hallucinations at the level of subjective descriptions and underlying brain mechanisms. Key differences remain however: (1) Sleep-related perceptions are immersive and largely cut off from reality, whereas hallucinations are discrete and overlaid on veridical perceptions; and (2) Sleep-related perceptions involve only a subset of neural networks implicated in hallucinations, reflecting perceptual signals processed in a functionally and cognitively closed-loop circuit. In summary, both phenomena are non-veridical perceptions that share some phenomenological and neural similarities, but insufficient evidence exists to fully support the notion that the majority of hallucinations depend on REM processes or REM intrusions into waking consciousness...|$|R

HLA-DQ alleles are not particularly mutated in narcoleptic patients but they directly influence susceptibility to the disease. DQB 1 (*) 0602 homozygote carriers have a two to four times higher risk of developing the disease than heterozygote carriers. in the present study we report a rare multiplex familial case of narcolepsy-cataplexy and show the strong effect of the HLA-DQB 1 (*) 0602 allele upon the disease phenotype. in the family studied herein, both the proband and his brother are severely affected and homozygous DQB 1 * 0602, whereas their sister does not carry the allele and is not affected at all. These data corroborate previous findings proposing DQB 1 * 0602 homozygous subjects to be far more susceptible to narcolepsy. Insights into the DQB 1 * 0602 positive family that include homozygous subjects may prove to be an important asset in the investigation of genetic vs. environmental factors predisposing to narcolepsy.

50|$|In 1919 {{the family}} moved to Rome, where they kept a luxurious {{household}} in the Villa Caetani on the Gianicolo and received many guests, such as the German painter Leo von König (1871-1944) who became Wolfgang's first art teacher. It was in Rome, under the guidance of his father´s friend, the archeologist Ludwig Pollak, that he became an expert in Greek and Roman archaeology. In 1923 he returned to Berlin alone to apply for the Academy. Although unsuccessful, he met his lifelong friend, companion and patron, the Swiss violinist and photographer Eva Sulzer (Winterthur 1902 - 1990 Mexico City). In 1925 he exhibited at the Berlin Secession and studied further in aesthetics, deeply influenced by Julius Meier-Graefe, Nietzsche, Schopenhauer and the Gestalt theory of Max Wertheimer. It is here and with <b>hypnopompic</b> <b>hallucinations</b> in the castle in Sagan that he found the base for his later ideas of a deep entanglement of vision and outer world. After another year of studies, in Paris and Cassis (1925-26), where he met Roland Penrose, Jean Varda (Janco) and Georges Braque, he visited the art school of Hans Hofmann in Munich and, in 1928, Saint-Tropez. He then decided to settle in Paris. The year 1928 marks also the beginning of the decline of the family´s splendour, once founded on the patriarchal rules of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy. After a homoerotic affair with a mental healer, his younger brother Hans-Peter died unexpectedly in a Berlin insane asylum, presumably of suicide; the parents consequently separated; their mother´s bipolar disposition intensified as a result; the fortune of Gustav Paalen is quashed after the Black Tuesday, 1929. A later tragedy, crucial to Paalen's development, was his beloved brother Rainer's shooting himself in head with a pistol. Wolfgang witnessed the event, although Rainer survived, following treatment in a Berlin hospital and escaped from the city in 1933. He died in a mental hospital in Czechoslovakia in 1942.|$|R

40|$|Background/aims: Narcolepsy is {{a lifelong}} sleep {{disorder}} with an onset most frequently in the second decade of life. The cardinal symptoms are excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, hypnagogic and <b>hypnopompic</b> <b>hallucinations</b> sleep paralysis and disturbed nighttime sleep. The purpose of this thesis was to study a population-based cohort {{of children and adolescents}} with narcolepsy in western Sweden to determine the incidence and relationship with the H 1 N 1 influenza vaccination, psychiatric comorbidity, cognitive profile, health-related quality of life, adaptive behavior and parenting stress. Methods: We aimed to identify all individuals below 18 years of age who developed narcolepsy between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2010. Post-H 1 N 1 influenza vaccination (PHV) narcolepsy was considered in patients with clinical onset within 10 months of vaccination. Psychiatric comorbidity was investigated using a test battery of semi-structured interviews and screening tools. The cognitive assessments were made by a clinical psychologist using age specific Wechsler Scales. A narcolepsy-specific quality of life questionnaire, the NARQoL was generated based on statements from four focus groups comprising young people with narcolepsy and was used along with the generic KIDSCREEN questionnaire to assess the HrQoL in the study population. The Adaptive Behavior Assessment System was administered to measure adaptive skills in the children and the short form of the Parenting Stress Index questionnaire was used to measure parenting stress in their parents. Results: The incidence of narcolepsy was 25 times higher in the period after the vaccination compared with the period before. The children in the PHV group had a lower age at onset and a more sudden onset than is generally seen. Psychiatric comorbidity was present in 43 % of the patients in the PHV group; ADHD in 8 / 28, major depression in 6 / 30, general anxiety disorder in 3 / 30 and oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) in 2 / 30. In the non-post-H 1 N 1 influenza vaccination (nPHV) narcolepsy group, 1 / 7 patients had ADHD in combination with ODD. The cognitive assessment showed decreased verbal comprehension and working memory in both patient groups. Parents in the PHV group rated significantly lower scores for adaptive behavior relating to conceptual and social composites. Parents also rated higher in “total stress”, “parent-child dysfunctional interaction” and “difficult child”, significantly so in the PHV group. The pilot NARQoL questionnaire consisted of two patient reported outcome modules: QoL and future perceptions. Test-retest reliability and convergent validity with the KIDSCREEN- 10 was good. Children with narcolepsy had significantly diminished scores compared with controls on both the KIDSCREEN and NARQoL; the PHV children in all domains of the NARQoL. Furthermore, patients with psychiatric comorbidity had a significantly lower full-scale IQ, HrQoL and adaptive behavior compared with those without. Conclusions: The H 1 N 1 influenza vaccination with Pandemrix represents a precipitating factor for narcolepsy in children. The identified high prevalence of psychiatric comorbidity and cognitive difficulties highlights the importance of a careful psychiatric and neuropsychological follow-up. The NARQoL revealed a more globally affected QoL than previously reported. Impaired adaptive behavior and high levels of parenting stress indicate considerable impact on daily life...|$|R
40|$|The studies {{reported}} in this thesis were designed to address several important issues in symptom-specific cognitive models of psychosis. The design of these studies was guided by {{a commitment to the}} continuity hypothesis of psychosis, which holds that psychotic experiences exist on a continuum stretching into the healthy population. The thesis firstly examines a two-factor cognitive model of persecutory ideation, focusing primarily on the roles of thought suppression, intrusive thoughts, anxiety, social rank, and the jumping to conclusions bias. The thesis then turns to an examination of cognitive factors involved in hallucinations and, in particular, auditory verbal hallucinations. Chapters in this section describe a series of experimental and theoretical studies of the relations between intrusive thoughts and hallucinations, agency and hallucinations, and the role of inner speech in auditory verbal hallucinations. Two-factor models of persecutory delusion (PD) formation propose that in the first stage of PD formation an initial implausible idea is triggered. The second stage of Deformation is then the uncritical adoption of such a thought as a belief, which may be due to cognitive biases such as the jumping to conclusions (JTC) bias often present in those with PDs. The first study (Chapter 1) investigated whether thought suppression, and its interaction with anxiety, was associated with levels of non-clinical persecutory delusion like beliefs (PDLBs). It was hypothesised that thought suppression could {{play a role in the}} formation and maintenance of PDLBs through its tendency to lead to intrusive thoughts, and to trigger initial implausible ideas. Consistent with this proposal, thought suppression was positively associated with PDLBs only when anxiety was high. The second study (Chapter 2) examined a prediction of the two-factor model, namely that a second-stage factor, the jumping to conclusions (JTC) bias, should interact with first-stage factors, specifically social anxiety, social rank, anomalous experiences and thought suppression. Consistent with the two-factor model, the JTC bias was found not to be an independent predictor of PDLB levels, but its interaction with social rank was a significant predictor of PDLBs. It was concluded that although evidence was found for the two-factor model, the presence of the JTC bias was neither a sufficient nor necessary condition for PDLB formation. In addition to being postulated to play a role in persecutory delusion formation, intrusive thoughts have been implicated in the formation of hallucinations, and particularly auditory verbal hallucinations (AVHs). The third study (Chapter 3) created a new tool for assessing hypnagogic and <b>hypnopompic</b> (H&H) <b>hallucinations,</b> and showed that the presence of auditory H&H hallucinations, but not visual or felt-presence H&H hallucinations, was associated with a greater tendency to experience intrusions. The fourth study (Chapter 4) developed an extended model of AVHs in which rumination, as well as thought suppression, were proposed to be involved in the formation of AVHs, through their creation of intrusive thoughts. This model was tested in a healthy sample of individuals using structural equation modelling, and the proposed model was found to be a good fit to the data. The study on rumination and AVHs highlighted that agency disruption factors are likely to be involved in leading these self-generated cognitions to be experienced as alien. A theoretical analysis (Chapter 5) was made of the mechanisms likely to be involved in this disruption of agency, involving the concept of a neurocognitive action self-monitoring system (NASS) and a breakdown in the processes leading to the illusion of conscious will. A consideration was also given to how a Vygotskian conception of inner speech could contribute to inner speech models of AVHs. The next study (Chapter 6) then performed an empirical test of the proposal that the disruption of agency in AVHs is associated with a faulty NASS. Subliminal primes were used as a proxy for the predicted state proposed to exist in the NASS, which leads to the experience of agency. It was proposed that those prone to hallucinations would be less able to use primes to enhance their experience of agency, due to deficits in their NASS. A statistically significant trend was found for the more hallucination-prone to be less able to use subliminal primes, but this effect was only found in women. It was concluded that although this was a promising finding, the effect was too small and gender-specific to be practical to test in a clinical sample of patients with AVHs. The proposal that AVHs result from a breakdown in the NASS, specifically a corollary discharge deficit between speech production and reception areas, has been claimed to be supported by electrophysiological event-related potential (ERP) studies. However, only a simplistic conception of inner speech has thus far been investigated in ERP studies, and the potential confounding effects of attention have not been considered. The Nl ERP component response to auditory stimuli during inner speech was studied in as ample of healthy volunteers (Chapter 7). Although dampening of the Nl response was found during all types of inner speech, as compared to a silent baseline condition, dampening was also found during a mental rotation task. It was concluded that dampening of the Nl ERP component during inner speech is due to attention factors, and is not indicative of a corollary discharge mechanism. Finally, a theoretical analysis considers whether inner speech models of AVHs are able to satisfactorily account for the phenomenology of the experience (Chapter 8). It is concluded that subcategorisation of auditory hallucinations may be necessary, with memory-based, inner speech-based, and ictal-based models each accounting for a subcategory of auditory hallucinations. The concept of the dynamic developmental progression of AVHs is introduced and avenues for future research in this area highlighte...|$|R
