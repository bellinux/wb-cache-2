5|$|A {{motif of}} father-against-son {{conflict}} was repeated when Cronus {{was confronted by}} his son, Zeus. Because Cronus had betrayed his father, he feared that his offspring would do the same, and so each time Rhea gave birth, <b>he</b> <b>snatched</b> up the child and ate it. Rhea hated this and tricked him by hiding Zeus and wrapping a stone in a baby's blanket, which Cronus ate. When Zeus was full grown, he fed Cronus a drugged drink which caused him to vomit, throwing up Rhea's other children and the stone, which {{had been sitting in}} Cronus's stomach all along. Zeus then challenged Cronus to war for the kingship of the gods. At last, {{with the help of the}} Cyclopes (whom Zeus freed from Tartarus), Zeus and his siblings were victorious, while Cronus and the Titans were hurled down to imprisonment in Tartarus.|$|E
5|$|Rendered {{unable to}} speak because of her injuries, Philomela wove a {{tapestry}} (or a robe) that told her story and had it sent to Procne. Procne was incensed and in revenge, she killed her son by Tereus, Itys (or Itylos), boiled him and served him as a meal to her husband. After Tereus ate Itys, the sisters presented him with the severed head of his son, and {{he became aware of}} their conspiracy and his cannibalistic meal. <b>He</b> <b>snatched</b> up an axe and pursued them with the intent to kill the sisters. They fled but were almost overtaken by Tereus at Daulia in Phocis. In desperation, they prayed to the gods to be turned into birds and escape Tereus' rage and vengeance. The gods transformed Procne into a swallow and Philomela into a nightingale. Subsequently, the gods would transform Tereus into a hoopoe.|$|E
25|$|Khan {{started his}} {{shooting}} career at Pabna Shooting Club. Although he preferred athletics to shooting, <b>he</b> <b>snatched</b> inter-club shooting championship in 1999 and 2000. Still an athletics fanatic, Khan entered the athletics training programme of Bangladesh Krira Shiksha Pratisthan (BKSP), the national sports institute of Bangladesh. But his career plans changed when his coach {{asked him to}} join the newly organized shooting team of BKSP. Khan agreed to his coach's proposal more as a responsibility than interest. Later, he insisted that his coaches at BKSP helped him to build his winning mentality.|$|E

25|$|The {{first attempt}} at conquest by Shah Zaman was in 1793. He came to Hasan Abdal from which he sent an army of 7000 cavalry under Ahmad Shah Shahnachi but the Sikhs routed them. It was a great setback to Shah Zaman, but in 1795 he re-organised forces and again {{attacked}} Hasan Abdal, This time <b>he</b> <b>snatched</b> Rohtas from the Sukerchikias, whose leader was Ranjit Singh. Singh suffered at Shah Zaman's hands. However, Shah Zaman {{had to return to}} Kabul as an invasion of his country from the west was apprehended. When he returned, Ranjit Singh dislodged the Afghans from Rohtas.|$|E
500|$|Mos Def {{collaborated with}} singer Georgia Anne Muldrow and rappers Slick Rick and Talib Kweli—his {{partner in the}} rap duo Black Star. Muldrow sang and played piano on [...] "Roses", which she {{originally}} wrote and recorded in 2008 for her album Umsindo (2009). She said Mos Def [...] "borrowed" [...] the song for The Ecstatic after they met through a mutual friend. [...] "They came over one day and started playing 'Roses.' He was singing the song and knew it. He said 'I wanna grab that.' I said, 'Man, I already got this as a single'. He just wanted that song. <b>He</b> <b>snatched</b> it up real quick", she recalled in laughter. Along with Madlib, Oh No, and J Dilla, Muldrow had been an affiliate of Stones Throw Records; according to journalist Nathan Rabin, they collectively produced half of the album, giving its sound a [...] "sympathetic" [...] quality. With The Ecstatic, Mos Def {{said he wanted to}} offer listeners sincere, uninhibited observations about life and love, [...] "some truth and positive heart lift", without the need for club songs. [...] "No disrespect to [...] ".|$|E
500|$|With the 2000 Sydney Olympics approaching, Chambers {{studied the}} {{technique}} of other sprinters. In an interview with BBC journalist Tom Fordyce, Chambers commented on the stamina Greene and Surin had gained from running in the 200metres event and Jason Gardener's improved acceleration through running the 60metres event. He experimented with distances {{at the beginning of}} 2000, sprinting over 50, 60 and 200m in various competitions. He set a personal best of 6.55s in the 60m event in Ghent in February. A hamstring injury caused him to miss six weeks of training and when he returned his 100m performances were lacklustre. He finished ninth at the Golden Gala in Rome with a slow time of 10.41s [...] and was seventh in a tame 10.30s at the London Grand Prix, results that led him to consider quitting the season altogether. A late rejuvenation at the British Olympic trials guaranteed his selection as <b>he</b> <b>snatched</b> first place with 10.11s (just one hundredth of a second ahead of Darren Campbell). Victory against in-form world record holder Maurice Greene in Gateshead raised Chambers' confidence and he stated his aim to take home a medal from the Games.|$|E

2500|$|During the 1970 election, Tony Benn {{declared}} {{in a speech}} that Powell's approach to immigration was 'evil' and stated [...] "The flag of racialism which has been hoisted in Wolverhampton is {{beginning to look like}} the one that fluttered over Dachau and Belsen."

2500|$|In 1993, Paulo Portas {{publicly}} embarrassed Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa (then {{a prominent}} political figure, {{who would become}} President of Portugal in 2016) when he stated on TV that Marcelo was one of O Independente's sources albeit an unreliable one because he was prone to making up stories, such as when he gave an account of a political VIP dinner that had never taken place going as far as inventing that the soup served during the dinner was Vichyssoise. This did not prevent Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, in 1999 when he was leader of Portugal's Social Democratic Party (PSD), from seeking an elections alliance with Paulo Portas's CDS-PP that was initially agreed but collapsed shortly after due to Portas's involvement in the Moderna scandal (see below). Marcelo then had to resign from the PSD leadership and lost his opportunity to become prime-minister. Since then, in Portuguese politics, [...] "Vichysoisse" [...] (which is a cold soup) {{has served as a}} metaphor for [...] "revenge that is best served cold" [...] and for Portas's betrayal of his one-time allies—such as when <b>he</b> <b>snatched</b> the CDS-PP party leadership from his former party mentor Manuel Monteiro or when he undermined Pedro Passos Coelho in their coalition government.|$|E

2500|$|The 35th {{and final}} frame lasted 68 minutes. In that frame Davis led 62–44, {{with only the}} last four [...] on the table, worth 22 points. Taylor stayed in {{contention}} by potting a very difficult brown from long range, followed by a tricky blue and pink. This meant that, for the first time, the title would be decided on the very last ball, the black. Taylor tried to double it into the left middle pocket; he missed, but the ball rebounded to a safe position {{at the top of}} the table. Davis then played an excellent safety shot, putting the black near the middle of the baulk (bottom) cushion and leaving the cue ball near the right-hand cushion, a little above the corner pocket. Taylor then half-attempted to double the black into the top-left corner pocket but missed, with the black rebounding up and down the table, eventually sneaking past the left middle pocket to a relatively safe position. As the applause died down from the audience, veteran commentator Ted Lowe remarked, [...] "I'm sure Dennis wouldn't mind my saying he chanced his arm, and it's come out lucky". Davis's next attempt went awry, as a double-kiss left Taylor with a reasonable middle-distance pot to the green corner pocket. However, <b>he</b> <b>snatched</b> somewhat at the shot and missed the pot ("the biggest shot of his life", as commentator Jim Meadowcroft described it). Taylor thought, in his disappointment, that he had left Davis a moderately easy cut on the black into the top pocket from fairly close range. However, that pot was at a thinner angle than Taylor had anticipated as he tried to judge where the balls would finish up.|$|E
