30|$|Using <b>data</b> <b>for</b> all <b>exporters,</b> we {{show that}} it is a small group of firms that {{dominate}} exports in Spain. For example, in 2015 the top 200 firms were responsible for half of Spanish exports. This concentration has not changed substantially over the 1997 – 2015 period. The dominance of a few firms, a phenomenon denoted as granularity, also defines the specialization of Spanish exports. If top exporters disappeared, Spain would lose its revealed comparative advantage in 60 % of industries, which account for 45 % of all Spanish exports. Finally, granularity explains around one-third of the growth in Spanish exports.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} first firm-level {{evidence of}} the links between income inequality and the patterns of trade and export prices. We identify a theoretical mechanism behind these links, which suggests that a more unequal income distribution leads to higher average prices. We test the theory using detailed <b>data</b> <b>for</b> Brazilian <b>exporters</b> and find that the destination countries' first and second moment of the income distribution are important determinants of export prices. Controlling for income per capita, prices are systematically higher in more unequal countries, with this effect being particularly relevant for middle-income countries and holding only for differentiated goods...|$|R

Combining loan and shipment <b>data</b> <b>for</b> all <b>exporters</b> in Peru, {{we find that}} all banks have abnormally large and persistent loan portfolio exposures {{to at least one}} export destination market. Specifications that saturate all bank-time and firm-time variation show that firms that expand exports to a country are more likely to borrow from banks that specialize in that country. This link between exports and bank specialization holds both for existing and new lending relationships. Using dif-ferential exposure to the 2008 financial crisis, we further find that shocks to the credit supply of banks has a larger effect on exports to the bank’s markets of specialization, implying that specialized bank debt is difficult to replace. These results suggest that banks have market-specific areas of expertise that are distinct from firm-specific knowl-edge gathered through relationship lending...|$|R

This paper uses sectoral trade data to compare and quantify the impact {{that a number of}} institutional and geographical trade barriers have on bilateral trade flows. Data on distance, tariffs, inland cost of importing and exporting, the number of documents required for trade, time and information technology are used as proxies for trade barriers. A gravity model of trade is estimated using bilateral <b>data</b> <b>for</b> 13 <b>exporters</b> and 167 importers and sectoral data at 4 -digit of the SITC classification. Results of the estimation indicate that trade barriers related to the number of days, the number of documents required for trade and technological innovation achievements have a greater impact on trade flows than tariff barriers. This result also holds when the gravity model is estimated for different sectors and for individual countries. According to these findings, trade policy negotiation efforts should be focused on facilitating trade processes and should be in the forefront of multilateral negotiations...|$|R

3000|$|Concentration {{of exports}} by firm {{is not a}} {{particular}} characteristic of the Spanish economy. Table  3 compares the concentration of exports by firm in Spain with other countries. Since Spanish data {{is based on the}} universe of exporters, we only compared Spain with countries where the export concentration by firm was also calculated using <b>data</b> <b>for</b> all <b>exporters.</b> First, we compared Spain with the sample of 32 developing countries over the 2004 – 2008 period analyzed in Freund and Pierola (2015). They reported that the top exporter accounted for 14 % of total exports, and the top 5 exporters for around 33 % of total exports. The figures for Spain are 3 and 10 %, respectively. These figures show that export concentration was much larger in developing countries than in Spain. The next rows present <b>data</b> <b>for</b> three European countries in 2003 : Belgium, France and Norway, as calculated by Mayer and Ottaviano (2008). 7 They provide <b>data</b> <b>for</b> the top 1, 5 and 10 % of exporters. To facilitate comparisons, we also calculated these percentages for Spain. The top 1 % of firms held 72 % of all exports in Spain, 48 % in Belgium, 68 % in France and 53 % in Norway. The top 5 % of exporters accounted for 92 % of total exports in Spain, 73 % in Belgium, 88 % in France and 81 % in Norway. Finally, the top 10 % of exporters held 97 % of total exports in Spain, 84 % in Belgium, 94 % in France and 91 % in Norway. These figures point {{to the fact that the}} concentration of exports in Spain was similar to that found in a large developed country, such as France. This conclusion is confirmed in the last row, which presents US <b>data</b> <b>for</b> 2000, as calculated by Bernard et al. (2009). They reported that the top 1 % of firms account for 81 % of US exports, the top 5 % of firms for 93 % of total exports and the top 10 % of firms for 96 % of total exports. To sum up, the concentration of exports by firm in Spain is much lower than in developing countries, and similar to that found in other large developed countries. 8 [...]...|$|R
40|$|This paper makes three contributions. (1) It {{summarizes}} in tabular form {{a recent}} literature made of 36 micro-econometric studies for 16 different {{countries on the}} relationship between export destination and firm performance. (2) It reports estimates of the productivity premium of German firms exporting to the Euro-zone and beyond, controlling for unobserved time invariant firm specific effects, and tests for self-selection of more productive firms into exporting beyond the Euro-zone. (3) It corrects a serious flaw in hitherto published studies that ignore the potentially disastrous consequences of extreme observations, or outliers. The paper shows that estimates of the exporter productivity premium by destination are driven by a small share of outliers. Using a "clean" sample without outliers the estimated productivity premium of firms that export to the Euro-zone only is no longer much smaller that the premium of firms that export beyond the Euro-zone, too, and the premium itself over firms that serve the German market only is tiny. Furthermore, an ex-ante differential that is statistically significant and large only shows up for enterprises that exported to the Euro-zone already and start to export to countries outside the Euro-zone. These conclusions differ considerably from those based on non-robust standard regression analyses. robust estimation, panel <b>data,</b> <b>exporter</b> productivity premium, export destinations...|$|R
