5000|$|Mrs Adah Campbell [...] {{commenced}} poultry-keeping around 1887 {{and later}} purchased an <b>Indian</b> <b>Runner</b> <b>Duck</b> of indiscriminate type {{which was an}} exceptional layer (182 eggs in 196 days), and which formed the basis in developing the [...] "Campbell Ducks"; {{in her own words}} [...] "Various matings of Rouen, Indian Runner and Wild Duck were resorted to produce them". The resulting birds were prolific layers. The [...] "Campbell" [...] breed was introduced to the public in 1898. In an attempt to create a more attractive buff-colored duck Mrs. Campbell resorted to further cross-matings. The resulting progeny, introduced to the Public in January 1901, is alleged to have reminded Mrs. Campbell of British army uniforms, hence naming this new color-form [...] "Khaki Campbell Duck".|$|E
50|$|Pure breed enthusiasts, exhibitors {{and show}} judges wanted to {{establish}} standard descriptions. Standards were drawn up {{in by the}} Waterfowl Club in England (1897) and America (1898) for the pied color varieties. These were largely the same until 1915 when the two countries diverged. The American Poultry Association chose a variety with blue in the genotype whilst the English Poultry Club Standard kept to the pure form described by Donald in his original pamphlet. Other colors followed making use of black genes brought in by some of Walton's birds. These were to produce black, chocolate and Cumberland blue. Later were developed the mallard, trout, blue trout, and apricot trout versions. Slightly different names and descriptions {{can be found in}} American and German standards. An account of the influence of the <b>Indian</b> <b>Runner</b> <b>Duck</b> Club (founded in 1906), particularly the input by John Donald, Joseph Walton, Dr J.A. Coutts and Matthew Smith, can be found in Ashton (2002).|$|E
50|$|Named for its {{distinctive}} {{black and white}} plumage, reminiscent of the colouration of the European magpie, the typical example of the breed is predominantly white with two large black areas {{on the back and}} top of the head. As the bird ages the black cap will normally begin to be flecked with white and may eventually become completely white. Blue, silver and chocolate which is very rare, are also color varieties that Magpies can come in. However, blue is the only other variety besides black that is recognized by the American Poultry Association. Similar in shape to the Khaki Campbell, but more substantial, the Magpie is moderately streamlined with a somewhat upright carriage that suggests <b>Indian</b> <b>Runner</b> <b>duck</b> in its ancestral bloodline. The bill is yellow or orange, but turns green in older birds. The legs and feet are orange but may be mottled. The chest is rounded and the neck moderately long. Males have, when fully feathered, curled feathers on the tail. Females have, when fully feathered, straight feathers on the tail. Males weigh around 2.7 kg on average, and females around 2.5 kg, although the American standard specifies 1 lb lower for each. They lay between 220-290 large white eggs annually. They are a hardy variety, active foragers, and live for approximately 9 to 12 years. While generally at home on land and not capable of sustained flight, they can propel themselves over a 2-3-foot wall if startled.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine the phenotype characteristics of Sasak ducks in Lombok Island.  The study used 64 Sasak ducks at production stage which were kept intensively by small holder farmers. Observations on the characteristics of the feather color were carried out directly on each animal. The data observed were feather colors, beak color, and the color of the foot and shank, while the data {{on the size of the}} body that was observed were body weight, beak length, neck length, back length, breast circumference, back length, thigh length, shank length, and the distance between the two pubic bones. The data obtained were tabulated and analyzed descriptively. The study concluded that the characteristic of the color of feathers in Sasak ducks were dominated by Roman color (50. 13 %), followed by Tanak color (21. 87 %), Tongkak color (15. 63 %), Rombak color (6. 25 %), and Cemaning color (3. 12 %).  Sasak ducks with medium size were observed to have a relatively long beak, medium-long neck, short back, broad and deep chest, medium height, and the distance between the two pubic bones was quite wide. These characteristics indicate that Sasak ducks are the type of superior Indian Runner having better production ability compared to the other types of <b>Indian</b> <b>Runner</b> <b>duck...</b>|$|E

50|$|The <b>Indian</b> <b>Runner</b> <b>ducks</b> are domesticated {{waterfowl}} {{that live}} in the archipelago of the East Indies. There is no evidence that they came originally from India itself. Attempts by British breeders {{at the beginning of the}} twentieth century to find examples in the subcontinent had very limited success. Like many other breeds of waterfowl imported into Europe and America, the term 'Indian' may well be fanciful, denoting a loading port or the transport by 'India-men' sailing ships of the East India Company. Other misnamed geese and ducks include the African goose, the black East Indian duck and the Muscovy duck.|$|R
50|$|<b>Indian</b> <b>Runner</b> <b>ducks</b> and Pekins {{brought in}} unusual plumage colour mutations. These {{included}} the dusky and restricted mallard genes, light phase, harlequin phase, blue and brown dilutions, {{as well as}} the famous pied varieties named by the geneticist F.M. Lancaster as the 'Runner pattern'. Much of the proliferation of new colour varieties in breeds of domestic duck begins with the importation of these oriental ducks. Original research by R.G. Jaap (1930s) and F.M. Lancaster has allowed breeders to understand the effect of genotypes in managing and creating colour varieties. Simplified information can be found in writings by Dave Holderread, and Mike and Chris Ashton.|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the potential of <b>Indian</b> <b>duck</b> <b>runners</b> (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus) for {{the control of the}} liver fluke by eating the intermediate host, the snail Galba truncatula. The trematode Fasciola hepatica can cause economic loss in cattle and sheep production systems. In this study 24 ducks were grazing on a 12 x 4 meter acreage. A density of 2 ducks m- 2 in continuous grazing for a period of two hours significantly reduced the snail population. It is suggested that <b>Indian</b> <b>duck</b> <b>runners</b> were an effective biological control agent against Galba truncatula...|$|R

5000|$|Returning to South Australia {{after an}} {{extended}} stay in Britain, he began farming at his property, Corryton Park, {{and was one}} of the first in the State to use superphosphate, with excellent results, though only on his garden. He often expressed regret that he hadn't used the chemical to increase his wheat yield. It remained for Professor Lowrie to prove its application to South Australian farming, though Jack Cudmore had used [...] "super" [...] on Yorke's Peninsula with excellent results. For a time he owned Moolooloo and Coxare (?) stations, stocked with cattle that he bred at Corryton. He bred his own bulls from pedigree Shorthorns and his own rams from stock be bought from the Murrays. In later years he concentrated on Jersey cattle he bought from Victoria then from A. J. Murray at Mount Crawford. He imported Lincoln sheep, Australia's first <b>Indian</b> <b>Runner</b> <b>ducks,</b> pheasants, partridges and hares.|$|R
40|$|For the {{completion}} of its life cycle, Fasciola hepatica {{is dependent on the}} presence of the snail Galba truncatula. The elimination of the intermediate host is therefore a significant approach in the control of fasciolosis. Field investigations on the control of Galba truncatula by <b>Indian</b> <b>Runner</b> <b>ducks</b> were carried out from the beginning of July till the end of October. On a dairy farm with positive bulk tank milk ELISA results for Fasciola hepatica, a pasture with different potential snail habitats, was divided into four plots. On two of these plots a group of <b>runner</b> <b>ducks</b> was placed every other week for a period of eight weeks, the other plots were used for control. Every week the number of snails of the species Galba truncatula on each plot was investigated. The appearance of metacercariae on the plots was monitored weekly starting at the end of July. Keeping <b>runner</b> <b>ducks</b> on weekly intervals over a period of eight weeks in summer, had no significant effect (p = 0, 154) on the number of snails of the species Galba truncatula on the plots. During the study no metacercariae were found at all. However, {{based on the results of}} this study, it is not possible to reject the use of <b>runner</b> <b>ducks</b> as a prevention strategy in the control of fasciolosis. Prior to further research involving <b>runner</b> <b>ducks,</b> one should gather more knowledge about the Galba truncatula populations on the experimental pastures by monitoring these populations for several months...|$|R
5000|$|The ducks vary {{in weight}} between 1.4 and 2.3 kg. Their height (from crown to tail tip) ranges from 50 cm in small females to about 76 cm in the taller males. The erect {{carriage}} {{is a result}} of a pelvic girdle that is situated more towards the tail region of the bird compared to other breeds of domestic duck. This structural feature allows the birds to walk or [...] "quickstep", rather than waddle, as seen with other <b>duck</b> breeds. <b>Indian</b> <b>Runner</b> <b>ducks</b> have a long, wedge-shaped head. [...] The bill should blend into the head smoothly being as straight as possible from bean {{to the back of the}} skull. The head should be shallower than what is seen with most other breeds of duck. This effect gives a racy appearance, a breed trait. Eye placement is high on the head. <b>Indian</b> <b>Runners</b> should have long, slender necks that smoothly transition into the body. The body is long, slim but round in appearance. The eggs are often greenish-white in color. <b>Indian</b> <b>Runners</b> have tight feathering. Drakes have a small curl on the tip of their tails, while hens have flat tails. It's difficult to determine their sex until they are fully mature.|$|R

50|$|The most {{profound}} {{impact of the}} <b>Indian</b> <b>Runners</b> was {{on the development of}} the modern 'light duck' breeds. Before 1900, most ducks were bred for the table. Aylesbury and Rouen ducks were famous throughout the nineteenth century, and these were supplemented or replaced, after 1873-74, by importation from China of the Pekin duck. As soon as the <b>Indian</b> <b>Runners</b> became fashionable, a demand for egg-layers and general purpose breeds developed. Using Runners crossed to Rouens, Aylesburys and Cayugas (the large black American breed), William Cook produced his famous Orpington Ducks. Mrs Campbell crossed her fawn-and-white <b>Runner</b> <b>duck</b> to a Rouen drake to create the Campbell ducks introduced in 1898. Later, she introduced wild mallard blood and managed to create the most prolific egg-layer, the Khaki Campbell (announced in 1901). Other breeds followed, some of which emerged as direct mutations of the Khaki Campbell, along with crosses back to <b>Indian</b> <b>Runners,</b> the most famous being the Abacot Ranger (known in Germany as the Streicher) and the Welsh Harlequin. Currently there are eight varieties of <b>Indian</b> <b>Runner</b> recognized with the American Poultry Association. They are, in order of recognition, Fawn & White, White Penciled, Black, Buff, Chocolate, Cumberland Blue and Gray.|$|R
