5|$|On June 24, 1898, Morrow enlisted as {{a private}} in the 4th Kentucky Infantry Regiment for service in the Spanish–American War. He was first {{stationed}} at Lexington, Kentucky, and later trained at Anniston, Alabama. Due to a bout with typhoid fever, <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> active duty, and mustered out as a second lieutenant on February 12, 1899. In 1900, he matriculated for the fall semester at the University of Cincinnati Law School. He graduated with a Bachelor of Laws degree in 1902.|$|E
5|$|The seven-week trial {{included}} {{the testimony of}} 366 witnesses. All of the defendants were found guilty on June 30. Mary Surratt, Lewis Powell, David Herold, and George Atzerodt were sentenced to death by hanging; Samuel Mudd, Samuel Arnold, and Michael O'Laughlen were {{sentenced to life in}} prison. Edmund Spangler was sentenced to six years. After sentencing Mary Surratt to hang, five jurors signed a letter recommending clemency, but Johnson refused to stop the execution; he later claimed <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> the letter.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of the court-martial in August 1944, the charges against Robinson had been reduced to two counts of insubordination during questioning. Robinson was acquitted by an all-white panel of nine officers. The {{experiences}} Robinson was subjected to during the court proceedings would be remembered when he later joined MLB and was subjected to racist attacks. Although his former unit, the 761st Tank Battalion, became the first black tank unit to see combat in World War II, Robinson's court-martial proceedings prohibited him from being deployed overseas; thus, <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> combat action.|$|E

5|$|In an {{interview}} with Aphrodite Jones, Patrick Treacy, a cosmetic surgeon who treated Jackson between July 2006 and early 2007, as well as shortly before his death, stated {{that he would have}} known if Jackson would have been also treated by another physician and that <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> any drugs in the house. He also said that Jackson did not have insomnia and never asked him for narcotics. Treacy stated Jackson was in good physical health; he said Jackson always insisted on the presence of an anesthetist when Propofol was administered.|$|E
5|$|Prior to his arrest, Chandler {{worked as}} an {{unlicensed}} aluminum-siding contractor. He testified in his own defense, {{against the advice of}} his attorneys, saying that he had met the Ohio women and had given them directions, but that <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> them again aside from in newspaper coverage and on the billboards set up by authorities. Police originally theorized that two men were involved in the murders, but this was discounted once Chandler was arrested. Following his conviction, Chandler was incarcerated at Union Correctional Institution, and, during his seventeen years of incarceration until his execution, he was notable for not having had a single visitor.|$|E
5|$|Before long, Chadwick gave Rotblat a {{fellowship}} (the Oliver Lodge Fellowship), doubling his income, {{and in that}} summer of 1939 the young Pole returned home, intending to bring Tola back with him. When {{the time came to}} leave Warsaw in late August, however, she was ill following an operation for appendicitis, and remained behind, expecting to follow within days; but the outbreak of war brought calamity. Tola was trapped, and desperate efforts in the ensuing months to bring her out through Denmark (with the help of Niels Bohr), Belgium, and finally Italy came to nothing, as each country in turn was closed off by the war. <b>He</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> her again; she died in the Holocaust at the Belzec concentration camp. This affected him deeply {{for the rest of his}} life, and he never remarried.|$|E
50|$|Birotronics USA {{director}} of sales and marketing, Ed Cohen states that even back in the '70s <b>he</b> <b>never</b> even <b>saw</b> any B-90 Birotrons himself, and that he used flyers and descriptions of the machine when making sales presentations in America.|$|R

5000|$|<b>He</b> <b>never</b> again <b>saw</b> active service, but was {{promoted}} Lieutenant General in 1825 and full General in 1843. He {{had held the}} sinecure post of Lieutenant Governor of Dumbarton Castle since April, 1814, and became Colonel of the 69th Foot in 1836.|$|R
5|$|Bormann's {{studies at}} an {{agricultural}} trade high school were interrupted {{when he joined}} the 55th Field Artillery Regiment as a gunner in June 1918, in the last days of World War I. <b>He</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> action, but served garrison duty until February 1919. After working a short time in a cattle feed mill, Bormann became estate manager of a large farm in Mecklenburg. Shortly after starting work at the estate, Bormann joined an antisemitic landowners association. While hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic meant that money was worthless, foodstuffs stored on farms and estates became ever more valuable. Many estates, including Bormann's, had Freikorps units stationed on site to guard the crops from pillaging. Bormann joined the Freikorps organisation headed by Gerhard Roßbach in 1922, acting as section leader and treasurer.|$|E
5|$|Later, {{when another}} fan tried {{to climb the}} stage, Blythe {{thought that it was}} Pořádek again. Blythe testified that he {{approached}} the fan and pushed him with both hands out of the stage in the belief that the crowd would catch him, which it did not. Jiří Choroš, author of video which caught the previous incidents with Pořádek, testified that the fan was for a moment lying on the ground with nobody helping him. Blythe further commented that he saw the fan get up and that other fans showed him thumbs up. Blythe insisted that <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> Nosek nor came into contact with him. It was not until the arrest two years later that he found out about Nosek's death.|$|E
5|$|Kirk {{moves out}} of the Van Houten house and manages to keep a cheery {{attitude}} until he is fired from {{his job at the}} cracker factory. Luann quickly readjusts to single life with Milhouse and starts a new relationship with an American Gladiator. While at Moe's, Kirk mentions that <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> the divorce coming and regrets not being more sensitive to Luann's needs. Homer cheers Kirk up by telling him that his marriage to Marge is solid, but Homer soon begins to fear that his marriage may end in divorce. Homer enlists the aid of Lisa to help him figure out how to save his marriage, but Lisa tells Homer that he is lucky to have Marge. He recalls his wedding reception, which was nothing more than Homer and Marge eating a whale cake at a roadside truck stop. Homer tries to perform selfless gestures for Marge, but they only serve to annoy her.|$|E
60|$|MEPH.: Well, thank {{goodness}} <b>he's</b> gone. <b>Never</b> <b>saw</b> such a fearful old bore in my life. Can't think why {{you let him}} hang on to you so. We may as well make a night of it now, eh? No use your trying to work {{at this time of}} night.|$|R

50|$|During his voyage, Hari Ram {{had opened}} up 30,000 square miles (78,000 km²) of {{virtually}} unknown territory. He had travelled {{all the way around}} Mount Everest, but because other mountains stood in between, <b>he</b> <b>never</b> actually <b>saw</b> it. On a second journey, Hari Ram traversed northern Nepal from west to east.|$|R
5|$|As {{a result}} of his actions at Broodseinde, McGee was awarded the Victoria Cross, one of two Australians to be so {{decorated}} that day. However, <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> the announcement of the award. On 12 October 1917—eight days after McGee's Victoria Cross action—the 40th Battalion returned to the frontline, in an attempt to exploit the success of the previous week. The battlefield was drenched in rain, turning the ground into a quagmire that was additionally dominated by several German pillboxes. McGee—who had been appointed acting company sergeant major of B Company that morning—led his unit into the attack. As the men of the company advanced forward, a machine gun began firing upon them from the front, before a second opened up on their flank. Men ran to take cover in shellholes as the German fire inflicted several casualties. McGee, however, made a rush towards the guns in an apparent effort to silence them. As he ran towards the pillbox, a bullet struck him in the head, killing him instantly. McGee was later buried in Tyne Cot Cemetery; he was one of 248 members of the 40th Battalion killed or wounded during the Battle of Passchendaele. McGee's fellow Australian Victoria Cross recipient from Broodseinde, Lance Corporal Walter Peeler, was also severely wounded on this day, receiving a bullet wound to his arm.|$|E
5|$|At {{his trial}} in Clearwater, Florida, Chandler {{said that he}} met the Rogers women and gave them directions, but <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> them again except in {{newspaper}} coverage and on billboards. He never told the authorities {{that he had seen}} the women again. He acknowledged that he was on Tampa Bay that nightthe police had evidence of three ship-to-shore telephone calls made from his boat to his home during the time frame of the murdersbut Chandler maintained that he was fishing alone. He claimed that he had returned home late because his engine would not start, which he attributed to a gas line leak. He said that he had called the Coast Guard and the Florida Marine Patrol, and had flagged down a patrol boat, but both were too busy to help. He said that he subsequently fixed the line with duct tape and returned safely to shore. However, there were no records of distress calls from Chandler to either the Coast Guard or the Marine Patrol that night, nor were there any Coast Guard boats on the bay the following morning that could have helped him. According to a boat mechanic, who testified for the prosecution, Chandler's explanation of repairing the boat's alleged gas leak was not tenable because the fuel lines in his boata Baylinerwere directed upward. A leak would have sprayed fuel into the air rather than into the boat, and the corrosive gasoline would have eaten away the adhesive properties of the duct tape Chandler maintained he had used to repair the purported leak. Under interrogation from Pinellas County prosecutor, Douglas Crow, Chandler then said he could not remember.|$|E
5|$|Many {{actors were}} {{considered}} to replace Reeves including: Simon Baker Denny, Jon Bon Jovi, Patrick Muldoon, Johnathon Schaech, Christian Slater, and Billy Zane. Bullock initially suggested Matthew McConaughey, who passed on the role, prompting her to suggest Jason Patric, {{with whom she had}} wanted to work since seeing his performance in After Dark, My Sweet (1990). De Bont was skeptical of featuring a relatively unknown actor such as Patric, but was reminded by the studio that Bullock and Reeves were also relatively unknown prior to Speed, and ultimately chose Patric based on his role in Sleepers (1996). Patric was paid a reported $4.5–$8 million for his role in Speed2 and used his salary to finance a 1998 drama, Your Friends & Neighbors. After accepting the role, Patric stated that <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> Speed or had any intentions of seeing it; Reeves said he was looking forward to seeing Patric star in the sequel. After Reeves declined to appear in Speed2, the screenplay was rewritten to remove his character from the story, which De Bont wanted to deal with early in the film. His absence is explained in the first scene, where Annie talks about how her relationship with Jack did not work out, and mentions her current relationship with Alex (Patric), before his character is introduced in the film.|$|E
50|$|Lucan evidently escaped {{blame for}} the charge, as he was made {{a member of the}} Order of the Bath in July of that same year. Although <b>he</b> <b>never</b> again <b>saw</b> active duty, he reached the rank of general in 1865 and was made a field marshal in the year before his death.|$|R

60|$|But Stout {{could do}} more than listen and admire. He was cook to the {{establishment}} during my visit. The men took this duty by turns--each for a fortnight--and Stout excelled the others. It was he {{who knew how to}} extract sweet music from the tea-kettle and the frying-pan! But Stout's forte was buttered toast! He was quite an adept at the formation of this luxury. If I remember rightly, it was an entire loaf that Stout cut up and toasted each morning for breakfast. He knew nothing of delicate treatment. Every slice was an inch thick at the least! It was quite a study to see him go to work. <b>He</b> <b>never</b> <b>sawed</b> with the knife. Having a powerful hand and arm, one sweep of the blade sufficed for one slice, and he cut up the whole loaf before beginning to toast. Then, he always had the fire well prepared. You <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> alternate stripes of black and white on Stout's toast; and he laid on the butter as he might have laid tar {{on the side of a}} ship, thick and heavy. <b>He</b> <b>never</b> scraped it off one part to put it on another--and <b>he</b> <b>never</b> picked the lumps out of the holes. Truly, Stout was quite a genius in this matter.|$|R
25|$|In 1943, O'Neill disowned his {{daughter}} Oona for marrying the English actor, director, and producer Charlie Chaplin {{when she was}} 18 and Chaplin was 54. <b>He</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> Oona again.|$|E

25|$|Kyle's hiring {{may be due}} to {{the fact}} that Brian Mitchell, who Kyle studied over the summer, was the owner of the studio.
