25|$|Ovarian <b>hyper{{stimulation}}</b> is {{the stimulation}} to induce development of multiple follicles of the ovaries. It should start with response prediction by e.g. age, antral follicle count {{and level of}} anti-Müllerian hormone. The resulting prediction of e.g. poor or hyper-response to ovarian <b>hyperstimulation</b> determines the protocol and dosage for ovarian <b>hyperstimulation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Ovarian <b>hyperstimulation</b> also {{includes}} suppression of spontaneous ovulation, for which two main methods are available: Using a (usually longer) GnRH agonist protocol or a (usually shorter) GnRH antagonist protocol. In a standard long GnRH agonist protocol {{the day when}} <b>hyperstimulation</b> treatment is started and the expected day of later oocyte retrieval can be chosen to conform to personal choice, while in a GnRH antagonist protocol it must be adapted to the spontaneous onset of the previous menstruation. On the other hand, the GnRH antagonist protocol has a lower risk of ovarian <b>hyperstimulation</b> syndrome (OHSS), which is a life-threatening complication.|$|E
25|$|IVF using {{no drugs}} for ovarian <b>hyperstimulation</b> was the method for the {{conception}} of Louise Brown. This method can be successfully used when women want to avoid taking ovarian stimulating drugs with its associated side-effects. HFEA has estimated the live birth rate to be approximately 1.3% per IVF cycle using no <b>hyperstimulation</b> drugs for women aged between 40–42.|$|E
25|$|All {{cervical}} ripening and induction agents {{can cause}} uterine <b>hyperstimulation,</b> which can negatively affect {{the blood supply}} to the fetus and {{increases the risk of}} complications such as uterine rupture. Concern has been raised that uterine <b>hyperstimulation</b> that occurs during a misoprostol-induced labor is more difficult to treat than <b>hyperstimulation</b> during labors induced by other drugs. Because the complications are rare, {{it is difficult to determine}} if misoprostol causes a higher risk than do other cervical ripening agents. One estimate is that it would require around 61,000 people enrolled in randomized controlled trials to detect a difference in serious fetal complications and about 155,000 people to detect a difference in serious maternal complications.|$|E

25|$|IVF using ovarian <b>hyperstimulation,</b> {{including}} gonadotropins, {{but with}} a GnRH antagonist protocol so that the cycle initiates from natural mechanisms.|$|E
25|$|Frozen embryo transfer; IVF using ovarian <b>hyperstimulation,</b> {{followed}} by embryo cryopreservation, {{followed by}} embryo transfer in a later, natural, cycle.|$|E
25|$|Larger {{bilateral}} cysts {{can develop}} {{as a result}} of fertility treatment due to elevated levels of HCG, as can be seen with the use of clomifene for follicular induction, in extreme cases resulting in a condition known as ovarian <b>hyperstimulation</b> syndrome. Certain malignancies can mimic the effects of clomifene on the ovaries, also due to increased HCG, in particular gestational trophoblastic disease. Ovarian <b>hyperstimulation</b> occurs more often with invasive moles and choriocarcinoma than complete molar pregnancies.|$|E
25|$|For {{women not}} {{responsive}} to clomiphene and diet and lifestyle modification, there are options available including assisted reproductive technology procedures such as controlled ovarian <b>hyperstimulation</b> with follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) injections followed by {{in vitro fertilisation}} (IVF).|$|E
25|$|For the ovarian <b>hyperstimulation</b> in itself, {{injectable}} gonadotropins (usually FSH analogues) {{are generally}} used under close monitoring. Such monitoring frequently checks the estradiol level and, {{by means of}} gynecologic ultrasonography, follicular growth. Typically approximately 10 days of injections will be necessary.|$|E
25|$|Sampling of cumulus {{cells can}} be {{performed}} {{in addition to a}} sampling of polar bodies or cells from the embryo. Because of the molecular interactions between cumulus cells and the oocyte, gene expression profiling of cumulus cells {{can be performed}} to estimate oocyte quality and the efficiency of an ovarian <b>hyperstimulation</b> protocol, and may indirectly predict aneuploidy, embryo development and pregnancy outcomes.|$|E
25|$|A second {{important}} {{concern is}} the appropriate source of the eggs that are needed. SCNT requires human eggs, {{which can only be}} obtained from women. The most common source of these eggs today are eggs that are produced and in excess of the clinical need during IVF treatment. This is a minimally invasive procedure, but it does carry some health risks, such as ovarian <b>hyperstimulation</b> syndrome.|$|E
25|$|The risk of {{twin birth}} can vary {{depending}} on what types of fertility treatments are used. With in vitro fertilisation (IVF), this is primarily due to the insertion of multiple embryos into the uterus. Ovarian <b>hyperstimulation</b> without IVF has a very high risk of multiple birth. Reversal of anovulation with clomifene (trade names including Clomid) has a relatively less but yet significant risk of multiple pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|For frozen-thawed embryo {{transfer}} or transfer of embryo from egg donation, no previous ovarian <b>hyperstimulation</b> {{is required for}} the recipient before transfer, which can be performed in spontaneous ovulatory cycles. Still, various protocols exist for frozen-thawed {{embryo transfer}}s as well, such as protocols with ovarian <b>hyperstimulation,</b> protocols in which the endometrium is artificially prepared by estrogen and/or progesterone. A Cochrane review in 2010 of randomized studies came to the result that there generally is insufficient evidence to support the use of one intervention in preference to another, but with some evidence that in cycles where the endometrium is artificially prepared by estrogen or progesterone, it is beneficial to administer an additional drug that suppresses hormone production by the ovaries such as continuous administration of a gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa). For egg donation, there is evidence of a lower pregnancy rate and a higher cycle cancellation rate when the progesterone supplementation in the recipient is commenced prior to oocyte retrieval from the donor, as compared to commenced day of oocyte retrieval or the day after.|$|E
25|$|A risk {{of ovarian}} {{stimulation}} {{is the development}} of ovarian <b>hyperstimulation</b> syndrome, particularly if hCG is used for inducing final oocyte maturation. This results in swollen, painful ovaries. It occurs in 30% of patients. Mild cases can be treated with over the counter medications and cases can be resolved in the absence of pregnancy. In moderate cases, ovaries swell and fluid accumulated in the abdominal cavities and may have symptoms of heartburn, gas, nausea or loss of appetite. In severe cases patients have sudden excess abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and will result in hospitalisation.|$|E
25|$|Theoretically, IVF {{could be}} {{performed}} by collecting the contents from a woman's fallopian tubes or uterus after natural ovulation, mixing it with sperm, and reinserting the fertilised ova into the uterus. However, without additional techniques, the chances of pregnancy would be extremely small. The additional techniques that are routinely used in IVF include ovarian <b>hyperstimulation</b> to generate multiple eggs or ultrasound-guided transvaginal oocyte retrieval directly from the ovaries; after which the ova and sperm are prepared, as well as culture and selection of resultant embryos before embryo transfer into a uterus.|$|E
2500|$|When the ovarian follicles {{have reached}} {{a certain degree of}} development, {{induction}} of final oocyte maturation is performed, generally by an injection of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Commonly, this is known as the [...] "trigger shot." [...] hCG acts as an analogue of luteinising hormone, and ovulation would occur between 38 and 40 hours after a single HCG injection, but the egg retrieval is performed at a time usually between 34 and 36 hours after hCG injection, that is, just prior to when the follicles would rupture. This avails for scheduling the egg retrieval procedure at a time where the eggs are fully mature. HCG injection confers a risk of ovarian <b>hyperstimulation</b> syndrome. Using a GnRH agonist instead of hCG eliminates most of the risk of ovarian <b>hyperstimulation</b> syndrome, but with a reduced delivery rate if the embryos are transferred fresh. [...] For this reason, many centers will freeze all oocytes or embryos following agonist trigger.|$|E
2500|$|Embryos can {{be either}} “fresh” from fertilized egg cells of the same menstrual cycle, or “frozen”, that is they have been {{generated}} in a preceding cycle and undergone embryo cryopreservation, and are thawed {{just prior to the}} transfer, which is then termed [...] "frozen embryo transfer" [...] (FET). The outcome from using cryopreserved embryos has uniformly been positive with no increase in birth defects or development abnormalities, also between fresh versus frozen eggs used for intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). In fact, pregnancy rates are increased following FET, and perinatal outcomes are less affected, compared to embryo transfer in the same cycle as ovarian <b>hyperstimulation</b> was performed. The endometrium is believed to not be optimally prepared for implantation following ovarian <b>hyperstimulation,</b> and therefore frozen embryo transfer avails for a separate cycle to focus on optimizing the chances of successful implantation. Children born from vitrified blastocysts have significantly higher birthweight than those born from non-frozen blastocysts. When transferring a frozen-thawed oocyte, the chance of pregnancy is essentially the same whether it is transferred in a natural cycle or one with ovulation induction.|$|E
2500|$|The {{deficiency}} {{results in}} impaired synthesis {{of all three}} categories of adrenal steroids (cortisol, mineralocorticoids, sex steroids) {{and high levels of}} adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). A low level of steroid synthesis proceeds even without efficient transport, but is rarely enough to prevent the consequences of deficiency. [...] While severe loss of steroid production results in manifestation of the disease within a few weeks of birth, milder forms (late onset) can present years after birth. Unlike in models of the disease in mice, patients with lipoid CAH do not always have enlarged adrenals due to lipid accumulation. [...] This may in part be due to hormone replacement used to keep them alive preventing <b>hyperstimulation</b> of the gland by the pituitary.|$|E
50|$|The <b>hyperstimulation</b> of {{the ovaries}} in {{practices}} like IVF {{can result in}} mild ovarian <b>hyperstimulation</b> syndrome (OHSS) in more than 20% of cases. This same <b>hyperstimulation</b> can cause severe OHSS in up to 2% of cases. OHSS can have serious consequences, including respiratory problems, renal impairment and even stroke.|$|E

50|$|Coasting, {{which is}} ovarian <b>hyperstimulation</b> without {{induction}} of final maturation, does not significantly decrease {{the risk of}} ovarian <b>hyperstimulation</b> syndrome (OHSS), according to a Cochrane review of randomized trials.|$|E
50|$|In contrast, when {{referring}} to treating menstrual disorders, such as oligoovulation or anovulation, the preferred term is ovulation induction. In this article, unless otherwise specified, <b>hyperstimulation</b> will refer to <b>hyperstimulation</b> as part of IVF.|$|E
50|$|Embryo {{cryopreservation}} {{is generally}} performed {{as a component}} of in vitro fertilization (which generally also includes ovarian <b>hyperstimulation,</b> egg retrieval and embryo transfer). The ovarian <b>hyperstimulation</b> is preferably done by using a GnRH agonist rather than human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) for final oocyte maturation, since it decreases the risk of ovarian <b>hyperstimulation</b> syndrome with no evidence of a difference in live birth rate (in contrast to fresh cycles where usage of GnRH agonist has a lower live birth rate).|$|E
50|$|IVF {{without the}} use any ovarian <b>hyperstimulation</b> drugs.|$|E
50|$|GnRH agonist, {{resulting}} in an elimination {{of the risk of}} ovarian <b>hyperstimulation</b> syndrome. In in vitro fertilization, the delivery rate is approximately 6% less than with hCG triggering. Using GnRH agonist for final maturation and/or release necessitates using a GnRH antagonist protocol for suppression of ovulation during ovarian <b>hyperstimulation.</b>|$|E
50|$|Luteinizing hormone (LH) in {{addition}} to FSH has evidence of increased pregnancy rate, but not of live birth rate. Using low dose human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) to replace FSH during the late follicular phase in women undergoing <b>hyperstimulation</b> as part of IVF {{does not seem to}} reduce the chances of ongoing and clinical pregnancy, and likely results in an equivalent number of oocytes retrieved, but with less expenditure of FSH. Administration of progestogen before <b>hyperstimulation</b> has evidence of improved pregnancy outcomes, while that of combined oral contraceptive pills before <b>hyperstimulation</b> has poorer pregnancy outcomes.|$|E

50|$|According to NICE {{guidelines}} of in vitro fertilization, an anti-Müllerian hormone level {{of less than}} or equal to 5.4 pmol/l (0.8 ng/mL) predicts a low response to ovarian <b>hyperstimulation,</b> while a level greater than or equal to 25.0 pmol/l (3.6 ng/mL) predicts a high response. Other cut-off values found in the literature vary between 0.7 and 20 pmol/l (0.1 and 2.97 ng/ml) for low response to ovarian <b>hyperstimulation.</b> Subsequently, higher AMH levels are associated with greater chance of live birth after IVF, even after adjusting for age. AMH can thereby be used to rationalise the programme of ovulation induction and decisions about the number of embryos to transfer in assisted reproduction techniques to maximise pregnancy success rates whilst minimising the risk of ovarian <b>hyperstimulation</b> syndrome (OHSS). AMH can predict an excessive response in ovarian <b>hyperstimulation</b> with a sensitivity and specificity of 82% and 76%, respectively.|$|E
