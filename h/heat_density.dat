Initial <b>heat</b> flux <b>densities</b> were evaluated for cylindrical specimens on the basis of CFD modeling during intensive quenching. It is shown that initial <b>heat</b> flux <b>densities</b> are significantly less as compared with the critical <b>heat</b> flux <b>densities.</b> That is why there is no film boiling in these conditions.

A numerical model was used to solve the governing equations that describe the temperature and flow fields and an optimization algorithm was used to find the optimal structure for flow configurations with two or more degrees of freedom. The geometric structure of the consecutive cylinders was optimized for each flow regime (Rayleigh number) and cylinder rotation speed for one and two degrees of freedom. Smaller cylinders were placed {{at the entrance to the}} assembly, in the wedge-shaped flow regions occupied by fluid that had not yet been used for heat transfer, to create additional length scales to the flow configuration. It was found that the optimized spacing decreases and the <b>heat</b> transfer <b>density</b> rate increases as the Rayleigh number increases, for the optimized structure.

50|$|If {{the heating}} process is {{relatively}} slow, the liquid has {{enough time to}} relax to an equilibrium state and the liquid follows the binodal curve, the Clausius-Clapeyron relation is still valid. During this time heterogeneous evaporation occurs in the substance with bubbles nucleating from impurity sites, surfaces, grain boundaries etc. On the other hand, if the heating process is fast enough that the substance cannot reach binodal curve through heterogeneous boiling, the liquid becomes superheated with its temperature above boiling point at a given pressure. System then shifts away from the binodal and continues to follow the red curve and thus approaches towards spinodal. Near the critical temperature thermodynamic properties like specific <b>heat,</b> <b>density</b> varies rapidly as shown on the figure at right. Density and entropy undergoes largest fluctuation. During this time {{it is possible to}} have a large density fluctuation in a very small volume. This fluctuation of density results in the nucleation of a bubble. The bubble nucleation process occurs homogeneously everywhere in the substance. The rate of bubble nucleation and vapor sphere growth rate increases exponentially closer to the critical temperature. The increasing nucleation prevents the system from going to the spinodal. When the bubble radius reaches the critical size it continues to expand and eventually explodes resulting a mixture of gas and droplets which is termed as explosive boiling or phase explosion.|$|E

Such a situation would be broken down first into a system, which in this case would include the entire surface of the body. Assuming the individual is submerged in cold water up to the neck and ears, or otherwise surrounded by an environment that can be modeled as a temperature sink, the engineering would model the body as a composite system composed of skin, fat, muscle bone and possibly organs depending on how complex the model must be. The head could be considered a separate system connected to the body via a third major system, the vasculature. The vasculature would bring cooled blood from the submerged body to the brain where there would be some amount of conductive and convection heat transfer based on the passage of blood through the vessels cooling the vessel via forced convection and the subsequent cooling of the brain via conduction between blood vessel and brain tissue. Each of these heat transfer processes i.e. water to body, body to vasculature, and vasculature to brain would require knowledge of the thermal conductivity, specific <b>heat,</b> <b>density,</b> blood perfusion rate, and diameter of blood vessel at the least to predict the temperature history at any point within the body e.g. to know when the temperature at the center of the head trauma reaches 32 °C.|$|E
