Some officials approached Zhuge Liang, another of Liu Bei's key advisers, and urged him to report Fa Zheng's lawless behaviour to their lord and take action against him. However, Zhuge Liang replied, [...] "When our lord was in Gong'an, he was wary of Cao Cao's influence {{in the north and}} fearful of Sun Quan's presence in the east. Even <b>in</b> <b>home</b> <b>territory</b> he was afraid that Lady Sun might stir up trouble. He was in such a difficult situation {{at the time that he}} could neither advance nor retreat. Fa Xiaozhi supported and helped him so much, such that he is now able to fly high and no longer remain under others' influence. How can we stop Fa Zheng from behaving as he wishes?" [...] Zhuge Liang was aware that Liu Bei favoured and trusted Fa Zheng, which was why he refused to intervene in this matter.|$|E

After winning in Detroit, Rosberg then won his 5th and last Grand Prix at the last race of the season in Adelaide for the first ever World Championship Australian Grand Prix (Williams had previously won the non-championship AGP in 1980 with that year's World Drivers' Champion Alan Jones driving the Cosworth DFV powered Williams FW07B).|$|E
5000|$|Sometime in 209, Lady Sun {{married the}} warlord Liu Bei to {{strengthen}} an alliance between Liu Bei and Sun Quan. The marriage probably {{took place at}} Gong'an County because Gong'an County was the provincial capital of Jing Province and Liu Bei was nominally serving as the provincial governor at the time. Lady Sun {{was known to be}} wise and shrewd, and tough and fierce in character, very much like her brother Sun Quan. She had more than a hundred female servants, all of whom carried swords and stood guard outside her room. Whenever Liu Bei entered her room, he felt a chill in his heart. Liu Bei was also suspicious and fearful of Lady Sun. Liu Bei's adviser Zhuge Liang once said, [...] "When our lord (Liu Bei) was in Gong'an, he dreaded Cao Cao's influence in the north and feared Sun Quan's presence in the east. Even <b>in</b> <b>home</b> <b>territory</b> he was afraid that Lady Sun would cause trouble." ...|$|E

5000|$|In 1984, Scholastic {{published}} Bannercatch for the Apple II and Commodore computers. An edutainment {{game with}} recognizable capture-the-flag mechanics, Bannercatch allows {{up to two}} humans (each alternating between two characters in the game world) to play capture the flag against an increasingly difficult team of four AI bots. Bannercatchs game world is divided into quadrants: home, enemy, and two [...] "no-mans land" [...] areas which hold the jails. A successful capture requires bringing the enemy flag into one team's [...] "home" [...] quadrant. Players can be captured when in an enemy territory, or in [...] "no-mans land" [...] while holding a flag. Captured players must be [...] "rescued" [...] from their designated jail {{by one of the}} other members of the team. Fallen flags remain where they dropped until a time-out period elapses, after which the flag returns to one of several starting locations <b>in</b> <b>home</b> <b>territory.</b> The 2D map also features walls, trees and a moving river, enabling a wide variety of strategies. Special locations in the play area allow humans to query the game state (such as flag status) using binary messages.|$|E
40|$|Islamic {{funds are}} an {{upcoming}} alternative to conventional funds, {{aided by the}} increasing prominence of Islamic finance. This paper contributes to the extant literature by comparing the performance of Islamic and conventional funds during crisis and recovery periods. In contrast to most previous literature, {{we focus on the}} countries of the Middle East and North African region (MENA), which represent an appealing context to study both from a financial and socioeconomic point of view due to recent events in the area. To this end, we consider a linear model control- ling for the bias of omitting relevant benchmarks. Although this methodology is now widely accepted in the financial literature, it is less common when evaluating Islamic mutual funds, but it is particularly appropriate when the aim is to focus on markets where Shariah-compliant investments are <b>in</b> <b>home</b> <b>territory.</b> Our results show that the relative performance of Islamic and conventional funds must be tempered by several factors such as the (geographical) context in which the investment is made. Considering all the MENA region, Islamic funds perform, on average, slightly worse than conventional funds. However, if the analysis is restricted to GCC countries, the result is the opposite. This evidence holds for both crisis and recovery periods. In addition, the performance gap between the two types of funds either widens or shrinks when considering recovery or crisis times, reinforcing the views that Islamic funds are more stable in hazardous time...|$|E
