5|$|The Nama {{assemblage}} is best {{represented in}} Namibia. Three-dimensional preservation is most common, with organisms preserved in sandy beds containing internal bedding. Dima Grazhdankin believes that these fossils represent burrowing organisms, while Guy Narbonne maintains they were surface dwellers. These beds are sandwiched between units comprising interbedded sandstones, siltstones and shales – with microbial mats, where present, usually containing the fossils. The environment is interpreted as sand bars formed {{at the mouth}} of a delta's <b>distributaries.</b>|$|E
5|$|Rafting is also {{popular in}} some of the Canadian {{stretches}} of the river, especially those near the headwaters that have the steepest gradient and the most challenging rapids. Several Canadian outfitters provide trips on the river near Kootenay National Park ranging from a few hours to several days. Canoeing in the numerous sloughs, side-channels and <b>distributaries</b> of the Kootenay that thread through the wetlands of the Kootenay Flats has the additional benefit of watching birds and wildlife in the Creston Valley Wildlife Management Unit and other surrounding marshes. Larger craft such as houseboats are able to travel on Kootenay and Koocanusa Lakes. Rafting and kayaking is also an activity on the swift-flowing Slocan River, the lowermost major tributary of the Kootenay, and in parts of other major Kootenay tributaries as well.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to discuss shape, scale and {{superimposed}} types of sandy gravel bodies in sandy-gravel braided <b>distributary</b> channel. Lithofacies analysis, hierarchy bounding surface analysis and subsurface dense well pattern combining with outcrops method were used to examine reservoir architecture patterns of sandy gravel braided <b>distributary</b> channel based on cores, well logging, and outcrops data, and the reservoir architecture patterns of sandy gravel braided <b>distributary</b> channels in different grades have been established. The study shows: (1) The main reservoir architecture elements for sandy gravel braided channel delta are <b>distributary</b> channel and overbank sand, while reservoir flow barrier elements are interchannel and lacustrine mudstone. (2) The compound sand bodies in the sandy gravel braided delta <b>distributary</b> channel take on three shapes: sheet-like <b>distributary</b> channel sand body, interweave strip <b>distributary</b> channel sand body, single strip <b>distributary</b> channel sand body. (3) Identification marks of single <b>distributary</b> channel include: elevation of sand body top, lateral overlaying, “thick-thin-thick” feature of sand bodies, interchannel mudstone and overbank sand between <b>distributary</b> channels and the differences in well log curve shape of sand bodies. (4) Nine lithofacies types were distinguished in <b>distributary</b> channel unit interior, different channel units have different lithofacies association sequence...|$|R

25|$|The Tha Chin River is {{the major}} {{distributary}} of the Chao Phraya River. The expanse of the Chao Phraya and Tha Chin Rivers and their <b>distributaries,</b> starting at {{the point at which}} the <b>distributaries</b> diverge, together with the land amid the triangle formed by the outermost and innermost distributary, form the Chao Phraya delta. The many <b>distributaries</b> of the Chao Phraya delta are interconnected by canals that serve both for irrigation and for transportation.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} the rivers that flow inland from Australia's Great Dividing Range form <b>distributaries,</b> most of which flow only {{intermittently}} during times of high river levels and end in shallow lakes or simply peter out in the deserts. Yarriambiack Creek, which flows from the Wimmera River into Lake Coorong, and Tyrrell Creek, which flows from the Avoca River into Lake Tyrrell, are two <b>distributaries</b> in Victoria. The Narran River flows from the Balonne River in Queensland into Narran Lake in New South Wales.|$|E

25|$|Common {{terms to}} name {{individual}} river <b>distributaries</b> in English-speaking countries are arm and channel. They may {{refer to a}} distributary that does not rejoin the channel it has branched from (e.g., the North, Middle, and South Arms of the Fraser River, or the West Channel of the Mackenzie River), or to one that does (e.g. Annacis Channel and Annieville Channel of the Fraser River, separated by Annacis Island).|$|E

50|$|The {{name for}} the largest <b>distributary</b> of the Ganges in Bangladesh is the Padma River. When the Padma joins with the Jamuna River, the largest <b>distributary</b> of the Brahmaputra, and they join with the Meghna in Chandpur District, {{the result is the}} Lower Meghna.|$|R
25|$|A {{distributary}}, or a distributary channel, is {{a stream}} that branches off and flows {{away from a}} main stream channel. They are a common feature of river deltas. The phenomenon is known as river bifurcation. The opposite of a distributary is a tributary. <b>Distributaries</b> usually occur as a stream nears a lake or an ocean, but they can occur inland as well, such as on alluvial fans or when a tributary stream bifurcates as it nears its confluence with a larger stream. In some cases, a minor distributary can divert so much water from the main channel that it can become the main route.|$|E
25|$|The old and {{the most}} {{important}} part of the city is centred on a spit of land between the Kathajodi River and the Mahanadi River, bounded on the southeast by Old Jagannath Road. The city, being a part of the Cuttack Municipal Corporation consisting of 59 wards. Cuttack stretches from Phulnakhara across the Kathajodi in the south to Choudwar in north across the Birupa River, while in the east it begins at Kandarpur and runs west as far as Naraj. Four rivers including Mahanadi and its <b>distributaries</b> Kathajodi, Kuakhai, Birupa run through the city. Further Kathajodi is distributed into Devi and Biluakhai which often makes the geographical area look like fibrous roots.|$|E
25|$|In the upstream, above Belgorod, {{the river}} {{contains}} several dams and small reservoirs. In the downstream, after {{the confluence of}} the Wolf River (Volchiya River), there is Pechenihy Reservoir (volume 86km3) which supplies water to the city of Kiev. Below Pechenga Reservoir, Donets is fed by Udy and by its largest tributary Oskol. There the valley widens and contains numerous oxbow lakes in its floodplain. Within Ukraine, the river flows between the Cisdesna plateau and the Donets lowland. In its middle, the river is partly fed by the Dnieper River waters which are brought though the Dnieper–Donbas–Seversky Donets channels which provide water to the coal industry of the Donets Basin, usually called the Donbass. Near the Russian city of Donetsk (Rostov oblast), the river crosses the Donets Ridge and flows in a narrow valley with steep and rocky slopes. In the lower part of Donets lowland, the flow is interrupted by sluices and is slow. At the delta it splits into three <b>distributaries.</b>|$|E

25|$|Other {{symbols of}} Saint Petersburg include the weather vane {{in the shape}} of a small ship on top of the Admiralty's golden spire and the golden angel on top of the Peter and Paul Cathedral. The Palace Bridge drawn at night is yet another symbol of the city. Every night during the {{navigation}} period from April to November, 22 bridges across the Neva and main canals are drawn to let ships pass in and out of the Baltic Sea according to a schedule. It was not until 2004 that the first high bridge across the Neva, which does not need to be drawn, Big Obukhovsky Bridge, was opened. There are hundreds of smaller bridges in Saint Petersburg spanning across numerous canals and <b>distributaries</b> of the Neva, some of the most important of which are the Moika, Fontanka, Griboyedov Canal, Obvodny Canal, Karpovka and Smolenka. Due to the intricate web of canals, Saint Petersburg is often called Venice of the North. The rivers and canals in the city centre are lined with granite embankments. The embankments and bridges are separated from rivers and canals by granite or cast iron parapets.|$|E
500|$|Several streams {{serve as}} <b>distributaries</b> and tributaries of Cibolo Creek, and are {{included}} in the watershed. Balcones Creek, a [...] long stream that rises in Bandera County and acts as the boundary between Bexar and Kendall Counties, is a main tributary of Cibolo Creek that converges at the meeting of Bexar, Kendall and Bandera Counties. Tributaries in the lower watershed include Martinez Creek, a [...] long stream with a Mesquite tree-supporting bed of clay and sandy loam, located near Windcrest in eastern Bexar County; and Santa Clara Creek, [...] long and Elm Creek, [...] long, both streams in Guadalupe County near New Berlin that supports conifers along their shores. Additional tributaries include Alum Creek, and Elm Creek.|$|E
500|$|The {{drainage}} basin of Cibolo Creek {{is located in}} the lower reaches of the Cretaceous Glen Rose Formation along the southeastern edge of the Edwards Plateau. Many springs located in the upper and middle reaches of the watershed engage in karst activity in the limestone prevalent below the surface, forming such caves as Cascade Caverns and Natural Bridge Caverns. An exchange occurs between the stream and these numerous underground springs that serve as a recharge for the Edwards-Trinity aquifer system. This system provides drinking water for millions of people in the surrounding area. Near the recharge zone, <b>distributaries</b> of the creek have carved deep canyons in the landscape of the Texas Hill Country, forming {{what is known as the}} Cibolo Canyonlands. The Cibolo Nature Center claims [...] of the watershed, to protect the water quality from the hazards of rapid development and population growth.|$|E
5000|$|The Ghatampur <b>distributary</b> canal in the Ramganga {{irrigation}} {{project in}} the state of Uttar Pradesh, India, delivered an amount of water equal to 155% of the design discharge to the Kisarwal district canal near the head of the <b>distributary</b> and only 22% to the Bairampur district canal at the downstream end.|$|R
50|$|This {{process is}} {{also related to}} the <b>distributary</b> network of river {{channels}} that can be observed within a river delta. When the channel does this, some of its flow can remain in the abandoned channel.

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{describes}} {{the evolution of}} one <b>distributary</b> of the Danube Delta (the St. George <b>distributary)</b> over the last 30 years by use of topographic maps as well as aerial and satellite images transformed and georeferrenced in a geographic information system (GIS). By analysing a multitude of parameters the authors intend to assess the changes in channel and meanders morphology induced by human intervention in the drainage basin of the Danube River and in its delta in the early 80 s. The anthropogenic changes (damming of the river, cut-offs of the <b>distributary</b> meanders within the delta area) have significantly altered the hydraulic and sediment dynamics in the <b>distributary</b> resulting in diminished migration of meander belts, occurence of longitudinal sand bars, bathymetric changes. The natural channels of meanders and the newly cut channels evolve differently, fundamentally changing the sediment transport processes...|$|R
