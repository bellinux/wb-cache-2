40|$|We {{study the}} non-LTE (non local {{thermodynamic}} equilibrium) formation of Li I {{lines in the}} spectra of cool stars for a grid of radiative-equilibrium model atmospheres with variation in effective temperature, gravity, metallicity and lithium abundance. We analyze the mechanisms by which departures from LTE (local thermodynamic equilibrium) arise for Li I lines, first for the young sun (prior to its lithium depletion) and then across the cool-star grid. There are various mechanisms which compete in their effects on emergent Li I line strengths. Their neglect produces errors in lithium abundance determinations that vary in sign as well as size, both across the stellar grid and between different Li I lines (<b>Figs).</b> The <b>errors</b> are appreciable for all cooler stars and largest for cool lithium-rich metal-poor giants.

Detector resolution independent photon corrections reduce the vector radius by about one percent. The scalar radius of the neutral pion is reduced by two percent by isospin-breaking contributions.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we compare data to theory. We use a {{compilation}} {{of the most recent}} cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements to constrain Hubble's constant h, the baryon fraction Omega_b, and the cosmological constant lambda. We fit h-, Omega_b- and lambda-dependent power spectra to the data. The models we consider are flat cold dark matter (CDM) dominated universes with flat (n= 1) power spectra, thus the results obtained apply only to these models. CMB observations can exclude {{more than half of the}} h - Omega_b parameter space explored. The CMB data favor low values of Hubble's constant; h ≈ 0. 35. Low values of Omega_b are preferred (Omega_b 0. 03) but the chi-squared minimum is shallow and we obtain Omega_b < 0. 28. A model with h ≈ 0. 40, Omega_b ≈ 0. 15 and Omega_CDM ≈ 0. 85 is permitted by constraints from the CMB data, BBN, cluster baryon fractions and the shape parameter Gamma derived from the mass density power spectra of galaxies and clusters. For flat-lambda models, the CMB data, combined with BBN constraints exclude most of the h - lambda plane. Models with Omega_o ≈ 0. 3, lambda ≈ 0. 7 with h ≈ 0. 75 are fully consistent with the CMB data but are excluded by the strict new q_o limits from supernovae (Perlmutter et al. 1996). A combination of CMB data goodness-of-fit statistics, BBN and supernovae constraints in the h-lambda plane, limits Hubble's constant to the interval 0. 23 < h < 0. 72.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of {{experimental}} and theoretical investigations in power losses of high current cables when loaded with symmetrical three phase current. Measurements on various conductor arrangements were done at room temperature (300 K) and at liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K). These studies were performed {{in order to test}} simple calculation methods on their applicability when conductor cross section or conductivity are very high and to suggest improvements of the methods if necessary. By cooling with liquid nitrogen (LN_ 2) it is possible to measure effects already at low conductor cross section which occur at normal temperature only when cross sections are very large. The very simple "cryostat" for the cooling fluid was made from polyurethane-foam blocks and tightened by two layers of polyester-foil. Its length was about 15, metres. The cables were arranged in symmetrical triangular (trefoil) form and bonded at the ends by welding or hard soldering. The a. c. -resistance was measured by a complex a. c. compensator. Measurements according to the well known method of measuring power consumption of a three phase system with two Wattmeters (Aron circuitry) gave the most reliable results.
