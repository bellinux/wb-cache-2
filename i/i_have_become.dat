500|$|In {{the late}} 1850s, French {{landscape}} painter Eugène Boudin (18241898) introduced Monet (18401926) {{to the art}} of painting en plein air—"in the open air", using natural light. The invention of the collapsible metal paint tube (1841) and portable easel brought painting, formerly confined to studios, into the outdoors. Boudin and Monet spent the summer of 1858 painting nature together. Like Boudin, Monet came to prefer painting outdoors rather than in a studio, the convention of the time. [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> a painter," [...] Monet said, [...] "I owe it to Boudin." ...|$|E
500|$|In July 2005, Jeff Gannon {{began writing}} editorials for the paper. His pieces {{included}} criticism of gay blogger John Aravosis, {{who had helped}} uncover Gannon's pornographic ads. Editor Chris Crain attracted his own criticism from many in the gay community for this decision, due to Gannon's history of anti-gay reporting as well as Gannon's refusal to disclose his sexual orientation. He has said, “My personal life is a private matter, {{despite the fact that}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> a public person.” Crain defended his decision in a September 2005 editorial and claimed the [...] "steady stream of feedback/vitriol" [...] had declined [...] "a little" [...] with each new Gannon article.|$|E
500|$|Emperor Francis [...] died on 18 August 1765, {{while he}} and the court were in Innsbruck celebrating the wedding of his second son, Leopold. Maria Theresa was devastated. Their eldest son, Joseph, became Holy Roman Emperor. Maria Theresa {{abandoned}} all ornamentation, had her hair cut short, painted her rooms black and dressed in mourning {{for the rest of}} her life. She completely withdrew from court life, public events, and theater. Throughout her widowhood, she spent the whole of August and the eighteenth of each month alone in her chamber, which negatively affected her mental health. She described her state of mind shortly after Francis's death: [...] "I hardly know myself now, for <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> like an animal with no true life or reasoning power." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{appearing}} as a recurring guest {{actor in the}} fifth season, actor Jonathan Pryce was promoted to regular cast member for the sixth season. Prior to being cast as the High Sparrow, Pryce was approached to play another role {{in one of the}} previous seasons and refused the part. After being approached with the role of the High Sparrow, Pryce stated that he accepted the role because [...] "If the role hadn't been what {{it turned out to be}} for High Sparrow, I probably would not have been involved. I remember starting out and my agent said 'does the character change the situation or is he just a functionary' and this character changes the situation." [...] Pryce added, [...] "Once I started work on Games of Thrones I was incredibly impressed with the organization, the crew and they're really good at their job and story telling so <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> a fan of the show." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the late}} 1920s and 1930s Kent Hughes {{developed}} a strong sympathy for fascism, encouraged {{in part by}} his uncle Ernest, who visited Italy in 1926 and published an enthusiastic report on Mussolini's Italy in a local newspaper on his return. Kent Hughes was also impressed by Sir Oswald Mosley's proposal for a British parliament consisting of business and national interests and headed by a powerful executive government. In 1933 he published {{a series of articles}} in the Melbourne Herald, titled [...] "Why <b>I</b> <b>Have</b> <b>Become</b> a Fascist." [...] In one article he wrote that fascism [...] "endeavours to avoid the egotistical attitude of laissez faire and the inertia of socialism." [...] Kent Hughes saw it as [...] "a half-way house between the two systems." [...] In fascist countries, he said, [...] "industrial peace and security {{have been found to be}} worth the price of sacrificing some of the individual liberty previously enjoyed." [...] In what he called [...] "British communities," [...] however, he expected that fascism would [...] "be garbed not in the dictatorial black shirt, but in the more sedate style of the British Parliamentary representative." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Academy also hosts {{an annual}} Royal Academy summer {{exhibition}} of new art, {{which is a}} well-known event on the London social calendar. In the 21st century it is considered less fashionable than in earlier centuries, and has been largely ignored by the Brit Artists and their patrons. But, Tracey Emin exhibited in the 2005 show. In March 2007 Emin accepted the Academy's invitation to become a Royal Academician, commenting in her weekly newspaper column that, [...] "It doesn't mean that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> more conformist; {{it means that the}} Royal Academy has become more open, which is healthy and brilliant." ...|$|E

At the age of fourteen {{he had to be}} withdrawn from school. After Cheltenham, Chamberlain always felt out of place in Britain, a society whose values Chamberlain felt were not his values, writing in 1876: [...] "The fact may be regrettable but it remains a fact; <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> so completely un-English that the mere thought of England and the English makes me unhappy". Chamberlain then travelled to various spas around Europe, accompanied by a Prussian tutor, Herr Otto Kuntze, who taught him German and interested him in German culture and history. Fascinated by Renaissance art and architecture, Chamberlain learned Italian and planned to settle in Florence for a time.|$|E

2500|$|At present, I am {{particularly}} {{excited by}} [...] "bad taste."

[...] I wish to play with human feeling, with its [...] "morbidity" [...] in a cold and ferocious manner. Only very recently <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> a sort of gravedigger of art (oddly enough, I am using the very terms of my enemies). Some of my latest works have been coffins and tombs. During the same time I succeeded in painting with fire, using particularly powerful and searing gas flames, some of them measuring three to four meters high. I use these to bathe the surface of the painting {{in such a way that}} it registered the spontaneous trace of fire.|$|E
