5|$|The {{most common}} {{approach}} of GWA studies is the case-control setup, which compares two {{large groups of}} individuals, one healthy control group and one case group affected by a disease. All individuals in each group are genotyped {{for the majority of}} common known SNPs. The exact number of SNPs depends on the genotyping technology, but are typically one million or more. For each of these SNPs it is then investigated if the allele frequency is significantly altered between the case and the control group. In such setups, the fundamental unit for reporting effect sizes is the odds ratio. The odds ratio is the ratio of two odds, which in the context of GWA studies are the odds of disease for individuals having a specific allele and the odds of disease for individuals who do not <b>have</b> <b>that</b> <b>same</b> allele. When the allele frequency in the case group is much higher than in the control group, the odds ratio is higher than 1, and vice versa for lower allele frequency. Additionally, a P-value for the significance of the odds ratio is typically calculated using a simple chi-squared test. Finding odds ratios that are significantly different from 1 is the objective of the GWA study because this shows that a SNP is associated with disease.|$|E

I remember Kenny saying, 'I feel like I'm tripping on LSD' because he kept hearing things that were not in time, and it drove him crazy," [...] said Corgan in the Adore reissue liner notes. Performing with Garson was also challenging because, according to Corgan, [...] "he made a decision 40 years ago that he would live in the intuitive flow {{of what he was}} feeling, so he literally cannot play the same thing twice. So we'd have gigs where he'd <b>have</b> <b>that</b> <b>same</b> magic as on Aladdin Sane and the next night he'd come and play the extreme opposite style—like honkytonk.

And in a country where we teach our children that everyone is equal under the law, discriminating against same-sex couples just isn't right. It's as simple as that." [...] At the 2012 DNC Michelle said, [...] "Barack knows the American Dream because he's lived it... and he wants everyone in this country to <b>have</b> <b>that</b> <b>same</b> opportunity, no matter who we are, or where we're from, or what we look like, or who we love." ...|$|E

In November 2013, {{it was announced that}} Disney would provide Netflix with live-action series based on Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Iron Fist, and Luke Cage, leading up to a miniseries based on the Defenders. Disney CEO Bob Iger stated that Netflix was chosen to air the shows, [...] "when Disney realized it could use the streaming service as a way to grow the popularity of the characters". He added that, if the characters prove popular, they could become feature films. Loeb later stated that Marvel was not [...] "interested in making four pilots and then hoping someday that they could all get together. Netflix really understood what it is we wanted to do. They're very open to directors that might not <b>have</b> <b>that</b> <b>same</b> opportunity in broadcast television. The notion of having all 13 episodes at one time, particularly in serialized storytelling, is very appealing." [...] Loeb also added that the four characters chosen [...] "all had a previous existing relationship and all grew up on the same kind of stoop in New York [...] So it lent itself to a world. Does that mean these shows {{are going to be the}} same? No. They can't be. The characters have different issues, different problems, different feelings about them ... the example that I continually give is that I cannot think of two films that are more different in tone than [...] and Guardians of the Galaxy.

Theron Martin of Anime News Network describes Tsukune as a [...] "cookie-cutter harem male lead, an unfailingly kind-hearted, indecisive wimp who primarily has {{a thing for}} Moka but still treasures the other girls as friends." [...] Carlo Santos of Anime News Network, in reviewing the manga, noted Tsukune's character design as lazy: [...] "shove in any other male protagonist from a harem series and nobody would notice too much". He found the girls [...] "distinctive, if predictable (the beauty, the boobs, the jailbait)", but concluded in a later volume that [...] "The story's never going to go anywhere, the characters {{are never going to}} go anywhere, and the artwork is always going to <b>have</b> <b>that</b> <b>same</b> polished-but-flawed look." [...] Stig Høgset of THEM Anime Reviews found Moka to be ditzy and a [...] "pink-haired dolt"; he criticized her lack of vampire weaknesses such as walking around in broad daylight at a beach, but found her alternate personality as [...] "pretty damn badass", [...] "a great addition to the show, if a severely underutilized one", and wished that her character was developed better. Deb Aoki of About.com called Moka a magical ditz who loves the doofus but also kicks butt. Neil Lumbard of DVD Talk noted that Kokoa is not another character that has a massive crush on the same guy; however, Høgset noted that her anime role was reduced to obnoxious comedy acts.|$|E

At all events, it will mislead nobody, and therefore will do no harm. I would not borrow money. I am against an overwhelming, crushing system. Suppose that, at each session, Congress shall first determine how much money can, for that year, be spared for improvements; then apportion that sum to the most important objects. So far all is easy; but how shall we determine which are the most important? On this question comes the collision of interests.

The prelimited amount of means will save us from doing too much, and the statistics will save us from doing what we do in wrong places. Adopt and adhere to this course, and, it seems to me, the difficulty is cleared.|$|E
