The results are approximately constant with d 13 C-values between - 27 and - 24 per mil.

After ageing we observed an evolution of chemical structures and physical properties for all samples. The main pathway of degradation is given for each sample.

40|$|Electrospun nanofibers {{are rarely}} used as {{reinforcing}} agents in polymer-based composites. A fabrication approach is presented that allows to easily prepare composites based on polycaprolactone (PCL) filled with polystyrene (PS) and polivinylidene fluoride (PVDF) based fibres by compression moulding. The presence of fibres {{with a very}} small diameter favoured a good interfacial adhesion between matrix and filler. Being of a similar order of magnitude than polymer lamellae, electrospun fibres {{can be used to}} shape the morphology of lamellar stacks, and therefore the final properties of the composites. Thermal behaviour as well as the crystalline structure were investigated using DSC, and X-Ray technique, showing a change in the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>cristallinity</b> within the addition of a filler. The tensile properties of the samples were measured, and SEM picture obtained.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} work, {{a study on}} flux pinning {{mechanisms}} of commercial YBCO tapes is presented. This study has been performed via critical current characterization using transport (via direct I-V curves) and magnetization (via a Vibrating Sample Magnetometer) measurements. The latter ones {{turned out to be}} better concerning the comprehension of the pinning landscape of the provided samples, as a wider range of magnetic fields and temperatures is available for those measurements in the setup I used. The comparison of the experimental data with existing theoretical models allowed me to draw a picture of the pinning mechanisms underlying in each sample, and {{they turned out to be}} quite different one another. Moreover, for high-performance research tapes, another interesting feature has been found: the counterplay between the self-field critical current and the in-field one. Very well engineered artificial pinning structures limit the self-field critical current density due to the high density of defects, while samples with high <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>cristallinity</b> have their in-field performances limited due to the poor pinning properties...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{report on}} {{molecular}} simulations of zinc oxide nanostructures obtained within silica nanopores of diameter D = 1. 6 nm and D = 3. 2 nm. Both {{the effects of}} confinement (by varying the pore size) and degree of pore filling {{on the structure of}} the nanomaterial are addressed. Two complementary approaches are adopted: 1) the stability of the three crystalline phases of ZnO (wurtzite, rocksalt, and blende) in the silica nanopores is studied, and 2) ZnO nanostructures are obtained by slowly cooling down a homogeneous liquid phase confined in the silica pores. None of the ideal nanostructures (wurtzite, rocksalt, blende) retains the ideal structure of the initial crystal when confined within the silica pores. Only the structure starting from the ideal wurtzite nanocrystal remains significantly crystalline after relaxation, as revealed by the marked peaks in the pair correlation functions for this system. The morphology and <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>cristallinity</b> of the structures are found to depend on the parameters involved in the synthesis (pore size, filling density). Nanograin boundaries are observed between domains of different crystal structures. Reminiscent features of the bulk behavior, such as faceting of the nanostructures, are also observed when the system size becomes large. We show that the use of nanopores as a template imposes that the confined particles exhibit neutral (basal) surfaces. These predictions provide a guide to experiments on semiconductor nanoparticle...|$|E

The nanocrystalline HA powders were {{produced}} through sol-gel method which employed calcium nitrate tetrahydrate [Ca(NO 3) 2. 4 H 2 O] and diammonium hydrogen phosphate [(NH 4) 2 HPO 4] as calcium and phosphorous precursors. Sodium ion (Na+) {{is one of}} the trace elements found in biological apatite and believed to have important effect in its performance. The concentrations of sodium dopant were varied from 0 mol % until 15 mol % by using sodium nitrate (NaNO 3) as the source of dopant.

The films were characterized concerning their chemical composition and mechanical properties. The {{results showed that}} the films, in both systems, have similar properties.

The hardness and the adhesion are similar for both systems. The increase of C alloying to the films led to the improvement of both their hardness and adhesion. The tribological performance of the coatings was tested by ball-on-disk. The films deposited by co-sputtering present better results than the reactive deposited ones. With the increase of C content in these coatings an increase of the wear resistance is observed, reaching in the best case a wear coefficient of 3. 1 × 10 - 16 m³/N×m. In the films deposited by reactive process, low wear coefficients can also be reached but no regular trend with increasing C contents can be observed...|$|R
40|$|Enzymatic {{hydrolysis}} of granular starch {{has been}} used to study the structure and the physicochemical properties of the granules. It depends, among others, on the starch botanic source, on the enzymatic system used and {{on the size of the}} granules. The aim of this work was to investigate the effect of granule size on enzymatic susceptibility and on structural and physicochemical properties of Peruvian Carrot starch. Starches from two varieties (Amarela de Carandaí, AC and Amarela de Senador Amaral, ASA) were isoladed, fractionated by size and classified into whole granules (without separation); large granules (d 20 æm); medium granules (> 10 e < 20 æm) and small granules (£ 10 æm). The whole and fractionated granular starches were hydrolysed with bacterial -amylase and fungal amyloglucosidase. Samples, before and after hydrolysis, were analyzed regarding their structural and physicochemical characteristics. The whole and fractionated native starches shown in optical microscope and scanning electron microscope circular shape for large granules and polygonal shape for small granules. The granular surface was smooth with some had openings, especially for the larges granules, with some depressions and holes. From chromatograms of gel permeation in Sepharose CL- 2 B was not possible to observe differences on the molecular size from both varieties of Peruvian Carrot. The amylose content, that was higher to AC variety, was concentraded mainly in large granules. Both varieties exhibited B-type X-ray diffraction pattern and relative <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>cristallinity</b> (DC) (~ 20 %) was not different for the different starches, despite the intensity of the peaks decrease for small granules.

From those, mercerization {{is the one}} able to confer a major increase in overall quality of the fibrous material and consists of a very strong alkaline treatment of the material, which is kept under controlled tension.

CORONA treatment consists on the application of an electrical discharge of high voltage (around 10. 000 V) through air between two electrodes, using frequencies around 40 kHz, at normal atmospheric temperature and pressure, on dry cotton fabric.
