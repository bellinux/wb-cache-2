25|$|In the {{subsequent}} fortnight the advance continued and the battalion {{was involved in}} operations to clear the enemy {{from a series of}} positions in mountainous terrain, notably playing a part in the capture of Monte Gamberaldi. The battalion was temporarily withdrawn to recuperate and returned to the frontline in mid-October being employed in the capture of Monte Ceco. In November the 1st Infantry Division was moved to a sector south of Bologna and the Hertfordshires were involved in several actions against German Fallschirmjager Parachute troops as the onset of winter induced stalemate along the front. The battalion endured the poor conditions, rotating through periods of holding the frontline. This proved to be its <b>final</b> <b>duty</b> during the Italian campaign, and in January 1945 it was withdrawn and the division dispatched to the Eastern Mediterranean.|$|E

60|$|That {{blackness}} at the root--though only so notable in this wood-moss and collateral species, {{is indeed}} a general character of the mosses, with rare exceptions. It is their funeral blackness;--that, I perceive, {{is the way the}} moss leaves die. They do not fall--they do not visibly decay. But they decay invisibly, in continual secession, beneath the ascending crest. They rise to form that crest, all green and bright, and take the light and air from those out of which they grew;--and those, their ancestors, darken and die slowly, and at last become a mass of mouldering ground. In fact, as I perceive farther, their <b>final</b> <b>duty</b> is so to die. The main work of other leaves is {19} in their life,--but these have to form the earth out of which all other leaves are to grow. Not to cover the rocks with golden velvet only, but to fill their crannies with the dark earth, through which nobler creatures shall one day seek their being.|$|E
6000|$|I did not shirk my tasks at the store, {{although}} I {{never got}} over the feeling that a fine instrument was being employed where a coarser one would have done equally well. There were moments when I was almost overcome by surges of self-commiseration and of impotent anger: for instance, I was once driven out of a shop by an incensed German grocer whom I had asked to settle a long-standing account. Yet the days passed, the daily grind absorbed my energies, and when I was not collecting, or tediously going over the stock in the dim recesses of the store, I was running errands in the wholesale district, treading the burning brick of the pavements, dodging heavy trucks and drays and perspiring clerks who flew about with memorandum pads in their hands, or awaiting the pleasure of bank tellers. Save Harvey, the venerable porter, I {{was the last to}} leave the store in the evening, and I always came away with the taste on my palate of Breck and Company's mail, it being my <b>final</b> <b>duty</b> to [...] "lick" [...] the whole of it and deposit it in the box at the corner. The gum on the envelopes tasted of winter-green.|$|E
