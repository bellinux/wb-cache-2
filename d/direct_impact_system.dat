40|$|Algotuf is a {{new steel}} which is {{proposed}} {{as a candidate for}} armour material. To assess this application, a study of the impact properties of this steel was conducted at the University of Manitoba using two types of Hopkinson Bar systems, namely a torsional bar equipment and a <b>direct</b> <b>impact</b> <b>system</b> capable of producing high strain rates and large strains. Stress strain curves for the steels were obtained in pure shear and in compression. Temperatures of 25 [*]∘C, 200 [*]∘C and 500 [*]∘C were used in the testing. Following the testing, a microstructural examination of the specimens tested was carried out to investigate the effect of microstructure on the mechanism of failure of this material. It was found that, above a value of impact momentum corresponding to a high strain rate, adiabatic shear bands are formed. The microscopic examination showed that the initiation of these shear bands corresponded at locations where martensitic laths were present and around regions of maximum shear stresses. Generally, the shear bands act as precursors to the formation of microcracks that may lead to failure. On the other hand, the high strength and formability of the steel makes it suitable for use as an armour material...|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} twenty years, {{literature}} has paid relevant attention to supply chain integration. Contributions have shown the importance of properly managing the relationship with suppliers {{in order to improve}} operational performances. In the last years, companies have been facing the challenges of globalization. This new phenomenon pushed companies to extend their sourcing activities abroad with important implications for supply chain management. There are limited contributions, however, on the impact of global sourcing on supply chain integration practices. This paper aims at studying if and how companies performing global sourcing adopt integration mechanism with suppliers, both in terms of information sharing and system coupling. Furthermore, we check for the impact of purchasing strategies (i. e. procurement cost reduction and procurement lead time reduction) on these factors. These goals are perceived by means of the International Manufacturing Strategy Survey (IMSS) data. A Structural Equation Model is developed to test the described relationships. Results show that global sourcing has a positive impact on information sharing but no <b>direct</b> <b>impact</b> on <b>system</b> coupling.

Additionally, these libraries are often completely free to use, have been tested extensively by other users and contain a large amount of expertise of other developers. There are also a number of disadvantages to using these libraries. When the interface of a software library changes, this has <b>direct</b> <b>impact</b> on software <b>systems</b> using this interface.

30|$|In {{the field}} of Operations Research, {{researchers}} have created {{a vast number of}} mathematical models to solve a wide range of location-allocation problems. A number of different objective functions have been devised to make such models applicable to different situations. Regrettably, the produced models can be difficult to solve to optimality [5]. The computational difficulty presented by intricate location models has, until lately, limited most study in this realm to fixed and deterministic problems. In the latter, all inputs such as time, distances and demands are known quantities and outputs are cited as zero–one decision values [6]. While such problems can provide users with awareness about generic location selection, modeling the uncertainties that are important in making real-world decisions is impossible for these models. In locating micro-grids and off-grid energy (SWAPs)—providing either private or public utility services—it is critical to assure that the selected location sites serve the cause of minimizing community cost or maximizing the benefits for the habitants. Likewise, the capacity allocation to these SWAPs possesses a <b>direct</b> <b>impact</b> on the <b>system’s</b> efficiency as a whole.|$|R

At system level, this energy bottleneck can be leveraged by capitalizing on the opportunistic partitioning and energy-scalable design of both hardware and software architectures.

In case of burst-based signal reception, detection functions have high duty cycle and hence need ultra low power implementation.

Three optimization-based strategies are then considered for pipe rehabilitation in the clustered network: 1) {{rehabilitation of}} some of the pipes inside the clusters; 2) rehabilitation of pipes in the path supplying water to the clusters; 3) combination of strategies 1 and 2. In all optimization strategies, the decision variables for rehabilitation problem are the diameters of duplicated pipes; the objective functions are to minimise the total cost of duplicated pipes and to minimise the number of nodes with pressure deficiency. The performance of proposed strategies was demonstrated in a large WDS with pressure deficiencies. The performance of these strategies were also compared to the full search space optimization strategy and engineering judgement based optimization strategy in which all pipes and selection of pipes are considered as decision variables respectively. The results show that strategy 3 is able to generate solutions with similar performance that are cheaper by around 53 % and 35 % in comparison with the full search space and engineering judgement-based optimization strategies respectively.

40|$|The unifying {{theme of}} the papers in this series is a concern for {{understanding}} the everyday practice of governance in low- and middle-income country (LMIC) health systems. Rather than seeing governance as a normative health system goal addressed through the architecture and design of accountability and regulatory frameworks, these papers provide insights into the real-world decision-making of health policy and system actors. Their multiple, routine decisions translate policy intentions into practice – and are filtered through relationships, underpinned by values and norms, influenced by organizational structures and resources, and embedded in historical and socio-political contexts. These decisions are also political acts – in that they influence who accesses benefits and whose voices are heard in decision-making, reinforcing or challenging existing institutional exclusion and power inequalities.
