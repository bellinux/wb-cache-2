While the redesign was taking place, construction on the station's original utilitarian design continued.

The central hall's height was increased, and the original design's pylons were replaced with much lower columns, finished off with white marble and matte polish. In particular, the white ceiling was divided with <b>diametrical</b> mosaic stripes with brick grouting on the sides, completed by artists Hryhoriy Korin and Volodymyr Fedko.|$|E

Contracts included flying pilgrims from Morocco to Mecca and Scandinavians to North America. After having lost 100 million Danish krone (DKK) by 1979, Unison was sold to Tjæreborg in 1980.

At a time when the Iași-based National-Christian Defense League (LANC), seeking to purge Jews from Romanian universities, was gaining momentum in Bucharest, a student identified Rainer as a Jew, and issued claims denying merit to his scholarship. According to Vitner, Rainer was the <b>diametrical</b> opposite of a Iași rival, the racist and LANC affiliate Nicolae Paulescu, who stood for [...] "dark and backward scientism". Vitner also recalls that Rainer was even shot at by far-right affiliates, so that he would no longer popularize his [...] "democratic convictions". For a while, Rainer was under the permanent protection of a Gendarme guard.|$|E
2500|$|The {{concept of}} a primary stage of {{socialism}} led directly to the reconception of capitalism and socialism's polar-opposite relation to each other. Previously, the CPC had declared that supporting capitalism meant supporting an historical retreat, secondly, capitalism was considered the <b>diametrical</b> opposite of socialism and their relations were considered hostile and incompatible. The official reconception of the two terms were sanctioned in the Political Report to the 13th National Congress. Before the reform efforts, capitalism and socialism {{were believed to be}} part of a sequential relationship, with the latter developing from the former. A less traditional view was that capitalism had proven it had a [...] "greater capacity for creating human civilization" [...] than Marx expected, which indirectly meant that socialism could learn from capitalism. Another mark of continuity was that the two systems existed alongside each other.|$|E
2500|$|In 1887, Weinhold {{modified}} the Leyser machine {{with a system}} of vertical metal bar inductors with wooden cylinders close to the disk for avoiding polarity reversals. M. L. Lebiez described the Lebiez machine, that was essentially a simplified Voss machine (L'Électricien, April 1895, pp.225–227). In 1893, Bonetti patented a machine with {{the structure of the}} Wimshurst machine, but without metal sectors in the disks., à l'extérieur."

Time found the picture [...] "false to the original in its feeling", remarking that Brando [...] "sings in a faraway tenor that sometimes tends to be flat." [...] Appearing in Edward Murrow's Person to Person interview in early 1955, he admitted to having problems with his singing voice, which he called [...] "pretty terrible." [...] In the 1965 documentary [...] "Meet Marlon Brando", he revealed that the final product heard in the movie {{was a result of}} countless singing takes being cut into one and later joked, [...] "I couldn't hit a note with a baseball bat; some notes I missed by extraordinary margins... They sewed my words together on one song so tightly that when I mouthed {{it in front of the}} camera, I nearly asphyxiated myself". Relations between Brando and costar Frank Sinatra were also frosty, with Stefan Kanfer observing, [...] "The two men were <b>diametrical</b> opposites: Marlon required multiple takes; Frank detested repeating himself." [...] Upon their first meeting Sinatra reportedly scoffed, [...] "Don't give me any of that Actors Studio shit." [...] Brando later famously quipped, [...] "Frank is the kind of guy, when he dies, he's going to heaven and give God a hard time for making him bald." [...] Frank Sinatra famously called Brando [...] "the world's most overrated actor", and referred to him as [...] "mumbles".

60|$|I {{sought the}} ancient {{church on the}} {{following}} Sunday. There it stood, on its green bank, among the trees; the Pocantico swept by it in a deep dark stream, where I had so often angled; there expanded the mill-pond, as of old, with the cows under the willows on its margin, knee-deep in water, chewing the cud, and lashing the flies from their sides with their tails. The hand of improvement, however, had been busy with the venerable pile. The pulpit, fabricated in Holland, had been superseded by one of modern construction, and {{the front of the}} semi-Gothic edifice was decorated by a semi-Grecian portico. Fortunately, the two weather-cocks remained undisturbed on their perches {{at each end of the}} church, and still kept up a <b>diametrical</b> opposition to each other on all points of windy doctrine.|$|E

They assumed in the opposite sense whatever Rome pretended to as a proof of her omnipotent authority. The exorcisms, forms, and rites, by which good Catholics believed that incarnate fiends could be expelled and evil spirits of every kind rebuked--these, like the holy water, the robes of the priest, and the sign of the cross, the Calvinists considered either with scorn and contempt as the tools of deliberate quackery and imposture, or with horror and loathing, as the fit emblems and instruments of an idolatrous system.|$|E
60|$|Nuttie paused. Towards Mr. Dutton {{she always}} had a {{stronger}} impulse of confidence than towards any one else she had ever met; but she felt that he might think it unbecoming {{to say that she}} had perceived a certain dislike on her father's part towards Mark ever since the rejection of the agency and the marriage, which perhaps was regarded as a rejection of herself. He had a habit of dependence on Mark, which resulted in personal liking, when in actual contact, but in absence the distaste and offence always revived, fostered, no doubt, by Gregorio; and Canon Egremont's death had broken the link which had brought them together. However, for his brother's sake, {{and for the sake of}} the name, the head of the family might be willing to do something. It was one of Nuttie's difficulties that she never could calculate on the way her father would take any matter. Whether for better or for worse, he always seemed to decide in <b>diametrical</b> opposition to her expectation. And, as she was certainly less impetuous and more dutiful, she parted with Mr. Dutton at her own door without any such hint.|$|E

6000|$|All this, however, was for {{the moment}} {{retrospective}} and historic, because a fortnight before the letter was written, {{the policy of the}} central board, of which Mr. Gladstone so decisively approved, had been killed. A committee of the cabinet was appointed to consider it; some remained stubbornly opposed; as the discussion went on, some changed their minds and, having resisted, at last inclined to acquiesce. Ministers were aware from the correspondence of one of them with an eminent third person, that Mr. Parnell approved the scheme, and in consideration of it would even not oppose a very limited Crimes bill. This, however, was no temptation to all of them; perhaps it had the contrary effect. When it came to the full cabinet, it could not be carried. All the peers except Lord Granville were against it. All the Commoners except Lord Hartington were for it. As the cabinet broke up (May 9), the prime minister said to one colleague, “Ah, they will rue this day”; and to another, “Within six years, if it please God to spare their lives, they will be repenting in sackcloth and ashes.” Later in the day he wrote to one of them, “The division of opinion in the cabinet on the subject of local government with a central board for Ireland was so marked, and if I may use the expression, so <b>diametrical,</b> that I dismissed the subject from my mind, and sorrowfully accepted the negative of what was either a majority, or a moiety of the entire cabinet.” ...|$|E

I gave her hand back, I put it on her breast myself, and crossed the other on it.
