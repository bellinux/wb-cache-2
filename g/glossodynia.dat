40|$|Abstract Introduction: Acquired {{immunodeficiency}} syndrome (AIDS) is  a set {{of symptoms}} caused by decreases {{of the immune}} system that was infected by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Blood disorders often found in patient with HIV and associated with HIV infection. Mostly found disorders is anemia of chronic disease. The prevalence of anemia in HIV/AIDS patients reaches 70 %. Oral manifestations of anemia are atrophy of the papillae on tongue, <b>glossodynia,</b> pallor, angular cheilitis, glossitis, aphthous ulcers/erosive lesions, candidiasis, and geographic tongue. There are many publications that uses anemia as indicator to determine the prognosis of HIV infection, thus the description of oral manifestation of anemia in the non-ARV HIV/AIDS patients is a necessity. The {{purpose of this study was}} to describe the oral manifestation of anemia in the non-ARV HIV/AIDS patients. Methods: The methods used were purposive random sampling. Samples were new HIV/AIDS patients who have not got antiretroviral (ARV) treatment. The study included 40 patients in Teratai Clinic Hasan Sadikin Hospital Bandung. Results: Oral manifestations of anemia were found amongst non-ARV HIV/AIDS patients, which were candidiasis in   37 patients, <b>glossodynia</b> in 28 patients, glossitis in 10 patients, and angular cheilitis in 1 patient. Conclusion: From the study found that oral manifestations of anemia that found in non-ARV HIV/AIDS patients were candidiasis, <b>glossodynia,</b> glossitis and angular cheilitis. HIV/AIDS patients with anemia needed to treat more intensive for better prognosis and quality of life. Keywords: Anemia, HIV/AIDS, Candidiasis, Glossitis, Glossodyni...|$|E
40|$|Neurosomatic {{diseases}} manifestations in {{the oral}} cavity and on {{the skin of the}} face are various in pain and paresthesia sensations. Neuralgia, neuritis and causalgia are accompanied by intensive pain paroxysms, glossalgia and <b>glossodynia</b> by relatively tolerant, but constant and exhausting pain sensations. This drives patient out of habitual way of life, and often drives into depressive state with signs of cancerophobia. There exist various notions on pathogenesis of pain phenomenon. Neurogenic and vascular changes in the body with vegetative innervation and realization of pain in specific parts of oral cavity mucosa and on the skin of the face should be considered as specifically grounded. Gaps in understanding of nature of appearance and development of glossalgia and <b>glossodynia</b> gave rise to different names of these pathogenetic processes with further abundance of terminology. More often it is etiology or pathogenesis of pain syndrome that is explained by terms. Terminology of pain and paresthetic syndrome, presented in scientific literature by neurologists, psychiatrists and neuro-dentists, existing nowadays is investigated. This syndrome has about twenty names, often they reflect only clinical signs and topic character of manifestations. Only some of them have elements of etiology in their designation, in the majority of cases without profound justification. Due to this fact there appear difficulties in designation of pathologic process in oral cavity mucosa, which precisely reflect nature of the disease; this brings difference of specialists’ opinion. The authors recommend to define this phenomenon as “glossalgia” and “glossodynia”...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Burning mouth {{syndrome}} (BMS) is {{an enigmatic}} condition because {{the intensity of}} symptoms rarely corresponds to the clinical signs of the disease. Symptoms include oral burning, dry mouth, pain, changes in eating habits, severe menopausal symptoms, and non specific health problems etc. BMS is most prevalent in postmenopausal women with female: male ratio of 7 : 1. The etiology of BMS is multifactorial such as hormonal changes (menopause), ˚ nutritional deficiencies and taste disturbances to name a few. BMS {{is a challenge to}} diagnose and manage. The present article discusses some of the recent understanding of etiopathogenesis of BMS as well as the role of pharmacotherapeutic management in this disorder.

40|$|Syphilis {{has been}} coined “the great imitator” {{due to its}} extreme {{heterogeneity}} of presentation and mimicry of other conditions. Therefore, {{it is essential that}} physicians be familiar with the full spectrum of its manifestations. Syphilis may also lead to oral lesions that, occasionally, are unaccompanied by concomitant tegumentary findings. Such patients will pose unique diagnostic challenges. We report the case of a 45 -year-old HIV-infected male patient in whom secondary syphilis presented with burning mouth and dysgeusia that progressed to <b>glossodynia</b> and odynophagia. Examination revealed painful, shallow erosions on the posterior aspect of the tongue, in a pattern of plaques en prairie fauchée. A painful split papule (fausse perlèche or false angular cheilitis) was also present in the left commissure. There were no cutaneous lesions. The oral lesions were considered highly suggestive of secondary syphilis. A novel VDRL assay (which was previously negative) yielded a titer of 1 / 128.

40|$|Introduction: <b>Glossodynia</b> or burning mouth {{syndrome}} (BMS) is {{a common}} and poorly understood disorder. Its treatment is uncertain. Otherwise, {{there is some evidence}} of the importance of psychological factors in the genesis of this disease. Objectives: Verify the usefulness of group psychotherapy as an adjuvant therapeutic method in the treatment of BMS. Casuistics and Methods: The study group consisted of 64 consecutive patients with a clinical diagnosis of BMS seen at the Stomatology Outpatient Clinic, ENT Department, Sao Paulo University Medical School, between May 2002 and May 2007. All the patients were submitted to physical examination, laboratorial screening tests, psychological assessment (Crown-Crisp Experimental Inventory), and answered a short form of the McGill Pain Questionnaire. Only 44 patients who did not show any abnormality in the protocol exams entered the study. Twenty-four of them underwent group psychotherapy. Twenty patients received placebo. Chi-square test was applied to compare the results of treatment with or without psychotherapy. Results: There were 15 men and 29 women in the study group. Tongue burning was the main complaint of the patients. Improvement of symptoms was reported by 17 (70. 8 %) of the patients undergoing psychotherapy, while among those who did not eight (40 %) had improvement of symptoms (P=. 04). Conclusion: Psychological assessment demonstrated a close correlation between symptoms and psychological factors, suggesting that group psychotherapy is an important alternative to conventional treatment methods.

40|$|Introduction. Diabetes {{mellitus}} is a syndrome {{in which}} energy metabolism equilibrium is disturbed due to loss of secreted insulin or fault in it's function. The result is abnormal metabolim of carbohydrate protein and fat. Numerous oral soft tissue lesions {{were reported in}} diabetic patient. The goal {{of this study was}} to compare the relative frequency of oral manifestation in diabetic patients (type I) in diabetic research center with normal community of Isfahan. Methods. This experimental study was of case-control type. Popualation in which the study was conducted consisted of 96 diabetic patients and 96 healthy individuals who were relatives of diabetic patients accompanying them. Simple sampling method was used as the method of sampling Data were collected from research center by examining diabetic and control group. Data were then registeried in preformed check lists and statistically analyzed. Results. Data showed that relative frequency of irritation fibroma, fissure tongue, traumatic ulcers, xerostomia, <b>glossodynia</b> and candida related ulcer was 6. 2, 21. 9, 8. 4, 57. 3, 9. 4 and 6. 2 percent respectively.

40|$|Saliva plays a {{key role}} in the {{maintenance}} of oral health. Xerostomia or reduced salivary flow is a common clinical complaint that predisposes individuals to oral diseases and considerable discomfort that may manifest as increased incidence of caries, susceptibility to oral Candidiasis, altered taste sensation, <b>glossodynia</b> and numerous other problems. Xerostomia may occur with the use of medication; as a complication of connective tissue and autoimmune diseases; with radiation to the head and neck region; or with a number of other systemic or local conditions. Investigations for xerostomia include a thorough clinical and oral examination; salivary flow rate estimation; radiologic and histopathologic examination of the salivary glands. Clinical laboratory tests are also indicated to help in the diagnosis. Patient education plays a vital role in the management of Xerostomia. The general approach to treatment consists of palliative treatment for the relief of symptoms and prevention of oral complications. Relief of symptoms may be achieved by paying rigorous attention to personal oral hygiene; diet counseling; drug substitution/dose modification. Salivary flow may be enhanced by using medication or by gustatory stimulation. Artificial saliva substitutes may be used for relieving symptoms. Alternative therapy like acupuncture may be sought if conventional treatment has failed to offer relief. Complications like increased incidence of dental caries, candidiasis, difficulty in using dentures, usually associated with Xerostomia can be managed by giving rigorous attention to personal and professional oral hygiene measures; strict adherence to non cariogenic diet; placement of sealants and topical fluorides; and anti-fungal therapy...|$|E

Subcutaneous injection of bortezomib reduced PN, but 24 % of cases were grade 2 PN and 6 % of cases were grade 3 PN. PN higher than grade 2 was not resolved by subcutaneous injection. PN higher than grade 3 has serious dose limiting toxicity and {{is the cause of}} discontinuing bortezomib treatment. Lafutidine is an H 2 -blocker with gastroprotective activity and is thought to function by increasing mucosal blood flow via capsaicin sensitive neurons. The same activity of lafutidine is considered to improve <b>glossodynia</b> and taxane induced PN. We hypothesized that lafutidine prevents or improves PN that is caused by bortezomib. In the current study, bortezomib was administered in the usual manner (intravenous administration of bortezomib 1. 3 mg/m 2, twice a week for 2 weeks, followed by 1 week without treatment) for up to four cycles to compare our data with other studies. Lafutidine was administered orally at a dose of 10 mg twice daily. In our eight evaluated cases, the total occurrence of PN was four out of eight patients (50 %). There were only grade 1 PN (4 out of 8) cases, and no cases higher than grade 2. We conclude that (1) the total occurrence of PN was not improved, (2) there was no PN after the first course, (3) there were only grade 1 cases and there were no cases higher than grade 2, and (4) no cases discontinued bortezomib treatment because of PN.

40|$|Burning mouth {{syndrome}} (BMS) is {{a chronic}} and spontaneous oral pain with burning {{quality in the}} tongue or other oral mucosa without any identifiable oral lesion or laboratory finding. Pathogenesis and etiology of BMS are still unknown. However, BMS {{has been associated with}} other chronic pain syndromes including other idiopathic orofacial pain, the dynias group and the family of central sensitivity syndromes. This would imply that BMS shares common mechanisms with other cephalic and/or extracephalic chronic pains. The primary aim of this systematic review was to determine whether BMS is actually associated with other pain syndromes, and to analyze cephalic and extracephalic somatosensory sensitivity in these patients. This report followed the PRISMA Statement. An electronic search was performed until January 2015 in PubMed, Cochrane library, Wiley and ScienceDirect. Searched terms included "burning mouth syndrome OR stomatodynia OR <b>glossodynia</b> OR burning tongue OR oral burning". Studies were selected according to predefined inclusion criteria (report of an association between BMS and other pain(s) symptoms or of cutaneous cephalic and/or extracephalic quantitative sensory testing in BMS patients), and a descriptive analysis conducted. The search retrieved 1512 reports. Out of these, twelve articles met criteria for co-occurring pain symptoms and nine studies for quantitative sensory testing (QST) in BMS patients. The analysis reveals that in BMS patients co-occurring pain symptoms are rare, assessed by only 0. 8 % (12 of 1512) of the retrieved studies. BMS was associated with headaches, TMD, atypical facial pain, trigeminal neuralgia, post-herpetic facial pain, back pain, fibromyalgia, joint pain, abdominal pain, rectal pain or vulvodynia. However, the prevalence of pain symptoms in BMS patients is not different from that in the age-matched general population. QST studies reveal no or inconsistent evidence of abnormal cutaneous cephalic and extracephalic somatosensory sensitivity. There is no evidence for a high rate of other pain symptoms or somatosensory impairments co-occurring with BMS. These results thus suggest that BMS rather depends on specific mechanisms, likely at the trigeminal level. Nevertheless, more thoroughly conducted research is required to draw definitive conclusion...|$|E

Psychiatrically they can both be considered as &ldquo;somatoform disorder&rdquo;. From the dental point of view, however, the two disorders are quite distinct. BMS is a burning or stinging sensation in the mouth in association with a normal mucosa whereas AO is most frequently associated with a continuous pain in the teeth or in a tooth socket after extraction {{in the absence of}} any identifiable cause. Because of the absence of organic causes, BMS and AO are often regarded as psychogenic conditions, although the relationship between oral pain and psychologic factors is still unclear. Some studies have analyzed the psychiatric diagnoses of patients with chronic oral pain who have been referred from dental facilities to psychiatric facilities. No study to date has investigated patients referred from psychiatric facilities to dental facilities. Objective: To analyze the psychiatric diagnoses of chronic oral pain patients, diagnosed with BMS and AO, and referred from psychiatric facilities to dental facilities. Study design: Psychiatric diagnoses and disease conditions of BMS or AO were investigated in 162 patients by reviewing patients&rsquo; medical records and referral forms. Psychiatric diagnoses were categorized according to the International Statistical Classification of Disease and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision. Results: The proportion of F 4 classification (neurotic, stress-related, and somatoform disorders) in AO patients was significantly higher than in BMS patients. BMS patients were more frequently given a F 3 classification (mood/affective disorders). However, 50. 8 % of BMS patients and 33. 3 % of AO patients had no specific psychiatric diagnoses.
