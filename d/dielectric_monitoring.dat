40|$|Thermoanalytical {{techniques}} and dielectric analysis {{were used in}} this study to describe and characterise the cure processes occurring during the isothermal and dynamic cures of four epoxy/amine resin systems. The complexity of the cure reactions was illustrated by results from DSC and FTIR experiments and was attributed to the variety of chemical reactions between the epoxy and the amine groups. Several phenomenological and mechanistic cure kinetics models were constructed, based on the cure reaction mechanisms, in order to simulate the degree of conversion during the cure. A one-to-one relationship was established between the degree of cure and the glass transition temperature of the curing resin, which was finther used in the construction of chemoviscosity models and in a simulation of the viscosity advancement during the cure. A number of mathematical techniques were utilised to evaluate the parameters involved in all the models, varying from simple linear regression methods to complex non-linear least squared estimation procedures. An in-situ <b>dielectric</b> <b>monitoring</b> technique was used in combination with the above mentioned chemorheological models, to investigate the feasibility of a quantitative correlation between the changes in the dielectric signal, the cure advancement and the major physical transformations, namely gelation and vitrification. The imaginary impedance response of the curing resin, as measured by the dielectric technique, showed good agreement with the degree of conversion, depicting all the crucial characteristics of the curing mechanism, such as autocatalysis and diflusion. The endset of the cure reaction was also identified from the endset of the conductivity changes and correlated to the vitrification time. The analytical chemorheological models developed in this study to describe the cure processes for some epoxy/amine resin systems, along with the <b>dielectric</b> <b>monitoring</b> technique used, suggest that a real-time link between the above mentioned models and the cure monitoring technique can be achieved.

40|$|Graduation date: 2001 Dielectric {{quantification}} {{of material}} properties is a technology well established in many industries. The {{application of this}} concept to the forest products industry to measure adhesive cure, however, has been belated {{in part due to}} a lack of proven technology directed at industrial processes and products. It is of great interest to manufacturers to minimize production costs and maximize output. This means being able to identify the minimum time required to cure composite panel products during hot pressing. In the hot-pressing process, material is currently pressed based on a conservative schedule that is actually longer than necessary. The schedule provides what temperatures and pressures are to be used throughout the press cycle to ensure resin cure (cross-linking). In the case of urea-formaldehyde, the resin is subject to strength loss if heat remains applied too long. The objective of the schedule is to cure the resin to an acceptable level and remove the product before degradation can occur. It is difficult to exactly predict the optimum point given all the variables to consider such as panel thickness; moisture and time; press pressure and temperature; and particle geometry, etc. This is where <b>dielectric</b> <b>monitoring</b> can help. Since the critical variable is degree of resin cure, it is logical to design a monitoring system that measures and utilizes it in a feedback control system. As the resin is curing, the molecules and ions become interlaced in a lattice structure during polymerization, reducing rotational and migrational mobility. Rotational and migrational mobility can be quantified dielectrically by applying an oscillating electric field to the material. Included in any monitored dielectric quantity is the effect due to moisture and wood. Studies were conducted to determine their contribution to the readings. Particleboard panels were manufactured in a laboratory environment and monitored with a dielectric system developed by the author. Three different adhesives were used urea - formaldehyde (U F), phenol formaldehyde (PF), and polymeric diphenolmethane diisocyanate (isocyanate, MDI). Dielectric response curves were obtained for each of the resins, and internal bond strength (IB) measurements were taken throughout the curing process of the boards. IB data were charted with dielectric data to show characteristics in the dielectric response curves that could be used to indicate cure status. The dielectric response curves show very encouraging peaks, valleys, and inflection points that seem to correspond to respective cure data. These characteristics could be incorporated into a full-scale system and used in an industrial setting to control and optimize press operations...|$|E
