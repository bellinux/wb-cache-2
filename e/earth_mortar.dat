Although {{it is necessary to}} study the whole masonry behaviour, the scope of this paper refers to the mortar only, without taking into account the blocks. As with other masonry units, compressive strength is a basic measure of quality for masonry mortars. However, there is a great variety of methodology for determining their parameters and properties, such as different samples geometry, the way strains are measured and also the platen restraint effect adopted. The present paper outlines certain experimental devices used to determine compressive strength of <b>earth</b> <b>mortars</b> and tries to show their influence on the properties determined. Proposals for the future development of testing <b>earth</b> <b>mortars</b> are outlined. Keywords...|$|R
40|$|<b>Earth</b> <b>mortars</b> were constructively {{used since}} Ancient Neolithic in Southwest Iberia pre-historic habitat settlements. According to archaeological information, these {{materials}} were applied on Neolithic Period to render ditches; latter, on Copper and Bronze Age, <b>earth</b> <b>mortars</b> {{were also used}} binding stone masonry, covering and filling vegetable structures, in mudbrick masonry and probably in massive walls.

5000|$|The Acropolis {{is located}} on a flat-topped rock that rises 150 m above sea level {{in the city of}} Athens, with a surface area of about 3 ha. It was also known as Cecropia, after the legendary serpent-man, Cecrops, the first Athenian king. While the {{earliest}} artifacts date to the Middle Neolithic era, there have been documented habitations in Attica from the Early Neolithic (6th millennium BC). There is little doubt that a Mycenaean megaron stood upon the hill during the late Bronze Age. Nothing of this megaron survives except, probably, a single limestone column-base and pieces of several sandstone steps. Soon after the palace was constructed, a Cyclopean massive circuit wall was built, 760 meters long, up to 10 meters high, and ranging from 3.5 to 6 meters thick. This wall would serve as the main defense for the acropolis until the 5th century. The wall consisted of two parapets built with large stone blocks and cemented with an <b>earth</b> <b>mortar</b> called emplekton (Greek: ἔμπλεκτον). The wall follows typical Mycenaean convention in that it followed the natural contour of the terrain and its gate was arranged obliquely, with a parapet and tower overhanging the incomers' right-hand side, thus facilitating defense. There were two lesser approaches up the hill on its north side, consisting of steep, narrow flights of steps cut in the rock. Homer is assumed to refer to this fortification when he mentions the [...] "strong-built House of Erechtheus" [...] (Odyssey 7.81). At some point before the 13th century BC, an earthquake caused a fissure near the northeastern edge of the Acropolis. This fissure extended some 35 meters to a bed of soft marl in which a well was dug. An elaborate set of stairs was built and the well served as an invaluable, protected source of drinking water during times of siege for some portion of the Mycenaean period. [...] There is no conclusive evidence for the existence of a Mycenean palace on top of the Athenian Acropolis. However, if there was such a palace, it seems to have been supplanted by later building activity.|$|E

40|$|Earth surface {{coatings}} play a decorative architectural role, {{apart from their}} function as wall protection. In Portuguese vernacular architecture, <b>earth</b> <b>mortars</b> were usually applied on stone masonry, while earth renders and plasters were used on indoors {{surface coatings}}. Limestone exists only in {{certain areas of the}} country and consequently lime was not easily available everywhere, especially on granite and schist regions where stone masonry was a current building technique. In the central west coast of Portugal, the lime slaking procedure entailed slaking the quicklime mixed with earth (sandy soil), in a pit; the resulting mixture would then be combined in a mortar or plaster. This was also the procedure for manufactured adobes stabilized with lime. Adobe buildings with earth-lime renderings and plasters were also traditional in the same region, using lime putty and lime wash for final coat and decoration. Classic decoration on earth architecture from the 18 th- 19 th century was in many countries a consequence of the François Cointeraux (1740 - 1830) manuals - Les Cahiers d'Architecture Rurale" (1793) - a French guide for earth architecture and building construction. This manual arrived to Portugal in the beginning of XIX century, but was never translated to Portuguese. References about decoration for earth houses were explained on this manual, as well as procedures about earth-lime renders and ornamentation of earth walls; in fact, these procedures are exactly the same as the ones used in adobe buildings in this Portuguese region. The specific purpose of the present paper is to show some cases of <b>earth</b> <b>mortars,</b> renders and plasters on stone buildings in Portugal and to explain the methods of producing earth-lime renders, and also to show some examples of rendering and coating with earth-lime in Portuguese adobe vernacular architecture...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Earth mortars {{have been}} applied since unknown times. Their {{advantages}} are ecological but also cover several technical aspects, in terms of compatibility with masonries, reversibility, comfort, aesthetic and health. Some requirements of a recent German standard, which focus on non-stabilized earth plastering mortars, are presented. A commercial premixed Portuguese <b>earth</b> <b>mortar</b> was made within an ECVET workshop and applied as plasters on four different experimental masonry walls, at exterior environmental conditions. The plasters were observed during six months and characterized in situ by non destructive techniques, namely by ultra-sounds and for surface hardness. The same mortar used for the plasters was characterized in laboratory in fresh state and samples of mortar (only mortar and mortar layer applied on brick) were produced and characterized after drying. The characterization of the earth plasters applied {{on the walls and}} of the mortar samples is presented and discussed, showing the viability of their use as plaster for different masonry walls...|$|E

Abstract Earth block walling has the lowest environmental impacts of any masonry material. Its embodied carbon dioxide can be one tenth that of fired bricks or autoclaved blocks. It can be recycled and locally made with limited technology thus reducing {{the environmental impacts of}} transport. Earth blocks can be made from waste earth produced as a by-product of other construction activities. The particular advantage of earth block walling over other earth construction methods, lies in the prefabrication of the masonry units. The production process is less weather dependent and the blocks are fully shrunk so that dimensional changes in the completed walls are less severe. Blocks can be pre-tested for strength and durability prior to their inclusion in the building. This gives greater certainty in design. Earth block walling has the potential to replace conventional masonry in a significant proportion of UK dwellings. This thesis examines earth block walling from a practitioner's point of view. From design through to block production and site construction, it considers the obstacles to its wider use. It emphasises the cost penalties of earth block walling, believed to be the principal reason for its decline and its limited revival. It examines options for earth block production through case studies of earth block producers in France, the USA and the UK and assesses their potential for reducing production costs <b>Earth</b> <b>mortars</b> are also assessed and tested for strength. The cost savings of <b>earth</b> slurry <b>mortars</b> are considered both in terms of the speed of construction and the possibilities for reducing the thickness of walls by utilising the higher flexural bond strengtiis available with slurry <b>mortars.</b> <b>Earth</b> slurry <b>mortars</b> are tested for flexural bond strength. The results indicate that slurry mortars can offer considerable improvements in flexural bond strength particularly where the mortar is reinforced. Through these improvements in flexural strength comes the possibility of reducing the overall wall thickness which could offer significant cost savings over thick joint techniques using earth lime and cement mortars. Earthen codes current in the USA and France are reviewed and compared with UK Building Regulations and masonry design codes to identify the additional costs associated with earth design in the UK. It concludes that the absence of a specific earthen code in the UK is a major obstacle to the revival of earth as a contemporary construction material. This thesis wresties with the dilemma of whether earth blocks should be produced on a local, small scale, using limited technology, thereby maximising the enviroimiental benefits; or whether the commercial benefits of mass production can offer economic viability without compromising the environmental advantages. It finds that the argument turns on the question of transportation and the distance between the production facility and the site of use. This thesis identifies the principal obstacles to the wider use of earth block walling. It emphasises the high cost of earth block constraction and the limited scope for reducing these costs down to that of conventional masonry. It identifies a need for greater fiscal and regulatory mtervention to tip the economic balance in favour of natural, low carbon materials such as earth block. It quantifies the environmental benefits of earth block wallmg and sets these against the additional costs involved...|$|R
40|$|Tabique {{is one of}} {{the main}} Portuguese {{traditional}} building techniques which basically use natural and local building materials such as earth and timber. A tabique building component such as a wall is built up using a simple timber structure covered by an <b>earth</b> based <b>mortar</b> on both sides. The <b>earth</b> based <b>mortar</b> has an important role in this building system technology since it not only protects the internal timber structure but it also acts as finishing element. Meanwhile, earth has the advantage of being abundant, natural, local and recycled giving to this technique a special importance in the sustainability context. It has been noticed that this traditional building technique has an expressive incidence in the region of Trás-os-Montes and Alto Douro, Portugal. Taking into account that the Trás-os-Montes and Alto Douro region is very large, there was the necessity to divide it in to more manageable areas. The manageable areas are the six Municipalities Associations, which are: Alto Tâmega, Terra Quente Transmontana, Terra Fria do Nordeste Transmontano, Vale do Douro Norte, Vale do Douro Sul and Douro Superior. This research work is focused on the Municipalities Association of Terra Fria do Nordeste Transmontano.

40|$|As part of {{a working}} {{definition}} of a new code of practice, this paper develops a methodology to determine the suitability of plasters manufactured on-site to protect the earthen walls of vernacular architecture buildings. Given the diversity of raw earth construction types, ranging from massive earth to stone masonry with <b>earth</b> <b>mortars,</b> and the variability of the materials used, two on-site tests (a shrinkage test followed by a shear test) were proposed. Those tests, as well as additional tests, were performed with lime/sand, earth/sand and earth with plaster admixtures. Lime/sand plasters do not typically pose shrinkage issues, which is why more earth based specimens were tested than lime based specimens. An analysis of the on-site testing complemented with laboratory tests reveals an antagonistic control of the bond between earth plaster and earthen wall based on clay content: {{an increase in the}} plaster clay content leads to increased bending strength, which strengthens the plaster and increased shrinkage, which weakens the plaster-wall interface. The heterogeneity of the wall leads {{to a wide range of}} results; therefore, this study was conducted to validate the formulation of plasters by means of shrinkage and shear tests at five different points on the wall. The shrinkage test allows finding the earth plaster formulations. Among all the validated formulations, the mason chooses the best one thanks to two criteria: the best workability (which is variable according to masons) with the highest clay content as possible. Then, when the formulation is chosen, the shear test must be done to verify if the bond between the plaster and the wall is high enough. This series of tests allows masons to validate formulations that will ensure good mechanical resistance of the plasters that protect buildings of vernacular earthen architecture...|$|R
40|$|The {{evaluation}} of the building process {{in terms of their}} environmental impact in all life cycle phases of a building leads to the key principle of sustainable building: the analysis of the life cycle of the materials used in a building. The goal of this analysis is to reduce waste and keep the environmental impact as low as possible by “closing” the cycle. During an inventory, the entire life cycle is assessed. This includes the sourcing and extracting of the raw material, the use of the raw material to produce building products, elements and structures, the use in finished buildings including emission of pollutants, decay and maintenance, and, finally, the demolition of the building and the recycling of the demolition materials. Transportation between the individual phases as well as production-related material and energy flows are also included in this evaluation. Several European and national norms and regulations define core rules and a special instrument for the {{evaluation of}} the sustainable quality of a building product based on a quantitative analysis of the life cycle of the materials used in a building: the Environmental Product Declaration EPD. These documents are voluntary standards, commitments or guarantees for building products.

Such declarations must fully include all phases of the life cycle of a product by describing the environmental impact during production and use as well as possible health hazards for the users.
