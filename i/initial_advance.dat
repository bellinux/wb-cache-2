After an <b>initial</b> <b>advance</b> by the Royalists in 1642, culminating in the battles of Brentford and Turnham Green, London {{was surrounded by a}} defensive perimeter wall known as the Lines of Communication. The lines were built by up to 20,000 people, and were completed in under two months.|$|E
5|$|One {{reason for}} the success of the {{offensive}} in this sector was the failure of Falkenhausen to employ a defence in depth. In theory, the enemy would be allowed to make initial gains, thus stretching their lines of communication. Reserves held close to the battlefield would be committed once the <b>initial</b> <b>advance</b> had bogged down, before enemy reinforcements could be brought up. The defenders would thus be able to counter-attack and regain any lost territory. In this sector, Falkenhausen kept his reserve troops too far from the front and they were too late for a useful counter-attack on either 10 or 11 April.|$|E

5|$|The New Zealanders were {{withdrawn}} from their positions {{four days later}} and remained out of the fighting while the Australian 9th Division took up the offensive in the northern sector of the front. Along with two British infantry brigades, the 2nd New Zealand Division resumed the fight on 2 November in Operation Supercharge, which was intended to break the frontlines in the south. The German defences collapsed and on 4 November they began retreating with the New Zealanders in pursuit. The 9th Armoured Brigade {{was attached to the}} 2nd New Zealand Division in support, and led the <b>initial</b> <b>advance</b> along with the 6th Brigade but rain turned the ground boggy and halted the advance temporarily before it could resume on 8 November.

5|$|By 1 January 1945 {{the threat}} to Charleville had eased {{sufficiently}} for the division {{to be transferred to}} another area of the Ardennes, being transported to an area south-west of Bastogne near the village of Morhet on 3 January; there it relieved the 11th Armored Division which had occupied the village prior to its arrival. On 4 January the division entered combat for the first time when it was ordered alongside the 87th Infantry Division to seize a number of key towns to the west of Bastogne, in order to prevent German forces from encircling the town a second time; it had been relieved by the Third Army on 26 December. With the 87th Infantry Division on its left flank, the division advanced towards German positions with the 194th Glider Infantry Regiment and 513th Parachute Infantry Regiment forming the division's assault element; the 193rd Glider Infantry Regiment and the 507th Parachute Infantry Regiment moved behind these two regiments to deal with expected German armoured counter-attacks against them. During its <b>initial</b> <b>advance</b> the division engaged German forces, including infantry and armour, in an attempt to secure a narrow, high-rimmed road to the north-west of Bastogne; during a battle that lasted three days the division suffered nearly 1,000 casualties attempting to hold what the division's official historian labeled 'Dead Man's Ridge'. It was during the opening stages of this battle that the division earned its first Medal of Honor. Staff Sergeant Isadore S. Jachman of the 513th Parachute Infantry engaged and destroyed with a bazooka two German tanks that formed part of an armoured column attacking American positions, forcing the column to retreat but simultaneously being killed by machine gun fire. Between 19 and 26 January, the division broke through German lines and captured several towns before linking up with elements of the British 51st Infantry Division. After it had captured the town of Espeler on 26 January the entire division was withdrawn from the front and transported by truck to Luxembourg, effectively ending its participation in the Ardennes campaign.|$|E

40|$|The {{wettability}} of soil is {{of great}} importance for plants and soil biota, and in determining the risk for preferential flow, surface runoff, flooding and soil erosion. The molarity of ethanol droplet (MED) test is widely used for quantifying the severity of water repellency in soils that show reduced wettability and {{is assumed to be}} independent of soil particle size. The minimum ethanol concentration at which droplet penetration occurs within a short time (≤ 10 s) provides an estimate of the <b>initial</b> <b>advancing</b> contact angle at which spontaneous wetting is expected. In this study, we test the assumption of particle size independence using a simple model of soil, represented by layers of small (∼ 0. 2 to 2 mm) diameter beads that predict the effect of changing bead radius in the top layer on capillary driven imbibition. Experimental results using a three-layer bead system show broad agreement with the model and demonstrate a dependence of the MED test on particle size. The results show that the critical <b>initial</b> <b>advancing</b> contact angle for penetration can be considerably less than 90 ° and varies with particle size, demonstrating that a key assumption currently used in the MED testing o...|$|R
25|$|While the Western Front {{had reached}} stalemate, the war {{continued}} in East Europe. Initial Russian plans called for simultaneous invasions of Austrian Galicia and East Prussia.

Russia's less developed industrial base and ineffective military leadership {{were instrumental in}} the events that unfolded. By the spring of 1915, the Russians had retreated to Galicia, and, in May, the Central Powers achieved a remarkable breakthrough on Poland's southern frontiers. On 5 August, they captured Warsaw and forced the Russians to withdraw from Poland.|$|E

The Red Army also pushed deep into Hungary (the Budapest Offensive) and eastern Czechoslovakia and temporarily halted at what is now the modern German border on the Oder-Neisse line. These rapid advances on the Eastern Front destroyed additional veteran German combat units and severely limited German Führer Adolf Hitler's ability to reinforce his Rhine defenses.

The remainder of the brigade, including the 42nd Battalion, commenced operations in January 1945. Entering the abandoned village of Mawaraka on 17 January, the battalion occupied it and then began patrolling forward, frequently clashing with Japanese forces amid the swamps in the area. The 29th Brigade was subsequently relieved by the 7th Brigade and returned to Torokina. In July the 29th Brigade relieved the 15th Brigade along the Mivo River, with the 42nd Battalion taking up positions along the Buin Road, between the Mobiai River and Nana Creek. Meeting strong resistance the brigade advance was held up; however, the Japanese were subsequently cleared and the Silibai River captured on 10 July. The 42nd Battalion subsequently established patrol bases on the Mivo, reaching the Oamai River by the end of July. Hostilities came to an end in August following the Japanese surrender and the demobilisation process began. The 42nd Battalion was disbanded on 7 May 1946.
