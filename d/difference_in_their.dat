5|$|The author Sylvia Townsend Warner cited Murray's {{work on the}} witch-cult as an {{influence}} on her 1926 novel Lolly Willowes, and sent a copy of her book to Murray in appreciation, with the two meeting for lunch shortly after. There was nevertheless some <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> depictions of the witch-cult; whereas Murray had depicted an organised pre-Christian cult, Warner depicted a vague family tradition that was explicitly Satanic.|$|E
5|$|The {{difference}} in the hearing ranges for octopus and bigfin reef squids {{may be explained by}} the <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> habitats. The octopus is demersal (bottom-dwelling) with excellent camouflage capabilities. Bigfin reef squids, on the other hand, are usually in open water with limited hiding places. Hearing would thus be more important for the squids to escape predators. The ability to hear is particularly relevant for avoiding mammalian predators of the suborder Odontoceti (particularly dolphins), who use echolocation to find prey.|$|E

5|$|His wife {{of nearly}} half a century, Elizabeth, to whom {{he had not been}} faithful, died in 1971. Brundage had once jested that his {{ambition}} was to wed a German princess. In June 1973, this came to pass when he married Princess Mariann Charlotte Katharina Stefanie von Reuss (1936–2003), daughter of HeinrichXXXVII, Prince of Reuss-Köstritz. Von Reuss had worked as an interpreter during the Munich Games; she stated that she had met Brundage in 1955, when she was 19. When Brundage was asked by reporters about the 48-year <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> ages, Brundage responded that he was young for his age and she mature for hers, and instead of 85 years to 37, it should be thought of as more like 55 to 46. Ruegsegger refused to be best man and stated after Brundage's death that the couple had dissipated much of Brundage's fortune through free spending, though Guttmann notes that some of those purchases were of real estate, which could be deemed investments.|$|E
5|$|When the {{projects}} begin, {{the work is}} done without machines, with supplies being shipped on small boats and then carried by hand from the beach. Project costs range between $5,000 and $150,000, although the average is between $20,000 and $25,000. The protected areas that result from these deals typically involve a 20- to 30-year commitment. Seacology hopes that during that time the local people grow to respect these resources and ideally progress {{to a point where}} they are less dependent on natural resources. According to marine biologist Mark Erdmann, in a worst-case scenario, if the people violate the contract and destroy the habitat, Seacology will have still made a <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> lives through its low-cost investment, whereas larger conservation organizations might invest large sums of money but through not addressing the immediate needs of the people, if the project fails, both lose that investment and not have helped the community.|$|E

Territorial males of the strawberry dart-poison frog (Dendrobates pumilio) and the spotted antbird (Hylophylax naevioides) do not discriminate behaviourally between the calls of neighbours and strangers, and female collared lizards show no <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> behaviour to neighbouring or unfamiliar females.|$|E

25|$|There are {{at least}} six H3 {{receptor}} isoforms in the human, and more than 20 discovered so far. In rats there have been six H3receptor subtypes identified so far. Mice also have three reported isoforms. These subtypes all have subtle <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> pharmacology (and presumably distribution, based on studies in rats) but the exact physiological role of these isoforms is still unclear.|$|E
25|$|The central iconic {{imagery of}} the two traditions {{underscore}} the <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> belief structure, when the peaceful death of Gautama Buddha at an old age is contrasted with the harsh image of the crucifixion of Jesus as a willing sacrifice for the atonement {{for the sins of}} humanity. Buddhist scholars such as Masao Abe see the centrality of crucifixion in Christianity as an irreconcilable gap between the two belief systems.|$|E
25|$|Even larger time gaps can be bridged by {{comparing}} human populations with a sufficiently {{long history of}} genetic separation, such as Central Europeans and Japanese. One surface-based study compared the brain shape between these two groups and found a <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> gender-dependent brain asymmetries. Neuroimaging studies of this kind, combined with functional ones and behavioural data, provide promising and so far largely unexplored avenues to understand {{similarities and differences between}} different groups of people.|$|E

25|$|Relations {{of gender}} are {{presented}} as analogous to relations of power in Leyendas, but it appears as something ambiguous and almost fluid. The two elders introduced {{in the very first}} legends, Don Chepe and Niña Tina, are identical to each other, despite the fact that one is male and the other female. There is no <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> power or in their gender, and they could be one entity, but they are indeed two, distinguished only by their names.|$|E
25|$|According to this doctrine, God is not {{divided in}} the sense that each person has a third of the whole; rather, each person is {{considered}} to be fully God (see Perichoresis). The distinction lies in their relations, the Father being unbegotten; the Son being eternal yet begotten of the Father; and the Holy Spirit 'proceeding' from Father and (in Western theology) from the Son. Regardless of this apparent <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> origins, the three 'persons' are each eternal and omnipotent. This is thought by Trinitarian Christians to be the revelation regarding God's nature which Jesus Christ came to deliver to the world, and is the foundation of their belief system.|$|E

Voters have reported that political sketches that were shown on the program influenced them in the voting booth. The so-called SNL Effect was observed during the 2008 presidential campaign, according to Mike Dabadie. Two-thirds of voters who responded to a poll said they had seen a broadcast of politically charged content on SNL, with ten percent saying that it had made a <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> decision. Barack Obama was the beneficiary of the political content, with 59 percent saying they did in fact cast a vote for the Democratic then-nominee.|$|E

The <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> ranksNiven was a lieutenant-colonel and Ustinov a privatemade their regular association militarily impossible; to solve the problem, Ustinov was appointed as Niven's batman. He also appeared in propaganda films, debuting in One of Our Aircraft Is Missing (1942), {{in which he was}} required to deliver lines in English, Latin, and Dutch. In 1944 under the auspices of ENSA, he presented and performed the role of Sir Anthony Absolute, in Sheridan's The Rivals, with Dame Edith Evans, at the Larkhill Camp theater.|$|E
25|$|All statins {{have the}} same {{pharmacophore}} so the <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> pharmacodynamic effect is mostly based on the substituents. The activity of each statin {{is dependent on the}} binding affinity of the compound for the substrate site and the length of time it binds to the site. Type 2 statins havejk unique fluorophenyl group that causes additional polar interaction between the enzyme and the statins, which results in a tighter binding to the enzyme. The newest statin, rosuvastatin has a unique polar methane sulfonamide group, which is quite hydrophilic and confers low lipophilicity. The sulfonamide group forms a unique polar interaction with the enzyme. As a result, rosuvastatin has superior binding affinity to the HMGR enzyme compared to the other statins, which is directly related to its efficiency to lower LDL cholesterol.|$|E
25|$|Huxley was {{certainly}} not slavish in his dealings with Darwin. As shown in every biography, they had quite different and rather complementary characters. Important also, Darwin was a field naturalist, but Huxley was an anatomist, {{so there was a}} <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> experience of nature. Lastly, Darwin's views on science were different from Huxley's views. For Darwin, natural selection {{was the best way to}} explain evolution because it explained a huge range of natural history facts and observations: it solved problems. Huxley, on the other hand, was an empiricist who trusted what he could see, and some things are not easily seen. With this in mind, one can appreciate the debate between them, Darwin writing his letters, Huxley never going quite so far as to say he thought Darwin was right.|$|E
