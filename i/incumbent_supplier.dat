Then, {{to reduce the risk}} originating from the fluctuation in the competitive supplier’s wholesale price, we integrate the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) measure in financial risk management into this study and derive an optimal wholesale price to maximize CVaR about profit for the <b>incumbent</b> <b>supplier.</b> Besides, the properties of the two optimal wholesale prices are discussed.

The work is different from most research on entry deterrence that only considers a single-stage model. Our main interest is to investigate how the <b>incumbent</b> <b>supplier</b> can strategically maximize her profit by a wholesale pricing policy when facing the potential entrant. We focus on a model where the entrant supplier will sell her product through the same incumbent retailer. We derive the optimal decisions for each player and study the comparative statics of the equilibrium. To investigate how the supply chain structure may affect the deterrence strategy of the <b>incumbent</b> <b>supplier,</b> we also consider three alternative models with different channel structures, when both suppliers sell their products directly, when the entrant has another independent retailer, and when the entrant sells her product directly.

The model focuses on a purchaser who manages the acquisition process, an <b>incumbent</b> <b>supplier,</b> and a potential entrant or second supplier. Because {{the costs of the}} incumbent and second source are correlated, the entrant's costs provide an informative signal about the incumbent's costs. Judicious use of this information allows the purchaser to limit the incumbent's rents. Because entry also provides an alternative source of production, however, there are important distinctions between the optimal entry policy and the optimal auditing policy. One of our findings is that it may be optimal to replace the incumbent, even when the entrant is known to have higher production costs. ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{constructs}} a {{model of}} anticompetitive exclusive contracts {{in the presence of}} complementary inputs. A downstream firm transforms multiple complementary inputs into final products. When complementary input suppliers have market power, upstream competition within a given input market benefits not only the downstream firm (by lowering the input price) but also complementary input suppliers (by raising complementary input prices). The downstream firm is thus unable to earn higher profits even when socially efficient entry is allowed. Hence, the inefficient <b>incumbent</b> <b>supplier</b> can deter socially efficient entry by using exclusive contracts {{even in the absence of}} economies of scale and downstream competition.

This paper uses a deductive approach [...] one based on game theory, to explicitly examine the reactions of bigger firms to the entry of SMEs into their markets, specifically taking into account the resource limitations faced by SMEs.

40|$|Although {{the initial}} {{euphoria}} about Internet-enabled reverse auctions {{has given way}} to a cautious but widespread use of reverse auctions in business-to-business (B 2 B) procurement, there is a limited understanding of the effect of auction design parameters on buyer surplus. In this paper, we study the effect of bidding competition, information asymmetry, reserve price, bid decrement, auction duration, and bidder type on buyer surplus. We collected field data on more than 700 online procurement auctions conducted by a leading auctioneer and involving procurement items worth millions of dollars. Consistent with the predictions of auction theory, the results indicate that bidding competition, reserve price, and information sharing affect buyer surplus. Unlike previous findings in the consumerto-consumer context, we find that bid decrement and auction duration have no effect in B 2 B procurement auctions. Our results suggest that use of the rank-bidding format increases buyer surplus when <b>incumbent</b> <b>suppliers</b> participate in the auction. We discuss the theoretical and managerial implications of these findings for future research and for optimal design of online procurement auctions.

40|$|This Paper {{studies the}} effect of {{knowledge}} diffusion on the incentives for developed countries’ (DC) firms to undertake costly transfer of production knowledge of an input to their developing countries’ (LDC) suppliers whose costs of production vary inversely with their technological effort. We distinguish between upstream knowledge diffusion, which occurs when the technology diffuses to other suppliers not directly engaged in the technology transfer process, and downstream knowledge diffusion, which occurs when other buyers learn from the incumbent DC firm to procure the same input from the trained LDC supplier(s). We show that when the cost of improving production efficiency is high, and hence where the incentive for technological effort is low, technology transfer is encouraged (discouraged) by upstream (downstream) knowledge diffusion. When, however, the cost of engaging in technological effort is low, and hence where technological effort has {{a significant impact on}} the input price, the opposite results obtain: upstream knowledge diffusion discourages technology transfer as increased competition reduces the <b>incumbent</b> <b>supplier’s</b> incentive to undertake technological effort thus lowering the value of technology transfer for the DC firm. Downstream knowledge diffusion encourages technology transfer by increasing the demand for the supplier’s product and hence the technological effort undertaken. buyer-supplier; developing countries; knowledge diffusion; technological effort; technology transfer...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three self-contained essays on mechanism design problems: a collective decision problem, a theoretical auction problem, and an applied auction problem. Chapter 1 contains an introduction. In Chapter 2 I consider a problem where a group has to take a collective decision. I study how the decision mechanism should be designed when the information relevant for the decision is dispersed among the group members and when the group members' preferences over decisions might be in conflict. Observed mechanisms differ in whether the most extreme positions are disregarded or not. I find that the designer should never disregard the most extreme positions, but that he should limit the amount by which single group members can affect the decision. In Chapter 3 I analyze a seller's problem to design an optimal first-price auction. Normally the design problem reduces {{to the problem of}} determining the lowest admissible bid. I show that the structure of the optimal first-price auction may be non-standard when the seller cannot commit to sell to the highest bidder after observing the bids, and when he is able to fix the auction rules already at a time at which he is still uncertain about his own use value. In this case the seller might allow high and low bids, but forbid intermediate ones. In the last chapter I am interested in the problem of a procurer to organize his procurement process. I compare two procurement systems resembling stylized facts from American and Japanese procurement. In the first system the procurer exerts as much competitive pressure on his <b>incumbent</b> <b>supplier</b> as possible, while in the second system he protects his <b>incumbent</b> <b>supplier</b> by looking only for possible replacements after bilateral negotiations with him break down. I show that either system may induce higher relationship-specific investments and I describe under which conditions which of the two systems is preferable from the procurer's point of view...|$|E

The emergence of global generics companies with capabilities approximating those of 2 ̆ 7 big pharma 2 ̆ 7 has accelerated the blurring of boundaries between the innovator and generics sectors. Biotechnology-based products form a large and growing segment of prescription drug markets and regulatory pathways for biogenerics are imminent. Indian biopharma multinationals with large-scale efficient manufacturing plants and growing R&D capabilities are now major suppliers of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) and generic drugs across both developed and developing countries.

The generics segment in Australia will see high growth rates in coming years but the prospect for local manufacturing is bleak.

40|$|Purpose: The {{widespread}} {{tendency of}} logistics companies to become established {{in close proximity}} to each other has been explained by the existence of collective benefits in doing so. A recent study by the University of Eindhoven (van den Heuvel et al, 2014) has identified that co-located logistics establishments more often combine transport capacity, have better availability of truck drivers, are better accessible, have better availability of repair and maintenance facilities, and have better expansion opportunities than do non-co-located logistics establishments. However, co-location can also be expected to bring a number of shared challenges, relating to the economic and political environment of the day. This study aims to identify those challenges, in order to better inform local government support offered to companies situated within logistic clusters. Research Approach: A two-stage approach was followed. An initial bibliometric analysis was performed in order to identify the key issues that were covered by the academic and trade press over a four year period between 2010 and 2014. The results of this analysis were then used to construct a questionnaire that explored the issues in greater depth.

40|$|Nordic {{residential}} electricity {{consumers can}} now choose {{among a number}} of contracts and suppliers. A large number of households have continued to purchase electricity from the <b>incumbent</b> <b>supplier</b> at default contract terms. In this paper, we compare the situation for such passive customers. Danish default prices are regulated whereas default prices in the other countries are unregulated. Systematic price differences exist among the Nordic countries. However, as wholesale prices sometimes differ the gross margin is a more relevant indicator. Regulated gross margins are lower in Denmark than in Sweden but higher than in Norway and Finland. Because of market design Norwegian default contracts are competitive whereas Swedish contracts provide the retailer with some market power. We interpret the low Finnish margins as a result of municipal retailers continuing traditional pricing from the monopoly period. Danish margins are higher than the competitive Norwegian margins but are earned from a much lower level of consumption. The annually margins earned per consumer are very close in the two countries, which indicates that the Danish regulation is achieving its objective of approaching competitive prices.

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} {{data collection}} owner. The {{aim of this}} project {{is to examine the}} development of competition in domestic electricity supply in the UK following the opening to supply competition in May 1999. This will be examined through the lens of movements in supplier tariff structures, drawing implications for the extent of competition between suppliers. Hence it will supplement existing work investigating consumer search and switching behaviour by means of sampling consumer switching decisions. Using the time path of tariffs, in relation to major cost inputs, questions of whether there is a tendency for <b>incumbent</b> <b>supplier</b> advantages over rival suppliers to persist and whether there is a tendency for prices to move more closely towards costs may be examined. As supplier numbers have fallen over time, investigation of the impact of consolidation on the nature of competition can be pursued. Moreover, there have been periods of both falling and, more recently, rising real input costs, so differences in behaviour across these circumstances can be examined. Finally, inferences may be drawn about companies' views on the extent and nature of consumer search and switching, for comparison with findings on these topics obtained from consumer surveys...|$|E

40|$|While {{there is}} an ever {{increasing}} adoption of e-sourcing, where a buyer auctions off procurement contracts to {{a small group of}} pre-qualified suppliers, {{there is a lack of}} understanding of the impact of dynamic bidding process on procurement outcomes and bidding behavior. To extend the knowledge of this important issue, in this thesis, we explore empirically the value of online procurement auction on cost reduction, quality management, and winner selection from the buyer's perspective. We also explore how incumbent status affects the procurement outcomes. From suppliers' perspective, we characterize their bidding behavior and examine the effect of incumbent status on bidding. First, we collect detailed auction and contract awarding data for manufacturing goods during 2002 - 2004 from a large buyer in the high-tech industry. The rich data set enables us to apply statistical model based cluster technique to uncover heterogeneous bidding behavior of industry participants. The distribution of the bidding patterns varies between <b>incumbent</b> and non-incumbent <b>suppliers.</b> We also find that the buyer bias towards the <b>incumbent</b> <b>suppliers</b> by awarding them procurement contracts more often and with a price premium. Next, focusing on recurring auctions, we find that suppliers bid adaptively. The adaptive bidding is affected by the rank of suppliers' final bids. Finally, with field data of procurement auction for legal services, we demonstrate that service prices are on average reduced after dynamic bidding events. Most interestingly, the cost savings are achieved without the sacrifice of quality. Incumbent winners' quality is higher, on average, than the quality of buyer's supplier base before the auctions, while non-incumbent winner's quality is lower. These findings imply that the main value of online procurement auctions for business services comes from incumbents in the form of reduced price and enhanced quality. We find that after adjusting for incumbents' higher quality, incumbent bias disappears. Our results also imply that the buyer might possess important information about the incumbents, through past experiences, that cannot be easily included in the buyer's scoring function due to uncodifiability.
