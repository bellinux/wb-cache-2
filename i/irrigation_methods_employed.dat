40|$|Graduation date: 1980 The North Unit {{irrigation}} District of Central Oregon, a water project developed {{under the}} guidelines of the Bureau of Reclamation, is characterized by limited water {{and the need for}} efficient utilization and control of the irrigation system. To manage the limited water resource, irrigators need a timely and economical method of detecting problems associated with parameters of the irrigation water management system. The primary objective of this research was to determine the practicality of utilizing thermal infrared imagery and color infrared photography for assessing irrigation water management problems. Within this objective the key tasks were to: examine the relationship between the physical and cultural components that play an integral role in irrigation water management; determine the applications of remote sensing for detecting non-uniformity of water distribution over selected fields during three stages of crop growth; determine the applications of remote sensing for detecting crop response in relation to a diversity of field conditions; determine the application of remote sensing for analyzing conveyance system leakage sites; and examine possible techniques for maintaining proper irrigation water management. A field survey of the area covered by the overflights was used to map patterns of fields and irrigation methods. Additionally, maps showing soil series and percent slope were produced of the overflight coverage area. The survey and maps provided a valuable reference during interpretation of the imagery and photography to determine relationships between soils, topography, crop type, size and shape of fields, and <b>irrigation</b> <b>methods</b> <b>employed.</b> Information on cropping history, soil amendments, and irrigation scheduling strategies were obtained from case study farmers. Ground-based measurements were made in conjunction with overflights to determine field characteristics. This involved precise notation of weather conditions, soil parameters and crop characteristics of case study sites. The thermal infrared imagery (flown May 21, May 24, July 7, and September 7, 1979) and color infrared photography (flown May 12, July 9, and September 7, 1979) were analyzed {{with the aid of a}} stereomicroscope, film viewing light table, and digital image processor. Data gathered through farm interviews, ground-based measurements, and imagery and aerial photographic interpretation were statistically treated using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences program at Oregon State University. The results of this research demonstrate the practicality of using thermal infrared imagery and color infrared photography for detecting problems associated with the irrigation water management system. The thermal infrared imagery was useful for detecting canal leakage, non-uniformity of water distribution at all stages of crop growth, and apparent crop canopy temperatures as an indicator of crop stress. The color infrared photography was useful for detecting crop stress resulting from a variety of field conditions. Field conditions detected on the photography and affecting crop health included physical parameters of the land resource base (soils, topography, and climate), the influence of irrigators through tillage practices, the affect of irrigation water applications, and the influence of applications of herbicides, pesticides, and fertilizers. Additionally, color infrared photography was used to determine the extent of unexpected system problems (e. g. flooding caused by a lateral canal plugging) ...|$|E

A field experiment was conducted using squash (Cucurbita pepo L.) grown in northern Egypt at Shibin El Kom, Menofia. A randomized split-plot design was used with <b>irrigation</b> <b>methods</b> as main plots and different irrigation quantities randomly distributed within either furrow or trickle <b>irrigation</b> <b>methods.</b> <b>Irrigation</b> quantity was a fraction of crop evapotranspiration (ETc) as: 0. 5, 0. 75, 1. 0, 1. 25, and 1. 5 ETc. Each treatment was repeated three times, two of five rows from each replicate were left for squash seed production. In well-watered conditions (1. 0 ETc), seasonal water use by squash was 304 and 344 Â mm over 93 days in spring and 238 and 272 Â mm over 101 days in fall under trickle and furrow <b>irrigation</b> <b>methods,</b> respectively. Squash fruit yield and quality were significantly affected by season and both <b>irrigation</b> <b>method</b> and quantity. Fruit number and length were not affected by <b>irrigation</b> <b>method</b> and growing season, respectively. Interaction between season and irrigation quantity significantly affected leaf area index, total soluble solid (TSS), and fruit weight. Moreover, seed yield and quality were significantly affected by growing season and both <b>irrigation</b> <b>method</b> and quantity except harvest index, which was not affected by <b>irrigation</b> <b>method.</b> Significant differences for the interaction between season and <b>irrigation</b> <b>method</b> were only found for seed yield and 100 seeds weight.

The experiment was in complete randomized blocks design with 3 levels of irrigation-water amount (50 %, 75 % and 100 % of cumulative evaporation from Class A pan) and <b>irrigation</b> <b>methods</b> (tape and furrow irrigations) with 3 replications. The results indicated that regardless to <b>irrigation</b> <b>method,</b> the maximum yield of potato (34. 455 ton/ha) was achieved in irrigation water treatment of 100 % and the minimum yield of potato (19. 168 ton/ha) was achieved in irrigation water treatment of 50 %. The effect of <b>irrigation</b> <b>method</b> on WUE was significant (P< 0. 01). The highest WUE (3. 93 kg/m 3) was belonged to 50 % tape irrigation and the lowest WUE (1. 2 kg/m 3) was belonged to furrow irrigation. Tape irrigation caused an increase of 66 % in WUE as compared to furrow irrigation. The difference in WUE between 50 %, 75 % and 100 % irrigation treatment was not significant.

40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} shown that the {{efficiency}} of water application varies by <b>irrigation</b> <b>method.</b> In general, drip systems are more efficient than sprinklers, and sprinklers are more efficient than gravity or flood irrigation. While the efficiency of each method varies by crop type, this general trend holds true. Surveys of <b>irrigation</b> <b>methods</b> throughout California have been conducted approximately every ten years since 1972. Most recently, Orang et al. (2005) conducted an <b>irrigation</b> <b>method</b> survey in 2001. These surveys show that for most crop types, gravity and sprinkler system use have declined, while micro/drip and subsurface irrigation use have increased. An important exception to this trend is for vegetable crops, for which both sprinkler and drip use has increased. The adoption of more efficient irrigation systems, as implied by the historic data, has led to greater water-use efficiency in the agricultural sector, measured in various ways, including increases in crop produced per unit water applied, decreases in water use per acre, increases in farm income per acre-foot, and so on. We project that this trend will continue and will lead to even greater efficiency improvements in the agricultural sector over time. To explore a “High Efficiency ” scenario for the agricultural sector, we used a three-step process: 1.

The results showed that 163 ha of the studied area were highly suitable for Surface <b>Irrigation</b> <b>methods.</b> Whereas 2288 ha of the study area was highly suitable for drip <b>irrigation</b> <b>methods.</b> Also, it was found that some series coded 2, 3 and 5 covering an area of 7582 ha, were not suitable to be used for surface irrigation systems and two series coded 3 and 5 with an area of 1381 ha were classified not suitable for drip irrigation systems. Moreover, the results indicate that by applying drip irrigation instead of surface <b>irrigation</b> <b>methods,</b> suitability classes of 8732 ha (55. 16 %) of North Molasani plain`s land will improved. Ultimately, drip irrigation system was suggested as the best method to be applied to the said study area. The main limiting factors in using both surface and drip <b>irrigation</b> <b>methods</b> in this area were soil carbonate and drainage...|$|R
40|$|<b>Irrigation</b> <b>method</b> has the {{potential}} to directly or indirectly influence populations of wild bee crop pollinators nesting and foraging in irrigated crop fields. The majority of wild bee species nest in the ground, and their nests may be susceptible to flooding. In addition, their pollination of crops can be influenced by nectar quality and quantity, which are related to water availability. To determine whether different <b>irrigation</b> <b>methods</b> affect crop pollinators, we compared the number of ground-nesting bees nesting and foraging in drip- and furrow-irrigated hybrid sunflower fields in the Sacramento Valley. We found that <b>irrigation</b> <b>method</b> did not impact wild bee nesting rates or foraging bee abundance or bee species richness. These findings suggest that changing from furrow irrigation to drip irrigation to conserve water likely will not alter hybrid sunflower crop pollination...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Reliable {{information}} on <b>irrigation</b> <b>methods</b> {{is important for}} determining agricultural water demand trends. Therefore, a study was conducted during 2002 to collect {{information on}} <b>irrigation</b> <b>methods</b> that were used by growers to irrigate their crops in 2001. The results were compared to earlier surveys to assess trends in cropping and <b>irrigation</b> <b>methods.</b> A one-page questionnaire was developed to collect information on irrigated land by crop and <b>irrigation</b> <b>methods.</b> The questionnaire was mailed to 10, 000 growers in California that {{were randomly selected from}} a list of 58, 000 growers by the California Department of Food and Agriculture, excluding rice, dry-land, and livestock producers. From 1972 to 2002, the area planted has increased from 15 to 31 % for orchards and from 6 to 16 % for vineyards. The area planted to vegetables has remained relatively static, while that planted to field crops has declined from 67 to 42 % of the irrigated area. The land irrigated by low-volume �drip and microsprinkler � irrigation has increased by about 33 %, while the amount of land irrigated by surface methods has decreased by about 31 %. Sprinkler usage has decreased in orchards and vineyards, but it has increased in vegetable crops. DOI: 10. 1061 /�ASCE� 0733 - 9437 � 2008 � 134 : 1 � 96...|$|R

40|$|Improved {{irrigation}} use {{efficiency is}} an important tool for intensifying and diversifying agriculture in Nepal, resulting in higher economic yield from irrigated farmlands with a minimum input of water. Research was conducted to evaluate the effect of <b>irrigation</b> <b>method</b> (furrow vs. drip) on the productivity of nutritious fodder species during off-monsoon dry periods in different elevation zones of central Nepal. A split-block factorial design was used. The factors considered were treatment location, fodder crop, and <b>irrigation</b> <b>method.</b> Commonly used local agronomical practices were followed in all respects except <b>irrigation</b> <b>method.</b> Results revealed that location effect was significant (p < 0. 01) with highest fodder productivity seen for the middle elevation site, Syangja. Species effects were also significant, with teosinte (Euchlaena mexicana) having higher yield than cowpea (Vigna unguiculata). <b>Irrigation</b> <b>method</b> impacted green biomass yield (higher with furrow <b>irrigation)</b> but both <b>methods</b> yielded similar dry biomass, while water use was 73 % less under drip irrigation. Our findings indicated that the controlled application of water through drip irrigation is able to produce acceptable yields of nutritionally dense fodder species during dry seasons, leading to more effective utilization and resource conservation of available land, fertilizer and water. Higher productivity of these nutritional fodders resulted in higher milk productivity for livestock smallholders. The ability to grow fodder crops year-round in lowland and hill regions of Nepal with limited water storages using low-cost, water-efficient drip irrigation may greatly increase livestock productivity and, hence, the economic security of smallholder farmers...|$|R
