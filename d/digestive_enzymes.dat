5|$|Another {{potential}} protocarnivorous pitfall trap is {{a species}} of teasel, Dipsacus fullonum, which has been only suggested as a possible carnivore. Only one major study has examined D. fullonum for carnivory and no evidence of <b>digestive</b> <b>enzymes</b> or foliar nutrient absorption was revealed.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to epitheliomuscular, nerve and interstitial cells, the inward-facing gastroderm ("stomach skin") contains gland cells that secrete <b>digestive</b> <b>enzymes.</b> In some species it also contains low concentrations of cnidocytes, {{which are used}} to subdue prey that is still struggling.|$|E
5|$|Macromolecules such as starch, {{cellulose}} or proteins {{cannot be}} rapidly {{taken up by}} cells and must be broken into their smaller units {{before they can be}} used in cell metabolism. Several common classes of enzymes digest these polymers. These <b>digestive</b> <b>enzymes</b> include proteases that digest proteins into amino acids, as well as glycoside hydrolases that digest polysaccharides into simple sugars known as monosaccharides.|$|E

5|$|Microbes simply secrete <b>digestive</b> <b>enzymes</b> {{into their}} surroundings, while animals only secrete these enzymes from {{specialized}} cells in their guts, including {{the stomach and}} pancreas, and salivary glands. The amino acids or sugars released by these extracellular enzymes are then pumped into cells by active transport proteins.|$|E
5|$|One type of inter-cellular {{communication}} by {{a molecular}} signal is called quorum sensing, which serves {{the purpose of}} determining {{whether there is a}} local population density that is sufficiently high that it is productive to invest in processes that are only successful if large numbers of similar organisms behave similarly, as in excreting <b>digestive</b> <b>enzymes</b> or emitting light.|$|E

5|$|The {{next most}} common type, acinar cell {{carcinoma}} of the pancreas, arises in the clusters of cells that produce these enzymes, and represents 5% of exocrine pancreas cancers. Like the 'functioning' endocrine cancers described below, acinar cell carcinomas may cause over-production of certain molecules, in this case <b>digestive</b> <b>enzymes,</b> which may cause symptoms such as skin rashes and joint pain.|$|E
5|$|Gastric acid acts as {{a barrier}} against {{microorganisms}} to prevent infections and {{is important for the}} digestion of food. Its low pH denatures proteins and thereby makes them susceptible to degradation by <b>digestive</b> <b>enzymes</b> such as pepsin. The low pH also activates the enzyme precursor pepsinogen into the active enzyme pepsin by self-cleavage. After leaving the stomach, the hydrochloric acid of the chyme is neutralized in the duodenum by sodium bicarbonate.|$|E

5|$|Roridula has a {{more complex}} {{relationship}} with its prey. The plants in this genus produce sticky leaves with resin-tipped glands that look {{similar to those of}} larger Drosera. However, the resin, unlike mucilage, is unable to carry <b>digestive</b> <b>enzymes.</b> Therefore, Roridula species do not directly benefit from the insects they catch. Instead, they form a mutualistic symbiosis with species of assassin bugs that eat the trapped insects. The plant benefits from the nutrients in the bugs' feces.|$|E
5|$|Among animals, {{there exists}} a single known example of an {{apparently}} freely-rotating structure, though it is used for digestion rather than propulsion: the crystalline style of certain bivalves and gastropods. The style consists of a transparent glycoprotein rod which is continuously formed in a cilia-lined sac and extends into the stomach. The cilia rotate the rod, so that it becomes wrapped in strands of mucus. As the rod slowly dissolves in the stomach, it releases <b>digestive</b> <b>enzymes.</b> Estimates {{of the speed of}} rotation of the style in vivo vary significantly, and it is unclear if the style is rotated continuously or intermittently.|$|E
5|$|Jaws allow fish {{to eat a}} {{wide variety}} of food, {{including}} plants and other organisms. Fish ingest food through the mouth and break it down in the esophagus. In the stomach, food is further digested and, in many fish, processed in finger-shaped pouches called pyloric caeca, which secrete <b>digestive</b> <b>enzymes</b> and absorb nutrients. Organs such as the liver and pancreas add enzymes and various chemicals as the food moves through the digestive tract. The intestine completes the process of digestion and nutrient absorption.|$|E
40|$|The oral {{ingestion}} of naturally occurring purified trypsin inhibitors from soybean, ovomucoid, and bovine pancreas {{has been demonstrated}} to be a potent stimulus to pancreatic <b>digestive</b> <b>enzyme</b> synthesis. This effect may be so marked as to lead to impairment {{of growth in the}} rat and chicken through the faecal loss of essential amino acids.

40|$|Rats {{infused with}} a supramaximally {{stimulating}} {{dose of the}} cholecystokinin (CCK) analog caerulein develop acute edematous pancreatitis. Using CCK-JMV- 180, a recently developed CCK analog that acts as an agonist at high-affinity CCK receptors but antagonizes the effect of CCK at low-affinity receptors, we have determined that caerulein induces pancreatitis by interacting with low-affinity CCK receptors. Those low-affinity receptors mediate CCK-induced inhibition of <b>digestive</b> <b>enzyme</b> secretion from the pancreas. Our observations, therefore, suggest that this form of experimental pancreatitis results from the inhibition of pancreatic <b>digestive</b> <b>enzyme</b> secretion...|$|R
40|$|Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) show great {{potential}} for mass-rearing, but much is unknown about their digestive capacity and efficiency. This thesis provides an integrated study of survival, growth, behaviour, and <b>digestive</b> <b>enzyme</b> activity in cod larvae and the variability in digestive development in response to nutritional quality of live food enrichments. [...] Experiments were performed investigating the effect of enrichments with live food. The first experiment used high- and low-lipid rotifers (Brachionus plicatilis) from hatching to 450 dd. Lipid level significantly impacted survival, behaviour and <b>digestive</b> <b>enzyme</b> activity by 100 - 150 dd. A second experiment examining Artemia franciscana enrichments from 450 - 650 dd resulted in larvae fed a rotation diet showed the greatest survival and growth rates, but behaviour was not impacted by enrichment type. High-protein and high-lipid diets were able to induce significantly high post-prandial <b>digestive</b> <b>enzyme</b> activities. Results indicate that diet {{plays a role in}} growth and survival, but also in the enzymatic activity of the young fish's developing digestive system. ...|$|R
5|$|Most {{grasshoppers}} are polyphagous, eating vegetation {{from multiple}} plant sources, {{but some are}} omnivorous and also eat animal tissue and animal faeces. In general their preference is for grasses, including many cereals grown as crops. The digestive system is typical of insects, with Malpighian tubules discharging into the midgut. Carbohydrates are digested mainly in the crop, while proteins are digested in the ceca of the midgut. Saliva is abundant but largely free of enzymes, helping to move food and Malpighian secretions along the gut. Some grasshoppers possess cellulase, which by softening plant cell walls makes plant cell contents accessible to other <b>digestive</b> <b>enzymes.</b>|$|E
5|$|Once food {{leaves the}} crop, it passes to the midgut (element 13 in {{numbered}} diagram), {{also known as}} the mesenteron, where the majority of digestion takes place. Microscopic projections from the midgut wall, called microvilli, increase the surface area of the wall and allow more nutrients to be absorbed; they tend to be close to the origin of the midgut. In some insects, the role of the microvilli and where they are located may vary. For example, specialized microvilli producing <b>digestive</b> <b>enzymes</b> may more likely be {{near the end of the}} midgut, and absorption near the origin or beginning of the midgut.|$|E
5|$|Spiders have {{a narrow}} gut {{that can only}} cope with liquid food, and have two sets of filters to keep solids out. Some spiders pump <b>digestive</b> <b>enzymes</b> from the midgut into the prey and then suck the liquified tissues of the prey into the gut, {{eventually}} leaving behind the empty husk of the prey. Others grind the prey to pulp using the fangs and the bases of the pedipalps, while flooding it with enzymes; in these species the fangs and the bases of the pedipalps form a preoral cavity that holds the food they are processing.|$|E
40|$|The {{intertidal}} mussel Mytilus californianus is {{a critical}} foundation species that is exposed to fluctuations in the environment along tidal- and wave-exposure gradients. We investigated feeding and digestion in mussels under laboratory conditions and across environmental gradients in the field. We assessed whether mussels adopt a rate-maximization (higher ingestion and lower assimilation) or a yield-maximization acquisition (lower ingestion and higher assimilation) strategy under laboratory conditions by measuring feeding physiology and <b>digestive</b> <b>enzyme</b> activities. We used <b>digestive</b> <b>enzyme</b> activity to define resource acquisition strategies in laboratory studies, then measured <b>digestive</b> <b>enzyme</b> activities in three microhabitats at the extreme ends of the tidal- and wave-exposure gradients within a stretch of shore (< 20  m) projected sea-ward. Our laboratory results indicated that mussels benefit from a high assimilation efficiency when food concentration is low and have a low assimilation efficiency when food concentration is high. Additionally, enzyme activities of carbohydrases amylase, laminarinase and cellulase were elevated when food concentration was high. The protease trypsin, however, did not increase with increasing food concentration. In field conditions, low-shore mussels surprisingly did not have high enzyme activities. Rather, high-shore mussels exhibited higher cellulase activities than low-shore mussels. Similarly, trypsin activity in the high-shore-wave-sheltered microhabitat was higher than that in high-shore-wave-exposed. As expected, mussels experienced increasing thermal stress {{as a function of}} reduced submergence from low to high shore and shelter from wave-splash. Our findings suggest that mussels compensate for limited feeding opportunities and thermal stress by modulating <b>digestive</b> <b>enzyme</b> activities...|$|R

5|$|Stylidium {{species with}} glandular trichomes on their sepals, leaves, flower parts, or scapes have been {{suggested}} to be protocarnivorous (or paracarnivorous). The tip of the trichome produces a sticky mucilage—a mixture of sugar polymers and water—that is capable of attracting and suffocating small insects. The ability to trap insects may be a defensive mechanism against damage to flower parts. However, trichomes of S.fimbriatum {{have been shown to}} produce <b>digestive</b> <b>enzymes,</b> specifically proteases, like other carnivorous plants. Adding species of Stylidium to the list of plants that engage in carnivory would significantly increase the total number of known carnivorous plants.|$|E
5|$|The broader {{definition}} differs {{mainly in}} including plants {{that do not}} produce their own <b>digestive</b> <b>enzymes</b> but rely on internal food webs or microbes to digest prey, such as Darlingtonia and some species of Heliamphora. The original definition of botanical carnivory, set out in Givnish et. al. (1984), required a plant to exhibit an adaptation of some trait specifically for the attraction, capture, or digestion of prey while gaining a fitness advantage through the absorption of nutrients derived from said prey. Upon further analysis of genera currently considered carnivorous, botanists widened the original definition to include species that use mutualistic interactions for digestion.|$|E
5|$|A cat's {{gastrointestinal}} tract {{is adapted to}} meat eating, being much shorter than that of omnivores and having low levels {{of several of the}} <b>digestive</b> <b>enzymes</b> needed to digest carbohydrates. These traits severely limit the cat's ability to digest and use plant-derived nutrients, as well as certain fatty acids. Despite the cat's meat-oriented physiology, several vegetarian or vegan cat foods have been marketed that are supplemented with chemically synthesized taurine and other nutrients, in attempts to produce a complete diet. However, some of these products still fail to provide all the nutrients cats require, and diets containing no animal products pose the risk of causing severe nutritional deficiencies. However, veterinarians in the United States have expressed concern that many domestic cats are overfed.|$|E

40|$|The {{pancreatic}} duct of anesthetized rabbits was cannulated and, in some animals, flow of pancreatic exocrine secretions {{was blocked}} by raising the cannula to a vertical position. Blockage for 3 - 7 h caused a rapid and significant rise in serum amylase activity {{and an increase in}} amylase activity within the pancreas. The concentration of lysosomal enzymes in the pancreas was not altered but they became redistributed among subcellular fractions and, as a result, an increased amount was recovered in the 1, 000 -g, 15 -min pellet, which was enriched in zymogen granules. Immunofluorescence studies indicated that lysosomal enzymes become localized within organelles which, in size and distribution, resemble zymogen granules. They also contain <b>digestive</b> <b>enzyme</b> zymogens. Blockage of pancreatic secretions also caused lysosomal enzyme-containing organelles to become more fragile and subject to in vitro rupture. These changes noted after short-term pancreatic duct obstruction are remarkably similar to those previously noted to occur during the early stages of diet and secretagogue-induced experimental pancreatitis, observations that have suggested that colocalization of <b>digestive</b> <b>enzyme</b> zymogens and lysosomal hydrolases might result in intracellular <b>digestive</b> <b>enzyme</b> activation and be an important early event in the evolution of those forms of experimental acute pancreatitis...|$|R
