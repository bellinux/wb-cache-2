40|$|AIMS—To {{describe}} the {{variation of the}} phenotype within families with several individuals with Bardet-Biedl syndrome.  METHODS—The phenotypes of affected siblings in 11  Scandinavian families were compared with two or more members who had {{at least three of}} the features: retinal dystrophy, polydactyly, obesity, <b>hypogenitalism,</b> and mental retardation. Individuals without retinal dystrophy were excluded.  RESULTS—Intrafamilial variation of expressivity of the features obesity, polydactyly, abnormal radiograms of the extremities, <b>hypogenitalism,</b> short stature, paraplegia, and dental abnormalities was found. The retinal dystrophy varied with respect to both the onset of symptoms and the course of the disease. The morphology of the fundus, however, was consistent within the families. The disorder showed statistically significant genetic linkage to the BBS 4 locus on chromosome 15  in the affected siblings in two of the families, but the clinical features in these patients did not differ from the other cases of Bardet-Biedl syndrome.  CONCLUSION—Comparison of siblings with the Bardet-Biedl syndrome showed variation of the typical features.

40|$|The study {{included}} 44 Scandinavian individuals with the autosomal recessive inherited Laurence-Moon-Bardet-Biedl syndrome. Inclusion criteria were retinal dystrophy {{plus at least}} 2 more of the remaining traditional cardinal signs of the syndrome: obesity, polydactyly, <b>hypogenitalism</b> and mental retardation. The study showed that the patients had an early onset of night blindness and a poor visual prognosis. No rod ERG-responses to dim blue light were found, even in the youngest- 3 years old. No one exceeding the age of 16 had a best corrected visual acuity of more than 0. 1. The fundus picture was an atypical retinitis pigmentosa with macular pigments previous to any bone spicules. Birth weight and -length were within normal limits, but obesity appeared in early childhood and proceeded to profuse overweight during adolecence. Final height was slightly reduced. Typical skeletal anomalies were polydactyly, short and broad metacarpal bones and flat joint surfaces of the metacarpo- or metatarso-phalangeal joints. <b>Hypogenitalism</b> was noted in nearly all the men but only as an exception in the women. Most patients seemed to have good mental resources. Renal disease was a common cause of death. We found significantly higher frequencies of small or missing teeth and short roots compared to a control group. Substantial variation of the clinical signs was demonstrated both between families and between affected siblings in 11 families with 2 - 3 syndrome members. These families were included in a genetic study of 29 similar families where linkage was confirmed to the BBS 1, BBS 4 and BBS 2 loci on chromosomes 11, 15 and 16.

No information is available regarding the specific function of BBS 2. We show that mice lacking Bbs 2 gene expression have major components of the human phenotype, including obesity and retinopathy. In addition, these mice have phenotypes associated with cilia dysfunction, including retinopathy, renal cysts, male infertility, and a deficit in olfaction. With the exception of male infertility, these phenotypes are not caused by a complete absence of cilia. We demonstrate that BBS 2 retinopathy involves normal retina development followed by apoptotic death of photoreceptors, the primary ciliated cells of the retina. Photoreceptor cell death is preceded by mislocalization of rhodopsin, indicating a defect in transport. We also demonstrate that Bbs 2 –/– mice and a second BBS mouse model, Bbs 4 –/–, have a defect in social function.

Bardet–Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a heterogeneous autosomal recessive disorder characterized by obesity, retinopathy, polydactyly, renal malformations, learning disabilities and <b>hypogenitalism,</b> as well as secondary phenotypes including diabetes and hypertension. BBS knockout mice recapitulate most human phenotypes including obesity, retinal degeneration and male infertility. However, BBS knockout mice do not develop polydacyly.

40|$|The Drosophila svb/ovo gene {{gives rise}} to {{differentially}} expressed transcripts encoding a zinc finger protein. svb/ovo has two distinct genetic functions: shavenbaby (svb) is required for proper formation of extracellular projections that are produced by certain epidermal cells in late-stage differentiation; ovo is required for survival and differentiation of female germ cells. We cloned a mouse gene, movo 1 encoding a nuclear transcription factor that is highly similar to its fly counterpart in its zinc-finger sequences. In mice, the gene is expressed in skin, where it localizes to the differentiating cells of epidermis and hair follicles, and in testes, where it is present in spermatocytes and spermatids. Using gene targeting, we show that movo 1 is required for proper development of both hair and sperm. movo 1 −/− mice are small, produce aberrant hairs, and display <b>hypogenitalism,</b> with a reduced ability to reproduce. These mice also develop abnormalities in kidney, where movo 1 is also expressed.

40|$|The {{functions}} of the proteins encoded by the Bardet–Biedl syndrome (BBS) genes are unknown. Mutations in these genes lead to the pleiotropic human disorder BBS, which is characterized by obesity, retinopathy, polydactyly, renal and cardiac malformations, learning disabilities, and <b>hypogenitalism.</b> Secondary features include diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Recently, {{it has been suggested}} that the BBS phenotypes are the result of a lack of cilia formation or function. In this study, we show that mice lacking the Bbs 4 protein have major components of the human phenotype, including obesity and retinal degeneration. We show that Bbs 4 -null mice develop both motile and primary cilia, demonstrating that Bbs 4 is not required for global cilia formation. Interestingly, male Bbs 4 -null mice do not form spermatozoa flagella, and BBS 4 retinopathy involves apoptotic death of photoreceptors, the primary ciliated cells of the retina. These mutation data demonstrate a connection between the function of a BBS protein and cilia. To further evaluate an association between cilia and BBS, we performed homology comparisons of BBS proteins in model organisms and find that BBS proteins are specifically conserved in ciliated organisms...|$|E
40|$|Loss-of-function {{mutations}} and deletions of the SOX 2 gene {{are known}} to cause uni- and bilateral anophthalmia and microphthalmia as well as related disorders such as anophthalmia-esophageal-genital syndrome. Thus, anophthalmia/microphthalmia is the primary indication for targeted, “phenotype first” analyses of SOX 2. However, SOX 2 mutations are also associated {{with a wide range}} of non-ocular abnormalities, such as postnatal growth retardation, structural brain anomalies, <b>hypogenitalism,</b> and developmental delay. The present report describes three patients without anophthalmia/microphthalmia and loss-of-function mutations or microdeletions of SOX 2 who had been investigated in a “genotype first” manner due to intellectual disability/developmental delay using whole exome sequencing or chromosomal microarray analyses. This result prompted us to perform SOX 2 Sanger sequencing in 192 developmental delay/intellectual disability patients without anophthalmia or microphthalmia. No additional SOX 2 loss-of-function mutations were detected in this cohort, showing that SOX 2 is clearly not a major cause of intellectual disability without anophthalmia/microphthalmia. In our three patients and four further, reported “genotype first” SOX 2 microdeletion patients, anophthalmia/microphthalmia was present in less than half of the patients.

40|$|Purpose: To {{describe}} the clinical features of and identify a novel mutation in Bardet–Biedl syndrome 7 gene (BBS 7) in a Chinese family. Methods: Nineteen individuals {{at risk for}} inheriting Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) in a Chinese family participated in the study. Physical examination was performed and blood was drawn for DNA extraction. Linkage analysis was conducted for all known BBS loci, and mutation screening of BBS 7 gene and BBS 12 gene was performed. Results: A Chinese family with inherited BBS was identified. After performing linkage analysis on all 13 known loci, we found the disease phenotype of a Chinese family with BBS linked to a locus where BBS 7 and BBS 12 genes locate. Conclusions: This study describes a novel mutation in BBS 7 causing BBS in a Chinese family. This is the first report that a mutation in a BBS gene causes BBS in a Chinese population. These results expand the spectrum of human disease associated with mutations of BBS 7 since the initial three mutations in BBS 7 were first identified in 2003.

Fifty eight of 385 patients were examined personally; 28 / 58 patients had PWS and lacked the paternal PW 71 band and 30 / 58 patients, {{who did not}} have PWS, had a normal methylation pattern.

Methods: We examined 3 pairs of siblings with Bardet-Biedl syndrome in whom 3 different mutations in the BBS 4 gene were detected, 2 of which were homozygous for the mutation. Results: All patients had an increased body mass index. The obesity varied between families from moderate to severe. All of the males had <b>hypogenitalism.</b> All had brachydactyly and similar dental anomalies. Polydactyly was present in 5 of the 6 patients. The number and location of the extra digits varied even between siblings. The intelligence varied between families and was within the normal range in 4 individuals. One male had spinal stenosis with paraparesis of his legs. Four patients had increased blood pressure, but only I had impaired renal function. Severe retinitis pigmentosa with onset in early childhood was present in all patients. There were few abnormal retinal pigmentary deposits even at advanced stages. Conclusions: The phenotype of patients with BBS 4 mutations consists of severe retinitis pigmentosa, variable obesity, brachydactyly with variable polydactyly, small or missing teeth, genital hypoplasia, and cardiovascular disease. The combinations of clinical signs are mostly independent of the individual BBS 4 mutation and can vary even within pairs of siblings. It is possible {{that there is a}} characteristic appearance of the ocular fundus in patients with BBS 4 mutations...|$|E
40|$|Children {{born with}} the {{findings}} of microcephaly, cataracts and microcornea can result not only from a prenatal viral infection, but also from an autosomal recessive Mendelian disorders. We present three pairs of affected siblings with MICRO syndrome, who were born with congenital microcephaly, microcornea, and cataracts. MICRO syndrome is an autosomal recessive syndrome consisting of congenital microcephaly, cortical dysplasia, microcornea, cataracts, optic atrophy, severe mental retardation, hypotonic diplegia, and <b>hypogenitalism.</b> At birth, MICRO syndrome resembles Cerebro-Oculo-Facio-Skeletal (COFS) syndrome, but it differs in the lack of the rapidly progressive neurologic features leading to severe brain atrophy with calcifications. Patients with MICRO syndrome manifest frontal cortical dysplasia, hypoplasia of the corpus callosum, cortical blindness with optic atrophy, profound mental retardation, and progressive joint contractures with growth failure. COFS syndrome shares also many clinical and cellular similarities with Cockayne syndrome (CS), and cultured cells in both conditions demonstrate hypersensitivity to ultraviolet (UV) radiation due to impaired nucleotide excision repair (NER). NER studies in cultured fibroblasts from MICRO patients give normal results, so MICRO syndrome should be considered in children with features resembling COFS syndrome and CS, but who have normal NER. MICRO should be distinguished from other similar clinical disorders with normal NER by the presence of significant visual impairment and cortical blindness despite early surgery for congenital cataracts, frontal polymicrogyria, thin corpus callosum, and cortical atrophy by MRI.
