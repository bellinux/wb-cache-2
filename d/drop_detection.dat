40|$|Electronic {{dance music}} (EDM) {{is a popular}} genre of mu-sic. In this paper, we propose a method to {{automatically}} detect the characteristic event in an EDM recording that {{is referred to as}} a drop. Its importance is reflected in the num-ber of users who leave comments in the general neighbor-hood of drop events in music on online audio distribution platforms like SoundCloud. The variability that character-izes realizations of drop events in EDM makes automatic <b>drop</b> <b>detection</b> challenging. We propose a two-stage ap-proach to <b>drop</b> <b>detection</b> that first models the sound char-acteristics during drop events and then incorporates tem-poral structure by zeroing in on a watershed moment. We also explore the possibility of using the drop-related social comments on the SoundCloud platform as weak reference labels to improve <b>drop</b> <b>detection.</b> The method is evaluated using data from SoundCloud. Performance is measured as the overlap between tolerance windows centered around the hypothesized and the actual drop. Initial experimental results are promising, revealing the potential of the pro-posed method for combining content analysis and social activity to detect events in music recordings. 1...|$|E

In the advent of Connected/Automated Vehicle (C/AV) environment, the proposed algorithm {{can be applied to}} capture instantaneous shockwaves constructed from vehicular speed profiles shared by individual equipped vehicles. With a continuous wavelet transform (CWT) method, the algorithm detects abnormal speed drops in real-time and optimizes speed to prevent the shockwave propagating to the upstream traffic. A traffic simulation model is calibrated to evaluate the applicability and efficiency of the proposed algorithm. Based on 100 % C/AV market penetration, the simulation results show that the CWT-based algorithm accurately detects abnormal speed drops. With the improved accuracy of abnormal speed <b>drop</b> <b>detection,</b> the simulation results also demonstrate that the congestion can be mitigated by reducing travel time and delay up to approximately 9 % and 18 %, respectively. It is also found that the shockwave caused by nonrecurrent congestion is quickly dissipated even with low market penetration...|$|E
30|$|A selfish node is a node that {{utilizes}} {{its limited}} resources, such as battery power, CPU time, and memory space purely {{for its own}} purpose. Because of its energy and storage constraints, all incoming data forwarding and route discovery packets are intensely not accepted by it, thereby it tries to save its own resources. The features of the selfish nodes are not forwarding the routing packets, not replying to the hello messages, postponing the route discovery packets, and not forwarding the data packets. The main objective of the proposed work is too detected and eliminates the selfish node in MANET using TBUT. The proposed method consists of a packet <b>dropping</b> <b>detection</b> mechanism and a selfish node quarantining mechanism. In packet <b>dropping</b> <b>detection</b> mechanism, the selfish node is traced and identified. A selfish node quarantine mechanism envisages marking the offending nodes {{so that they do}} not participate any further in the network activities. In this paper, we will explain our proposed TBUT.

30|$|The main {{objective}} of the proposed work is to detect the selfish node in MANET using the Record- and Trust-Based Detection (RTBD) technique. The proposed method consists of a packet <b>dropping</b> <b>detection</b> scheme and a selfish node mitigation scheme. The selfish node is required to generate a trust report during each neighbor, which reports its previous communication reports to the neighboring node. Based on that report, the neighboring node detects if the selfish node has dropped packets. The neighboring node gathers the trust report to detect misreporting and then it finds out which node has dropped packets. A selfish node may report a false record to hide the dropping from being detected.|$|R
30|$|The {{accuracy}} of the structural segmentation task {{is more difficult to}} assess because of its subjective nature [51]. Here, annotations are considered structurally correct if they belong to the correct subset of downbeats at a multiple of eight measures from each other (see Section 3.3). Additionally, the simple labeling of the segments as a “low” or a “high” segment is evaluated. To do so, every transition from a “low” to a “high” segment in each of the 160 songs is listened to and is considered correct if that transition coincides with a drop in the music (see Fig.  2). For 3 out of 160 songs, the 8 -measure offset was incorrect. For 4 out of 160 songs, the assumption that all segmentation boundaries lie at a multiple of 8 measures from each other is incorrect. This means that 95.3 % of the songs received structurally correct annotations. For 82.4 % of these songs, also the <b>drop</b> <b>detection</b> as a “low” to a “high” transition is correct. In the second test set, 94.3 % of the songs with correct downbeat annotations also received structurally correct segmentation annotations.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MIng (Computer and Electronic Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013. With the {{increase}} of mobile and smart device usage, the interest in dynamically forming networks is rising. One such type of network isWireless Mesh Networks (WMNs). WMNs are multi-hop networks, with a decentralised nature that can dynamically form into mesh topologies. Network Coding (NC) is a method {{that is used to}} increase the efficiency of networks by encoding and decoding data on packet level by means of an XOR operation. NC works well with WMNs because it can exploit WMNs broadcast and opportunistic listening properties. When implementing NC on WMNs the issue of security has to be taken into consideration. Dong et al. identified various security threats for intra-flow NC in WMNs. Intra-flow NC combines packets within individual flows, where the information is divided into different flows called generations, to optimize the decoding process. They identified threats for each component of intra-flow NC for WMNs. These components include forwarding node selection, data packet forwarding and acknowledgement delivery. These threats respectively for each component are wormhole attacks and link quality falsification, packet pollution and packet dropping and acknowledgementdropping, injection and delay. We identified that most security schemes focus on packet pollution attacks in NC, but not on any other threats. Packet dropping is also a major threat in networks that is not addressed. Both packet pollution and packet dropping are threats identified for the data forwarding component of WMNs. The Delayed Authentication with Random Transformations (DART) security scheme addresses packet pollution in intra-flow NC systems. The scheme is based on time asymmetry and checksums. The DART scheme only addresses packet pollution and not any of the other identified threats. The DART scheme was selected to be enhanced to also address packet dropping. To enhance the DART scheme we added additional information to the DART scheme’s checksum packets to detect malicious packet dropping nodes in the network. The information added to the checksum packet took the form of a HealthMatrix, which indicates how many packets a node has received and verified. The new scheme, called the Packet <b>Dropping</b> <b>Detection</b> (PDD) scheme collects the additional information from the checksum packets at the receiver node. The receiver sends the collected information to the source node which then uses the information to identify the malicious nodes in the network. These nodes are then removed from the network. The results show that this new scheme causes a small decrease in throughput – about 2 %. The identification of malicious nodes {{can be used as a}} diagnostic tool and faulty nodes can be repaired or removed form the network. The advantage to detect malicious packet dropping nodes far outweighs this decrease in throughput. In this dissertation we investigate the effects of packet pollution and packet dropping on NC networks inWMNs. We also enhance an already existing scheme (DART) to add additional packet <b>dropping</b> <b>detection</b> security to it without a great loss in throughput. Master...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Little {{is known}} of the {{variations}} of the heart rate during spontaneous cardioinhibitory neurally-mediated syncope. Their knowledge has both academic and practical implications for the optimization of rate drop response (RDR) pacing mode. METHODS AND RESULTS: We describe variations of the rhythm occurring during 48 syncopal episodes documented by implantable loop recorder. The presyncopal phase of 18 s (interquartile range 9 - 65) was characterized by a fall in heart rate from 83 +/- 20 bpm to maximal bradycardia or (multiple) asystolic pauses which lasted a median of 19 s (10 - 30). The recovery phase lasted 22 s (7 - 52). The total duration of the cardioinhibitory reflex was 85 s (47 - 116). We then calculated the potential increase in benefit that an optimally programmed <b>drop</b> rate <b>detection</b> could provide compared with a reference Lower Rate detection. Compared with Lower Rate detection (defined as two consecutive beats at 40 bpm), <b>drop</b> rate <b>detection</b> (assumed to be drop size = 20 bpm, detection window = 1 min, and drop rate = 50 bpm) {{would have been able}} to introduce intervention pacing, a median of 5. 7 s (interquartile range - 5. 1 - - 10. 4) earlier in 28 cases (58 %). CONCLUSION: Cardioinhibitory neurally-mediated reflex varies widely from a few seconds to some minutes. In our data the total duration was < 2 min. Optimal RDR programming, being potentially able to anticipate the detection of the cardioinhibitory reflex by a few seconds, could provide an increase in benefit for cardiac pacing therapy in prevention of syncop...|$|R

The bias structures are made up of poly-Si or Al bias rails and poly-Si bias resistors. The structure is implemented on the sensors to allow quality checks to be performed before the bump-bonding process, and to ensure that charge generated in floating pixels due to non-contacting or missing bump-bonds is dumped in a controlled way in order to avoid noise.

40|$|When a {{steganalysis}} detector {{trained on}} one cover source {{is applied to}} images from a different source, generally the detection error increases due to the mismatch between both sources. In steganography, this situation is recognized as the so-called cover source mismatch (CSM). The <b>drop</b> in <b>detection</b> accuracy depends on many factors, including the properties of both sources, the detector construction, the feature space used to represent the covers, and the steganographic algorithm. Although well recognized as {{the single most important}} factor negatively affecting the performance of steganalyzers in practice, the CSM received surprisingly little attention from researchers. One of the reasons for this is the diversity with which the CSM can manifest. On a series of experiments in the spatial and JPEG domains, we refute some of the common misconceptions that the severity of the CSM is tied to the feature dimensionality or their “fragility. ” The CSM impact on detection appears too difficult to predict due to the effect of complex dependencies among the features. We also investigate ways to mitigate the negative effect of the CSM using simple measures, such as by enlarging the diversity of the training set (training on a mixture of sources) and by employing a bank of detectors trained on multiple different sources and testing on a detector trained on the closest source...|$|R
40|$|Problem statement: The {{cooperation}} between the nodes is essential to discover and maintain routes in mobile ad hoc network. Due {{to the presence of}} misbehaving nodes, the node cooperation is not always guaranteed as the nodes agreed during the route discovery phase. This phenomenon results in frequent network partitioning and it makes the routing process difficult. It also degrades the overall network performance and increases the control overhead due to frequent route discovery. Approach: This study proposed an Acknowledgment based Reputation Mechanism (ARM) to detected and isolated the misbehaving links in mobile ad hoc networks. The proposed system introduced a novel dynamic acknowledgment ratio to make the nodes to request its second hop successor in the source route to acknowledge the receipt of the packet. This makes the nodes to detect the behavior of the next hop links and to select the trusted routes for its transmissions. Results: The measured parameters such as packet drop ratio, malicious <b>drop,</b> false <b>detection</b> and send buffer drop are reduced greatly. The results also compared with the existing scheme and with original routing protocol performance. Conclusion/Recommendations: The proposed scheme performs better in detecting and isolating the misbehaving links. The overall network packet drop was decreased which in turn increase the overall network throughput. This shows that the proposed acknowledgment scheme discovers the trusted routes with the presence of misbehaving nodes. </P...|$|R
