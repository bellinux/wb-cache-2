40|$|The {{results of}} an <b>interlaboratory</b> <b>comparison,</b> using various {{measurement}} methods to carry out biodiesel testing, are presented and the findings are discussed. The <b>interlaboratory</b> <b>comparison</b> was organised {{within the framework of}} an EU-funded project called BIOREMA. A general overview of the project and {{results of an}} <b>interlaboratory</b> <b>comparison</b> on bioethanol are published as Part 1 and 2 of this series of papers. In the study presented here, reference values, provided by national metrology institutes and expert laboratories, were used for evaluating the results. Consensus values, derived from the results of all participants, were used to assess any bias between the results from the national metrology institutes and testing laboratories. The emphasis in this <b>interlaboratory</b> <b>comparison</b> was not the performance rating of the individual laboratories, but recognising and interpreting differences caused by the measurement methods applied. For most biodiesel parameters, a good agreement of measurement results was found among different methods, and between the consensus and reference values. The study material was a rapeseed oil fatty acid methyl ester, for which it was demonstrated that it is feasible to prepare and characterise reference materials for biodiesel with well-established reference values for many parameters.

40|$|Introduction. Activities of FSBI “VIMS” {{are aimed}} at {{ensuring}} accuracy and comparability {{of the results of}} mineralogical analyses accompanying exploration and technological work. Evaluation of the research result quality is carried out with the help of various metrological instruments, one of which is an <b>interlaboratory</b> <b>comparison</b> test. Purpose. The purpose of <b>interlaboratory</b> <b>comparison</b> tests (ICTs) is to assess the results of X-ray quantitative phase analysis of an artificial mixture of minerals and to confirm the level of competence of testing laboratories. Methods. The procedure for conducting <b>interlaboratory</b> <b>comparison</b> tests is as follows: development of the programme and its approval; collecting and registering applications from laboratories, willing to participate in the ICT programme; preparation and simultaneous sending of control samples with accompanying information materials to those participating in the experiment; statistical processing of obtained results; drawing up, approval and circulation of documents confirming participation of the laboratories. The control sample is a homogenized artificial mixture of minerals (quartz, kaolinite, calcite and pyrite). The accuracy (quality) control of test results was carried out by X-ray quantitative phase analysis. Results. The ICT results showed a high level of competence of testing laboratories. For unreliable and unsatisfactory results percentages total less than 11 %, the percentage for unfulfilled results is equal to zero. <b>Interlaboratory</b> <b>comparison</b> tests in mineralogical works are an important means for controlling competence of testing laboratories. </p...|$|E

40|$|Listeria monocytogenes, {{like many}} other food-borne bacteria, has certain strains that are {{commonly}} linked to outbreaks. Due to the relatively low numbers of affected individuals, outbreaks of L. monocytogenes {{can be difficult to}} detect. The current technique of molecular subtyping in PulseNet laboratories to identify genetically similar strains is pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). While PFGE is state-of-the-art, <b>interlaboratory</b> <b>comparisons</b> are difficult because the results are highly susceptible to discrepancies due to even minor variations in experimental conditions and the subjectivity of band marking. This research was aimed at the development of a multiple-locus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis (MLVA) that can be implemented in PulseNet laboratories to replace or complement existing protocols. MLVA {{has proven to be a}} rapid and highly discriminatory tool for subtyping many bacteria. In this study, a novel MLVA method for L. monocytogenes strains was developed utilizing eight loci multiplexed into two PCRs. The PCR products were separated by capillary gel electrophoresis for high throughput and accurate sizing, and the fragment sizes were analyzed and clustered based on the number of repeats. When tested against a panel of 193 epidemiologically linked and nonlinked isolates, this MLVA for L. monocytogenes strains demonstrates strong epidemiological concordance. Since MLVA is a high-throughput screening method that is fairly inexpensive, easy to perform, rapid, and reliable, it is well suited to <b>interlaboratory</b> <b>comparisons</b> during epidemiological investigations of food-borne illness...|$|R
