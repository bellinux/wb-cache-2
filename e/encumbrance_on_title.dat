50|$|Under U.S. law a {{judgment}} creditor could file a fi. fa. {{with the land}} records of the locality in which the debtor is believed to own real property. Even though the sheriff may not actually foreclose on the property, the recorded fi. fa. will act as an <b>encumbrance</b> <b>on</b> the <b>title</b> of the property, which can prevent the property from being sold or refinanced without satisfying the related judgment.|$|R
2500|$|Mechanic's liens are {{enforced}} exclusively through judicial foreclosure sales, i.e., through {{court proceedings}} similar to mortgage foreclosures. The court must {{determine whether the}} requirements of the statute have been met and, if so, the priority of the mechanic's lien being foreclosed relative to the other liens or <b>encumbrances</b> <b>on</b> the <b>title.</b> [...] Once that is determined, the court will order the property sold and the proceeds of the sale applied to the liens in the order of their priority.|$|R
5000|$|A {{real estate}} {{contract}} typically does not convey or transfer ownership {{of real estate}} by itself. A different document called a deed is used to convey real estate. In a real estate contract, the type of deed {{to be used to}} convey the real estate may be specified, such as a warranty deed or a quitclaim deed. If a deed type is not specifically mentioned, [...] "marketable title" [...] may be specified, implying a warranty deed should be provided. Lenders will insist on a warranty deed. Any liens or other <b>encumbrances</b> <b>on</b> the <b>title</b> to the real estate should be mentioned up front in the real estate contract, so the presence of these deficiencies would not be a reason for voiding the contract at or before the closing. If the liens are not cleared before {{by the time of the}} closing, then the deed should specifically have an exception(s) listed for the lien(s) not cleared.|$|R

In the majority of jurisdictions in this country, however, covenants may run with the land, but only if there exists privity of estate as defined by the local law...|$|R

He later went on to voyages to Spain and Portugal after the War of 1812. When he died in 1827, his house was inherited by his youngest son, also named Ambrose, although his mother had an <b>encumbrance</b> <b>on</b> the property until her death in 1838. In 1839, his surviving siblings granted him full ownership via a quitclaim deed. The house remained in the Whittlesey family until 1967.|$|R
5000|$|Bid Down the Ownership. The {{investor}} {{willing to}} purchase the lien for the lowest percent of <b>encumbrance</b> <b>on</b> the property will be awarded the lien. For example, a bidder may agree to take a lien on only 95% of the property. If the lien is not redeemed, the investor would only receive 95% ownership of the property with the remaining 5% owned by the original owner. In practice, few investors will bid on liens for less than full right to the property or sale proceeds. Therefore, with multiple owners bidding <b>on</b> 100% <b>encumbrance,</b> the process then generally reverts to a tiebreaker method such as random selection.

5000|$|The {{inheritance}} {{to which}} he succeeded was deep in debt due to mismanagement by Asgill. The difficulty experienced in meeting the heavy <b>encumbrances</b> <b>on</b> the impoverished estate fostered disputes {{in the family and}} drove close relatives into law with each other, much of which was both protracted and costly. It is possible that this financial difficulty caused him to refuse the requests of the poet Aodhagán Ó Rathaille to restore his land to him. This refusal caused Ó Rathaille to compose a bitter and mournful poem in which he launches a vitriolic attack on Browne. In later years however, the estate gained a sound financial position after portions of it were sold.|$|R

50|$|In India, {{before the}} {{formation}} of CERSAI, information <b>on</b> the <b>encumbrance</b> <b>on</b> a property was known only to the borrower and the lender due to fragmented registration system. As a result, people could obtain multiple loans on the same property. Some people used to take one loan from one bank, which would hold the deed papers. Then they used to take several more loans from other banks using attested copies of the deed, by claiming that they had lost the originals. Some people also used to obtain loans using entirely fake title deeds or by using colour photocopies of the original title deed. Properties with unpaid loans were also being sold without informing the buyers of the existing liability on the property.|$|R
40|$|Mortgage {{markets in}} {{developing}} economies, both past and present, are often confined to social networks between private individuals. The inadequate registration of ownership of and <b>encumbrances</b> <b>on</b> borrowers' real estate {{has been offered}} {{as a reason for}} this, but it is questionable whether such registration provides either a simple or a complete explanation. This paper analyses mortgage markets between 1300 and 1800 in the Low Countries, where such registration was organised well, and England, where such registration was poorly organised. These historical cases show that registration was important for the emergence of broad mortgage markets but in the historical context successful markets took considerable time to appear. The rise of such markets also required changes in the mortgage laws and often depended on intermediaries for matching borrowers and lenders...|$|R

Mrs Pitt was not happy about this suggestion and made her feelings known to her husband. As a result, he embarked on a course of conduct putting pressure on Mrs Pitt which the trial judge held amounted to actual undue influence. In consequence, Mrs Pitt eventually agreed to the suggestion. The Pitts had originally purchased the house 1970; they still lived in it, with their two adult daughters. In 1986 the property was valued at £270,000, the only <b>encumbrance</b> <b>on</b> it being a mortgage in favour of a building society for the modest sum of £16,700.|$|R
50|$|In mortgages, an {{attornment}} clause is a clause whereby the mortgagor attorns tenant to the mortgagee, thus giving the mortgagee {{the right to}} distrain, as an additional security. As used in modern legal transactions, the term attornment refers to an acknowledgment {{of the existence of}} the relationship of landlord and tenant. A tenant often has the duty under the tenant's lease, particularly in commercial leases, to provide an attornment upon request, and is required by a creditor or potential buyer of property from the landlord to establish the nature of existing <b>encumbrances</b> <b>on</b> and income streams flowing from a property, as an element of the due diligence process associated with the transaction. Frequently, a tenant must declare the existence of any outstanding disputes with the landlord at the time the attornment is executed and waives any dispute not declared at that time.|$|R
50|$|Napier {{began to}} clear his {{property}} of <b>encumbrances.</b> <b>On</b> 1 June 1555 he redeemed his lands of Gartnes, Stirlingshire, and others from Duncan Forester, and on 14 June 1558 he obtained a precept of sasine for infefting him in the lands of Blairwaddis, Isle of Inchcolm. In 1565 he received the order of knighthood. He seems to have sided with Mary Queen of Scots after her escape from Lochleven Castle. During the siege of Edinburgh Castle, held by Kirkcaldy of Grange for the queen, he was required on 1 May 1572 to deliver up his house of Merchiston to the king's party, who placed in it a company of soldiers to prevent victuals being carried past it to the castle. On this account the defenders of the castle made an attempt to burn it, which was unsuccessful.|$|R
5000|$|Land law is {{the form}} of law that deals with the rights to use, alienate, or exclude others from [...] In many jurisdictions, these kinds of {{property}} {{are referred to as}} real estate or real property, as distinct from personal property. Land use agreements, including renting, are an important intersection of property and contract law. <b>Encumbrance</b> <b>on</b> the land rights of one, such as an easement, may constitute the land rights of another. Mineral rights and water rights are closely linked, and often interrelated concepts.Land rights are such a basic form of law that they develop even where there is no state to enforce them; for example, the claim clubs of the American West were institutions that arose organically to enforce the system of rules appurtenant to mining.
