25|$|Perfectionism {{is a prime}} {{cause for}} {{procrastination}} because demanding perfection usually results in failure. Unrealistic expectations destroy self-esteem and lead to self-repudiation, self-contempt, and widespread unhappiness. To overcome procrastination, {{it is essential to}} recognize and accept the power of failure without condemning, to stop focusing on faults and flaws and to set <b>goals</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> easier to achieve.|$|E

The <b>goals</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> reinforced through incentive pay should be carefully considered {{to make sure they}} are in alignment with the organizational objectives. If there are multiple rewards programs, it is important to consider if there might be any conflicting goals. For example, individual and team-based rewards can sometime work at cross-purposes.|$|E
25|$|In Western cultures, {{predictors}} of happiness include elements that support personal independence, {{a sense of}} personal agency, and self-expression. In Eastern cultures, {{predictors of}} happiness focus on an interdependent self that is inseparable from significant others. Compared to people in individualistic cultures, people in collectivistic cultures are more likely to base their judgments of life satisfaction on how significant others appraise their life than on the balance of inner emotions experienced as pleasant versus unpleasant. Pleasant emotional experiences have a stronger social component in East Asian cultures compared to Western ones. For example, people in Japan are more likely to associate happiness with interpersonally engaging emotions (such as friendly feelings), whereas people in the United States are more likely to associate happiness with interpersonally disengaging emotions (pride, for example). There are also cultural differences in motives and goals associated with happiness. For example, Asian Americans tend to experience greater happiness after achieving <b>goals</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> pleasing to or approved of by significant others compared to European Americans. There is also evidence that high self-esteem, {{a sense of personal}} control and a consistent sense of identity relate more strongly to SWB in Western cultures than they do in Eastern ones. However, {{this is not to say}} that these things are unimportant to SWB in Eastern cultures. Research has found that even within Eastern cultures, people with high self-esteem and a more consistent sense of identity are somewhat happier than those who are low in these characteristics. There is no evidence that low self-esteem and so on are actually beneficial to SWB in any known culture.|$|E
5000|$|If {{we have a}} <b>goal</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> {{currently}} unsatisfied, it will be {{more prominent}} in our minds than a <b>goal</b> <b>that</b> has already <b>been</b> accomplished. Thus, if a protagonist has a <b>goal</b> <b>that</b> has not yet <b>been</b> accomplished, <b>that</b> <b>goal</b> should <b>be</b> more accessible to those who comprehend than a <b>goal</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> just accomplished by the protagonist. In line with this prediction, goals yet to be accomplished by the protagonist were recognized more quickly than <b>goals</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> just accomplished. We are often able to predict people’s future actions by inferring their goals. For example, when we see a man walking over to a chair, we assume that he wants to sit, especially when he has been standing for a long time. Thus, we might generate the inference, “He is going to sit." ...|$|R

The career player begins playing in the minor leagues at AA class, and progresses through AAA class until they are called up to the Major Leagues. The player must accomplish <b>goals</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> given to them by their team manager, which in turn give then skill points if they are completed, and deduct skill points if they are failed or not attempted. There are also [...] "advancement goals" [...] that the player must accomplish over {{a certain period of time}} that will help the player's career player advance to higher levels of play.

2500|$|Goal {{congruence}} {{also plays}} a role in influencing the relationship between one's core self-evaluations and the satisfaction one has with one's job. The theory behind goal congruence argues that people who choose self-concordant (i.e., congruent) goals will be happier with the goals they pursue, be more likely to put in effort towards achieving these goals, and, consequently, {{will be more likely to}} attain their goals. Self-concordant goals include goals that focus on intrinsic factors. [...] For example, a person pursuing a self-concordant goal will choose a goal that they feel is personally important, and that they will enjoy. On the other hand, <b>goals</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> non-self-concordant will focus on more external factors. [...] A person who chooses a non-self-concordant goal will focus on avoiding negative emotions (e.g., anxiety or guilt), satisfying someone else's wishes, or on external rewards, like money. [...] Judge, Bono, Erez, and Locke (2005) found that goal congruence, or choosing self-concordant goals, partially mediates the relationship between core self-evaluations and job satisfaction. [...] The authors explain that individuals with positive self-regard (i.e. high core self-evaluations) believe themselves to be capable and competent and will be less likely to be affected by external factors; thus, they will be more likely to choose self-concordant goals, which will lead to higher satisfaction. [...] On the other hand, individuals with negative self- regard will be susceptible to external factors like anxiety and guilt. [...] These people will be more likely to pursue non-self-concordant goals and will report lower job satisfaction.|$|E
