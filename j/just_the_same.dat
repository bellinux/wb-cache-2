5|$|As Rosenbaum {{describes}} it, Lex views Lana as this beautiful, charming {{girl with}} a little naïveté. It is this naïveté that allows Lex {{to believe that he}} can trust and confide in Lana, and that she is his one true love. Lex also knows that Lana will always love Clark, but he expects her to love him for who he is <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b> Rosenbaum does not believe that Lana gives that to Lex. Writer Holly Harold finds parallels between Lex's relationship with Lana, and that of Lionel's relationship with Martha. Both men believe that these two women will be their saving grace, and pull them back from the dark side. In Lex's defense, Rosenbaum contends that Lex is not using Lana in an effort to hurt Clark, but that he really does love her. The actor believes that Lex's problem {{lies in the fact that}} every time he has loved someone and opened up to them he has been hurt, or betrayed. Even though Lex loves Lana more than anyone else before her, he just cannot bring himself to open up completely for fear of repeating the past. Rosenbaum believes that the eventual dissolution of the marriage between Lex and Lana was a tragic moment in both characters' lives. It is a moment that solidifies Lex's history of opening up to women and having them hurt him.|$|E

25|$|The overall {{form of the}} {{equation}} is not unusual or unexpected, as it uses {{the principle of the}} conservation of energy. The terms of the nonrelativistic Schrödinger equation can be interpreted as total energy of the system, equal to the system kinetic energy plus the system potential energy. In this respect, it is <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as in classical physics.|$|E
25|$|According to Robert Zydendos, karma in Jainism can be {{considered}} a kind of system of laws, but natural rather than moral laws. In Jainism, actions that carry moral significance are considered to cause certain consequences in <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> way as, for instance, physical actions that do not carry any special moral significance. When one holds an apple in one's hand and then let go of the apple, the apple will fall: this is only natural. There is no judge, and no moral judgment involved, since this is a mechanical consequence of the physical action.|$|E

25|$|When {{equipped}} with all transitive edges, these graphs in turn are just special categories, where elements are objects and {{each set of}} morphisms between two elements is at most singleton. Functions between orders become functors between categories. Interestingly, many ideas of order theory are just concepts of category theory in small. For example, an infimum is just a categorical product. More generally, one can capture infima and suprema under the abstract notion of a categorical limit (or colimit, respectively). Another place where categorical ideas occur {{is the concept of}} a (monotone) Galois connection, which is <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as a pair of adjoint functors.|$|E
25|$|Guth {{realized}} {{from his}} {{theory that the}} reason the universe appears to be flat {{was that it was}} fantastically big, <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> way the spherical Earth appears flat to those on its surface. The observable universe was actually only a very small part of the actual universe. Traditional Big Bang theory found values of omega near one to be puzzling, because any deviations from one would quickly become much, much larger. In inflation theory, no matter where omega starts, it would be driven towards equal to one, because the universe becomes so huge. In fact, a major prediction of inflationary theory is that omega will be found to be one.|$|E
25|$|Focusing on the exaggerated indemnity, Twain said:To Dr. Smith the “thirteen-fold-extra” clearly {{stood for}} “theft and extortion,” {{and he was}} right, {{distinctly}} right, indisputably right. He manifestly thinks that when it got scaled away down to a mere “one-third” a little thing like that was some other than “theft and extortion.” Why, only the board knows! I will try to explain this difficult problem so that the board can {{get an idea of}} it. If a pauper owes me a dollar and I catch him unprotected and make him pay me fourteen dollars thirteen of it is “theft and extortion.” If I make him pay only one dollar thirty-three and a third cents the thirty-three and a third cents are “theft and extortion,” <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b>|$|E

He was intimidated, forced to watch videos on cults and told his church was <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b> He said he was watched 24 hours a day. On every visit to the bathroom, he was accompanied by at least two men. Every day, Ross argued with Scott about matters of religion, without giving him a chance to say anything in return, often tapping him or hitting him on the head to underscore his points while Scott was being restrained or closely watched. Scott was told that he would only regain his liberty once the deprogramming had been concluded successfully and he had given up his beliefs.|$|E
25|$|After the {{retirement}} of two cricket legends Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardena from ODIs, Kusal {{was brought to the}} squad as the permanent opening batsman with Tillakaratne Dilshan during ODI series against Pakistan. He just lost the first match for quick 26 runs in Dambulla. In the second match at Pallekele, Kusal smashed Pakistani pace bowlers to all the parts of the ground and scored the joint second fastest ODI fifty by 17 balls with his legendary master Sanath Jayasuriya 17-ball fifty in 1997. The shots of Kusal was described by the international commentators as the dawn of a new Little Sana, with <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> aggressive batting by Sanath in the past. The strike rate of Kusal's innings was 272 and it is now the highest strike rate in an innings of 50 or more runs by a Sri Lanka batsman in ODIs, which he also surpassed his master Jayasuriya's strike rate of 271.42 in 1996 against same opposition.|$|E
25|$|Parker {{was looking}} ahead to the future when he persuaded Presley to sign up as a regular soldier. Presley had wanted to join Special Services, {{allowing}} {{him the opportunity to}} continue to perform {{while at the same time}} getting an easier ride than other soldiers. Parker, on the other hand, was fully aware that any special treatment given to Presley would instantly be used against him in the media and by those who disliked his style of music. If Presley could show the world that he was <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as any other young man, Parker told him, then more people would be likely to accept him and his music. Parker was also afraid that any attempt to block Presley from being drafted would result in a more detailed look into his own service record. He also realized that it would be a great opportunity to promote Presley by having the media witness his induction day, including the Army haircut that would see the most famous hair style in the world destroyed.|$|E

25|$|It wasn't until Dunne {{left the}} Balloon Factory and {{started his own}} company, the Blair Atholl Aeroplane Syndicate Ltd., that a {{monoplane}} could be built. The D.6 was finished in 1911, with a 60hp (45kW) Green in a pusher configuration. Three A-frames supported the wing engine, pilot and undercarriage. All Dunne's tailless aircraft had swept wings with marked washout (reduction of angle of incidence) at the tips. Since sweepback placed the tips well behind the centre of gravity, they provided longitudinal (pitch) stability in <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> way as a conventional tailplane, mounted at lower incidence than the wing. The wing camber increased outwards, causing the outer leading edge to droop further. The inherent design of the wing provided some directional (yaw) stability, which was augmented on the D.6 using down-turned wingtips. The wing had wingtip elevons for control, though because of the down-turned tips these also provided some rudder-like forces. The D.6 was tested at Larkhill on Salisbury Plain in January 1911 but failed to take off.|$|E
