5|$|The Haunted Mask {{was written}} by R. L. Stine and {{originally}} illustrated by Tim Jacobus. The author says {{the idea for the}} book came from his son Matthew Stine, who was wearing a Halloween mask that he <b>had</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>getting</b> off. Stine also says that he incorporated a duck costume his parents got him for trick-or-treating in the book. Tim Jacobus's niece was the model for the cover of the book.|$|E
5|$|The Haunted Mask is the {{eleventh}} book in Goosebumps, {{the series of}} children's horror fiction novels created and authored by R. L. Stine. The book follows Carly Beth, a girl who buys a Halloween mask from a store. After putting on the mask, she starts acting differently and discovers that the mask has become her face; she is unable to pull the mask off. R. L. Stine says he {{got the idea for}} the book from his son who was wearing a mask he <b>had</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>getting</b> off.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} the three-cent nickel piece {{remained}} stable throughout its run, and there are few varieties. An overdate is known, 1887/6. The die that struck those coins was originally dated 1886, when no circulation strikes were made. So the die would not be wasted, the Mint altered the last digit from a 6 to a 7; evidence of both numbers is visible. Some 1865 pieces in proof condition display a wreath on the reverse that comes much closer to touching the rim than on later issues. These were most likely pattern coins but they are accepted as issued because the Mint placed them in some 1865 proof sets. Many of the three-cent nickel pieces were not fully struck, and are missing details of the design; {{this is because the}} head of Liberty is directly opposite the III, and the Mint <b>had</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>getting</b> the hard metal alloy to adequately flow to the high points of both sides.|$|E

5|$|The {{second and}} more {{important}} friendship was with Fanny (Frances) Blood, introduced to Wollstonecraft by the Clares, a couple in Hoxton who became parental figures to her; Wollstonecraft credited Blood with opening her mind. Unhappy with her home life, Wollstonecraft struck {{out on her own}} in 1778 and accepted a job as a lady's companion to Sarah Dawson, a widow living in Bath. However, Wollstonecraft <b>had</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>getting</b> along with the irascible woman (an experience she drew on when describing the drawbacks of such a position in Thoughts on the Education of Daughters, 1787). In 1780 she returned home, called back to care for her dying mother. Rather than return to Dawson's employ after the death of her mother, Wollstonecraft moved in with the Bloods. She realized during the two years she spent with the family that she had idealized Blood, who was more invested in traditional feminine values than was Wollstonecraft. But Wollstonecraft remained dedicated to her and her family throughout her life (she frequently gave pecuniary assistance to Blood's brother, for example).|$|E
25|$|By 1975 Morgan became {{noted for}} its {{lacrosse}} team. Lacrosse, a sport that, up until then, had been dominated by white athletes. Black high school lacrosse players in Maryland and New York still <b>had</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>getting</b> into non-black schools. Morgan was the first—and, until {{the turn of the}} 20th century, the only—historically black university to field a lacrosse team.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of the local stores were never rebuilt because, even though store owners had great desire to rebuild, they <b>had</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>getting</b> loans; myths about the area arose discouraging investment {{in the area and}} preventing growth of employment. Few of the rebuilding plans came to be because business investors as well as the community members rejected South L.A.|$|E

25|$|Iban Mayo, {{struggling}} the {{day before}} already, <b>had</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>getting</b> up the climbs from the first few meters yet again. He was also extremely annoyed by the cameraman following him and filming his struggle, as that camerman knew Mayo was probably {{going to give up}} and was waiting for him to do so.

Aoki defeated Clementi by way of Neck Crank/Rear Naked Choke at the 2:32 minutes mark of the second round.|$|E
25|$|The Bills intercepted Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino twice, {{recovered}} three fumbles, forced four sacks, {{and held}} Miami to just 33 rushing yards. Although the Buffalo offense <b>had</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>getting</b> {{into the end}} zone because they played the game with a rusty Jim Kelly back in command of the offense {{for the first time in}} the postseason, kicker Steve Christie made an NFL playoff record-tying five field goals. Thurman Thomas, who had been knocked out of the game in both of the Bills prior two playoff contests, rushed for 96 yards and caught five passes for 70, while Kenneth Davis added 61 rushing yards and four receptions for 52.|$|E

25|$|A {{group of}} {{regional}} farmers in Brampton <b>had</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>getting</b> insurance from city-based companies. After several meetings in Clairville Hall, {{they decided to}} found the County of Peel Farmers Mutual Fire Insurance Company. In 1955, when the company moved to its third and current location, 103 Queen Street West, it took the new name of Peel Mutual Insurance Company. It reigns as the longest-running company in modern Brampton. Harmsworth Decorating Centre was established in 1890, as Harmsworth and Son, operated out of the family's house on Queen Street West. The current location was purchased on September 1, 1904, after a fire destroyed their original store. Purchased for $1,400, the 24 Main Street South location is the longest-operating retail business {{in what is now}} Brampton.|$|E
25|$|In 1997, Mutombo {{with the}} Mutombo Foundation began {{plans to open}} a $29 million, 300-bed {{hospital}} on the outskirts of his hometown, the Congolese capital of Kinshasa. Ground was broken in 2001, but construction didn't start until 2004, as Mutombo <b>had</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>getting</b> donations early on although he personally donated $3.5 million toward the hospital's construction. Initially Mutombo had some other difficulties, almost losing the land to the government because it was not being used and having to pay refugees who had begun farming the land to leave. He also struggled to reassure some {{that he did not have}} any ulterior or political motives for the project. The project has been on the whole very well received at all social and economic levels in Kinshasa.|$|E
25|$|In the 1905 provincial elections, Liberals won 16 of 25 {{seats in}} Saskatchewan. The Saskatchewan {{government}} bought out Bell Telephone Company in 1909, {{with the government}} owning the long-distance lines and left local service to small companies organized at the municipal level. Premier Thomas Walter Scott preferred government assistance to outright ownership because he thought enterprises worked better if citizens had a stake in running them; he set up the Saskatchewan Cooperative Elevator Company in 1911. Despite pressure from farm groups for direct government involvement in the grain handling business, the Scott government opted to loan money to a farmer-owned elevator company. Saskatchewan in 1909 provided bond guarantees to railway companies {{for the construction of}} branch lines, alleviating the concerns of farmers who <b>had</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>getting</b> their wheat to market by wagon.|$|E

25|$|After taking Friday off—a {{feature of}} the event {{timetable}} unique to Monaco— the drivers returned to action on Saturday in bright weather conditions. All of the leading drivers <b>had</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>getting</b> clear air as they fought for clear space around the narrow circuit which had been made worse by them taking longer than usual to get optium tyre temperature. Despite having difficulties with his car's handling and narrowly avoiding an accident at Tabac corner, Hamilton set the fastest lap of the weekend so far with a late lap of one minute and 16.758 seconds, half of {{a tenth of a}} second quicker than the second-placed Ricciardo. Rosberg was third-fastest; Vettel in the other Red Bull was fourth, with the two Ferrari drivers in fifth and sixth (with Alonso faster than Räikkönen). Pérez was seventh-fastest, Hülkenberg eighth, Vergne ninth and Daniil Kvyat completed the top ten ahead of qualifying. Vergne ran off the track at Sainte Dévote and Mirabeau corners. Ericsson went into the Dévote run-off area and reversed to rejoin the track.|$|E

500|$|Several reviewers {{regarded}} Ace {{as one of}} {{the best}} available flight simulators of the time. Overall, the critics agreed that the game's arcade-like gameplay was easy to get into and play, but ultimately difficult to master and challenging to finish. Reviewers also negatively remarked upon the inclusion of Lenslok copy protection system where the game would display a garbled image and the player would need to use the provided colored lens to view the two-letter code. ZX Computing and Computer Gamer reviewers <b>had</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>getting</b> it to work and pass. Retro Gamer called it [...] "notorious Lenslok" [...] in retrospect.|$|E
500|$|The {{production}} team's {{decision to}} write an episode about stand-up comedy was influenced by comedy festivals.

The [...] "Canyonero" [...] sequence was modeled after Ford commercials and was given its own segment {{at the end of}} the episode because the production staff liked it so much. The episode was highlighted by USA Today in a review of The Simpsons ninth season and received positive reviews in The Washington Times, the Evening Herald, and in books on The Simpsons.|$|E
