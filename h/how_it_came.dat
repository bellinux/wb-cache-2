5|$|A {{documentary}} film was commissioned {{to celebrate the}} 25th anniversary of Last of the Summer Wine. Produced and directed by Alan J. W. Bell, it featured interviews {{with the majority of}} cast and crew members, outtakes from the show, and a behind-the-scenes look at production. Segments with Duncan Wood and Barry Took explained the origins of the show and <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> to be filmed in Holmfirth. The documentary was broadcast on 30 March 1997.|$|E
5|$|After {{it first}} came to light in October, {{it was found that}} it had been posted to YouTube several months earlier, along with a {{similarly}} threatening message in binary code. The poster of that video, known as AETBX, has suggested to inquiring journalists that GadgetZZ is not telling the truth about <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> to possess the video. Internet investigators managed to establish that it was filmed in the former Zofiówka Sanatorium outside Otwock, Poland, sometime between November 2013 and the video's release.|$|E

5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the book's publication, responses to the tale were published by W. M. Swepstone (Christmas Shadows, 1850), Horatio Alger (Job Warner's Christmas, 1863), Louisa May Alcott (A Christmas Dream, and <b>How</b> <b>It</b> <b>Came</b> True, 1882), and others who followed Scrooge's life as a reformed man– or some who thought Dickens had got it wrong {{and needed to be}} corrected.|$|E
5|$|Part of the Ebenezer Avery House {{history is}} <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> {{to be used}} after the battle while its owner was absent. Some of the wounded from the battle, those unable to walk, {{including}} Stephen Hempstead, were taken prisoner and placed on a wagon with others to be taken down to the fleet. The British men allowed the wagon to run down the hill, where it stopped when it struck a tree, throwing {{some of the men}} off the wagon and aggravated their injuries.|$|E
5|$|Although it is {{not fully}} {{understood}} <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> to his attention, Rochdale Town Hall was admired by Adolf Hitler. It has been suggested a visit by Hitler in 1912–13 while staying with his half-brother Alois Hitler, Jr. in Liverpool, or military intelligence on Rochdale, or information from Nazi sympathiser William Joyce (who had lived in Oldham), brought the building to his attention. Hitler admired the architecture {{so much that it}} is believed he wished to ship the building, brick-by-brick, to Nazi Germany had German-occupied Europe encompassed the United Kingdom. Rochdale was broadly avoided by German bombers during the Second World War.|$|E

5|$|The bull {{appears to}} have had a sacred role in a number of Celtic cults. The animal was viewed {{positively}} by the Celts as an image of fertility and abundance; one tribe, the Taurini, even adopted the bull's name. It is unknown <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> to be associated with bodies of water {{in the form of the}} water bull, but historian and symbologist Charles Milton Smith has suggested that such mythological creatures might originate with the water spouts that can form over the surface of Scottish lochs, which can give the impression of a living form as they move across the water.|$|E
25|$|The {{foundations}} of first-order logic were developed independently by Gottlob Frege and Charles Sanders Peirce. For {{a history of}} first-order logic and <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> to dominate formal logic, see José Ferreirós (2001).|$|E

50|$|Ellen White in her {{writings}} {{does not}} link perfection {{to something that}} happens from the believer, but with what God does for the believer through Christ, and those who try to trust in their own righteousness cannot understand <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> through Christ.|$|R
25|$|On 24 September, Meagher's handbag {{was found}} by police in a laneway near Hope Street, Brunswick. This was close to where she lived. Police were {{suspicious}} as to <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> to be there because the area had previously been searched by them.|$|E
25|$|In August, Rockstar {{submitted}} the re-edited version to the ESRB, who granted it an M rating on 24 August.

On 29 August, ESRB President Patricia Vance stated that the ESRB {{had no intention of}} revealing <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> to the decision to downgrade the rating.|$|E
25|$|High Peak stands {{slightly}} {{apart from}} other major peaks in the Catskills, squarely {{in the middle of}} the Catskill Escarpment, the sudden rise of the peaks from the Hudson Valley floor. From the valley, it is easy to understand <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> to be seen as the highest peak in the Catskills, since there are no higher peaks close to it. It is bracketed by the only two gaps in the Escarpment — Platte Clove to the south and Kaaterskill Clove to the north.|$|E

25|$|The oldest, the Regius poem, {{is unique}} in being set in verse. The rest, of which over a hundred survive, usually have a three part construction. They start with a prayer, {{invocation}} of God, or a general declaration, followed by {{a description of the}} Seven Liberal Arts (logic, grammar, rhetoric, arithmetic, geometry, music and astronomy), extolling Geometry above the others. There follows a history of the craft, and <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> to the British Isles, usually culminating in a general assembly of masons during the reign of King Athelstan. The last part consists of the charges or regulations of the lodge, and the craft of masonry in general, which the members are bound to maintain.|$|E
25|$|The Oxus {{treasure}} (Persian: گنجینه آمودریا) is {{a collection}} of about 180 surviving pieces of metalwork in gold and silver, the majority rather small, plus perhaps about 200 coins, from the Achaemenid Persian period which were found by the Oxus river about 1877-1880. The exact place and date of the find remain unclear, and it is likely that many other pieces from the hoard were melted down for bullion; early reports suggest there were originally some 1500 coins, and mention types of metalwork that are not among the surviving pieces. The metalwork is believed to date from the sixth to fourth centuries BC, but the coins show a greater range, with some of those believed to belong to the treasure coming from around 200 BC. The most likely origin for the treasure is that it belonged to a temple, where votive offerings were deposited over a long period. <b>How</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> to be deposited is unknown.|$|E

50|$|In baseball, a batted ball is {{any ball}} that, after a pitch, is {{contacted}} by the batter's bat. One or more of several terms are used to describe a batted ball, depending on <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> off the bat and where in the field it lands.|$|R
