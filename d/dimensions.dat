5|$|General {{relativity}} {{does not}} place any {{limits on the}} possible <b>dimensions</b> of spacetime. Although the theory is typically formulated in four <b>dimensions,</b> one can write down the same equations for the gravitational field {{in any number of}} <b>dimensions.</b> Supergravity is more restrictive because it places an upper limit on the number of <b>dimensions.</b> In 1978, work by Werner Nahm showed that the maximum spacetime dimension in which one can formulate a consistent supersymmetric theory is eleven. In the same year, Eugene Cremmer, Bernard Julia, and Joel Scherk of the École Normale Supérieure showed that supergravity not only permits up to eleven <b>dimensions</b> but is in fact most elegant in this maximal number of <b>dimensions.</b>|$|E
5|$|One notable {{feature of}} string theory and M-theory {{is that these}} {{theories}} require extra <b>dimensions</b> of spacetime for their mathematical consistency. In string theory, spacetime is ten-dimensional (nine spatial <b>dimensions,</b> and one time dimension), while in M-theory it is eleven-dimensional (ten spatial <b>dimensions,</b> and one time dimension). In order to describe real physical phenomena using these theories, one must therefore imagine scenarios in which these extra <b>dimensions</b> would not be observed in experiments.|$|E
5|$|Subdivision rules {{can easily}} be {{generalized}} to other <b>dimensions.</b> For instance, barycentric subdivision is used in all <b>dimensions.</b> Also, binary subdivision can be generalized to other <b>dimensions</b> (where hypercubes get divided by every midplane), as in the proof of the Heine–Borel theorem.|$|E
50|$|If {{the above}} limit does not exist, one may still take the limit {{superior}} and limit inferior, which respectively define the upper box <b>dimension</b> and lower box <b>dimension.</b> The upper box <b>dimension</b> {{is sometimes called}} the entropy <b>dimension,</b> Kolmogorov <b>dimension,</b> Kolmogorov capacity, limit capacity or upper Minkowski <b>dimension,</b> while the lower box <b>dimension</b> is also called the lower Minkowski <b>dimension.</b>|$|R

50|$|The <b>dimension</b> of the cokernel {{plus the}} <b>dimension</b> {{of the image}} (the rank) add up to the <b>dimension</b> of the target space, as the <b>dimension</b> of the {{quotient}} space W/T(V) is simply the <b>dimension</b> of the space minus the <b>dimension</b> of the image.|$|R
5|$|Tessellations {{in three}} or more <b>dimensions</b> are called honeycombs. In three <b>dimensions</b> there is just one regular honeycomb, which has eight cubes at each {{polyhedron}} vertex. Similarly, in three <b>dimensions</b> there is just one quasiregular honeycomb, which has eight tetrahedra and six octahedra at each polyhedron vertex. However, there are many possible semiregular honeycombs in three <b>dimensions.</b> Uniform polyhedra can be constructed using the Wythoff construction.|$|E
5|$|A {{theory of}} strings that {{incorporates}} {{the idea of}} supersymmetry is called a superstring theory. There are several different versions of superstring theory which are all subsumed within the M-theory framework. At low energies, the superstring theories are approximated by supergravity in ten spacetime <b>dimensions.</b> Similarly, M-theory is approximated at low energies by supergravity in eleven <b>dimensions.</b>|$|E
