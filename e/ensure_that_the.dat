5|$|After {{the guns}} were fired, each rifle barrel {{had to be}} cleaned. Unlike small caliber guns which can be field-stripped, the guns aboard an Iowa-class {{battleship}} could not be disassembled, so the gunners mates assigned the job of cleaning the rifles required a full day or more to <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> barrels were correctly and adequately cleaned. To clean the rifles, a bore brush was lifted by two sailors and inserted into the gun barrel, where it was pulled through the rifle with the same equipment used to load the shells. Within the turret, crewmen checked to <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> breech fittings were properly cleaned and lubricated, while sailors outside the turret scraped off soot, and painted over flash burns left from the explosive expulsion of the 16-inch shells from the gun barrels.|$|E
