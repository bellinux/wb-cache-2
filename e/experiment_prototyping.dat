40|$|Changes on {{interaction}} technologies {{over the}} last decades {{have the potential to}} mark a paradigm shift from Graphical User Interfaces (GUI), which has been the dominant interaction paradigm for thirty years. These new devices aim to provide a more natural way of interaction, constituting the Natural User Interfaces (NUI), by taking advantage of the skills we have naturally acquired through our experience with the world. The success of multi-touch displays, one of the interfaces that benefit from a NUI design, made designers rush into developing novel interfaces for them. However, they end up ignoring and violating well-known interaction design principles. In order to find standards in designing these, designers should be allowed the freedom to <b>experiment.</b> <b>Prototyping</b> is recommended, {{in order to reduce the}} cost of experimenting. However, the tool support is limited in this area. At the same time, prototyping tools can benefit from the NUI paradigm, in particular by run-ning on a multi-touch display, which is something that is still lacking research and exploration. These interfaces offer more versatile and natural way of prototyping, similar to paper-based pro-totyping, which is the method preferred by interaction designers...|$|E

40|$|The {{optimization}} of hydro-pneumatic suspension {{parameters of}} a multi-axle heavy motorized wheel dump truck {{is carried out}} based on virtual and real <b>prototype</b> <b>experiment</b> integrated Kriging model in this article. The root mean square of vertical vibration acceleration, {{in the center of}} sprung mass, is assigned as the optimization objective. The constraints are the natural frequency, the working stroke, and the dynamic load of wheels. The suspension structure for the truck is the adjustable hydro-pneumatic suspension with ideal vehicle nonlinear characteristics, integrated with elastic and damping elements. Also, the hydraulic systems of two adjacent hydro-pneumatic suspension are interconnected. Considering the high complexity of the engineering model, a novel kind of meta-model called virtual and real <b>prototype</b> <b>experiment</b> integrated Kriging is proposed in this article. The interpolation principle and the construction of virtual and real <b>prototype</b> <b>experiment</b> integrated Kriging model were elucidated. Being different from traditional Kriging, virtual and real <b>prototype</b> <b>experiment</b> integrated Kriging combines the respective advantages of actual test and Computer Aided Engineering simulation. Based on the virtual and real <b>prototype</b> <b>experiment</b> integrated Kriging model, the optimization results, obtained by experimental verification, showed significant improvement in the ride comfort by 12. 48 % for front suspension and 11. 79 % for rear suspension.

40|$|Questions {{with long}} {{distance}} dependencies: A usage-based perspective EWA DĄBROWSKA* Attested questions with long-distance dependencies (e. g. What {{do you think}} you’re doing?) tend to be quite stereotypical: the matrix usually clause consists of a WH word, the auxiliary do or did, the pronoun you, and the verb think or say, with no other elements; and they virtually never contain more than one subordinate clause. This has lead some researchers in the usage-based framework (Dąbrowska 2004, Verhagen 2005) to hypothesise that speakers’ knowledge about such constructions is best {{explained in terms of}} relatively specific, low level templates rather than general rules that apply “across the board”. The research reported here was designed to test this hypothesis and alternative hypotheses derived from rule-based theories.
