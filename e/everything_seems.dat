Fringe co-creator Roberto Orci described Nimoy's character as [...] "a mix of Howard Hughes and Bill Gates", while Nimoy referred to Bell as a [...] "master of the universe" [...] who is [...] "brilliant, wealthy and very powerful". Nimoy's part of the final scene of the episode with Olivia was very brief. Nimoy described the scene as [...] "interesting, entertaining" [...] and [...] "that you'll {{want to see more}} of this relationship and what it's all about". Actress Anna Torv described the final scene as calm yet threatening, [...] "That's what's kind of cool about working on Fringe, is <b>everything</b> <b>seems</b> kind of calm and lovely, but there's always something going on underneath".

500|$|The Strawberry Panic! {{short stories}} were {{initially}} panned by Erica Friedman as being [...] "distinctly derivative of Maria-sama ga Miteru". Friedman {{is the president}} of Yuricon, an anime convention geared towards fans of yuri anime and manga, and ALC Publishing, a publishing house dedicated to yuri. Friedman described the stories as, [...] "candy apples without the apples - all sugary, and gooey and sweet, with not much of anything else to support it". After initially having this stance for the entire series, including an early opinion on the anime version, Friedman later changed her opinion slightly, writing that [...] " [...] turned out pretty good". She went on to say, [...] "There's no denying that Strawberry Panic! wasn't brilliant, but considering that {{it was meant to be}} trashy, it pulled out a few moments of dignity and elegance out of the trash heap." [...] Jason Thompson regarded the Strawberry Panic! manga as [...] "a nearly plotless cascade [...] <b>everything</b> <b>seems</b> rushed, and it is difficult to keep track of the characters and plot." ...|$|E
500|$|The diaries {{of writers}} and journalists such as William Camden, Celia Fiennes, Daniel Defoe, John Byng and William Cobbett {{illustrate}} {{the decline of}} Ely after the 14th century plague and the 16th century reformation {{which led to the}} dissolution of the monastery in 1539. In the 1607 edition of Britannia, chorographic surveyor William Camden records that [...] "as for Ely it selfe, it is no small Citie, or greatly to be counted off either for beauty or frequency and resort, as having an unwholsome aire by reason of the fens round about". In 1698, Celia Fiennes was writing [...] "the Bishop [...] does not Care to stay long in this place not being for his health… they have lost their Charter… and its a shame [...] does not see it better ordered and ye buildings and streetes put in a better Condition. They are a slothful people and for little but ye takeing Care of their Grounds and Cattle wch is of vast advantage". Daniel Defoe, when writing in the Eastern Counties section of A tour thro' the whole island of Great Britain (1722), went [...] "to Ely, whose cathedral, standing in a level flat country, is seen far and wide… that some of it is so antient, totters so much with every gust of wind, looks so like a decay, and seems so near it, that when ever it does fall, all that 'tis likely will be thought strange in it, will be, that it did not fall a hundred years sooner". On his way to a Midlands tour, John Byng visited Ely on 5July 1790 staying at the Lamb Inn. In his diary he writes that [...] "the town [...] is mean, to the extreme… those withdrawn, their dependancies must decay". Recording in his Rural Rides on 25March 1830, William Cobbett reports that [...] "Ely is what one may call a miserable little town: very prettily situated, but poor and mean. <b>Everything</b> <b>seems</b> to be on the decline, as, indeed, is the case everywhere, where the clergy are the masters".|$|E

Works accomplished have real impact on its history. What can be argued from one of the senses or meaning of its name: [...] "Court", is the strategic importance for the Purépecha political and economic structure, to maintain this site in control of towns within its regime. It is pointed out, the construction of large reservoirs to lodge the mortuary remains of people socially important, in contrast with multiple burials directly in the ground; the majority with sacrifice evidence, beheaded and dismembered. These were located {{in front of one of}} the main buildings, known as [...] "the Temple".|$|E

Mark's not malicious - he's worked as a nurse all his life - but he's certainly unreliable", imparting that he feels Mark as a phobia of authority. Although Powell stated in 2005 that Mark loved his wife and daughter dearly, he elaborated that: [...] "He's a man to whom <b>everything</b> <b>seems</b> like a good idea at the time! Tends to avoid confrontation but this is probably because he is beset by women!" [...] In 2008, a year after Tricia's death, the character referred to himself on-screen as [...] "By day, fearless Consultant Nurse. By night, lonely old fart." ...|$|E

Hazel is disgusted by this and yells at him saying that he's already got cancer and he wants to pay money for more cancer, [...] "Not being able to breathe sucks," [...] she yells. Augustus calmly explains the metaphor, which is, [...] "You put the thing that kills you right between your teeth but you don't give it the power to kill you." [...] Hazel, impressed by this, goes to his place to watch a movie. Augustus is at the meeting to support his friend, Isaac, whose only remaining eye is soon to be removed due to cancer. Hazel and Augustus strike a bond immediately and agree to read each other's favorite novels.

After Augustus finishes reading her book, he is frustrated upon learning that the novel ends abruptly without a conclusion. Hazel explains the novel's author had retreated following the novel's publication and has not been heard from since.|$|E
