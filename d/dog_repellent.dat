40|$|I {{appreciate}} {{the opportunity to}} convey the current and future status of rodenticides and predacides at this workshop. According to the computer, the Agency has 2, 888 products classified as vertebrate control agents. The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act tends to clump all vertebrate pesticides as rodenticides. This includes fish toxicants such as TFM; bird toxicants and repellents such as Starlicide and Avitrol; <b>dog</b> <b>repellents</b> such as lemongrass oil; bat toxicants and repellents such as naphthalene; commensal rodent toxicants such as warfarin, diphacinone, bromadiolone, brodifacoum, and red squill; field use rodenticides for many species (e. g., prairie dogs, ground squirrels) using pesticides such as 1080, strychnine, zinc phosphide; predacides such as 1080 and sodium cyanide; and animal browsing repellents such as thirara and putrescent whole egg solids...|$|R
40|$|Let {{me first}} {{indicate}} that I {{have been interested}} in wildlife damage control programs for a good part of my life. My first experience, {{at the tender age of}} 6 years, was hard to accept when coyotes killed my 4 -H pig. The importance of wildlife damage control has been clear to me since that time. Unfortunately, the importance of control is not often clear to those people who have not directly experienced wildlife damage. On my first arrival in Texas in 1962. coyote populations were increasing in the state. At that time I was given the charge from the Texas Agricultural Experiment Station (TAES) of conducting sheep and goat research at one of the stations near the Ft. Hood military reservation. It became apparent that this location was really not the place to conduct sheep and goat research because of extensive predation. As a matter of fact, probably because of that experience more than anything else, TAES has conducted some research on a continuous basis to develop techniques to protect sheep and goats. The type of protection researched has ranged from electric fencing and other barriers to guard <b>dogs,</b> <b>repellents</b> and attractants...|$|R
5000|$|... 2-Undecanone {{is used in}} the {{perfumery}} and flavoring industries, {{but because}} of its strong odor it is primarily used as an insect repellent or animal repellent. Typically, 1 - 2% concentrations of 2-undecanone are found in <b>dog</b> and cat <b>repellents</b> {{in the form of a}} liquid, aerosol spray, or gel.|$|R
