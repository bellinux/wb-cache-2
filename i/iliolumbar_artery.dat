50|$|The lumbar {{branch of}} the <b>iliolumbar</b> <b>artery</b> (ramus lumbalis) {{supplies}} the psoas major and quadratus lumborum, anastomoses with the last lumbar artery, and sends a small spinal branch through the intervertebral foramen between the last lumbar vertebra and the sacrum, into the vertebral canal to supply the cauda equina.|$|E
50|$|It then pierces the transversalis fascia {{and passes}} medially along the inner {{lip of the}} crest of the ilium to a point where it {{perforates}} the transversus abdominis muscle. From there, it travels posteriorly between the transversus abdominis muscle and the internal oblique muscle to anastomose with the <b>iliolumbar</b> <b>artery</b> and the superior gluteal artery.|$|E
5000|$|On {{its course}} the artery takes several small {{branches}} (i.e. anterior segmental medullary arteries), which enter the vertebral canal through the intervertebral foramina. These branches {{are derived from}} the vertebral artery, the ascending cervical artery, {{a branch of the}} inferior thyroid artery in the neck, the intercostal arteries in the thorax, and from the lumbar artery, <b>iliolumbar</b> <b>artery</b> and lateral sacral arteries in the abdomen and pelvis.|$|E
50|$|The iliac {{branch of}} the <b>iliolumbar</b> <b>artery</b> (ramus iliacus) descends to supply the iliacus muscle; some offsets, running between the muscle and the bone, anastomose with the iliac {{branches}} of the obturator artery; one of these enters an oblique canal to supply the bone, while others run along {{the crest of the}} ilium, distributing branches to the gluteal and abdominal muscles, and anastomosing in their course with the superior gluteal artery, iliac circumflex artery, and the lateral circumflex femoral artery. This anastamosis occurs around the anterior superior iliac spine.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} the origin, distribution pattern, branches, and neighboring {{structures of the}} <b>iliolumbar</b> <b>artery</b> (ILA) concerning the anterolateral surgical approaches to the spine. Methods: This study was performed in the Anatomy Department of Medical School, Mersin University, Mersin, Turkey between 2014 and 2015. Pelvises of 11 male formalin-fixed human cadavers were dissected by anterior and posterior approaches under surgical microscope. The origins, distribution patterns, calibers, and distances to certain structures were measured.

40|$|Contrast {{angiography}} {{with carbon}} dioxide (CO 2) is frequently used {{in patients with}} renal dysfunction or iodinated contrast allergies, as CO 2 is nonallergenic, nontoxic, and rapidly absorbed in the blood. However, when delivered intra-arterially, {{there is a possibility}} that CO 2 may create a vapor lock with resultant transient ischemia. We describe a case of suspected CO 2 embolus to the <b>iliolumbar</b> <b>artery</b> after iliac artery stenting resulting in immediate loss of bilateral lower extremity motor and sensory function.

40|$|Internal iliac artery (IIA) shows {{great deal}} of {{variations}} in its branching pattern. The knowledge of its variant branches is required for successful surgical, orthopedic, plastic surgery and radiological procedures. We observed variations {{of some of the}} branches of right IIA in an adult male cadaver. The <b>iliolumbar</b> <b>artery</b> originated from the main trunk of the IIA. After this, IIA divided into anterior and posterior divisions. The posterior division gave lateral sacral and superior gluteal arteries. Superior gluteal artery pierced the lumbosacral trunk before leaving the pelvis. The anterior division further divided into anterior and posterior trunks. Anterior trunk gave rise to superior vesical, inferior vesical, middle rectal and obturator arteries. The posterior trunk gave two inferior gluteal arteries and an internal pudendal artery...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} whether {{the presence of}} type 2 endoleak after internal iliac artery (IIA) coil embolization in patients with residual antegrade flow through the coils is more frequent than in patients who presented with total occlusion of the IIA after embolization. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Records were reviewed of 45 patients who underwent unilateral (n = 37) or bilateral (n = 8) IIA coil embolization between 1998 and 2004 for endovascular repair of aortoiliac aneurysms (n = 32), iliac artery aneurysms (n = 12), pseudoaneurysm (n = 1), or distal type 1 endoleak after placement of an aortoiliac stent-graft (n = 8). A total of 53 IIAs were embolized by means of coils and/or microcoils. Computed tomography (CT) was used for follow-up in 40 patients, angiography was used in three, and color Doppler ultrasonography was used in three. RESULTS: At {{the end of the}} embolization procedure, 23 IIAs were occluded and 30 IIAs demonstrated residual antegrade flow through the coils. Control CT demonstrated two type 2 endoleaks after endovascular stent-graft placement resulting from retrograde blood flow into the left IIA main branch via a patent <b>iliolumbar</b> <b>artery.</b> One of these two patients showed residual antegrade flow through the coils {{at the end of the}} IIA embolization procedure, and the other patient underwent complete coil embolization of the ostia of the anterior and posterior division but not of the main trunk of an aneurysmal IIA. CONCLUSION: IIA coil embolization with residual antegrade flow through the coils causes no greater incidence of type 2 endoleak after aortoiliac or iliac stent-graft placement. However, care must be taken in case of a proximal postostial origin of the <b>iliolumbar</b> <b>artery</b> on the IIA, which may cause type 2 endoleak if not embolized. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPurposeSeveral {{types of}} endoleaks have been described, each with {{different}} methods of treatment. Conventional arteriography {{is widely regarded}} as the gold standard for the classification of endoleaks. Recently, faster magnetic resonance gradients have allowed for rapid data acquisition and review of vascular studies as a real-time continuous angiogram (time resolved magnetic resonance angiography [TR-MRA]). This study was performed to compare the findings of TR-MRA with conventional angiography for the characterization of endoleaks. MethodsBetween June 2002 and June 2003, 12 patients with documented endoleaks following endovascular repair of aortic aneurysms (10 abdominal and two thoracic) underwent TR-MRA to identify and characterize the endoleak. All patients had nitinol-based aortic stent grafts. MRA was performed on a 1. 5 -Tesla magnet (Sonata class; Siemens Medical Systems, Iselin, NJ). The TR-MRA studies were reviewed under continuous observation as a “cine MR angiogram. ” These MRA data sets were used to classify the endoleaks into types 1 through 3. The patients underwent conventional angiography following the MRA to confirm the findings and to plan treatment. The MRA findings were compared with the findings made at conventional arteriography. ResultsTR-MRA identified seven patients with type 1 leaks, including four proximal and three distal. Four patients had type 2 leaks, including two arising from the inferior mesenteric artery and two from an <b>iliolumbar</b> <b>artery.</b> One patient had a type 3 leak. Conventional angiography confirmed the type of endoleak in all 12 patients. Conclusion: These initial results demonstrate TR-MRA to be an effective noninvasive method for classifying endoleaks. This technique may allow for screening of patients with endoleaks to identify those requiring urgent repair...|$|E
