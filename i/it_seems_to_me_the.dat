25|$|Since {{my life as}} a {{prisoner}} has begun, I have heard the teachings of the white man's religion, and in many respects believe it to be better than the religion of my fathers... Believing that in a wise way it is good to go to church, and that associating with Christians would improve my character, I have adopted the Christian religion. I believe that the church has helped me much during the short time I have been a member. I am not ashamed to be a Christian, and I am glad to know that the President of the United States is a Christian, for without the help of the Almighty I do not think he could rightly judge in ruling so many people. I have advised all of my people who are not Christians, to study that religion, because <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> best religion in enabling one to live right.|$|E

2500|$|The December 1997 {{issue of}} The Comics Journal {{featured}} an extensive collection of testimonials to Peanuts. Over forty cartoonists, from mainstream newspaper cartoonists to underground, independent comic artists, shared {{reflections on the}} power and influence of Schulz' art. Gilbert Hernandez wrote [...] "Peanuts {{was and still is}} for me a revelation. It's mostly from Peanuts where I was inspired to create the village of Palomar in Love and Rockets. Schulz' characters, the humor, the insight... gush, gush, gush, bow, bow, bow, grovel, grovel, grovel..." [...] Tom Batiuk wrote: [...] "The influence of Charles Schulz on the craft of cartooning is so pervasive it is almost taken for granted." [...] Batiuk also described the depth of emotion in Peanuts: [...] "Just beneath the cheerful surface were vulnerabilities and anxieties that we all experienced, but were reluctant to acknowledge. By sharing those feelings with us, Schulz showed us a vital aspect of our common humanity, which is, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>the</b> ultimate goal of great art." ...|$|E
