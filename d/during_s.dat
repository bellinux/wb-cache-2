25|$|ATR is {{involved}} in arresting the cell cycle in response to DNA double-stranded breaks. ATR has an obligate checkpoint partner, ATR-interacting-protein (ATRIP), and together these two proteins are responsive to stretches of single-stranded DNA that are coated by replication protein A (RPA). The formation of single-stranded DNA occurs frequently, more often during replication stress. ATR-ATRIP is able to arrest the cell cycle to preserve genome integrity. ATR is found on chromatin <b>during</b> <b>S</b> phase, similar to RPA and claspin.|$|E
25|$|In G1 {{phase of}} the cell cycle, many of the DNA {{replication}} regulatory processes are initiated. In eukaryotes, {{the vast majority of}} DNA synthesis occurs <b>during</b> <b>S</b> {{phase of the}} cell cycle, and the entire genome must be unwound and duplicated to form two daughter copies. During G2, any damaged DNA or replication errors are corrected. Finally, one copy of the genomes is segregated to each daughter cell at mitosis or M phase. These daughter copies each contain one strand from the parental duplex DNA and one nascent antiparallel strand.|$|E
25|$|Binding of Cdc45 to {{chromatin}} {{depends on}} Clb-Cdc28 kinase activity {{as well as}} functional Cdc6 and Mcm2, which suggests that Cdc45 associates with the pre-RC after activation of S-phase cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). As indicated by the timing and the CDK dependence, binding of Cdc45 to chromatin is crucial for commitment to initiation of DNA replication. <b>During</b> <b>S</b> phase, Cdc45 physically interacts with Mcm proteins on chromatin; however, dissociation of Cdc45 from chromatin is slower than that of Mcm's, which indicates that the proteins are released by different mechanisms.|$|E

We find that lowincome intensity was higher in most provinces <b>during</b> the 1990 <b>s</b> than <b>during</b> the 1980 <b>s</b> (comparing comparable positions in the business cycle). During the 1990 s changes in government transfers did not offset the fall in employment earnings among lower-income families, as they did <b>during</b> the 1980 <b>s,</b> resulting in an increase in low-income intensity. Whether or not the relationship between economic growth and low-income intensity weakened in any kind of permanent way <b>during</b> the 1990 <b>s</b> as compared to the 1980 s is unclear from this analysis. ...|$|R
25|$|Loading of Mcm {{proteins}} {{can only}} occur during the G1 {{of the cell}} cycle, and the loaded complex is then activated <b>during</b> <b>S</b> phase by recruitment of the Cdc45 protein and the GINS complex to form the active Cdc45–Mcm–GINS (CMG) helicase at DNA replication forks. Mcm activity is required throughout the S phase for DNA replication. A variety of regulatory factors assemble around the CMG helicase to produce the ‘Replisome Progression Complex’ which associates with DNA polymerases to form the eukaryotic replisome, the structure of which is still quite poorly defined in comparison with its bacterial counterpart.|$|E
25|$|In fission yeast and Xenopus, {{chromatin}} {{licensing and}} DNA replication factor 1 (Cdt1) protein {{is required for}} the licensing of chromatin for DNA replication. Cdt1 is essential for DNA replication and performs its role during the formation of the pre-replicative complex by loading the minichromosome maintenance proteins (Mcm) onto the chromosome. Cdt1 has been shown to associate with the C terminus of Cdc6 to cooperatively promote the association of Mcm proteins to the chromatin. Cdt1 activity during the cell cycle is tightly regulated by its association with the protein geminin, which both inhibits Cdt1 activity <b>during</b> <b>S</b> phase in order to prevent re-replication of DNA and prevents it from ubiquitination and subsequent proteolysis.|$|E
25|$|For DNA polymerases to function, the {{double-stranded}} DNA helix {{has to be}} unwound {{to expose}} two single-stranded DNA templates for replication. DNA helicases are responsible for unwinding the double-stranded DNA during chromosome replication. Helicases in eukaryotic cells are remarkably complex. The catalytic core of the helicase is composed of six minichromosome maintenance (Mcm2-7) proteins, forming a hexameric ring. Away from DNA, the Mcm2-7 proteins form a single heterohexamer and are loaded in an inactive form at origins of DNA replication as a head-to-head double hexamers around double-stranded DNA. The Mcm proteins are recruited to replication origins then redistributed throughout the genomic DNA <b>during</b> <b>S</b> phase, indicative of their localization to the replication fork.|$|E
40|$|The {{proportion}} of college graduates in the United States labor force increased steadily after 1970. On the other hand, skill premium decreased <b>during</b> the 1970 <b>s</b> but it increased <b>during</b> the 1980 <b>s</b> and the 1990 s. The law of demand and supply explains {{the decrease in}} the skill premium <b>during</b> the 1970 <b>s.</b> Why did skill premium increase <b>during</b> the 1980 <b>s</b> and the 1990 s? This paper develops a novel economic growth theory, in which the level of education affects economic outcomes through economic institutions and policies. The model suggests {{that the increase in}} the {{proportion of}} college graduates in the United States labor force in the 1970 s may have been a causal factor in both the decline in the college premium <b>during</b> the 1970 <b>s</b> and the large increase <b>during</b> the 1980 <b>s</b> and the 1990 s. I argue that the proportion of skilled workers in the labor force determines their relative importance in the political process. Thus, the increase in the proportion of skilled workers <b>during</b> the 1970 <b>s</b> reduced skill premium in the short run, but induced a change in policies that increased the skill premium in the subsequent decades above its initial value. ...|$|R
40|$|Until recently, Colombia was {{regarded}} as a success story in terms of economic growth and stability. To a large extent, this reputation was based on the macroeconomic performance between the 1930 s and 1970 s, which was characterized by increasing GDP growth rates combined with a reduction in volatility (measured by the standard deviation in growth rates). In fact, GDP growth rose to an annual average of 5. 8 % <b>during</b> the 1970 <b>s</b> from 3. 8 % <b>during</b> the 1930 <b>s.</b> The standard deviation in the growth rate fell from around 3 % <b>during</b> the 1930 <b>s</b> and 1940 s to 1 % <b>during</b> the 1960 <b>s.</b> The economics profession, both nationally and internationally, impressed with this performance, considered Colombia as a paradigm of macroeconomic management, praising the combination of able technocrats and sound institutions as the key driving elements of this success story. In contrast, economic growth has not been encouraging since 1980.

2500|$|Kinetochores start, control, and {{supervise}} the striking movements of chromosomes during cell division. [...] During mitosis, which occurs after chromosomes are duplicated <b>during</b> <b>S</b> phase, two sister chromatids are held together, {{each with its}} own kinetochore, which face in opposing directions and attach to opposite poles of the mitotic spindle. Following the transition from metaphase to anaphase, the sister chromatids separate from each other, and the individual kinetochores on each chromatid drive their movement to the spindle poles that will define the two new daughter cells. Finally, two intermediate genes from sperm cells combine with the chromatids to encode hormones for pure sexual pleasure. Thus, the kinetochore is essential for the chromosome segregation that is classically associated with mitosis and meiosis.|$|E
