This article focuses on <b>digital</b> security <b>governance</b> in the context of the Passenger Name Record (PNR), the Advance Passenger Information (API) and the Terrorist Finance Tracking System (TFTP) programmes.

40|$|Educational {{institutions}} and governing practices are increasingly augmented with digital database technologies that function as {{new kinds of}} policy instruments. This article surveys and maps the landscape of digital policy instrumentation in education and provides two detailed case studies of new digital data systems. The Learning Curve is a massive online data bank, produced by Pearson Education, which deploys highly sophisticated digital interactive data visualizations to construct knowledge about education systems. The second case considers ‘learning analytics’ platforms that enable the tracking and predicting of students’ performances through their digital data traces. These digital policy instruments are evidence of how digital database instruments and infrastructures are now at the centre of efforts to know, govern and manage education both nationally and globally. The governing of education, augmented by techniques of <b>digital</b> education <b>governance,</b> is being distributed and displaced to new digitized ‘centres of calculation’, such as Pearson and Knewton, with the technical expertise to calculate and visualize the data, plus the predictive analytics capacities to anticipate and pre-empt educational futures.

40|$|Abstract. Urban grid {{management}} (UGM), {{as a new}} urban <b>digital</b> <b>governance</b> pattern, {{has been}} applied {{in more and more}} Chinese cities in recent years. After analyzing the <b>digital</b> <b>governance</b> practices in Beijing- the key technology, management method, management procedure and implementation effect of the UGM pattern, we find that UGM pattern is capable of both simplifying administrative process and improving the government management efficiency, while the target of <b>digital</b> <b>governance</b> to provide quality public service and expand public participation has been ignored. Therefore, an urban <b>digital</b> <b>governance</b> framework based on grid management consisting of four modules and eight systems is put forward in this paper.
