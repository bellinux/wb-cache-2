I think women prefer men to be well-mannered, so I always try to watch my manners. They like men to be well dressed, so I <b>do</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> observe this. Others bring to my notice the fact that I sometimes make grammatical errors in my speech; so, because of this, I try to watch my grammar – {{but at the same time}} I bear in mind that it's more profitable for me to be entertaining than to be perfect in my use of English.|$|E
500|$|Malouma Mediah was {{involved}} in a project in 2009, to relocate 9,000 slum-dwelling families from {{the outskirts of the city}} into inner city neighborhoods. She insisted that for health reasons, improvements would first have to be made to the infrastructure. In August 2011, the International Union for Conservation of Nature appointed Malouma as Goodwill Ambassador for Central and West Africa. The position required her to raise awareness of environmental problems with a view to introducing sustainable solutions. On her appointment she commented: [...] "I am delighted at the confidence that IUCN just placed in me. I am deeply honored.

[...] In September 2012, she performed in a concert given during the 2012 IUCN World Conservation Congress held on Jeju Island, South Korea.|$|E
500|$|Sanford {{announced}} in late December 1997 {{that he had}} been diagnosed with inoperable esophageal cancer and that his doctors said he had a few months to live. After his release from the hospital, his condition slowly deteriorated. He died in his sleep while surrounded by his family at his Durham home. He was 80years old. At his funeral, he was eulogized by a childhood friend who said Sanford [...] "took [...] oath when he was twelve years old and kept it. It started out, 'On my honor, I will <b>do</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> do my duty to God and my country,' and included such things as 'help other people at all times.' He believed it. He was the eternal Boy Scout." [...] Sanford is entombed in the crypt of Duke University Chapel.|$|E

On playing Harry as {{a figment of}} Dexter's imagination, James Remar told Vanity Fair that [...] "it's {{challenging}} to play a specter in somebody’s current existence." [...] He said: [...] "In my own life, I find myself doing some task [...] and {{having a conversation with}} my mother or father, who are both deceased. [...] I suspect lots of people do it. And when I hold that conversation, different images of my parents appear to me. And so it's my job to <b>do</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> be that image in Dexter's mind."

They are energized because those moments are the staple of the show, {{but at the same time}} they are very somber. Michael doesn't really like to interface with a lot of people on those days, because it's such a serious subject matter." ...|$|E

2500|$|At Melbourne, Park {{had been}} one of the youngsters sent to the [...] "special net" [...] for Armstrong's attention. Armstrong had been impressed, Park awestruck, later {{crediting}} Armstrong with [...] "most of my cricket brains". They were an odd sight in partnership, like a planet and its satellite, but their simpatico was deep. During the match against South Australia, for example, Park joined his captain with an hour left of the second day and shared a thunderous stand. Over lunch on the third day, with Park 226 and himself 101, Armstrong recalled his own eight-year-old record score for Victoria: [...] "Parky, you haven't far to go to beat my 250.

I think I am in a strong position because I accomplished my goals." [...] Barrett had spent more than $1 million of her own money {{in the attempt to}} defeat Symington, who she stated she did not dislike personally, but simply felt that she could do a better job as Governor. On September 13, 1994, Symington defeated Barrett in the primary by a margin of 68% to 32%. Political analysts stated that Barrett had failed to distinguish herself from the incumbent Governor, and ran a flawed campaign.|$|E
2500|$|Touch the Clouds and {{his band}} finally {{returned}} in February 1878 to the Cheyenne River Reservation in central South Dakota. [...] He lived there {{the remainder of his}} life. By the spring of 1882, the last remaining Minneconjou bands had returned to Cheyenne River, bringing together the tribe {{for the first time in}} several decades. By this time, only three of the traditional six headmen of the tribe were still alive. [...] In 1882, the Minneconjou either affirmed or appointed new leaders to fill vacancies. [...] Touch the Clouds was confirmed as a [...] "shirt wearer" [...] to fill the position of his late father. The other new leaders selected included White Bull, Big Crow, White Swan and Touch the Bear.

[...] Ford is the only American mentioned favorably in Mein Kampf, although he is only mentioned twice: Adolf Hitler wrote, [...] "only a single great man, Ford, , to [...] fury, still maintains full independence... the controlling masters of the producers in a nation of one hundred and twenty millions." [...] Speaking in 1931 to a Detroit News reporter, Hitler said he regarded Ford as his [...] "inspiration," [...] explaining his reason for keeping Ford's life-size portrait next to his desk. Steven Watts wrote that Hitler [...] "revered" [...] Ford, proclaiming that [...] "I shall <b>do</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> put his theories into practice in Germany," [...] and modeling the Volkswagen, the people's car, on the Model T.|$|E

2500|$|His Bar Mitzvah {{speech was}} {{on the subject of}} the plight of the European Jews and the impact that World War II events would have on Jewish people around the world. He said, upon {{becoming}} a man under Jewish law: [...] "As I ... find happiness in joining the ranks of Israel, the knowledge of the tragic suffering of my fellow Jews ... makes this ... an occasion to reflect upon the heritage of my people—which now becomes mine. ... I shall try to understand my people and <b>do</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> share the responsibilities which history has placed upon all of us." [...] He later wrote to a friend from childhood: [...] "I should have been born into the German-speaking Jewish community of Prague in 1922 and died in a gas chamber some 20 years later. How I came to be born in the Bronx Hospital, I'll never quite understand." [...] Milgram married his wife, Alexandra, in a ceremony at the Brotherhood Synagogue in Greenwich Village in Manhattan on December 10, 1961, and they had two children, Michele and Marc.|$|E
2500|$|Due to Michael Strahan's retirement, Tuck was {{promoted}} to starting defensive end. When asked about the pressure of replacing Strahan, Tuck replied [...] "Pressure? No, I'm smart enough to realize there's only one Strahan and there will always only be one Strahan. I'm not trying to replace Michael Strahan. I'm just trying to fill in and <b>do</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> help this football team win. I'm not pinning that pressure on my back, as far as {{going out there and}} getting 22 sacks in a season." [...] But Tuck started his 2008 campaign in Michael Strahan-like fashion by sacking Washington Redskins quarterback Jason Campbell in the first play of the season opener. The Giants went on to defeat their division rivals the Washington Redskins 16–7. Tuck followed his exceptional performance in week one with an outstanding performance against the St. Louis Rams. Tuck finished the game with 2.0 sacks and an interception return for a touchdown in a Giants victory in week two. The interception and touchdown marked the first of Tuck's professional career. The touchdown was his first since his junior season at Notre Dame.|$|E

[...] José María López felt his team were due to secure a good finish following a poor performance in the previous race and {{said they had been}} preparing hard for the event. He was looking forward to competing in Paris {{for the first time and}} expected to achieve a good points-scoring position. Heidfeld was seeking another podium finish to enable Mahindra to keep third place in the Teams' Championship but was wary of cold weather conditions which caused several cars to struggle with cold tyre temperatures in the previous year's race. Vergne felt his home event of Paris would be his [...] "best race of the year" [...] and praised the effort the city put in to stage the annual contest, [...] "The Paris track is not the kind of track we have been to except for Hong Kong - really bumpy, narrow, difficult to drive - so we'll see how it goes." ...|$|E

I'm going to come before Osiris, who will {{probably}} give me a few dirty looks because I know I've committed some things I shouldn't have." [...] Because the Muslims and Christians wouldn't let [...] "a heathen" [...] be buried in their graveyards, Omm Sety built her own underground tomb decorated with a false door. Through this door the Ka was believed to travel between this world and the next, and it was engraved with an offering prayer in conformance with ancient beliefs. The staff of Chicago House gave her an imitation Shawabti figurine to place in the tomb. On 10 April 1981 she gave away her two cats as her condition deteriorated. On 15 April she {{received a letter from}} Olivia Robertson confirming that Omm Sety had been enrolled in the Fellowship of Isis, an interfaith spiritual movement focused on the goddess, on 23 March. On 21 April 1981 Omm Sety died in Abydos. The local health authority refused to allow her to be buried in the tomb she had constructed, so she was interred in an unmarked grave, facing the west, in the desert outside a Coptic cemetery.|$|E
2500|$|Following a {{difficult}} Mexico City race where he finished 14th, Buemi, the pre-race favourite, entered the Monaco event {{with a lot}} of hope and expectation, saying: [...] "Monaco {{is one of the best}} tracks on the calendar. I have great memories from 2015 and I will <b>do</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> win a second time here." [...] Di Grassi was looking forward to his [...] "home race" [...] because he had knowledge of the track as he was residing in Monaco at the time of the event and wanted to carry over his momentum from his Mexico City win into the principality: [...] "We made an important step with the victory in Mexico to keep the championship exciting. We are once again in striking distance." [...] However, he did not have the championship in his mind because his team wanted to focus on securing race victories and amassing points. Heidfeld said he was looking forward to racing in Monaco where he has extensive experience because of him competing in other motorsport series at the track and felt his chances of winning were improved with an competitive car. He stated Mahindra displayed good performance and set themselves the objective of scoring more points than in the previous two races.|$|E

Spears further explained, [...] "I'm gonna do [...] slowly but surely [...] I'm gonna try to <b>do</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> do an amazing album, but it's not my full priority right now".
