40|$|SUMMARY: Bacterial counts made, over {{a period}} of 27 months, on skin, <b>gut</b> <b>and</b> <b>gill</b> samples of freshly caught skate and lemon sole, using sea {{water-based}} and tap water-based media in parallel, revealed a seasonal variation {{in the size of the}} bacterial populations on the fish throughout the year. Evidence is presented for the view that the occurrence of maximum bacterial populations on fish is correlated with plankton outbursts. Sea water-based medium was generally superior to a tap water-based medium for isolating bacteria from fish; the importance of this as evidence of a specific marine bacterial flora is discussed. Bacteria occur in appreciable numbers on the skin <b>and</b> <b>gills</b> <b>and</b> in the intes-tinal contents of fish (Harrison, Perry & Smith 1926). However, it is generally accepted that the internal organs and the muscle tissues of (healthy) live or freshly caught fish are sterile (Anderson, 1907; Proctor & Nickerson, 1935). The spoilage of fish as a foodstuff is due to the activities of bacteria normally present on the living fish which, after the animal’s death, penetrate into the muscle tissues and decompose them.

The following parameters were evaluated: Shewanella putrefaciens and Pseudomonas spp, Total Microbial Count (TMC), and Enterobacteriaceae. Microbiological stability of specimens reared in the semiintensive plant was higher than that found in specimens reared in the intensive plant. The concentration limit of Shelf life fixed by several authors (10 7 c. f. u. /g for Pseudomonas spp. and 10 6 c. f. u. /g for S. putrefaciens) occurred earlier in the specimens of Sparus auratacoming from the intensive plant.

Aerobic colony count (ACC) and total coliform bacteria (TCB) were enumerated using tryptone soy agar and MacConeky agar, respectively. Most probable number (MPN) was employed to assess the coliform bacteria numbers in the water. Results showed that the mean log ACC and TCB in the AM were 5. 97  CFU g− 1 and 5. 08  CFU g− 1, in the PM were 5. 77  CFU g− 1 and 4. 66  CFU g− 1 and in the G were 5. 96  CFU g− 1 and 4. 89  CFU g− 1, respectively.

40|$|Artemin is {{a member}} of the glial cell line-derived {{neurotrophic}} factor (GDNF) family. It is a neurotrophic factor that supports neurite migration and outgrowth and survival of the sympathetic and sensory nervous system. Artemin has been studied in human and murine tissues, but no study has been devoted to nonmammalian species. Zebrafish is a teleost fish belonging to the family Ciprinidae, which is becoming an important model species for genetic and developmental studies. Thus, the aim of the present investigation was to evaluate, by immunochemical and immunocytochemical analyses, the tissue distribution pattern of artemin in zebrafish. Different isoforms of artemin with corresponding different molecular weights were detected in the brain, muscle, testis, ovary, kidney, <b>gut,</b> <b>and</b> <b>gills</b> of zebrafish by Western blot analysis. Immunocytochemical analysis showed artemin-like immunoreactivity in different cell types: in glial cells and rare neurons of the central nervous system, taste buds, retina, neuromasts of the lateral line, dorsal root ganglia, sympathetic ganglia, gill epithelium, tubular kidney epithelium, <b>gut</b> epithelium <b>and</b> ganglia, pancreas, thyroid, hypothalamus, testis, and ovary. These results indicate a wide distribution of artemin-like immunoreactivity in adult zebrafish, related to the presence of different forms of artemin.

In order to better understand the potential of environmental NSAIDS for interruption of normal levels COX products in fishes, we developed an LC/MS/MS-based approach for tissue analysis of 7 prostanoids. Initial studies examining muscle, <b>gut</b> <b>and</b> <b>gill</b> demonstrated that prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) was the most abundant of the measured prostanoids in all tissues <b>and</b> that <b>gill</b> tissue had the highest and most consistent concentrations of PGE 2.

The lower exposures did not result in significant reductions when compared to unexposed controls. Measured tissue concentrations of ibuprofen indicated that this NSAID had little potential for bioaccumulation (BCF 1. 3) and the IC 50 of ibuprofen for inhibition of PGE 2 production in gill tissue was calculated to be 0. 4 µM.

5000|$|About {{one-quarter of}} the crab's weight is meat. The flesh has what is {{considered}} to be a delicate flavour and slightly sweet taste. Dungeness crabs can typically be purchased either live or cooked. Live crabs are cooked simply by dropping them into boiling salt water, waiting for a boil to return, and then allowing it to continue for 15 minutes, after which time the crabs are removed and placed into cold water to cool, and then cleaned. Another method of preparing crab is called half backing. Half backing is done by flipping the crab upside down and chopping it in half (from head to [...] "tail"), after which the <b>guts</b> <b>and</b> <b>gills</b> can be scooped or hosed out. Many consider half backing to be superior to cooking the entire crab, because the meat is not contaminated by the flavor or toxins of the guts. Furthermore, half backed crabs boil faster or can be quickly steamed instead of boiled. Two common tools for removing crab meat from the shell are a crab cracker and a shrimp fork. Sometimes, a cleaver, mallet, or small hammer is used for cracking Dungeness crab, but the use of these devices is not recommended, as the integrity of the meat may be compromised due to the impact.|$|R

40|$|Xenoturbellida and Acoelomorpha are {{marine worms}} with {{contentious}} ancestry. Both were originally {{associated with the}} flatworms (Platyhelminthes), but molecular data have revised their phylogenetic positions, generally linking Xenoturbellida to the deuterostomes and positioning the Acoelomorpha as the most basally branching bilaterian group(s). Recent phylogenomic data suggested that Xenoturbellida and Acoelomorpha are sister taxa and together constitute an early branch of Bilateria. Here we assemble three independent data sets-mitochondrial genes, a phylogenomic data set of 38, 330 amino-acid positions and new microRNA (miRNA) complements-and show that the position of Acoelomorpha is strongly affected by a long-branch attraction (LBA) artefact. When we minimize LBA we find consistent support for a position of both acoelomorphs and Xenoturbella within the deuterostomes. The most likely phylogeny links Xenoturbella and Acoelomorpha in a clade we call Xenacoelomorpha. The Xenacoelomorpha is the sister group of the Ambulacraria (hemichordates and echinoderms). We show that analyses of miRNA complements {{have been affected by}} character loss in the acoels and that both groups possess one miRNA and the gene Rsb 66 otherwise specific to deuterostomes. In addition, Xenoturbella shares one miRNA with the ambulacrarians, and two with the acoels. This phylogeny makes sense of the shared characteristics of Xenoturbellida and Acoelomorpha, such as ciliary ultrastructure and diffuse nervous system, and implies the loss of various deuterostome characters in the Xenacoelomorpha including coelomic cavities, through <b>gut</b> <b>and</b> <b>gill</b> slits...|$|R

In this study the complete structure of the CRF 1 receptor was isolated and partially characterised for the first time in a vertebrate using the compact genome of the Japanese pufferfish, Fugu rubripes as a model. The Fugu CRF 1 receptor gene is composed of 14 exons is approximately 27 kb in length. A tissue distribution of this receptor in Fugu reveals that it is expressed mainly in liver, gonads, heart and brain, however, expression in the kidney, <b>gut</b> <b>and</b> <b>gills</b> was also detected.

50|$|Possible {{effects on}} animals are {{endocrine}} disruption, reproductive and immune dysfunction and cancer.A remarkable phenomenon {{that has been}} demonstrated in numerous animal studies is that repeated exposure to organophosphates causes the mammals to be less susceptible to the toxic effects of the AChE inhibitors, even though cholinesterase activities are not normal. This phenomenon {{is caused by the}} excess of agonists (ACh) within the synapse, ultimately leading to a down-regulation of cholinergic receptors. Consequently, a given concentration of ACh within the synapse causes fewer receptors to be available, which then causes a lower response.Studies have shown that the AChEs in fish brains are more prone to organophosphates than amphibian brains. This {{can be explained by the}} affinity for AzM and rate of phosphorylation of the enzymes. Frog brain AChE has for example a lower affinity for AzM and a slower rate of phosphorylation than fish brain AChE.The effects on amphibians are “reduced size, notochord bending, abnormal pigmentation, defective <b>gut</b> <b>and</b> <b>gills,</b> swimming in circles, body shortening, and impaired growth”.In sea urchins, specifically the Paracentrotus lividus, AzM modifies the cytoskeleton assembly at high concentrations and can alter the deposition of the skeleton of the larva at low concentrations.In mice, AzM causes weight loss, inhibits brain cholinesterase (ChE) and lowers the food consumption of the mice. A decrease of 45-50% of brain ChE is lethal in mice. Also in earthworms and rats, AzM decreases AChE activity.|$|R

40|$|CD 4 is a transmembrane {{glycoprotein}} fundamental for cell-mediated immunity. Its {{action as}} a T cell coreceptor increases the avidity of association between a T cell and an antigen-presenting cell by interacting with portions of the complex between MHC class II and TR molecules. In this paper we report the cDNA cloning, expression and structural analysis of a CD 4 homologue from sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax). The sea bass CD 4 cDNA consists of 2071 bp that translates in one reading frame to give the entire molecule containing 480 amino acids. The analysis of the sequence shows the presence of four putative Ig-like domains and that some fundamental structural features, like a disulphide bond in domain D 2 and the CXC signalling motif in the cytoplasmic tail, are conserved from sea bass to mammals. Real-time PCR analysis showed that very high levels of CD 4 mRNA transcripts are present in thymus, followed by <b>gut</b> <b>and</b> <b>gills.</b> In vitro stimulation of head kidney leukocytes with LPS and PHA-L gave an increase of CD 4 mRNA levels after 4 h and a decrease after 24 h. Homology modelling {{has been applied to}} create a 3 D model of sea bass CD 4 and to investigate its interaction with sea bass MHC-II. The analysis of the 3 D complex between sea bass CD 4 and sea bass MHC-II suggests that the absence of a disulfide bond in the CD 4 D 1 domain could make this molecule more flexible, inducing a different conformation and affecting the binding and the way of interaction between CD 4 and MHC-II.

40|$|Background: Immunoglobulins (Igs) are {{fundamental}} {{components of the}} adaptive immune system of vertebrates, with the IgT/IgZ isotype specific of Teleosts. In this paper we describe the identification of an IgT heavy chain from the European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax L.), its molecular characterization and tissue mRNA localization by in situ hybridization. Results: Sea bass IgT consists of 552 aa (Accession Number KM 410929) and it contains a putative 19 amino acids long signal peptide and one potential N-glycosylation site. The C-region consists of four CH domains; each contains the cysteine and tryptophan residues required for their correct folding. Based on the recent sequencing of sea bass genome, we have identified five different genomic contigs bearing exons unequivocally pertaining to IgT (CH 2, CH 3 and CH 4), but none corresponded to a complete IgH locus as IgT sequences {{were found in the}} highly fragmented assembled genomic regions which could not be assigned to any major scaffold. The 3 D structure of sea bass IgT has been modelled using the crystal structure of a mouse Ig gamma as a template, thus showing that the amino acid sequence is suitable for the expected topology referred to an immunoglobulin-like architecture. The basal expression of sea bass IgT and IgM in different organs has been analysed: <b>gut</b> <b>and</b> <b>gills,</b> important mucosal organs, showed high IgT transcripts levels and this was the first indication of the possible involvement of sea bass IgT in mucosal immune responses. Moreover, sea bass IgT expression increased in <b>gills</b> <b>and</b> spleen after infection with nodavirus, highlighting the importance of IgT in sea bass immune responses. In situ hybridization confirmed the presence of IgT transcripts in the <b>gut</b> <b>and</b> it revealed a differential expression along the intestinal tract, with a major expression in the posterior intestine, suggesting the hindgut as a site for the recruitment of IgT+ cells in this species.

MAb 11 binding occurred at hepatopancreatic epithelial R-cell brush border membranes, at plasma membranes of the antennal gland <b>and</b> <b>gill</b> podocytes, <b>and</b> at vacuolar membranes of hepatopancreatic B- <b>and</b> R-cells, <b>gill</b> nephrocytes <b>and</b> epithelial cells of the antennal gland labyrinth <b>and</b> <b>gill</b> lamellae, as assessed by FITC-labelled secondary antibodies. Control FITC-labelled antibodies raised in mice against vertebrate keratin proteins displayed only weak non-specific binding to the tissues and cells responding intensely to MAb 11, supporting the specific nature of MAb 11 binding to its cognate antigen. The broad histological and cytological distribution of MAb 11 binding to plasma membranes and vacuolar membranes from several lobster organ systems suggests that the physiological activities regulated by its antigen, possibly {{an element of the}} invertebrate electrogenic cation exchanger, may be diverse...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFish {{contamination}} {{has been}} extensively investigated along the Saudi coasts, but studies pertaining to bacterial pathogens are scarce. We conducted qualitative assessment and molecular identification of culture-dependent bacteria in 13 fish species from three coastal sites and a local fish market in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Bacterial counts of <b>gills,</b> skin, <b>gut</b> <b>and</b> muscle were examined on agar plates of Macconkey’s (Mac), Eosin Methylene Blue (EMB) and Thiosulfate Citrate Bile Salts (TCBS) culture media. Bacterial counts significantly differed between species, sources and feeding habits of examined fishes. Mugil cephalus exhibited higher counts on TCBS (all body parts), Mac (<b>gills,</b> muscle <b>and</b> <b>gut)</b> <b>and</b> EMB (<b>gills</b> <b>and</b> muscle). Fishes from Area I had higher bacterial loads, coinciding with those in seawater and sediment from the same site, indicating direct association between habitat conditions and the levels of bacterial contamination. By feeding habit, detritivorous fish harbored higher counts than herbivorous and carnivorous species. Bacterial counts of skin were higher in fish from market than field sites, and positively correlated with other body parts indicating the relation of surface bacterial load on {{the overall quality of}} fish. Rahnella aquatilis (Enterobacteriaceae) and Photobacterium damselae (Vibrionaceae) were among the dominant species from fish muscle based on 16 S rRNA sequencing. These species are known human pathogens capable of causing foodborne illness with severe antibiotic resistance. Opportunistic pathogens, e. g. Hafnia sp. (Enterobacteriaceae) and Pseudomonas stutzeri (Pseudomonadaceae) also occurred in fish muscle. The inclusion of bacterial contamination in future monitoring efforts is thus crucial...|$|R
40|$|Alvinocaris longirostris is {{a species}} of shrimp {{existing}} in the hydrothermal fields of Okinawa Trough. To date the structure and function of the microbial community associated with A. longirostris are essentially unknown. In this study, by employment of the techniques of high through-put sequencing and clone library construction and analysis, we compared {{for the first time}} the community structures and metabolic profiles of microbes associated with the <b>gill</b> <b>and</b> <b>gut</b> of A. longirostris in a hydrothermal field of Okinawa Trough. Fourteen phyla were detected in the <b>gill</b> <b>and</b> <b>gut</b> communities, of which 11 phyla were shared by both tissues. Proteobacteria made up a substantial proportion in both tissues, while Firmicutes was abundant only in <b>gut.</b> Although <b>gill</b> <b>and</b> <b>gut</b> communities were similar in bacterial diversities, the bacterial community structures in these two tissues were significantly different. Further, we discovered {{for the first time the}} existence in the <b>gill</b> <b>and</b> <b>gut</b> communities of A. longirostris the genes (cbbM and aclB) encoding the key enzymes of Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle and the reductive tricarboxylic acid (rTCA) cycle, and that both cbbM and aclB were significantly more abundant in gill than in gut. Taken together, these results provide the first evidence that at least two carbon fixation pathways are present in both the <b>gill</b> <b>and</b> the <b>gut</b> communities of A. longirostris, and that the communities in different tissues likely differ in autotrophic productivity...|$|R
40|$|Juvenile {{rainbow trout}} Oncorhynchus mykiss {{were exposed to}} diets with low (12. 6 nmol g(- 1)), normal (50. 4 nmol g(- 1)) or {{elevated}} (4437. 5 nmol g(- 1)) Cu concentrations in combination with either low (5. 8 nmol l(- 1)) or normal (48. 5 nmol l(- 1)) waterborne Cu levels over a 50 -day period, during which body mass increased up to fivefold. A nutritional requirement for Cu was demonstrated based on growth response and whole body and tissue Cu status. Simultaneous low Cu levels in both {{the water and the}} diet depressed growth by 31 % over 7 weeks. There were reductions in both specific growth rate (SGR, 1. 95 versus 2. 55 % day(- 1)) and food conversion efficiency (FCE, 53 - 59 % versus 75 - 80 %) over weeks 0 - 4, but these effects disappeared in weeks 4 - 7. Elevated concentrations of dietary Cu did not affect SGR or FCE. Low levels of dietary and waterborne Cu decreased, and high levels of dietary Cu increased, the Cu concentrations in whole body, liver, carcass, <b>gut</b> <b>and</b> <b>gills.</b> Copper levels in the liver strongly reflected the exposure conditions with a corresponding fivefold decrease and a 22 -fold increase in Cu concentration. Restricting available Cu caused an exponential decline in whole body Cu concentration from 0. 0175 to 0. 0069 micromol g(- 1) and increased the uptake of waterborne Cu (measured with (64) Cu) by the gills. Conversely, high levels of dietary Cu caused a linear increase in whole body Cu concentration to approximately 0. 170 micromol g(- 1) and depressed the uptake of waterborne Cu. Waterborne Cu uptake contributed the majority (60 %) of the body's Cu accumulation under Cu-deficient conditions while dietary Cu contributed the majority (99 %) at high dietary levels of Cu. True bioavailability of dietary Cu decreased with increasing levels of dietary Cu concentration, although the absolute amount retained increased. These findings demonstrate an important interaction between dietary and waterborne Cu uptake in fish and provide compelling evidence of a key role for the gill in Cu homeostasis.

We conducted qualitative assessment and molecular identification of culture dependent bacteria in 13 fish species collected from three fishing sites {{and a local}} fish market in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The bacterial counts of <b>gills,</b> skin, <b>gut</b> <b>and</b> muscle were examined on agar plates of Macconkey’s (Mac), Eosin methylene blue (EMB) and Thiosulfate Citrate Bile Salts (TCBS) culture media. Bacterial counts exhibited interspecific, locational and behavioral differences. Mugil cephalus exhibited higher counts on TCBS (all body-parts), Mac (<b>gills,</b> muscle <b>and</b> <b>gut)</b> <b>and</b> EMB (<b>gills</b> <b>and</b> muscle). Samples of Area I were with higher counts, concurrent to seawater and sediment samples, revealing the influence of residing environment on fish contamination. Among feeding habits, detritivorous fish harbored higher bacterial counts, while carnivorous group accounted for lesser counts. Counts were higher in skin of fish obtained from market compared to field samples, revealing market as {{a major source of}} contamination. Bacterial counts of skin were positively correlated with other body-parts indicating influence of surface bacterial biota in overall quality of fish. Hence, hygienic practices and proper storage facilities in the Jeddah fish market is recommended to prevent adverse effect of food-borne illness in consumers. Rahnella aquatilis (Enterobacteriaceae) and Photobacterium damselae (Vibrionaceae) were among the dominant species identified from fish muscle samples using Sanger sequencing of 16 S rRNA. This bacterial species are established human pathogens capable of causing foodborne illness with severe antibiotic resistance. Opportunistic pathogens such as Hafnia sp. (Enterobacteriaceae) and Pseudomonas stutzeri (Pseudomonadaceae) were also identified from fish muscle. These findings indicate bacterial contamination risk in commonly consumed fish of Jeddah region...|$|R
40|$|AbstractElasmobranchs are {{essentially}} marine, but ~ 15 % {{of the species}} occur in brackish or freshwater. The Brazilian marine coastal skate Zapteryx brevirostris, non-reported in nearby estuaries, was submitted to 35, 25, 15, and 5 psu, for 6 or 12 h (n= 6). Plasma was assayed for osmolality, urea, and ions (Na+, Cl−, K+, Mg 2 +). Muscle water content was determined, and the rectal gland, kidney <b>and</b> <b>gills</b> were <b>removed</b> for carbonic anhydrase (CA) and Na+,K+-ATPase (NKA) activities. The skate survived to all treatments. Plasma osmolality and urea levels decreased respectively by 27 % and 38 % after 12 h in 5 psu (with respect to levels when in seawater), but plasma Na+, Cl−, and Mg 2 + were well regulated. Plasma K+ showed some conformation after 12 h. Muscle hydration was maintained. Branchial CA and NKA {{did not respond to}} salinity. Rectal gland NKA decreased upon seawater dilution, while renal NKA increased. This skate was shown to be partially euryhaline. The analysis of plasma urea of elasmobranchs in brackish and freshwater versus salinity and time—allied to the widespread occurrence of some euryhalinity in the group—led us to revisit the hypothesis of a brackish water habitat for elasmobranch ancestors...|$|R
40|$|Background: We have {{previously}} sequenced more than 500 kb of the duplicated MHC class I regions in Atlantic salmon. In the IA region we identified the loci for the MHC class I gene Sasa-UBA {{in addition to}} a soluble MHC class I molecule, Sasa-ULA. A pseudolocus for Sasa-UCA was identified in the nonclassical IB region. Both regions contained genes for antigen presentation, as wells as orthologues to other genes residing in the human MHC region. Results: The genomic localisation of two MHC class I lineages (Z and S) has been resolved. 7 BACs were sequenced using a combination of standard Sanger and 454 sequencing. The new sequence data extended the IA region with 150 kb identifying the location of one Z-lineage locus, ZAA. The IB region was extended with 350 kb including three new Z-lineage loci, ZBA, ZCA and ZDA {{in addition to a}} UGA locus. An allelic version of the IB region contained a functional UDA locus in addition to the UCA pseudolocus. Additionally a BAC harbouring two MHC class I genes (UHA) was placed on linkage group 14, while a BAC containing the S-lineage locus SAA (previously known as UAA) was placed on LG 10. Gene expression studies showed limited expression range for all class I genes with exception of UBA being dominantly expressed in <b>gut,</b> spleen <b>and</b> <b>gills,</b> <b>and</b> ZAA with high expression in blood. Conclusion: Here we describe the genomic organization of MHC class I loci from the U-, Z-, and S-lineages i...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, an electrogenic 2 Na+/ 1 H+ antiporter {{has been}} {{identified}} {{in a variety of}} invertebrate epithelial brush-border membranes of <b>gut,</b> kidney <b>and</b> <b>gill</b> tissues. The antiporter differs significantly in its physiological properties from the electroneutral 1 Na+/ 1 H+ antiporter proposed for vertebrate cells. In all invertebrate cells examined, the antiporter displayed a 2 : 1 transport stoichiometry, responded to an induced transmembrane potential and exhibited a high binding affinity for the divalent cation Ca 2 +, which acted as a competitive inhibitor of Na+ transport. A monoclonal antibody specific for the crustacean electrogenic antiporter inhibited 2 Na+/ 1 H+ exchange, but was without effect on Na+-dependent D-glucose transport. Immunoreactivity was localized at hepatopancreatic brush-border and vacuolar membranes, antennal gland coelomosac podocytes <b>and</b> posterior <b>gill</b> epithelial cells – all locations where published reports described unique cation exchange kinetics. Significant fractions of Ca 2 + transport into invertebrate cells across brush-border membranes occurred by an electrogenic, amiloride-sensitive exchange process, probably by the 2 Na+/ 1 H+ antiporter, and this transport was markedly inhibited by exogenous zinc and cadmium. A recently identified electroneutral, amiloride-sensitive, hepatopancreatic epithelial basolateral Na+/H+ antiporter was uninfluenced by the brush-border monoclonal antibody, exhibited an apparent 1 : 1 transport stoichiometry and possessed a minimal divalent cation specificity. Calcium transport at this epithelial pole occurred by the combination of a Ca 2 +/Na+ antiporter, an ATP-dependent Ca 2 +-ATPase and a verapamil-sensitive calcium channel. These crustacean brush-border and basolateral transporters may play significant roles in calcification and heavy metal detoxification...|$|R
