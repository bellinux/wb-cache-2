Of note <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> locomotive No. 46221 had its tender (No.9816) withdrawn ahead of time in 1962; the locomotive was then paired to the Princess Royal tender No. 9359 until its withdrawal in May 1963.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{functions}} of the queen ant sounds are to recruit workers, smell nestmates, and facilitate oral exchanges of food and pheromones. Most importantly, however, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> distress noises made by the queen causes workers to raise their guard and bolster her protection.|$|E
5|$|Another concern <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> {{sugarcane}} {{fields are}} traditionally burned just before harvest to avoid {{harm to the}} workers, by removing the sharp leaves and killing snakes and other harmful animals, and also to fertilize the fields with ash. Mechanization will reduce pollution from burning fields and has higher productivity than people, and due to mechanization the number of temporary workers in the sugarcane plantations has already declined. By the 2008 harvest season, around 47% of the cane was collected with harvesting machines.|$|E

5|$|Of {{particular}} interest <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the Schechter Letter account of Oleg's death (namely, that he fled to and raided FRS, tentatively identified with Persia, and was slain there) bears remarkable parallels to {{the account of}} Arab historians such as Ibn Miskawayh, who described a similar Rus' attack on the Muslim state of Arran in the year 944/5.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the reasons}} the account's {{authenticity}} has been questioned <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> it claims St-Calais was knowledgeable in canon law. Offler doubted that canon law had penetrated to England to any great degree in 1088. The historian Mark Philpott, however, argues that St-Calais was knowledgeable in canon law, since he owned a copy of one of the basis of canon law, the False Decretals. The bishop's manuscript of the Decretals still survives.|$|E
5|$|The {{reason for}} {{estimating}} the pressure (in lieu of direct measurements) <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> {{most of these}} storms did not threaten land.

While Hurricane Ava never threatened land, it too was flown into by Hurricane Hunters to test equipment and conduct research.|$|E

5|$|These events {{led to a}} {{conflict}} with Ivan Sratsimir, who was in turn given the rule of Vidin, probably as a compensation. Another indirect piece of evidence for the feud <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Ivan Sratsimir's portrait {{not included in the}} Tetraevangelia of Ivan Alexander, where the whole family of the emperor was otherwise presented. In 1356 Ivan Sratsimir proclaimed himself emperor of Vidin. Together with his father and younger brother Ivan Asen V, Ivan Shishman presided over the church synods at Tarnovo in the late 1360s.|$|E
5|$|A {{possible}} {{reason for the}} willingness of the Franks to connect themselves with the Kentish court <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> a Frankish king, Chilperic I, is recorded as having conquered a people known as the Euthiones during the mid-sixth century. If, as seems likely from the name, these people were the continental remnants of the Jutish invaders of Kent, then {{it may be that the}} marriage was intended as a unifying political move, reconnecting different branches of the same people. Another perspective on the marriage may be gained by considering that it is likely that Æthelberht was not yet king at the time he and Bertha were wed: it may be that Frankish support for him, acquired via the marriage, was instrumental in gaining the throne for him.|$|E
5|$|According to a myth in many cultures, cats have {{multiple}} lives. In many countries, they {{are believed to}} have nine lives, but in Italy, Germany, Greece, Brazil and some Spanish-speaking regions, they are said to have seven lives, while in Turkish and Arabic traditions, the number of lives is six. The myth is attributed to the natural suppleness and swiftness cats exhibit to escape life-threatening situations. Also lending credence to this myth <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> falling cats often land on their feet, using an instinctive righting reflex to twist their bodies around. Nonetheless, cats can still be injured or killed by a high fall.|$|E
5000|$|In 2008, rumors arose {{about the}} band reuniting.

5|$|According to the thirteenth-century Historia Gruffud vab Kenan, {{the mother}} of Cynan's son was Ragnailt ingen Amlaíb, a {{paternal}} granddaughter of Sitriuc. Further revealed by this source <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> this woman's father, Amlaíb mac Sitriuc, built and commanded a Welsh fortress called Castell Avloed. Although it is unknown how long the Dubliners possessed the fortress, in 1036 another son of Sitriuc was slain in Wales by an apparent kinsman, an event which could be evidence of a struggle {{for control of the}} site. Echmarcach's aforesaid expulsion of Sitriuc from Dublin in the same year could in turn indicate that this exiled monarch sought refuge in Wales.|$|E
5|$|An {{additional}} intensity to {{the rivalry}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> both Maribor and Olimpija always had support on their matches from ultras groups, called Viole Maribor (supporting Maribor), and the Green Dragons, who support Olimpija. The two groups {{are the largest}} in the country, and it is not uncommon that the matches between the two clubs were sometimes interrupted by violent clashes between the two groups or with the police. On many occasions, before or after the matches, the fans of the two clubs would also meet up and fight on the streets. One of the worst incidents, in April 2010 after a match, resulted in a stabbing of a member of the Green Dragons who, with a group of friends, got into a fight with members of the Viole in Ljubljana's railway station. However, to date, there have not been any fatalities in the country related to football violence.|$|E
5|$|Certain areas did {{not report}} their income to the Exchequer, so they do not usually appear in the Pipe rolls, unless the lands were in the king's custody through a vacancy. These {{included}} the palatinates of Durham and Chester. The county of Cornwall also did not usually appear in the Pipe rolls, {{but it was not}} a palatinate. Another problem with using the Pipe rolls for historical study <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the chronological limits for the financial year varied from roll to roll. In theory, they only recorded revenues from the previous Easter to Michaelmas of that financial year. However, the Pipe rolls often record payments made past Michaelmas, often up until the date the roll was actually compiled. Also, a few debts were not audited annually, but would instead have a number of consecutive years be investigated in one sitting and thus several years of payments would be recorded in one Pipe roll.|$|E

5|$|Democracy, or {{the rule}} of the many over themselves. The rule of the masses is positive, in that it is less likely to lead to civil war than the alternatives. An {{ambivalent}} feature of democracy <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> representatives are forced to compromise their ideologies to stay in power, which can curb both positive and negative tendencies. On the negative side, democracies are not very good at dealing with subjects that demand expert authority or quick decisions. Moreover, a democracy is easily corruptible by politicians with agendas. Also, a democracy may easily slip into popular apathy which allows for corrupt politicians to go unchecked (Russell 1938:154–159).|$|E
5|$|Ecgbert {{was named}} to the see of York around 732 (other sources date the {{appointment}} to 734) by his cousin Ceolwulf, the king of Northumbria. Pope Gregory III gave him a pallium, the symbol of an archbishop's authority, in 735. After Eadberht became king, the brothers worked together, and were forbidden by the papacy to transfer church lands to secular control. They also worked together to deal with problems that had developed in the relationship between the church and royal government. An example of the brothers' cooperation <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> some of Eadberht's coins feature Ecbert's image on the opposite face.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{the third}} major factor behind the {{resolution}} of the financial crisis was the decision by the government of Iceland to apply for membership in the EU in July 2009. While views on the feasibility of EU membership are quite mixed in Iceland, this action has served to enhance the credibility of the country on international financial markets. One sign {{of the success of the}} above efforts <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the Icelandic government was successfully able to raise $1 billion with a bond issue on 9 June 2011. This development indicates that international investors have given the government and the new banking system, with two of the three biggest banks now in foreign hands, a clean bill of health. The first two major measures were implemented by the government of Geir H. Haarde but also carried out by the government of Johanna Sigurdardottir, which then took the step to apply for EU membership.|$|E

5|$|The major Ordovician–Silurian {{extinction}} events 450 {{million years}} ago may {{have been caused by}} a GRB. The late Ordovician species of trilobites that spent portions of their lives in the plankton layer near the ocean surface were much harder hit than deep-water dwellers, which tended to remain within quite restricted areas. This is in contrast to the usual pattern of extinction events, wherein species with more widely spread populations typically fare better. A possible explanation is that trilobites remaining in deep water would be more shielded from the increased UV radiation associated with a GRB. Also supportive of this hypothesis <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> during the late Ordovician, burrowing bivalve species were less likely to go extinct than bivalves that lived on the surface.|$|E
5|$|This {{disparity}} between the sizes of the megaliths is unparalleled among the other surviving stone circles in the Dorset area, {{and may have been}} a deliberate choice by the circle's builders, perhaps reflecting sexual symbolism. There are a number of similar circles in south-western Scotland, for example the Loupin' Stones, Ninestane Rigg, and Burgh Hill, all of which share the architectural feature of having two taller stones on their perimeters. Potentially supporting this link between Dorset and south-western Scotland <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the Grey Mare and her Colts—a chambered long barrow located two and a half miles south-west of the Nine Stones—displays architectural similarities with the Clyde-Solway tradition of chambered long barrows.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately, Palmer endorses the no-contact {{version of}} the LFI. She defends the {{distinction}} between doing and allowing harm, and then defends the idea that humans have different positive obligations towards domestic animals and wild animals. At the centre of Palmer's approach <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> humans are causally responsible for the hardship faced by some animals, but not the hardship faced by others. She then deploys this philosophy {{in a number of}} imagined cases in which humans have varying relations to particular animals in need. She closes the book by considering possible objections, including the idea that her approach would not require someone to save a drowning child at little cost to themselves.|$|E
