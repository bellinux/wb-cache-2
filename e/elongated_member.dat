40|$|The Karin {{family is}} a very young {{asteroid}} family created by an asteroid breakup 5. 8 Myr ago. Since {{the members of this}} family probably have not experienced significant orbital or collisional evolution yet, it is possible that they still preserve properties of the original family-forming event in terms of their spin state. As we carried out a series of photometric observations of the Karin family asteroids, here we report an analysis result of lightcurves including the rotation period of eleven members. The mean rotation rate of the Karin family members turned out to be much lower than those of NEAs or smaller MBAs (diameter D 130 km). We investigated a correlation between the peak-to-peak variation magnitude reduced to zero solar phase angle and the rotation period of the eleven Karin family asteroids, and found a possible trend that <b>elongated</b> <b>members</b> have lower spin rate, and less <b>elongated</b> <b>members</b> have higher spin rate.

40|$|A {{statistical}} analysis of brightness variability of asteroids reveals how their shapes evolve from elongated to rough spheroidal forms, presumably driven by impact-related phenomena. Based on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Moving Object Catalog, we determined the shape distribution of 11, 735 asteroids, with special emphasis on eight prominent asteroid families. In young families, asteroids have {{a wide range of}} shape elongations, implying fragmentation-formation. In older families we see an increasing number of rough spheroids, in agreement with the predictions of an impact-driven evolution. Old families also contain a group of moderately <b>elongated</b> <b>members,</b> which we suggest correspond to higher-density, more impact-resistant cores of former fragmented asteroids that have undergone slow shape erosion. A few percent of asteroids have very elongated shapes, and can either be young fragments or tidally reshaped bodies.

40|$|The newly resurgent {{field of}} {{evolutionary}} developmental biology integrates {{the study of}} evolutionarily important anatomical changes and developmental biology to describe the genetic and developmental changes {{that have led to}} anatomical changes. In this dissertation I describe candidate developmental mechanisms in the context of axial elongation and pectoral fin musculature evolution in fishes. Both axial elongation and increase in pectoral fin muscle subdivisions have important ecological correlates. Elongate fishes tend to be found in highly structured environments and fishes with an increased number of fin muscles tend to use fin-based locomotion to swim. Both of these morphologies have evolved multiple times within the ray-finned fish radiation. ^ In Chapter 1 I focus on a specific predator avoidance behavior that is only seen in elongate fishes. Deeper-bodied fish tend to perform a unilateral bend of the body and swim away whereas elongate fish, when startled, bend bilaterally and hide. Although all elongate fishes perform head retraction, their specific anatomy indicates multiple explanations for how elongation occurs. In Chapter 2, I describe changes in the vertebral column in lineages of actinopterygian fishes that have <b>elongate</b> <b>members.</b> Elongation occurs through three different mechanisms: addition of abdominal vertebrae, addition of caudal vertebrae, and lengthening of all the vertebral cents. This study suggests that the number of abdominal vertebrae, number of caudal vertebrae, and length of the vertebral cents are controlled by separate developmental modules. ^ Fin-based locomotion has evolved multiple times independently within actinopterygian fishes and is correlated with a modification of the pectoral fin musculature. In order to increase the understanding of fin muscle development, in Chapter 3 I describe the wildtype anatomy and embryology of the pectoral fin musculature in the zebrafish, Danio rerio. Zebrafish have six muscles in the pectoral fin. Early in development, the fin musculature consists of two muscle masses, one {{on each side of the}} fin. The arrector ventralis is the first muscle to individuate from the initial abductor muscle mass, and the adult musculature is present by 3 weeks postfertilization. This study provides a basic understanding of the embryology of the fin muscles and will provide a baseline for examining mutant fin muscle morphologies in zebrafish and diverse fin muscle morphologies in other species. ...|$|R
