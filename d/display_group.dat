The state annually sells excess horses from all three herds, and individual breeders also send horses to the sale.The Livestock Conservancy considers the breed to be at [...] "critical" [...] status, as part of the Colonial Spanish Horse family, meaning that the estimated global population of the breed is fewer than 2,000 and there are fewer than 200 registrations annually in the United States. The Equus Survival Trust also considers the population to be [...] "critical," [...] meaning that there are between 100 and 300 active adult breeding mares in existence today. However, breed numbers are slowly on the rise.|$|E

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} determine whether grouping of icons on complex graphic displays reduces information processing loads, {{as measured by the}} Subjective Workload Assessment Technique and emor rates. In Experiment 1, between 2 and 25 symbols were presented on a computer display. Participants were asked to chunk symbols under class labels and store these labels in short-term memory. Two different display formatting variables were tested spatial proximity grouping of icons was manipulated across three levels, while temporal grouping was manipulated across two levels. Results suggest that <b>display</b> <b>grouping</b> helps operators organize, encode, and store information into task relevant chunks and, in turn, reduces subjective workload and error rates. Experiment 2 was similar to Experiment 1, except that participants were required to remember individual icon names (i. e., participants were asked to remember as many as 25 item names). Results suggest that for chunk formation, storage, and parsing tasks, <b>display</b> <b>grouping</b> may reduce subjective workload, but not error rates...|$|R

40|$|We study {{experimentally}} {{the effect}} on individual behavior of group identity and group payoffs in a near-minimal setting, by testing {{the hypothesis that the}} <b>display</b> of <b>group</b> payoffs, when interacting with group identity, affects individual behavior even when group identity alone does not. Our novel design incorporates a <b>display</b> of <b>group</b> payoffs, which has no effect on agents' earnings, but provides information on other players' behavior. We also choose payments in the Dictator and Trust game to ensure that payoffs in the two games are comparable. Data analysis shows that group identity alone does not produce significant behavioral differences. Instead, the <b>display</b> of <b>group</b> payoffs induces in-group cooperation and favoritism, and out-group discrimination. This effect operates in different ways in the two games, reflecting the difference in the information provided by the <b>display</b> of <b>group</b> payoffs. We conclude that determinants of individual behavior in group settings are complex, and may also involve cognitive channels, such as focal coordination, psychological competition, team reasoning or group-based information saliency.
