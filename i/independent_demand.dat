40|$|We {{consider}} a multi-product risk-averse newsvendor under the law-invariant coherent measures of risk. We first establish several fundamental {{properties of the}} model regarding the convexity of the problem, the symmetry of the solution {{and the impact of}} risk aversion. Specifically, we show that for identical products with <b>independent</b> <b>demands,</b> increased risk aversion leads to decreased orders. For a large but finite number of heterogenous products with <b>independent</b> <b>demands,</b> we derive closed-form approximations for the optimal order quantities. The approximations are as simple to compute as the classical risk-neutral solutions. We also show that the risk-neutral solution is asymptotically optimal as the number of products tends to be infinity, and thus risk aversion has no impact in the limit. For a risk-averse newsvendor with dependent demands, we show that positively (negatively) dependent demands lead to a lower (higher) optimal order quantities than <b>independent</b> <b>demands.</b> Using a numerical study, we examine the convergence rates of the approximations and develop additional insights on the interplay between dependent demands and risk aversion...|$|R

40|$|Contemporary {{business}} environment {{is characterized by}} a high level of dynamics development and by competitive advantage. There is an increasing demand on both living environment protection and effective management of supply chains of particular industries. Supply chains have been becoming more complex and bulkier in the light of streaming material flows. One of the bases of a long-term socio-economic development of society in current global {{business environment}} is effective planning, management and control of bulky material flows of supply chains. Company’s management systems and also manufacturing management systems should be based on a forecasting subsystem of an <b>independent</b> <b>demand</b> or consumption. An accurate demand forecast enables adequate production of final products, parts, etc., although there is no overproduction or shortage. In final consequence the manufacturing systems based on progressive forecasting subsystems represent one of the main parts of supply chains in context of living environment protection and long-term sustainable development—thus the production or material flows are adequate within particular regional or global supply chains.

40|$|Unique value-maximizing {{programs}} of irreversible capacity investment and capacity utilization are described and shown to exist under general conditions for monopolist exhibiting capital adjustment costs and serving random consumer {{demand for a}} nondurable good over an infinite horizon. Stationary properties of these programs are then fully characterized under the assumption of serially <b>independent</b> <b>demand</b> disturbances. Optimal monopoly behavior in this case includes acquisition of a constant and positive level of capacity, {{the maintenance of a}} positive expected value of excess capacity in each period, and an asymmetrical response of price to unanticipated fluctuations in consumer demand. Under a general form of Markovian demand, the effect of uncertainty on irreversible capacity investment is also described in terms of the discounted flow of expected revenue accruing to the marginal unit of existing capacity and the option value of deferring the acquisition of additional capital. The option value of deferring such acquisition, created by the irreversibility of capacity investment, is characterized directly in terms of the value function of the firm, and is then shown to be zero in a stationary equilibrium with serially <b>independent</b> <b>demand</b> disturbances. The response of investment to increase demand uncertainty depends, as a result, directly on the properties of the marginal revenue product of capital. A non-negative response of optimal capacity to increased uncertainty in market demand is demonstrated for a general class of aggregate consumer preferences. Industrial capacity...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} model of {{distribution}} as a natural consequence of deterministic concurrency; a purely declarative form of concurrency that preserves referential transparency. This extends the demand driven model used as the operational basis of functional languages, into one with multiple <b>independent</b> <b>demands</b> without the need to allow non-determinism to appear at the user level. The abstract model of this distributed system uses a uniform access memory model {{in order to provide}} a global memory view. This, combined with explicit thread based concurrency and explicit representation of demand enables the trustable distribution of reactive systems across different systems. Since referential transparency is preserved, any pattern of distribution has no effect on the semantics of the functional program.
