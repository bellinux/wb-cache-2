5|$|Louis {{was born}} as Ludwig Alexander von Battenberg in Graz, Styria, {{the eldest son}} of Prince Alexander of Hesse and by Rhine by his morganatic {{marriage}} to Countess Julia von Hauke. Because of his morganatic parentage, Louis was denied his father's rank in the Grand Duchy of Hesse; and, from birth, his style of Illustrious Highness and title of Count of Battenberg instead derived from the rank given to his mother {{at the time of}} her marriage. On 26 December 1858, he automatically became <b>His</b> <b>Serene</b> <b>Highness</b> Prince Louis of Battenberg when his mother was elevated to Princess of Battenberg with the style of Serene Highness, by decree of her husband's brother, Louis III, Grand Duke of Hesse.|$|E

When Henry's mother was raised to Princess von Battenberg and given the higher style of Her Serene Highness by Alexander's older brother, Louis III, Grand Duke of Hesse, Henry and his siblings shared in their mother's new rank.
