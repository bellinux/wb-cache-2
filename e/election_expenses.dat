5|$|In February 2012 the Standards in Public Office Commission {{published}} the candidates' returns for campaign donations and <b>election</b> <b>expenses.</b> Candidates who receive more than 25% of a quota (i.e. 12.5% {{of the total}} votes; 221,471 votes) at any stage {{are entitled to a}} refund of <b>election</b> <b>expenses</b> to a maximum of €200,000. Three candidates received the maximum refund allowed; the other four had too few votes and received no refund. Only donations above €638 need be reported, making the reported totals less meaningful.

5|$|During the {{election}} period, a candidate is {{not permitted to}} spend more than $600,000 or 30 cents for each person on the electoral register, whichever is the greater amount. For the 2017 election, {{based on the number of}} electors as at 28 August 2017, the <b>election</b> <b>expenses</b> limit was $754,982.40. It amounts to an illegal practice to pay to transport voters to or from the poll; or to pay a voter for the use of premises to display a notice, unless the voter is an advertising agent or the transaction is carried out in the ordinary course of business. It is also an illegal practice for a person to borrow or lend, hire or rent out, or use any motor vehicle to convey voters other than himself and his family members to or from the poll. Committing an illegal practice is a criminal offence, the penalty for which is a fine of up to $2,000 and disqualification for three years from being a voter or a candidate for Parliament or the office of President.|$|E
5|$|The {{election}} {{judge is}} empowered to exempt {{from being an}} illegal practice any particular act or omission by a candidate, his or her election agents or any other agent or person in paying a sum, incurring an expense or entering into a contract if {{it was done in}} good faith and was due to inadvertence, accidental miscalculation or the like. Similarly, the judge may make an order allowing an authorized excuse for a failure to file a proper return or declaration relating to <b>election</b> <b>expenses</b> if the candidate or his or her principal election agent shows that he or she acted in good faith {{and that there is a}} reasonable explanation for the shortcoming such as inadvertence or illness, or the absence, death, illness or misconduct of some other agent, clerk or officer. In particular, the judge may relieve a candidate from the consequences of an act or omission by his or her principal election agent if he or she did not sanction or connive in it and took all reasonable means to prevent it.|$|E

25|$|Adams' {{share of}} the vote, at 37%, was short of a {{majority}} and he achieved victory only due to Fitt and the SDLP candidate splitting the non-Sinn Féin vote. In 1987 Adams narrowly held his seat, but lost it in the 1992 general election amidst a strong tactical voting campaign in favour of Joe Hendron of the Social Democratic and Labour Party by unionists in the Shankill Road area of the constituency. After the election a constituent, Maura McCrory, lodged an election petition challenging the result. The election court reported Hendron personally guilty of the illegal practice of failing to deliver a declaration verifying the return of his <b>election</b> <b>expenses,</b> and guilty through his election agent of failing to deliver a verified return of <b>election</b> <b>expenses</b> within 35 days, exceeding the maximum spending by £782.02, and failing to pay all the expenses within 28 days. Hendron's agent was also reported personally guilty of distributing election material without {{the name and address}} of the printer and publisher. The Judges granted both Hendron and his agent relief from their findings, {{on the grounds that the}} law had been broken through inadvertence; they therefore certified that Hendron had been duly elected.|$|E
25|$|By {{constitutional}} requirement, {{elections to}} the Lok Sabha (lower {{house of the}} parliament of India) must be held every five years, or whenever Parliament is dissolved by the President of India. The previous election to the 14th Lok Sabha was conducted in May 2004 and its term would have naturally expired on 1 June 2009. Elections are organised by the Election Commission of India (ECI) and are normally held in multiple phases to better handle the large electoral base and its security concerns. The 2009 elections were held in five phases. In February 2009, Rs.11.20billion ($200.5million) was budgeted for <b>election</b> <b>expenses</b> by the Indian Parliament.|$|E

25|$|Then Prime Minister Francesco Crispi and his Treasury Minister Giovanni Giolitti {{knew of the}} 1889 {{government}} inspection report, but {{feared that}} exposure might undermine public confidence and suppressed the report. In addition, they also wanted to avoid it becoming known that the Banca Romana, like other banks, had extended substantial loans to politicians (including themselves), often without interest. This was a common way for politicians to finance <b>election</b> <b>expenses</b> in return for favours. Over {{the next three years}} there was much talk of the need for a single note-issuing bank and for a reduction in the note circulation. But neither Crispi nor his successors, Antonio Di Rudinì and Luigi Luzzatti, had the courage to cope with the revelations and the political turmoil which any serious effort at banking reform was bound to trigger.|$|E
25|$|The expert {{commission}} report, {{published on}} January 18, 1893, confirmed the serious {{state of affairs}} in the Banca Romana: a deficiency of cash, cooked accounts, a note circulation of 135 million lire instead of the 75 million lire permitted by law, a great quantity of bad debts due to speculation in building, and 40 million lire in a duplicated series of notes that had been printed in Britain but not issued owing to the honesty of minor officials of the bank. Politicians had received money to finance their <b>election</b> <b>expenses</b> and to run or bribe newspapers. The next day, Tanlongo, the bank's director Cesare Lazzaroni, and several subordinates were arrested, but they were acquitted by the Court on July 15, 1894. Tanlongo accused Giolitti of receiving money through the Director General of the Treasury Carlo Cantoni, Agriculture Minister Pietro Lacava, and Grimaldi.|$|E

50|$|The {{election}} was {{widely regarded as}} a key contest between UKIP and the Conservative Party.

500|$|While these {{arrangements}} proceeded, Thorpe wrote to Sir Jack Hayward, the Bahamas-based millionaire businessman, {{who had given}} generously to the Liberal Party in the past. In {{the wake of the}} Liberals' February 1974 election successes, Thorpe asked for £50,000 to replenish the party's funds. He further requested that £10,000 of this sum be paid, not into the party's regular accounts but to Nadir Dinshaw, an acquaintance of Thorpe's who was resident in the Channel Islands. Thorpe explained that this subterfuge was necessary to deal with a special category of unspecific <b>election</b> <b>expenses.</b> Hayward trusted Thorpe, and sent the £10,000 to Dinshaw who, instructed by Thorpe, passed the money to Holmes. After the October 1974 election Thorpe again requested funds from Hayward, and again asked that £10,000 be sent via the Dinshaw route. Hayward obliged, though this time with more reluctance and after some delay. No accounting of this £20,000 was ever provided; Holmes, Le Mesurier and Deakin all said that it was used to finance a [...] "conspiracy to frighten", although they disagreed as to how much was spent. Thorpe later changed the story he had given Hayward about special categories of <b>election</b> <b>expenses,</b> and said he had deposited the sum with accountants [...] "as an iron reserve against any shortage of funds at any subsequent election." [...] He denied that he had authorised any payment to Newton or to anyone else connected with the case.|$|E
500|$|In {{the months}} {{following}} the election the danger represented by Norman Scott (see below) continued to preoccupy Thorpe who, according to David Holmes, felt [...] "he would never be safe with that man around". From late 1974 Holmes {{took the lead in}} furthering plans to silence Scott; through various intermediaries he found Andrew Newton, an airline pilot, who said he would dispose of Scott for a fee of between £5,000 and £10,000. Meanwhile, Thorpe procured £20,000 from Sir Jack Hayward, the Bahamas-based millionaire businessman who had previously donated to the Liberal Party, stating that this was to cover <b>election</b> <b>expenses</b> incurred during 1974. Thorpe arranged for these funds to be secretly channelled to Holmes rather than into the party's coffers. He later denied that this money had been used to pay Newton, or anyone else, as part of a conspiracy.|$|E
