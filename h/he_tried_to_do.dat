As <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, the wind fell away, leaving Temeraire becalmed and caught in a current which caused her to drift towards land. She came under fire from a shore battery on Pointe des Medes, which wounded several of her crew. Her boats were quickly manned, and together with boats sent from the squadron, Temeraire was towed {{out of range of}} the French guns. She then sailed to Menorca and underwent repairs. During this period an epidemic of yellow fever broke out, infecting nearly the entire crew and killing around a hundred crewmen. Pellew ordered her back to Britain, and health gradually improved as she sailed through the Atlantic.|$|E
25|$|A common {{aspect of}} the {{initiation}} was a trick played on the postulant; after they {{had been made to}} swear that they would never reveal the hidden word that was the alleged source of the group's power, they would later be commanded to write it down. If <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, thereby breaking his oath, he would be flogged across his back or knuckles.|$|E
25|$|In 1885, {{after the}} death of general Justo Rufino Barrios on 2 April in Chalchuapa, the Nicaraguan colonel from the Guatemalan Army Rigoberto Cabezas started El Pueblo newspaper, where <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> healthy {{opposition}} to interim president general Manuel Lisandro Barillas; in this newspaper Spínola started his journalism career. In his first issue, Cabezas point out that opposition is the stand stone for a republican government and that, provided his newspaper reach its tenth issue, Barillas would have demonstrated he was worthy of having the Constitution modified to allow him run as president, even though he was the interim. Cabeza was expelled from Guatemala after only three issues of El Pueblo, and Barillas modified the Constitution and became president for the 1886–1892 term.|$|E

25|$|Ralea's {{energies}} {{were also}} drawn into administrative disputes and professional rivalries. Alongside Brătianu, he fought to obtain Oțetea a permanent {{seat at the}} University of Iași, {{at the expense of}} PNȚ colleague Ioan Hudiță. <b>He</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the same for Rosetti, but was met with the stiff opposition of linguist Giorge Pascu. Hudiță was particularly vexed by these maneuvers, and, in 1934, asked for a formal inquiry by Parliament, and even for a formal review of Ralea's own 1926 appointment. More privately, Hudiță also claimed that Ralea was having affairs with his female students, and even with younger girls who presented to Ralea for their baccalaureate examination. Such criticism did not dissuade Ralea. In 1937, he also managed to obtain an Iași University chair for Călinescu, in controversial circumstances.|$|E

She came under fire from a shore battery on Pointe des Medes, which wounded several of her crew. The most serious casualty was her master, Robert Duncan, who had one of his legs shot off as he stood talking to Spear. Temeraires boats were quickly manned, and together with boats sent from the squadron, she was towed {{out of range of}} the French guns. She then sailed to Menorca and underwent repairs. During this period an epidemic of yellow fever broke out, infecting nearly the entire crew and killing around a hundred crewmen. Spear was one of those badly affected, and the {{commander in chief of the}} Mediterranean Fleet, Sir Edward Pellew, ordered him back to Britain with his ship. Health gradually improved as she sailed through the Atlantic. Spear was to have commanded Temeraires replacement in the Mediterranean, the 100-gun , but his ill health prevented this.|$|E
500|$|... is a manga series {{written and}} drawn by Nobuhiro Watsuki. It follows Kazuki Muto, who becomes an alchemical warrior {{in the battle}} against alchemical monsters known as homunculi. Watsuki envisioned the manga as his last shōnen manga, and then <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{as much as he could}} with that genre. It was {{serialized}} in Shueisha's magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump from June 2003 to April 2005. The individual chapters were republished by Shueisha in ten tankōbon volumes. The series has been licensed by Viz Media for North American release.|$|E

500|$|Nobuhiro Watsuki {{started writing}} Buso Renkin {{thinking}} {{it would be}} his last shōnen manga; <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> [...] "everything [...] ever wanted" [...] with that genre. He unexpectedly experienced problems drawing the manga's fight scenes and said he [...] "struggled with the comedic elements". Watsuki drew references from several sources in Buso Renkin; from his past works Rurouni Kenshin and Gun Blaze West to American comics, and from films to other anime and manga. Despite dealing with alchemy, Watsuki initially avoided mentioning the philosopher's stone because he thought he could be accused of plagiarizing another series. He could not omit mentioning it, but he said that it is [...] "general knowledge". During the series' publication, Watsuki had four severe colds; the fourth cold made him so weak that he could not finish the chapter he was due to send to Weekly Shōnen Jump.|$|E
500|$|Though he {{had drifted}} through his life thus far, Milk found his vocation, {{according}} to journalist Frances FitzGerald, who {{called him a}} [...] "born politician". At first, his inexperience showed. <b>He</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> without money, support, or staff, and instead relied on his message of sound financial management, promoting individuals over large corporations and government. He supported the reorganization of supervisor elections from a citywide ballot to district ballots, which was intended to reduce the influence of money and give neighborhoods {{more control over their}} representatives in city government. He also ran on a culturally liberal platform, opposing government interference in private sexual matters and favoring the legalization of marijuana. Milk's fiery, flamboyant speeches and savvy media skills earned him a significant amount of press during the 1973 election. He earned 16,900votes—sweeping the Castro District and other liberal neighborhoods and coming in 10th place out of 32candidates. Had the elections been reorganized to allow districts to elect their own supervisors, he would have won.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Volcano" [...] {{episode was}} in {{production}} when South Park debuted on August 13, 1997. Comedy Central executives did {{not object to}} most of the content of the episode, but said the scene in which Kyle farted while talking to Stan should have been removed because nothing happened after the fart, and they said it was not funny. Parker and Stone, however, insisted it stay in the episode, and they said the lack of any reaction whatsoever to the fart was what made it funny. During close-ups of Cartman's face while telling the story of Scuzzlebutt around the campfire, the flames from the fire stop moving. Parker and Stone noticed the consistency error after the episode was filmed, but they did not have enough time to go back and fix it before the broadcast date, so it was left in. A cat featured in the background of one of the outdoor scenes was designed to look exactly like Parker's cat, Jake. The scene in which Ned catches fire was based on an experience Parker had during a Colorado camping trip where <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> an [...] "Indian Fire Trick", in which one pours gasoline onto a fire to create large flames. Although nobody caught fire, Parker said the trick misfired and he nearly burned down the forest. After finishing the episode, Parker and Stone realized [...] "Volcano" [...] was about two minutes shorter than the time length required for the episode. In order to add time to the episode, Parker and Stone added the scene with Ned singing the song [...] "Kumbaya" [...] around the fire, as well as the long freeze-frame on a shocked Chef and Mayor McDaniels reacting to the news of the volcano's imminent eruption.|$|E

2500|$|Writer-artist Will Eisner is {{sometimes}} criticized for his depiction of Ebony White, the young African American sidekick of Eisner's 1940s and 1950s character The Spirit. Eisner later admitted to consciously stereotyping the character, but said <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so with [...] "responsibility", {{and argued that}} [...] "at the time humor consisted in our society of bad English and physical difference in identity". The character developed beyond the stereotype as the series progressed, and Eisner also introduced black characters (such as the plain-speaking Detective Grey) who defied popular stereotypes.|$|E
2500|$|.....in came Freddie Trueman who {{appeared}} determined {{to knock the}} cover off the ball. He blasted some very quick runs, which included two straight sixes off the mortified Richie Benaud. Freddie can always {{be counted on to}} surprise you. After the towering first six, he appealed against the light! Even for fiery Freddie, that was cheek of the highest order. Richie and I both burst out laughing and, needless to say the appeal was not upheld. Test cricket can have its lighter moments. Freddie's response was to crash another giant six about 20 yards deeper, but unfortunately, <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it again and was caught by Benaud off Mackay at extra cover.|$|E

Jericho then assaulted Michaels with a low blow and sent Michaels through the [...] "Jeritron 6000" [...] television, damaging Michaels' eye, and turning heel {{for the first time}} since 2005.

For instance, the Russian literary academic [...] wrote about Parting from Narcissus, and indeed Goldstein's work as a whole:He was the first to describe that peculiar time in which we partly continue to live, but perhaps have already left behind. In any case, beginning with his first articles and his first book, Parting from Narcissus, which marked a huge cultural upheaval in the middle of the 1990s, he was the first to have the courage to say certain things, to push back certain borders and barriers. What <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> (and it's even worth asking how he managed to do it) was to find the language of the time.|$|E

Thanks to the will and direct initiative of President Boris Yeltsin a new constitution, one which declared human rights a supreme value, was adopted. It gave people the opportunity to freely express their thoughts, to freely choose power in Russia, to realise their creative and entrepreneurial plans. This Constitution permitted us to begin building a truly effective Federation. ... We knew him as a brave and a warm-hearted, spiritual person. He was an upstanding and courageous national leader.
