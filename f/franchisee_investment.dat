40|$|We study {{franchise}} {{arrangements that}} allow franchisees with exclusive territories to own their customers. This permits franchisees {{to benefit from}} positive externalities in the franchise network through interfranchise transfers based on the purchases by their customers at other franchises on the network. Using {{the structure of a}} single franchisor and many franchisees, we show that, in general, interfranchise transfers between franchisees and incentives for <b>franchisee</b> <b>investment</b> in the expansion of their customer base are critical both to the size and to the benefits derived from the franchise network. Specifically, we find that when individual franchisees make investments in marketing effort to increase their customer base, the franchisor's setting of the interfranchise transfer trades off the positive effects on network size with the negative effects of removing franchisee incentive for investment. This result {{is due to the fact}} that interfranchise transfers encourage adoption, but discourage full investment in marketing effort. As compared to first-best <b>franchisee</b> <b>investment,</b> use of the royalty and the inter-franchise transfer directly dissipates franchisee profits, and indirectly dissipates franchisee profits through less than universal adoption, thereby causing franchisees to underinvest. As compared to traditional franchise systems, however, use of the interfranchise transfer results in franchises making greater investments than they otherwise would. channels of distribution, pricing research...|$|E
40|$|Numerous {{studies of}} {{franchisee}} failure {{have been conducted}} with mixed results reported due to methodological differences and the definition of failure used. There has been an emphasis {{in the literature on}} estimating and comparing the failure rates for these organisations. This paper acknowledges that franchisee failure is a concern but concentrates on the causes of failure. To do so, a definition of ‘negative franchisee exits’ is developed to overcome deficiencies in previous definitions of failure. The research is carried out in two stages. Firstly, franchisors and their ex-franchisees are interviewed. Then, the insights gained from the qualitative research are used to develop a model for the second stage of the research. Findings from a survey of franchisors indicate that franchise system size, level of <b>franchisee</b> <b>investment</b> and degree of conflict are related to the incidence of negative franchisee exits. 9 page(s...|$|E
40|$|The {{periodical}} re-auction {{of a water}} monopoly concession {{causes the}} danger of underinvestment. If the life-time of specific assets such as water pipes exceeds the contract length and transferring the ownership of assets is difficult, the incumbent franchisee faces a hold-up problem. Using a simple auction model that considers {{the specifics of the}} piped water sector this paper shows that investment incentives may vary depending on the applied auction scheme. The model is designed as a two stage game, where the <b>franchisee</b> decides about <b>investment</b> on the first and competes with a potential market entrant on the second stage. Investment tends to be higher in sealed bid auctions than in an English auction, since the incumbent benefits from an information advantage. Additionally investment may vary in a first- and a second-price sealed bid auction depending on several factors such as costs or effectiveness of investment. The analysis is extended by a vertical separation. Water, Networks, Franchise Bidding, Investment...|$|R
40|$|We set out {{to explain}} both puzzles based on the {{importance}} of the brand name in franchising (Kaufmann and Lafontaine, 1994). The effort to develop and maintain the brand name changes over time and is difficult to verify (Hadfield, 1990), which has two implications. One is that agents who run franchise units need to be given appropriate incentives for the brand-name-maintenance effort. The other is that franchising contracts are incomplete. For incentive purposes, it is optimal to divide the agents into two groups. Those in the first group (managers of company owned units) receive a salary and focus on brand maintenance. Those in the second group (franchisees) receive a share of the revenue in their own unit and focus mainly on unit specific sales effort (Bai and Tao, 2000). However, the franchisees should also be subject to a minimum service standard that is crucial for brand name maintenance. The high-powered incentive for the franchisees to increase sales revenue implies that they have a strong tendency to divert effort from meeting the minimum standard. To discourage the franchisees from doing so, they should be subject to severe penalty when found violating the standard. We show that, to serve this purpose, it is optimal to have the <b>franchisees</b> make <b>investment</b> highly specific to their franchise companies. Specifically, the <b>investment</b> by the <b>franchisee</b> to buy physical assets (buildings, equipment, etc.) {{can be viewed as a}} performance bond for the minimum standard. If the franchisor controls the assets when the franchisee leaves the company, then the franchisor has an incentive to opportunistically accuse the franchisee of violating the standard and fire the franchisee, getting all the profits arising from the assets. If the franchisee controls the assets, such opportunistic behavior of the franchisor will not occur. Furthermore, if the assets are relationship specific so that their value is very low when detached from the brand name, then the franchisee will have strong incentive not to violate the minimum standard, fearing of being deprived the right to use the brand name in the event of violation. Overall, the plural forms of contractual and control right arrangements in franchising serve as a nexus of incentive devices for production involving brand-name-maintenance effort in an incomplete contract framework. postprintThe 2000 Taipei International Conference on Industrial Economics, Taipei, Taiwan, 15 - 17 June 2000...|$|R
40|$|Franchising {{involves}} {{a variety of}} contractual and ownership arrangements within a single company. In recent years, {{a great deal of}} effort has been made to understand this increasingly popular organization (Lafontaine, 1992, 1993, and Lafontaine and Slade, 1997). There are at least two stylized facts that have posed challenges to the existing theories of the firm. One is the co-existence of company-owned and franchised units, and the other is that franchisees make substantial amount of investment highly specific to their franchise companies. We set out to explain both puzzles based on the importance of the brand name in franchising (Kaufmann and Lafontaine, 1994).

40|$|Die Expansion von Franchise-Unternehmen wurde in den letzten Jahren sehr stark durch Multi-unit Franchising (d. h. ein Franchisenehmer hat mehrere Outlets) unterstützt. Ziel der vorliegenden Studie ist die Wahl zwischen Multi-unit Franchising und Single-unit Franchising (d. h. der Franchisenehmer hat nur einen Outlet) mit Hilfe von organisationsökonomischen und strategischen Ansätzen zu erklären. Die Dissertation ist in zwei Teilen aufgebaut: Der erste Teil der Arbeit besteht aus zwei Studien. Erstens wird ein Überblick über die {{relevante}} Literatur gegeben. Es wird aufgezeigt, dass die meisten Untersuchungen auf agency-theoretischen Ansätzen basieren. Einige Studien leiten auch Hypothesen vom ressourcen-orientierten Ansatz ab. Die Forschungslücke besteht darin, dass es keine umfassende theoretische Erklärung von Multi-unit Franchising gibt, die sowohl organisationsökonomische und strategische Ansätze integriert. Um diese Forschungslücke zu schließen, wurde ein integratives Modell basierend auf Transaktionskostentheorie, Agencytheorie, Property Rights-Theorie, Screeningtheorie sowie ressourcenorientierte und ‚Organzational Capabilities’- Ansätze entwickelt. Der zweite Teil der Arbeit besteht aus drei Studien, die Property Rights-, Transaktionskosten-, Agencykosten - und Organizational Capabilities-Hypothesen entwickeln und testen In der ersten Arbeit wird eine komparative Fallstudienanalyse durchgeführt. Die empirischen Befunde der beiden Franchiseunternehmen (Coffeeshop Company und Testa Rossa) sind mit den von Agencytheorie, Transaktionskostentheorie und ressourcenorientierten Theorie abgeleiteten Hypothesen weitgehend kompatibel. In der zweiten Studie werden Transaktionskosten- und Organizational Capabilities-Hypothesen mit Hilfe von Daten deutscher Franchise-Unternehmen getestet. Die Ergebnisse bestätigen die Transaktionskosten- und die Organizational Capabilities-Hypothesen. Die dritte Studie presentiert eine Property Rights-Erklärung von Multi-unit Franchising. Nach der Property Rights-Theorie hängt die Struktur der Eigentumsrechte von der Kontrahierbarkeit des systemspezifischen Know-how und der lokalen Marktknow-how ab. Die empirische Ergebnisse bestätigen den negativen Zusammenhang zwischen intangiblem Marktknow-how und der Tendenz zu Multi-unit Franchising. Ferner bestätigen die Ergebnisse, dass die finanziellen Ressourcen des Multi-unit-Franchisenehmers nur dann die Tendenz zu Multi-unit Franchising beeinflussen, wenn die Informationsasymmetrie zwischen Franchisenehmer und potentiellen Fremdkaptialgebern aufgrund des intangiblen lokalen Marktwissens sehr groß ist. Die vorliegende Arbeit liefert folgenden Beitrag zur Forschung: Erstens wird ein umfassender Überblick über die relevante Literatur zum Multi-unit Franchising in den letzten 30 Jahren gegeben. Es wird aufgezeigt, dass die Forschungslücke in der unzureichenden theoretischen Fundierung der bisherigen empirischen Befunde besteht. Ausgehend von diesem Defizit wird ein integratives Modell zur Erklärung von Multi-unit Franchising abgeleitet. Zweitens wird Multi-unit Franchising mit Hilfe von Hypothesen aus der Transaktionskostentheorie, ‚Organizational Capabilities’-Theorie und Property Rightstheorie zu erklären versucht. Die empirischen Befunde vom deutschen Franchisesektor bestätigen die Transaktionskosten-, ‚Organizational Capabilities’ und teilweise die Property Rigths-Hypothesen. is {{a popular}} organizational form {{and its role in}} national economies has been well recognized by the researchers. Many franchising researchers attribute the recent growth in franchising to the emergence of multi-unit franchising (an organizational arrangement where one franchisee owns two or more outlets in the same franchise system). The objective of this research is to explain franchisor’s choice between multi-unit franchising and single-unit franchising (traditional one-franchisee one-outlet format) using organizational economics and strategic management theories. This dissertation is divided into two main parts. The first part comprises of two studies that present a detailed literature review and develop an integrative model to explain franchisor’s use of MUF. The findings of the literature review suggest that the previous studies mainly use agency theoretical framework to explain this ownership strategy in franchising. Although some studies also apply resource-based view but the primary research deficit results from the lack of systematic application of these theories. As an attempt to address this research gap, I develop an integrative model based on transaction cost theory, agency theory, resource-based and organizational capabilities views, property rights theory, and screening theory. The second part of the dissertation presents three studies to empirically test some parts of the proposed integrative model. In the first study, I employ a comparative case analysis method to test the predictions concerning agency theory, resource-based and organizational capabilities views, and transaction cost theory. The findings suggest that franchisor’s multi-unit franchising strategy can be explained by <b>franchisee’s</b> transaction-specific <b>investments,</b> franchisor’s system-specific assets, and franchisor’s financial resources scarcity. The second study uses quantitative data from the German franchise sector to empirically test the hypotheses concerning organizational capabilities view and transaction cost theory. The findings support hypotheses proposing positive effects of brand name capital, knowledge transfer capabilities, and <b>franchisee’s</b> transaction-specific <b>investments</b> on the use of multi-unit franchising. The negative influence of environmental uncertainty on the franchisor’s multi-unit ownership strategy is also supported. The third empirical study develops a property rights explanation of the multi-unit ownership strategy of a franchise firm. According to the property rights theory, the structure of ownership rights depends on the contractibility of assets. Empirical results from the German franchise sector provide support of the hypotheses predicting negative effect of non-contractibility of local market assets on the use of multi-unit franchising. In addition, the positive impact of financial assets on the tendency toward multi-unit franchising increases with non-contractibility of local market assets. Compared to the agency theory, which focuses on (complete) incentive contracts that specify residual income rights between the franchisor and franchisee, property rights theory focuses on incomplete contracts that allocate ownership rights between the franchisor and network partners. Furthermore, compared to the transaction and resource-based theory, property rights theory examines the impact of contractibility of resources/assets on the ownership structure. Only non-contractible resources/assets determine the structure of ownership rights. This research contributes to the existing literature on multi-unit franchising by presenting an extensive literature review, developing an integrative model, and providing some new explanations for the franchisor’s use of multi-unit franchising. This research also bears practical implications for the franchising practitioners (franchisors and franchisees). The future research may be directed to find alternative theoretical explanations for the use of multi-unit franchising. In addition, it may also be interesting to integrate the performance of the franchise networks into the theoretical explanations behind the use of different ownership strategies within the franchising setting...|$|R
