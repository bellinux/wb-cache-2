In central Borneo, some traditional folk beliefs consider <b>it</b> <b>bad</b> luck {{to look in the}} face of an orangutan. Some folk tales involve orangutans mating with and kidnapping humans.

Stewie rejects the idea of bringing Snuggly Jeff back to life with a child's wish, calling <b>it</b> <b>bad</b> storytelling and comparing it to a plot hole in the film Contact.|$|E

25|$|From 4–15 January 1970, 8,115 Hmong were airlifted {{out from}} Xam Neua to resettle near Long Tieng. Meanwhile, the PAVN engaged several guerrilla {{positions}} simultaneously on the Plain of Jars. On 9 January, sappers of the 27th Dac Cong Battalion thrust at Phou Nok Kok from two directions while foul weather precluded tactical air strike {{support of the}} Royalists. Special Guerrilla Unit 1, (SGU 1), a battalion newly arrived from Military Region 4, initially held their ground despite their unfamiliarity with the position and its surrounding terrain. However, on 10 January, the sappers managed to scale the sheer northern face of the mountain, gaining the summit. With their advantage of height, the attacking sappers poured mortar and flamethrower fire upon the Royalists. Late on 12 January, GM 23 withdrew. On 15 January, 183 Royalist soldiers from BV 26 were landed on a ridge directly across Route 7 from Phou Nok Kok in an abortive effort to retake <b>it.</b> <b>Bad</b> flying weather prevented air support of their understrength counter, which petered out within a day.|$|E
25|$|A {{major part}} of the {{gameplay}} in The Suffering concerns Torque's morality. At numerous points during the game, the player will encounter situations where they have several choices as to how to proceed. These situations involve NPCs, and the choices are usually to help the person (good morality), kill them (bad morality), or ignore them (neutral morality). In many situations, when Torque first encounters an NPC, the player will hear the voice of Torque's dead wife urging him to help them, and almost immediately afterwards will hear the voice of a demon urging him to kill them. How Torque's actions affect his morality is usually indicated by the reaction of his wife, who will praise him if he commits a good act and chastise him if he does something evil. Often, when Torque saves an NPC, they fight alongside him for a time. However, not every choice presents the player with all three possibilities. For example, when Torque finds the controls to the electric chair, he can turn the chair on to torture an inmate strapped to <b>it</b> (<b>bad</b> morality), or simply ignore the controls (neutral morality). There is no good morality choice available here. Another example is when Torque finds a guard who has had his limbs removed and is slowly dying. He can kill the man to relieve him of his misery (good morality), or ignore him (neutral morality). Here, there is no bad morality choice. Over the course of the game, the decisions made concerning Torque's morality cumulate, and the player will get one of three endings based on Torque's final morality level. The player can get a rough idea of Torque's morality level by both Torque's own physical appearance (he will begin to look less and less human the more evil acts he commits) and by looking at a family photograph which he carries with him at all times; the cleaner the photo, the purer his morality. If the photo is dirty, crumpled and covered in blood, his morality is moving towards evil.|$|E

500|$|Gene Siskel {{described}} it as the [...] "finest contemporary war film I've seen, supplanting Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan from earlier this year, or even Oliver Stone's Platoon from 1986." [...] A more subdued Roger Ebert gave it three stars, saying that it felt confused and unfinished. He wrote, [...] "The movie's schizophrenia keeps it from greatness (this film has no firm {{idea of what it}} is about), but doesn't make <b>it</b> <b>bad.</b> It is, in fact, sort of fascinating... The battle scenes themselves are masterful, in creating a sense of the geography of a particular hill, the way it is defended by Japanese bunkers, {{the ways in which the}} American soldiers attempt to take it ... Actors like Sean Penn, John Cusack, Jim Caviezel and Ben Chaplin find the perfect tone for scenes of a few seconds or a minute, and then are dropped before a rhythm can be established".|$|E

Mike Finnigan performs the Hammond organ solo on [...] "A Sunday Kind of Love" [...] and throughout the album, filling the gap between blues and jazz music. Closing the album are Sammy Cahn and Saul Chaplin's [...] "If It's the Last Thing I Do", and Alice Cooper's [...] "Only Women Bleed". James had recorded [...] "Only Women Bleed" [...] previously.|$|E
500|$|Sukhdev Sandhu of The Daily Telegraph was {{generally}} negative about the film, stating, [...] "The Human Centipede has its moments, but they're largely obscured by umpteen {{holes in the}} plot {{as well as by}} reams of exposition" [...] and that it was [...] "an ultimately underwhelming affair that's neither sick or repellent enough to garner the cult status it so craves." [...] The New York Times review by Jeannette Catsouli noted that whether the film was [...] "a commentary on Nazi atrocities or a literal expression of filmmaking politics, the grotesque fusion at least silences the female leads, both of whose voices could strip paint." [...] Writing in the Chicago Sun Times, Roger Ebert did not assign the film a star rating (not to be confused with awarding it zero stars), stating, [...] "I am required to award stars to movies I review. This time, I refuse to do it. The star rating system is unsuited to this film. Is the movie good? Is <b>it</b> <b>bad?</b> Does it matter?

500|$|In {{his work}} on the Rosetta stone, Young {{proceeded}} mathematically without identifying the language of the text. For example, comparing the number of times a word appeared in the Greek text with the Egyptian text, he was able to point out which glyphs spelled the word [...] "king", but he was unable to read the word. Using Åkerblad's decipherment of the demotic letters p and t, he realized that there were phonetic elements in the writing of the name Ptolemy. He correctly read the signs for p, t,m, i, and s, but rejected several other signs as [...] "inessential" [...] and misread others, {{due to the lack of}} a systematic approach. Young called the Demotic script [...] "enchorial", and resented Champollion's term [...] "demotic" [...] considering <b>it</b> <b>bad</b> form that he had invented a new name for it instead of using Young's. In order not to be superseded by the young Champollion, Young corresponded with Sacy, now no longer Champollion's mentor but his rival, who advised Young not to share his work with Champollion and described Champollion as a charlatan. Consequently, for several years Young kept key texts from Champollion and shared little of his data and notes.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} of the album was mixed. PopMatters review concluded that, given proper arrangements and material, James delivered jazz standards [...] "with the same devastating power" [...] demonstrated on past blues performances. Staff wrote that James combined jazz and blues elements successfully, [...] " [...] the sense of loneliness and desperation in which James has always excelled in expressing". PopMatters review was positive overall, claiming James' rough voice made her appear to be [...] "in tune with the woeful nature" [...] of the songs, though it insisted that her cover of [...] "Only Women Bleed" [...] was a [...] "miscalculation of major proportions". Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine called James {{one of the best}} blues performers of the twentieth century and wrote in his review of the album that [...] "she still possesses an exceptionally strong voice, robust and filled with passion." [...] However, Erlewine also wrote that Heart of a Woman [...] "never has the emotional impact James intended it to have". Music critic Robert Christgau's review simply reads [...] "Torching cocktail cool" [...] and recommended the tracks [...] "My Old Flame", and [...] "I Only Have Eyes for You". The Advocate Andrew Velez felt that [...] "I Got <b>It</b> <b>Bad</b> (and That Ain't Good)" [...] was the album's best track. [...] "Steve Knopper of the Chicago Tribune thought the arrangements were [...] "tinkly" [...] and [...] "meandering", with James sounding as through [...] "she's learning a foreign language". Knopper considered [...] "Only Women Bleed" [...] to be the album's most soulful track.|$|E
500|$|Ebert {{emphasized}} that his star ratings had little meaning if not {{considered in the}} context of the review itself. Occasionally, Ebert's star rating may have seemed at odds with his written opinion. Ebert acknowledged one such case in his review of Basic Instinct 2, stating, [...] "I cannot recommend the movie, but... why the hell can't I? Just because it's godawful? What kind of reason is that for staying away from a movie? Godawful and boring, that would be a reason". In August 2004 Stephen King, in a column, criticized what he saw as a growing trend of leniency towards films from critics, including Ebert. His main criticism was that films, citing Spider-Man 2 as an example, were constantly given four star ratings that they did not deserve. In his review of The Manson Family, Ebert gave the film three stars for achieving what it set out to do, but admitted that did not count as a recommendation per se. He similarly gave the Adam Sandler-starring remake of The Longest Yard a positive rating of three stars, but in his review, which he wrote soon after attending the Cannes Film Festival, he recommended readers not to see the film because they had access to more satisfying cinematic experiences. He declined to give a star rating to The Human Centipede, arguing that the rating system was [...] "unsuited" [...] to such a film: [...] "Is the movie good? Is <b>it</b> <b>bad?</b> Does it matter? It is what it is and occupies a world where the stars don't shine." ...|$|E

500|$|In June 2009, co-writer and {{producer}} of the song, Xavier [...] "Zaytoven" [...] Dotson revealed to MTV News that he worked with Usher on a song. Zaytoven divulged a few details, saying, [...] "I can't wait for {{something like that to}} come out, so people can see I do more than just hip-hop. I can do R, pop, gospel ... whatever genre of music that's out. If you listen to , you can't say, 'Zaytoven did that.'" [...] According to Zaytoven in another interview with MTV News, the track was originally called [...] "Filing Papers". Zaytoven said, [...] "This is before there were any reports about Usher's marriage in the news. So I was thinking to myself, 'Is he trying to say something?' I don't know what Usher is going through, but Sean Garrett made a song about filling out papers, divorce papers. The beat, it's got a bounce to it. It's outta here." [...] Sean Garrett later clarified, stating that the song was not necessarily called [...] "Filing Papers", Garret commented, [...] "Let's say I wrote a record for Usher three or four months ago where I really didn't have any idea of what he was going through personally. I work really hard at creating records I feel that's gonna fit like a glove to an artist. Me and Usher have a close relationship; I tend to sort of assist certain artists in giving them a direction, where I think they need to go in their next move. I felt that was the direction we needed to go. I felt that was the question everyone wanted to know: Was [...] good or was <b>it</b> <b>bad?</b> Was it right? Are you happy or you're not?" [...] Garrett continued to maintain that he had no idea of Usher's state of marriage {{during the time of the}} song's development, stating that the record could have meant anything, saying, [...] "I'm a heavy believer in God. I'm a Pisces. My intuition is crazy. I think that's healthy in the process for me writing and producing for people. Maybe it was a sign of what my man was going through and he needed to get out. Maybe it was something she needed to hear as a wake-up call to her." ...|$|E
