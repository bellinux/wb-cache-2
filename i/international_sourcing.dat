40|$|Rapid {{internationalization}} {{of services}} firms has recently become driven also by <b>international</b> <b>sourcing</b> (captive offshoring and offshore outsourcing). The rising extent of services sourcing, within industries and within firms, {{increased number of}} functional activities sourced and ever wider cross - national spreading (with the rising share of developing economies amongst hostand home economies) calls for {{better understanding of the}} ongoing structural change. We explore the effects <b>international</b> <b>sourcing</b> comparativelyand look for the differences of between services and manufacturing firms. The data set that links the recently conducted Eurostatsʼsurvey on <b>international</b> <b>sourcing</b> and detailed financial firm-level data, and enables exploring firm-level heterogeneity, different sourcing strategies and effects of <b>international</b> <b>sourcing</b> by applying matching methodology. Compared to manufacturing the drivers for <b>international</b> <b>sourcing</b> of services firms seem to be more long-term oriented and the strategies aim far beyond cost cutting and efficiency. Results suggest that services firms involved in <b>international</b> <b>sourcing</b> gained improvement in quality and technological learning resulting in employment growth and development, which was not the case for manufacturing firms driven primarily by cost cutting. Understanding these effects is vital also for manufacturing firms in the process of servitization...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – Research results {{concerning}} the cost‐saving potential of <b>international</b> <b>sourcing</b> have been ambiguous and the topic has been covered in isolation without accounting for influences of alternative cost‐saving approaches. This paper aims {{to analyze the}} expected financial impact of <b>international</b> <b>sourcing</b> in relation to savings potential attributed to other sourcing tactics, such as, e. g. collaborative product improvement. Furthermore, the paper tests for potential trade‐offs between different levers. Design/methodology/approach – Data stem from results of 134 cross‐functional cost‐saving workshops using an identical methodology. Workshop participants identified and estimated cost‐saving projects considering seven sourcing levers. Results were recorded in a standardized way and analyzed scrutinizing secondary data. Findings – Contrary to other studies, data revealed that <b>international</b> <b>sourcing</b> projects averaged 3. 4 percent savings expectations. More than 80 percent of total savings potential was attributed to other sourcing levers, such as pooling of demand or process improvement. Results highlight possible trade‐offs between <b>international</b> <b>sourcing</b> and, e. g. joint product optimization. Research limitations/implications – A rigorous and strict, highly standardized method was employed and data were validated via cross‐functional team discussions, however, ex ante expectations instead of ex post realized savings are analyzed. Practical implications – Findings give guidance {{on the importance of}} <b>international</b> <b>sourcing</b> compared to other levers and help to correct the misconception of <b>international</b> <b>sourcing</b> as a “purchasing panacea. ” The findings highlight the need to develop a coherent sourcing strategy for specific commodity groups, including reinforcing tactics and avoiding trade‐offs. Originality/value – For the first time, explicitly cost‐savings expectations from <b>international</b> <b>sourcing</b> have been analyzed together with other cost‐saving levers concerning relative importance and possible trade‐offs among them...|$|E
40|$|Purpose of {{this paper}} The purpose {{of this paper}} is to achieve an <b>international</b> <b>sourcing</b> {{framework}} considering environmental sustainability. Design/methodology/approach The paper is based on a research synthesis from existing literature and arriving at a conceptual framework considering areas of <b>international</b> <b>sourcing,</b> environmental logistics and environmental purchasing.

40|$|Studies of {{international}} environmental regulation have traditionally focused on transboundary pollution {{as the major}} explanation {{of international}} regulation. As a consequence, domestic <b>sources</b> of <b>international</b> environmental regulation were neglected. In this paper, the domestic and <b>international</b> <b>sources</b> of <b>international</b> environmental regulation are outlined and their effects tested for the international regulation of acid rain in Europe. In the analysis, the complex interdependence approach and the foreign environmental policy approach represent the major theories {{in the tradition of}} the <b>international</b> <b>sources</b> of <b>international</b> environmental regulation. Among the domestic factors, a range of elite attitudes are evaluated as well as economic and technological factors. The results from the empirical analysis generally shows minor support for those theories which stress the importance of the <b>international</b> <b>sources</b> of regulation, while the cost of regulation and access to technology are more strongly associated with a country's support for international environmental regulation...|$|R

40|$|We analyse the {{relationship}} between <b>international</b> <b>sourcing,</b> measured as imports of intermediate inputs, and the technical efficiency of firms in the information and communications technologies (ICT) manufacturing industry in Sweden. Using stochastic frontier analysis, we provide evidence that global sourcing improves firms’ capabilities to combine and re-combine inputs in productive ways, thereby increasing technical efficiency. We find a robust relationship between technical efficiency and international outsourcing. First, we find that firms that are deeply integrated into global sourcing networks are closer to their own production frontier. Second, firms that are engaged in <b>international</b> <b>sourcing</b> are also closer to the industry efficiency frontier. These {{findings are consistent with}} the argument that <b>international</b> <b>sourcing</b> stimulates firms’ capabilities by enabling them to identify and adopt higher quality inputs or more efficient production and management practices. These findings also suggest that the variety and extent of firms’ global sourcing networks constitute an important source of differences in efficiency levels among firms the ICT manufacturing industry...|$|E
40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the trend toward}} using <b>international</b> <b>sources</b> to interpret the Constitution. While recognizing that <b>international</b> <b>sources</b> may be appropriately used as persuasive authority in certain types of constitutional analysis, this article argues that such reliance is inappropriate if done improperly. There are four misuses of <b>international</b> <b>sources</b> that serve {{as the focus of}} the article. The first misuse of <b>international</b> <b>sources</b> - particularly evident in death penalty litigation - occurs when the global opinions of humankind are ascribed constitutional value to thwart the domestic opinions of Americans. The article suggests that international norms cannot be internalized within our Constitution unless such norms are first internalized by our people as our community standards. That is, international standards cannot serve as community standards unless they reflect our own national experience. To conclude otherwise would grant countermajoritarian international norms constitutional relevance as a community standard. The second misuse of <b>international</b> <b>sources</b> occurs when treaties are elevated to a status they do not enjoy under our federal system. The entire edifice of constitutional law rests on the foundation that the acts of the political branches are subject to and limited by the Constitution. Proposing that international law be part of the canon of constitutional material improperly empowers the political branches to create source materials - treaties and executive agreements - that serve as interpretive inputs to the process of constitutional decision making. The third misuse of <b>international</b> <b>sources</b> occurs when the Court references them haphazardly, relying on only those materials that are readily at its fingertips. In the international legal arena, where the Court has little or no expertise, the Court is unduly susceptible to selective and incomplete presentations of the true state of international and foreign affairs. If the suggestion is that <b>international</b> <b>sources</b> may cast an empirical light on the consequences of different solutions to a common legal problem, it is incumbent upon the Court to engage in empirical rather than haphazard comparativism. It is far from evident that this is what the Court is doing. A final misuse occurs when international and foreign materials are used selectively. In a country that considers itself the world 2 ̆ 7 s foremost protector of civil liberties, what is perhaps most surprising about the enthusiasm for comparativism is the assumption that it will enhance rather than diminish basic human rights in this country. This assumption is either blind to our visionary leadership, deaf to the discord in the international instruments, or selectively mute in giving voice to only certain topics for comparison...|$|R

40|$|There is {{an ongoing}} debate in the United States and {{elsewhere}} {{on the effects of}} outsourcing and offshoring on employment and wages, yet little is known how U. S. enterprises have restructured their organizations by externalizing business functions domestically and internationally. This paper presents the results from a pilot survey that uses a business function framework to collect information about the domestic and <b>international</b> <b>sourcing</b> practices of United States organizations. Our results suggest that offshoring is not as pervasive as might be expected and appears to be most common in large goods - producing companies. Offshoring is spread across all business functions and <b>international</b> <b>sourcing</b> is more commonly from foreign affiliates than in dependent contractors. Perhaps most surprisingly, most offshoring is to countries with costs that are the similar to the United States. About two thirds of internal domestic employment is in the primary business function, and the distribution of employment by business function is roughly similar across industry groupings. Wages show clear variation across business functions. We find that <b>international</b> <b>sourcing</b> is positively related to percentage of workers in high wage jobs, suggesting that offshoring is complementary to domestic activities and may substitute for low wage jobs...|$|E
40|$|This paper explores {{offshoring}} of firms’ {{research and}} development functions. Our analysis employs a previously untapped and unique Eurostat <b>International</b> <b>Sourcing</b> Survey. The results are easy to summarize. First, the magnitude of R&D offshoring is small.

Third, most of R&D offshoring from Europe is directed to high-income European countries, not so to low-cost countries in Europe, China, or India. Fourth, R&D jobs do have been lost from offshoring; however, the negative employment impact has been moderate. But the Eurostat <b>International</b> <b>Sourcing</b> Survey does not allow entangling the full net employment effect of R&D offshoring, which could be either negative or positive.
