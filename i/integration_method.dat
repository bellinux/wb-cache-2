25|$|Currently {{there are}} two Poisson solvers {{implemented}} in BioMOCA based on the finite difference method. One uses the pre-conditioned Conjugate Gradient scheme (pCG) and is used by default. The later is borrowed from an APBS solver, which uses a V-multi-grid scheme. Other than the numerical approach to solve the Poisson equation, {{the main difference between}} the two solvers is on how they address the permittivity in the system. In the first solver, a dielectric value is assigned to each cell in the grid, while in the APBS solver the dielectric coefficients are defined on the grid nodes. As discussed earlier box <b>integration</b> <b>method</b> is used in the pCG solver, which allows us to treat the Poisson equation in the most accurate way. Even though a full multigrid solver based on box-integration method has been under development, there is a neat way to reuse the already exiting code and treat the ion channel systems.|$|E

There is a direct or explicit and an implicit variant of the method. The direct variant was published by Schofield [...] in 1973 as a personal communication from Beeman. [...] This is what {{is commonly known as}} Beeman's method. It is a variant of the Verlet <b>integration</b> <b>method.</b> [...] It produces identical positions, but uses a different formula for the velocities.

40|$|Differential {{kinematic}} has a {{wide range}} application area in robot kinematics. The main advantage of the differential kinematic {{is that it can}} be easily implemented any kind of mechanisms. In differential kinematic method, Jacobian is used as a mapping operator in the velocity space. The joint velocities are required to be integrated to obtain the pose of the robot manipulator. This integration can be evaluated by using numerical <b>integration</b> <b>methods,</b> since the inverse kinematic equations are highly complex and nonlinear. Thus, the performances of the numerical <b>integration</b> <b>methods</b> affect the trajectory tracking application. This paper compares the performances of numerical <b>integration</b> <b>methods</b> in the trajectory tracking application of redundant robot manipulators.
