[...] This is the opposite of the traditional practice on ocean liners, but the design allowed for larger rooms to be contained within the stronger hull, as well as for more passenger cabins to have private balconies higher up on the ship, where they are less affected by large waves. Payne attempted to create a central axis to the two main public room decks (similar in fashion to the Normandie), but a full vista is broken by various public rooms that span the <b>full</b> <b>beam</b> of the ship.

40|$|Radio {{polarisation}} {{images of}} the jets of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) can provide a deep insight into the launching and collimation mechanisms of relativistic jets. However, even at VLBI scales, resolution is often a limiting factor in the conclusions that {{can be drawn from}} observations. The Maximum Entropy Method (MEM) is a deconvolution algorithm that can outperform the more common CLEAN algorithm in many cases, particularly when investigating structures present on scales comparable to or smaller than the nominal beam size with "super-resolution". A new implementation of the MEM suitable for single- or multiple-wavelength VLBI polarisation observations has been developed and is described here. Monte Carlo simulations comparing the performances of CLEAN and MEM at reconstructing the properties of model images are presented; these demonstrate the enhanced reliability of MEM over CLEAN when {{images of the}} fractional polarisation and polarisation angle are constructed using convolving beams that are appreciably smaller than the <b>full</b> CLEAN <b>beam.</b> The results of using this new MEM software to image VLBA observations of the AGN 0716 + 714 at six different wavelengths are presented, and compared to corresponding maps obtained with CLEAN. MEM and CLEAN maps of Stokes $I$, the polarised flux, the fractional polarisation and the polarisation angle are compared for convolving beams ranging from the <b>full</b> CLEAN <b>beam</b> down to a beam one-third of this size. MEM's ability to provide more trustworthy polarisation imaging than a standard CLEAN-based deconvolution when convolving beams appreciably smaller than the <b>full</b> CLEAN <b>beam</b> are used is discussed.
