40|$|The {{competition}} between intergranular and transgranular fracture in aluminium alloys with precipitate free zones (PFZs) along grain boundaries is investigated using a multiscale approach. Ductile fracture {{both in the}} grains and in the soft PFZ occurs through the nucleation of voids at second phase inclusions, their growth and subsequent coalescence.

The constitutive description used in both regions is an extension of the Gurson model, accounting for void shape effects, void rotation and hardening. The focus of the present paper is on the effect of the yield stress mismatch between both zones. For a high yield stress in the interior of the grains, the fracture is purely intergranular; for a low grain yield stress, the fracture is purely transgranular; and for <b>intermediate</b> <b>yield</b> stress, part of the fracture is intergranular and part of the fracture is transgranular. 1...|$|E
40|$|The first {{reference}} to landraces as genetic resources dates from 1890. Some 20 {{years later the}} first definitions of a landrace were published. In the period 1909 – 1952 several definitions of the term landrace have been presented. No definitions were discovered in articles published in the period 1953 – 1974.

Genetically related landraces form a landrace group. Synonyms of the term landrace and landrace group as cited in the literature are also given. The classification of types of landraces given by Mayr in 1934 had been discussed and an amended classification provided, paying attention to contamination caused by seed change.

40|$|Retention of {{hydrogen}} bubbles within consolidated soft sediments represents an important safety {{consideration for the}} management of legacy nuclear wastes due to the potential for acute gas release. Gas retention sufficiently reduced the bulk density of <b>intermediate</b> <b>yield</b> stress (< 800 Pa) sediments for the bed to become buoyant with respect to an aqueous supernatant, potentially inducing Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities. X-ray computed tomography revealed that beds of 7 - 234 Pa yield stress retained very similar, steady state size distributions of mature bubbles, limited to 9 mm equivalent spherical diameter, for long residence times. This implied a dominant gas release mechanism dictated by the pore to millimeter scale bubble population, not previously identified in such weak sediments and unrelated to the bubbles' buoyant force. At 1112 Pa yield stress, large bubbles of up to 20 mm diameter were observed to grow through induction of lateral cracks, facilitating gas transport to the bed periphery, thereby limiting the maximum void fraction, while non-homogeneous gas generation promoted the formation of low density regions rich with micro-bubbles which similarly provide pathways for gas release...|$|E

The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate green ear and grain yield in corn cultivars as a response to weed control achieved via intercropping with gliricidia. A completely randomized block design with five replicates and split-plots was used. Cultivars AG 1051, AG 2060, BRS 2020, and PL 6880 (assigned to plots) were submitted to the following treatments: no hoeing, hoeing (performed at 20 and 40 days after sowing the corn), and corn intercropped with gliricidia. Gliricidia was grown in a transplanting system to ensure uniform germination and fast establishment in the field. Seeding was made in 200 -cell trays with one seed per cell (35 mL volume). The plants emerged two to three days after sowing and were transplanted to a permanent site two to three days after emergence. Corn was sown on the same day gliricidia was transplanted. Sixteen weed species occurred at different frequencies, with uneven distribution in the experimental area. Cultivars AG 1051 and AG 2060 were the best with reference to most characteristics employed to evaluate green corn yield. Cultivar AG 1051 provided the highest grain yield. The highest green ear yield and grain yield values were obtained with hoeing.

This is largely due its superb nutritional value, consisting of protein that {{is rich in}} essential amino acids along with vitamins and minerals.

The present study involved 72 F 2 : 6 recombinant inbred lines (RIL) and parents developed through hybridization between highland (0654) and coastal (NL- 6) germplasm groups. The purpose was to characterize the quinoa germplasm developed, to assess the discriminating potential of 21 agro-morpho phenological traits, and to evaluate the extent of genetic variability recovered through selfing. A vast amount of genetic variation was detected among the 72 lines evaluated for quantitative and qualitative traits. Impressive transgressive segregation was measured for seed yield (22. 42 g/plant), while plant height and maturity had higher heritabilities (73 and 89 %, respectively). Other notable characters segregating in the population included panicle and stem color, panicle form, and resistance to downy mildew. In the Principal Component analysis, the first axis explained 74 % of the total variation and was correlated to plant height, panicle size, stem diameter, biomass, mildew reaction, maturation, and seed yield; those traits are relevant discriminatory characters. Yield correlated positively with panicle length and biomass. UPGMA based cluster analysis identified three groups: one consisting of late, mildew-resistant, high yielding lines; one having semi-late lines with <b>intermediate</b> <b>yield</b> and mildew susceptibility; and a third cluster consisting of early to semi-late accessions with low yield and mildew susceptibility.

Here, we explore potential solutions by assessing whether land sparing (farming for high yield, potentially enabling the protection of non-farmland habitat), land sharing (lower yielding farming with more biodiversity within farmland) or a mixed strategy would result in better bird conservation outcomes for a specified level of agricultural production. We surveyed forest and farmland study areas in southern Uganda, measuring the population density of 256 bird species and agricultural yield: food energy and gross income. Parametric non-linear functions relating density to yield were fitted. Species were identified as "winners" (total population size always at least as great with agriculture present as without it) or "losers" (total population sometimes or always reduced with agriculture present) {{for a range of}} targets for total agricultural production. For each target we determined whether each species would be predicted to have a higher total population with land sparing, land sharing or with any intermediate level of sparing at an <b>intermediate</b> <b>yield.</b> We found that most species were expected to have their highest total populations with land sparing, particularly loser species and species with small global range sizes. Hence, more species would benefit from high-yield farming if used as part of a strategy to reduce forest loss than from low-yield farming and land sharing, as has been found in Ghana and India in a previous study. We caution against advocacy for high-yield farming alone as a means to deliver land sparing if it is done without strong protection for natural habitats, other ecosystem services and social welfare. Instead, we suggest that conservationists explore how conservation and agricultural policies can be better integrated to deliver land sparing by, for example, combining land-use planning and agronomic support for small farmers...|$|E
40|$|Ischemic {{damage from}} a {{myocardial}} infarction can have dramatic {{negative effects on}} the heart's ability to adequately perfuse the body, due to the irreversible loss of over a billion cardiomyocytes responsible for ventricular contraction. Regenerative therapies utilizing multipotent cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) derived from either human embryonic (hESCs) or {{induced pluripotent stem cells}} have gained popularity as potential alternatives to someday replace expensive, high-risk medical procedures. Previous studies identified multipotent progenitors localized in the endocardial cushions of the developing mouse heart that co-expressed CD 31 and PDGFR&# 945;. Additionally, recent data in mice have shown that the loss of a single transcription factor, Scl, enabled robust cardiomyogenic differentiation from endothelium in the heart, resulting in the ectopic appearance of these progenitor cells. However, no studies have shown similar findings in humans. 	The {{purpose of this study is}} to identify these CD 31 +/PDGFR&# 945;+ cells in the human heart and generate cardiomyocyte-like cells from hESC-derived endothelium. It is hypothesized that human endogenous and embryonic stem cell-derived endothelial cells possess unrealized cardiomyogenic potential. Stained sagittal sections of week 9, 15, and 17 human fetal hearts showed the co-expression of the cell surface markers PDGFR&# 945; and CD 31 on cells surrounding the ventricular vasculature. In addition, a 5 -step protocol was used to differentiate hESCs into cardiomyocyte-like cells through an endothelial cell <b>intermediate.</b> <b>Yield</b> of isolated mesodermal progenitor cells was approximately 10. 5 %.

Under the modified protocol with and without the addition of lithium chloride, endothelial cell yields were 21. 3 % and 26. 6 % respectively. The hESC-derived endothelial cells showed the formation of blood tubes in vitro and, once in cardiac growth medium, expressed Troponin T under fluorescence microscopy.

The filamentous freshwater macroalga Oedogonium was grown under nutrient-depleted conditions to achieve a low nitrogen content, 1. 1 wt. % N. Its hydrothermal liquefaction in a continuous pilot plant reactor (300 - 350 °C, 3 - 5 min and 2 - 5 wt. % loadings) yielded up to 25 wt. % (dry ash-free basis, daf) extractable biocrude. More severe conditions led to biocrudes in higher yields, with reduced oxygen and slightly increased nitrogen contents, and with lower viscosity. The presence of co-solvents had little effect on the total biocrude yield but gave rise to in situ separation of the biocrude into distinct fractions associated with the organic phase (designated solvent oil) and the aqueous phase (designated DCM oil). The amount of solvent oil produced exceeded the amount that could be extracted at room temperature, by that solvent, from the product mixture obtained in the absence of co-solvent. The relative proportions and properties of the solvent and DCM fractions varied with the polarity of the co-solvent. Anisole co-solvent dissolved nearly all the biocrude and the resulting viscous oil was similar to that obtained without co-solvent. On the other hand, solvent oil produced with n-heptane (~. 7. 4 wt. % daf yield, or ~. 37 % of the total biocrude) had significantly reduced levels of nitrogen (1. 1 wt. %) and oxygen (12. 5 wt. %) and possessed relatively low viscosity.

Co-solvent HTL offers a simple and effective means of fractionating HTL biocrude on the basis of polarity.

Autologous blood or BM SCT was performed in 36 %, 64 %, 81 % and 88 %, respectively, of the patients assigned to the no harvest, low, intermediate and high CD 34 (+) yield group.

During the first growing season (2003 - 2004) nine commercial cultivars of durum wheat and four landraces were crossed. The following growing season (2004 - 2005), 17 crosses (F- 1 generation) were evaluated under low plant density (1. 15 plants m(- 2)) in a replicated (R- 21) honeycomb design. During the third growing season (2005 - 2006), the four highest yielding crosses, one cross with an <b>intermediate</b> <b>yield,</b> and the three crosses with the lowest yield (172 generation) were evaluated under low plant density in a R- 9 honeycomb design. Finally, in the fourth growing season (2006 - 2007) progeny of the aforementioned eight crosses (173 generation) and the ten parents were evaluated in a randomized complete block design in two locations. Furthermore, the genetic distance among the parents was determined using the SSR and RAPD molecular markers. It was observed that the three F- 3 populations with the lowest yielding ability were the ones with the lowest mid-parental value. In addition, one of the two top F- 3 populations was second in the rank according to the mid-parental value. Furthermore, the two top F- 3 populations were also the highest yielding in the F- 1 and F- 2 generations. On the contrary, none of these crosses were predicted by the genetic distance as it was calculated using the SSR and RAPID molecular markers.

The study was conducted to investigate possible variations on milk yield and components, profile of casein, and lipolysis of fat. Forty-four goats were assigned to five distinct genotypes as two homozygous, one for high (AA) and the other for <b>intermediate</b> <b>yield</b> (EE); and three heterozygous named AE, AF, and EF for the &# 945;s 1 -casein. For lipolysis, milk was sampled in four aliquots which were treated soon after milking and 24 hours after cooling. Differences were observed for both casein yield and its fractions. No difference was found for other variables. The AA genotype presented the higher content of both casein (28. 6 g/L) and &# 945;S 1 -cn (22. 3 %). Other genotypes averaged 20. 4 g/L for casein content. Values of &# 945;S 1 -cn were 12. 1 % for heterozygous and 10. 1 and 9. 1 % for both EE and EF genotype respectively. Cooling the milk for 24 hours increased the rate of lipolysis.

40|$|Research {{was carried}} out on the {{possible}} yield increase of crops in The Netherlands {{by the use of}} PSS (partial soil sterilization) on the soil, on the basis of published as well as unpublished data and by experimentation with different disinfectants, soils and plants. Following review of the literature and the methods employed are chapters dealing with inventory of quantitative data, PSS treatments of random fields without known problems, of soils with known nematode problems, and of fresh uninfested soils, with a final chapter on diagnostic studies on one particular PSS effect in oat. PSS was applied to 600, 000 ha, 1 % of the land, in the U. S. A. and to 40, 000 ha, 4 % of the arable land, in The Netherlands in 1969. The literature of the last five years comprises more than 400 scientific articles, but no reliable estimates have apparently been published about the magnitude of the effect of PSS in general, nor has the effect on plant growth been fully explained. The effect of the various PSS treatments, physical as well as chemical, may be direct in connection with the ingredients applied or the soil organisms or the soil itself, and indirect, e. g. in connection with plant growth. Plant growth is the main parameter used to measure PSS effects in this study, although density of pathogens (especially nematodes), and the chemical soilfertility (especially in connection with nitrogen) have sometimes been assessed as well. The approach and the methods employed in this study were partly statististical and partly experimental; in both cases common techniques were used. The data were usually arranged after calculations and tested by means of the IBM and CDC computerfacilities of the Landbouwhogeschool. Altogether 2453 individual treatment-soil-plant combinations from trials in The Netherlands during the period 1947 - 1970 could be collected. They were derived from the author's 545 experiments, from unpublished files of the Plantenziektenkundige Dienst, the Landbouwhogeschool and other institutions or individual researchers, and from literature. For each separate item the growth or yield was calculated as a percentage of untreated, and inclusive of supplementary data inserted into a computer card. After standardization and comprehension of the data special computer programmes furnished a number of tables and diagrams (Tables 2 - 9, Figs. 1 - 6). The yield on treated soil showed as general average 141 % of untreated, or 154 % without phytotoxic cases. For PSS treatments with the best known chemicals these figures were 151 %/ 164 %. If for each crop the average best treatment is selected, 172 %/ 188 % is reached. The average results of the treatments increased from pentachloronitrobenzene (103 %/ 118 %), via Vapam, Trapex, dichloropropene and chloropicrin to heat (221 %/ 240 %). The recommended doses normally used in practice appeared to give optimal average PSS effects. The percentage phytotoxic cases was on an average about 20 %. It, did not increase with higher doses, but was strongly correlated with the boiling point of the fumigants used. The crop averages differed widely. Pea, barley and woody plants seldom reached a good yield unless PSS had been applied. For grass, clover, potato and cabbage an <b>intermediate</b> <b>yield</b> increase was usually reached, whereas the response to PSS of many crops was low on some and very high on other soils. The measure of growth improvement was strongly correlated to the presence of known noxious pests and diseases (Tables 5 - 7). They were according to this inventory, very low on new polder soil, or clean sand, or fresh peat (99 %/ 114 %), and moderate on random soils without known infestation (115 %/ 125 %), as compared to the overall average already mentioned above (141 %/ 154 %), The effects varied much with soil type; they decreased from loamy sand, via clay soil, peaty sand, diluvial sand and dune sand to silty clay. The effect for polder sand (mainly fresh soils) was slight and for river sand it was even negligeably small, indicating the absence of stimulatory effects on plant growth by the chemicals themselves. PSS effects also varied with the different localities throughout the country. The relatively high effects for the Winschoten and Wageningen districts are the result of numerous experiments on heavily nematode- infested plots and experiments with imported loads of infested test soils. Therefore they are not representative for these districts. The low effect for Emmeloord district reflects results obtained on new, uninfested polder soils. The PSS treatments on 11 random fields without known problems (treatments with chloropicrin, dichloropropene and pentachloronitrobenzene, 7 to 14 test crops per field, three replicates) reached an average yield of 113 %, or 122 % excluding the phytotoxic cases, or 156 % for the average of the best treatments of each soil-crop combination. Nearly all crops suffered heavy yield losses on some fields and nearly all fields contained noxious problems for some crops which could be solved by PSS treatment (Fig. 7). The potential effect of PSS applied to all agricultural land including the problem fields must exceed 156 %, but should be less than 188 % found above as the average for all trials in The Netherlands. Five PSS treatments applied in pottrials to eight soils, with a known, noxious nematode problem and grown with nematode susceptible test plants, illustrated strong growth responses according to expectation, except for two soils where nematodes were probably not the main nor the sole problem, and except for some phytotoxic effects (Tables 11 - 26, Figs. 9 - 19). Dichloropropene was as effective as heat and chloropicrin in these soils with respect to nematode control and reached about the same yield increases. The nematicidal effect of Ternik was delayed but sustained; its systemic potencies were confirmed, but sometimes it was phytotoxic. Captan showed poor nematicidal, but not wholly negligeable effect. It was among the best treatments only in one soil with a suspected fungus infestation (Fig. 19) and was strongly phytotoxic in two soils (Figs. 17, 18). In pot trials with five PSS treatments of soils without or with very few noxious organisms caused only barely measurable growth responses to the crops carrot, rose and ryegrass (Tables 29, 31 and Figs. 20 - 24). Two unidentified, probably seed-borne problems, i. e. loss of seedlings and branching of roots, encountered in carrot, did not show up in soils previously disinfected with beat, chloropicrin or a very heavy dose of dichloropropene (Fig. 21). Diagnostic studies on an important PSS effect on oat, in soils infested with a complex of freeliving root-infesting nematodes (Pratylenchus crenatus + Tylenchorhynchus dubius + Rotylenchus robustus) proved, that inoculation with the nematode could produce the damage for the greater part (Tables 33 - 37, Figs. 25 - 27). The possible contribution of other organisms was however not excluded. The inoculation procedure seemed to cause important losses amongst the nematodes thus inoculated. For some species these were even aggravated by using steamed or heated soil shortly prior to the test...|$|E
40|$|The Kinetic Mechanism of PAMO from Thermobifida fusca Phenylacetone monooxygenase (PAMO) from Thermobifida fusca is a FAD-containing Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase (BVMO). To {{elucidate}} {{the mechanism of}} conversion of phenylacetone by PAMO, we have performed a detailed steady-state and pre-steady-state kinetic analysis. In the catalytic cycle (kcat = 3. 1 s- 1), rapid binding of NADPH (Kd = 0. 7 µM) {{is followed by a}} transfer of the 4 (R) -hydride from NADPH to the FAD cofactor (kred = 12 s- 1). The reduced PAMO is rapidly oxygenated by molecular oxygen (kox = 870 mM- 1. s- 1), yielding a C 4 a-peroxy-flavin. The peroxyflavin enzyme intermediate reacts with phenylacetone to form benzylacetate (k 1 = 73 s- 1). This latter kinetic event leads to an enzyme intermediate which we could not unequivocally assign and may represent a Criegee intermediate or a C 4 a-hydroxyflavin form. The relatively slow decay (4. 1 s- 1) of this <b>intermediate</b> <b>yields</b> fully reoxidized PAMO and limits the turnover rate. NADP+ release is relatively fast and represents the final step of the catalytic cycle. Thi...|$|R
