5000|$|Commentator Ken Alder {{noted that}} {{on the eve of}} the French Revolution a quarter of a million {{different}} units of measure were in use in France; in many cases the quantity associated with each unit of measure differed from town to town and often from trade to trade. He claimed that the metric system originated in the ideology of Pure Reason from the more radical element of the French Revolution, that it was devised in France to try to make France [...] "revenue-rich, militarily potent, and easily administered", and that it was part of a conscious plan to transform French culture, meant to unify and transform French society: [...] "As mathematics was the language of science, so would the metric system be the language of commerce and industry." [...] In his 1998 monograph Seeing Like a State: How Certain Schemes to Improve the Human Condition Have Failed, James C. Scott argued that central governments attempt to impose what he calls [...] "legibility" [...] on their subjects. Local customs concerning measurements, like local customs concerning patronymics, tend to come under severe pressure from bureaucrats. Scott's thesis is that in order for schemes to improve the human condition to succeed, they must take into account local conditions, and that the high-modernist ideologies of the 20th century have prevented this. Scott cites the enforcement of the metric system as a specific example of this sort of failed and resented [...] "improvement" [...] imposed by centralizing and standardizing authority. While the metric system was introduced in the French law by the revolutionary government in April 1795, it did not immediately displace traditional measurements in the popular mind. In fact, its use was initially associated with officialdom and elitism as Chateaubriand remarked in 1828: [...] "Whenever you meet a fellow who, instead of talking arpents, toises, and pieds, refers to hectares, metres, and centimetres, rest assured, the man is a prefect." [...] However, it was largely used in France and in other countries by July 1837 when the <b>decimal</b> <b>metric</b> <b>system</b> was finally decided upon and considered the only official measurement system to be used in France.|$|E

40|$|The Bureau International des Poids et Mesures, the BIPM, was {{established}} by Article 1 of the Convention du Mètre, on 20 May 1875, and is charged with providing {{the basis for a}} single, coherent system of measurements to be used throughout the world. The <b>decimal</b> <b>metric</b> <b>system,</b> dating {{from the time of the}} French Revolution, was based on the metre and the kilogram. Under the terms of the 1875 Convention, new international prototypes of the metre and kilogram were made and formally adopted by the first Conférence Générale des Poids et Mesures (CGPM) in 1889. Over time this system developed, so that it now includes seven base units. In 1960 it was decided at the 11 th CGPM that it should be called the Système International d’Unités, the SI (in English: the International System of Units). The SI is not static but evolves to match the world’s increasingly demanding requirements for measurements at all levels of precision and in all areas of science, technology, and human endeavour. This document is a summary of the SI Brochure, a publication of the BIPM which is a statement of the current status of the SI. The seven base units of the SI, listed in Table 1, provide the reference used to define all the measurement units of the International System. As science advances, and methods of measurement are refined, their definitions have to be revised.

40|$|A sawmill {{operations}} were studied {{to know the}} coefficient of utilization and the dimensional quality of the timber located in the Sierra Sur of Oaxaca, Mexico. This was done during the transformation of pieces of wood in the Pinus spp. at the facilities of the Specialized Unit of Communal Forest Resources, located {{in the village of}} Santa Cruz Itundujia. A total of 101 pieces of wood were analyzed using the Samalian formula; the pieces had varied diametric measures, length of 2. 63 m, and a volume of 63. 37 and 58. 35 m 3, with and without bark. To determine the efficiency of sawed wood, the pieces of wood were classified in groups of eight diametric categories and seven of conical shape. The study of time and movement included analysis of observations per sampling in intervals of two minutes to the three principal sections of the sawmill (saw, edge banding machine, and circular saw). When the pieces of wood were processed, 1875 planks were generated with a 19. 05 mm of thickness; the production was evaluated in third and fourth class which was located with the <b>decimal</b> <b>metric</b> <b>system,</b> symbolizing 30. 12 m 3 of sawed wood.

A parte empírica deste trabalho aconteceu no período de 6 meses na Escola do Combu, localizada na Ilha do Combu-PA durante o acompanhamento das turmas de Educação Infantil e do Ciclo Básico. Esta pesquisa justifica-se pela busca da compreensão da necessidade de aproximação entre as operações matemáticas e o cotidiano imaginário dos alunos ribeirinhos, a partir da construção de suas casas, cascos (embarcação feita artesanalmente em troco de árvore), canoas, matapis (armadilhas para pegar camarão, feita com fibra da mata), tupés (tapetes para secagem do cacau feito de fibra da mata), redes, brinquedos, cestos. As concepções metodológicas estão pautadas nos princípios da pesquisa qualitativa, baseada na abordagem etnográfica, a fim de sistematizar conhecimentos sobre necessidades e dificuldades da interação entre a Matemática escolar e a cultura local. A prática pedagógica da professora em questão demonstra preocupações em aproximar o ensino de Matemática à diversidade cultural, {{peculiar}} ao local, a partir de aulas construídas na parceria dos saberes tradicionais como a tessitura de tupés, para exploração de elementos geométricos, uso de matapis como material didático para a construção de sistema métrico decimal entre outros.

The empiric part of this work happened in the period of six months at the School of Combu, located in the Island of the Combu during the attendance of the groups of Infantile Education and of the Basic Cycle. This research is justified for the approach need between the mathematical operations and the daily imaginary of the riverine students, starting from the construction of their houses, skulls (embarkation done handicraftly in exchange for tree), canoes, matapis (traps to catch shrimp done with fiber of the forest), tupés (rugs for drying of the cocoa done of fiber of the forest), nets, toys, baskets. The methodological conceptions are ruled in the beginnings of the qualitative research, based on the approach ethnographic, in order to systematize knowledge about needs and difficulties of the interaction between the scholar mathematics and the local culture. The teacher's pedagogic practice in subject demonstrates concerns with approximating the mathematics teaching the peculiar cultural diversity to the place starting from classes built in the partnership of the you know traditional as the tupés tessitura for exploration of geometric elements, matapis use as didactic material for the construction of <b>decimal</b> <b>metric</b> <b>system</b> among others.
