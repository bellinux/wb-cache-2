50|$|Like most {{stationary}} {{engines of}} the time, Zimmerman's new engine was water-cooled - a jacket around the cylinder {{was filled with}} water to keep the <b>engine</b> <b>cool</b> while the engine was in use.

50|$|Glow engines {{generally}} {{have to be}} run slightly rich with a higher fuel/air ratio than is ideal {{in order to keep}} the <b>engine</b> <b>cool.</b> The uncombusted fuel expelled out the exhaust also takes heat with it, providing the cooling effect. Because of this, vehicles with glow engines generally get coated with lots of oil. Almost all the oil mixed with the fuel is unconsummed and comes out the exhaust, as well as some of the nitromethane and methanol as well. This requires some cleaning when one is done using the model.|$|E

40|$|<b>Engine</b> <b>cooling</b> {{and thermal}} {{management}} system is very essential in an automotive industry. It has been existed for decades but only recently been explored for revolution. This study explores current conventional <b>engine</b> <b>cooling,</b> specifically detailing out specifications for wax type conventional thermostat and engine driven water pump. In conventional cooling study, improvement {{has been made}} on thermostat opening temperature. Actual experimental set up has been installed and result recorded. Impact on this change has been studied in term of engine coolant inlet and outlet temperature, radiator, bypass flow rate and also Euro 3 emission compliance. This study also highlights the limitation of current conventional <b>engine</b> <b>cooling</b> and thermal management system, thus requiring revolution to the system. Advanced <b>engine</b> <b>cooling</b> and thermal management system is then explored as a revolution of <b>engine</b> <b>cooling</b> and thermal management system. This further brings us to study on electrification of <b>engine</b> <b>cooling</b> components mainly on electric control valve and electric water pump. The control system is also improved through integration between <b>engine</b> input/output and <b>cooling</b> input /output for optimum combination. 2 case studies have been reviewed which are Chevrolet Tahoe, 5. 77 litre (Chalgren Jr, 2004) and Ford Excursion 6. 0 liter diesel (Chalgren and Allen, 2005). In these two studies, electric water pump, electric valve, dual variable speed fan and also restrictor at bypass to boost heater core coolant flow have been fully examined and effect on <b>engine</b> <b>cooling</b> and thermal management system is observed. A lot of improvement seen from this revolution namely improvement in fuel consumption, reduced warm up time, better emission control, better cabin temperature during cold start, better coolant temperature fluctuation and also reduction in parasitic loss. ...|$|R

50|$|The 1000 MB was {{a stylish}} four-door saloon (measuring 13 feet 8 {{inches in length}} and 5 feet 4 inches in width, with a {{wheelbase}} of 7 feet 10 inches), which featured a steeply sloping nose that was flanked by rounded front wings (not unlike the Ford Anglia 105E of the time). Being a rear-engined car, the 1000 MB’s radiator and (engine-driven) cooling fan were situated in the rear engine compartment, so therefore a series of slats were cut into each rear wing and the rear panel to increase the flow rate of air in order to assist in keeping the <b>engine</b> <b>cool.</b> Apart {{from the use of}} cooling vents in the rear wings and rear panel, everything else about the 1000 MB’s styling was normal, which was undoubtedly in an attempt to appeal to all the conservative-minded buyers in export countries like the UK.

50|$|Either an {{electrical}} starter or an air-start system {{is used to}} start the engine turning. On large engines, pre-lubrication and slow turning of an engine, as well as heating, are required to minimise the amount of engine damage during initial start-up and running. Some smaller military diesels can be started with an explosive cartridge, called a Coffman starter, which provides the extra power required to get the machine turning. In the past, Caterpillar and John Deere used a small petrol pony engine in their tractors to start the primary diesel engine. The pony engine heated the diesel to aid in ignition and used a small clutch and transmission to spin up the diesel engine. Even more unusual was an International Harvester design in which the diesel engine had its own carburetor and ignition system, and started on petrol. Once warmed, the operator moved two levers to switch the engine to diesel operation, and work could begin. These engines had very complex cylinder heads, with their own petrol combustion chambers, and were vulnerable to expensive damage if special care was not taken (especially in letting the <b>engine</b> <b>cool</b> before turning it off).|$|E
