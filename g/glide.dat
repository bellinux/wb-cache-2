5|$|In 2002, Hwang et al. {{found that}} Microraptor {{was the most}} {{primitive}} dromaeosaurid. Xu and colleagues in 2003 cited the basal position of Microraptor, along with feather and wing features, {{as evidence that the}} ancestral dromaeosaurid could <b>glide.</b> In that case the larger dromaeosaurids would be secondarily terrestrial—having lost the ability to <b>glide</b> later in their evolutionary history.|$|E
5|$|<b>Glide</b> {{diffusion}} {{refers to}} the concerted motion of an entire cluster all at once (see figure 11(b)).|$|E
5|$|The {{consensus}} view {{in contemporary}} palaeontology {{is that the}} flying theropods, or avialans, are the closest relatives of the deinonychosaurs, which include dromaeosaurids and troodontids. Together, these form a group called Paraves. Some basal members of this group, such as Microraptor, have features which may have enabled them to <b>glide</b> or fly. The most basal deinonychosaurs were very small. This evidence {{raises the possibility that}} the ancestor of all paravians may have been arboreal, have been able to <b>glide,</b> or both. Unlike Archaeopteryx and the non-avialan feathered dinosaurs, who primarily ate meat, recent studies suggest that the first avialans were omnivores.|$|E

50|$|Welch was {{an active}} {{volunteer}} to the British <b>Gliding</b> Association as vice chairman. She also managed the British <b>Gliding</b> Team for twenty years, and organised competitions including the World <b>Gliding</b> Championships at South Cerney in 1965. Later, she was elected as delegate to the FAI's International <b>Gliding</b> Commission and acted as jury member at several World <b>Gliding</b> Championships.|$|R
5|$|A {{challenge}} {{to all of}} these alternative scenarios came when Turner and colleagues in 2007 described a new dromaeosaurid, Mahakala, which they found to be the most basal and most primitive member of the Dromaeosauridae, more primitive than Microraptor. Mahakala had short arms and no ability to <b>glide.</b> Turner et al. also inferred that flight evolved only in the Avialae, and these two points suggested that the ancestral dromaeosaurid could not <b>glide</b> or fly. Based on this cladistic analysis, Mahakala suggests that the ancestral condition for dromaeosaurids is non-volant. However, in 2012, an expanded and revised study incorporating the most recent Dromaeosaurid finds recovered the Archaeopteryx-like Xiaotingia as the most primitive member of the clade Dromaeosauridae, which appears to suggest the earliest members of the clade may have been capable of flight.|$|E
5|$|A former member, Lewis had {{a privileged}} {{upbringing}} {{and sought to}} help the less fortunate and fight oppression and corruption as a crime-fighter. To this end Lewis created a costume with special wings that helped him <b>glide.</b> His mental stability ultimately deteriorated after he was called before HUAC, leading to him being forcibly brought to a mental asylum.|$|E
5|$|Carnaby's black {{cockatoo}} flies with deep, slow wingbeats, {{giving it}} a wavelike movement. It can also <b>glide</b> for extended periods with its wings held downwards. Flocks generally fly at height, descending to treetops to feed or roost. Birds can be agile, manoeuvring quickly if startled or disturbed. In contrast, they waddle awkwardly on the ground.|$|E
50|$|Formulated in 1946, the Home Command <b>Gliding</b> Instructors School (HCGIS) was {{established}} in 1949 at RAF Detling to train Qualified <b>Gliding</b> Instructors for the gliding schools. With the disestablishment of Home Command, HCGIS was split into two <b>Gliding</b> Centres to accommodate the gliding schools {{in the north and}} south of the UK. A further reorganisation amalgamated the <b>Gliding</b> Centres into the Central <b>Gliding</b> School in 1972 at RAF Spitalgate, where it renamed the Air Cadet Central <b>Gliding</b> School (ACCGS) in 1974. In 2009, following the formal approval of the CGS unit badge, the Air Cadet Central <b>Gliding</b> School was renamed the Royal Air Force Central <b>Gliding</b> School and in 2010 restructured under No.1 Elementary Flying Training School.|$|R

5|$|Courtship {{begins with}} a noisy flight by the male, {{followed}} by a graceful, circular <b>glide</b> with outstretched wings and head down. After landing, the male will approach the female with a puffed-out breast, bobbing head, and loud calls. Mated pairs will often preen each other's feathers.|$|E
5|$|Gallium is {{also used}} as a liquid metal ion source for a focused ion beam. For example, a focused gallium-ion beam was used to create the world's {{smallest}} book, Teeny Ted from Turnip Town. Another use of gallium is as an additive in <b>glide</b> wax for skis, and other low-friction surface materials.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Mayr and Peters {{described}} {{the anatomy of}} a very well preserved specimen of Archaeopteryx, and determined that its anatomy was more like non-avian theropods than previously understood. Specifically, they found that Archaeopteryx had a primitive palatine, unreversed hallux, and hyper-extendable second toe. Their phylogenetic analysis produced the controversial result that Confuciusornis was closer to Microraptor than to Archaeopteryx, making the Avialae a paraphyletic taxon. They also suggested that the ancestral paravian was able to fly or <b>glide,</b> and that the dromaeosaurids and troodontids were secondarily flightless (or had {{lost the ability to}} <b>glide).</b> Corfe and Butler criticized this work on methodological grounds.|$|E
50|$|There are 213 other gliders at the {{airfield}} operated by private owners and by affiliated gliding clubs: Imperial College <b>Gliding</b> Club, University of Surrey <b>Gliding</b> Club, Southampton University <b>Gliding</b> Club, The Crown Service <b>Gliding</b> Club and the IBM <b>Gliding</b> Club. Lasham Youth run a Saturday Evening gliding course {{during the summer}} months which is open to everyone, providing an environment where young members can fly with people of similar ages. The <b>Gliding</b> Heritage Centre has a separate hangar on the south side containing 26 historic gliders, many of which are in flying condition.|$|R
40|$|The {{pipistrelle}} bat Pipistrellus pipistrellus intersperses wingbeats in flapping flights with brief (0. 1 - 0. 3 s) <b>glides.</b> This undulating intermittent {{flight mode}} probably saves energy in flight. In large flight cages, captive pipistrelles <b>glided</b> for approximately 13. 4 % of flight time, but <b>glides</b> were steep, and the bat accelerated during the <b>glides.</b> The bats sometimes <b>glided</b> during turns. During the <b>glides</b> the bat {{may have been}} unable to emit echolocation pulses and, if so, this would explain occasional wide interpulse intervals in wild pipistrelles. The steepness of the <b>glides</b> may be a means of improving undulating flight performance, and may also be unavoidable owing to the very small size and relatively small wings of pipistrelles...|$|R
50|$|LS8's scored second, {{fourth and}} fifth in the 1995 World <b>Gliding</b> Championships at Omarama, New Zealand, first, second and third in the 1997 World <b>Gliding</b> Championships at St Auban, France, six {{out of the first}} ten {{positions}} in the 1999 World <b>Gliding</b> Championships in Bayreuth, Germany, the first three places in the 2001 Women's World <b>Gliding</b> Championships in Lithuania and, more recently, first (and nine out of the first ten places) in the 2005 Women's World <b>Gliding</b> Championships in Klix, Germany. In 2006 World <b>Gliding</b> Championships at Eskilstulna, Sweden, LS8 took the first and third places. LS8 was the winner of 2002, 2004, 2005, and 2007 European <b>Gliding</b> Championship. Many regard it as the best all-round standard class glider.|$|R
5|$|Some large {{woodpeckers}} such as Dryocopus have a fast, direct form of flight, but {{the majority}} of species have a typical undulating flight pattern consisting of a series of rapid flaps followed by a swooping <b>glide.</b> Many birds in the Melanerpes genus have distinctive, rowing wing-strokes while the piculets engage in short bursts of rapid direct flight.|$|E
5|$|Some marine halfbeaks, {{including}} Euleptorhamphus velox and Euleptorhamphus viridis, {{are known}} for their ability to jump {{out of the water and}} <b>glide</b> over the surface for considerable distances, and have consequently sometimes been called flying halfbeaks.|$|E
5|$|Alvarez {{spent the}} summer of 1943 in England testing GCA, landing planes {{returning}} from battle in bad weather, and also training the British {{in the use of}} the system. While there he encountered the young Arthur C. Clarke, who was an RAF radar technician. Clarke subsequently used his experiences at the radar research station as the basis for his novel <b>Glide</b> Path, which contains a thinly disguised version of Alvarez. Clarke and Alvarez developed a long-term friendship.|$|E

5|$|Between 2015 and 2017, {{upgrades}} from K185 to K200 {{were also}} completed in Kulm, Planica, and Oberstdorf. All are now equipped for jumps exceeding 240m (previous hill records were broken at each opening event), {{as well as}} having improved facilities for athletes and spectators; Harrachov remains the only hill (at K185) to have not been upgraded since the 1990s. Although the new hills are much larger than ever before, most of them feature longer and less steeply angled slopes, designed purely for the V-style and {{with the knowledge of}} 80 years' worth of world record progression. Inrun tables have also been placed further back from the knoll and flight curves made shallower in order to allow athletes to <b>glide</b> more efficiently along the contour of the slope. This has significantly reduced such precarious heights over the knoll {{as was the case in}} the early 1990s and prior: in that era, athletes using the parallel style would jump in a more upward trajectory off the table, reaching vast heights but at the expense of distance. Furthermore, rather than <b>glide,</b> they instead plummeted towards the slope. However, Planica remains extremely steep in the flight phase; Vikersund, by comparison, has a longer slope and does not enable as much height over the knoll.|$|E
5|$|Narayan {{increased}} {{the status of}} the sarangi to that of a modern concert solo instrument, made it known outside of India, and was the first sarangi player with international success, an example later followed by Sultan Khan. Narayan's simplified fingering technique allows for <b>glide</b> (meend) and affected the modern sarangi concert style, as aspects of his playing and tone creation were taken up by sarangi players from Narayan's recordings.|$|E
5|$|Playtex {{responded by}} litigating. In one suit, it alleged patent {{infringement}} over Pearl's applicator design.

5|$|The Mk VIII {{was also}} {{discussed}} {{in terms of}} another plan known as the Carrier Wing; in this plan flying surfaces, such as wings, would be fitted to the Mk VIII so that it could be towed by a transport aircraft and then <b>glide</b> into battle in support of airborne forces.
