5|$|Antiemetic {{medications}} may {{be helpful}} for treating vomiting in children. Ondansetron has some utility, with a single dose being associated with less need for <b>intravenous</b> fluids, fewer hospitalizations, and decreased vomiting. Metoclopramide might also be helpful. However, the use of ondansetron might possibly be linked to an increased rate of return to hospital in children. The <b>intravenous</b> preparation of ondansetron may be given orally if clinical judgment warrants. Dimenhydrinate, while reducing vomiting, {{does not appear to}} have a significant clinical benefit.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{introduction}} of antivenom, benzodiazepines and <b>intravenous</b> calcium gluconate were used to relieve symptoms of pain and distress, although calcium is not recommended as its benefit has not been shown in clinical trials.|$|E
5|$|Clindamycin is {{available}} as a generic drug, for both systemic (oral and <b>intravenous)</b> and topical use (The exception is the vaginal suppository, which is not {{available as a}} generic in the USA).|$|E
5|$|Evidence of {{worsening}} kidney damage {{would normally}} prompt a kidney biopsy. Treatment may be indicated {{on the basis}} of the appearance of the biopsy sample; various treatments may be used, ranging from oral steroids to a combination of <b>intravenous</b> methylprednisolone (steroid), cyclophosphamide and dipyridamole followed by prednisone. Other regimens include steroids/azathioprine, and steroids/cyclophosphamide (with or without heparin and warfarin). <b>Intravenous</b> immunoglobulin (IVIG) is occasionally used.|$|E
5|$|No {{definitive}} antidote is available, {{but some}} specific treatments {{have been shown}} to improve survivability. High-dose continuous <b>intravenous</b> penicillin G has been reported to be of benefit, though the exact mechanism is unknown, and trials with cephalosporins show promise. Some evidence indicates <b>intravenous</b> silibinin, an extract from the blessed milk thistle (Silybum marianum), may be beneficial in reducing the effects of death cap poisoning. A long-term clinical trial of <b>intravenous</b> silibinin began in the US in 2010. Silibinin prevents the uptake of amatoxins by liver cells, thereby protecting undamaged liver tissue; it also stimulates DNA-dependent RNA polymerases, leading to an increase in RNA synthesis. According to one report based on a treatment of 60 patients with silibinin, patients who started the drug within 96 hours of ingesting the mushroom and who still had intact kidney function all survived. As of February 2014 supporting research has not yet been published.|$|E
5|$|Prolonged convulsive epileptic {{seizures}} are {{a medical}} emergency that {{can usually be}} dealt with effectively by administering fast-acting benzodiazepines, which are potent anticonvulsants. In a hospital environment, <b>intravenous</b> clonazepam, lorazepam, and diazepam are first-line choices, clonazepam due to its stronger and more potent anticonvulsant action, diazepam due to its faster onset and lorazepam for its longer duration of action. In the community, <b>intravenous</b> administration is not practical and so rectal diazepam or (more recently) buccal midazolam are used, with a preference for midazolam as its administration is easier and more socially acceptable.|$|E
5|$|Pyelonephritis {{is treated}} more aggressively {{than a simple}} bladder {{infection}} using either a longer course of oral antibiotics or <b>intravenous</b> antibiotics. Seven days of the oral fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin is typically used {{in areas where the}} resistance rate is less than 10%. If the local resistance rates are greater than 10%, a dose of <b>intravenous</b> ceftriaxone is often prescribed. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or amoxicillin/clavulanate orally for 14 days is another reasonable option. In those who exhibit more severe symptoms, admission to a hospital for ongoing antibiotics may be needed. Complications such as urinary obstruction from a kidney stone may be considered if symptoms do not improve following two or three days of treatment.|$|E
5|$|Routes of {{infection}} include vertical transmission (such as through childbirth), early life horizontal transmission (bites, lesions, and sanitary habits), and adult horizontal transmission (sexual contact, <b>intravenous</b> drug use).|$|E
5|$|Spontaneous {{ventilation}} {{has been}} traditionally performed with an inhalational agent (i.e. gas induction or inhalational induction using halothane or sevoflurane) however {{it can also}} be performed using <b>intravenous</b> anaesthesia (e.g. propofol, ketamine or dexmedetomidine). SponTaneous Respiration using <b>IntraVEnous</b> anaesthesia and High-flow nasal oxygen (STRIVE Hi) is an open airway technique that uses an upwards titration of propofol which maintains ventilation at deep levels of anaesthesia. It has been used in airway surgery as an alternative to tracheal intubation.|$|E
5|$|The median {{lethal dose}} (LD50) of soluble {{palladium}} compounds in mice is 200mg/kg for oral and 5mg/kg for <b>intravenous</b> administration.|$|E
5|$|As {{an element}} with high {{electron}} density and atomic number, iodine absorbs X-rays weaker than 33.3keV {{due to the}} photoelectric effect of the innermost electrons. Organoiodine compounds are used with <b>intravenous</b> injection as X-ray radiocontrast agents. This application is often in conjunction with advanced X-ray techniques such as angiography and CT scanning. At present, all water-soluble radiocontrast agents rely on iodine.|$|E
5|$|Cerebral edema, if {{associated}} with coma, often necessitates admission to intensive care, artificial ventilation, and close observation. The administration of fluids is slowed. The ideal treatment of cerebral edema in DKA is not established, but <b>intravenous</b> mannitol and hypertonic saline (3%) are used—as {{in some other}} forms of cerebral edema—in an attempt to reduce the swelling.|$|E
5|$|Doxorubicin is photosensitive, and {{containers}} {{are often}} covered by an aluminum bag and/or brown wax paper to prevent light from affecting it. Doxorubicin {{is also available}} in liposome-encapsulated forms as Doxil (pegylated form), Myocet (nonpegylated form), and Caelyx, although these forms must also be given by <b>intravenous</b> injection.|$|E
5|$|During {{symptomatic}} attacks, {{administration of}} {{high doses of}} <b>intravenous</b> corticosteroids, such as methylprednisolone, is the usual therapy, with oral corticosteroids seeming to have a similar efficacy and safety profile. Although, in general, effective {{in the short term}} for relieving symptoms, corticosteroid treatments do not appear to {{have a significant impact on}} long-term recovery. The consequences of severe attacks that do not respond to corticosteroids might be treatable by plasmapheresis.|$|E
5|$|During the {{recovery}} phase <b>intravenous</b> fluids are discontinued {{to prevent a}} state of fluid overload. If fluid overload occurs and vital signs are stable, stopping further fluid may be all that is needed. If a person is outside of the critical phase, a loop diuretic such as furosemide {{may be used to}} eliminate excess fluid from the circulation.|$|E
5|$|Fluorine-18 {{is often}} found in {{radioactive}} tracers for positron emission tomography, as its half-life of almost two hours is long enough to allow for its transport from production facilities to imaging centers. The most common tracer is fluorodeoxyglucose which, after <b>intravenous</b> injection, is taken up by glucose-requiring tissues such as the brain and most malignant tumors; computer-assisted tomography can then be used for detailed imaging.|$|E
5|$|Gallium nitrate (brand name Ganite) {{has been}} used as an <b>intravenous</b> {{pharmaceutical}} to treat hypercalcemia associated with tumor metastasis to bones. Gallium is thought to interfere with osteoclast function, and the therapy may be effective when other treatments have failed.|$|E
5|$|Gene {{therapy is}} being studied in {{some types of}} epilepsy. Medications that alter immune function, such as <b>intravenous</b> immunoglobulins, are poorly {{supported}} by evidence. Noninvasive stereotactic radiosurgery is, as of 2012, being compared to standard surgery for certain types of epilepsy.|$|E
5|$|However, because <b>intravenous</b> {{linezolid}} may be {{switched to}} an oral formulation (tablets or oral solution) without jeopardizing efficacy, {{people may be}} discharged from hospital relatively early and continue treatment at home, whereas home treatment with injectable antibiotics may be impractical. Reducing the length of hospital stay reduces the overall cost of treatment, even though linezolid may have a higher acquisition cost—that is, {{it may be more}} expensive—than comparable antibiotics.|$|E
5|$|If {{the disease}} is {{associated}} with cancer, direct treatment of the cancer often relieves the symptoms of LEMS. Other treatments often used are steroids, azathioprine, which suppress the immune system, <b>intravenous</b> immunoglobulin, which outcompetes autoreactive antibody for Fc receptors, and pyridostigmine and 3,4-diaminopyridine, which enhance the neuromuscular transmission. Occasionally, plasma exchange is required to remove the antibodies.|$|E
5|$|In 1985 {{biochemist}} David Dolphin {{proposed a}} link between the rare blood disorder porphyria and vampire folklore. Noting that the condition is treated by <b>intravenous</b> haem, he suggested that the consumption of large amounts of blood may result in haem being transported somehow across the stomach wall and into the bloodstream. Thus vampires were merely sufferers of porphyria seeking to replace haem and alleviate their symptoms.|$|E
5|$|In TgPVR1 mice, the {{transgene}} encoding {{the human}} PVR {{was incorporated into}} mouse chromosome 4. These mice express {{the highest levels of}} the transgene and the highest sensitivity to poliovirus. TgPVR1 mice are susceptible to poliovirus through the intraspinal, intracerebral, intramuscular, and <b>intravenous</b> pathways, but not through the oral route.|$|E
5|$|In those {{receiving}} heparin {{through an}} <b>intravenous</b> infusion, {{a complex of}} symptoms ("systemic reaction") may occur when the infusion is started. These include fever, chills, high blood pressure, a fast heart rate, shortness of breath, and chest pain. This happens in {{about a quarter of}} people with HIT. Others may develop a skin rash consisting of red spots.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{measures}} can include rest, caffeine intake (via coffee or <b>intravenous</b> infusion), and hydration. Corticosteroids may provide transient relief for some patients. An abdominal binder — {{a type of}} garment that increases intracranial pressure by compressing the abdomen — can temporarily relieve symptoms for some people.|$|E
5|$|<b>Intravenous</b> hydration, if required, is {{typically}} only needed {{for one or}} two days. In children with shock due to dengue a rapid dose of 20mL/kg is reasonable. The rate of fluid administration is than titrated to a urinary output of 0.5–1mL/kg/h, stable vital signs and normalization of hematocrit. The smallest amount of fluid required to achieve this is recommended.|$|E
5|$|Mitoxantrone is an {{immunosuppressant}} {{also used}} in cancer chemotherapy which was approved for MS in the year 2000; whereas natalizumab is a monoclonal antibody that was initially approved in 2004. Both are given by <b>intravenous</b> infusion at monthly intervals {{in the case of}} natalizumab and every three months in the case of mitoxantrone.|$|E
5|$|Molybdenum {{deficiency}} {{has also}} been reported {{as a consequence of}} non-molybdenum supplemented total parenteral nutrition (complete <b>intravenous</b> feeding) for long periods of time. It results in high blood levels of sulfite and urate, {{in much the same way}} as molybdenum cofactor deficiency. However (presumably since pure molybdenum deficiency from this cause occurs primarily in adults), the neurological consequences are not as marked as in cases of congenital cofactor deficiency.|$|E
5|$|No {{definitive}} antidote for amatoxin poisoning is available, {{but some}} specific treatments such as <b>intravenous</b> penicillin G {{have been shown}} to improve survival. There is some evidence that <b>intravenous</b> silibinin, an extract from the blessed milk thistle (Silybum marianum), may be beneficial in reducing the effects of amatoxins, preventing their uptake by hepatocytes, thereby protecting undamaged hepatic tissue. In patients developing liver failure, a liver transplant is often the only option to prevent death. Liver transplants have become a well-established option in amatoxin poisoning. This is a complicated issue, however, as transplants themselves may have significant complications and mortality; patients require long-term immunosuppression to maintain the transplant. Evidence suggests that, although survival rates have improved with modern medical treatment, in patients with moderate to severe poisoning up to half of those who did recover suffered permanent liver damage. However, a follow-up study has shown that most survivors recover completely without any sequelae if treated within 36hours of mushroom ingestion.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{advantages}} of linezolid is its high bioavailability (close to 100%) when given by mouth: the entire dose reaches the bloodstream, {{as if it had been}} given intravenously. This means that people receiving <b>intravenous</b> linezolid may be switched to oral linezolid as soon as their condition allows it, whereas comparable antibiotics (such as vancomycin and quinupristin/dalfopristin) can only be given intravenously.|$|E
5|$|Resolution of DKA {{is defined}} as general {{improvement}} in the symptoms, {{such as the ability}} to tolerate oral nutrition and fluids, normalization of blood acidity (pH>7.3), and absence of ketones in blood (<1 mmol/l) or urine. Once this has been achieved, insulin may be switched to the usual subcutaneously administrered regimen, one hour after which the <b>intravenous</b> administration can be discontinued.|$|E
5|$|The {{main goal}} of {{treatment}} {{is to treat}} shock and preserve kidney function. Initially this is done through the administration of generous amounts of <b>intravenous</b> fluids, usually isotonic saline (0.9% weight per volume sodium chloride solution). In victims of crush syndrome, it is recommended to administer <b>intravenous</b> fluids even before they are extracted from collapsed structures. This will ensure sufficient circulating volume {{to deal with the}} muscle cell swelling (which typically commences when blood supply is restored), and to prevent the deposition of myoglobin in the kidneys. Amounts of 6 to 12liters over 24hours are recommended. The rate of fluid administration may be altered to achieve a high urine output (200–300ml/h in adults), unless there are other reasons why this might lead to complications, such as a history of heart failure.|$|E
5|$|The {{mainstay}} of treatment is {{large quantities of}} <b>intravenous</b> fluids. Other treatments may include dialysis or hemofiltration in more severe cases. Once urine output is established sodium bicarbonate and mannitol are commonly used but they are poorly supported by the evidence. Outcomes are generally good if treated early. Complications may include high blood potassium, low blood calcium, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and compartment syndrome.|$|E
5|$|The major {{criteria}} include {{liver disease}} with portal hypertension; kidney failure; {{the absence of}} shock, infection, recent treatment with medications that affect {{the function of the}} kidney (nephrotoxins), and fluid losses; the absence of sustained improvement in kidney function despite treatment with 1.5 litres of <b>intravenous</b> normal saline; the absence of proteinuria (protein in the urine); and, the absence of kidney disease or obstruction of kidney outflow as seen on ultrasound.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{treatment}} of gastroenteritis in {{both children and}} adults is rehydration. This is preferably achieved by drinking rehydration solution, although <b>intravenous</b> delivery may be required {{if there is a}} decreased level of consciousness or if dehydration is severe. Drinking replacement therapy products made with complex carbohydrates (i.e. those made from wheat or rice) may be superior to those based on simple sugars. Drinks especially high in simple sugars, such as soft drinks and fruit juices, are not recommended in children under 5 years of age as they may increase diarrhea. Plain water may be used if more specific ORT preparations are unavailable or the person is not willing to drink them. A nasogastric tube can be used in young children to administer fluids if warranted. In those who require <b>intravenous</b> fluids, one to four hours' worth is often sufficient.|$|E
5|$|The {{second most}} {{frequent}} mode of HIV transmission is via blood and blood products. Blood-borne transmission can be through needle-sharing during <b>intravenous</b> drug use, needle stick injury, transfusion of contaminated blood or blood product, or medical injections with unsterilized equipment. The risk from sharing a needle during drug injection is between 0.63 and 2.4% per act, {{with an average}} of 0.8%. The risk of acquiring HIV from a needle stick from an HIV-infected person is estimated as 0.3% (about 1 in 333) per act and the risk following mucous membrane exposure to infected blood as 0.09% (about 1 in 1000) per act. In the United States <b>intravenous</b> drug users made up 12% of all new cases of HIV in 2009, and in some areas more than 80% of people who inject drugs are HIV positive.|$|E
5|$|There {{is no good}} {{evidence}} aloe vera is of use in treating wounds or burns. There is no {{good evidence}} that topical application of aloe vera is effective for treating genital herpes or psoriasis. A 2014 Cochrane review found no strong evidence {{for the value of}} topical application of aloe vera to treat or prevent phlebitis caused by <b>intravenous</b> infusion.|$|E
