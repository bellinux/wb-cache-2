5|$|Biological {{control is}} a method of {{controlling}} pests such as insects, mites, weeds and plant diseases using other organisms. It relies on predation, parasitism, herbivory, or other natural mechanisms, but typically also involves an active human management role. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> important component of integrated pest management (IPM) programs.|$|E
5|$|The Cape sparrow is an {{abundant}} and familiar bird of human habitations and cultivation {{in most of}} southern Africa. It is not believed to be threatened, and accordingly is listed as a species of least concern on the IUCN's Red List. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> agricultural pest, especially of grain cultivation and vineyards.|$|E

5|$|Intensity of {{precipitation}} is primarily measured for meteorological concerns. However, {{it can be}} of concern to aviation as heavy precipitation can limit visibility. Also, intensity of freezing rain can determine how hazardous it is for pilots to fly nearby certain locations since <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> in-flight hazard by depositing ice {{on the wings of}} aircraft, which can be detrimental to flight.|$|E
5|$|With iOS 10.2.1, Apple made {{improvements}} to reduce occurrences of unexpected shutdowns {{that a small}} number of users were experiencing with their iPhone. iOS 10.2.1 already has over 50% of active iOS devices upgraded and the diagnostic data we've received from upgraders shows that for this small percentage of users experiencing the issue, we're seeing a more than 80% reduction in iPhone 6s and over 70% reduction on iPhone 6 of devices unexpectedly shutting down. We also added the ability for the phone to restart without needing to connect to power, if a user still encounters an unexpected shutdown. It {{is important to note that}} these unexpected shutdowns are not a safety issue, but we understand <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> inconvenience and wanted to fix the issue as quickly as possible. If a customer has any issues with their device they can contact AppleCare.|$|E
5|$|Entertainment {{is a form}} of {{activity}} that holds the attention and interest of an audience, or gives pleasure and delight. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> idea or a task, but {{is more likely to be}} one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry that records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.|$|E

25|$|The {{desert locust}} is {{potentially}} {{the most dangerous}} of the locust pests because of the ability of swarms to fly rapidly across great distances. It has two to five generations per year. The last major desert locust upsurge in 2004–05 caused significant crop losses in West Africa and had {{a negative impact on}} food security in the region. While the desert locust alone is not responsible for famines, <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> important contributing factor.|$|E
25|$|In goal {{modelling}} {{to fulfil}} Goal1, one must achieve to other goals: both Goal2 and Goal3 (goal-connector with “and” as the logical relation going out). If Goal2 and Goal3 {{are two different}} ways of achieving Goal1, then it should be “xor” logical relationship. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> opposite situation when both Goal2 and Goal3 need to be fulfilled and to achieve them one must fulfil Goal1. In this case Goal2 and Goal3 are linked to goal connector and this goal connector has a link to Goal1 with ”and”-logical relationship.|$|E

25|$|A {{tradable}} credit {{can be an}} emissions allowance or an {{assigned amount}} unit which was originally allocated or auctioned by the national administrators of a Kyoto-compliant cap-and-trade scheme, or <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> offset of emissions. Such offsetting and mitigating activities can occur in any developing country which has ratified the Kyoto Protocol, and has a national agreement in place to validate its carbon project {{through one of the}} UNFCCC's approved mechanisms. Once approved, these units are termed Certified Emission Reductions, or CERs. The Protocol allows these projects to be constructed and credited in advance of the Kyoto trading period.|$|E
25|$|The proof above for {{the square}} root of two can be {{generalized}} using the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. This asserts that every integer {{has a unique}} factorization into primes. Using it we can show that if a rational number is not an integer then no integral power of <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> integer, as in lowest terms {{there must be a}} prime in the denominator that does not divide into the numerator whatever power each is raised to. Therefore, if an integer is not an exact kth power of another integer then its kth root is irrational.|$|E
25|$|Female {{choice is}} the final step in the males attempt to reproduce; if the female does not find the male’s traits desirable, {{reproduction}} will not be successful. As it is in most species, body size is an important and most common desired trait amongst females. Body size is indicative of fitness and/or genetic quality; {{and because it is}} easily observable, <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> indicator for how a female will pick her mate. A larger body size positively correlates to higher paternity; thus larger males are more successful in siring more offspring than smaller males. Male salamanders also prefer larger females because they produce more ova than smaller females.|$|E
