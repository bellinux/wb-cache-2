40|$|Flip chip or {{wire bonding}} on highly {{sensitive}} low-k and ultra-low-k (ULK) BEoL-structures {{is an important}} issue concerning the thermo-mechanical integrity. To assess the thermo-mechanical stress situation in BEoL structures under the loading conditions of wire bonding and pull testing using Finite-element-analyses (FEA), a suitable approach is necessary. In particular, the phenomenon of friction at the bonding surfaces, the heat sources of friction and shock and vibrations have to be considered.

Copper instead of Gold wire bonding is introducing much higher mechanical impact to underlying Back-end of line (BeoL) structures and actives like low-k and ultra low-k materials for (BEoL) layers of advanced CMOS technologies because of the higher stiffness and lower ductility of Copper compared to Gold.

40|$|Much of {{the cost}} of {{manufacturing}} pixel detectors is due to bumping and <b>flip</b> <b>chip</b> assembly of the readout chips onto sensor tiles, even if it is done on wafer level. To address this issue, Fraunhofer IZM investigated two new technological approaches, namely screen printing using dry film resist and chip-to-wafer assembly. In the first approach, solder bumps with diameters of 80 and 25 m in pitches of 110 and 60 m, respectively, were produced by screen-printing solder paste using a photo-structured dry film resist. Results indicated that the technology is a viable high yield and low cost bumping process. The second approach was developed to decrease the number of manual handling steps in pixel module manufacturing, which is critical for reducing processing time and cost. Here, chip designs on 200 mm readout chip (ROC) wafers and 150 mm sensor wafers were especially adapted for chip-to-wafer assembly and to ensure that the interconnection yield and reliability could be te sted.

40|$|For future earth {{observation}} and planetary exploration missions (e. g. STEAMR, MetOp, GEOSOUNDER, SWI, FIRE, GEOSTAR), high performance room-temperature heterodyne receivers in the 50 GHz to 1. 5 THz frequency range are needed. For frequencies up to 300 GHz, GaAs and InP HEMT technology has today become competitive, offering high sensitivity {{along with all}} the benefits of traditional MMIC designs, e. g. multifunctional chips and high repeatability. For frequencies let say above 300 GHz, GaAs Schottky diode technology can offer an unprecedented noise performance along with the versatility of working both as a source and detector. The long track record and high reliability of Schottky diode receiver technology makes it the natural choice for high-performance room-temperature space instrumentation operating in the THz range. To fully benefit from the performance that Schottky diode technology can offer, monolithically integrated circuit (MIC) membrane technology [1 - 3] is necessary. By monolithic integration of THz Schottky diodes on ultrathin substrates and using freestanding metal beam leads, low loss transmission line structures suitable for waveguide integration assembly (waveguide probes, DC and RF interconnects etc.) become possible. Terahertz Membrane Integrated Circuits (TMIC’s) have proven to operate well up to several THz overcoming many of the problems and limitations associated with hybrid technology (using discrete <b>flip</b> <b>chip</b> <b>mounted</b> diodes).

40|$|Introduction The ease of {{integration}} into everyday objects {{and the higher}} mechanical robustness are the fundamental advantages miniaturized wireless sensors. The development of these embedded micro systems has to consider the interdependence of design decisions regarding network communication, wireless sensor hardware and fabrication technology. A design environment was implemented to support the functional and physical design of miniaturized wireless sensor nodes. Design for Miniaturized Wireless Sensor Nodes Conventional methodologies structure the design process into a fixed sequence of design steps. The design steps for miniaturized wireless sensor nodes include the partitioning of: - distributed / local algorithms, - analog / digital hardware, - component / package elements, - planar 2 D- / spatial 3 D-interconnects. These design decisions are highly correlated {{in the case of}} high miniaturization degrees. The resulting higher number of design iterations is more efficiently managed by a flexible model based design. The approach of our design methodology for miniaturization is a parallel analysis of the functional miniaturization and physical miniaturization based on geometry models for size estimations. Functional Miniaturization The target of the functional miniaturization analysis is the selection and parameterization of the sensor node architecture, resulting in a minimal volume of the total component set. The miniaturization barrier for a given architecture depends significantly on the volume elements like batteries and crystals. The dimensions of bulky elements can often be influenced by a reduction of functional component requirements. The optimal solution is application specific especially regarding the calibration and cooperation strategies. For the consideration of relevant design issues, the self-sufficient wireless sensor nodes are divided into the four subsystems communication interface, ambient interface, digital back-end, and energy supply. Physical Miniaturization The physical miniaturization analysis examines the miniaturization barrier for a given component set according to selected interconnection and substrate technologies. The components are allocated on certain vertical layers and the required wiring density is calculated from the corresponding net list. For the first iterations, a coarse partitioning is sufficient for derivation of the optimization focus. Later on, placement and routing is required on different refinement levels accomplished by signal integrity examinations and thermal simulation steps. The introduction of the concrete implementation details is preceded by design relevant packaging issues. This ranges from the selection substrate technologies and chip interconnection technologies to alternative 3 D module integration processes. Implemented Prototypes Prototypes of wireless sensor nodes were implemented to verify the design approach. Several miniaturization steps with different 3 D system integration technologies were realized. Starting from modules of 2. 6 cm edge length in conventional SMD technology, the first step in miniaturization has shrunken the wireless sensor system to 2 cm per side. At this size, the modules were realized with bare dies by <b>flip</b> <b>chip</b> <b>mounting.</b> Later on, prototypes of 1 cubic centimeter were developed, based on a folded flexible substrate. Finally, flip chips on both substrate sides allowed folded modules of only 6 mm edge length. Bibliografie (< 1000) Michael Niedermayer received the M. S. degree in Electrical Energineering from the Technical University of Berlin in 1999 and the MBA degree from the College of Technology and Economy of Berlin (FHTW) in 1999. Afterwards he worked as research engineer engineer in the field of MEMS relays for Siemens and Tyco Electronics. In 2002, he joined the Fraunhofer Institute for Reliability and Microintegration as research manager. His research interests are design methodologies, packaging technologies and miniaturized wireless sensor systems Short Description (< 2000) Visions like Pervasive Computing and Ambient Intelligence expect in the future that many daily items be linked by wireless communication. Tiny self-sufficient wireless sensor nodes, also discussed under the names of Smart Dust and eGrain, will contribute to the interconnection of diverse objects. Applications like access control, catastrophe management, technical inspections, and monitoring of environmental conditions will take advantage of the small size and high mechanical robustness. While wireless sensor systems of several cubic centimeters have reached the stage of mass production e. g. for tire pressure monitoring, devices of some millimeters per side are still the subject of research projects. The development of miniaturized sensor nodes is very challenging due to the close interdependence of design decisions regarding communication protocol, hardware component selection, and integration technology choice. Hence, new efficient design methodologies are required which extend the design procedures for embedded systems with miniaturization options for packaging technologies. A design environment was implemented to support the functional and physical design of miniaturized wireless sensor nodes. The quantification of the functional component requirements as well as the derivation of appropriate packaging technologies is based on an event driven behavior simulator and a 3 D placement tool. The functional and physical design decisions are synchronized by the volume estimations of the individual components and the update of the model parameters by the actualized geometry model. Depending on the volume fractions the development focus is set accordingly. Prototypes were implemented to verify the design methodology. Several wireless sensor node architectures were realized by different 3 D packaging technologies. The miniaturized prototypes have reached a size of 1 cm down to 0. 6 cm edge length...|$|E

Currently, leaded <b>flip</b> <b>chip</b> interconnects are allowed under an exemption in the RoHS directive due to a perceived lack of a technically viable solution. Recently, a number of Pb-Free <b>flip</b> <b>chip</b> interconnects have been introduced to the industry and have been in high volume production for a few years. Electromigration is an area which has received quite a bit of attention over the years. There is a large body of data in the area of High-Pb and Sn/Pb eutectic <b>flip</b> <b>chip</b> interconnect systems, but there is still a relatively small database with regard to Pb-Free <b>flip</b> <b>chip</b> interconnects. This paper addresses relative electromigration performance on different base surface finishes of organic laminates, {{which is one of the}} key aspects where additional knowledge is needed to understand the proper implementation direction for Pb-Free <b>flip</b> <b>chip</b> interconnects. The impact of ENIG, ENEPIG, and bare Cu on Sn/Ag bump electromigration including FA results is presented. I...|$|R
