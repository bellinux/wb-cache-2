40|$|First {{language}} acquisition requires relatively little effort compared to <b>foreign</b> <b>language</b> acquisition and happens more naturally through informal learning.

Here we tested the impact of exposure to <b>foreign</b> <b>language</b> words presented with pictures in an incidental learning phase on subsequent explicit <b>foreign</b> <b>language</b> learning. In the explicit learning phase, we asked adults to learn translation equivalents of <b>foreign</b> <b>language</b> words, some of which had appeared in the incidental learning phase.
