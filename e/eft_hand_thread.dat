25|$|This {{configuration}} {{consists of}} a left crank arm with a spider and chainring, and a right crank arm without a spider, the opposite of a normal configuration. If used with a screw-on freewheel, a special hub with a left <b>hand</b> <b>thread</b> for a special freewheel must be used , which is also <b>threaded</b> left <b>hand</b> and ratchets {{the opposite direction of}} a normal freewheel.

50|$|The {{barrel length}} of the Iraqi Tabuk rifle is 23.6 inches - {{slightly}} longer and thinner than a Yugoslavian M72 barrel, but much longer than a traditional AKM or the M70 (16.25 inches). The Tabuk, like the M72, has a provision for muzzle attachments in the typical Russian thread pattern of 14×1mm left <b>hand</b> <b>thread,</b> which means that it can accept several variations of Soviet flash hiders and muzzle brakes, as well as Soviet-designed sound suppression devices.|$|R
50|$|The American Standard Safety System, or ASSS, is a {{connection}} system for gas cylinders with a volume exceeding 25 cubic feet. The connections differ in thread type and size, right and left <b>handed</b> <b>threading,</b> internal and external threading, and nipple-seat design. This variability {{reduces the risk of}} errors such as administering the wrong gas to a patient, or utilizing equipment calibrated for one gas with another. However, as there are only 26 connections for the 62 gases and mixtures recognized by the CGA, connections are not unique.|$|R
40|$|When {{comparing}} OpenMP {{to other}} parallel programming models, {{it is easier}} to choose between OpenMP and MPI than between OpenMP and POSIX Threads (Pthreads). With languages like C and C++, developers frequently have chosen Pthreads to incorporate parallelism in applications. Few developers are currently using OpenMP C/C++, but they should. We show that converting Genehunter, a <b>hand</b> <b>threaded</b> C program, to OpenMP increases robustness without sacrificing performance. It is also a good case study as it highlights several issues that are important in understanding how OpenMP uses threads...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} project {{was conducted to}} increase weld gap tolerance in Friction Stir Welding (FSW) of 8 mm thick aluminum alloy 6082 – T 6. Investigation was done on I-STIR PDS platform and a Johnford milling machine. The {{research project}} involved tool-pin design with varying re-entrant features and varying parameters {{as a method of}} weld gap closing to produce successful welds. Direction of spindle rotation and dwell time were established as part of a preliminary study. Clockwise spindle rotation with 20 seconds dwell time allows sufficient plasticity and improved material flow which assisted in achieving welds with prior 30 percent weld gap of the plate thickness. Final welds were made using three rotational speeds and feed rates with sufficient plunging to prevent root defects. Analysis of the results were detailed which include vickers microhardness test, tensile test and metallographic observation to access the suitability of the weld structure. From the set of tool-pins designed, the flare tool-pin gave a well-defined weld nugget with improved stirring at the weld root. Also, with a concave shoulder, right <b>hand</b> <b>threaded</b> tool-pin and counterclockwise flutes undergoing a clockwise spindle rotation, plasticized material flow was upward which was beneficial in reducing the amount of plate thinning. The right <b>hand</b> <b>thread</b> counter clockwise flute with a flute machined in the foot exhibited superior tensile strength for welds containing 30 percent weld gap...|$|R
50|$|Sometimes {{preceded by}} an arm wrench, the wrestler grasps the opponent's hand and twists backwards, placing {{pressure}} on the wrist. While this can inflict pain on its own, it is most often used as a transition hold, leading into either a hammer lock, an elbow to the held arm, or kicks to the opponent's abdominal area. Another form of wrist lock sometimes known as a figure four wristlock involves the wrestler (after applying the initial wrist lock with the left <b>hand)</b> <b>threading</b> their right arm through the gap the two arms provide, forming a 4, and providing leverage on the wristlock.|$|R

5000|$|The {{design of}} the hub has three main {{elements}} - a splined hub to locate the wheel and two mating cones, one at the inner end which centres the wheel and the other at the nut end. These cones transmit {{the majority of the}} torque to the wheel freeing the splines of much of the load. One of the key features of the Pugh design is that it is self tightening. The wheels {{on the right side of}} the car have a left <b>hand</b> <b>thread</b> on the nut and vice versa. If the wheel becomes loose the tendency is for the locking nut to tighten and hold the wheel securely.|$|R

50|$|If a track hub is not available, or if a {{beginner}} wishes {{to try a}} fixed gear bicycle without buying a new hub or rear wheel, track cogs can be installed on a standard Freewheel hub using a right <b>hand</b> <b>threaded</b> ISO English bottom bracket lockring as the lockring for the cog (the threads are exactly the same). This may work for some lighter, or delicate riders, but any repeated reverse or braking pressure on the pedals will eventually cause the cog and lockring to come loose. It is recommended that anyone using a freewheel hub with a track cog in this manner do so with caution and with both front and rear brakes mounted to the bicycle.|$|R
5000|$|Left {{side drive}} {{introduced}} {{a different type}} of flip flop hub for BMX. This hub is a Right Hand/Left Hand flip flop hub. One side of the hub allows the use of normal right hand freewheels, while the other side is <b>threaded</b> with left <b>hand</b> <b>threads</b> (1.375" [...] x 24L tpi) and accepts the new left hand drive freewheels. The first/most common was the ACS South Paw Claw model, available in 16T. Later, a version of this hub was made with small metric BMX (30 mm x 1 mm) <b>threads,</b> left <b>hand</b> on one side and right hand on the other side. These hubs accepted either Left or right side drive freewheels in the smaller 13T-15T sizes.|$|R

50|$|The buckle or a coupler is a {{mechanical}} joint used to connect two members which {{are subjected to}} tensile loading which require slight adjustment of length or tension under loaded conditions. It consist of central hexagonal nut called coupler and tie rod having right hand and left <b>hand</b> <b>threads.</b> A coupler of hexagonal shape is to facilitate the turning of it with a spanner or sometime a hole is provide in the nut so that tommy bar can be inserted for rotating it.

5000|$|The smaller {{diameter}} thread on {{the fixed}} side has reverse/left <b>hand</b> <b>threads</b> {{to accept a}} lockring. The lockring is reverse threaded to prevent the cog from coming loose when applying reverse/braking power to the pedals. There are also different sized threads for the left hand lockring (English/ISO 1.29" [...] x 24 TPI), Campagnolo/Phil Wood (1.32" [...] x 24 TPI) and Old French (33 mm x 1.0 mm). The first two are the most common, with the French threading being older, and a little less common. It is advisable to check with the manufacturer of the hub for lock ring compatibility. Wrong thread type lockrings may easily thread onto the wrong hub, but over time, the poorly-mating thread interface will cause the threads on the hub to become damaged or destroyed.|$|R
2500|$|In response, HK {{developed}} the USP Tactical pistol {{based on the}} original USP; USP Tactical and MK 23 look similar indeed being a different pistols by design and purpose, the Tactical retains much {{of the performance of}} the MK 23 without the bulky size. It uses a different suppressor (due to 16 X 1mm left <b>handed</b> <b>threading,</b> as opposed to 16 X 1mm right-handed on the MK 23). An even more compact pistol than the USP Tactical for counter-terrorist and special forces use is the HK USP Compact Tactical, which has its own optional LAM. The USP-CT is lighter and is [...] capable of fitting a suppressor, making it a prime choice for Special Forces on covert operations. Recently, HK has {{developed the}} HK 45, a much more contoured pistol based on the P2000, P8 and P30 models.|$|R
40|$|This study quantifies {{the effect}} of a {{simultaneous}} grip on wrist strength. It was hypothesized that wrist flexion strength increases with an increasing grip and wrist extension strength decreases with an increasing grip. Twelve subjects performed maximum wrist flexion and extension exertions with a different level of simultaneous grip – minimum, preferred, and maximum. Wrist flexion strength increased 34 % and wrist extension strength decreased 10 % from minimum to maximum grip. This shows that measure of wrist strength for assessing strength capabilities or the efficacy of hand surgeries or rehabilitation programs requires control of finger flexor activities to ensure consistent and relevant results. When opening a bottle in an outward direction (right <b>hand</b> <b>thread),</b> wrist extension strength may be significantly limited by a simultaneous grip due to muscle antagonism. When twisting a fragile or uncomfortable object, reduced finger flexor activities can limit wrist flexion strength...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Thread {{management}} {{is an essential}} functionality in OS kernels. However, verification of thread management remains a challenge, due to two conflicting requirements: on the one <b>hand,</b> a <b>thread</b> manager—operating below the thread abstraction layer–should hide its implementation details and be verified independently from the threads being managed; on the other <b>hand,</b> the <b>thread</b> management code in many real-world systems is concurrent, which might be executed by the threads being managed, so it seems inappropriate to abstract threads away in the verification of thread managers. Previous approaches on kernel verification view thread managers as sequential code, thus {{cannot be applied to}} thread management in realistic kernels. In this paper, we propose a novel two-layer framework to verify concurrent thread management. We choose a lower abstraction level than the previous approaches, where we abstract away the context switch routine only, and allow the rest of the thread management code to run concurrently in the upper level. We also treat thread management data as abstract resources so that threads in the environment can be specified in assertions and be reasoned about in a proof system similar to concurrent separation logic. ...|$|R

5000|$|Not all {{stationary}} {{wire tying}} balers used 2 wires. It {{was not uncommon}} for the larger bale size (usually 17" [...] x 22") machines to use 'boards' that had three slots for wires and hence tied three wires per bale. Most North American manufacturers produced these machines as either regular models or as size options. 'Small square' three wire tying pick-up balers were available from the early 1930s, principally from J. I. Case & Co. and Ann Arbor. These machines were hand tying and <b>hand</b> <b>threading</b> machines. Although New Holland credits itself with inventing the 'successful small square twine tying baler', it produced such machines {{for the first time}} in 1940 after acquiring Ed Nolte and his baler. This baler baled successfully from 1937 onwards. Certainly the quality of the New Holland machines, popularised twine tying hay balers. In Europe, in as early as 1939, both Claas of Germany and Rousseau SA of France had automatic twine tying pick-up balers. Most of these produced low density bales though. The first successful pick-up balers were made by the Ann Arbor Company in 1929. Ann Arbor were acquired by the Oliver Farm Equipment Company in 1943. Despite their head start on the rest of the field, no Ann Arbor balers carried automatic knotters or twisters. Oliver introduced these in 1949.|$|R

50|$|Manifolds {{intended}} for use with sets where a regulator is provided for each cylinder {{are connected to the}} cylinder valves upstream of the cylinder valve seat, to a connecting port provided specifically for this purpose. Two styles of connection are available for this arrangement - face seal, and barrel seal. Face seal connections are similar to the DIN regulator connection seal, and consist of an o-ring in a groove machined into the end of the manifold tube, which is clamped against the face of the valve port by a threaded component. Face seals are simple and rugged, but rely on tight connection for a reliable seal, and do not allow any adjustment for cylinder centre distance. Barrel seals use one or two O-rings in grooves around the end of the manifold tube, which seal against the bore of the valve port. They are usually screwed into the valve port with <b>handed</b> <b>thread,</b> and locked with a lock-nut. They are generally slightly less rugged than face seal manifolds, and more vulnerable to thread damage during assembly, but allow a small amount of cylinder centre distance adjustment, and provide a reliable seal even if not completely tight. Manifolds of this type are commonly supplied in sets comprising a manifold and compatible left and right side cylinder valves with a choice of neck thread specification. The working components for all three valves in the set are usually identical.|$|R
