5000|$|Design of the Train of Tomorrow {{began in}} 1944, as a {{collaboration}} between General Motors (GM) and Pullman-Standard. According to author Brian Solomon, the train [...] "was strictly intended as an innovation showcase, and...the automotive manufacturer {{had no interest in}} building its own passenger trains." [...] According to a contemporary Life magazine article, its development cost approximately $1.5 million. GM had no less than five of its divisions involved with the train: the Electro-Motive Division (EMD) built its E7A locomotive, the Detroit Diesel Division and the Delco Products Division collaborated on the train's generating equipment, the Frigidaire Division built its air conditioning system, the Hyatt Bearings Division built its anti-friction, <b>journal-box</b> bearings, and GM's Styling Division concentrated on its interior design. GM did not, however, foray into the field of building passenger railroad cars, until its introduction of the Aerotrain a decade later.|$|E
