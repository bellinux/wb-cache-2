5|$|After Tatum {{resigned}} to coach {{at his own}} alma mater, North Carolina, Tommy Mont was appointed as his replacement. In his first season, Maryland was riddled with injuries and posted a disappointing 2–7–1 record. Mont had <b>great</b> <b>difficulty</b> recruiting to the same standard that his predecessor had, but managed to secure Rod Breedlove, a highly touted guard prospect. Breedlove later went on to play {{eight years in the}} NFL and made a Pro Bowl appearance.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} asset are the Storm's narrow dimensions, {{which allow}} it to traverse the narrow alleyways common to the casbahs of many Middle Eastern cities, places that armoured Humvees can only enter with <b>great</b> <b>difficulty</b> and minimal manoeuvrability, if at all. Full-height rear doors which allow for the quick deployment of fully equipped troops into combat are touted as another advantage over similar vehicles.|$|E
5|$|Frigatebirds {{remain in}} the air and do not settle on the ocean. They produce very little oil from their uropygial glands so their {{feathers}} would become sodden if they settled on the surface. In addition, with their long wings relative to body size, they would have <b>great</b> <b>difficulty</b> taking off again.|$|E

5|$|On {{the north}} side of the roadway was the Malian Gulf, into which the land shelved gently.

5|$|The III Panzer Corps {{met with}} stiff {{resistance}} {{as well and}} had <b>great</b> <b>difficulty</b> creating and maintaining a bridgehead across the Northern Donets River.

5|$|The Komnenian era {{was born}} out of a period of <b>great</b> <b>difficulty</b> and strife for the Byzantine Empire. Following a period of {{relative}} success and expansion under the Macedonian dynasty (c. 867–c. 1054), Byzantium experienced several decades of stagnation and decline, which culminated in a vast deterioration in the military, territorial, economic and political situation of the Byzantine Empire by the accession of Alexios I Komnenos in 1081.|$|E

5|$|The priests {{began their}} missionary work, but {{encountered}} suspicion from most chiefs.

But, the group were favorably received by the high chief Boki, the royal governor of Oahu, and his wife Kuini Liliha. (The couple were Catholic converts and rivals of Queen Kaʻahumanu.) Boki welcomed the party and gave its members permission to stay.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{her years}} of service, {{she had never}} {{received}} a regular salary and was for years denied compensation. Her unofficial status and the unequal payments offered to black soldiers caused <b>great</b> <b>difficulty</b> in documenting her service, and the U.S. government was slow in recognizing its debt to her. Tubman did not receive a pension for her service in the Civil War until 1899. Her constant humanitarian work for her family and former slaves, meanwhile, kept her {{in a state of}} constant poverty, and her difficulties in obtaining a government pension were especially taxing for her.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year, Muhammad {{organized}} {{an attack against}} northern Arabia because of their previous defeat at the Battle of Mu'tah and reports of hostility adopted against Muslims.

Although Muhammad did not engage with hostile forces at Tabuk, he received the submission of some local chiefs of the region.|$|E

5|$|Iridium's modulus of {{elasticity}} is {{the second-highest}} among the metals, only being surpassed by osmium. This, together with a high shear modulus and a very low figure for Poisson's ratio (the relationship of longitudinal to lateral strain), indicate {{the high degree of}} stiffness and resistance to deformation that have rendered its fabrication into useful components a matter of <b>great</b> <b>difficulty.</b> Despite these limitations and iridium's high cost, a number of applications have developed where mechanical strength is an essential factor in some of the extremely severe conditions encountered in modern technology.|$|E
5|$|Khmer dialects, {{although}} mutually intelligible, {{are sometimes}} quite marked. Notable variations {{are found in}} speakers from Phnom Penh (Cambodia's capital city), the rural Battambang area, the areas of Northeast Thailand adjacent to Cambodia such as Surin province, the Cardamom Mountains, and southern Vietnam. The dialects form a continuum running roughly north to south. Standard Cambodian Khmer is mutually intelligible with the others but a Khmer Krom speaker from Vietnam, for instance, may have <b>great</b> <b>difficulty</b> communicating with a Khmer native of Sisaket Province in Thailand.|$|E

However half the assault troops experienced seasickness, problems were encountered with clearing the sand bar at the entrance to Guasopa Harbor, and Barbey's decision to land at night and withdraw before dawn in order to avoid encountering Japanese aircraft highlighted the inexperience of his crews and deficiencies in their training. Unloading activities on the coral-fringed Kiriwina dragged on for a fortnight.|$|E
5|$|Supplies for {{the advance}} were transported over land and by sea {{but it was}} only with <b>great</b> <b>difficulty</b> that two {{infantry}} divisions of XXI Corps and three mounted divisions of Desert Mounted Corps were maintained in the advance at such distances from base. The Navy transported stores to the mouths of the Wadi Hesi and the Nahr Sukherier as these lines were secured. The railhead was being pushed forward as rapidly as possible, but did not reach Deir Suneid until 28 November.
