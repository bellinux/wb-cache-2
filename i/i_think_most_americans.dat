"I dare say, Miss Eve, {{that your}} gentle nature was {{disposed}} to judge him as kindly as possible; and, then, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>most</b> <b>Americans,</b> {{ever since the}} treaty of Ghent, have been disposed to view all Russians too favourably. No, no; I am satisfied with {{the account of the}} English; they live much nearer to St. Petersburg than we do, and they are more accustomed, too, to give accounts of such matters." ...|$|E
5000|$|Althouse {{has said}} that she is pro-choice and opposes overruling Roe v. Wade, but {{has said that}} she [...] "does in fact think {{abortion}} is wrong. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>most</b> <b>Americans</b> agree with me and think it's wrong, but not {{the role of government}} to police." ...|$|E
5000|$|In an August 2008 interview, Carter accused Republican {{presidential nominee}} John McCain of [...] "milking every {{possible}} drop of advantage" [...] in mentioning {{his status as}} a prisoner of war during the Vietnam War. McCain responded to Carter's comments during an appearance on Fox News: [...] "I have great respect for former president Carter, but it's not first time we have disagreed. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>most</b> <b>Americans</b> share that view. In fact, most of my supporters say talk more about your experiences, they were formative experiences." ...|$|R
5000|$|Vice President Dick Cheney {{weighed in}} on the Wright matter on April 10, 2008. He {{appeared}} on Sean Hannity's radio show and said, [...] "I thought {{some of the things}} he said were absolutely appalling... I haven't gotten into the business of trying to judge how Sen. Obama dealt with it, or didn't deal with it, but <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> like <b>most</b> <b>Americans,</b> <b>I</b> was stunned at what the reverend was preaching in his church and then putting up on his Web site." ...|$|R
5000|$|Shimkus {{has been}} a proponent of {{legislation}} to increase {{the ability of the}} Food and Drug Administration to institute recalls of tainted foods. He has served as one of the chief Republican negotiators on the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act, which was recently passed by the U.S. House of Representatives. Of the bill, he said: [...] "When you're talking about {{the health and safety of}} folks, if the FDA has enough evidence to make a declaration of recall, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>most</b> <b>Americans</b> would support the government having that authority." ...|$|R
5000|$|Eastwood had {{declared}} in that interview, [...] "I’m not {{on either side}} of the aisle. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>most</b> <b>Americans</b> are going, What the ... ?

5000|$|An initial {{objection}} of Republicans in the Senate {{was that}} proposing {{to pay for}} the services by raising the federal tax on cigarettes, from 24 cents a pack to 67 cents a pack, ignored the likely consequence that sale of tobacco products would decrease and tax revenues would increasingly fall short of those needed {{to pay for the}} expansion of benefits. [...] Kennedy and Hatch scoffed at the objection, with the former saying, [...] "If we can keep people healthy and stop them from dying, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>most</b> <b>Americans</b> would say 'Amen; isn't that a great result?' If fewer people smoke, states will save far more in lower health costs than they will lose in revenues from the cigarette tax." [...] Republicans also criticized the bill as an open-ended entitlement program, although it was structured as a block grant rather than an entitlement; Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott was an early opponent of the measure, calling it a [...] "big-government program" [...] that would not pass.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{represents}} an extraordinary {{review of literature}} on the association between SES and mental illness. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>most</b> social scientists would find it impressive.
