500|$|Konietzko took a new {{approach}} for Tohuvabohu, released in 2007. [...] "Principally in the past, {{there used to be}} 2 people that would start songs: me and Jules. On this record <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other 2 guys, Andy (Selway) and Steve (White), 'Why don't you guys come up with something?'" [...] Tohuvabohu was on Billboards Dance/Electronic Albums Chart for just three weeks and peaked at No.4. It appeared on the Independent Albums Chart for one week at No.29. [...] Tohuvabohu also had a companion, Brimborium, a full length remix album released in 2008 that barely made it onto Billboards Dance/Electronic Albums Chart, hitting No.20 for a single week.|$|E
500|$|Veteran {{video game}} cover {{illustrator}} Marc Ericksen painted the North American box art, which included Mega Man firing a pistol {{instead of his}} trademark Mega Buster. Ericksen explained, [...] "I didn't know anything about Mega Man, and [...] <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> art director, 'What is he shooting with?' ... He said, 'Well, he must have a pistol, because I don't see a rifle.' ... I said, 'So, a pistol? Do {{you want me to}} do a pistol?' And he said, 'Yeah, let's put a pistol in there.' So I did what I was told and I put the pistol in there. Add to the fact that they only had, like, a day and a half for me to do the painting and what you wound up with was not the greatest result. But certainly a result that was not my fault. I mean, they told me to put the pistol in his hand!" ...|$|E
500|$|Two {{days after}} the sinking, on 11 February, U.S. President George W. Bush apologized for the {{accident}} on national television, stating, [...] "I want to reiterate what <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> prime minister of Japan: [...] I'm deeply sorry about the accident that took place; our nation is sorry." [...] Secretary of State Colin Powell and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld also publicly apologized. [...] The U.S. ambassador to Japan, Tom Foley, personally apologized to both Prime Minister Mori and to the Emperor of Japan. The public apologies to the Japanese from the highest American officials stirred resentment among some American veterans of the Pacific War and their families, as well as among Asian victims of Imperial Japanese aggression and occupation. Richard Cohen wrote a column in the Washington Post, saying [...] "We've Apologized Enough to Japan", denounced the [...] "hypocrisy" [...] of Japan's recent gestures of compensation and remorse to some of its World War II victims, which he said were offered [...] "grudgingly", while noting that the U.S. had apologized profusely over the accidental collision.|$|E

500|$|On 27 December, French sources {{revealed}} that Manchester United {{was interested in}} signing Evra. Despite rumours of Monaco reaching a transfer agreement with Internazionale, on 3 January 2006, Evra revealed he preferred to move to England to join Manchester United. The following day, Manchester United officially issued a transfer bid for the player. On 6 January, United manager Sir Alex Ferguson confirmed a deal for Evra was reached. Four days later, the transfer was official as Evra joined the club for a transfer fee of around £5.5million and signed a three-and-a-half-year contract. Evra's arrival signalled Ferguson's intention {{to shore up the}} club's defence that had suffered since the sidelining of Gabriel Heinze. After joining the club, Evra affirmed that Manchester was his only future destination: [...] "I was not very keen to go forward in the talks with Arsenal, Liverpool or Real Madrid. They all talked with my agent in the past two seasons. But to me, it was over. As <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Monaco officials, I only wanted to hear about Manchester." ...|$|E
500|$|A few {{innovative}} commercial directors immediately saw {{the ways}} in which sound could be employed {{as an integral part of}} cinematic storytelling, beyond the obvious function of recording speech. In Blackmail, Hitchcock manipulated the reproduction of a character's monologue so the word [...] "knife" [...] would leap out from a blurry stream of sound, reflecting the subjective impression of the protagonist, who is desperate to conceal her involvement in a fatal stabbing. In his first film, the Paramount Applause (1929), Rouben Mamoulian created the illusion of acoustic depth by varying the volume of ambient sound in proportion to the distance of shots. At a certain point, Mamoulian wanted the audience to hear one character singing at the same time as another prays; according to the director, [...] "They said we couldn't record the two things—the song and the prayer—on one mike and one channel. So <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sound man, 'Why not use two mikes and two channels and combine the two tracks in printing?'" [...] Such methods would eventually become standard procedure in popular filmmaking.|$|E
500|$|In January 2007, it was {{reported}} that May and England defender Glen Johnson were caught at a B store in Dartford, Kent, attempting to steal bathroom fittings. They both received £80 fines. Johnson described the incident as [...] "comical" [...] because it was a misunderstanding — [...] "Ben was doing up his bathroom so we went to B and found one of those sets where you get everything in one box. But he wanted a seat with a slow-close lid, so we took out the seat and put in another one. What we didn't know was that the new seat was £2.35 more expensive. We went through the till, paid for it and then the security guard stopped us and said he had been watching on CCTV. We just burst out laughing. Where's Jeremy Beadle then? But he said, 'No, this is serious, the police are on their way.' The police turned up and they were laughing. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> security guard, 'Can we not just pay the £2.35?'" [...] He said, 'No, this is a serious offence.' So the police gave us two options: go to court and fight it out, or pay an on-the-spot fine. We couldn't be bothered going to court so we paid the fine but doing that made us look guilty".|$|E

500|$|That {{was one of}} {{the first}} words <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> entire team at ILM. I said, [...] "This movie needs to be theatrical, operatic, romantic." [...] We used a lot of words not usually {{associated}} with high-tech blockbusters … We went for a very, very, very, very saturated color palette for the battle for Hong Kong. I kept asking John to tap into his inner Mexican and be able to saturate the greens and the purples and the pinks and the oranges. The classic Japanese woodblock print The Great Wave off Kanagawa by Hokusai was a common motif in the ocean battles; Del Toro recalled, [...] "I would say 'Give me a Hokusai wave'… we use the waves and weather in the movie very operatically." [...] The director asked that Knoll not necessarily match the lighting from shot to shot: [...] "It's pretty unorthodox to do that, but I think the results are really beautiful and very artistically free and powerful, not something you would associate with a big sci-fi action movie." [...] Del Toro considers the film's digital water its most exciting visual effect: [...] "The water dynamics in this movie are technically beautiful, but also artistically incredibly expressive. We agreed on making the water become almost another character. We would time the water very precisely. I'd say 'Get out of the wave [...]'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Following her {{departure}} from EastEnders, Johnson was more candid in her reasons for leaving: [...] "I've {{had a great}} time but {{it got to the point}} where I was sat in bed at night thinking: 'Tomorrow will my character be crying, getting drunk or having an argument?'. It soon became physically exhausting and draining [...] I don't think the producers were very happy when I said I wanted to leave. I was still very new and they had just set up the new Watts dynasty but no-one could have made me change my mind. When <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> producers I wanted to go they told me they might have to recast Vicki. I don't mind. Life goes on and EastEnders goes on. I wouldn't want to go back at the moment - but never say never." ...|$|E
2500|$|Romney {{says that}} his views on {{abortion}} were drastically altered on November 9, 2004, after discussing stem cell research with Douglas Melton, a stem cell researcher at Harvard University. The Harvard Stem Cell Institute was planning research that would have involved therapeutic cloning. The Governor says that Melton declared that the research [...] "is not a moral issue because we kill the embryos at 14days." [...] "I looked over at Beth Myers, my chief of staff, and we both had exactly the same reaction, which is it just hit us hard," [...] recalled Romney. [...] "And as they walked out, I said, 'Beth, we have cheapened the sanctity of life {{by virtue of the}} Roe v. Wade mentality.' And from that point forward, <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> people of Massachusetts, 'I will continue to honor what I pledged to you, but I prefer to call myself pro-life.'" [...] Melton disputes Romney's account of the meeting, declaring [...] "Governor Romney has mischaracterized my position; we didn't discuss killing or anything related to it ... I explained my work to him, told him about my deeply held respect for life, and explained that my work focuses on improving the lives of those suffering from debilitating diseases." ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 2007, Chappell {{alleged that}} he was a victim of a [...] "racist attack" [...] at the Bhubaneshwar Airport in January 2007 when a fan [...] "whacked him" [...] behind his ear, and accused the BCCI of {{covering}} up the issue. He also went on to say, [...] "As <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> BCCI in a letter, had it been one of the players who was attacked there would have been an outcry, but because it was me no-one seemed to care. The reply came back talking about my racist comments." [...] and added [...] "There was a cover-up. Everyone went into cover-up mode. It was quite obvious it was a serious assault. It wasn't just a push in the back as the media was led to believe. The whole thing was played down. The only phone call I got from the BCCI asked me whether it really happened." [...] In response, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah told Cricinfo, [...] "No way can it be called racist. We treated the issue just like we would have treated [...] any other Indian player. I remember calling him and finding out the issue. We also enhanced security and provided adequate protection. The local police also provided us with support." [...] Chappell later downplayed the incident saying his comments came at [...] "an emotional time".|$|E

2500|$|While on {{tour with}} L. du Garde's A Horse! A Horse!, Pinter {{found himself in}} Eastbourne without a place to stay. He met a {{stranger}} in a pub who said [...] "I can take you to some digs but I wouldn't recommend them exactly," [...] and then led Pinter to the house where he stayed. Pinter told his official biographer, Michael Billington, I went to these digs and found, in short, a very big woman who was the landlady and a little man, the landlord. There {{was no one else}} there, apart from a solitary lodger, and the digs were really quite filthy ... I slept in the attic with this man I'd met in the pub ... we shared the attic and there was a sofa over my bed ... propped up so I was looking at this sofa from which hairs and dust fell continuously. And <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> man, [...] "What are you doing here?" [...] And he said, [...] "Oh well I used to be...I'm a pianist. I used to play in the concert-party here and I gave that up." ... The woman was really quite a voracious character, always tousled his head and tickled him and goosed him and wouldn't leave him alone at all. And when I asked him why he stayed, he said, [...] "There's nowhere else to go." ...|$|E
2500|$|After Goforth’s {{address the}} first morning an elder stood up before all the people and confessed to having embezzled church funds. The effect on the hearers was “instantaneous”. One person gave a [...] “piercing cry” then many, now in tears, began {{spontaneous}} prayer and confession. For three days these incidents continued. Goforth recorded, [...] "On the fourth morning an unusually large congregation had assembled. The people seemed tense, expectant… Just then the hymn ended, and I rose to speak. All through that address I was acutely conscious {{of the presence of}} God. Concluding, <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> people: [...] "You may pray." [...] Immediately a man left his seat and, with bowed head and tears streaming down his cheeks, came up {{to the front of the}} church and stood facing the congregation. It was the elder who, two days before, had given vent to that awful cry. As if impelled by some power quite beyond himself, he cried out: [...] "I have committed adultery. I have tried three times to poison my wife." [...] Whereupon he tore off the golden bracelets on his wrist and the gold ring from his finger and placed them on the collection plate, saying: [...] "What have I, an elder of the Church, to do with these baubles?" [...] Then he took out his elder's card, tore it into pieces and threw the fragments on the floor. [...] "You people have my cards in your homes," [...] he cried. [...] "Kindly tear them up. I have disgraced the holy office. I herewith resign my eldership." [...] For several minutes after this striking testimony no one stirred. Then, one after another, the entire session rose and tendered their resignations. The general burden of their confession was: [...] "Though we have not sinned as our brother has, yet we, too, have sinned, and are unworthy to hold the sacred office any longer." [...] Then, the deacons one by one got up and resigned from their office. [...] "We, too, are unworthy," [...] they confessed. For days I had noticed how the floor in front of the native pastor was wet with tears. He now rose and in broken tones said, [...] "It is I who am to blame. If I had been what I ought to have been, this congregation would not be where it is to day. I'm not fit to be your pastor any longer. I, too, must resign." [...] Then there followed one of the most touching scenes that I have ever witnessed. From different parts of the congregation the cry was heard: [...] "It's all right, pastor. We appoint you to be our pastor." [...] The cry was taken up until it seemed as if every one was endeavouring to tell the broken man standing there on the platform that their faith and confidence in him had been completely restored. There followed a call for the elders to stand up; and as the penitent leaders stood in their places, with their heads bowed, the spontaneous vote of confidence was repeated, [...] "Elders, we appoint you to be our elders." [...] Then came the deacons' turn. [...] "Deacons, we appoint you to be our deacons." [...] Thus were harmony and trust restored. That evening the elder whose confession had had such a marked effect was remonstrated with by one of his friends. [...] "What made you go and disgrace yourself and your family like that?" [...] he was asked. [...] "Could I help it?" [...] he replied." ...|$|E
