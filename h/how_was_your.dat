50|$|Mu’awiya {{wrote to}} his {{governor}} over Kufa to send him Umm al-Khayr that he might take vengeance on her. When the letter reached his governor, he sent her to him. When Umm al-Khayr came in to Mu’awiya, she said:Assalamu ‘alayka, O Commander of the faithful! Wa ‘alayki assalam! By Allah, you have unwillingly greeted me with this title! Stop, fellow! Surely, the intuition of the supreme ruler (Sultan) refutes that which should be known. You have said the truth, O aunt! How have you seen your journey? I was still in well-being and safety until I reached a generous, openhanded king. Therefore, I am in an elegant life with a kind king. Through my good intention I gained a victory over you and helped (others) against you. Stop, fellow! By Allah, you shall have the refutation of the statement whose final result will ruin (you)! We want you not for this. I only do in your field. If I do something, I will do it. Therefore, ask as you like. <b>How</b> <b>was</b> <b>your</b> speech on the day when ‘Ammar bin Yasir was killed? By Allah, I had not narrated it before nor had I forged it after. It was only some words my tongue {{said at the time}} of the shock. If you wished to narrate you something other than that, I would do? I do not want that.Then Mu’awiya turned to his companions and asked them: “Which of you has memorized the speech of Umm al-Khayr? I have memorized it just as I have memorized the Sura of al-Hamd,” one of them retorted. “Say it,” demanded Mu’awiya.|$|E
5000|$|LifeRing {{has more}} than 200 {{face-to-face}} meetings in the U.S., Canada, Denmark, Ireland, Sweden and the United Kingdom.

There are also multiple e-mail support groups including LRSmail which has now been running over 15 years and a group for friends and relatives. There are e-mail groups which in addition to recovery issues also focus on providing support on body image, mental health, LGBTQ, workbook study and convening a meeting. There is also a book club and an e-mail group for the UK. LifeRing hosts a social networking site at Ning, a bulletin board forum and a one-to-one e-mail befriending service. As with SOS, where it began, [...] "Its main strength lies in its online presence." [...] LifeRing meetings use the book <b>How</b> <b>Was</b> <b>Your</b> Week which replaced the Handbook of Secular Recovery which in turn replaced the text used in Sobriety handbook, the SOS way: an introduction to Secular Organizations for Sobriety. The convenor will usually begin the meeting by asking “How was your week?” Individuals will contribute their experiences as they feel ready and other members are encouraged to interact and give feedback.

5000|$|In {{his first}} speech as mayor, Wildes named three issues as his top priorities: [...] "public education, {{property}} taxes, and bringing a fresh perspective to government." [...] In his first month in office, Wildes visited several elementary schools {{and middle schools}} in Englewood to begin a dialogue with students, {{as part of his}} plan to engage more young people in the political process. He talked to students about success and the American dream. At one such event, an elementary school student asked Wildes who his earliest political influence was. Wildes named John F. Kennedy. At another address at Dwight Morrow High School, he told the students, [...] "Never underestimate what being a good person can do for you. People remember the small things. Good morning, <b>how</b> <b>was</b> <b>your</b> day etc. and in return being a good person makes you marketable and appealing." [...] The same month, Wildes met with Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, then First Lady of Argentina.In February 2004, Wildes formed a task force to investigate reports by Latino immigrants living in Englewood that they had been targeted for exceedingly intrusive housing inspections. The Bergen Record printed reports of several raids in January 2004 that seemed to specifically target Colombian residents living on West, Charles, and James Streets. At a city council meeting in January, Donald Porrino, an Englewood Zoning officer, had denied targeting any ethnic group, and said inspections were intended to check for overcrowding and other fire safety risks. Wildes responded by saying, [...] "While the city has a sincere interest in averting fires and insuring that people live in hygienic conditions--we still have to insure that people's rights and homes are respected. When it comes to the safety and rights of individuals, an independent review is warranted". Wildes named Remberto Perez chairman of the investigative committee, although Christian Estevez replaced Perez in April. The task force judged raids were [...] "intrusive and bordered on civil rights violations." [...] In March 2004, Wildes ordered a study of Route 4 to check for possible repairs and other improvements to the highway.|$|E
