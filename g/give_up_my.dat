He {{did not attend the}} march due to church duties, but he later wrote, [...] "If I had any idea that the state troopers would use the kind of brutality they did, I would have felt compelled to <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> church duties altogether to lead the line."

500|$|When the Beagle {{returned}} on 2 October 1836, Darwin {{was already}} a celebrity in scientific circles, as in December 1835 University of Cambridge Professor of Botany John Stevens Henslow had fostered his former pupil's reputation by giving selected naturalists a pamphlet of Darwin's geological letters. Charles Lyell eagerly met Darwin {{for the first time}} on 29 October, enthusiastic about the support this gave to his uniformitarianism, and in May wrote to John Herschel that he was [...] "very full of Darwin's new theory of Coral Islands, and have urged Whewell to make him read it at our next meeting. I must <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> volcanic crater theory for ever, though it cost me a pang at first, for it accounted for so much... the whole theory is knocked on the head, and the annular shape and central lagoon have nothing to do with volcanoes, nor even with a crateriform bottom.... Coral islands are the last efforts of drowning continents to lift their heads above water. Regions of elevation and subsidence in the ocean may be traced by the state of the coral reefs." [...] Darwin presented his findings and theory in a paper which he read to the Geological Society of London on 31 May 1837.|$|E

Harrison said the BBC {{offered him a}} new contract with which he would be financially [...] "made for life" [...] but {{he would no longer}} be a promoter. Harrison insisted this {{had nothing to do with}} his boxing ability and the decision was racist because [...] "I don’t think if I was blond-haired and blue-eyed they’d have told me to <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> [...] company". A-Force Promotions was re-launched in the USA and Harrison formed a partnership with Al Haymon.|$|E

Luzhkov also claimed that the Russian authorities were planning to break up his wife's business empire and that the couple would fight the attempt: [...] "We will not <b>give</b> <b>up.</b> <b>My</b> wife will battle for her business and for her honour and self-worth.

Shortly thereafter, Shepard became the Chief of the Revenue Cutter Bureau and he wrote Healy warning {{him that if he}} could not control his drinking, he could face loss of command. Healy replied stating that he [...] "pledge to you by all I hold most sacred that while I live never to touch intoxicants of any kind or description....One thing I will hate and that is to <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> command of the Bear.

2500|$|One {{can easily}} guess what a European {{historical}} and existentialist philosopher might reply [...] You ask me, he would say, to 'die to History'; but man is not, and he cannot be anything else but History, for his very essence is temporality. You are asking me, then, to <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> authentic existence {{and to take}} refuge in an abstraction, in pure Being, in the atman: I am to sacrifice my dignity as a creator of History {{in order to live}} an a-historic, inauthentic existence, empty of all human content. Well, I prefer to put up with my anxiety: at least, it cannot deprive me of a certain heroic grandeur, that of becoming conscious of, and accepting, the human condition.|$|E
2500|$|In his {{autobiography}} written in 1876 Darwin reviewed questions about Christianity {{in relation to}} other religions and how [...] "the more we know of the fixed laws of nature the more incredible do miracles become". Though [...] "very unwilling to <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> belief", he found that [...] "disbelief crept over me at a very slow rate, but was at last complete. The rate was so slow that I felt no distress, and have never since doubted even for a single second that my conclusion was correct." [...] He noted how [...] "The old argument of design in nature, as given by Paley, which formerly seemed to me so conclusive, fails, now that the law of natural selection has been discovered", and how Paley's teleological argument had difficulties with the problem of evil.|$|E

He was approached on behalf of the British Government with the suggestion that if he would become a British subject the Government would be pleased to give him an important executive post and with the hint that if he succeeded a title might await him. His answer was: [...] "I'll do what I can for you with pleasure; but I'll be damned if I'll <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> American citizenship—not on your life!" [...] Within the last six months two large financial organizations, each independently, have offered him $100,000 a year to enter their service; and an industrial company offered him $100,000 [...] "to start with."

2500|$|As a {{young worker}} in the women's rights movement, Anthony {{expressed}} frustration when some of her co-workers began to marry and have children, sharply curtailing their ability {{to work for the}} understaffed movement. When Lucy Stone abandoned her pledge to stay single, Anthony's scolding remarks caused a temporary rupture in their friendship. Journalists repeatedly asked Anthony to explain why she never married. She answered one by saying, [...] "It always happened that the men I wanted were those I could not get, and those who wanted me I wouldn't have." [...] To another she answered, [...] "I never found the man who was necessary to my happiness. I was very well as I was." [...] To a third she said, [...] "I never felt I could <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> life of freedom to become a man's housekeeper.
