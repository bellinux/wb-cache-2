The Flash version was much simpler in design, and added circles onscreen as the game progressed. The iOS version added a new gameplay mode and a narrative element based on ciphers and codes, and was released on January 7, 2013 for iPhone and iPad, and later for Android. It was nominated for several Independent Games Festival awards, and The Atlantic critic Ian Bogost wrote that the game functioned like a <b>design</b> <b>object,</b> a feat unique for the video game medium.|$|E

Game Informer Ryckert also found the final puzzles too aggravating, especially the ones with invisible elements. Campbell of TouchArcade appreciated the [...] variety of puzzles from [...] "twitch" [...] to [...] "slow and thoughtful" [...] to, her favorite, the [...] "cerebral" [...] puzzles that required specific tricks as well as the ability to skip puzzles. She also found the last level nigh impossible. Multiple reviewers felt that the cipher puzzles were out of place, and TouchArcade said it was easy to ignore them as what felt like an [...] "utterly distinct" [...] game. The Atlantic Bogost thought that the hidden ciphers were the [...] "surest clue" [...] of its status as [...] "a <b>design</b> <b>object</b> and not a consumable media experience". Slater of Pocket Gamer wrote that the ciphers felt forced and unexciting, and was disappointed overall in consideration of [...] "the incredible talent involved". Whitehead of Eurogamer called the puzzles [...] "deftly constructed" [...] and said the game [...] "delights more than it frustrates". Wired Ryan Rigney wrote that Hundreds distinguished itself among iOS puzzle games in its style and design.|$|E

Versions of <b>design</b> <b>objects</b> have a common interface but differ in their implementations.

40|$|Integrated {{structural}} engineering system usually consists of {{large number of}} <b>design</b> <b>objects</b> that may be distributed across different platforms. These <b>design</b> <b>objects</b> need to communicate data and information among each other. For efficient communication among <b>design</b> <b>objects</b> a common communication protocol need to be defined. This paper presents {{the elements of a}} communication protocol that uses a mediator agent to facilitate communication among <b>design</b> <b>objects.</b> This protocol is termed the Mediative Communication Protocol (MCP). The protocol uses certain design communication performatives and the semantics of an Agent Communication language (ACL) mainly the Knowledge and Query Manipulation Language (KQML) to implement its steps. Details of a Mediator Agent, that will facilitate the communication among <b>design</b> <b>objects,</b> is presented. The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is used to present the Meditative protocol and show how the mediator agent can be use to execute the steps of the meditative communication protocol.

For a “uses” relation r on a set of objects X and a partitioning into modules viewed as an equivalence θ, we form a relation rθ on the set Xθ. We adopt an axiomatic point of view and investigate a variety of models, corresponding to different abstraction mechanisms and different ways of relating high- and low-level uses relations...|$|R

The research examines {{the ways in which}} <b>design</b> <b>objects</b> can be poetic and how designers actively and knowingly use objects to poetic effect. It is proposed that the poetic content of design artefacts can be located on a continuum ranging from the experiential - relating to how we perceive things - to the reflective and cultural. What unites these levels is the capacity of <b>design</b> <b>objects</b> to reveal and change our way of looking at things. The practice uses the design of lighting as a vehicle for exploring the poetic meaning of <b>designed</b> <b>objects</b> more generally.
