[...] "Alright" [...] was noted as being a [...] "sunny pop" [...] song while [...] "My Heart Will Fly" [...] was {{described}} as [...] "reflective", asking [...] "Why write the script with such an aching pain?

It begins with Millard reuniting with his father, before shifting to the throne of God.|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} positive reviews from critics. The {{authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, thought well of the episode, saying, [...] "A fun episode, where you root for Bart and, unusually, Nelson - all the way through. Homer <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> stupid for words, but that's excusable because we finally see Ned Flanders lose it, big time!" [...] In 2011, Keith Plocek of LA Weeklys Squid Ink blog named the scene in which Homer tries to purchase [...] "beer that has candy floating in it" [...] (which Homer calls skittlebrau) at the Kwik-E-Mart as the fourth best food moment on the show.|$|E

500|$|In 2000, Josh Rand {{contacted}} Corey Taylor after Taylor {{had returned}} from touring in Japan with his other band Slipknot about material {{he had been working}} on. Speaking about the experience, Taylor said, [...] "we just started writing stuff and it started to happen". The duo wrote 14songs and began working in a studio on some demos. Taylor added that it got to a point where he said to Rand, [...] "I think we're {{going to have to put}} a real band together, because this <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> serious!" [...] After further enlisting the help of Joel Ekman and previous Stone Sour members Shawn Economaki and Jim Root, the band began working on the album at Catamount Studios in Cedar Falls, Iowa. Before the release of the album, the band went through several different names, most notably Superego, before later announcing that they would use their original name Stone Sour.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} to {{the episode}} was mostly mixed. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their book}} Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three-and-a-half stars out of five. The two noted that the [...] "X-File in itself is an interesting concept, but left frustratingly vague." [...] Shearman and Pearson, however, did positively write that the episode is [...] "a character study which gives its new leads some background and depth and, better yet, somewhere new to develop." [...] VanDerWerff later awarded the episode an [...] "C+" [...] and wrote that [...] "there {{are a lot of}} things to like in “Empedocles,” but the central conceit <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> stupid for the episode as a whole to work." [...] While he enjoyed the [...] "way that [...] features all four FBI agents in the same episode", he was critical of both the plot and the Mulder and Scully dynamic, noting that it fell flat.|$|E
500|$|During {{the final}} years of the Clinton administration, Moran was {{critical}} of the President: In 1998, during the Monica Lewinsky scandal, Moran was one of only 31 House Democrats to support launching a formal impeachment inquiry into President Bill Clinton. He told Time magazine that [...] "This whole sordid mess <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> tawdry and tedious and embarrassing ... It's like a novel that just became too full of juicy parts and bizarre, sleazy characters." [...] Moran is also reported to have told First Lady Hillary Clinton that if she had been his sister, he would have punched her husband in the nose. Moran eventually decided not to vote for impeachment, explaining that Clinton had not compromised the country's security, and that he still respected him for what he had accomplished as President. Moran proposed a resolution demanding that Clinton confess to a pattern of [...] "dishonest and illegal conduct" [...] surrounding his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.|$|E

500|$|At home, Patrick is {{typically}} depicted either sleeping, watching TV, or {{engaged in the}} [...] "art of doing nothing", at which he is an expert. All the furnishings in the space under his rock are made of sand, and Patrick can simply opt to quickly build up furniture as needed; even so, his living space is sparse and contains only the barest essentials. Aside from his best friend SpongeBob, who is often impressed by Patrick's capacity {{to come up with}} naïve yet genius plans or solutions, Patrick frequently irritates those around him and is confounded by the simplest of questions or subjects. The characters of Mr. Krabs and Squidward have no patience for Patrick's stupidity, and the former does not pay him much regard; Clancy Brown, who provides Mr. Krabs' voice, said, [...] "The only person that he [...] doesn't hire is Patrick because Patrick <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> stupid to work for nothing." [...] Sandy often gets annoyed by Patrick, but still sees him as a friend.|$|E
500|$|Some critics {{opined that}} the Underwood {{character}} is less interesting once he achieves {{his goal of}} becoming president and actually has to govern. [...] "You could take the show seriously {{just as long as}} you didn’t have to take it seriously, as long as it only took place in the dream world of imaginary fantasy politics," [...] wrote Aaron Bady of The New Republic, who compared Underwood unfavorably with Josiah Bartlett of The West Wing. [...] "But when a cartoon becomes president, it starts to look too fake to be real, but too real to be a cartoon. Frank plays the role of President Bartlett, a cartoon president doing things that would actually, in reality, be kind of great. But Bartlett was too good to be true, and the old Frank was too evil to be true. President Underwood <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> dull to be a fantasy, and so the props take center stage." ...|$|E
500|$|One {{frequently}} criticised {{aspect of}} the game was its low and inconsistent frame rate. According to Trigger Happy author Steven Poole, [...] "The game's inadequate temporal resolution—owing to a wrongheaded choice to privilege visual detail over frame-rate—made it unplayable at higher difficulty levels." [...] In contrast, IGN {{pointed out that the}} frame rate [...] "can be sluggish in certain wide-open areas or when there are lots of enemies on-screen, but for some odd reason it's never really bothersome. Most of the time you're so caught up in the game that you don't notice it, and when you do, you're willing to forgive it as Perfect Dark <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> much fun to dwell on such an issue". Poole also described the [...] "lazy sci-fi fetishism" [...] of Joanna Dark's character design as [...] "a blatant and doomed attempt to steal the thunder of Lara Croft", and argued that she illustrated the challenges of characterising the protagonists of first-person shooters, a problem that GoldenEye 007 had avoided by using the already well-known character James Bond.|$|E

500|$|Gaga's {{cover of}} [...] "White Christmas" [...] is a [...] "jazzy rendition" [...] and {{features}} an extra verse about a snowman. Halfway into the cover, before beginning the new verse, Gaga says, [...] "So {{as you can}} tell, I'm very outgoing {{and a little bit}} shy, but I've decided that this song <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> short. It's such a beautiful Christmas song but it's only one verse, so I added an extra one." [...] "You and I" [...] is devoid of the musical arrangements from the version in Born This Way, and features instrumentation from a piano and a trumpet, which is played halfway through the song. From time to time, Gaga shouts the word [...] "America" [...] while singing the song. Her acoustic version of [...] "The Edge of Glory" [...] begins with a monologue, explaining her dedication of the song to her grandfather: [...] "It's the second Thanksgiving I'm spending without my grandpa, and I wrote this song about him, so here it is. So Grandma, if you're watching at home, this one's for you." [...] Following the first chorus, Gaga stops playing her piano and tells a story about Italian cookies. A recurring theme for the songs is Gaga stopping midway through singing to engage in conversation with the listeners.|$|E
500|$|Bob Sassone of TV Squad {{admitted}} {{in his review}} that after seeing the promos for [...] "Generalissimo" [...] audibly groaned, and believed the story about a fictitious soap character resembling Baldwin's Jack would not work. He wrote {{that all of the}} [...] "over-the-top surreal subplots" [...] featured in the season would make this episode [...] "the worst one of all." [...] After watching the episode, however, Sassone said all the elements worked. Annie Barrett for Entertainment Weekly reported that the two stories, involving Liz and Drew and Jack and Elisa, respectively, were sublime. Barrett said that Baldwin's performance [...] "alone" [...] would have made the episode great. Jeremy Medina of Paste praised this episode, along with [...] "St. Valentine's Day", concluding, [...] "There's no possible way to mention every funny joke or one-liner in the past two episodes. The show <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> lightning-quick for that." [...] Writing for The Monterey County Herald Marc Cabrera noted Jack's interactions with Elisa's grandmother amongst his favorite moments of season 3. The Guardians Will Dean wrote that [...] "Generalissimo" [...] was the [...] "best episode" [...] of the series. Staci Gold of North by Northwestern wrote that this episode was majorly improved by Baldwin's [...] "hilarious imitation of a Spanish accent." [...] IGN writer Robert Canning said that Baldwin stole the show in this episode, and rated it a 9.4 out of 10.|$|E
500|$|Robert Canning of IGN {{reported}} that the Valentine's Day theme in the episode [...] "was exactly {{what you would expect}} from a series that thrives on uncomfortable romantic situations." [...] He added {{that there was a lot}} to enjoy from [...] "St. Valentine's Day," [...] opining that it was a [...] "very funny episode" [...] and that it had [...] "plenty of get moments and memorable lines to make the weak endings a minor factor." [...] Canning rated the episode an 8.4 out of 10. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said that the episode was [...] "structurally and tonally", but disliked the way the show featured Jon Hamm, as he believed the show was not giving him enough to do besides being [...] "handsome." [...] Nonetheless, Sepinwall enjoyed the story between Liz and Drew in [...] "St. Valentine's Day" [...] writing that it was a [...] "better effort" [...] than shown in the previous episode, [...] "Generalissimo". As with Sepinwall, Maureen Ryan for the Chicago Tribune hoped the show would use Hamm [...] "better" [...] than demonstrated in his first two appearances. Entertainment Weekly contributor Annie Barrett wrote that she liked the way the episode handled the Valentine's Day theme, however, was not complimentary towards the way Tina Fey and Hamm were featured in [...] "St. Valentine's Day" [...] with her observing, [...] "the future for TV's most promisingly delicious couple... might not be so sweet." [...] Before the airing of the episode, Barrett very much liked the pairing of the two characters. Kevin D. Thompson for The Palm Beach Post was complimentary about the episode's theme, and praised 30 Rock for displaying [...] "one of the best" [...] episodes he has ever seen. Jeremy Median of Paste praised the episodes [...] "Generalissimo" [...] and [...] "St. Valentine's Day", concluding, [...] "There's no possible way to mention every funny joke or one-liner in the past two episodes.
