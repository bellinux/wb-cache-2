In other words, overreaction occurs {{if the market}} reacts too strongly or for too long to news, thus requiring adjustment in the opposite direction. As a result, outperforming assets in one period are likely to underperform in the following period. This also applies to customers' irrational purchasing habits.|$|E

Odds are, ever. No loopholes. Which means, Vampire Sunlight {{might be the last}} free release, and The Evil Microchip will not drop. Not even on YouTube. Sorry, Markus. But a major thank you is in order for {{everyone}} who's helped me this far. Everyone from Boe and Dre to Jimmy Iovine. All the graphic designers who have made covers, all the fans who uploaded my music, everyone. Thank you. My digital revolution has taken the Galaxy by storm, and I'm proud of it. It's just time to take things to a higher level. Hopefully, yall will support me. I'm not gonna throw the fact you've heard all my secrets for free in your face. But honestly, I would personally appreciate it if you went out and supported whatever I put in stores. More news to come, but once again, no free music indefinitely. Hold your head, kids...|$|E

The Aiken Standard of South Carolina referred to him as an [...] "anti-star", whose real identity remained [...] "amorphous and unmoored". Hoffman was acutely aware that he was often too unorthodox for the Academy voters. He remarked, [...] "I'm sure that people in the big corporations that run Hollywood don't know quite what to do with someone like me, but that's OK.

Despite being driven almost entirely by dialogue, it's never once boring, and the only real issue is the question on everyone's minds: Where is Iron Man?" [...] Jesse Schedeen of IGN gave it an 8.3 out of 10 saying, [...] "Between the lackluster FCBD Special and Marvel's general track record with major crossovers, there's plenty of reason to worry about Civil War II. But the <b>good</b> <b>news</b> <b>is</b> that this prologue issue makes a strong case for the upcoming event. It clearly lays out the brewing conflict and makes a strong case for both viewpoints." [...] David Pepose of Newsarama gave it an 8 out of 10 and said, [...] "Minor flaws in the premise aside, Bendis and Coipel deliver some surprisingly charming work with Civil War II #0, which — at least thus far — doesn't feel like the shameless cash-in that you might expect from this summer event sequel." ...|$|E

40|$|This study uses a {{historical}} {{setting in which}} expected litigation costs were low (i. e., Australia, from 1993 to 1996) to investigate whether companies with <b>good</b> <b>news</b> <b>were</b> more likely to preempt annual earnings than their counterparts with bad news. Empirical tests compare the probability of preemption conditional on having <b>good</b> <b>news</b> with the probability of preemption conditional on having bad news. The models control for other potential determinants of disclosure policy that have been documented in the literature. The results {{do not support the}} research hypothesis that companies with <b>good</b> <b>news</b> <b>were</b> more likely to preempt annual earnings than companies with bad news. This finding suggests that there may be other factors driving disclosure of bad news, in addition to those acknowledged in the extant literature. The evidence also indicates that in Australia during the investigation period, the probability of preemption was positively associated with firm size and analyst following and differed as a function of industry membership. 24 page(s...|$|R
500|$|On April 26, 2012, Sandoval hit {{a single}} in the fourth inning of {{a game against the}} Cincinnati Reds at Great American Ball Park in Cincinnati. This was the 19th {{consecutive}} game since Opening Day in which Sandoval had a hit, setting a Giants franchise record for longest consecutive hitting streak to begin a season. The previous record – of 18 games – was set by Johnny Rucker in 1945. Sandoval ran it up to 20 before it was snapped. However, in May, Sandoval fractured his left hamate bone, an injury which kept him out until early June. Giants' head athletic trainer Dave Groeschner said the day before Sandoval had surgery, [...] "I guess the <b>good</b> <b>news</b> <b>is</b> both [...] will be gone tomorrow and he can't do it again." [...] On July 1, 2012, it was announced that Sandoval had beaten out David Wright for his second All-Star team, as the starting third baseman for the National League. The choice was considered somewhat controversial by fans and executives (particularly Sandy Alderson), as David Wright had a significantly higher batting average than Sandoval at the time. Wright made the team as a reserve, and as a reporter pointed out, Sandoval in 2009 [...] "outperformed Wright, who was the fans' choice to start." [...] On July 10, at Kansas City's Kauffman Stadium, Sandoval highlighted the NL's five-run opening inning with the first bases-loaded triple {{in the history of the}} Midsummer Classic, off of reigning American League (AL) Cy Young Award winner Justin Verlander.|$|E
