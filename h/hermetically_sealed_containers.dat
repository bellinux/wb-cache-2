Mønsteds butter company was renamed to Otto Mønsted Aarhus in 1909 - usually just shortened to OMA - and the OMA margarine brand became very familiar in Denmark, as he introduced innovative marketing techniques for his time.

5000|$|Arriving in India, Hankin {{worked on}} the {{frequent}} outbreaks of cholera, challenging the prevalent view that [...] "miasmas" [...] were responsible for them. He demonstrated {{to the public and}} the officials that micro-organisms were the cause and published his notes and opinions translated into Indian languages. He noted in 1896 that boiling water supplies was a reliable protection against cholera in India. The press which was against his former association with experimenters who had been accused of vivisection noted that this implied that his services as a bacteriologist were not required. A writer Zoophilist states:- [...] "Remarkable to state, a vivisector has made a beneficial—and common-sense discovery. The discoverer in this case is Mr Hankin an old antagonist of ours, whom we met in debate at Cambridge before he took ship and departed to serve as a bacteriologist in India, where he still remains." [...] In 1896 he published, through the Pasteur Institute, [...] "L'action bactericide des eaux de la Jumna et du Gange sur le vibrion du cholera", a paper in which he described the antibacterial activity of a then unknown source in the Ganges and Jumna Rivers in India. He noted that [...] "It is seen that the unboiled water of the Ganges kills the cholera germ in less than 3 hours. The same water, when boiled, does not have the same effect. On the other hand, well water is a good medium for this microbe, whether boiled or filtered." [...] He suggested that it was responsible for limiting the spread of cholera. While many observers have considered this as evidence of early observations of bacteriophage activity, some of his later experiments raise doubts. Hankin subsequently suggested that the bactericidal action was through a [...] "volatile" [...] agent. He further conducted experiments where he showed that Ganga water heated in <b>hermetically</b> <b>sealed</b> <b>containers</b> retained their ability to kill bacterial cultures while open one on heating lost their potency. A 2011 commentator adds that Hankin's initial results suggest extremely high phage counts which seem improbable. It was however not until twenty years later that phage activity was demonstrated without doubt by the experiments of Félix d'Herelle later described at the Pasteur Institute. This observation on the water of the Ganges became quite famous, and even found mention in Mark Twain's More Tramps Abroad.|$|E

40|$|Canning as {{a method}} of food {{preservation}} has its origin in the work of Nicolas Appert (1750 - 1841) who was the first to use heat as a means of preserving food in <b>hermetically</b> <b>sealed</b> <b>containers.</b> Although he did not understand the principles of his method, his systematic experimentation (and generous sharing of his discoveries) laid the foundations of thermal food preservation methods. Appert initially processed his food in cork sealed glass jars and bottles in boiling water baths for periods varying from 15 minutes to two and a half hours. Storage trials were the basis of his processing methods, some foods being kept up to ten years. His products ranged from meats, soups and vegetables to fruit and even cream and evaporated milk. He recognized the value of quick clean handling of good quality raw materials. Blanching was used with some products, and he was also aware of the distinction between acid and low-acid foods in regard to their length of processing. Appert's understanding of the process was that heating eliminated the "air" which was believed to be the cause of spoilage. This belief was to persist for nearly 100 years. Appert's work in glass containers led to the development in England about 1815 - 20 of tin containers for preserved foods. Appert himself used cans in some of his later work. Some time before 1830 the autoclave was introduced (apparently by Appert) as a means of cooking canned foods under pressure. By 1870, autoclaves were being used quite widely in industrial canning...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background In {{the normal}} process of {{bioethanol}} production, biomass is transported to integrated large factories for degradation to sugar, fermentation, and recovery of ethanol by distillation. Biomass nutrient loss occurs during preservation and degradation. Our {{aim was to}} develop a decentralized ethanol production system appropriate for farm or co-operative level production that uses a solid-state fermentation method for producing bio-ethanol from whole crops, provides cattle feed, and produces no wastes. The idea is to incorporate traditional silage methods with simultaneous saccharification and fermentation. Harvested, fresh biomass is ensiled with biomass-degrading enzymes and yeast. Multiple parallel reactions for biomass degradation and ethanol and lactic acid production are induced in solid culture in <b>hermetically</b> <b>sealed</b> <b>containers</b> at a ranch. After fermentation, ethanol is collected on site from the vapor from heated fermented products. Results The parallel reactions of simultaneous saccharification and fermentation were induced efficiently in the model fermentation system. In a laboratory-scale feasibility study of the process, 250 g of freshly harvested forage rice with 62 % moisture was treated with 0. 86 filter paper units/g dry matter (DM) of cellulase and 0. 32 U/g DM of glucoamylase. After 20 days of incubation at 28 °C, 6. 4 wt. % of ethanol in fresh matter (equivalent to 169 g/kg DM) was produced. When the 46 wt. % moisture was gathered as vapor from the fermented product, 74 % of the produced ethanol was collected. Organic cellular contents (such as the amylase and pronase degradable fractions) were decreased by 63 % and organic cell wall (fiber) content by 7 % compared to silage prepared from the same material. Conclusions We confirmed that efficient ethanol production is induced in nonsterilized whole rice plants in a laboratory-scale solid-state fermentation system. For practical use of the method, further study is needed to scale-up the fermentation volume, develop an efficient ethanol recovery method, and evaluate the fermentation residue as an actual cattle feed. </p...|$|E
40|$|Master of ScienceFood Science InstituteDaniel Y. C. FungThe {{process of}} canning or “commercial sterilization” {{has been studied}} {{for more than two}} centuries. The first to develop canning as a defense against {{spoilage}} was Nicholas Appert also known as the “father of canning. ” Appert invented a method of preservation by enclosing food in <b>hermetically</b> <b>sealed</b> <b>containers</b> and then heating containers to boiling temperatures for a specific period of time. The canning preservation method has changed over the years, and continues to change for the better. Technology for retorts, or processing vessels, has grown from the traditional steam heating medium to also include water and steam/water spray heating mediums. The once static vessels, now utilize rotation and shaking motions to decrease process time and in turn increase product quality. The product packaging has also evolved to include not only rigid metal containers, but semi-rigid and flexible plastic containers. The variety of packaging adds greater flexibility to the type of food products that can be produced in a shelf stable manner. Canning or “commercial sterilization” is still used today by the food industry as a method of providing safe food with extended shelf life. Today’s goal of commercial sterilization is to continue to produce safe food products that are high in quality and profitable to produce. A variety of processing equipment is available to accomplish those goals, ranging from a basic steam retort to the newest technology on the market known as Shaka. This new retort technology uses reciprocal agitation to shorten processing times and increase the quality of the final products. Studies have shown that the Shaka process reduces processing times better than 20 -fold compared to a still process and better than 10 -fold compared to a rotary process. As the field of thermal processing continues to evolve, the challenge will be to consistently produce safe, commercially sterile food that exceeds current quality expectations in a shorter process time while using less energy. Shaka, and other new technologies, will help the food industry meet these challenges and expectations by expanding the current capabilities of thermal processing to meet consumer demands...|$|E

40|$|Batteries {{with various}} types of {{chemistries}} are typically sold in rigid <b>hermetically</b> <b>sealed</b> <b>containers</b> that, at the simplest level, must contain the electrolyte while keeping out the exterior atmosphere. However, such rigid containers can have limitations in packaging situations where {{the form of the}} battery is important, such as in hand-held electronics like personal digital assistants (PDAs), laptops, and cell phones. Other limitations exist as well. At least one of the electrode leads must be insulated from the metal can, which necessitates the inclusion of an insulated metal feed-through in the containment hardware. Another limitation may be in hardware and assembly cost, such as exists for the lithium-ion batteries that are being developed for use in electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). The large size (typically 10 - 100 Ah) of these batteries usually results in electric beam or laser welding of the metal cap to the metal can. The non-aqueous electrolyte used in these batteries are usually based on flammable solvents and therefore require the incorporation of a safety rupture vent to relieve pressure in the event of overcharging or overheating. Both of these features add cost to the battery. Flexible packaging provides an alternative to the rigid container. A common example of this is the multi-layered laminates used in the food packaging industry, such as for vacuum-sealed coffee bags. However, flexible packaging for batteries does not come without concerns. One of the main concerns is the slow egress of the electrolyte solvent through the face of the inner laminate layer and at the sealant edge. Also, moisture and air could enter from the outside via the same method. These exchanges may be acceptable for brief periods of time, but for the long lifetimes required for batteries in electric/hybrid electric vehicles, batteries in remote locations, and those in satellites, these exchanges are unacceptable. Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), in collaboration with several industrial partners, is working on low-cost flexible packaging {{as an alternative to the}} packaging currently being used for lithium-ion batteries [1, 2]. This program is funded by the FreedomCAR & Vehicle Technologies Office of the U. S. Department of Energy. (It was originally funded under the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles, or PNGV, Program, which had as one of its mandates to develop a power-assist hybrid electric vehicle with triple the fuel economy of a typical sedan.) The goal in this packaging effort is to reduce the cost associated with the packaging of each cell several-fold to less than $ 1 per cell ({approx} 50 cells are required per battery, 1 battery per vehicle), while maintaining the integrity of the cell contents for a 15 -year lifetime. Even though the battery chemistry of main interest is the lithium-ion system, the methodology used to develop the most appropriate laminate structure will be very similar for other battery chemistries...|$|E
40|$|Maize, {{being an}} {{important}} agricultural crop {{and among the}} three most widely grown in the world, {{plays an important role}} in the livelihood of smallholder farmers contributing 34 - 36 % daily calorific intake in East Africa and 10 % in West Africa. In developing countries, population growth is expected to occur with increasing food demand. Conversely, maize experiences post-harvest losses (PHLS) especially from the maize weevil (Sitophilus zeamais), which if minimized, could help to reduce the number of hungry people in the world that is about 870 million people and majority (850 million people) being in developing countries. For the economies of smallholder farmers, better storage leads to fewer losses, more income, more grain available to seed, greater family stability, lower risks of family/country conflicts, improvement in political stability and quality of life. The different approaches which were studied to control the maize weevils included: evaluation of hermetic maize storage for smallholder farmers, effect of blending maize kernels with amaranth during storage on maize weevil mortality, and effect of storage containers physical disturbance on maize weevil mortality. The first study found 100 % maize weevil mortality for <b>hermetically</b> <b>sealed</b> <b>containers</b> and the oxygen levels inside them declined from 21 % to between 3 and 10 %. From the maize, maize-amaranth experiment, it was concluded that blending maize with amaranth during storage reduced maize weevil population growth by 46 % compared to storing maize alone. From the last experiment, we found out that physical disturbance resulted in 81 % weevil mortality. The overall conclusion is that there are effective low-cost ways to control maize weevils by hermetic storage, physical disturbance and blending maize with amaranth during storage. Hermetic storage is the best among the researched methods to effectively control the maize weevils, followed by physical disturbance and then maize-amaranth mixture. Possible future research can be to: * Investigate the possible causes and how to eliminate and/or minimize maize spoilage on barrel walls. This experiment will seek to minimize and/or eliminate molds that were observed and the aflatoxin detected from samples picked from barrel walls. * Hermetic storage should be investigated without letting the weevils to first go first through lifecycles to increase in population. This experiment will investigate if kernel spoilage occurs on barrel walls if hermetic sealing in done from the first day of storage. * Investigate how long it takes for a female maize weevil to bore through a kernel. This test will establish how frequently it is necessary to disturb the weevils. * Setting up the same maize-amaranth experiment (50 : 50 by volume) but having an extra layer of amaranth on top to investigate if this can help completely control the maize weevil. This extra layer will reduce and/or eliminate the maize kernels that were available during our experiment. * Due to observation of no spoilt kernels for maize blended with grain amaranth on barrel walls, more research should be done to quantify the observations. This experiment may lead to hermetic and maize-amaranth mixture methods being used together by smallholder farmers to eliminate and/or mimimize weevils while experiencing no mold maize in metallic storage containers. * Investigate the effect of physical disturbance using larger storage containers. Since farmers use larger storage containers compared to what we investigated in laboratory setting, it is necessary to find out what will happen in real life. * Implement and test the researched methods in a developing country. These tests will help determine if the proposed methods are feasible...|$|E

Anaerobic treatment mainly influenced loss of weight and appearance, the former being significantly reduced throughout the whole shelf-life period, thus resulting in a better overall appearance of N 2 treated fruits, with no detrimental effects on taste. Nitrogen exposure drastically reduced decay by moulds as well as sugary exudate from the eye, leading to a cumulative product loss of 20 % with respect to 48 % of the control fruit...|$|R
40|$|Elements when {{bombarded with}} {{neutrons}} emit a gamma ray that {{is characteristic of}} the isotope that underwent a neutron induced nuclear reaction; {{this is known as}} neutron activation. The characteristic gamma energy of an isotope can then be detected and recorded. One can then analyze the gamma energies captured and determine the elemental makeup of the sample. This form of analysis can be used in an underwater environment making it potentially a valuable tool for agencies tasked with maritime security of ports and waterways, or clean-up operations. This thesis will focus on the feasibility of neutron interrogation using pulsed fast/thermal neutrons in an underwater environment for detecting various chemical substances in metal <b>containers.</b> A <b>hermetically</b> <b>sealed,</b> submersible <b>container</b> was used to test a d-T neutron generator’s and semiconductor detector’s functionality underwater in regards to detecting such chemicals as sulfur, nitrogen and chlorine rich materials...|$|R
40|$|The undersea {{environment}} places special {{demands on}} the design of electro-optic and fiber-optic systems. Encapsulation in <b>hermetically</b> <b>sealed</b> pressure <b>containers</b> is one solution to the problems associated with deployment at depth. An alternative approach which avoids the inconvenience of pressure containers and pressure hull penetrators is to operate the system in a fluid-filled, pressure equalized package which subjects the components to the ambient pressure encountered at depth. The data presented here characterize the behavior of GaAlAs, single mode, injection laser diodes under conditions of fluid immersion and hydrostatic pres-sure. Fluid immersion affects laser operation primarily by reducing the end facet reflec-tivity and thereby raising the threshold current. Elevated hydrostatic pressure also resul-ted in increased threshold current due to pressure induced changes in the band structure of the active layer material. Spectral changes were particularly evident with pressure induced mode hopping being the most significant effect...|$|R
