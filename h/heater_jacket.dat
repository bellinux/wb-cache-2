40|$|In a carbothermal process, gaseous methane {{is passed}} over molten regolith, which is heated past its melting {{point to a}} {{temperature}} in excess of 1, 625 C. At this temperature, materials {{in contact with the}} molten regolith (or regolith simulant) corrode and lose their structural properties. As a result, fabricating a crucible to hold the molten material and providing a method of contact heating have been problematic. Alternative containment approaches use a large crucible and limit the heat zone of the material being processed, which is inefficient because of volume and mass constraints. Alternative heating approaches use non-contact heating, such as by laser or concentrated solar energy, which can be inefficient in transferring heat and thus require higher power heat sources to accomplish processing. The innovation is a combination of materials, with a substrate material having high structural strength and stiffness and high-temperature capability, and a coating material with a high corrosion resistance and high-temperature capability. The material developed is a molybdenum substrate with an iridium coating. Creating the containment crucible or <b>heater</b> <b>jacket</b> using this material combination requires only that the molybdenum, which is easily processed by conventional methods such as milling, electric discharge machining, or forming and brazing, be fabricated into an appropriate shape, and that the iridium coating be applied to any surfaces that may come in contact with the corrosive molten material. In one engineering application, the molybdenum was fashioned into a container for a heat pipe. Since only the end of the heat pipe is used to heat the regolith, the container has a narrowing end with a nipple in which the heat pipe is snugly fit, and the external area of this nipple, which contacts the regolith to transfer heat into it, is coated with iridium. At the time of this reporting, no single material has been found that can perform the functions of this combination of materials, and other combinations of materials have not proven to be survivable to the corrosiveness of this environment. High-temperature processing of materials with similar constituencies as lunar regolith is fairly common. The carbo-thermal process is commonly used to make metallurgical-grade silicon for the semiconductor and solar-cell industries...|$|E

40|$|The {{dehydrogenation}} behaviour of a cylindrical MgH 2 {{metal hydride}} tank is examined by {{taking into account}} five different heat management scenarios. A three-dimensional mathematical model, validated with experimental results is utilized to simulate the dehydrogenation process of an up-scale cylindrical Mg metal hydride tank. The scope {{of this study is}} to examine the dehydrogenation kinetics of 100 g of H 2 that have been stored to the tank. Five different heat management scenarios are examined and compared to each other: a base case where the heat source for the dehydrogenation process is an external <b>heater</b> (external <b>jacket)</b> surrounding the tank. The second case examines the effect of the radiation heat transfer arising from an operating Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) to the metal hydride tank as a possible heat source for the dehydrogenation procedure. The third scenario takes into account the usage of internal heating tubes within the tank and the case of using 8 - 12 - 16 - 20 and 24 co-central tubes. For the fourth scenario, the optimum number of the co-central tubes from the previous case is used in combination with interior extended surfaces (fins). Finally, the last scenario involves the combination of the interior extended surfaces with the external jacket as a possible heat management technique. The results showed that when using the external heating jacket and the radiation heat from the SOFC the time for the hydride to release all the stored hydrogen (100 g) is greater than 15 min, while when using embedded heating tubes with oil as the flowing fluid the time is almost 7 min and when combine the embedded heating tubes with extended surfaces the time for the fully release of hydrogen can reduce more to 2 min. Finally, when combining the extended surfaces with the external heating jacket the total discharge time is less than 4 min...|$|R
