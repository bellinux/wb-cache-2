5000|$|In April 2004, NPR {{executives}} {{decided to}} [...] "freshen up" [...] Morning Editions sound. Edwards was removed as host, replaced with Steve Inskeep and Renée Montagne, and reassigned {{as a senior}} correspondent for NPR News. The move took him by surprise. [...] "Id rather stay," [...] he said, [...] "but <b>its</b> <b>not</b> <b>my</b> decision to make." [...] At first, NPR executives and spokespersons did not fully explain the move, leaving many listeners confused. [...] Eventually they did make some attempts to explain themselves. According to NPR spokeswoman Laura Gross, [...] "Its part of a natural evolution. A new host will bring new ideas and perspectives to the show. Bobs voice will still be heard; hell still be a tremendous influence on the show. We just felt {{it was time for}} a change." [...] Executive Vice President Ken Stern also explained the move. [...] "This change in Morning Edition is part of the ongoing evaluation of all NPR programming that has taken place over the last several years. Weve looked at shows like All Things Considered and Talk of the Nation with an eye to how we can best serve listeners in the future." [...] Although Stern later participated in an online chat with listeners at NPRs website, it only heightened their confusion and anger.|$|R

60|$|Such propositions are {{important}} to logic, because all inference depends upon them.

It {{seems to be the case}} that we can sometimes know molecular propositions, as in the above instance of the umbrella, when we do not know whether the component atomic propositions are true or false. The practical utility of inference rests upon this fact.|$|R

60|$|When eve has fairly set in, therefore, I sally forth, tightly {{buttoning}} my shaggy overcoat and hoisting <b>my</b> <b>umbrella,</b> the silken dome {{of which}} immediately resounds {{with the heavy}} drumming of the invisible raindrops.
