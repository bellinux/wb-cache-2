5|$|Advances in bioinformatics, {{refinements}} of DNA amplification, and {{the proliferation}} of computational power have greatly aided the analysis of DNA sequences recovered from environmental samples, allowing the adaptation of shotgun sequencing to metagenomic samples (known also as whole metagenome shotgun or WMGS sequencing). The approach, used to sequence many cultured microorganisms and the human genome, randomly shears DNA, sequences many short sequences, and reconstructs them into a consensus sequence. Shotgun sequencing reveals genes present in environmental samples. Historically, clone libraries were used to facilitate this sequencing. However, with advances in high throughput sequencing technologies, the cloning step is no longer necessary and greater yields of sequencing data can be obtained without this labour-intensive bottleneck step. Shotgun metagenomics provides information both about which organisms are present and what metabolic processes are possible in the community. Because the collection of DNA from an environment is largely uncontrolled, the most abundant organisms in an <b>environmental</b> <b>sample</b> are most highly represented in the resulting sequence data. To achieve the high coverage needed to fully resolve the genomes of under-represented community members, large samples, often prohibitively so, are needed. On the other hand, the random nature of shotgun sequencing ensures that many of these organisms, which would otherwise go unnoticed using traditional culturing techniques, will be represented by at least some small sequence segments.|$|E
25|$|For {{the purpose}} of setting {{treatment}} standards and reuse legislation, {{it is important to}} be able to determine the amount of helminth eggs in an <b>environmental</b> <b>sample</b> with some accuracy. The detection of viable helminth eggs in samples of wastewater, sludge or fresh feces (as a diagnostic tool for the infection helminthiasis) is not straight forward. In fact, many laboratories in developing countries lack the right equipment or skilled staff required to do so. An important step in the analytical methods is usually the concentration of the eggs in the sample, especially in the case of wastewater samples. A concentration step may not be required in samples of dried feces, e.g. samples collected from urine-diverting dry toilets.|$|E

500|$|Early {{molecular}} work in {{the field}} was conducted by Norman R. Pace and colleagues, who used PCR to explore the diversity of ribosomal RNA sequences. The insights gained from these breakthrough studies led Pace to propose the idea of cloning DNA directly from environmental samples as early as 1985. This led to the first report of isolating and cloning bulk DNA from an <b>environmental</b> <b>sample,</b> published by Pace and colleagues in 1991 while Pace was in the Department of Biology at Indiana University. Considerable efforts ensured that these were not PCR false positives and supported the existence of a complex community of unexplored species. Although this methodology was limited to exploring highly conserved, non-protein coding genes, it did support early microbial morphology-based observations that diversity was far more complex than was known by culturing methods. Soon after that, Healy reported the metagenomic isolation of functional genes from [...] "zoolibraries" [...] constructed from a complex culture of environmental organisms grown in the laboratory on dried grasses in 1995. After leaving the Pace laboratory, Edward DeLong continued in the field and has published work that has largely laid the groundwork for environmental phylogenies based on signature 16S sequences, beginning with his group's construction of libraries from marine samples.|$|E

40|$|<b>Environmental</b> <b>samples</b> {{collected}} {{from each of}} 3 locations on 23 large California dairies were cultured to evaluate the utility of this approach for identifying herds infected with Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis. Results were compared with concurrent ELISA testing of ≥ 60 animals in each herd, and with previously performed individual and pooled fecal cultures of 60 animals. The estimated proportions of infected herds {{did not differ significantly}} among the testing methods (<b>environmental</b> <b>sampling,</b> 74 %; previous fecal culture, 70 %; and concurrent ELISA testing, 65 %). Measures of agreement between <b>environmental</b> <b>sampling</b> and the results of previous fecal cultures were 70 % (observed agreement), 85 % (positive agreement), 62 % (negative agreement), and 0. 47 (kappa), whereas agreement between <b>environmental</b> <b>sampling</b> and concurrent ELISA testing was 65, 75, and 43 %, and 0. 19, for the same measures, respectively. The proportion of positive <b>environmental</b> <b>samples</b> on each farm was significantly correlated with the proportion of seropositive animals (r= 0. 53), suggesting that <b>environmental</b> <b>sampling</b> may also provide a qualitative estimate of within-herd prevalence.

40|$|This {{project was}} {{designed}} to develop a method for the collection of <b>environmental</b> <b>samples</b> during prolonged Norovirus (NoV) outbreak investigations, and to develop real-time RT-PCR assays to analyze <b>environmental</b> <b>samples</b> for GI and GII noroviruses. The collection and processing of <b>environmental</b> <b>samples</b> could provide epidemiological data to facilitate investigations of prolonged NoV outbreaks and could guide public health NoV intervention strategies. Real-time RT-PCR assays {{for the detection of}} GI and GII NoVs were developed by adapting the State Hygienic Laboratory clinical GI and GII assays to the AB 7500 Fast platform. Analysis of the GI assay performance yielded a dilution curve slope = 3. 28, R 2 = 0. 999 and a calculated amplification efficiency of 102 %. The GII assay yielded a dilution curve slope = 3. 39, R 2 = 0. 999 and a calculated amplification efficiency of 97 %. Amplification efficiencies determine the sensitivity and the limit of detection of real-time RT-PCR assays. Optimum efficiencies range from 95 %- 105 %, with a 100 % efficiency indicating exponential amplification of targeted nucleic acid. To develop a method for the collection of <b>environmental</b> <b>samples,</b> multiple swab types were tested to determine their ability to recover NoV from laboratory spiked environmental surfaces. It was determined that foam swabs moistened with viral transport media were most effective in recovering NoV from spiked surfaces. A field test of the <b>environmental</b> <b>sampling</b> method was conducted by <b>sampling</b> <b>environmental</b> surfaces in four restaurants in one Iowa community. NoVs were not detected in the <b>environmental</b> <b>samples.</b> The collection and processing of <b>environmental</b> <b>samples</b> when conducting an investigation of a prolonged NoV outbreak could provide additional information on the epidemiology of NoV transmission and infection...|$|R
