At this point, Fergus, working the land {{in the service of}} his father, spots the knights and is {{inspired}} by them.

She protects her people until Doro's arrival, at which point he forces his breeding program on her community. One man <b>he</b> <b>brings</b> <b>to</b> mate with one of Anyanwu’s daughters ruins the harmony of the colony, resulting in several deaths. Anyanwu becomes tired of Doro's control, since his immortality makes him the only permanent thing in her life. She decides to commit suicide. Her decision causes Doro to have a change of heart. In desperation, he agrees to compromise {{as long as she}} goes on living. From that point on, Doro no longer kills as carelessly to remain immortal, and does not choose his kills from the people that he should be protecting. He also stops using Anyanwu to breed; from now on she helps him in his quest to try to find more promising seeds, but is more of an ally and partner than his slave.|$|E

500|$|Kapoor next took on {{the role}} of a drug abusing rock star in Udta Punjab (2016), a crime drama from the {{director}} Abhishek Chaubey that documents the substance abuse endemic in the Indian state of Punjab. Kapoor, a teetotaler, found it challenging to play a character who he deemed to be [...] "all about addiction". He based the role on several pop stars, and was particularly interested in bringing out the character's hidden vulnerability despite his obnoxious actions. Udta Punjab generated controversy when the Central Board of Film Certification demanded extensive censorship before its theatrical release, citing that the portrayal of Punjab in it was negative. The demands sparked a broad debate about the freedom of expression in India. After the producers of the film filed lawsuit against the board, the Bombay High Court cleared the film for exhibition with a single scene cut, in which Kapoor's character is shown urinating on people. In a highly positive review, Sukanya Verma took note of the film's anti-drug message; in addition, she considered Kapoor to be [...] "spectacularly unbridled" [...] in his part and added that [...] "the believability <b>he</b> <b>brings</b> <b>to</b> his complex transition while preserving his inherent flakiness deserves all the praise". Kapoor won the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor (shared with Manoj Bajpayee for Aligarh) and received a Best Actor nomination at the same ceremony.|$|E
500|$|Mayberry {{made the}} Phillies' opening day roster {{for the first}} time, and {{recorded}} the game-winning RBI via a pinch hit single in the Phillies' first game, but was optioned back to the minors after the Phillies activated Shane Victorino from the disabled list in early June. Subsequently, Mayberry returned to the big-league club when Victorino {{went back to the}} disabled list. Throughout 2011, Mayberry did not have a defined role on the club. In August, columnist David Murphy wrote, [...] "While the Phillies may not see evidence that Mayberry should be part of their everyday plans, it is getting hard to ignore the two huge offensive tools <b>he</b> <b>brings</b> <b>to</b> the table: immense power, and a curious ability to hit when it counts." [...] He added, [...] "Charlie Manuel has always seemed to have a soft spot in his heart for Mayberry. And, more importantly, he has always seemed to have a knack for when to put him into a game." [...] Manuel compared Mayberry to former Phillie Jayson Werth in terms of their size, athleticism, {{and the fact that they}} both hit better against left-handed pitching than right-handed pitching, noting that he planned to give Mayberry a chance to start if Ben Francisco floundered. Ultimately, the Phillies traded away Francisco after the season, in part due to Mayberry's emergence. He finished the season batting [...]273/.341/.513, with a [...]854 OPS and 15 home runs in 104 games, and made his postseason debut in the National League Division Series against the St. Louis Cardinals that September.|$|E

500|$|Several anime and manga {{publications}} {{have provided}} praise for Saitō. His fight {{scenes in the}} series, in particular, have also been acclaimed. While reviewing the volume 7 from the manga, Mania Entertainment writer Megan Lavey applauded the fight between Himura Kenshin and Saito Hajime at the Kamiya Dojo as the [...] "high spot of the [...] high spot". In the volume 14 review for the manga, Lavey described {{the end of the}} fight between Saitō and Usui as [...] "very gruesome and not for the faint of heart". In the DVD volume 7 review for the anime, Mania Entertainment's Chris Beveridge described the fight scene between Saitō and Kenshin as [...] "definitely choreographed well". He praised [...] "the viciousness in the attacks, masked under their cold calculating facade" [...] as being [...] "wonderfully done, providing a real feel for these ultimate killers". His appearance in the OVAs has also received praise. Mike Crandol of Anime News Network states that during the character's brief appearances in the [...] OVA series, he appears to be [...] "truly menacing." [...] Mark A. Grey of Anime News Network said that the song [...] "Hoeru Miburo (Howling Wolf of Mibu)" [...] in the anime series [...] "perfectly" [...] represents the character. Reviewing the manga Restoration, Rebecca Silverman from Anime News Network felt Saitō's was interesting in regards to his philosophy as it contrasted Kenshin's but lamented his lack of appearances in this version. Daryl Surat from Otaku USA considers him as the greatest character from the series based on the impact <b>he</b> <b>brings</b> <b>to</b> the series during his introduction.|$|E
