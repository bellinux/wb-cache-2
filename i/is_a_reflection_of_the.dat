They occur in a pattern that generally repeats every 243 years, with pairs of transits eight years apart separated by long gaps of 121.5 years and 105.5 years.

25|$|When a {{classical}} particle is weakly coupled to a radiation field, {{so that the}} radiative damping can be neglected, it will emit radiation in a pattern which repeats itself every orbital period.

A theory popular among modern scholars is that the forms of the letters derive from the various numerical tally-mark systems in existence at the time. This theory was first suggested by the scholars Rudolf Thurneysen and Joseph Vendryes, who proposed that the ogham script was inspired by a pre-existing system of counting based around the numbers five and twenty, which was then adapted to an alphabet form by the first ogamists.|$|E
25|$|The {{diversity}} of cuisine in Abu Dhabi <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cosmopolitan {{nature of the}} society. Arab food is very popular and is available everywhere in the city, from the small shawarma to the upscale restaurants in the city's many hotels. Fast food and South Asian cuisine are also very popular and are widely available. The sale and consumption of pork, though not illegal, is regulated and it is sold only to non-Muslims in designated areas. Similarly, the sale of alcoholic beverages is regulated. A liquor permit is required to purchase alcohol; however, alcohol, although available in bars and restaurants within four or five star hotels, is not sold as widely as in its more liberal neighbour Dubai. Shisha and qahwa boutiques are also popular in Abu Dhabi.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the strongest}} {{deviations}} from Boasian orthodoxy was White's view {{of the nature of}} anthropology and its relation to other sciences. White understood the world to be divided into cultural, biological, and physical levels of phenomenon. Such a division <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> composition of the universe and was not a heuristic device. Thus, contrary to Alfred L. Kroeber, Kluckhohn, and Edward Sapir, White saw the delineation of the object of study not as a cognitive accomplishment of the anthropologist, but as a recognition of the actually existing and delineated phenomena which comprise the world. The distinction between 'natural' and 'social' sciences was thus based not on method, but {{on the nature of the}} object of study: physicists study physical phenomena, biologists biological phenomena, and culturologists (White's term) cultural phenomena.|$|E

25|$|Within wine {{there are}} {{volatile}} and non-volatile compounds {{that contribute to}} the make up of a wine's aroma. During the fermentation and for {{the first few months of}} a wine's existence, chemical reactions among these compounds occur frequently and a wine's aroma will change more rapidly during this period than at any other point. As a wine ages and matures, changes and developments in aroma will continue to take place but at a slower and more gradual pace. Volatile aroma compounds are present in the skin and juice of a grape berry and will vary in composition according to the individual grape variety. It is theorized that the Vitis vine developed these compounds as an evolutionary tool to aid in procreation by attracting insects to assist with pollination and birds and other animals to eat the berries and disperse the seeds. The diverse spectrum of aromas associated with individual grape varieties <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vine's adaptation to ecological conditions and competition among other plants.|$|E
25|$|Tombstones, altars, tombs, coins, bins, {{ceramics}} and {{glass from the}} Roman era {{have been found in}} almost all parishes of the municipality. These date back to the first and fourth century, including the Roman road connecting Sintra and Peniche, which crosses Mafra, intersecting the Cheleiros, Mafra, Ericeira, Paço de Ilhas and S. Domingos da Fanga da Fé (where portions of the road have been conserved). In Cheleiros and Carvoeira there are two bridges constructed by the Romans. One of these, a bridge in Santo Isidoro (as well as a 100-metre portion of road) {{that was part of the}} Sintra-Peniche accessway, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> areas Romanization. An important agriculture centre during Roman occupation, anthropologists have discovered Roman coins of the eras of Augustus (27-14 B.C.), Claudius (41-54 B.C.) and Magnus Maximo (383-388 B.C.). Although it is unclear the areas importance within Olissipo, its agricultural contributions may have contributed to its strong settlement during the period. Wine, oil and vegetables were easily commercialized across the accessway and along the rivers of Cheleiros, Ilhas and Safarujo, which were navigable until the Middle Ages.|$|E
25|$|It is {{now well}} {{recognized}} that feeding ticks, sandflies, and, more recently, mosquitoes, have {{an ability to}} modulate the immune response of the animals (hosts) on which they feed. The presence of this activity in vector saliva <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inherent overlapping and interconnected nature of the host hemostatic and inflammatory/immunological responses and the intrinsic need to prevent these host defenses from disrupting successful feeding. The mechanism for mosquito saliva-induced alteration of the host immune response is unclear, but the data have become increasingly convincing that such an effect occurs. Early work described a factor in saliva that directly suppresses TNF-α release, but not antigen-induced histamine secretion, from activated mast cells. Experiments by Cross et al. (1994) demonstrated that the inclusion of Ae. aegypti mosquito saliva into naïve cultures led to a suppression of interleukin (IL)-2 and IFN-γ production, while the cytokines IL-4 and IL-5 are unaffected by mosquito saliva. Cellular proliferation in response to IL-2 is clearly reduced by prior treatment of cells with mosquito salivary gland extract. Correspondingly, activated splenocytes isolated from mice fed upon by either Ae. aegypti or Cx. pipiens mosquitoes produce markedly higher levels of IL-4 and IL-10 concurrent with suppressed IFN-γ production. Unexpectedly, this shift in cytokine expression is observed in splenocytes up to 10 days after mosquito exposure, suggesting natural feeding of mosquitoes can have a profound, enduring, and systemic effect on the immune response.|$|E
