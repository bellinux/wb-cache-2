In this trial, we introduced a respiration-gated scanning which improved the spatial resolution. The positron angiograms, which were obtained with the dual time PET scanning, were simultaneously carried out for the orientation of anatomy. We adopted the expression with the <b>differential</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>ratio</b> (DAR) method which gave more quantitative information than a mere photographic display. Malignant tumors were visualized clearly in all patients, and their anatomical location and structures were correctly diagnosed.

But the histological typing and grading of lung cancers were not identified by PET.

Tissue distribution studies in immature estrogen primed female rats revealed high uptake of radioactivity, expressed as the <b>differential</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>ratio,</b> by uterine tissue. After simultaneous administration with unlabeled FENP, a significant decrease (83 %) in uterine uptake was observed 60 min after injection. Uterine uptake was highly selective. The ratio of uptake of radioactivity by uterine tissue to that by blood was 39 at 180 min. In mice bearing transplanted Grunder strain mammary carcinomas tissue, distribution studies demonstrated a selective uptake of [F- 18]FENP by PR positive tumors. Pretreatment with unlabeled FENP caused a significant decrease (66 %) in tumor uptake. Uptake by other tissues was not affected {{by the presence of}} unlabeled progestin. The ratio of uptake of radioactivity by tumor tissue to that by blood was 4. 7 at 180 min. For FENP pretreated mice and mice bearing PR negative tumors, this ratio was 1. 7 and 1. 1, respectively. It is concluded that the uptake of [F- 18]FENP by uterine and by PR positive mammary tumor tissue in vivo is primarily receptor related, presumably to the PR.

Various indexes are calculated for evaluation of tumor glucose metabolism from FDG PET image. Some indexes need sequential multiple-time uptake data and arterial plasma FDG concentrations (dynamic study). But some indexes use only static image data to calculate. We calculated four kinds of indexes on each patient, and analyzed the correlation of each index with others. Thirty-five patients with untreated malignant tumors, twenty-three non-Hodgikin 2 ̆ 7 s lymphoma, four lung cancers, two epipharynx cancers and other six malignant tumors, were studied by FDG PET. In all patients, about 4 mCi (148 MBq) of FDG was injected intravenously in a fasting state, and a series of 2 -min sequential scans was acquired for 60 minutes following injection. After sequential scans, 6 -min scan was successively added for obtaining static image. The rate constants (k_ 1 -k_ 4) calculated by non-linear least squares fitting routines, the slope of Patlak-Gjedde plot, <b>differential</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>ratio</b> (DAR) which represents tumor activity corrected by administrated dose per body weight, and tumor-to-normal soft-tissue contrast rations (TCR) were calculated for every each patient. The correlation of these indexes was analyzed statistically. Patlak-Gjedde plot seemed to be widely accepted for measuring tumor glucose metabolism, but it needs dynamic study data. DAR is a simple index easily calculated using static data. Our results showed that the slope of Patlak-Gjedde plot and DAR were closely correlated, the correlation of them was 0. 93. It seemed to be suggested that the DAR could be used in place of Patlak-Gjedde plot. The correlation between Patlak-Gjedde plot and TCR was 0. 84, between DAR and TCR was 0. 88.

40|$|The <b>differential</b> <b>absorption</b> {{method of}} {{retrieving}} D-region electron density profiles from partially reflected MF radar pulses, has existed in many variants since the original Gardner and Pawsey experiment of 1953. Magnetoionic theory predicts that a pulse propagating within the ionosphere undergoes birefringence two magnetoionic modes. The <b>differential</b> <b>absorption</b> method requires {{that both the}} <b>differential</b> <b>absorption</b> and the <b>ratio</b> of the reflection coefficients of those modes are evaluated from a model profile. In this thesis, a critical review of the <b>differential</b> <b>absorption</b> method is undertaken. Results obtained using the phase shifted correlation polarimeter at the University of Canterbury's Birdlings Flat radar facility near Christchurch, New Zealand, are synthesised to retrieve electron density measurements. The results indicate that over some height ranges, <b>differential</b> <b>absorption</b> method does not account adequately for ionospheric discontinuities and generates reflection coefficient ratios which are in error. An alternative to the <b>differential</b> <b>absorption</b> method is developed. This alternative uses an optimal estimation inverse method to retrieve both electron density-height and gradient electron density-height profiles. It is asserted that this retrieval, although not resolving small scale discontinuities, does account for them. The retrieval uses a forward model which includes the physical effects of the ionosphere upon a propagating MF pulse. A feature of the forward model is {{that as well as}} using a Fresnel reflection model and parameterising pulse width effects, it includes the effects of both absorption and Faraday rotation upon the magnetoionic modes of propagating pulses. Hourly mean electron density-height and gradient. electron density-height profiles are generated for the hours of 10 : 00 to 14 : 00 every day, over the time period of January 1994 to December 1999, The results of these retrievals are used for internal and external validation as well as to assess geophysical effects upon the distributions of middle atmospheric nitric oxide. Results of diagnostic tests and the internal validation process indicate that the retrieval consistently converges towards solutions which can be regarded as approximating "true" ionospheric behaviour. The external validation results suggest that the optimal estimation electron densities contain structure which has been observed in other studies and which can be explained in terms of dynamics and chemistry. Analyses of long term and seasonal variability of nitric oxide transport are facilitated by using a simple photochemical model to derive nitric oxide profiles from optimal estimation electron density profiles. Results show that wintertime enhancement of nitric oxide transport to the mesosphere takes place. The extent of this enhancement varies from year to year with the downward extent of vertical transport of thermospheric nitric oxide showing inter-annual variability. Gradient electron densities may indicate the presence of mesospheric gravity wave breaking. They also exhibit a strong seasonal variation with large reductions at equinox possibly indicating a lack of breaking gravity waves at this time of year. The ratio of gradient electrons to electrons shows seasonal variability consistent with the notions that gravity wave breaking occurs over a broader range in winter than in summer and upward propagation of orographic gravity waves is favoured in winter...|$|R
