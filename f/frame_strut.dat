His 1940 Allievo Pavullo was a strengthened Zögling with a plywood skinned nacelle {{in place of the}} original exposed, girder supported seat. This nacelle contained the open cockpit, placed just ahead of the wing leading edge and extended up to the wing behind the cockpit and rearwards to enclose the forward cross members of the simple girder fuselage. As on the Zögling these cross members ran in the vertical plane between a horizontal upper beam and a lower beam which sloped upwards to the tail, though their angles were altered {{so as not to be}} normal to the top girder. Again like the Zögling, on the wire braced Allievo Pavullo two forward cross members continued above the wing to form a triangular cabane, faired in on the Teichfuss development, to which some wires were attached. This was dispensed with on the strutted variant, which also had an extra <b>frame</b> <b>strut</b> towards the rear and normal to the lower girder.|$|E

In many cities of India, it is very common to leave the first storey of masonry infilled reinforcement concrete (RC) frame building open preliminary to generate parking space or any other purposes (Ex-Reception lobbies) in the first storey. This Open First storey is also termed as “Soft Storey”. The upper storeys have brick infilled wall panels with various opening percentage in it. This type of buildings are highly undesirable in seismically active areas because various vertical irregularities are created in such buildings which have consistently performed very poor behavior during past earthquake.

40|$|Compared to the {{vehicles}} with conventional steering, the articulated frame steer vehicles (ASV) {{are known to}} exhibit lower directional and roll stability limits. Furthermore, the tire interactions with relatively rough terrains could adversely affect the directional and roll stability limits of an ASV due to terrain-induced variations in the vertical and lateral tire forces. It may thus be desirable to assess the dynamic safety of ASVs {{in terms of their}} directional control and stability limits while operating on different terrains. The effects of terrain roughness on the directional stability limits of an ASV are investigated through simulations of a comprehensive three-dimensional model of the vehicle with and without a rear axle suspension. The model incorporates a torsio-elastic rear axle suspension, a kineto-dynamic model of the <b>frame</b> steering <b>struts</b> and equivalent random profiles of different undeformable terrains together with coherence between the two tracks profiles. The simulations are performed to determine the stability limits of the ASV models while operating on different terrains, namely: a perfectly smooth surface, plowed field, pasture, gravel road, and the MVEE random course. The directional stability limits are defined in terms of the static and dynamic rollover thresholds, rearward amplification ratio, and critical speed corresponding to snaking instability under steady and transient steering inputs. The results suggest that the tire interactions with the rough terrains affect the stability limits of both the unsuspended and suspended vehicles in a highly adverse manner. The suspended vehicle responses, however, show less sensitivity to variations in the road roughness profile...|$|R

40|$|To {{enhance the}} {{performance}} of modern high-bypass jet engines a promising approach is to replace the low pressure-vane row arranged downstream of a strutted intermediate turbine diffuser (mid turbine frame) by the application of turning struts and to integrate functionalities such as bearing supports, lubrication pipes, engine mounts and aggressive duct designs. Thus the weight may be reduced which results in a lower specific fuel consumption and reduced CO 2 -emissions. The additional functions of the mid turbine frame (MTF) structures lead to constraints like a minimum required strut thickness leading to a maximum possible number of struts.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{high level}} {{vibration}} of helicopter flight can cause physiological {{harm to the}} aircrew and may lead to occupational health issues. This article presents {{the development of an}} adaptive helicopter seat mount to reduce the vibration levels transmitted to the aircrew body. Flight test on a Bell- 412 helicopter was conducted to measure the aircrew body vibra-tion levels and vibration transmission through the seat structures. Experimental modal anal-ysis on a Bell- 412 co-pilot seat equipped with a mannequin was carried out to investigate the seat/aircrew dynamics and identify critical vibration modes. Based on observations from the configuration, an adaptive helicopter seat mount has been developed. Two stacked piezoelec-tric actuators were installed on the seat <b>frame</b> as active <b>struts</b> to provide effective control authority to the critical mannequin vibration modes. A proof-of-concept adaptive helicopter seat has been retrofitted on a full-scale Bell- 412 co-pilot seat and the performance has been evaluated through extensive closed-loop control experiments. Test results demonstrated simul-taneous suppression of the critical mannequin vibration modes and achieved significant global reduction of the body vibration levels, which verified the effectiveness of the adaptive helicopter seat mount concept for helicopter aircrew vibration reduction applications.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} an experimental {{investigation of the}} unsteady flow field in the two-spool counter-rotating transonic turbine at Graz University of Technology. The test setup consists of a high pressure (HP) stage, a diffusing mid turbine <b>frame</b> with turning <b>struts</b> (TMTF) and a shrouded low pressure (LP) rotor. The two rotors are mounted on mechanically independent shafts {{in order to provide}} engine-representative operating conditions. The rig was designed in cooperation with MTU Aero Engines and Volvo Aero within the EU project DREAM (ValiDation of Radical Engine Architecture SysteMs). A two-sensor fast response aerodynamic pressure probe (2 S-FRAP) has been employed to provide time-resolved aerodynamic area traverses downstream of the LP turbine. Such measurement allows estimating the total deterministic unsteadiness transported through the duct. In particular, it has been possible to isolate the structures induced by each rotor by means of the encoders mounted on the two shafts. A global ensemble averaged field, which takes into account the rotor-rotor interactions, is also provided. The time resolved distributions of the flow quantities are then discussed in details. The perturbations due to the HP rotor in terms of velocity and flow angle are negligible in this downstream plane. Indeed, the largest fluctuations of velocity are due to the TMTF-LP rotor interaction, they occur in the wake and secondary flows of the TMTF. Large fluctuations of static and total pressure are instead due to both rotors to the same extent...|$|R
