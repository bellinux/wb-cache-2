5|$|The Société des Gens des Lettres, a Parisian {{organization}} of writers, planned {{a monument to}} French novelist Honoré de Balzac immediately {{after his death in}} 1850. The society commissioned Rodin to create the memorial in 1891, and Rodin spent years developing the concept for his sculpture. Challenged in finding an appropriate representation of Balzac given the author's rotund physique, Rodin produced many studies: portraits, full-length figures in the nude, wearing a <b>frock</b> <b>coat,</b> or in a robe– a replica of which Rodin had requested. The realized sculpture displays Balzac cloaked in the drapery, looking forcefully into the distance with deeply gouged features. Rodin's intent had been to show Balzac at the moment of conceiving a work– to express courage, labor, and struggle.|$|E
5|$|Depp {{collaborated with}} costume {{designer}} Penny Rose on his character's appearance, handpicking a tricorne as Sparrow's signature leather hat; to make Sparrow's unique, {{the other characters}} did not wear leather hats. A rubber version {{was used for the}} scene in Dead Man's Chest when the hat floats on water. Depp liked to stick to one costume, wearing one lightweight silk tweed <b>frock</b> <b>coat</b> throughout the series, and he had to be coaxed out of wearing his boots for a version without a sole or heel in beach scenes. The official line is that none of the costumes from The Curse of the Black Pearl survived, which allowed the opportunity to create tougher linen shirts for stunts. However, one remains which has been displayed in an exhibition of screen costumes in Worcester, England. It was a nightmare for Rose to track down the same makers of Sparrow's sash in Turkey. Rose did not want to silkscreen it, as the homewoven piece had the correct worn feel. Sparrow wears an additional belt in the sequels, because Depp liked a new buckle which did not fit with the original piece.|$|E

5|$|The prince found {{fulfillment}} {{in activities}} that required physical skills, {{rather than in the}} classroom. At his father's Santa Cruz farm, Pedro trained unbroken horses, and became a fine horseman and an excellent farrier. He and his brother Miguel enjoyed mounted hunts over unfamiliar ground, through forests, and even at night or in inclement weather. He displayed a talent for drawing and handicrafts, applying himself to wood carving and furniture making. In addition, he had a taste for music, and under the guidance of Marcos Portugal the prince became an able composer. He had a good singing voice, and was proficient with several musical instruments (including piano, flute and guitar), playing popular songs and dances. Pedro was a simple man, both in habits and in dealing with others. Except on solemn occasions when he donned court dress, his daily attire consisted of white cotton trousers, striped cotton jacket and a broad-brimmed straw hat, or a <b>frock</b> <b>coat</b> and a top hat in more formal situations. He would frequently take time to engage in conversation with people on the street, noting their concerns.|$|E
5|$|The White House's {{most famous}} alleged {{apparition}} {{is that of}} Abraham Lincoln. Eleanor Roosevelt never admitted to having seen Lincoln's ghost, but did say that she felt his presence repeatedly throughout the White House. Mrs. Roosevelt {{also said that the}} family dog, Fala, would sometimes bark for no reason at what she felt was Lincoln's ghost. President Dwight Eisenhower's press secretary, James Hagerty, and Liz Carpenter, press secretary to First Lady Lady Bird Johnson, both said they felt Lincoln's presence many times. The former president's footsteps are also said to be heard in the hall outside the Lincoln Bedroom. As reputable an eyewitness as Lillian Rogers Parks admitted in her autobiography My Thirty Years Backstairs at the White House that she had heard them. Margaret Truman, daughter of President Harry S. Truman, said she heard a specter rapping {{at the door of the}} Lincoln Bedroom when she stayed there, and believed it was Lincoln. President Truman himself was once wakened by raps at the door while spending a night in the Lincoln Bedroom. Others have actually seen an apparition of the former president. The first person reported to have actually seen Lincoln's spirit was First Lady Grace Coolidge, who said she saw the ghost of Lincoln standing at a window in the Yellow Oval Room staring out at the Potomac. Winston Churchill, Theodore Roosevelt, and Maureen Reagan and her husband have all claimed to have seen a spectral Lincoln in the White House. A number of staff members of the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration claimed to have seen Lincoln's spirit, and on one occasion Roosevelt's personal valet ran screaming from the White House claiming he had seen Lincoln's ghost. Perhaps the most famous incident was in 1942 when Queen Wilhelmina of The Netherlands heard footsteps outside her White House bedroom and answered a knock on the door, only to see Lincoln in <b>frock</b> <b>coat</b> and top hat standing in front of her (she promptly fainted). Several unnamed eyewitnesses have claimed to have seen the shade of Abraham Lincoln actually lying down on the bed in the Lincoln Bedroom (which was used as a meeting room at the time of his administration), and others have seen Lincoln sit on the edge of the bed and put his boots on. The most famous eyewitness to the latter was Mary Eben, Eleanor Roosevelt's secretary, who saw Lincoln pulling on his boots (after which she ran screaming from the room).|$|E
25|$|The morning {{coat was}} {{particularly}} popular amongst fashionable younger men, and the <b>frock</b> <b>coat</b> increasingly {{came to be}} worn mostly by older conservative gentlemen.

25|$|Dress {{coats and}} morning coats, the other main knee-length coats of the period, shared the waist seam of frock coats, making them all body coats, but {{differed}} {{in the cut}} of the skirt, as the <b>frock</b> <b>coat</b> {{does not have the}} cut away front which gives dress coats and morning coats tails at the back. As was usual with all coats in the 19th century, shoulder padding (called 'American shoulders') was rare or minimal. The formal <b>frock</b> <b>coat</b> only buttons down to the waist seam, which is decorated at the back with a pair of buttons. The <b>frock</b> <b>coat</b> that buttoned up to the neck, forming a high, stand-up collar, was worn only by clergymen.|$|E

25|$|Another {{characteristic}} of <b>frock</b> <b>coats</b> was {{their lack of}} any outer pockets. Only late in the Victorian and Edwardian era were they ever made with a chest pocket to sport a pocket square, a feature more typical of the modern lounge suit. Oscar Wilde, a famous dandy of his time, was often seen in portraits wearing just such a model, but this was rather rare on frock coats; while {{in keeping with the}} flamboyant nature of Wilde's dress, it was frowned upon by traditionalists. Side pockets were always absent from <b>frock</b> <b>coats,</b> but pockets were provided {{on the inside of the}} chest.|$|R

25|$|The cut of a <b>frock</b> <b>coat</b> with a waist seam flatters a man's figure, {{as opposed}} to a sack coat, and such frock coats {{remained}} part of some 20th century military uniforms. They can either be single-breasted as in army uniforms, or double-breasted as in navy uniforms. The British Army currently retains the <b>frock</b> <b>coat</b> for ceremonial wear by senior officers of Lieutenant-General rank and above, by officers of the Household Division, by some bandmasters and by holders of certain Royal appointments.|$|E
25|$|<b>Frock</b> <b>coats</b> {{worn with}} {{waistcoat}} and formal striped trousers {{are still very}} occasionally worn as daytime formal wear, especially to weddings, {{as an alternative to}} morning coats, in order to give the wedding attire a Victorian flavour. They are today usually only worn by the wedding party, where elements of historical costume are more acceptable, and even this practice is unusual, as its role as a formal ceremonial coat in daytime formal wear has been long supplanted in modern dress code by the morning coat. Like morning <b>coats,</b> <b>frock</b> <b>coats</b> are only worn for daytime formal events before 5p.m. and no later than until around 7p.m.|$|R

2500|$|<b>Frock</b> <b>coats</b> {{remained}} fashionable, but new shorter versions arose, {{distinguished from}} the sack coat [...] by a waist seam. Waistcoats [...] (U.S. vests) were generally cut straight across the front and had collars and lapels, but collarless waistcoats were also worn.|$|R
25|$|Around the 1880s and {{increasingly}} through into the Edwardian era, {{an adaptation of}} the riding coat called a Newmarket coat (now renamed to be our 20th century morning coat) began to supplant the <b>frock</b> <b>coat</b> as daytime full dress.

25|$|Most Hasidim wear long coats called rekelekh {{during the}} week, {{which are often}} mistaken for frock coats but are really very long suit jackets.

25|$|Standard fibres {{used for}} the <b>frock</b> <b>coat</b> {{included}} wool and vicuña. The most common weave was known as broadcloth. The standard colour of a <b>frock</b> <b>coat</b> was solid black, but later, in the Victorian era, charcoal grey became an acceptable but less common alternative and Midnight Blue was an even rarer alternative colour. For business and festive occasions the revers was lined with black silk facings (either satin or grosgrain). For funerals black frock coats without self-faced revers were worn with a matching black waistcoat.|$|E
50|$|The {{suit was}} {{originally}} a 19th-century British innovation in dress: seeking a casual {{alternative to the}} long, heavy <b>frock</b> <b>coats</b> then considered appropriate business dress, men began to wear lighter coats cut just below the waist when not engaged in business.|$|R
25|$|<b>Frock</b> <b>coats</b> {{emerged during}} the Napoleonic Wars, where they were worn by {{officers}} in the Austrian and various German armies during campaign.
