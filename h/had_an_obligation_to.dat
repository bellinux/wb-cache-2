5|$|Disraeli {{justified}} {{his ideas}} by {{his belief in}} an organic society in which the different classes have natural obligations to one another. He saw society as naturally hierarchical and emphasised the obligation of those at the top to those below. This was based in the feudal concept of noblesse oblige, which asserted that the aristocracy <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> be generous and honourable; to Disraeli, this implied that government should be paternalistic. Unlike the New Right, one-nation conservatism takes a pragmatic and non-ideological approach to politics and accepts the need for flexible policies; one-nation conservatives have often sought compromise with their ideological opponents {{for the sake of}} social stability. Disraeli justified his views pragmatically by arguing that, should the ruling class become indifferent to the suffering of the people, society would become unstable and social revolution would become a possibility.|$|E

25|$|After {{months passed}} without an agreement, a harsh {{war of words}} erupted in the media in February 2007. The Twins angrily {{cancelled}} a planned unveiling of the ballpark design scheduled for February 15, declaring that the entire project was in jeopardy. Jerry Bell of the Twins and Mike Opat of Hennepin County gave multiple interviews in which they described the land owners as being “unwilling sellers,” “greedy,” “lawyered-up,” painted them as “greedy landowners in black hats,” and as not negotiating in good faith. Lambrecht and Pogin continued to insist that they <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> their investors to secure nothing more than “fair market value” for the land. They repeatedly {{said that they would}} accept whatever valuation was determined in eminent domain proceedings, while media reports would later reveal their internal valuation (required by eminent domain laws) to be $65 million.|$|E

25|$|In December 2005, {{relatives}} {{of the victims of}} the 1996 shelling of Qana filed a suit against Ya'alon in Washington, D.C., for his alleged role in their deaths. In late 2006, while Ya'alon was in New Zealand on a private fund-raising trip for the Jewish National Fund, Auckland District Court judge Avinash Deobhakta issued a warrant for his arrest for alleged war crimes arising from his role in the 2002 assassination of Hamas commander Salah Shehade, who was killed in a targeted assassination, when an Israeli warplane bombed his home in Gaza City. About 14 Palestinian civilians were also killed in the airstrike. Deobhakta stated that New Zealand <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> prosecute him under the Geneva Convention. Attorney-General Michael Cullen ordered a stay in the warrant after advice from the Crown Law office that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute, and the warrant was cancelled after Ya'alon left New Zealand.|$|E
25|$|TTC General Manager Rick Ducharme {{announced}} his resignation on June 7, 2006, following a one-day wildcat strike by transit workers. He blamed political interference for his decision, saying that Moscoe had conducted direct {{negotiations with the}} union without consulting him. The Toronto Star speculated that the illegal strike might have resulted from Moscoe's negotiations, while David Shiner and other councilors said that Moscoe {{had a history of}} interfering in management affairs. John Barber, a columnist for the rival Globe and Mail, argued that Ducharme's resignation was not a reasonable response to Moscoe's alleged interference. Moscoe defended his actions, arguing that he <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> take part in the discussions and was attempting to ensure that a second strike did not take place. He later said that management was to blame for the wildcat strike, and that he intervened in an attempt to stop it.|$|E
25|$|In December 2012, lawmakers were {{presented}} with a proposal to amend Article 143 of the Civil Code {{of the state of}} Chihuahua, allowing for same-sex marriage to be legal. After years with no legislative action, in July 2014, the PAN bloc announced that they would consider approving civil unions in the state, but not same-sex marriage. The LGBT community rejected the proposal because it would not provide the possibility for the spouses to share social security benefits or pensions, or other legal benefits of marriage. In response to legislative inaction, a collective injunction was filed in July 2014 with the aim of having the Civil Code declared unconstitutional. The collective injunction #3937-2014 was approved on 13 November 2014 and declared Articles 134 and 135 of the state's Civil Code unconstitutional, requiring reparations to the couples and ordering the State Congress to legislate for same-sex marriage. In early February 2015, Judge Cuenca Zamora ruled that the state of Chihuahua <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> abide by the findings of the injunction. His legal opinion was forwarded to the Parliamentary Coordination Board to begin the legislative processes to implement change in the Civil Code.|$|E

25|$|In 2003, after {{a period}} in which his own equivocal stance on the matter had drawn controversy, Constantinescu's {{successor}} Ion Iliescu established the Wiesel Commission, an international group of expert historians whose mission was the study of the Holocaust in Romania, later succeeded by the Elie Wiesel National Institute. The Final Report compiled by the Commission brought the official recognition of Ion Antonescu's participation in the Holocaust. After that moment, public displays of support for Antonescu became illegal. Antonescu's SMERSH interrogations were recovered from the Russian archives and published in 2006. Despite the renewed condemnation and exposure, Antonescu remained a popular figure: {{as a result of the}} 2006 Mari Români series of polls conducted by the national station TVR 1, viewers nominated Antonescu as the 6th greatest Romanian ever. The vote's knockout phase included televised profiles of the ten most popular figures, and saw historian Adrian Cioroianu using the portion dedicated to Antonescu to expose and condemn him, giving voters reasons not to see the dictator as a great Romanian. The approach resulted in notable controversy after Ziua newspaper criticized Cioroianu, who defended himself by stating he <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> tell the truth.|$|E

Doggett was modeled after Bud White from the 1997 feature film, L.A. Confidential. Carter had previously named Dana Scully after Los Angeles Dodgers announcer Vin Scully, and he decided to name the new character after Vin Scully's longtime broadcasting partner Jerry Doggett as an homage. Before the character got a name, he was referred to by the producers as [...] "Agent White".|$|E

500|$|Freedom From Want had {{previously}} been less entwined in the standard liberalism philosophies {{of the western world}} than the other three freedoms (speech, fear, and religion); this freedom added economic liberty as a societal aspiration. In his essay, Bulosan treats negative liberties as positive liberties by suggesting that Americans be [...] "given equal opportunity to serve themselves and each other according to their needs and abilities", an echo of Karl Marx's [...] "from each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs". [...] In the final paragraph of the essay, the phrase [...] "The America we hope to see is not merely a physical but also a spiritual and intellectual world" [...] describes an egalitarian America. [...] In a voice likened to Steinbeck's in works such as The Grapes of Wrath, Bulosan's essay spoke up for those who struggled to survive in the capitalist democracy and was regarded as [...] "haunting and sharp" [...] against the backdrop of Rockwell's feast of plenty. It proposed that while citizens had obligations to the state, the state <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> provide a basic level of subsistence. Unlike Roosevelt, Bulosan presented the case that the New Deal had not already granted freedom from want as it did not guarantee Americans the essentials of life.|$|E

[...] Governments and reformers argued that labour in factories must be regulated and the state <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> provide welfare for poor. Legislation that followed had the effect of moving work out of factories into urban homes. Families and women, in particular, preferred it because it allowed them to generate income while taking care of household duties.|$|E
