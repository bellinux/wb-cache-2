5|$|At night, Francis spies on Dr. Caligari and observes {{what appears}} to be Cesare {{sleeping}} in <b>his</b> <b>box.</b> However, the real Cesare sneaks into Jane's home as she sleeps. He raises a knife to stab her, but instead abducts her after a struggle, dragging her through the window onto the street. Chased by an angry mob, Cesare eventually drops Jane and flees; he soon collapses and dies. Francis also confirms that the caught criminal has been locked away and could not have been the attacker. Francis and the police investigate Dr. Caligari's sideshow and realize that the 'Cesare' sleeping in the box is only a dummy. Dr. Caligari escapes in the confusion. Francis follows and sees Caligari go through the entrance of an insane asylum.|$|E

Don Juan Triumphant is performed, and the Phantom makes his entrance (having secretly replaced the lead) with Christine. Raoul can do nothing but watch from <b>his</b> <b>box</b> as Christine falls for the Phantom yet again. However, she once again removes his mask, revealing his deformities to the entire audience, who scream in fear. He escapes with her by dropping the chandelier and setting the opera house on fire.|$|E

25|$|In 2007, Modi {{refused to}} allow the IAS officer Mahendra Surana watch a match at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium, because he {{believed}} Suarana to be an associate of the Rungta faction of RCA.

500|$|Family friend John T. Ford opened 1,500-seat Ford's Theatre on November 9 in Washington, D.C. Booth {{was one of}} {{the first}} leading men to appear there, playing in Charles Selby's The Marble Heart. In this play, Booth portrayed a Greek {{sculptor}} in costume, making marble statues come to life. Lincoln watched the play from <b>his</b> <b>box.</b> At one point during the performance, Booth was said to have shaken his finger in Lincoln's direction as he delivered a line of dialogue. Lincoln's sister-in-law was sitting with him in the same presidential box where he was later slain; she turned to him and said, [...] "Mr. Lincoln, he looks as if he meant that for you." [...] The President replied, [...] "He does look pretty sharp at me, doesn't he?" [...] On another occasion, Lincoln's son Tad saw Booth perform. He said that the actor thrilled him, prompting Booth to give Tad a rose. Booth ignored an invitation to visit Lincoln between acts.|$|E

500|$|Tony Curtis had {{to fight}} for the role of Sidney Falco because Universal, the studio to which he was contracted, was worried that it would ruin his career. Tired of doing pretty-boy roles and wanting to prove that he could act, Curtis got his way. Orson Welles was {{originally}} considered for the role of J. J. Hunsecker. Mackendrick wanted to cast Hume Cronyn because he felt that Cronyn closely resembled Walter Winchell, the basis for the Hunsecker character in the novelette. Lehman makes the distinction in an interview that Winchell was the inspiration for the version of the character in the novelette, and that this differs from the character in the film version. United Artists wanted Burt Lancaster in the role because of <b>his</b> <b>box</b> office appeal and his successful pairing with Curtis on Trapeze. [...] Robert Vaughn was signed to a contract with Lancaster's film company and was to have played the Steve Dallas role but was drafted into the Army before he could begin the film.|$|E
500|$|Travolta's manager Jonathan Krane {{denied that}} the Church of Scientology was playing any part in the production: [...] "I've never even dealt with or talked to the church on this. This is an action-adventure, science-fiction story. Period. The movie {{has nothing to do}} with Scientology." [...] Krane stated that the film had been financed [...] "without a dollar coming from the Scientologists." [...] Some people in Hollywood feared that Travolta was using <b>his</b> <b>box</b> office draw to promote Scientology teachings, and one film {{producer}} stated, [...] "This film could encourage kids to embrace the whole strange world of Scientology." [...] Travolta stated, [...] "I'm doing it because it's a great piece of science fiction. This is not about Hubbard. I'm very interested in Scientology, but that's personal. This is different." [...] In a separate interview Travolta commented on the perceived similarities between Battlefield Earth and Scientology: [...] "Well, they are kind of synonymous… L. Ron Hubbard is very famous for Scientology and Dianetics. On the other hand, he's equally as famous in the science fiction world. So for people to think that… look, I don't want everybody to try Scientology. I don't really care if somebody thinks that. I'm not worried about it. You can't be. The truth of why I'm doing it is because it's a great piece of science fiction. I'm going to be the wickedest 9-foot alien you've ever seen in your life." ...|$|E
500|$|When Dewey Phillips first aired [...] "That's All Right" [...] on Memphis radio, many {{listeners}} who {{contacted the}} station by phone and telegram {{to ask for}} it again assumed that its singer was black. From {{the beginning of his}} national fame, Presley expressed respect for African American performers and their music, and disregard for the norms of segregation and racial prejudice then prevalent in the South. Interviewed in 1956, he recalled how in his childhood he would listen to blues musician Arthur Crudup—the originator of [...] "That's All Right"—"bang <b>his</b> <b>box</b> the way I do now, and I said if I ever got to the place where I could feel all old Arthur felt, I'd be a music man like nobody ever saw." [...] The Memphis World, an African American newspaper, reported that Presley, [...] "the rock 'n' roll phenomenon", [...] "cracked Memphis's segregation laws" [...] by attending the local amusement park on what was designated as its [...] "colored night". Such statements and actions led Presley to be generally hailed in the black community during the early days of his stardom. By contrast, many white adults, according to Billboards Arnold Shaw, [...] "did not like him, and condemned him as depraved. Anti-negro prejudice doubtless figured in adult antagonism. Regardless of whether parents were aware of the Negro sexual origins of the phrase 'rock 'n' roll', Presley impressed them as the visual and aural embodiment of sex." ...|$|E

500|$|Bede {{died on the}} Feast of the Ascension, Thursday, 26 May 735, on {{the floor}} of his cell, singing [...] "Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit" [...] and was buried at Jarrow. Cuthbert, a disciple of Bede's, wrote a letter to a Cuthwin (of whom nothing else is known), {{describing}} Bede's last days and his death. According to Cuthbert, Bede fell ill, [...] "with frequent attacks of breathlessness but almost without pain", before Easter. On the Tuesday, two days before Bede died, his breathing became worse and his feet swelled. He continued to dictate to a scribe, however, and despite spending the night awake in prayer he dictated again the following day. At three o'clock, according to Cuthbert, he asked for a box of his to be brought, and distributed among the priests of the monastery [...] "a few treasures" [...] of his: [...] "some pepper, and napkins, and some incense". That night he dictated a final sentence to the scribe, a boy named Wilberht, and died soon afterwards. The account of Cuthbert does not make entirely clear whether Bede died before midnight or after. However, by the reckoning of Bede's time, passage from the old day to the new occurred at sunset, not midnight, and Cuthbert is clear that he died after sunset. Thus, while <b>his</b> <b>box</b> was brought at three o'clock Wednesday afternoon the 25th, {{by the time of the}} final dictation it might be considered already Thursday in that ecclesiastical sense, although the 25th in the ordinary sense.|$|E
