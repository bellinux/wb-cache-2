40|$|An extreme-ultraviolet {{radiation}} source {{based on a}} xenon pinch plasma is discussed {{with respect to the}} demands on a radiation source for <b>extreme-ultraviolet</b> <b>lithography.</b> Operation of the discharge in a self-igniting-plasma mode and omitting a switch permits a very effective and low-inductive coupling of the electrically stored energy to the electrode system. The xenon plasma exhibits broadband emission characteristics that offer radiation near 11 and 13 nm. Both wavelengths are useful in combination with beryllium- and silicon-based multilayer mirrors. The plasma emits approximately 74 mW/sr at 11. 5 nm and 40 nW/sr at 13. 5 nm in a bandwidth of 2 per cent when operated at a repetition frequency of 120 Hz. The source size is less than 500 mu m in diameter (FWHM) when viewed from the axial direction. The pulse-to-pulse stability is better than 3. 6 per cent. First results with a repetition rate of as much as 6 kHz promise the possibility of scaling to the required emission power for <b>extreme-ultraviolet</b> <b>lithography...</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{new high}} repetitive, compact and low cost gas {{discharge}} based EUV "lamp" {{has been studied}} {{as an alternative to}} laser-produced plasmas as EUV sources. First results using oxygen in a fast discharge of electrically stored energy around 1 J lead to a conversion efficiency of about 0. 1 per cent for the emission at 13. 0 nm which is suited for the use with Mo/Si-multilayer mirrors. Using Xenon a broadband emission in the investigated wavelength range from 10 nm to 18 nm is observed. With a first version a source with 40 W electrical input power could be demonstrated that emits about 50 mW/(4 pisr) around 13 nm at a repetition rate of 150 Hz. No debris and no electrode erosion was observed after more than 10 (exp 7) pulses done up to now.

40|$|Single layer anti-reflection {{coatings}} {{are often}} {{assumed to be}} limited to minimize reflection in a narrow bandwidth around a specific wavelength. In this paper we show that there are in principle no fundamental restrictions for single layer anti-reflection coatings to exhibit broadband suppression. We present theoretically derived design rules for an anti-reflection coating for the spectral range of 100 − 400 nm, applied here on top of a molybdenum-silicon multilayer mirror as commonly used in <b>extreme-ultraviolet</b> <b>lithography.</b> The design rules for optimal suppression are found to be strongly dependent on the thickness and optical constants of the coating. As a proof of principle, thin films were deposited that exhibit optical constants close to the design rules for suppression around 300 nm. In order to minimize EUV absorption losses, we used silicon based compounds which are relatively transparent to EUV radiation. SixCyNz layers were deposited by electron beam co-deposition of silicon and carbon, with N+ ion implantation during growth. The thin films were analyzed with variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry to characterize the optical constants. The results show that the optical constants of SixCyNz films can be engineered to match those specified by the design rules. This work illustrates that a single layer anti-reflection coating can be used to achieve broadband suppression using appropriately tailored optical constants...|$|E

Consequently, the patterned nanostructures are limited in size by lithographic features as well as the presence of defects that result from these processes [18]. The self-limiting inverted-pyramid templating approach proposed by Biasiol and co-authors [19] requires an additional ex situ processing step, but it results in better nanostructure uniformity, since it overcomes the intrinsic randomness of the nucleation process while maintaining high crystal quality at the interface.|$|R

40|$|Laser {{produced}} plasma {{sources are}} considered attractive for high-volume <b>extreme-ultraviolet</b> (EUV) <b>lithography</b> {{because of their}} high power at the target wavelength 13. 5 nm. However, besides the required EUV light, {{a large amount of}} infrared (IR) light from the CO 2 drive laser is scattered and reflected from the plasma {{as well as from the}} EUV mirrors in the optical system. Since these mirrors typically consist of molybdenum and silicon, the reflectance at IR wavelengths is even higher than in the EUV, which leads to high energy loads in the optical system. One option to reduce this is to structure the EUV multilayer, in particular the collector mirror, with an IR grating that has a high IR-suppression in the zeroth order. In this paper, the characterization of such an optical element is reported, including the IR-diffraction efficiency, the EUV performance (reflectance and scattering), and the relevant surface roughness.

A new anode concept for electron-impact hard x-ray sourcesbased on high-speed liquidmetal jets has been introduced.

40|$|The {{lifetime}} of Mo/Si multilayer-coated projection optics {{is one of}} the outstanding issues on the road of commercialization of <b>extreme-ultraviolet</b> <b>lithography</b> (EUVL). The application of Mo/Si multilayer optics in EUVL requires both sufficient radiation stability and also the highest possible normal-incidence reflectivity. A serious problem of conventional high-reflective Mo/Si multilayers capped by silicon is the considerable degradation of reflective properties due to carbonization and oxidation of the silicon surface layer under exposure by EUV radiation. In this study, we focus on titanium dioxide (TiO 2) and ruthenium dioxide (RuO 2) as promising capping layer materials for EUVL multilayer coatings. The multilayer designs as well as the deposition parameters of the Mo/Si systems with different capping layers were optimized in terms of maximum peak reflectivity at the wavelength of 13. 5 nm and longterm stability under high-intensive irradiation. Optimized TiO 2 -capped Mo/Si multilayer mirrors with an initial reflectivity of 67. 0 % presented a reflectivity drop of 0. 6 % after an irradiation dose of 760 J/mm 2. The reflectivity drop was explained by the partial oxidation of the silicon sub-layer. No reflectivity loss after similar irradiation dose was found for RuO 2 -capped Mo/Si multilayer mirrors having initial peak reflectivity of 66 %. In this paper we present data on improved reflectivity of interface-engineered TiO 2 - and RuO 2 -capped Mo/Si multilayer mirrors due to the minimization of both interdiffusion processes inside the multilayer stack and absorption loss in the oxide layer. Reflectivities of 68. 5 % at the wavelength of 13. 4 nm were achieved for both TiO 2 - and RuO 2 -capped Mo/Si multilayer mirrors. Entnommen aus TEMA</a...|$|E
40|$|Here we {{conduct a}} mask-roughness-induced line-edge-roughness (LER) aberrations {{sensitivity}} study {{both as a}} random distribution amongst the first 16 Fringe Zernikes (for overall aberration levels of 0. 25, 0. 50, and 0. 75 nm rms) {{as well as an}} individual aberrations sensitivity matrix over the first 37 Fringe Zernikes. Full 2 D aerial image modeling for an imaging system with NA = 0. 32 was done for both the 22 -nm and 16 -nm half-pitch nodes on a rough mask with a replicated surface roughness (RSR) of 100 pm and a correlation length of 32 nm at the nominal <b>extreme-ultraviolet</b> <b>lithography</b> (EUVL) wavelength of 13. 5 nm. As the ideal RSR value for commercialization of EUVL is 50 pm and under, and furthermore as has been shown elsewhere, a correlation length of 32 nm of roughness on the mask sits on the peak LER value for an NA = 0. 32 imaging optic, these mask roughness values and consequently the aberration sensitivity study presented here, represent a worst-case scenario. The illumination conditions were chosen based on the possible candidates for the 22 -nm and 16 -nm half-pitch nodes, respectively. In the 22 -nm case, a disk illumination setting of {sigma} = 0. 50 was used, and for the 16 -nm case, crosspole illumination with {sigma} = 0. 10 at an optimum offset of dx = 0 and dy =. 67 in sigma space. In examining how to mitigate mask roughness induced LER, we considered an alternate illumination scheme whereby a traditional dipole's angular spectrum is extended in the direction parallel to the line-and-space mask absorber pattern to represent a 'strip'.

Characterization of the near-normal incidence EUV reflectance was performed using synchrotron radiation from the Advanced Light Source at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Stringent requirements were met for these multilayer coatings in terms of reflectance, wavelength matching among the different optics, and thickness control across the diameter of each individual optic. Reflectances above 65 % were achieved at 13. 35 nm at near-normal angles of incidence. The run-to-run reproducibility of the reflectance peak wavelength was maintained to within 0. 4 %, providing the required wavelength matching among the seven multilayer-coated optics.

Substrates with high-resolution groove or hole patterns were prepared with <b>extreme-ultraviolet</b> interference <b>lithography</b> (EUV-IL). Particle arrays with low defect density were achieved by adapting the deposition conditions (particle concentration, pH, dip speed and orientation). The experimental findings are explained with a model that describes the relative influences of the contributing forces in the assembly process.

40|$|In {{the push}} towards commercialization of <b>extreme-ultraviolet</b> <b>lithography</b> (EUVL), meeting the {{stringent}} requirements for line-edge roughness (LER) is increasingly challenging. For the 22 -nm half-pitch node and below, the ITRS requires under 1. 2 nm LER. Much of this LER {{is thought to}} arise from three significant contributors: LER on the mask absorber pattern, LER from the resist, and LER from mask roughness induced speckle. The physical mechanism behind the last contributor is becoming clearer, but how it {{is affected by the}} presence of aberrations is less well understood. Here, we conduct a full 2 D aerial image simulation analysis of aberrations sensitivities of mask roughness induced LER for the first 37 fringe zernikes. These results serve as a guideline for future LER aberrations control. In examining how to mitigate mask roughness induced LER, we next consider an alternate illumination scheme whereby a traditional dipole's angular spectrum is extended in the direction parallel to the line-and-space mask absorber pattern to represent a 'strip'. While this illumination surprisingly provides merely minimal improvement to the LER as several alternate illumination schemes, overall imaging quality in terms of ILS, NILS, and contrast is improved. While the 22 -nm half-pitch node can tolerate significant aberrations from a mask roughness induced LER perspective, total aberration levels for the 16 -nm half-pitch node need to be strictly capped at 0. 25 nm rms to meet the ITRS guidelines. An individual aberrations study for the first 37 fringe zernikes on the 16 -nm half-pitch node at the 0. 25 nm rms level reveals a sensitivity to various forms of spherical aberrations (Z 9 & Z 25) and quadrafoil (Z 28) in particular, under conventional crosspole illumination ({sigma} = 0. 10).

Soft x-ray water-window microscopy is a powerful technique for high-resolution imaging of organic materials exploiting the natural contrast mechanism between carbon and oxygen, cf. Sect. 4. 1. The thesis discusses the components of, as well as the integration of the microscope, including liquid-jet laser-plasma x-ray sources, optics, simulations, and image-processing tools. Liquid-jet-target laser-plasma sources for generation of soft x-rays and extreme-ultraviolet radiation are compact sources with high brightness. The work focused on improved target stability, decreased debris, and accurate source characterization. For x ray microscopy applications a liquid-jet target delivery system allowing cryogenic liquids was developed. Source characterization was performed for two different liquid-jet targets: Methanol and liquid nitrogen. For <b>extreme-ultraviolet</b> <b>lithography</b> applications, the potential use of a liquid-tin-jet laser-plasma source was explored including conversion efficiency and debris measurements. High quality optics are essential in the development of compact x-ray microscopes. For soft x-ray wavelengths, zone plates and multilayer mirrors are used to focus or redirect radiation. This thesis {{describes the}} development and characterization of a condenser zone plate suitable for use in a compact soft x-ray microscope operating at λ = 2. 478 nm. It also investigates the possibility to perform differential interference contrast microscopy in the water window using a single diffractive optical element. An arrangement for rapid and accurate determination of absolute and local diffraction efficiency of soft x-ray zone plates using a compact laser-plasma source has been developed. The instrument is used to characterize the zone plates fabricated at the Biomedical & X-Ray Physics division at KTH. Through a collaboration with the Fraunhofer-Institut in Jena, Germany, a large diameter spherical Cr/Sc multilayer mirror, suitable as condenser in the compact x-ray microscope, was developed and characterized. The mirror is designed for λ = 3. 374 nm and shows a high, and uniform reflectivity of 3 %. This increases the photon flux by an order of magnitude compared to the W/B 4 C mirrors previously used.

40|$|As <b>extreme-ultraviolet</b> <b>lithography</b> (EUVL) {{approaches}} introduction at the 22 -nm half-pitch node, {{several key}} aspects of absorber height effects remain unexplored. In particular, sidewall angle (SWA) restrictions based on {{the height of the}} mask absorber has not yet been clearly defined. In addition, the effects of absorber height on line-edge roughness (LER) from shadowing has not been examined. We make an initial investigation into how tight SWA constraints are {{and the extent to which}} shadow LER alters basic LER. Our approach to SWA aims to find SWA restrictions based on 10 % of the total CD error budget (10 % of CD). Thus, we allot the SWA budget a {+-} 0. 2 nm tolerance for 22 nm half-pitch. New with EUVL is the off-axis illumination system. One potential pitfall that must be carefully monitored is the effect of mask absorber height blocking light from reaching, and therefore, correctly detecting, the base edge position of a feature. While mask features can correctly compensate sizing to target at the wafer, the effects of this shadowing on LER have not yet been investigated. Specifically, shadow LER may exacerbate or mitigate the inherent LER on the mask. Shadowing may also cause a difference in the observed LER on the right and left side of the features. We carefully probe this issue for a range of spatial frequencies. We do rigorous aerial image modeling of mask features with a nominal SWA of 80 degrees and correctly sized to target 22 nm features measured at the top, 70 nm TaN absorber on a 40 bilayer ML mirror with a 2. 5 nm Ru cap. Simulations were on a 4 X system with an ideal pupil of NA = 0. 32, illumination wavelength 13. 4 nm at 6 {sup o} off-axis, and disk source shape with partial coherence factor of {sigma} = 0. 50. We first implement a defocus offset to the aerial image so that best focus lies at a nominal zero defocus value. We then calculate the depth of focus (DOF) for which the image-log-slope (ILS) delivers a contrast is greater than 50 %, an arbitrary standard for a good quality photoresist to print. Using this DOF, we optimize the process window and adjust the intensity threshold from it's nominal value to a new optimal value. From this optimized intensity threshold, we calculated the aerial image CD through focus for a range of angles around the nominal SWA value. From this, we can find out how much the SWA needs to be constrained by in order to keep the {+-} 10 % CD error budget tolerance required. For SWA of 80 degrees, we found the nominal SWA is tightly constrained by 0. 5 degrees. We repeated these calculations for other nominal values of SWA 85 and 88 degrees, and found that CD sensitivity to nominal SWA is relatively independent. In examining shadow LER, we use FDTD simulations to obtain a rigorous solution for the source intensity immediately after the patterned TaN mask absorber pattern on a 2. 5 nm Ru capped 40 bilayer ML mirror. The optical system was comprised of an ideal pupil map, NA = 0. 32, 13. 4 nm light at 4 {sup o} off-axis, and annular source shape with partial coherence factor of {sigma} = 0. 35 - 0. 55. We assumed a 90 {sup o} SWA. For the basic 2 D shape of the mask that we exactly replicated through height, we created mask LER by generating a sine wave of full amplitude 4 nm, equivalent to 4 nm LER, (wafer dim.), confined along it's length to precisely CD= 22 nm, for sine waves with spatial frequencies (full period) of 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175, and 200 nm (wafer dim.), and illuminated at both {phi}= 0 {sup o} (perpendicular, shadowing) and {phi}= 90 {sup o} (parallel, no shadowing). Results show that even off-axis illumination perpendicular to the lines and spaces gives minimal difference between the left and right LER to at most 0. 1 nm difference at best focus. We followed up this study by repeating the data for a mask designed with 2 nm LER with similar results. A plot of the transfer functions for LER of both 2 nm and 4 nm compared to the contrast of simple 50 % duty cycle lines and spaces shows that LER has a unique transfer function as well as a linear response to LER amplitude. In the course of our investigation of SWA, we found that the nominal angle has no effect on process window size, and neither does sensitivity on changing angle alter as a function of nominal angle. For nominal 80 {sup o}, 85 {sup o}, 88 {sup o} SWA, the amount of angle tolerance for 0. 2 nm change in CD was in total 0. 5 {sup o}. For shadow LER, we found minimal difference between left and right LER when illuminated perpendicularly to the pattern, to at most 0. 1 nm LER at best focus. CTFs confirm the uniqueness and linearity of an LER transfer function as opposed to the traditional MTF, as shown in a previous study. In the future we wish to expand our work on shadow LER into the regime where the k{sub 1 }-factor of the optic is stressed. In particular, 16 nm lines and spaces on an NA = 0. 32 optic with off-axis illumination...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} thorough investigation of how mask roughness induces speckle in the aerial image that leads to line-edge roughness (LER) effects in extreme ultraviolet lithography. As next generation lithography techniques such as <b>extreme-ultraviolet</b> <b>lithography</b> (EUVL) push to ever smaller critical dimensions, achieving the stringent requirements for line-edge and -width roughness (LER/LWR) is increasingly challenging. For this reason, discovering the principle causes leading to LER demands immediate attention. Until recently, LER has been considered a resist-limited effect. Now, however, it is better understood that system-level effects can greatly influence LER. Thus, {{in order to achieve}} adequately low LER levels for next generation projection lithography, we must understand not only the basic material properties of the resist, but also how resist effects and mask effects can each contribute to the LER that is ultimately printed. Much research has already been conducted to fully characterize photo-resists available to next generation lithography methods. Other studies have documented how the LER on the mask couples to the printed LER. The issue of mask roughness induced LER is one that has up to this point been neglected by the industry and requires attention from the International Roadmap of Semiconductors (ITRS) in its specifications tables for the successful manufacture of transistor devices in future nodes by EUVL. Specifically, the extent to which system-level effects such as mask surface roughness, defocus, and illumination conditions are currently factoring into LER limits and how to distinguish mask effect from resist effect in practice. Potential levels for mask roughness induced LER contribution are presented for realistic mask surface roughnesses, providing a strong motivation for this work. To be precise, for the 22 nm half pitch nodes, the mask roughness induced LER can consume the entire LER budget for an ideal mask roughnesses at - 100 nm defocus. This thesis focuses on characterizing requirements on mask surface roughness specifications from an LER budget perspective in future nodes where EUVL will likely be employed, and devising simplified models based on 2 D thin mask modeling for mask roughness induced LER prediction. A 2 D height map of mask surface roughness itself is characterized by mainly two statistical parameters: the first being replicated surface roughness (RSR), which describes the height deviations of roughness on the top surface of the mask, and the second being the correlation length, which {{is a measure of the}} lateral surface roughness. The corresponding phase map is constructed by a simple transformation of OPD into phase space with an additional factor of 2 for EUVL reflective mode. The simplified model is then constructed using thin mask modeling of that clearfield rough mask to calculate the resulting speckle statistics, which are an intensity perturbation, and uses fast 1 D modeling of the image-log-slope (ILS) to map that intensity perturbation to line-edge movement (LER). This is then verified against fully simulated LER, also in the thin mask approximation. The power of this simplified model lies in the simple physicality of the formulation, elucidating the principle causes of mask roughness induced LER: poor speckle, and bad imaging quality (ILS). The formulation also provides a significant speed enhancement by removing modeling redundancy of multiple feature types on top of the same surface roughness characterizations: only one clearfield speckle simulation is needed for the speckle statistics, which can then be mapped to any feature size through the ILS, and be used by the simplified equation to predict the mask roughness induced LER. The second simplified model is based on a geometric argument of mask slope error, for special cases of mask surface roughness that are globally smooth. In this regime, the mask roughness induced LER collapses to a single value trend across all illumination partial coherence values- hence a geometric regime. Recognizing this fact, the further simplification employs the point spread function (PSF) of the optical system assuming full incoherence, convolved with the rough mask object, to give a simple image of the mask from the wafer plane. Taking the slope of that image and propagating through focus, the mask roughness induced LER contribution can be readily predicted for this geometric limit, and provides an even further speed enhancement to modeling by reducing the redundancy of illumination partial coherence type. Beyond developing simplified models, characterizations of problematic aberrations are made extensively for the 22 nm and 16 nm half-pitch nodes. This is firstly done through random distributions across the principle Zernike aberrations (Fringe Zernikes 5 - 16) to determine the overall acceptable level of aberrations in the system of 0. 25 nm rms from a mask roughness induced LER perspective. A complete aberration sensitivity matrix is then constructed to identify individual Zernikes that are problematic, specific to the node, source shape, and optical system. In addition, mask roughness induced LER mitigation strategies utilizing an alternative source shape called `strip' illumination, or, extended dipole, is explored. By using the physicality of the simplified model's equation, we recognize that by increasing incoherence by extending a traditional dipole laterally should help mitigate the speckle, while at the same time, confined coherence orthogonal to the lines and spaces should maintain good imaging quality through the ILS. Thus, overall, the simplified model would predict a reduction in mask roughness induced LER. We compare these results to other illumination candidates specifically for the 22 nm node and find that overall, the mask roughness induced LER does benefit minimally for about 0. 2 nm LER for 100 nm defocus conditions, but there lies a significant potential benefit in throughput in comparison to traditional dipole illuminations if one is employing limiting source shapes to manufacture the partial coherence. Lastly, this work studies potential mask roughness induced LER effects introduced by mask cleaning strategies employed for EUVL. We look at effects on lithographic performance of lines and spaces, LER, and contacts based on a repetitive cleaning process and monitor that performance through number of cleans. Overall, we find that the cleaning process does not introduce significant deterioration of the cleaned mask in comparison to a reference mask, up through a 33 × cleaning cycle. Since EUVL expects to employ cleans through 22 × over the typical lifetime of a mask, the 33 × good performance confirms the viability of the cleaning process within a safe margin...|$|E
