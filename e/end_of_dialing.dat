50|$|At the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> 2005, Citadel Broadcasting {{moved the}} station from the 107.5 MHz {{frequency}} to the stronger and farther reaching 101.9 MHz frequency. Even {{though they were}} no longer at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>dial,</b> they retained the name.|$|R
50|$|KWQC's {{audio signal}} {{transmitted}} on a frequency of 87.76 MHz (+10 kHz shift) and {{was picked up}} on the lower <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>dial</b> on most FM radios in most of the Quad Cities until 11:59 p.m. on June 12, 2009. As of 11:59 p.m. on June 12, 2009, the station's main programming is no longer heard on 87.75 MHz on FM radios.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the crowded}} state <b>of</b> the noncommercial <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the FM <b>dial</b> {{in the northeastern}} United States, the four New Jersey Public Radio {{stations}} all operate at relatively low power. None has an ERP greater than 4,000 watts.|$|R
50|$|WCNH {{operates}} at only 190 watts {{due to the}} crowded state <b>of</b> the noncommercial <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the FM <b>dial</b> in New England. Its coverage area is effectively limited to Concord and surrounding areas of Merrimack County. To {{make up for the}} shortfall in coverage, it is simulcast on sister station WEVO's second HD channel.|$|R
5000|$|WCSH's {{digital signal}} on UHF channel 44 signed on in 2002, {{bringing}} high definition network television to the area. WCSH's broadcasts became digital-only, effective June 12, 2009 and began providing a [...] "nightlight" [...] service. Until that date, the station's analog audio signal transmitted on a frequency of 87.75 MHz (+10 kHz shift). As a result, {{it could be}} {{picked up on the}} lower <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>dial</b> on most FM radios at 87.7 MHz. This was true of all other analog channel 6 stations in the United States. The station often promoted this additional way of coverage. After the transition, the station continued its digital broadcasts on channel 44.|$|R
5000|$|The station {{went on the}} air as KRYT on 1986-03-24. The calls {{reflected}} the station nickname [...] "K-Right," [...] as 107.9 is at the far right <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the FM <b>dial.</b> On 1988-12-01, the station changed its call sign to KRYT-FM, on 1993-04-01 to the current KDZA-FM. KDZA-FM had an oldies format prior to June 24, 2008, when it switched to a Classic Hits format known as Jet 107.9.|$|R
50|$|Due to WIBW's {{location}} {{near the}} bottom <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the AM <b>dial</b> and Kansas' flat terrain (with near-perfect ground conductivity), the station's 5,000-watt signal easily covers most of the Kansas City metropolitan area during the day, and provides city-grade coverage {{to most of the}} eastern half of Kansasâ€”as far west as Wichita. It provides at least grade B coverage as far north as Omaha and Lincoln and as far south as Tulsa.|$|R
50|$|Unlike its {{television}} counterpart, NJN Radio covered mainly southern New Jersey, {{with only}} two transmitters {{in the northern part}} of the state. Due to the crowded state <b>of</b> the noncommercial <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the FM <b>dial</b> in the northeastern United States, the nine stations all operate at relatively low power. Much of the programming came from NPR, with a simulcast of the audio of the television network's NJN News following All Things Considered.|$|R
50|$|KRIS-TV {{shut down}} its analog signal, over VHF channel 6, {{at noon on}} June 12, 2009, the {{official}} date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition VHF channel 13. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former VHF analog channel 6. This transmitted on a frequency of 87.75 MHz (+10 kHz shift), and as a result, could be {{picked up on the}} lower <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>dial</b> on most FM radios at 87.7. This was true of all other analog channel 6 stations in North America. This is no longer possible for full-powered stations after the conversion to digital broadcasting.|$|R
50|$|Adolph Dial died on December 24, 1995. By the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> his life, <b>Dial</b> {{suffered}} complications due {{to heart}} disease, diabetes and cancer. His last years were also marked by blindness, onset from his diabetes; despite this, Dial {{was able to}} identify people by their voices and body shapes. He was 73 years of age at his time of death. He is buried next to his first wife Ruth Jones Dial in the cemetery at Prospect United Methodist Church.|$|R
50|$|In 2013, New Beginnings Fellowship Church withdrew an {{application}} for an LPFM radio station after receiving permission from an attorney representing Roy Henderson, the licensee of KJIB-LP, to build and operate broadcast facilities for KJIB-LP and KVDO-LP. It was represented to church officials that the Channel 5 analog license for KJIB-LP could be easily modified to operate on Channel 6, thus allowing listeners to hear the audio portion of the TV channel at the lower <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the FM <b>dial.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The station's analog video {{broadcast}} at a frequency of 83.26 MHz AM. The station's analog audio was aired at a frequency of 87.76 MHz FM. Both frequencies were +10 kHz {{shift from the}} center channel 6 frequency to prevent interference with stations in Albany, New York, Portland, Maine, and Philadelphia who were also on channel 6. WLNE's analog audio could be {{picked up on the}} lower <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>dial</b> on most FM radios at 87.7 MHz. WLNE regularly mentioned this additional way of coverage. This was true of all analog channel 6 stations in the United States. After February 17, 2009, channel 6 audio on WLNE was no longer available on the radio. (It was still available on most other full-powered channel 6 stations in the United States through June 12.) ...|$|R
5000|$|The studios {{used to be}} at 1803-1805 Broadway between {{downtown}} Lubbock and Texas Tech University, {{but were}} relocated in 1953 when consolidated into the new KCBD-TV facilities at 5600 Avenue A. In 1971, KCBD radio was spun off to Lew Dee and 20 local businessmen. Call letters changed to KEND. The format had been adult middle of the road. Lew Dee changed the format to a more contemporary [...] "The Living End" [...] as KEND (The <b>End</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Dial).</b> The station had business reversals. Management traded too many things in too many deals and developed tax problems. The station was required in those days to use transmitter site operating engineers or update its equipment and procedures to permit remote control operation. Both were costly, and neither was done.|$|R
50|$|A year later, Senator Arthur Capper, {{publisher}} of Topeka's daily newspaper, the Topeka Daily Capital, asked Kansas State {{to share the}} 580 frequency with his new station, WIBW. Kansas State agreed, realizing {{that it could not}} afford to stay on the air for 24 hours a day. In 1948, KSAC boosted its broadcasting power to 5,000 watts, matching its commercial partner. Due to its location on the lower <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the AM <b>dial,</b> this gave it coverage of most of the state. The station was off the air at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> 1950 and early 1951 after losing its transmitter to fire.|$|R
50|$|Adamson {{starred in}} a West <b>End</b> {{production}} <b>of</b> <b>Dial</b> M for Murder from November 1983 to March 1984 which also featured Simon Ward and Hayley Mills. The play was successful. In {{the summer of}} 1984 he read some short stories on BBC Radio 4. In February and March 1985 Adamson was based in Cambridge {{when he had a}} part in Entertaining Mr Sloane and in the spring of 1985, he played the leading role of an actor-manager of a troupe of music hall entertainers {{on the eve of the}} First World War in Empires by J.B. Priestley. After stage and television work in Canada in 1986 and in 1987, including a guest role in the detective drama Adderly he returned to the UK and played Sir Tunbelly Clumsy in a revival of The Relapse at the Mermaid Theatre in the Autumn of 1988, but his drinking and reputation meant that acting roles became increasingly rare after that.|$|R
50|$|KNNN-LP (known as Hella 87.7) is an indie and {{alternative}} rock radio station and low-power television station based in Redding, California, broadcasting locally in analog TV on VHF channel 6. Founded September 16, 2003 by Venture Technologies Group, LLC, {{it is now}} owned by Hella Meada Group LLC of Redding. The station currently operates and markets itself as a radio station using the audio portion of NTSC channel 6 (87.75 MHz) to broadcast audio (most FM radio receivers can receive this frequency at 87.7 on the low <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the FM <b>dial).</b>|$|R
5000|$|In 2001, {{the station}} would {{relocate}} from 980 AM to 620 AM, {{shortly after the}} original CKCK radio closed down. [...] The move gave CKRM access to the second-most powerful transmitting facility in Saskatchewan, {{and one of the}} largest coverage areas in North America. Due to its location on the lower <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the AM <b>dial,</b> transmitter power, and Saskatchewan's flat land (with near-perfect ground conductivity), CKRM now covered most of Saskatchewan's densely populated area, as well as parts of North Dakota and Montana. CJME, formerly at 1300 AM, took CKRM's former spot.|$|R
50|$|The NARBA {{frequency}} realignment of 1941 saw {{the station}} relocate to 1490 AM. During this time, their antenna was located near present-day Forest Hills Park on South Street. WDNC's last broadcast from this site came on February 28, 1948. On the next day, which was Leap Day, WDNC abandoned its 1490 dial position and 250-watt signal {{for a new}} three-tower directional array on Shocoree Drive in western Durham which operated with 5,000 watts daytime and 1,000 watts nighttime at a new frequency on the other <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>dial,</b> 620 AM. Leap Day 1948 {{turned out to be}} a very eventful day in Durham broadcasting history: As WDNC fired up their new, more powerful plant, they also signed on WDNC-FM, at 105.1 MHz. Making the day even more memorable was that WDNC's old 1490 dial position was immediately occupied by a new station, WSSB (now WDUR).|$|R
5000|$|Bundle was {{attractive}} to men. Towards the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> The Seven <b>Dials</b> Mystery, she received two proposals of marriage, the first from the George Lomax, a pompous cabinet minister, {{only five years}} younger than her father, who was known behind his back as [...] "codders" [...] (alluding to his eyes) and was described incongruously as [...] "His Majesty's permanent sic Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs". Lomax's unctuous self-assessment of his suitability as a husband, and of the role he saw for Bundle, had {{much in common with}} Mr Collins' unsuccessful wooing of Elizabeth Bennet in Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (1813).|$|R
50|$|WUMB-FM {{operates}} as a noncommercial public radio-style station which carries some NPR programming. HD Radio technology allows WUMB to transmit a high-quality digital signal. Due to the crowded state <b>of</b> the noncommercial <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the FM <b>dial</b> in New England, WUMB operates at a modest 160 watts, effectively limiting its coverage area to Boston itself and its innermost suburbs. To widen its signal, it operates a network of seven repeater stations across eastern Massachusetts and southern New Hampshire. WUMB-FM can also be heard on the Internet at both low bit rate for those with dial up connection and in stereo for those with broadband service.|$|R
500|$|Regarding the interior, {{the seats}} drew praise for their comfort and detail design. However, again, Car {{provided}} a {{counterpoint to the}} effect that the Volvo was as roomy, despite its shorter wheelbase. The steering wheel was criticized in the same review for being too close to the driverÂ´s legs. The ventilation temperature control was [...] "not satisfactory" [...] due to an unprogressive response at the cool <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>dial.</b> There was no fan-blown cold air (cold air was by ram-effect) nor an option for cool air to be directed to the face {{at the same time as}} warmth being directed into the footwells. According to Car [...] the ventilation [...] "fell down badly" [...] on account of its awkward controls. Oddment accommodation was [...] "disappointment". Lacking a self-setting stay, opening the bonnet was [...] "heavy work" [...] and the boot, while large, had the demerit of an [...] "unusual" [...] locking method: [...] " [...] is locked before being shut by pushing in a red handle set in the inside of the lid".|$|R
50|$|When an area {{is given}} a new area code under a split plan, the area's {{previous}} area code {{would no longer be}} valid for calls in the area, so calls to numbers using the old area code will not work. To alleviate misdialing frustration, the local routing can be set up such that both the old and new area codes will work for the same telephone exchange. During this period, the local numbering authority must not reassign the area's existing exchanges to the remaining area of the old area code, nor vice versa. At the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the permissive <b>dialing</b> period, the old area code is no longer valid for numbers in the affected area.|$|R
50|$|WUWM {{signed on}} the air in September 1964. Originally a student laboratory, it took on a more {{professional}} look with the formation of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. It was a charter member of NPR in 1971. However, its signal was spotty at best outside of Milwaukee's East Side. That changed in 1978, when WITI donated space on its tower, giving it a fairly decent signal throughout the Milwaukee area. Originally limited to 1,500 watts due to a glut of stations on the lower <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the FM <b>dial</b> in the Chicago-Milwaukee-Madison axis, a change in FCC regulations allowed it to eventually increase its power to 15,500 watts, giving it a signal comparable to the other major stations in Milwaukee.|$|R
50|$|The station's {{transmitter}} {{is situated}} atop the First Watchung Mountain in West Orange, New Jersey. Due to the crowded state <b>of</b> the noncommercial <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the FM <b>dial</b> {{in the northeastern}} United States, {{as well as the}} need to protect WNYE at nearby 91.5, the station operates at a relatively modest 1,250 watts. Still, it easily covers most of northern New Jersey, with at least grade B coverage across the Hudson in New York City. WFMU has a repeater station, WMFU (formerly WXHD), in Mount Hope, New York, broadcasting at 90.1 MHz in the Hudson Valley, the Lower Catskills, western New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania. In January 2013, WFMU opened an additional repeater station, W220EG (formerly W219DQ), in New City, New York, broadcasting at 91.9 MHz covering Rockland County.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1950s and early 1960s, as the {{transistor}} radio became popular, especially {{with young people}} who could carry radios with them everywhere, rock and roll solidified as a genre, thanks in large measure to {{what became known as}} top 40 radio. In New York, four stations battled in the category: WMCA, WMGM, and WABC and WINS. While WMCA was only 5000 watts, it was at the bottom <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>dial,</b> which advantages coverage. The other three were all 50000 watts, but only WABC was both non-directional and a clear channel station. Being lower on the dial than the others, it also had more coverage. Of those three, WINS was the most directional (aimed straight at New York's inner boroughs), with a weaker signal than the others toward the New Jersey suburbs and the Jersey Shore. In 1962, WMGM defected to a beautiful music format under its previous call letters, WHN, while WINS was purchased by the Westinghouse Electric Corporation. WMCA became the top-rated top 40 station in the New York area by 1963, then WABC became the dominant Top 40 station in the whole market by 1965. WINS bowed out of Top 40 competition with the song [...] "Out in the Streets", by The Shangri-Las, on April 18, 1965, at around 8 PM.|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, WTIC in Hartford dropped its {{longtime}} classical music format {{in favor of}} adult contemporary music, and sold its library to CPTV. Looking {{for a way to}} put the library to use, CPTV decided to get into radio. At the time, while Hartford got a fairly decent signal from WFCR in Amherst, Massachusetts and much of southwestern Connecticut was covered by WNYC-AM-FM in New York City, {{most of the rest of}} the state didn't even get a grade B signal from an NPR station. New Haven, for instance, had to content itself with a translator of WFCR on 90.5 FM. Finding available frequencies proved difficult, however. In addition to the crowded state <b>of</b> the noncommercial <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the FM <b>dial</b> in the Northeast, there was a considerable glut of 10-watt stations in the state. Ultimately, CPTV bought the 90.5 frequency from the Friends of WFCR, the New Haven group that owned the WFCR translator, and used it as the linchpin for what would become Connecticut Public Radio.|$|R
