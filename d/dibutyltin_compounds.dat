50|$|Tetrabutyltin is the {{starting}} material of the tributyltin and <b>dibutyltin</b> <b>compounds.</b> It is produced by the reaction of tin(IV) chloride with 1-chlorobutane. This reaction involves either the Grignard reaction, the Wurtz reaction, or butyl aluminium compounds. Pure SnBu4 can be mixed with tin(IV) chloride to form tributyltin chloride and dibutyltin chloride. These tin compounds are starting materials {{for a wide range}} of organotin compounds used as stabilizers for PVC, biocides, fungicides, and anti-biofouling agents.|$|E
40|$|The {{fluorescence}} of tin(IV) complexed by 8 -hydroxyquinoline- 5 -sulfonic acid (8 -HQSA) {{has been}} studied in both aqueous and hydroorganic (acetate buffer and dimethylsulfoxide) media. Several experimental parameters such as pH, DMSO/water ratio and reactant concentration have been investigated to increase the fluorescence of the tin(IV) - 8 -HQSA complex. A linear relationship between tin(IV) concentration and fluorescence intensity was observed between 1. 7 and 20 microM). Mechanistic and quantitative studies {{in the presence of}} surfactants have been performed. Judiciously selected micellar media permitted solubilisation and quantitation of tin(IV) as well as <b>dibutyltin</b> <b>compounds.</b> A linear relationship between concentration and fluorescence intensity was found for mono-, di- and tributyltin with detection limits of 0. 1 microM, 0. 7 microM and 1 microM, respectively.

40|$|<b>Dibutyltin</b> (DBT) <b>compounds</b> {{are used}} {{primarily}} as stabilizers for polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastics. Small quantities can {{be released from}} PVC containers into stored liquids. The neurotoxicological potential of DBT was tested in aggregating brain cell cultures after a 10 -day treatment with concentrations ranging from 10 (- 10) to 10 (- 6) m, either during an early developmental period, or during a phase of advanced maturation. Changes in protein content, DNA labelling and cell type-specific enzyme activities were measured as end points. DBT caused general cytotoxicity at 10 (- 6) m in both immature and differentiated cultures. At 10 (- 7) m, it affected the myelin content and the cholinergic neurons in both states of maturation, while GABAergic neurons remained unchanged. Astrocyte and oligodendrocyte markers were diminished at 10 (- 7) m of DBT exclusively in immature cultures. DBT uptake by undifferentiated and differentiated cells was similar at this concentration. Whereas trimethyltin (TMT) is known to induce gliosis and triethyltin (TET) to cause demyelination and affect GABAergic neurons, DBT appeared to be more toxic than TMT, and to present a distinct toxicological pattern...|$|R
40|$|The {{levels of}} {{tributyltin}} (TBT) and <b>dibutyltin</b> (DBT) <b>compounds</b> were measured by gas chromatography ion-trap mass spectrometry (GC–MS/MS) in natural and cultured mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) {{from the northern}} Adriatic Sea in spring 2003. The highest (725 ng g− 1 dry weight) and lowest levels (198 ng g− 1 dryweight) of butyltins (TBT+DBT) were found in nativemussels from the Lagoon of Venice,with the higher values being detected in specimens collected next to a dockyard and the lower values in specimens from a location characterized by strong water exchanges between the lagoon and the Adriatic Sea. The two cultured samples exhibited intermediate concentrations, with marine harvested samples being more contaminated than those from the lagoon. Concentrations of TBT were {{higher than those of}} DBT for several reasons: the limited capability of bivalves to metabolize TBT and their ability to accumulate it (with recent input of TBT into the environment as TBT-based anti-fouling paints being the most important contributor of organotin contamination in our study area); and higher lipophilicity of TBT than DBT. In order to find correlations between organotin pollution and the state of nourishment of the mussels, the condition index was also evaluated as the mass ratio of meat dry weight to shell dry weight. There was no correlation between condition index and butyltin concentrations. These results indicate that condition index could not give information about stress conditions, as the contamination level is probably too low to cause significant reductions in mussel growth...|$|R
40|$|Cancer {{is one of}} {{the main}} causes of {{mortality}} and morbidity in world. New compounds are currently being synthesized to combat this disease. The organotins are gaining more attention as anti-cancer agents due to their potent cytotoxicity properties. In this study, a series of newly synthesized organotins namely dimethyltin (IV) (<b>compound</b> 1), <b>dibutyltin</b> (IV) (<b>compound</b> 2) and triphenyltin (IV) benzylisopropyldithiocarbamate (compound 3) were assessed for their cytotoxic activities against human Chang liver cells and hepatocarcinoma HepG 2 cells. The cytotoxicity of these organotins in both cells upon 24 h treatment was assessed using 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Compound 2 and 3 exhibited potent cytotoxic activities towards both cells where the IC 50 values were less then 10 M. The IC 50 value for compound 2 was 2. 5 M in Chang liver cells and 7. 0 M in HepG 2 cells whereas compound 3 exhibited an IC 50 value of 1. 5 M in Chang liver cells and 2. 5 M in HepG 2 cells. Therefore, compound 2 and 3 were more toxic against human Chang liver cells as compared to hepatocarcinoma HepG 2 cells. Interestingly, compound 1 did not have any IC 50 value in both cells and hence can be classified as non-toxic. In conclusion, organotin (IV) benzylisopropyldithiocarbamate with insertion of dibutyl and triphenyl functional group possess potent cytotoxicity properties. Structural modification of these compounds can be carried out in further studies to produce less or non toxic effects towards normal human cell...|$|R
40|$|A {{possible}} butyltin contamination {{source in}} wine was studied in this paper. Agglomerated cork stoppers, which were produced in Portugal, Spain, and Italy, used in wine bottles were examined. The domestic cork products, cork granules, and mucus used for cork products were also analyzed. The levels of mono- and <b>dibutyltin</b> <b>compounds</b> in corks {{were found in}} the range from < 0. 0024 to 3. 3 and from < 0. 0029 to 6. 7 mug of Sn/g, respectively. A low level of tributyltin contamination was also found in 2 of 31 tested samples. The presence of butyltin compounds in agglomerated cork stoppers was confirmed by GC-MS. Experimental results indicated that all overseas agglomerated cork stoppers studied contained mono- and/or dibutyltins. Butyltins were not detected in cork granules, mucus, most of the natural cork stoppers, and domestic agglomerated cork products. The concentrations of mono- and dibutyltins increased with the time in a 30 -day experiment, showing that butyltin compounds can leach from agglomerated cork to the wine. When the butyltin concentrations in wine samples were compared with their levels in the corresponding agglomerated cork stoppers, a correlation was found. The potential harm of such food contamination was evaluated by the toxic research of butyltin compounds using Daphnia sp. as the experimental model...|$|E
40|$|Tributyltin (TBT) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{deleterious}} compounds introduced into natural environment by humans. The ability of Cunninghamella echinulata to degrade tributyltin (TBT) (5 mg l- 1) as well as the effect of the xenobiotic on fungal amino acids composition and proteins profile were examined. C. echinulata removed 91 % of the initial biocide concentration and formed less hazardous <b>compounds</b> <b>dibutyltin</b> (DBT) and monobutyltin (MBT). Moreover, the fungus produced a hydroxylated metabolite (TBTOH), in which the hydroxyl group was bound directly to the tin atom. Proteomics analysis showed that in the presence of TBT, the abundances of 22 protein bands were changed and the unique overexpressions of peroxiredoxin and nuclease enzymes were observed. Determination of free amino acids showed significant changes in the amounts of 19 from 23 detected metabolites. A parallel increase in the level of selected amino acids such as betaine, alanine, aminoisobutyrate or proline and peroxiredoxin enzyme in TBT-containing cultures revealed that TBT induced oxidative stress in the examined fungus.
