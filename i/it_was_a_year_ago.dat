5000|$|In an {{interview}} in Circumnavigator magazine, published for PAE in October 2009, company president Dan Streech said [...] We’ve seen our once proud order book shrink to {{less than half of}} what <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>ago,</b> partly from cancellations and defaults by buyers—but mostly because we’ve been building, shipping, and delivering the boats faster than we have been receiving orders. When you’re not selling as many new boats and not taking as many deposits, cash flow slows. We remain fundamentally debt free and intend to stay that way, but less cash coming in the door means doing more with less. PAE’s three owners have taken a 33.3 per cent cut in pay, and every other PAE employee has taken a 10 per cent reduction in pay. We have asked our partner factories to help us shoulder the burden, and they’re carrying their share of the load. We’re also asking our vendors—those great companies who make all the equipment on every Nordhavn—to lend a hand as well with better pricing, and they have risen to the challenge. In addition, we’re tightening our belts and cutting overhead where it hurts the least. Everyone recognizes that these are extraordinary times, and we also recognize that pulling together is what it takes.|$|E
5000|$|Before the June 28 game in {{the desert}} against the resurgent Arizona Diamondbacks (50-28, , 2nd in NL West), the Cardinals optioned the {{struggling}} hitting-and-fielding SS Aledmys Diaz to AAA, purchased the contract of utility infielder Alex Mejia, and cleared the 40-man spot for Mejia by transferring starter RHP Alex Reyes to the 60-day DL. Diaz' OPS+ of 80 is 54 points lower than <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>ago,</b> and his slugging percentage has dropped from [...]510 to [...]396. He has struck out more frequently, walked less often, and not shown the same discipline that made him so successful last year. Diaz has swung and missed at 14% of the pitches outside the strike zone. That's five percentage points higher than last year. Diaz's [...]260 batting average would be much lower if not {{for his ability to}} beat out 21 infield hits. His minus-9 Defensive Runs Saved ranked second worst in the Majors among players with at least 250 innings played at short. Matheny said the Cardinals will prioritize work for Diaz at short in Memphis, though getting him exposure at other infield spots hasn't been ruled out. With Diaz gone, the Cardinals are likely to give rookie Paul DeJong a heavy dose of work at short. Greg Garcia and Mejia, who is considered an above-average defensive shortstop, will also be options. Mejia, a fourth-round Draft pick in 2012, has fluctuated between AA Springfield and AAA Memphis for the last three seasons.

Most of all, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> that convinced us that the artistic and economic opportunities in our business are much greater than we could have imagined just Ñve years ago.

Considerable uncertainties remain in these forecasts. Oil- and mineral exporters are likely to take a severe first hit, as collapsing commodity prices translate to reduced export revenues and foreign direct investments are paralyzed. Two additional flows that connect Africa to the global economy, where impact is harder to predict, are aid and remittances. This note explores how these flows have reacted in OECD countries during previous episodes of severe financial crises. It is shown that if these past episodes serve as a guide to the present, then a considerable reduction is to be expected. Remittances would react immediately, while the impact on aid would be lagged but being more prolonged. Given that projection, the critical need for more of accountability in international aid commitments is discussed...|$|E
