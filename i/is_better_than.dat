5|$|Like solid {{chlorine}} and iodine, solid bromine crystallises in the orthorhombic crystal system, in a layered lattice of Br2 molecules. The Br–Br {{distance is}} 227pm (close to the gaseous Br–Br distance of 228pm) and the Br···Br distance between molecules is 331pm within a layer and 399pm between layers (compare the van der Waals radius of bromine, 195pm). This structure means that bromine {{is a very}} poor conductor of electricity, with a conductivity of around 5×10−13Ω−1cm−1 just below the melting point, although this <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> the essentially undetectable conductivity of chlorine.|$|E
5|$|Statistician Jeff Sonas, in {{examining}} data from 266,000games played between 1994 and 2001, concluded that White scored 54.1767% plus 0.001164 times White's Elo rating advantage, treating White's rating advantage as +390 if it <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> +390, or −460 {{if it is}} worse than −460. He found that White's advantage is equivalent to 35 rating points, i.e. if White has a rating 35points below Black's, each player will have an expected score of 50%. Sonas also found that White's advantage is smaller (53%) in rapid games than in games at a slower ("classical") time control. In the 462 games played at the 2009 World Blitz Chess Championship, White scored only 52.16% (W38.96 D26.41 L 34.63).|$|E
