5|$|Widgiemoolthalite {{occurs as}} a {{secondary}} mineral. It is found overlaying nickel sulfide that has undergone weathering, often in hollow spaces on gaspéite surfaces, and often exhibiting fibrous and rarely massive crystal habits. Other minerals associated with widgiemoolthalite include annabergite, carrboydite, dolomite, glaukosphaerite, hydrohonessite, kambaldaite, magnesite, nepouite, nullaginite, olivenite, otwayite, paratacamite, pecoraite, reevesite, retgersite, and takovite. Two additional unnamed minerals were also reported as associated secondary minerals from the 132 North site, the only locality at which widgiemoolthalite has been found. The 132 North waste pile from which widgiemoolthalite was first recovered {{is no longer}} in existence, making it a rare mineral. In support of the designation of an Anthropocene epoch, the existence and provenance of widgiemoolthalite, along with 207 other mineral species, have been cited as evidence of uniquely <b>human</b> <b>action</b> upon global stratigraphy.|$|E
5|$|In {{the seventh}} century, Isidore of Seville argued in his Etymologiae that {{astronomy}} described {{the movements of}} the heavens, while astrology had two parts: one was scientific, describing {{the movements of the}} sun, the moon and the stars, while the other, making predictions, was theologically erroneous. In contrast, John Gower in the fourteenth century defined astrology as essentially limited to the making of predictions. The influence of the stars was in turn divided into natural astrology, with for example effects on tides and the growth of plants, and judicial astrology, with supposedly predictable effects on people. The fourteenth century sceptic Nicole Oresme however included astronomy as a part of astrology in his Livre de divinacions. Oresme argued that current approaches to prediction of events such as plagues, wars, and weather were inappropriate, but that such prediction was a valid field of inquiry. However, he attacked the use of astrology to choose the timing of actions (so-called interrogation and election) as wholly false, and rejected the determination of <b>human</b> <b>action</b> by the stars on grounds of free will. The friar Laurens Pignon (c. 1368–1449) similarly rejected all forms of divination and determinism, including by the stars, in his 1411 Contre les Devineurs. This was in opposition to the tradition carried by the Arab astronomer Albumasar (787-886) whose Introductorium in Astronomiam and De Magnis Coniunctionibus argued the view that both individual actions and larger scale history are determined by the stars.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{predictive}} modeling framework for human-involved complex systems in which humans play controlling roles. Affordance theory provides definitions of <b>human</b> <b>actions</b> and their associated properties, and the affordance-based Finite State Automata (FSA) model {{is capable of}} mapping the nondeterministic <b>human</b> <b>actions</b> into computable components in modeling formalism. In this paper, we further investigate the role of perception in <b>human</b> <b>actions</b> and examine the representation of perceptual elements in affordance-based modeling formalism. We also propose necessary and sufficient conditions for mapping perception-based <b>human</b> <b>actions</b> into systems theory to develop a predictive modeling formalism {{in the context of}} prospective control. A driving example is used to show how to build a formal model of humaninvolved complex system for prospective control. The suggested modeling frameworks will increase the soundness and completeness of a modeling formalism as well as can be used as guide to model human activities in a complex system. ...|$|R

We test the proposed approach on two datasets of <b>human</b> <b>actions</b> where binary silhouettes are available: ViHASi (synthetic data) and Weizmann (real data). In addition, on Weizmann dataset, we combine features based on optical flow with the associated binary silhouettes. The results show that thanks to the use of RBM-based models, very informative and shorter feature vectors can be obtained for the classification tasks, improving the classification performance.

Deliberate <b>human</b> <b>actions</b> that cause loss to a retail company can be theft, fraud, vandalism, waste, abuse, or misconduct. Inadvertent <b>human</b> <b>actions</b> attributable to loss are poorly executed business processes, where employees fail to follow existing policies or procedures - or cases in which business policies and procedures are lacking.
