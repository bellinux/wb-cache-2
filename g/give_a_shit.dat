[...] He later said, of the People offer, [...] "I don't <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>shit</b> ... I only take pride in things I've actually done myself.

500|$|The two {{brothers}} had often argued, and {{earlier in the}} decade, studio employees claimed they saw Harry chase Jack through the studio with a lead pipe, shouting, [...] "I'll get you for this, {{you son of a}} bitch" [...] and threatening to kill him. This subterfuge, however, proved too much for Harry. He never spoke to Jack again. When Harry Warner died on July 27, 1958, Jack did not attend the funeral, and he departed for his annual vacation at Cap d'Antibes. [...] Asked to respond to his brother's death, Jack said, [...] "I didn't <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>shit</b> about Harry." [...] At the same time, Jack took pride in the fact that President Dwight D. Eisenhower sent him a letter of condolence.|$|E
500|$|Adrien Begrand of PopMatters {{observed}} that [...] "here's no better song to kick things off than the masterful 'Angel of Death', {{one of the}} most monumental songs in metal history, where guitarists Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman deliver their intricate riffs, drummer Dave Lombardo performs some of the most powerful drumming ever recorded, and bassist/vocalist Tom Araya screams and snarls his tale of Nazi war criminal Josef Mengele." [...] When asked why Reign in Blood has retained its popularity, King replied: [...] "If you released Reign in Blood today, no one would <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>shit.</b> It was timing; it was a change in sound. In thrash metal at that time, no one had ever heard good production on a record like that. It was just a bunch of things that came together at once." ...|$|E

According to series creator Eric Kripke, the writers {{conceptualized}} the character as [...] "someone [...] really never come across before" [...] because, though she moves throughout the supernatural world, Bela has no interest in the [...] "altruistic or obsessed or revenge-minded motives of hunting". Writer and producer Sera Gamble summarized the writing team's characterization of Bela as a greedy [...] "mercenary that [...] just [...] <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>shit</b> about the cause". Gamble believed that Bela [...] "finds it quite amusing" [...] that the Winchesters use their knowledge of the supernatural to help people. On this aspect, Gamble added, [...] "I always suspect when someone is that blasé that there's something underneath, and we're finally getting into that".|$|E
500|$|The album debuted on the Billboard 200 {{at number}} 144. Geffen shipped {{about half of}} the initial US {{pressing}} to the American Northwest, where it sold out quickly and was unavailable for days. Geffen reputedly put production of all other albums on hold in order to fulfill demand in the region. Nevermind was already selling well but, over the next few months, the momentum increased significantly as [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit" [...] unexpectedly became more and more popular. The song's video had received a world premiere on MTV's late night alternative show 120 Minutes but it soon proved so popular that the channel began playing it during the day. The record was soon certified Gold, but the band was relatively uninterested in the achievement. Novoselic recalled, [...] "Yeah I was happy about it. It was pretty cool. It was kind of neat. But I don't <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>shit</b> about some kind of achievement like that. It's cool—I guess." ...|$|E
500|$|Lennon {{was missing}} for a {{performance}} one evening, and Fascher found him in the toilet with a woman. He broke up the tête-à-tête with a bucket of cold water which he threw over them both, and ordered Lennon onto the stage. Lennon was furious, and complained {{that he could not}} go on stage dripping wet. Fascher snapped back: [...] "I don't <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>shit,</b> you're going onstage and I don't care if you do it naked." [...] A short time later the audience was roaring with laughter. Fascher ran to see what the commotion was, and saw Lennon playing guitar, but only wearing underpants with a toilet seat around his neck. (Epstein later asked Liverpool journalist Bill Harry not to publish photos showing Lennon walking along the Reeperbahn in his underpants). Fascher's brother, Fred, sang lead vocals with the group on [...] "Be Bop A Lula", while he sang with them on [...] "Hallelujah I Love Her So", and his alliance with the Beatles continued, as he later went to work at the Star-Club.|$|E

500|$|Hunt {{approached}} the recording sessions differently than on his previous records. Rather than guiding personnel through replicating his demos for the album, he allowed {{members of his}} backing band to improvise their parts. For most songs, Hunt recorded with drummer Ruth Price, percussionist and engineer Melissa Mattey, and keyboardist and programmer Peter Dyer. Price and Dyer had auditioned {{for him at the}} Musicians Institute in Hollywood and had previously toured with Hunt. He rehearsed with Price for approximately two weeks before recording the final tracks in order to adjust to more rock-based dynamics, including a different set of tempos, chord changes, and faster time cadences, that he wanted for the songs. Price was adept in playing both loose and tight drumming styles for certain songs. Hunt and his band were inspired by recording artists Curtis Mayfield and Iggy Pop, who he said [...] "brought this kind of intelligence along with the rawness. It was really bold. They just didn't <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>shit.</b> I was like, that's the attitude that I'm feeling right now. I feel like I've finally shed the music that I grew up with." ...|$|E
500|$|Alec Mapa of The Advocate elaborates: [...] "While {{the rest}} of us were sleeping, Cher's been out there for the last four decades living out every single one of our {{childhood}} fantasies... Cher embodies an unapologetic freedom and fearlessness that some of us can only aspire to." [...] Rolling Stone Jancee Dunn wrote, [...] "Cher is the coolest woman who ever stood in shoes. Why? Because her motto is, 'I don't <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>shit</b> what you think, I'm going to wear this multicolored wig.' There are folks all over America who would, in their heart of hearts, love to date people half their age, get multiple tattoos and wear feathered headdresses. Cher does it for us." [...] Alexander Fury of The Independent wrote that Cher [...] "represents a seemingly immortal, omnipotent, uni-monikered level of fame." [...] Bego stated: [...] "No one in the history of show business has had a career of the magnitude and scope of Cher's. She has been a teenage pop star, a television hostess, a fashion magazine model, a rock star, a pop singer, a Broadway actress, an Academy Award-winning movie star, a disco sensation, and the subject of a mountain of press coverage." ...|$|E
500|$|Over {{the course}} of their career, the band's sound has also been {{described}} as alternative metal, sludge metal, doom metal, drone rock, hard rock, and alternative rock. Regarding the band's constant categorization by the media, Cantrell stated [...] "When we first came out we were metal. Then we started being called alternative metal. Then grunge came out and then we were hard rock. And now, since we've started doing this again I've seen us listed as: hard rock, alternative, alternative metal and just straight metal. I walked into an HMV the other day to check out the placement and see what's on and they've got us relegated back into the metal section. Right back where we started!". Drummer Sean Kinney rejects the grunge label, stating in a 2013 interview [...] "I mean, before we first came out there was no grunge, they hadn’t invented that word. Before they invented the word grunge we were alternative rock and alternative metal and metal and rock, and we didn’t <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>shit</b> whatever, we were a rock and roll band!". According to Mike Inez, they were always the metal stepchildren of the Seattle scene.|$|E

500|$|Davis toured relentlessly for {{two years}} while tolerating intense {{physical}} pain and difficulty walking, caused by joint pain from sickle-cell anaemia, badly damaged ankles after a 1972 car wreck, and osteoporosis in his left hip, which had been operated on a decade earlier. He had also developed nodules on his larynx that often left him short of breath, especially when playing the trumpet. To numb the pain, he became increasingly dependent on self-medicating with painkillers, cocaine, and morphine, which combined with his alcohol and recreational drug use led to mood swings; he would by turns feel vulnerable and hostile. By the end of 1974, a disappointing showing in Down Beat magazine's readers poll reinforced to Davis that his reputation had diminished. Unfazed by detractors and personal troubles, he kept his touring schedule intense. [...] "He was like the general looking at the fort {{and they had a}} moat {{and we were going to}} get in that fort", Henderson later said. [...] "That was the attitude of the band. We didn't <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>shit</b> what the critics said. People are gonna like what they like, but if you don't like it, respect it. Respect that I have the right to do what I do. Because with or without you, we're going to do it anyway." ...|$|E
500|$|Playing {{opposite}} Cagney in Maggie the Magnificent was Joan Blondell, {{who starred}} again {{with him a}} few months later in Marie Baumer's new play Penny Arcade. While the critics panned Penny Arcade, they praised Cagney and Blondell. Al Jolson, sensing film potential, bought the rights for $20,000. He then sold the play to Warner Bros., with the stipulation that they cast Cagney and Blondell in the film version. Retitled Sinners' Holiday, the film was released in 1930. Cagney was given a $500-a-week, three-week contract. In the film, he portrays Harry Delano, a tough guy who becomes a killer, but generates sympathy because of his unfortunate upbringing. This role of the sympathetic [...] "bad" [...] guy was a recurring character type for Cagney throughout his career. During filming of Sinners' Holiday, he also demonstrated the stubbornness that characterized his work attitude. He later recalled an argument he had with director John Adolfi about a line: [...] "There was a line in the show where I was supposed to be crying on my mother's breast... was 'I'm your baby, ain't I?' I refused to say it. Adolfi said 'I'm going to tell Zanuck.' I said 'I don't <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>shit</b> what you tell him, I'm not going to say that line.'" [...] They took the line out.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} {{nominated}} for Best Metal Performance at the 49th annual Grammy Awards. When asked for his thoughts on the nomination, King revealed {{that he did not}} [...] "even care", and noted that Slayer fans [...] "don't <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>shit</b> and that's {{the most important thing to}} me". The interviewer expressed his surprise at the nomination given Slayer's [...] "inflammatory" [...] lyrics, to which King replied, [...] "That would be the coolest thing, you know? To win with the shit we write about." [...] The ceremony was held on February 11, 2007, at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, with Slayer competing against Mastodon, Lamb of God, Ministry and Stone Sour. Slayer won the Best Metal Performance Grammy award, although the band was unable to attend because of a conflicting North American headlining tour. Araya commented about the win from a hotel room in Columbus, Ohio: [...] "Jeff [...] and I put a lot into 'Eyes of the Insane' so we're thrilled that the Grammy voters took the time to listen to it, and then vote for it. We're out here on the road and we're all really, really happy." [...] King disagreed, deeming the song [...] "one of the poorest representations of us [...] on the record [...] ". He further said that, if given the decision, he would have chosen the controversial track [...] "Jihad" [...] to represent Slayer from their ninth album Christ Illusion. Critical of the Recording Academy, King said, [...] "Realistically, I think people on the academy who vote pick the household name ... And that's what we are." ...|$|E

Chancellor Robert Hemenway fired KU Athletic Director Al Bohl, and while he cited Bohl's involvement in an academic scandal at Fresno State, many perceived the move as a desperate move to keep Williams at KU, as the relationship between Bohl and Williams was very poor. Bohl reacted angrily, accusing Williams of engineering the firing.|$|E
