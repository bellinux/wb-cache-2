5|$|In other jurisdictions, {{courts have}} applied {{standards}} {{of judicial review}} more exacting than the rational nexus test in Singapore when deciding if a law is unconstitutional. <b>It</b> <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> whether any of these approaches will be adopted locally.|$|E
5|$|In chronic {{inflammatory}} {{diseases like}} atopic dermatitis (skin), rheumatoid arthritis (joints),…, {{the side effects}} of corticosteroids are problematic because of the necessary long-term treatment. Therefore, SEGRAMs are being investigated as an alternative topical treatment. Systemic long-term treatment of inflammations with corticosteroids is particularly liable to cause metabolic side-effects, which makes the development of oral SEGRAMs an interesting goal. <b>It</b> <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> whether selective receptor agonists or modulators indeed cause significantly less side-effects than classical corticoids in clinical applications.|$|E

5|$|The bulk {{properties}} of astatine {{are not known}} with any certainty. Research is limited by its short half-life, which prevents the creation of weighable quantities. A visible piece of astatine would immediately vaporize itself because of the heat generated by its intense radioactivity. <b>It</b> <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> if, with sufficient cooling, a macroscopic quantity of astatine could be deposited as a thin film. Astatine is usually classified as either a nonmetal or a metalloid; metal formation has also been predicted.|$|E
25|$|The future segment from Aguadilla to Hatillo is {{expected}} to have four additional toll plazas; however, <b>it</b> <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> whether they will be one way or two way.|$|E
25|$|The African American Cultural Center and Museum took {{on water}} {{up to the first}} floor, and <b>it</b> <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> how much of its 1,700 {{exhibits}} can be salvaged.|$|E

50|$|Their {{second album}} was {{practically}} complete by 1996 {{but due to}} internal conflicts and persistent label conflict the band disbanded. As of 2017 <b>it</b> <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> released.|$|R
25|$|One {{individual}} of this snail {{species was}} found {{living on a}} wall in Lewisham, London, England, in 2006. <b>It</b> <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> if a colony will establish itself or not.|$|E
25|$|The future, with DRM, DAB+, DAB enabled {{mobile phones}} all now {{increasing}} and being tested, offers opportunities for radio diversification in Cornwall, but <b>it</b> <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> whether {{this will result}} in more extensive coverage of all things Cornish.|$|E
25|$|He {{continued}} {{to be in the}} Pakistani selectors' minds, playing for Pakistan against a touring England XI in 2005–06, and {{continued to}} play for Lahore Ravi and Habib Bank Limited in Pakistani domestic competitions. <b>It</b> <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> whether he can recover his solid technique and return to Test cricket as the formidable opener he was meant to be.|$|E

30|$|Now we {{prove that}} {{assumptions}} (17) and (21) imply (10) and (16). Due to equivalence (10)-(13) with (17) and (19), <b>it</b> <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> shown that (18), (20) and (21) imply (14)-(16).|$|R
50|$|Global strain is {{basically}} LV shortening/LV end diastolic length, {{which means that}} this is a normalisation of LV shortening for LV heart size. <b>It</b> <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> proven that this actually confers additional information.|$|R
25|$|Notwithstanding {{the above}} advantages, railguns {{are still very}} much at the {{research}} stage and <b>it</b> <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> whether or not railguns will ever be deployed as practical military weapons. Any trade-off analysis between electromagnetic (EM) propulsion systems and chemical propellants for weapons applications must also factor in the novelty {{and complexity of the}} pulsed power supplies that are needed in electromagnetic launcher systems.|$|E
25|$|An {{approval}} for a hospital for Crystal Lake was given by the board in Springfield, but has since met opposition. Illinois State law forbids {{the construction of new}} hospitals with less than 100 beds. The proposed Crystal Lake Hospital would hold 80-95 beds and be run by a Wisconsin corporation. Opposition from hospitals in Lake Barrington, Woodstock, McHenry, and Elgin were immediately voiced and <b>it</b> <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> just when the hospital will be built.|$|E
25|$|The Irish general union SIPTU {{established}} an Organizing Unit in 2004 and its president, Jack O'Connor, set as his objective {{the transformation of}} SIPTU - hitherto firmly committed to a servicing agenda - into an organizing union. SIPTU is also seeking {{to learn from the}} experience of the SEIU. <b>It</b> <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> how (and whether) a commitment to the organizing model of trade unionism can be reconciled with the union's traditional support for national 'Social Partnership'.|$|E

25|$|In 2004, {{the three}} {{countries}} in the region, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore, increased efforts to patrol the strait {{in an attempt to}} curb piracy. While Singapore wants international support in this effort, Indonesia and Malaysia are opposed to foreign intervention. <b>It</b> <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> whether {{the three countries}} will be able to stamp out piracy. The problem is especially acute in Indonesia. There were 325 reported pirate attacks worldwide in 2004; nine occurred in Malaysian waters, eight in Singaporean waters, and 93 in Indonesian waters.|$|E
25|$|Courts {{in several}} jurisdictions {{including}} Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and the UK {{have followed the}} Tameside decision and recognized error of material fact as a distinct ground of judicial review. In the case E v. Secretary of State for the Home Department (2004), the Court of Appeal of England and Wales set out four essential requirements that must be met {{in order for the}} ground of review to be successful. <b>It</b> <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> whether the Singapore courts will adopt this refinement of the Tameside test.|$|E
25|$|In forests where rattan grows, its {{economic}} value can help protect forest land, by providing {{an alternative to}} loggers who forgo timber logging and harvest rattan canes instead. Rattan {{is much easier to}} harvest, requires simpler tools and is much easier to transport. It also grows much faster than most tropical wood. This makes it a potential tool in forest maintenance, since it provides a profitable crop that depends on rather than replaces trees. <b>It</b> <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> whether rattan can be as profitable or useful as the alternatives.|$|E
30|$|<b>It</b> <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{assessed}} {{whether the}} involvement of synovium, bone and muscles in these disorders results from primary synovial, bone and muscle diseases or <b>is</b> secondary <b>to</b> the inflammatory involvement of the fascial system [21].|$|R

60|$|<b>It</b> <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{considered}} what principles <b>are</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> adhered <b>to</b> {{in giving}} general names, {{so that these}} names, and the general propositions in which they fill a place, may conduce most to the purposes of Induction.|$|R
25|$|In the Solar System, {{the inner}} planets are terrestrial, {{and the outer}} ones are gas giants, but discoveries of extrasolar planets suggest that this {{arrangement}} may not be at all common: numerous Jupiter-sized bodies {{have been found in}} close orbit about their primary, disrupting potential HZs. However, present data for extrasolar planets is likely to be skewed towards that type (large planets in close orbits) because they are far easier to identify; thus <b>it</b> <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> which type of planetary system is the norm, or indeed if there is one.|$|E
25|$|The {{recently}} discovered inscription for Nefertiti as queen in Regnal Year 16, if verified, {{seems to make}} clear {{she was still alive}} and still queen. What Egyptologists will make of <b>it</b> <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen,</b> but with proof of her alive in Year 16, it could be seen as supporting her candidacy as Neferneferuaten. On the other hand, advocates for Smenkhkare may make the case that since she attested as queen just before the start of Akhenaten's final regnal year, then Smenkhkare {{is more likely to be}} Akhenaten's successor.|$|E
25|$|However {{recent studies}} of {{starling}} flocks have shown that each bird modifies its position, relative to the six or seven animals directly surrounding it, no matter how close or how far away those animals are. Interactions between flocking starlings are thus based on a topological rule rather than a metric rule. <b>It</b> <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> whether this applies to other animals. Another recent study, based on an analysis of high speed camera footage of flocks above Rome and assuming minimal behavioural rules, has convincingly simulated a number of aspects of flock behaviour.|$|E
30|$|Although <b>it</b> <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{determined}} whether incidentally detected vascular pathology <b>is</b> {{significantly related}} <b>to</b> clinical outcomes and periprosthetic joint infection, understanding {{the prevalence of}} vascular pathology and associated risk factors in TKA candidates is important for successful TKA.|$|R
