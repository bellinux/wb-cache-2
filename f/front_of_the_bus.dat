5|$|The game tasks {{the player}} with {{navigating}} a bus through roads filled with alien potato beings. The player's bus holds female {{members of the}} alien race, and the player can shoot the females from the <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> in order to clear the alien potatoes. The aliens come in two colors: red and blue. Aliens are cleared from the road when two like-colored potatoes touch each other, but aliens begin to pile up in the road if two aliens hit each other that are not of the same color. The road is continuously scrolling downwards, forcing the player to make holes in the road wide enough to fit the bus through. The game can end prematurely if the player runs into too many aliens and loses all their lives.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 2005, the TTC began a pilot project to test bicycle racks on five select routes {{as a way to}} boost {{ridership}} and to be more environmentally friendly. The folding racks are installed on the <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> and can hold two bikes. In the event that both slots at the <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> are full, bicycles are allowed to be put inside buses after rush hour periods only.|$|E

25|$|Thirty-three bus routes {{comprise}} the TCAT system. Routes are identified by number {{and are usually}} indicated on a marquee at the <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus,</b> and sometimes on the side as well. TCAT's main hub is Green Street Station, off of the Commons, a two-block pedestrian mall in downtown Ithaca. Most non South Hill routes run through the Cornell University campus; East Avenue near Statler Hall is considered a secondary hub.|$|E
50|$|The K94UB was a citybus chassis {{which allowed}} low floor at <b>the</b> <b>front</b> half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> and {{a step up}} to the rear part, known in <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> {{industry}} as low-entry.|$|R

25|$|The RMF and RMA {{class were}} {{production}} {{versions of the}} front entrance Routemaster, primarily for non-London and airline use. Like the RMC/RCL they had an electrically operated door, but at the <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus,</b> along with the staircase. After being exhibited and demonstrated to other operators, the RMF attracted little interest, apart from an order from Northern General Transport Company (RMF) and, in a short version, from British European Airways (RMA).|$|E
25|$|The bus has the 1-2-2-2 door configuration. The {{end of the}} bus {{has been}} {{designed}} to the style of the tram Tramino. The bus is 18 metres long. The <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus,</b> including the roof has a more elegant and bow style making the bus look more streamline. There are covers over the wheels. The bus was fitted with Hübner lighting system which can be turned on at night to give orange lights under the bus.|$|E
25|$|The {{passenger}} {{doors are}} higher than on normal buses so that passengers can only board from designated shelters. The doors employ automated swing and slide mechanisms which is manually controlled by the driver. Currently, the slide mechanism is being phased out, with all new buses being equipped with swing doors. Protective full-height acrylic glass barriers are installed behind passenger seats close to the sliding door mechanism. Although, feeder routes uses low street-level doors. This is achieved with the driver's door at the <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> on big buses {{and a pair of}} designated hydaulic folding door on medium buses.|$|E
50|$|The L94UA (L94UA6x2/2LB) was an {{articulated}} low entry {{city bus}} chassis, which had low floor in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> {{and then a}} {{step up to the}} rear part. It was available from around 2001 {{as an alternative to the}} full low-floor N94UA, and was also the basis for <b>the</b> first generation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> articulated version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> OmniLink integral citybus.|$|R

50|$|On 7 September 2008, a bus {{on route}} 468 {{travelled}} through a red traffic signal and collided with tram 2534 in George Street, Croydon.

25|$|In {{second half}} of 2008 the Solaris Urbino 18 Hybrid model went through several levels of {{modernisation}} {{and now it is}} considered to be at the second generation by the producer. Most of the changes are that of the power system of the electric hybrid engine, making a smaller and lighter engine, the Cummins ISBe5 250B with a volume of 6.7litre and the power of 178kW. The changes meant even lower fuel consumption - the older engine has reduced fuel usage by 15% compared to purely diesel propulsion while the new engine saves 23-24%. Thanks to further optimisation the Solaris is planning to reduce fuel consumption by 30%. Due to a lighter engine, the other power systems, like the batteries and Dual Power Inverter Module which are on the roof, work at an increased rate and produce more power. Due to this the model has also undergone a makeover of the general body, such as the aerodynamics, meaning only an air conditioning module can be fitted on the <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus.</b> The estimated time for future modernisation, when new modules will be able to be added, is said to be about in 6–7 years, with an average usage of 60000km per year.|$|E
25|$|There are {{excellent}} monuments {{and pieces of}} sculpture scattered all along the city: in the streets, main buildings and green spaces such as Caronti's bust, facing the City Hall, the Memorial to Bernardino Rivadavia, at {{the centre of the}} main square, Fuente de los Ingleses and Memorial of the Israeli community, in the same square. The statue of José de San Martín, in Parque de Mayo, the sculpture group of Lola Mora in the fountain at the front of Universidad del Sur, the memorial to Giuseppe Garibaldi, the statue of Isabel I of Castile in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> station, donated by the Government of Spain (no such pieces are donated to non capital cities as it has been this case, enhancing the importance of the local Spanish descendants), the pieces which decorate the frontispieces of Banco de la Nación, Edificio Banco Provincia, {{to the side of the}} City Hall, Saint George and the Dragon of the former electrical power plant of Ingeniero White in the Port, the ones of the former building of La Nueva Provincia and those of the Cathedral are unique, as well as the modern art ones which form the group of Paseo de las Esculturas, indeed remarkable. Although not a sculpture, the mural mosaic of Colegio Don Bosco, on the corner of Vieytes and Moreno streets, by Aurelio Friedrich -a local plastic artist- is to be mentioned. All of them do enrich the architectural, artistic and cultural patrimony and heritage of the City.|$|E
500|$|Metro has {{currently}} {{awarded a}} five-year contract with NABI (now New Flyer) for the procurement of up to 654 new buses. The first batch of 85 NABI diesel-electric hybrid 42-foot buses is already on order, with delivery expected within a year. The new buses will replace some of Metro’s older Orion V, Neoplan AN460A and New Flyer C40LF buses, which were delivered in 1997-2002. Going forward, the contract gives Metro the option to order up to 498 additional 42-foot buses and up to 71 60-foot buses over the five-year period. Red/silver painted buses will be used on [...] "Local" [...] routes and blue/silver buses will be used on [...] "MetroExtra" [...] routes. These buses will have either a red stripe in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> for [...] "Local" [...] routes or a blue stripe in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> for [...] "MetroExtra" [...] routes for easy identification. The numbering represents its region of operation. To differ the regions numbering system, Maryland letter is (prefix) to the route number and Virginia letter is (suffix) to the route number. For example: C22 (Maryland) & 15L (Virginia).|$|E

These names, which often tend to obscure other details such as the route number and name, are merely decorations and do not provide information of any particular kind to commuters.|$|R
