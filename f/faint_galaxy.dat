40|$|The {{relationship}} between angular size, magnitude, and redshift of <b>faint</b> <b>galaxies</b> is explored {{as a potential}} tool to distinguish between galaxy evolutionary models. Different models, based on merging, mild luminosity evolution, and no evolution, lead to different predictions of the angular size distribution, redshift- size relation, and magnitude-size relation. The merging model predicts significantly smaller sizes for <b>faint</b> <b>galaxies</b> than the standard model, because of the requirement for more intrinsically small faint objects at high redshift. A dwarf-rich no-evolution model also predicts small sizes for <b>faint</b> <b>galaxies.</b> The mild luminosity evolution model predicts more luminous galaxies of large angular size at high redshift, as does a standard no-evolution model. Prefurbishment Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Medium Deep Survey observations of magnitudes and sizes of <b>faint</b> <b>galaxies</b> indicate an excess of small versus large <b>faint</b> <b>galaxies,</b> favoring the dwarf rich, no evolution model {{with respect to the}} merging model; the other two models are more discrepant with the data.

50|$|Christina Thöne, of the Institute of Astrophysics of Andalusia in Spain, was {{lead author}} of a paper that {{proposed}} that the burst occurred in a binary system where a neutron star orbited a normal helium star that had just entered its red giant phase, which had enormously expanded its outer atmosphere. During the expansion, the red giant star engulfed the neutron star, resulting in both the ejection of the giant's atmosphere and rapid tightening of the neutron star's orbit. Once the two stars became wrapped in a common envelope of gas, the neutron star may have merged with the giant's core after just five orbits, or about 18 months. The end result of the merger was {{the birth of a}} black hole or a magnetar and the production of oppositely directed jets of particles moving at nearly the speed of light, followed by a weak supernova. The particle jets produced gamma rays. Jet interactions with gas ejected before the merger explain much of the burst's different nature. Based on this interpretation, the event took place about 5.5 billion light-years away (redshift 0.33), and the team has detected what may be a <b>faint</b> <b>galaxy</b> at the right location.|$|E

Some of the galaxy clusters detected at 15 μm, and some others detected at 6. 75 μm which are brighter and more luminous. The size of the galaxy clusters depends on the energy radiated by the galaxies detected at 15 μm and the energy radiated by the galaxies detected at 6. 75 μm, and some of the clusters are active to star formation. The luminosity function of the clusters is proved to be old, more luminous and have the reddest galaxies.

This survey, which is complete to limiting magnitudes = 24 and = 23, samples angular scales as large as 15. <b>Faint</b> <b>galaxies</b> {{are found to be}} more weakly clustered (by a factor of at least two) compared to galaxies observed locally. Clustering amplitudes are closer to model predictions in the red than in the blue. The weak clustering of <b>faint</b> <b>galaxies</b> cannot be explained by any plausible model of clustering evolution with redshift. However, one possible explanation of the clustering properties of intermediate redshift galaxies is that they resemble those of starburst galaxies and H II region galaxies, which are observed locally to possess weak clustering amplitudes. Our clustering amplitudes are also similar to those of nearby late-type galaxies, which are observed to be more weakly clustered than early-type galaxies A simple, self-consistent model is presented that predicts the fraction of galaxies in the "excess" population at intermediate redshifts, and correctly matches observed color distributions. The available data on the clustering properties of <b>faint</b> <b>galaxies</b> are consistent with this model if the "excess" population of <b>faint</b> blue <b>galaxies</b> is also the weakly clustered population.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the evolution of}} bright and <b>faint</b> <b>galaxies</b> in fossil and non-fossil groups. We used mock galaxies constructed based on the Millennium run simulation II. We identified fossil groups at redshift zero according to two different selection criteria, and then built reliable control samples of non-fossil groups that reproduce the fossil virial mass and assembly time distributions. The <b>faint</b> <b>galaxies</b> were defined as having r-band absolute magnitudes in the range [- 16,- 11]. We analysed {{the properties of the}} bright and <b>faint</b> <b>galaxies</b> in fossil and non-fossil groups during the past 8 Gyr. We observed that the brightest galaxy in fossil groups is typically brighter and more massive than their counterparts in control groups. Fossil groups developed their large magnitude gap between the brightest galaxies around 3. 5 Gyr ago. The brightest galaxy stellar masses of all groups show a notorious increment at that time. By analysing the behaviour of the magnitude gap between the first and the second, third, and fourth ranked galaxies, we found that at earlier times, fossil groups comprised two large brightest galaxies with similar magnitudes surrounded by much <b>fainter</b> <b>galaxies,</b> while in control groups these magnitude gaps were never as large as in fossils. At early times, fossil groups in the faint population were denser than non-fossil groups, then this trend reversed, and finally they became similar at the present day. The mean number of <b>faint</b> <b>galaxies</b> in non-fossil systems increases in an almost constant rate towards later times, while this number in fossil groups reaches a plateau at z∼ 0. 6 that lasts ∼ 2 Gyr, and then starts growing again more rapidly.

This {{is consistent with the}} `down-sizing` picture in which star-formation ended at earlier times for the most massive (luminous) galaxies and more recently for less massive (<b>fainter)</b> <b>galaxies.</b> We observe a richness dependence to the down-sizing effect in the sense that, at a given redshift, the drop-off of <b>faint</b> red <b>galaxies</b> is greater for poorer (less massive) clusters, suggesting that star-formation ended earlier for galaxies in more massive clusters. The decrease in <b>faint</b> red-sequence <b>galaxies</b> is accompanied by an increase in <b>faint</b> blue <b>galaxies,</b> implying that the process responsible for this evolution of <b>faint</b> <b>galaxies</b> is the termination of star-formation, possibly with little or no need for merging.

This is in agreement with the dark matter profiles predicted by numerical simulations. The galaxy number density profile for the bright galaxies is fitted equally well with a core model or a cusped model. In contrast, the luminosity and the galaxy number density profiles of the <b>fainter</b> <b>galaxies</b> are significantly better fitted by a core rather than a cusp model. We did not detect any statistically significant different fits when applied to data in range from z= 0 to z= 0. 5.
