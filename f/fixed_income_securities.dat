25|$|Currency {{interest}} rate fluctuations: Like all <b>fixed</b> <b>income</b> <b>securities,</b> {{the prices of}} fixed rate ABS move in response to changes in {{interest rate}}s. Fluctuations in interest rates affect floating rate ABS prices less than fixed rate securities, as the index against which the ABS rate adjusts will reflect interest rate changes in the economy. Furthermore, interest rate changes may affect the prepayment rates on underlying loans that back some types of ABS, which can affect yields. Home equity loans {{tend to be the}} most sensitive to changes in interest rates, while auto loans, student loans, and credit cards are generally less sensitive to interest rates.|$|E

2500|$|Credit rating {{agencies}} began issuing ratings for mortgage-backed securities (MBS) in the mid-1970s.

2500|$|The term [...] "fixed" [...] in [...] "fixed income" [...] {{refers to}} both the {{schedule}} of obligatory payments and the amount. [...] "Fixed income securities" [...] can be distinguished from inflation-indexed bonds, variable-interest rate notes, and the like. If an issuer misses a payment on a <b>fixed</b> <b>income</b> <b>security,</b> the issuer is in default, and depending on the relevant law {{and the structure of}} the security, the payees may be able to force the issuer into bankruptcy. In contrast, if a company misses a quarterly dividend to stock (non-fixed-income) shareholders, there is no violation of any payment covenant, and no default.|$|R
40|$|This study {{analyses}} and compares various Principal Component-based methods of <b>fixed</b> <b>income</b> <b>security</b> immunization.

We show that the Principal Component-based methods are not effective for hedging short-term securities.

30|$|The {{yield curve}} or term {{structure}} {{of interest rates}} is {{the relation between the}} (level of) interest rate (or cost of borrowing) and the time to maturity of the debt for a given borrower in a given currency. The yield curve forms the basis for the valuation of all <b>fixed</b> <b>income</b> instruments, because the price of a <b>fixed</b> <b>income</b> <b>security</b> can be calculated as the net present value of the stream of cash flows, and each cash flow has to be discounted using the zero coupon interest rate for the associated term to maturity. The term structure of interest rates as the interception of macroeconomics and finance has increasingly been employed as a means of explaining the upward slope of the yield curve and the bond premium puzzle [see Gürkaynak and Wright (2012) for a survey on macroeconomics and the term structure or Lange (2013) and Pericoli and Taboga (2012) for recent specific examples]. Accordingly, <b>fixed</b> <b>income</b> portfolio managers, central bankers and market participants apply econometric models to achieve a better representation of the evolution of interest rates, in the view that these models are useful decision-orienting tools for their purposes.|$|R

40|$|We {{assess and}} analyze the three {{components}} of active management (asset allocation, market timing and security selection) {{in the performance of}} pension funds. Security selection explains most of the differences in pension fund returns. Large pension funds in our sample on average provide value to their clients after accounting for all investment-related costs, both before and after risk-adjusting: we find an annual alpha of 17 basis points from changes in asset allocation, 27 basis points from market timing, and 45 basis points from security selection. All three active management components exhibit significant liquidity limitations, which are important in all asset classes, including equity and <b>fixed</b> <b>income.</b> <b>Security</b> selection outperformance is largely driven by momentum trading. Accounting for momentum reduces the security selection alpha by about 72 basis points and offsets most of the positive risk-adjusted returns from market timing and asset allocation changes. Larger funds realize economies of scale in their relatively small allocation to private asset classes, like private equity and real estate. However, in equity and <b>fixed</b> <b>income</b> markets they experience substantial liquidity-related diseconomies of scale...|$|R
