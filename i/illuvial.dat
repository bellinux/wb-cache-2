50|$|Illuvium is {{material}} displaced {{across a}} soil profile, from one layer to another one, by {{the action of}} rainwater. The removal of material from a soil layer is called eluviation. The transport of the material may be either mechanical or chemical. The process of deposition of illuvium is termed illuviation. It is a water-assisted transport in a basically vertical direction, as compared to alluviation, the horizontal running water transfer. The resulting deposits are called <b>illuvial</b> deposits. Cutans are a type of <b>illuvial</b> deposit.|$|E

50|$|Spodic soils {{refer to}} a {{diagnostic}} subsurface horizon defined by the <b>illuvial</b> accumulation of organic matter. Iron oxide can be present or absent, and the soil is generally derived from a sandy parent material. Spodic may also refer to the taxonomic soil order spodosols.|$|E
50|$|The 2 great {{groups of}} Luvisolic soils are {{distinguished}} {{mainly on the}} basis of soil temperature. Gray Brown Luvisols have a dark Ah horizon in which organic matter has been mixed with the mineral material (commonly by earthworm activity), a brown, often platy eluvial horizon (Ae) and an <b>illuvial</b> horizon (Bt) in which blocky structure is common. Their mean annual soil temperature is 8 °C or higher. The major area of Gray Brown Luvisols is found {{in the southern part of}} the Great Lakes-St Lawrence Lowlands. Gray Luvisols have eluvial and <b>illuvial</b> horizons and may have an Ah horizon if the mean annual soil temperature is below 8 °C. Vast areas of Gray Luvisols in the Boreal Forest Zone of the Interior Plains have thick, light grey eluvial horizons underlying the forest litter and thick Bt horizons with clay coating the surface of aggregates.|$|E

50|$|There {{are three}} main flora zones in the Rukwa Valley: the {{treeless}} grass plains, a belt of open woodland, and the escarpment area. Valley grassland and wooded grassland are differentiated by the <b>illuvial</b> {{soil of the}} former and the colluvial soil of the latter. The woodland is partly covered by acacia. The northern end of Lake Rukwa encompasses a wetland of papyrus and reed.|$|E
50|$|The {{process of}} removal of {{materials}} from geological or soil horizons is called eluviation or leaching. There {{is a difference}} in the usage of this term in geology and soil science. In soil science, eluviation is the transport of soil material from upper layers of soil to lower levels by downward precipitation of water across soil horizons, and accumulation of this material (<b>illuvial</b> deposit) in lower levels is called illuviation. In geology, the removed material is irrelevant, and the deposit (eluvial deposit) is the remaining material. Eluviation occurs when precipitation exceeds evaporation.|$|E
5000|$|These soils have eluvial horizons {{from which}} clay has been leached after {{snowmelt}} or heavy rains and <b>illuvial</b> horizons in which clay has been deposited; these horizons are designated Ae and Bt respectively. In saline or calcareous materials, clay translocation is preceded by leaching of salts and carbonates. Luvisolic soils occur typically in forested areas of subhumid to humid climate where the parent materials contain appreciable clay. Luvisolic soils cover about 809 000 km2 (8.8%) of Canada's land area. Large areas of Luvisolic soils {{occur in the}} central to northern Interior Plains; smaller areas in all regions south of the permafrost zone.|$|E
5000|$|In podzols, [...] {{has meant}} the {{eluviation}} of clays, humic acids, iron, and other soluble constituents from the A and E horizons. These constituents may then accumulate {{to form a}} spodic <b>illuvial</b> horizon {{and in some cases}} a placic horizon or iron band. Podzolization occurs when severe leaching leaves the upper horizon virtually depleted of all soil constituents except quartz grains. Clay minerals in the A horizon decompose by reaction with humic acids and form soluble salts. The leached material from the A horizon is deposited in the B horizon as a humus-rich horizon band, a hard layer of sesquioxides or a combination of the two.|$|E
50|$|A duripan is a {{diagnostic}} soil horizon of the USDA soil taxonomy that is cemented by <b>illuvial</b> silica into a subsurface hardpan. Similar to a fragipan, Petrocalcic Horizon and petrogypsic horizon, it is firmly cemented and restricts soil management. In soil descriptions, {{they are most}} often denoted by the symbol Bqm. The closest equivalent in the Canadian system of soil classification is called a duric horizon, although {{it does not mean}} exactly the same thing as a duripan in the United States. They form almost exclusively in arid or Mediterranean climates, and can be as hard as concrete, which makes plowing very difficult or impossible. Soils that include duripans are generally used for grazing or wildlife habitat, and are seldom cultivated.|$|E
50|$|Red soil {{is a type}} of {{soil that}} {{develops}} in a warm, temperate, moist climate under deciduous or mixed forests, having thin organic and organic-mineral layers overlying a yellowish-brown leached layer resting on an <b>illuvial</b> red layer. Red soils are generally derived from crystalline rock. They are usually poor growing soils, low in nutrients and humus and difficult to cultivate because of its low water holding capacity.Red soils denote the third largest soil group of India covering an area of about 3.5 lakhs sq. km (10.6% of India's area) over the Peninsula from Tamil Nadu in the south to Bundelkhand in the north and Rajmahal hills in the east to Katchch in the west. They surround the black soils on their south, east and north.|$|E
5000|$|Loess {{deposits}} {{with lime}} nodules {{are found in}} the <b>illuvial</b> horizons of soils that formed on loess and loess-like loams. In the soil profile, the nodules stand out as bright spots with a clear and rounded shape. The size of spots is 1-2 cm in diameter, which is comparable to the size of an eye, and, more specifically, to that of the species of birds known as White-eye. Thus, the name [...] "White-eye" [...] for loess with lime nodules may have been derived from their comparison to these birds. Unlike other forms of carbonate nodules, which are often found in more solid rock, loess deposits with lime nodules are soft and crumbly, or loose. The German word for loose is Loess; it was first used in about 1821 in reference to the Rhine River loess.|$|E
50|$|From {{detailed}} {{studies of}} ganisters, geologists {{have concluded that}} the typical ganister is the silicified surface horizon, i.e. E horizon, of a buried soil, called “paleosol”, developed in sandy sediments. These and other studies have found ganisters to contain abundant evidence of having once been the upper horizon of a soil, which has developed in loamy or sandy sediments. The evidence includes some combination of carbonized roots and rootlets, rhizoliths, <b>illuvial</b> clay cutans, silcrete-like silica cements, and the leaching and alteration of the sandy sediments by weathering and plants. These studies argue that the destruction of easily weathered minerals, i.e. feldspar, within the surface horizon of a soil by soil-forming processes is what creates the quartz-rich nature of ganisters. The silica-cementation that creates a ganister typically results from dissolution of plant opal within a soil profile and its redeposition as silica cement within it. The formation of ganisters have been observed within modern soils, such as in the Okavango Delta of Botswana.|$|E
5000|$|Brown earths have a {{long history}} of being a major {{grouping}} in most soil classifications. In France they have been included with [...] "sol brun acide", although these soils may tend to have more iron and aluminium in the B horizon, and tend to what, in the British classification, is called a brown podzolic soil. Brown earths are also classified in the German and Austrian soil taxonomy as [...] "Braunerde." [...] Braunerden are widespread and frequently occur on unconsolidated parent sand or loess parent materials. [...] "Parabraunerde" [...] is the classification for a brown earth with an elluvial horison above a slightly argillic, clayey <b>illuvial</b> horizon. This gives rise to a universal division of these, generally brown and well drained soils into the weakly leached brown earths - called cambisols in the international World Reference Base for Soil Resources (WRB); and more leached brown podzolic soils in which there is an orange-brown B horizon, but no pale leached horizon between the A and the B horizons. These are called Umbrisols in the WRB, and are particularly common in western Europe, covering large areas in NW Spain.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{subsurface}} diagnostic horizons {{are used}} to characterize different soils in soil taxonomy. Each diagnostic horizon provides a characteristic that helps place a soil in its proper class in the system. A soil {{may or may not}} have a subsurface diagnostic horizon. There are approximately 20 subsurface diagnostic horizons, of which include the argillic horizon, natric horizon, kandic horizon, oxic horizon, spodic horizon, and albic horizon. The argillic horizon (designated as Bt) is characterized by a thick accumulation of silicate clays that have moved downward from the upper horizons or have formed in place. The argillic horizon often contains clays with shiny coatings termed [...] "argillans" [...] or [...] "clay skins", and accompanied by less than 15% exchangeable sodium on the colloidal complex. The natric horizon (designated as Btn) similarly has silicate clay accumulation with clay skins, but the clays are accompanied by more than 15% exchangeable sodium on the colloidal complex and by columnar or prismatic soil structural units. The natric horizon is most commonly found in arid and semiarid regions. The kandic horizon (designated as Bt, Bts), sometimes referred to as [...] "old" [...] clays, has an accumulation of Fe and Al oxides as well as low-activity silicate clays (e.g., kaolinite), but clay skins need not be evident. The clays are low in activity as shown by their low cation-holding capacities. The oxic horizon (designated as Bo) is a very weathered horizon with a high content of Fe/Al oxides and low-activity silicate clays. It is generally physically stable, crumbly, and not very sticky, despite its high clay content. It is found most commonly in humid tropical and subtropical regions. The spodic horizon (designated as Bh, Bhs) is an <b>illuvial</b> and dark-colored horizon that is characterized by the accumulation of colloidal organic matter and aluminium oxide with or without iron oxide. It is commonly found in highly leached forest soils of cool humid climates, typically on sandy-textured parent materials. The albic horizon (designated as E) is an eluvial and light-colored horizon that is characterized by a low content of clay and Fe/Al oxides.|$|E
40|$|Among other driving forces, {{climate change}} {{may lead to}} {{significant}} modifications of soil properties through variations of the intensity and dynamics {{of a number of}} soil processes including the especially sensitive and ubiquitous processes of bioturbation and illuviation. Progress toward the quantification of these processes needs to be made as a first step in order to ascertain or predict the impact of climate change. In this study, we develop, and validate through an exhaustive accuracy assessment, a digital 2 D image analysis method adapted to large soil thin sections, leading to the quantification, characterization and classification of pores and <b>illuvial</b> clay features considered diagnostic of bioturbation and illuviation, respectively. The need to consider large soil thin sections (14 x 6 cm) stems from observations that areas from 684 mm 2 to more than 5 000 mm 2 are needed to obtain representative measurements of fragments of <b>illuvial</b> clay (papules) and porosity associated with earthworms respectively. Whereas the soil heterogeneity in thin sections of such a large size prohibits the use of classical global and colorimetric image analysis procedures, we succeeded to quantify and characterize the porosity and <b>illuvial</b> clay features with accuracies as high as 96 % for porosity and 92 % for <b>illuvial</b> clay by carefully considering different levels of soil organization from aggregates to individual <b>illuvial</b> clay features. Quantification of the size and the shape of pores and of <b>illuvial</b> clay features makes it possible to develop morphological classifications distinguishing pores of biological origin (earthworms or roots) from others, or clay coatings and infillings from papules. All these data are particularly useful to better characterize underlying soil processes. Results suggest that the proposed methodology provides an accurate and representative quantification of biological porosity and <b>illuvial</b> clay features in large thin sections. We argue that the use of this approach could be extended to study and quantify bioturbation and illuviation intensities at the profile scale...|$|E

40|$|Silica {{cemented}} pedogenic horizons {{known as}} duripans occur on relict landforms in climates having limited leaching potential. Under {{the influence of}} tephra, incipient silica cementation may also occur in late Quaternary soils. The source of silica for cementation in Holocene soils is rapidly weatherable volcanic glass. In response to wetting and drying cycles volcanic glass weathers to form sand-size composite particles composed of silt, clay and redeposited silica. A portion of the hydrolyzed silica is eluviated as monosilicic acid which accumulates as the wetting front evaporates. <b>Illuvial</b> silica augments existing composite particles eventually forming a continuously cemented duripan. In actively forming late Quaternary soils, the cementation process is a complex interaction between <b>illuvial</b> silica, clay and calcium carbonate and the soil matrix. Surface reactions between monosilicic acid and <b>illuvial</b> clay or soil matrix particles provide nucleation sites for polymerization of silica concentrated by evaporation. The resulting opaline silica bonds adjacent soil grains without necessarily plugging intervening pore spaces. In contrast, calcium carbonate preferentially precipitates in large pores and interped voids. Cementation occurs by the plugging of progressively smaller pores with relatively pure calcite rather than by heterogeneous bonding of mineral grains. In <b>illuvial</b> zones containing both silica and calcium carbonate, cementation may occur rapidly because the former holds small soil particles in place while the latter plugs large pores. The mineralogy of silica cement is determined by identification of varying amounts of crystal order using X-ray diffraction. Opal-A is recently polymerized, noncrystalline, highly hydrated silica gel. The more prevalent, partly crystalline opal-CT forms where surface reaction with clays create crystal orientation, where silica gel dehydrates or when silica precipitates from soil solutions having high concentrations...|$|E

In Podzols, organic matter is leached from the forest floor and Aeh horizons into the Bh horizon, where it is intimately associated with the mineral phase. In the Aeh horizon {{the majority of the}} residual organic matter was present in methylene structures, contributing 42 % to the organic matter associated with the clay fraction. In the Aeh horizon decreasing particle size was typically accompanied by increasing ratios alkyl C-to-O-alkyl C, suggesting increasing decomposition of polysaccharides for the residual organic matter. The <b>illuvial</b> Bh horizon, containing high proportions of iron- and aluminum-oxides and hydroxides, was higher in aromatic carbon, while polysaccharides were similar and methylene carbon were smaller than in the Aeh horizon. In the particle size separates proportions of polysaccharides were constant, resulting in decreasing ratios alkyl C/O-alkyl C. Proportions of hydrolyzable amino acids were larger in the Aeh horizon (52 % of the total N) than in the Bh horizon (21 %), both for bulk soils and size Separates. Our results suggested that in Bh horizons of Podzols, aromatic structures and also presumably labile structures like polysaccharides can be stabilized by organo-mineral associations.

40|$|The pedogenic {{genesis of}} {{lamellae}} is commonly reported as involving clay illuviation.

Soils were described and sampled along a hillslope in the Sao Pedro region, São Paulo state, and submitted to physical (particle size), chemical (pH and exchangeable cations), and micromorphological analyses. in the Upper Segment of the studied hillslope, dominated by low gradients, the soil is deep, reddish, and contains a sequence of 12 to 20 lamellae/interlamellae. An examination of thin sections revealed abundant <b>illuvial</b> features formed by moderately to strongly oriented clay bridges between sandy particles in the lamellae, supporting an <b>illuvial</b> origin. in the Middle Segment of the hillslope, characterized by higher gradients, the soil is shallower and yellowish, presents some mottles, and contains a sequence of 2 lamellae/interlamellae. Field descriptions showed curved links between these lamellae and the underlying Bt as well as isolated spots similar to lamellae within interlamellae. the lamellae, Bt, curved links, and spots present similar micromorphological characteristics and only a few <b>illuvial</b> features, which suggest a genetic relationship between lamellae and the Bt horizon and minimize the importance of clay illuviation. the origin of these lamellae is related to the degradation of Bt and clay eluviation by subsurface lateral flows, developed mainly in the contact between Bt and the overlying, more permeable horizons. This process seems to be an important way of lamellae formation under tropical climate and should thus be incorporated into the term pedogenic lamellae, which is usually associated in the international literature with lamellae formed by clay illuviation.

Light rainfall increased water content in the litter and at soil depth of 080 ?cm, but the increased soil water was lost in several days. Heavy rainfall increased soil water content up to 85 % at depths of 040 ?cm. Following the light rainfall in early spring, the dD {{of water from the}} litter, humus, <b>illuvial,</b> and material layers decreased first and then gradually reached the pre-rainfall level. In summer, light rainfall reached the litter humus, and <b>illuvial</b> layer, but did not hit the material layer. Heavy rainfall affected dD of water in all layers. The dD of soil interflow slightly fluctuated with rainfall events. The dD of shallow groundwater did not differ significantly among all rainfall events. Light rainfall altered the shape of dD profile curve of water in the upper layer of soil, whereas heavy rainfall greatly affected the shape of dD profile curve of water in all soil layers. Following the heavy rainfall, preferential flow initially occurred through macropores, decayed plant roots, and rocks at different depths of soil profile. With continuing rainfall, the litter and surface soil were nearly saturated or fully saturated, and infiltration became homogeneous and plug-like. Forest soil water, particularly in deeper soil profile, was slightly affected by rainfall and, thus, can be a source of water supply for regional needs, particularly during dry seasons.

40|$|Ten {{to twelve}} pedosedimentary stages were {{identified}} within the Upper Permian red clayey sediments of the Sukhona and North Dvina drainage basins. Paleosols formed at these stages are generally similar in their profile arrangement and pedogenic features. The main pedogenic processes {{occurring in the}} area during the Upper Tatarian appear to have been: (1) eluviation and gleying (reduction and mobilization of non-silicate-bound iron and removal of some fine clay) in the upper parts of soil profiles; (2) <b>illuvial</b> accumulation of iron, and some clay in the subsoil; (3) formation of secondary carbonates; and (4) generation of complex soil structure. These processes are interpreted {{to have taken place}} in a semiarid climate with sharp seasonal and long-term fluctuations in precipitation. Upper Tatarian plant communities at that time probably consisted mostly of shoreline hygrophytes and halophytes, and xerophyllous conifers living on relatively elevated areas...|$|E
