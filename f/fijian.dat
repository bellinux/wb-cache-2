5|$|Because {{there were}} no deaths and only 65 people had been {{directly}} affected by Cyclone Daman, the <b>Fijian</b> government, {{with the help of}} the Red Cross, decided not to request any International Aid or any external assistance. The <b>Fijian</b> Government, on January 15, 2008, allocated $530,000 2008FJD for the relief and rehabilitation programme of Cikobia. By August 2008, all work rebuilding Cikobia after Cyclone Daman had been completed.|$|E

5|$|In {{the most}} part of Sowakula's early {{basketball}} career, he played predominantly as an amateur in Fiji. He featured for the Raiwaqa-based Boston White side, playing in local <b>Fijian</b> tournaments such as the Raiwaqa Basketball Super League. His form saw him make his first international debut during the Oceania Youth Championship competition in Melbourne in 2012. He was also selected {{to be part of}} the Oceania Youth All Stars and the Oceania Open team in the same year whilst winning a bronze medal. The following year Sowakula was a member of the <b>Fijian</b> national team to take part at the Oceania Championships in New Zealand where he was also awarded the best player of the tournament, making the competitions All Stars side.|$|E
50|$|Fiji's four coups in {{the past}} two decades have had church involvement. At the center of each coup lies the tension between the ethnic <b>Fijians</b> and Indian <b>Fijians.</b> Religion plays a {{significant}} role, as the majority of ethnic <b>Fijians</b> belong to the Methodist church while the majority of Indian <b>Fijians</b> are Hindu.|$|R

50|$|When sugar mills {{were being}} set up in Fiji in the 1870s and 1880s {{it was hoped that}} <b>Fijians</b> would be the major {{supplier}} of cane. Initially cane was grown by <b>Fijians</b> as a tax crop. Each province was assessed for tax and if the value of the crop handed to the Government exceeded the assessment, a refund was paid to the province. In 1884 <b>Fijians</b> produced 8,884 tons of cane which was 12% of the total cane crushed that year. By 1900, cane supplied by <b>Fijians</b> had risen to 15,447 tons but as a proportion to the total this was only 6%. After 1902, when a change in Government policy allowed cash to be paid for tax, cane supplied by <b>Fijians</b> decreased so that by 1914 cane produced by <b>Fijians</b> was negligible.|$|R
5|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone Joni was a {{damaging}} {{tropical cyclone}} that impacted the island nations of Tuvalu and Fiji. It was first noted within the South Pacific Convergence Zone {{at the start}} of December 1992, as a shallow tropical depression {{in the vicinity of the}} island nation Tuvalu. Over the next few days the system gradually developed further as it affected Tuvalu, before it was declared to be a tropical cyclone and named Joni by the Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS) during December 7. Over the next couple of days the system intensified further as it was steered south-westwards and posed a threat towards the <b>Fijian</b> dependency of Rotuma and the French territory of Wallis and Futuna. The system subsequently peaked as a Category 4 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale as it approached the <b>Fijian</b> Islands during December 10. Over the next couple of days the system moved through the <b>Fijian</b> Islands, before it became an extratropical cyclone during December 13. The system was last noted during the next day as it was absorbed by a mid-latitude trough of low pressure to the east of New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{attitudes in}} Western {{medicine}} in the 1940s and 1950s, Native American and <b>Fijian</b> cultures and societies were strongly dissuaded from premastication due to concerns about the hygiene of the practice. However, the lack of knowledge regarding premastication and its prohibition by missionaries and doctors instead caused severe anemia in the infants of the population, or resulted in malnourished infants and children deprived of nourishment.|$|E
5|$|On December3, the Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre (RSMC) in Nadi, Fiji, {{upgraded}} {{a tropical}} disturbance, located {{to the west}} of the Solomon Islands, to Tropical Depression 04F. On December5, as the depression moved towards the west into the <b>Fijian</b> archipelago, both the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) and RSMC Nadi upgraded it to Cyclone Daman. On December7 the cyclone reached its peak intensity with winds of 185km/h, (115mph 10-minute sustained) which made Daman a Category 4 cyclone on the Australian Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale. Later that day Daman also reached its peak intensity by 1-minute means with winds of 205km/h (125mph) which made it a Category 3 tropical cyclone on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Early on December8, Cyclone Daman brushed by the <b>Fijian</b> island of Cikobia, causing damage to housing, crops and vegetation. Daman then weakened the next day into a tropical depression and dissipated on December10.|$|E
25|$|Fiji {{had seen}} four {{definitive}} coups {{in the past}} two decades. At the heart of the previous three of these lay the tensions between the ethnic <b>Fijians</b> and Indian <b>Fijians.</b> Religion played a significant role; the majority of ethnic <b>Fijians</b> belong to the Methodist church whereas the majority of the Indians are Hindu. In each coup, one of the sides sought to establish reduced rights for the Indian Fijians; the other side sought to grant greater rights and equality to the Indian <b>Fijians.</b>|$|R

5000|$|In {{the late}} 1960s {{the leader of}} the National Federation Party, A. D. Patel, who used the slogan, [...] "One Country, One People, One Destiny" [...] {{suggested}} that all Fiji's citizens should be called <b>Fijians</b> and to distinguish the original inhabitants from the rest, the name <b>Fijians</b> should be used for native <b>Fijians.</b> There was widespread opposition to this from the native <b>Fijians</b> who feared that any such move would deprive them of the special privileges they had enjoyed since cession in 1874. The Fiji Times started using Fiji Islander to describe all Fiji's citizens but this name did not catch on.|$|R

5|$|Several small clashes were fought between Allied and Japanese forces during February. The <b>Fijian</b> {{force at}} Ibu was {{reinforced}} to a strength of about 400 personnel on 3February, but was withdrawn to the perimeter {{in the middle}} of the month after a larger body of Japanese troops surrounded the outpost and began to attack the US Army units which were protecting its supply lines. All of the <b>Fijian</b> troops, along with 200 civilians who had chosen to evacuate with the battalion, reached the coast on 19February. Other American patrols and positions to the north and north-east of the perimeter were also attacked, and the Allies concluded that the Japanese force was being concentrated in this area. Papers taken from the bodies of Japanese soldiers killed in this fighting also allowed the Allies to build up an accurate appreciation of the Japanese plan of attack as well as the order of battle of the forces involved. Intelligence information detailing the Japanese plans was then distributed to American soldiers holding the perimeter through various means, including notices posted on unit bulletin boards.|$|E
5|$|When hunting, banded sea kraits {{frequently}} {{head into}} deep water far from land, but return {{to land in}} order to digest, shed skin, and reproduce. Individual banded sea kraits return to their specific home islands, exhibiting philopatry. One study found that when banded sea kraits on <b>Fijian</b> islands were relocated to different islands 5.3km away, all recaptured individuals were found on their home islands in an average of 30.7 days.|$|E
5000|$|Deposed Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase reacted {{by stating}} that the name [...] "Fijian" [...] belonged {{exclusively}} to indigenous <b>Fijians,</b> {{and that he would}} oppose any change in legislation enabling non-indigenous <b>Fijians</b> to use it. The Methodist Church, to which a large majority of indigenous <b>Fijians</b> belong, also reacted strongly to the proposal, stating that allowing any Fiji citizen to call themselves [...] "Fijian" [...] would be [...] "daylight robbery" [...] inflicted on the indigenous population.|$|R
50|$|In each of {{the four}} coups, one of the sides sought to reduce rights for Indian <b>Fijians,</b> whereas the other side sought to grant {{equality}} to Indian <b>Fijians.</b> The coup by Colonel Sitiveni Rabuka in 1987 led to a constitution that ensured Indian <b>Fijians</b> could only have less than half of all seats in parliament and banned Indians from the post of prime minister. The coup of 2000, by George Speight, removed the elected Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudry, who is a Hindu of Indian origin.|$|R
50|$|In September 2002, the {{government}} announced a 20-year development plan. Among other things, it aimed to give indigenous <b>Fijians</b> a greater stake in the economy. The plan envisages tax-relief to businesses owned or managed by ethnic <b>Fijians,</b> along with greater protection for indigenous land and fishery rights.|$|R
5|$|At this time, the ADF had no {{military}} units on operational deployment outside Australia. In 1987, the ADF {{made its first}} operational deployment as part of Operation Morris Dance, in which several warships and a rifle company deployed to the waters off Fiji {{in response to the}} 1987 <b>Fijian</b> coups d'état. While broadly successful, this deployment highlighted the need for the ADF to improve its capability to rapidly respond to unforeseen events.|$|E

By 1949, he had procured a yacht, the Royal Flight, {{which was used}} as a setting in the film The Blue Lagoon. The following year, the family bought a coconut plantation on Vanua Balavu, Fiji. In September 1951, Malley and his wife toured the world, visiting Algiers, Guadaloupe, Curaçao, Martinique, and Tahiti. They subsequently returned to live on their <b>Fijian</b> plantation, and rode out the 1953 Suva earthquake and tsunami.|$|E
5|$|Known as baka or baka ni viti in Fiji, Ficus obliqua {{has many}} of its parts used in <b>Fijian</b> {{traditional}} medicine, and was previously held to be sacred there. Its white sap {{has been used for}} painful or swollen joints and limbs or boils, or diluted with water and drunk to improve breast milk. Liquid extracted from the root bark has been used for headaches or, when diluted, to improve health after childbirth, and the leaves are applied to venereal lesions. The species has been traditionally used for boils in Samoa and Tonga.|$|E

2500|$|When the {{expedition}} visited Fiji, they captured Vendoni, a chief {{on the islands}} who had inspired some <b>Fijians</b> to capture and eat 11 crewmen on a ship seven years before. Soon afterward, <b>Fijians</b> {{on the island of}} Malolo ambushed and killed two popular officers of {{the expedition}}, and the Americans took revenge. [...] Wilkes' ship grounded {{on the north side of}} the island, but Ringgold led 80 men [...] from the south side. Women and children were spared, but about 87 <b>Fijians</b> were killed before the rest surrendered. Two villages were destroyed.|$|R
50|$|According to the 2007 Census of Fiji, {{the number}} of <b>Fijians</b> {{increased}} from 393,575 to 475,739, while {{the number of}} Indians decreased from 338,818 to 313,798.

5|$|Parrotfinches may be preyed upon by {{indigenous}} {{birds of}} prey such as the endemic Fiji goshawk, or by introduced mammals such as the small Asian mongoose, rats, and mice, {{and they may be}} susceptible to disease. The Fiji species, despite being both uncommon and endemic to one island group, appears to be stable in numbers. It is therefore classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, and it is protected under <b>Fijian</b> law.|$|E
5|$|The {{flight of}} the Fiji parrotfinch is fast and undulating with rapid wingbeats, and {{frequent}} calling. It tends to fly fairly high, landing in the tree tops, then descending to seek food. Its call is a high, thin seep or peep, {{similar to those of}} other parrotfinches such as blue-faced and red-throated, and is often repeated in bursts of varying length. The song is a long whistled double note similar to, but less urgent, than that of the orange-breasted myzomela, a <b>Fijian</b> endemic honeyeater.|$|E
5|$|When Cyclone Gene hit Fiji, {{it caused}} {{widespread}} minor damage {{on both of}} the main islands of Fiji including Vanua Levu and Viti Levu {{as well as a}} few of the other minor islands in Fiji which included Taveuni & the Yasawa group of islands. Power cuts were reported in at least half of Fiji including Suva and Nadi however power was quickly restored to these areas. Within Fiji over 340 people evacuated to 61 evacuation centres which were opened by the <b>Fijian</b> government. There was also 61 houses completely flattened by cyclone Gene.|$|E

5|$|After a {{brilliant}} performance displayed {{last year by}} Sowakula, it saw him scouted by Iowa Central Community College for the following year. Joining siblings Milika and Mataika Koyamainavure after Fiji Basketball development officer Laisiasa Puamau confirmed the news. He then was brought into the Otago Nuggets to participate in their 2014 campaign after a respectable showing at the Oceania Championships in New Zealand. Player-coach, Mark Dickel decided to give Sowakula a call once {{they were looking for}} a replacement for fellow <b>Fijian,</b> Marques Whippy. He made his debut starting from the bench during their match against the Taranaki Mountain Airs once he arrived in Dunedin from the previous week. Unfortunately his performances didn't live quite up to Dickel's standards after he believed Sowakula was not ready for the NBL, and instead called in former representative Tom Rowe as cover.|$|E
5|$|Daman {{did most}} of its damages on Cikobia island, which has a {{population}} of around 120. Damage on Cikobia included extensive damages to houses, school buildings, crops, fruitbearing trees and foliage. Water pipes were damaged by fallen trees as a result of high winds from the storm. Despite initial fears of there being some fatalities on Cikobia, no loss of life was recorded due to the storm. This was because the islands 120 residents had evacuated to caves on Cikobia. The <b>Fijian</b> Dependency of Rotuma experienced a significant amount of rainfall from December 5 until December 7, when Cyclone Daman was located near Rotuma.|$|E
5|$|Early on December 5, RSMC Nadi {{started to}} issue special weather bulletins on Cyclone Daman as a {{tropical}} cyclone gale warning had been issued for the <b>Fijian</b> dependency of Rotuma. Later that morning, as the Cyclone moved over Rotuma, RSMC Nadi issued a tropical cyclone alert {{for the rest}} of Fiji. During that afternoon, RSMC Nadi canceled the tropical cyclone gale warning for Rotuma and then upgraded the cyclone alerts for the northwest of Fiji to a tropical cyclone gale warning later that day. Early the next day, as the storm was intensifying, they upgraded the gale warnings for parts of northwest of Fiji to storm warnings while expanding the warnings to the western and central sides of Viti Levu and the western side of Vanua Levu. During that afternoon RSMC Nadi further revised the warnings as Cyclone Daman had become a severe tropical cyclone.|$|E
