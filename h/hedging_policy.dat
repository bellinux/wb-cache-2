40|$|Contrary to the {{predictions}} of existing normative currency-hedging models, a wide diversity of <b>hedging</b> <b>policies</b> is observed among institutional investors. We propose an alternative model of optimal currency-hedging choices based on regret theory, a normative and axiomatic behavioral theory. With hindsight, investors may experience regret of not having taken the ex post optimal hedging decision; i. e. full hedging if the foreign currency depreciated, or no hedging if the foreign currency appreciated. Hence, investors include expected future regret in their objective function. As a result, our model features two components of risk: traditional risk and regret. We derive closed-form optimal hedging rules using the Arrow-Pratt approach and highlight the difference with the traditional expected-utility results. We find that differences {{in the level of}} regret aversion among investors may explain why we observe such a wide diversity of currency <b>hedging</b> <b>policies</b> among institutional investors...|$|R

40|$|We analyze risk {{management}} trends in electricity commodity markets using {{the production and}} transaction data and written hedging policies of 12 Norwegian hydropower companies.

We find that the derivative cashflows constitute substantial profits for these companies. Furthermore, hedging contributes to reducing the C-FaR for 10 of the companies. These findings are surprising considering that we expect hedging to yield zero expected profit and to smooth the earnings function.

40|$|Financial theory {{offers an}} array of {{explanations}} for corporate hedging. However, financial economists have not reached any definitive conclusions regarding whether corporations 2 ̆ 7 hedging policies are consistent with theory. To examine this question, this study uses a database of the risk management activities of one-hundred oil and gas producers. For the years 1992 - 1994, I empirically investigate the influence of financing policy, tax structure, operating technology, compensation policy, and ownership structure on <b>hedging</b> <b>policy.</b> ^ I find that a company 2 ̆ 7 s <b>hedging</b> <b>policy</b> is significantly linked to its capital structure. The percentage of production hedged is strongly positively correlated with the ratio of total debt-to-total assets. Likewise, I find that companies that retain cash instead of paying dividends and companies with unrated debt hedge {{a greater percentage of}} production. In addition, after controlling for factors that influence the likelihood of hedging, smaller firms hedge more extensively. The results are consistent with what I label the 2 ̆ 2 underinvestment 2 ̆ 2, 2 ̆ 2 probability of financial distress 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 financing and investment coordination 2 ̆ 2 hypotheses. Collectively, these results suggest that hedging serves to alleviate financial contracting costs. ^ Additionally, consistent with the predictions of 2 ̆ 2 managerial risk aversion 2 ̆ 2 hypothesis and Tufano (1996), I find an inverse relationship between the extent that corporations hedge and their use of performance-contingent managerial compensation. Variables pertaining to the number of options held by managers, the ratio of stock option pay-to-cash salary and bonus, and the use of a stock option plan are all significantly negatively related to the percentage of production hedged. ^ Although a company 2 ̆ 7 s <b>hedging</b> <b>policy</b> is strongly correlated with its compensation policy, I find no evidence of a positive relation between the percentage of production hedged and managerial ownership. The results provide no evidence that a company 2 ̆ 7 s tax structure or operating technology influences its hedging policies. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the accuracy of}} forecasts of financial analysts {{in light of the}} <b>hedging</b> <b>policies</b> of the S&P 500 non-financial companies over the 1994 - 1997 period. Given that hedging reduces the volatility of cash flows, we ask whether it allows financial analysts to provide more accurate forecasts for firms that hedge than for firms that do not. Three data sources are used to construct the data set for this study: the Edgar database, Compustat and I/B/E/S. Univariate and multivariate tests are run {{in order to determine the}} effect of the usage of derivative products for hedging purposes, as well as that of the level of the usage, on analysts' forecasts accuracy. Only interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk hedging are considered, separately and together as the total hedging variable. The empirical results show that neither the involvement, nor the degree of involvement in hedging activities of a firm will result in more accurate forecasts, when considering the 1 -year forecasts. Interest rate hedging and overall hedging do not impact on the accuracy of forecasts in a statistically significant way. However, surprisingly, the results show an increase in the forecast error when the company is involved in higher levels of foreign exchange hedging. The results also show evidence that the further away in time the forecast is made, the more relevant the <b>hedging</b> <b>policies</b> of a company are to the analyst...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Under what {{conditions}} will a multinational corporation alter its operations to manage its risk exposure? We show that multinational firms will engage in operational hedging only when both exchange rate uncertainty and demand uncertainty are present. Operational hedging {{is less important}} for managing short-term exposures, since demand uncertainty is lower in the short term. Operational hedging is also less important for commodity-based firms, which face price but not quantity uncertainty. When the fixed costs of establishing a plant are low or the variability of the exchange rate is high, a firm may benefit from establishing plants in both the domestic and foreign location. Capacity allocated to the foreign location relative to the domestic location will increase when the variability of foreign demand increases relative to the variability of domestic demand or when the expected profit margin is larger. For firms with plants in both a domestic and foreign location, the foreign currency cash flow generally will not be independent of the exchange rate and consequently the optimal financial <b>hedging</b> <b>policy</b> cannot be implemented with forward contracts alone. We show that the optimal financial <b>hedging</b> <b>policy</b> can be implemented using foreign currency call and put options and forward contracts. 1...|$|E

The results showed that the vulnerability was significantly reduced by using the optimized hedging rules. However, the number of water shortages increased with the optimized rules, causing the time-based reliability to worsen significantly. This should not be of concern since, although the number of shortages increased, the associated shortage quantities on most of these additional occasions were small, leaving the volumetric reliability largely unchanged...|$|E
