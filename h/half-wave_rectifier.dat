25|$|For a <b>half-wave</b> <b>rectifier</b> {{the ratio}} is very modest.|$|E
25|$|The simple <b>half-wave</b> <b>rectifier</b> can be {{built in}} two {{electrical}} configurations with the diodes pointing in opposite directions, one version connects the negative terminal of the output direct to the AC supply and the other connects the positive terminal of the output direct to the AC supply. By combining both of these with separate output smoothing {{it is possible to}} get an output voltage of nearly double the peak AC input voltage. This also provides a tap in the middle, which allows use of such a circuit as a split rail power supply.|$|E
25|$|As a cost {{reduction}} measure, especially in high-volume consumer receivers, all the tube heaters could be connected in series across the AC supply using heaters requiring the same current {{and with a}} similar warm-up time. In one such design, a tap on the tube heater string supplied the 6 volts needed for the dial light. By deriving the high voltage from a <b>half-wave</b> <b>rectifier</b> directly connected to the AC mains, the heavy and costly power transformer was eliminated. This also allowed such receivers to operate on direct current, a so-called AC/DC receiver design. Many different US consumer AM radio manufacturers of the era used a virtually identical circuit, given the nickname All American Five.|$|E
50|$|Although {{better than}} {{single-phase}} <b>rectifiers</b> or three-phase <b>half-wave</b> <b>rectifiers,</b> six-pulse rectifier circuits still produce considerable harmonic distortion {{on both the}} AC and DC connections. For very high-power rectifiers the twelve-pulse bridge connection is usually used. A twelve-pulse bridge consists of two six-pulse bridge circuits connected in series, with their AC connections fed from a supply transformer that produces a 30° phase shift between the two bridges. This cancels many of the characteristic harmonics the six-pulse bridges produce.|$|R

40|$|Circuit {{consists}} of chopper section which converts input dc to square wave, followed by bridge-rectifier stage. Chopper gives nearly-ideal switching characteristics, and bridge uses series of full-wave stages rather than less-efficient <b>half-wave</b> <b>rectifiers</b> found in previous circuits. Special features of full-wave circuit allow redundant components to be eliminated, lowering parts count. Circuit {{can also be}} adapted for use as dc-to-dc converter or as combination dc-and-ac source...|$|R
25|$|A {{variant of}} this is to use two {{capacitors}} in series for the output smoothing on a bridge rectifier then place a switch between the midpoint of those capacitors and one of the AC input terminals. With the switch open, this circuit acts like a normal bridge rectifier. With the switch closed, it act like a voltage doubling rectifier. In other words, this makes it easy to derive a voltage of roughly 320V (±15%, approx.) DC from any 120V or 230V mains supply in the world, this can then be fed into a relatively simple switched-mode power supply. However, for a given desired ripple, the value of both capacitors must be twice the value of the single one required for a normal bridge rectifier; when the switch is closed each one must filter the output of a <b>half-wave</b> <b>rectifier,</b> and when the switch is open the two capacitors are connected in series with an equivalent value of half one of them.|$|E

2500|$|While {{half-wave}} and {{full-wave rectification}} deliver unidirectional current, neither produces a constant voltage. There {{is a large}} AC ripple voltage component at the source frequency for a <b>half-wave</b> <b>rectifier,</b> and twice the source frequency for a full-wave rectifier. [...] Ripple voltage is usually specified peak-to-peak. Producing steady DC from a rectified AC supply requires a smoothing circuit or filter. In its simplest form this can be just a capacitor (also called a reservoir capacitor or smoothing capacitor), choke, resistor, zener diode & resistor, or voltage regulator placed at {{the output of the}} rectifier. [...] In practice, most smoothing filters utilize multiple components to efficiently reduce ripple voltage to a level tolerable by the circuit.|$|E

By representing the <b>half-wave</b> linear <b>rectifier</b> characteristic by a Fourier series, closed-form expressions, {{in terms of}} the ordinary Bessel functions, are obtained for the amplitudes of the output components. The expressions obtained are compared with previously published expressions and, as a by-product, some apparently new results concerning Bessel functions are obtained...|$|R
40|$|Monophonic tele-conferencing systems employ {{acoustic}} echo cancellation (AEC) to reduce echoes {{that result from}} coupling between loudspeaker and microphone. Acoustic echo cancellation is simple to develope {{as there is a}} single channel. But future tele conferencing systems are expected to have multi channel communication which is necessary in hands-free multi user tele communication systems. Stereophonic echo cancellation (SEC), has been studied since the early 1990 s, in hands-free tele communication applications such as tele conferencing, multi user desktop conferencing, and tele video gaming. To enhance the sound realism in order to increase the speech intelligibilty it is necessary to use two channel (stereo) audio systems. This requires SEC systems. In SEC there is a fundamental problem that the adaptive algorithm used can not identify correct echo path responses due to strong correlation between stereo signals and also the convergence is slow. In this case it is necessary to identify two echo paths for each channel thus there are four echo paths to identify which is very difficult. In this thesis, the problems with stereo echo cancellation is explained and echo cancellation with emphasis on two channel affine projection algorithm (APA) is studied. The signal de-correlation techniques are reviewed and compared. The idea behind signal decorrelation techniques is to introduce nonlinearity into each channel. This can be done by using <b>half-wave</b> <b>rectifiers</b> or time varying all-pass filters. Three methods were developed to reduce correlation between stereo signals. One, is to use two positive <b>half-wave</b> <b>rectifiers</b> on both channels considered as NLP 1. Second, is to use positive and negative <b>half-wave</b> <b>rectifiers</b> on each channel (NLP 2). Third, is to use time varying all-pass filters (TV-APF) on both channels with delays. Experiments were performed using MATLAB and observed echo return loss enhancement (ERLE) and misalignment(MIS) with different scenarios. The euclidean norm distance calculation has been used to find out MIS between filter coefficients and true echo path models. It is observed that NLP 1 and NLP 2 lack signal perception even though ERLE was good. The MIS falls down below 25 dB with decorrelated stereo signals. The use of TV-APFs gives good echo cancellation and does not effect the signal perception, the ERLE in this case was 40. 3231 dB...|$|R
25|$|In {{half-wave}} rectification of a single-phase supply, also called uncontrolled one-pulse midpoint circuit, either the {{positive or negative}} half of the AC wave is passed, while the other half is blocked. Mathematically, it is a ramp function (for positive pass, negative block): passing positive corresponds to the ramp function being the identity on positive inputs, blocking negative corresponds to being zero on negative inputs. Because only one half of the input waveform reaches the output, mean voltage is lower. Half-wave rectification requires a single diode in a single-phase supply, or three in a three-phase supply. Rectifiers yield a unidirectional but pulsating direct current; <b>half-wave</b> <b>rectifiers</b> produce far more ripple than full-wave rectifiers, and much more filtering is needed to eliminate harmonics of the AC frequency from the output.|$|R

5000|$|It was {{the usual}} {{practice}} for power transformers to have a 5 volt insulated winding for rectifier filaments, and a 6.3 volt winding {{for all the other}} heaters; virtually all valves with 5V filament are rectifiers with cathode connected to heater, in practice full-wave (usable as half-wave by strapping both anodes together), e.g. GZ34. For lower-voltage lower-power requirements, rectifiers with 6.3V heaters and insulated cathodes such as the EZ80 were used, connected to the common filament supply. There is no special nomenclature for EHT rectifiers for cathode-ray tubes; the EY51 and EY86 were rated at 17kV with an average current of 350 microamps. The GY501 is another example (31kV at 1.7mA and used the rare B9D base).

2500|$|There is a {{long history}} of {{unsuccessful}} attempts and unverified claims to recover the power in the carrier of the received signal itself. Traditional crystal sets use <b>half-wave</b> <b>rectifiers.</b> As AM signals have a modulation factor of only 30% by voltage at peaks, no more than 9% of received signal power (...) is actual audio information, and 91% is just rectified DC voltage. Given that the audio signal is unlikely to be at peak all the time, the ratio of energy is, in practice, even greater. Considerable effort was made to convert this DC voltage into sound energy. Some earlier attempts include a one-transistor amplifier in 1966. Sometimes efforts to recover this power are confused with other efforts to produce a more efficient detection. This history continues now with designs as elaborate as [...] "inverted two-wave switching power unit".|$|R
40|$|AbstractRecent {{models of}} texture {{processing}} use low level, spatially parallel computations to extract texture properties. The rapid, preattentive nature of texture segregation {{suggests that these}} computations are bottom–up in nature. However, the immunity of texture judgments to top–down influences remains to be tested. Here we investigate {{the degree to which}} judgments of texture orientation are susceptible to top–down attentional control. Observers view a brief display composed of variously luminant texture elements (line segments) alternately (in checkerboard arrangement) oriented up/right (at 71. 5 °) or up/left (at 108. 5 °), and are asked to make various judgments. In a given task, the observer attempts on each trial to judge which oriented population of line segments has an intensity histogram that best matches a given target histogram. Performance demonstrates adaptive flexibility across different tasks, suggesting that observers are able to exercise significant top–down control over texture orientation computations. Specifically, observers can attend selectively to positive contrast texture elements, to negative contrast texture elements, or to high (positive and negative) contrast texture elements. More generally, observers perform well if the target histogram can be approximated by a weighted average of positive and negative <b>half-wave</b> <b>rectifiers.</b> Performance is poor for histograms that cannot be captured in this way. These results suggest that attentional control in these tasks is limited to adjusting the relative gain of the on- and off-center systems...|$|R

40|$|Online {{monitoring}} of the instantaneous resistance variation during the A. C. resistance spot welding {{is of paramount importance}} for the weld quality control. On the basis of the welding transformer circuit model, a new method is proposed to measure the transformer primary-side signal for estimating the secondary-side resistance in each 1 / 4 cycle. The tailored computing system ensures that the measuring method possesses a real-time computational capacity with satisfying accuracy. Since the dynamic resistance cannot be represented via an explicit function with respect to measurable parameters from the primary side of the welding transformer, an offline trained embedded artificial neural network (ANN) successfully realizes the real-time implicit function calculation or estimation.
