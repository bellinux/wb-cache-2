40|$|In a {{detailed}} study, working with experienced librarians, we investigated strategies used to seek {{information on a}} complex and unfamiliar topic, and the support offered by the digital library features. The activity was analysed using existing models of information seeking; while the patterns of behaviour identified match the general structure of existing models, we found details that are not well covered by those models. The searches were highly interactive and reactive. In addition, in this context, query reformulation was key to success; it {{was found to be}} <b>interactive</b> and <b>cyclic,</b> while remaining focused on the original quest. The descriptor terms of the index and abstract resources, together with syntax changes, were used to guide subtle changes and develop the search, to maximise the balance between recall and precision.

40|$|The {{parasitic}} flagellate Trypanosoma brucei {{undergoes a}} series of morphologic and metabolic changes during its passage in the digestive organs of its insect vector, a Glossina or tsetse fly. This morphogenesis ends by the differentiation, in the salivary gland of the fly, of the metacyclic form, which will be transmitted in the bloodstream of the mammalian host. On the basis of DNA microfluorometric measurements, we propose that these metacyclic trypanosomes have a haploid amount of DNA, {{compared to that of}} bloodstream forms and also of the proventricular forms, which initiate the invasion of the salivary glands. It can be inferred that trypanosomes undergo meiosis during their developmental cycle in the tsetse fly's salivary glands and syngamy shortly after <b>cyclic</b> transmission. <b>Journal</b> ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.

40|$|Abstract. In {{the recent}} past, {{multiple}} techniques and tools {{have been proposed}} and contributed to improve the distributed debugging functionalities, in several distinct aspects, such as handling the non-determinism, allowing <b>cyclic</b> <b>interactive</b> debugging of parallel programs, and providing more user-friendly interfaces. However, most of these tools are tied to a specific programming language and provide rigid graphical user interfaces. So they cannot easily adapt to support distinct abstraction levels or user interfaces. They also don’t provide adequate support for cooperation with other tools in a software engineering environment. In this paper we discuss several dimensions which may contribute to develop more flexible distributed debuggers. We describe Fiddle, a distributed debugging tool which aims at overcoming some of the above limitations. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractRationaleBest {{practice}} is an abstract word open to different interpretations. The definition of best practice {{depends on the}} context. PurposeThe purpose is to explore {{the meaning of the}} concept of best practice within the context of intrapartum care. MethodThe concept of best practice was analysed using Wilson's method of concept analysis. Dictionaries, a thesaurus, and an internet search were employed. References of journals were used to identify extra sources. Data saturation was reached at 117 definitions and uses of the concept of best practice. The definitions and uses of the concept of best practice listed in column one were read repeatedly. Common and similar patterns of words were highlighted. Grouping of common attributes and connotations occurred in column two and further deductive analysis and synthesis occurred in column three where derived essential attributes of the concept of best practice were categorised. ResultsThree broad categories emerged, namely (1) Values as antecedents of best practice; (2) A three-phased <b>interactive</b> integrative <b>cyclic</b> process of best practice; (phase one: awareness; phase two: need analysis and interactive process; phase three: consolidation); and (3) Desired outcomes of best practice, with resultant theoretical definition of the concept best practice during intra-partum care. Theoretical validity was attained through 117 sources used. RecommendationThe results of the concept analysis of best practice should be used to develop a model to facilitate best practice during intra-partum care...|$|R

A range of water-soluble hyperbranched poly(ester amide) s has been synthesized with a view to studying their thermoresponsive behavior in water. Poly(ester amide) s with lower critical solution temperature (LCST) values around physiological temperatures are of interest for biological and medical applications, whereas poly(ester amide) s with high LCST values may be useful as kinetic hydrate inhibitors for high salinity produced fluids in the oil and gas industry. The LCST of these polymers was measured as the optical cloud point. The LCST can be tuned in various ways for these applications, for example, by varying the hydrophobicity of the groups on the cyclic anhydride monomer or by adjusting the hydrophilicity of the imine used to make the peripheral groups of the polymer...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{collection}} of tools, DrDebug, that greatly advances the state-of-the-art of <b>cyclic,</b> <b>interactive</b> debugging of multi-threaded programs based upon the record and replay paradigm. The features of DrDebug significantly increase the efficiency of debugging by tailoring the scope of replay to a buggy execution region or an execution slice of a buggy region. In addition to supporting traditional debugger commands, DrDebug provides commands for recording, replaying, and dynamic slicing with several novel features. First, upon a user’s request, a highly precise dynamic slice is computed that can then be browsed by the user by navigating the dynamic dependence graph {{with the assistance of}} our graphical user interface. Second, a dynamic slice of interest to the user can be used to compute an execution slice whose replay can then be carried out. Due to narrow scope, the replay can be performed efficiently as execution of code segments that do not belong to the execution slice is skipped. We also provide the capability of allowing the user to step from the execution of one statement in the slice to the next while examining the values of variables. To the best of our knowledge, this capability cannot be found in any other slicing tool. We have also integrated DrDebug with the Maple tool that exposes bugs and records buggy executions for replay. Our experiments demonstrate DrDebug’s practicality...|$|R

The machinery specimens (with different diameter-to-thickness ratios but the same inside diameter) and method of testing (cyclic bending) {{in this study were}} the same as the ones used by Lee et al. (Lee, K. L., Pan, W. F., Kuo, J. N., 2001. The influence of the diameter-to-thickness ratio on the stability of circular tubes under <b>cyclic</b> bending. International <b>Journal</b> of Solids and Structures 38, 2401 – 2413.) for 316 L stainless steel circular tubes. The experimental investigation was extended to different outside and inside diameters of the same circular tubes subjected to cyclic bending. Based on the experimental findings, the empirical formulation proposed by Lee et al. (2001) was modified so that it can now be used to simulate the relationship between the prescribed curvature and the number of cycles necessary to produce buckling. In addition, {{it was found that the}} experimental curve of the ovalization and the number of cycles necessary to produce buckling could be divided into three stages – an initial, secondary and tertiary stage. An empirical relationship, similar to the Bailey–Norton creep formulation, was proposed for simulating the aforementioned curve for the initial and secondary stages in this study. The derived empirical relationship was in good agreement with the experimental data...|$|R

C., Saintier, N., About {{the effect of}} plastic {{dissipation}} in heat at the crack tip on the stress intensity factor under <b>cyclic</b> loading, International <b>Journal</b> of Fatigue (2013), doi: [URL] audienceBecause of the reverse cyclic plastic zone at the crack tip, there is plastic dissipation in heat at the crack tip under cyclic loading. That creates a heterogeneous temperature field around the crack tip. A thermo-mechanical model is proposed in this paper for evaluating the consequence of this temperature field on the Mode I stress intensity factor. Two cases are studied: (i) the theoretical problem of an infinite plate with a semi-infinite through crack under Mode I cyclic loading, and (ii) a finite specimen with a central through crack. In the first case, the main hypothesis and results are presented from the literature but no heat loss is taken into account. In second case, heat loss by convection is taken into account with a finite element analysis, while an analytical solution exists in the literature for the first case. In both cases, {{it is assumed that}} the heat source is located in the reverse cyclic plastic zone. The heat source within the reverse cyclic plastic zone is quantified by experiments on a mild steel under R= 0. 1. It is shown that the crack tip is under compression due to thermal stresses coming from the heterogeneous temperature field around the crack tip. The effect of this stress field on the stress intensity factor (its maximum, minimum and its range) is calculated. This paper shows that experiments have to be carried out to determine the heat source within the reverse cyclic plastic zone. This is the key parameter to quantify the effect of dissipation at the crack tip on the stress intensity factor...|$|R

In-line toxic product removal during solvent production by continuous fermentation using immobilized clostridium acetobutylicum. Enzyme and Microbial Technology, 9 (11), 672 - 675. The use of whey permeate as the fermentation substrate {{for the production}} of acetone:butanol:ethanol (solvents), using C. acetobutylicum P 262 was studied. Initial experiments were conducted in a batch mode using sulphuric acid casein whey permeate medium, in an attempt to optimize the culture conditions for maximal extent of lactose utilization and solvents production. A high initial lactose concentration (65 - 75 g/l) in combination with a culture pH maintained in the region pH 5. 4 to 5. 6 were the most favourable conditions for solvent production. An inverse relationship between the lactose utilization rate and solvents yield was observed. Solvent productivities were only 60 % however, of that achievable with this strain of organism on an industrial scale using a molasses medium, but comparable productivities were obtained using a semi-synthetic medium containing glucose. Hydrolysed-lactose sulphuric acid casein whey permeate medium was investigated as a medium for solvent production. Glucose and galactose were utilized simultaneously, although glucose was used preferentially. Only a small increase in solvents productivity was obtained compared with that obtained using non-hydrolysed permeate. Experiments were performed in continuous culture using cheese whey permeate medium and alginate-immobilized cells. Significantly greater solvent productivities were obtained, compared with those achieved using free cells in batch culture. Fermentations were operated for over 650 hours with no detectable loss in fermentation performance. The extent of lactose utilization was low, however (less than 40 %), and attempts to increase this by the use of pH regulation or a two-stage process were unsuccessful. This fermentation process was described as a biomass volume process (volumetric fraction of alginate beads in the reactor), where the lactose utilization and hence the solvents production, was defined by an inhibitory concentration of butanol, approximately 5 g/l. An alternative continuous fermentation process using free cells and cheese whey permeate medium was investigated. External cell recycle using cross-flow microfiltration (CFM) membrane plant to continuously separate cells from the fermentation culture and recycle them back to the fermenter was utilized. Biomass was continuously removed from the fermenter in order to achieve a stable biomass concentration. Stable solvents production was not achieved under the range of culture conditions investigated; culture degeneration was attributed to the complex <b>interactive</b> morphological <b>cyclic</b> behaviour of the organism. A tubular CFM unit which could be periodically backflushed to maintain the filtrate flux, was found to be the most suitable of those tested. The integration of in-situ or in-line solvents recovery with batch culture using free cells, and continuous fermentation using cells immobilized by adsorption to bonechar, was investigated in order to remove toxic solvents and so increase the extent of lactose utilization and solvents productivity. A novel process using gas-stripping with an inert gas, and solvents recovery from the vapour phase by condensation using a cold trap, was described. An increase in lactose utilization and solvents productivity was achieved in both fermentation modes compared with control fermentations. The use of adsorbent resins and a molecular sieve for integrated fermentation solvents recovery was also demonstrated. However, the adsorption of medium components may mitigate against the usefulness of such a process option. The batch refermentation of batch fermentation effluent treated by gas-stripping to remove solvents was investigated. However, solvent production was favoured only when lactose and nutrients were supplemented to concentrations similar to those present originally. Conversely, fermentation medium treated by gas-stripping to remove solvents could be readily refermented to produce solvents when an existing cell population was used, suggesting that this option of an integrated continuous fermentation-product recovery process may be promising for whey permeate solvent production...|$|R
