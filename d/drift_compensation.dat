50|$|The first {{suggestion}} for etched glass reticles {{was made by}} Philippe de La Hire in 1700. His method was based on engraving the lines on a glass plate with a diamond point. Many modern crosshairs are actually etched onto a thin plate of glass, which allows a far greater latitude in shapes. Etched glass reticles can have floating elements, which do not cross the reticle; circles and dots are common, and some types of glass reticles have complex sections designed for use in range estimation and bullet drop and <b>drift</b> <b>compensation</b> (see external ballistics). A potential disadvantage of glass reticles {{is that they are}} less durable than wire crosshairs, and the surface of the glass reflects some light (about 4% per surface on uncoated glass) lessening transmission through the scope, although this light loss is near zero if the glass is multicoated (coating being the norm for all modern high quality optical products).|$|E
50|$|The {{intrinsic}} {{resistance of}} a conducting element, usually a copper trace in Printed circuit Board(PCB) can use {{be used as}} sensing element instead of a shunt resistor. Since no additional resistor is required this approach promises a low-cost and space saving configuration with no additional power losses either. Naturally, the voltage drop of a copper trace is very low due to its very low resistance, making {{the presence of a}} high gain amplifier mandatory {{in order to get a}} useful signal.There are several physical effects which may alter the current measurement process: thermal drift of the copper trace, initial conditions of the trace resistance etc. Therefore, this approach is not suitable for applications that require a reasonable accuracy due to the large thermal drift. In order to overcome the problems associated with the temperature drift, a digital controller can be used for thermal <b>drift</b> <b>compensation</b> and calibration of the copper trace.A significant drawback of this kind of current sensor is the unavoidable electrical connection between the current to be measured and the sense circuit. By employing a so-called isolation amplifier, electrical isolation can be added. However, these amplifiers are expensive and can also deteriorate the bandwidth, accuracy and thermal drift of the original current sensing technique. For these reasons, current sensing techniques based on physical principles that provide intrinsic electrical isolation deliver a better performance at lower costs in applications where isolation is required.|$|E

40|$|Whether {{migrating}} birds {{compensate for}} wind drift {{or not is}} a fundamental question in bird migration research. The procedures to demonstrate and quantitatively estimate wind <b>drift</b> or <b>compensation</b> are fraught with difficulties and pitfalls. In this paper, we evaluate four methods {{that have been used}} in several studies over the past decades. We evaluate the methods by analysing a model migratory movement with a realistic scatter in flight directions, for the ideal cases of full <b>drift</b> and complete <b>compensation.</b> Results obtained with the different methods are then compared with the "true behaviour" of the model movement, illustrating that spurious patterns of <b>drift</b> and <b>compensation</b> arise in some cases. We also illustrate and evaluate the different methods of estimating drift for a real case, based on tracking radar measurements of bird migration in relation to winds. Calculating the linear regression of mean geographic track (resulting flight direction) and heading directions (directions of the birds' body axis) of a migratory movement under different wind conditions in relation to the angle a (the angle between mean track and heading) always provides robust and reliable results. Comparing mean flight directions between occasions with winds from the left and right of the mean flight direction of the whole migratory movement also always provides expected and correct measures of drift. In contrast, regressions of individual flight directions in relation to alpha (the angle between track and heading for the specific individuals or flocks) are liable to produce biased and spurious results, overestimating compensation/ overcompensation if following winds dominate in the analysis and overestimating drift/ overdrift if opposed winds are dominating. Comparing mean directions for cases with winds from the left and right in relation to individual flight directions also gives biased and spurious results unless there is full variation in wind directions or an equal distribution of crosswinds from left and right. The results of the methodological evaluation and the analysis of the real case indicate that some earlier analyses of wind drift may have to be re-evaluated. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Whether {{migrating}} birds compensate fur wind drift or not {{has been}} discussed frequently during the last decades. Observed behaviours seem to differ between species and situations. Even though complete compensation allows a bird to fly the shortest distance during its migration, {{this is not necessarily}} the optimal solution in all cases. There are certain situations when drifting with the wind, and thus getting higher groundspeed, will be more beneficial, i. e. adaptive drift. In this article, I analyse flight directions of spring migrating barnacle and brent geese, tracked by radar and optical range finder, and compare these with prevailing winds to see if these birds compensate or drift with the wind. I also use wind data from the days when the trackings were made to construct expected flight paths to see whether wind <b>drift</b> or <b>compensation</b> would be the most beneficial behaviour. The geese were found to drift partially with the wind. The drift effect was concluded to be true partial drift, i. e. not pseudodrift or drift forced by strong winds. The drift was not found to be of any obvious adaptive value, as the geese drifted irrespective of the strategy that would have been most beneficial to them. None of the situations in which drift is predicted to be adaptive was applicable to the birds and migration days in this study. A possible explanation for the observed pattern is that since these birds usually have access to favourable winds during their spring migration, selection pressures for adaptive <b>drift</b> or <b>compensation</b> behaviours might be adaptive weak...|$|R

Traditional methods for <b>drift</b> <b>compensation</b> are laborious and costly due to the frequent acquisition and labeling process for gases samples recalibration. Extreme learning machines (ELMs) have been confirmed to be efficient and effective learning techniques for pattern recognition and regression. However, ELMs primarily focus on the supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised learning problems in single domain (i. e. source domain). To our best knowledge, ELM with cross-domain learning capability has never been studied.

40|$|Wind has a {{profound}} influence on migrating birds since it inevitably will influence travel {{time and energy}} expenditure. In this thesis I investigate how migrating birds are affected by, and use winds.

Brent geese were found to consistently select migration days with following winds during a multi-step, 5000 km migration from Western Europe to Siberia. Arctic waders passing over South Sweden were found to use strong following winds at high altitudes, with a potential for large savings in flight time and energy expenditure. A more detailed analysis revealed that the waders chose better than average days with respect to winds for their several thousand km long flights. By doing so they gained savings in time and energy exceeding 25 % compared to a flight in still conditions. Compared to average conditions the savings {{were in the order}} of 5 - 10 %. Arctic geese were found to drift partially with the wind during overland migration. Waders were also found to drift with the wind to a varying degree, both during spring and autumn migration. The recorded patterns of drift were generally in agreement with ideas of adaptive drift predicting initial drift during the first stages of a migratory journey combined with an increasing amount of compensation as the birds approach their destinations. In a third study of wind <b>drift</b> and <b>compensation</b> I show that brent geese have the capacity to compensate for drift during a long flight over open ocean, despite the lack of access to stationary landmarks. Possible mechanisms for achieving compensation in such conditions are discussed. I analysed flight speeds in three studies and found that birds in general adjust airspeed by increasing airspeed in headwinds and decreasing it in tailwinds. No clear pattern was found regarding crosswinds, which is at odds with theoretical predictions. Flight speed adjustment in relation to other factors than wind was also analysed.
