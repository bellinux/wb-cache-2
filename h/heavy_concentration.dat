5|$|Route 21 heads {{north from}} the Newark Airport Interchange with U.S. Route 1/9 and U.S. Route 22 in Newark near the Newark Liberty International Airport on the six-lane, divided McCarter Highway. This portion of Route 21 serves to connect Newark Liberty with {{downtown}} Newark. The route interchanges with Interstate 78 and then crosses over Amtrak's Northeast Corridor rail line on a viaduct, {{coming to an}} interchange with Broad Street that provides access to Route 27. The route continues north, paralleling the elevated Northeast Corridor tracks that lead up to Newark Penn Station, which serves Amtrak and New Jersey Transit trains. At the Emmet Street intersection, Route 21 becomes a four-lane, undivided road and intersects Murray Street, which provides access to the Ironbound neighborhood of Newark. This section of Route 21 through {{the southern part of}} Newark has a high accident rate due to the <b>heavy</b> <b>concentration</b> of businesses and traffic lights along this portion of road. The road widens to six lanes and the route intersects County Route 510 (Market Street) near Newark Penn Station and continues north into downtown Newark, splitting from the Northeast Corridor rail line. It crosses Raymond Boulevard and the route meets County Route 508 (Center Street), with which it forms a concurrency.|$|E
5|$|Route161 {{begins at}} the {{intersection}} of Clifton Avenue and Allwood Road (CR602) in Clifton. The route passes a park and large commercial building at the southern terminus. A short distance after, Route161 provides a connector to Richfield Terrace on the northbound side of the highway, the park's divider known as Cross Street. The highway continues northward, intersecting with Richland Court, which provides access to local residential homes. The next intersection is with Joan Place, which serves a similar function to Richland Court. Soon after, Route161 intersects with Saint Andrew's Boulevard, which also serves as the northern terminus of Richfield Terrace and connects the highway with CR609 (Mount Prospect Avenue). Just past Saint Andrew's Boulevard Route161 passes through a largely commercial section of Clifton with a <b>heavy</b> <b>concentration</b> of medical offices before terminating at an intersection with CR614 (Van Houten Avenue). The right-of-way of Route161 continues as CR611 (Clifton Avenue) towards downtown Clifton.|$|E
5|$|Realising {{that they}} had only faced a series of probes the {{previous}} night, rather than a major attack, and as these actions {{may have been in}} preparation for a heavier attack, a vigorous defence was subsequently prepared by the Australians with the reserve companies moved into blocking positions to strengthen the forward defences. The defenders endured steady shelling and harassing fire, while after dark The Hook was probed again, this time by a group of about 20 Chinese. The force was subsequently engaged by an Australian standing patrol from D Company at 21:00 and forced to withdraw, leaving behind one dead at a cost of one Australian killed and one wounded. At 21:20 the Chinese fire became more intense, and a heavy blow was launched by the Chinese against the Marines on Hill 119 shortly after. Beginning at 21:30, elements of the 1st and 7th Marines were attacked by two Chinese companies. A <b>heavy</b> <b>concentration</b> by the entire US I Corps artillery was fired in response, and the Chinese were forced to withdraw. At 23:00 the Chinese shelling intensified to thirty-rounds per minute, and was followed fifteen minutes later by another determined charge by the Chinese infantry against the US Marines on the left flank on Hill 111 and Boulder City during a furious attack. The Australian positions were not directly attacked during the night, although C Company engaged the Chinese in no man's land sporadically at long range in support of the Americans. As on the previous night, 3 RAR was not attacked. In total more than 4,200 mortar and artillery rounds were fired by the Chinese at 2 RAR during the night, and three Australians were killed and nine wounded.|$|E

25|$|The convoy {{departed}} the fueling area at 16:46. Frequent alerts and enemy planes enlivened {{the evening}} hours {{as the group}} maneuvered throughout {{the night in a}} retirement formation. Willmarths war diarist noted that the Japanese planes seemed loathe to attack ships in the fueling area during daylight, probably because of the <b>heavy</b> <b>concentration</b> of anti-aircraft fire that could be directed at an attacker.|$|E
25|$|There {{is often}} <b>heavy</b> <b>concentration</b> on the American effort and its mistakes, contradictions and strategy, but {{comparatively}} {{little on the}} Vietnamese side, save as it ties into the theme of American failure or missteps. Whatever the merits of these arguments about war coverage, {{it is clear that}} the main 8-year American interlude (albeit important) was only a relatively short one in the decades-old struggle for hegemony in the Second Indochina War.|$|E
25|$|Reform {{began as}} a Western protest party {{in the minds of}} most Canadians. Its <b>heavy</b> <b>{{concentration}}</b> of support in the West netted it 52 seats. However, the Bloc Québécois's concentration of support in Quebec was slightly larger, leaving Reform three seats short of Official Opposition status despite finishing second in the popular vote. Even with these disappointments, the 1993 election was a tremendous success for Reform. In one stroke, it had replaced the Progressive Conservative Party as the major right-wing party in Canada.|$|E

25|$|In the 1993 federal election, the Bloc won 54 seats (out of 75) in Quebec, {{sweeping}} {{nearly all}} of the francophone ridings. Because the opposition vote in the rest of Canada was split between the Reform Party, the Progressive Conservative Party, and the New Democratic Party, the Bloc narrowly won the second largest number of seats in the House of Commons, and therefore became the official opposition. While Reform finished second in the national popular vote, the Bloc's <b>heavy</b> <b>concentration</b> of support in Quebec was slightly larger than Reform's concentration in the West.|$|E
25|$|Although T1 patrol {{spent about}} {{an hour on the}} airfield, none of the New Zealanders had been hit and none of their {{vehicles}} had been put out of action. The LRDG drivers were skilled at manoeuvering at high speed, thus making their vehicles difficult targets, {{while at the same time}} the gunners were capable of keeping up an accurate and <b>heavy</b> <b>concentration</b> of fire. Another possible factor in the lack of damage to the unit was that the numerous anti-aircraft guns defending the airfield had been unable to fire horizontally along the ground.|$|E
25|$|Another unit {{containing}} numerous Woodford County men was the 47th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment, {{which contained}} a <b>heavy</b> <b>concentration</b> {{from the county}} in its Companies B and I. Mustered into service at Peoria on August 16, 1861, the unit lost 30 killed and 100 wounded in the Battle of Corinth, Mississippi, in October 1862. The unit also suffered heavy casualties in a May 1863 charge during the initial phase of the Vicksburg Campaign. After the fall of Vicksburg in July 1863, the unit spent the duration guarding railroad lines, being discharged in October of that year.|$|E

25|$|However, {{news came}} {{that there was}} a <b>heavy</b> <b>concentration</b> of Filipino rebels at Pasong Santol a short {{distance}} beyond Salitran. The Battle of Pasong Santol {{was one of the most}} significant in the Caviteños' desire to keep their province under their control. It was the bloodiest battle fought in Cavite. It was during these series of battles in Cavite when Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo was elected in absentia as President of the newly formed revolutionary government. While some leaders of Magdalo faction of the Katipunan were busy fighting in Pasong Santol, members of the Magdiwang and Magdalo faction were discussing the form of government and elected its officers in the Tejeros Convention in Rosario, Cavite. In said Convention, Bonifacio was traitorously ousted from the Katipunan leadership by the combined Caviteño revolutionaries. Bonifacio and his brother Procopio were later executed by Aguinaldo's men.|$|E
25|$|In 1918, Dr. Albert L. Colston, {{chair of}} the Math Department at Manual Training High School, {{recommended}} establishing a technical high school for Brooklyn boys. His plan envisioned a <b>heavy</b> <b>concentration</b> of math, science, and drafting courses with parallel paths leading either to college or to a technical career in industry. By 1922, Dr. Colston's concept {{was approved by the}} Board of Education, and Brooklyn Technical High School opened in a converted warehouse at 49 Flatbush Avenue Extension, with 2,400 students. This location, {{in the shadow of the}} Manhattan Bridge, is the reason the school seal bears that bridge's image, rather than the more obvious symbol for the borough, the Brooklyn Bridge. Brooklyn Tech would occupy one more location before settling into its site at 29 Fort Greene Place, for which the groundbreaking was held in 1930.|$|E
25|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity at {{the risk}} of his life above and beyond the call of duty, as a division leader in Marine Fighting Squadron TWO TWENTY-ONE in action against enemy Japanese aerial forces in the Solomon Islands Area, April 7, 1943. In a daring flight to intercept a wave of 150 Japanese planes, First Lieutenant Swett unhesitatingly hurled his four-plane division into action against a formation of fifteen enemy bombers and during his dive personally exploded three hostile planes in mid-air with accurate and deadly fire. Although separated from his division while clearing the <b>heavy</b> <b>concentration</b> of anti-aircraft fire, he boldly attacked six enemy bombers, engaged the first four in turn, and unaided, shot them down in flames. Exhausting his ammunition as he closed the fifth Japanese bomber, he relentlessly drove his attack against terrific opposition which partially disabled his engine, shattered the windscreen and slashed his face. In spite of this, he brought his battered plane down with skillful precision in the water off Tulagi without further injury. The superb airmanship and tenacious fighting spirit which enabled First Lieutenant Swett to destroy eight enemy bombers in a single flight were in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.|$|E

500|$|Helicopter Squadron {{commander}} Lt. Col. Bill Harris {{was very}} upset. He {{concluded that the}} air rescue could not be attempted at that time due to the <b>heavy</b> <b>concentration</b> of North Vietnamese forces in the immediate area around Clark and Hambleton. He called Col. Muirhead {{and told him that}} they had to find another way. Hambleton was told to sit tight while they worked up an alternative plan. Hambleton had two survival radios, a first aid kit, two kinds of flares, a knife and a [...]38 caliber revolver, a compass and a map, an empty water bottle, and no food.|$|E
500|$|A {{distinctive}} {{feature of the}} late army is the appearance of independent units of artillery, which during the Principate {{appears to have been}} integral to the legions. Called ballistarii (from ballista = [...] "catapult"), 7 such units are listed in the Notitia, all but one belonging to the comitatus. But a number are denoted pseudocomitatenses, implying that they originally belonged to the border forces. The purpose of independent artillery units was presumably to permit <b>heavy</b> <b>concentration</b> of firepower, especially useful for sieges. However, it is likely that many ordinary regiments continued to possess integral artillery, especially in the border forces.|$|E
500|$|The England team which toured Australia in 1932–33 {{contained}} four fast bowlers {{and a few}} medium pacers; such a <b>heavy</b> <b>concentration</b> on pace {{was unusual}} at the time, and drew comment from the Australian press and players, including Bradman. On the journey, Jardine instructed his team on how to approach the tour and discussed tactics with several players, including Larwood; at this stage, {{he seems to have}} settled on leg theory, if not full bodyline, as his main tactic. Some players later reported that he told them to hate the Australians in order to defeat them, while instructing them to refer to Bradman as [...] "the little bastard." [...] Upon arrival, Jardine quickly alienated the press and crowds through his manner and approach.|$|E
5|$|The North Vietnamese also {{responded to}} the American aerial threat by the {{increased}} use of <b>heavy</b> <b>concentrations</b> of anti-aircraft artillery. By 1968 this was mainly composed of 37mm and 57mm radar-controlled weapons. The next year, 85mm and 100mm guns appeared, {{and by the end of}} Commando Hunt, over 1,500 guns defended the system.|$|R

500|$|The vast {{majority}} of Scarborough's population is composed of immigrants and descendants of immigrants who have arrived {{in the last four}} decades. In 2006, 57% of residents were foreign-born. Visible minorities make up 67.4% of the population. The population is 22.0% South Asian, 19.5% Chinese, 10.3% Black, and 6.5% Filipino. The remaining visible minority groups each represented less than 2% of the population. The immigrant population has created vibrant multicultural locales in various areas of Scarborough. One of the more notable among these is the <b>heavy</b> <b>concentration</b> of Chinese businesses and restaurants in the Agincourt neighbourhood. Many of Scarborough's main arteries, including segments of Kingston Road, Eglinton Avenue East and Lawrence Avenue East, feature Caribbean, Chinese, African, and Indian restaurants and shops, as well as businesses representing the other ethnic groups in the area. Scarborough also has several Sri Lankan Tamil-owned businesses that cater to the community.|$|E
500|$|In the morning, fresh {{orders were}} issued {{to lead the}} 4th Brigade to the left flank of 1st Parachute Brigade. B Company were ordered to provide {{supporting}} fire from the flanks of A Company's advance, which they successfully did before returning to battalion HQ and following up the advance. Lieutenant Colonel Sir Richard des Voeux ordered Waddy to take B Company through A Company's positions and continue the advance to the high ground, believing {{that there was not}} much opposition. [...] In fact A Company had been nearly destroyed, and Waddy passed numerous bodies on his way forward. As the company advanced, they were held up by what Waddy believes was a twin barrelled 20mm flak gun. He led a small group to attack it, but was spotted by a German sniper as they moved forward. A companion was killed instantly and Waddy, without his machine gun, could only fire ineffectively with his pistol. The sniper shot him in the groin and tried to hit him again as he started to crawl away, forcing Waddy to lay doggo for a moment before one of his men, a [...] tall Rhodesian soldier, carried him back to Company HQ. [...] Faced with a <b>heavy</b> <b>concentration</b> of enemy armour, the attack stalled and was then called off; the battalion had taken such heavy casualties that it was reduced to the size of what was essentially a single company.|$|E
