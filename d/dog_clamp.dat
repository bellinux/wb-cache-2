50|$|As Carol is {{awaiting}} {{trial in the}} grounds of a maximum security sanitorium, she sees one of the hippies break in and chase her through the grounds. Carol flees into the building and in trying to hide she enters a room containing a hideous experiment: four live <b>dogs,</b> <b>clamped</b> in an upright position, whimper helplessly, their abdomens sliced open and pinned with surgical clamps exposing their glistening innards and still beating hearts. Carol faints in horror. When she comes around, there is {{no trace of the}} threatening man. The sanitorium director thinks that Carol's ramblings about the intruder, and the disemboweled dogs, must have been another one of her elaborate hallucinations.|$|R

50|$|The film {{takes place}} in an office staffed by six suit-wearing dogs, or perhaps wolves, who hand-copy {{documents}} using pencils. One of the dog workers passes out because of overwork. The boss drops him through a trapdoor below the worker's desk, and replaces him with a robot that writes faster. Another worker yawns, and is also dropped through a trapdoor under his desk and replaced by a robot. Three more are eliminating for drinking water, sneezing and injury (the fourth worker desperately plugs his nose with two pencils, but is unable to keep from sneezing, propelling the pencils into the fifth one's head). They are replaced by more robots. The remaining worker, madly scribbling away, is shocked to discover that his boss {{has been replaced by}} a boss robot. When the latter leaves, the last worker decides to take action, and begins destroying the robots in various cartoony ways (blowing one up with a stick of dynamite, dropping another through its desk trapdoor, yet another by hitting it with different objects, and electrically shocking another into a pile of cinders). As the worker and the one remaining robot are locked in a life-or-death struggle, they see the boss robot threatening to push the trapdoor button. In a sudden instance of cooperating, they shove the trapdoor beneath the boss robot, who falls in. As the two workers peer down the open trapdoor, the dog becomes aware of the opportunity being presented and shoves the robot in. The worker <b>dog</b> <b>clamps</b> the boss's cigar between his teeth and pushes the trapdoor button, ending the film.|$|R
40|$|The {{experimental}} measuring {{of working}} loads upon {{the parts of}} rotating excavator is a complicated procedure given {{the complexity of the}} construction of the excavator and the specificity of exploitation conditions. Therefore, there are no uniform solutions and methods for this purpose, and any proposed solution is of great benefit to excavator users, as well to science studying this issue. This paper presents a preset methodology for measuring working loads of the <b>clamp</b> <b>dogs</b> on the carrying structure of the working wheel at the excavator used in surface coal mining. This methodology uses the default settings implicit to the strain gage method, which records the stresses resulting from external loads occurring within the clamp dogsâ€™ material using strain gages and measuring equipment. Within this concept, the paper shows the manner of determining the measuring points and setting up the strain gages on both <b>clamp</b> <b>dogs,</b> the connecting with the measuring installation and the equipment. Employing diagrams, the paper presents the measurement results of static and dynamic loads, as well as induced stress state by them...|$|R
40|$|Interpreting {{mitochondrial}} function as affected by comparative physiologic conditions is confounding because individual func-tional parameters are interdependent. Here, we studied muscle {{mitochondrial function}} in insulin-deficient diabetes using a novel, highly sensitive, and specific method to quantify ATP production simultaneously with {{reactive oxygen species}} (ROS) at clamped levels of inner mitochondrial membrane potential (DC), enabling more detailed study. We used a 2 -deoxyglucose (2 <b>DOG)</b> energy <b>clamp</b> to set DC at fixed levels and to quantify ATP production as 2 DOG conversion to 2 DOG-phosphate measured by one-dimensional 1 H and two-dimensional 1 H/ 13 C heteronuclear single quantum coherence nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. These techniques proved far more sensitive than conventional 31 P nuclear magnetic resonance and allowed high-throughput study of small mitochondrial isolates. Over conditions rangin...|$|R
60|$|Trafford was {{the only}} son of his parents. His {{father had been a}} young surgeon, more {{attracted}} by knowledge than practice, who had been killed by a scratch of the scalpel in an investigation upon ulcerative processes, at the age of twenty-nine. Trafford at that time was three years old, so that he had not the least memory of his father; but his mother, by a thousand almost unpremeditated touches, had built up a figure for him and a tradition that was shaping his life. She had loved her husband passionately, and when he died her love burnt up like a flame released, and made a god of the good she had known with him. She was then a very beautiful and active-minded woman of thirty, and she did her best to reconstruct her life; but she could find nothing so living in the world as the clear courage, the essential simplicity, and tender memories of the man she had lost. And she was the more devoted to him that he had had little weaknesses of temper and bearing, and that an outrageous campaign had been waged against him that did not cease with his death. He had, in some medical periodical, published drawings of a dead <b>dog</b> <b>clamped</b> to display a deformity, and these had been seized upon by a group of anti-vivisection fanatics as the representation of a vivisection. A libel action had been pending when he died; but there is no protection of the dead from libel. That monstrous lie met her on pamphlet cover, on hoardings, in sensational appeals; it seemed immortal, and she would have suffered the pains of a dozen suttees if she could have done so, to show the world how the power and tenderness of this alleged tormentor of helpless beasts had gripped one woman's heart. It counted enormously in her decision to remain a widow and concentrate her life upon her son.|$|R
40|$|Epinephrine {{increases}} net hepatic glucose output (NHGO) mainly via increased gluconeogenesis, whereas glucagon in-creases NHGO mainly via increased glycogenolysis. The aim of {{the present}} study was to determine how the two hormones interact in controlling glucose production. In 18 -h-fasted con-scious <b>dogs,</b> a pancreatic <b>clamp</b> initially fixed insulin and glucagon at basal levels, following which one of four protocols was instituted. In G E, glucagon (1. 5 ng kg 1 min 1; portally) and epinephrine (50 ng kg 1 min 1; peripherally) were increased; in G, glucagon was increased alone; in E, epinephrine was increased alone; and in C, neither was increased. In G, E, and C, glucose was infused to match the hyperglycemia seen in G E (250 mg/dl). The areas under the curve for the increase in NHGO, after the change in C was subtracted, were as follows: G 661 185, E 42...|$|R
40|$|The {{original}} {{purpose of this}} investigation was to determine whether complete sympathectomy woul d prevent or cure the type of experimental renal hypertension which can be produced in normal <b>dogs</b> by partial <b>clamping</b> of the renal arteries (1). Bacq, Brouha and Heyroans (2) claim that ablation of the sympathetics in the dog can prevent the hypertension that follows denervation of the carotid sinus and section of the depressor nerves. The integrity of the vasomotor system is evidently necessary for this type of hypertension. It was felt therefore that total sympathectomy, before and after the clamping of the renal arteries for the production of hypertension, would also give some estimate {{of the importance of the}} vasomotor nervous mechanism in the development of the renal type of hypertension. Before the work had progressed very far it was reported (3 - 5) that a lowering of the blood pressure occurs in some human eases of hypertension as a result of excision of the thoracic portion of the splanchni...|$|R
40|$|The renal and {{proximal}} tubule {{response to}} contralateral kidney exclusion was studied {{in a variety}} of circumstances. Recollection micropuncture studies were performed to assess the response to contralateral kidney clamping in the normal or a remnant kidney of the <b>dog.</b> Acute <b>clamping</b> of the contralateral kidney for a normal and unilateral remnant kidney resulted in marked reduction in proximal TF / P inulin ratios in the experimental kidney reflecting a 15 percent reduction in fluid reabsorption. Mean fractional excretion of sodium, potassium and water increased significantly in remnant kidney dogs but no significant change was observed in normal dogs except for potassium excretion. The marked reduction in proximal reabsorption occurred as soon as 5 - 15 minutes after contralateral kidney clamping and was compensated by distal reabsorption. Acute obstruction of the contralateral ureter results in a similar markedly reduced proximal tubular reabsorption. The reduction in proximal reabsorption induced by contralateral clamping occurred in the presence of reduced perfusion pressure and volume expansion and to some extent with renal denervation. When prostaglandin E 2 or acetycholine were infused prior to contralateral kidney clamping, proximal reabsorption remained at control levels and the contralateral clamping response was blocked. Similar blockade occurred after treatment with indomethacin. Acute reduction in nephron mass causes a marked depression of proximal tubular sodium and fluid absorption not obviously accounted for by hemodynamicphysical factors and humoral factors may be involved. The level of distal reabsorption to increased proximal delivery following contralateral clamping, determines the net urinary excretion...|$|R
40|$|Evidence has {{accumulated}} {{suggesting that the}} state of secondary hyperparathyroidism and the elevated blood levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) in uremia participate in the genesis of many uremic manifestations. The present study examined the role of PTH in glucose intolerance of chronic renal failure (CRF). Intravenous glucose tolerance tests (IVGTT) and euglycemic and hyperglycemic clamp studies were performed in dogs with CRF with (NPX) and without parathyroid glands (NPX-PTX). There were no significant differences among the plasma concentrations of electrolytes, degree of CRF, and its duration. The serum levels of PTH were elevated in NPX and undetectable in NPX-PTX. The NPX dogs displayed glucose intolerance after CRF and blood glucose concentrations during IVGTT were significantly (P less than 0. 01) higher than corresponding values before CRF. In contrast, blood glucose levels after IVGTT in NPX-PTX before and after CRF were not different. K-g rate fell after CRF from 2. 86 +/- 0. 48 to 1. 23 +/- 0. 18 %/min (P less than 0. 01) in NPX but remained unchanged in NPX-PTX (from 2. 41 +/- 0. 43 to 2. 86 +/- 0. 86 %/min) dogs. Blood insulin levels after IVGTT in NPX-PTX were more than twice higher than in NPX animals (P less than 0. 01) and for any given level of blood glucose concentration, the insulin levels were higher in NPX-PTX than NPX <b>dogs.</b> <b>Clamp</b> studies showed that the total amount of glucose utilized was significantly lower (P less than 0. 025) in NPX (6. 64 +/- 1. 13 mg/kg X min) than in NPX-PTX (10. 74 +/- 1. 1 mg/kg X min) dogs. The early, late, and total insulin responses were significantly (P less than 0. 025) greater in the NPX-PTX than NPX animals. The values for the total response were 143 +/- 28 vs. 71 +/- 10 microU/ml, P less than 0. 01. There {{was no significant difference in}} the ratio of glucose metabolized to the total insulin response, a measure of tissue sensitivity to insulin, between the two groups. The glucose metabolized to total insulin response ratio in NPX (5. 12 +/- 0. 76 mg/kg X min per microU/ml) and NPX-PTX (5. 18 +/- 0. 57 mg/kg X min per microU/ml) dogs was not different but significantly (P less than 0. 01) lower than in normal animals (9. 98 +/- 1. 26 mg/kg X min per microU/ml). The metabolic clearance rate of insulin was significantly (P less than 0. 02) reduced in both NPX (12. 1 +/- 0. 7 ml/kg X min) and NPX-PTX (12. 1 +/- 0. 9 ml/kg X min) dogs, as compared with normal animals (17. 4 +/- 1. 8 ml/kg X min). The basal hepatic glucose production was similar in both groups of animals and nor different from normal dogs; both the time course and the magnitude of suppression of hepatic glucose production by insulin were similar in both in groups. There were no differences in the binding affinity, binding sites concentration, and binding capacity of monocytes to insulin among NPX, NPX-PTX, and normal dogs. The data show that (a) glucose intolerance does not develop with CRF in the absence of PTH, (b) PTH does not affect metabolic clearance of insulin or tissue resistance to insulin in CRF, and (c) the normalization of metabolism in CRF in the absence of PTH is due to increased insulin secretion. The results indicate that excess PTH in CRF interferes with the ability of the beta-cells to augment insulin secretion appropriately in response to the insulin-resistant state...|$|R
40|$|Background. In {{spite of}} its {{widespread}} clinical application, there is little information on the cellular cardiac effects of articaine. In the present study, the concentration-dependent effects of articaine on action potential morphology and the underlying ion currents were studied in isolated canine ventricular cardiomyocytes. Methods. Action potentials were recorded from the enzymatically dispersed myocytes using sharp microelectrodes (16 cells from 3 <b>dogs).</b> Conventional patch <b>clamp</b> and action potential voltage clamp arrangements were used to {{study the effects of}} articaine on transmembrane ion currents (37 cells from 14 dogs). Results. Articaine-induced concentration-dependent changes in action potential configuration including shortening of the action potentials, reduction of their amplitude and maximum vel-ocity of depolarization (Vmax), suppression of early repolarization and depression of plateau. The EC 50 value obtained for the Vmax block was 162 (SD 30) mM. Both the reduction of Vmax and action potential shortening were frequency dependent: the former was more prominent at shorter, while the latter at longer pacing cycle lengths. A rate dependent Vmax block, having rapid offset kinetics [t 91 (20) ms], was observed in addition to tonic block. Under voltag...|$|R
40|$|These {{investigations}} {{are part of}} an attempt to study and interpret the intermediary metabolism of the kidneys in experimental renal hypertension. Hypertension was produced in <b>dogs</b> by the <b>clamping</b> procedure of Goldblatt and associates or by the silk perinephritis method of Page. Enzymatic studies were made by means of Warburg's manometric method. Cytochrome c was in addition determined spectrophotometrically. Tissue slices, homogenized tissue, and tissue extracts were used. A study of the cytochrome c concentration and the activities of the cytochrome oxidase and succinic dehydrogenase systems of kidneys from normal dogs and dogs with experimental renal hypertension was made. It was found that the cytochrome c concentration and the activities of the cytochrome oxidase and succinic dehydrogenase systems were markedly lower in the kidney slices and in the tissue suspensions from hypertensive dogs. Tissue suspensions and extracts of kidneys from hypertensive dogs showed an inhibitory effect on the activity of the cytochrome oxidase and succinic dehydrogenase, and the amine oxidase systems. Renin preparations also showed a marked inhibitory effect on the activities of cytochrome oxidase, succinic dehydrogenase, l-amino acid oxidase, and amine oxidase systems. A significant increase was found in the kidney of dogs whose other kidney had been removed or subjected to Goldblatt's or Page's technique in the activities of the cytochrome-cytochrome oxidase system, the succinic dehydrogenase system, and in the concentration of nucleotide-bound phosphorus, of flavin-adenine dinucleotide, and of the nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotides (coenzymes I and II). From the results of these studies it can be concluded that an increase in the concentration and activity of the respiratory enzymes precedes hypertrophy of the kidney. This {{can be explained by the}} assumption that an increase in the activity of the respiratory biocatalysts acts as a stimulus for cell growth and multiplication...|$|R
