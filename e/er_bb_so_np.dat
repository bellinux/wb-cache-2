We finally look at the coherent radiation sample so obtained and we find that, by energy conservation, it develops an exponential frequency damping corresponding to a "quasi-temperature" of order ħ/R, which is naturally related to a Hawking radiation and is suggestive of a black-hole signal at quantum level.
