40|$|This article reports an {{evaluation}} of the impact of three administrative technologies [...] Admission Scheduling (AS) Systems, Outpatient Surgery (OPS) Programs, and Preadmission Testing (PAT) Programs [...] on the number of acute care beds required by a hospital. The evaluation mechanism reported here is called the ADTECH Computerized Planning Model. ADTECH uses parameters of each technology, identified from previous literature and discussions with health care professionals, to predict the changes in bed requirements resulting from implementation of these programs. Data from eight hospitals of various characteristics and sizes were run to test the ADTECH model. The results from these test runs indicate that the proper implementation of AS, OPS, and PAT can significantly influence a <b>hospital's</b> required <b>bed</b> <b>complement...</b>|$|R

40|$|In Europe, the {{reduction}} of acute care <b>hospital</b> <b>beds</b> {{has been one of}} the measures implemented to restrict hospital expenditure. The aim of this study is to gain insight into the effect bed reductions have on the use of the remaining beds within different healthcare systems. We concentrated on two healthcare system elements: hospital financing system (per diem and global budget systems) and physician remuneration system (fee-for-service and salary systems). We also controlled for technological development and demand for healthcare. We used data from the OECD health data files of 10 North-Western European countries on <b>hospital</b> <b>bed</b> supply and use. The <b>hospital</b> <b>bed</b> indicators used were occupancy rate, average length of stay and admission rate. The data were analysed with multilevel analysis. We found some indication that the different financial incentives of hospital financing systems do indeed influence <b>hospital</b> <b>bed</b> use in the case of reductions in acute care <b>hospital</b> <b>bed</b> supply in different ways. However, we found significant effects only for the <b>hospital</b> <b>bed</b> use indicators "occupancy rate" and "admission rate". For physician financing systems, no significant effects were found.

Reports to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of <b>hospital</b> <b>bed</b> side-rail entrapment have increased. In this paper entrapment cases are reviewed and the population potentially at risk identified. METHODS: FDA's database was searched for events involving <b>hospital</b> <b>beds</b> from January 1985 to August 1995 and entrapment cases were identified. RESULTS: Of 111 entrapments, 65 % were associated with death and 23 % with injury.

40|$|Aim: To {{investigate}} {{the effectiveness of}} an early intervention in psychosis (EIP) service on engagement and <b>hospital</b> <b>bed</b> usage, post-discharge. A secondary aim was to identify {{if there was a}} subgroup of patients with ‚Äòpoor outcomes‚Äô. Method: A naturalistic study comparing engagement and <b>hospital</b> <b>bed</b> day usage of individuals who received treatment from an EIP service (n = 75) with those who presented before the service was established (n = 113). Results: The EIP service demonstrated better engagement with service users in year 5 (P = 0. 001). No significant differences were observed on <b>hospital</b> <b>bed</b> day usage. When ‚Äòpoor outcome‚Äô cases were removed, a trend towards lower bed usage in EIP services emerged (P = 0. 139). Conclusion: EIP services improve engagement with service users. There was not a significant reduction in <b>hospital</b> <b>bed</b> usage. However, advantages could be masked by {{a relatively small number of}} individuals with ‚Äòpoor outcomes...|$|R
