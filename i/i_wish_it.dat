25|$|In December 2013 in a blog {{article for}} The Spectator website {{published}} shortly after Nelson Mandela died, Rod Liddle wrote of BBC coverage: But for Christ's sake BBC, {{give it a}} bloody break for five minutes, will you? It's as if the poor bugger now has to bear your entire self-flagellating white post-colonial bien pensant guilt; look! Famous nice black man dies! Let's re-run {{the entire history of}} South Africa. That's better than watching the country we're in being flattened by a storm. He also wrote:Look; I'm sorry Nelson Mandela is dead. It happens quite often to people in their 90s who have been very ill, even famous people, but I'm sure that doesn't lessen the sadness for many of us. I never met the man but, on balance, I {{came to the conclusion that}} he was a force for good rather than ill. I think I came to that rather banal and broad brush conclusion twenty years ago, or maybe fifteen. So, I'm sorry he's dead, <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>it</b> were otherwise.|$|E

Here sociobiology has had {{and will continue to}} have success. And here <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>it</b> well. For it represents an extension of basic Darwinism to a realm where it should apply." ...|$|E

Although cast as the female lead, when the film was delayed, Qureshi left the project to honour other work commitments. When asked whether she had any regrets, she said: [...] "I have no regrets. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>it</b> had worked out, but it didn't. I am not someone who sits and laments over things. I was approached for several other south films too, but the roles weren't what I was looking for".|$|E

500|$|Rob Owen, {{television}} {{editor of}} the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, said that the documentary provided an interesting, entertaining and detailed look {{behind the scenes of}} the show. Owen said that this was [...] "rare, because TV doesn't usually reveal details about itself. It's nice to see PBS pulling back the curtain on its competition, and <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>it</b> happened more often." [...] Manuel Mendoza of The Dallas Morning News praised it, calling it [...] "a documentary as rare to public TV as Homicide is to commercial television", but said that it [...] "falls short of being definitive" [...] because it cannot address all elements of the series due to its brief running time. Several commentators praised the humorous scene in the documentary in which Yoshimura goes line-by-line through his script and replaces curse words based on orders from NBC censors.|$|E
500|$|At the 2014 Hero Complex Film Festival, Sigourney Weaver {{hinted that}} she'd be {{interested}} in returning {{to the role of}} Ripley, stating that Resurrection's ending [...] "feels incomplete to me. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>it</b> didn't, but it does. We left it hanging. And there's a way to finish this story that i think would be satisfying to me and the many fans." [...] She also stated regarding the hybrid character that [...] "Had we done a fifth one, I don't doubt that her humanity would have prevailed. I do feel like there is more story to tell. I feel a longing from fans for the story to be finished. I could imagine a situation where we finish telling the story." [...] She was quoted: [...] "I don't think Alien belongs on Earth popping out of a haystack, which is where I was afraid it was going to go. I feel it should take place in {{the far reaches of the}} universe where no one in their right mind would go. There are very few filmmakers that I can think of that I would want to entrust this to." ...|$|E
500|$|Teresa Cristina {{died three}} weeks after their arrival in Europe, and Isabel and her family moved to another place while Pedro settled first in Cannes and later in Paris. Pedro's {{last couple of years}} were lonely and melancholic, as he lived in modest hotels without money and writing in his journal of dreams in which he was allowed to return to Brazil. He never {{supported}} a restoration of the monarchy, once stating that he had no desire [...] "to return to the position which I occupied, especially not by means of conspiracy of any sort." [...] One day he caught an infection that progressed quickly into pneumonia. Pedro rapidly declined and died at 00:35 on 5 December 1891 surrounded by his family. His last words were [...] "May God grant me these last wishes—peace and prosperity for Brazil". While the body was being prepared, a sealed package in the room was found, and next to it a message written by the Emperor himself: [...] "It is soil from my country, <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>it</b> to be placed in my coffin in case I die away from my fatherland." ...|$|E

On June 2, 2011, in an interview with Vibe, Game revealed the album would feature an upcoming rapper Tyler, the Creator on a track titled [...] "Martians vs. Goblins". He also revealed the album featured a Dr. Dre produced song titled [...] "Dead People" [...] about his father, and described it as a [...] "sort of like a dream, but <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>it</b> would’ve came true when I was a kid, so I kind of lived it out."

2500|$|George Lutz {{maintained}} that {{events in the}} book were [...] "mostly true" [...] and denied any suggestion of dishonesty on his part. In June 1979, George and Kathy Lutz took a polygraph test relating to their experiences at the house. The polygraph tests were performed by Chris Gugas and Michael Rice who, at the time, were reportedly among the top 5 polygraph experts in America. The results, in Mr. Rice's opinion, did not indicate lying. In October 2000, The History Channel broadcast Amityville: The Haunting and Amityville: Horror or Hoax?, a two-part documentary made by horror screenwriter/producer Daniel Farrands to mark the 25th anniversary of the case. George Lutz commented in an interview for the program: [...] "I believe this has stayed alive for 25 years because it's a true story. It doesn't mean that everything that has ever been said about it is true. It's certainly not a hoax. It's real easy to call something a hoax. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>it</b> was. It's not." ...|$|E
2500|$|Burr made {{repeated}} {{trips on}} behalf of the United Service Organizations (USO). He toured both Korea and Vietnam during wartime and once spent six months touring Korea, Japan, and the Philippines. He sometimes organized his own troupe and toured bases both in the U.S. and overseas, often small installations that the USO did not serve, like one tour of Greenland, Baffinland, Newfoundland and Labrador. Returning from Vietnam in 1965, he made a speaking tour of the U.S. to advocate an intensified war effort. As the war became more controversial, he modified his tone, called for more attention to the sacrifice of the troops, and said, [...] "My only position on the war is that <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>it</b> were over." [...] In October 1967, NBC aired Raymond Burr Visits Vietnam, a documentary of one of his visits. The reception was mixed. [...] "The impressions he came up with are neither weighty nor particularly revealing", wrote the Chicago Tribune; the Los Angeles Times called Burr's questions [...] "intelligent and elicited some interesting replies".|$|E

I want you to know... that the sound of the conga nourishes me, the sound of the frying pans gives me life and the sound of the bocú drives me crazy. [...] Several days prior to the beginning of rehearsals, I went to see a doctor; I felt overwhelmed, sad, pensive. He prescribed and gave me some injections, and I felt absolutely no different, but as soon as I heard the sound of the first bocú, I was completely cured, I felt strong and ready for anything. And I advise those who are unhappy and listless to get an invigorating injection of bocú, conga and frying pans and you’ll be OK in 24 hours.” (Pérez II 1988:22-3) ...|$|E

[...] Peter Rainer of the Christian Science Monitor also gave the film a positive review. He, like Puig, also praised DiCaprio's acting, stating: [...] "As strong as Blood Diamond is in its best moments, <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>it</b> had been even harder-edged. DiCaprio is remarkable - his work is almost on par with his performance this year in The Departed." ...|$|E
2500|$|From Peterhoff, Maria Pavlovna went to Grand Duchess Elisabeth’s rural estate, Ilinskoe, near Moscow, where Wilhelm {{joined them}} for a month before he left on a cruise to America. The young couple {{maintained}} their intimacy through letters. Maria imagined herself in love: “It’s lovely to have somebody, even far away, who love you more than anything and whom you love more than everybody on earth“, she wrote to him. In October, Wilhelm returned to Russia joining Grand Duchess Maria and her brother Dimitri who introduced the Swedish prince to their father, Grand Duke Paul, who was permitted {{to come back to}} Russia for his daughter's wedding set to take place after she turned eighteen the next April. At Wilhelm's departure, Maria wrote to him: [...] " [...] I love you, so much with every day, every hour more and more. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>it</b> were April now, how lovely it would be". [...] In her book of memoirs, written more than 20 years later, the grand duchess made different claims: [...] " [...] I was using Wilhelm, in a sense, only to obtain my freedom". [...] As the wedding day approached, she began to have doubts and wished to break off the engagement, but Princess Irene of Hesse who was visiting her sister, Grand Duchess Elisabeth Feodorovna, persuaded her otherwise. Soon Maria Pavlovna was once again looking forward with enthusiasm to a new life. The wedding took place at Tsarskoye Selo on [...]|$|E
