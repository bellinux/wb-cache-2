40|$|The {{immune system}} of fish {{provides}} a critical barrier {{to protect against}} infectious diseases caused by pathogens in the environment. It is known that the endocrine system can modulate immune function in fish, as can exposure to xenobiotics present in the aquatic environment. The overarching objective of the five studies presented here {{was to investigate the}} effects of endocrine hormones (17 β-estradiol (E 2), cortisol) and endocrine disrupting pesticides and formulants (nonylphenol, atrazine, permethrin, piperonyl butoxide, chlorothalonil, pentachlorophenol and cypermethrin) on immune function in juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) using comprehensive panels of immune function assays at multiple levels of biological organization. In addition, the use of functional assays in combination with genomic techniques (quantitative polymerase chain reaction, QPCR; microarrays) was intended to elucidate some of the mechanisms through which immunotoxic effects may be occurring. Following confirmation that all 4 forms of rainbow trout estrogen receptor (ERs) mRNA was present in leukocytes, it was found that exposure of leukocytes to lipopolysaccharide (a mitogen that stimulates cellular proliferation) led to down-regulation of both ERα 1 and ERα 2, suggesting a role for the ER (and E 2) in cell cycle control and proliferation. Exposure of fish to exogenous E 2 (in water) led to several alterations in lymphocyte function, as well as differentially regulating the transcription of both ERα 1 and ERα 2 in leukocytes. It was also found that all of the pesticides or formulants tested, except cypermethrin, were immunotoxic or cytotoxic and may pose a risk to fish health. Nonylphenol and atrazine exposure increased disease susceptibility, and microarray analysis of liver from exposed fish showed that a broad range of immune-related functions were altered at the molecular level. Overall, the studies detailed here provide new insight (e. g. presence of ER mRNA in leukocytes, microarray data analysis revealing affected biological processes and pathways) into potential mechanisms underlying the immunomodulatory effects of both endocrine hormones and endocrine disrupting pesticides. Since many of the immunotoxic effects of pesticide or <b>formulant</b> exposure occurred at environmentally relevant concentrations, these chemicals may pose a risk to the immunological health of wild fish populations living in impacted aquatic environments...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis work focuses {{simultaneously}} on {{both the}} scaffolding and gap filling phases of de nouveau genome assembly. Given a set of contigs and their relationships [...] overlaps and/or remoteness in terms of distances between them [...] we propose an optimization-based approach for finding the genome sequence as a longest sequence {{that is consistent with}} the given contig and linkage information. Specifically, we define a graph, which we call a contig graph, that encodes information about contigs and overlaps and mate-pair distances between them, and reduce the scaffolding problem to the problem of finding a longest simple path in that graph such that as many as possible mate-pairs distances are satisfied. Since both conditions cannot generally be simultaneously satisfied, our objective function is a linear combination of the path length and penalties for distance mismatches. ​​Unlike the shortest path problem with non-negative weights, for which efficient polynomial-time algorithms exist, the longest weighted path problem is NP-hard. We solve this problem by reformulating it as a mixed integer linear program (MILP) and develop a method that exactly solves the resulting program on genomes of up to 165 contigs and up to 6682 binary variables. An advantage of our approach is that the modeling of scaffolding as a longest path problem allows one to solve simultaneously several subtasks specific for this problem like: contig orientation and ordering, repeats, gap filling, and scaffold extension, which in other approaches are targeted as separate problems. We are not aware of previous approaches on scaffolding based on the longest path problem reduction. A drawback of the typically used strategy of constructing a set of disjoint paths, rather than a single path, is that it would require additional steps of gap filling and scaffold extension, involving additional work. Moreover, it would make impossible to find a provably optimal final solution, since, even if each separate problem is implemented optimally, their combination may not be optimal. We tested this model on a set of chloroplast and bacteria genome data and showed that it allows to assemble the complete genome as a single scaffold. Compared to the publicly available scaffolding tools that we have tested, our solution produces assemblies of significantly higher quality. Ce travail porte particulièrement sur les étapes de scaffolding et de gap-filling lors de l’assemblage de novo d’un génome. Etant donné un ensemble de contigs et leurs relations (chevauchement et/ou éloignement), nous proposons une approche basée sur l’optimisation, quiconsiste à trouver le plus long assemblage possible consistant avec les distances attendues. Nous résolvons ce problème en le <b>formulant</b> sous la forme d’une programme mixte en nombres entiers (MILP). Notre méthode permet de résoudre exactement des instances comptant jusqu’à 6682 variables binaires pour 165 contigs. L’un des avantages de notre modélisation est qu’elle permet de résoudre simultanément différentes sous taches spécifiques à l’assemblage complet d’un génome : déterminer l’orientation de chaque contig, ordonnancer les répétitions, compléter les scaffolds et les étendre en un assemblage unique etc... Ce qui constitue d’ordinaire un ensemble de problèmes à traiter séquentiellement. (Nécessitant alors des solutions spécifiques pour chacun d’entre eux). A notre connaissance, aucune autre approche ne propose de réduire le problème de l’assemblage génomique à celui de la recherche du plus long chemin...|$|E
40|$|Our {{research}} work {{is focused on}} innovation and more specifically {{on the role of}} information in the product's conception process. Web 2. 0 is quickly growing because contents are mostly generated by users and it represents now a wide and borderless source of information {{that can be used for}} innovation purposes. If Web improved information search techniques in technological and competitive surveys, we argue that Web 2. 0 allow a better knowledge of customers needs and expectations. We propose in this thesis a qualitative and quantitative analysis of information generated or relayed by Web 2. 0 users regarding their relevance into the innovation process. Our experiments deal with the study of Social Bookmarking and especially the Delicious. com Web application that allows users to memorize and share their bookmarks' lists. We would show that regarding to the increasing volume of information indexed by search engines, exploring this co-constructed directory offers a significant improvement in Web information retrieval. We also work on the social aspect of social bookmarking by proposing a way to sort participants in order to detect expert or influent users on a particular subject. Our study related to users comments on Amazon. com shows that customers are more and more involved into the innovation process of companies by providing them interesting and relevant comments about the product they bought. We therefore recommend meanings to extract then to analysis those customers feedbacks to improve the way that products are conceived. Finally, we define an innovation method that consists in setting up a permanent survey of Web 2. 0 activities then to produce a document named " expectations notes ". that could be used for directing the further innovation processes. Nos travaux de recherche portent sur l'innovation et plus particulièrement sur le rôle de l'information dans la conception de produits. Le Web 2. 0 repose sur la production de contenus par les internautes et constitue une source permanente et intarissable d'informations que les entreprises peuvent utiliser à des fins d'innovation, car si le Web a modifié les techniques de recherche d'informations et renforcé le travail de veille technologique, concurrentielle et commerciale, nous montrons que le Web 2. 0 permet une meilleure connaissance des attentes et des besoins des consommateurs. Nous proposons l'analyse qualitative et quantitative des informations produites ou relayées par les internautes sous l'angle de leur pertinence au regard d'une démarche d'innovation. Nos expérimentations portent tout d'abord sur l'étude des Signets Sociaux (Social Bookmarking), nous montrons que l'exploration de ces annuaires thématiques co-constitués offre une alternative significative pour la recherche d'informations. Nous proposons une typologie des participants à cette plateforme afin de faciliter la détection d'usagers experts ou influents dans un domaine en particulier. Notre étude des commentaires sur le site de vente en ligne " Amazon. com ", montre que les clients participent de l'innovation incrémentale des entreprises en <b>formulant</b> des critiques pertinentes et constructives. Nous proposons alors une méthode d'extraction puis d'analyse de ces commentaires qui s'intègre aux dispositifs de veille an amont du projet d'innovation. Enfin, nous formulons les bases d'une méthode d'innovation qui consiste à mettre en place une observation permanente du Web 2. 0 et dont l'objectif consiste à la production d'un document de référence destiné à orienter les innovations de l'entreprise : le " cahier des attentes "...|$|E

40|$|Background The EU Council and Parliament {{recently}} {{agreed on}} a new regulation that will implement a new EU‐wide, harmonized system for the authorization for biocidal products. Such products are in most cases multi‐component mixtures {{of one or more}} active substances plus a range of co <b>formulants</b> that serve different purposes, e. g. as stabilizers or preservatives. They are only allowed on the European market if their intended use does not lead to unacceptable risks for the environment. Consequently, the assessment of possible combination effects is a critically important step during the regulatory environmental risk assessment of biocidal products. However, no specific guidance is at hand on how combination effects should be accounted for during the regulatory environmental risk assessment of biocidal products. Results and Conclusions A tiered approach was developed that accommodates different data situations, optimizes resource usage, limits biotesting as far as possible and ensures adequate protection of the environment. It mainly builds on using Concentration Addition as a component‐based approach for mixture toxicity prediction, complemented by whole product tests where appropriate. Concentration Addition is either approximated by summing up PEC/PNEC ratios or as sums of toxic units. The competing concept of Independent Action was assessed as not being suitable for incorporation into a tiered approach without explicit confirmatory studies, as it might otherwise lead to an underestimation of the actual environmental risk.

40|$|In {{the general}} {{structure}} of occupational diseases, {{a large proportion}} belongs to acute poisoning with pesticides (mainly group cases). However, today {{it is impossible to}} drop the use of pesticides in agriculture. Their application ensures high biological and economic efficiency of the latter, reduces losses of the yield. The purpose of the work was to predict the possibility of acute toxic effects in agricultural workers when working with combined formulations based on difenoconazole. Materials and methods. To assess the influence on the organism of the workers of the above-mentioned substances and formulations on their basis, the coefficient of inhalation poisoning possibility (CIPP), the coefficient of selective action of the pesticide in inhalation effect (CSAing) and the selective action of the pesticide in the dermal effect (CSAderm) were calculated. Results. Calculated values of CSAing (103. 4 - 4701. 2) and CSAderm (237. 4 - 12345. 7) for all investigated active substances were more than 100, this indicates to a rather high selectivity of their action. By the CSAing value formulations Celeste Top, Celeste Trio, Dinali, Cydeli Top belong to pesticides with a relatively low selectivity of action when they are inhaled by workers in the process of crops treating, the remaining formulations have a sufficient selectivity of action in inhalation intake. In addition, {{it should be noted that}} in general, for all combined preparations CSA values are significantly lower than for separate active ingredients, in addition to the above assumption, can be explained by the presence of other <b>formulants</b> in the preparation that may have not significant but toxic effect on the body of workers. All investigated substances in the probability of occurrence of acute poisoning with the use of combined preparations on their basis are related to the 4 th grade of danger according to State Standards 8. 8. 1. 002 - 98. There was proved relative safety in case of penetration into the organism of agricultural workers by percutaneous and inhalational way of all studied active ingredients and most of the formulations on their basis...|$|R

My university thesis - summarized in this article - questioned this possibility by investigating how we live, in everyday life, in flood-prone areas. Through an ethnographic piece of work, in particular a "discreet resident observation", the thesis seeks to identify what the inhabitants exchange about floods and how they organize their practices in relation to the risk. The field study, Lattes, is an upper middle-class suburban neighborhood located in the South East of France (Mediterranean coast). This city was built on wetlands and remains vulnerable to flash floods. This case study allows us to grasp the collective mechanisms at stake {{in the construction of the}} invisibility of a danger. The high visibility of the protection made by local policies and the comforting effect of normative sharing provided a normalization of people's trust in the protection. Through interactions, statements are built to be acceptable. It is more comfortable to "de-dramatize" than to dramatize: statements of relativism circulate more than the ones that open on the horizon of danger. Moreover, the current development of a "logic of safety" for urban risks reduction contradicts the prevention of flooding. Above all, neither the links between inhabitants nor the links with their living environment provide a sufficient collective base for the deployment of a risk culture. Investiguer la possibilité d'une « culture du risque » : Ethnographie de l'habiter en milieu exposé… et prisé. Séverine DURAND Les politiques de gestion des risques appellent à favoriser la prévention et à développer une « culture du risque » dans les zones exposées afin d'éviter l'écueil de l'oubli, pointé du doigt après une catastrophe. L'objet de la thèse, dont les résultats sont présentés dans cet article, fut de questionner cette possibilité en investiguant comment on habite, au quotidien, un milieu exposé aux inondations. Forte d'un travail ethno-graphique sur le temps long la thèse questionne ce qui circule à propos des inondations, comment des habitants s'emparent de la question et organisent leurs pratiques en fonction du risque. Le terrain d'étude est une ville prisée du Sud-est de la France qui a connu une explosion démographique récente. Ce cas d'étude permet de comprendre les mécanismes collectivement construits de mise en invisibilité du danger. La mise en visibilité des mesures de protection et l'effet confortant du partage normatif encouragent la normalisation de la confiance en la protection. Dans l'interaction, les énoncés se <b>formulant</b> sans cesse dans le souci de leur acceptabilité, dédramatiser est plus confortable que de dramatiser : les énoncés de relativisation du risque circulent davantage que ceux ouvrant sur l'horizon du danger. Surtout, ni les liens entre les habitants ni les liens des habitants au milieu ne fournissent le socle suffisant à l'élaboration collective que nécessite le déploiement d'une « culture du risque ».
