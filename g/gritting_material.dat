Where ploughing and rubbing essentially mean the energy is being applied less efficiently {{in terms of}} material removal. Such phenomena usually occurs before or after cutting. Based on this distinction, {{it is important to}} identify the effects of these different phenomena experienced during grinding. Acoustic emission (AE) of the <b>material</b> <b>grit</b> interaction is considered the most sensitive monitoring process to investigate such miniscule material change. For this reason, two AE sensors were used to pick up energy information (one verifying the other) correlated to material measurements of the horizontal scratch groove profiles. Such material measurements would display both the material plastic deformation and material removal mechanisms. Accurate material surface profile measurements of the cut groove were made using the Fogale Photomap Profiler which enables the comparison between the corresponding AE signal scratch data. By using short-time Fourier transforms (STFT) and filtration, the salient features for identifying and classifying the phenomena were more distinct between the three different levels of singlegrit (SG) phenomena. Given such close data segregation between the phenomenon data sets, fuzzy clustering/genetic algorithm (GA) classification techniques were used to classify and verify the demarcation of SG phenomena. After the cutting, ploughing and rubbing gave a high confidence in terms of classification accuracy, the results from the unit/micro-event to the multi/macro-event, both 1 -μm and 0. 1 -mm grinding test data, were applied to the named classifier for classification. Interesting output results correlated for the classifier signifying a distinction that there is more cutting utilisation than both ploughing and rubbing as the interaction between grit and workpiece become more involved (measured depth of cut increases). With the said classifier technique it is possible to get a percentage utilisation of the <b>grit</b> and <b>material</b> interaction phenomena. In addition, optimised fuzzy clustering was verified against a classification and regression tree (CART) rule-based system giving transparent rule classification.

40|$|Because many onsite {{treatment}} {{alternatives are}} sensitive to organic loading rate, high-strength wastewaters may require additional treatment steps to ultimately meet environmental discharge or reuse goals. Among the individual home options that increase the organic strength of the wastewater (see chapter 3) are water conservation and use of garbage grinders (disposals). Commercial wastewater may also be high in organic concentration and, thus, organic loading. The database on such wastewaters is extremely limited for use in design of OWTSs. The major concern caused by high organic loadings in the pretreated wastewater is higher organic loadings (e. g., BOD) to the infiltrative surface of the SWIS, which could result in clogging. A certain degree of clogging at the interface of infiltration trenches and the surrounding soil is expected and helps the soil absorption field function properly. The clogging layer, or biomat, which forms at this interface, is composed of organic material, trapped colloidal matter, bacteria, and microorganisms and their by-products. The biomat may slow the infiltrative capacity of the SWIS, but it increases effluent treatment time under unsaturated aerobic conditions (in the vadose zone below the trenches). Physical clogging occurs when solid <b>material</b> such as <b>grit,</b> organic <b>material,</b> and grease is carried in the effluent beyond the septic tank to the soil adsorption field and deposited on the biomat. Biological clogging generally occurs with excessive organic loading to the biomat, which results in excess microbial growth that restricts the passage of effluent into the soil.

40|$|Current {{methods for}} {{removing}} weathered oil are heavily reliant on chemical dispersants and physical removal. These methodologies pose problems as rarely {{is all the}} oil removed without further disruption to the ecosystem or the addition of further chemical treatments. This study investigated {{the diversity of the}} hydrocarbonoclastic community naturally present on weathered crude oil and its potential to degrade hydrocarbons in marine environments, through the use of seawater mesocosms (200 ml). Examination of the native seawater community&# 039;s capabilities of utilizing hydrocarbons as their sole carbon source identified a maximum recovery of just 6. 6 x 101 CFU/ml, with these values dramatically increased in the weathered oil, reaching 4. 1 x 104 CFU/ml. Having identified that a significant hydrocarbonoclastic community was available, replicate seawater mesocosms were used to follow the natural degradation of weathered crude oil over an 8 week period bioremediation strategy. By day 56, the natural inoculums degraded the soluble hydrocarbons to below detectable levels and biodegradation of the residual oil reached 66 %. The natural crude oil community showed it was a valuable resource for bioremediation of pollutant environments. Having established natural attenuation as a treatment method in small scale weathered crude oil degradation, enhanced bioremediation treatment methods were developed. To date, limited studies have focused on the development of a sustainable method of marine oil removal using a microbial community attached to a carrier. In this study, we used a tank mesocosm system (50 l) to follow the degradation of weathered oil (10 g l- 1) using a bacterial consortium mobilised onto different carrier materials (alginate or shell grit). GCMS analysis demonstrated that the extent of hydrocarbon degradation was dependent upon the carrier material. Augmentation of shell grit with nutrients and exogenous hydrocarbon degraders resulted in 75 (± 14) % removal of &gt;C 32 hydrocarbons after 12 weeks compared to 20 (± 14) % for the alginate carrier and 20 (± 1. 42) % for the seawater control. Therefore, the shell <b>grit</b> carrier <b>material</b> was selected as the optimal remediation system further assessed in a pilot scale bioremediation study. The pilot scale application (5000 l) examined the ability of the augmented shell carrier material to degrade weathered crude oil (10 g l- 1) in a marine simulated environment and assessed ecotoxicity impacts associated with the introduction and biodegradation of oil. Total petroleum hydrocarbon degradation was effectively reduced by 53 (± 5. 75) % within 27 weeks. 16 S rRNA sequence analysis was used to identify species present during the bioremediation process. In this study, we used stable isotope probing (SIP) to monitored the utilization rate of unlabeled (12 C) and labeled (13 C) substrates, benzene (0. 559 μl l- 1 h- 1) and hexadecane (0. 330 μl l- 1 h- 1) in pre-exposed seawater over 72 h. Microbial community analysis by RNA-SIP DGGE showed substantial differences between the banding pattern of 12 C and 13 C communities. Phylogenetic analysis of 16 S rRNA gene sequences revealed the presence of known hydrocarbon degraders including Alcanivorax, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas and Roseobacter.

However, it is intrinsically brittle at room temperature. This thesis investigates {{the potential for}} the use of grinding to process TiAl into useful shapes. Grinding is far from completely understood, and many aspects of the individual mechanical interactions of the abrasive <b>grit</b> with the <b>material</b> and their effect on surface integrity are unknown. The development of new synthetic diamond superabrasives in which shape and size can be controlled raises the question of the influence of those variables on the surface integrity. The goal of this work is to better understand the fundamentals of the abrasive grit/material interaction in grinding operations. Experimental, analytical, and numerical work was done to characterize and predict the resultant deformation and surface integrity on ground lamellar gamma-TiAl. Grinding tests were carried out, by analyzing the effects of grit size and shape, workpiece speed, wheel depth of cut, and wear on the subsurface plastic deformation depth (PDD). A practical method to assess the PDD is introduced based on the measurement of the lateral material flow by 3 D non-contact surface profilometry. This method combines the quantitative capabilities of the microhardness measurement with the sensitivity of Nomarski microscopy. The scope and limitations of this technique are analyzed. Mechanical properties were obtained by quasi-static and split Hopkinson bar compression tests. Residual stress plots were obtained by x-ray, and surface roughness and cracking were evaluated. The abrasive grit/material interaction was accounted by modeling the force per abrasive grit for different grinding conditions, and studying its correlation to the PDD. Numerical models of this interaction were used to analyze boundary conditions, and abrasive size effects on the PDD. An explicit 2 D triple planar slip crystal plasticity model of single point scratching was used to analyze the effects of lamellae orientation, material anisotropy, and grain boundaries on the deformation.

It increased with grain bulk density and the ratio of hard to soft endosperm. All measured properties were highly dependent on the moisture content. For the same hybrid, SHT hardness increased and the grain bulk density decreased when the moisture content of the com grains increased. A roller-milling test was also developed to study the dry milling characteristics of these com hybrids. During milling, the breaking force measured in the roller-milling test increased with grain hardness. Analysis of particle size distributions in the ground samples after the modified Stenvert Hardness tests and the roller-milling tests showed that grit recovery rate increased with the grain hardness. Grits produced from hybrids harvested in the 92 - 93 and the 94 - 95 seasons, along with other grits and starches commercially manufactured in New Zealand, were used for the extrusion experiments. A new Slit-Die-Viscometer (SDV) was developed to measure the viscosity of extrudate melts on-line. Unlike many other viscometers used on-line, the operation of the new SDV did not interfere with the operating conditions of the extruder. The rheological properties and the degree of starch gelatinisation were affected by the operating conditions of the extruder and the characteristics of the raw materials: It was found that the melt viscosity decreased as moisture content increased. The apparent viscosity had a maximum value at barrel temperature of about 130 DC, changed very little when screw speed increased at constant feed, and decreased slightly when the feed increased at constant screw speed. The grits were less gelatinised at high moisture content. The degree of starch gelatinisation increased slightly with screw speed and linearly with barrel temperature between 90 DC and 130 DC. At barrel temperatures higher than 130 DC, the extrudate was almost fully gelatinised. Melts produced with starch of high amylopectin content had an overall lower viscosity with less shear thinning and a higher degree of starch gelatinisation than that produced with starch of high amylose content. Grit size affected the rheological properties and the degree of starch gelatinisation. Melts produced from medium and coarse grits had a lower viscosity and a lower degree of starch gelatinisation than that produced with fine grits. The effect of different hybrids of the same season on the rheological properties of the melt was negligible. However, the rheological properties were affected by the methods used to produce the grits. Grits from degermed grains had less oil and produced melts with lower viscosity and less shear thinning than grits from whole grains (higher oil content) ...|$|R

H 577 P ISE 2016 Zhangxxiii, 210 pages :color illustrationsTo {{ensure the}} surface finish and form {{accuracy}} simultaneously, ultra-precision grinding has been widely employed in the machining of hard and brittle materials, such as engineering composites, carbides, optical glasses, and cermet materials. However, there are still great challenges in achieving an optical mirror surface with good surface integrity. Indeed, the combined effects of material properties, processing parameters and wheel wear on the surface generation and damage mechanism still need further investigation in ultra-precision diamond grinding of brittle materials. Besides, as a potential candidate for machining functional surface, ultra-precision grinding with a sharp edge wheel has been developed, but its wide application still need more efforts and exploration. In this thesis, the theoretical and experimental study on the surface damage mechanism and surface generation of typical engineering ceramics (WC/Co and RB-SiC/Si) under ultra-precision grinding with a sharp edge wheel is divided into four parts. In the first part, Vickers-indentation and single point diamond scratch tests are firstly utilized to investigate the damage mechanism induced by {{the interaction between the}} abrasive <b>grit</b> and workpiece <b>materials.</b> Moreover, to analyze the surface damage mechanism in high spindle speed grinding (HSSG), a novel plunge grinding experiment is conducted at the creep feed condition, and the typical surface characteristics between WC/Co and RB-SiC/Si are analyzed and compared. The second part is dedicated to investigate the grinding induced surface damage mechanism and the surface generation in relation to the machining parameters, spindle vibration and material removal rate. New grinding induced damage mechanisms, such as amorphization of SiC, preferred phase growth and the impact of C segregation, are identified. In addition, the non-uniform surface finish of a specific workpiece is explored experimentally and theoretically. The effects of materials microstructure on the surface damage mechanism and surface generation is then studied in the third part, focusing on the effect of binder addition. Even though Co and Si can improve the density and toughness of bulk materials, the different mechanical properties between the composition phases and the existence of phase boundaries both contributed to the non-uniform material removal rate and resulted in the formation of reliefs, edge chipping and grain dislodgement. Moreover, the phase transformation induced volume change of Si and the extrusion of Co under the dynamic pressure of the diamond grits lead to the generation of projections on the machined surface. No obvious oxidation of Co and Si occurred for WC/Co and RB-SiC/Si under high spindle speed grinding (HSSG) with minimum quantity lubrication (MQL). In the fourth part, the wear mechanism of the diamond wheel is studied, {{and its impact on the}} surface generation is analyzed. The wheel wear mechanism involves rapid loss of the sharp edge, grit splintering, flattening, and oxidation. Two appropriate dressing methods are proposed to obtain a sharp edge on the diamond wheel. With the well prepared wheels, two types of functional surfaces are machined by ultra-precision grinding. The results showed that with the proposed grinding protocol, the form accuracy and surface finish could reach 0. 28 μm (PV), 9 nm (Ra) for the Φ 15 mm TiC based hemisphere couples and 0. 64 μm (PV), 6 nm (Ra) for the Φ 20 mm 'Water-drop' surface on binderless tungsten carbide. The originality and significance of the present research is shown in the following three aspects: (i) new grinding induced surface damage mechanism is identified, including the impact of C segregation, preferred phase growth, etc., so the present research contributes to the understanding of the machining induced surface damage mechanism; (ii) the effects of materials microstructure and wheel wear on the surface characteristics of typical engineering carbides in ultra-precision grinding with a sharp edge wheel are analyzed, and comprehensive knowledge of the surface generation in ultra-precision grinding of brittle materials is achieved; (iii) this study provides clear comprehension on the technique to machine functional surfaces by wheel normal grinding, and it promotes the development of the grinding technology of hard and brittle materials.
