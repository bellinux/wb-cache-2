5|$|Against long-circulating speculations {{that his}} family has French roots, genealogists proved the German origin of Rockefeller and traced {{them back to the}} early 17th century.

5|$|Early monasteries {{throughout}} Europe helped preserve Greek and Roman classical civilisation.

The 16th century, however, began to see challenges to the Church, in particular to its religious authority, by figures <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Protestant</b> Reformation, {{as well as in}} the 17th century by secular intellectuals in the Enlightenment. Concurrently, Spanish and Portuguese explorers and missionaries spread the Church's influence through Africa, Asia, and the New World.|$|E

5|$|Gloucester's death destabilised the succession, as {{his mother}} {{was the only person}} {{remaining}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Protestant</b> line to the throne established by the Bill of Rights 1689. Although Anne had ten other pregnancies after the birth of Gloucester, none of them resulted in a child who survived more than briefly after birth. The English parliament did not want the throne to revert to a Catholic, so it passed the Act of Settlement 1701, which settled the throne of England on a cousin of King James, Sophia, Electress of Hanover, and her Protestant heirs. Anne succeeded King William in 1702, and reigned until her death on 1 August 1714. Sophia predeceased her by a few weeks, and so Sophia's son George ascended the throne as the first British monarch of the House of Hanover.|$|E

5|$|In Linz, Kepler's primary {{responsibilities}} (beyond {{completing the}} Rudolphine Tables) were {{teaching at the}} district school and providing astrological and astronomical services. In his first years there, he enjoyed financial security and religious freedom relative to his life in Prague—though he was excluded from Eucharist by his Lutheran church over his theological scruples. It was also during his time in Linz that Kepler {{had to deal with}} the accusation and ultimate verdict of witchcraft against his mother Katharina <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Protestant</b> town of Leonberg. That blow happening only a few years after Keplers excommunication is not seen as a coincidence but as a symptom of the full-fledged assault waged by the Lutherans against Kepler.|$|E
5|$|Though an {{absentee}} landlord, Leicester, who {{was also}} Baron of Denbigh, regarded the lordship {{as an integral part}} of a territorial base for a revived House of Dudley. He set about developing the town of Denbigh with large building projects; the church he planned, though, was never finished, being too ambitious. It would not only have been the largest, but also the first post-Reformation church in England and Wales built according to a plan where the preacher was to take the centre instead of the altar, thus stressing the importance of preaching <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Protestant</b> Church. In vain Leicester tried to have the nearby episcopal see of St. Asaph transferred to Denbigh. He also encouraged and supported the translation of the Bible and the Common Prayer Book into Welsh.|$|E

5|$|Weber {{began his}} {{studies of the}} subject <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Protestant</b> Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, in which {{he argued that the}} {{redefinition}} of the connection between work and piety in Protestantism and especially in ascetic Protestant denominations, particularly Calvinism, shifted human effort towards rational efforts aimed at achieving economic gain. In Protestant religion, Christian piety towards God was expressed through one's secular vocation (secularisation of calling). The rational roots of this doctrine, he argued, soon grew incompatible with and larger than the religious and so the latter were eventually discarded.|$|E
5|$|Weber's {{best known}} work in {{economics}} concerned the preconditions for capitalist development, particularly {{the relations between}} religion and capitalism, which he explored <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Protestant</b> Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism {{as well as in}} his other works on the sociology of religion. He argued that bureaucratic political and economic systems emerging in the Middle Ages were essential in the rise of modern capitalism (including rational book-keeping and organisation of formally free labour), while they were a hindrance in the case of ancient capitalism, which had a different social and political structure based on conquest, slavery, and the coastal city-state. Other contributions include his early work on the economic history of Roman agrarian society (1891) and on the labour relations in Eastern Germany (1892), his analysis of the history of commercial partnerships in the Middle Ages (1889), his critique of Marxism, the discussion of the roles of idealism and materialism in the history of capitalism in his Economy and Society (1922) and his General Economic History (1923), a notable example of the kind of empirical work associated with the German Historical School.|$|E
5|$|Weber's essay The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism is {{his most}} famous work. It is argued that this work should {{not be viewed as}} a {{detailed}} study of Protestantism, but rather as an introduction into Weber's later works, especially his studies of interaction between various religious ideas and economic behaviour as part of the rationalisation of the economic system. <b>In</b> <b>The</b> <b>Protestant</b> Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, Weber put forward the thesis that Calvinist ethic and ideas influenced the development of capitalism. He noted the post-Reformation shift of Europe's economic centre away from Catholic countries such as France, Spain and Italy, and toward Protestant countries such as the Netherlands, England, Scotland and Germany. Weber also noted that societies having more Protestants were those with a more highly developed capitalist economy. Similarly, in societies with different religions, most successful business leaders were Protestant. Weber thus argued that Roman Catholicism impeded the development of the capitalist economy in the West, as did other religions such as Confucianism and Buddhism elsewhere in the world.|$|E

5|$|Several anti-cult {{groups also}} {{considered}} the church a cult. The local {{branch of the}} Centre contre les manipulations mentales (CCMM, or Centre Roger Ikor) directed an intense campaign against the group with repeated warnings in the media, and the President of the Union nationale des associations de défense des familles et de l'individu (UNADFI), Catherine Picard, said on television that she considered the church a cult. Criticism against the Church includes methods of recruitment (considered aggressive proselytism) in psychiatric hospitals, schools, buses and similar environments directed to suffering people, a fundamentalist interpretation of the Bible, pressure on prospective members to quickly join the group, family breakdowns, identical language and clothing of followers reflecting a loss of individuality, education of children that is considered indoctrination, many banned activities (among them music, television, makeup and trousers for women who must also have long hair covered with a scarf), an hysterical environment at worship, desocialization of the faithful, excessive appeals for money, unverifiable and dubious healings that may be detrimental to members' health and the strong influence on members and lack of qualifications of Kennel. A delegate from the CCMM said that criticism was based on facts collected from former members and their families, some {{of which had been}} used in court (as in Vesoul). In response to writer <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Protestant</b> journal Réforme Benoît Hervieu-Léger, who contended that a sole case in Besançon would have been sufficient to criticize the whole federation, the delegate also stated that complaints did not come exclusively from the church of Besançon. The association also noted many similarities with another Pentecostal church it considered a cult, the Mission of Full Gospel - Christian Open Door. As of 2010, MIVILUDES continued to monitor the Church of Besançon because of its hold over the faithful.|$|E
