500|$|California Chrome {{shipped to}} New York on May 20 in a {{semi-trailer}} horse van together with Ride On Curlin. They had a police escort through New York City from the Throgs Neck Bridge to Belmont Park. The [...] press reported that Art Sherman believed the misspelled saddle cloths at the Derby and Preakness {{were a good}} luck charm, and that he specifically asked Belmont Park for another misspelled cloth along with a properly spelled version. The first week California Chrome spent at the Belmont track was generally uneventful, other than galloping past an opossum that wandered onto the track the morning of May 23. The horse {{paid little attention to}} it, but the press pounced on the story; the animal was labeled [...] "Dumb-Ass Possum", and someone created a Twitter account for the creature. Delgado commented, [...] "I can tell you he loves this track, and I don't see him (having) any problem getting a mile and a half." [...] On May 31, Espinoza arrived to give the colt a short workout known as a [...] "breeze". Horse and jockey were greeted by a large contingent of fans and press at about 6:30a.m., and ran a [...] "sharp" [...] half-mile (...) officially clocked at 47.69 seconds. A clocker for the Daily Racing Form stated, [...] "He's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>tough</b> to beat. I think we're going to have a Triple Crown winner." ...|$|E
2500|$|Andrew Flintoff, England's captain, {{called the}} series [...] "the reason we play ... {{we are going}} over there to play {{in what could be}} the biggest series ever so there is an excited group of lads... it is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>tough.</b> We know that 2005 was {{something}} special and whether that can be recreated I am not quite sure... in England each Test match got bigger and bigger and we got a real feeling of what the Ashes was about." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite the {{addition}} of Howard and Nash, Bryant insisted he remained {{the leader of the}} Lakers. Nash agreed that it was Bryant's team, but added the team needed to provide support. Bryant looked forward to Nash running the team's offense. Bryant envisioned that after he retired, Howard would assume the role of team leader. Howard anticipated Bryant being tough on him. [...] "So, I'll take all the heat that he's going to give me because I know {{at the end of the}} day that's going to make me a better player and a better person and it's going to make this team better", Howard said. In 2014, Nash said that [...] "everyone could see [...] was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>tough</b> from the start." ...|$|E
5000|$|Kris Faafoi was [...] "happy {{with the}} result; we won ... at the {{beginning}} we always said it <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a <b>tough</b> race." ...|$|R

2500|$|Seahawks {{head coach}} Mike Holmgren fueled the debate upon {{returning}} to Seattle, saying during a Seahawks rally, [...] "We {{knew it was}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>tough</b> going up against the Pittsburgh Steelers. I didn't know {{we were going to}} have to play the guys in the striped shirts as well." [...] Al Michaels commented during a Sunday Night Football game a few months later, [...] "The fact that Holmgren was not fined for that statement speaks volumes to me." [...] Michaels explained he was alluding to Holmgren's need to [...] "blow off steam", but also suggested a perceived admission by the NFL that something went wrong in that game. Both Michaels and John Madden noted Seattle's mistakes, such as poor clock management at the end of each half.|$|E
2500|$|Kevin Harvick shot {{ahead of}} Jeff Gordon {{on the final}} restart with two laps {{remaining}} to win the Bank of America 500 at Charlotte Motor Speedway. “Oh, we came here and tested thinking {{that this was going}} to be the hardest round to get through because of Talladega,” Harvick said. “There’s so much that you can’t control there. We wanted to try to control the things that we could control. We felt like Kansas and here (Charlotte) were playing to our strengths; and just see where it fell after that once we get to the next round. So I’m really proud of everybody at SHR. I’m really proud of all my guys on this team. I just can’t thank everybody enough.” [...] "I'm really proud of that finish, really proud of that effort," [...] Gordon said. [...] " ... Kevin was tough. I knew he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>tough</b> once he got out there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>tough</b> lines {{before we}} get to Farley's," [...] he said to himself; [...] "but I ought to hold out {{if for no other reason}} than to clear Sam beyond a doubt." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I reckon Sam {{is having}} his hands full," [...] he thought. [...] "I must get Tom {{to the shore}} alone. But it <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a <b>tough</b> job, I can see that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Whichever way you put it, it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> mighty <b>tough</b> on us, for unless those fellows {{get tired}} of pulling that heavy boat 'twixt now and sunrise, we <b>are</b> like <b>to</b> <b>be</b> held here until to-morrow night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] Prescott {{answered}} gravely; [...] "I have {{to clear}} myself. If {{there were no}} other reason than the one you have given, it would have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done. It's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a <b>tough</b> proposition, but I'll get about it very soon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, me and Huck went {{on hunting}} for the corpse after the others quit, {{and we found}} it. And was proud, too; but Uncle Silas he knocked us crazy by telling us HE killed the man. So we was mighty sorry we found the body, and was bound to save Uncle Silas's neck if we could; and it was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>tough</b> work, too, because he wouldn't let us break him out of prison the way we done with our old nigger Jim.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>tough</b> work, Jules, I {{can tell}} you," [...] {{one of them}} said to Julian, whose English birth was now almost forgotten, and who, by the good temper he always manifested, however long the marches and however great the fatigues, had become a general favourite. [...] "I guess we are only going to fight because the Russians are tired of retreating, just as we are tired of {{pursuing}} them. They can gain nothing by fighting here. We outnumber them tremendously. The great bulk of their army lies on the heights {{on the other side of}} the river, and there is nothing to prevent their retreating to some strong position, where they might give battle with advantage. On the other hand, there is no reason why we should fight here. We have come down thirty or forty miles out of the direct road to Moscow, and if, instead of doing so, we had crossed the river, and had gone straight on, the Russians must have evacuated the town and pushed on with all speed in order to get between us and Moscow. But this marching about without getting a battle discourages men more even than defeat, and I hope that it will do something to restore discipline among the Germans and Austrians, ay, and among our own troops too. I have been through a number of campaigns, and I have never seen such disorder, such plunder, such want of discipline as has been shown since we entered Russia. I tell you, Jules, even a defeat would do us good. Look at the Russians; they never leave a straggler behind them, never a dismounted gun, while the roads behind us are choked up with our abandoned guns and waggons, and the whole country is covered with our marauders. I should be glad if one of the brigades was ordered to break up into companies and to march back, spreading out across the whole country we have traversed, and shooting every man they met between this and the frontier, whether he was French, German, Austrian, or Pole." ...|$|E
50|$|Coventry Blaze {{were always}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>tough,</b> too, so Marple set about signing some big name players himself.|$|E
5000|$|Acknowledging {{just how}} hard that task will be, he said: [...] "We’ve {{made a good}} start to the qualifiers and I’m hoping we can keep it <b>going.</b> It’s <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> very <b>tough,</b> though. In {{football}} you have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> realistic and know your place." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There <b>is</b> evidently <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> another <b>tough</b> fight {{before they}} {{get down to the}} water," [...] the {{sergeant}} said. [...] "It is very hard our being cut off here. Not that I should be good for any fighting if I were with them." ...|$|R
50|$|After {{the success}} of the {{previous}} season, 2007 <b>was</b> always <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a <b>tough</b> year. Coach Rob Powell moved on to Super League's Harlequins RL, and was replaced by Andy Gilvary and Dave Wilson. Meanwhile, ten of the Grand Final winning team moved on to pastures new.|$|R
5000|$|... “We {{were really}} superb {{in the long}} run, {{but we had to}} work for it pretty hard in the short run,” Kenseth said. “I was {{disappointed}} to see the last caution. I knew it was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>tough,</b> but {{we were able to get}} the jump and get out front.” ...|$|E
5000|$|... "We {{certainly}} weren't deprived, no. It {{was always}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>tough</b> and sleep deprived, but if you're determined and thick-skinned {{and work hard}} {{you are going to}} come across tired. You're on your feet the whole time, thinking about what you're going to do next. It's hard, it's not a walk in the a park." ...|$|E
5000|$|Digital Spy's Lewis Corner gave Faith's {{version of}} the song {{four out of five}} stars. He stated [...] "It's a brave task to reinterpret a much-loved hit, but Faith's soulful tones {{immediately}} thwart any doubts that she can't do the song justice." [...] He added that while it was always <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>tough</b> topping the original, Faith comes [...] "admirably close." ...|$|E
5000|$|Walker made {{an attempt}} at the 500 cc World Championship in 2001. He {{predicted}} that [...] "For me it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the <b>toughest</b> year ever", which proved accurate, as the factory Shell-sponsored Honda <b>was</b> hard <b>to</b> ride and forced Walker to override, resulting in many huge crashes. In , {{he moved to the}} Superbike World Championship, initially with the Fuchs Kawasaki team.|$|R
50|$|Mayweather {{defeated}} Álvarez by majority twelve-round decision. In a {{fight that}} many thought <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Floyd Mayweather's <b>toughest,</b> he outclassed the younger Álvarez. Many observers at ringside thought Mayweather won all twelve rounds.|$|R
60|$|MAKING them pens <b>was</b> a distressid <b>tough</b> job, {{and so was}} the saw; and Jim {{allowed the}} {{inscription}} <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the <b>toughest</b> of all. That's the one which the prisoner has to scrabble on the wall. But he had to have it; Tom said he'd GOT to; there warn't no case of a state prisoner not scrabbling his inscription to leave behind, and his coat of arms.|$|R

The raging bull chases Daffy onto an airport, but Daffy manages to safely board the jet plane, only {{to realize that the}} plane is taking him to South America. It's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>tough</b> finding the duck {{squadron}} from here on out.|$|E
5000|$|... 2015 {{was another}} tough {{year for the}} Chiefs rugby team. They won 10 of their Super Rugby games and {{finished}} 5th overall {{on the table for}} the 2nd year in a row, and 3rd behind the Hurricanes and Highlanders in the New Zealand Conference.

500|$|Columbus Crew goalkeeper Andy Gruenbaum commented {{after the}} match, [...] "We knew it <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a <b>tough</b> place <b>to</b> play, their fan base is great. Anytime {{you have a}} {{championship}} match on your own pitch, the odds <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> against you. We {{knew we had to}} defend and take advantage of any opportunity. We came out and scored the first goal and they <b>were</b> able <b>to</b> capitalize on two weird bounces." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{play was}} {{featured}} on SportsCenter that evening as ESPN's top {{play of the}} day in the world of sports. Murray commented on the loss to Auburn stating, [...] "It's like a nightmare. This <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a <b>tough</b> one <b>to</b> get over." [...] One week later, as Georgia hosted Kentucky with 2:17 left in the 1st half, Murray suffered a torn ACL, ending his college career.|$|R
50|$|It {{was known}} going in that Coach Jennings' first year <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a <b>tough</b> season, {{but that did}} not soften the sting of a 1-9 final record, the most losses in a single season and the worst overall season record in program history. The only other prior year that the Cornhusker {{football}} squad had only pulled down a single win was 1899's 1-7-1 campaign. Nebraska's overall program record tumbled to 352-198-34 (.009), the seventh straight year to see a drop in winning percentage, as the Big 7 history also slipped, to 147-63-12 (.689).|$|R

500|$|WALL-E won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature and was {{nominated}} for Best Original Screenplay, Best Original Score, Best Original Song, Sound Editing, and Sound Mixing at the 81st Academy Awards, which it lost to Slumdog Millionaire (Original Score, Original Song, Sound Mixing), The Dark Knight (Sound Editing), and Milk (Original Screenplay). Walt Disney Pictures also pushed for an Academy Award for Best Picture nomination, {{but it was not}} nominated, provoking controversy as to whether the Academy deliberately restricted WALL-E to the Best Animated Feature category. Peter Travers commented that [...] "If there was ever a time where an animated feature deserved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> nominated for best picture it's Wall-E." [...] Only three animated films, 1991's Beauty and the Beast and Pixar's next two films, 2009's Up and 2010's Toy Story 3, have ever been nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. A reflective Stanton stated he was not disappointed the film <b>was</b> restricted <b>to</b> the Best Animated Film nomination because he was overwhelmed by the film's positive reception, and eventually [...] "The line [...] is just getting so blurry that I think with each proceeding year, it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>tougher</b> and <b>tougher</b> <b>to</b> say what's an animated movie and what's not an animated movie." ...|$|R
5000|$|Janssen {{has become}} an {{excellent}} control pitcher, walking only 1.6 batters per 9 innings in 2012. He has emphasized a low walk rate in becoming a successful pitcher: [...] "I pride myself, as much as I can, in not walking hitters. ... I can live with giving up hits—they're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> happen—but walks <b>are</b> <b>tougher</b> <b>to</b> swallow." ...|$|R
500|$|Writing for Rolling Stone in 2000, Anthony DeCurtis {{praised the}} song for its musical {{demonstration}} of [...] "the sweet satisfactions of faith". On a triple album where [...] "nearly every song is excellent", AllMusic picks [...] "All Things Must Pass" [...] {{as one of}} five standout tracks (or AMG track picks), with Richie Unterberger writing of its autumnal theme: [...] "It's the kind of song that fits the mood in November, when the trees are getting stripped bare of their leaves, the days are getting shorter and colder, {{and you have to}} resign yourself <b>to</b> knowing it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>tougher</b> and tougher in those regards for months, also knowing that those hardships will pass away come springtime." [...] In his book on Harrison, subtitled A Spiritual Biography, Gary Tillery refers to the song as [...] "magisterial" [...] and a [...] "majestic title track" [...] that [...] "leaves even the shallowest listener contemplative". Michael Gallucci of Ultimate Classic Rock places [...] "All Things Must Pass" [...] third on his list of Harrison's best solo songs (behind the two hit singles from All Things Must Pass, [...] "My Sweet Lord" [...] and [...] "What Is Life"), and comments: [...] "The album's title track takes on more poignancy after Harrison's death , but it's always been great." [...] Writing for Rough Guides, Chris Ingham similarly describes the song as [...] "a heart-rending piece of significant prescience which seems to take on more poignancy with every passing year".|$|R
