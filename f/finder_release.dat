The exocraft can be built on the player's set home planet, and called upon on any other planet via a minor update released a few days afterwards. The update also contained a permadeath option that wipes the player's progress completely on death; support for Steam Workshop for user modifications on the Windows version; new base building features and materials, ship and multitool classes and support for PlayStation 4 Pro enhanced graphics.|$|R
50|$|Chibi-Robo! was {{generally}} well received by critics, with praise directed towards the premise, charming storyline, and sound design. However, some gameplay mechanics {{and the quality}} of the graphics drew some criticism. Sales of Chibi-Robo! were modest, but it did spawn several sequels. For the Nintendo DS, Chibi-Robo!: Park Patrol was released in 2007 and Okaeri! Chibi-Robo! Happy Richie Ōsōji! was released in 2009, the latter being a Japan-exclusive. For the Nintendo 3DS, Chibi-Robo! Photo <b>Finder</b> was <b>released</b> in Japan in 2013 and in North America in 2014, and Chibi-Robo! Zip Lash was released in 2015. The original Chibi-Robo! also saw a Japanese re-release in 2009 for the Wii as part of the New Play Control! series.|$|R
25|$|King {{announced}} in June 2014 that Mr. Mercedes {{is part of}} a trilogy; the second book, <b>Finders</b> Keepers, was <b>released</b> on June 2, 2015. On April 22, 2015, it was revealed that King is currently working on the third book of the trilogy which name was later revealed to be End of Watch. The book was released on June 7, 2016, and hit the top of the New York Times bestseller list.|$|R
50|$|Chibi-Robo! {{received}} a sequel in 2007 for the Nintendo DS called Chibi-Robo!: Park Patrol, which follows a different Chibi-Robo as {{it attempts to}} revitalize a park. Nintendo established a deal with Wal-Mart for the exclusive rights to sell it in the United States. A second sequel for the DS, titled Okaeri! Chibi-Robo! Happy Richie Ōsōji!, saw a Japanese release in 2009. It involves yet another Chibi-Robo vacuuming dirt for money within the home of an adult Jenny. The original Chibi-Robo! was re-released as part of New Play Control!, a selection of Wii remakes of GameCube games. The remake features special Wii Remote controls for the game's tools. Aiming the remote allows the player to change perspective, while pointing it at interactive objects with will be identified with a sound. The remake was released in Japan on June 11, 2009, but Nintendo of America did not permit an English release. A fourth game in the series, Chibi-Robo! Photo <b>Finder,</b> was <b>released</b> in 2013 for the Nintendo 3DS. The fifth game in the series, titled Chibi-Robo! Zip Lash was announced on May 31, 2015 and released in October 2015 for the Nintendo 3DS.|$|R
40|$|AbstractConstraint-based schedulers {{have been}} widely {{successful}} in tackling complex, disjunctive, and cumulative scheduling applications by combining tree search and constraint propagation. The constraint-propagation step is a fixpoint algorithm that applies pruning operators to tighten the release and due dates of activities using precedence or resource constraints. A variety of pruning operators for resource constraints have been proposed; {{they are based on}} edge finding or energetic reasoning and handle a single resource. Complexity results in this area are only available for a single application of these pruning operators, which is problematic for at least two reasons. On the one hand, the operators are not idempotent, so a single application is rarely sufficient. On the other hand, the operators are not used in isolation but interact with each other. Existing results thus provide a very partial picture of the complexity of propagating resource constraints in constraint-based scheduling. This paper aims at addressing these limitations. It studies the complexity of applying pruning operators for resource constraints to a fixpoint. In particular, it shows that: (1) the fixpoint of the edge <b>finder</b> for both <b>release</b> and due dates can be reached in strongly polynomial time for disjunctive scheduling; (2) the fixpoint can be reached in strongly polynomial time for updating the release dates or the due dates but not both for the cumulative scheduling; and (3) the fixpoint of “reasonable” energetic operators cannot be reached in strongly polynomial time, even for disjunctive scheduling and even when only the release dates or the due dates are considered...|$|R
