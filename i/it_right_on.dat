500|$|Due to lack {{of funds}} at the time (the building's initial budget doubled, ending up at $325,000 ($ in modern dollars) {{including}} furnishings), Richardson devoted most of his efforts to the building's exterior. A report from the Times Union states, [...] "There wasn't enough money for Richardson {{to do the job}} as thoroughly as he would have liked. He said in his writing that if there wasn't sufficient money, he'd rather do <b>it</b> <b>right</b> <b>on</b> the outside and leave it to a future generation to finish the interior. The interior was finished by city architects a good 30 years after Richardson built it." [...] The interior was redesigned by Ogden and Gander in 1917. The mayor's office is {{on the first floor of}} the tower, the Council chamber and offices are on the building's second floor, and the city clerk's office is on the second floor of the tower. The mayor's office contains a painting of the city's first mayor, Pieter Schuyler.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{response}} to [...] "Stronger" [...] was generally positive. Andy Strickland of Yahoo! Music {{described it as}} having [...] "splashes of pure Massive Attack". Stuart McCaighy of This Is Fake DIY wrote that it [...] "sounds ace", while Birmingham Post writer Andrew Cowen described the track as [...] "defiant". Dean Piper from Daily Mirror considered it the Sugababes' best release and applauded the group's vocals on the song. Hot Press writer Phil Udell characterised [...] "Stronger" [...] as [...] "an elegant ballad way beyond their tender years". Akin Ojumu of The Guardian was complimentary about the track's R elements, writing: [...] "When they get <b>it</b> <b>right</b> <b>on</b> tracks such as 'Stronger' and 'Supernatural' the Sugababes are cool". Fiona Shepherd of The Scotsman praised the song's composition, calling it [...] "tastefully restrained". However, Barry Nicholson from NME named it the weaker track on the double A-side and stated that it [...] "leers at you for a bit, then staggers off to puke up that last Bacardi Breezer". [...] Marianne Gunn from The Herald called the track's strings [...] "inferior" [...] and wrote that it contains [...] "the same cheesy sentiment" [...] as American singer Britney Spears' song of the same name.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{begins with}} the family, except for Marge, {{watching}} a parody of the show Dinosaurs on television. The staff thought Dinosaurs was a knock-off of The Simpsons, so at one point Bart exclaims [...] "It's like they saw our lives and put <b>it</b> <b>right</b> <b>on</b> screen," [...] and points at the television screen. Before she reveals to the Simpson family that Selma's new boyfriend is Bob, Patty says there is something [...] "disturbing" [...] about him, which results in Lisa imagining him as being The Elephant Man. As Bob remembers his time in prison, a scene with him picking up road side trash is seen, referencing the film Cool Hand Luke. The music in the scene is {{a reference to the}} soundtrack of the film as well. Bob also remembers winning a Daytime Emmy Award in the [...] "Best Supporting Performer in a Children's Program" [...] category. In Selma's letters to Sideshow Bob, she refers to him by his prison number, 24601, which is Jean Valjean's prisoner number in the novel Les Misérables. The reunion between Krusty and Bob at the telethon is a reference to a surprise reunion between former comedy partners Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin on a 1970s telethon. The telethon logo features an Al Hirschfeld-style caricature of Krusty.|$|E

2500|$|The {{show was}} almost universally {{critically}} panned. [...] Matt Roush {{wrote in his}} USA Today review that Curry [...] "gives it his maul", and that the show's leads seemed [...] "lost in the TV equivalent of summer stock". Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly went one step further, likening it to a variation of The Odd Couple that possessed [...] "neither romantic spark nor crisp verbal byplay". [...] The Los Angeles Daily News claimed {{it was the worst}} new show of the season, and that if you tuned in to the show at 8:30, you would [...] "probably be watching something else by 8:38". TeeVee's Peter Ko wrote a lengthy review (which itself got some publicity nine years later) in which he heavily bashed Curry, then he went on to state, [...] "I have stood in a freezer full of dead people at the morgue. I have seen a man's scalp pulled back over his nose. I've even seen 35 minutes of Ellen DeGeneres's Mr. Wrong. But I can now honestly say that until Steve Carell's turn in the premiere of Over the Top, I have never known true horror." [...] The Washington Posts Tom Shales, on the other hand, was substantially kinder than most critics, saying [...] "the show seemed merely okay at first encounter," [...] but after seeing the season's other new shows, [...] "Over the Top is looking better and better. [...] I could almost kiss <b>it</b> <b>right</b> <b>on</b> the lips." ...|$|E
