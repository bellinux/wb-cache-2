Howe suffered from severe asthma attacks throughout the convention, but remained in telephone contact with Rooseveltwho was not present, per the custom of the dayand continued to meet with delegates who were brought to visit him. Roosevelt was nominated by the convention after agreeing to make another rival, John Nance Garner, his vice presidential candidate, and after some of Smith's Tammany Hall supporters, led by William Gibbs McAdoo, began to defect.|$|E
5|$|In 1886, a bill {{to reduce}} the tariff was {{narrowly}} defeated in the House. The tariff issue was emphasized in the Congressional elections that year, and the forces of protectionism increased their numbers in the Congress, but Cleveland continued to advocate tariff reform. As the surplus grew, Cleveland and the reformers called for a tariff for revenue only. His message to Congress in 1887 (quoted at right) highlighted the injustice of taking more money from the people than the government needed to pay its operating expenses. Republicans, as well as protectionist northern <b>Democrats</b> <b>like</b> Samuel J. Randall, believed that American industries would fail without high tariffs, and they continued to fight reform efforts. Roger Q. Mills, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, proposed {{a bill to}} reduce the tariff from about 47% to about 40%. After significant exertions by Cleveland and his allies, the bill passed the House. The Republican Senate failed to come to agreement with the Democratic House, and the bill died in the conference committee. Dispute over the tariff persisted into the 1888 presidential election.|$|E
25|$|Progress Party leader Siv Jensen {{stated that}} her party {{would not support}} a {{coalition}} government in which it did not participate, thus apparently ruling out a minority coalition of the Conservatives, the Liberals and the Christian <b>Democrats,</b> <b>like</b> the government of Kjell Magne Bondevik which was in office from 2001 to 2005. She also stated that the Progress Party would have been prepared to form a minority government alone if the party won more seats in parliament than the other three non-socialist parties.|$|E
50|$|Again, {{like the}} State Senate election, California law {{required}} a run-off election between the top finishers of each political party. Therefore, because Russo was a <b>Democrat</b> <b>like</b> Harris, he was eliminated.|$|R

25|$|According to the New York Times {{the party}} {{as a whole has}} shifted to the left. Although {{the country as a whole}} has shifted to the left, they aren't {{increasing}} their liberalness at the same rate as Democrats. <b>Democrats</b> <b>like</b> Bill Clinton were considered to be centrists but Obama has run to the left of Clinton on the budget, social issues, welfare reform, entitlement reform, and Israel relations. Obama has focused on income inequality while President Clinton stressed opportunity and mobility. Bill Clinton lowered capital gains taxes while the current president supports raising it.|$|E
25|$|The Goldwater conservatives fought this {{establishment}} from 1960, defeated it in 1964 {{and eventually}} retired {{most of its}} members, although some became <b>Democrats</b> <b>like</b> Senator Charles Goodell and Mayor John Lindsay in New York. President Richard Nixon adopted many of their positions, especially regarding health care, welfare spending, environmentalism {{and support for the}} arts and humanities. After Congressman John B. Anderson of Illinois bolted the party in 1980 and ran as an independent against Reagan, the liberal GOP element faded away. Their old strongholds in the Northeast are now mostly held by Democrats.|$|E
25|$|Ilia's main {{political}} and social goals were based on Georgian patriotism. He radically advocated {{the revival of the}} use of the Georgian language, the cultivation of Georgian literature, the revival of autocephalous status for the Georgian national church, and, finally, the revival of Georgian statehood, which had ended when the country became part of the Russian Empire. As the number of supporters for his ideas grew, so did opposition among the leading Social <b>Democrats</b> <b>like</b> the Menshevik Noe Zhordania; their main aims were focused on battling the Tsarist autocracy and a democratic transformation of the Russian empire. This did not include the revival of a Georgian state or of a Georgian self-identity. Ilia was viewed as bourgeois and as an old aristocrat who failed to realize the importance of the revolutionary tide.|$|E

50|$|After a coup overthrew Queen Lili'uokalani of Hawai'i {{in early}} 1893, the new {{government}} sought annexation to join the United States. President Benjamin Harrison was supportive and sent a treaty to the Senate. His successor, President Grover Cleveland, a <b>Democrat</b> <b>like</b> Blount, opposed annexation and sent Blount, now a private citizen, to investigate. The report he issued on July 17, 1893 {{is known as the}} Blount Report.|$|R
50|$|He was {{a member}} of the South Carolina state House of Representatives in 1844. Brooks was elected to the 33rd United States Congress in 1853 as a <b>Democrat.</b> <b>Like</b> his fellow South Carolina Representatives and Senators, Brooks took an extreme pro-slavery position, asserting that the {{enslavement}} of black people by whites was right and proper, that any attack or restriction on slavery was an attack on the rights and the social structure of the South.|$|R
25|$|After {{the peace}} {{negotiations}} Poland did not maintain all the territories it had controlled {{at the end}} of hostilities. Due to their losses in and after the Battle of Warsaw, the Soviets offered the Polish peace delegation substantial territorial concessions in the contested borderland areas, closely resembling the border between the Russian Empire and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth before the first partition of 1772. Polish resources were exhausted, however, and Polish public opinion was opposed to a prolongation of the war. The Polish government was also pressured by the League of Nations, and the negotiations were controlled by Dmowski's National Democrats. Piłsudski might have controlled the military, but parliament (Sejm) was controlled by Dmowski: Piłsudski's support lay in the territories in the East, which were controlled by the Bolsheviks {{at the time of the}} elections, while the National Democrats' electoral support lay in central and western Poland. The peace negotiations were of a political nature. National <b>Democrats,</b> <b>like</b> Stanisław Grabski, who earlier had resigned his post to protest the Polish–Ukrainian alliance and now wielded much influence over the Polish negotiators, cared little for Piłsudski's vision of reviving Międzymorze, the multicultural Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. This post-war situation proved a death blow to the Międzymorze project. More than one million Poles, living mostly in the disputed territories, remained in the Soviet Union, systematically persecuted by Soviet authorities because of political, economic and religious reasons (see the Polish operation of the NKVD).|$|E
25|$|Environmentalism is {{prominent}} {{throughout the}} region, especially {{west of the}} Cascades. Environmentally conscious services such as recycling and public transportation are widespread, most notably in the more populous areas. A 2007 statistical analysis ranked the 50 Greenest Cities in the United States, placing Portland, Oregon first, Eugene, Oregon fifth, and Seattle, Washington eighth. The region {{as a whole is}} also known for its bicycle culture as an alternative form of transportation; Portland is considered by Forbes Traveler to be the second most bicycle-friendly city in the world. Portland is also the hub of American bicycle manufacturing; as a whole it generated over $68 million in revenue in 2007 alone. Seattle, Washington has also garnered a reputation for its contributions to public transportation with the Puget Sound Transit system, including an underground light rail system and a 38.9% worker commute rate as of 2011. Politically, the Pacific Northwest is actively involved in environmental efforts. The international organization Greenpeace was born in Vancouver in 1970 as part of a large public opposition movement in British Columbia to US nuclear weapons testing on Amchitka Island in the Aleutians. Liberal and Conservative Northwesterners, such as former U.S. Senator Slade Gorton (R-WA) and moderate <b>Democrats</b> <b>like</b> former Speaker of the House Tom Foley (D-WA), have been prominent in the development of conservative approaches to environmental protection. Seattle in particular is also home to a large number of publications and institutions concerned with the environment and sustainability, including both Worldchanging and Grist.org, the U.S.'s two largest online green magazines. The Pacific Northwest is also noted for a large number of gardening clubs, with Victoria having an annual flower count in February.|$|E
500|$|In the 1893 elections, Republicans recaptured {{control of}} the New Jersey Legislature. This was {{due in part to}} another {{economic}} depression, the Panic of 1893, which had occurred with Democrat Grover Cleveland in the White House, and in part because some <b>Democrats,</b> <b>like</b> Republicans before them, had proven corrupt. [...] The increasing commuter population also played a role; Bergen County contained (and still does) many commuter communities because of its proximity to New York City. These new residents were strongly Republican, as contrasted with the Democratic farmers. According to local historian Kevin Wright, [...] "Having gained sufficient numbers by 1893 to challenge Punkin Dusters at the polls, the Commuters of Bergen County led a political revolution in Home Rule that finally toppled the ancien régime." [...] Legal disputes about {{control of the}} New Jersey Senate and the Republican desire to undo many Democratic policies occupied the legislature {{in the early part of}} its 1894 session. Nevertheless, interest groups such as local landowners pushed the legislature for permissive policies on municipal incorporation, hoping to gain power in the new governments.|$|E

Broussard and Raymond Lewis, shared the remaining but critical 28.5 percent of the vote. Barras then defeated Romero, 6,690 (62 percent) to 4,091 (38 percent) ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{most common}} mascot {{symbol for the}} party has been the donkey, or jackass. Andrew Jackson's enemies twisted his name to [...] "jackass" [...] as a term of ridicule {{regarding}} a stupid and stubborn animal. However, the <b>Democrats</b> <b>liked</b> the common-man implications {{and picked it up}} too, so the image persisted and evolved. Its most lasting impression came from the cartoons of Thomas Nast from 1870 in Harper's Weekly. Cartoonists followed Nast and used the donkey to represent the Democrats, and the elephant to represent the Republicans.|$|R
2500|$|... 1825 saw the {{establishment}} of the New South Wales Legislative Council, Australia's oldest legislative body, as an appointed body to advise the Governor. In the same year trial by jury was introduced, ending the military's judicial power. In 1842 the Council was made partly elective, through the agitation of <b>democrats</b> <b>like</b> William Wentworth. This development was made possible by the abolition of transportation of convicts to New South Wales in 1840, by which time 150,000 convicts had been sent to Australia. After 1840 the settlers saw themselves as a free people and demanded the same rights they would have had in Britain.|$|E
2500|$|Nelson {{was one of}} {{only two}} Democratic {{senators}} to vote against the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002. He voted with Republicans on matters of bankruptcy reform, environmental protection, lawsuit reform, and trade. In 2004 he {{was one of only}} three Democratic senators to vote to invoke cloture on the proposed Federal Marriage Amendment; in 2006 he was one of only two Democratic Senators to vote that way. He was the only Democratic senator to vote against a 2006 bill that would have extended federal funding for Stem Cell Research. He has, however, voted consistently against drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. He has also opposed President Bush's plan to send an additional 21,500 troops to Iraq. Early in Bush's first term he voted with the majority of his party against scrapping President Bill Clinton's expansive new rules on ergonomics regulation for workers; many of his fellow conservative <b>Democrats</b> <b>like</b> John Breaux, Max Baucus, Blanche Lincoln, and Zell Miller voted with Republicans on the issue. [...] On April 26, 2010, Nelson was one of two Democratic senators in attendance to vote against the motion to move a financial regulations bill forward, siding with Senate Republicans. [...] The other was Harry Reid, who voted against his own proposed bill out of procedure.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a heated}} Senate floor speech in July 2015, Cruz accused Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of telling [...] "a {{flat-out}} lie" [...] over his intentions to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank of the United States, which Cruz opposes. [...] "What {{we just saw}} today was an absolute demonstration that not only what he told every Republican senator, but what he told the press {{over and over and}} over again was a simple lie", Cruz said of Senate Republican Leader McConnell. Cruz's [...] "incendiary outburst" [...] was [...] "unusual in the cordial atmosphere of the Senate", according to Reuters. In the same speech, Cruz assailed the [...] "Republican majority in both houses of Congresses" [...] for what Cruz termed an insufficiently conservative record. Cruz's speech, and especially his accusation against McConnell, was condemned by various senior Republican senators, with John McCain saying that the speech was [...] "outside the realm of Senate behavior" [...] and [...] "a very wrong thing to do". Orrin Hatch expressed a similar opinion: [...] "I don't condone the use of that kind of language against another senator unless they can show definitive proof that there was a lie ... And I know the leader didn't lie." [...] Cruz had alleged that McConnell scheduled a vote on the Ex-Im Bank as part of a deal to persuade <b>Democrats</b> <b>like</b> Maria Cantwell to stop blocking a trade bill, whereas McConnell denied there was any [...] "deal", and that denial is what Cruz termed a [...] "lie"; Hatch says McConnell did pledge to help Cantwell get a vote on the Ex-Im Bank.|$|E

2500|$|While [...] Catholic Republican leaders {{try to stay}} in {{line with}} the teachings of the Catholic Church on {{subjects}} such as abortion, euthanasia, embryonic stem cell research and same-sex marriage, they differ on the death penalty and contraception. [...] Pope Francis' 2015 encyclical Laudato si' sparked a discussion on the positions of Catholic Republicans in relation to the positions of the church. The pope's encyclical on behalf of the Catholic Church officially acknowledges a man-made climate change caused by burning fossil fuels. The Pope says the warming of the planet is rooted in a throwaway culture and the developed world's indifference to the destruction of the planet in pursuit of short-term economic gains. According to The New York Times, Laudato si put pressure on the Catholic candidates in the 2016 election: Jeb Bush, Bobby Jindal, Marco Rubio, and Rick Santorum. [...] With leading Democrats praising the encyclical, James Bretzke, a professor of moral theology at Boston College, has said that both sides were being disingenuous: [...] "I think it shows that both the Republicans and the <b>Democrats...</b> <b>like</b> to use religious authority and, in this case, the Pope to support positions they have arrived at independently... There is a certain insincerity, a hypocrisy I think, on both sides." [...] While a Pew Research poll indicates Catholics are more likely to believe the Earth is warming than non-Catholics, 51% of Catholic Republicans believe in global warming (less than the general population), and only 24% of Catholic Republicans believe global warming is caused by human activity.|$|E
