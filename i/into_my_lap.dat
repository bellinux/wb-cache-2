6000|$|... 'Right,' he answered, {{throwing}} them <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>lap.</b> 'Three of them, {{and not a}} woman's hand among them. Sink me, if I can understand what you have been doing all your life.|$|E
60|$|I {{understood}} the game well enough, though I pretended I did not, and played cautiously. It {{was to keep}} a good stock in <b>my</b> <b>lap,</b> out of which I {{every now and then}} conveyed some <b>into</b> <b>my</b> pocket, but in such a manner, and at such convenient times, as I was sure he could not see it.|$|R

60|$|Her voice trembled for {{the first}} time. Her restless fingers stole their way <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>lap,</b> and held fast by one of my hands. There was another moment of silence, and then Sir Percival spoke.|$|E
6000|$|... "Foolish," [...] said she. [...] "What {{matter the}} {{possessions}} {{that it may}} be yours to cast <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>lap?</b> Is that what we wait for, Agostino? Is there not Pagliano for you? Would not that, at need, be lordship enough?" ...|$|E
60|$|When I {{had done}} so, {{he made me}} put them <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>lap,</b> and took my little drawer, and poured out all my money among his, and bade me get me gone, and carry it all home into my own chamber.|$|E
60|$|Gradually, {{however, the}} quiet night {{received}} me into its peace (just as, poor soul, did the Moor Desdemona), {{and its influence}} stole <b>into</b> <b>my</b> darkened mind. The smooth, columnar boughs of the beeches lifted themselves archingly into the sky. Soon I was climbing over the moss-bound roots of my customary observatory. But this night the stars were left for a while unsignalled and unadmired. The crisped, frost-lined leaves scattered between the snake-like roots sparkled faintly. Years seemed to have passed away, dwindled in Time's hour-glass, since my previous visit. That Miss M. had ghosted herself away for ever. In my reverie the vision of Fanny re-arose <b>into</b> <b>my</b> imagination--that secret still fountain--of herself. Asleep now.... I could no more free myself from her sorcery than I could disclaim the two hands that lay in <b>my</b> <b>lap.</b> She was indeed more closely mine than they--and nearer in actuality than I had imagined.|$|R
60|$|FLORRIE. Oh! but I'm not tired, and I'm only nursing her. She'll {{be asleep}} in <b>my</b> <b>lap,</b> directly.|$|R
60|$|I folded {{my hands}} in <b>my</b> <b>lap</b> and I never took my eyes off Jemmy as he went running on.|$|R
6000|$|Into this {{derelict}} {{moment a}} fair-cheeked, breathless lady descended, and surreptitiously thrusting a crimson padded birthday {{book and a}} miniature pencil <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>lap,</b> entreated my autograph--"Just your signature, you know--for my small daughter. How she {{would have loved to}} be here!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He’ll have {{a fortune}} handed to him without any trouble or being {{responsible}} in any way," [...] said Tredgold, impressively. [...] "I {{should like to}} think there was somebody working to put a fortune like that <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>lap.</b> We shall have a fifth each." ...|$|E
6000|$|So {{she dropped}} the lump <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>lap</b> just at that moment, and I clapped my legs {{together}} on it and she went on talking. But only about a minute. Then she took off the hank and looked me straight in the face, and very pleasant, and says: ...|$|E

60|$|But I soon gave up all {{attempts}} at keeping {{a seat in}} one of these cars. It became my practice to sit down on the outside iron rail behind, and as the conductor generally sat in <b>my</b> <b>lap</b> I was in a measure protected. As for the inside of these vehicles the women of New York were, I must confess, too much for me. I would no sooner place myself on a seat, than I would be called on by a mute, unexpressive, but still impressive stare <b>into</b> <b>my</b> face, to surrender my place. From cowardice if not from gallantry I would always obey; and as this led to discomfort and an irritated spirit, I preferred nursing the conductor on the hard bar in the rear.|$|R
6000|$|He gently {{picked up}} a little local guidebook that lay in <b>my</b> <b>lap,</b> and turning its leaves, pointed to a page, and read as follows:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mrs. Schomberg jerked Heyst's note, twisted like a pipe-light, <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>lap</b> while I {{sat there}} unsuspecting," [...] Davidson went on. [...] "Directly I had {{recovered}} my senses, I {{asked her what}} on earth {{she had to do}} with it that Heyst should leave it with her. And then, behaving like a painted image rather than a live woman, she whispered, just loud enough for me to hear: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am glad, indeed, {{that it is}} so," [...] Stanley laughed, [...] "in {{the first}} place, because I could only have succeeded to it at your death; {{and in the second}} place, because I have no ambition, whatever, for a title. I am not {{nineteen}} yet, and should greatly prefer to make my own way, than to find myself with nothing whatever to do, except to spend money as it dropped <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>lap.</b>|$|E
60|$|One day, I do {{not know}} whether it was in the morning or afternoon, I raised my head, and on the horizon I saw a steamer. Quick as a flash my glass was brought to bear upon it. In the next minute my arms dropped, the {{telescope}} fell <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>lap,</b> my head dropped. It was not Bertha's steamer; it was an ordinary steamer with its deck parallel with the water and a long line of smoke coming out of its funnel. The shock of the disappointment was very great.|$|E
6000|$|I forgot {{even the}} dainty dressing-jacket on my back. [...] "Miss Bowater {{is pleased to}} be satirical," [...] I said, my hand clenched in <b>my</b> <b>lap.</b>|$|R
60|$|Presently he turned, {{without seeing}} me, {{and placed his}} foot absently in <b>my</b> <b>lap.</b> I {{affected}} not to notice it. But he started and looked down.|$|R
60|$|He stopped, {{and looked}} round at my corner. I sat there quite immovable, with my tracts at my elbow and with Miss Jane Ann Stamper on <b>my</b> <b>lap.</b>|$|R
6000|$|He {{read over}} {{all these things}} to me, and then, in a most moving, affectionate manner, and in words not to be answered, he said, [...] "Now, my dear, is this not sufficient? Can you object {{anything}} against it? If not, as I believe you will not, then let us debate this matter no longer." [...] With that {{he pulled out a}} silk purse, which had threescore guineas in it, and threw them <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>lap,</b> and concluded all the rest of his discourse with kisses and protestations of his love, of which indeed I had abundant proof.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{is eating}} your bread and salt," [...] said Conscience. That settled it; {{but even as}} I looked at him over the gun sight, Tookhees {{finished}} his crumb, came to my foot, ran along my leg <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>lap,</b> and looked into my face expectantly. The grizzled coat and the split ear showed the welcome guest at my table for a week past. He was visiting the stranger colony, as wood mice are fond of doing, and persuading them by his example that they might trust me, as he did. More ashamed than if I had been caught potting quail, I threw away the hateful shell that had almost slain my friend {{and went back to}} camp.|$|E
60|$|The next morning, {{as soon as}} breakfast was over, I went up to Miss Fairlie's sitting-room. The {{poor girl}} looked so pale and sad, and came forward to welcome me so readily and prettily, that the {{resolution}} to lecture her on her caprice and indecision, which I had been forming all the way upstairs, failed me on the spot. I led {{her back to the}} chair from which she had risen, and placed myself opposite to her. Her cross-grained pet greyhound was in the room, and I fully expected a barking and snapping reception. Strange to say, the whimsical little brute falsified my expectations by jumping <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>lap</b> and poking its sharp muzzle familiarly into my hand the moment I sat down.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; {{but first}} {{put your head}} in <b>my</b> <b>lap,</b> for there are ants in the grass and I like to see your eyes shine when you spin stories. Tell away." ...|$|R
6000|$|All {{this was}} on {{his side of the}} bargain. Now came mine. I folded tight my hands in <b>my</b> <b>lap,</b> glanced up at the flaming lamp. How much would he pay me? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, well, never mind," [...] she said. [...] "You needn't. I've {{got some}} picture books {{for you to}} look at. Come and sit on <b>my</b> <b>lap,</b> and we'll look at them together." ...|$|R
60|$|Two {{more days}} passed. We had {{advanced}} a little way--a very little way--into the larger {{space of the}} Gulf of Siam. Seizing eagerly upon the elation of the first command thrown <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>lap,</b> by the agency of Captain Giles, I had yet an uneasy feeling that such luck as this has got perhaps {{to be paid for}} in some way. I had held, professionally, a review of my chances. I was competent enough for that. At least, I thought so. I had a general sense of my preparedness which only a man pursuing a calling he loves can know. That feeling seemed to me the most natural thing in the world. As natural as breathing. I imagined I could not have lived without it.|$|E
60|$|I was {{so small}} that, in order to {{negotiate}} the pail, I sat down and gathered it <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>lap.</b> First I sipped the foam. I was disappointed. The preciousness evaded me. Evidently it did not reside in the foam. Besides, the taste was not good. Then I remembered seeing the grown-ups blow the foam away before they drank. I buried {{my face in the}} foam and lapped the solid liquid beneath. It wasn't good at all. But still I drank. The grown-ups knew what they were about. Considering my diminutiveness, the size of the pail in my lap, and my drinking out of it my breath held and my face buried to the ears in foam, it was rather difficult to estimate how much I drank. Also, I was gulping it down like medicine, in nauseous haste to get the ordeal over.|$|E
6000|$|P.S. With all {{of which}} I catch myself up on not having told you, decently and gratefully, of the always {{sympathetic}} attention with which I have read the [...] "Fennel and Rue" [...] you so gracefully dropped <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>lap</b> at that last hour, and which I had afterwards to toy with a little distractedly before getting the right peaceful moments and right retrospective mood (this in order to remount the stream of time to the very Fontaine de Jouvence of your subject-matter) down here. For {{what comes out of}} it to me more than anything else is the charming freshness of it, and the general miracle of your being capable of this under the supposedly more or less heavy bloom of a rich maturity. There are places in it in which you recover, absolutely, your first fine rapture. You confound and dazzle me; so go on recovering--it will make each of your next things a new document on immortal freshness! I can't remount--but can only drift on with the thicker and darker tide: wherefore pray for me, as who knows what may be at the end? ...|$|E
6000|$|Dermot, I swear, though Tady's locks {{could hold}} Ten {{thousand}} lice, and every louse was gold; Him on <b>my</b> <b>lap</b> you never more shall see; Or may I lose my weeding knife--and thee! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know the}} feeling, and I'll try what Lucy {{used to do}} to quiet me. Put your poor head in <b>my</b> <b>lap,</b> dear, and lie quite still while I cool and comfort it." ...|$|R
6000|$|Roberts: [...] "But I want to read, Agnes, and I've got {{to hold my}} Pop. Sci. {{with one}} hand and keep your traps in <b>my</b> <b>lap</b> with the other. Did you find a cook?" ...|$|R
