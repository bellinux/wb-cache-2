50|$|The Mongolian <b>short-toed</b> <b>lark</b> was {{originally}} {{placed in the}} genus Alauda.

Additionally, some authorities considered the Mongolian <b>short-toed</b> <b>lark</b> to be a subspecies of the red-capped lark.

40|$|SUMMARY. —Seasonal and interannual {{variability}} in laying date, clutch size, egg volume and hatching asynchrony of four lark species in Mediterranean Spain Aims: To describe {{the variation in}} laying date, clutch size, egg volume and hatching asynchrony of four lark species (Skylark Alauda arvensis, <b>Short-toed</b> <b>Lark</b> Calandrella brachydactyla, Thekla Lark Galerida theklae and Lesser <b>Short-toed</b> <b>Lark</b> Calandrella rufescens) and at two different time scales: between years (large-scale variation), and within seasons (short-scale variation). Location: Two climatically contrasting Mediterranean areas: Layna, located in {{the centre of the}} Iberian Peninsula and with a continental Mediterranean climate, and Cabo de Gata, located in the south-western Iberian Peninsula and with a semi-arid climate. Breeding Skylarks and <b>Short-toed</b> <b>Larks</b> occur in Layna, whereas breeding Thekla <b>Larks</b> and Lesser <b>Short-toed</b> <b>Larks</b> occur in Cabo de Gata. Methods: During the study period between 1991 - 95 in Layna and between 1991 - 94 and 1996 - 97 in Cabo de Gata, searches were carried out for nests of the four species and laying date, measured egg-length and width, and hatching asynchrony recorded. Overall, 118 nests of Skylarks, 165 of <b>Short-toed</b> <b>Larks,</b> 334 of Thekla Larks and 259 of Lesser <b>Short-toed</b> <b>Larks</b> were studied. Between-year variations in breeding parameters were analysed with General Linear Models (GLM’s). To investigate the presence or absence o...|$|R

5000|$|Hume's <b>short-toed</b> <b>lark</b> {{is similar}} in size and {{appearance}} to the greater <b>short-toed</b> <b>lark</b> but is generally a duller-looking bird with slightly darker plumage and a slightly smaller beak. As with the greater <b>short-toed</b> <b>lark,</b> the colour varies across the broad range {{and is not a}} good distinguishing feature. Hume's <b>short-toed</b> <b>lark</b> grows to a length of from 13 to 14 cm and the sexes are similar. The crown is brown with slight diffuse streaking, the cheeks are rufous-brown and the supercilium white. The upper parts are greyish-brown or sandy brown with darker streaking, and the upper tail coverts are washed with rufous-brown. The wings are greyish-brown with black barring and pale tips to the feathers. The underparts are mostly whitish, but there is a dark neck patch and a buffish-grey breast band. The breast is unstreaked. The voice helps distinguish this species; vocalisations include a shrill [...] "trree" [...] and a more rolling [...] "drreep".|$|R
