5|$|For torpedo {{training}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> difficult. Shallow {{water was}} needed to recover training duds. Torpedoes usually sank by 20 to 50 feet before making their run. Thorney Island was selected but then quickly ruled out as a useful site. It was later used, but at the time, its location near Portsmouth was considered too near the English Channel {{and as a result}} Turnberry in south-west Scotland was selected instead with Fighter Command giving up the site to Coastal Command. These Torpedo Training Units (TTU) were formed in January 1943. Training in this regard enabled the Command to cope with increasing demands for trained aircrews.|$|E
5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 309, Maximinus resumed {{persecution}} by issuing letters to provincial governors and his praetorian prefect, the highest authority in judicial proceedings after the emperor, demanding that Christians conform to pagan customs. His new legislation called for another general sacrifice, coupled with a general offering of libations. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> systematic than the first, allowing no exceptions for infants or servants. Logistai (curatores), strategoi, duumviri, and tabularii, who kept the records, {{saw to it that}} there were no evasions. Maximinus introduced some innovations to the process, making him the only known persecuting emperor to have done so. This edict now required food sold in the marketplaces to be covered in libation. Maximinus sent sentries to stand guard at bathhouses and city gates to ensure that all customers sacrificed. He issued copies of the fictitious Acts of Pilate to encourage popular hatred of Christ. Prostitutes confessed, under judicial torture, to having engaged in debaucheries with Christians. Bishops were reassigned to work as stable boys for the Imperial horse guard or keepers of the Imperial camels.|$|E
25|$|Cho {{made another}} miraculous comeback, {{this time in}} 1992 against his biggest rival Kobayashi Koichi in the Honinbo. Kobayashi had {{challenged}} for the Honinbo in 1990 and 1991, but Cho was too stubborn to give it up. Cho had come back in both finals, being down 3 games to 1, but pulled back 3 wins to defend the Honinbo. In 1991, he was down 2 to 0 in 1990, then won 4 {{games in a row}} to defend once more. In 1992, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> unbelievable. Cho was losing 3 games to 0, but was so relentless, that he came back and won 4 straight games once more to take the Honinbo away from Kobayashi's grip. This certainly showed that Cho could come back from any deficit and win again.|$|E

In 1839 de Candolle visited Britain and Darwin invited him to dinner, allowing the two scientists the opportunity to discuss the idea.|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{following}} {{the release of}} the Sugababes' fourth studio album, Taller in More Ways, it was announced in December 2005 that founding group member Mutya Buena had left the band. Two singles were subsequently released from the album featuring new group member Amelle Berrabah, who was announced as Buena's replacement 24 hours after her departure. In June 2006, the Sugababes began working on their fifth studio album which was confirmed for release in 2007. However, group member Heidi Range also revealed that a greatest hits album would be released in time for Christmas 2006, which would include all of the group's hits. When rumours arose that {{the release of the}} album was premature, band member Keisha Buchanan stated that the group had already started to plan a greatest hits album. She explained how it was essential for the album to be released following Buena's departure, saying: [...] "When Mutya left, we decided <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> important, we should do this as closure so we don't have to relive history all the time." [...] Group member Heidi Range also reflected upon this, saying: [...] "When Mutya was still in the band the greatest hits was always planned for this time anyway. But when she left it seemed even more appropriate." ...|$|E
500|$|Increasingly, American-made genre {{films were}} joined by foreign movies {{acquired}} at low cost and, where necessary, dubbed for the U.S. market. In 1956, distributor Joseph E. Levine financed the shooting of new footage with American actor Raymond Burr that was edited into the Japanese sci-fi horror film Godzilla. The British Hammer Film Productions made the successful The Curse of Frankenstein (1957) and Dracula (1958), major influences on future horror film style. In 1959, Levine's Embassy Pictures bought the worldwide rights to Hercules, a cheaply made Italian movie starring American-born bodybuilder Steve Reeves. On top of a $125,000 purchase price, Levine then spent [...] on advertising and publicity, a virtually unprecedented amount. The New York Times was nonplussed, claiming that the movie would have drawn [...] "little more than yawns in the film market... {{had it not been}} [...] throughout the country with a deafening barrage of publicity." [...] Levine counted on first-weekend box office for his profits, booking the film [...] "into as many cinemas as he could for a week's run, then withdrawing it before poor word-of-mouth withdrew it for him." [...] Hercules opened at a remarkable 600 theaters, and the strategy was a smashing success: the film earned [...] in domestic rentals. Just as valuable to the bottom line, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> successful overseas. Within a few decades, Hollywood would be dominated by both movies and an exploitation philosophy very much like Levine's.|$|E

The album is named for the intermittent weak contractions which some pregnant women experience. Daymond reflected on the recording process [...] "Because it was self-produced as well, {{there was no one in}} the producer's chair to tie the whole thing together. We've had to do that ourselves.

2500|$|In {{the early}} years after Einstein's theory was published, Sir Arthur Eddington lent his {{considerable}} prestige in the British scientific establishment {{in an effort to}} champion the work of this German scientist. [...] Because the theory was so complex and abstruse (even today it is popularly considered the pinnacle of scientific thinking; in {{the early years}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> so), it was rumored that only three people in the world understood it.

[...] Eddington paused, unable to answer. Silberstein continued [...] "Don't be modest, Eddington!"

2500|$|In {{the year}} 1726 two poems were {{published}} describing landscape {{from a personal}} {{point of view and}} taking their feeling and moral lessons from direct observation. One was John Dyer's [...] "Grongar Hill", the other was James Thomson's [...] "Winter", soon to be followed by all the seasons (1726–30). Both are unlike Pope's notion of the Golden Age pastoral as exemplified in his [...] "Windsor Forest". Mythology is at a minimum and there is no celebration of Britain or the crown. [...] Where the octosyllabic couplets of Dyer's poem celebrate the natural beauty of a mountain view and are quietly meditative, the declamatory blank verse of Thomson's winter meditation is melancholy and soon to establish that emotion as proper for poetic expression. One notable successor in that line was Edward Yonge's Night Thoughts (17421744). <b>It</b> <b>was,</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> than [...] "Winter", a poem of deep solitude, melancholy and despair. In these poems, there are the stirrings of the lyric as the Romantics would see it: the celebration of the private individual's idiosyncratic, yet paradigmatic, responses to the visions of the world.|$|E
