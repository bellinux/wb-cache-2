25|$|I {{never did}} {{know exactly what}} was meant by the term 'The Beats', but let's say that the {{original}} meeting, association, comradeship of Allen , myself, Michael , Lawrence , Philip Whalen, who's not here, Lew Welch, who's dead, Gregory , for me, to a somewhat lesser extent (I never knew Gregory {{as well as the}} others) did embody a criticism and a vision which we shared in various ways, and then went our own ways for many years. Where we began to come really close together again, in the late '60s, and gradually working toward this point, it seems to me, was when Allen began to take a deep interest in Oriental thought and then in Buddhism which added another dimension to our levels of agreement; and later through Allen's influence, Lawrence began to draw toward that; and from another angle, Michael and I after the lapse of some years of contact, found our heads very much in the same place, and it's very curious and interesting now; and Lawrence went off in a very political direction for a while, which none of us had any objection with, except that wasn't my main focus. It's very interesting that we <b>find</b> <b>ourselves</b> so much on the same ground again, after having explored divergent paths; and <b>find</b> <b>ourselves</b> united on this position of powerful environmental concern, critique of the future of the individual state, and an essentially shared poetics, and only half-stated but in the background very powerfully there, a basic agreement on some Buddhist type psychological views of human nature and human possibilities.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{significant}} political application of social media is Barack Obama's election campaign in 2008. It {{was the first of}} its kind, as it successfully incorporated social media into its campaign winning strategy, evolving the way of political campaigns forever more in the ever-changing technological world we <b>find</b> <b>ourselves</b> in today. His campaign won by engaging everyday people and empowering volunteers, donors and advocates, through social networks, text messaging, email messaging and online videos. Obama's social media campaign was vast, with his campaign boasting 5 million 'friends' on over 15 social networking sites, with over 3 million friends just on Facebook. Another significant success of the campaign was online videos, with nearly 2,000 YouTube videos being put online, receiving over 80 million views.|$|E

60|$|As, by {{the power}} we <b>find</b> in <b>ourselves</b> of repeating, as often as we will, any idea of space, we get the idea of IMMENSITY; so, {{by being able to}} repeat the idea of any length of {{duration}} we have in our minds, with all the endless addition of number, we come by the idea of ETERNITY. For we <b>find</b> in <b>ourselves,</b> we can no more come to an end of such repeated ideas than we can {{come to the end of}} number; which every one perceives he cannot. But here again it is another question, quite different from our having an IDEA of eternity, to know whether there were ANY REAL BEING, whose duration has been eternal. And as to this, I say, he that considers something now existing, must necessarily come to Something eternal. But having spoke of this in another place, I shall say here no more of it, but proceed on to some other considerations of our idea of infinity.|$|R

The essays explore how human identities are influenced by the environment. The collection represents an ecological approach to literature, history, natural history, geography, and human relationships. The essays consider the implications of estrangement from the land and urges reconnection with it as a means of survival in a global information age. ^ The author 2 ̆ 7 s personal experiences living in the region, and her family 2 ̆ 7 s five-generation history, contribute an intimate perspective on solitude, resilience, love, and death. ...|$|R

In 1947, during the Second Red Scare, Disney testified before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), where he branded Herbert Sorrell, David Hilberman and William Pomerance, former animators and labor union organizers, as communist agitators; Disney stated that the 1941 strike led by them was part of an organized communist effort to gain influence in Hollywood.|$|E
500|$|The {{expedition}} {{succeeded in}} combating incipient scurvy through a fresh seal meat diet, and Scott recommended it for future polar expeditions. This was despite {{the medical profession}} being ignorant {{of the causes of}} the disease. At that time it was known that a fresh meat diet could provide a cure, but not that lack of fresh meat or other fresh food containing the as yet undiscovered vitamin C was a cause. Thus, fresh seal meat was taken on the southern journey [...] "in case we <b>find</b> <b>ourselves</b> attacked by scurvy", On his 1907–09 Nimrod expedition Shackleton also avoided the disease through careful dietary provision, including extra penguin and seal meat. However, Lieutenant Edward Evans almost died of presumably self-inflicted scurvy during the 1910–13 Terra Nova expedition, and scurvy was particularly devastating to Shackleton's marooned Ross Sea party during 1915–16. It remained a danger until its causes were finally established, some 25years after the Discovery expedition.|$|E
40|$|Managing {{scientific}} data {{is by no}} means a trivial task even in a single site environment with a small number of researchers involved. We discuss some issues concerned with posing well-specified experiments in terms of parameters or instrument settings and the metadata framework that arises from doing so. We are particularly interested in parallel computer simulation experiments, where very large quantities of warehouse-able data are involved. We consider SQL databases and other framework technologies for manipulating experimental data. Our framework manages the the outputs from parallel runs that arise from large cross-products of parameter combinations. Considerable useful experiment planning and analysis can be done with the sparse metadata without fully expanding the parameter cross-products. Extra value can be obtained from simulation output that can subsequently be data-mined. We have particular interests in running large scale Monte-Carlo physics model simulations. <b>Finding</b> <b>ourselves</b> overwhelmed by the problems of managing data and compute ¿resources, we have built a prototype tool using Java and MySQL that addresses these issues. We use this example to discuss type-space management and other fundamental ideas for implementing a laboratory information management system...|$|R

We may <b>find</b> <b>ourselves</b> in safety at the next depot, {{but there is a}} horrid element of doubt." [...] The party then met with three, ultimately critical, difficulties: the non-appearance of the dog teams, a large unexpected drop in temperature, [...] and a shortage of fuel in the depots. The low temperatures caused poor surfaces which Scott likened to [...] "pulling over desert sand"; he described the surface as [...] "coated with a thin layer of woolly crystals, formed by radiation no doubt. These are too firmly fixed to be removed by the wind and cause impossible friction on the [...] runners." [...] The low temperatures were accompanied by an absence of wind, something Scott had expected to assist them on their northern journey.|$|E

[...] Roger Ebert in his review for the Chicago Sun-Times wrote, [...] "Two things, however, make Raiders of the Lost Ark {{more than just a}} technological triumph: its sense of humor and the droll style of its characters [...] We <b>find</b> <b>ourselves</b> laughing in surprise, in relief, in incredulity at the movie's ability to pile one incident upon another in an inexhaustible series of inventions." [...] He later added it to his list of [...] "Great Movies". Rolling Stone said the film was [...] "the ultimate Saturday action matinee–a film so funny and exciting it can be enjoyed any day of the week." [...] Bruce Williamson of Playboy claimed: [...] "There's more excitement in the first ten minutes of Raiders than any movie I have seen all year. By the time the explosive misadventures end, any movie-goer worth his salt ought to be exhausted." [...] Stephen Klain of Variety also praised the film. Yet, making an observation that would revisit the franchise with its next film, he felt that the film was surprisingly violent and bloody for a PG-rated film.|$|E
