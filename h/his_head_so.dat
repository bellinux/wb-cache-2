500|$|Gibbard {{credited}} Nick Harmer's bass {{line with}} being {{integral to the}} song, noting inspiration from bassists Eric Avery and Simon Gallup. [...] Harmer said of the bass line, [...] "I immediately gravitated to the creepy, stalker-ish theme that Ben created with the lyrics and the piano chords.... I liked the idea that once a stalker gets obsessed with an idea, it just keeps repeating in <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> <b>so</b> I wanted the bass line to have a repetitive, incessant theme." ...|$|E
500|$|Demosthenes {{started to}} learn rhetoric because {{he wished to}} take his guardians to court {{and because he was}} of [...] "delicate physique" [...] and couldn't receive gymnastic {{education}} which was customary. In Parallel Lives Plutarch states that Demosthenes built an underground study where he practiced speaking and shaving one half of <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>so</b> that he could not go out in public. Plutarch also states that he had “an inarticulate and stammering pronunciation” that he got rid of by speaking with pebbles in his mouth and by repeating verses when running or out of breath. He also practiced speaking in front of a large mirror.|$|E
500|$|Gosford Park screenwriter Julian Fellowes {{contacted}} King {{to present}} ideas for a script, {{and according to}} the producer, [...] " [...] seemed to have the whole movie planned out in <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>so</b> we told him to go ahead and write it. Three months later, this incredibly impressive screenplay showed up on our desks." [...] Fellowes was immediately hired by him and Scorsese. Fellowes chose not to end the film at Albert's death because he was wary of copying [...] "the horror of biopics," [...] where there is simply an important event after important event. Believing it had been done before and that the audience was already familiar with that part of Victoria's history, {{he thought it would be}} better suited for a television series or for another film.|$|E

60|$|This was the 'orse we fetched 'im; an' when {{we reached}} the car, We braced 'im tight and proper {{to the middle of the}} bar, And buckled up 'is traces and lashed them to each side, While 'e 'eld <b>'is</b> <b>'ead</b> <b>so</b> 'aughtily, an' looked most dignified.|$|R

500|$|According to Judith and Neil Morgan, Geisel {{conceived}} {{the core of}} Mulberry Street {{in the summer of}} 1936 aboard the MS Kungsholm, a Swedish American luxury liner, during the return trip from a European vacation with his wife, Helen Palmer. As the Kungsholm endured a storm and Geisel suffered from sea sickness, he jotted down a rambling plot that started with [...] "a stupid horse and wagon". To keep himself occupied, he began reciting poetry to the rhythm of the ship's engines and soon found himself saying, [...] "And that is a story that no one can beat, and to think that I saw it on Mulberry Street." [...] For days after they landed, he had the rhythm of the ship's engine stuck in <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> <b>so,</b> at Helen's suggestion, he decided to write a story based around it.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, SpongeBob {{wakes up}} with amnesia. He sees two fishes {{who have found}} his clothes and express {{interest}} in using them; SpongeBob mentions that he cannot remember anything except hitting <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> <b>so</b> the fish tell him that his name is [...] "CheeseHead BrownPants". However, they run away {{when they find out}} SpongeBob has a bottle of bubble soap. He wonders what the problem was and spots New Kelp City. Sandy and Patrick arrive at the Krusty Krab where customers have gathered, angered about not getting their orders, Sandy then shows the note from SpongeBob to Mr. Krabs. After he reads it, they all become upset about making him leave (except for Squidward who is happy about SpongeBob being gone). Mr. Krabs has the customers leave the restaurant, so that he and the other can decide on how to find SpongeBob.|$|E
500|$|Ponsford was a shy person, on {{the field}} and off. Robinson wrote that Ponsford [...] "was so {{reserved}} that you had to know him for three years or the duration of a Test tour before his reticence relaxed." [...] Similarly, when photographed Ponsford would hang <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>so</b> his cap would cover most of his face. This shyness intensified after his retirement. He would often walk along laneways to his work at the MCC, rather than be recognised {{on the way to the}} train station. While on the train, he would cover his face with the newspaper. At work, he disliked interaction with the public and would direct staff to advise visitors that he was not in, despite often being clearly in view. Bill O'Reilly said of Ponsford, [...] "He spoke rarely and even then only if he could improve on silence." [...] Nonetheless he was popular with his teammates and was said to have a droll sense of humour.|$|E
60|$|Don Ippolito made no answer. He let <b>his</b> <b>head</b> fall <b>so</b> low {{upon his}} breast {{that she could}} see the sacerdotal tonsure.|$|R
60|$|Hirst half turned {{round and}} threw <b>his</b> <b>head</b> back <b>so</b> {{that he looked}} at the {{branches}} crossing themselves in the air above him.|$|R
6000|$|Boggs rode {{up before}} the biggest store in town, and bent <b>his</b> <b>head</b> down <b>so</b> he could see under the curtain of the awning and yells: ...|$|R
2500|$|... "Very heavy English willow ! And {{there goes}} Excalibur into action again! Straight {{over the top}} of long-off, one of the most {{difficult}} shots in the book and umpire Tony Crafter's arms are growing heavy, he's been putting them above <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>so</b> often he's getting tired!" [...] - TCN Nine commentators Ian Chappell and Frank Tyson, 13 February 1983.|$|E
2500|$|Mizushima is {{helped to}} recover from his {{injuries}} by a monk. [...] One day, Mizushima steals the monk's robe and shaves <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>so</b> {{that he will not}} be spotted as a soldier. He begins a journey to the camp where his comrades were sent. Finding many corpses of dead Japanese soldiers along the way, he decides to bury them.|$|E
2500|$|James Stewart owned a [...] "willful but beloved" [...] golden {{retriever}} named Beau, {{of whom he}} was extremely fond. Beau slept {{in the corner of}} Stewart's bedroom, but would often crawl onto the bed between Stewart and his wife Gloria. Stewart recalled, [...] "he was up there because he wanted me to pat <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> <b>so</b> that’s what I would do. Somehow, my touching his hair made him happier, and just the feeling of him laying against me helped me sleep better." ...|$|E
60|$|Newman said nothing, but folding his arms, and {{thrusting}} <b>his</b> <b>head</b> forward <b>so</b> as {{to obtain}} a nearer view of Nicholas's face, scanned his features closely.|$|R
6000|$|Instantly he {{was wide}} awake, and, moving <b>his</b> <b>head</b> ever <b>so</b> little, saw their situation. Then he wished {{that he had}} {{remained}} asleep, for it was this: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Uncle Trevor, {{we wanted}} to tell you," [...] Cassandra replied for him. [...] "We waited--" [...] she looked appealingly at Rodney, who shook <b>his</b> <b>head</b> ever <b>so</b> slightly.|$|R
2500|$|Okajima has a {{distinctive}} pitching {{form in which}} he turns his head downwards just before he releases the ball and after release jerks it hard towards third base. These extra movements appear to give Okajima some added velocity to his pitches as they torque his body towards home plate and reportedly disguise his pitches and cause batters to swing early. Okajima {{is said to have}} mimicked the pitching form of a pitcher in Yoichi Takahashi's manga [...] who torqued <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>so</b> much after every pitch that his hat came flying off. Okajima admits, [...] "I was trying to copy the motion. I believed it would make me throw harder." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wood hunted {{an average}} 46 {{days out of}} his 60 days leave each year, almost up until his death. [...] He was {{convinced}} that hunting was of great value in training officers by encouraging horsemanship and developing an eye for terrain and for rapid decision-making in dangerous situations. [...] He was often injured, on one occasion whilst at Staff College falling on the crown of <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>so</b> badly that his neck swelled {{as if he were}} suffering from a large double goitre. [...] During the Second Boer War he was injured in the chest when he fell against a crucifix, worn under his shirt, which had belonged to his late wife.|$|E
2500|$|Flight {{attendant}} Claude Burgniard {{described the}} firefight as [...] "the apocalypse". Christophe Morin, a flight attendant, recalled that the GIGN ordered {{passengers and crew}} to get down {{as low as possible}} with their hands over their heads, hide, and then to not move. Morin described the situation as [...] "violent". He recalled putting his overcoat over <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>so</b> he would not see the tracer bullets and other occurrences during the raid. Morin said that he tried to help a female passenger next to him escape, but she was too large and Morin was unable to move her, so the two held hands. Pilot Bernard Delhemme said that he was in [...] "a rather bad spot", so he crouched and made himself [...] "as small as possible." [...] His mind made him believe that his body could stop bullets.|$|E
60|$|Brooke turned <b>his</b> <b>head</b> {{a little}} <b>so</b> {{that he could}} see Barbara's face.|$|R
60|$|Men stood forward, {{and having}} saluted, {{one by one}} asked this thing or that. The king heard their requests, and as he nodded or turned <b>his</b> <b>head</b> away, <b>so</b> they were granted or refused.|$|R
6000|$|Charley {{could see}} that Mr. Hardy heard, for he turned <b>his</b> horse's <b>head</b> <b>so</b> as to go rather wide {{of the corner of}} the fence. 'Now, Hubert and Terence, get ready; we shall have them directly.' ...|$|R
60|$|Neepeelootambo nodded <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>so</b> violently {{that it was}} {{a marvel}} it {{remained}} on his shoulders.|$|E
60|$|And {{he lifted}} <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>so</b> that the moon smote full upon his {{beautiful}} and ancient face.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Found him?' was the {{instantaneous}} {{question of}} both; but Hardy shook <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>so</b> sadly, that the Doctor hastily exclaimed, 'What then?' ...|$|E
60|$|A few strokes brought Jack and Coulter to {{the edge}} of the ice. Coulter was still holding fast, but his {{strength}} was rapidly growing weaker. <b>His</b> <b>head</b> shook <b>so</b> that <b>his</b> teeth rattled like castanets.|$|R
6000|$|... "May God trounce you for an obstinate fool," [...] murmured His Highness in English, {{and turning}} <b>his</b> <b>head</b> away <b>so</b> {{that the other}} should not hear him. But aloud and with studied graciousness he said: ...|$|R
6000|$|Charley {{could see}} that Mr. Hardy heard, for he turned <b>his</b> horse's <b>head</b> <b>so</b> as to go rather wide {{of the corner of}} the fence. [...] "Now, Hubert and Terence, get ready; we shall have them directly." ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Goble jerked <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>so</b> violently {{that the}} Derby hat flew off, {{to be picked}} up, dusted, and {{restored}} by the stage-director.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] cried Mr. Lavender, {{whose eyes}} were {{starting}} from <b>his,</b> <b>head,</b> <b>so</b> profoundly was he agitated {{by what was}} to him a new thought.|$|E
60|$|The {{man looked}} at her yet more curiously, and rubbed the back of <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>so</b> hard in his wonderment that he knocked his own hat off.|$|E
5000|$|... "Chunyu Kun {{threw back}} <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and laughed <b>so</b> hard that the cord {{of his hat}} snapped." ...|$|R
60|$|The Scarecrow was {{thinking}} again, and <b>his</b> <b>head</b> bulged out <b>so</b> horribly that Dorothy feared it would burst.|$|R
60|$|She was {{becoming}} quieter. He thanked the God of mercy that {{at last she}} {{was becoming}} quieter. <b>His</b> <b>head</b> felt <b>so</b> strange and blazed. Still he held her close, with trembling arms. His blood seemed very strong, enveloping her.|$|R
