5|$|Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) asks Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) to {{accompany}} him to the Six Sigmas Retreat in Croton-on-Hudson, New York, following his Bush administration and CEO debacles. There, Jack meets with the Six Sigmas, six men who each embody a core feature of Six Sigma: teamwork, insight, brutality, male enhancement, hand-shake-fulness and play-hard. They disapprove of Liz's antics during the team building exercises and demand that Jack distance himself from her {{if he wants to}} succeed, which he does. Before his dinner speech, Jack psyches himself up in the men's room, completely forgetting that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>wearing</b> a microphone and that everyone can hear him. Liz quickly takes the stage to draw attention away from Jack's embarrassment and finally ends up ripping her blouse open and dancing in front of everyone. She succeeds, and is banned from the retreat forever.|$|E
5|$|Resolving {{that they}} will never again let their guard down, the group decides {{that they will}} try to reach Fort Benning, the {{alternative}} to the CDC proposed by Shane in the prior season. As in {{the final version of the}} episode, a narration scene with Rick speaking to Morgan on the walkie-talkie was included, but was re-shot with modified dialog that served to replace the above material, allowing the premiere to begin with the group putting Atlanta behind them. Rick sports his full sheriff's wardrobe in the reshoot, whereas in the original version <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>wearing</b> the white undershirt he was wearing in the Season 1 finale.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Grace and Jack are {{discussing}} their own problems. Grace uses Jack's promiscuous history with married men {{as a legitimate}} reason to have {{an affair with a}} married man, but Jack tells her to forget about it as both of them are the moral role models to their friends. After being honest with her, Jack confesses that the reason <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>wearing</b> an eye patch is not because he got glitter in his eye, as he told his friends. When he refused to stop his singing performance during the debut of his new talk show, Jack Talk, even though the entire set had accidentally been set on fire, his eyebrow was burnt off. Later, Will, Grace, and Jack all decide that it would be for the best to let Karen know the truth about Stan. Will breaks the news to her, but Karen believes he is joking. Rosario tells Karen that Stan is not dead, as she has been giving him reports on Karen. At the admission, Karen fires Rosario and leaves Will's apartment with Malcolm, explaining that Stan may be alive, but that he is still dead to her.|$|E
50|$|A {{noticeable}} mistake can be seen, {{when the}} Decurion who captured Cacofonix <b>was</b> first seen, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> Bronze Armour. Later, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> seen <b>wearing</b> Steel Armour.|$|R
50|$|LeBlanc {{agreed that}} Dennis had the {{opportunity}} to kill his father, he had his father's DNA on the brown jacket <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>wearing,</b> the brown jacket had been dry cleaned after Dennis <b>was</b> informed <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a suspect, <b>he</b> told the police <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> a navy blazer, and there were no signs the murder arose from a robbery or forced entry.|$|R

5|$|The next day, Fung {{is having}} tea {{in a public}} square {{surrounded}} by his subordinates. He sees a beautiful woman (Kwai's pregnant friend) having tea in the same square. As {{he tries to get}} her attention, a large group of children come asking him to buy charity stickers. The children place stickers on Fung and his men. The pregnant woman leaves the square and meets up with Costello, then tells him that the man back in the square with the most number of stickers is Fung. Costello thanks her, makes his way to the square and begins to shoot a great many of the guards as well as Fung as chaos ensues. However, Fung turns out to be wearing a bulletproof vest. His subordinates help him run away from Costello, who gives chase on foot. As Costello walks, he checks the bystanders for stickers, which tips Fung off to the fact that Costello does not actually recognize him, apart from the stickers <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>wearing.</b> Fung removes the stickers from his coat, and puts them on the jacket of a subordinate instead. This causes Costello to shoot Fung's subordinate. Fung then removes his coat with all the stickers and runs off.|$|E

25|$|On {{the ground}} in front of Wolfe are his musket, {{cartridge}} box, and bayonet. Wolfe went into battle armed as his men were, although his musket was of higher quality. His dress is also of note. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>wearing</b> a red coat, a red waistcoat, red breeches, and a white shirt. Such dress was rather simple, especially for a commanding officer.|$|E
5000|$|Flowers {{denied the}} murders. He {{said he never}} {{admitted}} any crimes to his cellmates, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> Nike shoes, the clothes <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> that day did not match the description given by witnesses, and <b>he</b> had <b>been</b> handling fireworks {{the day before the}} murders. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> convicted of the murder of the store owner and sentenced to death in Montgomery County in 1997 ...|$|R

Release of the cover overloaded the magazine with {{both positive and negative}} responses, while generating more newsstand sales than any issue in the magazine's 50-year history.|$|E
25|$|In 1904, a Viking Age {{statuette}} {{identified as}} a depiction of Freyr was discovered on the farm Rällinge in Lunda, Södermanland parish {{in the province of}} Södermanland, Sweden. The depiction features a cross-legged seated, bearded male with an erect penis. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>wearing</b> a pointed cap and stroking his triangular beard. The statue is 9 centimeters tall and is displayed at the Swedish Museum of National Antiquities.|$|E
25|$|A few {{episodes of}} the 1960s ABC Western series The Big Valley mention San Quentin. In one notable episode, Jarrod Barkley hires an ex-prisoner {{to work on}} his family's ranch after he was wrongly convicted of murder when Jarrod prosecuted him. The ranch hands figure he is from San Quentin because of a gray jacket <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>wearing,</b> which one states is what you receive upon being {{released}} from San Quentin.|$|E

25|$|In The Lord of the Rings movie trilogy (2001–2003) by Peter Jackson, the Nazgûl {{are almost}} always {{concealed}} by cloaks; however, they appear as white ghostly corpses to Frodo when <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>wearing</b> the Ring. The Nazgûl attack the inn themselves. Their deafeningly loud shrieks and fell beasts are highlighted. During the siege of Minas Tirith, the Witch-king of Angmar wears a distinctive helmet over his hood resembling a mask and a crown, {{as opposed to the}} crown worn underneath his hood in the book. Their shrieks are distorted recordings of producer and screenwriter Fran Walsh's scream.|$|E
25|$|At the {{suggestion}} of Pope Leo XIII, Bartolo Longo and the Countess Mariana di Fusco were married on April 7, 1885. The couple remained continent (abstained from intercourse), and continued to do many charitable works and provided for orphaned children {{and the children of}} prisoners which for its time was revolutionary. In 1906 they donated the entire property of the Pompeii shrine to the Holy See. Longo continued promoting the Rosary until his death on October 5, 1926, at the age of 85. The piazza on which his basilica stands has since been named in memory of Longo. His body is encased in a glass tomb and <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>wearing</b> the mantle of a Knight of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre, a papal order of knighthood.|$|E
25|$|Ipomadon {{follows the}} maiden and her dwarf, with the maiden hurling insults and telling him in no {{uncertain}} terms to go away, {{in much the same way}} as a maiden representing the imprisoned lady of Synadoun will do to the hero of Thomas Chestre's fourteenth century Middle English Arthurian romance Libeaus Desconus. At last, having defeated many hostile knights along the way, Ipomadon, the maiden and her dwarf arrive near the city where the Proud is being besieged. Lyoline is on horseback outside the city wall, shouting great boasts. Ipomadon removes himself to a forest nearby, while the maiden enters the city. Ipomadon sends his cousin out to discover what colour armour Lyoline is wearing. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>wearing</b> black armour and is riding a black horse. Ipomadon dons black armour and rides out on a black horse, to challenge Lyoline to single combat for the hand of the Proud.|$|E

25|$|Marlo, Chris and Snoop visit Michael at home. Marlo {{questions}} {{him about}} the ring <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>wearing</b> on a {{chain around his neck}} and Michael reports that he took it from someone. Marlo is shocked, as the ring, which he initially took from Old Face Andre as part of a punishment for his stash house being robbed by Omar, had been stolen from Marlo by Omar several weeks ago in the poker game robbery, and then by Officer Walker from Omar when he was falsely arrested for murder, and then by Michael from Walker when the schoolboys ambushed him and covered him with yellow paint in an alley. Michael offers to give him the ring, unaware of its past, but Marlo allows him to keep it. Dukie descends and offers to ready Bug for school. Marlo tells Michael that he is putting him in charge of Bodie's corner and that he has another task for him. Snoop asks Michael who they killed for him and he reveals that it was Bug's father.|$|E
25|$|Several {{scenes are}} also {{omitted from the}} director's cut, {{including}} one where the knights sit around a camp fire asking about their intended Sarmatian life, in which Bors reveals that his children do not even have names, most simply have numbers. In addition, a sex scene between Guinevere and Arthur is shifted to be chronologically before he is informed of the incoming Saxons towards Hadrian's Wall. This seemingly minor change arguably helps the story flow more smoothly. In the original film he is seen in full battle armour, contemplating a broken image of Pelagius on his floor, and then is disturbed by a call to come outside. When he comes outside, he is hastily putting on a shirt, and his hair is disheveled. In the Director's Cut, after an intimate moment between Arthur and Guinevere explaining Arthur's morals, they carry on into their sexual encounter, and are thus disturbed so that Arthur can be briefed on the Saxons. During the sexual encounter, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>wearing</b> the same outfit he wears during the briefing. The scene where he is examining Pelagius's image is removed.|$|E
25|$|Charlie and Itchy {{use their}} {{winnings}} {{to build a}} successful casino in the junkyard where they live. Anne-Marie, upon discovering {{that she had been}} used, threatens to leave. To persuade her to stay, Charlie brings pizza to a family of poor puppies and their mother, Flo, at the old abandoned church. While there, Anne-Marie becomes upset at Charlie for stealing the wallet. She goes to the attic and wishes to live with the couple in the future. After a nightmare in which he is sent to Hell for eternity, Charlie wakes up in the room, only to find Anne-Marie gone. The couple, Kate and Harold, welcome Anne-Marie into their home, serving waffles. While they privately discuss adopting her, Charlie arrives and tricks her into leaving with him. Walking home, Charlie is shot by Carface and Killer, but finds that he is unable to be harmed as long as <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>wearing</b> the watch. Anne-Marie and Charlie hide in an abandoned building, but the ground breaks and they fall into the lair of King Gator. He and Charlie strike a chord as kindred spirits and he lets them go, but Anne-Marie falls ill with pneumonia.|$|E

50|$|Tyson {{appeared}} on WWE Monday Night Raw as the guest host on January 11, 2010 and even made {{his return to}} the ring in a tag team match with Chris Jericho against D-Generation X. At first, the duo had their way until Tyson revealed a DX T-shirt <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> underneath a black shirt <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> and knocked out Jericho, which allowed Shawn Michaels to pin Jericho, giving DX the win.|$|R

500|$|Dr. Otto Octavius {{tries to}} {{complain}} {{to his boss}} Norman Osborn {{about the dangers of}} several recent experiments they have been performing to create super villains in his laboratory, but is quickly berated by Osborn for his [...] "whining." [...] Octavius backs down and goes to work inside an experimentation chamber while Osborn departs. Unbeknown to him, the villain Green Goblin sneaks into the lab, activating the chamber's generators while locking Octavius inside. While unsuccessfully trying to escape from the chamber, the radiation emitted fuses the mechanical tentacles <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>wearing</b> into his skin.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "My Immortal" [...] begins with Lee {{sitting on a}} fountain. Her legs and arms are covered with bandage as she puts them in the water. She is wearing a long white dress and is seen walking around the fountain, {{surrounded}} by children and other people {{that appear to be}} unaware or indifferent to her presence and wearabouts. Shots of Moody follow, who appears to be sullen and withdrawn. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>wearing</b> a suit and his feet are bare. His shoulders sag and his head slumps forward as he delicately plays piano, and he later picks up his jacket as if he is about to leave. When the bridge starts, the band is shot performing in one room while Moody is in another, playing on the piano. Throughout the video, Lee is never filmed on ground level. She walks along the ledge of a fountain, sits in a tree and sings lying on top of a building. She also lies atop scaffolding and on the hood of a car surrounded with leaves.|$|E
500|$|The {{radicals}} use a Spiro Agnew alarm clock, {{which is}} based on a real item. When Mr. Burns drives a tank towards the Simpson house, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>wearing</b> oversized headgear. This is a reference to a public relations stunt by Michael Dukakis in 1988. When Mr. Burns plays a tape of [...] "Ride of the Valkyries", it has been recorded over by Smithers with [...] "Waterloo" [...] by ABBA, a reference to Smithers' implied homosexuality and to the helicopter beach attack scene in Apocalypse Now, in which [...] "Ride of the Valkyries" [...] is famously played. Maggie is shown dancing in her diaper and covered in slogans in a parody of the filler scenes of Laugh-In in which Goldie Hawn and other female cast members like Ruth Buzzi and Jo Anne Worley danced in a bikini with slogans and drawings painted on their bodies. The two FBI agents are Joe Friday and Bill Gannon from Dragnet. Bill Gannon is voiced by Harry Morgan, the man who played Gannon in the original series.|$|E
