This complexity is, of course, wellunderstoodby South African jurists whose system is derived both from the dominantEuropean traditions as well as from African customary systems, including both thosethat make up part of the official law of the state as well as those non-state norms thatcontinue to be important in the daily lives of many South Africans...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The new {{electronic}} {{relations have}} brought as much benefits as duties. The society uses more often computers {{in every day}} life than ever. Unfortunately, cyberspace bounds are huge and its regulation is very complicated. In many cases the users are responsible for his security. That is why <b>Electronic</b> <b>Law</b> knowledge is useful and important for the new society. The most powerful computer and net users {{are those who are}} educated in Computer Science. Various authorities in the field of Computer Science education are urging the necessity of topics on legal regulation of the electronic society. Several universities in Latvia starting from the 2002 / 2003 study year have implemented a new course on “IT Industry Standards, Legislation, Labour Protection and Ergonomics”. The topic is extended considering the students being programmers, computer users and hired workers. This paper describes the demand for teaching the legal regulation of electronic processes to Computer Science students, gives and overview of the course preparation, teaching and findings received from the first year experience...|$|E

40|$|Professor Hibbitts reassesses {{the history}} and future of the law review in light of {{changing}} technological and academicconditions. He analyzes why law reviews developed {{in the late nineteenth}} and early twentieth centuries and shows how three different waves of criticism have reflected shifting professorial, professional, and pedagogical concerns about the genre. Recent editorial reforms and the inauguration of on-line services and <b>electronic</b> <b>law</b> journals appear to solve some of the law review's traditional problems, but Professor Hibbitts suggests that these procedural and technological modifications leave the basic criticisms of the law review system unmet. In this context, Professor Hibbitts proposes that legal writers self-publish on the World Wide Web, as he did in a previous version of this Article. This strategy, Professor Hibbitts argues, would give legal writers more control over the substance and form of their scholarship, would create moreopportunities for spontaneity and creativity, and would promote more direct dialogue among legal thinkers. It would also sound the death knell for law reviews in their present form...|$|E
40|$|Collaborative work is {{increasingly}} being mediated by distributed information {{technologies such as}} the Internet. However, {{it is difficult to}} make the virtual professional communities, in which this collaboration takes place, operate successfully. One of the reasons is that users are not sufficiently in control of the ongoing specification process of their continuously changing network information systems. Furthermore, changes in such an information system need to be legitimate, {{in the sense that they}} are both meaningful and acceptable to all members of the community. The focus of this thesis is on developing an approach to assist virtual professional communities in the legitimate user-driven specification of their network information systems. The main results of the research are a theoretical framework that can be used to describe and analyze legitimate user-driven system specification. Furthermore, the RENISYS (REsearch Network Information SYstem Specification) method has been developed in which these theoretic insights are used to support the actual specification process. Two cases have been analyzed using this method: one case concerned the Global Research Network on Sustainable Development, the other was about the development of an <b>electronic</b> <b>law</b> journal. The thesis is concluded with a description of a prototype tool implementing the RENISYS method...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} {{a case study of}} a {{stand-alone}} legal research skills programme in the Oxford University Law Faculty. The research methodology involved interviews, surveys and observation of students at two points in 2004 and 2006. The study finds that students increasingly use networked computers as their primary information source, with most students using legal databases to find cases, statutes and articles on their reading lists. Students’ skills are better developed in citation searching than in subject searching and in using the more complex features of databases. Formative assessment, represented in ‘getting through the reading list’ for weekly tutorials and essays, was the crucial factor in providing opportunities for students to develop citation searching skills. The study also found that students handle different resources differently, being more likely to read law reports on the computer screen than articles, and using <b>electronic</b> <b>law</b> reports as part of a computer-based study strategy. The report describes how students use the internet to search for materials when writing essays, and considers the question of plagiarism. It recommends that students should be given successive opportunities to do research as part of their everyday study to enable them to develop better research skills and practices...|$|E

40|$|After the September 11 th {{attacks in}} 2001, Congress hastily passed the USA-Patriot Act which made several changes to <b>electronic</b> {{surveillance}} <b>law.</b> The Act has sparked a fierce debate. However, {{the pros and}} cons of the USA-Patriot Act are only one part of a much larger issue: How effective is the <b>law</b> that regulates <b>electronic</b> surveillance? The USA-Patriot Act made a number of changes in <b>electronic</b> surveillance <b>law,</b> but the most fundamental problems with the law did not begin with the USA-Patriot Act. In this article, Professor Solove argues that <b>electronic</b> surveillance <b>law</b> suffers from significant problems that predate the USA-Patriot Act. The USA-Patriot Act indeed worsened some of these problems, but surveillance law had lost its way long before. Surveillance law is thus in need of a radical reconstruction. After exploring specific difficulties with the scope, standards, and enforcement mechanisms of the statutes, Solove turns to examine the more deeply-rooted and systematic problems. Solove contends that <b>electronic</b> surveillance <b>law</b> is overly intricate and complex, that it has failed to keep pace in adapting to new technologies, and that it provides for insufficient judicial and legislative oversight. He proposes ways in which surveillance law should be reconstructed to address these problems. Solove recommends a rather radical solution: Warrants supported by probable cause should be required for most uses of electronic surveillance. Finally, Solove suggests that Congress draft a charter regulating the FBI...|$|R
