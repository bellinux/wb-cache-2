In addition, the quartz's piezoelectric property converts the mechanical vibrations into an oscillating voltage, which is picked up by the attached electrodes. These crystal oscillators {{are used in}} quartz clocks and watches, to create the clock signal that runs computers, and to stabilize the output signal from radio transmitters.

40|$|We {{address the}} {{complexity}} of computing the smallestradius infinite cylinder that encloses an input set of n points in 3 -space. We further report on experimental work involving an exact and a numerical strategy. A major topic of geometric optimization is to approximate point sets by simple geometric figures. This includes extensively studied planar problems such as smallest enclosing circles, the minimum width annulus, and the minimum width slab. In higher dimensions, there are few non-trivial complexity results for geometric figures beyond hyperplanes or spheres. We consider the following: Smallest Cylinder Problem (P 1) : Let I be a given set of n points in 3 -space. Find a line ℓ which minimizes max { d(ℓ,c) : c ∈ I}. Here, d(ℓ, c) denotes the minimum Euclidean distance between c and a point of ℓ. Cylinders constitute an important primitive shape in computer-aided design and manufacturing. For example {{in the area of}} <b>dimensional</b> tolerancing and <b>metrology</b> (see [SV, Ya]), the task is, given a physical object, to verify its conformance to tolerance specifications by taking probes of its surface. 1 Summary of Theoretical Results The heart of our approach is to consider restricted versions of the problem, fixing one or more optimization parameters, and using decision scheme for the restricted subproblem. The details and other results can be found in [SSTY]. To obtain efficient decision algorithms, it is often possible to exploit a linearization technique.
