5|$|With the new synagogue, {{an organ}} was {{introduced}} into religious service. The {{small minority of}} Orthodox Jews found this change to be <b>intolerable,</b> {{and they began to}} hold their services separately, in rented rooms.|$|E
5|$|Feeling that a {{complete}} {{destruction of the}} GUNT would be an <b>intolerable</b> blow for his prestige, and fearing that Habré would provide support for all opposition to Gaddafi, the Colonel called for a Libyan intervention in force, as his Chadian allies could not secure a definitive victory without Libyan armor and airpower.|$|E
5|$|The {{young men}} and women of Hazelwood East {{expected}} a civics lesson, but not the one the Court teaches them today...Such unthinking contempt for individual rights is <b>intolerable</b> from any state official. It is particularly insidious from (a school principal) to whom the public entrusts the task of inculcating in its youth an appreciation for the cherished democratic liberties that our constitution guarantees.|$|E
5|$|A despondent Bart is told by Lisa that he {{is still}} needed as Milhouse's friend and confidant, and Bart eagerly accepts this new role. However, Milhouse finds his own job <b>intolerable</b> and disappears, right during the filming of the most {{expensive}} scene in the movie. The film is suspended while the townspeople search for Milhouse. Eventually, Bart finds him in his treehouse, and despite encouragement from former child star Mickey Rooney, Milhouse gives up on his acting career. With the film now cancelled and the producers bankrupt, the directors return to Hollywood.|$|E
5|$|As his hunger became <b>intolerable,</b> Periyar {{was forced}} to feed on {{leftovers}} from the streets. Around this time, he realised that the eatery which had refused him entry was built by a wealthy non-Brahmin from South India. This discriminatory attitude dealt a blow to Periyar's regard for Hinduism, for the events he had witnessed at Kasi were completely different from the picture of Kasi he had in mind, as a holy place which welcomed all. Ramasami was a theist until his visit to Kasi, after which his views changed and he became an atheist.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, the Daily Telegraph {{reported}} that a prisoner serving a 27-year sentence was conducting a lone protest on the roof against conditions and was being cheered by other prisoners. The newspaper also referenced in its own report an interview with former lord chief justice Lord Woolf from {{earlier in the year}} where he described prisoners being kept in <b>intolerable</b> conditions–as bad as {{at the time of the}} riots. Woolf recommended prisons were kept out of politics.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} stages of {{end-of-life}} care, midazolam is routinely used at low doses via subcutaneous injection to help with agitation, myoclonus, restlessness or anxiety in the last hours or days of life. At higher doses during the last weeks of life, midazolam is considered a first line agent in palliative continuous deep sedation therapy when it is necessary to alleviate <b>intolerable</b> suffering not responsive to other treatments, but the need for this is rare.|$|E
5|$|Soay has a {{primitive}} hut known as Taigh Dugan (Dugan's house). This {{is little more}} than an excavated hole under a huge stone with two rude walls on the sides. The story of its creation relates to two sheep-stealing brothers from Lewis who came to St Kilda only to cause further trouble. Dugan was exiled to Soay, where he died; the other, called Fearchar Mòr, was sent to Stac an Armin, where he found life so <b>intolerable</b> he cast himself into the sea.|$|E
5|$|With the {{pressure}} on the Diệm regime increasing during the Buddhist crisis, Nhu and Diệm began to shun their cabinet members because they presented arguments contrary to the thinking of the Ngô family. Many ministers attempted to resign, but Thơ was credited with persuading them to stay in office. Finding the situation increasingly <b>intolerable,</b> Thơ also considered resigning but the dissident generals urged him to remain. They were worried that mass resignations would arouse suspicion of a coup plot.|$|E
5|$|In ancient Athens, {{a person}} who {{committed}} suicide without {{the approval of the}} state was denied the honors of a normal burial. The person would be buried alone, {{on the outskirts of the}} city, without a headstone or marker. However, it was deemed to be an acceptable method to deal with military defeat. In Ancient Rome, while suicide was initially permitted, it was later deemed a crime against the state due to its economic costs. Aristotle condemned all forms of suicide while Plato was ambivalent. In Rome some reasons for suicide include volunteering death in a gladiator combat, guilt over murdering someone, to save the life of another, as a result of mourning, from shame from being raped, as an escape from <b>intolerable</b> situations like physical suffering, military defeat, or criminal pursuit.|$|E
5|$|Massachusetts was {{a center}} of the {{movement}} for independence from Great Britain; colonists in Massachusetts had long uneasy relations with the British monarchy, including open rebellion under the Dominion of New England in the 1680s. Protests against British attempts to tax the colonies after the French and Indian War ended in 1763 led to the Boston Massacre in 1770, and the 1773 Boston Tea Party escalated tensions. In 1774, the <b>Intolerable</b> Acts targeted Massachusetts with punishments for the Boston Tea Party and further decreased local autonomy, increasing local dissent. Anti-Parliamentary activity by men such as Samuel Adams and John Hancock, followed by reprisals by the British government, were a primary reason for {{the unity of the}} Thirteen Colonies and the outbreak of the American Revolution in 1775.|$|E
5|$|The WHO {{guidelines}} recommend prompt {{oral administration}} of drugs when pain occurs, starting, {{if the person}} is not in severe pain, with non-opioid drugs such as paracetamol, dipyrone, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or COX-2 inhibitors. Then, if complete pain relief is not achieved or disease progression necessitates more aggressive treatment, mild opioids such as codeine, dextropropoxyphene, dihydrocodeine or tramadol are added to the existing non-opioid regime. If this is or becomes insufficient, mild opioids are replaced by stronger opioids such as morphine, while continuing the non-opioid therapy, escalating opioid dose until the person is painless or the maximum possible relief without <b>intolerable</b> side effects has been achieved. If the initial presentation is severe cancer pain, this stepping process should be skipped and a strong opioid should be started immediately in combination with a non-opioid analgesic.|$|E
5|$|The {{reign of}} the first four kings was {{distinct}} {{from that of the}} last three kings. The first kings were elected. Between the reigns of the final three kings, however, the monarchy became hereditary, and as such, the senate became subordinated to the king. This breach in the senate's sovereignty, rather than an <b>intolerable</b> tyranny, was probably what led the Patricians in the senate to overthrow the last king. The king may have sought the support of the Plebeians; however, the Plebeians were no doubt exhausted from their continued military service, and from their forced labor in the construction of public works. They were probably also embittered by their lack of political power, and therefore did not come to the aide of either the king or the senate.|$|E
5|$|As-Salih Ayyub {{returned}} to Damascus {{to keep an}} eye on developments in northern Syria. Al-Ashraf Musa of Homs had ceded the important stronghold of Salamiyah to as-Salih Ayyub the previous winter, perhaps to underline their patron-client relationship. This troubled the Ayyubids of Aleppo who feared it would be used as a base for a military take-over of their city. An-Nasir Yusuf found this <b>intolerable</b> and decided to annex Homs in the winter of 1248. The city surrendered in August and an-Nasir Yusuf's terms forced al-Ashraf Musa to hand over Homs, but he was allowed to retain nearby Palmyra and Tell Bashir in the Syrian Desert. As-Salih Ayyub sent Fakhr ad-Din to recapture Homs, but Aleppo countered by sending an army to Kafr Tab, south of the city. An-Nasir Dawud left Karak for Aleppo to support an-Nasir Yusuf, but in his absence, his brothers al-Amjad Hasan and az-Zahir Shadhi detained his heir al-Mu'azzam Isa and then personally went to as-Salih Ayyub's camp at al-Mansourah in Egypt to offer him control of Karak in return for holdings in Egypt. As-Salih Ayyub agreed and sent the eunuch Badr al-Din Sawabi to act as his governor in Karak.|$|E
5|$|Cossacks {{were first}} semi-nomadic, then also settled East Slavic {{people of the}} Dnieper River area, who practiced brigandage and plunder, and, renowned for their {{fighting}} prowess, early in their history assumed a military organization. Many of them were, or originated from run-away peasants from the eastern and {{other areas of the}} Commonwealth or from Russia; other significant elements were townspeople and even nobility, who came from the region or migrated into Ukraine. Cossacks considered themselves free and independent of any bondage and followed their own elected leaders, who originated from the more affluent strata of their society. There were tens of thousands of Cossacks already early in the 17th century. They had frequently clashed with the neighboring Turks and Tatars and raided their Black Sea coastal settlements. Such excursions, executed by formal subjects of the Polish king, were <b>intolerable</b> {{from the point of view}} of foreign relations of the Commonwealth, because they violated peace or interfered with the state's current policy toward the Ottoman Empire.|$|E
5|$|Henson {{spoke out}} strongly, and {{ultimately}} unsuccessfully, against the proposed disestablishment of the Anglican Church in Wales. In doing so he addressed many nonconformist gatherings; the historian Owen Chadwick {{suggests that this}} may have commended him to David Lloyd George, who became prime minister in 1916. A serious doctrinal row within the Church seemed to many to put Henson {{out of the running}} for elevation to a bishopric. He had defended the right of clergy to express doubts about the virgin birth and bodily resurrection. He was, as most of his critics failed, or refused, to notice, doctrinally orthodox on the resurrection, and content to accept the tradition of the virgin birth, but his contention that other priests had the right to question them was <b>intolerable</b> to the Anglo-Catholic wing of the Church, led by Gore.|$|E
5|$|In 1768, {{a treaty}} was {{negotiated}} between {{several of the}} British colonies and the Iroquois. The Iroquois sold their territorial claims to the colonies {{as part of the}} treaty. The company created to hold that claim was named the Indiana Land Company, the first recorded use of the word Indiana. The claim was disputed by the colony of Virginia, which did not participate in the treaty because it already laid claim to the land through its royal charter. In 1773, the territory of Indiana was brought under the administration of Province of Quebec to appease its French population. The Quebec Act was listed as one of the <b>Intolerable</b> Acts the Thirteen Colonies cited as a reason for the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War. The thirteen colonies thought themselves entitled to the territory for their support of Great Britain during the French and Indian War, and were incensed that it was given to the enemy the colonies had been fighting.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, H.D. {{traveled}} to Vienna to undergo analysis with Sigmund Freud. She {{had an interest}} in Freud's theories as far back as 1909, when she read some of his works in the original German. H.D. was referred by Bryher's psychoanalyst due to her apparent paranoia about the rise of Adolf Hitler which indicated another world war, an idea that H.D. found <b>intolerable.</b> The Great War (World War I) had left her feeling shattered. She had lost her brother in action, while her husband suffered effects of combat experiences, and she believed that the onslaught of the war indirectly caused the death of her child with Aldington: she believed it was her shock at hearing the news about the RMS Lusitania that directly caused her child to be stillborn. Writing on the Wall, her memoir about this psychoanalysis, was written concurrently with Trilogy and published in 1944; in 1956 it was republished with Advent, a journal of the analysis, under the title Tribute to Freud.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that, in 12 workers exposed for two or more years to acetic acid airborne average concentration of 51 ppm (estimated), produced symptoms of conjunctive irritation, upper respiratory tract irritation, and hyperkeratotic dermatitis. Exposure to 50 ppm or more is <b>intolerable</b> to most persons and results in intensive lacrimation and irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, with pharyngeal oedema and chronic bronchitis. Unacclimatised humans experience extreme eye and nasal irritation at concentrations in excess of 25 ppm, and conjunctivitis from concentrations below 10 ppm {{has been reported}}. In a study of five workers exposed for seven to 12 years to concentrations of 80 to 200 ppm at peaks, the principal findings were blackening and hyperkeratosis of {{the skin of the}} hands, conjunctivitis (but no corneal damage), bronchitis and pharyngitis, and erosion of the exposed teeth (incisors and canines).|$|E
5|$|Thailand, which {{shared an}} 800-kilometer (500-mile) border with Kampuchea and has {{historically}} feared Vietnam's expansionism, demanded that Vietnam immediately remove its troops from Kampuchea so its people could elect a government free from foreign intervention. Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Singapore showed {{their support for}} Thailand's position. Furthermore, ASEAN viewed Vietnam’s invasion and subsequent occupation of Kampuchea, which received strong Soviet support, as an <b>intolerable</b> threat to the region’s security and stability. That view was shared by China, which {{went as far as}} accusing Vietnam of forcing Kampuchea into an Indochinese federation to serve as an outpost of Soviet global hegemony. The United States, which never maintained any form of diplomatic ties with the Khmer Rouge’s Democratic Kampuchea, showed strong support for the membership of their former enemy in the UN General Assembly, and echoed ASEAN's call for an immediate withdrawal of Vietnamese military forces from Kampuchea.|$|E
5|$|The royals {{were eager}} to settle scores after Montfort’s defeat. At the Parliament at Winchester in September the same year, all those who had taken part in the {{rebellion}} were disinherited. Yet even though the uprising of the younger Simon Montfort in Lincolnshire was over by Christmas, scattered resistance remained. The main problem was the garrison encamped at the virtually impregnable Kenilworth Castle, and a siege started {{in the summer of}} 1266 seemed futile. By the end of October, the royals drew up the so-called Dictum of Kenilworth, whereby rebels were allowed to buy back their land at prices dependent on their level of involvement in the rebellion. The defenders of the castle turned down the offer at first, {{but by the end of}} the year conditions had become <b>intolerable,</b> and in 1267 the Dictum was agreed upon.|$|E
5|$|Zeta-Jones {{initially}} established {{herself in}} Hollywood with roles that highlighted her sex appeal {{such as in}} the action film The Mask of Zorro (1998) and the heist film Entrapment (1999). Critics praised her portrayal of a vengeful pregnant woman in Traffic (2000) and a murderous singer in the musical Chicago (2002). The latter won her Academy and BAFTA Awards for Best Supporting Actress, among other accolades. She starred in high-profile films for much of the decade, including the black comedy <b>Intolerable</b> Cruelty (2003), the heist film Ocean's Twelve (2004), the comedy The Terminal (2004), and the romantic comedy No Reservations (2007). Parts in smaller-scale features were followed by a decrease in workload, during which she returned to stage and portrayed an ageing actress in A Little Night Music (2009), winning a Tony Award. Zeta-Jones continued to work intermittently in the 2010s, starring in the psychological thriller Side Effects (2013) and the action film Red 2 (2013).|$|E

25|$|While {{strongly}} advocating {{openness to}} migrants and refugees, Francis {{acknowledged that the}} right to migrate must be regulated, while refugees from war or other <b>intolerable</b> situations must be received with greater openness.|$|E
25|$|The Coens {{directed}} the 2003 film <b>Intolerable</b> Cruelty, starring George Clooney and Catherine Zeta-Jones, {{a throwback to}} the romantic comedies of the 1940s. It focuses on hotshot divorce lawyer Miles Massey and a beautiful divorcée whom Massey managed to prevent from receiving any money in her divorce. She vows to get even with him while, at the same time, he becomes smitten with her. <b>Intolerable</b> Cruelty received generally positive reviews, although it {{is considered one of the}} duo's weaker films. Also that year, they executive produced and did an uncredited rewrite of the Christmas black comedy Bad Santa, which garnered positive reviews.|$|E
25|$|Monk {{writes that}} Wittgenstein found it <b>intolerable</b> that a war {{was going on}} and he was {{teaching}} philosophy. He grew angry when any of his students wanted to become professional philosophers.|$|E
25|$|The High Court {{found that}} the {{employment}} relationship had not broken down irretrievably and {{that none of the}} appellant's complaints had rendered his position <b>intolerable</b> or caused him to resign, and accordingly dismissed the action.|$|E
25|$|NASA further {{leveraged}} {{their position}} {{by threatening to}} publicly reveal the heavy involvement of Mr. Kubrick's younger brother, Raul, with the American Communist Party. This {{would have been an}} <b>intolerable</b> embarrassment to Mr. Kubrick, especially since the release of Dr. Strangelove.|$|E
25|$|If the <b>Intolerable</b> Acts {{were not}} repealed, the Colonies would also cease exports to Britain after September 10, 1775. The boycott was {{successfully}} implemented, but {{its potential for}} altering British colonial policy was cut off by {{the outbreak of the}} American Revolutionary War.|$|E
25|$|His health {{suffering}} from both stress and the <b>intolerable</b> climate, {{he returned to}} England in March 1794. Within {{a few months of}} returning he wed Judith Rutter at Portsea, Hampshire, on 29 May 1794. They had three children, a daughter and two sons, before Judith's death.|$|E
25|$|He {{published}} his first verses in 1897, {{while still in}} high school (at the time, his attempt to publish a literary magazine was considered <b>intolerable</b> by his teachers). He left for Bucharest later in the same year, being signed up for a private school and completing two grades in one year.|$|E
25|$|The {{board of}} {{directors}} at the Bank of Norway has in writing on the 8th September 1917 informed the Ministry that the shortage of change has now become outright <b>intolerable.</b> One company after another complain that they cannot arrange the agreed salaries for their workers, and the merchants cannot change their customers' banknotes.|$|E
25|$|When discontinuing {{treatment}} with duloxetine, the manufacturer recommends a gradual {{reduction in the}} dose, rather than abrupt cessation, whenever possible. If <b>intolerable</b> symptoms occur following {{a decrease in the}} dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate.|$|E
