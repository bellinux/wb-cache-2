500|$|His detractors {{include his}} {{extended}} {{family and his}} father's former secretary, Barbara Wilson. She told reporters that Bamber used to provoke his parents, riding in circles around his mother on a bicycle, wearing make-up to upset his father, and once hiding a bag of live rats in the secretary's car. Whenever Bamber visited the farm, there were arguments, she said. Tension had apparently increased {{in the weeks before}} the murders; she said Nevill had remarked to her about foreseeing a [...] "shooting accident". Bamber's girlfriend, Julie Mugford, alleged that he had talked about killing his family. A farm worker testified that Bamber had once said of Sheila: [...] "I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>share</b> my money with my sister." [...] In March 1985 he reportedly told a cousin: [...] "I could kill anybody...I could easily kill my parents". Bamber denied having said any of these things.|$|E

50|$|In February 21, the Central Bank {{pledged to}} assist private banks with a 25 billion kyat ($25 million) bailout, at 4% {{interest}} rate.

This liquidity support represented about 3.5% of all deposits in these banks. However, according to the Irrawaddy Newspaper, this money have never actually arrived to these banks.|$|R
6000|$|... "We are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{have our}} <b>share</b> {{of the fun}} to-day," [...] O'Grady said, as he stood {{with a group of}} officers, {{watching}} the wooded plain and the head of Laborde's column debouching from among the trees, and moving towards the hill.|$|R
6000|$|For this {{establishment}} it {{was that}} Mrs. St. John Deloraine wanted a housekeeper and an assistant. The former housekeeper, {{as we have been}} told, had yielded to love, [...] "which subdues the hearts of all female women, even of the prudent," [...] according to Homer, and was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>share</b> the home and bear the children of a plumber. With her usual invincible innocence, Mrs. St. John Deloraine had chosen to regard the Hon. Thomas Cranley as a kind good Christian in disguise, and to him she appealed in her need of a housekeeper and assistant.|$|E
60|$|And so {{saying she}} wandered {{away into the}} {{thickest}} part of the wood, and sat down under a thorn tree, where a nightingale was singing. Presently she heard him say: 'Search under the bush Princess; you will find some sugar, almonds, and some tarts there But don't be silly enough to offer Fanfaronade any.' And this time the Princess, who was fainting with hunger, took the nightingale's advice, and ate what she found all by herself. But Fanfaronade, seeing that she had found something good, and was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>share</b> it with him, ran after her in such a fury that she hastily drew out the Queen's carbuncle, which had the property of rendering people invisible {{if they were in}} danger, and when she was safely hidden from him she reproached him gently for his unkindness.|$|E
6000|$|We {{came to an}} agonized {{consciousness}} of the misery of this progress in the Chapel of the Constable, where it threatened to be finally stayed by the indecision of certain ladies of our nation in choosing among the postal cards for sale there. By this time we had suffered much from {{the wonders of the}} cathedral. The sacristan had not spared us a jewel or a silvered or gilded sacerdotal garment or any precious vessel of ceremonial, so that our jaded wonder was inadequate to the demand of the beautiful tombs of the Constable and his lady upon it. The coffer of the Cid, fastened against the cathedral wall for a monument of his shrewdness in doing the Jews of Burgos, who, with the characteristic simplicity of their race, received it back full of sand and gravel in payment of the gold they had lent him in it, could as little move us. Perhaps if we could have believed that he finally did return the value received, we might have marveled a little at it, but from what we knew of the Cid this was not credible. We did what we could with the painted wood carving of the cloister doors; the life-size head of a man with its open mouth for a key-hole in another portal; a fearful silver-plated chariot given by a rich blind woman for bearing the Host in the procession of Corpus Christi; but it was very little, and I am not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>share</b> my failure with the reader by the vain rehearsal of its details. No literary art has ever reported a sense of picture or architecture or sculpture to me: the despised postal card is better for that; and probably throughout these [...] "trivial fond records" [...] I shall be found shirking as much as I may the details of such sights, seen or unseen, as embitter the heart of travel with unavailing regret for the impossibility of remembering them. I must leave for some visit of the reader's own the large and little facts of the many chapels in the cathedral at Burgos, and I will try to overwhelm him with my sense of the whole mighty interior, the rich gloom, the Gothic exaltation, which I made such shift as I could to feel in the company of those picture-postal amateurs. It was like, say, a somber afternoon, verging to the twilight of a cloudy sunset, so that when I came out of it into the open noon it was like emerging into a clear morrow. Perhaps because I could there shed the harassing human environment the outside of the cathedral seemed to me the best of it, and we lingered there for a moment in glad relief.|$|E
30|$|In {{presence}} of an RN, the radio resources at the DeNB are shared between the backhaul link and the direct link. This happens {{in the context of}} both in-band and out-band modes of relay operation (as described later). A crucial task here is to decide on how the resources are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>shared,</b> i.e., how many resources should be assigned for backhaul transmission and how many should be used for the direct link.|$|R
5000|$|Martin Ferstl, {{chairman}} of Shell Oil in Kazakhstan, said that Shell invested $3 billion in Kazakhstan between 1993 and 2006.

6000|$|... "It is a nightmare!" [...] he groaned. [...] "Have {{you seen}} all those {{advertisements}} of brain foods? The advertisement columns of our {{magazines and newspapers}} are full of them.

30|$|We also assume perfect {{information}} on the destination chosen by immigrants: both countries know how many immigrants are willing to settle in C and how many immigrants are willing to settle in B. This assumption {{is by no means}} restrictive: since mobility within the federation is unrestrained, it only indicates that C and B know how the population inflow is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>shared.</b> Countries are usually well informed about their relative attractiveness for the immigrants.|$|R
