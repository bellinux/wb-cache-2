5|$|Despite being {{regarded}} {{by many as}} highly prestigious, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> that having an album nominated for or winning the Mercury Prize could be a curse on a career in music.|$|E
5|$|In astrobiology, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> that {{discrete}} vanadium accumulations on Mars {{could be}} a potential microbial biosignature, when {{used in conjunction with}} Raman spectroscopy and morphology.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> that Kettle Creek {{is named}} for kettles used by the Native Americans on the West Branch Susquehanna River.|$|E
50|$|Since {{construction}} of the array began, a few science goals not specifically drawn up for <b>it</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> {{that the}} man {{reported}} by eyewitnesses as jumping over the barrier may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> one of the police officers in pursuit.|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> that Ardzinba {{may have}} also favoured Gagulia to replace him as President, but Ardzinba instead decided to back then-Prime Minister Raul Khajimba.|$|R
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> that Ottawa {{speakers}} {{were among}} the groups that used the Great Lakes Algonquian syllabary, a syllabic writing system derived from a European-based alphabetic orthography, but supporting evidence is weak.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> that Schongauer's pupil Urbain Huter (1471–1501) {{may have}} been one of the authors but without any solid evidence.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> that {{brachytherapy}} {{may become}} a standard of treatment for skin cancer in the near future.|$|E
3000|$|... 17 Specifically trained labour {{became a}} quasi-fixed factor, as <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> in the {{pioneering}} work of Walter Oi in his doctoral dissertation (1962), which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> developed at Chicago.|$|R
50|$|Proposals {{made by the}} Home Secretary on 20 March 2006 saw Kent Police stay as a {{standalone}} strategic {{force for}} Kent and Medway; <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> that Kent should merge with another police force.|$|R
60|$|We <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{discussing}} {{the subject with}} reference to our hero. <b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> by Brown as an unhackneyed idea, and one lending itself, therefore, to comparative freshness of treatment, that our hero should be a thorough-paced scamp.|$|R
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> {{that the}} data leak could cost the law firm up to £500,000 in fines for {{breaching}} British Data Protection Laws.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> {{that the}} giant or {{waterfall}} swiftlet, Hydrochous gigas, which cannot echolocate, may be descended from an echolocating ancestor.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> {{that the}} {{original}} function of lactation (milk production) was to keep eggs moist. Much of the argument is based on monotremes, the egg-laying mammals.|$|E
50|$|A {{large family}} was {{reported}} with a phenotype indistinguishable from FSHD {{in which no}} pathological changes at the 4q site or translocation of 4q-10q <b>are</b> found. <b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> {{that this may be}} due to limitations in the available tests.|$|R
50|$|Tecophilaea {{was named}} for Tecophila Billotti, botanical artist and {{daughter}} of the Italian botanist Luigi Aloysius Colla of Turin, who found this plant in 1836, credited with publishing the genus name after <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> by Carlo Luigi Giuseppe Bertero.|$|R
60|$|He {{struggled}} with his indignation. Sylvia hated poverty, and <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> {{that he should}} turn the fact to his advantage. The idea {{that she might be}} more willing to marry him if she were poor was most unpleasant.|$|R
5|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} {{refers to a}} womanizing man. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> that the lyrics address Spears' ex-husband Kevin Federline.|$|E
5|$|Preventive {{detention}} {{has been}} preferred over open court trials, as <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> that {{the criminal trial}} {{could be used as}} a platform for radicals to publicize their views, and that it might confer the honour of martyrdom on accused persons. However, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> that an open trial which details the evils of terrorism and the indiscriminate destruction that it causes could educate the public and potentially unite the various communities in the country.|$|E
5|$|Adams' 1996 sequel, Tales from Watership Down {{includes}} stories {{where the}} female rabbits {{play a more}} prominent role in the Watership Down warren. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> that {{this might have been}} an attempt to modernise the story, to make it more in tune with the political sensibilities of the 1990s, when it was published.|$|E
60|$|Veronica {{admitted}} {{that in the}} qualities of a first-class hero he was wanting. Not till <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> {{to him that he}} must at heart be a cowardy cowardy custard <b>had</b> he <b>been</b> moved to take a hand in the enterprise.|$|R
50|$|The pyramid's {{purpose and}} exact origins <b>are</b> unknown. Though <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> that <b>it</b> may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{constructed}} by Roman legionaries involved in Egyptian cult practices, more recent research {{indicated that it}} was actually built between 1803 and 1812, i.e. during the rule of Napoleon Bonaparte.|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> {{early in}} the {{investigation}} that the accident was caused by inadvertent detonation of the Range Safety destruct charges on the external tank, but the charges were recovered mostly intact and a quick overview of telemetry data immediately ruled out that theory.|$|R
5|$|Due to the English Water Spaniel's colours {{of liver}} (tan) and white, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> that the breed {{may have been}} the source of the colours now found in the modern English Springer Spaniel and Welsh Springer Spaniel breeds.|$|E
5|$|Female Carolina wrens possess song control {{regions that}} {{would appear to}} make them capable of singing with {{repertoires}} like the male. Due to vocalizations that they occasionally make with the male, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> that song perception plays a role and is of behavioral relevance.|$|E
5|$|Fish do {{not possess}} {{parathyroid}} glands; several species {{have been found to}} express parathyroid hormone. Developmental genes and calcium-sensing receptors in fish gills are similar to those within the parathyroid glands of birds and mammals. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> that the tetrapod glands may have been evolutionarily derived from these fish gills.|$|E
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> {{that while}} the Raiders may <b>have</b> {{appeared}} to <b>be</b> the most likely candidate due to their lack of prospects in comparison with teams like the Chargers, their need for a solution may <b>have</b> actually <b>been</b> too urgent {{to be a viable}} option for London.|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> {{that the}} target of the murders may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> Sylvain Mollier, instead of the al-Hilli family. Later reports state that Mollier worked as a welder, without {{confidential}} nuclear information (security clearance is unclear), so he was not suspected as a likely target of such a murder.|$|R
50|$|After much {{development}} {{had taken}} place in the Arncliffe and Bardwell Park areas during the early 1900s, Bardwell Valley was the last remaining area with any significant cover of natural vegetation. As early as 1945, <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> that the area would be the ideal location for a golf course.|$|R
5|$|In 1994, Channel 4's Time Team {{undertook}} excavations on the Eastern Terrace. Their investigations revealed {{evidence of}} a medieval hall {{to the east of}} the castle; <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> that the hall was used as a dining area.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> that a {{proportionality}} analysis better safeguards equality {{compared to}} the American three-tiered scrutiny approach. The third limb of the proportionality test may also serve to strike down over-inclusive classifications which are currently tolerated under the rational nexus test.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> {{that life}} could {{exist in the}} lakes of liquid methane on Titan, just as organisms on Earth live in water. Such organisms would inhale H2 in place of O2, metabolize it with {{acetylene}} instead of glucose, and exhale methane instead of carbon dioxide.|$|E
5000|$|Bematists {{accompanied}} Alexander the Great on {{his campaign}} in Asia. Their measurements of the distances traveled by Alexanders army show {{a high degree of}} precision to the point that <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> that they must have used an odometer, although there is no direct mentioning of such a device: ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> that carbanion-sulfone double bonds {{will not}} show {{aromatic}} character-primarily {{as a result}} of the nodes present in d-orbitals. Straight chain analogs were chosen based on the comparable acidity, combined with previous studies indicating that steric effects are largely negligible. The straight chain analogs are shown below.|$|R
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>has</b> also <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> that erlotinib {{can cause}} hearing loss.|$|R
