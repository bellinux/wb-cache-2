40|$|In {{the present}} research, we {{assessed}} {{the utility of}} the structural information of drugs for predicting human in vivo intrinsic clearance from in vitro intrinsic clearance data obtained by human <b>hepatic</b> <b>microsome</b> experiment. To compare with the observed intrinsic clear-ance, human intrinsic clearance values for 51 drugs were estimated by the classical meth-ods using in vivo- in vitro scale-up and by the new methods using the in vitro experimen-tal data and selected molecular descriptors of drugs by the forward selection technique together. The results showed that taking consideration of molecular descriptors into pre-diction from in vitro experimental data could improve the prediction accuracy. The in vitro experiment is very useful when the data can estimate in vivo data accurately since it can reduce the cost of drug development. Improvement of prediction accuracy in the present approach can enhance the utility of in vitro data.

40|$|The N 4 -hydroxylation of {{sulfamethoxazole}} (SMX) to its hydroxylamine (SMX-HA) metabolite is {{the first}} step in the formation of reactive metabolites responsible for mediating hypersensitivity reactions associated with this compound. In rat <b>hepatic</b> <b>microsomes,</b> the NADPH-dependent oxidation of SMX to SMX-HA was increased 3 -fold by pretreatment of rats with phenobarbital. Other cytochrome P 450 (CYP) inducers were ineffective. The constitutive and induced SMX N-hydroxylation activities were inhibited by tolbutamide, and induction of SMX-HA activity paralleled the induction of progesterone 21 -hydroxylase activity, a marker for CYP 2 C 6. SMX N-hydroxylation in phenobarbital-treated rat <b>hepatic</b> <b>microsomes</b> was inhibited 70 % by anti-CYP 2 C 6 antisera. Thus, the N 4 -hydroxylation of SMX by rat <b>hepatic</b> <b>microsomes</b> was mediated by members of the CYP 2 C subfamily, probably CYP 2 C 6. In a panel of human microsomes, SMX-HA formation correlated with tolbutamide hydroxylase activity (r = 0. 75; p = 0. 01); CYP 2 C 9 content (r = 0. 79; p or = 1 microM inhibited the reduction of SMX-HA in human <b>hepatic</b> <b>microsomes</b> by 45 %, whereas sulfaphenazole had no effect.

40|$|In {{contrast}} to other metabolic functions, {{the role of}} dietary antioxidants and oil on microsomal lipid oxidation has been less extensively studied. This study examines ascorbate−Fe 2 + and NADPH-induced lipid peroxidation of <b>hepatic</b> <b>microsomes</b> of rats that were fed for three weeks high-oleic-acid oils (high-oleic sunflower oil, HOSO; olive oil, OO; or olive pomace oil, OPO) containing different concentrations of the antioxidants α-tocopherol, erythrodiol, and oleanolic acid. The fatty acid composition of <b>hepatic</b> <b>microsomes</b> of Wistar rats that were fed for three weeks with the above-mentioned oils had lower proportions of C 16 : 0, C 18 : 2 n 6, and C 22 : 6 n 3 and higher proportions of C 18 : 0 and C 18 : 1 n 9 than rats fed the control diet. Light emission by <b>hepatic</b> <b>microsomes</b> increased, in the first 180 min, 2 -fold after ascorbate-Fe 2 + addition compared with NADPH addition. Both increases were less pronounced in microsomes of OPO-fed rats and to a smaller extent in microsomes of OO-fed rats. Smaller increases in light emission were associated positively with higher concentrations of dietary α-tocopherol, erythrodiol, and oleanolic acid but were not associated with changes in fatty acid composition of <b>hepatic</b> <b>microsomes.</b> Addition of α-tocopherol, erythrodiol, or oleanolic acid decreased light emission of <b>hepatic</b> <b>microsomes</b> with a greater inhibition in microsomes of rats fed the control diet.

40|$|The {{basis for}} the species {{difference}} between B 6 C 3 F 1 mice (susceptible) and Fischer 344 rats (resistant) to 4 - vinylcyclohexene (VcH) -induced ovarian tumorigenicity was investigated. Greater than 95 % of a single oral 400 mg/kg dose of [¹⁴C]VCH was eliminated in 48 hr by mice and rats. Approximately 50 - 60 % of the administered dose was excreted in the urine, while the remaining 30 - 40 % of the dose was expired as organically soluble radioactivity. VCH-treated mice had dramatically higher blood concentrations of the VCH metabolite VCH- 1, 2 -epoxide compared to VCH-treated rats. Furthermore, mouse <b>hepatic</b> <b>microsomes</b> catalyzed the conversion of VCH to VCH- 1, 2 -epoxide at greater rates than rat <b>hepatic</b> <b>microsomes.</b> The destruction of oocytes {{was used as an}} index of ovarian toxicity to compare the potency of VCH and VCH epoxides in the mouse and rat. VCH markedly reduced the number of small oocytes in mice while no detectable change in oocyte number occurred in rats. Epoxide metabolites of VCH destroyed oocytes in both species at lower doses than VCH. Inhibition of VCH epoxidation reduced VCH- 1, 2 -epoxide blood levels and partially protected mice from VCH-induced ovarian toxicity. Thus, the conversion of VCH to epoxides and the subsequent destruction of oocytes are critical steps in the induction of ovarian tumors by VCH. Rats may be resistant because the amount of VCH converted to epoxides is insufficient to destroy oocytes. The biochemical {{basis for the}} species difference in the rate of VCH epoxidation by <b>hepatic</b> <b>microsomes</b> from mice and rats was investigated. studies using inducers and inhibitors of certain cytochrome(s) P 450 showed that <b>hepatic</b> <b>microsomes</b> of female mice perform VCH epoxidation at greater rates than rats because of the constitutive expression of P 450 IIA and lIB forms. <b>Hepatic</b> <b>microsomes</b> of human females perform VCH epoxidation at lower rates than rats.

Female Cynomolgus monkeys were daily administered PCBs (5 mg), PCQs (5 mg) or a mixture (Mix- 2) containing 5 mg PCBs + 20 micrograms PCDFs for 20 weeks. The PCBs, and PCDFs had the components of PCBs, PCQs and PCDFs similar to those contained in Japanese yusho oils, respectively. The PCB-treated rats and monkeys showed hepatic hypertrophy, immunosuppression and increased drug-metabolizing enzyme activities in hepatic microsomes, but were devoid of the dermal symptoms characteristic of yusho. PCQs caused an increase in drug-metabolizing enzyme activities in hepatic microsomes and immunosuppression in monkeys, but these effects were much smaller than those found with PCBs treatment.

We {{examined the}} effects of ozagrel, a selective thromboxane A 2 (TXA 2) synthase inhibitor, on liver injury induced by APAP overdose in mice. Methods Hepatotoxicity was induced to ICR male mice by an intraperitoneal injection with APAP (330 mg/kg). The effects of ozagrel (200 mg/kg) treatment 30 min after the APAP injection were evaluated with mortality, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and hepatic changes, including histopathology, DNA fragmentation, mRNA expression and total glutathione contents. The impact of ozagrel (0. 001 - 1 mg/mL) on cytochrome P 450 2 E 1 (CYP 2 E 1) activity in mouse <b>hepatic</b> <b>microsome</b> was examined. RLC- 16 cells, a rat hepatocytes cell line, were exposed to 0. 25 mM N-acetyl -p- benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), a hepatotoxic metabolite of APAP. In this model, the cytoprotective effects of ozagrel (1 – 100 muM) were evaluated by the WST- 1 cell viability assay. Results Ozagel treatment significantly attenuated higher mortality, elevated serum alanine aminotransferase levels, excessive hepatic centrilobular necrosis, hemorrhaging and DNA fragmentation, as well as increase in plasma 2, 3 -dinor thromboxane B 2 levels induced by APAP injection. Ozagrel also inhibited the hepatic expression of cell death-related mRNAs induced by APAP, such as jun oncogene, FBJ osteosarcoma oncogene (fos) and C/EBP homologous protein (chop), but did not suppress B-cell lymphoma 2 -like protein 11 (bim) expression and hepatic total glutathione depletion. These results show ozagrel can inhibit not all hepatic changes but can reduce the hepatic necrosis. Ozagrel had little impact on CYP 2 E 1 activity involving the NAPQI production. In addition, ozagrel significantly attenuated cell injury induced by NAPQI in RLC- 16. Conclusions We demonstrate that the TXA 2 synthase inhibitor, ozagrel, dramatically alleviates liver injury induced by APAP in mice, and suggest that it is a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of APAP-induced liver injury. </p...|$|E
40|$|Carbon {{tetrachloride}} {{has been}} used extensively within the DOE nuclear weapons facilities. Rocky Flats was formerly the largest volume consumer of CCl 4 in the United States using 5000 gallons in 1977 alone (Ripple, 1992). At the Hanford site, several hundred thousand gallons of CCl 4 were discharged between 1955 and 1973 into underground cribs for storage. Levels of CCl 4 in groundwater at highly contaminated sites at the Hanford facility have exceeded 8 the drinking water standard of 5 ppb by several orders of magnitude (Illman, 1993). High levels of CCl 4 at these facilities represent a potential health hazard for workers conducting cleanup operations and for surrounding communities. The level of CCl 4 cleanup required at these sites and associated costs are driven by current human health risk estimates, which assume that CCl 4 is a genotoxic carcinogen. The overall purpose of these studies was to improve the scientific basis for assessing the health risk associated with human exposure to CCl 4. Specific research objectives of this project were to: (1) compare the rates of CCl 4 metabolism by rats, mice and hamsters in vivo and extrapolate those rates to man based on parallel studies on the metabolism of CCl 4 by rat, mouse, hamster and human hepatic microsomes in vitro; (2) using <b>hepatic</b> <b>microsome</b> preparations, determine the role of specific cytochrome P 450 isoforms in CCl 4 -mediated toxicity {{and the effects of}} repeated inhalation and ingestion of CCl 4 on these isoforms; and (3) evaluate the toxicokinetics of inhaled CCl 4 in rats, mice and hamsters.

In combination, the studies were intended to provide the exact types of information needed to enable refined cancer risk estimates for CCl 4 under the new EPA guidelines for risk assessment...|$|E

30|$|Although M 6 G (7) {{and some}} of its O-glycosides present {{significantly}} greater analgesic potency than morphine (1), the bioavailability of these compounds could be a problem for a useful drug. For instance, the oral bioavailability of M 6 G is only 11  % and improvement of chemical and metabolic stability of M 6 G could possibly increase its effectiveness as a potential drug. Limited hydrophilicity has been a major problem in most of the cases for morphine sugar derivatives making obstacles to be used in clinic. However, examples are known which are in Clinical trials e.g. M 6 G is being developed by CeNeS (Cambridge, UK) as a treatment for postoperative pain, and is currently undergoing phase III trials in Europe, with phase III clinical trials in the USA expected to commence in 2007 [39]. A general strategy for improving in vivo metabolic stability of glycoconjugates involves the replacement of glycosidic oxygen atom by carbon, nitrogen, or sulfur atoms. Indeed, MacDougall and coworkers have developed a new series of sulfur (24 a, 24 b, 25 a and 25 c) and carbon (26 and 27) glycosides (Fig.  1). The results from this research indicate some compounds with metabolic stability for sustained pharmacological activity [4, 19]. Compounds 24 a and 24 b were full μ receptor agonists, whereas compounds 25 a and 25 c were only partial agonists. This finding indicates that the presence of a hydrogen atom (as a hydrogen bound donor) or a carboxyl group at C- 6 ′ in sugar moiety is not a requirement for agonist activity of these analogues. Moreover, analogue 27 and its deprotected sugar congener 26 were both μ receptor selective [19]. Compound 27 (ki =  0.5 nM) presented an affinity to μ opioid receptor 26 -fold higher than that observed for M 6 G. Selectivities of compound 27 for μ versus δ and μ versus κ receptors were tenfold and 34 -fold, respectively. Higher potency was also observed for 26 (3.7 -fold) in comparison with M 6 G. Selectivity of compound 26 for μ versus δ and μ versus κ receptors were 77 -fold and 166 -fold, respectively. This compound showed slightly greater potency towards μ receptor (2.5 -fold) over M 6 G (8) when compared to thiosaccharides 25 a and 25 c (around 1.6 -fold) [19]. In addition, compound 26 presented considerable metabolic stability when assayed <b>hepatic</b> <b>microsome</b> preparations from rat and monkey. No detectable loss of 26 was observed during 90  min of system incubation. Compound 26 was also very stable at pH 2 or pH 7.4.|$|E

40|$|Lithocholic acid is a lipid-soluble hepatotoxic {{bile acid}} that accu-mulates {{in the liver}} during cholestasis. A {{potential}} detoxification pathway for lithocholic acid involves hydroxylation by hepatic cy-tochrome P 450 (P 450) enzymes. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to identify the hepatic microsomal metabolites of lithocholic acid by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry and to deter-mine the P 450 enzymes involved. Incubation of lithocholic acid with rat <b>hepatic</b> <b>microsomes</b> and NADPH produced murideoxy-cholic acid (MDCA), isolithocholic acid (ILCA), and 3 -keto- 5 -cholanic acid (3 KCA) as major metabolites and 6 -ketolithocholic acid and ursodeoxycholic acid as minor metabolites. Experiments with <b>hepatic</b> <b>microsomes</b> prepared from rats pretreated with P 450 inducers and with inhibitory antibodies indicated that CYP 2 C and CYP 3 A enzymes contribute to microsomal MDCA formation.

40|$|A single {{application}} of crude coal tar (CCT) solution (USP) {{to the skin}} of neonatal rats was shown to induce epidermal and hepatic cytochrome P- 450 (P- 450) -dependent monooxygenase activities. To further characterize the induction response, {{in this study we}} have utilized highly specific monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) 1 - 7 - 1, 2 - 66 - 3, and 1 - 98 - 1 directed against highly purified rat liver P- 450 s induced by 3 -methylcholanthrene, phenobarbital and ethanol, respectively. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of <b>hepatic</b> <b>microsomes</b> prepared from CCT-treated animals showed {{a significant increase in the}} commassie blue stainable proteins in the P- 450 region; however, this was not evident in epidermal microsomes. Immunoblot analysis of epidermal and <b>hepatic</b> <b>microsomes</b> with MoAb 1 - 7 - 1 revealed strong immunoprecipitin brands in both tissues. MoAb 2 - 66 - 3 showed significant immunoreactivity only with <b>hepatic</b> <b>microsomes.</b> Interestingly, CCT treatment resulted in suppression of immunoreactivity with MoAb 1 - 98 - 1 in <b>hepatic</b> <b>microsomes.</b> MoAb 1 - 7 - 1 and 2 - 66 - 3 exhibited concentration-dependent inhibitory effects in aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase and 7 -ethoxycoumarin-O-deethylase activities induced by CCT application. MoAb 1 - 7 - 1 was substantially more effective in this respect. Epidermal and hepatic mocrosomes prepared from CCT-treated rats showed significantly greater metabolism of benzo(a) pyrene (BP). MoAb 1 - 7 - 1 and MoAb 2 - 66 - 3 inhibited BP metabolism in both the tissues. However, MoAb 1 - 7 - 1 was more inhibitory in this regard as compared to MoAb 2 - 66 - 3. These studies indicate that topical {{application of}} therapeutic CCT to the skin of neonatal rats results in induction of P- 450 isozyme c in epidermis and isozymes b and c in liver, and that this induction is associated with the suppression of P- 450 isozyme J in liver...|$|R

40|$|Aldicarb (ALD) {{metabolism}} was {{studied in}} vitro using <b>hepatic</b> <b>microsomes</b> from chickens, rabbits, sheep and pigs. The microsomal activities of mono-ooxygenase enzymes (flavin-containing and cytochrome P- 450 -dependent mixed function oxygenases) were compared {{by measuring the}} quantity of the 2 oxidized metabolites, ALD sulfoxide and ALD sulfone, produced during 60 min of incubation. Pig microsomes produced the greatest quantity of ALD sulfoxide and the lowest quantity of ALD sulfone; the latter being produced in greater quantities in sheep than in chickens and rabbits. Aldicarb and its metabolites were degraded fastest in rabbits, probably by hydrolytic reactions. These in vitro results, which are consistent both with the levels of cytochrome P 450 found in <b>hepatic</b> <b>microsomes</b> and previous in vivo data on ALD kinetics in pigs, rabbits and chickens, indicate that preliminary in vitro studies can limit the necessary use of animals for drug metabolism experiments.

40|$|Ethylene (ET) is metabolized in mammals to the {{carcinogenic}} {{ethylene oxide}} (EO). Although both gases are of high industrial relevance, only limited data {{exist on the}} toxicokinetics of ET in mice and of EO in humans. Metabolism of ET is related to cytochrome P 450 -dependent mono-oxygenase (CYP) and of EO to epoxide hydrolase (EH) and glutathione S-transferase (GST). Kinetics of ET metabolism to EO and of elimination of EO were investigated in headspace vessels containing incubations of subcellular fractions of mouse, rat, or human liver or of mouse or rat lung. CYP-associated metabolism of ET and GST-related metabolism of EO were found in microsomes and cytosol, respectively, of each species. EH-related metabolism of EO was not detectable in <b>hepatic</b> <b>microsomes</b> of rats and mice but obeyed saturation kinetics in <b>hepatic</b> <b>microsomes</b> of humans.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{inducing}} agents and inhibitors on the cytochrome P- 450 -catalyzed oxidations of butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) to form three metabolites were investigated with liver and lung microsomes from rats and mice. These compounds, the quinone methide (QM) formed by two-electron oxidation of BHT, the hydroxy-tert-butyl an-alog of BHT (BHT-OH) resulting from aliphatic hydroxylation, and the hydroxy-quinone methide (QM-OH) derived from BHT-OH, have been implicated previously as intermediates or products involved in BHT bioactivation and toxicity. Although {{there was little}} or no increase in BHT metabolism in pulmonary microsomes from either species fol-lowing phenobarbital (PB) administration, 6 - to 37 -fold enhance-ments occurred in the transformation of BHT to OM, and the conver-sion of BHT-OH to QM-OH with <b>hepatic</b> <b>microsomes</b> from both spe-cies.

40|$|A {{simple and}} {{sensitive}} method {{was developed to}} separate the carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), and six of its oxidation metabolites generated by rat <b>hepatic</b> <b>microsomes</b> enriched with cytochrome P 450 (CYP) 1 A 1, by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). The HPLC method, using an acetonitrile/water gradient as mobile phase and UV detection, provided appropriate separation and detection of both mono- and di-hydroxylated metabolites of BaP as well as BaP diones formed by rat <b>hepatic</b> <b>microsomes</b> and the parental BaP. In this enzymatic system, 3 -hydroxy BaP, 9 -hydroxy BaP, BaP- 4, 5 -dihydrodiol, BaP- 7, 8 -dihydrodiol, BaP- 9, 10 -dihydrodiol and BaP-dione were generated. Among them the mono-hydroxylated BaP metabolite, 3 -hydroxy BaP followed by di-hydroxylated BaP products, BaP- 7, 8 -dihydrodiol and BaP- 9, 10 -dihydrodiol, predominated, while BaP-dione was a minor metabolite.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{suggested}} a relationship between cytochrome P 450 (P 450) 3 A (CYP 3 A) conformation and the phospholipid composition of the associated membrane. In this study, we utilized a novel microsomal incubation system that mimics many {{of the characteristics of}} CYP 3 A degradation pathway that have been observed in vivo and in cultured cells to study the effects of phospholipid composition on protein stability. We found that addition of phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase D (PLD) stabilized CYP 3 A in this system,but thatphosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C(PLC) was withouteffect. AdditionofphosphatidicacidalsostabilizedCYP 3 A protein in the microsomes. The use of 1, 10 -phenanthroline (phenanthroline), an inhibitor of PLD activity, decreased CYP 3 A stability in incubated microsomes. Similarly, 6 -h treatment of primary cultures of rat hepatocytes with phenanthroline resulted in nearly complete loss of CYP 3 Aprotein.
