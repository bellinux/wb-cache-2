The Author used a method consiting of describing the purpouses of traditional elements of those security instruments, which are broken and modified by the provisions enabling agreements on <b>financial</b> <b>collateral</b> {{in the first part}} of the thesis, and further applied the purposes to the provisions enabeling the agreements on <b>financial</b> <b>collateral</b> itself in the second part of this thesis. As to the additional method of approach, the author judged this security instrument from the point of values and principles, which are the most reflected in its provisions. Author implied that the specifics of an agreement on <b>financial</b> <b>collateral</b> consist in vast differences from the traditional security instruments. These differences lie in the area of formation of such security instrument, the area of rights and duties of the contracting parties during the existence of the <b>financial</b> <b>collateral,</b> as well as the possibilities of the satisfaction of the creditor from the collateral. Author's conclusions may be summarized by the following. Agreements on <b>financial</b> <b>collateral</b> are characteristic by high extent of application of the [...] ...|$|R

It focuses on the legal questions link to the international element. <b>Financial</b> <b>collateral</b> arrangements typically occur in securities repurchase and securities lending. These transactions play important role in order to guarantee liquidity cash and proper functioning of capital markets in the European Union. Simultaneously, securities are no longer only of a tangible goods nature; instead they exists as electronic records in securities accounts. This is why conflicts of law issues have become so paramount. This study analyses the approach of Czech law to <b>financial</b> <b>collateral</b> arrangements. In particular, if the collateral is represented by a book-entry share, bond or fund unit. It pays attention to such a matter from the national as well as the harmonised EU perspective. On an EU level, such arrangements are primarily regulated by the Collateral Directive (FCAD).

This paper aims at assessing these effects throught the modelling {{of the impact}} of C&G on credit spreads. In doing this we assume the perspective of a bank adopting a Foundation Internal Rating Based approach to measure credit risk and we apply a comparative-static analysis to a pricing model, based on the intrinsic value pricing approach as in the loan arbitrage-free pricing model (LAFP) suggested by Dermine (1996). Our results show that <b>financial</b> <b>collaterals</b> are more effective than guarantees in reducing credit spreads, this differential impact becoming greater as the borrower’s rating worsen. Moreover, the effects of C&G on credit spreads can be more effective than an improvement of borrower’s rating, this possibly leading to negative outfits on credit industries’ allocative efficiency...|$|R
40|$|Key points - The recent {{decision}} of the High Court of the British Virgin Islands in Alfa v Cukurova has caused a stir among lawyers serving the international financial markets based in London. - The decision concerns the meaning of ‘appropriation’. Appropriation is a new remedy for collateral takers introduced by the <b>Financial</b> <b>Collateral</b> Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003, which implement the <b>Financial</b> <b>Collateral</b> Directive. - The decision holds that effective appropriation requires the collateral taker to take over from the collateral giver the {{ability to deal with}} the collateral as its own. - In Cukurova, where an equitable mortgage was taken over directly held shares, this required that the collateral taker become the registered owner of the shares. - The decision was appealed to the BVI Court of Appeal in late January 2008 and may go further. In the meantime, this article provides an overview of the decision and considers its wider significance...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{establishment}} of the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh in 1976, microfinance has boomed. As of December 31, 2007, 3, 552 microcredit institutions had reached 154 million clients worldwide, about 106. 6 million of whom were among the poorest when they took their first loan. Such expansion can be at least partly attributed to the widely adopted practice of group lending in microfinance programs. In contrast to individual lending, group lending (or joint liability) grants a loan to a group of borrowers, and the whole group is liable for the debt of any individual member in the group. This practice allows microfinance programs to rely mainly on accountability and mutual trust among group members rather than <b>financial</b> <b>collateral</b> to insure against default. Given that the poor often lack appropriate <b>financial</b> <b>collateral,</b> group lending programs offer a feasible way of extending credit to poor people who are usually kept out of traditional banking systems.

Therefore, {{the implementation of the}} Directive in the Italian legal system has created a specific area – related to <b>financial</b> <b>collateral</b> – in which the prohibition of patto commissorio is ineffective. Furthermore, this European regulation is the expression of a trend favouring self-help remedies for the creditor, who can – if the debt is not paid – sell or appropriate the collateral, subject to the condition that he will give the debtor the difference between the price obtained (or the value of the collateral) and the amount of the debt. The challenge for the Italian doctrine shall therefore be to examine whether the above self-help remedies could be granted in every case in which the value of the collateral can be determined according to objective criteria, such as whether the collateral consists of currency, receivables or financial instruments negotiable in the market...|$|R
