This reduces disk head movement resulting from a page file that is fragmented or located on the hard drive far from other frequently used files. However, the program recommends -- and indeed it is indispensable -- that the user make a backup (which should be a full partition backup, not just data backup) of any drive on which boot level defragmentation is attempted. If the program fails during boot level relocation of critical files such as $MFT, portions of the file structure may be damaged and the computer might no longer boot properly to the <b>desktop</b> <b>screen.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{growth in}} mobile and {{associated}} platforms and services (e.g.: Mobile gaming has experienced 20x growth in 2010-2012) has generated {{a need for}} unmoderated remote usability testing on mobile devices, both for websites but especially for app interactions. One methodology consists of shipping cameras and special camera holding fixtures to dedicated testers, and having them record the screens of the mobile smart-phone or tablet device, usually using an HD camera. A drawback {{of this approach is}} that the finger movements of the respondent can obscure the view of the screen, in addition to the bias and logistical issues inherent in shipping special hardware to selected respondents. A newer approach uses a wireless projection of the mobile device screen onto the computer <b>desktop</b> <b>screen</b> of the respondent, who can then be recorded through their webcam, and thus a combined Video-in-Video view of the participant and the screen interactions viewed simultaneously while incorporating the verbal think aloud commentary of the respondents.|$|E

50|$|With {{the growing}} use of smartphones, tablets, and <b>desktop</b> <b>screen</b> reading, major {{publishers}} begun releasing comics, graphic novels and Manga in digital formats. Declining sales and copyright violation have led some publishers {{to find new}} ways to publish their comics, while others are just adapting to the digital age while still having great success with the printed comic format. American publishers' attempts at creating digital publishing platforms for local comics and Manga have thus far been more successful than attempts with digital Manga publishing in Japan, which have lacked a coherent strategy to create successful digital platforms in which to publish, and had revenue considerations from the impact of illegal scanlation. Some attempts in Japan have been made, but failed, such as JManga; while others merged with larger worldwide distributors as in the case of Square Enix digital publishing joining the Hachette Book Group for distribution in over 200 countries. Some western notable platforms such as Graphicly have closed down due to the creators getting hired by the self-publishing platform Blurb.|$|E

The research objective of this study focused on the opacity of the PIP video that is often displayed along with the <b>desktop</b> <b>screen</b> capture. A total of 16 undergraduate evaluators were used, with 8 having no experience and 8 having 20 hours of experience from an advanced human-computer interaction course. In addition, 6 usability practitioners were used to compare to undergraduate experiences. Eye tracking was used to determine the attentional focus of evaluators. Results showed that opacity levels of the PIP video did not influence the number of usability problems found for all three groups. All evaluators did focus more on the higher opacity PIP video, but this did not appear to influence their evaluation...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} a multi-user interactive installation featuring real time animated creatures and a mobile interaction paradigm. This paradigm {{has been designed}} to serve as a platform for education in a variety of content domains. Drawing on previous research in mobile computing and animated educational systems, this project contributes a novel metaphor for interactions among real and virtual creatures and worlds. This “Land/Water ” metaphor offers that virtual space is like land for virtual creatures, and real space is like water for them. The interaction paradigm involves groups of animated creatures that live on <b>desktop</b> <b>screens,</b> and may be transported from screen to screen by means of mobile Tablet PCs carried by human participants. This paper presents a working implementation of this paradigm and describes its use as an educational tool...|$|R

The aim is to provide users a mechanism to quickly identify interesting nodes for further analysis. Fuzzy logic allows a flexible framework to ask human-like curiosity-driven questions over the data, and visualisation allows its communication and understanding. Together, these two technologies successfully empower novices and experts to a faster and {{deeper understanding of the}} underlying patterns in big datasets compared to traditional means in a <b>desktop</b> <b>screen</b> with crisp queries. Among other examples, we provide evidence of how these two technologies successfully enable the identification of relevant transaction patterns in the Bitcoin network...|$|E
40|$|Digital design tools provide several {{advantages}} over pen and paper, including a virtually unlimited workspace and easy design storage, transportation, duplication and access. However, {{the benefits of}} new tools are limited by the physical interfaces {{that are used to}} interact with them. In this paper, we describe and conduct an exploratory study designed to illuminate strengths and weaknesses of three digital sketching interfaces: Separated Overview+Detail (two standard desktop screens), Separated Focus+Context (one standard <b>desktop</b> <b>screen</b> with one large screen), and Single Large-Screen. The experimental tasks focus on the domain of early sketching and prototyping. Users performed one of three tasks on all three displays. Our results suggest that the Focus+Context system elicits higher user satisfaction, and possibly incurs fewer costs on perception resources and performance. Given the exploratory nature of this study, we close with suggestions for further research directions...|$|E
40|$|There is a {{dramatic}} increase in the population who use mobile computing devices. Though the hardware becomes more powerful, effective support for information rendering on small screens very much lags behind. To display hierarchical information, researchers have proposed many algorithms for <b>desktop</b> <b>screen</b> visualization. Such algorithms are generally divided into connection and enclosure. Connection approach displays hierarchy with a clear structure but consume display area. Enclosure can maximally utilize the screen space but the layout is essentially implicit. This paper describes a new Radial Edgeless Tree (RELT) for visualizing hierarchical data on palmsized devices. The aim of RELT is to combine the advantages of connection and enclosure approaches. By recursively partitioning the display area, this technique maximizes the space usage. The structural clarity of layout can be reached by arranging location of non-overlapping regions. RELT can be adapted for visualizing structural information for various applications...|$|E

These occur especially in the study of geology, chemistry, biology and so on. Tapping the technology will soon become critical career training for future generations. Teaching through mobile is more interactive and helps students to grasp quickly. In this thesis an interactive mobile tool is developed which explains about the causes and distribution of natural disasters like Earthquakes, Tsunami, Tropical Cyclones, Volcanic Eruptions and Tornadoes. The application shows the places of disasters on an interactive map and it also contains YouTube embedded videos, which explain the disasters visually. The advantage of this tool is, it can be deployed onto major mobile operating systems like Android and IOS.

50|$|LED {{backlighting}} {{in color}} screens comes in two varieties: white LED backlights and RGB LED backlights. White LEDs are used {{most often in}} notebooks and <b>desktop</b> <b>screens,</b> and make up virtually all mobile LCD screens. A white LED is typically a blue LED with broad spectrum yellow phosphor to result in the emission of white light. However, because the spectral curve peaks at yellow, it is a poor match to the transmission peaks of the red and green color filters of the LCD. This causes the red and green primaries to shift toward yellow, reducing the color gamut of the display. RGB LEDs consist of a red, a blue, and a green LED and can be controlled to produce different color temperatures of white. RGB LEDs for backlighting are found in high end color proofing displays such as the HP DreamColor LP2480zx monitor or selected HP EliteBook notebooks, {{as well as more}} recent consumer-grade displays such as Dell's Studio series laptops which have an optional RGB LED display.|$|R
