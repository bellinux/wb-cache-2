50|$|The buyer, Denver oilman and gun {{collector}} John J. King, commenced {{an action}} {{in federal court}} in May 1965 for the recovery of the weapons from possession of the U.S. government. In response, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Division of the Internal Revenue Service began an <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> <b>forfeiture</b> proceeding against the rifle and the pistol. The U.S. District Court held that Oswald had used fictitious names when purchasing the weapons, in violation of the Federal Firearms Act of 1938, which allowed for immediate seizure and forfeiture of any such illegally obtained weapons.|$|E
50|$|The {{form of the}} styling of this case—the {{defendant}} {{being an}} object, rather than a legal person—is {{because this is a}} jurisdiction in rem (power over objects) case, rather than the more familiar in personam (over persons) case. In current US legal practice, in rem is most widely used in the area of asset forfeiture, frequently in relation to controlled substances offenses. <b>In</b> <b>rem</b> <b>forfeiture</b> cases allow property (in this case, $124,700 in cash) to be directly sued by and forfeited to the government, without either just compensation or the possessor (and presumptive owner) being convicted of a crime.|$|E
40|$|United States civil {{forfeiture}} laws {{are rooted in}} admiralty <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> <b>forfeiture</b> proceedings that go back to mid- 1700 s English customs law, and a statute called the Act of Frauds. The procedure was born {{of the necessity of}} international marine trade. Similarly, when it came to using in rem seizure to enforce the customs laws, the Crown used a burden shifting presumption that was also born of necessity. Vessel owners were required to come forward and exculpate their vessel once the Crown showed probable cause of a violation. In Locke v. United States, Justice Marshall upheld that burden shifting presumption and the definition of probable cause in the admiralty in rem seizure context as a showing of reasonable suspicion, something less than a prima facie case. Sixty years later, however, the United States courts would begin to uphold uses of <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> <b>forfeiture</b> outside of the context of customs law, and today, statutory forfeiture provisions are constitutional scholars question whether or not {{civil forfeiture}} proceedings, having entered the law in the narrow context of admiralty <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> <b>forfeiture</b> proceedings, do an end run around the Fourth Amendment and Due Process. The Locke Court never heard or considered any constitutional argument...|$|E

Paladini claimed that they were for his own personal use, and he challenged the asset forfeiture proceedings as Luros had before him.

50|$|Richard Lyle Austin {{was indicted}} for violating South Dakota’s drug laws.

The United States then filed an <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> action, seeking <b>forfeiture</b> of Austin’s mobile home and auto body shop under federal statutes that provide for forfeiture of property that is used or intended for use to facilitate the transportation of controlled substances, or related materials. Austin argued that forfeiture of his property would violate the Eighth Amendment’s Excessive Fines Clause.|$|R

Michigan is then introduced and analyzed, highlighting the Court’s inconsistent reasoning in upholding the forfeiture in Bennis despite its holding in Austin, which was decided only three years earlier. Finally, this Note proposes a threshold test for application of the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment...|$|E

The Eighth Amendment, although historically applied to criminal prosecutions and 2 ̆ 2 direct actions initiated by government to inflict punishment, 2 ̆ 2 has recently been held to apply in the civil arena as well. In Austin v.

40|$|Although {{the legal}} fictions of {{coverture}} and guilty property have been repudiated by statutes and the Court respectively, the Supreme Court implicitly resurrected and fused the coverture and guilty property myths in Bennis v.

This Article explores that resurrected conglomerate in three parts. Part I is a concise review of the feudal doctrine of coverture and the disabilities it imposed on married women. Part II focuses almost entirely on the decision in Austin, in which the Supreme Court held that the Eighth Amendment 2 ̆ 7 s Excessive Fines Clause applies to <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> <b>forfeiture</b> proceedings.

40|$|This Article closely {{examines}} the rationale offered {{for the new}} quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> jurisdiction, and concludes that it cannot withstand careful analysis. Courts have explained that the new theory of quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> jurisdiction is necessary to fill gaps in the state 2 ̆ 7 s long arm statute. However, gaps in a long arm statute can be filled by legislative amendments which can provide in personam jurisdiction up to the full extent permitted by due process. In fact, long arm statutes have steadily expanded {{over the last decade}} to take up the slack left by Shaffer. In personam jurisdiction under a long arm statute is far preferable to the new quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> jurisdiction. Indeed, given its reliance on attachment, its limited res judicata effect, and its vague and uncertain standards, the new quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> jurisdiction may very well be unconstitutional and is surely bad policy. Moreover, {{the manner in which the}} new quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> jurisdiction has been unilaterally forged by courts violates separation of powers. This Article argues, therefore, that state courts should not succumb to the temptation to embrace the new quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> jurisdiction, and that it should be repudiated in New York and the other states that follow it. This Article is divided into three parts. Part I discusses the development of quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> jurisdiction, and {{examines the}} Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s decision in Shaffer. Part II surveys the use of quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> jurisdiction <b>in</b> the states since Shaffer. It traces and analyzes the growth of the new quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> jurisdiction doctrine, considers the causes of this development, and contrasts the new doctrine with the developments in the large majority of states that have not used quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> jurisdiction since Shaffer. Part III considers the contemporary validity of quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> jurisdiction, and demonstrates that it is no longer a valid jurisdictional device. The Article concludes that the new quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> jurisdiction threatens to resuscitate a doctrine that, after honorable service, deserves retirement...|$|R

40|$|The Scoring System for Latent Structure (SSLS) {{was used}} to test three {{hypotheses}} regarding the degree of self-participation in dreams reported during sleep onset (SO) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.

None of these hypotheses was confirmed.

50|$|Three {{types of}} {{jurisdiction}} developed, collectively termed territorial jurisdiction {{because of their}} reliance upon territorial control: in personam jurisdiction, <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> jurisdiction, and quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> jurisdiction.

5000|$|On June 24, 1977, in {{the case}} of Shaffer v.

The Supreme Court significantly diminished the utility of the quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> jurisdiction because if the case meets the minimum contacts, fair play and substantial justice tests, the action can be brought under the in personam jurisdiction. Quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> jurisdiction, however, can still be an effective option to bring the lawsuit to a particular court because quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> jurisdiction allows to overcome limitations of the long-arm statute of a particular state.|$|R
5000|$|A quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> {{legal action}} (Latin, [...] "as if against a thing") {{is a legal}} action based on {{property}} rights of a person absent from the jurisdiction.

Since an actual tract of land could not literally be brought into a courtroom as a person could, this was effected by giving notice upon the real property itself. <b>In</b> <b>rem</b> jurisdiction was thus supported by {{the assumption that the}} owner of that property, having a concrete economic interest in the property, had a duty to look after the affairs of their property, and would be notified of the pending case by such seizure. <b>In</b> <b>rem</b> jurisdiction was limited to deciding issues regarding the specific property in question.|$|R
