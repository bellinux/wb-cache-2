However, some gap exists in the current literature with respect to the elaboration of composite indicators for regional innovation systems (RISs) of developing countries. This article introduces the composite indicators GRIS and GCLS for measuring the regional <b>innovative</b> <b>capacities</b> (for GNUTS 1 and GNUTS 2 territorial classification levels, respectively). Georgia is a useful case-subject because its smallscale developing economy presents special challenges for elaborating the composite indicators for RISs.

40|$|ECAICI {{indicator}} {{introduced in}} the present article enables to analyze <b>innovative</b> <b>capacities</b> dynamics of the ECA region (by The World Bank classification) countries in 1996 - 2010. Thorough research reveals four leading unobservable factors, affecting innovative processes in ECA region. These factors may be referred as Knowledge creation, Economy sophistication, Knowlege Absorption-Diffusion, Human Capital Production. We {{show that there is}} a close link between ECAICI indicator and other well-known innovation indicators and show also that there is a close link between ECAICI indicator and GDP per capita. Indicator ECAICI may be applied as an instrument for <b>innovative</b> <b>capacities</b> assessment and analysis. Presented brief analysis of current <b>innovative</b> <b>capacities</b> of Georgia, carried out by means of this indicator serves as illustration of the fact.

40|$|In this {{conceptual}} article, we extend {{earlier work}} on Open Innovation and Absorptive Capacity. We {{suggest that the}} literature on Abosrptive Capacity does not place sufficient emphasis on distributed knowledge and learning or on the application of innovative knowledge. To accomplish physical transformations, organisations need specific <b>Innovative</b> <b>Capacities</b> that extend beyond knowledge management. Accessive Capacity {{is the ability to}} collect, sort and analyse knwoledge from both internal and external sources. Adaptive Capacity is needed to ensure that new pieces of equipment are suitable for the organisation's own purposes even though they may have been originally developed for other uses. Integrative Capacity makes it possible for a new or modified piece of equipment to be fitted into an existing production process with a minimum of inessential and expensive adjustments elsewhere in the process.

Using a large dataset of industrial firms in 31 provinces in the People's Republic of China, we find that credit market development enhances firms' product innovation incentives and outcomes. We further show that firms' credit constraints and firms' performances are two channels through which credit market development affects <b>innovative</b> <b>capacities</b> of firms. Our results are neither driven by {{the increase in the}} quantity of credit, nor by {{the increase in the number}} of firms in a province.

50|$|The NEP {{recognizes the}} <b>innovative</b> <b>capacity</b> of humans, but says {{that humans are}} still ecologically interdependent as with other species.

The Earth has a finite level of natural resources and waste repositories. Thus, the biophysical environment can impose constraints on human activity. They discussed a few harbingers of this NEP in 'hybridized' theorizing about topics that were neither exclusively social nor environmental explanations of environmental conditions. It was additionally a critique of Malthusian views of the 1960s and 1970s.|$|E

5000|$|Whilst the 1980s and 1990s saw a {{shift in}} the {{perceived}} relationship between the environment and business practice [...] it has only translated into actions for prominently large firms. This change in environmental business ethics stems mainly from ideas of ‘ecological modernisation', a school of thought advanced most notably by German scholars Joseph Huber and Martin Janicke. They challenged Max Weber’s theory of bureaucratic rationality. A theory which positions government as best placed to resolve environmental problems. Instead, the discourse of ecological modernisation claims that sufficient <b>innovative</b> <b>capacity</b> will come only from industry itself as it has the expertise and means to do so. This is posited with the idea of ‘steering’ industry onto more environmentally beneficial pathways through financial incentives.|$|E
50|$|This theme {{focuses on}} how the {{sustainability}} of resource use and environmental management can be increased through adopting a mix of traditional and modern (technological) approaches. APPRO’s research under this theme emphasizes the crucial linkages {{that need to be}} made between modern approaches to natural resource management and generations-old and (often) sustainable resource use and coping strategies. The scale of analysis ranges from organizational (e.g., enterprise production) to sub-national and national. At all scales of analysis a lifecycle approach is adopted to map and analyze processes to establish where efficiencies can be incorporated into the system, how equity in resource use can be increased, and how adverse environmental impacts can be eliminated, minimized or managed. To date APPRO has applied this approach to examining the impact of climate change on agricultural production, gender and agricultural production, and the agricultural innovation systems for selected products. These studies have focused on the <b>innovative</b> <b>capacity,</b> coping strategies, and system resiliencies exhibited by rural communities when subjected to shocks such as climate change.|$|E

We use a bivariate probit estimation on a sample of 4, 570 manufacturing firms drawn from the 2010 French Community Innovation Surveys (CIS 2010) to study how the innovation profiles of firms impact the propensity to use organisational creativity methods. The estimation results show a strong but differentiated impact of the innovation profiles of firms (products/process, single/complex) on the use of different creativity methods.

Several factors lie behind the differences in the US and EU innovative performance: the nature and dynamics of the R&D investments; differences in industrial structure of R&D; degree of internationalization and location of R&D investments; the linkage between inventions and the science base; the value of venture capital investment; geographical concentration of innovation activities. Thus, the evaluation of the differences in the competitiveness and innovation performance of the US and the EU must consider differences in their subject and space dimensions...|$|R
