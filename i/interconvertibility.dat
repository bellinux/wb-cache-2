Single crystal X-ray diffraction studies indicate that all the compounds form a hierarchy of structures. While the structures 1 and 2 are low-dimensional, 3 − 5 have three-dimensional connectivity. ZnO_ 4 and HPO_ 3 units form a 4 -membered ring and are connected through their corners forming a one-dimensional chain structure in 1. 2 has one-dimensional ladders connected by ZnO_ 2 (H_ 2 O) _ 4 octahedral units forming a layer with 4 - and 8 -membered apertures. Compounds 3 and 4 have similar molecular formulae and connectivity, which makes them polymorphic in nature. The amine molecules exist in gauche and all-trans form in 3 and 4, respectively. The amine molecule binds with the zinc center in 5 and acts as a pillar between the two zinc phosphite layers. The present study outlines the possible role of synthesis parameters for the isolation of a number of different structures by employing a single amine molecule, APPIP. The observation of polymorphic structures along with the <b>interconvertibilities</b> of one of the phases is important and noteworthy.

5000|$|The [...] "one-sex/two-sex" [...] theory {{claims that}} the switch from the one-sex model to the two-sex model created the {{foundations}} of gender {{as we know them}} today. The explanations for this shift are both epistemological and political. In terms of the epistemological, {{in the beginning of the}} eighteenth century, experts with authority were determining what was natural and what was not. Michel de Montaigne, a writer during the French Renaissance, writes in his Travel Journal, about a group of young girls who dressed up like males and led their lives as males. For him, this was seen as perfectly normal and that [...] "there is no ontological sex, only organs assigned legal and social status". In the two-sex model though, these experts wanted to create a link between biological sex and theoretical gender and anything transgressing these boundaries was seen as being abnormal. Although it was thought in the one-sex model that feminine men may lactate and that [...] "almost all the men have a great quantity of milk in their breasts", the notion of <b>interconvertibility</b> of fluids among men and women was thrown out the window in the two-sex model. Sex became related to physical facts and the uterus became a justification for the status of women. Gender roles became institutionalized and what was meant to be male or female was based on what the experts thought was natural. Philosophers like Rousseau supported this view and he saw women as being relegated to the private sphere as wives and mothers while men dominated the public sphere.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This article {{examines}} the concept “political capital ” (PC) and its context in American politics. Political capital is ill-defined, little understood, yet an important concept for understanding political exchange and relationships in the political arena. I establish a definition based upon Pierre Bourdieu’s <b>interconvertibility</b> theory, which indicates that capital types, such as economic, social, and symbolic forms, interact and can be exchanged for one another. Since the material and non-material components of capital variations are transposable, {{it can be argued}} that no capital form is essentially “pure”—every type of capital contains elements of other varieties. Political capital, therefore, is an amalgamation of capital types combined in various ways for specific political markets. It is market demand that shapes capital formation. Capital elements from other capital types inherent in the candidacy market are identified as an example. An index for measuring this variant of political capital is created, demonstrating its conceptual viability. Introduction: After the 2004 U. S. presidential election, George W. Bus...|$|E

For the inverse problem of simulating a tripartite noisy correlation from noiseless secret key and unlimited public communication, we show that Winter's (2005) result for the key cost {{in terms of a}} conditional version of Wyner's common information can be simply reexpressed in terms of the existence of a bipartite protocol monotone. For the forward problem of key distillation from noisy correlations, we construct simple distributions for which the conditional Gács and Körner common information achieves a tight bound on the secret key rate.

To this end we introduce racbox: a box such that supplemented with one bit of communication offers RAC. As said, PR-box can simulate racbox. The question we raise, is whether any racbox can simulate PR-box. We show that a non-signaling racbox indeed can simulate PR-box, hence those two resources are equivalent.

The transverse folded parts contained a variable number of interlocking processes from contiguous cells. Large processes were frequently flanked by smaller ones. Nexuses appeared to be better developed on the straight parts of intercalated discs than on the folded parts. They varied in size, shape and particle-packing density. The largest nexus observed was almost perfectly circular. It covered an area of 0. 087 micron 2, contained 530 particles and had a particle-packing density of 6078 particles/micron 2.

They are associated with particular mutations (ery-r 10 and str-d 2) which add to, rather than replace their homologous sites during deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) -mediated transformation. Markers at linked sites do not become diploid at the same time. The heterozygous condition thus produced is maintained during cell reproduction. However, {{in the case of}} the ery merodiploid at least, segregation of haploid types does occasionally occur. The transforming properties of DNA isolated from the merodiploids, taken together with the segregation patterns of the merodiploids, reveal the heterozygous condition. The merodiploid condition can be transferred via a single molecule of DNA, which can be explained by assuming that both alleles at the diploid site are integrated into the linear continuity of the bacterial chromosome. In the case of the ery merodiploid, two distinct, relatively stable but interconvertible states are recognizable.

The emphasis is particularly on the analogy of such transport with propagation of light wave through medium with alternating dielectric constant.

The proliferation is associated with intranuclear vesicles which apparently coalesce to form comparatively simple replicas of the nuclear envelope closely applied {{to the inside of}} the nuclear envelope. The envelope itself may become disorganized at the time when fully formed annulate lamellae appear on the cytoplasmic side and parallel with it. The concept of <b>interconvertibility</b> of general cytoplasmic vesicles with most of the membrane systems of the cytoplasm is presented. The structure of the annuli in the annulate lamel]ae is shown to include small spheres or vesicles of variable size embedded in a dense matrix. Dense particles which are about 150 A in diameter are often found closely associated with annulate lamellae in the cytoplasm. Similar structures in other echinoderm eggs are basophilic. In this species, unlike other published examples, the association apparently takes place in the cytoplasm only after the lamellae have separated from the nucleus.

40|$|The {{properties}} of atomically monodisperse noble metal nanoclusters (NCs) are intricately intertwined with their precise molecular formula. The {{vast majority of}} size-specific NC syntheses start from {{the reduction of the}} metal salt and thiol ligand mixture. Only in gold was it recently shown that ligand-exchange could induce the growth of NCs from one atomically precise species to another; a process of yet unknown reversibility. Here, we present a process for the ligand-exchange-induced growth of atomically precise silver NCs, in a biphasic liquid-liquid system, which is particularly of interest because of its complete reversibility and ability to occur at room temperature. We explore this phenomenon in-depth using Ag 35 (SG) 18 [SG= glutathionate] and Ag 44 (4 -FTP) 30 [4 -FTP= 4 -fluorothiophenol] as model systems. We show that the ligand-exchange conversion of Ag 35 (SG) 18 into Ag 44 (4 -FTP) 30 is rapid (< 5 min) and direct, while the reverse process proceeds slowly through intermediate cluster sizes. We adapt a recently developed theory of reverse Ostwald ripening to model the NCs’ <b>interconvertibility.</b> The model’s predictions are in good agreement with the experimental observations, and they highlight the importance of small changes in the ligand-metal binding energy in determining the final equilibrium NC size. Based on the insight provided by this model, we demonstrated experimentally that by varying the choice of ligands, ligand-exchange can be used to obtain different sized NCs. The findings in this work establish ligand-exchange as a versatile tool for tuning cluster sizes...|$|E

Bacteriol. 88 : 72 – 80. 1964. —Growth from small inocula of six species of lactobacilli was stimulated by addition of spermine or spermidine to a defined medium; none of four streptococcal species showed this effect. Lactobacillus casei was stimulated {{to the greatest}} extent. Several homologues and analogues partially duplicated the growth-promoting effects of spermidine; one inactive homologue, N-(3 -aminopropyl) - 1, 6 -hexanediamine, competitively inhibited the growth response to spermidine and spermine, and reduced or eliminated the response to several weakly active compounds. A procedure for separation of spermine and spermidine, and their estimation by bioassay with L. casei, was developed and applied to the estimation of these compounds in bacterial cells. Both compounds are present in lactic acid bacteria in amounts much smaller (1 to 5 %) than those found in Escherichia coli. Addition of spermine or spermidine to the growth medium results in large accumulations in the cells, and the two amines show limited <b>interconvertibility.</b> Putrescine does not increase the cell content of either spermine or spermidine. Presence of the inhibitor prevents accumulation of the growth-stimulating amines.

40|$|There {{is little}} doubt that the nuclear Overhauser effect is {{potentially}} the most powerful tool for the investigation of the solution structures of biological macro-molecules since it can be used both to demonstrate the proximity of two protons in space and to determine their separation (I-IO). Given the <b>interconvertibility</b> of intramolecular distances, torsion angles, and Cartesian coordinates, providing the chirality of the structure is known (11 - 14) a large interproton distance data set can in principle be used either to solve ab initio the complete three-dimensional structure of a molecule in solution using a distance-geometry algorithm (II, 14) or to refine an initial trial model using either constrained least-squares minimization procedures or molecular dynamics calculations incorporating the distance data in the form of pseudopotentials. In the case of small proteins, it is usually sufficient to obtain a qualitative assessment of distance, as has been demonstrated in the case of lipid bound glucagon (15) and scorpion insectotoxin ISA (16). In the case of oligonucleotides a qualitative assessment of distance is sufficient to distinguish the three classes of DNA conformations, namely right-handed A and B DNA and left-handed Z DNA, but is not adequate for further refinement (8, 27 - 20). This requires distance determinations to an accuracy of- + 0. 2 A (9, 21, 22). Considering large molecules for which 07, 9 1 (the spin-diffusion limit), such accuracy can in principle be obtained by measuring the initial slope of the time development of the NOE.

40|$|Cancer {{stem cells}} (CSCs) sustain tumor growth through {{their ability to}} self-renew and to {{generate}} differentiated progeny. These functions endow CSCs {{with the potential to}} initiate secondary tumors bearing characteristics {{similar to those of the}} parent. Recently the hair follicle stem cell marker CD 34 was used to purify a CSC-like cell population from early skin tumors arising from treatment with 7, 12 -dimethylbenz[α]anthracene/ 12 -o-tetradecanoylphorbol- 13 -acetate, which typically generates benign papillomas that occasionally progress to squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). In the present study, we identify and characterize CSCs purified from malignant SCCs. We show that SCCs contain two highly tumorigenic CSC populations that differ in CD 34 levels but are enriched for integrins and coexist at the SCC–stroma interface. Intriguingly, whether CD 34 lo or CD 34 hi, α 6 hiβ 1 hi populations can initiate secondary tumors by serial limit-dilution transplantation assays, but α 6 loβ 1 lo populations cannot. Moreover, secondary tumors generated from a single CSC of either subtype contain both CD 34 lo and CD 34 hi α 6 hiβ 1 hiCSCs, indicating their nonhierarchical organization. Genomic profiling and hierarchical cluster analysis show that these two CSC subtypes share a molecular signature distinct from either the CD 34 − epidermal or the CD 34 hi hair follicle stem cell signature. Although closely related, α 6 hiβ 1 hiCD 34 lo and α 6 hiβ 1 hiCD 34 hi CSCs differ in cell-cycle gene expression and proliferation characteristics. Indeed, proliferation and expansion of α 6 hiβ 1 hiCD 34 hi CSCs is sensitive to whether they can initiate a TGF-β receptor II–mediated response to counterbalance elevated focal adhesion kinase-mediated integrin signaling within the tumor. Overall, the coexistence and <b>interconvertibility</b> of CSCs with differing sensitivities to their microenvironment pose challenges and opportunities for SCC cancer therapies...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} aims {{to reveal}} and prove {{the thesis of}} the neutral and convertibility relationship between constituent constructive elements of the universe: matter, energy and information. The approach perspective is a computationally-communicative-neutrosophic one. We configure a coherent and cohesive ideation line. Matter, energy and information are fundamental elements of the world. Among them, there is an inextricable multiple, elastic and evolutionary connection. The elements are defined by the connections between them. Our hypothesis is {{that the relationship between}} matter, energy and information is a neutral one. This relationship is not required by the evidence. At this level, it does not give {{up in front of the}} evidence intelligibility. Neutral relationship is revealed as a law connection. First, the premise that matter, energy and information never come into contradiction is taken as strong evidence. Their law-like-reciprocal obligations are non contradictory. Being beyond the contrary, matter, energy and information maintain a neutral relationship. Therefore, on the basis of the establishment and functioning of the universe or multi-verse, there is neutrality. Matter, energy and information are primary-founder neutralities. Matter, energy and information are neutral because they are related to inexorable legitimate. They are neutral because they are perfectly bound to one another. Regularity and uniformity are the primary forms of neutrality.

Low-energy collision-induced dissociation (CID) experiments revealed that the <b>interconvertibility</b> of the isomers [G. XW] + (radical centered on the N-terminal α-carbon atom) and [GXW]. + (radical centered on the π system of the indolyl ring) generally increased upon increasing the proton affinity of residue X. When X was arginine, the most basic amino acid, the two isomers were fully interconvertible and produced almost identical CID spectra despite the different locations of their initial radical sites. The presence of the very basic arginine residue allowed radical migrations to proceed readily among the [G. RW] + and [GRW]. + isomers prior to their dissociations. Density functional theory calculations revealed that the energy barriers for isomerizations among the α-carbon-centered radical [G. RW] +, the π-centered radical [GRW]. +, and the β-carbon-centered radical [GRW β. ] + (ca. 32 - 36 kcal mol - 1) were comparable with those for their dissociations (ca. 32 - 34 kcal mol - 1). The arginine residue in these GRW radical cations tightly sequesters the proton, thereby resulting in minimal changes in the chemical environment during the radical migrations, in contrast to the situation for the analogous GGW system, in which the proton is inefficiently stabilized during the course of radical migration.

40|$|In {{accordance}} with the special theory of relativity all forms of energy, including heat, have inertia and hence in {{accordance with}} the equivalence principle also have weight. The purpose of the present article is to investigate the thermodynamic implications of the idea that heat has weight. In particular an investigation is made to see if a temperature gradient is a necessary accompaniment of thermal equilibrium in a gravitational field, in order to prevent the flow of heat from regions of higher to those of lower gravitational potential. A preliminary non-rigorous treatment of this problem is first given by attempting to modify the classical thermodynamics only to the extent of associating with each intrinsic quantity of energy an additional amount of potential gravitational energy. In this way an expression is obtained for increase in equilibrium temperature with decrease in gravitational potential which, however, could in any case only be correct as a first approximation in a weak gravitational field. A discussion of the uncertainties and lack of rigor of this preliminary treatment is then given and the necessity pointed out for a rigorous treatment based on the principles of general relativity. A rigorous relativistic treatment is then undertaken using the extension of thermodynamics to general relativity previously presented by the author. The system to be treated is taken as a static spherical distribution of perfect fluid which has come to gravitational and thermodynamic equilibrium. The principles of relativistic mechanics are first applied to such a system in order to obtain results needed in the later work. And it is then shown that these mechanical principles themselves are sufficient to determine the temperature distribution as a function of potential in the simple case of black-body radiation. The principles of relativistic thermodynamics are then applied to this same case of pure black-body radiation and the same expression for temperature as a function of potential obtained by the thermodynamic as by the mechanical treatment. This may be regarded as giving some measure of check on the validity of the proposed relativistic thermodynamics. Following this, a thermodynamic treatment is given for the temperature distribution in the more general case of matter and radiation and a result found which harmonizes with that for radiation alone. A treatment is then given to the distribution of a perfect monatomic gas in a gravitational field both {{on the assumption that the}} total number of atoms must remain constant and on the assumption of the ready <b>interconvertibility</b> of matter and radiation. In the latter case the same dependence of concentration on temperature is obtained as was found by Stern and by the author for the case of flat space-time. Using a system of coordinates such that the line element for the sphere of fluid takes the form ds 2 =-eu(dr 2 +r 2 dθ 2 +r 2 sin 2 θdφ 2) +eνdt 2 the general result for the relation between gravitational potential and equilibrium temperature T 0 as measured by a local observer in proper coordinates can be given by the equation d lnT 0 /dr=- 1 / 2 dν/dr This equation reduces in the case of a weak field to that obtained by the preliminary non-rigorous treatment, and gives a very small change of temperature with position in fields of ordinary intensity. The result, however, is one of great theoretical interest, since constant temperature throughout any system which has come to thermal equilibrium has hitherto been regarded as an inescapable thermodynamic conclusion. It is also not out of the question that the effect might sometime be of experimental or observational importance...|$|E
