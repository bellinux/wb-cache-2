5|$|An {{individual}} mandate {{coupled with}} subsidies for private insurance {{as a means}} for universal healthcare was considered the best way to win the support of the Senate because it had been included in prior bipartisan reform proposals. The concept goes back to at least 1989, when the conservative The Heritage Foundation proposed an individual mandate as an alternative to single-payer health care. It was championed for a time by conservative economists and Republican senators as a market-based approach to healthcare reform on the basis of individual responsibility and avoidance of <b>free</b> <b>rider</b> problems. Specifically, because the 1986 Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) requires any hospital participating in Medicare (nearly all do) to provide emergency care to anyone who needs it, the government often indirectly bore the cost of those without the ability to pay.|$|E

40|$|Many {{studies show}} that people act {{cooperative}}ly {{and are willing to}} punish <b>free</b> <b>riders</b> (i. e., people who are less cooperative than others). However, nonpunishers benefit when <b>free</b> <b>riders</b> are punished, making punishment a group-beneficial act. Presented here are four studies investigating whether punishers gain social benefits from punishing. Undergraduate participants played public goods games (PGGs) (cooperative group games involving money) in which there were <b>free</b> <b>riders,</b> and in which they were given the opportunity to impose monetary penalties on <b>free</b> <b>riders.</b> Participants rated punishers as being more trustworthy, group focused, and worthy of respect than nonpunishers. In dyadic trust games following PGGs, punishers did not receive monetary benefits from punishing <b>free</b> <b>riders</b> in a single-round PGG, but did benefit monetarily from punishing <b>free</b> <b>riders</b> in iterated PGGs. Punishment that was not directed at <b>free</b> <b>riders</b> brought no monetary benefits, suggesting that people distinguish between justified and unjustified punishment and only respond to punishment with enhanced trust when the punishment is justified...|$|R

However, assigning grades fairly to all team members {{in a way}} that rewards them for their contributions remains challenging. In this paper, we ask whether having <b>free</b> <b>riders</b> on a team lowers the quality of submitted work, and whether students’ course performance correlates with peer evaluations. In an introductory sociology course, 101 students were grouped into 20 teams; each team completed a set of three papers. Students were evaluated by the quality of work submitted and peer evaluations. For statistical analysis, we organized the teams into one of three groups, among which we compared average paper grades: group one contained teams with <b>free</b> <b>riders,</b> group two contained teams that may have <b>free</b> <b>riders,</b> and group three contained teams with no <b>free</b> <b>riders.</b> We found that teams with <b>free</b> <b>riders</b> did not submit significantly lower quality work than teams without <b>free</b> <b>riders.</b> We also statistically analyzed the relationship between student course performance and their peer evaluation, and found that students’ performance in the course showed little correlation with their peer evaluations. Our results indicate that <b>free</b> <b>riders</b> do not depress the grades of non-free rider students. We also found that students’ peer evaluations do not correlate with their course performance, a finding which warrants further research. </p...|$|R

25|$|The {{existence}} of privileged groups {{may not be}} a complete solution to the <b>free</b> <b>rider</b> problem, however, as underproduction of the public good may still result. The street light builder, for instance, would not consider the added benefit to neighboring businesses when determining whether to erect his street light, making it possible that the street light isn't built when the cost of building is too high for the single entrepreneur even when the total benefit to all the businesses combined exceeds the cost.|$|E
25|$|Another {{method of}} {{overcoming}} the <b>free</b> <b>rider</b> {{problem is to}} simply eliminate the profit incentive for free riding by buying out all the potential free riders. A property developer that owned an entire city street, for instance, would not {{need to worry about}} free riders when erecting street lights since he owns every business that could benefit from the street light without paying. Implicitly, then, the property developer would erect street lights until the marginal social benefit met the marginal social cost. In this case, they are equivalent to the private marginal benefits and costs.|$|E
40|$|Punishment is {{a popular}} tool when {{governing}} commons in situations where <b>free</b> <b>riders</b> would otherwise take over. It {{is well known that}} sanctioning systems, such as the police and courts, are costly and thus can suffer from those who free ride on other&# 39;s efforts to maintain the sanctioning systems (second-order <b>free</b> <b>riders).</b> Previous game-theory studies showed that if populations are very large, pool punishment rarely emerges in public good games, even when participation is optional, because of second-order <b>free</b> <b>riders.</b> Here we show that a matching fund for rewarding cooperation leads to the emergence of pool punishment, despite the presence of second-order <b>free</b> <b>riders.</b> We demonstrate that reward funds can pave the way for a transition from a population of <b>free</b> <b>riders</b> to a population of pool punishers. A key factor in promoting the transition is also to reward those who contribute to pool punishment, yet not abstaining from participation. Reward funds eventually vanish in raising pool punishment, which is sustainable by punishing the second-order <b>free</b> <b>riders.</b> This suggests that considering the interdependence of reward and punishment may help to better understand the origins and transitions of social norms and institutions...|$|R

Unfortunately, current multimedia applications use centralized architectures. Before decentralized architectures are uti-lized and used, some issues related to decentralization must be addressed. In this pa-per, we focus on the problem of free riding in decentralized collaborative environments. We propose a novel taxonomy of <b>free</b> <b>riders</b> in multimedia systems based on trustwor-thiness. To the best of our knowledge, no existing literature considers trustworthiness, which we believe is a vital dimension that should be considered when identifying <b>free</b> <b>riders.</b> We also propose a new mechanism to filter out and isolate <b>free</b> <b>riders.</b> Our exten-sive simulation experiments show that our proposed algorithm is reasonably successful in identifying <b>free</b> <b>riders</b> in multimedia-based systems...|$|R

25|$|Stouten (2006) further {{generalized}} {{the principle}} of fairness {{to be applied to}} the provision of public goods. He and his colleagues ran three experiments to find how participants reacted when one member of their group violated the equality rule, which states that all group members will coordinate to equally and fairly contribute to the efficient provision of public goods. Their findings demonstrated that the participants believed that the equality rule should be applied to others and therefore when one person violated this rule punishment was used against this person, in terms of negative reactions. Therefore, the equality rule applied in real life situations should lead to the efficient provision of public goods if violations of the important coordination and fairness rules can be detected. However, often these violations cannot be detected which then leads to the <b>free</b> <b>rider</b> problem and an under-provision of public goods.|$|E
25|$|If {{enough people}} do not think like free-riders, the private and {{voluntary}} provision of public goods may be successful. For example, a <b>free</b> <b>rider</b> might come to a public park to enjoy its beauty, yet discard litter that makes it less enjoyable for others. More public-spirited individuals don't do this (they might even pick up existing litter) – why? There could be several reasons. Perhaps they have lived nearby for years and derive pleasure from helping their community, or at least would feel ashamed if their neighbors or friends saw them. Perhaps they are emotionally attached to the environment, or the park is a national treasure; littering it would offend their patriotism. To the extent that most people behave like this (for any reason), a public good is produced: everyone enjoys a clean park, without the government needing to spend tax money on maintenance crews.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, the <b>free</b> <b>rider</b> {{knows that he}} or she cannot be {{excluded}} from the benefits of national defense, regardless of whether he or she contributes to it. There is also no way that these benefits can be split up and distributed as individual parcels to people. The <b>free</b> <b>rider</b> would not voluntarily exert any extra effort, unless there is some inherent pleasure or material reward for doing so (for example, money paid by the government, as with an all-volunteer army or mercenaries). The free-riding problem is even more complicated than it was thought to be until recently. [...] Any time non-excludability results in failure to pay the true marginal value (often called the [...] "demand revelation problem"), it will also result in failure to generate proper income levels, since households will not give up valuable leisure if they cannot individually increment a good. [...] This implies that, for public goods without strong special interest support, under-provision is likely since benefit-cost analyses are being conducted at the wrong income levels, and all of the ungenerated income would have been spent on the public good, apart from general equilibrium considerations.|$|E

2500|$|The Court first {{revisited}} {{the issue}} in Lehnert v. Ferris Faculty Association in 1991. The Court was [...] "sharply divided", writing [...] "four opinions that were supported {{in whole or in}} part by varying numbers of Justices" [...] and citing divergent reasons for supporting those parts of the decision they supported. [...] "ll nine Justices rejected a broader argument put forward by the objecting employees that the employees should not have to pay for activities of the national union ... that were not undertaken directly on behalf of the ... bargaining unit." [...] Eight justices agreed that unions could not charge agency fee payers for lobbying activities. But on other issues, the court split. The case was more difficult to adjudicate because it involved state action (the bargaining unit was composed of public employees) and thus brought First Amendment issues into consideration and because of the unique nature of the union's dues structure. Writing for the majority, Justice Blackmun established a three-prong test for determining the constitutionality and statutory legality of agency fee charges in public employee bargaining units: 1) The charges must be [...] "germane" [...] to collective bargaining activity; 2) The charges must not [...] "significantly" [...] burden the non-members' free speech rights; and 3) Charges must be justified by the need for labor peace or to avoid the <b>free</b> <b>rider</b> problem. Acceptable charges included that part of affiliation fees which are spent on collective bargaining, collective bargaining expenditures destined for other states, expenditures for national union publications insofar as they support collective bargaining, information services and other miscellaneous items that are not political nor public in nature and which benefit of all workers even though they do not directly impact the bargaining unit, expenditures to attend union meetings and conventions, and strike expenses (whether the strike is legal or not). Non-chargeable expenses include: Lobbying, electoral, or other political activities not directly related to contract bargaining or implementation; political or public activities aimed at winning a greater budget for the collective bargaining unit; litigation or publications reporting on litigation that does not concern directly concern the bargaining unit; and public relations efforts (including informational picketing, media purchases, signs, posters, and buttons) designed to enhance public respect for the workers' profession.

The analysis distinguishes between strong and weak free riders: strong <b>free</b> <b>riders</b> plan to adopt a new heating system {{in the next five}} years anyway; weak <b>free</b> <b>riders</b> decide to purchase once made aware of an attractive technology package (and therefore would not need a rebate to adopt).

The minimum acceptable rebate and weak free ridership vary with income, environmental identity, and with risk and time preferences. At a rebate level that corresponds to half the purchase price of the offered heating system, the share of <b>free</b> <b>riders</b> was estimated at 50 percent for most countries, with the share of weak <b>free</b> <b>riders</b> typically higher than that of strong <b>free</b> <b>riders.</b> Public spending costs per reduced ton of CO 2 differ considerably across countries and only compare to high social costs of carbon...|$|R
