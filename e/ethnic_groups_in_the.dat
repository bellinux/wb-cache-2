5|$|The {{defeat of}} the Qarmatians at Hama also {{opened the way for}} the Abbasids to recover the provinces of {{southern}} Syria and Egypt, held by the Tulunids.

On 24 May 904, Muhammad ibn Sulayman left Baghdad at the head of an army, numbering 10,000 according to al-Tabari, and tasked with recovering southern Syria and Egypt itself from the Tulunids.
