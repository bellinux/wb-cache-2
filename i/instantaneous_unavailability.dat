30|$|In an {{arrangement}} series, {{the whole system}} is no longer operational if a single component fails. This means that all components must be operational for the serial system to succeed. If a system with n independent components is considered, the reliability (instantaneous availability or steady-state availability) is obtained by the product of component’s reliabilities (instantaneous availability or steady-state availability). In a parallel arrangement, the whole system is considered operational even if only a single component is operational, {{because there are a}} total of n possible success paths. For a system with n independent components, the unreliability (<b>instantaneous</b> <b>unavailability</b> or steady-state unavailability) is obtained by the product of component’s unreliability (<b>instantaneous</b> <b>unavailability</b> or steady-state unavailability). k-out-n redundancy may also be represented by RBDs. k-out-n RBD models allows you to represent more general compositions than simple series or parallel configurations. Actually, simple series or parallel configurations are special cases of k-out-n compositions [24, 25, 31, 42].|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new iterative numerical algorithm for optimal maintenance strategy respecting a given reliability constraint. It {{stems from the}} previous author's research work which brings a new direct analytical method that enables exact reliability quantifications of highly reliable systems with maintenance (both preventive and corrective), i. e. the <b>instantaneous</b> <b>unavailability</b> function is computed in full machine accuracy. The method takes into account systems with highly reliable and maintained components, including repairable components undergoing to hidden failures. The new numerical algorithm for maintenance optimization introduced in this article fully respects previously developed exact computing methodology to solve a cost optimization problem where decision variable is maintenance. The algorithm, {{which is based on}} merits of a high performance language for technical computing MATLAB, results from linear approximation of total system cost that {{is supposed to be a}} linear function of frequency of maintenance and from limiting unavailability approximation in each iteration step. The optimization method is demonstrated on two systems from practice—a real power distribution network and high pressure injection system of a nuclear power plant. Web of Science 109857...|$|E
