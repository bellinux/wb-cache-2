500|$|The {{earthquake}} {{was caused}} by a rupture along the Abiz Fault, part of the Sistan suture zone of eastern Iran. Located northeast of the main collision zone between the Arabian and Eurasian tectonic plates, the Sistan zone marks the eastern boundary of the Iranian microplate where it intersects with the Afghan crustal block. Most of Iran is contained on one microplate, causing seismic activity mainly along its borders. Both the 1968 Dasht-e-Bayez earthquake (magnitude 7.3, resulting in 12,000–20,000deaths) and the Qayen earthquake were the results of strike-slip faults, meaning that the crustal blocks {{on either side of the}} faults shifted against each other horizontally. The Qayen earthquake {{was caused by}} right lateral movement along the Abiz Fault. In addition to the dominant strike-slip displacement, there was also local evidence of reverse faulting. The average displacement of about 2 m indicates a low static stress drop, more consistent with an interplate earthquake than an intraplate event. The maximum <b>horizontal</b> <b>acceleration</b> during the quake was approximately 6.9 meters per second—nearly three-quarters of the acceleration an object would have in free fall—and occurred near the earthquake's epicenter. The crustal layer involved in the rupture was [...] thick. The surface fault that caused the earthquake extended for , which was longer than would be expected given the earthquake's magnitude. There were at least 155aftershocks, reaching a magnitude of up to 5.5 on the Richter magnitude scale. Many of the aftershocks occurred along the rupture up to [...] below the surface.|$|E
40|$|The {{stabilized}} platforms used {{in marine}} and airborne gravimeters behave like damped long‐period pendulums. When subjected to <b>horizontal</b> <b>accelerations</b> they tilt, resulting in gravimeter reading errors. The amount of tilt {{depends on the}} ratio of the period of the horizontal motion to that of the platform and is negligible if this ratio is less than about 0. 1 (LaCoste, 1967). This condition can be achieved in straight and level flight using an auto pilot, provided the platform period is set to a sufficiently long period (Brozena and Peters, 1988). Course changes are sometimes unavoidable, however, resulting in lost data (Bell et al., 1991; Brozena, 1984). The aim {{of this paper is to}} show that such data loss is unnecessary since the tilt, and hence the gravimeter error, can be accurately modeled from the <b>horizontal</b> <b>accelerations.</b> Moreover the technique will improve data quality whenever long period <b>horizontal</b> <b>accelerations</b> occur.

Firstly, we continuously track the device attitude by developing extended Kalman filter (EKF) fusing inertial sensors. Then, we combine related rotation matrix to project the accelerations at local device coordinate system (DCS) into the global coordinate system (GCS). Finally, the global walking direction may be extracted by PCA over <b>horizontal</b> <b>accelerations.</b> Due to gyro and acceleration drifts, the accuracy performance of user heading estimation and positioning may degrade rapidly over a relatively short period.|$|R

40|$|Subjective {{vertical}} (SV) conflict theory postulates that {{motion sickness}} is elicited in all situations {{that lead to}} {{a difference between the}} sensed and subjective verticals. The sensed vertical is Earth’s gravity as perceived by human sense modalities; the subjective vertical is also Earth’s gravity, but in accordance with the expectations of the central nervous system, based on past interaction with the spatial environment. The SV conflict models have been successfully used to predict motion sickness on board high speed passenger ferries. However, a recent EU project, COMPASS, indicated that the role of <b>horizontal</b> <b>accelerations</b> in the elicitation of motion sickness aboard contemporary vessels is as important as that of vertical accelerations. Consequently, this paper, using an extended statement of the SV conflict theory, proposes that SV conflict models can be further elaborated by explicitly incorporating the effects of <b>horizontal</b> <b>accelerations</b> (normal to gravity) experienced aboard contemporary vessels. It is hypothesized that the explanation of motion sickness variability can be improved by considering the combined effects of subjective vertical conflict and subjective horizontal conflict (the difference between the sensed and expected <b>horizontal</b> <b>accelerations).</b> After presenting the theoretical aspects of subjective vertical–horizontal (SVH) conflict model, this paper demonstrates its application to 7 field trials of 3 different vessels. The proportion of commuters getting seasick (i. e., motion sickness incidences, MSI) during each field trial, has been statistically compared with the values predicted by the physiological (SVH and SV) and descriptive sickness prediction models.

40|$|In this thesis, {{a method}} is {{developed}} to compute first-passage probabilities for linear elastic structures subjected to random base accelerations. The base accelerations consist of both {{horizontal and vertical}} components. Specifically, {{the effect of the}} vertical accelerations on the first passage probabilities are investigated herein. ^ The solution of the first-passage problem is accomplished by discretizing the process in both space and time. Spacial barriers are placed on the response process of the structure. The probabilities associated with the structural response remaining within the specified barriers are computed. This event is the complementary event of first passage. ^ For a single-story frame undergoing <b>horizontal</b> <b>accelerations,</b> the model of the frame is seen to {{have a significant effect on}} first passage probabilities. The models used are a shear frame model and a flexible beam model. The effect of vertical accelerations is noticeable regardless of the model chosen. This effect is seen to depend more upon the magnitude of the frame loading than upon the magnitude of the vertical acceleration. ^ For a two-story frame, only a shear frame model is used. First-passage probabilities are computed for arbitrary barriers on the displacement responses of the stories under the action of <b>horizontal</b> base <b>accelerations</b> only. Then the first-passage probabilities are computed for the same frame subjected to both vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>accelerations.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: In this article, {{the problem}} of {{determining}} pseudo-dynamic pressure and its associated forces on a rigid vertical retaining wall is solved analytically using the horizontal slices method for both reinforced and unreinforced walls. The use of this method {{in conjunction with the}} suggested equations and unknowns offers a pseudo-dynamic method that is then compared with the results of an available software. In the proposed method, different seismic accelera-tions have been modeled at different soil structure heights. Reinforced soil pressure on a retaining wall and the angle of the critical failure wedge are calculated using the new formulation. It is shown that as the <b>horizontal</b> seismic <b>acceleration</b> coefficient increases the angle of the critical failure wedge is reduced and that the maximum extension force can be increased for each layer by using stronger and longer reinforcements. The results of the pseudo-dynamic method show that both vertical and <b>horizontal</b> seismic <b>accelerations</b> are essential coefficients for calculation of the required length and extension force of the reinforcements and that their importance increases as the vertical and <b>horizontal</b> seismic <b>accelerations</b> increase. Also, the location of the application point of the resultant pressure rises as the <b>horizontal</b> seismic <b>acceleration</b> coefficient increases...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of shaking table tests {{performed}} to assess the response of an object placed on a vibration isolator to intense ground motions whose peak accelerations are close to or over the gravity acceleration in both vertical and horizontal directions. The passive vertical and horizontal vibration isolator, developed by the authors, has rolling load-bearing elements and constant-force springs to provide piecewise-constant restoring forces. First, we performed shaking table tests, wherein only the horizontal vibration was isolated. An unexpected finding from the tests is that, when the vibration isolator was subjected to ground motions with intense vertical accelerations, not only vertical but also <b>horizontal</b> <b>accelerations</b> were amplified. This led to a large rocking response or overturning of the object placed on the vibration isolator. A likely reason for the amplification is rocking of the upper portion of the vibration isolator above the rolling load-bearing elements induced by intense vertical accelerations. Next, we performed shaking table tests, wherein both vertical and horizontal vibrations were isolated. In this case, the vertical as well as <b>horizontal</b> <b>accelerations</b> were significantly reduced and the rocking response of the vibration-isolated object was suppressed. These results suggest potential risks in conventional horizontal vibration isolators having rolling load-bearing elements when they are subjected to ground motions with intense vertical accelerations. The results also demonstrate the effectiveness of vertical vibration isolation to avoid such risks...|$|R
