5|$|<b>Interestingly,</b> a Dutch group {{simultaneously}} {{described an}} identical gene as apolipoprotein {{which it is}} associated with the early phase of liver regeneration, but failed to recognise its important role in the determination of plasma triglyceride levels.|$|E
5|$|<b>Interestingly,</b> {{the three}} Queensland players {{selected}} in the touring party - Don Tallon, Bill Brown (cricketer), and Colin McCool were all from Toombul District Cricket Club.|$|E
5|$|Steinhaus had {{full command}} of several foreign {{languages}} and was <b>interestingly,</b> known, for his aphorisms, {{to the point}} that a booklet of his most famous ones in Polish, French and Latin has been published posthumously.|$|E
5|$|American Patriots {{reacted to}} {{news of the}} battle with optimism. Especially after Burgoyne's Indian screen left him, small groups of local Patriots began to emerge to harass the fringes of British positions. <b>Interestingly,</b> a {{significant}} portion of Stark's force returned home and did not again become influential in the campaign until appearing at Saratoga on October 13 to complete the encirclement of Burgoyne's army.|$|E
5|$|Cockatoos have a {{much more}} {{restricted}} range than the true parrots, occurring naturally only in Australasia, Indonesia and the Philippines. Eleven of the 21 species exist in the wild only in Australia, while seven species occur only in the islands of the Philippines, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. <b>Interestingly,</b> no cockatoo species are found in Borneo (despite their presence on nearby Palawan and Sulawesi) or many Pacific islands, although fossil remains have been recorded from New Caledonia.|$|E
5|$|Egypt, Iraq, and Lebanon withdrew in {{response}} to the Suez Crisis, and the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland withdrew {{in response}} to the Soviet invasion of Hungary. <b>Interestingly,</b> because of Australian quarantine restrictions, the equestrian events were held five months earlier in Stockholm, with a total of 29 participating nations, including five nations that did not compete in Melbourne.|$|E
5|$|In Spain, Benidorm {{played a}} similar role as Cannes. Shortly after the bikini was banned in Spain, Pedro Zaragoza, {{the mayor of}} Benidorm {{convinced}} dictator Francisco Franco that his town needed to legalize the bikini to draw tourists. In 1959, General Franco agreed and the town became a popular tourist destination. <b>Interestingly,</b> {{in less than four}} years since Franco's death in 1979, Spanish beaches and women had gone topless.|$|E
5|$|In nature, it was {{observed}} that males would venture away from the nest in order to attract females. The males would press their gastral sterna against a perch and rub their mandibular against it. This is used to attract females, and females were observed to visit these branches and sample the scents. <b>Interestingly,</b> it was also found that on some occasions, males were attracted to other male scents.|$|E
5|$|<b>Interestingly,</b> {{although}} the centrum of Hatzegopteryx {{is much more}} robust than Arambourgiania, their ratios of bone radius to bone thickness (R/t) are roughly the same (9.45 for Hatzegopteryx and 9.9 for Arambourgiania). This may represent a compromise between increasing bending strength and buckling strength; higher R/t ratios lead to improved bending strength, but weaker buckling strength. To compensate for this, Hatzegopteryx shows {{a number of other}} adaptations to improve buckling strength, namely the distinctive internal structures of the bones and the large articular joints of the vertebrae, the latter of which helps to distribute stress.|$|E
5|$|<b>Interestingly,</b> the funerary {{complex of}} the layer pyramid shows {{no trace of}} an {{enclosure}} wall, which is present in both earlier and later pyramid complexes. This could be because the stones constituting the wall were robbed over time, or simply because the wall was never started, being usually the last element of the pyramid complex to be built.|$|E
5|$|Lloyd's mirror generates {{interference}} fringes {{by combining}} direct {{light from a}} source (blue lines) and light from the source's reflected image (red lines) from a mirror held at grazing incidence. The result is an asymmetrical pattern of fringes. <b>Interestingly,</b> the band of equal path length, nearest the mirror, is dark rather than bright. In 1834, Humphrey Lloyd interpreted this effect as proof that the phase of a front-surface reflected beam is inverted.|$|E
5|$|Much like {{fathers are}} {{depicted}} primarily in recreational activities with their children, other male {{members of the}} family, including sons and male grandchildren, are portrayed in play activities {{the majority of the}} time. <b>Interestingly,</b> young female members of the family are depicted similarly in play activities, but nevertheless tend to be more likely shown in activities related to chores and child-care. In addition, the image of the grandparent has been largely nonexistent in advertising.|$|E
5|$|Recently an {{alternative}} proteasome was identified in human cells that lack the α3 core subunit. These proteasomes (known as the α4-α4 proteasomes) instead form 20S core particles containing an additional α4 subunit {{in place of}} the missing α3 subunit. <b>Interestingly,</b> these alternative 'α4-α4' proteasomes have been known previously to exist in yeast. Although the precise function of these proteasome isoforms is still largely unknown, cells expressing these proteasomes show enhanced resistance to toxicity induced by metallic ions such as cadmium.|$|E
5|$|The Wolfpack {{lost its}} fourth {{straight}} game {{to remain the}} only ACC team winless in conference play (ACC: 0–4). The favorite Terrapins once again struggled against an underdog opponent, but managed to edge the Wolfpack and secure a sixth win for bowl eligibility. With it, Maryland was ranked {{for the first time}} since 2006, at 25th on the Associated Press and USA Today Coaches' Poll rankings. <b>Interestingly,</b> the fan poll ESPNU Allstate Standings had the Terrapins ranked 14th in the nation, ahead of AP first-ranked Texas and fourth-ranked Oklahoma.|$|E
5|$|The olive baboon also {{actively}} hunts prey, {{from small}} rodents and hares to foxes and other primates. Its limit is usually small antelope, such as Thomson's gazelle and also, rarely, sheep, goats, and live chickens, which may amount to 33.5% of its food from hunting. Hunting {{is usually a}} group activity, with {{both males and females}} participating. <b>Interestingly,</b> this systematic predation was apparently developed recently. In a field study, such behavior was observed as starting with the males of one troop and spreading through all ages and sexes.|$|E
5|$|The place-name 'Blyth' {{is first}} attested in 1130 as 'Blida', and takes {{its name from}} the river Blyth. The river-name comes from the Old English {{adjective}} 'blithe' meaning 'gentle' or 'merry', and still used today. <b>Interestingly,</b> the town of Blyth is referred to as 'Blithmuth' in 1236 and 'Blithemuth' in 1250. Had this name persisted, the town would today be referred to as 'Blythmouth', on the analogy of Tynemouth to the south.|$|E
5|$|Two {{species are}} IUCN Vulnerable: the desert {{tortoise}} (California and Nevada) and the gopher tortoise (Georgia, also the official tortoise of Florida). Three species are Near Threatened: the diamondback terrapin (Maryland), the ornate box turtle (Kansas), {{and the common}} box turtle (Missouri with the three-toed subspecies, North Carolina and Tennessee with the eastern subspecies). All the remaining state reptile species are Least Concern. <b>Interestingly,</b> all the non-turtle reptiles fall into this category, but the only two turtles in relative safety are the common snapping turtle (New York) and the painted turtle (Colorado, Illinois, Michigan, Vermont).|$|E
5|$|Altar Q is {{the most}} famous {{monument}} at Copán. It was dedicated by king Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat in AD776 and has {{each of the first}} 16 kings of the Copán dynasty carved around its side. Each figure is depicted seated on his name glyph. A hieroglyphic text is inscribed on the upper surface, relating the founding of the dynasty in AD426427. On one side, it shows the dynastic founder K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' transferring power to Yax Pasaj. <b>Interestingly,</b> Tatiana Proskouriakoff first discovered the inscription on the West Side of Altar Q that tells us the date of the inauguration of Yax Pasaj. This portrayal of political succession tells us much about Early Classic Maya culture.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the weak}} {{interaction}} was once described by Fermi's theory, {{the discovery of}} parity violation and renormalization theory suggested that a new approach was needed. In 1957, Robert Marshak and George Sudarshan and, somewhat later, Richard Feynman and Murray Gell-Mann proposed a V−A (vector minus axial vector or left-handed) Lagrangian for weak interactions. In this theory, the weak interaction acts only on left-handed particles (and right-handed antiparticles). Since the mirror reflection of a left-handed particle is right-handed, this explains the maximal violation of parity. <b>Interestingly,</b> the V−A theory was developed before {{the discovery of the}} Z boson, so it did not include the right-handed fields that enter in the neutral current interaction.|$|E
5|$|The {{earlier and}} more basal genus Huayangosaurus from the Middle Jurassic of China (some 165 {{million years ago}} – Mya) antedates Stegosaurus by 20 million years {{and is the only}} genus in the family Huayangosauridae. Earlier still is Scelidosaurus, from Early Jurassic England, which lived about 190Mya. <b>Interestingly,</b> it possessed {{features}} of both stegosaurs and ankylosaurs. Emausaurus from Germany was another small quadruped, while Scutellosaurus from Arizona was an even earlier genus and was facultatively bipedal. These small, lightly armored dinosaurs were closely related to the direct ancestor of both stegosaurs and ankylosaurs. A trackway of a possible early armored dinosaur, from around 195 Mya, has been found in France.|$|E
25|$|The entire {{museum has}} been ransacked. The {{surveillance}} cameras {{there have also}} been damaged. <b>Interestingly</b> the Jnanapith award kept there has remained intact.|$|E
25|$|<b>Interestingly,</b> {{people of}} this {{religion}} {{put a lot of}} emphasis on dreams. They let dreams decide different courses of action in their lives.|$|E
25|$|Expressive Force: use of navies {{to send a}} {{political}} message. <b>Interestingly</b> this aspect of gunboat diplomacy is undervalued and almost dismissed by Cable.|$|E
25|$|The Phillips Neighborhood of Minneapolis {{was named}} after Wendell Phillips. <b>Interestingly,</b> {{it was in this}} {{neighborhood}} that the American Indian Movement was founded in 1968.|$|E
25|$|<b>Interestingly,</b> in Scott's final {{innings in}} 1798 he was bowled out by John Tufton, whose career also ended that season {{due to an}} early death in 1799.|$|E
25|$|The {{fibroblast}} {{growth factor}} receptor 1 (FGFR1) undergoes NEDD4 mediated ubiquitination and down-regulation, and <b>interestingly</b> contains a novel site (VL***PSR) that binds the C2 and WW3 domain of NEDD4.|$|E
25|$|The Hot Cookie Bakery {{located on}} Castro Street is a world-famous {{destination}} serving {{some of the}} city's most <b>interestingly</b> shaped cookies. It is especially known for its coconut macaroons.|$|E
25|$|The figure wears a belt {{around her}} waist that is tied in a knot in the front. <b>Interestingly,</b> the knot was cast {{separately}} from the torso, made from cut and hammered bronze.|$|E
25|$|Caffeine may worsen {{withdrawal}} symptoms {{because of its}} stimulatory properties. <b>Interestingly,</b> at least one animal study has shown some modulation of the benzodiazepine site by caffeine, which produces a lowering of seizure threshold.|$|E
25|$|Dietary supplementation with β-carotene was <b>interestingly</b> {{associated}} {{with an increase in}} lung cancer when it was studied in a lung cancer prevention trial in male smokers. In non-smokers, the opposite effect has been noted.|$|E
25|$|In January 2006 The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch (English for Trzy stygmaty Palmera Eldritcha) theatre {{adaptation}} premiered {{in polish}} Stary Teatr in Cracov, <b>interestingly</b> with an {{extensive use of}} lights and laser choreography.|$|E
25|$|<b>Interestingly,</b> GAPDH is encoded by {{a single}} gene that {{produces}} a single mRNA transcript with no known splice variants, though an isoform does exist as a separate gene that is expressed only in spermatozoa.|$|E
25|$|<b>Interestingly,</b> Reuvein Margolies (1889–1971) {{posited that}} there were {{originally}} seven orders of Mishnah, citing a Gaonic tradition {{on the existence of}} a seventh order containing the laws of Sta"m (scribal practice) and Berachot (blessings).|$|E
25|$|<b>Interestingly,</b> Symantec's {{corporate}} {{antivirus software}} and Norton 2010 range and beyond does work on x64 editions of Windows despite KPP's restrictions, although with less {{ability to provide}} protection against zero-day malware.|$|E
25|$|<b>Interestingly,</b> {{parasitic}} cuckoos which {{grow up in}} {{the nests}} of other species also have host specific feather lice and these seem to be transmitted only after the young cuckoos leave the host nest.|$|E
25|$|As predicted, {{by the end}} of the season, Bobby Haig was the team's top scorer (fourth in league) with 56 {{points in}} just 18 games. (<b>Interestingly,</b> the three scorers above Haig were all from league winners Altrincham).|$|E
