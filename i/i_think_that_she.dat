500|$|However, Oberman has {{continuously}} {{affirmed that}} she loved playing Chrissie, and of all her roles misses playing her the most. In a 2009 interview she commented on {{the significance of the}} character to EastEnders and viewers, saying [...] "I can't believe that I'm still recognised so much as Chrissie. I still get a lot of letters about her, too. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had as much of an impact as Janine (Charlie Brooks) did, which surprised me. Chrissie wasn't around for that long but she was an amazing character with an epic storyline." ...|$|E
500|$|Iger {{subsequently}} contacted Tom Hanks {{to consider}} {{playing the role}} of Walt Disney, which would become the first-ever depiction of Disney in a mainstream film. Hanks accepted the role, viewing it as [...] "an opportunity to play somebody as world-shifting as Picasso or Chaplin". Hanks made several visits to the Walt Disney Family Museum and interviewed some of Disney's former employees and family relatives, including his daughter Diane Disney Miller. The film was subsequently dedicated to Disney Miller, who died shortly before it was released. In April 2012, Emma Thompson entered final negotiations to star as P. L. Travers, after the studio was unable to secure Meryl Streep for the part. Thompson said that the role was the most difficult one that she has played, describing Travers as [...] "a woman of quite eye-watering complexity and contradiction." [...] "She wrote a very good essay on sadness, because she was, in fact, a very sad woman. She'd had a very rough childhood, the alcoholism of her father being part of it and the attempted suicide of her mother being another part of it. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> spent her whole life in a state of fundamental inconsolability and hence got a lot done." [...] Colin Farrell, Paul Giamatti, Jason Schwartzman, Bradley Whitford, B. J. Novak, and Ruth Wilson were cast in July 2012.|$|E
500|$|Hoping {{to divert}} {{herself from the}} grief of Cazale's death, Streep {{accepted}} a role in The Seduction of Joe Tynan (1979) as the chirpy love interest of Alan Alda, later commenting that she played it on [...] "automatic pilot". She performed the role of Katherine in The Taming of the Shrew for Shakespeare in the Park, and also played a supporting role in Manhattan (1979) for Woody Allen. Streep later said that Allen did not provide her with a complete script, giving her only the six pages of her own scenes, and did not permit her to improvise a word of her dialogue. In the drama Kramer vs. Kramer, Streep was cast opposite Dustin Hoffman as an unhappily married woman who abandons her husband and child. Streep thought that the script portrayed the female character as [...] "too evil" [...] and insisted {{that it was not}} representative of real women who faced marriage breakdown and child custody battles. The makers agreed with her, and the script was revised. In preparing for the part, Streep spoke to her own mother about her life as a wife with a career, and frequented the Upper East Side neighborhood in which the film was set, watching the interactions between parents and children. The director Robert Benton allowed Streep to write her own dialogue in two key scenes, despite some objection from Hoffman, who [...] "hated her guts". Jaffee and Hoffman later spoke of Streep's tirelessness, with Hoffman commenting, [...] "She's extraordinarily hardworking, to the extent that she's obsessive. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> thinks about nothing else but what she's doing." [...] The film was controversial among feminists, but it was a role which film critic Stephen Farber believed displayed Streep's [...] "own emotional intensity", writing that {{she was one of the}} [...] "rare performers who can imbue the most routine moments with a hint of mystery".|$|E

2500|$|Grace {{commented on}} the Amanda Knox case: [...] "I was very disturbed, because I {{think it is a}} huge {{miscarriage}} of justice. I believe that while Amanda Knox did not wield the knife herself, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was there, with her boyfriend, and that he did the deed, and that she egged him on. That's what I think happened...I just happen to know the facts...I'm not trying to get Amanda Knox's first interview becauseâ€¦ my show does not pay for interviews...Second, I don't think she's going to tell the truth anyway, so what's the point?" ...|$|E
2500|$|On June 24, 1937, Pickford {{married her}} third and last husband, actor and band leader Buddy Rogers. They adopted two children: Roxanne (born 1944, adopted 1944) and Ronald Charles (born 1937, adopted 1943, a.k.a. Ronnie Pickford Rogers). As a PBS American Experience {{documentary}} noted, Pickford's {{relationship with her}} children was tense. She criticized their physical imperfections, including Ronnie's small stature and Roxanne's crooked teeth. Both children later said their mother was too self-absorbed to provide real maternal love. In 2003, Ronnie recalled that [...] "Things didn't work out that much, you know. But I'll never forget her. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was a good woman." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Yes,' said Helen; 'but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> if <b>she</b> {{had been}} there, and I at home, I should have listened for her sake, besides that Mrs. Staunton was our own mamma's dearest friend.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Musgrave, when giving {{insight into}} the character's sexual identity, stated, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> Ashley has always been known for being unpredictable. One of her famous lines is, 'I'm not into labels.' She doesn't have one, so she's not gay, she's not straight." [...] Musgrave added, [...] "But whoever she sees love in, <b>she</b> falls for <b>that</b> person. <b>She's</b> not going for a {{physical}} package; she's going for the inner characteristics. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> important, and <b>I</b> wish that more humans could be like <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>she's</b> not worried about finding her sexual identity; it's found.

6000|$|... "No," [...] {{replied the}} first; [...] "she is a dear creature, and so {{handsome}} too--just the wife for a rising man--but <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> takes {{much interest in}} politics. Are not her dinners charming?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One cannot tell. And when I {{hear that}} a woman is {{separated}} from her husband, <b>I</b> always <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> must have been imprudent. It may be uncharitable, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it is most safe so to consider." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] said Eunice, {{pressing}} {{her hand to}} her side, [...] "if I saw her I should die. <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had come for me as she said she would. O God! have mercy on me, I am dying." ...|$|R
