500|$|In 2013, Streep starred {{alongside}} Julia Roberts and Ewan McGregor in {{the black}} comedy drama [...] (2013) about a dysfunctional family that reunites into the familial house when their patriarch suddenly disappears. Based on Tracy Letts's Pulitzer Prize-winning , Streep received positive reviews for her portrayal of the family's strong-willed and contentious matriarch, who is suffering from oral cancer and an addiction to narcotics, and was subsequently nominated for another Golden Globe, SAG, and Academy Award. At the National Board of Review Awards in 2013, Streep labeled Walt Disney as [...] "anti-semitic" [...] and a [...] "gender bigot". Former actors, employees and animators who knew Disney during his lifetime rebuffed the comments as misinformed and selective. The Walt Disney Family Museum issued a statement rebuking Streep's allegations indirectly, citing, among others, Disney's contributions to Jewish charities and his published letters stating that women [...] "have the right to <b>expect</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> chances for advancement as men". However, Disney's grandniece, Abigail Disney, wholeheartedly agreed with Streep's statements, stating {{that he was an}} [...] "anti-Semite" [...] and [...] "racist" [...] who was also an exemplary filmmaker whose work [...] "made billions of people happy".|$|E

500|$|Chris Cabin at Collider {{called the}} short film [...] "dark, funny, {{and just a}} bit punkish", and {{compared}} it to a Saturday Night Live skit. He {{thought it was a}} smart move from Fox to release [...] "a taste of what [...] love" [...] about the first film to abate fears and rumors following the replacement of Miller with Leitch. Cabin also said it was impressive and clever that the studio managed to keep the short a surprise for general audiences to discover at the theater. Matt Rooney at JoBlo.com called the teaser great, and [...] "a great way to keep the buzz going for" [...] Deadpool 2 despite not actually revealing anything about that film. Matthew Monagle of Screen Crush said the short proves that the first Deadpool was [...] "not a one-hit wonder for Reynolds and company", and praised its jokes. He also noted its release with Logan as another connection being made by Fox between its X-Men films and Deadpool, pointing toward future crossovers between the two. The Verge's Andrew Liptak said the short was [...] "a fun one", noting the visual gags in the background and the Stan Lee cameo, and saying, [...] "At the very least, [...] we can <b>expect</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> irreverent humor in" [...] Deadpool 2 as was in the first film.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{scholars}} {{argue that}} the amount of emotional work required between all levels of government is on the local level. It is at the level of cities and counties that the responsibility lies for day to day emergency preparedness, firefighters, law enforcement, public education, public health, and family and children's services. Citizens in a community <b>expect</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> level of satisfaction from their government, as they receive in a customer service-oriented job. This takes a considerate amount of work for both employees and employers in the field of public administration. There are two comparisons that represent emotional labor within public administration, [...] "Rational Work versus Emotion Work", and [...] "Emotional Labor versus Emotional Intelligence." ...|$|E
2500|$|Giddens' agents follow {{previous}} psychoanalysis {{work done}} by Sigmund Freud and others. Agency, as Giddens calls it, is human action. To be human {{is to be an}} agent (not all agents are human). Agency is critical to both the reproduction and the transformation of society. Another way to explain this concept is by what Giddens calls the [...] "reflexive monitoring of actions." [...] "Reflexive monitoring" [...] refers to agents' ability to monitor their actions and those actions' settings and contexts. Monitoring is an essential characteristic of agency. Agents subsequently [...] "rationalize," [...] or evaluate, the success of those efforts. All humans engage in this process, and <b>expect</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> from others. Through action, agents produce structures; through reflexive monitoring and rationalization, they transform them. To act, agents must be motivated, must be knowledgeable must be able to rationalize the action; and must reflexively monitor the action.|$|E

2500|$|Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said, {{while visiting}} Romania, that Iran expects a new {{government}} to respect the JCPOA. [...] "It is our norm not to interfere in the domestic affairs of other countries.

We are certain the international community would <b>expect</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> thing from the United States of America." [...] Foreign Ministry Spokesman Bahram Qassemi also said that U.S. policies in the past decades brought about [...] "an unpleasant, bitter experience" [...] for Iran. [...] "What is important to Iran and its people, and would be used by them as evaluation criteria, is the next US administration’s future performance and executive policies." [...] He added that the policies of previous administrations, including intervention in the Middle East, are the “main factor behind the escalation of tensions." [...] As such, he called for a review of its policies vis-à-vis other regions.|$|E
2500|$|The {{area has}} also been {{utilized}} during times when security concerns {{make it difficult to}} allow the use of the outdoor prayer plaza, such as the March 19, 2009 visit of Pope Benedict XVI to the Wall and Temple Mount. Despite the fact that the Pope's visit coincided with the Jewish festival of Lag B'Omer, the decision had been made to close the Wall and not allow services, but {{at the request of the}} Wall's rabbi, Shmuel Rabinowitz, the government allowed worship to be conducted in the area within the Arch. The original decision to close the entire prayer area to Jewish worship had begun to elicit negative reaction as soon as the decision was announced, between one and two months before the visit. Rabbi Rabinowitz, protesting the decision, was quoted as saying that [...] "It's inconceivable that the pope's visit would hurt worshippers at the Western Wall, some of whom have been praying there daily." [...] Part of the reaction was a threat to assemble and protest on the part of some Israelis, saying the police would have to [...] "drag" [...] them out of the area. News articles quoted one comment that, [...] "Just like the visit of a chief rabbi at the Vatican doesn't cause the Vatican to shut down, we <b>expect</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> approach when the pope visits a place holy to the Jewish people." [...] The decision to utilize the prayer area within Wilson's Arch, allowing worship during the Pope's visit, was eventually announced by the Israel Police and the Israel Security Agency (ISA/Shin Bet). Worshippers were allowed into the main plaza during the hours prior to the Pope's scheduled arrival, but moved into the enclosed Wilson's Arch prayer before his actual arrival.|$|E
