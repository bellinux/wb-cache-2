50|$|The {{importance}} of catalytic dehydrogenation of paraffin <b>hydrocarbons</b> to <b>olefins</b> {{has been growing}} steadily in recent years. Light olefins, such as butenes, are important raw materials for the synthesis of polymers, gasoline additives and various other petrochemical products. The cracking processes especially fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracker produce high-purity mono-olefins, such as 1-butene or butadiene. Despite such processes, currently more research is focused on developing alternatives such as oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) for two reasons: (1) undesired reactions take place at high temperature leading to coking and catalyst deactivation, making frequent regeneration of the catalyst unavoidable, (2) it consumes {{a large amount of}} heat and requires high reaction temperatures.

Semi-volatile and particle-phase organic compounds in the diluted source emissions are collected simultaneously by both a traditional filter/PUF (polyurethane foam) sampling train and by an advanced organic compound-based denuder/filter/PUF sampling train to provide information on the gas/particle phase distribution of the semi-volatile organic compounds.

The need for more abundant energy sources {{to take over the}} role of crude oil {{is becoming more and more}} present. GTL processes (gas-to-liquid), which utilizes the natural gas resources, are interesting replacements for the production of fuels in the future. One GTL process,the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS), produces fuel precursors by reacting a gaseous stream consisting of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. The objective in this thesis was the fabrication of iron catalysts to enhance the production of desired products of the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. Products like long chained <b>hydrocarbons</b> and <b>oleﬁns</b> are desired, because they can later be reﬁned into fuels like petrol and diesel. The effects of different promoter materials were studied, and it was decided to prepare the iron catalysts with small amounts of potassium and copper. All catalysts were prepared using the incipient wetness method with alumina support. In addition to testing the catalysts in a Fischer-Tropsch rig, the catalysts were also characterized using CO chemisorption and physisorption. Some of the catalysts did not disperse the iron well on the support surface. This could indicate the metal piling up in multiple layers on the surface. One reason for this could be the method of preparation, with drying and calcining after each impregnation step. Potassium proved to be the promoter material with largest implications regarding selectivity towards long chained <b>hydrocarbons</b> and <b>oleﬁns.</b> Copper was originally added to yield higher activities and conversionrates for the catalysts, but these effects did not show for the experiments. It was instead another factor, namely a higher amount of iron in the catalysts, which proved to have the greatest impact on conversionrates. Most of the catalysts run in the Fischer-Tropsch rig were activated with hydrogen at high temperatures. Two catalysts were in addition activated with synthesis gas, and though they had high selectivities towards oleﬁns, these came at very low activities...|$|R

For ASE, recoveries between 42 % and 85 % were obtained {{for the majority of the}} compounds. However, due to the high pressure, all volatile compounds were lost. In opposite, QuEChERS extraction allowed detection and quantification of all the compounds with recoveries between 60 % and 100 %. Moreover, no additional clean up by dispersive SPE on PSA was necessary, which allowed reducing the cost of the analysis. Performance of the method was assessed. The method was linear over the range of concentration of 10 - 5000 μg kg− 1. Precision, expressed as intra-day precision and inter-day variation was verified at three concentrations.

A single-shot high voltage advanced dielectric test stand (HVADTS) was designed and built to test these oils. The HVADTS is capable of applying a 250 kV pulse with a 1 -cos rise-time of 1. 6 us to a pressurized oil dielectric. Numerous oil chemistries were evaluated, including straight-chain <b>hydrocarbons</b> and branched <b>olefins,</b> silicone and ester fluids, alkylbenzene and transformer oil. Following the oil chemistry evaluation, a high-K particle dielectric was added in concentrations up to 5 % (by weight) to the best-performing fluids. Parameters such as particle concentration, gap spacing, electrode surface conditions and ambient fluid pressure are investigated experimentally. The experimental analysis is supported by PIC electrostatic simulations and a suite of diagnostics such as SEM imagery, optical profilometry, water titration, mass-spectrometry, and particle measurements. This dissertation discusses several methods to successfully reduce the switch jitter of a self-break oil switch...|$|R
40|$|Using a reactor {{in which}} the coal is {{physically}} separated from the solid catalyst by a porous wall permeable to the hydrogen donor solvent, it was shown that direct contact between the catalyst and the coal is not required for catalyzed coal liquefaction. This occurs however only {{when there is a}} hydrogen atmosphere, as liquefaction with catalyst participation does not occur in a nitrogen atmosphere. Liquefaction by hydrogen transfer from the donor solvent itself does occur. This suggests that there is transfer of hydrogen from the catalyst to the coal via the solvent. The character of the solvent makes a significant difference, the better solvents being good hydrogen donors. These results indicate that the role of the catalyst may be to regenerate the spent hydrogen donor solvent during the liquefaction process. The peak temperature for volatiles evolution {{has been shown to be}} a reproducible measure of the coal rank. This was shown by an excellent correlation (R 2 = 0. 998) between peak volatiles temperatures (by TGA) and vitrinite reflectance. Using TG/MS, the volatiles contents of coals of a wide range of ranks was determined. The low rank coals emit largely phenols and some other oxygen compounds and olefins. The higher rank coals emit largely aromatic <b>hydrocarbons</b> and some <b>olefins...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} of carbonaceous deposits that occurs during the aromatization of C 4 –C 7 paraffin and <b>olefin</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> is visualized in a space- and time-resolved manner over individual micron-sized H-ZSM- 5 zeolite crystals. In situ UV–vis and confocal fluorescence micro-spectroscopy techniques are applied in a comparative study {{for each individual}} light naphtha component. Optical microphotograph image analysis shows how crystal coloration depends on the reactant molecule. The corresponding absorption measurements confirm that olefinic hydrocarbons generate a pronounced coke deposition. Two main UV–vis bands, located at around 420 and 500 nm, thereby shape the absorption spectrum profile and are assigned to aromatic and poly aromatic species. Increasing reactant chain length results in more extended coke deposits, while the introduction of methyl branching generates conjugated carbonaceous species of similar confined size. The larger coke deposits predominantly locate within the straight channels of the H-ZSM- 5 zeolite catalyst, as demonstrated by polarization-dependent UV–vis micro-spectroscopy. In situ confocal fluorescence microscopy reveals spatial heterogeneities of photo-excited coke species between the olefin and paraffin reactants. Paraffinic reactants convert mainly at the crystal boundary region, while olefinic hydrocarbons cause the build-up of fluorescent coke compounds within the crystal core. Different fluorescence patterns are obtained when varying the laser excitation wavelengths, thereby detecting fluorescent emitting species having a different conjugation degree...|$|R
