5|$|Legumes such as clover or alfalfa {{are usually}} higher <b>in</b> <b>protein,</b> calcium, and energy than grasses. However, they require warm weather and good soil {{to produce the}} best nutrients. Legume hays are {{generally}} higher <b>in</b> <b>protein</b> than the grass hays. They are also higher in minerals, particularly calcium, but have an incorrect ratio of calcium to phosphorus. Because they are high <b>in</b> <b>protein,</b> they are very desirable for growing horses or those subjected to very hard work, but the calcium:phosphorus ratio must be balanced by other feeds to prevent bone abnormalities.|$|E

5|$|Four {{subspecies}} of cowpea are recognised, {{of which}} three are cultivated. There {{is a high}} level of morphological diversity found within the species with large variations in the size, shape and structure of the plant. Cowpeas can be erect, semi erect (trailing) or climbing. The crop is mainly grown for its seeds, which are extremely high <b>in</b> <b>protein,</b> although the leaves and immature seed pods can also be consumed.|$|E
5|$|In North American and European populations, around 4–8% {{of people}} have a thrombophilia, most {{commonly}} factor V leiden and prothrombin G20210A. For populations in China, Japan, and Thailand, deficiences <b>in</b> <b>protein</b> S, protein C, and antithrombin predominate. Non-O blood type is present in around 50% {{of the general population}} and varies with ethnicity, and it is present in about 70% of those with VTE. Altogether, global data is incomplete.|$|E
5|$|Microorganisms are {{essential}} tools in biotechnology, biochemistry, genetics, and molecular biology. The yeasts brewer's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) are important model organisms in science, {{since they are}} simple eukaryotes that can be grown rapidly in large numbers and are easily manipulated. They are particularly valuable in genetics, genomics and proteomics, for example <b>in</b> <b>protein</b> production.|$|E
50|$|Tandem repeats {{occur in}} DNA when {{a pattern of}} one or more {{nucleotides}} is repeated and the repetitions are directly adjacent to each other. Several protein domains also form tandem repeats within their amino acid primary structure, such as Armadillo repeats. However, <b>in</b> <b>proteins,</b> perfect tandem repeats are unlikely in most <b>in</b> vivo <b>proteins,</b> and most known repeats are <b>in</b> <b>proteins</b> which have been designed.|$|R
40|$|A simple {{technique}} {{was developed for}} the specific reversible modification of guanidino groups <b>in</b> <b>proteins</b> involving reaction with ninhydrin.

40|$|Motivation: To {{test whether}} protein folding {{constraints}} and secondary structure sequence preferences {{significantly reduce the}} space of amino acid words <b>in</b> <b>proteins,</b> we compared the frequencies of four- and five-amino acid word clumps (independent words) <b>in</b> <b>proteins</b> to the frequencies predicted by four random sequence models...|$|R
5|$|One {{surprising}} {{prediction of}} the permutation by duplication mechanism is that intermediate permutations can occur. For instance, the duplicated {{version of the}} protein should still be functional, since otherwise evolution would quickly select against such proteins. Likewise, partially duplicated intermediates where only one terminus was truncated should be functional. Such intermediates have been extensively documented <b>in</b> <b>protein</b> families such as DNA methyltransferases.|$|E
5|$|Some {{cultures}} revere the elk as {{a spiritual}} force. In parts of Asia, antlers and their velvet are used in traditional medicines. Elk are hunted as a game species. The meat is leaner and higher <b>in</b> <b>protein</b> than beef or chicken.|$|E
5|$|Specialized export {{proteins}} {{exist for}} translocation of mature mRNA and tRNA to the cytoplasm after post-transcriptional modification is complete. This quality-control mechanism is important due to these molecules' central role <b>in</b> <b>protein</b> translation. Mis-expression of a protein due to incomplete excision of exons or mis-incorporation of amino acids could have negative {{consequences for the}} cell; thus, incompletely modified RNA that reaches the cytoplasm is degraded rather than used in translation.|$|E
50|$|PCMB {{reacts with}} thiol groups <b>in</b> <b>proteins</b> and is {{therefore}} an inhibitor of enzymes that are dependent on thiol reactivity, including cysteine proteases such as papain and acetylcholinesterase. Because of this reactivity with thiols, PCMB is also used in titrimetric quantification of thiol groups <b>in</b> <b>proteins.</b>|$|R
50|$|Carboxylation in {{biochemistry}} is a posttranslational {{modification of}} glutamate residues, to γ-carboxyglutamate, <b>in</b> <b>proteins.</b> It occurs primarily <b>in</b> <b>proteins</b> involved <b>in</b> the blood clotting cascade, specifically factors II, VII, IX, and X, protein C, and protein S, and also <b>in</b> some bone <b>proteins.</b> This modification {{is required for}} these proteins to function.

5|$|A {{comparative}} study of the amino acid composition of eleven Portuguese wild edible mushroom species showed Boletus edulis to have the highest total amino acid content, about 2.3g per 100g of dried mushroom. This total includes {{a full complement of}} 20 essential and nonessential amino acids. Analysis of the free amino acids (that is, those not bound up <b>in</b> <b>protein)</b> revealed glutamine and alanine to be the principal amino acids (each about 25% of total compounds); a separate analysis concluded that lysine is another predominant compound.|$|E
5|$|A few {{theoretical}} physicists {{have argued}} that classical physics is intrinsically incapable of explaining the holistic aspects of consciousness, but that quantum theory may provide the missing ingredients. Several theorists have therefore proposed quantum mind (QM) theories of consciousness. Notable theories falling into this category include the holonomic brain theory of Karl Pribram and David Bohm, and the Orch-OR theory formulated by Stuart Hameroff and Roger Penrose. Some of these QM theories offer descriptions of phenomenal consciousness, as well as QM interpretations of access consciousness. None of the quantum mechanical theories has been confirmed by experiment. Recent publications by G. Guerreshi, J. Cia, S. Popescu, and H. Briegel could falsify proposals {{such as those of}} Hameroff, which rely on quantum entanglement <b>in</b> <b>protein.</b> At the present time many scientists and philosophers consider the arguments for an important role of quantum phenomena to be unconvincing.|$|E

5|$|About 5% of {{all people}} are {{diagnosed}} only when they develop fulminant acute liver failure, often {{in the context of}} a hemolytic anemia (anemia due to the destruction of red blood cells). This leads to abnormalities <b>in</b> <b>protein</b> production (identified by deranged coagulation) and metabolism by the liver. The deranged protein metabolism leads to the accumulation of waste products such as ammonia in the bloodstream. When these irritate the brain, the person develops hepatic encephalopathy (confusion, coma, seizures and finally life-threatening swelling of the brain).|$|E
5|$|Both {{internal}} and external signals {{can lead to the}} induction of apoptosis, or programmed cell death. The resulting deconstruction of cellular components is primarily carried out by specialized proteases known as caspases, but the proteasome also plays important and diverse roles in the apoptotic process. The involvement of the proteasome in this process is indicated by both the increase <b>in</b> <b>protein</b> ubiquitination, and of E1, E2, and E3 enzymes that is observed well in advance of apoptosis. During apoptosis, proteasomes localized to the nucleus have also been observed to translocate to outer membrane blebs characteristic of apoptosis.|$|E
5|$|Chemically, the perxenate {{compounds}} {{are used}} as oxidizing agents in analytical chemistry. Xenon difluoride is used as an etchant for silicon, particularly {{in the production of}} microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). The anticancer drug 5-fluorouracil can be produced by reacting xenon difluoride with uracil. Xenon is also used <b>in</b> <b>protein</b> crystallography. Applied at pressures from 0.5 to 5MPa (5 to 50atm) to a protein crystal, xenon atoms bind in predominantly hydrophobic cavities, often creating a high-quality, isomorphous, heavy-atom derivative {{that can be used for}} solving the phase problem.|$|E

40|$|A {{simple and}} rapid method was {{developed}} for the determination of 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenylalanine (dopa) and 5 -S-cysteinyl- 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenylalanine (5 -S-cysteinyldopa) <b>in</b> <b>proteins</b> {{with the use of}} high-pressure liquid chromatography. With this method, it is demonstrated that mushroom tyrosinase can catalyse hydroxylation of tyrosine residues <b>in</b> <b>proteins</b> to dopa and subsequent oxidation to dopaquinone residues. The dopaquinone residues <b>in</b> <b>proteins</b> combine with cysteine residues to form 5 -S-cysteinyldopa in bovine serum albumin and yeast alcohol dehydrogenase, whereas dopa is the major product in bovine insulin, which lacks cysteine residues...|$|R
40|$|Fluctuations in the {{polypeptide}} chain lead to disorder <b>in</b> <b>proteins</b> {{and to a}} distribution in the parameters that regulate their functions. Using low temperature (to reduce the fluctuations) and narrow-band lasers (to select one substate among the many forms), high-resolution absorption and fluorescence spectra for chromophores <b>in</b> <b>proteins</b> can be obtained.

5|$|Depending {{on their}} feeding habits, {{termites}} are placed into two groups: the lower termites and higher termites. The lower termites predominately feed on wood. As wood {{is difficult to}} digest, termites prefer to consume fungus-infected wood because {{it is easier to}} digest and the fungi are high <b>in</b> <b>protein.</b> Meanwhile, the higher termites consume a wide variety of materials, including faeces, humus, grass, leaves and roots. The gut in the lower termites contains many species of bacteria along with protozoa, while the higher termites only have a few species of bacteria with no protozoa.|$|E
5|$|Essential {{genes are}} {{the set of}} genes thought to be {{critical}} for an organism's survival. This definition assumes the abundant availability of all relevant nutrients {{and the absence of}} environmental stress. Only a small portion of an organism's genes are essential. In bacteria, an estimated 250–400 genes are essential for Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, which is less than 10% of their genes. Half of these genes are orthologs in both organisms and are largely involved <b>in</b> <b>protein</b> synthesis. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae the number of essential genes is slightly higher, at 1000 genes (~20% of their genes). Although the number is more difficult to measure in higher eukaryotes, mice and humans are estimated to have around 2000 essential genes (~10% of their genes). The synthetic organism, Syn 3, has a minimal genome of 473 essential genes and quasi-essential genes (necessary for fast growth), although 149 have unknown function.|$|E
5|$|Experiments {{have shown}} that when more pollen {{is applied to the}} stigma, as well as the fruit {{containing}} more seeds and being larger (the xenia effect mentioned above), the germination of the seeds is also faster and more likely, and the seedlings are larger. Various combinations of mineral nutrients and light have a significant effect during the various stages of plant growth. These effects vary significantly between the different species of Cucurbita. A type of stored phosphorus called phytate forms in seed tissues as spherical crystalline intrusions <b>in</b> <b>protein</b> bodies called globoids. Along with other nutrients, phytate is used completely during seedling growth. Heavy metal contamination, including cadmium, has a significant negative impact on plant growth. Cucurbita plants grown in the spring tend to grow larger than those grown in the autumn.|$|E
