25|$|Evolution, like prohibition, {{is a broad}} term. In recent bickering, however, {{evolution}} has been understood to mean the theory which holds that man has developed from some pre-existing lower type.

25|$|The above formula {{assumes that}} the source is either {{directly}} approaching or receding from the observer. If the source approaches the observer at an angle (but still with a constant velocity), the observed frequency that is first <b>heard</b> <b>is</b> higher than the object's emitted frequency. Thereafter, there is a monotonic decrease in the observed frequency as it gets closer to the observer, through equality when it is coming from a direction perpendicular to the relative motion (and was emitted {{at the point of}} closest approach; but when the wave is received, the source and observer will no longer be at their closest), and a continued monotonic decrease as it recedes from the observer. When the observer is very close to the path of the object, the transition from high to low frequency is very abrupt. When the observer is far from the path of the object, the transition from high to low frequency is gradual.|$|E

At {{the beginning of the}} movie, when young Carl is in the movie theater watching a newsreel about Muntz, the first piece of music <b>heard</b> <b>is</b> [...] "Muntz's Theme", which starts out as a celebratory theme, and echoes through the film when Muntz reappears 70years later. [...] "Ellie's Theme" [...] is first heard when she is introduced as a little kid and plays several times during the film in different versions; for instance, during the sequence where Carl lifts his house with the balloons, the theme is changed from a simple piano melody to a full orchestral arrangement.

2500|$|It was {{announced}} on August 12, 2014, that Warner Bros. had hired screenwriters Will Beall and Kurt Johnstad to pen two separate scripts {{for an upcoming}} Aquaman film.

2500|$|The {{scene in}} Beauty and the Beast {{during which the}} song is <b>heard</b> <b>is</b> the moment when Belle and the Beast's true {{feelings}} for each other are finally established. Set in the ballroom of the Beast's castle, [...] "Beauty and the Beast" [...] is performed by the character Mrs. Potts, an enchanted teapot, midway through the film as she explains the feeling of love to her young teacup son Chip, referring to the emotion as [...] "a tale as old as time". According to Armen Karaoghlanian of Interiors, [...] "Belle familiarizes the Beast with the waltz and as soon he feels comfortable, he gracefully moves her across the floor". Afterwards, the song continues to play instrumentally as Belle and the Beast retire to the balcony for a romantic candlelit dinner. Believed to be the [...] "centerpiece that brings Beauty and her Beast together," [...] the sequence offers an insight into both characters' psyches. From the Beast's perspective, it is the moment he realizes {{that he wants to}} confess his true feelings for Belle to her and [...] "decides he wants to tell Belle he is in love with her." [...] Meanwhile, Belle begins {{to fall in love with}} her captor. Writing for The Globe and Mail, Jennie Punter reviewed it as the scene in which [...] "romance finally blossoms." [...] Film critic Ellison Estefan, writing for Estefan Films, believes that the sequence is responsible for [...] "add another dimension to the characters as they continue to fall deeply in love with each other." [...] Explaining the song's role in the film, director Kirk Wise described the scene as [...] "the culmination of their relationship," [...] while producer Don Hahn pegged it as [...] "the bonding moment of the film when the two main characters finally get together." [...] The scene had long been envisioned as having a more live-action feel to it than the rest of the film, an idea that originated from story artists Brenda Chapman and Roger Allers, who were the first to suggest that the ballroom be built using computers. As the film's executive producer, former Head of Disney's film division Jeffrey Katzenberg recalled that he began working on Beauty and the Beast deciding what its [...] "wowie" [...] moment would be, defining this as [...] "the moment in the movie where you see what's on the screen and go, 'Wow-IEE'"; this ultimately became the film's ballroom sequence. According to Hahn, the scene was conceived out of the filmmakers' desire to manipulate the camera in order to [...] "sweep" [...] the audience away. Allers and Chapman conceived the ballroom in order to provide the characters with an area in which they could linger, and were surprised by the amount of artistic freedom with which they were provided by the animators, who agreed to adjust to the changes in perspective that would result from the moving camera. While Allers decided to raise the camera in order to view the dancing couple from the overhead chandelier, Chapman decided to rotate the camera around Belle's skirt as the couple danced past it.|$|E
