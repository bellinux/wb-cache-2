5|$|Nojpetén fell to a Spanish {{assault on}} 13 March 1697, more than 150 {{years after the}} conquest {{of the rest of}} the Yucatán Peninsula and more than 160 years after the conquest of the Guatemalan Highlands. The lengthy delay in conquering the Petén region was due to a {{combination}} of its <b>geographical</b> <b>remoteness</b> and inhospitality and the fierce reputation of its Maya inhabitants. During this time the Itza used the Yalain as an eastern buffer against Spanish approach from Belize. The lengthy indirect contact between the Itza and the Spanish invaders allowed the Itza to develop an understanding of Spanish strategy and tactics that was honed over the period of almost two centuries that the Itza were surrounded by European-dominated territories. This understanding distinguished the conquest of Petén from the 16th-century conquests of the Aztecs, Maya and Incas. In contrast, the Spanish had a very poor understanding of the Itza and their neighbours and viewed them as ignorant savages whose kingdom was protected by Satan from the Christianising efforts of the Spanish Empire and the Roman Catholic Church. From the time that Hernán Cortés crossed Petén in the early 16th century, the Spanish mistakenly believed the king of the Itza (the Aj Kan Ek) was the overlord of the entire central Petén region.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} whether HPV vaccine coverage in 12 – 13 -year-olds varies by <b>geographical</b> area, <b>remoteness</b> and ecological level indicators of socioeconomic status (SES). Method: Data from the National HPV Vaccination Program Register (NHVPR) were analysed at Statistical Local Area (SLA) level, by the Index of Relative Disadvantage (IRSD) and the Australian Standard <b>Geographical</b> Classication <b>Remoteness</b> Structure. Results: Nationally, 73 % of females aged 12 – 13 years in 2007 were fully vaccinated against HPV. Coverage in low SES areas (71. 5 %) was 4. 1 percentage points lower than coverage in high SES areas (75. 6 %). Uptake of the rst two doses was {{higher in the}} very remote parts of Australia (dose 1 – 88. 5 %, dose 2 – 81. 8 %) than in major cities (dose 1 – 83. 4 %, dose 2 – 80. 2 %), but not for dose 3 where coverage in major cities was 3 % higher (73. 6 % versus 71. 4 %). Conclusion: Notications of HPV vaccine doses delivered to females aged 12 – 13 through schools suggest a high and relatively equal uptake across socioeconomic groups. Females in remote regions have the highest uptake of dose 1 but are least likely to complete the course. This {{may be due to}} particular challenges in vaccine delivery to residents of remote areas.

40|$|Foreword The {{development}} {{over the}} last decade of geographical classifications for Australia that describe areas in terms of relative remoteness has provided an opportunity to compare a wide range of health and welfare indicators across Australia’s major cities, regional and remote areas. This publication reviews the methodology behind the three major classifications that describe areas in this way—the RRMA (Rural, Remote and Metropolitan Areas) classification, the ARIA (Accessibility/Remoteness Index of Australia) classification and the ASGC (Australian Standard <b>Geographical</b> Classification) <b>Remoteness</b> Areas classification. This publication also summarises each classification’s strengths and weaknesses and describes how the classifications are applied to administrative and survey data...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} use of two {{alternative}} population-based denominators in calculating HPV vaccine coverage in Australia by age groups, jurisdiction and remoteness areas. Method: Data from the National HPV Vaccination Program Register (NHVPR) were analysed at Local Government Area (LGA) level, by state/territory and by the Australian Standard <b>Geographical</b> Classification <b>Remoteness</b> Structure. The proportion of females vaccinated was calculated using both the ABS ERP and Medicare enrolments as the denominator. Results: HPV vaccine coverage estimates were slightly higher using Medicare enrolments than using the ABS estimated resident population nationally (70. 8 % compared with 70. 4 % for 12 to 17 -year-old females, and 33. 3 % compared with 31. 9 % for 18 to 26 -year-old females, respectively.) The greatest differences in coverage {{were found in the}} remote areas of Australia. Conclusion: There is minimal difference between coverage estimates made using the two denominators except in Remote and Very Remote areas where small residential populations make interpretation more difficult. Adoption of Medicare enrolments for the denominator in the ongoing program would make minimal, if any, difference to routine coverage estimates. Bianca Barbaro, Julia M. L. Brotherto...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{this study}} an attempt {{is made to}} support the fact that focus on {{numerical}} growth is not sufficient unless it is joined with the equality {{in the quality of}} human life. This study has been conducted in the Indian Himalayan region. Himalayan region is a hilly and mountainous region. This region is generally considered underdeveloped in the country though rich in life giving resources because of different agro-climatic condition and diverse ecosystems. Due to <b>geographical</b> barriers, <b>remoteness</b> and sparse population, this area reduces its political influence and remains always away from the eyes of policy makers. The technologies that serve {{other parts of the country}} become unviable in this region due to its terrain and remoteness. This study is based on firsthand information. Inequality in the consumption expenditure of food, non-food and income has been calculated to provide the factual position of the problem. A sample of 549 households of different categories viz; general category, scheduled caste, scheduled tribe & other backward classes consisting 2, 655 persons has been selected by taking into consideration the different social stratification. This study shows that, though, the Himalayan region is developing at a slow pace but inequality is increasing at a higher rate.

40|$|Background: It is {{not known}} whether {{improvements}} in cancer survival over recent decades have benefited children from different geographic locations equally. This is the first study to produce national survival estimates for childhood cancer in Australia by remoteness of residence and area-based socioeconomic status. Methods: The study utilized population-based data from the Australian Paediatric Cancer Registry for children diagnosed with cancer from 1996 onward who were at risk of mortality between January 2001 and December 2006 (n = 6, 289). Remoteness was specified according to the Australian Standard <b>Geographical</b> Classification <b>Remoteness</b> Areas, whereas an index of area disadvantage was obtained from census information. Five-year relative survival estimates were produced by the period method for all cancers and the most common diagnostic groups, with corresponding age-sex adjusted mortality hazard ratios calculated using Poisson regression. Results: Overall, children with cancer from remote/very remote areas had a significantly lower survival rate {{than their counterparts in}} major cities (HR = 1. 55, 95 % CI = 1. 08 - 2. 23). Survival was also lower for children with leukemia living in inner regional (HR = 1. 52, 95 % CI = 1. 11 - 2. 08) or outer regional areas (HR = 1. 53, 95 % CI = 1. 03 - 2. 28). There was weak evidence (Pgrad = 0. 051) of a trend toward poorer survival by greater area disadvantage for all childhood cancers. Conclusions: Some variation in prognosis by place of residence was present for children with cancer in Australia, particularly among leukemia patients. Impact: Treatment, clinical or area-related factors that contribute to these survival differentials need to be identified. Full Tex...|$|R

The {{nineteenth century}} was {{an era when}} the centralization efforts of Ottoman government gained momentum as the new concepts of modern state, like uniform provincial administration and centralized government, were embraced by the Ottoman ruling elite. Eastern Anatolia, which had enjoyed an autonomous position because of its <b>geographical</b> characteristics and <b>remoteness</b> from the capital, was also subjected to a vigorous effort of centralization and administrative reform. Tribal structures and religion always played prominent roles in socio-political structure of eastern Anatolia. As Ottoman government tried to strengthen the central authority in its eastern provinces, tribal leaders and shaikhs became the key elements in {{the relations between the}} state and tribal populations.

None of the existing classifications, including the government's preferred choice, were designed specifically to guide health resource allocation, and all exhibit strong weaknesses when applied as such. Continuing reliance on these classifications as policy tools will continue to result in inappropriate health program resource distribution. Purely 'geographical' classifications alone cannot capture all relevant aspects of rural health service provision within a single measure. Moreover, because many subjective decisions (such as the choice of algorithm and breakdown of groupings) influence a classification's impact and acceptance from its users, policy-makers need to specify explicitly the purpose and role of their different programs {{as the basis for}} developing and implementing appropriate decision tools such as 'rural-urban' classifications.
