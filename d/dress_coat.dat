25|$|These {{relations}} {{can be seen}} {{in similar}} foreign terms. The modern word for a <b>dress</b> <b>coat</b> in Italian, French, Romanian and Spanish is frac; in German Frack; and Portuguese fraque, used in the late 18th century to describe a garment very similar to the frock, being a single or double-breasted garment with a diagonally cutaway front {{in the manner of a}} modern morning coat. Even coats with horizontally cut away skirts like a <b>dress</b> <b>coat</b> were referred to as a frock in the late eighteenth and very early 19th century, before being renamed to <b>dress</b> <b>coat.</b>|$|E
25|$|This {{suggests}} that the earlier frock from the 18th century is more the direct ancestor of the modern <b>dress</b> <b>coat,</b> whereas the frock coat in the 19th century, the subject under discussion here, is a different garment altogether with separate military origins in the 19th century, although a remote historical connection to the frock cannot entirely be excluded.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{frock coat}} existed, {{there was another}} garment called the frock in the 18th century, which was {{probably}} unrelated to the frock coat, sharing only a similarity in name. The earlier frock was originally country clothing that became increasingly common around 1730. Formal dress was then so elaborate that it was impractical for everyday wear, so the frock became fashionable as half dress, a less formal alternative. By the 1780s the frock was worn widely as town wear, and, {{towards the end of}} the 18th century, started to be made with a single-breasted cut away front and tails. It was thus the precursor to the modern <b>dress</b> <b>coat</b> worn with white tie.|$|E

25|$|On August 2021, Pope withdrew to {{the line}} of the Rappahannock River. He was aware of Lee's plan because a Union cavalry raid {{captured}} a copy of the written order. Stuart was almost captured during this raid; his cloak and plumed hat did not escape, however, and Stuart retaliated on August 22 with a raid on Pope's headquarters at Catlett's Station, capturing the Union commander's <b>dress</b> <b>coat.</b> Stuart's raid demonstrated that the Union right flank was vulnerable to a turning movement, although river flooding brought on by heavy rains would make this difficult. It also revealed the plans for reinforcing Pope's army, which would eventually bring it to the strength of 130,000 men, more than twice the size of the Army of Northern Virginia.|$|E
25|$|At about 10:30p.m., Powell {{was escorted}} to the Seward {{residence}} on Lafayette Square near the White House by David Herold. Seward {{had been injured}} in a carriage accident on April 5, and suffered a concussion, broken jaw, broken right arm, and many serious bruises. Local newspapers reported that Seward was at home convalescing, so Powell and Herold knew where to find him. Powell was armed with a Whitney revolver and large knife, and wore black pants, a long overcoat, a grey vest, a grey <b>dress</b> <b>coat,</b> and a hat with a wide brim. Herold waited outside, holding Powell's horse. Powell knocked and rang the bell, and the door was answered by William Bell, Seward's African American butler. Holding up a small bottle, Powell claimed that Seward's physician, Dr. T.S. Verdi, had sent some medicine to the house. Bell was suspicious, as Dr. Verdi had departed the home only an hour earlier and left instructions for Seward not to be disturbed. Bell asked Powell to wait, but Powell pushed past him and began mounting {{the stairs to the}} second-floor bedrooms.|$|E

25|$|<b>Dress</b> <b>coats</b> {{and morning}} coats, the other main knee-length coats of the period, shared the waist seam of frock coats, making them all body coats, but {{differed}} {{in the cut}} of the skirt, as the frock coat {{does not have the}} cut away front which gives <b>dress</b> <b>coats</b> and morning coats tails at the back. As was usual with all coats in the 19th century, shoulder padding (called 'American shoulders') was rare or minimal. The formal frock coat only buttons down to the waist seam, which is decorated at the back with a pair of buttons. The frock coat that buttoned up to the neck, forming a high, stand-up collar, was worn only by clergymen.|$|R

2500|$|When the {{frock coat}} was first worn, correct daytime full dress was a <b>dress</b> <b>coat.</b> The frock coat {{began as a}} form of undress, the {{clothing}} worn instead of the <b>dress</b> <b>coat</b> in more informal situations. [...] The coat itself was possibly of military origin. [...] Towards the end of the 1820s, it started to be cut with a waist seam to make it more fitted, with an often marked waist suppression and exaggerated flair of the skirt. This hour-glass figure persisted into the 1840s. As the frock coat became more widely established around the 1850s, it started to become accepted as formal day time full dress, thus relegating the <b>dress</b> <b>coat</b> exclusively to evening full dress, where it remains today as a component of white tie. At this period, the frock coat became the most standard form of coat for formal day time dress. Through most of the Victorian era it continued to be worn in similar situations those in which the lounge suit is worn today such as in weddings, funerals, and by professionals. It was the standard business attire of the Victorian era.|$|E

2500|$|The {{buttons on}} the dress and service coats are {{reminiscent}} of Marine insignia prior {{to the adoption of}} the Eagle, Globe, and Anchor. The quatrefoil—the cross-shaped braid worn atop an officer's cover—is a distinguishing part of the Marine officer's uniform. The design is of French origin, and is a tradition from the pre-Civil War era when officers wore a rope cross on their caps to allow sharpshooters high in the rigging of a sailing ship to identify his allies in a battle. Enlisted Marines wear service stripes on the cuff of the dress and service coats, each stripe denoting four years of service as a Marine. The standing collar of the <b>dress</b> <b>coat</b> is reminiscent of the uniform that earned Marines the nickname [...] "Leatherneck".|$|E
2500|$|Various uniforms display rank {{insignia}} differently.

The same insignia is pinned on the epaulettes of the wool sweaters and tanker jacket. Officers will wear large insignia on the epaulettes of dress, evening dress, and service coats as well as sweaters and tanker jacket; smaller insignia is worn on the collar of all other uniforms (officers in a combat environment may wear subdued insignia, where flat black replaces silver and flat brown replaces gold). Chief Warrant Officers who are designated [...] "Infantry Weapons Officer" [...] with an MOS of 0306 (also known as [...] "Marine Gunner") replace their left insignia with a gold or black bursting bomb. Navy personnel authorized to wear Marine uniforms wear their assigned rate. [...] Musicians in the United States Marine Band replace the crossed rifle in their insignia with lyres to denote their non-combat role.|$|E
