25|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> {{afflicted with}} gigantomastia (>1,000 gm {{increase}} per breast), the average breast-volume reduction diminished her oversized bust by three (3) brassière cup-sizes. The surgical reduction of abnormally enlarged breasts resolves the physical symptoms and the functional limitations that a bodily-disproportionate bust imposes upon a woman; thereby it improves her {{physical and mental}} health. Afterwards, the woman's ability to comfortably perform physical activities previously impeded by oversized breasts improves her emotional health (self-esteem) by reducing anxiety and lessening psychological depression.|$|E
40|$|Background: Endometriosis is {{a complex}} disease that can result in {{substantial}} morbidity, including chronic pain, dysmenorrhea and dyspareunia. There are contradictory reports regarding the connection between acute and chronic stress and magnesium levels in body fluids. Subjects and methods: A prospective study included 87 patients undergoing laparoscopy. The study group included 40 women with endometriosis and the control group consisted of 47 women with other causes of infertility. The levels of fright were determined using HAMA scale. The measurements of Mg levels were performed using biochemical analyzer “Monarch Plus”. Results: One day before the operation, HAMA score was 9. 54 ± 7. 34 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> with endometriosis, and 6. 69 ± 5. 51 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> without endometriosis. <b>The</b> morning before the operation, HAMA score was 8. 64 ± 8. 10 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> with endometriosis, and 4. 29 ± 2. 29 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> without endometriosis. <b>The</b> second postoperative day, HAMA score was 8. 96 ± 7. 60 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> with endometriosis and 6. 92 ± 5. 16 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> without endometriosis. Higher HAMA score <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> with endometriosis, <b>in</b> comparison with <b>the</b> control group, <b>in</b> all three time periods has been found, but the differences {{were not statistically significant}} (p> 0. 05). A negative correlation between the concentration of Mg in peritoneal fluid and HAMA score was found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> control group (p< 0. 01). Conclusions. In infertile women without endometriosis a correlation between Mg concentration in peritoneal fluid and HAMA score was found. No such correlation was found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> with endometriosis, possibly due to a systemic disorder in endometriosis that might affect Mg transport through the cell membrane...|$|R

25|$|Sex {{educator}} Rebecca Chalker {{states that}} {{only one part of}} the clitoris, the urethral sponge, is in contact with the penis, fingers, or a dildo in the vagina. Hite and Chalker state that the tip of the clitoris and the inner lips, which are also very sensitive, are not receiving direct stimulation during penetrative intercourse. Because of this, some couples may engage <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> on top position or the coital alignment technique to maximize clitoral stimulation. For some women, the clitoris is very sensitive after climax, making additional stimulation initially painful.|$|E

25|$|In {{the period}} 1797–1801 Burney wrote three comedies {{that were not}} to be {{published}} in her lifetime: Love and Fashion, A Busy Day and The Woman Hater. The last is partly a reworking of subject-matter from The Witlings, but with the satirical elements toned down and more emphasis placed on reforming her characters' faults. The play, first performed in December 2007 at the Orange Tree Theatre in Richmond, UK, retains one of the central characters, Lady Smatter – an absent-minded but inveterate quoter of poetry, perhaps meant as a comic rendering of a Bluestocking. All the other characters <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Woman</b> Hater differ from those in The Witlings.|$|E

25|$|Years later, as Henry rides {{through a}} forest, he {{narrowly}} avoids {{a collision with}} an oncoming carriage, resulting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> inside being thrown to the ground. Realizing he has met this realm's version of Cinderella, he offers her {{a ride to the}} ball as an apology. Cinderella, however, knocks him out and takes the motorcycle once she's been shown how it works, with Henry chasing her. At the same time, Lady Tremaine is about to set off for the palace, having clipped the Fairy Godmother's wings and taken her wand. When questioned why she is doing this, she explains to Drizella that magic has no power compared to fear, a point she drives home by destroying the Fairy Godmother.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the night}} that the woman ritually {{traditionally}} immerses is about 12 days after menstruation began, it often coincides with a woman's ovulation, and thus improves the chances of successful conception if sexual relations occur on that night. However, for certain women, this period extends far past the date of ovulation, and {{in combination with the}} ban on sexual relations during the niddah state, effectively results <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> being unable to conceive. In the case of this effective infertility, rabbis try on a case-by-case basis to relax halakhic strictures in order to facilitate conception. There have been some calls within Orthodox Judaism for the custom to be modified so that the time between the end of menstruation and the end of niddah isn't as long for these women.|$|E
25|$|One {{hypothesis}} for {{vulnerability to}} pre-eclampsia is the maternal-fetal {{conflict between the}} maternal organism and fetus. After the first trimester trophoblasts enter the spiral arteries of the mother to alter the spiral arteries and thereby gain more access to maternal nutrients. Occasionally there is impaired trophoblast invasion that results in inadequate alterations to the uterine spiral arteries. It is hypothesized that the developing embryo releases biochemical signals that result <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> developing hypertension and pre-eclampsia so that the fetus can benefit from a greater amount of maternal circulation of nutrients due to increased {{blood flow to the}} impaired placenta. This results in a conflict between maternal and fetal fitness and survival because the fetus is invested in only its survival and fitness while the mother is invested in this and subsequent pregnancies.|$|E

500|$|Across cultures, {{hermaphrodite}} {{figures like}} Ardhanarishvara {{have traditionally been}} associated with fertility and abundant growth. In this form, Shiva in his eternal embrace with Prakriti represents the eternal reproductive power of Nature, whom he regenerates after she loses her fertility. [...] "It is a duality in unity, the underlying principle being a sexual dualism". Art historian Sivaramamurti calls it [...] "a unique connection of the closely knit ideal of man and woman rising above the craving of the flesh and serving {{as a symbol of}} hospitality and parenthood". The dual unity of Ardhanarishvara is [...] considered [...] "a model of conjugal inseparability". Padma Upadhyaya comments, [...] "The idea of ... Ardhanārīśvara is to locate the man <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> as also the woman in the man and to create perfect homogeneity in domestic affairs".|$|E
500|$|<b>In</b> <b>The</b> <b>Woman</b> {{with the}} Whip, the first English {{language}} biography of Eva Perón, author Mary Main writes that no account records were kept for the foundation {{because it was}} merely a means of funneling government money into private Swiss bank accounts controlled by the Peróns. Fraser and Navarro, however, counter these claims, writing that Ramón Cereijo, Minister of Finance, kept records, and that the foundation [...] "began as the simplest response to the poverty (Evita) encountered each day in her office" [...] and [...] "the appalling backwardness of social services—or charity, as it was still called—in Argentina." [...] Crassweller writes that the foundation was supported by donations of cash and goods from the Peronist unions and private businesses, and that the Confederación General del Trabajo donated three man-days (later reduced to two) of salary for every worker per year. Tax on lottery and movie tickets also helped to support the foundation, as did a levy on casino and revenue from horse races. Crassweller also notes {{that there were some}} cases of businesses being pressured to donate to the foundation, with negative repercussions resulting if requests for donations were not met.|$|E
