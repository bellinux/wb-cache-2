5|$|United {{suffered}} {{the agony of}} reaching {{three out of four}} Scottish Cup finals in the mid-1980s, only to lose them all by a single goal. First came a 2–1 defeat to Celtic in 1984–85, compounded by a 1–0 League Cup final loss to Rangers in the same season; then a 1–0 defeat <b>in</b> <b>extra</b> time to St Mirren in 1986–87; and finally, a last-minute 2–1 loss against Celtic the following year, despite being a goal ahead. A three-year gap ensued before the 1990–91 Scottish Cup final, which pitted Jim McLean against his brother Tommy, at Motherwell. The final was won 4–3 by 'Well, with United again losing <b>in</b> <b>extra</b> time. The sixth Cup Final loss was also the club's fifth final appearance in eleven years.|$|E

5|$|In {{light of}} the criticism, tournament organisers ERC agreed to review the penalty {{shoot-out}} system, although they confirmed that they had already considered and dismissed some other possible ways of deciding matches, including replaying the game, having a 'next try wins' rule <b>in</b> <b>extra</b> time, {{reducing the number of}} players on the pitch periodically <b>in</b> <b>extra</b> time to create more space and deciding the game on a coin toss. The format for the penalty shoot-out was changed prior to the following season's tournament, removing the requirement for all players on the field (including forwards) to participate, however for the remainder of its existence, the Heineken Cup retained the penalty shoot-out as the final system for deciding a winner if required. No other Heineken Cup match needed to use it.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1990s and early 2000s, the IFAB experimented with ways of {{creating}} a winner without requiring a penalty shootout, which was often seen as an undesirable way to end a match. These involved rules ending a game <b>in</b> <b>extra</b> time early, either when the first goal <b>in</b> <b>extra</b> time was scored (golden goal), or if one team held a lead {{at the end of}} the first period of extra time (silver goal). Golden goal was used at the World Cup in 1998 and 2002. The first World Cup game decided by a golden goal was France's victory over Paraguay in 1998. Germany was the first nation to score a golden goal in a major competition, beating Czech Republic in the final of Euro 1996. Silver goal was used in Euro 2004. Both these experiments have been discontinued by IFAB.|$|E
