40|$|Strategies for {{humidity}} control —with {{and without}} heating— were evaluated via simulations performed with a previously developed model (see accompanying paper, this issue, part I). With heating, {{the best strategy}} combined {{the use of a}} <b>humidity</b> <b>setpoint</b> with step control of the roof window, increasing the ventilation in line with the outside temperature. Without heating, the best strategy again combined the use of a <b>humidity</b> <b>setpoint</b> with step control of the roof window, but required ventilation to be increased in line with the inside air temperature...|$|E
40|$|As {{greenhouses}} {{become better}} insulated and increasingly airtight, the humidity {{of the inside}} air rises easily and may become unfavourably high. Therefore, most greenhouses frequently open their vents to remove the moisture excess. When heated, opening the vents will increase the energy consumption. In case the greenhouse is dehumidified by internal moisture withdrawal, the loss of sensible heat via ventilation can be prevented. Moreover, condensation of moisture at an internal surface regains latent heat. Thus, internal condensation reduces the sensible heat loss of the greenhouse and regenerates part of the heat demand associated with the crop evaporation. The prevention of sensible heat loss and the capture of latent heat enables the reduction of energy consumption. The principle is not new, but the economic feasibility depends on the proper selection of capacities and engineering details and, of course, on energy costs. In order to explore and to demonstrate the potentials of this technique, Wage-ningen UR Greenhouse Horticulture employed such an internal dehumidification system in a 500 m 2 experimental greenhouse growing a tomato crop year round. Energy consumption of the greenhouse and water condensed in the dehumidification unit was measured. Parallel to these measurements, an existing simulation model was extended to include {{the description of the}} dynamic behaviour of internal dehumidification on a cold surface. This work gives an overview of the practical results in the experiments and shows the sensitivity of the technique on important parameters, like greenhouse air temperature and <b>humidity</b> <b>setpoint.</b> It appears that the system has a high potential for energy saving in the moderate and cold climate...|$|E
40|$|The thermal {{behavior}} of large supermarkets {{is dominated by}} internal gains. Specifically, refrigerated and frozen food display units area is characterized by cool loads created by commercial cases, which are also moisture trap. A coupling approach of air conditioning with display cases operation is proposed in this paper, based on {{a model of the}} cold aisle phenomenon. In this area, the significant vertical stratification of air has to be considered to calculate electric consumption of display cases. Heat and moisture exchanges are calculated and typical values are given. Our study gives new elements to answer the questions: how the energy balance is affected by the ambiance setpoints, how interactions between display freezers and air conditioning systems can be characterized. Typical technical characteristics of roof-top air conditioners performance under various conditions are proposed to calculate energy consumption including auxiliary equipment (fans). Simulations made with the models for commercial display freezer loads and air temperature profile establish the impacts of different ambient temperature and <b>humidity</b> <b>setpoints.</b> To aggregate the comparison, all energy uses are taken into account: air conditioning, refrigeration and defrosting, it is an essential element for technico-economical analysis of innovative solutions. ...|$|R
40|$|In the {{research}} program Greenhouse as Energy Source aims at having energy-neutral operated greenhouses by 2020. Therefore, {{a reduction of}} the energy use is important. The highly insulated VenLow Energy greenhouse have shown a low energy consumption {{for several years and}} in 2014 it was attempted to bring it below 10 m³ of natural gas equivalents per m² without a lowered production. To achieve this the leakage had to be reduced further and the screen quality was improved and a high <b>humidity</b> control <b>setpoint</b> was accepted. This {{in order to reduce the}} evaporation. Also the manipulation of the EC in the slab could lower the crop transpiration related energy consumption. The experiment showed an energy consumption of 8 m³/m² per year without a decreased crop production. This is far below target, but 2014 was a historically warm year. However, simulations showed that even in an average Dutch year the measurements taken would have met the target. The manipulation of the EC of the slab worked adversely, meaning that it increased the crop transpiration. The conclusion reads that the measures taken in the greenhouse make a productive tomato crop with less than 10 m³ of gas equivalents per m² per year realistic. With respect to the climate, a high humidity must be accepted and a shortened growing season running from mid-January to late November. A tomato variety like Komeett will yield at least 70 kg/m² can be expected, providing that CO 2 dosing is not related to gas consumption for heating...|$|R
40|$|The {{reprogramming}} {{has been}} done to the temperature and humidity monitoring system on baby incubator by using Borland Delphi 7. 0. The result of this program making was objected to the nurse and community health service in village area. Thus, it was beneficial to ease the nurse job of monitoring the condition of infant in the incubator. Furthermore, it could lessen the use of paper as media for data storage, for in this program the data storage was done in computers. The monitoring of temperature and humidity take advantages of Delphi 7. 0 program. In order to measure the temperature and humidity in the incubator, we use LM 35 censor and HSM 20 G censor. This Delphi 7. 0 program is able to display the censor test result on the temperature and humidity. In addition, this Delphi program is able to process data and store it on monitoring table on Microsoft Access. This table will record some items including, name of the infant, mother, address, date, time, temperature, <b>humidity</b> and temperatures <b>Setpoint.</b> Other than storing data, this Delphi 7. 0 program can process data and display the data in the form of graphic. From this monitoring system, we had the test result, which is displayed data on computer according to the measured data on the object, where the data accuracy ratio is 100...|$|R
40|$|Good HVAC control schemes in {{buildings}} help reduce energy use and maintain occupant comfort. PID controllers {{are widely used}} in commercial buildings to keep variables such as temperature, pressure and <b>humidity</b> at predefined <b>setpoints.</b> These controllers, {{when they do not}} include autotuners, must be carefully tuned. Also, one must consider the effect of interactions occurring among the control loops during the fine-tuning stage so one loop response is not improved to the detriment of another. This research emphasizes PI-control of dual duct systems. Three tuning methods (Ziegler and Nichols' sensitivity method, simplified IMC-PID method, and Bekker et al. method) were selected and tested on a small scale dual duct system with four decentralized control loops (cooling valve, fan speed, damper and heater). Each controller was tuned according to the best performing set of tuning parameters and the system was then operated under design conditions to observe the interactions among the control loops. Since interaction was minimum, a better understanding of interaction was obtained by introducing a sustained oscillation in each loop, one loop at a time. An oversensitive valve was found to have a severe effect on damper control loop and an oversensitive damper was found to interact with fan speed control. Considering these interaction effects, two sets of optimizing curves were developed for the dual duct system. The use of these curves improved some loop responses without rendering other loops unstabl...|$|R
