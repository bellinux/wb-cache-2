40|$|Cards {{and cash}} are {{competing}} payment instruments at point-of-sale. The twosided market platform theory, based on general benefit assumptions, supports {{the use of}} multilateral <b>interchange</b> fees for <b>card</b> payments {{as a means of}} promoting the use of cards. However, analysis of the issue from the concrete processing cost viewpoint leads to the opposite conclusion: collection of debit <b>card</b> <b>interchange</b> fees by issuers results in subsidisation of cash and so actually promotes the use of cash instead of cards. Banks use <b>card</b> <b>interchange</b> revenues to cover cash distribution costs. For merchants, interchange fees increase payment costs and thus reduce the possibilities to pass through to customers the cost savings flowing from card efficiency. Moreover, because of high merchant fees due to high interchange fees, merchants are also more reluctant to accept payment cards. An MIF based on the tourist level approach will result in all parties being indifferent between cash and cards and thereby delay the realisation of the cost benefits of increased debit card usage. The resent actions of authorities to increase transparency and reduce cross-subsidisation seem to point in the right direction – towards more efficient resource allocation in payments. interchange fee; cross-subsidies in payments...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a theory of}} payment industry dynamics, in which {{we focus on the}} monetary nature of payment devices and consider an alternative microfoundation for the two-sided market approach. In a competitive economy, the adoption of an emerging payment method is determined by the distribution of consumer incomes and firm sizes, and the change of consumer income, adop-tion cost, and card-industry market structure each have important influence on payment pricing and usage dynamics. Our findings suggest that both the increasing concentration of payment card network and the growth of consumer income relative to card service costs may help explain the puzzles surrounding payment <b>card</b> <b>interchange</b> fees...|$|R

We find that for some levels of the <b>interchange</b> fee incomplete <b>card</b> acceptance by merchants is an equilibrium, while when the interchange fee is too large merchants opt out of card acceptance. However, if opting out is not a costless option there exists a stable “lock-in equilibrium ” in which merchants get locked into card acceptance. This happens when buyers face some cost for switching back to cash, which in turn has crucial implications on the level of the privately set interchange fee...|$|R
50|$|Interchange Plus is {{the common}} name for a pricing {{structure}} for accepting credit card transactions by merchants. The Interchange fee {{is an important factor}} in determining the actual cost of accepting credit <b>cards.</b> <b>Interchange</b> pricing is what the Visa and MasterCard associations along with credit card issuing banks charge merchant account providers to process credit and debit card transactions. Merchant Account providers then charge a markup on interchange known as interchange plus pricing to process the transaction and provide customer service to the merchant accepting the credit or debit <b>card</b> payment. <b>Interchange</b> Plus pricing is known as the most honest and transparent form of pricing for merchants looking to accept credit cards. There are a lot of credit card processing companies that only offer interchange plus pricing.|$|R
40|$|<b>Interchange</b> fees in <b>card</b> {{payments}} are {{a mechanism to}} balance costs and revenues between banks for the joint provision of payment services. However, such fees represent a relevant input cost used as a reference price for the final fee charged to the merchants, who {{may be reluctant to}} accept cards and induce the cardholder to withdraw cash. In this paper, we empirically verify {{for the first time the}} effect of the interchange fee on the decision to withdraw cash and compare it with that of paying with payment cards, considering a balanced panel data set of Italian issuing banks. Finally, results show that there is a positive correlation between the cash usage and the level of the interchange fees. Accordingly, regulation of the multilateral interchange fee level may be an effective tool in reducing cash payments at the point of sale, although there is no clear evidence that a zero interchange fee rate (or a close-to-zero rate) would be optimal. ...|$|R

5000|$|The Durbin {{amendment}} {{also gave}} the Federal Reserve {{the power to}} regulate debit <b>card</b> <b>interchange</b> fees, and on December 16, 2010, the Fed proposed a maximum interchange fee of 12 cents per debit card transaction, which CardHub.com estimated would cost large banks $14 billion annually. On June 29, 2011, the Fed issued its final rule, which holds that the maximum interchange fee an issuer can receive from a single debit card transaction is 21 cents plus 5 basis points multiplied {{by the amount of}} the transaction. This rule also allows issuers to raise their interchange fees by as much as one cent if they implement certain fraud-prevention measures. [...] An issuer eligible for this adjustment, could therefore receive an interchange fee of as much as 24 cents for the average debit card transaction (valued at $38), according to the Federal Reserve. This cap—which took effect on October 1, 2011, rather than July 21, 2011, as was previously announced—will reduce fees roughly $9.4 billion annually, according to CardHub.com. As a result of the government limiting their revenue from interchange fees, banks made plans to raise account maintenance fees to compensate.|$|R
40|$|This paper shows why the Federal Reserve Board’s {{proposed}} {{alternatives for}} regulating interchange fees are not “reasonable” and therefore in direct {{violation of the}} statutory mandate that these rules be “reasonable” and “proportional” to the costs incurred by debit card issuers. The Board’s December 16, 2010 proposal is not “reasonable” because {{it would lead to}} a series of “unreasonable” outcomes, which, in significant part, flow from the predictable responses issuers of debit cards would take in response to the proposal. Policy makers cannot reasonably assume that banks in competitive markets will sit idly by while being forced to reduce their current market-determined debit <b>card</b> <b>interchange</b> fees, which comprise much of their debit-card revenues and a material portion of bank profits, by anywhere from 73 to 84 percent. To the contrary, banks will attempt to make up as much of the lost revenue as they can by some combination of higher fees on checking accounts, fees or reductions of benefits for debit card use, or more refusals by issuers to permit consumers to conduct higher-cost types of transactions that impose greater fraud risk. We argue that the Board should find that, in the absence of empirical evidence evaluated using the analytical framework governing two-sided markets proving otherwise, market-set interchange fees are reasonable and proportional to cost. Any other decision would lead to the unreasonable outcomes. ...|$|R
40|$|Significant {{attention}} worldwide {{has been}} paid to the regulation of credit <b>card</b> <b>interchange</b> fees. In part, this attention has followed concerns expressed about the level of these fees in Europe, the U. S. and Australia. The Reserve Bank of Australia recently conducted an extensive inquiry into the interchange fees associated with credit cards and has moved to regulate those fees. At the same time, research economists have considered determinants of the socially optimal interchange fee. In this paper, we use the Australian experience to highlight alternative methods of regulating interchange fees in payments systems. We use a simple model to derive a socially optimal interchange fee when merchants cannot freely set different prices for different payment instruments. We compare the socially optimal interchange fee from this model with those presented in the economics literature and show that most analyses capture a simple externality within the optimal fee. Credit card usage for a specific transaction is determined by the customer. But the customer does not bear the costs or receive the benefits that card usage imposes on the merchant. The optimal interchange fee internalises this externality. We then compare the theoretical optimal interchange fee with the approaches proposed in Australia, and show that the regulatory approach adopted by the Reserve Bank of Australia may be viewed as economically conservative in certain situations. Finally, we consider additional issues that will impinge on the regulation of interchange fees. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{advent of}} fleet cards {{can be traced}} back to the 1960s and 70s when key stops/key locks and stand alone card locks were used by {{independent}} marketers and filling station owners. A Key Stop or Key Lock fuel control system was a system where a group of commercial fleets could access a fuel pump with a unique key that tracked solely their gallons through that pump. This technology is obsolete and no longer available commercially. A card lock control system uses a punch card or magnetic stripe card to uniquely identify a fuel buyer on a private server. This was done to avoid a credit <b>card</b> <b>interchange</b> fee which raised the cost of fuel considerably. The first commercial fuel cards resembled a credit card with a name and a company logo on them. When a customer entered a fueling station, the cashier would take down the customer’s name and company information to authenticate ownership of the card. This process was time consuming and was vulnerable to fraudulent transactions. With the advent of computers and computer software in the 1980s, the development of the fleet card industry quickly expanded. The invention of the magnetic stripe and magnetic card reader allowed petroleum marketers to control fuel pump transactions, leading to today’s wide range of fleet card security features and state of the art reporting systems to track all fleet expenses. These “intelligent” systems make fleet management convenient and secure, as fleet card owners are able to track fleet fuel use with increased accuracy, receiving reports in real time on the fueling habits. Business owners are able to limit employee fueling by time-of-day and day-of-week.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{changes to}} debit <b>card</b> <b>interchange</b> fees {{could lead to}} an {{increase}} in the cost of debit cards to consumers. This brief analyzes the potential effects of an increase in debit card fees or in bank account fees by using the results of the 2008 and 2009 Survey of Consumer Payment Choice (SCPC). The main findings are that: 1) consumers with the least amount of education (less than a high school diploma), the lowest annual income (below $ 25, 000), and the youngest age (under 25 years) consider cost {{to be the most important}} payment characteristic. It is probable that these consumers would be most affected by an increase in debit card fees, and most likely to change their payment behavior in response; 2) the cost of debit seems to be an important factor affecting consumer payment decisions: consumers who rated the cost of debit cards as low relative to the cost of other payment methods were significantly more likely to adopt and to use debit cards; 3) credit cards were viewed as the closest substitute for debit cards. If the cost of using debit cards rises, consumers are more likely to substitute credit cards for some of their debit card transactions; 4) consumer reaction depends on the type of fee increases: an increase in the cost of debit cards specifically is expected to have a greater effect on debit card use than a broader increase in the cost of maintaining bank accounts; and 5) an increase in the one-time cost of debit card setup could lead to a substantial decrease in the rate of debit adoption...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{our work}} is to {{determine}} the involvement and plans of banks concerning the introduction of payment innovations in the Polish market. This empirical study was {{based on the results of}} two surveys. The first survey allowed us to obtain the official positions of 24 commercial banks. The second survey included the opinions of 70 experts, who were senior managers from banks and other payment market institutions. The paper presents the scope of the implementation of payment innovations and five-year plans outlined by the banks. It proved that commercial banks, including both the largest ones and those with a smaller market share, are extremely interested in payment innovations and are ready to implement many solutions at the same time. This new phenomenon can be described as the “universal innovativeness” of banks. Most of these innovations are intended to improve customer convenience, which helps banks to achieve an important strategic objective. Poland had recent changes in legal regulations which considerably reduced the <b>interchange</b> fee in <b>card</b> schemes. Our results indicated that, in spite of the decrease of the banks’ revenue, the innovation process did not slow down. A new situation is coopetition between banks in Poland, used as a successful model to implement the domestic mobile payment system BLIK. The Polish market of payment services has recently become one of the most innovative in the world. The diversification of innovations implemented by the banks may be read as a strategic response of those institutions to the dynamic technological advancements of FinTech and the related uncertainty of future trends in the payment market. The results have allowed us to formulate a hypothesis that is a new paradigm of a portfolio approach to introducing payment innovations that have appeared in banking. payment innovation; bank strategy; payment services; FinTech; banking coopetition; interchange fe...|$|R
