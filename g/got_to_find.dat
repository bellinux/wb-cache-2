Drysdale was on hand to congratulate Hershiser after the game. In fact, when Hershiser returned to the dugout, Drysdale was waiting with his microphone for an interview.|$|E

They're not so much difficult as not obvious. You've just <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> as many ways as possible to expose the music."

Alongside Yorke on vocals, guitar and keyboards, the band comprises bassist Flea of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, drummer Joey Waronker of Beck and R.E.M., percussionist Mauro Refosco of Forro in the Dark, and Godrich on keyboards and guitar.
