5000|$|... #Caption: Standard nut {{employed}} as a <b>jam</b> <b>nut</b> against another standard nut ...|$|E
5000|$|A <b>jam</b> <b>nut</b> {{is often}} used when a nut needs to be locked in place without {{clamping}} against another object. The <b>jam</b> <b>nut</b> essentially acts as the [...] "other object", as the two nuts are tightened against each other. They {{can also be used}} to secure an item on a fastener without applying force to that object. This is achieved by first tightening one of the nuts onto the item. Then the other nut is screwed down on top of the first nut. The inner nut is then slackened back and tightened against the outer nut.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>jam</b> <b>nut</b> is a {{low profile}} type of nut, {{typically}} half as tall as a standard nut. It is commonly used {{as a type of}} locknut, where it is [...] "jammed" [...] up against a standard nut to lock the two in place. It is also used in situations where a standard nut would not fit.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Jam</b> <b>nuts</b> {{can also}} be used in {{situations}} where a threaded rod must be rotated. Since threaded rods have no bolt heads, it is difficult or impossible to apply torque to a threaded rod. A pair of <b>jam</b> <b>nuts</b> is used to create a point where a wrench may be used. [...] <b>Jam</b> <b>nuts</b> can be unreliable under significant loads. If the inner nut is torqued more than the outer nut, the outer nut may yield. If the outer nut is torqued more than the inner nut, the inner nut may loosen up.|$|R
50|$|Lock washers, locknuts, <b>jam</b> <b>nuts,</b> and {{thread-locking}} fluid {{are ways}} to prevent vibration from loosening a bolted joint.|$|R
50|$|Lock washers, locknuts, <b>jam</b> <b>nuts,</b> {{and safety}} wire {{may be used}} in {{conjunction}} with thread-locking fluid to prevent loosening of bolted joints.|$|R
50|$|On September 13, 2007, Transport Canada {{issued an}} Airworthiness Directive {{applicable}} to Bombardier Q400 turboprop aircraft instructing all Q400 aircraft operators {{to conduct a}} general visual inspection of {{the left and right}} main landing gear system and main landing gear retract actuator <b>jam</b> <b>nut.</b> This effectively grounded all Q400 aircraft until the inspection had been carried out.|$|E
50|$|Receptacle {{refers to}} {{the other half of}} the {{connector}} pair, designed to be mounted—with <b>jam</b> <b>nut</b> fittings or other fastener hardware—to a bulkhead, panel or box. Inlinereceptacles are also available for cable-to-cable connections. As with the plug, it is the design and location of the receptacle in the system, not the gender of its contacts, which makes it a receptacle.|$|E
50|$|First time {{an entirely}} new car was {{designed}} and fabricated from scratch at Rutgers in a school year. The car earned a spot in design semi finals. Utilized a 600CC Honda F3 motor. First time a motor was semi stressed in this program. Incorporated outboard shocks, {{which seemed to be}} going a step back, but they worked quite well. CV joints were applied after a long hiatus since the first car. Switched to a single inboard rear brake rotor. All three aluminum brake rotors failed during the morning heat of endurance. New rotors were made by the afternoon, but the car ultimately did not finish endurance due to a throttle control issue (<b>jam</b> <b>nut</b> came loose).|$|E
50|$|In {{applications}} where vibration or rotation {{may work}} a nut loose, various locking mechanisms may be employed: lock washers, <b>jam</b> <b>nuts,</b> specialist adhesive thread-locking fluid such as Loctite, safety pins (split pins) or lockwire {{in conjunction with}} castellated nuts, nylon inserts (nyloc nut), or slightly oval-shaped threads.|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "jam nut" [...] {{can also}} refer to any nut {{that is used}} in the same {{function}} (even a standard nut used for the <b>jamming</b> purpose). <b>Jam</b> <b>nuts,</b> other types of locknuts, lock washers, and thread-locking fluid are ways to prevent vibration from loosening a bolted joint.|$|R
50|$|There {{are also}} other systems of {{fastener}} retention {{that do not}} rely on safety wire at all, such as lock washers, locknuts, <b>jam</b> <b>nuts,</b> thread-locking fluid, castellated nuts and cotter pins, all of which accomplish the same objective as safety wire, which is to prevent vibration or other forces from causing the undesired loosening of a mechanical fastener.|$|R
5000|$|The M98B also {{features}} a fluted medium-heavy 27 in barrel made of 4150 MIL-B-11595 steel. The barrel is rifled in a six groove, 1:10" [...] right hand twist pattern, and features a two-port muzzle brake threaded on and indexed by a <b>jam</b> <b>nut.</b> The bolt rides in a new [...] "bolt guide" [...] design, consisting of two tubular glass-filled polymer guides which have been infused with Teflon. These guides allow the bolt to travel better, as well as reducing the need for lubrication, and helping to seal the ejection and bolt handle ports from dirt. The bolt head is made of case-hardened 8620 steel, features nine lugs (three sets of three), and {{is attached to the}} bolt body with a crosspin. This separate bolt head design allows for simple caliber changes, as well as future pre-headspaced barrel and bolt-head sets.|$|E
50|$|Specialized {{locking nuts}} exist {{to prevent this}} problem, but {{sometimes}} it is sufficient to add a second nut. For this technique to be reliable, each nut must be tightened to the correct torque. The inner nut is tightened to about a quarter to a half of the torque of the outer nut. It is then {{held in place by}} a wrench while the outer nut is tightened on top using the full torque. This arrangement causes the two nuts to push on each other, creating a tensile stress in the short section of the bolt that lies between them. Even when the main joint is vibrated, the stress between the two nuts remains constant, thus holding the nut threads in constant contact with the bolt threads and preventing self-loosening. When the joint is assembled correctly, the outer nut bears the full tension of the joint. The inner nut functions merely to add a small additional force to the outer nut and {{does not need to be}} as strong, so a thin nut (also called a <b>jam</b> <b>nut)</b> can be used.|$|E
40|$|A {{friction}} stir {{welding tool}} is provided generally comprising three parts: a rotatable welding tool body (22) that has an outer threaded surface (32) and a probe (24) extending from a distal end of the body, a shoulder (26), which has a threaded inner surface (40) and a bore (36) at a distal end of the shoulder, and a <b>jam</b> <b>nut</b> (28), which has a threaded inner surface (42). The shoulder is threaded onto the tool body such that the probe extends from the shoulder through the bore by a preferred length. The <b>jam</b> <b>nut</b> is then threaded onto the tool body to secure the shoulder. The tool is operatively connected to a drive motor for rotating the tool body. The shoulder may include a knife edge projecting from the distal end (38) thereof adjacent the bore. The knife edge inhibits the weld material from migrating along the probe to intrude inside the shoulder, where it may prevent separation of the tool body and the shoulder when readjustment of the tool is necessary...|$|E
40|$|Adjustable-length strut {{designed}} for installation in structure subjected to large cyclic loads. Partly resembles large turnbuckle: includes oppositely threaded eyebolts engaging correspondingly threaded holes {{at opposite ends}} of shaft, and shaft turned to adjust length. However, unlike in turnbuckle, length setting not fixed by use of simple jam nuts: instead, length setting fixed by use of more complex threaded-end flanges partly resembling <b>jam</b> <b>nuts</b> but function somewhat differently...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Jam</b> <b>Nuts</b> - Two nuts, {{tightened}} on each other. In {{this application}} a thinner nut {{should be placed}} adjacent to the joint, and a thicker nut tightened onto it. The thicker nut applies more force to the joint, first relieving the force on the threads of the thinner nut and then applying a force in the opposite direction. In this way the thicker nut presses tightly {{on the side of}} the threads away from the joint, while the thinner nut presses {{on the side of the}} threads nearest the joint, tightly locking the two nuts against the threads in both directions.|$|R
5000|$|Biscuits {{today can}} be savoury or sweet, {{but most are}} small at around 5 cm in diameter, and flat. The term biscuit also applies to sandwich-type biscuits, wherein a layer of [...] "creme" [...] or icing is {{sandwiched}} between two biscuits, such as the custard cream, or a layer of jam (as in biscuits which, in the United Kingdom, are known as [...] "Jammie Dodgers")Sweet biscuits are commonly eaten as a snack food, and are, in general, made with wheat flour or oats, and sweetened with sugar or honey. Varieties may contain chocolate, fruit, <b>jam,</b> <b>nuts,</b> ginger, or even be used to sandwich other fillings.|$|R
40|$|A {{threaded}} {{average temperature}} thermocouple 11 is provided {{to measure the}} average temperature of a test situs of a test material 30. A ceramic insulator rod 15 with two parallel holes 17 and 18 through the length thereof is securely fitted in a cylinder 16, which is bored along the longitudinal axis of symmetry of threaded bolt 12. Threaded bolt 12 is composed of material having thermal properties {{similar to those of}} test material 30. Leads of a thermocouple wire 20 leading from a remotely situated temperature sensing device 35 are each fed through one of the holes 17 or 18, secured at head end 13 of ceramic insulator rod 15, and exit at tip end 14. Each lead of thermocouple wire 20 is bent into and secured in an opposite radial groove 25 in tip end 14 of threaded bolt 12. Resulting threaded average temperature thermocouple 11 is ready to be inserted into cylindrical receptacle 32. The tip end 14 of the threaded average temperature thermocouple 11 is in intimate contact with receptacle 32. A <b>jam</b> <b>nut</b> 36 secures the threaded average temperature thermocouple 11 to test material 30...|$|E
40|$|A shaker with a Terfenol-D rod {{actuator}} {{includes a}} mass coupled to {{both ends of}} the rod through a spring seat, a spring seat/adjuster and a spring washer. The actuator is mounted inside a cylindrical coil, which in turn is mounted inside a cylindrical permanent magnet, which in turn is mounted inside a cylindrical housing. An electrical drive system provides a predetermined excitation signal to the coil to cause the rod to vibrate {{under the influence of the}} magnetic field generated by the coil. One embodiment features a vibrating mass on one end of the rod. An implantable shaker includes a seal to leak-proof the shaker and a coating of Biomer™. The implantable shaker can be implanted in an animal to test tissue response to certain vibrations. According to another embodiment, the Terfenol-D rod actuator is held in place on one end with a pre-stress adjusting screw, which is threaded into the end of the housing and fixed in place with a <b>jam</b> <b>nut.</b> In all embodiments, a spring base is seated on one end of the rod actuator and forms an annular coaxial air gap between it and a spring seat, so that the air gap remains constant when the rod actuator vibrates and the spring base moves coaxially with respect to the spring seat...|$|E
50|$|Tuning screws are screws {{inserted}} into resonant cavities {{which can be}} adjusted externally to the waveguide. They provide fine tuning of the resonant frequency by inserting more, or less thread into the waveguide. Examples {{can be seen in}} the post filter of figure 1: each cavity has a tuning screw secured with <b>jam</b> <b>nuts</b> and thread-locking compound. For screws inserted only a small distance, the equivalent circuit is a shunt capacitor, increasing in value as the screw is inserted. However, when the screw has been inserted a distance λ/4 it resonates equivalent to a series LC circuit. Inserting it further causes the impedance to change from capacitive to inductive, that is, the arithmetic sign changes.|$|R

50|$|Japanese fashion {{began to}} divide by {{age in the}} 1970s with the {{appearance}} of gyaru magazines aimed at teens. Popteen, the most widely read of these magazines, has been publishing monthly since 1980. While mainstream fashion in the 1980s and early 1990s emphasized girlish and cute (kawaii), gyaru publications promoted a sexy aesthetic. Top gyaru magazines, including Popteen, Street <b>Jam</b> and Happie <b>Nuts,</b> were produced by editors previously involved in creating pornography for men.|$|R
5000|$|The Keelung Temple Night Market (...) night {{market was}} started {{to serve the}} needs of the many worshipers who came to the popular Dianji Temple (...) to pray for fortune, good luck, and health, or to seek answers to their problems. The night market centers on the {{neighboring}} area of the temple. There are over sixty registered food stalls here. One of the most famous snacks at the night market is Dingbiancuo (...) , which is a rice noodle soup made with mushrooms, bamboo shoots, dried tiger lilies, dried shrimp, oysters and shredded pork. Other famous snacks include butter crabs, eel stew and Taiwanese tempura. Because Keelung is a port city, fresh seafood is another feature of the night market. A Keelung specialty and particularly popular drinks is Paopao Ice, which is ice shaved and beaten up into fine, smooth, snow-like texture and then flavored with fruity <b>jams</b> and <b>nuts.</b>|$|R
50|$|American and Canadian pancakes (sometimes called hotcakes, griddlecakes, or flapjacks) {{are usually}} served at breakfast, in {{a stack of}} two or three, topped with real or {{artificial}} maple syrup and butter. They are often served with sides such as bacon, toast, eggs or sausage. Other popular topping alternatives include <b>jam,</b> peanut butter, <b>nuts,</b> fruit, honey, powdered sugar, whipped cream, cane syrup, cinnamon and sugar, and molasses. In addition, when a pancake is occasionally served as a desert, toppings such as ice cream, chocolate syrup, and various fruits are often used.|$|R
5000|$|A Christmas hamper is a {{traditional}} gift containing small nonperishable food items, particularly seasonal favorites such as fruitcake or plum pudding, chocolate, <b>nuts,</b> <b>jams,</b> biscuits, honey, smoked or dried meats, and cheese. Some hampers containing tea, coffee, or cocoa might also include a cup and saucer, often seasonally themed or personalized. Luxury hampers may also contain high-end items such as tins of caviar or small bottles of wine. A [...] "fresh hamper" [...] contains perishable items such as fruits, baked goods, or flowers. The tradition of the Christmas hamper may be intended as a special holiday meal for people who might otherwise have no memorable meal to mark the occasion, or for people such as students or shut-ins {{who are unable to}} join their families for Christmas.|$|R
60|$|To lessen this danger, as in {{the case}} of the women inebriates, all these {{children}} are brought up as vegetarians. Before me, as I write, is the bill of fare for the week, which I tore off a notice board in the house. The breakfast on three days, to take examples, consists of porridge, with boiling milk and sugar, cocoa, brown and white bread and butter. On the other mornings either stewed figs, prunes, or marmalade are added. A sample dinner consists of lentil savoury, baked potatoes, brown gravy and bread; boiled rice with milk and sugar. For tea, bananas, apples, oranges, <b>nuts,</b> <b>jam,</b> brown and white bread and butter and cocoa are supplied, but tea itself as a beverage is only given on Sundays. A footnote to the bill of fare states that all children over twelve years of age who wish for it, can have bread and butter before going to bed.|$|R
