5|$|Lawrencium is {{the final}} member of the {{actinide}} series and is sometimes {{considered to be a}} group 3 element, along with scandium, yttrium, and lutetium, as its filled f-shell <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it resemble the 7th-period transition metals. In the periodic table, it is located {{to the right of the}} actinide nobelium, to the left of the 6d transition metal rutherfordium, and under the lanthanide lutetium with which it shares many physical and chemical properties. Lawrencium is expected to be a solid under normal conditions and assume a hexagonal close-packed crystal structure (c/a=1.58), similar to its lighter congener lutetium, though this is not yet known experimentally. The enthalpy of sublimation of lawrencium is estimated to be 352kJ·mol−1, close to the value of lutetium and strongly suggesting that metallic lawrencium is trivalent with the 7s and 6d electrons delocalized, a prediction also supported by a systematic extrapolation of the values of heat of vaporization, bulk modulus, and atomic volume of neighboring elements to lawrencium. Specifically, lawrencium is expected to be a trivalent, silvery metal, easily oxidized by air, steam, and acids, and having an atomic volume similar to that of lutetium and a trivalent metallic radius of 171pm. It is expected to be a rather heavy metal with a density of around 15.6 to 16.6g·cm−3. It is also predicted to have a melting point of around 1900K (1627°C), not far from the value for lutetium (1925K).|$|E

25|$|Renewable energy {{resources}} and significant opportunities for energy efficiency exist over wide geographical areas, {{in contrast to}} other energy sources, which are concentrated in {{a limited number of}} countries. Rapid deployment of renewable energy and energy efficiency, and technological diversification of energy sources, would result in significant energy security and economic benefits. It would also reduce environmental pollution such as air pollution caused by burning of fossil fuels and improve public health, reduce premature mortalities due to pollution and save associated health costs that amount to several hundred billion dollars annually only in the United States. Renewable energy sources, that derive their energy from the sun, either directly or indirectly, such as hydro and wind, are expected to be capable of supplying humanity energy for almost another 1 billion years, at which point the predicted increase in heat from the sun <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> {{the surface of the earth}} too hot for liquid water to exist.|$|E

500|$|According to the Church, {{people have}} a right to private property.

Private property and the common good are seen as complementary elements that exist for the purpose of strengthening society. The taking of another's private property [...] "in obvious and urgent necessity" [...] as [...] "the only way to provide for immediate, essential needs (food, shelter, clothing)" [...] is not considered by the Church to be stealing. The concept of slavery as private property is condemned by the Church, which classifies it as the stealing of a person's human rights.|$|E
