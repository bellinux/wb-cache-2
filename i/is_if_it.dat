5|$|A {{tropical}} cyclone can cease to have tropical characteristics {{in several different}} ways. One such way <b>is</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> moves over land, thus depriving it of the warm water it needs to power itself, quickly losing strength. Most strong storms lose their strength very rapidly after landfall and become disorganized areas of low pressure {{within a day or}} two, or evolve into extra{{tropical cyclone}}s. There is a chance a tropical cyclone could regenerate if it managed to get back over open warm water, such as with Hurricane Ivan. If it remains over mountains for even a short time, weakening will accelerate. Many storm fatalities occur in mountainous terrain, when diminishing cyclones unleash their moisture as torrential rainfall. This rainfall may lead to deadly floods and mudslides, {{as was the case with}} Hurricane Mitch around Honduras in October 1998. Without warm surface water, the storm cannot survive.|$|E
5|$|As the Bonneville Floods rushed {{down the}} Snake River, the Missoula Floods {{occurred}} in the same period, but farther north. The Missoula Floods, which took place more than 40 times in the time span from 15,000 to 13,000 years ago, were caused by Glacial Lake Missoula on the Clark Fork repeatedly being impounded by ice dams then breaking through, with the lake's water rushing over much of eastern Washington in massive surges far larger than the Lake Bonneville Flood. These floods pooled behind the Cascade Range into enormous lakes and spilled over the northern drainage divide of the Snake River watershed, carving deep canyons through the Palouse Hills. The Palouse River canyon was {{the largest of the}} many gorges cut through the Palouse Hills, and could not have become as large as it now <b>is</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> were not for the Missoula Floods. The Lake Bonneville Floods and the Missoula Floods helped widen and deepen the Columbia River Gorge, a giant water gap which allows water from the Columbia and Snake rivers to take a direct route through the Cascade Range to the Pacific.|$|E

25|$|During the mid-20th century, Karl Popper {{emphasized}} {{the criterion of}} falsifiability to distinguish science from nonscience.

That <b>is,</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> is possible to conceive of an observation or an argument which negates them. Popper used astrology and psychoanalysis as examples of pseudoscience and Einstein's theory of relativity as an example of science. He subdivided nonscience into philosophical, mathematical, mythological, religious and metaphysical formulations on one hand, and pseudoscientific formulations on the other, though he did not provide clear criteria for the differences.|$|E

25|$|Another {{interesting}} question posed about congenital amusia <b>is</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> has a genetic origin. A {{study was conducted}} to test for the presence of a genetic origin by studying family aggregation of congenital amusia. Family members of amusics were studied, as well as family members of a control group. The study yielded interesting results. Amusia cannot be attributed solely to family environment due to the presence of at least one unaffected sibling in each tested family in the amusic group. Also, music was found to be present to a lesser extent, but not absent, in the environment of the amusic subjects than in that of the musically intact control group. This supports the claim that the occurrence of congenital amusia cannot be explained by a lack of environmental stimulation. Another interesting finding was that the next generation, or the offspring of those with congenital amusia, was more musical. A reason for this might be that musical stimulation for the offspring probably started early in life when their brains were more plastic.|$|E
25|$|A scrum is used {{to restart}} play if the ball becomes unplayable at a tackle, ruck or {{line-out}} {{and it is not}} due to a player offending. The team that was moving forward before the ball became unplayable is awarded the scrum; if no team was moving forward it is awarded to the attacking team. If the ball is stuck in a maul the scrum is awarded against the team that had possession of the ball prior to the maul forming. An exception <b>is</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> forms directly after a player catches a kick during general play (not a kick-off or drop-out) on the full. In this case the team of the player catching the ball feeds the scrum. If a defending player carries the ball into their own in-goal and grounds it or makes it dead a scrum is awarded to the attacking team five metres out from the try-line. If an attacking player gets into his opponents in-goal, but is unable to ground the ball, or the referee is unsure if the ball was grounded, play restarts with an attacking scrum five metres from the try-line. Scrums are also used to restart play if the ball touches the referee during general play giving one team an advantage, play is stopped due to an injured player or if a team manages to legally prevent a player taking a free kick.|$|E

500|$|... {{the bridges}} of a planar graph [...] are in {{one-to-one}} correspondence with the self-loops of the dual graph. For the same reason, a pair of parallel edges in a dual multigraph (that is, a length-2 cycle) corresponds to a 2-edge cutset in the primal graph (a pair of edges whose deletion disconnects the graph). Therefore, a planar graph is simple {{if and only if}} its dual has no 1- or 2-edge cutsets; that <b>is,</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> is 3-edge-connected. The simple planar graphs whose duals are simple are exactly the 3-edge-connected simple planar graphs. This class of graphs includes, but is not the same as, the class of 3-vertex-connected simple planar graphs. For instance, the figure showing a self-dual graph is 3-edge-connected (and therefore its dual is simple) but is not 3-vertex-connected.|$|E
500|$|The {{property}} of tangency {{is defined as}} follows. First, a point, line or circle {{is assumed to be}} tangent to itself; hence, if a given circle is already tangent to the other two given objects, it is counted as a solution to Apollonius' problem. Two distinct geometrical objects are said to intersect if they have a point in common. By definition, a point is tangent to a circle or a line if it intersects them, that <b>is,</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> lies on them; thus, two distinct points cannot be tangent. If the angle between lines or circles at an intersection point is zero, they are said to be tangent; the intersection point is called a tangent point or a point of tangency. (The word [...] "tangent" [...] derives from the Latin present participle, tangens, meaning [...] "touching".) In practice, two distinct circles are tangent if they intersect at only one point; if they intersect at zero or two points, they are not tangent. The same holds true for a line and a circle. Two distinct lines cannot be tangent in the plane, although two parallel lines can be considered as tangent at a point at infinity in inversive geometry (see below).|$|E
