5|$|One {{recorded}} case of courtship behavior involving curve-billed thrashers describes two males attacking {{each other}} vigorously and resorting to purring and hissings sounds when neither bird appeared to relent. The two males then puffed up their chests and strutted up and <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> female. They continued to alternate between purr and hiss and fighting one another until one triumphed. The victor flew towards the female and both chirped melodically before copulation.|$|E
5|$|The male {{chooses the}} nest site, and uses {{it for his}} {{courtship}} display, spending much time calling nearby. When a female comes near a male at his nest the male begins to display by raising his head, drooping his wings, pushing his chest forward, and lowering his tail. He then bows up and <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> female, who will lunge and then fly away if unreceptive. Both sexes take part in building the nest, which consists of a loose, untidy bunch of dry grass which fills the nesting cavity, lined with fur and feathers for warmth.|$|E
5|$|Moving {{south along}} the Logging Trail, between 11 and 17 March troops from the Magata Unit {{attacked}} the positions occupied by the US 129th Infantry Regiment {{in the vicinity of}} Cox's and Taylor's Creeks east of the Numa Numa Trail in the 37th Division's sector. Following the commencement of the Japanese counterattack in the central and southern sectors on 8/9March, the northern perimeter came under bombardment from Japanese indirect fire and there were several small scale actions between US and Japanese patrols; however, there were initially no major engagements fought in the sector. On 11March, the main elements of the Magata Unit concentrated around their assembly area on Mount Nampei in preparation for an assault. As they began advancing south-west, the US outposts were withdrawn and heavy barrages of fire were laid <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American positions. By early evening the two forces were engaged in a heavy exchange of fire along the Logging Trail, which lasted until darkness had fallen. Throughout the night, small parties of Japanese troops attempted to infiltrate the American positions, cutting the wire in several places and successfully capturing a number of pillboxes around the junction of Taylor's Creek and the Logging Trail, as well as several more further to the east.|$|E

25|$|When Herman Rosenthal {{was gunned}} <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hotel Metropole on July 16, 1912, then District Attorney Charles S. Whitman accused the police {{department}} of making little effort to apprehend the gunmen. One of the few exceptions, according to Whitman, was the assistance given by Dougherty who had been personally cooperating with the District Attorney's office and was praised for his honesty. Prior to leaving the police force, Dougherty led a detective squad which apprehended over a hundred gangsters within a 24-hour period {{in the aftermath of}} a gunbattle in which city court clerk Frederick Strauss had been shot and killed.|$|E
25|$|During the Second World War it was {{the site}} of a {{tracking}} station for anti-aircraft gunnery practice.

Initially, radio-controlled 'Queen Bee' aircraft were used, and the flat concrete foundation by the white tower on the cairn, now the location of the Solway Harvester memorial stone, was laid down for one of the control huts. The memorial stone to the Solway Harvester {{is in the form of}} an anchor set in a granite block.|$|E

25|$|As Delamain {{began this}} maneuver, Nureddin's {{reinforcements}} began to arrive from their position upriver. Four battalions of Ottoman infantry, supported by two cavalry brigades and artillery, were racing {{to try to}} recapture the Ottoman lines. Elements of Columns A and B, both under Delamain's control now, spotted the Ottoman units first and took them under fire. Once they had stopped the Ottoman advance, Delamain ordered a bayonet charge that threw Ottoman reserves into retreat. But while dealing with the reserves, Delamain could not spare troops to help Fry's attack, which remained bogged <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman trenches.|$|E
25|$|The American {{lines were}} {{backed up by}} {{impressive}} artillery support. The 3rd Panzer Grenadier Division hit the left or north side of Elsenborn ridge from the Schwalm Creek valley against 99th Infantry Division. But their tanks found the soft ground almost impassible, and one after another the Sturmgeschütz III assault guns bogged down, making them easy prey for the American artillery. On 20 December, the Pz Abt 103 lost a total of fifteen StuG III. Twelve of them bogged <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elsenborn Ridge, the others ran onto mines inside Krinkelt and Rocherath. The Germans attacked {{for a second time}} on the 20th. All these attacks were repelled with heavy losses.|$|E
25|$|The Safavids were {{traditionally}} {{allied with}} the Mughals in India against the Uzbeks, who coveted the province of Khorasan. The Mughal emperor Humayun had given Abbas' grandfather, Shah Tahmasp, the province of Kandahar {{as a reward for}} helping him back to his throne. In 1590, profiting from the confusion in Iran, Humayun's successor Akbar seized Kandahar. Abbas continued to maintain cordial relations with the Mughals, while always asking for the return of Kandahar. Finally, in 1620, a diplomatic incident in which the Iranian ambassador refused to bow <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Emperor Jahangir led to war. India was embroiled in civil turmoil and Abbas found he only needed a lightning raid to take back the far easternmost town of Kandahar in 1622.|$|E

Perhaps because of her connections, she was allowed to lie face <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pillory and a number of guards were paid to protect her.

500|$|An {{excellent}} fielder in the deep, Hill had {{a powerful}} throwing arm. During a match at Leeds during the 1902 tour of England, he threw a ball from near the boundary, knocking down the stumps {{at one end and}} rebounding to hit the stumps the other end. During the same tour at Old Trafford, Hill made a catch that Wisden claimed [...] "will never be forgotten by [...] ". A Dick Lilley hit to square leg looked likely to clear the boundary. [...] Hill himself said he raced [...] for it with a view simply to save a boundary. [...] In the event, he ran round 'close to the boundary' from his position at long on, aided by the wind seemingly holding up the ball to take the catch low <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pavilion in his outstretched hands; one that Wisden said [...] "few fieldsmen would have thought worth attempting".|$|E

500|$|The first live {{performance}} of [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] {{was on the}} 1990 Blond Ambition World Tour.

Hundreds of burning candles surrounded her as she knelt <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stage, the backup singers crying the words [...] "Oh my God" [...] several times. Madonna eventually removed a scarf from her head to display a huge crucifix hanging from her neck, and then rose and sang the full song, while her dancers gyrated around her. Two different performances were taped and released on video: the Blond Ambition: Japan Tour 90, taped in Yokohama, Japan, on April 27, 1990, and Blond Ambition World Tour Live, taped in Nice, France, on August 5, 1990. On his review of the latter release, Entertainment Weeklys Ty Burr praised the [...] "gymnastic dance productions in songs such as 'Where's the Party' and 'Like a Prayer'", calling them [...] "astonishing".|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} was principally at shot at Wrest Park in Bedfordshire and {{directed}} by Nez. It premiered on Channel 4 on 4 December 2008. It starts off with Allen singing from a caravan window, while a clothes line on the right has underwear and a teddybear hanging from it. As she exits, her clothes are revealed to be a smock dress with a big bow and high heels; upon returning through the caravan door, the interior changes {{to that of a}} luxurious mansion, in reality an English country estate. The chorus starts and she walks down the hall, surrounded by butlers, all making synchronised moves and starting a choreography with Allen. Afterwards, she climbs the stairs and the camera cuts to the next scene, where she is sitting <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mirror in an extravagant bedroom, with dresses, lamps, toys and cupcakes. The scene changes once again, with Allen walking into a room with giant, brightly coloured presents. They suddenly stand up, having two human legs, and begin to spin around, with the singer joining them. After descending the stairs and walking through the same hall she entered, she exits the estate, and the video takes down a darker, more serious tone, while the verse [...] "Forget about guns and forget ammunition/'Cause I'm killing them all on my own little mission/Now I'm not a saint but I'm not a sinner/Now everything is cool as long as I'm getting thinner" [...] is sung. The euphoric visual effects appear once again soon after, as the chorus takes place. Allen walks down the estate stairs, being surrounded by dancing balloons, hopping butlers and coloured fog. The camera zooms out showing the estate tied in a giant ribbon, but also grey, melancholic clouds, which contrast the cheerful party from before. Allen stated that she hoped the music video would convey parts of the song's sarcasm.|$|E
