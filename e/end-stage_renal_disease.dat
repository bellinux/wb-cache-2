30|$|Patients in MHD {{suffer from}} {{multiple}} traditional or non traditional risk {{factors that are}} associated with mortality, such as diabetes, cardio vascular disease and inflammation. The Cox proportional hazard modelling (Fig.  2) showed that these three co-morbidities evaluated were all additives in predicting mortality in presence of a severe wasting. In fact, for the association of each risk factor and severe wasting, the HR of death was higher than the addition of HR of the single factors. Diabetes mellitus (DM) {{is the leading cause of}} <b>end-stage</b> <b>renal</b> <b>diseases</b> in Guadeloupe (Foucan et al. 2000) as in many countries and appears, in the present study, as the strongest predictive factor of death in association with severe wasting.|$|R

25|$|It is {{accepted}} that kidney transplantation {{is the preferred}} treatment for ADPKD patients with <b>end-stage</b> <b>renal</b> <b>disease</b> (ESRD). Among American patients on the kidney transplant waiting list (as of December 2011), 7256 (8.4%) were listed due to cystic kidney disease and of the 16,055 renal transplants performed in 2011, 2057 (12.8%) were done for patients with cystic kidney disease, with 1,189 from deceased donors and 868 from living donors.|$|E
25|$|The {{demand for}} organs {{significantly}} surpasses {{the number of}} donors everywhere in the world. There are more potential recipients on organ donation waiting lists than organ donors. In particular, due to significant advances in dialysis techniques, patients suffering from <b>end-stage</b> <b>renal</b> <b>disease</b> (ESRD) can survive longer than ever before. Because these patients don't die as quickly as they used to, and as kidney failure increases with the rising age and prevalence of high blood pressure and diabetes in a society, the need especially for kidneys rises every year.|$|E
25|$|The {{prevalence}} of hypertension, another cardiometabolic syndrome component, {{has been increasing}} for the last decade. In 1994, 24% of U.S. adults had hypertension. Today, that figure has risen to 29%, {{according to data from}} the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. In addition, nearly 30% of U.S. adults have prehypertension. Hypertension increases one’s risk of suffering a stroke, developing <b>end-stage</b> <b>renal</b> <b>disease,</b> and dying from cardiovascular disease. In recent years, hypertension has directly claimed more than 61,000 U.S. lives and has contributed to approximately 347,000 deaths each year.|$|E

25|$|Transplant {{recipients}} {{must take}} immunosuppressive anti-rejection drugs {{for as long}} as the transplanted kidney functions. The routine immunosuppressives are tacrolimus (Prograf), mycophenolate (Cellcept), and prednisolone; these drugs cost US$1,500 per month. In 1999 the United States Congress passed a law that restricts Medicare from paying for more than three years for these drugs, unless the patient is otherwise Medicare-eligible. Transplant programs may not transplant a patient unless the patient has a reasonable plan to pay for medication after the Medicare expires; however, patients are almost never turned down for financial reasons alone. Half of <b>end-stage</b> <b>renal</b> <b>disease</b> patients only have Medicare coverage.|$|E
25|$|Previous {{professional}} guidelines classified {{the severity of}} CKD in five stages, with stage 1 being the mildest and usually causing few symptoms and stage 5 being a severe illness with poor life expectancy if untreated. Stage 5 CKD is often called end-stage kidney disease, <b>end-stage</b> <b>renal</b> <b>disease,</b> or end-stage kidney failure, and is largely synonymous with the now outdated terms chronic renal failure or chronic kidney failure; and usually means the patient requires renal replacement therapy, which may involve a form of dialysis, but ideally constitutes a kidney transplant. Recent international guidelines reclassified CKD based on cause, glomerular filtration rate category (G1, G2, G3a, G3b, G4 and G5), and albuminuria category (A1, A2, A3).|$|E

25|$|Atypical {{hemolytic}} uremic syndrome (aHUS) is {{an extremely}} rare, life-threatening, progressive disease that frequently has a genetic component. In most cases it is caused by chronic, uncontrolled activation of the complement system, {{a branch of the}} body’s immune system that destroys and removes foreign particles. The disease affects both children and adults and is characterized by systemic thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), the formation of blood clots in small blood vessels throughout the body, which can lead to stroke, heart attack, kidney failure, and death. The complement system activation may be due to mutations in the complement regulatory proteins (factor H, factor I, or membrane cofactor protein), or is occasionally due to acquired neutralizing autoantibody inhibitors of these complement system components, for example anti–factor H antibodies. Despite the use of supportive care, historically an estimated 33–40% of patients died or developed <b>end-stage</b> <b>renal</b> <b>disease</b> (ESRD) with the first clinical bout of aHUS.

40|$|The {{oxidative}} {{modification of}} LDL {{is a key}} event {{in the process of}} atherosclerosis. Oxidized derivatives of lipoproteins accumulate in the vascular wall and promote local inflammatory lesions which trigger the progression of the atheromatous plaques. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is a heme-containing enzyme of the peroxidase family that produces hypochlorous acid (HOCl) in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) and chloride anions (Cl-), leading to oxidative modifications of protein and cellular structures. MPO has indeed been reported as a contributory factor in many inflammatory syndromes such as rheumatoid arthritis, <b>end-stage</b> <b>renal</b> <b>diseases,</b> and atherosclerosis. In respect with atherogenesis, MPO which is a highly cationic protein (isolectric point> 10) binds easily to LDL. This phenomenon contributes to the oxidation of these lipoproteins. Various data demonstrate that HOCL produced by the MPO system mainly acts on the protein part of LDL. We developed an ELISA test involving specific monoclonal antibody for the quantification of the oxidative modifications of apo B [1]. By this method, we also demonstrated that the oxidation can partly take place at the surface of endothelial cells (EC), constituting an additional mechanism to subendothelial oxidation in atheromatous lesions [2].

Methods: This is a historical cohort study of 1356 renal transplantation carried out during 1999 to 2009. Kaplan-Meier method was used to determine the survival rate, log rank test to compare survival curves, and Cox regres-sion model to determine hazard ratios and for modeling of variables affecting survival.

40|$|Diabetic {{nephropathy}} (DN) {{belongs to}} debilitating microvascular complications of diabetes {{and is the}} leading cause of <b>end-stage</b> <b>renal</b> <b>diseases</b> worldwide. Furthermore, outcomes from the DCCT/EDIC study showed that DN often persists and progresses despite intensive glucose control in many diabetes patients, possibly as a result of prior episode of hyperglycemia, which is called “metabolic memory. ” The underlying mechanisms responsible for the development and progression of DN remain poorly understood. Activation of multiple signaling pathways and key transcription factors can lead to aberrant expression of DN-related pathologic genes in target renal cells. Increasing evidence suggests that epigenetic mechanisms in chromatin such as DNA methylation, histone acetylation, and methylation can influence the pathophysiology of DN and metabolic memory. Exciting researches from cell culture and experimental animals have shown that key histone methylation patterns and the related histone methyltransferases and histone demethylases can play important roles in the regulation of inflammatory and profibrotic genes in renal cells under diabetic conditions. Because histone methylation is dynamic and potentially reversible, it can provide a window of opportunity for the development of much-needed novel therapeutic potential for DN in the future. In this minireview, we discuss recent advances in the field of histone methylation and its roles in the pathogenesis and progression of DN...|$|R
