5000|$|The {{specimen}} {{is placed}} in the machine between the grips and an <b>extensometer</b> if required can automatically record the change in gauge length during the test. If an <b>extensometer</b> is not fitted, the machine itself can record the displacement between its cross heads on which the specimen is held. However, this method not only records the change in length of the specimen but also all other extending / elastic components of the testing machine and its drive systems including any slipping of the specimen in the grips. Once the machine is started it begins to apply an increasing load on specimen. Throughout the tests the control system and its associated software record the load and extension or compression of the specimen.|$|E
5000|$|An <b>extensometer</b> is {{a device}} {{that is used to}} measure changes in the length of an object. [...] It is useful for {{stress-strain}} measurements and tensile tests.

50|$|The strain {{measurements}} are most commonly measured with an <b>extensometer,</b> but strain gauges are also frequently used on small test specimen or when Poisson's ratio is being measured.

50|$|When {{measuring}} the {{modulus of elasticity}} on 50 mm gauge length plastics to ISO 527 an accuracy of 1 µm is required. Some video <b>extensometers</b> cannot achieve this, whilst for production testing {{it is better to}} use automated motorized digital extensometry to avoid operators manually attaching marks to the specimen, and spending time setting and adjusting the system. Note that some video <b>extensometers</b> have difficulty in achieving acceptable results when used to measure strain within temperature chambers.|$|R
30|$|Nevertheless, we {{can confirm}} that the {{somewhat}} distal <b>extensometers</b> at ISA are more sensitive to some types of subsurface volume changes than are GPS-based measurements. Assuming that the resolution of displacement using GPS is up to 1 mm, the detection limit for subsurface volume changes using <b>extensometers</b> located 20 km away from the source epicenter {{is much better than}} when using densely deployed GPS, except {{in the case of an}} extremely shallow source (~ 1 km; see Appendix for detail).|$|R
