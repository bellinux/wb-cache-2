The presence of water, coupled with {{the depth of the}} tunnel, up to 1,100 feet underground, forced the tunneling team to deal with water pressures in excess of 150 pounds per square inch. Additionally, the tunnel alignment crossed or traversed near several significant faults and shear zones, including branches of the San Andreas and Arrowhead Springs Faults. In these faulted areas, the massive blocks of rock were broken into fine debris that were treated with grout before tunneling could safely cross through these zones. A particularly challenging reach of the tunnel alignment was encountered in the last 1,500 feet of the tunneling work as the TBM crossed five significant fault and shear zones along the tunnel alignment on its way to completion at the Devil Canyon Portal. While tunneling in this zone in mid-2008, the TBM began dipping as it encountered a 40-foot-wide fault zone of completely crushed, weak rock. Concrete and steel <b>foundation</b> <b>pads</b> were constructed in front of the cutter head to stabilize the TBM and correct the alignment of the machine as it crossed the weak ground within the fault zone.

40|$|Expansive soils in India are a boon {{to farmers}} but {{problematic}} to civil engineers, particularly to geotechnical engineers. Foundation structures experience large scale damage due to change in properties of soil. The design of foundations and pavements founded on swelling soils always involve {{a certain degree of}} risk and damage. Usually high degree of risk is associated even with the lowest cost of the design alternative. Thus it is necessary to explore various foundation alternatives in expansive soils. The foundation alternatives include: Strip <b>foundation,</b> <b>Pad</b> <b>foundation,</b> <b>Pad</b> and beam <b>foundation,</b> Pile and beam foundation, Pier and beam foundation, Reinforced Strip or Stiffened foundation, Skirted footing and Skirted stone column etc. These methods have several limitations.

40|$|The w e {{history is}} {{presented}} {{of the successful}} installation of an insulated and ventilated <b>foundation</b> <b>pad</b> for a two million gallon (9100 m 3) fuel storage tank in Inuvik, N. W. T. Because the tank is only heated locally in the winter at the fuel pick-up point near the tank bottom, the tank temperature is rela-tively low, ranging from 12 to 39 °F (- 1 1 to 4 ’C), {{with an average of}} 24 °F (- 4. 4 ”C). The foundation design employs no forced-air ventilation system, thus saving the related energy cost for operating such a system. Instead, the winter ventilation is accomplished by a wind draft. During the winter months, the average rate of heat removal through the culverts per unit of tank area is cal-culated to be about 2. 4 Btu/hr. ftZ (7. 6 W/m 2). This rate of heat removal is sufficient to freeze back the <b>foundation</b> <b>pad</b> in the winter and to allow the pad to absorb heat from the tank and the ambient air in the summer. Although the <b>foundation</b> <b>pad</b> undergoes annual freeze-thaw cycles, the lower insula-tion layer dampens the temperature variation in the subsoil and prevents it from thawing. Le present document relate le cas de I’installation d’une dalle de fondation calorifugte et ventilke pour un reservoir de stockage de combustible de 9100 m 3 a Inuvik (T. N. - 0.). Puisque le reservoir n’est chauffe en hiver qu’au point de prise de combustible, pres du fond du reservoir, sa temperature est relativement basse, variant entre- 1 1 et 4 ”C, avec une moyenne de- 4. 4 ”C. La ventilation de la fondation n’est pas assurk par un systtme a air pulse, ce qui permet d’eviter les coats inherents a I’utilisation d’un tel systtme.
