5|$|Asthma, chronic bronchitis, {{bronchiectasis}} {{and chronic}} obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are all obstructive lung diseases characterised by airway obstruction. This limits {{the amount of}} air that is able to enter alveoli because of constriction of the bronchial tree, due to inflammation. Obstructive lung <b>diseases</b> <b>are</b> often identified because of symptoms and diagnosed with pulmonary function tests such as spirometry. Many obstructive lung <b>diseases</b> <b>are</b> managed by avoiding triggers (such as dust mites or smoking), with symptom control such as bronchodilators, and with suppression of inflammation (such as through corticosteroids) in severe cases. One common cause of COPD and emphysema is smoking, and common causes of bronchiectasis include severe infections and cystic fibrosis. The definitive cause of asthma is not yet known.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—One of the {{important}} tropical <b>diseases</b> <b>is</b> Chikunkunya. This <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> transmitted between the human by the insect-borne virus, of the genus Alphavirus. It occurs in Africa, Asia and the Indian subcontinent. In Thailand, the incidences due to this <b>disease</b> <b>are</b> increasing every year. In this study, the transmission of this <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> studied through dynamical model analysis. Keywords—Chikunkunya, dynamical model, Endemic region, Routh-Hurwitz criteria. M I...|$|R

5|$|Attempts {{have been}} made at {{creating}} comprehensive catalogues of SNPs that have been identified from GWA studies. As of 2009, SNPs associated with <b>diseases</b> <b>are</b> numbered in the thousands.|$|E
5|$|Because viruses use vital {{metabolic}} pathways within host {{cells to}} replicate, they {{are difficult to}} eliminate without using drugs that cause toxic effects to host cells in general. The most effective medical approaches to viral <b>diseases</b> <b>are</b> vaccinations to provide immunity to infection, and antiviral drugs that selectively interfere with viral replication.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{rarity of}} the {{syndrome}} itself, {{it is hard}} to determine whether certain additional <b>diseases</b> <b>are</b> actually part of the syndrome. With a base population of possibly less than one thousand individuals, one or two outlying cases can skew the statistical population very quickly.|$|E
50|$|The {{extent of}} the <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> still unknown as the two women are only 21. However, the disease has had no {{apparent}} effect on their brains or personalities. Doctors {{do not know if}} the <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> fatal and, if so, what the life expectancy of one with this <b>disease</b> <b>is.</b> If the cause of the <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> genetic, there is a chance that the twins could pass it on to their future children.|$|R
5000|$|The {{most common}} {{clinical}} manifestation of NTM <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> lung <b>disease,</b> but lymphatic, skin/soft tissue, and disseminated <b>disease</b> <b>are</b> also important.|$|R
25|$|Different {{types of}} the disease occur in {{different}} regions of the world. Cutaneous <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> most common in Afghanistan, Algeria, Brazil, Colombia, and Iran, while mucocutaneous <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> most common in Bolivia, Brazil, and Peru, and visceral <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> most common in Bangladesh, Brazil, Ethiopia, India, and Sudan.|$|R
5|$|Many ectoparasitic bird lice (Myrsidea spp. and Menacanthus spp.), endoparasitic cestodes and {{nematodes}} {{have been}} described from this species. However no predators or <b>diseases</b> <b>are</b> significant factors in adult mortality.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{enemies of}} insect pests, {{also known as}} {{biological}} control agents, include predators, parasitoids, pathogens, and competitors. Biological control agents of plant <b>diseases</b> <b>are</b> most {{often referred to as}} antagonists. Biological control agents of weeds include seed predators, herbivores and plant pathogens.|$|E
5|$|If {{bacteria}} form a parasitic {{association with}} other organisms, they are classed as pathogens. Pathogenic bacteria {{are a major}} cause of human death and disease and cause infections such as tetanus, typhoid fever, diphtheria, syphilis, cholera, foodborne illness, leprosy and tuberculosis. A pathogenic cause for a known medical disease may only be discovered many years after, {{as was the case with}} Helicobacter pylori and peptic ulcer disease. Bacterial <b>diseases</b> <b>are</b> also important in agriculture, with bacteria causing leaf spot, fire blight and wilts in plants, as well as Johne's disease, mastitis, salmonella and anthrax in farm animals.|$|E
30|$|We {{calculated}} sensitivity, specificity, positive {{predictive value}} (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy of p 300 where sensitivity is {{the probability that a}} test result will be positive when the <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> present, specificity is the probability that a test result will be negative when the <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> not present, and {{positive predictive value}} is the probability that the <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> present when the test is positive. Negative predictive value will be negative when the <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> not present. Positive predictive value is the probability that the <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> not present when the test is negative. Accuracy is the overall probability that a patient will be correctly classified.|$|R
30|$|Twenty-three {{articles}} {{reporting on}} Panner’s <b>disease</b> <b>were</b> included. Most cases of Panner’s <b>disease</b> <b>were</b> unilateral in distribution and occurred in boys {{during the first}} decade of life. In general, conservative treatment is advised for Panner’s <b>disease.</b> Panner’s <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> a self-limiting <b>disease</b> and the majority of patients heal without clinical impairment.|$|R
50|$|Fatty liver <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> {{believed}} {{by many to}} be caused by bad diet. Hedgehogs will eagerly eat foods that are high in fat and sugar. Having a metabolism adapted for low-fat, protein-rich insects, this leads to common problems of obesity. Fatty liver <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> one sign, heart <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> another.|$|R
5|$|It {{was long}} {{believed}} that ceratopsians like Styracosaurus used their frills and horns in defence against the large predatory dinosaurs of the time. Although pitting, holes, lesions, and other damage on ceratopsid skulls are often attributed to horn damage in combat, a 2006 study {{found no evidence}} for horn thrust injuries causing these forms of damage (for example, {{there is no evidence}} of infection or healing). Instead, non-pathological bone resorption, or unknown bone <b>diseases,</b> <b>are</b> suggested as causes.|$|E
5|$|Many human <b>diseases</b> <b>are</b> not static phenomena, but {{capable of}} evolution. Viruses, bacteria, fungi and cancers evolve to be {{resistant}} to host immune defences, {{as well as}} pharmaceutical drugs. These same problems occur in agriculture with pesticide and herbicide resistance. It is possible that we are facing {{the end of the}} effective life of most of available antibiotics and predicting the evolution and evolvability of our pathogens and devising strategies to slow or circumvent it is requiring deeper knowledge of the complex forces driving evolution at the molecular level.|$|E
5|$|Muscle biopsy can {{be useful}} if an episode of {{rhabdomyolysis}} {{is thought to be}} the result of an underlying muscle disorder. A biopsy sample taken during an episode is often uninformative, as it will show only evidence of cell death or may appear normal. Taking the sample is therefore delayed for several weeks or months. The histopathological appearance on the biopsy indicates the nature of the underlying disorder. For instance, mitochondrial <b>diseases</b> <b>are</b> characterized by ragged red fibers. Biopsy sites may be identified by medical imaging, such as magnetic resonance imaging, as the muscles may not be uniformly affected.|$|E
30|$|The <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> spread {{only among}} the prey {{population}} and the <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> not genetically inherited. The infected prey does not become immune.|$|R
25|$|The {{study of}} {{the manner in which}} viruses cause <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> viral pathogenesis. The degree to which a virus causes <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> its virulence.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{now known}} that Bright's <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> due {{to a wide range}} of diverse kidney diseases; thus, the term Bright's <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> {{retained}} strictly for historical application. The <b>disease</b> <b>was</b> diagnosed frequently in patients with diabetes; at least some of these cases would probably correspond to a modern diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy.|$|R
5|$|Oklahoma was the 21st-largest {{recipient}} of medical {{funding from the}} federal government in 2005, with health-related federal expenditures in the state totaling $75,801,364; immunizations, bioterrorism preparedness, and health education were the top three most funded medical items. Instances of major <b>diseases</b> <b>are</b> near the national average in Oklahoma, and the state ranks at or slightly above {{the rest of the country}} in percentage of people with asthma, diabetes, cancer, and hypertension.|$|E
5|$|Serpins are {{involved}} in a wide array of physiological functions, and so mutations in genes encoding them can cause a range of diseases. Mutations that change the activity, specificity or aggregation properties of serpins all affect how they function. The majority of serpin-related <b>diseases</b> <b>are</b> the result of serpin polymerisation into aggregates, though several other types of disease-linked mutations also occur. The disorder α-Antitrypsin deficiency {{is one of the most}} common hereditary diseases.|$|E
5|$|Some immune deficiencies, such as X-linked {{agammaglobulinemia}} and hypogammaglobulinemia, {{result in}} partial or {{complete lack of}} antibodies. These <b>diseases</b> <b>are</b> often treated by inducing a short term form of immunity called passive immunity. Passive immunity is achieved through the transfer of ready-made antibodies {{in the form of}} human or animal serum, pooled immunoglobulin or monoclonal antibodies, into the affected individual.|$|E
50|$|The overall {{prevalence}} {{and severity of}} Paget's <b>disease</b> <b>are</b> decreasing; the cause for these changes <b>is</b> unclear. Paget's <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> rare in people less than 55 years of age, and the prevalence increases with age. Evidence from studies of autopsy results have demonstrated Paget's disease in about 3 percent of people older than 40 years of age. Paget's <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> more common in males than females. Rates of Paget's <b>disease</b> <b>are</b> about 50 percent higher in men than in women.|$|R
25|$|An earlier {{name for}} the <b>disease</b> <b>was</b> pathergic granulomatosis. The <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> still {{sometimes}} confused with lethal midline granuloma and lymphomatoid granulomatosis, both malignant lymphomas.|$|R
50|$|Acute {{mesenteric}} ischemia {{was first}} described in 1895 while chronic <b>disease</b> <b>was</b> first {{described in the}} 1940s. Chronic <b>disease</b> <b>was</b> initially known as angina abdominis.|$|R
5|$|Some sexually {{transmitted}} <b>diseases</b> <b>are</b> communicable between women, including human papillomavirus (HPV)—specifically genital warts—squamous intraepithelial lesions, trichomoniasis, syphilis, and {{herpes simplex virus}} (HSV). Transmission of specific {{sexually transmitted}} diseases among women {{who have sex with}} women depends on the sexual practices women engage in. Any object that comes in contact with cervical secretions, vaginal mucosa, or menstrual blood, including fingers or penetrative objects may transmit sexually transmitted diseases. Orogenital contact may indicate a higher risk of acquiring HSV, even among women who have had no prior sex with men.|$|E
5|$|Some {{types of}} chronic lung <b>diseases</b> <b>are</b> {{classified}} as restrictive lung disease, {{because of a}} restriction {{in the amount of}} lung tissue involved in respiration. These include pulmonary fibrosis which can occur when the lung is inflamed {{for a long period of}} time. Fibrosis in the lung replaces functioning lung tissue with fibrous connective tissue. This can be due to a large variety of occupational diseases such as Coalworker's pneumoconiosis, autoimmune diseases or more rarely to a reaction to medication.|$|E
5|$|The protein-only {{hypothesis}} {{has been}} criticised by those maintaining that the simplest {{explanation of the}} evidence to date is viral. For more than a decade, Yale University neuropathologist Laura Manuelidis has been proposing that prion <b>diseases</b> <b>are</b> caused instead by an unidentified slow virus. In January 2007, {{she and her colleagues}} published an article reporting to have found a virus in 10%, or less, of their scrapie-infected cells in culture.|$|E

50|$|Non-communicable: A non-communicable <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> {{a medical}} {{condition}} or <b>disease</b> that <b>is</b> non-transmissible. Non-communicable <b>diseases</b> cannot <b>be</b> spread directly {{from one person to}} another. Heart <b>disease</b> and cancer <b>are</b> examples of non-communicable diseases in humans.|$|R
40|$|Maple syrup urine <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> a rare autosomal-recessive {{metabolic}} disorder {{caused by a}} deficit of oxidative decarboxylation of branched-chain amino acids. First symptoms appear in the neonatal period. Without treatment the <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> characterized by rapid progression of neurological symptoms. During stressful situations, such as infection or surgery, patients may experience severe ketoacidosis, rapid neurological deterioration and hypoglycemia. The perioperative management of a 26 -year-old man with maple syrup urine <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> described, {{a review of the}} <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> given and anaesthesia-related implications are discussed...|$|R
