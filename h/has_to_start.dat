This resulted as less availability to overseas markets and Honda <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> production {{on a second}} line at its Suzuka factory in mid-June to increase production from 700 units a day. In April 2009, the Honda Insight became the first petrol-electric hybrid to be the best-selling vehicle in Japan for the month.|$|E
25|$|Birds with {{relatively}} large eyes {{compared to their}} body mass, such as common redstarts and European robins sing earlier at dawn than birds {{of the same size}} and smaller body mass. However, if birds have the same eye size but different body masses, the larger species sings later than the smaller. This may be because the smaller bird <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> the day earlier because of weight loss overnight. Overnight weight loss for small birds is typically 5-10% and may be over 15% on cold winter nights. In one study, robins put on more mass in their dusk feeding when nights were cold.|$|E
25|$|When {{consciousness}} {{reaches the}} fourth plane, it {{finds itself in}} a very particular state. It is fully conscious of the infinite potential of energy and can make full use of it and it also becomes aware of the mental world. This new contact creates very strong desires {{to make use of}} this huge potential. At this point consciousness finds itself in the biggest danger of its long development. Not being able to control its feelings or thoughts, the soul is strongly tempted to handle infinite energy. If the infinite potential of this plane is misused, consciousness gets completely disintegrated and the soul finds itself back to the stone-form consciousness and <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> again the long course of evolution from there. If it abstains from using this energy it enters the lower mental plane and if it makes a completely selfless use of it, {{for the benefit of the}} spiritual development of others in illusion, it even moves directly to the higher mental plane.|$|E

500|$|Like many 1980s-era platformers, {{the player}} can {{accumulate}} points by defeating enemies and collecting items, {{with an extra}} life granted when the player has enough points. However, because Kirby's Dream Land lacks a save function, scores are not recorded. Also, there are no save files, so the player <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> over again when the Game Boy is turned off, if the player chooses {{to return to the}} title screen after a Game Over, or if the player resets the game. Once the game has been completed, a code is offered to play an optional Extra Game, in which the difficulty is significantly increased. [...] Completing the extra game offered a second code that lets the player adjust lives and vitality settings to play an even easier or harder game, and listen to music and sound effects freely. Since there is no save function, these codes are allowed to be entered even on a new session where the game has not been beaten yet.|$|E
500|$|DeHavilland {{was raised}} in the Episcopal Church and has {{remained}} an Episcopalian throughout her life. After moving to France, she {{became one of the first}} women lectors at the American Cathedral in Paris, where she was on the regular rota for Scripture readings. As recently as 2012, she was doing readings on major feast days, including Christmas and Easter. [...] "It's a task I love", she once said. In describing her preparation for her readings, she once observed, [...] "You have to convey the deep meaning, you see, and it <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> with your own faith. But first I always pray. I pray before I start to prepare, as well. In fact, I would always say a prayer before shooting a scene, so this is not so different, in a way." [...] DeHavilland prefers to use the Revised English Bible for its poetic style. She raised her son Benjamin in the Episcopal Church and her daughter Gisèle in the Roman Catholic Church, the faith of each child's father.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{his return}} from Afghanistan, Dutton wrote an article for The Guardian newspaper, in which he opined that the NATO-led forces in the country were making a {{difference}} and the situation was improving, but that the Afghan government still required assistance. He argued that more troops did not necessarily mean more violence, saying that [...] "experience shows that after an initial spike as the insurgents are cleared out, violence reduces to much lower levels" [...] and that [...] "providing {{a sense of security}} depends on much more than physical troop presence, but it <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> with that. We need sufficient troops to protect the people and convince them that Afghan government control (supported by [...] for the moment) is sufficient to prevent the return of the insurgents. He {{went on to say that}} [...] "the backbone of the NATO alliance gives the coalition a steadfastness which [...] "coalitions of the willing" [...] cannot match. It also gives unparalleled authority and legitimacy based on the consensus of its members". Dutton concluded that [...] "given the strength of this unparalleled military coalition, and the political and financial commitment to building the long-term stability of Afghanistan and the region, failure should not be contemplated". He was awarded the American Legion of Merit (Degree of Officer), and given permission to wear the decoration, [...] "in recognition of meritorious, gallant and distinguished services during coalition operations in Afghanistan".|$|E

Mark's younger brother, Tyler (Travis Burns), gets {{a job at the}} garage and he moves in with Mark. In an effort to bring down Dimato, Mark rejoins the police force, but <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> back as a constable. After assuring Naomi that he does not have feelings for Paige, they declare themselves an official couple. Mark learns Matt has been accepting bribes from Dimato and Brennan agrees not to tell anyone if Matt takes long-service leave and gives him a statement about Dimato's operations. Matt dies after being involved in a hit-and-run and Brennan attacks Dimato when he turns up to Matt's wake. He uses Matt's information to set up a police sting to catch the thief stealing cars for Dimato. The police follow a stolen car back to Dimato and Brennan arrests him. Brennan and Naomi's relationship suffers when she becomes Paul's executive assistant. Brennan asks Lauren if he can expose Matt's corruption to put Dimato in prison, which causes her son, Bailey (Calen Mackenzie), to lash out at him. Naomi breaks up with Mark and he learns that she has feelings for Paul. Her mother Sheila Canning (Colette Mann) tries to reunite them as she disapproves of Paul, while Paul decides to help Mark win Naomi back. He succeeds, but she discovers that Paul has been helping Mark out with their dates and ends their relationship.|$|E

Marez acknowledged that the United States has previously, and is currently, the largest supplier of military aid to many governments, including some with poor human rights records, but explained that Israel {{is the only}} country in which [...] "civil society groups" [...] had specifically asked the ASA to launch a boycott. Further responding to accusations that the ASA was singling out Israel while ignoring many other nations that have comparable or even worse human rights records that Israel (including many of Israel's neighbors), Marez replied: [...] "One <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> somewhere." ...|$|E

In the third game, fragments are placed in a flowchart upon completion, indicating where they {{take place in the}} story.|$|E
2500|$|In modern times, these breeds {{themselves}} {{have since been}} selectively bred to further specialize at certain tasks. [...] One {{example of this is}} the American Quarter Horse. [...] Once a general-purpose working ranch horse, different bloodlines now specialize in different events. [...] For example, larger, heavier animals with a very steady attitude are bred to give competitors an advantage in events such as team roping, where a horse <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> and stop quickly, but also must calmly hold a full-grown steer {{at the end of a}} rope. On the other hand, for an event known as cutting, where the horse must separate a cow from a herd and prevent it from rejoining the group, the best horses are smaller, quick, alert, athletic and highly trainable. [...] They must learn quickly, have conformation that allows quick stops and fast, low turns, and the best competitors have a certain amount of independent mental ability to anticipate and counter the movement of a cow, popularly known as [...] "cow sense." ...|$|E
