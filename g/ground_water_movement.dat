To improve the understanding of <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> occurrence, <b>movement,</b> and sustainability, an investigation was conducted using a number of complementary methods, including major ion geochemistry, iso-tope hydrology, analysis of gases dissolved in <b>ground</b> <b>water,</b> aquifer testing, geophysics, and an examination of surface and subsurface geology.

The results show that the hydrogeology of the San Bernardino Valley is markedly different than that of its four neighboring basins in the United States. The differences include water quality, chemical evolution, storage, and residence time. The differences result from the locally unique geology of the San Bernardino Valley, which is due to the presence of a magmatically active accommodation zone (a zone separating two regions of normal faults with opposite dips).

This model meets the following main requirements: it is capable to represent the mechanism of deformation of soil realistically; it contains parameters, which can be defined from standard laboratory researches; it has a sinmilarity and simplicity of use from the computing point of view. In the article the influence of fluidifying foundation soil at intensive seismic effect is investigated. In case of strong influences the behavior of soil becomes nonlinear, {{and the problem of}} assessing the response of soil becomes significantly complicated: the response depends as on the structure, power and water saturation of soil layers, and on magnitude and frequency structure of seismic influence. At such influences the rheological properties of soil, which is often connected with <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> <b>movements,</b> change. The changes of a phase condition of soil when soil is diluted are possible. As a result, seismic fluidifying of soil is usually accompanied by severe accidents even on aseismic constructions: buildings manage "to drown" or warp. There are even emissions of the diluted soil on a surface, which lead to formation of sandy craters. The catastrophic fluidifying of the water-saturated dusty and sand soil, which has caused victims and huge economic damage, happened at two strong earthquakes of 1964 : on March 27 at a coast of Alaska near Anchorage with M = 8, 4, and on June 16 in Niigata (Japan) with M = 7, 5.

40|$|Groundwater {{contamination}} by landfill generated leachate is {{a problem}} that is increasingly addressed for proposed and existing landfill sites. This thesis examines groundwater contamination movement from the abandoned Delaware County Municipal landfill. The site is located in the crest of a highly permeable sand and gravel glacial esker which allows for rapid <b>movement</b> of <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> and any contaminants introduced into it. The landfill site was originally investigated in the late 1970 's by Ed Lusch, {{a graduate student at the}} Ball State University Geology Department. That study showed some indications of <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> contamination <b>movement</b> to about 400 feet west of the site, in the direction of <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> flow. This indicated position of a contamination plume suggested that leachate, generated from the landfill site, had moved to that position since (or possibly before) the closing of the landfill in 1971. The present study, using a combination of surface resistivity methods, on-site test wells, and chemical analyses of <b>ground</b> <b>water,</b> attempted to determine the degree of contamination movement from the site since the original study and the extent to which the local aquifer had been affected. Results of this investigation revealed an apparent slow movement of leachate from the landfill westward towards the Mississinewa River, also in the direction of <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> flow. Surface resistivity methods of this study revealed the plume of contamination (indicated by resistivity "low" area) to now exist at approximately the same location as indicated in the earlier study, but to have expanded laterally. This investigation also found indications of the contamination plume well into the underlying fractured dolostone. Chemical analyses of nearby residential wells also revealed slightly elevated amounts of chloride, ammonia and specific conductivity in the <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> of the glacial esker south of the abandoned landfill site. The presence of three other dump sites, including a sludge dump, along the esker south of the landfill, offers questions as to the source of <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> contamination.

40|$|Concepts of <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> <b>movement</b> in igneous and {{metamorphic}} rocks {{in areas with}} a subtropical climate, {{such as that of}} the southeastern United States, have evolved over many decades. However, because of the dearth of research directed toward an understanding of the variables involved, much of the data set concerning the hydrogeology of igneous and {{metamorphic rocks}} is empirical data generated by ground water exploration and development. Some of the concepts derived from these empirical observations and from limited applied research, have been presented and discussed in various papers dealing with the hydrogeology of igneous and metamorphic rocks in the southern Piedmont/Blue Ridge. Igneous and metamorphic rocks have, in many places, very diverse properties that change over short distances both vertically and horizontally. Our experience over the last 35 years indicates that, because of this, <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> <b>movement</b> is often most influenced by the relative properties of various rock units or discontinuities rather than by absolute properties of a particular rock unit or discontinuity. This relationship greatly complicates attempts to understand the hydrogeology of igneous and metamorphic rocks-, and emphasizes the need for a strong and broad data base where it is desirable to make predictions concerning ground water. This paper discusses some of the major controls of ground water occurrences in igneous and metamorphic rocks. Determining and evaluating these controls on a site-specific basis greatly enhances the probability of successful ground water exploration, development and management.

Nebraska’s saline wetlands, {{home to a}} number of endangered species, are ecosystems whose development, sustenance, and survival depend on saline <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> discharge at the surface. This study demonstrates that the saline conditions present within the eastern Nebraska saline wetlands result from the upwelling of saline <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> from within the underlying Dakota Aquifer and deeper underlying formations of Pennsylvanian age. Over thousands {{to tens of thousands of}} years, saline <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> has migrated over regional scale flowpaths from recharge zones in the west to the present-day discharge zones along the saline streams of Rock, Little Salt, and Salt creeks in Lancaster and Saunders counties.

Tertiary mudstone units in the field area are subject to strain "softening'' and were characterized as over-consolidated, blue-grey, silty clays containing an abundance of smectites. In-situ softening appeared expedited by high <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> pressures and yields a cohesive plastic clay of low strength prone to slope failure. Investigations were concentrated in two areas where active mass movement was threatening housing and roading. Severe damage in the two study areas was caused by well delineated cohesive flow-slide behaviour moving at rates in excess of 15 cm per year principally via "drained" failure in response to rising <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> levels. Comparatively stable mudstone regolith/colluvium at low slope angles exhibited "creep" deformation in the order of 2 cm to 4 cm per year, sufficient to damage building foundations.

While slope dynamics have been widely studied, <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> <b>movement</b> in hills is still poorly understood. A combination of piezometers, ground-penetrating radar (GPR), and electrical resistivity (ER) surveys were used in an effort to monitor fluctuations in the subsurface water level in a reengineered slope near Keokuk, Iowa. This information, integrated with rainfall data, formed a picture of rainfall-groundwater response dynamics. There were two hypotheses: 1) that the depth and fluctuation of the water table could be accurately sensed using a combination of monitoring wells, ground-penetrating radar and resistivity surveys; and 2) that the integration of data from the instrumentation array and the geophysical surveys would enable the characterization of water movement in the slope in response to rainfall events. This project also sought to evaluate the utility and limitations of using these techniques in landslide and hydrology studies, advance our understanding of hillslope hydrology, and improve our capacity to better determine when slope failure may occur. Results from monitoring wells, stratigraphy, and resistivity surveys at the study site indicated the presence of a buried swale, channelizing subsurface storm flow and creating variations in groundwater. Although there was some success in defining hydrologic characteristics and response of the slope using this integrated approach, it was determined that GPR was ultimately not well suited to this site. However, the use of GPR as part of an integrated approach to study hillslope hydrology still appears to hold potential, and future work to further evaluate the applicability and potential of this approach would be warranted...|$|E
40|$|Geophysical {{surveys were}} {{performed}} at the Uranium Mill Tailings Remedial Action (UMTRA) Shiprock site in New Mexico during February 1996. The surveys were designed to locate areas of ground water contamination, consisting largely of sulfate and nitrate salts and uranium. Electrical geophysical methods were used to locate areas of sulfate and nitrate concentrations since these products, when present in ground water, increase its electrical conductivity. These contaminants also increase the density of water, making the water with the highest concentrations of these salts sink {{to the bottom of}} the water column. At the Shiprock site, where alluvium is underlain by the impervious Mancos Shale, the saline water will tend to rest in depressions on the shale surface. Seismic refraction surveys were conducted on the floodplain. The site comprises two areas, the terrace and the floodplain, separated by a steep scarp of some 70 feet (ft) (20 meters [m]). Measurements of electrical conductivity were taken over these two areas, searching for possible pockets of saline ground water resting on top of the bedrock. Conductivity surveys were also run to identify fractures within the bedrock that may act as conduits for <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> <b>movement.</b> Several areas of higher than normal conductivity were found on the terrace, including halos of higher conductivities on three sides of the tailings cell. The conductivity measurements searching for fractures found only a small number of minor fracture-like anomalies. These are not considered important. On the floodplain, both conductivity and seismic refraction measurements were taken. The conductivity measurements clearly show areas of high conductivity interpreted to result from ground water contamination. The seismic refraction measurements identified bedrock depressions that may contain denser, and more saline ground water lenses. Generally, the areas of high conductivity coincide with the bedrock depressions...|$|E
40|$|<b>Ground</b> <b>water</b> tracers are solutes {{dissolved}} in or carried by <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> to delineate flow pathways. Tracers {{provide information on}} direction and speed of <b>water</b> <b>movement</b> and that of contaminants that might be conveyed by the water. Tracers {{can also be used}} to measure effective porosity, hydraulic conductivity, dispersivity and solute distribution coefficients. For most applications tracers should be conservative, that is, move at the same rate as the water and not sorb to aquifer materials. Tracers must have a number of properties to be functional. Regardless of the desired properties, the chemical and physical behavior of a tracer in <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> and the porous medium under study must be understood. Good estimates of tracer behavior can be obtained from laboratory studies. Studies in this proposal will address tracer properties with analytical method development, static sorption and degradation studies and column transport studies, Mutagenicity tests will be performed on promising candidates. The tracers that will be used for these experiments are fluorinated organic acids and other organic compounds that have the chemical and biological stability necessary to be effective in the Yucca Mountain environment. Special emphasis will be placed on compounds that fluoresce or have very large ultraviolet absorption coefficients for very high analytical sensitivity...|$|R

They also learn that for water to move in an aquifer, some of the pores and fractures must be connected to each other. As a result of this activity students will be able to identify several sources of rock materials {{that make up an}} aquifer and discuss how water moves through gravel, sand, and clay.
