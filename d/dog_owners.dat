5|$|Among {{the most}} popular {{activities}} for an Australian Cattle Dog is dog agility. It is ideally suited for navigating obstacle courses, since as a herding dog it is reactive to the handler's body language and willing to work accurately {{at a distance from}} the handler. Agility has been used by Cattle <b>Dog</b> <b>owners</b> to instil confidence in their dogs, and enhance their performance in training and competition.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, Mayor Chirac {{introduced}} the motorcycle-mounted Motocrotte to remove dog faeces from Paris streets. The project was abandoned in 2002 {{for a new}} and better enforced local law, {{under the terms of}} which <b>dog</b> <b>owners</b> can be fined up to €500 for not removing their dog faeces. The air pollution in Paris, {{from the point of view}} of particulate matter (PM10), is the highest in France with 38µg/m³.|$|E
5|$|As {{the park}} is a {{national}} nature reserve and a Site of Special Scientific Interest, all <b>dog</b> <b>owners</b> are required to keep their dogs under control while in the park. This includes not allowing their dog to disturb other park users or disrupt wildlife. In 2009, after some incidents leading {{to the death of}} wildfowl, the park's dogs-on-leads policy was extended. Park users are said to believe that the deer are feeling increasingly threatened by the growing number of dogs using the park and Royal Parks advises against walking dogs in the park during the deer's birthing season.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis article uses an {{observational}} study of dog ownership to explicate understanding of consumer {{behavior in the}} marketing of pet and pet-related products. A close examination {{of the relationship between}} <b>dog</b> and <b>dog</b> <b>owner</b> reveals more than metaphorical parallels in consumer behavior. Dog ownership reveals a reciprocal altruism that prohibitive restrictions support. These restrictions are protective and punitive. The values and beliefs of the <b>dog</b> <b>owner</b> underpin these restrictions. The dependency on primitive cognitive functions within the domestic environment enables the <b>dog</b> <b>owner</b> to internalize an ideal through the relationship with the pet. This internalization explicates the need for businesses to support pet and pet-related products by core values rather than slogans and glossy programs to complement the <b>dog</b> <b>owner's</b> view of the relationship with their dog...|$|R
5|$|Sputnik 2 was not {{designed}} to be retrievable, and Laika had always been intended to die. The mission sparked a debate across the globe on the mistreatment of animals and animal testing in general to advance science. In the United Kingdom, the National Canine Defence League called on all <b>dog</b> <b>owners</b> to observe a minute's silence, while the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) received protests even before Radio Moscow had finished announcing the launch. Animal rights groups at the time called on {{members of the public}} to protest at Soviet embassies. Others demonstrated outside the United Nations in New York; nevertheless, laboratory researchers in the U.S. offered some support for the Soviets, at least before the news of Laika's death.|$|E
5|$|The largest {{breeding}} {{populations are}} in Russia (up to 500,000pairs), Spain (112,000 pairs) and Belarus (60,000 pairs). There have been declines {{in much of}} the range, but especially in northwestern Europe. The loss of insect prey through pesticide use, coupled with disturbance, collision with vehicles and habitat loss have contributed to the falling population. As ground-nesting birds, they are adversely affected by disturbance, especially by domestic dogs, which may destroy the nest or advertise its presence to crows or predatory mammals. Breeding success is higher in areas with no public access; where access is permitted, and particularly where <b>dog</b> <b>owners</b> allow their pets to run loose, successful nests tend to be far from footpaths or human habitation.|$|E
5|$|During her pre-war New York – Antwerp sailings, Kroonland carried {{some notable}} and {{interesting}} passengers. On 1 August 1904, {{one of the}} ship's passengers arrived in New York as somewhat of a mystery woman. She recounted that she had gone out for dinner in Antwerp and awakened to find herself at sea with only the white silk evening gown she was wearing. Having no money or luggage, she was barred from entering the United States and was compelled to remain on board the ship. After her predicament was reported in The New York Times, she received letters and telegrams that included marriage proposals. Her background story and a letter of credit eventually verified her identity, but she was deported after a New York doctor pronounced her insane. Later the same month The New York Times reported on first-class passengers' complaints over privileges for their dogs and the conditions in the kennel aboard the liner. One passenger was determined to have her dog in her state room, and after others joined her in removing canine companions from the kennel, Kroonlands crew took all the dogs back to the kennel. Many of the <b>dog</b> <b>owners</b> refused {{to speak to the}} others involved {{for the duration of the}} voyage.|$|E

The <b>dog</b> <b>owners</b> asked a state court to prevent Yakima from enforcing its ban on pit bull dogs. The trial court issued a temporary injunction against the city and accepted motions for summary judgment from both the <b>dog</b> <b>owners</b> and the city. The court decided {{in favor of the}} city and lifted the injunction, whereupon the <b>dog</b> <b>owners</b> appealed to the Washington Supreme Court {{on the grounds that the}} ordinance was vague because a person of ordinary intelligence could not tell what was prohibited, and that the trial court had improperly decided the summary judgment in favor of the city.|$|E

40|$|Spatial and {{statistical}} {{analyses were performed}} on data submitted by government-run animal care agencies (ACAs) from three southeast Minnesota municipalities for the purpose of using a Geographic Information System (GIS) to determine the distance traveled by lost dogs from lost location to found location. Data submitted included descriptions of each dog and the location where the dog was lost and was found. An individual or ACA that finds a dog expends time and money attempting to reunite the <b>dog</b> with its <b>owner.</b> Likewise, a <b>dog’s</b> <b>owner</b> expends time and money attempting to find his or her dog. Determining the distance traveled by lost dogs has the potential to help owners refine their search efforts for their lost dogs, as well as to assist ACAs in locating <b>owners</b> of found <b>dogs</b> impounded. Knowledge of the distance traveled by lost dogs also will be useful for developing proactive strategies for reuniting <b>dogs</b> and <b>owners.</b> The proactive reunification strategy discussed in this research is a GIS application which ACAs could use to identify households with licensed dogs nearby the location where a dog is found. A GIS application would help reunite <b>dog</b> and <b>owner</b> regardless of whether a dog was found wearing a collar with an attached license tag.
