The middle half of T. lubei is roughly cylindrical while for other Titanomyrma species, it is ovate with the segment A5 being the widest. The segment A3 <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>length</b> <b>about</b> {{a quarter of the}} width while for other species it is about a third. The segment A4 is thrice as long as the length of segment A3 while that of A4 segments of other species is less than twice. The segment A5-6 of T. lubei is approximately half {{as long as it is}} wide while for other species it is about a third. A3 is not curved around the petiole at the junction.|$|E
