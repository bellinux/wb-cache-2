While the previous studies regard infrastructure {{as a direct}} <b>input</b> <b>for</b> <b>production,</b> the present study proposes that infrastructure {{has an effect on}} actual output by enhancing technical efficiency thereby, reducing the gap between maximum potential output and actual output. To investigate the relationship between infrastructure and technical efficiency, a stochastic frontier approach is applied to Korean manufacturing industry. Confirming the presence of substantial technical inefficiency in production, this study shows that an increase in infrastructure reduces the technical inefficiency level. The study also finds that, contrary to expectation, the industrialized regions are less efficient than the less industrialized ones.

In many production systems, completion {{time should be}} planned within the due dates by taking into account precedence constraints and processing times. To solve this problem, the max-plus algebra is an effective approach. The max-plus algebra is an algebraic {{system in which the}} max operation is addition and the plus operation is multiplication, and similar operation rules to conventional algebra are followed. Utilizing the max-plus algebra, constraints of the system are expressed in an analogous way to the state-space description in modern control theory. Nevertheless, the formulation of a system is currently performed manually, which is very inefficient when applied to practical systems. Hence, in this paper, we propose a new algorithm for deriving a state-space description and determining an optimal control input with several constraint matrices and parameter vectors. Furthermore, the effectiveness of this proposed algorithm is verified through execution examples...|$|E
40|$|Sraffa (1960) {{introduced}} a {{classification of goods}} which has been used without modification for a long time. According to him goods have to be classified as basic and non-basic commodities. Among non-basic commodities, he extracts goods which are used directly and indirectly {{in the production of}} pure consumption goods. Pure consumption goods are neither used directly and nor indirectly in production the of a commodity. However, Sraffa regards pure consumption goods as non-basic commodities. Thus, one always needs to be careful, i. e. speaking of non-basic commodities, one needs to concretize what kind of non-basic commodity it is - a pure consumption good or not. I suggest the introduction of a new classification which does not principally change Sraffa's assumptions in his models, but concretizes definitions of the kinds of goods. I regard Sraffa's basic commodities as "basic capital goods", Sraffa's non-basic commodities, which are used as <b>inputs</b> <b>for</b> <b>production</b> of Sraffa's non-basic commodities as "non-basic capital goods", and Sraffa's non-basic commodities which are not used as <b>inputs</b> <b>for</b> <b>production</b> of any commodity, i. e.

I understand “capital goods” as being any good which is used as input in the input coefficient matrix of any Sraffa-Price-System in the frame work of Sraffa's interpretation at least one time.

As production becomes increasingly fragmented the management of inputs along the supply chain is a significant factor to stability and the competitiveness of the individual firm and the wider chain.
