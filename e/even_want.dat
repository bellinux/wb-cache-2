5|$|Keith {{meets with}} Principal Clemmons and finds Veronica in the closet. Veronica talks to Mr. Wu {{about one of}} his students, Peter, who had {{feelings}} for Mr. Wu. However, Mr. Wu is not gay. That night, Veronica has a dream about Peter, who “asks” her why he would <b>even</b> <b>want</b> {{to go to a}} baseball stadium. Veronica talks to Beaver, who was pushed into a wall by Cervando, a PCHer who died in the bus crash. Keith solves a case for Principal Clemmons about students who get diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder from the same doctor for better grades. Angie wins the experiment competition, and we learn that Angie was one of the students who was diagnosed with GAD for money. Principal Clemmons revokes exceptions for GAD students.

Keith tells Veronica that the perpetrator was probably targeting Dick and Beaver. Veronica has another, more frightening dream.|$|E
25|$|Alipin – Today, {{the word}} alipin (or oripun in the Visayas) means slave and that’s how the Spaniards {{translated}} it, too, but the alipins {{were not really}} slaves in the Western sense of the word. They were not bought and sold in markets with chains around their necks. A better description would be to call them debtors. They could be born alipins, inheriting their parents' debt, and their obligations could be transferred from one master to another. However, it was also {{possible for them to}} buy their own freedom. A person in extreme poverty might <b>even</b> <b>want</b> to become an alipin voluntarily – preferably to relatives who saw this as a form of assistance rather than punishment.|$|E

500|$|Durst {{named the}} band Limp Bizkit, {{because he wanted}} a name that would repel listeners. According to Durst, [...] "The name is there to turn people's heads away. A lot of people pick up the disc and go, 'Limp Bizkit. Oh, they must suck.' Those {{are the people that}} we don't <b>even</b> <b>want</b> {{listening}} to our music." [...] Other names that were considered by Durst included Gimp Disco, Split Dickslit, Bitch Piglet, and Blood Fart. Every record label that showed an interest in the band pressured its members to change its name.|$|E

500|$|... "Good Hit" [...] {{received}} negative {{reviews from}} music critics. Poppy Reid of The Music Network criticized the song for {{its reliance on}} autotune and lyrics [...] "you just don't expect (or want) from a 41-year-old". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine stated {{in a review of}} Love? that apart from [...] "Good Hit" [...] and [...] "Invading My Mind", [...] "Lopez shines when the beat hits 120 or higher." [...] Robert Copsey from Digital Spy called the song generic. Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club was critical of the song, stating that: [...] " [...] in which she drones [...] "I got that good hit" [...] when she clearly doesn't—nor does she seem to <b>even</b> <b>want</b> it." [...] Scott Shetler of PopCrush noted [...] "Good Hit" [...] to sound as if Lopez was covering Britney Spears [...] "rather than doing her own thing." [...] Monica Herrera from Billboard agreed, comparing the song to Britney Spears' [...] "Piece of Me" [...] and additionally to the work of Nicki Minaj.|$|E

500|$|The Programme was {{initially}} hesitant about producing the Manual, which promised to draw even more war resisters and publicity to it. [...] "The [...] didn't <b>even</b> <b>want</b> {{me to write}} it", Satin says. [...] "I wrote it at night, in the SUPA office, three or four nights a week after counseling guys and gals 8 to 10 hours a day– pounded it out in several drafts over several months on SUPA's ancient Underwood typewriter." [...] When it finally appeared, some leading periodicals helped {{put it on the}} map. [...] For example, The New York Review of Books called it [...] "useful", and The New York Times said it contains advice about everything from how to qualify as an immigrant to jobs, housing, schools, politics, culture, and even the snow. [...] After the war, sociologist John Hagan found that {{more than a third of}} young American emigrants to Canada had read the Manual while still in the United States, and nearly another quarter obtained it after they arrived.|$|E
500|$|Around {{the time}} he began {{recording}} his final album, Smith began to display signs of paranoia, often believing that a white van followed him wherever he went. He would have friends drop him off for recording sessions almost a mile away from the studio, and to reach the location, he would trudge through hundreds of yards of brush and cliffs. He started telling people that DreamWorks was out to get him: [...] "Not long ago my house was broken into, and songs were stolen off my computer which have {{wound up in the}} hands of certain people who work at a certain label. I've also been followed around for months at a time. I wouldn't <b>even</b> <b>want</b> to necessarily say it's the people from that label who are following me around, but it was probably them who broke into my house." [...] During this period, Smith hardly ate, subsisting primarily on ice cream. He would go without sleeping for several days and then sleep for an entire day.|$|E
500|$|While Kiedis was in rehab, {{the band}} sought a new {{producer}} {{for their next}} album. [...] Aspiring producer Michael Beinhorn was looking for work at EMI Records after several unsuccessful projects on other labels, when a man working at EMI approached Beinhorn and suggested that he work with the Red Hot Chili Peppers, as [...] "no one [...] {{what to do with}} them". [...] Beinhorn recalled of the situation: [...] "Though their music all seemed kind of abstract, there was definitely an excitement to it. [...] I thought they needed a lot of arrangement help ... I also quickly learned that [...] at the record label actually hated the Chili Peppers, like openly reviled them so bad that they didn't <b>even</b> <b>want</b> them to succeed. [...] It was the weirdest thing." [...] He contacted the band to meet up, and instead of arranging a formal meeting, the band proposed to meet him at a club in New Orleans called Tipitina's. [...] Beinhorn was impressed by the band's originality and non-conformist attitude and decided to work with the band. Kiedis then sat down with Beinhorn to discuss the recording of the album; Kiedis planned to record the album in ten days and write the songs during the recording sessions.|$|E

500|$|The {{subjects}} {{focused on}} in the album's lyrics include Vanilla Ice's abusive childhood and drug addiction. He stated that [...] "I wrote 'Fuck Me' 'cause I know how I've been perceived. [...] "I can {{look back at the}} whole Vanilla Ice thing, and it was played way out. It was just an image thing. I was always real to the music. But it built a huge hurdle for me to get over musically. A lot of people didn't <b>even</b> <b>want</b> to admit they bought a Vanilla Ice record." [...] "Too Cold" [...] is a rap rock remake of Vanilla Ice's biggest hit, [...] "Ice Ice Baby". Vanilla Ice stated that he remade the song because [...] "I wanted to let people know that I'm not running from anything. This is me. This is what I'm about. I think the music speaks for itself. If the music was whack, nobody'd even care to hear anything about no Vanilla Ice. I just think the music is so strong people are kinda comin' out of the closet. It's like, 'You know, hey, I bought it back in the day, and the new stuff is slammin'.' I think there's some hip-hop influenced, stage-diving, body piercing, tattooed white boys out there who are embracing this new sound."

500|$|The song {{originally}} featured vocals from American {{recording artist}} Mary J. Blige, whose {{version of the}} song leaked online in July 2011. In an interview with News.com.au, Guetta spoke about its leak, saying, [...] "You shouldn't even know about that...I'd rather not speak about it. That was annoying. It wasn't supposed to be out there." [...] Sia recorded a demo of the song, which was then sent to Blige and other artists. Eventually, Guetta decided {{to stay with her}} version. He explained, [...] "The first time I heard what Sia did, because she was not in the studio with me, I fell in love with it...I didn't <b>even</b> <b>want</b> to give it to anyone else; it was perfect the way it was. It's not only about how big you are in America, it's about the song and the voice." [...] American pop singer Katy Perry {{was the first person to}} be offered the track but turned it down because she felt its message was too similar to that of her song [...] "Firework". An insider told Take 40 Australia, [...] "So that 'Titanium' song, Sia wrote it for Katy, but [...] didn't want to do a song with Guetta..." [...] According to Sia's manager, Jonathan Daniel of Crush Management, Sia wrote the song for American R singer Alicia Keys. Guetta considered approaching other female singers to record on the song, however Perry advised him to keep Sia on the track. Guetta ultimately followed this suggestion.

500|$|Although {{the console}} used 32-bit {{processing}} and {{was capable of}} better graphics and sound than the Genesis alone, most games for the 32X did {{not take advantage of}} its hardware. Doom for the 32X received near perfect reviews from gaming magazines upon launch, but was later noted for being an inferior version of the game compared to releases for the PC and the Atari Jaguar, with the 32X version criticized for missing levels, poor graphic and audio quality, chuggy movement, and running within a window on the screen. Though the system had enhanced audio capabilities, 32X games did not use this, which Franz believes was due to developers being unwilling to invest in designing games to work with the new audio enhancements. [...] One source of these issues was the rush to release games on time for the 32X's launch; former Sega of America executive producer Michael Latham explained, in reference to 32X launch title Cosmic Carnage, [...] "We were rushed. [...] We had to get games out for the 32X and {{it was going to be}} such a close cycle. [...] When Cosmic Carnage showed up, we didn't <b>even</b> <b>want</b> to ship it. [...] It took a lot of convincing, you know, to ship that title." [...] Likewise with Doom, id Software's John Carmack rushed to have the port ready for release at the 32X's launch and had to trim out a third of the game's levels in order to meet the deadline for the port to be published on time. [...] Because of time limitations, game designs were intentionally conservative and did not show what the 32X hardware was able to do. In an interview at the end of 1995, Sega vice president of marketing Mike Ribero, while insisting that Sega was not abandoning the 32X, acknowledged that first party software support for the system had been lackluster: [...] "I won't lie to you, we screwed up with 32X. We overpromised and underdelivered." ...|$|E

500|$|In July 2009, Coulter {{released}} [...] "Don't Miss You", which {{peaked at}} number24, {{as the lead}} single from her proposed third studio album, Hear No, See No, Speak No. The second single, the title track, was released in October 2009, and peaked at number46. Hear No, See No, Speak No was originally scheduled {{to be released in}} November 2009, but was pushed back for a January 2010 release. Coulter eventually decided to cancel the album's release due to the first two singles struggling on the charts. In March2010, Coulter was a supporting act for Backstreet Boys' Australian leg of their This Is Us Tour. That same year, her song [...] "Can't Touch It" [...] was featured on the soundtrack to the film, Sex and the City 2.

It was then revealed that her new manager was Sean Anderson of the management company 22. Coulter later parted ways with Anderson and became managed by her-then boyfriend Richard Harrison of Black Label Entertainment. Throughout 2010, Coulter put her music career on hold as she took on a full-time position as a breakfast radio presenter for Sydney's Nova 96.9, alongside Merrick Watts and Scott Dooley. During this time, Coulter had thoughts about quitting music. [...] "At the start of [...] year, I couldn't imagine walking in a studio and writing a song again. I didn't <b>even</b> <b>want</b> to get on stage and sing. I was over it. It's hard for me to say that even now. Music is all I've ever wanted to do. I wasn't mentally there any more. I wanted out, it was too hard. I felt like I'd been worn down. I felt defeated".
