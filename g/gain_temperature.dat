Caterpillars that feed at times of the year when air temperatures are low are particularly likely to benefit from aggregative basking. The spring feeding larvae of the nymphalid butterfly Euphydryas aurinia, a non-shelter building species, bask “en masse” in the open, packing their bodies tightly together to minimize convective heat loss. Under high levels of solar radiation on cold days, gregariousness and the darkness of their cuticle enables the larvae to <b>gain</b> <b>temperature</b> excesses (Tbody − Tambient) as great as 30 °C. The construction of shelters that trap the heat of the sun enables social species to gain even more control over their body temperature. The extensive shelters of the tent caterpillars (Malacosoma) provide a surface large enough to enable the colony to bask “en masse” and the caterpillars oriented their nests {{to take full advantage of}} the sun.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{reports on}} the {{tolerance}} of low-dimensional InAs/InP quantum-dash- and quantum-dot-based semiconductor lasers to optical feedback in the 1. 55 mum window. For this purpose, the onset of coherence collapse (CC) is experimentally determined and systematically investigated {{as a function of}} different laser parameters, such as the injection current, differential <b>gain,</b> <b>temperature,</b> and photon lifetime. It is in particular found that for both material systems the onset of CC increases with the injection current in a similar way to bulk or quantum-well-based devices. Of most importance, we experimentally show that the differential gain {{plays a key role in}} the optical feedback tolerance. It is indeed shown to determine not only the range of the onset of CC but also the dependence of this threshold both on the temperature and laser cavity length. Increasing the operating temperature from 25 degC to 85 degC leads to a decrease of the onset of CC by a factor of only ~ 3 dB, well accounted for by the variation of the differential gain in this temperature range. We find no difference in the tolerance to external reflections of a truly 3 -D confined quantum-dot-based laser and a quantum dash device of the same cavity length, which have similar differential gains.

The biasing and output network of the class B power amplifier is modified to produce a class C amplifier at conduction angles of 180 °, 162 °, 126 °, 90 °, and 54 °. A feedback based biasing system, which uses two matched and scaled down transistors, compares the DC current of a class B and a class C biased transistor. This comparison is used to control the biasing voltage of the amplifier. The performance for each class C amplifier is simulated with the proposed constant conduction angle biasing (CCAB) system.

40|$|The AMP 01 is a {{monolithic}} instrumentation amplifier designed for high-precision data acquisition and instrumentation applications. The design combines the conventional features of an instrumentation amplifier {{with a high}} current output stage. The output remains stable with high capacitance loads (1 µF), a unique ability for an instrumentation amplifier. Consequently, the AMP 01 can amplify low level signals for transmission through long cables without requiring an output buffer. The output stage may be configured as a voltage or current generator. Input offset voltage is very low (20 µV), which generally eliminates the external null potentiometer. Temperature changes have minimal effect on offset; TCVIOS is typically 0. 15 µV/°C. Excellent low-frequency noise performance is achieved with a minimal compromise on input protection. Bias current is very low, less than 10 nA over the military temperature range. High common-mode rejection of 130 dB, 16 -bit linearity at a gain of 1000, and 50 mA peak output current are achievable simultaneously. This combination takes the instrumentation amplifier one step further towards the ideal amplifier. AC performance complements the superb dc specifications. The AMP 01 slews at 4. 5 V/µs into capacitive loads of up to 15 nF, settles in 50 µs to 0. 01 % at a gain of 1000, and boasts a healthy 26 MHz gain-bandwidth product. These features make the AMP 01 ideal for high speed data acquisition systems. Gain is set by the ratio of two external resistors over a range of 0. 1 to 10, 000. A very low <b>gain</b> <b>temperature</b> coefficient of 10 ppm/°C is achievable over the whole gain range. Output voltage swing is guaranteed with three load resistances; 50 Ω, 500 Ω, and 2 kΩ.

It can in fact enable the realization of improved sensing and control of turbine engine combustion leading to better fuel efficiency and reduced pollution. In addition, the possibility of placing integrated circuits in engine hot-sections can significantly reduce the weight and improve the reliability of automobiles and aircrafts, eliminating extra wires and cooling systems. In order to develop such electronics semiconductors with superior high temperature characteristics compared to Si are required. Thanks to its wide bandgap,  almost three times that of Si, Silicon carbide (SiC) has been suggested for this purpose. Its low intrinsic carrier concentration, orders of magnitude {{lower than that of}} Si, makes SiC devices capable of operating at much higher temperatures than Si devices. In this thesis solutions for 600 ° C SiC bipolar ICs have been investigated in depth at device physics, circuit and process integration level. Successful operation of devices and circuits  has been proven from - 40 up to 600 ° C. The developed technology features NPN and lateral PNP transistors, two levels of interconnects and one extra metal level acting as over-layer metallization for device contacts. The improved SiC etching and passivation procedures have provided NPN transistors with high current gain of approximately 200. Furthermore, non-monotonous current <b>gain</b> <b>temperature</b> dependences have been observed for NPN and PNP transistors. The current gain of NPN transistors increases with temperature at high enough temperatures above 300 ° C  depending on the base doping concentration. The current gain of lateral PNP transistors has, instead, shown a maximum of approximately 37 around 0 ° C. Finally, high-temperature operation of 2 -input ECL-based OR-NOR gates and  3 - and 11 -stage ring oscillators has been demonstrated. For the OR-NOR gates stable noise margins of approximately 1 or 1. 5 V, depending on the gate design, have been observed up to 600 ° C with a delay-power consumption product of approximately 100 nJ in the range - 40 to 500 ° C.   Ring oscillators with different designs, including more than 100 devices, have been  successfully tested in the range 27 to 300 ° C. Non-monotonous and almost constant temperature dependences have been observed for the oscillation frequency of 3 - and 11 -stage ring oscillator, respectively.
