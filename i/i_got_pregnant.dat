30|$|The {{average number}} of leiomyomas per patient was 2 (range, 4 – 13 fibroids). The median {{operative}} time was 68  min (range, 45 – 212  min). Intramural leiomyomas were found in all patients, and during the myomectomy the endometrial cavity was disrupted only in 8 of the 59 patients. All procedures were successfully managed laparoscopically with no conversion to laparotomy. The conception rate after the myomectomy was 78 % in total. Forty-six patients of the 59 <b>got</b> <b>pregnant</b> post-operatively {{with a total of}} 60 pregnancies (35 <b>got</b> <b>pregnant</b> one time, eight patients <b>got</b> <b>pregnant</b> two times, and three patients <b>got</b> <b>pregnant</b> three times).

Aiko stated that she was going through trouble at this period in her life saying [...] "At the time I was going through so much in my life that it was so easy to write the songs. I had just had a baby and I was dealing with baby father issues and I had a boyfriend. The songs were just coming and coming. I just had so much to say, and when I was signed, I never really got a chance to write my own music. I always wanted to do a mixtape and before <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>pregnant</b> I was about to get back into it ‘cause I was working with {{different}} producers and things like that. Fisticuffs, who produced the majority of sailing soul(s), I’ve known them for a while and worked with them on different projects.

I photograph as a mother, from a mother's point of view, showing the {{different aspects of}} motherhood as I see them; the beautiful and the ugly, the magic and the frustration, the extremes that live side by side {{when you are a}} mother. I try to photograph them all. Crying, sadness, anxiety, mourning the body I will never have again, the woman I will never be again. The strong physical connection to the children, erotic at times, something I found out many mothers experience but do not talk about much. With my images I try to sing a love song to my children, they are my inspiration. Their love, sadness, joy and neediness are for me the most meaningful moments of my life, the moments I want to photograph and preserve. Those images are taken from my life, they are very personal, they are about being a mother, being a child, the intensity of raising a child. This work is about the essence of being human...|$|E
40|$|A {{sample of}} 34 poor Black women who {{exchanged}} sex for crack was screened to discover if sex-for-crack exchanges resulted in pregnancies. Ethnographic {{interviews were conducted}} with women who became pregnant this way. Out of the 34 women, 18 reported sex-for-crack pregnancies, {{and more than half of}} that number became pregnant this way more than once. Twenty-nine pregnancies were reported. Only 2 women chose to have abortions. Interview transcripts were analyzed using qualitative data analytical procedures. The following three issues shaped the women’s responses to sex-for-crack pregnancies: (a) severity of crack use, (b) religious beliefs, and (c) social organization patterns within poor Black communities. The findings have implications for drug treatment and child welfare policy. The baby I am carrying now, I don’t know who the father is. There are a few [men] that I had sex with around the time <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>pregnant,</b> that day. But which one it is, I don’t know who. — 1998 interview with a poor Black female crack user Crack cocaine has dramatically changed the lives of many poor Black women in cities. The emergent sex-for-crack-cocaine barter system in which women partici-pate after other economic resources have been exhausted has contributed to a shift in the balance of power between men and women in this context. Marginalized women, desperate for the drug, will engage in unprotected vaginal sex with many different men simply because they have access to quantities of crack (Inciardi, Lock-wood, & Pottieger, 1993; Ratner, 1993). Failure to use condoms during these encoun-ters is largely dependent on the man’s resistance or the woman’s haste to complete the act to continue drug use. The increases in sexually transmitted diseases, includ-ing HIV infection, have been linked to this behavior (Booth, Watters, & Chitwood...|$|E
