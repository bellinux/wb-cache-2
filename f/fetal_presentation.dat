30|$|Torticollis is a {{clinical}} diagnosis where the sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM) is shortened on the involved side, {{leading to a}} lateral tilt towards the affected muscle and contralateral rotation of the face and chin [1 – 3]. Several obstetric and newborn risk factors have been proposed {{for the development of}} CMT, including prolonged labor, macrosomia, breech or other irregular <b>fetal</b> <b>presentations</b> [4 – 6]. The theory of birth trauma proposes disruption of the SCM muscle during the birth process [7], and medical text books state that trauma at birth is associated with CMT [8 – 10], although the true etiology remains unknown [7].

40|$|International audienceObjectiveTo {{determine}} whether breech presentation {{is an independent}} risk factor for neonatal morbidity, mortality, or long-term neurologic morbidity in very preterm infants. DesignProspective population-based cohort. PopulationSingletons infants without congenital malformations born from 27 to 32 completed weeks of gestation enrolled in France in 1997 in the EPIPAGE cohort. MethodsThe neonatal and long-term follow-up outcomes of preterm infants were compared between those in breech presentation and those in vertex presentation. The relation of <b>fetal</b> <b>presentation</b> with neonatal mortality and neurodevelopmental outcomes was assessed using multiple logistic regression models. ResultsAmong the 1518 infants alive at onset of labor included in this analysis (351 in breech presentation), 1392 were alive at discharge. Among those eligible to follow up and alive at 8 years, follow-up data were available for 1188 children. Neonatal mortality was significantly higher among breech than vertex infants (10. 8 % vs. 7. 5 %, P = 0. 05). However the differences were not significant after controlling for potential confounders. Neonatal morbidity {{did not differ significantly}} according to <b>fetal</b> <b>presentation.</b> Severe cerebral palsy was less frequent in the group born in breech compared to vertex presentation but there was no difference after adjustment.

40|$|To the Editors: We {{appreciate}} {{the interest and}} the comments of Nishijima et al about our article concerning accidental fetal lacerations during cesarean delivery. 1 Nishijima et al recommend transabdominal or transvaginal ultrasonographic examination by the surgeon immediately before the initiation of the operative procedure. We agree with this consideration and think that ultrasonographic findings (such as uterine wall thickness, <b>fetal</b> <b>presentation</b> or orientation, and the amniotic fluid volume) can help the surgeon to characterize the inherent risk to the fetal laceration injury at the cesarean delivery also. Our medical management in the operating theater states always to perform obstetric examination before the performance of cesarean delivery. In cases of doubt about <b>fetal</b> <b>presentation</b> and/or orientation, we do transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasonography. Then, if we observe an abnormal presentation, we use the precautions that we have reported. 1 But, despite this management, the risk of accidental fetal lacerations during cesarean delivery may be reduced but not eliminated. Thus, before the performance of cesarean delivery, the patient always should be informed about this risk of accidental fetal lacerations...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSES: To {{describe}} ocular features, {{management of}} cataract and functional outcomes {{in patients with}} persistent fetal vasculature. METHODS: Retrospective, descriptive case series of patients with persistent fetal vasculature. Data were recorded from the Congenital Cataract Section of Federal University of São Paulo, Brazil from 2001 to 2012. All patients were evaluated for sex, age at diagnosis, systemic findings, laterality, age at surgery, and initial and final follow-up visual acuities. Follow-up and complications after cataract surgery were recorded. Ultrasound was performed in all cases and ocular eco-Doppler was performed in most. RESULTS: The study comprised 53 eyes from 46 patients. Age at diagnosis ranged from 5 days of life to 10 years-old (mean 22. 7 months). Twenty-seven patients were male (58. 7 %). Persistent fetal vasculature was bilateral in 7 patients (15. 2 %). Forty-two eyes (79. 2 %) had combined (anterior and posterior forms) PFV presentation, 5 eyes (9. 4 %) had only anterior persistent <b>fetal</b> vasculature <b>presentation</b> and 6 eyes (11. 3 %) had posterior persistent <b>fetal</b> vasculature <b>presentation.</b> Thirty-eight eyes (71. 7 %) were submitted to cataract surgery. Lensectomy combined with anterior vitrectomy was performed in 18 eyes (47. 4 %). Phacoaspiration with intraocular lens implantation was performed in 15 eyes (39. 5 %), and without lens implantation in 5 eyes (13. 2 %). Mean follow-up after surgery was 44 months. Postoperative complications were posterior synechiae (3 cases), retinal detachment (2 cases), phthisis (3 cases), posterior capsular opacification (8 cases), inflammatory pupillary membrane (5 cases), glaucoma (4 cases), intraocular lens implantation displacement (1 case) and vitreous hemorrhage (2 cases). Complications were identified in 19 (50 %) of the 38 operated eyes. Visual acuity improved after cataract surgery in 83 % of the eyes.

40|$|Background: Thrombocytopenia-absent radius {{syndrome}} {{is a rare}} autosomal recessive disorder characterized by megakaryocytic thrombocytopenia and longitudinal limb deficiencies mostly affecting the radial ray. Most patients are compound heterozygotes for a 200 kb interstitial microdeletion in 1 q 21. 1 and a hypomorphic allele in RBM 8 A, mapping in the deleted segment. At the moment, the complete molecular characterization of thrombocytopenia-absent radius {{syndrome is}} limited to a handful of patients mostly ascertained in the pediatric age. Case presentation. We report on a fetus with bilateral upper limb deficiency found at standard prenatal ultrasound examination. The fetus had bilateral radial agenesis and humeral hypo/aplasia with intact thumbs, micrognathia and urinary anomalies, indicating thrombocytopenia-absent radius syndrome. Molecular studies demonstrated compound heterozygosity for the 1 q 21. 1 microdeletion and the RBM 8 A rs 139428292 variant at the hemizygous state, inherited from the mother and father, respectively.

40|$|Confirmation of {{pregnancy}} viability (presence of fetal cardiac activity) and diagnosis of <b>fetal</b> <b>presentation</b> (head or buttock in the maternal pelvis) {{are the first}} essential components of ultrasound assessment in obstetrics. The former is useful in assessing {{the presence of an}} on-going pregnancy and the latter is essential for labour management. We propose an automated framework for detection of <b>fetal</b> <b>presentation</b> and heartbeat from a predefined free-hand ultrasound sweep of the maternal abdomen. Our method exploits the presence of key anatomical sonographic image patterns in carefully designed scanning protocols to develop, for the first time, an automated framework allowing novice sonographers to detect fetal breech presentation and heartbeat from an ultrasound sweep. The framework consists of a classification regime for a frame by frame categorization of each 2 D slice of the video. The classification scores are then regularized through a conditional random field model, taking into account the temporal relationship between the video frames. Subsequently, if consecutive frames of the fetal heart are detected, a kernelized linear dynamical model is used to identify whether a heartbeat can be detected in the sequence. In a dataset of 323 predefined free-hand videos, covering the mother's abdomen in a straight sweep, the fetal skull, abdomen, and heart were detected with a mean classification accuracy of 83. 4 %. Furthermore, for the detection of the heartbeat an overall classification accuracy of 93. 1 % was achieved...|$|E

40|$|Background: Epidural {{parturition}} analgesia (EPA) {{is commonly}} employed technique of providing pain relief during labour. The newer form of low-dose intermittent EPA {{has been in}} the recent studies presented as solid, according to parturitient’s wish. The main goal of our review was to strenghten the influence of this form of EPA on continuation, mode and outcome of labour. Methods: We have retrospectively analysed all the labours in years 2005 and 2006 in nulliparous women in labour at term with the head presentation of fetus. They were divided in two groups – with and without EPA. Analgetic mixture of EPA contained 0. 1 % bupivacain and 2 µg of phentanyl/mL of local anesthetic. Main features of parturitients, duration of labour and outcomes of labour on mother and newborn were compared. We have excluded all labours with <b>fetal</b> breech <b>presentation,</b> multiple pregnancies, elective caesarean sections and all labours finished before 37 th week of pregnancy. Results: In nulliparous women with low-dose intermittent EPA labour was a bit longer and often finished with vacuum extraction. However level of caesarean sections was unchanged.

40|$|Abstract Background Mosaic whole-chromosome {{tetrasomy}} has {{not previously}} {{been described as}} a cause of <b>fetal</b> malformations. Case <b>presentation</b> In a markedly dysmorphic child with heart malformations and developmental delay, CGH analysis of newborn blood DNA suggested a 50 % dose increase of chromosomes 8 and 18, despite a normal standard karyotype investigation. Subsequent FISH analysis revealed leukocytes with four chromosomes 8 and four chromosomes 18. The child's phenotype had resemblance to both mosaic trisomy 8 and mosaic trisomy 18. The double tetrasomy was caused by mitotic malsegregation of all four chromatids of both chromosome pairs. A possible origin of such an error is incomplete correction of a tetraploid state resulting from failed cytokinesis or mitotic slippage during early embryonic development. Conclusion This unique case suggests that embryonic cells may have a mechanism for tetraploidy correction that involves mitotic pairing of homologous chromosomes. </p...|$|R

To {{investigate}} spontaneous changes in <b>fetal</b> <b>presentation</b> {{during the second half}} of gestation in guinea pig fetus, 2. to observe provoked changes of <b>fetal</b> <b>presentation,</b> by passive positioning fetus into an upside-down position and “sitting” position. Eight fetuses from singleton pregnancies were included. Experimental design: Ultrasound examinations (Toshiba Nemio SSA- 550 A apparatus) were started on the 26 th day of gestation (GD). Each fetus was examined 2 - 3 times in each 5 -day interval until the end of gestation. First the spontaneous orientation of fetus was determined by tracking along the longitudinal and transversal axes of the fetus with the ultrasound probe. Then the fetus was brought into a head-down position relative to gravity for 5 minutes. The examination was repeated with the fetus in the head-up position. Results: In the period from the 26 th – 30 th GD in 7 of 21 observations spontaneous changes of presentation were observed. From the 31 st GD all 133 observations were negative regarding spontaneous changes of presentation and situs. The chi-squared test showed that difference in spontaneous changes of presentation and situs before versus after 30 th day of gestation had a statistical significance (χ² = 25. 16 p 0. 05).

In order to correct <b>fetal</b> <b>presentation,</b> the stimulation of the acupoint BL 67 by moxibustion, acupuncture or both has been proposed. Since no studies had previously been carried out on Western populations, pregnant Italian women at 33 - 35 weeks gestational age carrying a fetus in breech presentation were enrolled in a randomized, controlled trial involving an active BL 67 point stimulation and an observation group. METHODS: A total of 240 women at 33 - 35 weeks of gestation carrying a fetus in breech presentation were randomized to receive active treatment (acupuncture plus moxibustion) or to be assigned to the observation group. Bilateral acupuncture plus moxibustion was applied at the BL 67 acupoint (Zhiyin). The primary outcome {{of the study was}} <b>fetal</b> <b>presentation</b> at delivery. RESULTS: Fourteen cases dropped out. The final analysis was thus made on 226 cases, 114 randomized to observation and 112 to acupuncture plus moxibustion. At delivery, the proportion of cephalic version was lower in the observation group (36. 7 %) than in the active-treatment group (53. 6 %) (p = 0. 01). Hence, the proportion of Cesarean sections indicated for breech presentation was significantly lower in the treatment group than in the observation group (52. 3 % vs. 66. 7 %, p = 0. 03).

40|$|Objective: This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} whether fetal arm movements change when music is presented to the mother or directly to the fetus through the mother's lower abdomen, and whether maternal mood influences changes in fetal arm movements. Methods: Using a diagnostic ultrasound apparatus, fetal arm movements were measured in 47 pregnant women in the 35 - 36 th week of pregnancy. Subjects {{were divided into two}} groups: a maternal presentation group, in which the mothers listened to music through headphones; and a <b>fetal</b> <b>presentation</b> group, in which music was presented directly to the fetus through headphones placed on the mother's abdomen. Fetal arm movements were observed and recorded by ultrasound for a total of 10 min (5 min without music followed by 5 min with music). The music used was Mozart's Sonata for Two Pianos in D Major, K. 448. The Profile of Mood States-Brief Form (POMS) was used to investigate the influence of maternal mood on fetal arm movements. Results: In the maternal presentation group, changes in fetal arm movement did not differ between mothers with different moods. In the <b>fetal</b> <b>presentation</b> group, fetal arm movements increased when the mother was energetic and decreased when the mother lacked energy. Fetal arm movement also decreased when the mother had a high level of fatigue and increased when the mother had a low level of fatigue.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} cardiovascular effects and fetal behavior during moxibustion, acupuncture or acupuncture plus moxibustion applied on the BL. 67 acupoint of women (beside the outer corner of the 5 th toenail) in <b>fetal</b> breech <b>presentation.</b> During the acupoint stimulation (20 min, two times a week), the women were submitted to computerized non-stress test. Fourteen cases were treated by both acupuncture and moxibustion, 15 cases by moxibustion and 10 cases by acupuncture. In 56 % of cases, fetal position was converted from breech position to cephalic one; the success share was 80 % for moxibustion, 28 % for acupuncture, 57 % for acupuncture plus moxibustion; the conversion, on average, was achieved after 3 sessions. Statistical analysis indicated that acupuncture plus moxibustion was able to reduce fetal heart rate during the application of stimuli while acupuncture and moxibustion separately did not affect such parameter. Moreover, moxibustion and acupuncture with moxibustion reduced fetal movements while acupuncture only appears ineffective. The present study suggests that fetal movements were reduced by both acupuncture plus moxibustion and moxibustion and that fetal heart rate was reduced just by acupuncture plus moxibustion.
