5|$|In March 2011, Conroy fell {{seriously ill}} with a {{suspected}} vascular aneurysm. He successfully {{recovered from the}} illness after undergoing a life-saving emergency operation that had a survival rate of just 10%. Whilst in hospital he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> last rites twice. He published his autobiography, You Don't Remember Me Do You?, in August 2014.|$|E
5|$|Health: Brown said {{he wanted}} doctors' {{surgeries}} to open at weekends, and GPs to be on-call in the evenings. Doctors <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> right {{to opt out of}} out-of-hours care two years before under a controversial pay deal signed by then-Health Secretary John Reid, that awarded them a 22 percent pay rise in 2006. Lord Ara Darzi was appointed to review NHS service delivery, especially in London. Proposed policies included the induction of polyclinics, which would be open to tender and possibly run by private companies.|$|E
5|$|Julia {{had started}} {{going out to}} dance halls in 1942, and met a Welsh soldier named 'Taffy' Williams who was {{stationed}} in the barracks at Mossley Hill. Alf blamed himself for this, as he had written letters telling Julia that {{because there was a}} war on, she should go out and enjoy herself. Julia took his advice, and often gave her young son a piece of chocolate or sugar pastry the next morning for breakfast that she <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> night before. She became pregnant by Williams in late 1944, though first claiming that she had been raped by an unknown soldier.|$|E

Robson revealed on 7 May 2007 he had been diagnosed with cancer for the fifth time. On 17 May 2008, Robson was the guest of honour at the 2008 FA Cup Final at Wembley Stadium when Portsmouth defeated Cardiff City 1–0. He presented the trophy to the victorious captain, Sol Campbell.|$|E
5|$|Once the Space Telescope project <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> go-ahead, work on {{the program}} was divided among many institutions. Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) was given {{responsibility}} for the design, development, and construction of the telescope, while Goddard Space Flight Center was given overall control of the scientific instruments and ground-control center for the mission. MSFC commissioned the optics company Perkin-Elmer to design and build the Optical Telescope Assembly (OTA) and Fine Guidance Sensors for the space telescope. Lockheed was commissioned to construct and integrate the spacecraft in which the telescope would be housed.|$|E
5|$|Other {{legislation}} {{of importance}} includes the Treason Act of 1351. It {{was precisely the}} harmony of the reign that allowed a consensus on the definition of this controversial crime. Yet the most significant legal reform was probably that concerning the Justices of the Peace. This institution began before the reign of Edward III but, by 1350, the justices <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> power not only to investigate crimes and make arrests, but also to try cases, including those of felony. With this, an enduring fixture {{in the administration of}} local English justice had been created.|$|E

5|$|The Soviets {{selected}} Vsevolod Bobrov as {{the coach}} for the series. Bobrov was a former player who had played against Team Canada in the 1950s and later managed the Soviet national soccer team and the Moscow Spartak ice hockey team. Bobrov <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> job as the Soviets' national ice hockey team coach, replacing long-time coach Anatoli Tarasov after the 1972 Winter Olympics. This was his second international assignment; his first was the 1972 World Championship, where Czechoslovakia had defeated the Soviet Union, ending a run of nine consecutive championships by the Soviets.|$|E
5|$|The {{plans were}} {{strongly}} opposed by Thomas Wilfred Sharp, an urban planner from Durham, {{who thought that}} the station would intrude on the city's skyline. They were also opposed by The City of Durham Preservation Society (now the City of Durham Trust) which had been founded two years earlier. At the time the station <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> go ahead by Durham City Council and the planning authority, but the Trust believed the station's tall chimneys and cooling towers would dwarf the nearby Durham Cathedral.|$|E
5|$|A {{week after}} {{appearing}} against England in a warm-up match in Moscow for the 1958 World Cup, Streltsov {{was invited to}} a party by a Soviet military officer, Eduard Karakhanov, to be held on 25 May. Streltsov {{and the rest of}} the Soviet squad were on a pre-World Cup training camp at Tarasovka, just outside Moscow, but the team <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> day as holiday. At the end of such days, the players had to report to the authorities at Dynamo Stadium at 4:30pm, but Streltsov and two team-mates, Spartak players Mikhail Ogonkov and Boris Tatushin, ignored this rule and went to the party anyway. Held at Karakhanov's dacha, it was also attended by a 20-year-old woman named Marina Lebedeva, whom Streltsov had never met. The following morning, Streltsov, Ogonkov and Tatushin were all arrested and charged with raping her.|$|E

5|$|By 1941 radar {{was slowly}} being {{introduced}} within the Navy and Hordern was appointed {{as one of}} the first operatives who communicated enemy movements to the RAF. He later said that the post was owed to his clear diction and deep vocal range. His commentary impressed his superior officers so much that by early 1942 he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> job as a Fighter Direction Officer, and then first lieutenant on board HMS Illustrious. Shortly after the departure of his immediate superior, he was promoted to lieutenant commander, a post which he occupied for two years. Alongside his naval responsibilities, he was also appointed as the ship's entertainment officer, and was responsible for organising shows featuring various members of Illustriouss crew as the show's cast.|$|E
5|$|Domitian's {{campaign}} against Dacia was overall unsuccessful; however, the Romans winning {{in a minor}} skirmish allowed him to claim it as a victory, even though he ended up paying the King of Dacia, Decebalus, an annual tribute of eight million sesterces in tribute to end the war. Domitian returned to Rome, and received an ovation, but not a full triumph. Considering that Domitian <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> title of Imperator for military victories 22 times, this was markedly restrained, suggesting that the populace, {{or at least the}} senate, was {{aware of the fact that}} it had been a less than successful war, despite Domitian's claims otherwise. However, in 89AD, Domitian invaded the Iazyges, along with the Quadi and Marcomanni. Few details are known of this war, but it is recorded that the Romans were defeated.|$|E
5|$|Gaveston was not exiled immediately; he did {{not have}} to leave the realm until 25 June, but faced excommunication by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Winchelsey, should he return. Edward used the {{intervening}} period to provide for his favourite's continued prosperity and political importance. As a compensation for the loss of the earldom of Cornwall, which was another condition of the exile, Gaveston was granted land worth 3,000 marks annually in Gascony, and land amounting to the same value in England. Further to this, he was appointed the King's Lieutenant of Ireland, so that a certain amount of honour could be maintained despite the humiliation of the exile. The appointment came the day after Richard de Burgh, Earl of Ulster, <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> same position, indicating that it was an improvised measure. Gaveston's appointment came with wider authority than Ulster's, however, for he had full regal powers to appoint and dismiss any royal officers.|$|E

5|$|In {{the ensuing}} inquiry, chaired by Rear Admiral Reinhold von Werner, Monts {{testified that he}} had not been given {{sufficient}} time to familiarize himself with the ship and its crew, who were themselves unfamiliar with the vessel. Monts argued that the mobilization process for the newly commissioned ship should have lasted four to six weeks, rather than the three he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>given.</b> <b>The</b> day before the squadron left Wilhelmshaven, Batsch complained to General Albrecht von Stosch, the chief of the Kaiserliche Marine, that a significant number of dockyard workers were still finishing work on Grosser Kurfürst. Werner and the board determined that Admiral Batsch was at fault and exonerated Monts.|$|E
5|$|Moonlight {{garnered}} {{awards and}} nominations {{in a variety}} of categories with particular praise for its direction and the performances of Ali and Harris. At the 89th Academy Awards, the film received eight nominations including Best Picture, Best Director for Jenkins and Best Supporting Actress for Harris. It went on to win Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor for Ali, and Best Adapted Screenplay. At the ceremony, romantic musical La La Land was incorrectly announced as the winner of Best Picture after the presenters <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> wrong envelope. Moonlight was the first LGBT-themed film to win Best Picture and Ali's win was the first for a Muslim actor in Academy Awards history. The film garnered six nominations at the 74th Golden Globe Awards and won Best Motion Picture– Drama. At the 70th British Academy Film Awards, Moonlight earned four nominations including Best Film, Best Actor in a Supporting Role for Ali, and Best Actress in a Supporting Role for Harris.|$|E
5|$|The GAL.48 was {{primarily}} designed by F.F. Crocombe (team leader) to the Air Ministry specification X.10/40, and {{was to be}} similar in design to the German DFS 230 assault glider which {{had been used in}} the Battle of the Netherlands. The first prototype of the glider, designated GAL.48 and which would receive the service name Hotspur Mk I, flew in November, only four months after General Aircraft Ltd <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> requirement for the glider. An initial order of 400 Hotspurs was placed with General Aircraft Ltd in September by the Ministry of Aircraft Production, nearly two months before the prototype first flew.|$|E

5|$|By July 1944, No.10 Group's {{position}} in western New Guinea was complicating Northern Command's efforts to supply it, {{and the group}} was made independent of the command. The next month, Northern Command headquarters transferred to Madang. In September, No.71 Wing was detached from No.10 Group to Northern Command, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> task of supporting the Australian 6thDivision in the Aitape–Wewak campaign. Headquartered at Tadji in northern New Guinea, No.71 Wing comprised Nos.7, 8 and 100 Bristol Beaufort Squadrons, augmented by a flight of CAC Boomerangs from No.4 (Army Cooperation) Squadron. No.74 (Composite) Wing, which had been formed in August 1943 and was headquartered at Port Moresby, also came {{under the aegis of}} Northern Command. The command's other major operational formation was No.84 (Army Cooperation) Wing, which began moving from Australia to Torokina on Bougainville in October 1944. By this time, Northern Command controlled six squadrons in the New Guinea area. No.79 Wing, equipped with B-25 Mitchells, was earmarked for transfer from North-Western Area to Northern Command, to undertake operations in New Britain, but its proposed airfield was not ready and it was instead transferred to the First Tactical Air Force at Labuan the following year.|$|E
5|$|Further {{excavations}} were {{undertaken in}} the 1920s by C. R. Peers, who found that the nave of the original church had external doors on the north, south and west sides, and that the chancel had doors leading into {{the north and south}} porticus, which in turn had external doors on their eastern sides. Regarding the floor described by Dowker, Peers noted that the surface consisted of a thin layer of pounded brick, and believed that it was of the same date as the stone which Dowker described as the foundations for the stone cross. Excavations also revealed steps leading down to the burial vault reported by Dowker, although Peers did not refer to either the steps or the vault in his report. Extensions of the porticus to the west and around the original west front were dated to no more than 100years after the church was first built, and Peers observed that these extensions <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> same type of floor as the original church. Drawing comparisons with the 7th-century chapel of St Peter-on-the-Wall at Bradwell-on-Sea, in Essex, and the abbey of St Augustine at Canterbury, Peers suggested that the original church at Reculver probably had windows set high in the northern and southern walls of the nave. Areas of wall found by archaeologists but now missing above ground are marked on the site by strips of concrete edged with flint.|$|E
5|$|Gloucester {{remained}} in the inner circle around the king over the next months. In the summer of 1313, he was again guardian of the realm while the king was in France, and in February 1314, {{he was sent to}} France on a diplomatic mission regarding Gascony. The greatest problem of the reign, however, remained the unresolved conflict with Scotland, and the resurgence of Robert the Bruce. In the summer of 1314, Edward finally embarked on a major Scottish campaign. The objective was to protect the English garrison at Stirling Castle from an attack by Bruce. The campaign was impeded by the absence of some of the greater magnates, such as Lancaster and Warwick. There were still a number of great lords in the king's company, including Humphrey de Bohun, Earl of Hereford, Pembroke and Gloucester. These men were valuable to the king for their ability to raise large numbers of troops from their dominions in the Welsh Marches. On 23June 1314, the royal army had passed Falkirk and was within a few miles of Stirling. There were, however, signs of strife between the earls of Gloucester and Hereford. Gloucester <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> command of the English vanguard, a position he had earned through his loyalty to the king. Yet Hereford, who had been placed under Gloucester's command, believed the command belonged to him, in his capacity of hereditary Constable of England.|$|E
