25|$|An oast, oast {{house or}} <b>hop</b> <b>kiln</b> is a {{building}} designed for kilning (drying) hops {{as part of}} the brewing process. They can be found in most hop-growing (and former hop-growing) areas and are often good examples of vernacular architecture. Many redundant oasts have been converted into houses. The names oast and oast house are used interchangeably in Kent and East Sussex. In Surrey, Hampshire, Hereford and Worcester they are always called hop kilns.|$|E

Taken over by a major brewer (Courage) brewing ceased but malting continued into the 1960s, when Courage planned to sell off the site for redevelopment. The people of Farnham raised enough money to buy the building so that it could be converted into a community centre for the town.

5000|$|Also {{known as}} hop houses or <b>hop</b> <b>kilns,</b> <b>hop</b> barns were {{very common in}} areas of the United States where hops were grown. Hop barns were so common it was said that [...] "every other farm" [...] had one. In New York state's [...] "hop belt" [...] {{numerous}} hop barns were constructed between the early 19th century {{and the beginning of the}} 20th century. Ostego, Chenango, Madison, Oneida, Montgomery and Schoharie Counties were the primary areas contained within the hop belt. As hops production basically dwindled down to only Washington state, in the U.S., the remaining hop houses elsewhere have begun to disappear. Defunct <b>hop</b> <b>kilns</b> are found in areas where hops production is still ongoing, in Kent, England, for instance.|$|R

50|$|The Tack was {{probably}} a successful medieval sheep farm since the name {{is derived from the}} Anglo-Saxon tacca. A farmhouse stood on the Tenbury Road; built of stone in 1838 it contained a large <b>hop</b> <b>kiln</b> and granary in a complex of buildings, now part of the dwelling. Among its quirky features included two bays in a stable block once used as servants quarters that were built circa 1800.|$|E

50|$|Hops {{were once}} a {{predominant}} crop grown around Ukiah. The beer flavoring agent was first grown there in 1868 when L.F. Long of Largo grew an initial experimental crop. The climate proved suitable for the crop and production expanded, peaking in 1885, before faltering somewhat {{in the last years}} of the 1880s due to declining prices. Mendocino County remained the third largest producer of hops in the state of California in 1890, with well over 900 acres under cultivation, and production continued well into the 20th Century. A refurbished <b>hop</b> <b>kiln</b> can be seen at the north end of Ukiah east of Highway 101, where many of the old fields were located.|$|E
50|$|Corinthian capitals atop {{decorated}} columns were in {{the same}} school as Inkberrow and Bromsberrow Place in the neighbouring county. The older east and front wings were made of stone; bent or chamfered roof beams vacated space in loft for living. Amongst the extensive stabling and outbuildings were <b>hop</b> <b>kilns,</b> a brewhouse, bakehouse and cider house, and octagonal dove cote. But the house was dilapidated by 1939 when occupied by the evacuated Westminster School.|$|R
50|$|Around the 1880s {{the areas}} main produce {{came in the}} form of farming and crops {{included}} wheat, oats, potatoes, barley, maize and <b>hops.</b> The <b>Hop</b> <b>Kilns</b> that serviced the area are still standing at Mossiface on the flats of the Tambo River and adjacent to the East Gippsland Rail Trail. The nearby township of Bruthen was the centre of one of Australia's leading tobacco growing areas with Charles Seehusen being the innovator of this crop.|$|R
5000|$|Ownership of {{the estate}} itself then passed to Hammond of Bodenham, who leased it to Richard Hankin. He rose from a yeoman tenant farmer to a [...] "gentleman" [...] owner of the [...] "mansion house" [...] by 1700. Hankin was {{responsible}} for the form of the farmhouse as it is seen today, together with the extended <b>hop</b> <b>kilns</b> and a dovecote shown on old plans, although the latter has long since disappeared.|$|R
50|$|From Bumberrah {{the trail}} travels 8.5 km on to Mossiface, passing through various cuttings, fills and tunnels {{from the old}} rail route. The surface is rough gravel and of poor {{standard}} through much of this section, including occasional wombat holes, but there is significant flora and fauna, {{as well as some}} good views of adjacent farmland and hills. Mossiface, a tiny locality of only a few houses and facilities, was the site of the former Mossiface railway station and offers views of the Tambo River flats and historic <b>hop</b> <b>kilns</b> of the region.|$|R
2500|$|Oast {{houses are}} often called <b>hop</b> <b>kilns</b> in Australia. Tasmania {{is a major}} hop-growing area, as were parts of Victoria. During the 19th century, some of the Kentish hop growers emigrated, and took hops with them. Initially, Tasmanian oasts were {{converted}} from existing buildings (New Norfolk, Ranelagh) but later purpose built oasts were built (Valley Field, Bushy Park). These oasts had louvred ventilators instead of a cowl. The New Norfolk oast was converted from a watermill {{and is now a}} museum. Another location that has oasts was Tyenna. A modern oast of [...] was built at Bushy Park in 1982.|$|R
50|$|In the US, Prohibition had a {{major impact}} on hops productions, but {{remnants}} of this significant industry in West and Northwest US are still noticeable in the form of old <b>hop</b> <b>kilns</b> that survive throughout Sonoma County, among others. Florian Dauenhauer, of Santa Rosa in Sonoma County, became a manufacturer of hop-harvesting machines in 1940, {{in part because of the}} hop industry's importance to the county. This mechanization helped destroy the local industry by enabling large-scale mechanized production, which moved to larger farms in other areas. Dauenhauer Manufacturing remains a current producer of hop harvesting machines.|$|R

5000|$|Archibald MacLeod was {{the first}} settler to take up land in the area now covered by the present town. He called his run [...] "Bernisdale" [...] after his birthplace on the Isle of Skye. Legend {{has it that the}} name was changed to its present {{spelling}} when MacLeod was surprised by the number of [...] "bairns" [...] ("children" [...] in the Scots language) which had appeared in the settlement. However, it seems more likely that the spelling was merely altered to fit local pronunciation.In the 1850s and 1860s the town grew {{as a result of its}} location on the Mitchell River and its access to the sea. It became a supply port for the East Gippsland goldfields until the railways were established later in the century. Goods were shipped into Lake King, up the Mitchell River to Bairnsdale then hauled overland, often by bullock teams. Ships were then loaded with cattle products and wool from the surrounding area for the return trip to Melbourne. The hops cultivated in the Mitchell Valley between 1868 and 1916 were also transported to Bairnsdale for shipment to the <b>hop</b> <b>kilns.</b> Some of the <b>Hop</b> <b>Kilns</b> still remain till this day on the eastern side of the Mitchell River. A bridge over the Mitchell River was commenced in 1870 and completed in 1875. A lift bridge was originally envisaged so that ships could continue along the Mitchell River to the original wharf near The Butter Factory.|$|R
500|$|By {{at least}} the mid-19th century, East Worldham {{and most of the}} parish of Worldham was owned by both Winchester College and the Dutton Estate. From the early 1860s when Dr. Fell became vicar in the village, East Worldham {{underwent}} dramatic change, which the renovation of the church and additions of <b>hop</b> <b>kilns</b> to the local farms and the building of new cottages, most of which form the urban landscape of the village today. In 1892 Mr Hall of Alton, financed the [...] "lowering of the gradients of Worldham Hill by smoothing out four sections", a steep hill which had caused many problems to the local inhabitants as it lay along the main road to the village. The first Parish Council meeting took place in 1894 in the schoolroom.|$|R
5000|$|The pioneers were {{successful}} farmers {{of the rich}} land around the town. Initially cattle and sheep were predominant, with some cropping as land was cleared. Hop plants were introduced in 1846, and became an important crop. A number of <b>hop</b> drying <b>kilns</b> or [...] "oast houses" [...] remain in the area.|$|R
40|$|Ebenezer Shoobridge (1820 - 1901) {{purchased}} Bushy Park, {{an estate}} of some 2000 acres from Mr Humphry in 1865. He introduced hop growing (hops having been first introduced to Tasmania {{by his father}} William Shoobridge) and fruit orchards, principally apples. There was also a dairy farm and some grain and root crops. His eldest son William Ebenezer Shoobridge (1846 - 1940) pioneered irrigation, built <b>hop</b> <b>kilns,</b> cottages etc. and experimented with methods of pruning fruit trees, introducing the "pyramid principle" which allowed the sun to shine on all fruit equally. Both father and son were J. P. s and served on local councils and committees and supported the Wesleyan Church. W. E. Shoobridge married Ann Benson Mather in 1869. - Transfered to the Tasmanian Archives and Heritage Office (TAHO) - Jan 2013 -www. linc. tas. gov. au/tasmaniasheritag...|$|R
50|$|Horst {{emigrated to}} the U.S. {{as a child in}} 1874 from Tuttlingen, Baden-Württemberg, Germany. In the mid 1880s he {{purchased}} a small plot of land along the Bear River, near Wheatland, California, and began cultivating hops. He soon bought out two other hop growers, Hugh Roddan and Joseph M.C. Jasper. By 1898, Horst's operation had grown to the point that ten <b>hop</b> drying <b>kilns</b> ran daily during the harvest and a company town, large enough to have its own post office, was started on the ranch to support the thousands of migrant workers who picked the mature hops each year. Given the significance of Horst's ranch, certain loamy floodplain soils found in the area were later named after him.|$|R
50|$|South Augusta, Ontario, {{refers to}} an area along County Road 26 in Augusta {{township}} near Bethel Road. The community was at its height in the late 1800s and early 1900s, with a few small businesses and farms operating here at that time. South Augusta was home to a schoolhouse, cheese factory, tannery, temperance hall, grocery store, post office, two churches, and a cemetery. Many residents made a living through farming, and <b>hop</b> and lime <b>kilns</b> were popular in the community. Today, South Augusta is a residential community.|$|R
