5|$|Aspirin <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the {{treatment}} {{of those who have}} had a myocardial infarction (heart attack). One trial found that among those likely having an ST-segment elevation MI, aspirin saves the life of 1 in 42 by reducing the 30-day death rate from 11.8% to 9.4%. There was no difference in major bleeding, but there was a small increase in minor bleeding amounting to roughly 1 in every 167 people given aspirin.|$|E

5|$|Cerium was {{the first}} of the {{lanthanides}} to be discovered, in Bastnäs, Sweden by Jöns Jakob Berzelius and Wilhelm Hisinger in 1803, and independently by Martin Heinrich Klaproth in Germany. It was first isolated by Carl Gustaf Mosander in 1839. Today, cerium and its compounds have a variety of uses: for example, cerium(IV) oxide is used to polish glass and <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> catalytic converters. Cerium metal is used in ferrocerium lighters for its pyrophoric properties.|$|E

5|$|A {{determination}} {{of whether or}} not the person has dehydration <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the assessment, with dehydration typically divided into mild (3–5%), moderate (6–9%), and severe (≥10%) cases. In children, the most accurate signs of moderate or severe dehydration are a prolonged capillary refill, poor skin turgor, and abnormal breathing. Other useful findings (when used in combination) include sunken eyes, decreased activity, a lack of tears, and a dry mouth. A normal urinary output and oral fluid intake is reassuring. Laboratory testing is of little clinical benefit in determining the degree of dehydration. Thus the use of urine testing or ultrasounds is generally not needed.|$|E
5|$|About {{one percent}} of people who receive {{treatment}} for MTBI need surgery for a brain injury. Observation to monitor for worsening condition <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> treatment. Health care providers recommend that those suffering from concussion return for further medical care and evaluation 24 to 72hours after the concussive event if the symptoms worsen. Athletes, especially intercollegiate or professional, are typically followed closely by team athletic trainers during this period but others may not have access to this level of health care and may be sent home with minimal monitoring.|$|E
5|$|Although chest {{radiography}} <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the diagnosis, {{it is often}} not sensitive enough to detect the condition early after the injury. In a third of cases, pulmonary contusion is not visible on the first chest radiograph performed. It takes an average of sixhours for the characteristic white regions {{to show up on}} a chest X-ray, and the contusion may not become apparent for 48hours. When a pulmonary contusion is apparent in an X-ray, it suggests that the trauma to the chest was severe and that a CT scan might reveal other injuries that were missed with X-ray.|$|E

5|$|Hemilepistus reaumuri <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> {{the desert}} ecosystem. It {{has been found}} at {{population}} densities of up to 480,000 individuals per hectare, which is equivalent to a biomass of 19.2kg/ha; in comparison, desert mammals are estimated to have a combined biomass of 39.9kg/ha. The main predator of H. reaumuri is the scorpion Scorpio maurus, and it may compose up to 70% of the scorpion's diet. It appears to be vulnerable to attack only on the surface; no predators are known to attack H. reaumuri in its underground burrows.|$|E
5|$|In 1963 it was {{proposed}} {{to replace the}} bridge with a modern development containing seven floors of shops, office space, hotel rooms and leisure facilities supported above the river, but the plans were abandoned because of costs. With the exception of alterations to the road layout and the balustrade, the design and appearance of the current bridge has remained almost unchanged since 1907. The bridge today <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> London's road system and carries the A202 road across the Thames.|$|E
5|$|In most cases, {{medication}} for tics is not necessary. Education <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> any treatment plan, and explanation and reassurance alone are often sufficient treatment. Many individuals with Tourette's go undiagnosed or never seek medical care. Among {{those who are}} seen in specialty clinics, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) are present at higher rates. These co-occurring diagnoses often cause more impairment to the individual than the tics; hence, {{it is important to}} correctly identify associated conditions and treat them.|$|E

5|$|Instrumental {{and vocal}} {{classical}} music is an iconic part of Italian identity, spanning experimental art music and international fusions to symphonic music and opera. Opera {{is integral to}} Italian musical culture, {{and has become a}} major segment of popular music. The Neapolitan song, canzone napoletana, and the cantautori singer-songwriter traditions are also popular domestic styles that form {{an important part of the}} Italian music industry, alongside imported genres like jazz, rock and hip hop. Italian folk music <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the country's musical heritage, and spans a diverse array of regional styles, instruments and dances.|$|E
5|$|Many {{species of}} birds are {{economically}} important as food for human consumption and raw material in manufacturing, with domesticated and undomesticated birds (poultry and game) being important sources of eggs, meat, and feathers. Songbirds, parrots, and other species are popular as pets. Guano (bird excrement) is harvested {{for use as a}} fertiliser. Birds prominently figure throughout human culture. About 120–130 species have become extinct due to human activity since the 17th century, and hundreds more before then. Human activity threatens about 1,200 bird species with extinction, though efforts are underway to protect them. Recreational birdwatching <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the ecotourism industry.|$|E
5|$|Music <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> {{education}} in the United States, and {{is a part of}} most or all school systems in the country. Music education is generally mandatory in public elementary schools, and is an elective in later years. High schools generally offer classes in singing, mostly choral, and instrumentation {{in the form of a}} large school band. Music may also be a part of theatrical productions put on by a school's drama department. Many public and private schools have sponsored music clubs and groups, most commonly including the marching band that performs at high school sports games, a trend that began with the wide popularity of Sousa's bands in the 1880s and 1890s.|$|E

5|$|Sexuality <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> each person's identity, {{although}} {{some people might}} {{have no interest in}} sex. Sexuality has biological, psychological, emotional, spiritual, social, and cultural aspects. It involves not only sexual behaviors but relationships, self-image, sex drive, reproduction, sexual orientation, and gender expression. Each person's sexuality is influenced by lifelong socialization, in which factors such as religious and cultural background play a part, and is expressed in self-esteem and the beliefs one holds about oneself (identifying as a woman, or as an attractive person).|$|E
5|$|The Murray cod (Maccullochella peelii) {{is a large}} Australian predatory {{freshwater}} fish of the Maccullochella genus and the Percichthyidae family. Although the species is called a cod in the vernacular, it {{is not related to}} the Northern Hemisphere marine cod (Gadus) species. The Murray cod <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Australia's vertebrate wildlife—as an apex predator in the Murray-Darling River system—and also significant in Australia's human culture. The Murray cod is the largest exclusively {{freshwater fish}} in Australia, and {{one of the largest in}} the world. Other common names for Murray cod include cod, greenfish, goodoo, Mary River cod, Murray perch, ponde, pondi and Queensland freshwater cod.|$|E

The authorities hope the symbolic replica can serve to preserve the memory of Long Ya Men, which <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Singapore's maritime history, for future generations and visitors familiar with the historical voyages of Zheng He.|$|E
