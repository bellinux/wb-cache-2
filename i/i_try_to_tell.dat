500|$|Weiland's lyrics were {{unique to}} {{previous}} albums, {{which had been}} solely focused on himself and his drug addictions. He studied lyricists {{to learn how to}} write differently. [...] " [...] the '90s, I was so overwhelmed with my heroin addiction, and so {{a lot of the stuff}} was just from my point of view. Now, I tend to look at some of the greats like Leonard Cohen and Bob Dylan. I look at their storytelling [...] <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> stories. Every song doesn't have to be narcissistically written about how I feel on that day." [...] Stone Temple Pilots became the third album Weiland had ever recorded sober, after Velvet Revolver's Libertad and Stone Temple Pilot's first album, Core. Weiland was also influenced by his ex-wife, Mary Forsberg, about whom he specifically wrote on [...] "Cinnamon". Weiland's inspiration for [...] "First Kiss on Mars" [...] came from the music itself. He explained his lyrics succinctly: [...] "When I first heard , it sounded intergalactic." [...] Critics and interviewers of the band noticed that Weiland's vocalizations were drawn from David Bowie.|$|E
500|$|The video {{taken from}} the DVD [...] was {{uploaded}} onto YouTube by Beyoncé's Vevo account on December 21, 2011. It begins with the singer singing the song seated while wearing a sparkly mini dress. Later, the guitarist in her all-female band comes {{next to her and}} performs a guitar solo while Beyoncé sings the bridge. Kenneth Partridge of The Boombox praised the performance writing that [...] "the R megastar is all growls and snarling glances". He further stated that she looked like [...] "a triumphant rock 'n' roll goddess" [...] while performing [...] "I Care". A writer of The Huffington Post praised the performance writing that [...] "'I Care'... showcases an impressive amount of Beyonce-ness. As she belts the lyrics 'You see these tears falling down to my ears/ I swear you like when I'm in pain/ <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you all my fears/ You still don't care?/ That's okay,' Beyonce bedazzles in a sparkly getup and an impressive amount of hair-whipping." [...] During the ITV special A Night With Beyoncé which aired on December 4 in the United Kingdom, Beyoncé performed [...] "I Care" [...] to a selected crowd of fans.|$|E

6000|$|Pallas and the Madonna were {{supposed}} to be all the world's Pallas, and all the world's Madonna. They could teach all men, and they could comfort all men. But, look strictly into the nature of the power of your Goddess of Getting-on; and you will find she is the Goddess--not of everybody's getting on--but only of somebody's getting on. This is a vital, or rather deathful, distinction. Examine it in your own ideal of the state of national life which this Goddess is to evoke and maintain. I asked you what it was, when I was last here;[5]--you have never told me. Now, shall <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you? ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You don't need to {{describe}} it," [...] returned March. [...] "I {{have it all}} described splendidly within me. One don't want words when one's got feelins. But I've often thought what a pity {{it is that we}} can't describe things or places at all with words. At least, I can't," [...] he added modestly. [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> a fellow what I've seen, it ain't o' no manner of use to try, for I don't get hold of the right words at the right time, and so don't give out the right meanin', and so the fellow I'm speakin' to don't take up the right notion, d'ye see?

But before I go, Mr. Stenson has sent you a little message, Julian.

The German line has been broken at half a dozen points. We have taken nearly twenty thousand prisoners, and Zeebrugge is threatened. Farther south, the Americans have made their start and have won a complete victory over the Crown Prince's picked troops." ...|$|E

6000|$|Mrs. Charmond was now as much {{agitated}} as Grace. [...] "I {{ought not}} to allow myself to argue with you," [...] she exclaimed. [...] "I demean myself by doing it.

[...] Much of her confusion resulted from her wonder and alarm at finding herself in a sense dominated mentally and emotionally by this simple school-girl. [...] "I do not love him," [...] she went on, with desperate untruth. [...] "It was a kindness--my making somewhat more of him than one usually does of one's doctor. I was lonely; I talked--well, I trifled with him. I am very sorry if such child's playing out of pure friendship has been a serious matter to you. Who could have expected it? But the world is so simple here." ...|$|E
6000|$|DEAR MR. ARCHER,--Yes, I {{have heard}} of you and read some of your work; but I am bound in {{particular}} {{to thank you for}} the notice of my verses. [...] "There," [...] I said, throwing it over to the friend who was staying with me, [...] "it's worth writing a book to draw an article like that." [...] Had you been as hard upon me as you were amiable, <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> myself I should have been no blinder to the merits of your notice. For I saw there, to admire and to be very grateful for, a most sober, agile pen; an enviable touch; the marks of a reader, such as one imagines for one's self in dreams, thoughtful, critical, and kind; and to put the top on this memorial column, a greater readiness to describe the author criticised than to display the talents of his censor.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] began Allan, [...] "you {{know what}} I said {{when we got}} to this hotel; I said I had a place to go to in Bayswater" [...] (Pedgift mentally checked off the first point: Case in the suburbs, Bayswater); [...] "and a person--that is to say--no--as I said before, a person to inquire after." [...] (Pedgift checked off the next point: Person in the case. She-person, or he-person? She-person, unquestionably!) [...] "Well, I went to the house, and when I asked for her--I mean the person--she--that is to say, the person--oh, {{confound}} it!" [...] cried Allan, [...] "I shall drive myself mad, and you, too, if <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> my story in this roundabout way. Here it is in two words. I went to No. 18 Kingsdown Crescent, to see a lady named Mandeville; and, when I asked for her, the servant said Mrs. Mandeville had gone away, without telling anybody where, and without even leaving an address at which letters could be sent to her. There! it's out at last. And {{what do you think of}} it now?" ...|$|E
60|$|Between us {{we picked}} them up and {{replaced}} them in the broken bag, which he now held carefully {{in the hollow of}} his arm. <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> him my gladness at meeting him and that he must come right home with me.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{would not}} {{understand}} if <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you. <b>I</b> {{can only say}} it is a lovely place where we go when we die, and the angels don't puzzle over us at all, but love us and are glad to see us come," [...] said Nelly, soberly.|$|R
5000|$|... "All {{this is very}} nice. I think it's a good festival, {{especially}} as it brought so many filmmakers to socialize.I had the unforgettable experience while teaching and <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> a lot about producing and how authors can persuade producers to open their wallets and fund projects," [...] said Nickson.|$|R
6000|$|... 34. In {{this and}} the two next {{following}} lectures, I shall endeavour therefore {{to show you the}} grave relations of human art, in these three functions, to human life. I can do this but roughly, as you may well suppose--since each of these subjects would require for its right treatment years instead of hours. Only, remember, I have already given years, not a few, to each of them; and what <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you now will be only so much as is absolutely necessary to set our work on a clear foundation. You may not, at present, see the necessity for any foundation, and may think that I ought to put pencil and paper in your hands at once. On that point I must simply answer, [...] "Trust me a little while," [...] asking you however also to remember, that--irrespectively of any consideration of last or first--my true function here is not that of your master in painting, or sculpture, or pottery; but to show you what it is that makes any of these arts fine, or the contrary of fine: essentially good, or essentially base. You need not fear my not being practical enough for you; all the industry you choose to give me, I will take; but far the better part of what you may gain by such industry would be lost, if I did not first lead you to see what every form of art-industry intends, and why some of it is justly called right, and some wrong.|$|E
5000|$|Perry, {{the child}} in the crib, has spoken about the {{problems}} he faced growing up. [...] "All the way through school I was a bully because I wanted people to hurt as bad as I did.

When I see those people today, <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> them that, but they just don't understand." ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{light of}} recent {{speculation}} {{as to the}} status of David Kennedy and Eddie Breckenridge with the band, Delonge confirmed during an interview with Rock Sound on November 11 that both members were still involved with Angels & Airwaves, though he did not specify to what extent, claiming [...] "I think people are just confused. I get it, but <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> people to look at the whole project, not at any one piece. This isn’t just a band, it’s {{a little bit of a}} moving target and a much bigger project.".|$|E

5000|$|In December 2012, Michael C. Hall, {{who plays}} Dexter Morgan on Dexter, {{was interviewed by}} Jian Ghomeshi on the Canadian radio show Q. Hall {{said he does not}} think Dexter {{supports}} the lifestyle of serial killers. [...] "I would hope that people's appreciation was more than some sort of fetishization with the kill scenes," [...] he said. Ghomeshi brought up Twitchell and Hall said, [...] "I wouldn't stop making Dexter because someone was fascinated by it only in that way. <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> myself that their fixated nature would have done it one way or the other, but it seems that Dexter {{had something to do with}} it. It's horrifying." ...|$|E
5000|$|The stele of Vinaya Master Baekpa is a {{monument}} to the master, a great expert in Avatamsaka studies. After Ven. Baekpa died, Kim Jeong-hui (aka Chusa), who had debated Seon Buddhism with him, grieved over his death and wrote the content for its inscription. In part it says: “In the past I shared opinions about Seon with Baekpa through repeated correspondence, which is greatly different from the vain talk of the grape vine. About this only Baekpa and I know the content in full. Even if <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> people about it over and over in ten thousand different ways, no one can understand it.

50|$|In a 1995 interview, Lien {{said the}} {{following}} about these conventions: The conventions are something within themselves, a unique world. It’s {{a very different}} experience in that I can talk to other {{people involved in the}} world of Star Trek, like authors and actors from other Star Trek shows. I also get to meet people from other SF shows, because they tend to have guests from other series at the conventions I attend. The fans love the conventions, love meeting the people involved in their favorite shows. That makes you want to give them everything you can. <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> them what’s going on, share my laughter and tell them about the wonderful experience I've been having on Voyager. The feedback is just so positive. The fans seem to really like the show, and that's good. If they have any negative feedback, they give it to me, too, which is fine. They're usually pretty respectful, and they come up with things that are very interesting - positive and negative - and I get sucked into it.|$|E
