40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{innovation and}} <b>design</b> <b>processes</b> in small established companies. There {{is a great}} interest in this area yet paradoxically the area is under-researched, since most innovation research is done on large companies. The research questions are: How do small established companies carry out their innovation and <b>design</b> <b>processes?</b> and How does the context and novelty of the process and product affect the same processes? The thesis is built on three research papers that used the research method of multiple case studies of different small established companies. The innovation and <b>design</b> <b>processes</b> found were highly context dependent and were facilitated by committed resources, a creative climate, vision, low family involvement, delegated power and authority, and linkages to external actors such as customers and users. Both experimental cyclical and linear structured <b>design</b> <b>processes</b> were found. The choice of structure is explained by the relative product and process novelty experienced by those developing the product innovation. Linear <b>design</b> <b>processes</b> worked within a low relative novelty situation and cyclical <b>design</b> <b>processes</b> worked no matter the relative novelty. The innovation and <b>design</b> <b>processes</b> found were informal, with a low usage of formal systematic design methods, except in the case of <b>design</b> <b>processes</b> for software. The use of formal systematic methods in small companies seems not always to be efficient, because many of the problems the methods are designed to solve are not present. Customers and users were found to play a large and important role in the innovation and <b>design</b> <b>processes</b> found and gave continuous feedback during the <b>design</b> <b>processes.</b> Innovation processes were found to be intertwined, yielding synergy effects, but it was common that resources were taken from the innovation processes for acute problems that threatened the cash flow. In sum, small established companies have the natural prerequisites to take advantage of lead-user inventions and cyclical <b>design</b> <b>processes.</b> Scarce resources were found to be the main factor hindering innovation, but the examined companies practiced several approaches to increase their resources or use existing scarce resources more efficiently in their innovation and <b>design</b> <b>processes.</b> Examples of these approaches include adopting lead-user inventions and reducing formality in the innovation and <b>design</b> <b>processes.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{reusability}} of <b>design</b> <b>processes</b> modeled {{in existing}} Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) and Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) frameworks {{has been limited}} {{to the level of}} flow charts or activity-based diagrams that serve as planning and organizational aids. Current simulation-based design frameworks provide limited support for reuse of <b>design</b> <b>processes</b> at a level where <b>design</b> <b>processes</b> are networks of computational operations, specifically the capabilities to reuse (a) <b>design</b> <b>processes</b> for different products, and (b) collaborative design strategies. In this article, we address these limitations by providing a modeling approach for simulation-based <b>design</b> <b>processes</b> {{so that they can be}} archived in a generic modular fashion and reused for collaborative design of different products. The proposed approach is based on four foundations: (a) modeling <b>design</b> <b>processes</b> as hierarchical systems, (b) separation of declarative and procedural information, (c) modeling <b>design</b> <b>processes</b> as decision-centric activities, and (d) modeling interactions between decision makers using game theoretic protocols. These four fundamentals of the approach are instantiated in the form of generic computational templates for products, processes, decisions, and pertinent interfaces. The approach is illustrated using a proof of concept implementation in ModelCenter. The implementation is validated by showing the reusability of <b>design</b> <b>processes</b> for two different products, a spring and a pressure vessel, in individual and collaborative design scenarios. The approach has potential for supporting reusability of broader PLM processes...|$|R

40|$|For {{large and}} complex design-processes {{traditional}} approaches to <b>process</b> <b>design</b> {{may no longer}} suffice.

As a result, the 767's <b>design</b> <b>process</b> emphasized fuel efficiency from the outset. Boeing targeted a 20 to 30percent cost saving over earlier aircraft, mainly through new engine and wing technology. As development progressed, engineers used computer-aided design for {{over a third of}} the 767's design drawings, and performed 26,000 hours of wind tunnel tests. Design work occurred concurrently with the 757 twinjet, leading Boeing to treat both as almost one program to reduce risk and cost. Both aircraft would ultimately receive shared design features, including avionics, flight management systems, instruments, and handling characteristics. Combined development costs were estimated at $3.5 to $4billion.|$|E

40|$|Complex {{mechanical}} products are a priority area of advanced manufacturing {{strategy in the}} USA and Europe. Excellent models for <b>design</b> <b>processes</b> of complex {{mechanical products}} are essential for managers or designers to manage <b>design</b> <b>processes</b> and further improve design efficiency. Multiple elements and complicated relationships between elements in the <b>design</b> <b>processes</b> of complex mechanical products cause difficulties in systematically and quantitatively expressing the <b>design</b> <b>processes.</b> Therefore, we put forth a supernetwork-based model for designing complex mechanical products. First, we identified the key elements in the <b>design</b> <b>processes</b> of complex mechanical products. Next, based on this we analyzed sub-elements of the key elements and relationships between sub-elements. Then we built sub-networks with sub-elements as nodes and their relationships as edges and the supernetwork model for <b>design</b> <b>processes</b> of complex mechanical products based on the sub-networks and their relationships. Meanwhile, we also present a method for combining linguistic variables with the corresponding triangular fuzzy numbers, and a max/min synthesis method to accurately compute the edge weights. Finally, we suggest the practical applications of the proposed model and give {{a comparison of the}} proposed model and existing ones to verify the feasibility and validity of this study...|$|R

As the first of a new type, the <b>design</b> <b>process</b> for Von der Tann was highly controversial. Großadmiral Alfred von Tirpitz, the State Secretary for the Imperial German Navy, wanted the ship to follow the British pattern of large guns, relatively light armor, and high speed. Kaiser Wilhelm II, along with other senior navy officers instead argued that, owing to Germany's numerical inferiority, the new ships should have armor strong enough to permit their use in the battle line.|$|E

40|$|The {{attempt to}} improve {{mechatronic}} <b>design</b> <b>processes</b> is hindered by their complexity. The process complexity is {{mainly caused by}} an extensive process modularity and by the interdependencies of heterogeneous distributed processes which in turn are due to the interrelation of multidisciplinary domains. A new approach is proposed for planning and improving mechatronic <b>design</b> <b>processes</b> by modelling and simulating distributed development processes using object-oriented Petri Nets. For this purpose, this approach not only implements stochastic characteristics of development <b>processes.</b> It integrates <b>design</b> <b>processes</b> from different domains.

A failure {{to consider all}} elements of pattern design tends to result in poor results. The US Army's Universal Camouflage Pattern (UCP), for example, adopted after limited testing in 2003–4, performed poorly because of low pattern contrast ("isoluminance"—beyond very close range, the design looks like a field of solid light grey, failing to disrupt an object's outlines) and arbitrary colour selection, neither {{of which could be}} saved by quantizing (digitizing) the pattern geometry. The design was replaced from 2015 with Operational Camouflage Pattern, a non-pixellated pattern.|$|E
