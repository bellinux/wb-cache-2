Significant examples of such statements can, for example, be given by applying the Chevalley–Warning theorem, over the prime fields.

25|$|This step is the enzymatic {{transfer}} of a phosphate group from 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate to ADP by phosphoglycerate kinase, forming ATP and 3-phosphoglycerate. At this step, glycolysis {{has reached the}} break-even point: 2 molecules of ATP were consumed, and 2 new molecules have now been synthesized. This step, {{one of the two}} substrate-level phosphorylation steps, requires ADP; thus, when the cell <b>has</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> ATP (and little ADP), this reaction does not occur. Because ATP decays relatively quickly when it is not metabolized, this is an important regulatory point in the glycolytic pathway.|$|E

25|$|A long hop {{is a type}} of {{inadvertent}} {{delivery in}} the sport of cricket. It describes a short delivery which is not especially fast, which is thus easy for the batsman to hit because he <b>has</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> time to observe the speed and direction of the ball after the bounce and choose his shot accordingly. In contrast, a fast short delivery which bounces high (to the batsman's chest or higher) is termed a bouncer and is often bowled deliberately because it is difficult to hit safely, due to the height at which it reaches the batsman.|$|E

Whatsapp is also used to send a series of bulk messages to their targeted customers using broadcast option. Companies started using this to a large extent because it is a cost effective promotional option and quick to spread a message. Still, Whatsapp doesn't allow businesses to place ads in their app.|$|E

[...] Writer John Sickels said Kipnis is [...] "quite strong and <b>has</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> bat speed. His feel for the strike zone is impressive, {{and he has no}} problem generating power.

IGN.com ranked The Ramones's {{performance}} as the fifteenth best guest appearance in the show's history. In 2007, Vanity Fair named it the best episode of the show, calling it, [...] "A perfect episode. Mr. Burns's lamentations for his childhood bear, Bobo, lead to a show-long parody of Citizen Kane.

The region <b>has</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> {{groundwater}} and, because of common spring floods, {{does not have}} many burrowing animals. Before modern agriculture, the tall grass prairies had large numbers of big bluestem, little bluestem, Indian grass, switchgrass, sand dropseed, and other tall grasses. Flood plains along the Missouri and Big Sioux Rivers are habitat for wild rye, bluejoint, and panicgrass. The tall grass prairies have wild rose and buck bush shrubs, and goldenrod, sunflower, cinquefoil, and milkweed herbs. Marsh hawks, bobolink, short-eared owl, and short-billed marsh wren birds make their home in this prairie, and jackrabbits, cottontail rabbits, meadow mice, and deer are common animal life.|$|E
500|$|Den of Geek {{selected}} the episode's special effects {{as a positive}} element, but was more critical of the episode as a whole. [...] "As Fringe goes," [...] the website explained, [...] "this ended up a rather lightweight narrative, which was more about getting Lincoln established with Fringe, and providing a few new plotlines that the subsequent stories can expand on." [...] IGN's Ramsey Isler was equally ambivalent, and gave the episode a score of 7.5 out of 10. He observed, [...] "It isn't a bad episode. It's a good addition to the Fringe lore. It's well-written, <b>has</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> action, and the actors are great as usual. But it just doesn't feel like a fulfilling continuation of last season's cliffhanger, nor does it strike me as a fantastic new direction for the season." ...|$|E

Levine did criticise {{the lack of}} theming and landscaping around the ride noting the immediate area surrounding the ride [...] "includes a bone yard of coaster seats and parts". Robert Niles of the Los Angeles Times shared a similar sentiment, stating [...] "Scream creates an effective illusion that you are alone, flying above the track" [...] but questions the ride's location on a former parking lot. He highlights [...] "a good story can elicit extreme thoughts and emotions. [...] Why ignore those opportunities when building a thrill ride?". Niles concluded by stating [...] "I feel a little neglected as I shuffle off the otherwise exciting ride", referring {{to the lack of}} theming or storyline.
