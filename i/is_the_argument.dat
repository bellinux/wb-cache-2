5|$|Another {{possible}} {{argument that}} has been proposed by C. S. Lewis <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>Argument</b> from Reason: if, as monism implies, all of our thoughts are the effects of physical causes, then {{we have no reason}} for assuming that they are also the consequent of a reasonable ground. Knowledge, however, is apprehended by reasoning from ground to consequent. Therefore, if monism is correct, there would be no way of knowing this—or anything else—we could not even suppose it, except by a fluke.|$|E
5|$|Related to the {{argument}} from morality <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> from conscience, associated with eighteenth-century bishop Joseph Butler and nineteenth-century cardinal John Henry Newman. Newman proposed that the conscience, as well as giving moral guidance, provides evidence of objective moral truths which must be supported by the divine. He argued that emotivism is an inadequate explanation of the human experience of morality because people avoid acting immorally, even when it might be in their interests. Newman proposed that, to explain the conscience, God must exist.|$|E
5|$|The Shakespeare authorship {{question}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> {{that someone}} other than William Shakespeare of Stratford-upon-Avon wrote the works attributed to him. Anti-Stratfordians—a collective term for adherents of the various alternative-authorship theories—believe that Shakespeare of Stratford was a front to shield {{the identity of the}} real author or authors, who for some reason did not want or could not accept public credit. Although the idea has attracted much public interest, all but a few Shakespeare scholars and literary historians consider it a fringe belief and, for the most part, acknowledge it only to rebut or disparage the claims.|$|E

5|$|Further {{indicative}} of the role cognitive flexibility plays in education <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> that how students are taught greatly impacts the nature and formation of their cognitive structures, which in turn affect students’ ability to store and readily access information. A crucial aim of education is to help students learn as well as appropriately apply and adapt {{what they have learned}} to novel situations. This is reflected in the integration of cognitive flexibility into educational policy regarding academic guidelines and expectations. For example, as outlined in the , a standards-based education reform developed to increase high school graduation rates, educators are expected to present within the classroom “high level cognitive demands by asking students to demonstrate deep conceptual understanding through the application of content knowledge and skills to new situations.” This guideline within the Common Core Initiative is the essence of cognitive flexibility, and a teaching style focused on promoting it has been seen to foster understanding especially in disciplines where information is complex and nonlinear. A counterexample is evident in cases where such material is presented in an oversimplified manner and learners fail to transfer their knowledge to a new domain.|$|E
25|$|The Pearl Harbor advance-knowledge {{conspiracy}} theory <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> that U.S. Government officials had advance knowledge of Japan's December 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor. Ever since the Japanese attack {{there has been}} debate as to {{how and why the}} United States had been caught off guard, and how much and when American officials knew of Japanese plans for an attack. In September 1944, John T. Flynn, a co-founder of the non-interventionist America First Committee, launched Pearl Harbor revisionism when he published a forty-six page booklet entitled The Truth about Pearl Harbor.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} perspective {{focuses on}} the role of the welfare state as an institution that improves quality of life not only by increasing the extent to which basic human needs are met, but also by promoting greater control of one's life by limiting the degree to which individuals find themselves at the mercy of impersonal market forces that are indifferent to the fate of individuals. This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> suggested by the U.S. political scientist Benjamin Radcliff, who has presented a series of papers in peer reviewed scholarly journals demonstrating that a more generous welfare state contributes to higher levels of life satisfaction, and does so to rich and poor alike.|$|E

25|$|A {{hyperbolic}} {{angle is}} an argument of a hyperbolic function just as the circular angle <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> of a circular function. The comparison can be visualized as {{the size of the}} openings of a hyperbolic sector and a circular sector since the areas of these sectors correspond to the angle magnitudes in each case. Unlike the circular angle, the hyperbolic angle is unbounded. When the circular and hyperbolic functions are viewed as infinite series in their angle argument, the circular ones are just alternating series forms of the hyperbolic functions. This weaving of the two types of angle and function was explained by Leonhard Euler in Introduction to the Analysis of the Infinite.|$|E
25|$|The second {{aspect of}} the Fermi paradox <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> of probability: given {{intelligent}} life's ability to overcome scarcity, and its tendency to colonize new habitats, it seems possible {{that at least some}} civilizations would be technologically advanced, seek out new resources in space, and colonize their own star system and, subsequently, surrounding star systems. Since there is no significant evidence on Earth, or elsewhere in the known universe of other intelligent life after 13.8billion years of the universe's history, there is a conflict requiring a resolution. Some examples of possible resolutions are that intelligent life is rarer than we think, that our assumptions about the general development or behavior of intelligent species are flawed, or, more radically, that our current scientific {{understanding of the nature of}} the universe itself is quite incomplete.|$|E
25|$|More {{controversial}} {{than the}} role of technology <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> over {{the role of}} politics in the origins of the region's decline. Confederation and the tariff and railway freight policies that followed have often been blamed for having a deleterious effect on the Maritime economies. Arguments have been made that the Maritimes' poverty was caused by control over policy by Central Canada which used the national structures for its own enrichment. This was the central view of the Maritime Rights Movement of the 1920s, which advocated greater local control over the region's finances. T.W. Acheson {{is one of the main}} proponents of this theory. He notes the growth that was occurring during the early years of the National Policy in Nova Scotia demonstrates how the effects of railway fares and the tariff structure helped undermine this growth. Capitalists from Central Canada purchased the factories and industries of the Maritimes from their bankrupt local owners and proceeded to close down many of them, consolidating the industry in Central Canada.|$|E
