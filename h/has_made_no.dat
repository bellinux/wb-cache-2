Following his retirement, Gugelmin put his Florida mansion in Coral Gables up for sale for $17 million, and moved back to live in Brazil full-time. He runs the family business along with his brother, Alceu, and has also done consultancy work for Mercedes-Benz subsidiary AMG. Both his surviving sons compete in go-kart events.|$|E
5|$|Don meets Rachel {{for dinner}} {{to make amends}} for the meeting. During the dinner, Don says he is living life to extract {{the maximum amount of}} {{pleasure}} as there is no tomorrow, while Rachel recognizes in Don the element of the disconnected outsider, for whom the world is laid out like a puzzle waiting to be solved. The two of them begin to bond, and she agrees to give Sterling Cooper another shot. Meanwhile, Pete and some of his co-workers go to a gentlemen's club to celebrate Pete's impending wedding. There, a waitress rejects Pete's advances. Dejected from this rejection and Don's recent criticisms, Pete arrives drunk at Peggy's apartment, and she invites him in. Don takes a train to a large house in the suburbs, where he is greeted by his loving wife Betty (January Jones), whom he <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>no</b> mention of thus far in the episode. He checks on their two sleeping children as she watches admiringly from the doorway.|$|E

Fox <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>no</b> announcement {{on whether or not}} they plan to move the MyNetworkTV affiliation to KICU, which would make KRON an independent once again.

25|$|Argentina {{made its}} ICC tournament debut at the 1979 ICC Trophy in England, {{which was the}} first event staged only for {{associate}} members. The team failed to appear at the subsequent 1982 edition, but from 1986 to 2001 appeared in five consecutive tournaments. However, Argentina only won its first match at the 1994 tournament, when it defeated East and Central Africa. The team won four matches in division two at the 2001 edition, but <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>no</b> further appearances in what has now been renamed the World Cup Qualifier. In the early 2000s, Argentina was one of the leading associates in the ICC Americas region, and in 2007, when the World Cricket League (WCL) was established, the side was placed into Division Three. Promoted into Division Two later in the year, it was immediately relegated, and continued to drop divisions over the following years. Finally, after placing fourth at the 2013 Division Six event, Argentina lost its place in the global tournament system. The team is yet to re-qualify, instead competing only in regional tournaments.|$|E

25|$|However {{in spite}} of public outrage the Spanish {{government}} <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>no</b> attempt to reform policing and police mistreatment of the public. On the contrary, in July 2016 new reforms to the law on Public Security and the Criminal Code came into force which limit the right to freedom of assembly and give police officers the broad discretion to fine people who show a 'lack of respect' towards them. The Law on Public Security also includes an offence of spreading images of police officers in certain cases. The UN Human Rights Commission has expressed concern at the impact this legislation could have on human rights and police accountability. Fines for insulting a police officer can be up to €600 euros, {{and as much as}} €30,000 for spreading damaging photos of police officers. Amnesty International identifies three main areas of concern about police action during demonstrations and assemblies: excessive use of force and inappropriate use of riot equipment, excessive use of force when arresting demonstrators, and ill-treatment of detainees in police custody.|$|E
500|$|In {{the trickster}} subplot, young Tom tricks his elder brother Lord Foppington {{out of his}} {{intended}} bride and her large dowry. This plot takes up nearly half the play and expands the part of Sir Novelty to give more scope for the roaring success of Cibber's fop acting. Recycling Cibber's merely fashion-conscious fop, Vanbrugh lets him buy himself a title and equips him with enough aplomb and selfishness to weather all humiliations. Although Lord Foppington may be [...] "very industrious to pass for an ass", as Amanda remarks, he is at bottom [...] "a man who Nature <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>no</b> fool" [...] (II.i.148). Literary historians agree in esteeming him [...] "the greatest of all Restoration fops" [...] (Dobrée), [...] "brutal, evil, and smart" [...] (Hume).|$|E
500|$|When the Tea Room {{was closed}} by the National Park Service on January 1, 1999, {{officials}} said they did so {{because of the potential}} fire hazard posed by operating a kitchen in the main park building and the possibility of insect or rodent damage to historic items in the mansion, as stated in the General Management Plan adopted by the NPS the previous year. While it [...] "may be a pleasant place to enjoy a meal... that is clearly less important than the need to preserve Hampton's buildings, objects and landscapes for future generations," [...] the Park Service stated. Officials of Preservation Maryland said they were [...] "disappointed" [...] by the restaurant's closure, saying it helped attract visitors to the historic site. The former chairwoman of the Hampton women's committee—which raises money for various projects at Hampton—also criticized the decision. Since 2006, the women's group has renewed efforts to have the Tea Room reopened, saying it would draw more visitors and repeat business from locals to the park. A Park Service spokesman was quoted as saying in October, 2006, that [...] "The mansion {{is not going to be}} the site of any food operation," [...] but <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>no</b> further comment since then.|$|E

After taking time off in 2000 due to ill-health, Reid {{announced that he was}} quitting the soap in May 2000. After Reid publicly declared that he would love Frank to have a last fling with Pat before he left, EastEnders bosses granted his wish and an affair was scripted. The pair enjoyed a liaison on a Spanish beach during a week-long August special set on the Costa Blanca, which saw Frank and Peggy go away with Pat and Roy and Terry and Irene Raymond (Gavin Richards and Roberta Taylor). A BBC spokesperson said: [...] "Pat is obviously incredibly torn between her love for her husband, Roy, and her old feelings for Frank. She's been hurt by Frank in the past, but she's coming to realise that she still has strong feelings for him and he <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>no</b> secret of his soft spot for her. I can confirm they do enjoy a romantic kiss on the beach." [...] On-screen, Pat and Frank's affair continued until they decided, in November 2000, to elope. In the specially extended episode marking Frank's official exit — which aired on 2 November 2000, but was Guy Fawkes Night in the on-screen events – Peggy discovered the affair amidst Frank's attempt to retrieve a letter of confession, following Pat's change of heart.|$|E
