25|$|The {{penitent}} is {{the subject}} rather than the object of this discourse. Contrition {{is not something that}} happens to the penitent but is rather an affect he or she creates, as the focus on humility and on the weeping voice suggests. Affectivity is the translation of idea into expressive gesture, and this moment <b>is</b> <b>surely</b> an affective one. If the genuineness of a late-medieval spiritual experience is confirmed by its external signs—by its affectivity, in other words—we should extend the same criterion to the early evidence, where we find that it works just as well.|$|E

25|$|In 1913, two of Berg's Five Songs on Picture Postcard Texts by Peter Altenberg (1912) were premièred in Vienna, {{conducted}} by Schoenberg in the infamous Skandalkonzert. Settings of aphoristic poetic utterances, {{the songs are}} accompanied by a very large orchestra. The performance caused a riot, {{and had to be}} halted. This was a crippling blow to Berg's self-confidence: he effectively withdrew the work, which <b>is</b> <b>surely</b> one of his most innovative and assured first orchestral compositions in the literature, and it was not performed in full until 1952. The full score remained unpublished until 1966.|$|E
25|$|Several factors {{contribute}} to the development of relatively large sea caves. The nature of the zone of weakness itself <b>is</b> <b>surely</b> a factor, although difficult to quantify. A more readily observed factor is the situation of the cave’s entrance relative to prevailing sea conditions. At Santa Cruz Island, the largest caves face into the prevailing northwest swell conditions—a factor which also makes them more difficult to survey. Caves in well-protected bays sheltered from prevailing seas and winds tend to be smaller, as are caves in areas where the seas tend to be calmer.|$|E
25|$|As regards literature, {{the leading}} figures were Irayimman Thampi and Vidwan Koithampuran, both poets {{of the royal}} court. Their works abound in a {{beautiful}} and happy blending of music and poetry. The former <b>is</b> <b>surely</b> the most musical poet of Kerala and his beautiful lullaby commencing with the line Omana Thinkalkidavo has earned him an everlasting name. But the prime reason why he is held in such high esteem in Malayalam is the contribution he has made to Kathakali literature by his three works, namely the Dakshayagam, the Kichakavadham and the Uttara-svayamvaram. The latter's Kathakali work Ravana Vijayam has made him immortal in literature.|$|E

25|$|As {{regards the}} Old Testament, the antiquity of the version is {{admitted}} on all hands. The tradition, however, {{that part of}} it was translated from Hebrew into Syriac for the benefit of Hiram in the days of Solomon <b>is</b> <b>surely</b> a myth. That a translation was made by a priest named Assa, or Ezra, whom the king of Assyria sent to Samaria, to instruct the Assyrian colonists mentioned in 2 Kings 17, is equally legendary. That the translation of the Old Testament and New Testament was made in connection with the visit of Thaddaeus to Abgar at Edessa belongs also to unreliable tradition. Mark has even been credited in ancient Syriac tradition with translating his own gospel (written in Latin, according to this account) and the other books of the New Testament into Syriac.|$|E
25|$|Alice, Dowager Countess of Derby {{was also}} Dowager Viscountess Brackley. Her second husband Thomas Egerton, Lord Ellesmere, an eminent lawyer and Lord Chancellor of England, {{had died in}} 1617. But the Derby title was the one she {{preferred}} to be known by, {{and it is the}} one by which she is described on her funeral monument, which <b>is</b> <b>surely</b> one of the finest of its time anywhere in England. The mourning daughters beside the tomb are not meant to be lifelike representations of her actual daughters, Anne, Frances and Elizabeth; they conform to a stereotype often observed on grand monuments of this kind. But the figure of Alice Countess of Derby is probably closer to historical reality. She wears the coronet of a Countess, not a Viscountess, and at the foot of her tomb is a coroneted eagle, a reminder of the Stanleys' armorial crest. This commemorates their descent from the Lathoms, which was the foundation of their fortunes.|$|E
25|$|It {{must surely}} have a deplorable effect upon our Allies {{to be told}} by an ex-Cabinet Minister that the Palestine Administration do not like Jews, {{and that there are}} enough anti-Semites in Great Britain to back up the Hitler policy and spirit. This {{suggestion}} is a complete reversal of the truth. If a comparison is to be made with the Nazis, it <b>is</b> <b>surely</b> those who wish to force an imported régime upon the Arab population who are guilty of the spirit of aggression and domination. Lord Wedgwood's proposal that Arabs should be subjugated by force to a Jewish régime is inconsistent with the Atlantic Charter, and that ought to be told to America. The second principle of that Charter lays down that the United States and ourselves desire to see no territorial changes that do not accord with the freely expressed wishes of the peoples concerned; and the third principle lays down that they respect the right of all peoples to choose the form of Government under which they will live.|$|E

500|$|Nielsen's final {{large-scale}} orchestral {{works were}} his Flute Concerto (1926) and the Clarinet Concerto (1928), of which Robert Layton writes: [...] "If {{ever there was}} music from another planet, this <b>is</b> <b>surely</b> it. Its sonorities are sparse and monochrome, its air rarefied and bracing." [...] Nielsen's last musical composition, the organ work Commotio, was premiered posthumously in 1931.|$|E
500|$|HOURDOSE {{reviewed}} it {{by stating}} [...] "‘Bommarillu’ {{is a pure}} example of a director’s faith in his script and his screenplay.

500|$|I am ... out {{of sympathy}} with the cry that {{education}} is unnecessary for girls, and that all they require is a few accomplishments.

It is a valiant attempt to bring such genre to the modern day audience and present it with finesse so that it fits the historical angle and the today's angle." [...] However, Rajamouli was accused of lifting scenes from films like Gladiator (2000), Troy (2004), The Myth (2005) and 300 (2007).|$|E

The Queen stated that [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>surely</b> appropriate that this should be positioned in The Mall - an area of London so often associated with our national way of life. When people pass by the memorial, I hope they will pause and reflect on the proud traditions that it represents.

500|$|In 1963, Moser {{published}} a second {{work in the}} Kleine Kryptogamenﬂora von Mitteleuropa series, Ascomyceten (Schlauchpilze). This work was a monograph on the Ascomycetes, focussing on the Discomycetes. Though not as well known as his earlier book, it was well received in the mycological community. The mycologist Richard Korf, reviewing the work {{in an article published}} in Mycologia, said that [...] "the book belongs on the shelf of every mycological library in Europe", praising the [...] "xcellent, workable keys to the orders, families, genera, and European species". Korf wrote that, [...] "f a single fault can be found, it <b>is</b> <b>surely</b> the lack of documentation provided". However, a combination of a lack of time and Moser's comparative lack of expertise in Ascomycetes prevented subsequent editions of the work.|$|E
500|$|The episode's format was {{compared}} to a rival television series, Medical Investigation. USA Today favorably stated House as more character-driven than Investigations [...] "plot-driven procedural", and the San Francisco Chronicle felt that House was the better show due to the title character. Varietys Brian Lowry, meanwhile, stated that the two shows were too similar and House was mismatched among Fox's other programs. Other complaints included perceived stereotypes of young, attractive doctors. [...] Sherwin Nuland of Slate gave the first episodes of the series a highly negative review, stating that [...] "Of all the medical errata in this series (and there are some whoppers), the greatest <b>is</b> <b>surely</b> the conceit that a physician so remote, so neglectful of duty, so sadistic, so downright cruel as Gregory House would be tolerated in any ...|$|E
500|$|Justice John Paul Stevens {{also argued}} that [...] "a person's {{interest}} in retaining his American citizenship <b>is</b> <b>surely</b> an aspect of 'liberty' of which he cannot be deprived without due process of law" [...] and that [...] "due process requires that a clear and convincing standard of proof be met" [...] in Terrazas's case or others like it. [...] Additionally, Stevens felt that Congress had not adequately addressed the question of specific intent to relinquish citizenship. [...] "Since we accept dual citizenship," [...] he wrote, [...] "taking an oath of allegiance to a foreign government is not necessarily inconsistent with an intent to remain an American citizen. [...] Moreover, as now written, the statute cannot fairly be read to require a finding of specific intent to relinquish citizenship." ...|$|E
