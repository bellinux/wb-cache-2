25|$|Holoxica has successfuly {{demonstrated}} {{several generations}} of holographic video displays. The technical approach advocates a simplified approach by starting with basic building blocks and scaling towards higher resolution and performance. The first-generation <b>holographic</b> <b>display</b> demonstrator, built in 2010, had up to nine voxels and could show simple numeric information, icons, symbology etc. This technology {{can be used to}} build segmented 3D displays, similar to the early segmented LCDs found in calculators and clocks. The second-generation display was announced in 2013. This is a planar Head-Up Display (HUD) with hundreds of thousands voxels and freeform images floating in mid-air that can change in real time. Interactivity is added with a Kinect motion sensor that allows you to 'touch' icons in free space and 'draw' in mid-air. The third generation display builds upon the previous generations to create a volumetric display. The images are bright and visible under indoor lighting conditions, and the approach is scalable, leveraging existing manufacturing techniques and components.|$|E
