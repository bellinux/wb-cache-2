I was in the water about five hours, as the shore was so rocky and the surf ran so high that a great many were lost trying to land. Nearly all those that took to the water without their clothes on were taken by sharks; hundreds of them were all round us, and I saw men taken by them close to me, but as I was dressed (having on a flannel shirt and trousers) they preferred the others. I was not in the least hurt, and am <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> kept my head clear; most of the officers lost their lives from losing their presence of mind and trying to take money with them, and from not throwing off their coats. - Letter from Lieutenant J.F.

500|$|One of Sunny's most {{high-profile}} storylines was a kiss between {{herself and}} female character, Donna Freedman (Margot Robbie). The kiss occurs after Donna discovers that Sunny has been writing the romantic love letters given to her by her boyfriend. Sunny is then shocked when Donna leans over and kisses her on the lips and steals her first kiss. Lee said [...] "For days, all Sunny's been able to think about is {{what it would be}} like to kiss Zeke. Now Donna's gone and stolen the moment – and Sunny's not <b>happy,</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> the least..." ...|$|E

500|$|A series-ending wrap {{party was}} held for {{the cast and crew}} at the Roosevelt Hotel in April. Cast members spoke about their {{feelings}} {{about the end of the}} series. John Billingsley said the show [...] "was a great ride, and it changed my life. It's something that will last forever for me." [...] He was <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> goodbye to the two-hour makeup sessions to create his character, Phlox. Many of the cast were taking a break and going on vacation before seeking new acting jobs. Among the notable guests were Star Trek Nemesis screenwriter John Logan, who was not affiliated with Enterprise, and Peter Weller, who appeared as a villain in [...] "Terra Prime".|$|E
500|$|Only a few {{of those}} in the water survived. Among them were Archibald Gracie, Jack Thayer and Charles Lightoller, who made it to the capsized {{collapsible}} boat B. Around 12 crew members climbed on board Collapsible B, and they rescued those they could until some 35 men were clinging precariously to the upturned hull. Realising the risk to the boat of being swamped by the mass of swimmers around them, they paddled slowly away, ignoring the pleas of dozens of swimmers to be allowed on board. In his account, Gracie wrote of the admiration he had for those in the water; [...] "In no instance, I am <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> did I hear any word of rebuke from a swimmer because of a refusal to grant assistance... was met with the manly voice of a powerful man... 'All right boys, good luck and God bless you'." [...] Several other swimmers (probably 20 or more) reached Collapsible boat A, which was upright but partly flooded, as its sides had not been properly raised. Its occupants had to sit for hours in a foot of freezing water, and many died of hypothermia during the night.|$|E
500|$|Casey Luskin of the Discovery Institute, which {{promotes}} intelligent design, contested this, saying, [...] "the problem for their logic is that ID {{is not an}} arbitrary explanation, because we have much experience with intelligent agents producing the type of informational complexity we see in nature." [...] Columnist Jeff Jacoby wrote in The Boston Globe that intelligent design [...] "isn't primitivism or Bible-thumping or flying spaghetti. It's science." [...] This view of science, however, {{was rejected by the}} United States National Academy of Sciences. Peter Gallings of Answers in Genesis, a Young Earth Creationist ministry said [...] "Ironically enough, , in addition to mocking God himself, are lampooning the Intelligent Design Movement for not identifying a specific deity—that is, leaving open the possibility that a spaghetti monster could be the intelligent designer... Thus, the satire is possible because the Intelligent Design Movement hasn’t affiliated with a particular religion, exactly the opposite of what its other critics claim!" [...] Mark Coppenger, a pastor who teaches at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, commented, [...] "I'm <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> I think FSM hurts the evolutionists' program since, by mocking the Christian tradition... it reinforces the correct impression that there is genuine contempt for biblical faith in that camp... Besides, the parody is lame, and there are few things more encouraging than cheap shots from one's opponents." ...|$|E

This {{background}} of anti-Semitic pogroms, shared by other comedy writers of his generation, he noted in 1992, [...] "I'm not <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> have <b>to</b> <b>say</b> ... created the condition where humor becomes anger made acceptable with a joke".|$|R
5000|$|Richie and {{his wife}} Brenda Harvey legally adopted Nicole when she was nine. Shortly after, Lionel's affair with another woman became public knowledge. Lionel and Brenda went through a bitter public split; as a result, they indulged Nicole's every whim.

Following the divorce, Lionel remarried and had two more children: Myles (b. 1994) and Sofia (b. 1998).|$|R

Mondale called her [...] "a remarkable woman and a dear human being... She was a pioneer in our country for justice for women and a more open society. She broke a lot of molds and it's a better country for what she did." [...] George H. W. Bush said, [...] "Though we were one-time political opponents, I am <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> Gerry and I became friends in time – a friendship marked by respect and affection. I admired Gerry in many ways, {{not the least of which}} was the dignified and principled manner she blazed new trails for women in politics." [...] Palin paid tribute to her on Facebook, expressing gratitude for having been able to work with her the year before and saying, [...] "She broke one huge barrier and then went on to break many more. May her example of hard work and dedication to America continue to inspire all women." [...] Bill and Hillary Clinton said in a statement that, [...] "Gerry Ferraro was one of a kind – tough, brilliant, and never afraid to speak her mind or stand up for what she believed in – a New York icon and a true American original." ...|$|E
500|$|Allgame {{said the}} {{enjoyment}} [...] "isn't bad", but limited: [...] "You can only blow {{up so much}} stuff with a helicopter." [...] Glenn Rubenstein of GameSpot in his PlayStation review called the game tired and mediocre, but reviewing the PC version, Shane Mooney wrote: [...] "I'm <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that the much-maligned action-heavy, plot-light genre has received a solid kick in the pants from the wonderfully fun Nuclear Strike." [...] Mooney praised the successful port from the console version and believed players would [...] "find plenty to slobber over in this extremely entertaining title." [...] Daily Radar said: [...] "When it comes to creating an action game, {{it would be nice}} to play something that requires a little bit more than just holding down the fire button continuously. In Nuclear Strike 64, that's just about all you do." [...] The website said: [...] "if all you're looking for is a game where you can fly around in a helicopter, drive a tank and manipulate 10 other vehicles in a destructive fest, well, here you go." [...] Allgame summarised: [...] "When all is said and done, Nuclear Strike 64 is a fine example of an excellent shooting game." [...] The reviewer believed that gamers would appreciate the game's longevity and variety. Game Revolution praised the helpful interface and responsive controls and said the mechanics were generally good, but complained of an occasionally inaccurate targeting system. The website acclaimed the [...] "perfect" [...] difficulty level. GameFan took issue with enemies shooting the player's vehicle while not visible on-screen. GameSpot's minor complaints were infrequent game saves, a [...] "too easy" [...] structure allowing supply lines to be destroyed before the main forces, a short game despite large missions and a lack of multiplayer.|$|E

I am <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> that no violence or breach of the public peace was attempted, so far from this, that all except a very few, attended to their own avocations and left the gentleman to hold forth his own arguments to nearly naked walls.

2500|$|AFA created One Million Moms and One Million Dads, two {{websites}} {{with the}} stated goal of mobilizing parents to [...] "stop {{the exploitation of}} children" [...] by the media. It uses these websites to organize boycotts and urge activists to send emails to mainstream companies employing advertising, selling products, or advertising on television shows they find offensive. In 2012, the group started and then backed off from a failed campaign against the hiring of talk show host Ellen DeGeneres as a spokesperson for department store chain JC Penney. They opposed her employment {{on the grounds that}} DeGeneres is [...] "an open homosexual". [...] At a taping of her show, DeGeneres informed her audience of the fizzled effort: [...] "They wanted to get me fired and I am proud and <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> JC Penney stuck by their decision to make me their spokesperson." ...|$|E

His {{appearance}} was such an uncommon one; it seemed most unlikely that no one in Liverpool should have noticed him after he left that cab. The wonderful fur coat, the long beard, all must have been noticeable, even though it was past four o'clock on a somewhat foggy December afternoon.|$|R
60|$|On {{the evening}} of a cold December day--the {{last day of the}} year--many months after the {{occurrence}} of the events narrated in the last chapter, old Mrs Osten sat in her drawing-room, toasting her toes before a cheerful fire. The widow looked very <b>happy,</b> and, <b>to</b> <b>say</b> truth, she had good reason for being so, for her stalwart son had come home to her safe and sound, and was at that moment sitting by her side talking in a most amazing way about his Flora--referring to her as a sort of captive bird which had now no chance of escaping, saying that he meant to take her to Paris, and Switzerland, and Rome, and in summer to the English Lakes, and Killarney, and the Scotch Highlands.|$|R
60|$|And was John equally <b>happy?</b> Well, <b>to</b> <b>say</b> the truth, John's {{head was}} a little turned by the {{possession}} of this curious and manifold creature, that fluttered and flapped her wings about the eyes and ears of his understanding, and appeared before him every day in some new device of the toilet, fair and fresh; smiling and bewitching, kissing and coaxing, laughing and crying, and in all ways bewildering him, the once sober-minded John, till he scarce knew whether he stood on his head or his heels. He knew {{that this sort of}} rattling, scatter-brained life must come to an end some time. He knew there was a sober, serious life-work for him; something that must try his mind and soul and strength, and that would, by and by, leave him neither time nor strength to be the mere wandering attaché of a gay bird, whose string he held in hand, and who now seemed to pull him hither and thither at her will.|$|R
2500|$|Two months later, Thursday {{announced}} they would reunite for Atlanta, Georgia's Wrecking Ball music festival in August 2016. In {{a statement about}} the reunion show, Rickly said: [...] "Five years ago, we {{found it necessary to}} end Thursday for reasons beyond our control. Earlier this year, we were able to reconcile all of our differences and spend time together. This is a vital component to what we loved about being in Thursday and we're <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that we'll be playing this show as the same line-up that began touring together on Full Collapse and jointly worked on every record since." [...] Thursday agreed to perform at Wrecking Ball only two days before publicly announcing their participation, and the decision was made after its organizers allowed the band to perform [...] "in our own way, including involving a charity" [...] and after hearing about the strong lineup of bands on the festival. The band had no intention to reunite before this decision. Two months later, it was announced that the band would be playing both Denver and Chicago dates of Riot Fest in September, causing speculation that the band may play more shows later on in the year.|$|E
2500|$|On February 22, 2010, it was {{announced}} that Lopez had parted ways with Epic Records, leaving the fate of the album in jeopardy. The initial press release from Lopez's manager Benny Medina said: [...] "Jennifer had a wonderful relationship with the Sony Music Group, and they have shared many successes together, but the time was right to make a change that best serves the direction of her career as an actress and recording artist, she is grateful and appreciative to everyone at Sony for all that they accomplished together". That same day, Lopez's representative confirmed the news to Entertainment Weekly and revealed that Lopez was negotiating a deal with several other labels. Lopez herself confirmed the split and announced that she had found a new label and that the album would be released in the summer of 2010, [...] "I have fulfilled my contractual responsibilities with Sony/Epic up to this point, and we have both reached friendly terms about my departure from the label. I'm also <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that we've found a new home for my album, 'Love,' and that it is slated for release in the summer of 2010." [...] Billboard magazine would later go on to confirm that Lopez had signed to Def Jam Records and that the album was now due in Summer 2011. According to Rap-Up magazine, the album was to be released on March 29, 2011. Just several weeks after the first announcement, Rap-Up announced that the album had been pushed back to April 19, 2011. No reason was given for the new date. This conflicted with comments made by Lopez during an online chat with her fans. On March 13, 2011, Lopez said that the album was most likely to come {{out at the end of}} May 2011 after at least one more single had been released. A final release date of May 3, 2011 in the United States was later confirmed.|$|E

6000|$|One may be {{extremely}} refined and {{still capable of}} a very sore heart. Certainly Miss Winchelsea's heart was very sore. She had moods of sexual hostility, in which she generalised uncharitably about mankind. [...] "He forgot himself with me," [...] she said. [...] "But Fanny is pink and pretty and soft and a fool--a very excellent match for a Man." [...] And {{by way of a}} wedding present she sent Fanny a gracefully bound volume of poetry by George Meredith, and Fanny wrote back a grossly <b>happy</b> letter <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that it was [...] "all beautiful." [...] Miss Winchelsea hoped that some day Mr. Senoks might take up that slim book and think for a moment of the donor. Fanny wrote several times before and about her marriage, pursuing that fond legend of their [...] "ancient friendship," [...] and giving her happiness in the fullest detail. And Miss Winchelsea wrote to Helen for the first time after the Roman journey, saying nothing about the marriage, but expressing very cordial feelings.|$|R

The deep remembrance of the sense I had, of being utterly without hope now; of the shame I felt in my position; of the misery it was to my young heart to believe that day by day what I had learned, and thought, and delighted in, and raised my fancy and my emulation up by, would pass away from me, little by little, never to be brought back any more; cannot be written. As often as Mick Walker went away in the course of that forenoon, I mingled my tears with the water in which I was washing the bottles; and sobbed as if there were a flaw in my own breast, and it were in danger of bursting.|$|R
