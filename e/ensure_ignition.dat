40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} the temporal evolution of the combustion flowfield established by the interaction of ram-accelerator-type projectiles with an explosive gas mixture accelerated to hypersonic speeds in an expansion tube. The Navier-Stokes equations for a chemically reacting gas are solved in a fully coupled manner using an implicit, time accurate algorithm. The solution procedure is based on a spatially second order, total variation diminishing (TVD) scheme and a temporally second order, variable-step, backward differentiation formula method. The hydrogen-oxygen chemistry is modeled with a 9 -species, 19 -step mechanism. The accuracy of the solution method is first demonstrated by several benchmark calculations. Numerical simulations of expansion tube flowfields are then presented for two different configurations. In particular, the development of the shock-induced combustion process is followed.

40|$|National audienceThe {{need to be}} able {{to predict}} the {{ignitability}} of gas turbine combustor is limited by a lack of knowledge of the physical processes involved and complexity of the ignition process. The need to <b>ensure</b> <b>ignition</b> in the event of a flame extinction determines, to some extent, the operating envelope of an airplane. Ignition is a highly transient process and success/failure of ignition depends on a large number of parameters. Thus, in the current study, it is attempted to measure various physical parameters simultaneously, with high spatial and temporal resolution before and after the deposition of energy. The present research concerns the study of ignition of a two stage multi-point injection burner using dodecane. The air flow rate is 10 ~g/s and is preheated at 473 K and averaged equivalence ratio is set at 0. 70. The use of a laser induced spark for ignition allows for easier change in the location of the spark. High speed (20 kHz) PIV measurements are performed by capturing the Mie scattering of the fuel droplets inside the combustion chamber before and after spark energy deposition. Laser induced plasma spectroscopy is used to measure concentration in the region of the spark. A Helium-Neon laser is passed through the burner close to the injector, in order to measure the frequency of the precessing vortex core. Images of the laser induced sparks are also acquired using an intensified CCD camera, to look at possible presence of droplets inside as well as the initial spatial extension of the spark. Moreover, the energy of the laser beam entering the burner is also measured. In the present study, only one position of the plasma is analyzed. All the simultaneous measurements provide a quantitative measure of some physical conditions required for successful ignition and criteria are proposed to explain failure versus success of ignition...|$|E

40|$|Ramjet {{propulsion}} {{is often}} proposed for airbreathing applications with speeds higher than Mach 3. However, for speeds higher than Mach 5, {{the performance of}} a ramjet drops significantly and the scramjet is the preferred option. The shock-induced combustion ramjet, or shcramjet, is also an interesting alternative at higher flight speeds. Its configuration differs significantly from the scramjet with a longer intake to provide for fuel injection and evaporation while maintaining a lower air temperature to prevent ignition of the flammable mixture with a slower pressure recovery. A detonation wave completes the pressure recovery and <b>ensures</b> <b>ignition</b> of the air-fuel mixture upon reaching the combustion chamber. This longer intake, necessary for adequate air and fuel mixing, can be combined with a much shorter combustion section. Overall, when the entire vehicle is considered, the shcramjet may result in improved performance for the same mission over the scramjet-powered vehicle. To complete a preliminary design of scramjet and shcramjet vehicles powered at hypersonic speeds, an on-design computational tool was developed to optimize their configurations and compare various performance parameters as a function of Mach number in the range from 7 to 12. In order to compare common baselines for the scramjet and the shcramjet, a configuration was chosen with a mass limited to 430 kg for validation with other design tools. Eventually the configurations were optimized for a balance between the thrust-drag and lift-weight forces by tailoring the external geometry and configuring the internal components to offer the best performance for both vehicles. Since a mixing submodel with not yet available to interact with the other submodels, the various performance parameters were calculated and presented graphically for constant combustion efficiency values. Ultimately both configurations give approximately the same performance when compared with the same combustion efficiency.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the findings of}} an experimental investigation into the operation of a compression ignition (CI) engine in homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) mode using hydrogen fuel. Factors that were investigated include engine efficiency, emissions and mechanical loads. Hydrogen {{was found to be}} a possible fuel for operation of a CI engine in HCCI mode. The heat release rate is extremely high, which leads to high ignition timing control requirements. The ignition timing was controlled using heating of the inlet air, and satisfactory performance was demonstrated using this method. Some cycle-to-cycle variations were, however, observed due to the difficulty in achieving accurate control of ignition timing. Use of hydrogen in HCCI engines allows operation with very lean air-fuel mixtures, giving extremely low emissions of nitrogen oxides and other pollutants. Operation with an excess air ratio of 6 was demonstrated, and a maximum fuel efficiency of 45 % was achieved with an excess air ratio of 3. The maximum power of the engine in HCCI mode is, however, quite modest, being limited by the need for inlet air heating to <b>ensure</b> auto <b>ignition,</b> which reduces the air mass flow through the engine. There are also mechanical limitations to the operation of the HCCI hydrogen engine at high loads due to higher rates of pressure rise and in-cylinder peak pressures compared to conventional diesel mode. ...|$|R

The fundamental aspects of swirled confined two-phase flow ignition are addressed in the present work. Two facilities enable the analysis of two characteristic phases of the process. The KIAI-Spray single-injector burner was investigated in terms of local flow properties, including the air velocity and droplet fuel (n-heptane) size-velocity characterization by phase Doppler anemometry (PDA), {{and the study of}} local equivalence ratio by means of planar laser induced fluorescence (PLIF) on a tracer (toluene). The initial spark location inside the chamber is vital to <b>ensure</b> successful <b>ignition.</b> An ignition probability map was elaborated varying the location of a 532 nm laser-induced spark in the chamber under ultra-lean nominal conditions (phi= 0. 61). The outer recirculation zone (ORZ) was found to be the best region for placing a spark and successfully igniting the mixture. A strong correlation was found between the ignition probability field and the airflow turbulent kinetic energy and velocity fields. Local equivalence ratio enhances the importance of the ORZ. Once a successful ignition is accomplished on one injector, the injector-to-injector flame propagation must be examined. Highspeed visualization through two synchronized perpendicular cameras was applied on the KIAI-Spray linear multi-injector burner. Four different injector-to-injector distances and four fuels of different volatilities (n-heptane, n-decane, n-dodecane and jet-A 1 kerosene) were evaluated.

40|$|Coal is {{presently}} the world's primary fuel for generating electrical power and, being more abundant {{and less expensive}} than oil or natural gas, {{is expected to continue}} its dominance into the future. Coal, however, is more carbon intensive than natural gas and oil and consequently coal-fired power plants are large point source emitters of carbon dioxide (CO{sub 2 }). Since CO{sub 2 } is a greenhouse gas, which may have an adverse impact on the world's climate/weather patterns, studies have been conducted to determine the feasibility and economic impact of capturing power plant CO{sub 2 } emissions for pipeline transport to a sequestration/storage site. The stack gas that exhausts from a modern coal-fired power plant typically contains about 15 % CO{sub 2 } on a dry volume basis. Although there are numerous processes available for removing CO{sub 2 } from gas streams, gas scrubbing with amine solvent is best suited for this application because of the large gas volumes and low CO{sub 2 } concentrations involved. Unfortunately the energy required to regenerate the solvent for continued use as a capturing agent is large and imposes a severe energy penalty on the plant. In addition this ''back end'' or post combustion cleanup requires the addition of large vessels, which, in retrofit applications, are difficult to accommodate. As an alternative to post combustion scrubbing, Foster Wheeler (FW) has proposed that the combustion process be accomplished with oxygen rather than air. With all air nitrogen eliminated, a CO{sub 2 }-water vapor rich flue gas will be generated. After condensation of the water vapor, a portion of the flue gas will be recirculated back to the boiler to control the combustion temperature and the balance of the CO{sub 2 } will be processed for pipeline transport. This proposed oxygen-carbon dioxide (O{sub 2 }/CO{sub 2 }) combustion process eliminates the need for CO{sub 2 } removal/separation and reduces the cost of supplying a CO{sub 2 } rich stream for sequestration. FW has developed a conceptual design of an O{sub 2 } fired boiler to determine overall plant performance and economics. Five subtasks were conducted: (1) a literature review, (2) a system design and analysis, (3) a low NOx burner design and analysis, (4) a furnace and heat recovery area design analysis, and (5) an economic analysis. The objective of the literature search is to locate any data/information relevant to the Oxygen-Based PC Boiler conceptual design. The objective of the system design and analysis task is to optimize the PC boiler plant by maximizing system efficiency within practical considerations. Simulations of the oxygen-fired plant with CO{sub 2 } sequestration were conducted using Aspen Plus and were compared to a reference air-fired 460 MW plant. Flue gas recycle is used in the O{sub 2 }-fired PC to control the flame temperature. Parametric runs were made to determine the effect of flame temperature on system efficiency and required waterwall material and thickness. The degree of improvement on system efficiency of various modifications including hot gas recycle, purge gas recycle, flue gas feedwater recuperation, and recycle purge gas expansion were investigated. The selected O{sub 2 }-fired design case has a system efficiency of 30. 6 % compared to the air-fired system efficiency of 36. 7 %. The design O{sub 2 }-fired case requires T 91 waterwall material and has a waterwall surface area of only 65 % of the air-fired reference case. The objective of the low NOx burner design and analysis task is to optimize the burner design to <b>ensure</b> stable <b>ignition,</b> to provide safe operation, and to minimize pollutant formation. The burners were designed and analyzed using the Fluent CFD computer program. Four burner designs were developed: (1) with no OFG and 65 % flue gas recycle, (2) with 20 % OFG and 65 % flue gas recycle, (3) with no OFG and 56 % flue gas recycle and (4) with 20 % OFG and 56 % flue gas recycle. A 3 -D Fluent simulation was made of a single wall-fired burner and horizontal portion of the furnace from the wall to the center. Without primary gas swirl, coal burnout was relatively small, due to the low oxygen content of the primary gas. Consequently, the burners were modified to include primary gas swirl to bring the coal particles in contact with the secondary gas. An optimal primary gas swirl was chosen to achieve sufficient burnout. The objective of the furnace and heat recovery area design and analysis task is to optimize the location and design of the furnace, burners, over-fire gas ports, and internal radiant surfaces. The furnace is designed with opposed wall-firing burners and over-fire air ports. Water is circulated in the furnace by natural circulation to the waterwalls and divisional wall panels. Compared to the air-fired furnace, the oxygen-fired furnace requires only 65 % of the surface area and 45 % of the volume. Two oxygen-fired designs were simulated: (1) without over-fire air and (2) with 20 % over-fire air...|$|R
40|$|Increasing world {{energy demand}} and recent climate change {{due to global}} warming have led us to search for {{sustainable}} energy sources with the lowest possible greenhouse-gas emissions. Our main energy, which sources from fossil fuel, is not sustainable and its combustion produces high content of harmful emissions. Hydrogen is always thought to be an ideal fuel because it is clean, renewable, and has abundant energy sources. Apparently, before hydrogen can be realized as the main energy source, a few major problems, such as the realtime production, safe and convenient storage, efficient combustion of hydrogen gas, and high production cost, need to be addressed. While waiting for the hydrogen technology to mature, the use {{of other types of}} gaseous fuel to combat the greenhouse-gas emissions deem necessary. Natural gas is not a renewable fuel but it has abundant resources and the lowest average specific CO 2 emission among the non-renewable fossil fuel energy resources. Gas engines are typically utilized for electric power generation but are becoming popular in transportation sector. Recent statistical data obtained from NGV Global shows the worldwide growth of NGVs is increasing exponentially. A CNG engine is usually operated in the lean mode where equivalence ratio is between 0. 7 and 1. 0 by employing premixed-type ignition technique. The CNG lean-burn approach has the advantage of high thermal efficiency, low NOX emission, and lower fuel consumption compared to stoichiometric combustion. However, CNG lean combustion has problems such as poor ignitability and poor flame propagation which cause high cyclic variation, misfires and high THC emission. Using the lean-burn approach, the ignitability of the first flame core relies on local fuel-air mixture concentration near the ignition position. Too rich or too lean local mixture will cause the first flame core to quench before it begins to propagate {{to other parts of the}} combustion chamber. It causes poor combustion quality, misfires and higher cycle-to-cycle variations. In this study, a gas-jet direct-ignition method was applied to improve lean CNG engines operation. The gas-jet ignition method employs late injection timing technique which is very near to the ignition timing. The injected fuel reaches the ignition point with low jet velocity to ensure ignitability, while at the same time creating enough combustible mixture to support v flame core development. Through experiments, it was found that the gas-jet ignition method was able to operate in ultra lean mode at equivalence ratio less than 0. 3. To enable engine operation at equivalence ratio between 0. 3 and 0. 8, gas-jet ignition with two-stage injection method has to be implemented. The second gas injection followed by ignition similar to the gas-jet <b>ignition,</b> <b>ensures</b> ignitability. The first injection is delivered early similar to the premixed-type ignition method to create non-heterogeneous mixture to sustain flame development from the kernel initiated by the gas-jet ignition. In the application of gas-jet ignition with two-stage injection using a real engine, the ignitability, combustibility and THC formation were investigated by varying the first injection fuel delivery timing. Moreover, the effect of hydrogen addition to CNG fuel on the ignitability, combustibility and THC formation were also investigated. The fuel-air mixture distribution inside the combustion chamber prior to ignition timing was calculated using CFD software to provide hints on the combustion cyclic variability and THC formation found during the engine tests. Furthermore, flame of the gas-jet ignition with two-stage injection combustion was observed using a constant volume chamber. It was found that the gas-jet ignition and gas-jet ignition with two-stage injection methods are effective to extend lean combustible ranges of CNG engines. The first injection timing in the two-stage injection method is a key factor to the better engine performance because it affects flame development after ignition. The combustion cyclic variation and THC emission are sensitive to mixture distribution in clearance space of the combustion chamber around spark position just after ignition. Such mixture distribution is highly dependent on the first fuel delivery. At lean equivalence ratio, early injection produces well-dispersed bulk mixture leaner than CNG lean combustible limit, thus slows flame development. Late injection tends to produce rich mixture in the clearance space preventing initial flame development. Both cause relatively high THC emission. When hydrogen was added to CNG, it was found to effectively improve flame propagation, resulting in low THC emission free from cyclic variation. Hydrogen flame also supports CNG combustion with lean mixture...|$|R
