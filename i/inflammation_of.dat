5|$|In {{women with}} {{cervicitis}} (<b>inflammation</b> <b>of</b> the cervix) or vaginitis (<b>inflammation</b> <b>of</b> the vagina) and in {{young men with}} UTI symptoms, a Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrheae infection may be the cause. These infections are typically classified as a urethritis rather than a urinary tract infection. Vaginitis may also {{be due to a}} yeast infection. Interstitial cystitis (chronic pain in the bladder) may be considered for people who experience multiple episodes of UTI symptoms but urine cultures remain negative and not improved with antibiotics. Prostatitis (<b>inflammation</b> <b>of</b> the prostate) may also be considered in the differential diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|<b>Inflammation</b> <b>of</b> {{the thyroid}} is called thyroiditis. Inflamed thyroids may cause {{symptoms}} of hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. Two types thyroiditis initially present with hyperthyroidism and are sometimes {{followed by a}} period of hypothyroidism – Hashimoto's thyroiditis and postpartum thyroiditis. There are other disorders that cause <b>inflammation</b> <b>of</b> the thyroid, and these include subacute thyroiditis, acute thyroiditis, silent thyroiditis, Riedel's thyroiditis and traumatic injury, including palpation thyroiditis.|$|E

5|$|Individuals {{infected}} with H. pylori have a 10 to 20% lifetime {{risk of developing}} peptic ulcers and a 1 to 2% risk of acquiring stomach cancer. <b>Inflammation</b> <b>of</b> the pyloric antrum {{is more likely to}} lead to duodenal ulcers, while <b>inflammation</b> <b>of</b> the corpus (body of the stomach) is more likely to lead to gastric ulcers and gastric carcinoma. However, H. pylori possibly plays a role only in the first stage that leads to common chronic inflammation, but not in further stages leading to carcinogenesis. A meta-analysis conducted in 2009 concluded the eradication of H. pylori reduces gastric cancer risk in previously infected individuals, suggesting the continued presence of H. pylori constitutes a relative risk factor of 65% for gastric cancers; in terms of absolute risk, the increase was from 1.1% to 1.7%.|$|E

5|$|A {{wide array}} of {{bacterial}} and viral diseases affect sheep. Diseases of the hoof, such as foot rot and foot scald may occur, and are treated with footbaths and other remedies.

Bluetongue disease is an insect-borne illness causing fever and <b>inflammation</b> <b>of</b> the mucous membranes.

5|$|Cocker Spaniels {{and other}} dogs that have long, {{pendulous}} ears are more predisposed to ear problems {{than some other}} breeds. The fold of the ear can prevent air from entering, and it also creates a warm, moist environment where organisms can grow. Otitis externa is an <b>inflammation</b> <b>of</b> the ear canal which {{can be caused by}} a variety of factors including parasites, microorganisms, foreign bodies, tumors, and underlying dermatological disease. Ear mites can cause otitis externa; ticks and fleas can also live in dogs' ear canals.|$|E

40|$|Stem cell fate {{decisions}} {{are controlled by}} a molecular network in which transcription factors and miRNAs are of key importance. To systemically investigate their impact on neural stem cell (NSC) maintenance and neuronal commitment, we performed a high-throughput mRNA and miRNA profiling and isolated functional interaction networks of involved mechanisms. Thereby, we identified an E 2 F 1 –miRNA feedback loop as important regulator of NSC fate decisions. Although E 2 F 1 supports NSC proliferation and represses transcription of miRNAs from the miR- 17 ∼ 92 and miR- 106 a∼ 363 clusters, these miRNAs are transiently up-regulated at early stages of neuronal differentiation. In these early committed cells, increased miRNAs expression levels directly repress E 2 F 1 mRNA levels and inhibit cellular proliferation. In mice, we demonstrated that these miRNAs are expressed in the neurogenic areas and that E 2 F 1 inhibition represses NSC proliferation. The here presented data suggest a novel interaction mechanism between E 2 F 1 and miR- 17 ∼ 92 / miR- 106 a∼ 363 miRNAs in controlling NSC proliferation and neuronal differentiation.

5|$|During childhood, Goebbels {{suffered}} from ill health, {{which included a}} long bout of <b>inflammation</b> <b>of</b> the lungs. He had a deformed right foot that turned inwards, due to a congenital deformity. It was thicker and shorter than his left foot.

He was rejected for military service in World War I due to his deformity.|$|E

The link between gastrointestinal disorders and aphthous stomatitis is probably related to nutritional deficiencies caused by malabsorption. Less than 5% of people with RAS have Celiac disease, which usually presents with severe malnutrition, anemia, abdominal pain, diarrhea and glossitis (<b>inflammation</b> <b>of</b> the tongue). Sometimes aphthous-like ulcerations can be {{the only sign of}} celiac disease. Despite this association, a gluten-free diet does not usually improve the oral ulceration.|$|E
