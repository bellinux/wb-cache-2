He pitched in 139 games for the Indians, starting 100 and finishing 27. Early evidence of his versatility <b>is</b> <b>demonstrated</b> <b>by</b> his 41 complete games, 9 shutouts and 8 saves.|$|E
5|$|In 1036, Echmarcach {{replaced}} Amlaíb Cuarán's son, Sitriuc mac Amlaíb (died 1042), as King of Dublin. The Annals of Tigernach specifies that Sitriuc fled overseas as Echmarcach took control. An {{alliance with}} Donnchad could explain Echmarcach's success in seizing the kingship from Sitriuc. Although Donnchad and Sitriuc were maternal half-brothersas both descended from Gormlaith ingen Murchada (died 1030)Donnchad's hostility towards Sitriuc <b>is</b> <b>demonstrated</b> <b>by</b> {{the record of}} a successful attack he led upon the Dubliners in 1026.|$|E
5|$|Simeon {{turned the}} new Bulgarian capital Preslav into a {{magnificent}} {{religious and cultural}} centre, intended more as a display of his realm's heyday and as a royal residence than as a military fortress. With its more than twenty cross-domed churches and numerous monasteries, its impressive royal palace and the Golden (or Round) Church, Preslav was a true imperial capital. The development of Bulgarian art in the period <b>is</b> <b>demonstrated</b> <b>by</b> a ceramic icon of Theodore Stratelates and the Preslav-style illustrated ceramics.|$|E

5|$|The gods were {{believed}} to have many names. Among them were secret names that conveyed their true natures more profoundly than others. To know the true name of a deity was to have power over it. The importance of names <b>is</b> <b>demonstrated</b> <b>by</b> a myth in which Isis poisons the superior god Ra and refuses to cure him unless he reveals his secret name to her. Upon learning the name, she tells it to her son, Horus, and by learning it they gain greater knowledge and power.|$|E
5|$|The {{unearthed}} Antiquities (of art, architecture, {{customs and}} rituals) {{indicate that the}} prehistoric people of the Burzahom established contact with Central Asia and South West Asia and also had links to the Gangetic plains and peninsular India. The interaction of local and foreign influences <b>is</b> <b>demonstrated</b> <b>by</b> the art, architecture, customs, rituals and language demonstrated by some engravings on pottery and other artifacts. Some historians have stated that the Vedic Aryan culture extended into Kashmir, but archaeological investigation at Burzahom {{does not support the}} theory.|$|E
5|$|A less violent side to Alexander's {{government}} <b>is</b> <b>demonstrated</b> <b>by</b> other evidence. Over {{a century}} after his time, his administrative decisions were still being cited as precedents. Some of these are known from a surviving edict issued on July 6, 68, {{less than a month}} after Nero's death. This denounces, and introduces measures against, a variety of abuses including inaccurate tax assessments, malicious prosecutions and the imprisonment of debtors by private creditors. The edict's only allusion to the chaotic political situation comes as a call for trust in the benevolence of the new Emperor, Galba, and his ability to put right the wrongs of the past. Alexander was making representations to Galba on behalf of the provincials, presumably representing the desired reforms as the price of loyalty from this vital grain-producing province.|$|E

5|$|Ants {{are found}} on all continents except Antarctica, {{and only a}} few large islands, such as Greenland, Iceland, parts of Polynesia and the Hawaiian Islands lack native ant species. Ants occupy a wide range of {{ecological}} niches and exploit many different food resources as direct or indirect herbivores, predators and scavengers. Most ant species are omnivorous generalists, but a few are specialist feeders. Their ecological dominance <b>is</b> <b>demonstrated</b> <b>by</b> their biomass: ants are estimated to contribute 15–20% (on average and nearly 25% in the tropics) of terrestrial animal biomass, exceeding that of the vertebrates.|$|E
5|$|As {{there was}} no defined anti-shipping role in pre-war plans, obtaining {{information}} on the enemy's seaborne commercial traffic did not receive high priority, and once the war started, {{it was difficult to}} establish quickly the means of acquiring this information, especially after the fall of Norway and France in April and May 1940. The extent of the intelligence vacuum at the start of Coastal Command's campaign <b>is</b> <b>demonstrated</b> <b>by</b> the fact that Air Ministry planners were unaware of the heavy anti-aircraft armament being fitted to enemy merchant vessels. Casualty rates, often in excess of 20 percent, clarified matters in 1940.|$|E
5|$|Manstein {{did nothing}} to prevent the killing of Jews and other civilians in the areas where his units were operating, and in which his Eleventh Army {{actively}} participated. That Manstein {{was well aware of}} the Einsatzgruppen massacres <b>is</b> <b>demonstrated</b> <b>by</b> a 1941 letter he sent to Otto Ohlendorf, in which Manstein demands Ohlendorf hand over the wristwatches of murdered Jews. Manstein felt his men deserved the watches, since they were doing so much to help Ohlendorf's men with their work. Smelser and Davies note that this letter was the only time that Manstein ever complained about the activities of the Einsatzgruppen. Manstein later stated that he felt the number of Jews killed in the Holocaust was exaggerated.|$|E

5|$|The actual {{degree of}} {{authority}} any pirate captain exercised over his crew was questionable, {{as he had}} no access to the procedures and sanctions of admiralty law that supported government captains. Many pirate captains were elected by their crews and could be deposed in the same manner. Because of his ignorance of nautical matters, Bonnet was in an even weaker position than other pirate captains, as <b>is</b> <b>demonstrated</b> <b>by</b> the utter domination Blackbeard exercised over him during their collaboration. During Bonnet's early career, his crew {{seems to have been}} less than loyal to him and to have greatly preferred the more charismatic and experienced Blackbeard.|$|E
5|$|The archaic <b>is</b> <b>demonstrated</b> <b>by</b> {{jewellery}} {{and pieces}} {{such as the}} limestone Lady of Auxerre, from 640 BC; and the cylindrical Hera of Samos, circa 570–560BC. After the 4thcenturyBC, focus on the human form increased, exemplified by the Borghese Gladiator. The Louvre holds masterpieces from the Hellenistic era, including The Winged Victory of Samothrace (190BC) and the Venus de Milo, symbolic of classical art. The long Galerie Campana displays an outstanding {{collection of more than}} one thousand Greek potteries. In the galleries paralleling the Seine, much of the museum's Roman sculpture is displayed. The Roman portraiture is representative of that genre; examples include the portraits of Agrippa and Annius Verus; among the bronzes is the Greek Apollo of Piombino.|$|E
5|$|The spit {{sheltered}} the Glaven ports, Blakeney, Cley-next-the-Sea and Wiveton, {{which were}} important medieval harbours. Blakeney sent ships to help Edward I's war efforts in 1301, {{and between the}} 14th and 16th centuries {{it was the only}} Norfolk port between King's Lynn and Great Yarmouth to have customs officials. Blakeney Church has a second tower at its east end, an unusual feature in a rural parish church. It has been suggested that it acted as a beacon for mariners, perhaps by aligning it with the taller west tower to guide ships into the navigable channel between the inlet's sandbanks; that this was not always successful <b>is</b> <b>demonstrated</b> <b>by</b> a number of wrecks in the haven, including a carvel-built wooden ship.|$|E

5|$|Some of Mighty Jill Offs {{gameplay}} is {{borrowed from}} the 1986 arcade game Mighty Bomb Jack as a tribute. Players control Jill in only three ways: moving, jumping, and slowly descending. In the air, players may cause Jill to slowly descend by rapidly pushing the jump button while pointing in the direction that they want her to go. Players can switch direction while they do this. There are three types of obstacles: spikes, fire, and spiders; the latter can move to attack Jill when she comes close. Coming into contact with these obstacles kills Jill instantly, forcing her {{to start at the}} most recent checkpoint—typically located at a change in room. There is only one level in the game, but with several rooms in it. The screen scrolls vertically with Jill as she ascends up the tower. Each room transition <b>is</b> <b>demonstrated</b> <b>by</b> a change in the room's background colour. Jill has infinite lives, allowing players to play as long as they like without having to start the game over.|$|E

After 1880, the Ukrainians surpassed the Romanians as the second largest population group.|$|E
