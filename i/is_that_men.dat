25|$|The Eastern Orthodox Church {{does not}} {{consider}} the age of Church Fathers to be over and includes later influential writers {{up to the present}} day. The Orthodox view <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>men</b> do not have to agree on every detail, much less be infallible, to be considered Church Fathers. Rather, Orthodox doctrine is determined by the consensus of the Holy Fathers—those points on which they do agree. This consensus guides the church in questions of dogma, the correct interpretation of scripture, and to distinguish the authentic sacred tradition of the Church from false teachings.|$|E

25|$|Metastudies show a male {{advantage}} in mental rotation and assessing horizontality and verticality {{and a female}} {{advantage in}} spatial memory. A proposed hypothesis <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>men</b> and women evolved different mental abilities to adapt to their different roles in society. This explanation suggests that men may have evolved greater spatial abilities {{as a result of}} certain behaviors, such as navigating during a hunt. Similarly, this hypothesis suggests that women may have evolved to devote more mental resources to remembering locations of food sources in relation to objects and other features in order to gather food.|$|E
25|$|Coincidentally Anytus appears, whom Socrates praises {{as the son}} of Anthemion, {{who earned}} his fortune with {{intelligence}} and hard work. He says that Anthemion had his son well-educated and so Anytus is well-suited to join the investigation. Socrates suggests that the sophists are teachers of virtue. Anytus is horrified, saying that he neither knows any, nor cares to know any. Socrates then questions why it <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>men</b> do not always produce sons of the same virtue as themselves. He alludes to other notable male figures, such as Themistocles, Aristides, Pericles and Thucydides, and casts doubt on whether these men produced sons as capable of virtue as themselves. Anytus becomes offended and accuses Socrates of slander, warning him to be careful expressing such opinions. (The historical Anytus was one of Socrates' accusers in his trial.) Socrates suggests that Anytus does not realize what slander is, and continues his dialogue with Meno as to the definition of virtue.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{fundamental}} teachings of the Bahá'í Faith <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>men</b> and women are equal, and that equality of the sexes is a spiritual and moral standard that {{is essential for the}} unification of the planet and the unfoldment of peace. Bahá'í teachings note the importance of implementing this principle in individual, family, and community life. Nevertheless, the Bahá'í notion of the full spiritual and social equality of the two sexes does not imply sameness, so that gender distinction and differentiation are observed in certain areas of life. For example, while women can and do serve in an extensive range of elected and appointed positions within the faith at both national and international levels, they are not permitted to serve as members of the Universal House of Justice, the supreme governing institution of the Bahá'í Faith. Furthermore, the education of daughters is held to be more important than, and therefore to take precedence over, that of sons.|$|E

500|$|While Wollstonecraft does {{call for}} {{equality}} {{between the sexes}} in particular areas of life, such as morality, she does not explicitly state {{that men and women}} are equal. What she does claim <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>men</b> and women are equal in the eyes of God. However, such claims of equality stand in contrast to her statements respecting the superiority of masculine strength and valour. Wollstonecraft famously and ambiguously writes: [...] "Let it not be concluded that I wish to invert the order of things; I have already granted, that, from the constitution of their bodies, men seem to be designed by Providence to attain a greater degree of virtue. I speak collectively of the whole sex; but I see not the shadow of a reason to conclude that their virtues should differ in respect to their nature. In fact, how can they, if virtue has only one eternal standard? I must therefore, if I reason consequently, as strenuously maintain that they have the same simple direction, as that there is a God." [...] Her ambiguous statements regarding the equality of the sexes have since made it difficult to classify Wollstonecraft as a modern feminist, particularly since the word and the concept were unavailable to her.|$|E

2500|$|Various studies, {{including}} {{market research}} by Euro RSCG, {{have suggested that}} the pursuit of achievement and status is not as important to men as it used to be; and neither is, to a degree, the restriction of emotions or the disconnection of sex from intimacy. Another norm change supported by research <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>men</b> [...] "no longer find sexual freedom universally enthralling".

2500|$|According to Antonia Parvanova, {{one of the}} {{difficulties}} of dealing legally {{with the issue of}} DV <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>men</b> in many male dominated societies do not understand that inflicting violence against their wives is against the law.

2500|$|One {{factor that}} shows {{insignificant}} differences {{between male and}} female aggression is in sports. In sports, the rate of aggression in both contact and non-contact sports is relatively equal. Since the establishment of Title IX, female sports have increased in competitiveness and importance, which could contribute to the evening of aggression and the [...] "need to win" [...] attitude between both genders. Among sex differences found in adult sports were that females have a higher scale of indirect hostility while men have a higher scale of assault. Another difference found <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>men</b> have up to 20 times higher levels of testosterone than women.|$|E

2500|$|In etiquette, a {{traditional}} rule for arranging guests {{at a dinner}} table <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>men</b> and women should alternate positions, and that no married couple should sit next to each other.

For instance, the arrangements of vertices shown in the figure can be interpreted as seating charts of this type in which each husband and wife are seated as far apart as possible. The problem of counting the number of possible seating arrangements, or almost equivalently the number of Hamiltonian cycles in a crown graph, is known in combinatorics as the ménage problem; for crown graphs with 6, 8, 10, ... vertices the number of (oriented) Hamiltonian cycles is ...|$|E
2500|$|This {{classical}} sexual {{script is}} often popularized through television shows, popular films and pornography, which depict the man making a sexual advance {{and the woman}} initially resisting, but then finally positively responding by {{falling in love with}} him or experiencing orgasm (Cowen, Lee, Levy, and Snyder, 1988; Malamuth and Check, 1981; Smith, 1976; Waggett, 1989). The implied message <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>men</b> should persist beyond a woman's protest and women should say [...] "no" [...] even if they desire sex (Muehlenhard and McCoy, 1991). The more traditional the society, the closer the adherence to this sexual script. For this reason, many men do not believe that a woman means [...] "no" [...] when she says [...] "no", and continue to pressure the woman, and ultimately coerce or force her into sex; consent often becomes confused with submission.|$|E
2500|$|In the media, {{the ideal}} {{version of a}} man {{is seen as a}} strong, toned man. The {{idealized}} version of a woman is thin (Aubrey, pg. 7). The concept of body evaluation is more common in criticizing women. However, body evaluation revolves more towards nonverbal cues for men. It is more common in women because sexual, sometimes offensive, verbal remarks are directed towards women. Men, on the other hand, experience more body evaluation through gazing and other nonverbal cues. Gazing is simply the way in which depict men from an idealized perspective. Men tend to experience this from other men, whereas women experience it from both sexes. The Interpersonal Sexual Objectification Scale (ISOS) is a scale that shows sexual objectification of respondents, both men and women. While experiencing sexual objectification it creates the need to constantly maintain and critique one’s physical appearance. This leads to other things like eating disorders, body shaming, and anxiety. The ISOS scale can be related to objectification theory and sexism. Self-objectification, which {{is the way in which}} we evaluate ourselves, is concentrated more on women. [...] Men typically experience it through media display. [...] The difference <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>men</b> typically do not experience the negative effects to the extent that women do.|$|E
