He asks Krusty for help, but Krusty informs Bart {{that he has}} already helped the Duff Brewery set up free laser gun stands around Springfield. Bart then goes to his father, Homer, for help, and the duo quickly pursue Kang and Kodos to the brewery.

5|$|Filitti's death {{occurred}} {{shortly before}} a Romanian communist regime came into existence. He was {{survived by his}} wife and son. An aristocrats by blood and conservatives by conviction, Ioan C.'s descendants and relatives suffered heavily {{as a result of the}} new policies: the outspoken anti-communist Filitti-Robănești became a political prisoner, as did his cousin Puiu Filitti, who had been the King's Adjutant. Alexandrina Filitti was stripped of virtually all her land during the land reform and nationalization, but still forced to meet agricultural quotas imposed by the government; when she failed to do so, Manole Filitti took <b>it</b> <b>upon</b> <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> face the consequences, and spent some three years in communist jails.|$|E
5|$|The {{catalyst}} for this Norwegian intervention {{may have been}} the extension of Muirchertach's influence into the Irish Sea region following the death of Gofraid Crobán, King of the Isles (died 1095). The region itself appears to have degenerated into chaos following Gofraid's demise, and Magnús seems to have taken <b>it</b> <b>upon</b> <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> reassert Norwegian authority. Magnús made two expeditions into the Irish Sea region. One arrived in 1098; the other in 1102. The focus of the second overseas operation appears to have been Ireland itself. Following an apparent Norwegian conquest of Dublin, Magnús and Muirchertach negotiated a peace agreement, sealed through the marriage of Magnús' son, Sigurðr (died 1130), and Bjaðmunjo herself.|$|E

5|$|The comic series , {{picks up}} {{immediately}} after {{the events of the}} television series. Connor is shown sprinting home as ordered by Angel. He debates going back but gets drawn into the battle when the whole city is sent to hell by the Senior Partners. A veteran of hell, Connor takes <b>it</b> <b>upon</b> <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> provide sanctuary to humans and good demons. Along to help him are the benevolent werewolf Nina Ash, the mutant Gwen Raiden, and the vampire Spike. Connor also becomes much closer to Angel as he joins his newest battle to wrestle back control of the city from Demon Lords. Part of the story centers on Connor and Gwen's romance, which ends when he discovers Gwen has betrayed the team.|$|E
5|$|It {{was common}} for Christie to greet a {{returning}} submarine at the pier, and to award decorations {{to the crew}} on the spot. This bypassed naval award boards, and annoyed Kinkaid and Lockwood, possibly because confirmation of sinkings was accomplished by Ultra, the reading of coded Japanese radio traffic, and news of awards given so quickly could constitute a security breach. Complicating the matter was the fact MacArthur awarded army decorations to naval personnel; like Christie, he took <b>it</b> <b>upon</b> <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> authorize the decorations rather than {{to go through the}} standard review procedures. These events compelled Kinkaid to forbid Christie to give pierside awards, and to keep Christie from recommending the award of army medals to navy personnel. These events would ultimately contribute to Christie's dismissal as Commander of Submarines in Fremantle.|$|E
5|$|Real Madrid's {{hardcore}} {{supporters are}} the so-called Ultras Sur supporters, or simply Ultras. They {{are known for}} their extreme right-wing politics, akin to Barcelona's hardcore supporters group Boixos Nois. The Ultras Surs have developed an alliance with other right wing groups, most notably Lazio Irriducibili fans, and have also developed an alliance with left-wing groups. On several occasions, they have racially abused opposing players and have been investigated by UEFA for doing so. Florentino Pérez took <b>it</b> <b>upon</b> <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> ban the Ultras from the Bernabéu and assign their seats to the general public. This decision was controversial with some of the Bernabéu faithful, however, as the lively atmosphere of games would suffer as a result. The Ultras have since held protests outside the Bernabéu and have demanded to be reinstated and allowed to enter the grounds.|$|E
50|$|Mexico {{during that}} era was a {{relatively}} new country in need of new achievements. After their country lost the Mexican-American War, Mexicans needed {{to look up to}} someone or to some type of success as a source of national pride. When Braniff returned home with his airplane, many Mexicans began to see him as a symbol of hope. Braniff, who had learned to fly the airplane while still in Europe, took <b>it</b> up <b>upon</b> <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> become that source of pride.|$|R

The creditor, realizing that Annesley’s poverty meant he would likely never be paid, becomes enraged and decides to punish Annesley to {{the full extent of}} the law. The narrator, disgusted with {{the creditor}}, attempts to locate Annesley’s stolen property, but to no avail, and his own income is insufficient to assist his friend. The narrator’s patroness discovers the narrator’s distress and pays off the debt while also transferring an estate to Annesley. The excerpt ends here.|$|R
50|$|A {{century and}} a half later, Franklin D. Roosevelt took <b>it</b> <b>upon</b> <b>himself</b> as {{president}} <b>to</b> promote the use of the Dutch Colonial Revival style, and fieldstone, for new institutional buildings in his native Hudson Valley. He had personally made sure that new post offices in Poughkeepsie and later Rhinebeck, to the south and north, were built that way. Postmaster General James Farley asked him if he wanted to address Hyde Park's needs next, but the president told him to get Rhinebeck's post office built first since it had the greater need.|$|R
5|$|Eager to {{add another}} {{franchise}} player to their team, the Rockets heavily pursued free agent center Dwight Howard in the 2013 offseason. He officially signed with the Rockets on July 13, 2013. Led by the new inside-out combination of Howard and James Harden, and with a strong supporting cast including Chandler Parsons, Jeremy Lin, and Ömer Aşık, the Rockets were expected to jump into title contention in the upcoming season. However, in the post-season, the Rockets were defeated {{in the first round}} by the Portland Trail Blazers, losing the series 4–2. Still, in the 2014–15 season, without Lin and Parsons but reinforced by Trevor Ariza, the Rockets started the season well, winning the first four games of the season {{for the first time since}} 1996–97, and winning each of their first six games by 10 points or more, the first team to accomplish this feat since the 1985–86 Denver Nuggets. While the Rockets had many key players miss time throughout the entire season, James Harden took <b>it</b> <b>upon</b> <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> keep the Rockets near the top of the conference, turning him into an MVP front-runner. He became the first Rocket to score 50 points in a game since Hakeem Olajuwon, as well as the only player in franchise history to record multiple 50 point games in a season. On April 15, 2015, the Rockets beat the Jazz to claim their first ever Southwest Division title and first Division crown since 1994, and by completing 56 wins finished with the third-best regular season record in franchise history. During the playoffs, the Rockets beat the Mavericks 4–1 in the first round, and overcame a 3–1 deficit against the Los Angeles Clippers to win the Western Semifinals and return to the Conference Finals for the first time in 18 years. In the Conference Finals, the Rockets were defeated by the Golden State Warriors 4–1.|$|E
5|$|The large {{diversity}} of the flora around Adams is even more apparent in the herbage and, including the tree and shrub species previously mentioned, totals at least 843 species. This is {{more than any other}} mountain in the Pacific Northwest. The first extensive list of flora from the area around Mount Adams was published in 1896 by William Suksdorf and Thomas Howell and listed 480 species. Suksdorf had taken <b>it</b> <b>upon</b> <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> catalogue as many species around Adams as he could and the list was the result of his extraordinary collection efforts. This was the most complete list for over a century and has finally been updated by David Beik and Susan McDougall to the current 843 species with hundreds of additional species listed. Adams is home to many rare plants including tall bugbane, Suksdorf’s monkeyflower, northern microseris (Microceris borealis), Brewer’s potentilla (Potentilla breweri), and mountain blue-eyed grass. The plant diversity is most evident in the many meadows and wetlands on the flanks of Adams. The notable Bird Creek Meadows includes in its famous display, magenta paintbrush, arrowleaf ragwort, penstemons, lupines, monkeyflowers, mountain heathers, and many others. In wetlands, generally at lower elevations, one can find bog blueberry, highbush cranberry, sundew, purple cinquefoil, and flatleaf bladderwort, in addition to many sedges and rushes. Subalpine and alpine meadows and parklands, while not as prolific as the meadows and wetlands of lower elevations, have a beautiful display as well with partrigefoot, Cascade rockcress, subalpine buttercup, Sitka valerian, alpine false candytuft, elegant Jacob’s ladder, and various buckwheats as prominent players.|$|E
5|$|With double-digits wins {{against the}} Lakers, Utah, Boston and Philadelphia {{to start the}} 2014–15 NBA season, the Rockets {{recorded}} a 4-0 start {{for the first time}} since they won their first six games of the 1996–97 season. By recording double-digit wins against Miami and San Antonio in their next two games, the Rockets won each of their first six games by 10 points or more, and became the first team to accomplish the feat since the 1985–86 Denver Nuggets. In December, the Rockets acquired Corey Brewer and Josh Smith, two veterans who added depth to the roster. While the Rockets had many key players miss time throughout the entire season, James Harden took <b>it</b> <b>upon</b> <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> keep the Rockets near the top of the conference, which turned him into an MVP front-runner. On March 20, 2015, Harden scored a career-high 50 points in a 118–108 victory over the Nuggets. Harden became the first Rocket to score 50 points since Hakeem Olajuwon scored 51 against the Celtics in 1996. On April 1, Harden scored 51 points in a 115–111 win over the Sacramento Kings, becoming the first player in franchise history to record multiple 50 point games in a season. On April 15, 2015, the Rockets won their 56th game of the season and finished with the third-best regular season record in franchise history. On that same night, the Rockets claimed their first ever Southwest Division title and first Division crown since 1994. In the playoffs, the Rockets beat the Mavericks 4-1 in the first round. In the Conference Semifinals, the Los Angeles Clippers built a 3-1 lead over the Rockets, before the Rockets won the last three games in the series to return to the Conference Finals for the first time in 18 years, this time against the Golden State Warriors. With their win over the Clippers, the Rockets became just the ninth team in NBA history to win a playoff series in which they faced a 3-1 deficit. In the Conference Finals, the Warriors won the first three games before Harden scored 45 points to win Game 4 at the Toyota Center. The Warriors then finished the series in Game 5, winning 4-1.|$|E
50|$|The Free Will Baptist {{congregation}} in Milo {{was established in}} 1827, and was the community's first organized congregation. It was joined in 1840 by a Baptist congregation. The two groups negotiated for many years concerning {{the construction of a}} sanctuary, but nothing occurred beyond the donation of land until William Owen, a local farmer {{and a member of the}} Baptist congregation, took <b>it</b> <b>upon</b> <b>himself</b> in 1853 <b>to</b> fund and oversee the construction of the present building's main block, albeit with vernacular Greek Revival styling. Owen was partially compensated for his efforts by the sale of pews. The building was used by both congregations until 1888, when the Baptists moved to a separate building.|$|R
6000|$|So far {{as may be}} {{collected}} from {{the evidence of the}} Company's records, Mr. Barwell's assertions do not appear well supported; but even if they were more plausible, your Committee apprehend that he could not be discharged from his solemn recorded promise to abide by the judgment of the Court of Directors. Their judgment was declared by their resolution to prosecute, which <b>it</b> depended <b>upon</b> <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> satisfy by making good his engagement. To excuse his not complying with the Company's claims, he says, [...] "that his compliance would be urged as a confession of delinquency, and to proceed from conviction of his having usurped {{on the rights of the}} Company." [...] Considerations of this nature might properly have induced Mr. Barwell to stand upon his right in the first instance, [...] "and to appeal" [...] (to use his own words) [...] "to the laws of his country, in order to vindicate his fame." [...] But his performance could not have more weight to infer delinquency than his promise. Your Committee think his observation comes too late.|$|R

As part of a trust exercise, Ava asks Matt to take a naked photograph of her, and later offers him sexual intercourse in return for good grades. Matt and Ava sleep together, and Matt discovers that she has a teenage son, Adrian. Meanwhile, Sean, Julia and Christian all discover Ava's duplicitous, dangerous nature, and Christian takes <b>it</b> <b>upon</b> <b>himself</b> (due <b>to</b> recently discovering he is Matt's biological father) to try to keep Matt away from her after catching him masturbating outside of her window.
