While higher hydrogen concentration leads to the inhibition of PAH growth, it simultaneously facilitates pentagon and heptagon defect healing, leading to thermodynamically more stable PAH fragments with more hexagons.

Overexpression of a constitutively active mutant of Rap 1 (Rap 1 -CA) and knockdown of SPA- 1, a Rap 1 GTPase-activating protein that was negatively regulated by afadin by virtue of binding to it, in afadin-knockdown NIH 3 T 3 cells restored the formation of leading <b>edge</b> <b>structures</b> and the reduction of the PDGF-induced activation of Rac 1 and inactivation of RhoA, suggesting that the inactivation of Rap 1 by SPA- 1 is responsible for inhibition of the formation of leading <b>edge</b> <b>structures.</b> The effect of Rap 1 -CA on the restoration of the formation of leading <b>edge</b> <b>structures</b> and RhoA inactivation was diminished by additional knockdown of ARAP 1, a Rap-activated Rho GAP, which localized at the leading edges of moving NIH 3 T 3 cells.

40|$|Due {{to recent}} {{increase}} in the usage of 3 -D magnetic resonance images (MRI) and analysis of functional magnetic resonance images (fMRI), research on 3 -D image processing becomes important. Observed 3 - D images often contain noise which should be removed {{in such a way}} that important image features, e. g., <b>edges,</b> <b>edge</b> <b>structures,</b> and other image details should be preserved, so that subsequent image analyses are reliable. Most image denoising methods in the literature are for 2 -D images. However, their direct generalizations to 3 - D images can not preserve complicated <b>edge</b> <b>structures</b> well. Because, the <b>edge</b> <b>structures</b> in a 3 -D edge surface can be much more complicated than the <b>edge</b> <b>structures</b> in a 2 -D edge curve. Moreover, the amount of smoothing should be determined locally, depending on local image features and local signal to noise ratio, which is much more challenging in 3 -D images due to large number of voxels. This paper proposes an efficient 3 - D image denoising procedure based on local clustering of the voxels. This method provides a framework for determining the size of bandwidth and the amount of smoothing locally by empirical procedures.

40|$|Abstract Background Fetal spinal {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI) is a prenatal routine for proper assessment of fetus development, especially when suspected spinal malformations occur while ultrasound fails to provide details. Limited by hardware, fetal spine MR images suffer from its low resolution. High-resolution MR images can directly enhance readability and improve diagnosis accuracy. Image interpolation for higher resolution is required in clinical situations, while many methods fail to preserve <b>edge</b> <b>structures.</b> <b>Edge</b> carries heavy structural messages of objects in visual scenes for doctors to detect suspicions, classify malformations and make correct diagnosis. Effective interpolation with well-preserved <b>edge</b> <b>structures</b> is still challenging. Method In this paper, we propose an edge-directed interpolation (EDI) method and apply it {{on a group of}} fetal spine MR images to evaluate its feasibility and performance. This method takes edge messages from Canny edge detector to guide further pixel modification. First, low-resolution (LR) images of fetal spine are interpolated into high-resolution (HR) images with targeted factor by bi-linear method. Then edge information from LR and HR images is put into a twofold strategy to sharpen or soften <b>edge</b> <b>structures.</b> Finally a HR image with well-preserved <b>edge</b> <b>structures</b> is generated. The HR images obtained from proposed method are validated and compared with that from other four EDI methods. Performances are evaluated from six metrics, and subjective analysis of visual quality is based on regions of interest (ROI). Results All these five EDI methods are able to generate HR images with enriched details. From quantitative analysis of six metrics, the proposed method outperforms the other four from signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structure similarity index (SSIM), feature similarity index (FSIM) and mutual information (MI) with seconds-level time consumptions (TC). Visual analysis of ROI shows that the proposed method maintains better consistency in <b>edge</b> <b>structures</b> with the original images. Conclusions The proposed method classifies edge orientations into four categories and well preserves structures. It generates convincing HR images with fine details and is suitable in real-time situations. Iterative curvature-based interpolation (ICBI) method may result in crisper edges, while the other three methods are sensitive to noise and artifacts...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – Most of the {{existing}} image interpolation schemes assume that the image to be interpolated is noise free. This assumption is invalid in practice because noise will be inevitably introduced in the image acquisition process. Usually the image is denoised first and is then interpolated. The denoising process, however, may destroy the image <b>edge</b> <b>structures</b> and introduce artifacts. Meanwhile, edge preservation is a critical issue in both image denoising and interpolation. To address these problems, {{in this paper we}} propose a directional denoising scheme, which naturally endows a subsequent directional interpolator. The problems of denoising and interpolation are modeled as to estimate the noiseless and missing samples under the same framework of optimal estimation. The local statistics is adaptively calculated to guide the estimation process. For each noisy sample, we compute multiple estimates of it along different directions and then fuse those directional estimates for a more accurate output. The estimation parameters calculated in the denoising processing can be readily used to interpolate the missing samples. Compared with the conventional schemes that perform denoising and interpolation in tandem, the proposed noisy image interpolation method can reduce many noise-caused interpolation artifacts and preserve well the image <b>edge</b> <b>structures...</b>|$|R
