5|$|One last Scottish attempt {{against the}} king's person {{occurred}} in August 1600, when James was apparently assaulted by Alexander Ruthven, the Earl of Gowrie's younger brother, at Gowrie House, {{the seat of}} the Ruthvens. Ruthven was run through by James's page John Ramsay and the Earl of Gowrie was killed in the ensuing fracas; there were few surviving witnesses. Given James's history with the Ruthvens {{and the fact that he}} owed them a great <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> <b>money,</b> his account of the circumstances was not universally believed.|$|E

In {{the wake of}} the March 2005 Tulip Revolution which sent Akayev into exile in Russia, he was appointed Prosecutor General of the Kyrgyz Republic and waged a determined campaign against Akayev and his family, seeking the return of much of the fortune amassed by the former president's family and a repeal of Akayev's immunity for life. He resigned his position in September 2005 under a cloud of suspicion concerning alleged secret <b>deals</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> for premature closure of investigations into other misdeeds.|$|R

5|$|Converting to evangelical Christianity in the 1880s, Sunday left {{baseball}} for the Christian ministry. He gradually developed his {{skills as a}} pulpit evangelist in the Midwest and then, during the early 20th century, he became the nation's most famous evangelist with his colloquial sermons and frenetic delivery. Sunday held widely reported campaigns in America's largest cities, and he attracted the largest crowds of any evangelist {{before the advent of}} electronic sound systems. He also made a great <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> and was welcomed into the homes of the wealthy and influential. Sunday was a strong supporter of Prohibition, and his preaching likely {{played a significant role in}} the adoption of the Eighteenth Amendment in 1919.|$|E

Before he can kill Nate, a loose torpedo charge previously accidentally triggered by Nate causes the U-boat to explode, distracting the gang long enough for Drake to escape. He runs into Elena, who agrees to help him find the statue, and together they use Sully's plane to travel to the old colony.|$|E

5|$|A {{few days}} later, the shark kills {{a young boy}} named Alex Kintner and an old man {{not far from the}} shore. A local fisherman, Ben Gardner, is sent by Amity's {{authorities}} to kill the shark but disappears on the water. Brody and deputy Leonard Hendricks find Gardner's boat anchored off-shore, empty, and covered with large bite holes, one of which has a massive shark tooth stuck in it. Blaming himself for these deaths, Brody again tries to close the beaches, while Meadows investigates the Mayor's business contacts to determine why he wants to keep the beaches open. Meadows uncovers links to the Mafia, who pressure Vaughn to keep the beaches open {{in order to protect the}} value of Amity's real estate, in which the Mafia invested a great <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> <b>money.</b> Meadows also recruits marine biologist Matt Hooper from the Woods Hole Institute to advise them on how to deal with the shark.|$|E
5|$|Despite these successes, {{the number}} of {{innovations}} introduced {{at the same time}} made the class unreliable and difficult to maintain. A great <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> was wasted on resolving the problems of a class designed for duties that could have been undertaken by cheaper 2-6-2 or 4-6-0 mixed-traffic locomotives. Likewise, more Light Pacifics were built than were needed, frequently undertaking tasks that would usually befit a much smaller locomotive. A curious but common sight west of Exeter during the winter months was a Light Pacific hauling a local stopping service with a single carriage to destinations as diverse as Padstow and Wadebridge. Finally, too much money was spent on the expensive rebuilding programme when dieselisation and modernisation meant the locomotives would have very limited lives in their new guise.|$|E

40|$|The UK’s {{universities}} and research funders have been leading {{the rest of}} the world in the movement toward Open Access (OA) to research with “Green” OA mandates requiring researchers to self-archive their journal articles on the web, free for all. A report has emerged from the Finch committee that looks superficially as if it were supporting OA, but is strongly biased in favor of the interests of the publishing industry over the interests of UK research. Instead of recommending building on the UK’s lead in cost-free Green OA, the committee has recommended spending a great <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> extra <b>money</b> to pay publishers for “Gold” OA publishing. If the Finch committee were heeded, the UK would lose both its lead in OA and a great <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> public <b>money</b> [...] and worldwide OA would be set back at least a decade. <br/...|$|R

50|$|Following World War II, {{the great}} colonial empires {{established}} by the Western powers beginning in early modern times began to collapse. There were several reasons for this. Firstly, World War II had devastated European economies and had forced governments to spend great <b>deals</b> <b>of</b> <b>money,</b> making the price of colonial administration increasingly hard to manage. Secondly, the two new superpowers following the war, the United States and Soviet Union were both opposed to imperialism, so the now weakened European Empires could generally not look to the outside for help. Thirdly, Westerners increasingly {{were not interested in}} maintaining and even opposed the existence of empires. The fourth reason was the rise of independence movements following the war. The future leaders of these movements had often been educated at colonial schools run by Westerners where they adopted Western ideas like freedom, equality, self-determination and nationalism, and which turned them against their colonial rulers.|$|R
