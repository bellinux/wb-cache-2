After his death, however, stories about his evangelism {{circulated}} widely.

5|$|According to the Shumbha-Nishumbha {{story of}} Devi Mahatmya, Matrikas appear as Shaktis from {{the bodies of}} the gods– Brahma, Shiva, Skanda, Vishnu, Indra; having form of each, {{approached}} Chandika (identified with Devi) with whatever form, ornaments and vehicle the god possessed. In that form, they slaughter the demon army. Thus, the Matrikas are goddesses of the battlefield. They are described as assistants of Durga having sinister as well as propitious characteristics. After the battle, the Matrikas dance drunk with their victim's blood. This <b>description</b> <b>is</b> repeated with little variation in Devi Bhagavata Purana. and Vamana Purana. The Devi-Bhagavata Purana mentions three other goddesses, Shaktis of other gods in addition to Saptamatrikas making a group of 10 Matrikas.|$|E

5|$|Fluid models {{describe}} plasmas {{in terms}} of smoothed quantities, like density and averaged velocity around each position (see Plasma parameters). One simple fluid model, magnetohydrodynamics, treats the plasma as a single fluid governed {{by a combination of}} Maxwell's equations and the Navier–Stokes equations. A more general <b>description</b> <b>is</b> the two-fluid plasma picture, where the ions and electrons are described separately. Fluid models are often accurate when collisionality is sufficiently high to keep the plasma velocity distribution close to a Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution. Because fluid models usually describe the plasma {{in terms of}} a single flow at a certain temperature at each spatial location, they can neither capture velocity space structures like beams or double layers, nor resolve wave-particle effects.|$|E
5|$|In a 2009 {{review of}} the genus Gyromitra, authors van Vooren and Moreau say that Bosc's {{original}} species <b>description</b> <b>is</b> ambiguous, leaving much room for interpretation, and they suggest that several reports of the species occurring in Europe should be referred to Gyromitra fastigiata. They point out that in 1970, Estonian mycologist Ain Raitviir considered Bosc's Morchella caroliniana a nomen dubium, and Fries's description as nomen confusum, and advocated the abandonment of the specific epithet caroliniana. In the early 1970s, Kent McKnight redefined the taxon and selected a neotype, based on five specimens collected from Lorton, Virginia in 1942.|$|E
5|$|Kinetic models {{describe}} the particle velocity distribution function at each {{point in the}} plasma and therefore {{do not need to}} assume a Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution. A kinetic <b>description</b> <b>is</b> often necessary for collisionless plasmas. There are two common approaches to kinetic description of a plasma. One is based on representing the smoothed distribution function on a grid in velocity and position. The other, known as the particle-in-cell (PIC) technique, includes kinetic information by following the trajectories {{of a large number of}} individual particles. Kinetic models are generally more computationally intensive than fluid models. The Vlasov equation may be used to {{describe the}} dynamics of a system of charged particles interacting with an electromagnetic field.|$|E

5|$|Scelidosaurus lived {{during the}} Early Jurassic Period, during the Sinemurian to Pliensbachian stages around 191million years ago. This genus and related genera {{at the time}} lived on the supercontinent Laurasia. Its fossils have been found near Charmouth in Dorset, England, and {{are known for their}} {{excellent}} preservation. Scelidosaurus has been called the earliest complete dinosaur. It is the most completely known dinosaur of the British Isles. Scelidosaurus is currently the only classified dinosaur found in Ireland. Despite this, a modern <b>description</b> <b>is</b> still lacking. After initial finds in the 1850s, comparative anatomist Richard Owen named and described Scelidosaurus in 1859. Only one species, Scelidosaurus harrisonii named by Owen in 1861, is considered valid today, although one other species was proposed in 1996.|$|E
5|$|The {{alkali metals}} form {{complete}} series of compounds with all usually encountered anions, which well illustrate group trends. These compounds {{can be described}} as involving the alkali metals losing electrons to acceptor species and forming monopositive ions. This <b>description</b> <b>is</b> most accurate for alkali halides and becomes less and less accurate as cationic and anionic charge increase, and as the anion becomes larger and more polarisable. For instance, ionic bonding gives way to metallic bonding along the series NaCl, Na2O, Na2S, Na3P, Na3As, Na3Sb, Na3Bi, Na.|$|E
5|$|The {{specimens}} of Pulveroboletus bembae {{upon which the}} species <b>description</b> <b>is</b> based were collected in April, 2008 from three locations in Gabon: in Ogooue-Ivindo Province at the Ipassa-Makokou Research Station; in the Minkébé National Park near Minvoul, and in Bitouga, both locations in the northerly province of Woleu-Ntem. Until the report of this species and the related Pulveroboletus luteocarneus, 12 species of Pulveroboletus had been reported in tropical Africa. According to Degreef & DeKesel, who described the species in a 2009 publication, P.bembae belongs to the section Pulveroboletus of the genus Pulveroboletus. This section, defined by Singer in 1947, {{is characterized by the}} presence of a pulverulent-arachnoid veil (covered with fine, powdery wax granules and cobwebby) and fruit bodies that are sulphur-yellow, greenish, or yellowish-brown in color.|$|E

5|$|The {{taxonomy}} of Scleractinia is particularly challenging. Many species were described {{before the advent}} of scuba diving, with little realisation by the authors that coral species could have varying morphologies in different habitats. Collectors were mostly limited to observing corals on reef flats, and were unable to observe the changes in morphology that occurred in more turbid, deeper-water conditions. More than 2,000 nominal species were described in this era, and by the rules of nomenclature, the name given to the first described species has precedence over the rest, even when that <b>description</b> <b>is</b> poor, and the environment and even sometimes the country of the type specimen is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{its very}} patchy range, the copper shark has been scientifically {{described}} several times from different locales. The earliest valid <b>description</b> <b>is</b> presently {{considered to be}} British zoologist Albert Günther's account of Carcharias brachyurus in the 1870 eighth volume of Catalogue of the fishes in the British Museum. The earliest name was {{once thought to be}} Auguste Duméril's 1865 Carcharias remotus, until {{it was found that the}} type specimen associated with that name is actually a blacknose shark (C. acronotus). Thus, this shark was often referred to as C. remotus in older literature. An even earlier name, Richard Owen's 1853 Galeolamna greyi, is of questionable taxonomic status as it was based solely on a set of now-destroyed jaws that may or may not have belonged to a copper shark. Modern authors have assigned this species to the genus Carcharhinus.|$|E
