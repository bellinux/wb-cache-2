The size and density of growth defects in the W-DLC coatings strongly depend on the surface roughness of the rubber sheets. The tribological behavior of uncoated and coated rubbers has been investigated with ball-on-disk tribotest under dry sliding condition against a 6 mm 100 Cr 6 ball. Uncoated rubbers exhibited a very high coefficient of friction (> 0. 9). W-DLC coated FKM did not considerably reduce the friction because the coating was damaged due to poor adhesion. W-DLC coated HNBR and ACM exhibited excellent tribological performance, and very low coefficients of friction (< 0. 24) were achieved even at high normal load of 5 N. After tribotests, the W-DLC coatings on HNBR and ACM were intact and no serious damage was observed on the wear tracks. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{statistical}} {{property of}} the weak lensing fields is studied quantitatively using the ray-tracing simulations. Motivated by the empirical lognormal model that characterizes the probability distribution function(PDF) of the three-dimensional mass distribution excellently, we critically investigate the validity of lognormal model in the weak lensing statistics. Assuming that the convergence field, κ, is approximately described by the lognormal distribution, we present analytic formulae of convergence for the one-point PDF and the Minkowski functionals. Comparing those predictions with ray-tracing simulations in various cold dark matter models, {{we find that the}} one-point lognormal PDF can describe the non-Gaussian tails of convergence fields accurately up to ν∼ 10, where ν is the level threshold given by ν≡κ/^ 1 / 2, although the systematic deviation from lognormal prediction becomes manifest at higher source redshift and larger smoothing scales. The lognormal formulae for Minkowski functionals also fit to the simulation results when the source redshift is low. Accuracy of the lognormal-fit remains good even at the small angular scales, where the perturbation formulae by Edgeworth <b>expansion</b> <b>break</b> down. On the other hand, lognormal models does not provide an accurate prediction for the statistics sensitive to the rare events such as the skewness and the kurtosis of convergence. We therefore conclude that the empirical lognormal model of the convergence field is safely applicable as a useful cosmological tool, as long as we are concerned with the non-Gaussianity of ν 5 for low source redshift samples.

40|$|We {{discuss the}} notion of a large field cutoff for LGT with compact groups. We propose and compare gauge {{invariant}} and gauge dependent (in the Landau gauge) criteria to sort the configurations into “large-field ” and “small-field ” configurations. We show that the correlations between volume average of field size indicators and the behavior of the tail of the distribution are very different in the gauge and scalar cases. We show that the effect of discarding the large field configurations on the plaquette average is very different above, below and near β = 5. 6 for a pure SU(3) LGT. A common challenge for quantum field theorists consists in finding accurate methods in regimes where existing <b>expansions</b> <b>break</b> down. In the RG language, this amounts to find acceptable interpolations for the RG flows in intermediate regions between fixed points. In a SU(3) pure gauge theory near β ≃ 6, the validity of weak and strong coupling <b>expansions</b> <b>break</b> down and the MC method seems to be the only reliable method. In the following, we discuss recent attempts to improve weak coupling expansions. In the case of scalar field theory, the weak coupling expansion is unable to reproduce the exponential suppression of the large field configurations coming from the factor exp(−λ ∑ φ 4 x) in the functional integral. This problem can be resolved [1, 2] by introducing a large field cutoff |φ | < φmax. One is then considering a slightly different problem, however a judicious choice of φmax can be used to reduce or eliminate the discrepancy. This optimization procedure can be approximately performed using the strong coupling expansion and naturally bridges the gap between the weak and strong coupling expansions [3].
