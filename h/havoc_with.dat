5|$|Farmers rely on weather {{forecasts}} {{to decide}} what work to do on any particular day. For example, drying hay is only feasible in dry weather. Prolonged periods of dryness can ruin cotton, wheat, and corn crops. While corn crops can be ruined by drought, their dried remains {{can be used as}} a cattle feed substitute in the form of silage. Frosts and freezes play <b>havoc</b> <b>with</b> crops both during the spring and fall. For example, peach trees in full bloom can have their potential peach crop decimated by a spring freeze. Orange groves can suffer significant damage during frosts and freezes, regardless of their timing.|$|E
5|$|Dexter {{manages to}} keep the lab a secret from his clueless, cheerful Mom (voiced by Kath Soucie) and Dad (voiced by Jeff Bennett), who never take notice of it. However, he is {{frequently}} in conflict with his hyperactive older sister, Dee Dee (voiced by Allison Moore in seasons 1 and 3; Kat Cressida in seasons 2 and 4). In spite of Dexter's advanced technology, Dee Dee eludes all manner of security, and once inside her brother's laboratory, she delights in playing haphazardly, often wreaking <b>havoc</b> <b>with</b> his inventions. Though seemingly dim-witted, Dee Dee often outsmarts her brother and even gives him helpful advice. For his part, Dexter, though annoyed by his intrusive sibling, feels a reluctant affection for her and will come to her defense if she is imperiled.|$|E

25|$|The {{one major}} {{exception}} to mundane missions occurred in late 1944. Due to their garrisons {{on the various}} islands of the Aegean, the Germans had maintained control over the Aegean Sea long after they had lost {{other areas of the}} Mediterranean to Allied control. In late 1944, that changed as an Allied carrier task force moved into the area. Composed entirely of escort carriers, the task force wreaked <b>havoc</b> <b>with</b> German shipping in the area and re-asserted Allied dominance over the last remaining area of the Mediterranean still controlled by the Germans.|$|E
25|$|On December 3, 1840, the James River and Kanawha Canal from Richmond reached Lynchburg. It {{extended}} {{as far as}} Buchanan, Virginia in 1851, {{but never}} reached {{a tributary of the}} Ohio River as planned. Lynchburg's population exceeded 6,000 by 1840, and a water works system was built. However, floods in 1842 and 1847 wreaked <b>havoc</b> <b>with</b> the canal and towpath. Although both were repaired, because Virginia's General Assembly continued to refuse to fund a railroad to replace it, civic boosters began selling subscriptions for the Lynchburg and Tennessee Railroad the next year.|$|E
25|$|One {{popular and}} cheap source for bench top {{material}} is old bowling alley lanes. These are usually made from thick, high-quality laminated maple. Two problems present themselves with bowling alley wood: first, the waxes {{used on the}} surface for bowling frequently contain silicone and other substances that can play <b>havoc</b> <b>with</b> work pieces at finishing time - a little silicone on a project will cause trouble with many finishes, and won't manifest it until it's too late. The other problem with bowling alley wood is nails. Most pieces have loads of nails buried in them, which do not mix well with woodworking tools.|$|E

25|$|After {{ordering}} his {{engineers to}} begin rebuilding the bridge, Jackson directed Col. Thomas T. Munford's 2nd Virginia Cavalry {{to cross the}} swamp and capture some of the Union guns abandoned during the bombardment. As the men and horses waded through water that was belly deep and fouled with debris, Jackson and Maj. Gen. D.H. Hill crossed the river to perform a personal reconnaissance. A Union artillery shell exploded {{only a few feet}} away from the generals mounted on horseback, although neither was injured. Jackson saw that Union artillery and infantry was reinforcing the position, and that Federal sharpshooters would play <b>havoc</b> <b>with</b> his engineers on the bridge. He realized that this was not a place that he could make an opposed crossing.|$|E
25|$|Historian Harvey Klehr {{indicates}} that {{membership of the}} WAA did exhibit growth after unification, however, in large measure {{as a result of}} growth of the WPA jobs program and the ability of now employed WPA workers to pay the relatively nominal dues of the WAA. Despite misgivings about painting itself into a corner as a de facto trade union for WPA employees, it seems that in practice the WAA became exactly that, with WPA employees constituting some 75 percent of the organization's dues paying membership by 1939. The survival of the WAA was thus intimately linked with the fate of the WPA program, with periodic layoffs of WPA workers due to budgetary constraints playing <b>havoc</b> <b>with</b> the WAA's membership rolls.|$|E
25|$|Tunisian nationalists would {{complain}} that these improvements, e.g., {{the rail and}} mining operations, were intended to benefit primarily France; the French profited most, and the employment opportunities were open more to French colons than to Tunisians. French companies provided their own engineers, technicians, managers, and accountants, {{and most of the}} skilled work force. Another major grievance of nationalist critics regarded the 'flood' of cheap manufactured goods entering the Tunisian market. This competition worked <b>havoc</b> <b>with</b> the large artisan class, until then in good health and vigor, who made comparable goods by hand according to tradition. Here, the French did no more than passively introduce into Tunisia the fruits of advanced production techniques, and then let neutral market forces wreck their destruction on the local merchants, who could not compete on price.|$|E

25|$|In Middle East affairs, Brown {{supported}} President Carter's {{efforts as}} an intermediary in the Egyptian-Israeli negotiations {{leading to the}} Camp David Accords of September 1978 and the signing by the two nations of a peace treaty in March 1979. Elsewhere, {{the fall of the}} Shah from power in Iran in January 1979 eliminated a major U.S. ally and triggered a chain of events that played <b>havoc</b> <b>with</b> American policy in the region. In November 1979, Iranian revolutionaries occupied the U.S. embassy in Tehran and took more than 50 hostages. Brown participated closely in planning for a rescue operation that ended in failure and the loss of eight U.S. servicemen on 2425 April 1980. Not until the last day of his administration, on 20 January 1981, could President Carter make final arrangements for the release of the hostages.|$|E
25|$|The dinosaurs {{were made}} by Delgado {{in the same fashion}} as Kong and based on Charles R. Knight's murals in the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. All the {{armatures}} were manufactured in the RKO machine shop. Materials used were cotton, foam rubber, latex sheeting, and liquid latex. Football bladders were placed inside some models to simulate breathing. A scale of one-inch-equals-one-foot was employed and models ranged from 18 inches to 3 feet in length. Several of the models were originally built for Creation and sometimes two or three models were built of individual species. Prolonged exposure to studio lights wreaked <b>havoc</b> <b>with</b> the latex skin so John Cerasoli carved wooden duplicates of each model to be used as stand-ins for test shoots and lineups. He carved wooden models of Ann, Driscoll, and other human characters. Models of the Venture, railway cars, and war planes were built.|$|E
25|$|The witches' teat is {{associated}} with the perversion of maternal power by witches in early modern England. The witches' teat {{is associated}} with the feeding of witches' imps or familiars; the witch's familiar supposedly aided the witch in her magic in exchange for nourishment (blood) from sacrificial animals or from the witch's teat. It is also where the devil supposedly suckles when he comes at night to bed his faithful servants, sometimes impregnating them with his seed. Once the devilish half-breed has been conceived, the cambion may only feed upon this teat and no other. Folklore suggests that on the 7th day of the 7th week of consecutive feeding upon the teat, the cambion would grow to adulthood immediately and begin wreaking <b>havoc</b> <b>with</b> a range of demonic powers inherited from its supernatural father. However, should the ritual be disrupted during the 49-day period, the process has to restart all over again.|$|E

50|$|Some {{activists and}} {{scholars}} have, between 2002 and 2008, questioned {{the merits of}} Indian rivers inter-link projects, and questioned if appropriate study of benefits and risks to environment and ecology has been completed so far. Bandyopadhyay et al. claim there are knowledge gaps between the claimed benefits and potential threats from environment and ecological impact. They also question whether the inter-linking project will deliver the benefits of flood control. Vaidyanathan claimed, in 2003, that there are uncertainty and unknowns about operations, how much water will be shifted and when, whether this may cause waterlogging, salinisation and the resulting desertification in the command areas of these projects. Other scholars have asked whether there are other technologies to address the cycle of droughts and flood <b>havocs,</b> <b>with</b> less uncertainties about potential environmental and ecological impact..rivers may change their courses for every or approximately for 100 years, so interlink of rivers may not be useful after 100 years.Interlinking may also leads to deforestation.so interlinking may causes ecological indifferences in ecology.|$|R
25|$|Upon his return, Bagwell {{attempted}} {{to win the}} World Tag Team Title with Douglas once more, but was unsuccessful. Bagwell, now with Torrie Wilson by his side, wrestled Douglas at Bash at the Beach, but lost when Wilson distracted him and sided with Douglas. Bagwell then began a feud with Chris Kanyon, who began stalking him and harassing Bagwell's mother Judy as a psychological tactic. Bagwell eventually defeated Kanyon in a match where Judy was suspended from a forklift. He rescued his mother despite the surprise interference of actor David Arquette. In August 2000, David Flair's storyline girlfriend Miss Hancock mysteriously became pregnant.

Although Bagwell was victorious, Flair managed to get his blood sample when Bagwell's nemesis Lex Luger attacked him after the match.

As grounds crew and even the league's top two executives tried to clear snow from the field, the rival coaches argued with the league officials and the referees about whether to play the match. United's coach Olsen was adamant that they should play, but after a delay of 45 minutes, the league finally decided to postpone the match by a day. Fewer D.C. United supporters were available to make the trip back up the highway the next day, but those who did were rewarded with a victory that would become legend.|$|E
