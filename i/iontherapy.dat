However, repeated injections^ of penicillin directly into the inflamed or indurated skin lesions before abscess has been formed may cause patients considerable pain. If high concentration of penicillin required for effective treatment were to be maintained at the inflamed lesions be administering it indirectly, high units of {{it would have to be}} given. This would involve a waste of money and material, and microorganisms acquiring resistance to it would pose a serious problem. By using iontophoresis, the author has succeeded in eliminating these obstacles to the use of penicillin {{for the treatment of}} supprative diseases, and has achieved good results in the treatment of 700 cases of various kinds of surgical supprative diseases. The method and results of treatment are summarized as follows : (1) Employing an apparatus designed for <b>iontherapy,</b> the treatment makes it possible to introduce desired amounts of penicillin into the inflamed lesions without causing pain or having side-actions. (2) Required concentration of penicllin was maintained in the lesions of hot abscess 1 hour after 10, 000 units of it had been introduced bypassing an electric current of 1 ma. for 10 minutes. Animal experiments in rabbits revealed similar results. (3) Penicillin introduced into the lesions of abscess maintained a high concentration for a long time: it remained at 1. 46 Î¼/cc. 24 hours after introduction. Minute amounts of penicllin detected in blood may show that its absorption is a very slow process. (4) Two or three courses of treatment usually resulted in marked subsiding of symptoms. After five or six courses, microorganisms causing infection ceased to be detected in the skin lesions...|$|E
