5000|$|A {{number of}} studies have {{predicted}} that automation will take a large proportion of <b>jobs</b> in the future, but estimates of the level of unemployment this will cause vary. Research by the Oxford Martin School showed that employees engaged in [...] "tasks following well-defined procedures that can easily be performed by sophisticated algorithms" [...] are at risk of displacement. The study, published in 2013, shows that automation can affect both skilled and unskilled work and both high and low-paying occupations; however, low-paid physical occupations are most at risk. It estimated that 47% of US <b>jobs</b> were at high risk of automation. In 2014, the economic think tank Bruegel released a study claiming that across the European Union's 28 member states, 54% of <b>jobs</b> were at risk of automation. The countries where <b>jobs</b> were least vulnerable to automation were Sweden, with 46.69% of <b>jobs</b> vulnerable, the UK at 47.17%, the Netherlands at 49.50%, and France and Denmark, both at 49.54%. The countries where <b>jobs</b> were found to be most vulnerable were Romania at 61.93%, Portugal at 58.94%, Croatia at 57.9%, and Bulgaria at 56.56%. A 2015 report by the Taub Center found that 41% of <b>jobs</b> in Israel were at risk of being automated within the next two decades. In January 2016, a joint study by the Oxford Martin School and Citibank, based on previous studies on automation and data from the World Bank, found that the risk of automation in developing countries was much higher than in developed countries. It found that 77% of <b>jobs</b> in China, 69% of <b>jobs</b> in India, 85% of <b>jobs</b> in Ethiopia, and 55% of <b>jobs</b> in Uzbekistan were at risk of automation. A 2016 study by the International Labour Organization found 74% of salaried <b>jobs</b> in Thailand, 75% of salaried <b>jobs</b> in Vietnam, 63% of salaried <b>jobs</b> in Indonesia, and 81% of salaried <b>jobs</b> in the Philippines were at high risk of automation. A 2016 United Nations report stated that 75% of <b>jobs</b> in the developing world were at risk of automation, and predicts that more <b>jobs</b> might be lost when corporations stop outsourcing to developing countries after automation in industrialized countries makes it less lucrative to outsource to countries with lower labor costs. The Council of Economic Advisers, a US government agency tasked with providing economic research for the White House, in the 2016 Economic Report of the President, estimated that 83% of <b>jobs</b> with an hourly wage below $20, 31% of <b>jobs</b> with an hourly wage between $20 and $40, and 4% of <b>jobs</b> with an hourly wage above $40 were at risk of automation. A 2016 study by Ryerson University found that 42% of <b>jobs</b> in Canada were at risk of automation, dividing them into two categories - [...] "high risk" [...] <b>jobs</b> and [...] "low risk" [...] <b>jobs.</b> High risk <b>jobs</b> were mainly lower-income <b>jobs</b> that required lower education levels than average. Low risk <b>jobs</b> were on average more skilled positions. The report found a 70% chance that high risk <b>jobs</b> and a 30% chance that low risk <b>jobs</b> would be affected by automation in the next 10-20 years. A 2017 study by PricewaterhouseCoopers found that up to 38% of <b>jobs</b> in the US, 35% of <b>jobs</b> in Germany, 30% of <b>jobs</b> in the UK, and 21% of <b>jobs</b> in Japan were at high risk of being automated by the early 2030s.
