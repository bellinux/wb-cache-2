5|$|In March 2016, it was {{revealed}} that Anderson was <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> TNA for failing an on-the-spot drug test at an Impact Wrestling taping.|$|E
5|$|In testing done by Houston Police Department SWAT, the SS190 <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> the P90 into bare {{ballistic}} gelatin exhibited penetration depths {{ranging from}} 28 to 34cm (11 to 13.5in). In testing in 1999 by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), the SS190 <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> the P90 {{at a distance}} of 25m (27yd) exhibited an average penetration depth of 25cm (9.85in) in ballistic gelatin after passing through a Level II Kevlar vest.|$|E
5|$|On 6 April 2011, it was {{reported}} that a AASM missile <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> a Dassault Rafale was used to destroy a Libyan tank at a range of 55km.|$|E
50|$|All {{this had}} to be done under <b>fire</b> <b>from</b> {{buildings}} on the seafront, and under mortar and artillery <b>fire</b> <b>from</b> further inland.|$|R
50|$|A close {{examination}} of the trial transcript and the most reasonable interpretation of the evidence is that Davis killed Grimm while <b>firing</b> <b>from</b> the Avalon Hotel; McElfresh {{was killed by a}} Wobbly <b>firing</b> <b>from</b> the IWW hall, and that Cassagranda was killed while running west on Second Avenue by a revolver probably fired by Davis <b>firing</b> <b>from</b> the Avalon Hotel.|$|R
50|$|At 3:00 AM, ten USAF F-117 Nighthawk stealth bombers, {{under the}} {{protection}} of a three-ship formation of EF-111s, bombed Baghdad, the capital. The striking force came under <b>fire</b> <b>from</b> 3,000 anti-aircraft guns <b>firing</b> <b>from</b> rooftops in Baghdad.|$|R
5|$|When <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> the FN P90, the 5.7×28mm SS190 can {{penetrate}} the NATO CRISAT vest or a Level IIIA Kevlar vest {{at a range}} of 200 m (219 yd).|$|E
5|$|A minor Army-Air Force fight {{then broke}} out about what targets {{would be used}} for the Kwajalein tests. The Army favored using its Jupiter design, <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> Johnston Atoll in the Pacific, while the Air Force {{recommended}} using Atlas <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> Vandenberg AFB in California. The Army had already begun converting the former Thor launchers to Jupiter when an Ad Hoc Panel formed by the Department of Defense considered the issue. On 26 May 1960 they decided in favor of Atlas, and this was made official on 29 June when the Secretary of Defense ended pad conversion and additional Jupiter production earmarked for Zeus testing.|$|E
5|$|According to FN, the 5.7×28mm {{cartridge}} has {{an effective}} range of 200m (219yd) {{and a maximum}} range of 1,800m (1,969yd) when <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> the P90, and an effective range of 50m (55yd) and a maximum range of 1,510m (1,651yd) when <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> the Five-seven. In testing, the SS190 and similar 5.7×28mm projectiles consistently turn base over point ("tumble") as they pass through ballistic gelatin and other media, using the 21.6-mm (.85in) projectile length to create a larger wound cavity. However, some are skeptical of the bullet's terminal performance, {{and it is a}} subject of debate among civilian shooters in the United States.|$|E
50|$|After all reports {{had been}} submitted, {{the attacks on}} the two allied {{warships}} were attributed to friendly <b>fire</b> <b>from</b> US fixed-wing aircraft. The attacks on PCF-19 and PCF-12 were also attributed to friendly <b>fire</b> <b>from</b> these aircraft.|$|R
50|$|The RAK is a selective-fire {{straight}} blowback-operated {{weapon that}} <b>fires</b> <b>from</b> the open bolt position. Unlike most submachine guns <b>firing</b> <b>from</b> an open bolt, the PM-63 has a reciprocating external breech bolt, {{also known as}} a slide.|$|R
25|$|A UN Board of Inquiry {{found that}} there was no <b>firing</b> <b>from</b> within the school and no {{explosives}} within the school. The Board could not establish with certainty whether there had been any <b>firing</b> <b>from</b> the vicinity of the school.|$|R
5|$|After {{signing with}} WWE, Anderson made his debut on the SmackDown! roster in August 2005. In September 2006, he {{captured}} {{his first and}} only title with the company, the United States Championship, and would {{hold on to it}} for a month. The following year at WrestleMania 23, Anderson won the annual Money in the Bank ladder match, a contract, which guarantees a match for one of WWE's then three world level championships. He was <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> WWE on May 29, 2009. He returned to the independent circuit before signing a contract with TNA in 2010, which he was <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> TNA in 2016 and would return to the independent circuit for a second time. He opened a wrestling school called The Academy in Minneapolis, Minnesota in late 2016 along with Shawn Daivari, Molly Holly, Ariya Daivari, and Arik Cannon.|$|E
5|$|Based on the M-13, the M-30 rocket was {{developed}} in 1942. Its bulbous warhead required it to be <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> a grounded frame, called the M-30 (single frame, four round; later double frame, 8 round), instead of a launch rail mounted on a truck. In 1944 it {{became the basis for}} the BM-31-12 truck-mounted launcher.|$|E
5|$|Before {{he retired}} from {{professional}} baseball, Heath appeared in 57 games for the Seattle Rainiers of the Pacific Coast League. He was later <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> the team. In 1951, {{he was given a}} trial basis with the Rainiers but was never signed.|$|E
5000|$|On 2 February 1813, after {{a two-hour}} chase, the boats of the 18-gun sloop [...] {{captured}} one trabaccoló and ran nine ashore at St. Catherine's, Corfu. Musket <b>fire</b> <b>from</b> the heights and cannon <b>fire</b> <b>from</b> a battery killed two British sailors and severely wounded seven.|$|R
2500|$|The highest {{grade of}} fire is the Atash Behram, [...] "Fire of victory", and its {{establishment}} and consecration {{is the most}} elaborate of the three. It involves the gathering of 16 different [...] "kinds of fire", that is, <b>fires</b> gathered <b>from</b> 16 different sources, including lightning, <b>fire</b> <b>from</b> a cremation pyre, <b>fire</b> <b>from</b> trades where a furnace is operated, and <b>fires</b> <b>from</b> the hearths as {{is also the case}} for the Atash Adaran. Each of the 16 fires is then subject to a purification ritual before it joins the others. 32 priests are required for the consecration ceremony, which can take up to a year to complete.|$|R
5000|$|Chambered for the [...]357 Magnum, 9mm Parabellum, [...]40 S&W, or 9×21mm {{cartridges}} {{its most}} distinctive feature {{is that the}} barrel is on a low axis compared to other revolvers. The Rhino <b>fires</b> <b>from</b> the lowermost chamber of the cylinder, rather than <b>firing</b> <b>from</b> the topmost chamber.|$|R
5|$|Clouzot was {{an early}} fan of the cinema and, {{desiring}} {{a career as a}} writer, moved to Paris. He was later hired by producer Adolphe Osso to work in Berlin, writing French-language versions of German films. After being <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> German studios due to his friendship with Jewish producers, Clouzot returned to France, where he spent years bedridden after contracting tuberculosis. Upon recovering, Clouzot found work in Nazi occupied France as a screenwriter for the German-owned company Continental Films. At Continental, Clouzot wrote and directed films that were very popular in France. His second film Le Corbeau drew controversy over its harsh look at provincial France and Clouzot was <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> Continental before its release. As a result of his association with Continental, Clouzot was barred by the French government from filmmaking until 1947.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the third}} match, Larry Zybysko {{revealed}} that Raven's opponent {{for the night}} was Sean Waltman. The two then fought in a No Disqualification match with the stipulation that if Raven won he gained a future NWA World Heavyweight Championship match, but if he lost he would be <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> TNA. During the bout, the referee was knocked out with Zbyszko taking over his duties. Waltman won the contest after forcing Raven face-first off of a ladder through a table with his signature X-Factor maneuver. Zbyszko counted the pin despite Raven's foot on the bottom rope at 10 minutes. As {{a result of his}} loss, Raven was <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> TNA in the storyline.|$|E

2500|$|On 18 January 1953 a P2V of VP-22 {{was shot}} down off Swatow in the Formosa Straits by Chinese {{anti-aircraft}} fire. 11 of 13 crewmen were rescued by a US Coast Guard PBM-5 under <b>fire</b> <b>from</b> shore batteries on Nan Ao Tao island. Attempting to takeoff in 8 to 12-foot swell, the PBM crashed.

30|$|In addition, {{the other}} causes of {{wildland}} fires that were highlighted included <b>fire</b> <b>from</b> roadside servitudes (60  %), <b>fires</b> <b>from</b> cigarettes stubs (51  %), <b>fires</b> <b>from</b> rubbish pits and settling of land were cited by 39  % of respondents. Population increase was also {{cited as a}} major cause of wildland fires. The increase in human population in Chakari has been fuelled by continuous land allocation, particularly in areas where farmers are given virgin land. Land clearing to prepare agricultural fields causes wildland fires when fires used for land clearing get out of hand.|$|R
5|$|On 23 July 2014, two Su-25s {{were shot}} down in the Donetsk region of Ukraine. A {{spokesperson}} for the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine said the aircraft {{were shot down}} by missiles <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> Russia.|$|E
5|$|One Hot Minute was a {{commercial}} disappointment despite producing three hit singles and reaching number four on the Billboard 200 chart. It sold {{fewer than half}} as many copies as Blood Sugar Sex Magik and received much less critical acclaim. Navarro was ultimately <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> the band in 1998 due to creative differences.|$|E
5|$|The Battered Ornaments {{had been}} the backing band for Cream {{collaborator}} Pete Brown. They performed without Brown for the festival, who had been <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> the band the previous day. Guitarist Chris Spedding took over lead vocals. The band supplied the armoured personnel carrier that carried the Stones from their hotel to the park.|$|E

2500|$|The 11th Division {{attacked}} {{with one}} brigade at [...] The right flank was delayed by machine-gun <b>fire</b> <b>from</b> the 48th Division area and by pillboxes to their front, where the infantry lost the barrage. On the left, the brigade dug in [...] {{west of the}} Langemarck road and the right flank dug in facing east, against <b>fire</b> <b>from</b> Maison du Hibou and the Triangle. Supporting troops from the 33rd Brigade, were caught by <b>fire</b> <b>from</b> the German pillboxes but reached the Cockcroft, passed beyond and dug in despite <b>fire</b> <b>from</b> Bulow Farm. On the left flank, these battalions reached the Langemarck road, passed Rat House and Pheasant Trench and ended their advance {{just short of the}} White House, joining with {{the right side of the}} brigade on the Lekkerboterbeek.|$|R

5|$|The M249 LMG entered {{service in}} 1984 as the M249 SAW. Initial {{reactions}} to the gun were mixed: it fulfilled the light machine gun role well when <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> the ground, but was not as effective when <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> the shoulder or hip. It was praised for its extreme durability and massive firepower, though {{a number of areas}} for improvement were highlighted: the blank firing attachment fitted poorly, the bipod was very weak and broke easily, the sling attachment was awkward, and there were many slots and gaps that accumulated dirt. Some claimed that the heavy-barrelled version of the M16 rifle was a more effective light machine gun.|$|E
5|$|The M4 was {{developed}} to meet the need for a specialized mortar carrier based on the M2 Half Track Car, which the M21 soon replaced. The initial M4 was designed to carry a mortar. In emergencies, the mortar could be <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> the vehicle. The improved M4A1 had a reinforced floor so that the mortar could be <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> the vehicle, but the mounting faced to the rear and lacked traverse. This caused problems when the troops who operated the mortar mounted the vehicle, so the US 2nd Armored Division relocated the mortars so that they could fire from the front.|$|E
5|$|The SS196SR was {{introduced}} in 2005 {{and it is now}} discontinued in favor of the SS197SR cartridge. It featured a lead core 2.6-g (40grain) Hornady V-Max bullet which it propelled at a muzzle velocity of roughly 500m/s (1,650ft/s) when <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> the Five-seven. The polycarbonate tip used in the V-Max bullet acted as a wedge, enhancing expansion of the bullet. The SS196 was classified by the ATF as not armor-piercing, and in testing by FNH USA it did not penetrate a Level II vest when <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> the Five-seven. The SS196 could be identified by its red polymer tip.|$|E
