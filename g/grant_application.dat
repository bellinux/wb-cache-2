It also receives all <b>grant</b> <b>applications</b> for NIH, {{as well as for}} some other components of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). Since 1946, its mission has remained clear and timely: to see that NIH <b>grant</b> <b>applications</b> receive fair, independent, expert, and timely reviews—free from inappropriate influences—so NIH can fund the most promising research.|$|R

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} requirements of the CHP is the submission of an honors thesis, a long-term research project. An honors thesis may be completed either through independent study with a professor or one of the 24 formal department honors programs on campus. These programs offer research seminars, <b>grant</b> <b>application</b> advising, and faculty mentor assistance, and confer department honors upon graduation. These programs, while separate from the Campuswide Honors Program, are administered by their respective academic units and open to all eligible undergraduates. However, most honors thesis candidates are CHP students.|$|E
500|$|Funding for {{the bridge}} {{remained}} incomplete during the planning process. In 2012, Sound Transit and the Seattle Department of Transportation each allocated $5 million to cover {{part of the}} $25 million cost, if the remainder could be funded by July 2015. A federal Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) <b>grant</b> <b>application</b> in October 2015 for $15 million was not approved, but two Seattle council members asked to have the July deadline removed.

500|$|The {{citizens}} of Oregon {{were faced with}} a dilemma in 1905: either allow Oregon's library to remain, truly, Oregon's city library, or, by referendum, allow Oregon's library to make the shift into a township library. This change would allow the library one distinct advantage; it would qualify the library for a grant from Andrew Carnegie {{for the construction of}} a new building. Initially, Carnegie promised US$7,000 for the new library but once voters approved the change the grant amount was increased to $10,000. The grant, aside from requiring the library to hold [...] "township library" [...] status, required a site to be selected prior to the <b>grant</b> <b>application</b> process; a site, at the corner of Oregon's Jefferson and Third Streets, was selected.|$|E
500|$|By mid-October 2013, McConnell's {{campaign}} {{indicated it}} would look beyond Bevin and focus its advertising against Allison Lundergan Grimes, the frontrunner {{in the race for}} the Democratic senatorial nomination, calling her [...] "my real opponent". In the aftermath of McConnell negotiating a deal to end the 16-day government shutdown in 2013, the Senate Conservatives Fund endorsed Bevin. McConnell's campaign then launched another ad, based on a story published by BuzzFeed, claiming Bevin had failed to disclose a federal tax lien when applying for the state grant to rebuild his family business, which could be a Class A misdemeanor, punishable by up to a year in jail and a $2,000 fine under Connecticut law. Bevin said that he had been paying the lien in $5,000 installments prior to the fire that destroyed the business, a condition he said was allowed by the <b>grant</b> <b>application,</b> but after the fire, the Internal Revenue Service suspended the payments. Bevin was never charged. Lexington Herald-Leader columnist Sam Youngman speculated that McConnell's pivot back to Bevin was a proxy war against Tea Party fundraising groups, hoping that a decisive win over their chosen candidate in the primary would hamper the groups' fundraising in future elections.|$|E
500|$|In July 1966 Roberts & Vinter's distributor, Thorpe & Porter, went bankrupt, owing Roberts & Vinter a {{substantial}} sum. The resulting financial pressure led Roberts & Vinter {{to focus on}} their more profitable magazines, and they made plans to close down both Science Fantasy and New Worlds. [...] After hearing of these plans, Moorcock and Warburton began to consider forming a separate company to continue publishing New Worlds, and Brian Aldiss contacted well-known literary figures such as J.B. Priestley, Kingsley Amis, Marghanita Laski, and Angus Wilson to gain support for an application for {{a grant from the}} British Arts Council in late 1966. [...] In early January 1967 Aldiss discovered that the <b>grant</b> <b>application</b> would be successful, and that New Worlds would be awarded £150 per issue, though in the event the formal grant certification was delayed until at least May. [...] The grant was enough to enable the magazine to continue, though it would not cover all costs. [...] A publisher still needed to be found, and both Fontana and Panther Books expressed an interest, but the promise of the money and the prestige of an Arts Council grant convinced Warburton to stay involved personally. [...] While these negotiations were going on, two more issues were assembled from backfile material and donated stories. [...] Roberts & Vinter had ceased to exist by this time, so a sister company, Gold Star Publications, became the publisher for both these issues, with Warburton and Aldiss providing Gold Star with personal financial guarantees. [...] These two issues appeared in March and April 1967, but the latter was mistakenly also dated March in the indicia. [...] Science Fantasy, which by this time had been retitled SF Impulse, was not continued but was merged with New Worlds as of the first Gold Star issue, though nothing of SF Impulses design or content was visible in New Worlds.|$|E

40|$|Many {{scientists}} {{engaged in}} research today are faced in their professional lives with having to write <b>grant</b> <b>applications.</b> Although highly skilled {{in their field}} of research, many of these researchers have had little training {{in some of the}} skills needed for this sometimes seemingly daunting task. Such short-comings can present a significant barrier to career advancement. At {{the top of the list}} is training in writing – in particular, expository writing. The result is that scientists often fail to communicate accu-rately, clearly and convincingly to their readers, who – in the case of <b>grant</b> <b>applications</b> – are the re-viewers.

2500|$|Through a {{grant from}} the American Council of Learned Societies, Lomax was able to set out in June 1933 on the first {{recording}} expedition under the Library's auspices, with Alan Lomax (then eighteen years old) in tow. As now, a disproportionate percentage of African American males were held as prisoners. Robert Winslow Gordon, Lomax's predecessor at the Library of Congress, had written (in an article in the New York Times, c. 1926) that, [...] "Nearly every type of song {{is to be found in}} our prisons and penitentiaries" [...] Folklorists Howard Odum and Guy Johnson also had observed that, [...] "If one wishes to obtain anything like an accurate picture of the workaday Negro he will surely find his best setting in the chain gang, prison, or in the situation of the ever-fleeing fugitive." [...] But what these folklorists had merely recommended John and Alan Lomax were able to put into practice. In their successful <b>grant</b> <b>application</b> they wrote, following Odum, Johnson and Gordon's hint, that prisoners, [...] "Thrown on their own resources for entertainment [...] [...] [...] still sing, especially the long-term prisoners who have been confined for years and who have not yet been influenced by jazz and the radio, the distinctive old-time Negro melodies." [...] They toured Texas prison farms recording work songs, reels, ballads, and blues from prisoners such as James [...] "Iron Head" [...] Baker, Mose [...] "Clear Rock" [...] Platt, and Lightnin' Washington. By no means were all of those whom the Lomaxes recorded imprisoned, however: in other communities, they recorded K.C. Gallaway and Henry Truvillion.|$|E
