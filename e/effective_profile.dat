40|$|A {{form of the}} linear, {{inviscid}} {{shallow water}} wave equation which includes alongshore uniform, but cross-shore variable, longshore currents and bathymetry is presented. This formulation provides a continuum between gravity waves (either leaky or edge waves) on a longshore current, and the recently discovered shear waves. In this paper we will concentrate on gravity wave solutions for which V(x) /c < 1, where V(x) is the longshore current, and c is the edge wave celerity. The effects of the current can be uniquely accounted for {{in terms of a}} modification to the true beach profile, h ' (x) = h(x) [1 - V(x) /c]- 2, where h(x) is the true profile and h'(x) is the <b>effective</b> <b>profile.</b> This is particularly useful in conceptualizing the combined effects of longshore currents and variable bottom topography. We have solved numerically for the dispersion relationship and the cross-shore shapes of edge waves on a plane beach under a range of current conditions. Changes to the edge wave alongshore wavenumber, K, of over 50 % are found for reasonable current profiles, showing that the departure from plane beach dispersion due to longshore currents can be of the same order as the effect of introducing nonplanar topography. These changes are not symmetric as they are for profile changes; increases for edge waves opposing the current flow (a shallower <b>effective</b> <b>profile),</b> but decreases for those coincident with the flow (a deeper <b>effective</b> <b>profile).</b> The cross-shore structure of the edge wave...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the photon-trapping {{effects in the}} super-critical black hole accretion flows by solving radiation transfer {{as well as the}} energy equations of radiation and gas. It is found that the slim-disk model generally overestimates the luminosity of the disk at around the Eddington luminosity (L_E) and is not accurate in describing the <b>effective</b> temperature <b>profile,</b> since it neglects time delay between energy generation at deeper inside the disk and energy release at the surface. Especially, the photon-trapping effects are appreciable even below L ~ L_E, while they appear above ~ 3 L_E according to the slim disk. Through the photon-trapping effects, the luminosity is reduced and the <b>effective</b> temperature <b>profile</b> becomes flatter than r^{- 3 / 4 } as in the standard disk. In the case that the viscous heating is effective only around the equatorial plane, the luminosity is kept around the Eddington luminosity even at very large mass accretion rate, Mdot>>L_E/c^ 2. The <b>effective</b> temperature <b>profile</b> is almost flat, and the maximum temperature decreases in accordance with rise in the mass accretion rate. Thus, the most luminous radius shifts to the outer region when Mdot/(L_E/c^ 2) >> 10 ^ 2. In the case that the energy is dissipated equally at any heights, the resultant luminosity is somewhat larger than in the former case, but the energy-conversion efficiency still decreases with increase of the mass accretion rate, as well. The most luminous radius stays around the inner edge of the disk in the latter case. Hence, the <b>effective</b> temperature <b>profile</b> is sensitive to the vertical distribution of energy production rates, so is the spectral shape. Future observations of high L/L_E objects will be able to test our model. Comment: 10 pages, 7 figures, accepted for publication in Ap...|$|R

Although treatment is not necessary, many patients with facial PUL seek medical help for cosmetic reasons. There is no established standard treatment for PUL.

To resolve this paradox, the perceived sharpness of drifting, blurred, square wave gratings was {{compared with that}} of their static analogues over a range of speeds, blurs and spatial frequencies. Both motion blur and motion sharpening occurred, depending upon the physical blur of the patterns. For large extents of blur (> 10 min arc) moving patterns always appeared sharper than their static analogues, but for small blurs (< 10 min arc) moving edges appeared more blurred than stationary ones. We present a quantitative model for the distortion of waveforms in motion based on two factors: (i) visual temporal integration that smears moving images, and (ii) a local contrast non-linearity that increasingly sharpens the <b>effective</b> <b>profile</b> of edges as speed and contrast increase.

Time-aware Recommender Systems (TARS) focus on temporal context of ratings in order to track the evolution of user preferences and to adapt suggestions accordingly.

Electro-osmosis is a phenomenon where external electric fields induce flow in fluids that are in contact with charged surfaces.

In addition to pulling in millions of everyday users, Twitter attracts strategic communicators aiming to forge personal bonds with users. Strategic communicators face a dilemma in creating Twitter profiles online, as the features of an <b>effective</b> <b>profile</b> are not well-researched, particularly for spokespersons representing a brand or organization. Using a 2 (network size) x 2 (gender) mixed design experiment, this study investigates how a profile's social network size and gender influence social judgments of that profile's social attractiveness and credibility. Despite significant findings of similar experiments exploring other social media, this experiment had few significant results. Likely this is explained by the participants' lack of experience with Twitter, which might have prevented them from judging and understanding profile cues as Twitter users would. However, there was a significant interaction found on Competence (a factor of credibility) for profile gender and participants' prior Twitter use - namely, that prior users found the male profiles more competent, while nonusers found female profiles more competent. This does perhaps indicate that Twitter users learn to judge certain profile cues differently from nonusers, and that gender plays a role in those cues...|$|E

The results of these tests, made at UC-Berkeley indicated that, with four cutting wheels, as included in the tool design presented in the Fourth Quarterly Report, the total force required was nearly 60, 000 lb. In view of the limited tool diameter, the creation of such a large force with a single piston required a hydraulic pressure which would exceed the capability of the Triplex pump, most commonly available in the oil fields. A re-design of the 4 -wheel slot-cutting tool with two tandem pistons was done, but revealed a high degree of complexity, related to the difficulty of providing a high-pressure fluid path in the thin housing wall from the hydraulic cylinder above the first pair of arms to a cylinder for the tandem piston located below the first pair of cutter arms and operating the second pair of arms. By reducing the number of cutting wheels from 4 to 3 a single piston driver was sufficient and could result in a tool much simpler to build and to maintain in the Field.

40|$|This paper {{critically}} interrogates and re-evaluates {{the notion}} that it is somehow difficult being a man in nursing and suggests some ways forward which will allow us to gain a more politically astute purchase on gender, nursing and the socio-political context in which the profession operates. Men appear to be well served by a career in nursing. Despite their lesser numbers they are likely to earn more and be promoted into leadership roles more readily. Yet there is a pervasive sense in the literature on men in nursing that they feel unhappy as a minority in a predominantly female occupation and feel a disjuncture between masculine identity and the nursing role. The genealogy of this idea can be traced to a more extensive literature in the ‘men’s movement’, in sex role theory and masculinity studies which has tended to focus on the putative hurts that men suffer as they are socialized into the male role. This is itself informed by experiences and discourses from therapy, and privileges these kinds of experiences over and above more sober consideration of the respective powers of men and women and the sociopolitical context of the profession. This ‘poor me ’ discourse deflects attention away from the business of tackling material inequalities and enables men to encroach further into the agenda of nursing discussions. Instead, a view {{of men and women in}} nursing is proposed which is attentive to the historical and political operations of power and which sees subjective experiences as the effects of power rather than as a starting point for analysis. We must place individual experience coherently and exhaustively in the material environment of social space and time.

There are several aspects of this project that make it unique. First, every e-book that is selected by a PDA-preferred profile will automatically be loaded into the catalogue for PDA. Patrons will trigger a purchase if the book is accessed twice. Second, duplication is avoided because our holdings are sent to Coutts on a weekly basis. Third, the PDA program has been implemented across all collections areas at the University. And fourth, if a title is offered in both print and electronic, our default selection is for the electronic. The first objective {{of this paper is}} to describe the Western Libraries journey from PDA trials to a system wide e-preferred PDA program. The second objective {{of this paper is to}} present our assessment strategy and outcomes of this collaborative project with Coutts...|$|R
40|$|In a {{previous}} work, an operative procedure to estimate precipitable and liquid water in non-raining conditions over sea {{was developed and}} assessed. The procedure {{is based on a}} fast non-linear physical inversion scheme and a forward model; it is valid for most of satellite microwave radiometers and it also estimates water <b>effective</b> <b>profiles.</b> This paper presents two improvements of the procedure: first, a refinement to provide modularity of the software components and portability across different computation system architectures; second, the adoption of the CERN MINUIT minimisation package, which addresses the problem of global minimisation but is computationally more demanding. Together with the increased computational performance that allowed to impose stricter requirements on the quality of fit, these refinements improved fitting precision and reliability, and allowed to relax the requirements on the initial guesses for the model parameters. The re-analysis of the same data-set considered in the previous papers showed an improvement of the consistency of the estimates from SSM/I and TMI radiometers and of the agreement with the statistical references. The described work confirmed the stability of the overall approach of the operative Procedure and prepared for new satellite generations (e. g. AMSR-E) ...|$|R
40|$|A {{composite}} rheology {{is employed}} consisting of both linear and nonlinear creep mechanisms which are {{connected by a}} 'transition' stress. Background stress due to geodynamical processes is included. For models with a non-Newtonian upper-mantle overlying a Newtonian lower-mantle, the temporal responses of the displacements can reproduce those of Newtonian models. The average <b>effective</b> viscosity <b>profile</b> under the ice-load {{at the end of}} deglaciation {{turns out to be the}} crucial factor governing mantle relaxation. This can explain why simple Newtonian rheology has been successful in fitting the uplift data over formerly glaciated regions...|$|R
