Methods A total of 432 32 -wk-old laying hens were randomly divided into 6 treatments with 6 replicates of 12 birds each. The birds were fed diets containing SBM, LCSM 100, <b>or</b> <b>DRM</b> 100 individually <b>or</b> in combination with an equal amount of crude protein (CP) (LCSM 50, DRM 50, and LCSM 50 -DRM 50). The experimental diets, which were isocaloric (metabolizable energy, 11. 11 MJ/kg) and isonitrogenous (CP, 16. 5 %), had similar digestible amino acid profile. The feeding trial lasted 12 weeks. Results The daily egg mass was decreased in the LCSM 100 and LCSM 50 -DRM 50 groups (p 0. 05) and showed increased yolk color {{at the end of the}} trial (p 0. 05). Conclusion Together, our results suggest that the LCSM 100 <b>or</b> <b>DRM</b> 100 diets may produce the adverse effects on laying performance and egg quality after feeding for 8 more weeks.

40|$|Immune-mediated drug {{hypersensitivity}} reactions (IDHR) {{may result}} from immuno-sensitization to a drug-induced neo-antigen. They rarely occur in patients and are usually not predicted preclinically using standard toxicity studies. To assess the potential of a drug to induce T-cell sensitization, trinitrophenyl (TNP) -Ficoll was used here as a bystander antigen in animal experiments. TNP-Ficoll will only elicit TNP-specific IgG antibodies {{in the presence of}} non-cognate T-cell help. Therefore, the presence of TNP-specific IgG antibodies after co-injection of drug and TNP-Ficoll was indicative of T-cell sensitization potential. This TNP-Ficoll-approach was used here to characterize T-cell help induced by oral exposure to diclofenac (<b>DF)</b> <b>or</b> carbamazepine (CMZ). <b>DF</b> <b>or</b> CMZ was administered orally to BALB/c mice and after 3 w, the mice were challenged in a hind paw with TNP-Ficoll and a dose of the drug that by itself does only elicit a sub-optimal popliteal lymph node assay (PLNA) response. T-cell-dependent responses were then evaluated in paw-draining popliteal lymph nodes (PLN). Also, shortly after oral exposure, mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) were excised for evaluation of local responses. Both drugs were able to increase PLN cellularity and TNP-specific IgG 1 production after challenge. Both DF and CMZ stimulated CD 4 (+[*]) and CD 8 (+) T-cells and caused shifts of the subsets toward an effector phenotype. DF, but not CMZ, appeared to stimulate interferon (IFN) -γ production. Remarkably, depletion of CD 8 (+), but not CD 4 (+), T-cells reduced TNP-specific IgG 1 production, and was more pronounced in CMZ- than in DF-exposed animals. Local responses in the MLN caused by <b>DF</b> <b>or</b> CMZ also showed shifts of CD 4 (+[*]) and CD 8 (+) -cells toward a memory phenotype. Together, the data indicate that oral exposure to CMZ and DF differentially induced neo-antigen-specific T-cell reactions in the PLNA...|$|R

40|$|AbstractNotch {{signaling}} controls {{formation of}} joints at leg segment borders {{and growth of}} the developing Drosophila leg. Here, we identify the odd-skipped gene family as a key group of genes that function downstream of the Notch receptor to promote morphological changes associated with joint formation during leg development. odd, sob, drm, and bowl are expressed in a segmental pattern in the developing leg, and their expression is regulated by Notch signaling. Ectopic expression of odd, sob, <b>or</b> <b>drm</b> can induce invaginations in the leg disc epithelium and morphological changes in the adult leg that are characteristic of endogenous invaginating joint cells. These effects are not due to an alteration in the expression of other genes of the developing joint. While odd <b>or</b> <b>drm</b> mutant clones do not affect leg segmentation, and thus appear to act redundantly, bowl mutant clones do perturb leg development. Specifically, bowl mutant clones result in a failure of joint formation from the distal tibia to tarsal segment 5, while more proximal clones cause melanotic protrusions from the leg cuticle. Together, {{these results indicate that}} the odd-skipped family of genes mediates Notch function during leg development by promoting a specific aspect of joint formation, an epithelial invagination. As the odd-skipped family genes are involved in regulating cellular morphogenesis during both embryonic segmentation and hindgut development, we suggest that they may be required in multiple developmental contexts to induce epithelial cellular changes...|$|R
