5|$|In 1956, {{the test}} program was {{transferred}} to Fort Eustis, Virginia, where Captain Selmer Sundby took over test-flying duties. The HZ-1 had been designed to be very easy to fly, and early testing indicated that untrained soldiers could learn to operate the craft in less than 20 minutes, and some claiming that only five minutes of instruction were required. In addition, the HZ-1 proved to be faster than other flying platform designs evaluated by the Army. Sundby, however, quickly determined that the craft was {{much more difficult to}} fly than had been expected, and would not be safe {{in the hands of an}} inexperienced pilot. In addition, the low-mounted rotors proved to be prone to <b>kicking</b> <b>up</b> small rocks and other debris.|$|E

25|$|Gravano's {{success was}} not without a downside. First, his quick rise up the Gambino {{hierarchy}} {{attracted the attention of}} the FBI, and he was soon placed under surveillance. Second, he started to sense some jealousy from Gotti over the profitability of his legitimate business interests. Nevertheless, Gravano claimed to be <b>kicking</b> <b>up</b> over $2million each year to Gotti out of his union activities alone.|$|E
25|$|During snowfalls when {{temperatures}} hover {{close to}} freezing, northern {{parts of the}} city, such as around Derry Road away from warmer Lake Ontario usually get more snow that sticks to the ground because of the lower temperatures. The reverse occurs when a strong storm approaches from the south <b>kicking</b> <b>up</b> lake effect snow, bringing higher snowfall totals to south Mississauga. The city usually experiences 6 months of snow free weather however there is the odd occurrence where snow does fall either in October or May.

500|$|Ivan Kreilkamp of Spin {{gave the}} album an {{eight out of}} ten. The review said that the album is [...] "as {{sprawling}} and generous-spirited as Superunknown, but... is a looser and live-er-sounding affair, not seeking {{the same level of}} aural precision". Alternative Press gave the album a three out of five. The review said that Soundgarden are [...] "now fully capable of penning some damned spiffy pop songs", and added that [...] "they sound more human here, like they're playing in your living room". Rolling Stone staff writer David Fricke gave Down on the Upside three out of five stars, observing that the album has [...] "some quality frenzy", but criticizing it for [...] "lack defining episodes of catharsis". Fricke said, [...] "Soundgarden seem to be digging in their heels rather than <b>kicking</b> <b>up</b> dirt, relying too much on drone-y impressionism and clever (as opposed to cleaving) guitar motifs." [...] Neil Strauss of The New York Times called the album the [...] "rawer, looser follow-up to Superunknown." [...] He added, [...] "Generally, identifying with animals in song lyrics is a sign of low self-esteem, and Soundgarden is no exception. For all the virility and macho power that rock singers have tried to wring from the , Soundgarden remains more interested in {{the fact that it is}} the only animal cursed to spend its days slithering on the ground." ...|$|E

2500|$|After his release, Paige {{played for}} several Mobile semi-pro teams. He joined the semi-pro Mobile Tigers where his brother Wilson was already pitching. He also pitched for a semi-pro team named the Down the Bay Boys, and he {{recalled}} that he once got into a jam {{in the ninth inning}} of a 1–0 ballgame when his teammates made three consecutive errors, loading the bases for the other team with two outs. Angry, Paige said he stomped around the mound, <b>kicking</b> <b>up</b> dirt. The fans started booing him, so he decided that [...] "somebody {{was going to have to}} be showed up for that." [...] He called in his outfielders and had them sit down in the infield. With the fans and his own teammates howling, Paige struck out the final batter, winning the game.|$|E

2500|$|In a seeming anachronism, the {{painting}} shows sheep being shorn with blade shears {{rather than the}} machine shears which started to enter Australian shearing sheds in the late 1880s. Art historian Terry Smith's suggestion that Roberts presented a deliberately historical vision of shearing has been questioned on account of there being no evidence that electric shears had been introduced to [...] "Brocklesby" [...] {{at the time of}} {{the painting}}'s composition. The young man carrying the fleece on the left of the painting alludes to the figure of Esau in Ghiberti's Gates of Paradise at the Florence Baptistery. The model for the smiling tar-boy at the centre of the picture, the only figure to make eye contact with the viewer, was actually a girl, 9-year-old Susan Bourne, who lived until 1979. She also assisted Roberts by <b>kicking</b> <b>up</b> dust in the shed to allow him to capture some of the atmosphere.|$|E
