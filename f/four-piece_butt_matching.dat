40|$|Pachycephalosaurids are small, herbivorous dinosaurs with domed skulls {{formed by}} massive {{thickening}} of the cranial roof. The {{function of the}} dome has been a focus of debate: the dome has variously been interpreted {{as the product of}} sexual selection, as an adaptation for species recognition, or as a weapon employed in intraspecific combat, where it was used in <b>butting</b> <b>matches</b> as in extant ungulates. This last hypothesis is supported by the recent identification of cranial pathologies in pachycephalosaurids, which appear to represent infections resulting from trauma. However, the frequency and distribution of pathologies have not been studied in a systematic fashion. Here, we show that pachycephalosaurids are characterized by a remarkably high incidence of cranial injury, where 22 % of specimens have lesions on the dome. Frequency of injury shows no significant difference between different genera, but flat-headed morphs (here interpreted as juveniles or females) lack lesions. Mapping of injuries onto a digitial pachycephalosaurid skull shows that although lesions are distributed across the dome, they cluster near the apex, which is consistent with the hypothesis that the dome functioned for intraspecific <b>butting</b> <b>matches...</b>|$|R
60|$|Hanging {{over the}} bloody paper with Alf looking for spicy bits instead of {{attending}} to the general public. Picture of a <b>butting</b> <b>match,</b> trying to crack their bloody skulls, one chap going for the other with his head down like a bull at a gate. And another one: Black Beast Burned in Omaha, Ga. A lot of Deadwood Dicks in slouch hats and they firing at a Sambo strung up in a tree with his tongue out and a bonfire under him. Gob, they ought to drown him in the sea after and electrocute and crucify him to make sure of their job.|$|R
50|$|Haslop {{made his}} {{first-class}} debut for Hampshire against the touring Pakistanis in the 1962 season. He took two wickets for 82 {{runs in the}} Pakistan innings. His wickets were those of wicketkeeper Imtiaz Ahmed and Ijaz <b>Butt.</b> This <b>match</b> would be Haslop's only first-class match.|$|R
25|$|<b>Butt</b> played three <b>matches</b> in the 2005 {{season for}} Scotland, taking three wickets but being expensive, before he tested {{positive}} for MDMA during a match with Somerset. He was subsequently banned from cricket for a year.|$|R
500|$|The bridge {{caught fire}} on June 16, 1996, when a {{cigarette}} <b>butt</b> or <b>match</b> ignited the wooden structure. The fire began around 2:20p.m. and burned {{for over three}} hours. The bridge was raised to an open position; but the fire badly charred a [...] section of the bridge. The bridge and Pleasure Beach was then closed. Estimates {{of the cost of}} constructing a new bridge or causeway varies between $9 million to $26 million.|$|R
5000|$|Finally {{the reel}} seat is {{attached}} to the butt end of the rod. Reel seats are typically made of aluminium or nickel-silver alloy. They come as an assembled unit or as a skeleton. A skeleton is a set of metal components that fit onto a wood or graphite core and are assembled into a complete reel seat. The advantage of the skeleton is that the designer can make or choose an insert of their choosing. Inserts are sold from a variety of materials from simple inexpensive woods to exotic hardwoods. The reel seat usually has an inside diameter significantly larger than the outside diameter of the rod blank butt forcing the rod builder to build up the <b>butt</b> to <b>match</b> the reel seat. This is usually done by simply creating rings of masking tape around the rod blank butt. The reel seat is then slipped onto the blank butt and epoxied into place.|$|R
60|$|When {{the meal}} was over, and grace had been said, the boards were removed from their trestles, and the elders drew round the small table in the window with a flagon of sack {{and a plate of}} wastel bread in their midst to {{continue}} their discussion of weighty Town Council matters. Every one was free to make holiday, and Edmund Burgess good-naturedly invited the strangers to come to Mile End, where there was to be shooting at the <b>butts,</b> and a <b>match</b> at singlestick was to come off between Kit Smallbones and another giant, who was regarded as the champion of the brewer's craft.|$|R
25|$|In October 2013, an Oklahoma {{crime lab}} began re-examining {{fingerprints}} taken from scenes of unsolved murders. In February 2014, Creek's case was reopened; examiners in an Oklahoma crime lab {{were able to}} match a thumbprint on the garbage bag concealing the body to James Paul Eaton, a 36-year-old divorced man. Eaton was nineteen {{at the time of}} the murder and lived in Palatine, Illinois, the same town as Creek. One of the men seen with Amber in early February 1997 bore a strong resemblance to Eaton. Eaton's fingerprints were not on record {{at the time of the}} murder, recorded only in 2000 after his arrest for possession of drug paraphernalia. Investigators located the suspect in Chicago, and on March 22 collected discarded cigarette <b>butts</b> to <b>match</b> his DNA to that found at the crime scene. Eaton was subsequently arrested in early April and is currently incarcerated in Racine, Wisconsin. Authorities also looked though his computer, Facebook profile and phone, as well as searching his residence for possible souvenirs from the scene, as some of Amber's belongings had been suspected to have been taken by her killer.|$|R
50|$|On 6 November 2010, the {{chairman}} of Hong Kong club South China, Steven Lo, said that the club expected Butt to sign for them {{at the end of}} the month. Butt signed for South China on 22 November. His first match was against TSW Pegasus in a 2-1 win for South China. Butt scored from a freekick during this game but also missed a penalty.He went back to the UK right after the game. He came back to Hong Kong in mid January 2011. His second match with South China was against Tai Po FC in a 0-1 defeat on 29 January 2011. Mateja Ke≈æman also debuted for South China in the same <b>match.</b> <b>Butt</b> received his first red card against rivals Kitchee in a league match which later prove to be crucial in deciding the league title. Butt left South China and returned to England in May 2011.|$|R
