40|$|BACKGROUND: The annual risk of tuberculous {{infection}} (ARTI) is a <b>key</b> <b>epidemiological</b> <b>indicator</b> of {{the extent}} of transmission in a community. Several methods have been suggested to estimate the prevalence of tuberculous infection using tuberculin skin test data. This paper explores the implications of using different methods to estimate prevalence of infection and ARTI. The effect of BCG vaccination on these estimates is also investigated. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Tuberculin surveys among school children in 16 communities in Zambia and 8 in South Africa (SA) were performed in 2005, as part of baseline data collection and for randomisation purposes of the ZAMSTAR study. Infection prevalence and ARTI estimates were calculated using five methods: different cut-offs with or without adjustments for sensitivity, the mirror method, and mixture analysis. A total of 49, 835 children were registered for the surveys, of which 25, 048 (50 %) had skin tests done and 22, 563 (90 %) of those tested were read. Infection prevalence was higher in the combined SA than Zambian communities. The mirror method resulted in the least difference of 7. 8 %, whereas that estimated by the cut-off methods varied from 12. 2 % to 17. 3 %. The ARTI in the Zambian and SA communities was between 0. 8 % and 2. 8 % and 2. 5 % and 4. 2 % respectively, depending on the method used. In the SA communities, the ARTI was higher among the younger children. BCG vaccination had little effect on these estimates. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: ARTI estimates are dependent on the calculation method used. All methods agreed that there were substantial differences in infection prevalence across the communities, with higher rates in SA. Although TB notification rates have increased over the past decades, the difference in cumulative exposure between younger and older children is less dramatic and a rise in risk of infection in parallel with the estimated incidence of active tuberculosis cannot be excluded...|$|E

40|$|The present article {{traces the}} {{evolution}} of drug epidemiology in Europe from the 1960 s to the present {{within the context of}} changing perceptions of the drug phe-nomenon and changing information needs of policy makers. In particular, it focuses on how <b>epidemiological</b> <b>indicators</b> developed as part of emerging European political and institutional instruments and structures for responding to illegal drugs. It also notes the importance of wider international developments in drug epidemiology and of cooperation between networks of researchers. Interest in epidemiology at the European level was first observed in the early 1970 s with the creation of the Pompidou Group. Work on a variety of drug indica-tors accelerated in the 1980 s following the establishment of an expert epidemiology group within the Pompidou Group of the Council of Europe. This foreshadowed the founding by the European Union of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) in 1993. During the 1990 s, EMCDDA, together with the member States, further devel-oped five <b>key</b> <b>epidemiological</b> <b>indicators</b> of drug prevalence and health consequences in order to improve the quality and comparability of core data needed to describe and analyse the drug phenomenon at the European level. In the early 2000 s, those indi-cators were adopted by member States, endorsed by the European Council and incor-porated into the European Union Drugs Strategy and Action Plan 2000 - 2004. The goal is now to ensure implementation of those key indicators in member States as the basis for a European Union epidemiological information system on drugs. It is essen-tial that the indicators are complemented by qualitative and quantitative research and context information in order to interpret the data correctly and provide answers that are relevant to policy needs...|$|R
40|$|Sierra Leone {{experienced}} intense {{transmission of}} Ebola virus disease (EVD) from May 2014 to November 2015 during which {{a total of}} 8, 704 confirmed cases and over 3, 589 confirmed deaths were reported. Our field observation showed many issues in the EVD data management system which {{may have contributed to}} the magnitude and long duration of the outbreak. In this perspective article, we explain the key issues with EVD data management in the field, and the resulting obstacles in analyzing <b>key</b> <b>epidemiological</b> <b>indicators</b> during the outbreak response work. Our observation showed that during the latter part of the EVD outbreak, surveillance and data management improved at all levels in the country as compared to the earlier stage. We identified incomplete filling and late arrival of the case investigation forms at data management centers, difficulties in detecting double entries and merging identified double entries in the database, and lack of clear process of how death of confirmed cases in holding, treatment and community care centers are reported to the data centers as some of challenges to effective data management. Furthermore, there was no consolidated database that captured and linked all data sources in a structured way. We propose development of a new application tool easily adaptable to new occurrences, regular data harmonization meetings between national and district data management teams, and establishment of a data quality audit system to assure good quality data as ways to improve EVD data management during future outbreaks...|$|R
40|$|Background: Chlamydial {{infection}} {{is the most}} common notifiable disease in Australia, Europe and the US. Australian notifications of chlamydia rose four-fold from 20, 274 cases in 2002 to 80, 846 cases in 2011; the majority of cases were among young people aged less than 29 years. Along with test positivity rates, an understanding of the number of tests performed and the demographics of individuals being tested are <b>key</b> <b>epidemiological</b> <b>indicators.</b> The ACCESS Laboratory Network was established in 2008 to address this issue. Methods: The ACCESS Laboratory Network collected chlamydia testing data from 15 laboratories around Australia over a three-year period using data extraction software. All chlamydia testing data from participating laboratories were extracted from the laboratory information system; patient identifiers converted to a unique, non-reversible code and de-identified data sent to a single database. Analysis of data by anatomical site included all specimens, but in age and sex specific analysis, only one testing episode was counted. Results: From 2008 to 2010 a total of 628, 295 chlamydia tests were referred to the 15 laboratories. Of the 592, 626 individual episodes presenting for testing, 70 % were from female and 30 % from male patients. In female patients, chlamydia positivity rate was 6. 4 % overall; the highest rate in 14 year olds (14. 3 %). In male patients, the chlamydia positivity rate was 9. 4 % overall; the highest in 19 year olds (16. 5 %). The most common sample type was urine (57 %). In 3. 2 % of testing episodes, multiple anatomical sites were sampled. Urethral swabs gave the highest positivity rate for all anatomical sites in both female (7. 7 %) and male patients (14 %), followed by urine (7. 6 % and 9. 4 %, respectively) and eye (6. 3 % and 7. 9 %, respectively). Conclusions: The ACCESS Laboratory Network data are unique in both number and scope and are representative of chlamydia testing in both general practice and high-risk clinics. The findings from these data highlight much lower levels of testing in young people aged 20 years or less; in particular female patients aged less than 16 years, despite being the group with the highest positivity rate. Strategies are needed to increase the uptake of testing in this high-risk group. © 2014 Dimech et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Continuous {{monitoring}} of the <b>key</b> <b>epidemiological</b> <b>indicators</b> of diabetes is necessary for evaluating the magnitude of diabetes {{as a public health}} problem, but is currently not being undertaken in Germany. A comprehensive literature review covering the last decades was conducted to give an overview of population-based studies reporting on diabetes prevalence, diabetes incidence, and diabetes-related mortality among adults in Germany. This review differentiates between known and unknown diabetes, but not between individual types of diabetes. Numerous studies have identified a considerable increase in the prevalence of known diabetes among the adult population over time. Until the 1960 s, the prevalence of known diabetes remained below 1 %. However, current nationwide estimates for Germany are much higher and range between 7. 2 % (population aged 18 to 79 years) based on health examination surveys of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), 8. 9 % (population aged 18 years and over) based on RKI telephone health interview surveys and 9. 9 % (among all age groups) based on statutory health insurance data. Few available estimates point to an increase in the incidence of known diabetes since the 1960 s. For example, a comparison of data from the diabetes register of the former German Democratic Republic (GDR) in 1960 with current follow-up data from RKI survey participants shows that incidence rates increased from 1. 2 (all age groups) to 6. 9 (population aged 18 to 79 years) per 1, 000 person-years. Data on diabetes-related mortality are also scarce, but indicate that excess mortality persists among people with known diabetes compared to those in the same age group without the condition, despite the finding of decreasing mortality rates among people with known diabetes. For example, the mortality rate based on early data from the GDR diabetes register was 1. 9 -fold higher among people with known diabetes than among the general population; current mortality follow-up data of RKI survey participants show a 1. 7 -fold higher mortality rate among people with known diabetes compared to those without the condition. Given the limited data that are currently available and the considerable variation of diagnostic criteria, {{it is not possible to}} estimate time trends in the prevalence, incidence or mortality of unknown diabetes. An extension of available health monitoring approaches and an improved use of existing data sources for secondary analysis are needed for a reliable evaluation of dynamics in diabetes epidemiology in Germany. To achieve these goals, a national diabetes surveillance system is currently being established under the auspices of the RKI...|$|R

The article summarizes data from 19 original studies on the epidemiology of parkinsonism and Parkinson's disease in Russia published between 2005 - 2015. Due to the statistical heterogeneity of the primary results computational analytics was not applied to the data; however, data consolidation allowed to perform a trend analysis of <b>epidemiological</b> <b>indicators.</b> The methodological basis of the majority of studies was medical aid appealabil-ity; two of the studies used door-to-door surveys. One of the studies returned questionably low <b>epidemiological</b> <b>indicators</b> obtained from the medical records, and the rest showed the standardized prevalence of 30. 0 - 139. 9 / 100, 000 and incidence of 7. 63 - 21. 8 / 100, 000 per year. Contribution of Parkinson's disease to the nosological structure of parkinsonism was > 61. 3 %. Estimate of the number of patients with PD in Russia is approximately 210, 000 people. Conclusions are made regarding the prevalence of PD in Russia according to the cross-cutting research on the level of indicators in the Western countries. The prevalence of PD by appealability is 2 - 3 times less than the prevalence in continuous research, both national and foreign. The incidence of PD, demonstrated in half of the studies, is stable from region to region and is comparable with the universally recognized values...|$|R

Materials and methods. The data was obtained from epidemiological reports of the Colombian Agricultural Institute and the National Agricultural Census 2014. The annual departmental average of the variables studied was compared and it was performed a temporal analysis through graphical representation. Results. 44 % of the positive farms were focused on the CAA; the positivity rate of farms in the CAA (27. 9 %) was higher and statistically significant when related to the average rate in the country (24. 8 %) being promoted by the least producing departments. Regarding to the cattle population, the CAA concentrated 47. 0 % of positive cattle in the country; however, the bovine positivity rate (5. 8 %) was statistically equal to the national average (5. 3 %); yet, the departments with lower cattle population had the highest rates.

Exploring the virulence of pathogens using molecular markers and linking their characteristics to the <b>epidemiological</b> <b>indicators</b> such as incidence and prevalence In this paper written for general practitioners and medical experts, the applications of molecular epidemiology in public health and medicine by unfolding simple and practical examples have been discussed. Keywords: Molecular epidemiolog...|$|R
40|$|Abstract We {{present the}} case of the Nahua {{population}} of Santa Rosa de Serjali, Peruvian Amazon's population, considered of initial contact. This population consists of human groups {{that for a long time}} decided to live in isolation, but lately have begun living a more sedentary lifestyle and in contact with Western populations. There are two fully identified initial contact groups in Peru: the Nahua and the Nanti. The health statistics of the Nahua are scarce. This study offers an interpretation of demographic and <b>epidemiological</b> <b>indicators</b> of the Nahua people, trying to identify if a certain degree of health vulnerability exists. We performed a cross sectional study, and after analyzing their health indicators, as well as the supplemental qualitative analysis of the population, brought us to conclude that in 2006, the Nahua, remained in a state of health vulnerability...|$|R
40|$|In {{epidemiological}} surveillance {{it is important}} that any unusual increase of reported cases be detected as rapidly as possible. Reliable forecasting based on a suitable time series model for an <b>epidemiological</b> <b>indicator</b> is necessary for estimating the expected non-epidemic indicator and to elaborate an alert threshold. Time series analyses of acute diseases often use Gaussian autoregressive integrated moving average models. However, these approaches can be adversely affected by departures from the true underlying distribution. The objective {{of this paper is to}} introduce a bootstrap procedure for obtaining prediction intervals in linear models in order to avoid the normality assumption. We present a Monte Carlo study comparing the finite sample properties of bootstrap prediction intervals with those of alternative methods. Finally, we illustrate the performance of the proposed method with a meningococcal disease incidence series. Morbidity prediction, epidemiological time series, sieve bootstrap,...|$|R
40|$|The article {{describes}} the organization reveal of TB patients at medical facilities of primary health care (PHC) in Moscow. There are the main <b>epidemiological</b> <b>indicators</b> in Moscow and {{the features of the}} organization of TB detection in the city. The Quality of detection TB cases in PHC is directly depends on the attention of PHC workers to TB risk groups, the competence in the assessment of the main TB symptoms and organization of the patients’ flow for checking up for TB including sputum smear microscopy. It is proposed installation of centralized fluorography register with the option to analyze the index of “the proportion of people not examined more than two years”. The Quality of TB detection in PHC facilities can be improved by complex implementation of medical and organizational changes and indicators and their regular collection and analysis.   </div...|$|R
