5|$|During the {{construction}} of residential housing and other buildings on the site in 1988–89, several underground sections of the bunker complex were uncovered by work crews. In April 1988, the East German government allowed several visits to the site by photo-journalists. Water was pumped out of the Vorbunker for four days before access could be made via the underground passageway which led from the Chancellery. The interior floor of the Vorbunker {{was covered with a}} muddy sludge from having been underwater for so many years. Old empty wine bottles were found {{on the floor of the}} kitchen and wine store room. Still present in the room next to the kitchen were the broken frames of the bunk beds used by the Goebbels children. At the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> were the stairs leading down to the Führerbunker. However, the men could go no further than the mid-landing, as the Führerbunker was still underwater and the ceiling beyond the doorway had collapsed due to the demolitions performed in 1947. After these inspections, work crews for the most part removed and destroyed the bunker complex. The Vorbunkers top and external walls were the first structures to be torn down. The construction of buildings in the area around the complex was a strategy for ensuring the surroundings remained anonymous and unremarkable. The emergency exit point for the Führerbunker (which had been in the Chancellery gardens) was occupied by a car park.|$|E
25|$|At Borg in Norrköping Municipality, Östergötland, a small {{building}} was excavated that had two rooms {{on either side}} of a central hallway. There was a stone foundation interpreted as a hörgr at the far <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> from the entrance. Two amulet rings were found near this and 98 amulet rings and 75 kg of unburned animal bones, including numerous skulls and jawbones, were found in the paved area in front of the entrance, suggesting the building had been used for ritual feasts. In the eleventh century the building and its yard had been covered with a thick layer of gravel and a church erected 100m away.|$|E
25|$|The long {{second floor}} hallway {{is now known}} as the Heritage Gallery. Photographs of graduating classes, portraits of nuns and students, diplomas, and other memorabilia hang in this hallway. At the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> in a former girls' {{dormitory}} room is the Heritage Museum, which documents the history of the Ursulines in Montana and at Ursuline Academy. The museum also contains many Native American beadwork items and dresses donated to the Ursulines by tribes in Montana. Antique clocks, hand-carved chairs, and intricately detailed tables—many made by the sisters at St. Peter's Mission—are also housed in the museum. A painting of St. Peter's Mission by contemporary artist Ralph DeCamp also hangs in the room.|$|E
60|$|Dave did not answer. At <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> semi-dark <b>hallway</b> {{there was}} a closet which in years gone by had been used for <b>the</b> storage <b>of</b> guns and clothing. Into this closet the two youths went, closing the door {{carefully}} after them.|$|R
50|$|Wahconah sits on 25 acre of land off Route 8 in Dalton. The {{building}} is {{shaped like a}} ladder, with two main corridors that run North-South, and three hallways that run East-West. Expansion plans originally called for <b>the</b> addition <b>of</b> a fourth <b>hallway</b> connecting <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallways,</b> but {{it proved to be}} too expensive. There are also soccer fields, baseball diamonds, and a track/football field. It is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> few high schools in the region to have both JV and varsity baseball fields on its campus. Trails that run through the woods are used by track and field and cross country running, as well as connect the school to Nessacus Regional Middle School.|$|R
50|$|Many {{original}} elements also {{remain in}} the classroom, though these are less decorative. Each hallway has an arched marble niche with a drinking fountain. At each <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three <b>hallways</b> is a three-part wood and glass door with transom in textured glass. <b>The</b> <b>hallways</b> are all wainscoted.|$|R
25|$|Inside the school, teacher Dave Sanders had {{successfully}} evacuated {{students from the}} cafeteria; where some of them went up a staircase leading {{to the second floor}} of the school. The stairs were located around the corner from the Library Hallway in the main South Hallway. By now, Harris and Klebold were inside the main hallway. Sanders and another student were down at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> still trying to secure as much of the school as they could. As they ran, they encountered Harris and Klebold, who were approaching from the corner of the North Hallway. Sanders and the student turned and ran in the opposite direction. Harris and Klebold shot at them both, with Harris hitting Sanders twice in the chest but missing the student. The latter ran into a science classroom and warned everyone to hide. Klebold walked over towards Sanders, who had collapsed, to look for the student but returned to Harris up the North Hallway.|$|E
500|$|The {{scene at}} the {{beginning}} of the episode, in which the people of Springfield mob the Kwik-E-Mart, is based on the events of the 1992 Los Angeles riots. Todd is wearing a Butthole Surfers shirt; however, the censors only allowed [...] "Buttho Surfers". Jay Sherman from The Critic, who had previously appeared in [...] "A Star Is Burns", can also be seen in the mental hospital repeatedly saying his catchphrase, [...] "It stinks". The small door at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> in Flanders' rebuilt house echoes the improbably small hallway in the film Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{exiting the}} elevator, guests enter a hallway within the secret MIB Headquarters. Traveling down the hall, {{they pass the}} film's famous [...] "worm guys" [...] on break, several {{interactive}} doors to various labs, and through the alien scanners. [...] At the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway,</b> guests overlook the immigration and controls room, with a large video screen broadcasting the training information and alien twins, Bob and Bhnxaxx operating controls. They then move into the weapons room, and finally into the training facility, where a training vehicle awaits. Guests who use an Express Pass skip some rooms and meet the normal riders {{when they see the}} alien twins in the control rooms, then follow the normal riders but in a different path.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} building, {{built in}} 1999, has been expanded. It {{consists of a}} central rotunda, where the cafeteria, offices, and library are located. Attached to this are two long hallways running in opposite directions, which house classrooms. At <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallways</b> are <b>the</b> athletic facilities, including a natatorium, workout facility, gymnasiums, fields, and a stadium. At <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other <b>hallway,</b> on <b>the</b> opposite <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> school, are the fine arts rehearsal facilities, black box theatre, and the freshman center. The original facility was built on a 66 acre site by PBK Architects to support a maximum <b>of</b> 2,800 students. <b>The</b> school has a net building area of 433000 sq ft. and cost of $37,507,000.|$|R

Fanning out to search, Shemp finds the girl tied up and gagged in a curtained alcove at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main <b>hallway.</b> <b>The</b> scientist and his assistant (Stanley Price) then try to dispose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Stooges, but the Stooges overcome the odds and escape with the girl in a car driven by one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scientist's robots.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> main <b>hallway</b> extends into <b>the</b> {{expanded}} portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building. The {{transition between}} <b>the</b> two parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building {{is marked by}} ramps on both {{the north and south}} halves <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building. The expansion has two floors that run adjacent to <b>the</b> westernmost branch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original building and contains several more English classrooms, the Science classrooms and the library. Further west down <b>the</b> main <b>hallway</b> are <b>the</b> cafeteria and the field house, art rooms, the band room, the theater, and the athletic offices.

2500|$|The {{deferred}} payment plan caused {{friction between the}} filmmakers {{and some of the}} extras, who demanded immediate payment after their two nights on set [...] "or basically we're going to kill you." [...] The lack of money forced Abbess to innovate ways to shoot scenes that he wouldn’t have normally done. The scene in which Balan is killed is an example of this. Abbess ran out of time to film this scene using conventional techniques, so positioned the camera at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> and used [...] "crash zooms… {{in and out of the}} action" [...] to highlight the key moments. Abbess studied other low-budget films like Requiem for a Dream and Donnie Darko to identify ways the filmmakers worked around their small budgets.|$|E
2500|$|Wolfe's office becomes nearly {{soundproof}} {{when the}} doors connecting it to the front room and the hallway are closed. There is a small hole in the office wall covered by what Archie calls a [...] "trick picture of a waterfall." [...] A person in an alcove at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> can open a sliding panel covering the hole, so as {{to see and hear}} conversations and other events in the office without being noticed. The chair behind Wolfe's desk is custom-built, with special springs to hold his weight; according to Archie, it is the only chair that Wolfe really enjoys sitting in. Near the desk is a large chair upholstered in red leather, which is usually reserved for Inspector Cramer, a current or prospective client, or the person whom Wolfe and Archie want to question. In the short story [...] "The Squirt and the Monkey," [...] Wolfe and Archie have a hidden tape recorder and microphone installed in the office, with controls in the kitchen. In the story [...] "Eeny Meeny Murder Mo," [...] the system is modified to transmit sound to a speaker in the front room.|$|E
50|$|The {{station is}} {{built in a}} three-vault {{configuration}} 53 metres (173 feet) underground. <b>The</b> central <b>hallway</b> contains a sculpture made out of anodised gold pyramids and tetrahedra. <b>The</b> architects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> station are A.F. Strelkov, V.I. Klokov, N.I. Demchinsky, J.A. Kolesnikov, and E.S. Barsky. <b>The</b> theme <b>of</b> Aviamotornaya is aviation and flying. The columns holding up the ceiling are glazed in a light marble tone. The floor {{is made up of}} granite plates coloured in different shades <b>of</b> grey. <b>The</b> wall at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> central <b>hallway</b> is faced in a metal sculpture. There are decorations mentioning and detailing the main constellations.|$|R
50|$|Several {{additions}} {{have been}} made to the building over the years. The first addition added <b>hallways</b> to <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> existing <b>hallways</b> to create two square <b>hallways</b> coming off <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main walkways. With that addition in the 1990s, Minooka added more technology and classroom space. Next came the new physical education department space that has been added in the last 4 or 5 years. This addition created more room for PE classes, along with driver's ed classrooms and more. The other big addition was building a new lunch room. This glass panel, rounded room, is <b>the</b> location <b>of</b> lunch, after school programs, athletic practices, concerts, musicals & plays, and the homecoming dance.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{original}} section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{house is}} a simple U-shaped plan with verandahs extending beyond <b>the</b> length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house. The folly stands within the central space created by <b>the</b> plan <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house, protected on each side by the enclosed verandahs and has external access at <b>the</b> rear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house. Internal access to the folly is gained from <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> large central <b>hallway</b> in <b>the</b> old house.|$|R
2500|$|Arnold T Blumburg of the {{magazine}} Now Playing gave [...] "The End of the World" [...] a grade of [...] "A-", praising the spectacle {{as well as the}} performances of Eccleston and Piper and their developing characters. However, he felt that the climax suffered from pacing issues. SFX called it a [...] "brave episode to air so early, but it works", praising the way the alien concepts were reminiscent to the classic series. However, the reviewer wrote that [...] "the full drama of the event is never quite captured" [...] and [...] "the murder plot...never quite takes flight, but it provides the framework for some brilliant scenes". In Who Is the Doctor, a guide to the revived series, Graeme Burk described [...] "The End of the World" [...] as [...] "sheer, unadulterated fun", particularly praising the emotional connection that was built between the Doctor and Rose. Burk felt that there could have been more of a build-up to the Cassandra revelation, but commented that [...] "a lot {{of the success of the}} story" [...] was due to her. Burk's co-author Robert Smith added that the episode allowed Eccleston to shine by offering the Doctor a wide range of emotions. Despite their positive reviews, Burk and Smith noted that the switch at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> with giant fans was [...] "contrived" [...] and [...] "silly". In 2013, Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times felt that the episode had everything to be expected from Davies' Doctor Who: boldness, camp, and emotional and character drama. The A.V. Club reviewer Alasdair Wilkins gave the episode a grade of B+, noting that the episode was not concerned with plot, but it succeeded in character moments and reintroducing Doctor Who.|$|E

5000|$|The {{original}} building constructed {{specifically to}} house Arlington High School {{was built on}} Raymond Avenue in Poughkeepsie. It later went on {{to be used as}} the Arthur S. May Elementary School, and most recently (2014) it was purchased by nearby Vassar College. The second high school was built in 1933 and {{went on to become the}} Arlington Middle School. That building is now <b>the</b> current location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Arthur S. May Elementary School, which moved into the building in 2014. The current Arlington High School building, originally constructed in 1961, has been significantly expanded several times, most recently in 2009. The newly expanded high school includes a main lobby, where the [...] "Bubble" [...] is located. Adjacent to the main lobby are the main office, the [...] "Main Annex" [...] and a New York State Police office. Attached to this are two long hallways running in opposite directions, which house more offices and classrooms. At <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallways</b> are <b>the</b> Gyms (Gyms 5, 6, 7), as well as the Athletic Department office. At <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other <b>hallway,</b> on <b>the</b> opposite <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> school, is the Large Group Instruction Room, Cafeterias C and D, and the Admiral Cafe, a student-run restaurant that operates during school hours.

50|$|During the day, Holly senses a {{presence}} and strong temperature change, which the {{others do not}} feel. Scott's EMF meter reads nothing, but he soon realizes he forgot to insert a battery. When he does so, it immediately begins reading a large disturbance. The reading suddenly goes dead at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main <b>hallway,</b> and Holly agrees {{that there is no}} presence in the kitchen. This is reinforced when the ghost later chases them, and they take refuge in the kitchen. Worried that the attacks could turn dangerous, Liam and Holly argue they should leave the house. Scott, however, insists they stay to capture evidence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> paranormal. When they subsequently film a telekinetic attack by flying furniture, Scott again insists they stay, this time to test his theory. Liam, who owns their transportation, reluctantly agrees, overriding Holly's objections.|$|R
50|$|From its inception, MoMA PS1 has {{championed the}} {{innovative}} and the experimental. The premiere exhibition, Rooms, held in June 1976, featured <b>the</b> works <b>of</b> 78 artists, {{many of whom}} created site-specific installations in the former classrooms. For Rooms, the sculptor Alan Saret cut a tiny hole in one wall, creating an almost heavenly aureole of light at one <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> third-floor <b>hallway.</b> <b>The</b> museum has featured <b>the</b> works <b>of</b> <b>the</b> artists Janet Cardiff, David Hammons, Kimsooja, Hilma af Klint, Donald Lipski, John McCracken, Dennis Oppenheim, Michelangelo Pistoletto, Alan Saret, Katharina Sieverding, Keith Sonnier, Michael Tracy, Franz West, Judy Rifka, and Peter Young. A {{focus has been on}} outsider artists such as Henry Darger, who was included in “Disasters of War: Francisco de Goya, Henry Darger, Jake and Dinos Chapman” (2000). “Greater New York,” a survey of little known and emerging artists working in New York City, was established in 2000 and is mounted every five years. Many exhibitions organized by MoMA PS1 travel to museums in the United States and abroad, including collaborations with Kunst-Werke Institute for Contemporary Art in Berlin.|$|R

50|$|The {{ground storey}} is divided by a central <b>hallway</b> that links <b>the</b> western and eastern sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house. The {{ceilings}} to this level have exposed timber joists behind which are fitted tongue-and-groove timber boards. If {{this is an}} original feature, it suggests that the lower level was intended for service or storage purposes only. All walls appear to be plastered. The internal ones are of a similar thickness to those on the exterior. On <b>the</b> southern side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hall is a large rectangular room, used currently as a lounge. The exposed joists to its ceiling are supported by a bearer resting {{on a number of}} large timber posts. On the northern side are two rooms, one a kitchen and the other a study. <b>The</b> openings out <b>of</b> these rooms into the central hall have basket-shaped arches. A timber stair connects the lounge to the level above. <b>The</b> severed <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> a number of joists are visible in at least one stairwell wall. The doors opening onto either <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> central <b>hallway</b> have square highlights above them, and narrow sidelights.

5000|$|Alec Kreider (then age 16) {{had entered}} the Haines' home without force, {{stabbing}} Thomas and Lisa to death in their sleep, and then after a struggle with Kevin stabbed him to death before promptly escaping before the police could arrive. Communication between the Haines' neighbor, the call-taker at 911, and the dispatcher caused extreme unnecessary delay in police response to the [...] "unknown disturbance". The official timeline notes that it took the first responding officer nearly twelve minutes to arrive {{from a distance of}} four miles, in <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> night with no traffic barriers. Police say this delay had no bearing on <b>the</b> survival <b>of</b> <b>the</b> victims.

Police presume the murderer attempted to clean up at the sink as blood was also found therein. Bloody shoe prints appeared on lower carpeted steps as the perpetrator exited the house.
