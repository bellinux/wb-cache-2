5|$|Some {{members of}} the Norwegian black metal scene were {{motivated}} to take violent action against this influence – for instance, the church burnings by black metal musicians Varg Vikernes, Samoth, Faust, and Jørn Inge Tunsberg, among others. While most bands or individuals did not go that far, an undercurrent of racism, nationalism, and anti-Semitism continues to permeate parts of the black metal scene. Many Viking metal artists, however, including bands such as Enslaved and Einherjer, simply express interest in Vikings and Norse mythology and entirely reject the Satanic inclination of black metal, writing almost exclusively on Norse themes, without any racist or anti-Semitic undertones. Whereas black metal during the 1990s took a militant and destructive stance toward the status quo, Viking metal looked {{to the past and}} took a populist, anti-system approach which eschewed violence. Viking metal is both pre-Christian and post-apocalyptic– <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> a pre-Christian past and imagines a post-Christian future. While opposition to Christianity drove the formation of Viking metal, some bands that play, or have played, Viking metal, such as Slechtvalk, Drottnar, and Holy Blood, subscribe to Christian beliefs.|$|E

It affirms the responsibility of the Church in each generation to make this faith its own in reality of worship, in honesty of thought and expression, and in purity of heart before God. In accordance with the teaching of our Lord and the practice prevailing among evangelical Christians, it recognizes two sacraments: Baptism and the Lord's Supper or Holy Communion.|$|E

[...] Wenger was {{surprised}} his opponents Manchester City had taken midfielder Frank Lampard from their own franchise club New York City FC on loan; he questioned whether this was a way to bypass UEFA's Financial Fair Play rules. Of Bacary Sagna's move from Arsenal to Manchester City in the summer, Wenger told reporters: [...] "I made him a proposal to stay for three years, but he chose them. Had he chosen a long time ago? Maybe – <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> me like he agreed it a long time before." [...] Wenger also revealed Arsenal had received offers for defender Thomas Vermaelen; on the day of the Community Shield match the player transferred to Barcelona.|$|E
500|$|After {{playing for}} England in the Tri-series in Australia {{at the start}} of the year, Buttler was once again {{involved}} with England at an international tournament, playing in the 2015 Cricket World Cup in Australia and New Zealand. Later in the English winter he was called back into the Test side as first choice Test wicket-keeper during the tour of the West Indies. He continued in the role throughout the English summer, playing both Tests against New Zealand and all five Ashes Tests against Australia. Buttler's batting during the Ashes series was criticised by Boycott, saying [...] "Jos Buttler is like a rabbit caught in the headlights of Ashes cricket. A seven-year-old schoolboy would have played better. He hasn't made a run all series. He hasn't shown any application whatsoever. <b>It</b> <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> me like his mind and confidence is shot for Test cricket – it's pathetic." [...] He continued to play one-day cricket alongside his Test role, making his highest ODI score of 129 from 77 balls against New Zealand.|$|E

I'm sorry we couldn't get any Yugos." [...] For the scene after the intro wherein Mulder discovers the charred remains of abductees, the prop and the production design departments had to create specialized fake bodies. Carter later noted that it's [...] "harder than <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> create a charred, dead body." [...] The stage for the alien abduction scene was built from scratch: construction supervisor Rob Maier was tasked with creating a full-scale replica of the Ruskin Dam bridge in order to ease up the shots.

500|$|Cyrus' first live {{performance}} of [...] "Party in the U.S.A." [...] at the Teen Choice Awards held on August 10, 2009. Clothed by {{a tank top}} that revealed a portion of her bra, black hot pants, and leather boots, Cyrus and backup dancers appeared from a trailer. Midway through the performance, Cyrus danced atop an ice cream pushcart with a pole (which was suggested to be a dance pole by numerous critics) for approximately forty seconds. Cyrus described the performance to be about her heritage: [...] " [...] performance tonight is funny, but I {{wanted it to be}} about [...] I'm like, 'This is to represent where I am from. I'm so proud of it.' All the girls trying to be Hollywood and stuff with their big glasses, me shooing them away." [...] The performance was met with a media uproar in regards to her dancing being too suggestive and sexual for a teen-oriented event, which caused The Walt Disney Company to issue a statement distancing themselves from the performance. Ian Drew, senior editor of Us Weekly said, [...] "She already has this risque image, so it really wasn't much of a stretch. That's how Britney [...] took off. She was the good girl gone bad, and <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> be working for Miley as well." [...] Other contemporary critics used negative comparisons to Spears, but Cyrus welcomed the comparisons via a post on her official Twitter account. Child psychologist Wendi Fischer told Newsday: Cyrus was communicating to her fans that it is acceptable to pole dance, which, according to Fischer, was unacceptable. [...] "Miley's only 16. Why is she rushing it?", she concluded. Other critics defended Cyrus. Apryl Duncan of About.com said viewers should have fixated on her accomplishments that night, winning six awards, rather than the sexuality of the performance. Following the backlash of the performance, Cyrus replaced the ice cream pushcart with a luggage cart while touring.|$|E

2500|$|Jerry Pournelle of BYTE {{wrote in}} February 1984 that Turbo Pascal [...] "comes {{close to what}} I think the {{computer}} industry is headed for: well documented, standard, plenty of good features, and a reasonable price". Pournelle disliked the requirement to buy another license to distribute binaries, but noted that [...] "it turns {{out not to be}} a lot more. Borland only wants another $100" [...] more than the $49.95 base price, and that [...] "my first impression of Turbo is that it's probably worth $149.95. <b>It</b> <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> do everything MT+ with the Speed Programming Package does, and maybe even do it faster and better". He reported in July that, according to Kahn, IBM had refused to resell Turbo Pascal unless the price was at least $200; Pournelle noted that [...] "Turbo is much better than the Pascal IBM sells", and unlike the latter was compatible with the IBM PCjr. Three BYTE reviewers praised Turbo Pascal in the same issue. One called the DOS version [...] "without doubt, the best software value I have ever purchased", and another called the CP/M version [...] "an excellent product ... deserves praise for this high-value product". The third stated that it was [...] "not a good compiler for developing massive applications", but added that it was greatly superior to BASIC, the programming language usually associated with home computers at the time. He concluded that Turbo Pascal was [...] "a bargain that shouldn't be passed up".|$|E
2500|$|Quirinus is a debated epithet. According to some scholars, mostly Francophone, <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> be {{strictly}} {{related to the}} ideas of the passage of the Roman people from war back to peace, from the condition of miles, soldier, to that of quiris, citizen occupied in peaceful business, as the rites of the Porta Belli imply. This is in fact the usual sense of the word quirites in Latin. Other scholars, mainly Germanophone, think it is related on the contrary to the martial character of the god Quirinus, an interpretation supported by numerous ancient sources: Lydus, Cedrenus, Macrobius, Ovid, Plutarch and Paul the Daecon. Schilling and Capdeville counter that it is his function of presiding over the return to peace that gave Janus this epithet, as confirmed by his association on 30 March with Pax, Concordia [...] and Salus, even though it is true that Janus as god of all beginnings presides also over that of war and is thus often called belliger, bringer of war as well as pacificus. This use is also discussed by Dumézil in various works concerning the armed nature of the Mars qui praeest paci, the armed quality of the gods of the third function and the arms of the third function. C. Koch on the other hand sees the epithet Janus Quirinus as a reflection of the god's patronage over the two months beginning and ending the year, after their addition by king Numa in his reform of the calendar. This interpretation too would befit the liminal nature of Janus.|$|E
