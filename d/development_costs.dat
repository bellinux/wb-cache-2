40|$|This {{paper will}} {{report on the}} {{activities}} of the IAA Launcher Systems Economics Working Group in preparations for its Launcher Systems <b>Development</b> <b>Cost</b> Behavior Study. The Study goals include: improve launcher system and other space system parametric cost analysis accuracy; improve launcher system and other space system cost analysis credibility; and provide launcher system and technology development program managers and other decisionmakers with useful information on <b>development</b> <b>cost</b> impacts of their decisions. The Working Group plans to explore at least the following five areas in the Study: define and explain <b>development</b> <b>cost</b> behavior terms and concepts for use in the Study; identify and quantify sources of <b>development</b> <b>cost</b> and cost estimating uncertainty; identify and quantify significant influences on <b>development</b> <b>cost</b> behavior; identify common barriers to <b>development</b> <b>cost</b> understanding and reduction; and recommend practical, realistic strategies to accomplish reductions in launcher system <b>development</b> <b>cost...</b>|$|R
40|$|It {{is often}} {{argued that in}} {{information}} extraction (IE), certain machine learning (ML) approaches save development time over others, or that certain ML methods (e. g. Active Learning) require less training data than others, thus saving <b>development</b> <b>cost.</b> However, such <b>development</b> <b>cost</b> claims are not normally backed up by controlled studies which show that such <b>development</b> <b>cost</b> savings actually occur. This situation in Language Engineering (LE) is contrasted with Software Engineering in general, {{where a lot of}} studies investigating system <b>development</b> <b>cost</b> have been carried out. We argue for the need of controlled studies that measure actual system development time in LE. To this end, we carry out an experiment in resource monitoring for an IE task: three named entity taggers for the same “surprise ” domain are developed in parallel, using competing methods. Their human development time is accounted for using a logging facility. We report <b>development</b> <b>cost</b> results and present a breakdown of the development time for the three alternative methods. We are not aware of detailed previous parallel studies that detail how system development time in IE is spent...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effect of}} the <b>development</b> <b>cost</b> on an open source software enhancement that is developed by individual programmers in an Internet community. It considers a situation in which each programmer's <b>cost</b> of <b>development</b> is common knowledge but his valuation of the enhancement is his private information, with other programmers knowing about only its distribution. Depending on the distribution functions of programmers' valuations of the enhancement, a programmer with a lower <b>development</b> <b>cost</b> may have a less incentive to develop. As the <b>development</b> <b>cost</b> decreases, the enhancement may be less likely to be developed, and some programmers may be worse off...|$|R
5|$|Chrysler Corporation {{approved}} {{the development of}} the model on the assumption that Chrysler Europe would sell 60,000 C9 models per year, which translated into a projected 5percent share of the executive car market. This estimate seemed achievable because Chrysler had a 7percent market share in Europe overall. The projected sales would have covered the car's tooling costs, with the <b>development</b> <b>costs</b> accounted for separately, as part of an independent annual budget.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, {{the city}} budget, which is {{presented}} by the Mayor of Kraków on 15 November annually, has a projected revenue of 3,500,000,000 złoty. The primary sources of revenue were as follows: 14% from the municipal taxation on real estate properties {{and the use of}} amenities, 30% in transfers from the national budget, and 34% in state subsidies. Projected expenditures, totaling 3,520,000,000 złoty, included 21% in city <b>development</b> <b>costs</b> and 79% in city maintenance costs. Of the maintenance costs, as much as 39% were spent on education and childcare. The City of Kraków's <b>development</b> <b>costs</b> included; 41% toward construction of roads, transport, and communication (combined), and 25% for the city's infrastructure and environment. The city has a high bond credit rating, and some 60% of the population is under the age of 45.|$|E

5|$|The Witness {{received}} widespread acclaim from critics, who {{praised the}} difficult but surmountable puzzles and the game's art and setting.

On that basis the per-weapon cost is $300,000 or twelve times the cost of the comparable American JDAM, although the latter has been manufactured in much larger quantities (~250,000 kits) and would be reasonable to expect a drastic reduction of the price of the French munition if larger contracts are signed and economies of scale are achieved.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the heavy}} {{promotion}} it received, upon release the game only reached #18 in the Dengeki charts with initial sales of 14,000 units. Its sales continued {{to fall and}} within three weeks the game {{had dropped out of}} the Dengeki Top 50. By the end of the year, Nine had sold just over 30,000. According to Atlus, the game's sales {{by the end of the}} 2002-2003 fiscal year had reached 45,000 units: this fell below their planned sales number of 67,000 units. In May, Atlus announced that the <b>development</b> <b>costs</b> and poor sales of Xbox games, including Nine, had resulted in a financial loss for that year.|$|E
5|$|However, {{when the}} German coordinators {{discovered}} how extensively the game dealt with Neo-Nazism, they informed LucasArts {{about the difficulty}} of marketing the game in their country. As Germany was an important overseas market for adventure games, LucasArts feared that the lower revenues would not recoup <b>development</b> <b>costs,</b> and subsequently canceled the game. The plot was later adapted into a four-part Dark Horse Comics series by Lee Marrs, published monthly from December 1994 to March 1995. In an interview, Barwood commented that the development team should have thought about the story more thoroughly beforehand, calling it insensitive and not regretting the cancellation of the title.|$|E

5|$|The design {{incorporated}} many novel features, {{such as the}} use of thermic siphons, bogies and cabs at {{each end}} of the locomotive, resulting in its unique—for a steam locomotive—modern diesel-like appearance. Several of its innovations proved to be unsuccessful however, partly accounting for the project's cancellation in the early 1950s. Five Leader locomotives were begun, although only one was completed. The operational locomotive was trialled on the former Southern Railway network around Brighton. Problems with the design, indifferent reports on performance and political pressure surrounding spiralling <b>development</b> <b>costs,</b> led to all locomotives of the class being scrapped by 1951.|$|E

5|$|The team {{sought to}} create an {{immersive}} world for the player and {{to compete with the}} Microsoft Flight Simulator series. Commercially, Flight Unlimited II performed well enough to recoup its <b>development</b> <b>costs.</b> Critics lauded the game's graphics and simulated airspace, and several praised its physics. However, some considered the game to be inferior to Microsoft Flight Simulator '98. Following the completion of Flight Unlimited II, its team split up to develop Flight Unlimited III (1999) and Flight Combat (later Jane's Attack Squadron) simultaneously. Both projects were troubled, and they contributed to the closure of Looking Glass in May 2000.|$|E

Had it flown, the F-108 would have been the heaviest fighter of its era.|$|E
5|$|A port of {{the game}} for the PlayStation 3 was {{announced}} in April 2009. The port features full voice acting, containing nearly twice as much voice work as the original voice script, which covers previously unvoiced cutscenes in the 360 version. The game also features various new characters, has Flynn as a permanent playable character, and adds a new playable character {{in the form of}} Patty Fleur. Development on the port began in 2008, after the release of the original version. Speaking on why the port was being developed, a developer who worked on Vampire Rain said that companies like Namco Bandai first developed for the Xbox 360 due to superior funding and development support when compared to Sony, then ported to PS3 with minimal effort so they could recoup <b>development</b> <b>costs</b> and add features that needed to be cut from the original game.|$|E
