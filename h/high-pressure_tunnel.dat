A discussion of the boundary layer is followed by: relations between frictional and form drag, application to profile-drag measurements, and different kinds of roughness. <b>High-pressure</b> wind <b>tunnel</b> tests are discussed along with roughness and maximum lift...|$|R

Both wind tunnels are specialized facilities for high Reynolds number investigations and offer low turbulence levels. The wind tunnels are the cryogenic wind tunnel located in Cologne (KKK) {{and in the}} <b>high-pressure</b> wind <b>tunnel</b> located in Göttingen (HDG). Both facilities {{are part of the}} German–Dutch wind tunnel association (DNW). The adaptation and application of three optical measurement techniques for such high Reynolds number investigations is described in the article.

40|$|Wind loads on heliostats {{are usually}} {{determined}} at boundary layer, low-speed wind tunnels {{at which the}} design full-scale Reynolds number cannot be reached. In doing so, it is supposed the wind load coefficients are Reynolds number independent, which {{is known to be}} the case for sharp edged bodies. But for the stow position the usually round torque tube is directly exposed to the wind and could influence the wind loads. By measurements in a <b>high-pressure</b> wind <b>tunnel,</b> it can be demonstrated that the design-relevant wind load coefficients are not Reynolds number dependent. However, the inclination of the mirror plane in stow position, due to the deflection of the heliostats structure at high Reynolds number, leads to increased wind loads and must be considered. The results are also valid for photovoltaic trackers of similar shape...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} the forced convective heat loss from {{a model of}} a multi-MW cavity receiver of a concentrated solar power (CSP) tower system in a <b>high-pressure</b> wind <b>tunnel.</b> Measurements of 5 geometrical configurations of this model are reported in this contribution. The experiment covered a Reynolds number range of between 2 ⋅ 106 and 8 ⋅ 106, based on the external flow field. The results show that the maximum forced convective heat loss for all configurations occurs when the wind blows from frontal directions of between 60 ° and 80 ° relative to the tower symmetry plane. We found that the peak location does not vary for different inclinations, but does vary for different apertures. Also, the results show that the direction of the wind causes the forced convective heat loss to vary with a factor of up to 6. 3. Last but not least, we augmented the interpretation of our heat loss measurements with images produced with a Background-oriented Schlieren Imaging (BOS) setup...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the Reynolds-number dependent unsteady aerodynamic force and time-averaged local surface pressure distributions {{acting on a}} 2 D slightly rough circular cylinder up to high transcritical Reynolds numbers. The research {{was carried out in}} the <b>High-Pressure</b> Wind <b>Tunnel</b> (DNW-HDG) over a wide range of Reynolds numbers between 15 x 10 ^ 3 < Re < 12 x 10 ^ 6. The cylinder had a relative surface roughness of ks/D = 1. 2 x 10 ^- 3. The results demonstrated that especially in the critical regime the spanwise flow was strongly three-dimensional. Here, two discontinuities at two closely-spaced Reynolds numbers were observed, coupled with critical fluctuations in the lift force and the time-lagged formation of a separation bubble at each side of the cylinder. The presence of a slight surface roughness led to the disappearance of the supercritical regime, a subsequent strong recovery of the drag coefficient in the upper transition and intermediate steady plateaus for all aerodynamic properties in the transcritical state...|$|R
50|$|The {{information}} in a graph of this kind is gathered using {{a model of the}} airfoil in a wind tunnel. Because aircraft models are normally used, rather than full-size machines, special care is needed to make sure that data is taken in the same Reynolds number regime (or scale speed) as in free flight. The separation of flow from the upper wing surface at high angles of attack is quite different at low Reynolds number from that at the high Reynolds numbers of real aircraft. <b>High-pressure</b> wind <b>tunnels</b> are one solution to this problem. In general, steady operation of an aircraft at an angle of attack above the critical angle is not possible because, after exceeding the critical angle, the loss of lift from the wing causes the nose of the aircraft to fall, reducing the angle of attack again. This nose drop, independent of control inputs, indicates the pilot has actually stalled the aircraft.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} the forced convective heat loss from {{a model of}} a multi-MW cavity receiver of a concentrated solar power (CSP) tower system in a <b>high-pressure</b> wind <b>tunnel.</b> For the tests, arrays of a novel ringlike design of hot-film sensors were placed on the inside wall of the open cylindrical cavity. A constant temperature anemometry (CTA) system controlled these sensors and returned a signal {{as a function of the}} instantaneous total heat loss in each sensor. This heat loss was interpolated and averaged to form an integral heat loss value for each given set of wind speed and wind direction. The experiments covered a Reynolds number range of between 2 * 10 ^ 6 and 8 * 10 ^ 6, based on the external flow field. During the 10 days of testing, the ringlike hot-film sensors worked reliably and proved to deliver significant and reproducible results. The maximum forced convective heat loss for the tested geometry occurs at an incident angle of 70 °, at all tested Reynolds numbers...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} results of {{experiments}} carried out {{over a wide range}} of Reynolds numbers (10 ^ 4 <Re< 10 ^ 7) on 2 -D sections in the <b>high-pressure</b> wind <b>tunnel</b> in Göttingen. The bodies are circular cylinder, a sharp-edged, trapezoidal-shaped bridge element, and a thick airfoil at a high attack angle. In all cases, appropriately shifting the value of Re led to dramatic changes in the force coefficients and St. number. Changes in the topological structure of the separated flow cause the observed phenomena: oil-flow pictures were used to make the phenomena visible. These events, which are triggered by the laminar/turbulent transition and its location, have characteristics that appear to be universally valid because they occur in similar form in flow over the three different bodies. The important results are: (i) flow around 2 -D bodies can be highly three-dimensional; (ii) there are 2 -D sections that behave as a bluff- or streamlined body, depending on Re; and (iii) slender bodies with sharp-edged cross-sections may also suffer pronounced Reynolds-number effects...|$|R
40|$|The {{approach}} was {{to simulate the}} surface environment of Venus as closely as practicable and to conduct experiments to determine threshold wind speeds, particle flux, particle velocities, and the characteristics of various aeolian bedforms. The Venus Wind Tunnel (VWT) is described and the experimental procedures that were developed to make the <b>high-pressure</b> wind <b>tunnel</b> measurements are presented. In terrestrial simulations of aeolian activity, {{it is possible to}} conduct experiments under pressures and temperatures found in natural environments. Because of the high pressures and temperatures, Venusian simulations are difficult to achieve in this regard. Consequently, extrapolation of results to Venue potentially involves unknown factors. The experimental rationale was developed in the following way: The VWT enables the density of the Venusian atmosphere to be reproduced. Density is the principal atmospheric property for governing saltation threshold, particle flux, and the ballistics of airborne particles (equivalent density maintains dynamic similarity of gas flow). When operated at or near Earth's ambient temperature, VWT achieves Venusian atmospheric density at pressures of about 30 bar, or about one third less than those on Venus, although still maintaining dynamic similarity to Venus...|$|R
40|$|Founded in 1957, the Institute of Aeroelasticity in Göttingen {{is one of}} the 17 institutes {{focusing}} {{mainly on}} aeronautical research within the German Aerospace Center DLR. In our institute we combine experimental and numerical methods to predict aeroelastic phenomena that are the result of the interaction between aerodynamic and structural forces in an airflow. These aeroelastic phenomena do not only occur in the aeronautical and space field, e. g. aircrafts and space vehicles; they are also highly important for the civil engineering (bridges, tall buildings) and the wind power branches. Pertaining to all fields, the consistently present fluid-structure interaction may lead to critical dynamic phenomena and even to the destruction of the complete structure. To experimentally investigate the fluid-structure interaction even at the critical limit, challenging aeroelastic wind tunnel experiments are conducted at high transonic Mach numbers, under high total air pressure and/or at very low temperatures. These experiments mainly take place in the Transonic wind <b>tunnel</b> and <b>High-Pressure</b> wind <b>tunnel</b> in Göttingen and in the Cryogenic wind tunnel and the European Transonic wind tunnel in Cologne. The compiled results provide useful validation data for state-of-the-art numerical simulations, also performed at our institute. Highlights of the major projects from the multifunctional Aeroelastic Wind Tunnel Experimental Group are presented. These include the extensive experimental investigation of the wing-pylon-nacelle interaction in transonic flow; the project „Aerostabil“, in which the flutter behavior of a laminar airfoil was investigated for better physical understanding of the transonic flutter phenomena; the gust response of a laminar airfoil was studied in the „iGREEN“-project; the „IWEX/MEPHISTO“-project, to model the unsteady behavior of the vortex generation on low aspect ratio wings and the project „Panel Flutter“ in which the flutter behavior of a panel of a launcher’s upper stage is analyzed. In the <b>High-Pressure</b> Wind <b>tunnel</b> in Göttingen the air can be pressurized up to 100 bars to simulate Reynolds numbers as high as 12 million - close to full-scale. Here, fundamental research is mostly performed to investigate for example the influence of the Reynolds number on smooth and rough circular cylinder flows (e. g. telecommunication towers, bridge cables, antennas, etc.) and on the flow behavior around a rectangular cylinder with 1 : 5 aspect ratio. The research in this wind tunnel now starts to shift more and more in the direction of wind energy, in particular the aerodynamic behavior of wind turbine blades as function of the free stream Reynolds number and angle of incidence as well as their dynamic stall behavior...|$|R
40|$|Experiments {{were carried}} out in the <b>high-pressure</b> wind <b>tunnel</b> in Göttingen, where the Re. No. was varied from 5. 104 up to nearly 107 by means of {{pressurizing}} up to 100 bar. During the lecture two typical examples will be presented where the variation of the Re. No. leads to the drastic changes in the force coefficients and Strouhal number. The effects are caused by changes in the topology of the separated flow structures, which is shown by oil flow pictures. The forces were measured using a piezoelectric balance which is in particular suitable for aeroelastic investigations. The first example is flow around a 2 D-wing at a high angle of attack, where we observed a drastic decay of lift with increasing Re. No. The vortex shedding could be seen in the force signals (St = 0. 2). The second example is a sharp-edged bridge section (approach span from the Great Belt bridge). Contrary to the common assumption in wind engineering, that flow around bluff and sharp-edged bodies is independent of Re. No., we have found strong Re. No. effects. At high Re. No. near the prototype values (5 · 106) the Strouhal number is 20 % higher than at low Re. No. (5 · 104). The corresponding drag coefficients show the inverse behaviour, i. e. lower values for increasing Re. No. The physical reasons for the observed phenomena i. e. the Re. No. dependent location of laminar/turbulent transition will be discussed. It is planned to present a simple demonstration experiment of flow induced vibrations of a bridge section...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of the angle of incidence and corner radius on the aerodynamics of square-section cylinders is studied by means of wind tunnel experiments. Two different corner radii (r∕D= 0. 16 and 0. 29) were investigated at three angles of incidence (alpha= 0 deg, − 22. 5 deg and − 45 deg). Steady and unsteady global forces and local surface pressures were measured in the <b>high-pressure</b> wind <b>tunnel</b> in Göttingen. The Reynolds number was varied up to values as high as 12 x 10 ^ 6, thereby spanning the known flow state regimes up to high transcritical. The results demonstrated that a decrease of the cylinder’s bluffness induced lower maximum drag coefficients and r. m. s. values, as well as higher Strouhal numbers in all flow state regimes. Furthermore, the critical Reynolds numbers shifted to significantly lower values. For the cylinder configurations at alpha= 0 deg no upper transition or transcritical flow state was present up to ReD= 12 million. A decrease in the angle of incidence resulted in a significant reduction {{of the length of}} the supercritical flow state, a shift of the drag force, Strouhal number and base pressure to higher values and an increase of the critical Reynolds numbers. The cylinders at non-zero angles of incidence all displayed a clear critical flow state, at which two discontinuous transitions were observed, accompanied by jumps in the CD and CL values and the Strouhal number. Only three out of six studied configurations experienced hysteresis, where for the high corner radius configuration at alpha= 0 deg a particularly broad hysteresis effect was measured...|$|R
40|$|Force {{and surface}} {{pressure}} measurements on a 2 D rough circular cylinder {{were carried out}} {{over a wide range}} of Reynolds numbers in the <b>high-pressure</b> wind <b>tunnel</b> in Göttingen. The Reynolds number spanned values from subcritical up to high transcritical 15 × 103 ≤ Re ≤ 12 × 10 ^ 6. The cylinder had a mean relative surface roughness of ks/D = 1. 2 × 10 ^- 3. By means of piezoelectric balances the unsteady lift and drag forces were measured. The mean surface pressure distribution was obtained with the use of 59 static surface pressure tabs at various span-wise and circumferential locations on the cylinder. Statistical analysis of the time-dependent forces, in combination with the mean surface pressures, provided information on the spatial organization of the flow field properties around the cylinder as function of the Reynolds number. In the critical Reynolds regime two discontinuities at two separate Reynolds numbers were observed. They were accompanied by critical fluctuations in the lift force and the formation of a separation bubble at each side of the cylinder. The discontinuous jumps were initialized by a downstream movement of the separation point and an upstream movement of the transition point. The asymmetric flow field in-between both critical Reynolds numbers led to a steady lift force that was cancelled again after passing the second critical Reynolds number. At the latter Reynolds number the width of the wake and CD were minimum. In the super- and transcritical flow states the boundary layer separations took place at about the apex of the cylinder. In comparison to the subcritical and critical regimes all measured flow field properties reached intermediate steady plateaus in the transcritical state. For the Strouhal number this plateaus was at St = 0. 23, for the base pressure at Cp,base = - 0. 9 and for the drag coefficient at CD ≈ - 0. 84...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of the Reynolds number is for certain aeroelastic and aerodynamic phenomena of high significance, in particular in case the flow is dominated by massive separation areas, like bluff body flows. These kind of flows are broadly represented in our daily life, e. g. in the aerospace industry (landing gear doors, propeller blades of single turboprops or piston twin aircrafts during start or landing), civil engineering (overhead transmission lines, bridge decks, pillars of semi-submerged offshore structures) or in wind engineering (blade-tower interactions and deep dynamic stall). The structures are subject to fluid-structure interactions, which in many cases lead to flow-induced vibrations like galloping or flutter and, in case of large amplitudes, even to damage of parts {{or failure of the}} complete construction. In order to minimize or even suppress those undesired flow-induced vibrations, it is of great concern to understand in detail the unsteady three-dimensional flow characteristics around these structures. For that purpose a new test section was designed and built to be implemented inside the <b>High-Pressure</b> Wind <b>Tunnel</b> Gottingen, a test facility in which the air pressure can be increased up to 100 bar to simulate realistic flow conditions at Reynolds numbers up to 10 million. The test section consists out of two torque motors that are used to either set and maintain a steady angle of incidence within 0 and 359 deg or to let the two-dimensional wind tunnel model perform a forced pitching motion with amplitudes of up to +/- 15 deg at maximum pitching frequencies of 15 Hz (i. e. reduced frequencies of k 1) around a certain steady angle of incidence. A piezo-electric balance is placed {{at both ends of the}} model outside the test section in order to obtain the unsteady aerodynamic lift and drag forces and pitching moment The coupled fluid-structure responses of the wind tunnel models, having a span of 600 mm and a maximum chord length of 120 mm, can be obtained by a combination of the balances and up to 60 unsteady pressure sensors and accelerometers integrated in the model...|$|R
40|$|The flow around bluff bodies is {{determined}} by flow separations that result in a vortex street in their wake. Depending on the shape, the flow topology and the time dependent behaviour of the separation process can be strongly influenced by the Reynolds number, even if the bodies have sharp edges. The reason for this dependence {{is that the state}} of the boundary layer has a far-reaching influence on the entire flow field and its topological structure. In particular, the location of the laminar/turbulent transition in the boundary layer, or in the separated shear layer, is an important parameter. In general, changes in the topological structure of the separated flow can lead to dramatic changes in the steady and unsteady aerodynamic forces, acting on the body. The basic mechanisms, including their sensitivity to small perturbations, will be discussed using examples from flow around a circular and a rectangular cylinder as generic two-dimensional bluff bodies. It is well known that the Reynolds number dependence plays a dominant role for the circular cylinder; however the flow around a rectangular cylinder is often seen as Reynolds number independent, because of the sharp edges. This statement loses general validity when the separated flow has the possibility of reattachment, forming separation bubbles. The discussions of the basic phenomena are based on a series of experiments carried out over a wide range of Reynolds numbers from 104 up to 107 in the <b>high-pressure</b> wind <b>tunnel</b> in Göttingen. In addition to the circular and rectangular cylinders, a trapezoidal bridge section and a thick airfoil at a high attack angle were investigated. In all cases, appropriately shifting the value of Reynolds number led to dramatic changes in the force coefficients and the Strouhal number. Oil-flow pictures were used to make the changes in the topological structure of the separated flow visible. The changes in the flow are triggered by the laminar/turbulent transition and its location, and have characteristics that appear to be universally valid because they occur in similar form in flow over different bodies. Thus we can assume that a deeper insight will help to better understand flow separation effects in general. Although the presentation is focused on Reynolds number effects in incompressible flow, the influence of the Mach number will be examined, using the example of a circular cylinder. Finally the propensity of bluff bodies to flow-induced vibrations will be discussed and demonstrated by simple table experiments. ...|$|R
40|$|This semi-annual {{progress}} report includes our latest research on deep ocean sequestration of CO{sub 2 }-in-Water (C/W) emulsions stabilized by pulverized limestone (CaCO{sub 3 }). We describe a practical {{system that could}} be employed {{for the release of}} a dense C/W emulsion. The heart of the system is a Kenics-type static mixer. The testing and evaluation of a static mixer in the NETL <b>High-Pressure</b> Water <b>Tunnel</b> Facility was described in the previous semi-annual report. The release system could be deployed from a floating platform over the open ocean, or {{at the end of an}} off-shore pipe laying on the continental slope. Because the emulsion is much denser than ambient seawater, modeling shows that upon release the plume will sink much deeper from the injection point, increasing the sequestration time for CO{sub 2 }. When released in the open ocean, a plume containing the output of a 500 MW{sub el} coal-fired power plant will typically sink hundreds of meters below the injection point. When released from a pipe on the continental shelf, the plume will sink about twice as much because of the limited entrainment of ambient seawater when the plume flows along the sloping seabed. Furthermore, the plume is slightly alkaline, not acidic. The disadvantage is that the creation of the emulsion requires significant amounts of pulverized limestone, on the order of 0. 5 - 0. 75 weight ratio of limestone to CO{sub 2 }. While pulverized limestone with particle size appropriate for creating C/W emulsions can be purchased for $ 38 per ton, it is shown in this report that it may be more economic to purchase raw limestone from quarries and pulverize it in situ using grinding mills. In this case the major cost elements are the capital and operating costs of the grinding mills, resulting in a total cost of about $ 11 per ton of pulverized limestone, including the cost of raw material and shipping. Because we need approximately 0. 75 ton of pulverized limestone per ton of liquid CO 2 to create a stable C/W emulsion, the total cost of preparing the emulsion on site is about $ 8. 5 per ton of liquid CO{sub 2 }, not including the cost of the emulsion mixer. Currently, the cost estimates of capturing and liquefying CO{sub 2 } at a coal-fired power plant range from $ 15 to 75 /t CO{sub 2 }. Thus, the preparation of C/W emulsions stabilized by pulverized limestone particles would add about 10 to 50 % to the capture cost of CO{sub 2 }. At this juncture the primary research objectives of this Co-operative Agreement are shifting toward geologic sequestration of carbon dioxide. Experiments are underway to create micro-emulsions of CO{sub 2 }-in-Water (C/W) and Water-in-CO{sub 2 } (W/C) stabilized by ultrafine particles ranging from sub-micrometer to a few micrometer in size. Such microemulsions are expected to readily penetrate deep geologic formations, such as porous sedimentary layers, including saline aquifers and semi-depleted oil and gas fields. Injections of (C/W) and (W/C) type micro-emulsions may prove to be less prone to leakage from the formations compared to injections of neat liquid or supercritical CO{sub 2 }...|$|R
