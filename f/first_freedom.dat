25|$|Some of the <b>first</b> <b>freedom</b> suits, {{court cases}} in the British Isles to {{challenge}} the legality of slavery, took place in Scotland in 1755 and 1769. The cases were Montgomery v. Sheddan (1755) and Spens v. Dalrymple (1769). Each of the slaves had been baptized in Scotland and challenged the legality of slavery. They set the precedent of legal procedure in British courts that would later lead to successful outcomes for the plaintiffs. In these cases, deaths of the plaintiff and defendant, respectively, brought an end before court decisions.|$|E
25|$|The <b>first</b> <b>freedom</b> suit in St. Louis {{was filed}} in 1805 by Marguerite Scypion, an African-Natchez woman. Briefly, she filed based on {{maternal}} descent from her Natchez grandmother. As the Spanish had ended Indian slavery in 1769, Scypion held that her mother, Marie-Jean Scypion, {{should have been}} freed at the time based on her Natchez ancestry, and that Marguerite herself was illegally held as a slave from birth. Having had an earlier ruling in her favor overturned on appeal, in 1826 Marguerite Scypion renewed her suit for freedom, filing against her current master Jean Pierre Chouteau, who headed {{one of the most}} prominent fur trading families in the city. She gained freedom for herself and all her mother's descendants in 1836, in a decision upheld by the US Supreme Court.|$|E

The province's <b>first</b> <b>Freedom</b> of Information and Protection of Privacy Act was also passed. During this time Prince Edward Island launched Waste Watch, becoming the first Canadian province to offer waste management services to every home and business resulting in a 65% waste diversion rate and closure of many community landfills.

500|$|Meanwhile, {{the village}} of Mount Morris had already decided to hold their own bell-ringing during the village's annual Independence Day festival, the [...] "Let Freedom Ring". Subsequently, on April 30, 1963, Illinois native and rising Republican {{political}} star Ronald Reagan visited Mount Morris to dedicate the first Mount Morris freedom bell, which now hangs at the Veterans' Memorial Fountain. The <b>first</b> <b>freedom</b> bell was a small 16inch (40.6cm) bell. Later, as U.S. President in 1984, Reagan was presented with {{a replica of the}} official Illinois Freedom Bell in the Oval Office by U.S. Representative Lynn Morley Martin. The first national bell-ringing took place on July 4, 1963; Mount Morris also participated in that ringing. Even though many states sponsored bell-ringings, Hatch and Sloane both credited Mount Morris with making their suggestion a reality.|$|E
500|$|Some {{slaves were}} allowed to earn wages, and some were able to save money to {{purchase}} their freedom or that of relatives. Others were manumitted, which occurred relatively more frequently in St. Louis than in the surrounding rural areas. Still others attempted to escape via the Underground Railroad or attempted to gain their freedom through freedom suits. The <b>first</b> <b>freedom</b> suit in St. Louis was filed by Marguerite Scypion in 1805. More than 300 suits were filed in St. Louis before the Civil War. Among the most famous was that of Dred Scott and his wife Harriet, in a case heard at the Old Courthouse. The suit was based on their having traveled and lived with their master in free states. Although the state ruled in his favor, {{an appeal to the}} U.S. Supreme Court resulted in an 1857 ruling against them. [...] The Court ruled that slaves could not be counted as citizens, overturning the basis of the Missouri Compromise and inflaming national debate about slavery.|$|E

500|$|Many Northern cities {{also had}} de facto {{segregation}} policies, {{which resulted in}} a vast gulf in educational resources between black and white communities. In Harlem, New York, for example, not a single new school had been built {{since the turn of the}} century, nor did a single nursery school exist, even as the Second Great Migration caused overcrowding of existing schools. Existing schools tended to be dilapidated and staffed with inexperienced teachers. Northern officials were in denial of the segregation, but Brown helped stimulate activism among African-American parents like Mae Mallory who, with support of the NAACP, initiated a successful lawsuit against the city and State of New York on Browns principles. Mallory and thousands of other parents bolstered the pressure of the lawsuit with a school boycott in 1959. During the boycott, some of the <b>first</b> <b>freedom</b> schools of the period were established. The city responded to the campaign by permitting more open transfers to high-quality, historically-white schools. (New York's African-American community, and Northern desegregation activists generally, now found themselves contending with the problem of white flight, however.) ...|$|E

2500|$|... 1805–1836, Marguerite Scypion v. Pierre Chouteau, Sr.. Marguerite, {{daughter}} of Marie Jean Scypion, an enslaved woman of Natchez-African descent, sued her first master Joseph Tayon's son François Tayon (who inherited her {{when his father}} died) in 1805. Her suit was based on her maternal descent from a Natchez maternal grandmother. She held that her own mother was illegally held as a slave after Spain abolished Indian slavery in its territories in 1769. Her children, including Marguerite, should have been considered free at birth and not born into slavery. This was the <b>first</b> <b>freedom</b> suit filed in St. Louis and was heard shortly after the US acquired the Louisiana Territory from France. Although the jury ruled in Scypion's favor, a higher territorial court overturned the decision.|$|E

2500|$|... 1824, Winny v. Whitesides. This is the <b>first</b> <b>freedom</b> suit in Missouri {{taken to}} the newly {{established}} state supreme court. Winny had been held as a slave for years by her masters {{in the free state}} of Illinois; she filed for freedom after they moved to Missouri. The case {{marked the beginning of the}} [...] "once free, always free" [...] era in Missouri. The Missouri Supreme Court ruled that if a slave had been taken by masters into an area that prohibited slavery, that slave was free – even if later returned to a slave state, such as Missouri. Missouri established a precedent of enforcing the laws of neighboring free states and territories related to forfeiture of illegally held slaves. [...] "Courts in Kentucky, Louisiana and Mississippi also upheld the freedom of slaves who had lived in a free state or territory." [...] The precedent prevailed in Missouri until 1852, when the state Supreme Court ruled against it in Dred Scott v. Sanford, against a political background of increasing sectional tensions over slavery.|$|E

2500|$|... 1656, Elizabeth Key v. Humphrey Higginson. Elizabeth Key {{filed the}} <b>first</b> <b>freedom</b> suit {{by a woman}} of African descent and won as a free woman {{of color in the}} Virginia colony. The mixed-race child of an enslaved black mother and white English planter Thomas Key, she sued for her freedom and that of her infant son, John Grinstead, on the basis that her late father had been a free English subject, she was a baptized Christian, and she had served ten years past the term of her indenture. (Facing death, her father had {{arranged}} a guardian and indenture for her.) In English common law, children of English subjects took the status of the father (partuus sequitur patrem). But, at this time Africans were not considered English subjects but foreigners. England had no provision for foreigners to become subjects. In {{the early years of the}} colony, the law was unsettled about the status of children born to an English subject and a foreigner. Taunya Lovell Banks suggests in her analysis that the issue of [...] "subjecthood" [...] was more important to the colonial authorities than ideas about citizenship or race.|$|E

This is, as I say, the <b>first</b> <b>freedom</b> that I claim: the freedom to restore. I claim a right to propose as a solution the old patriarchal system of a Highland clan, if that should seem to eliminate the largest number of evils. It certainly would eliminate some evils; for instance, the unnatural sense of obeying cold and harsh strangers, mere bureaucrats and policemen. I claim the right to propose the complete independence of the small Greek or Italian towns, a sovereign city of Brixton or Brompton, if that seems the best way out of our troubles. It would be a way out of some of our troubles; we could not have in a small state, for instance, those enormous illusions about men or measures which are nourished by the great national or international newspapers. You could not persuade a city state that Mr. Beit was an Englishman, or Mr. Dillon a desperado, any more than you could persuade a Hampshire Village that the village drunkard was a teetotaller or the village idiot a statesman. Nevertheless, I do not as a fact propose that the Browns and the Smiths should be collected under separate tartans. Nor do I even propose that Clapham should declare its independence. I merely declare my independence. I merely claim my choice of all the tools in the universe; and I shall not admit that any of them are blunted merely because they have been used.|$|E
