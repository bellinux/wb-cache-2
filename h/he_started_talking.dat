2500|$|When {{anxiety over}} Communism in Korea and China reached a fever pitch, an {{otherwise}} obscure Senator, Joe McCarthy of Wisconsin, launched extremely high-visibility {{investigations into the}} alleged network of communist spies in the government. Irish Catholics (including Buckley and the Kennedy Family) were intensely anti-communist and supported McCarthy (a fellow Irish Catholic). Paterfamilias Joseph Kennedy (1888–1969), a leading conservative Democrat, was an ardent supporter of McCarthy, and got his son Robert F. Kennedy a job with McCarthy. McCarthy's careless tactics, however, allowed his opponents to effectively counterattack. McCarthy talked of [...] "twenty years of treason" [...] (i.e. since Roosevelt's election in 1932). In 1953 <b>he</b> <b>started</b> <b>talking</b> of [...] "21 years of treason" [...] and launched a major attack on the Army for promoting a communist dentist in the medical corps; this {{was too much for}} Eisenhower, who encouraged Republicans to censure McCarthy formally in 1954. The Senator's power collapsed overnight. Senator John F. Kennedy did not vote for censure.|$|E
