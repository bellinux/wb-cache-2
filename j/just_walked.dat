Typically a potential customer <b>just</b> <b>walked</b> {{into the main}} office in Helsinki or factory in Hämeenlinna and described what kind of vehicle he wanted. The enthusiastic engineers listened carefully to every individual customer's wishes and designed vehicles accordingly, {{with two or three}} axles, desired layout, wheelbase and with conventional or forward control cabin. Many vehicle types were only produced for one or two units. The volume model, however, was a nine-tonne variant of the VAK series.|$|E
5|$|Joe Mallett {{presided over}} relegation before acting as {{assistant}} to Stan Cullis, who laid {{the foundations for}} the team's future success before retiring from football in 1970. Chosen only after abortive approaches were made to Don Revie, Brian Clough and Ronnie Allen, Freddie Goodwin converted the attractive but inconsistent football of Cullis's teams to a skilful, aggressive game capable of winning promotion and maintaining top-flight status. The side struggled after Goodwin sold Bob Latchford, so first-team coach Willie Bell was promoted to manager, initially in a caretaker capacity. After achieving little in two years, Bell was replaced by club director Sir Alf Ramsey, whose brief managerial tenure ended with him leaving the club entirely. Jim Smith brought experienced players to the club but was sacked {{to make way for}} Ron Saunders, who had <b>just</b> <b>walked</b> out on league champions and local rivals Aston Villa.|$|E

After the match, El Consejo attacked Octagón, before being chased away by La Parka. La Parka then tried to convince Octagón to leave La Sociedad and re-join him, but Octagón instead <b>just</b> <b>walked</b> out. After La Parka also left the ringside area, El Consejo returned and attacked Los Psycho Circus.|$|E

25|$|Concurrently {{with the}} siege in 749, the Abbasids crossed the Euphrates and took Kufa. The son of Khalid al-Qasri – a disgraced Umayyad {{official}} {{who had been}} tortured to death a few years prior – began a pro-Abbasid riot starting at the city's citadel. On September 2, 749, al-Hasan bin Qahtaba essentially <b>just</b> <b>walked</b> right in {{to the city and}} set up shop. Some confusion followed when Abu Salama, an Abbasid officer, pushed for an Alid leader. Abu Muslim's confidante Abu Jahm reported what was happening, and the Abbasids acted preemptively. On Friday, November 28, 749, before the siege of Wasit had even finished, As-Saffah, the great-grandson of Muhammad's uncle, al-Abbas, was recognized as the new caliph in the mosque at Kufa. Abu Salama, who witnessed twelve military commanders from the revolution pledging allegiance, was embarrassed into following suit.|$|E
25|$|The defense's {{position}} weakened when, on November 28, Darrow {{was accused}} of orchestrating to bribe a prospective juror. The juror reported the offer to police, who set up a sting and observed the defense team's chief investigator, Bert Franklin, delivering $4,000 to the juror two blocks away from Darrow's office. After making payment, Franklin walked one block {{in the direction of}} Darrow's office before being arrested right in front of Darrow himself, who had <b>just</b> <b>walked</b> to that very intersection after receiving a phone call in his office. With Darrow himself {{on the verge of being}} discredited, the defense's hope for a simple plea agreement ended. On December 1, 1911, the McNamara brothers changed their pleas to guilty, in open court. The plea bargain Darrow helped arrange earned John fifteen years and James life imprisonment. Despite sparing the brothers the death penalty, Darrow was accused by many in organized labor of selling the movement out.|$|E

Jerry Ray said that he had assisted his brother on one such robbery. [...] "I never been with nobody as bold as he is," [...] Jerry said.

In May 1995, he introduced the group to Paul Wilson and Andy Watkins—the songwriters and production duo known as Absolute.

They quoted a woman who had seen either the lynching or its aftermath, and who said that Laura had placed the baby on the ground: [...] "After they had hung them up, those men <b>just</b> <b>walked</b> off and left that baby lying there.

The autopsy and toxicology report on Staley's body revealed that he died from a mixture of heroin and cocaine, known as [...] "speedball". The autopsy concluded that Staley died on April 5, two weeks before his body was found. Cantrell dedicated his 2002 solo album, Degradation Trip, released two months after Staley's death, to his memory. Mike Starr later claimed on Celebrity Rehab that he was the last person to see Staley alive, and admitted to feeling guilty about not calling 911 after Staley had warned him against it.

They had also recorded demos of two songs written by guitarist Sylvain Sylvain, [...] "Teenage News" [...] and [...] "Too Much Too Soon", before working with Morton, but neither were considered for the album. Sylvain said he confronted Morton about this decision, recalling {{he had been in}} a rush: [...] "He was too quick with me and said that he'd been told only to listen to David Johansen and Johnny Thunders.

500|$|From the start, Wilson {{envisioned a}} theremin for the track. AllMusic {{reviewer}} John Bush pointed out: [...] "Radio listeners could easily {{pick up the}} link between the title and the obviously electronic riffs sounding in the background of the chorus, but Wilson's use of the theremin added another delicious parallel—between the single's theme and its use of an instrument the player never even touched." [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] does not technically feature a theremin, but rather an Electro-Theremin, which is physically controlled by a knob {{on the side of the}} instrument. It was dubbed a [...] "theremin" [...] simply for convenience. At that time, theremins were most often associated with the 1945 Alfred Hitchcock film Spellbound, but its most common presence was in the theme music for the television sitcom My Favorite Martian, which ran from 1963 to 1966. Britz speculates: [...] "He <b>just</b> <b>walked</b> in and said, 'I have this new sound for you.' I think he must have heard the sound somewhere and loved it, and built a song around it." ...|$|E

Two months were spent in New York, with all the city's five boroughs being used. Approximately fifty to sixty locations were set in Harlem alone. While in the neighbourhood, Scott stated that he found several interiors that had been untouched since the 1940s. According to production designer Arthur Max, exhaustive location scouting was done to find parts of New York that could still resemble the city of the early 1970s, filming Lucas' headquarters at 116th Street 20 blocks north, on 136th Street. In his interview with ComingSoon.net, Scott stated that [...] " [...] <b>just</b> <b>walked</b> in [...] and [...] just shot in the house." [...] Several gas masks were brought by producers due to health hazards and sanitary concerns existing in the buildings. Scott found filming in Harlem to be difficult, commenting that the rapid gentrification in Harlem provided poor opportunities for shooting angles. Hand-held cameras were extensively used to depict a [...] "guerrilla filmmaking" [...] style.|$|E
