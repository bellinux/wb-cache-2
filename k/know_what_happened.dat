5|$|Next, the metamorphosed Precambrian {{basement}} rocks were uplifted and {{a nearly}} 500-million-year-long {{gap in the}} geologic record, a major unconformity, affected the region. Geologists do not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> to the eroded sediment that must have overlain the complex, but they do know that regional uplift was responsible; the area was originally {{below the surface of}} a shallow sea.|$|E

5|$|Many fans of {{the show}} were outraged when Mercedes was {{supposedly}} murdered by Freddie Roscoe in November 2014, just a week after her sister Carmel died in a train crash. However, Jennifer Metcalfe stated that: 'Mercedes's departure is totally shrouded in mystery. Running up to the week where she exits, she has really annoyed pretty much everyone in the village, so it's 'who's done it?'. The story line was billed as a complete mystery, as the viewers don't completely <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> between Mercedes and her killer on {{the night at the}} McQueen house, or whether or not she was actually dead.|$|E
5|$|The {{fate of the}} {{original}} letter given to Bixby is unknown. William A. Bixby, a son of Oliver, told The New York Times in an August 9, 1925 interview {{that he did not}} <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> to the letter after his grandmother received it, though he doubted it still survived. A few days later, William's sister, Mrs. Towers told the Boston Herald that she also did not know the letter's fate but speculated Bixby may have torn it up, resenting that it incorrectly said five of her sons had been killed. William's son, Arthur March Bixby, told the New York Sun in 1949 that he recalled his father telling him that she had angrily destroyed the letter after receiving it.|$|E

A trunk appears in the water and Anna and Kristoff emerge as Gerda's message in the bottle for her daughters appears ashore on the beach, but goes unnoticed.|$|E

Fronsac is shown traveling to Senegal with Marianne {{to start a new life}} together, scattering Mani's ashes at sea.

25|$|Emma, Hook {{and their}} guest return to see Rumplestiltskin {{in the hopes}} that he can open the time portal, but instead he tells them that only they can re-open it because only the people who came through the portal can re-open it, but they need to wield magic. Rumple gives Emma a wand and tells her to open the portal if she has magic, but she doesn't think she can. Rumple decides he’d rather forget {{everything}} he’s learned so as not to alter his future, then he sends Emma and Hook to a dark vault where he keeps dangerous and unpredictable magic, where their Storybrooke outfits are restored. Hook says that Emma still has some magic in her and after seeing what happened to her parents and realizing everything Henry did to bring her to Storybrooke, she's ready to return home. Hook and Emma then notice the wand lights up with magic and open up the portal, allowing Hook and the woman to escape first. Before she can leave, Rumple holds on to Emma and demands to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> to Baelfire/Neal. Emma tells him what happened, then she begs him not to take away the fact he died a hero. Rumplestiltskin drinks the forgetting potion and lets go of Emma where she is pulled into the portal, which sends her, Hook, and the woman back to Storybrooke.|$|E

[...] Good Morning America anchor Chris Cuomo was unapologetic of his program's extensive coverage of the Holloway case.

He met a One Life to Live casting director two years previously, while performing in a New York play, but, when the role of Todd opened up, he [...] "auditioned just like everybody else".

500|$|Lamont {{has said}} that Labour lost the 2011 Scottish Parliament {{election}} because the party lost its direction, and that having failed to recognise the 2007 result as a defeat, it picked up the wrong signals from the 2010 general election that saw a strong Scottish Labour vote at Westminster. In February 2012 she told the Times Educational Supplement, [...] "We misread the 2010 (general) election, thinking it was confirmation that Scotland was a Labour country– it was probably confirmation that Scotland was still anti-Tory. There's an issue about rebuilding trust, and our confidence in the values that brought us into politics." [...] She told delegates at her party's 2012 Scottish conference {{that it was time}} for them to stop apologising for past mistakes. [...] "We <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> last May – we looked tired and complacent and we got the kind of beating we deserved. But now, we need to start building the kind of Scottish Labour Party which Scotland deserves and which Scotland needs." ...|$|E
500|$|Some sources {{describe}} {{the subjects of}} Lichtenstein's tragic girls series as heroines (in {{the sense that they}} are the counterparts to the heroes), and others do not (in the sense that they are not heroic). Drowning Girl is a painting of a female subject who would prefer to give in {{to the power of the}} ocean than call for aid. Lichtenstein's version of the scene eliminates everything but the sea and a few body parts of the subject: her head, shoulder and hand, which are barely above the water. As her face is presented her eyes are shut with drops of what appear to be tears flowing from them. Because Lichtenstein only presents a single frame, the viewer does not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> before this moment and what is going to happen after it. [...] Furthermore, the viewer has no way to know who Brad is and why she is so reluctant to call him.|$|E
