40|$|Achieving a plasma sprayed {{cast iron}} coating {{containing}} graphite requires stringent control on spray parameters that synergistically influence the coating properties {{and thus the}} performance. The microstructure of cast iron splats greatly depends on spray parameters such as substrate temperature, <b>chamber</b> <b>pressure,</b> and spray distance. This paper presents the effect of <b>chamber</b> <b>pressure</b> on the splat microstructure, including oxides and graphite. At low <b>chamber</b> <b>pressures,</b> most splats exhibit a disk shape with high flattening ratios, whereas star-shaped splats extensively appear at <b>high</b> <b>chamber</b> <b>pressures.</b> Spraying at <b>high</b> <b>chamber</b> <b>pressures</b> causes the formation of pores and thick oxide zones at the splat/substrate interface, mainly due to the atmospheric gases, which are responsible for a decrease in splat adhesion. Spraying in Ar atmosphere reduces the splat oxidation due to {{a decrease in the}} oxygen partial pressure. Small deformed substrate ridges are observed adjacent to the periphery of splats sprayed at low <b>chamber</b> <b>pressures</b> whereas no ridges are detected at <b>high</b> <b>chamber</b> <b>pressures.</b> Ridge formation generates a kind of mechanical bond, which increases the adhesive strength. Since the molten droplets impinge with high velocity and thus high flattening ratio at low <b>chamber</b> <b>pressures,</b> the solidification rate becomes faster, and graphite formation is resultantly hindered...|$|R
