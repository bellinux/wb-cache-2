Policymaking in the electricity sector involves economic, social, and environmental considerations. Ontario's electricity supply outlook is projected to deteriorate in the near future due to increasing demand, aging electricity supply infrastructure, and political commitments, particularly the phase-out of coal-fired generation. Policymakers are presented with a range of policy choices in addressing the situation, both in terms of overall system <b>design</b> <b>and</b> <b>structure,</b> and specific electricity generating technologies.|$|E
500|$|The present <b>design</b> <b>and</b> <b>structure</b> of {{the fort}} traces its origins to 1575, when the Mughal Emperor Akbar {{occupied}} the site as a post to guard the northwest frontier of the empire. The strategic location of Lahore, [...] between the Mughal territories and the strongholds of Kabul, Multan, and Kashmir necessitated {{the dismantling of the}} old mud-fort and fortification with solid brick masonry. Lofty palaces were built over time, along with lush gardens. Notable Akbar period structures included the Doulat Khana-e-Khas-o-Am, Jharoka-e-Darshan, and Akbari Gate. Many Akbari structures were modified or replaced by subsequent rulers.|$|E

40|$|Large {{and complex}} {{software}} systems contain a varietyofentities #objects# and a complex control system #transformation function#. The pure object-oriented <b>design</b> <b>and</b> <b>structured</b> <b>design</b> approaches concentrate on either objects or the transformation function separately. As such {{they may not}} be adequate in isolation, to deal with the design of complex systems. Therefore, it makes sense to study their combination. In this paper we propose a Combined Functional <b>and</b> Object-Oriented <b>Design</b> approach #CFOOD# based on the extended object-oriented design method proposed by P. Jalote. The CFOOD approach makes full use of the object-oriented <b>design</b> <b>and</b> <b>structured</b> <b>design</b> techniques combining the object view and the functional view to provide a more complete view of a system. We demonstrate the use of our approachby a design example of a hospital patient monitoring system.

The distant wooded shore of Contra Costa, the tossing white-caps and dancing sails of the bay between, and the {{foreground}} at his feet of wharves and piers, with their reed-like jungles of masts and cordage, made up a bright, if somewhat material, picture. To his right rose the crest of the hill, historic and memorable as the site of the old semaphoric telegraph, the tossing of whose gaunt arms formerly thrilled the citizens with tidings from the sea. Turning to the house, he recognized the prevailing style of light cottage architecture, although incongruously confined to narrow building plots and the civic regularity of a precise street frontage. Thus a dozen other villas, formerly scattered over the slope, had been laboriously displaced and moved to the rigorous parade line drawn by the street surveyor, no matter how irregular and independent their <b>design</b> <b>and</b> <b>structure.</b> Happily, the few scrub-oaks and low bushes which formed the scant vegetation of this vast sand dune offered no obstacle and suggested no incongruity. Beside the house before which Mr. Bly now stood, a prolific Madeira vine, quickened by the six months' sunshine, had alone survived the displacement of its foundations, and in its untrimmed luxuriance half hid the upper veranda from his view.|$|E

Although {{a number of}} theories and models promote effective digital pedagogy, there is little research on how design of VLS's contributes to the extraneous cognitive load impacting on students' ability {{to focus on the}} intrinsic content and germane learning activities. This action research investigates first year nursing students' experience of online learning and their effort to navigate the human-computer interface. Action research was chosen to monitor, inform and adjust the VLS of a new course using three consecutive online surveys. Results provided baseline demographic data on the respondents' initial experience with VLS's and their recommendations for changes to improve the student VLS experience. Findings indicate a strong desire for consistent VLS screen <b>design</b> <b>and</b> <b>structured</b> information architecture for ease of navigation. Respondents preferred consistent VLS screen <b>design</b> <b>and</b> <b>structured</b> navigation schema for the explicit and considered placement of course learning material, social learning tools and associated activities. ...|$|R
