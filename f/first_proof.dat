5|$|Also around 1995, Kontsevich {{analyzed}} {{the results of}} Candelas, which gave a general formula for the problem of counting rational curves on a quintic threefold, and he reformulated these results as a precise mathematical conjecture. In 1996, Alexander Givental posted a paper that claimed to prove this conjecture of Kontsevich. Initially, many mathematicians found this paper hard to understand, so there were doubts about its correctness. Subsequently, Bong Lian, Kefeng Liu, and Shing-Tung Yau published an independent proof {{in a series of}} papers. Despite controversy over who had published the <b>first</b> <b>proof,</b> these papers are now collectively seen as providing a mathematical proof of the results originally obtained by physicists using mirror symmetry. In 2000, Kentaro Hori and Cumrun Vafa gave another physical proof of mirror symmetry based on T-duality.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} Lithuania between 1219 and 1295 {{concerns}} {{the establishment and}} early history of the first Lithuanian state, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The beginning of the 13th century {{marks the end of}} the prehistory of Lithuania. From this point on the history of Lithuania is recorded in chronicles, treaties, and other written documents. In 1219, 21 Lithuanian dukes signed a peace treaty with Galicia–Volhynia. This event is widely accepted as the <b>first</b> <b>proof</b> that the Baltic tribes were uniting and consolidating. Despite continuous warfare with two Christian orders, the Livonian Order and the Teutonic Knights, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was established and gained some control over the lands of Black Ruthenia, Polatsk, Minsk, and other territories east of modern-day Lithuania that had become weak and vulnerable after the collapse of Kievan Rus'.|$|E

25|$|The <b>first</b> <b>proof</b> of this theorem {{was given}} by Max Born and Vladimir Fock, in Zeitschrift für Physik 51, 165 (1928). The concept of this theorem deals with the {{time-dependent}} Hamiltonian (which {{might be called a}} subject of quantum dynamics), where the Hamiltonian changes with time.|$|E
25|$|The {{critical}} {{strip of}} the Riemann zeta function has the remarkable property of universality. This zeta-function universality states that there exists some {{location on the}} critical strip that approximates any holomorphic function arbitrarily well. Since holomorphic functions are very general, this property is quite remarkable. The <b>first</b> <b>proof</b> of universality was provided by Sergei Mikhailovitch Voronin in 1975. More recent work has included effective versions of Voronin's theorem and extending it to Dirichlet L-functions.|$|E
25|$|Cantor's <b>first</b> <b>proof</b> that {{infinite}} sets {{can have}} different cardinalities {{was published in}} 1874. This proof demonstrates that the set of natural numbers and the set of real numbers have different cardinalities. It uses the theorem that a bounded increasing sequence of real numbers has a limit, which can be proved by using Cantor's or Richard Dedekind's construction of the irrational numbers. Because Leopold Kronecker did not accept these constructions, Cantor was motivated {{to develop a new}} proof.|$|E

25|$|A {{generalization}} {{of the concept}} of Pythagorean triples is the search for triples of positive integers a, b, and c, such that , for some n strictly greater than 2. Pierre de Fermat in 1637 claimed that no such triple exists, a claim that {{came to be known as}} Fermat's Last Theorem because it took longer than any other conjecture by Fermat to be proven or disproven. The <b>first</b> <b>proof</b> was given by Andrew Wiles in 1994.|$|E

25|$|In mathematics, {{analytic}} {{number theory}} is {{a branch of}} number theory that uses methods from mathematical analysis to solve problems about the integers. It is often said to have begun with Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet's 1837 introduction of Dirichlet L-functions to give the <b>first</b> <b>proof</b> of Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions. It {{is well known for}} its results on prime numbers (involving the Prime Number Theorem and Riemann zeta function) and additive number theory (such as the Goldbach conjecture and Waring's problem).|$|E

25|$|Hermite's theorem predates {{the general}} {{definition}} of the discriminant with Charles Hermite publishing a proof of it in 1857. In 1877, Alexander von Brill determined {{the sign of the}} discriminant. Leopold Kronecker first stated Minkowski's theorem in 1882, though the <b>first</b> <b>proof</b> was given by Hermann Minkowski in 1891. In the same year, Minkowski published his bound on the discriminant. Near {{the end of the nineteenth}} century, Ludwig Stickelberger obtained his theorem on the residue of the discriminant modulo four.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the region}} lies on {{sedimentary}} rock, with sandstone, mudstone and limestone deposited on an ancient sea floor between 1000 million and 600 million years ago during the Proterozoic. The youngest rocks {{in the region are}} in deposits laid down during the Cambrian period (600 to 500 million years ago) when fossils first appeared in the record. Fossils in the Normanville Group of rocks, which outcrop on the coast from Myponga Beach to Carrickalinga, were the <b>first</b> <b>proof</b> of Cambrian-age rocks in the Mount Lofty Ranges.|$|E
25|$|The Mint pressed two <b>first</b> <b>proof</b> samples on , {{when the}} Romanovs had already {{resolved}} the succession crisis {{in favor of}} Nicholas. Actual number of Constantine rubles is debated. According to Ivan Spassky, there were only five. According to studies by Bartoshevich and Valentin Yanin, there were six Constantine rubles with proper edge lettering, {{and one of them}} was lost without trace. Yanin suggested that the sixth missing coin was appropriated by Cancrin himself. The three known coins without edge lettering (Schubert ruble, Richter ruble and Fuchs ruble) were, most likely, illegally retained by the Mint employees or their superiors.|$|E

25|$|For each theorem {{that can}} be stated in the base system but is not provable in the base system, {{the goal is to}} {{determine}} the particular axiom system (stronger than the base system) that is necessary to prove that theorem. To show that a system S is required to prove a theorem T, two proofs are required. The <b>first</b> <b>proof</b> shows T is provable from S; this is an ordinary mathematical proof along with a justification that it can be carried out in the system S. The second proof, known as a reversal, shows that T itself implies S; this proof is carried out in the base system. The reversal establishes that no axiom system S that extends the base system can be weaker than S while still provingT.|$|E
25|$|Until {{the twentieth}} century {{it was assumed that}} any proof could, in principle, be checked by a {{competent}} mathematician to confirm its validity. However, computers are now used both to prove theorems and to carry out calculations that are too long for any human or team of humans to check; the <b>first</b> <b>proof</b> of the four color theorem {{is an example of a}} computer-assisted proof. Some mathematicians are concerned that the possibility of an error in a computer program or a run-time error in its calculations calls the validity of such computer-assisted proofs into question. In practice, the chances of an error invalidating a computer-assisted proof can be reduced by incorporating redundancy and self-checks into calculations, and by developing multiple independent approaches and programs. Errors can never be completely ruled out in case of verification of a proof by humans either, especially if the proof contains natural language and requires deep mathematical insight.|$|E
25|$|The singular-value {{decomposition}} {{was originally}} developed by differential geometers, {{who wished to}} determine whether a real bilinear form could be made equal to another by independent orthogonal transformations of the two spaces it acts on. Eugenio Beltrami and Camille Jordan discovered independently, in 1873 and 1874 respectively, that the singular values of the bilinear forms, represented as a matrix, form a complete set of invariants for bilinear forms under orthogonal substitutions. James Joseph Sylvester also arrived at the singular-value decomposition for real square matrices in 1889, apparently independently of both Beltrami and Jordan. Sylvester called the singular values the canonical multipliers of the matrix A. The fourth mathematician to discover the singular value decomposition independently is Autonne in 1915, who arrived at it via the polar decomposition. The <b>first</b> <b>proof</b> of the singular value decomposition for rectangular and complex matrices seems to be by Carl Eckart and Gale Young in 1936; they saw it as a generalization of the principal axis transformation for Hermitian matrices.|$|E
