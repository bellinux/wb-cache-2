5000|$|The {{preserved}} Bell and Tainter {{records are}} {{of both the}} lateral cut and the Edison-style hill-and-dale (up-and-down) styles. Edison for many years used the [...] "hill-and-dale" [...] method on both his cylinders and Diamond Disc records, and Emile Berliner is credited with {{the invention of the}} lateral cut, acid-etched Gramophone record in 1887. The Volta associates, however, had been experimenting with both formats and directions of <b>groove</b> <b>modulation</b> as early as 1881.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, {{engineers}} Gerry Block and Burgess Macneal devised a preview system of mastering vinyl which allowed about 10-20% more music per disc while not sacrificing dynamic range. The preview tape head was positioned far enough {{before the program}} tape head to allow the disk computer enough time to measure the peaks in low frequency and thereby expand the feed appropriately for the greater excursions of <b>groove</b> <b>modulation</b> they produce. The ne-plus-ultra Compudisk system was unveiled at the 1980 AES Convention, alongside the Zuma Disk Computer (made by John W. Bittner) and the Neumann VMS-80 lathe, which had its own advanced Disk Computer, on board.|$|E
5000|$|Why E-Pea? Well, it's an EP of course; {{the modern}} {{equivalent}} {{of one of}} those 7" [...] records of yesteryear with four tracks on it, the <b>groove</b> <b>modulation</b> too small to offer {{much in the way of}} audio fidelity, but a satisfying object nonetheless. Many years ago, Island Records issued a [...] "sampler disc". A 12" [...] LP record with a selection of some their artists' works. A promotional tool to get obscure acts known off the back of the big sellers. In this case it was a double album and headliners like Traffic, ELP, Jethro Tull and Fairport Convention were included to entice buyers to listen to unknowns like Mountain, Bronco and Nick Drake. In the case of poor old talented-but-awkwardly-shy Nick it didn't work, and he sold hardly any records at all. Until he was dead. They called it [...] "El Pea". Much later, the Acid-House movement pioneered by the likes of Baby Ford and 808-State invented drugs which looked like small aspirins which you had to take with lots of water whilst wearing a t-shirt with a Smiley face on it which sent you bonkers whenever you listened to dance music. They called it [...] "E".|$|E
40|$|A {{scanning}} {{system has been}} developed for measuring the surface of early cylinder mechanical sound recordings to high precision, both for surface preservation and for post-processing of the data to recover the sound encoded in the grooves. Research has identified that high sensor axial resolution is required to resolve the smallest amplitude <b>groove</b> <b>modulations</b> contained on typical cylinder artefacts resulting {{in the selection of}} confocal laser and white light (polychromatic) confocal sensors as suitable sensing technologies. This paper presents data acquired by the two confocal sensor technologies, comparing the measured surface profiles with data obtained using a stylus profilometer. We investigate limitations of the sensors, relating their characteristics to the ongoing development of the {{scanning system}}...|$|R
50|$|Early {{electronic}} phonographs used a {{piezo-electric crystal}} for pickup (though the earliest electronic phonographs used crude magnetic pick-ups), where the mechanical {{movement of the}} stylus in the groove generates a proportional electrical voltage by creating stress within a crystal (typically Rochelle salt). Crystal pickups are relatively robust, and produce a substantial signal level which requires only a modest amount of further amplification. The output is not very linear however, introducing unwanted distortion. It is difficult to make a crystal pickup suitable for quality stereo reproduction, as the stiff coupling between the crystal and the long stylus prevents close tracking of the needle to the <b>groove</b> <b>modulations.</b> This tends to increase wear on the record, and introduces more distortion. Another problem is the hygroscopic nature of the crystal itself: it absorbs moisture from the air and may dissolve. The crystal was protected by embedding it in other materials, without hindering {{the movement of the}} pickup mechanism itself. After a number of years, the protective jelly often deteriorated or leaked from the cartridge case and the full unit needed replacement.|$|R
50|$|When {{automatic}} record changers, auto replay adapters and jukeboxes {{began appearing}} in the 1920s the need arose to find a more reliable and forgiving way to accurately direct the stylus {{to the start of}} the recorded area as well as signal the end of a performance. Appearing near the outer edge of the record and leading the stylus inward to the performance, Decca introduced the lead-in groove in 1935 in the USA, with the industry following soon thereafter. Lead-in groove length, positioning and motion varied by manufacturer and era, some moving slower, some requiring several revolutions before encountering audio, while others being very short and jerky. As with the recorded locked groove at the end, it is possible to record sound into the lead-in groove. King Crimson's USA (mentioned above) has this feature. George Harrison's Wonderwall Music and the Dead Kennedys' Plastic Surgery Disasters also start in the lead-in groove. Many Telarc classical LP's began the music near the end of the lead-in groove to avoid pre-echo (caused by wide <b>groove</b> <b>modulations</b> following a number of closely spaced silent grooves).|$|R
40|$|The {{developments}} in grating performance {{described in this}} thesis fall naturally into two parts according to whether the grating blank is plane or concave. For plane diffraction gratings, this study utilizes both experimental work and rigorous electromagnetic theories to achieve improved grating and instrument performance. The section concerned with concave gratings is entirely theoretical, drawing on the manipulation of geometric theories to design high quality gratings. Three types of plane diffraction grating grooves currently generated by holographic techniques are investigated. A discussion of methods for accurately measuring the groove profile is presented with particular reference to quasi-sinusoidal groove profiles. The spectral performance of blazed holographic gratings is shown numerically to be {{comparable to that of}} triangular groove gratings. Consideration is then given to simple optical arrangements which permit Fourier synthesis of complex distributions and groove profiles. Experimental investigations of the behaviour of resonance anomalies exhibited by gratings having surface layers of discontinuous conductivity are presented. It is demonstrated that a coating consisting of a dielectric overlaid with a metal of high conductivity drastically reduces energy absorption. A theoretical search to determine the optimum <b>groove</b> <b>modulation</b> of both blazed and sinusoidal plane reflection gratings is presented. This will assist with the development of high-gain dye lasers utilizing gratings at grazing incidence. Aberration coefficients derived using Fermat's principle are used for an examination of aberration-correction for Rowland circle spectrographs. Attention is focussed on the case where the mounting and recording points lie on the Rowland circle. Correction at two wavelengths of primary astigmatism or primary coma under this constraint is demonstrated. Alternatively, primary astigmatism and primary coma can be simultaneously corrected over a restricted wavelength range. Some practical implications are discussed. The geometric theory of concave gratings is extended to accommodate higher order aberration terms. The magnitude of the individual terms of the light path function, which describes image formation by an aberration-corrected grating, is investigated. Similarly, the behaviour of the image height under these restraints is studied for various values of the relative aperture. Finally, aberration minimization techniques are employed in the design of a uni-axial, double concave grating monochromator. The performance of this instrument is evaluated for ruled and holographic gratings...|$|E
500|$|Tufan Hashemi said Roksan {{sought to}} create {{equipment}} that would excel in high-quality musical reproduction {{and capable of}} involving the listener on an emotional level. Product characteristics were to include precision and transparency of the sound. Moghaddam, acting as chief designer, {{set out to find}} solutions to engineering problems he saw as inherent in the belt-driven suspended sub-chassis turntable design of Edgar Villchur, where the sub-chassis and tonearm are free to rotate. Moghaddam believed that the design generated undesirable torsional modes. One such torsional mode is said to be caused by [...] "groove drag" [...] â€“ dynamic forces exerted by the stylus on the record as it tracked it. Moghaddam chose to attenuate the torsion by mounting the turntable-drive motor casing on its own bearing. The motor, mounted separately and tethered to a spring, is allowed limited rotation about its own axis; because the load varied with <b>groove</b> <b>modulations,</b> the increases in drag would thus be dampened by the spring-loaded motor, and the platter acceleration mitigated. In the words of Tufan Hashemi, Roksan Audio's managing director: [...] "We argued that using a suspended or floating surface to support a record could not allow it to be accurately read, as the record itself would be floating. We said that the record surface should remain stationary and solid but in complete isolation {{from the rest of the}} deck, and our design provided a very stable base for isolating a record without suspending it." ...|$|R
2500|$|Shure {{engineers}} introduced {{several key}} phono cartridge design concepts. Chief engineer Ralph Glover discussed the pickup design relationship to record wear in a 1937 article in Electronics magazine entitled [...] "A Record-Saving Pickup". Glover developed the [...] "needle-tilt" [...] principle {{with the assistance}} of fellow Shure engineer Ben Bauer, and considerations of needle angle, record wear, and fidelity were an integral part of Shure's cartridge designs. In 1966, chief engineer Jim Kogen published a research paper entitled [...] "TRACKability" [...] in Audio magazine, defining the concept as the ability of a cartridge to maintain contact with a record <b>groove</b> through any <b>modulation.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Original master discs {{are created}} by lathe-cutting: a lathe is used to cut a {{modulated}} groove into a blank record. The blank records for cutting used to be cooked up, as needed, by the cutting engineer, using what Robert K. Morrison describes as a [...] "metallic soap", containing lead litharge, ozokerite, barium sulfate, montan wax, stearin and paraffin, among other ingredients. Cut [...] "wax" [...] sound discs would {{be placed in a}} vacuum chamber and gold-sputtered to make them electrically conductive for use as mandrels in an electroforming bath, where pressing stamper parts were made. Later, the French company Pyral invented a ready-made blank disc having a thin nitro-cellulose lacquer coating (approximately 7 mils thickness on both sides) that was applied to an aluminum substrate. Lacquer cuts result in an immediately playable, or processable, master record. If vinyl pressings are wanted, the still-unplayed sound disc is used as a mandrel for electroforming nickel records that are used for manufacturing pressing stampers. The electroformed nickel records are mechanically separated from their respective mandrels. This is done with relative ease because no actual [...] "plating" [...] of the mandrel occurs in the type of electrodeposition known as electroforming, unlike with electroplating, in which the adhesion of the new phase of metal is chemical and relatively permanent. The one-molecule-thick coating of silver (that was sprayed onto the processed lacquer sound disc in order to make its surface electrically conductive) reverse-plates onto the nickel record's face. This negative impression disc (having ridges in place of grooves) is known as a nickel master, [...] "matrix" [...] or [...] "father". The [...] "father" [...] is then used as a mandrel to electroform a positive disc known as a [...] "mother". Many mothers can be grown on a single [...] "father" [...] before ridges deteriorate beyond effective use. The [...] "mothers" [...] are then used as mandrels for electroforming more negative discs known as [...] "sons". Each [...] "mother" [...] {{can be used to make}} many [...] "sons" [...] before deteriorating. The [...] "sons" [...] are then converted into [...] "stampers" [...] by center-punching a spindle hole (which was lost from the lacquer sound disc during initial electroforming of the [...] "father"), and by custom-forming the target pressing profile. This allows them to be placed in the dies of the target (make and model) record press and, by center-roughing, to facilitate the adhesion of the label, which gets stuck onto the vinyl pressing without any glue. In this way, several million vinyl discs can be produced from a single lacquer sound disc. When only a few hundred discs are required, instead of electroforming a [...] "son" [...] (for each side), the [...] "father" [...] is removed of its silver and converted into a stamper. Production by this latter method, known as the [...] "two-step process" [...] (as it does not entail creation of [...] "sons" [...] but does involve creation of [...] "mothers", which are used for test playing and kept as [...] "safeties" [...] for electroforming future [...] "sons") is limited to a few hundred vinyl pressings. The pressing count can increase if the stamper holds out and the quality of the vinyl is high. The [...] "sons" [...] made during a [...] "three-step" [...] electroforming make better stampers since they don't require silver removal (which reduces some high fidelity because of etching erasing part of the smallest <b>groove</b> <b>modulations)</b> and also because they have a stronger metal structure than [...] "fathers".|$|R
