40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{that the use of}} an absorbing layer on top of an interlevel oxide can be used in lieu of the normal antireflective layer approaches to isolate the lithography of a via or contact window level from the reflections of an underlying metal l yer. Specifically, we show the use of a sputtered amorphous silicon layer of 500 A thickness in a double level metal process using <b>g-line</b> <b>lithography.</b> Unwanted substrate reflections during lithography pro-cesses associated with the manufacture of integrated cir-cuits can result in the distortion of the desired feature ei-ther in terms of shape or size. To negate or minimize the effects of the extraneous reflections, processes using anti-reflective coatings (ARCs) or dyed resists have been used. 1 -~ The materials used for ARCs include: sputtered amorphous silicon, sputtered amorphous tantalum silicide, TiN, TiW, and absorbing polymers. Such films typically have a high index of refraction and are highly absorbing at the wave...|$|E
40|$|The funded JESSI project 'MAPS T 40 ' covers TEMIC {{activities}} for advanced <b>g-line</b> <b>lithography</b> technologies using phase shift techniques. According to the i-line {{activities of the}} other partners {{we have been working}} to extend the life of the existing equipment by using PSM reticles and suitable photolithographic processes. We proceeded our experiments with g-line/i-line capable resists to lower the changing level between different exposure wavelengths. The TEMIC activities were placed within the workpackage 3 'industrial application of phase shift technology' for advanced submicron ASIC devices. Results: Availability of g-line PSM reticles: Compugrafics is a suitable vendor using Ulcoat MoSi Sandwich blancs with Cr boarder. Resist evaluation: we experienced good results with Shipley SPR 700 and also Shipley SPR 3612 both developed with MF 326 W. Resolution and Process window: there is a resolution improvement to 0, 6 micron for contact holes with a focus budget of 2, 25 micron and 2 micron by printing 0, 55 micron contact holes. This results in an improvement by 20 % for resolution and 10 % for the process window by using g-line Steppers. (orig.)
