500|$|The song {{has been}} {{described}} by several critics as a masterpiece. In 2004, Rolling Stone magazine placed the song at No.404 on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, commenting that Dylan [...] "never sounded lonelier than in this seven-minute ballad, cut in a single take on Valentine's Day 1966." [...] (When Rolling Stone updated their list in 2010, the song dropped to No.413.) In 1999, Britain's Poet Laureate, Andrew Motion, chose it as his candidate for the best song lyric ever written. Motion praised [...] "the concentration and surprise" [...] of Dylan's lyrics, and said that, although he distanced himself from some of the singer's views about women, the [...] "rasp of his anger" [...] was a part of his greatness. The International Observer named the song the second best ever recorded in 2017, stating, [...] "The 24 year old Dylan was beginning to realize that no matter how many perfect songs he wrote he could not achieve immortality through his art as he perhaps once believed, because even if people were still listening to the music in 500 years, he would still be dead." [...] Commenting on the song in a 1985 interview, Dylan said, [...] "I still sing that song <b>every</b> <b>once</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> while. It still stands up now as it did then, maybe even more in some kind of weird way." ...|$|E
500|$|The song's {{usage of}} the word [...] "ironic" [...] {{attracted}} media attention for an improper application of the term; according to Jon Pareles of The New York Times, the song gives a distinct [...] "unironic" [...] sense in its implications. [...] According to the Oxford English Dictionary [...] "irony" [...] is [...] "a figure of speech in which the intended meaning {{is the opposite of}} that expressed by the words used". Thus, lyrics such as [...] "It's like rain on your wedding day" [...] and [...] "A traffic jam when you're already late" [...] are not ironic. Morissette commented about the writing of the song: [...] "For me the great debate on whether what I was saying in 'Ironic' was ironic wasn't a traumatic debate. I'd always embraced the fact that <b>every</b> <b>once</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> while I'd be the malapropism queen. And when Glen and I were writing it, we definitely were not doggedly making sure that everything was technically ironic". In 2014, Michael Reid Roberts penned for Salon.com a defense of the song's use of the term [...] "ironic", as the song cites situational ironies, which is defined as the [...] "state of affairs or event that seems deliberately contrary to what one expects and is often [...] amusing as a result", as some of the situations described in the lyrics could in fact be said to be [...] "ironic".|$|E
500|$|The {{traveller}} {{explains in}} [...] "Part III" [...] {{how he is}} the son of an Oxford mathematics professor. When young, he loved to read outdoors and wanted to know how the world worked. He became an architect and travelled throughout Europe. Eventually he married a lovely woman with whom he had a son, Henry. One day the couple left their son with his nurse during an outing and she fell asleep. When they returned, their son was gone, and he could not be found. The traveller spent years searching the countryside for his son; one day he met the woman, Dame Smithson, who had stolen his son. To please her sailor husband who wanted a child, she lied to him and said she was pregnant. Before his return, she needed a child, so she stole the traveller's. Unused to the harsh life of a peasant, the child suffered and became sickly. As a result, the woman's husband disliked him and beat him, believing him to be worthless. Hearing this story, Maurice reveals himself to be the traveller's son; he had changed his name to avoid the person he believed to be his cruel father. Overjoyed to be reunited with his son, the traveller buys the cottage for him and they return <b>every</b> <b>once</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> while. Maurice is educated, grows up, and travels widely.

[...] In the video, it is presumed that Lewis and Crawford have stolen a large amount of money, as it opens with dialogue between the pair and how they are going to try and arrange to meet each other at a later date, due to the police closing in on them. As the song begins to play, Lewis sings the first verse on the car bonnet in which they were shown sitting in previously. As she sings the first chorus, she stands up and faces Crawford in the car, and begins to walk away in a car park as she sings the second verse. For the second chorus, Lewis is shown to evade the police by trying to escape by car park stairways, but is confronted by policemen in most directions she goes. For the final chorus, Lewis makes it out onto the road and runs from the police in their cars, but is ultimately blocked from escape in all directions as they close in on her, arrest her, and place her {{in the back of a}} police car. People ranked the video as one of the most anticipated videos to be released in January 2009.|$|E

Simon hired Meyer along with Army Man contributors Swartzwelder and Jon Vitti. Meyer often played {{an active role in the}} show's extensive group script rewriting sessions in the [...] "rewrite room", a role he performed more than solo script work; indeed he has only been credited for writing twelve episodes.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{we focus on}} two NP-hard and intensively studied problems: The {{travelling}} salesman problem (TSP), which aims to find a minimum cost tour that visits <b>every</b> node exactly <b>once</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> complete weighted graph, and the 2 -edge-connected spanning subgraph problem (2 ECSS), which aims to find a minimum size 2 -edge-connected spanning subgraph <b>in</b> <b>a</b> given graph. TSP and 2 ECSS have many real world applications. However, both problems are NP-hard which means {{it is unlikely that}} polynomial time algorithms exist to solve them, so methods that return close to optimal solutions are sought. In this thesis we mainly focus on k-approximation algorithms for the two problems, which efficiently return a solution within k times of the optimal solution. For a special case of TSP called graph TSP, using ideas from Momke and Svensson, we present a 25 / 18 -approximation algorithm for a special class of graphs using circulations and T-joins, which improves the previous known best bound of 7 / 5 for such graphs. Moreover, if the graph does not contain special nodes, our algorithm ensures the ratio of 4 / 3. For 2 ECSS, given any k-edge-connected graph G=(V,E), |V|=n, |E|=m, we present an approximation algorithm that gives a 2 -edge-connected spanning subgraph with the number of edges at most n+(m-n) /(k- 1) -(k- 2) /(k- 1) with a novel use of circulations, which improves both the approximation ratio and the simplicity of the proof compared to a result by Huh in 2004...|$|R

500|$|Bandslam {{was bought}} by a studio back in 2004, but in late January 2007, Walden Media and Summit Entertainment {{announced}} that they would co-finance Bandslam, co-written by Todd Graff and Josh A. Cagan and directed by Graff. Graff was hired to direct in early March 2007 and rewrote the screenplay. Before filming, they had two weeks of music rehearsals. The actors and actresses were designated to play their instruments. Donowho and Michalka had extensive experience with the drums and guitar, respectively, so {{they were used to}} their instruments, but Lisa Chung, Scott Porter and Vanessa Hudgens were not. Hudgens told MTV News she didn't expect there to be as much music, and [...] "they are like, 'We are going to have two weeks of music rehearsals,' and I was like, 'What?' But it was really cool. It's definitely not the kind of music I do normally." [...] Principal photography began on February 9, 2008 in Austin, Texas. Although the film is set in New Jersey, Graff felt strongly {{that it was important to}} shoot in a place with a wide array of great live music to choose from. [...] "I'm a big believer in local scenes," [...] he says. [...] "I think it's the lifeblood of music. Austin is renowned as a music town, and rightly so. They have a ton of really great bands just trying to get their music out there. So, it's great we had an opportunity to use several unsigned local Texas bands." [...] In an interview with Los Angeles Times, director Todd Graff admitted there were cultural incongruities underlying the film. [...] "I know, it's demented. <b>Every</b> <b>once</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> while on set I would think to myself, 'I can't believe we got away with this'. I always thought if it only sent one kid to listen to a Velvet Underground record, it would be worth it to me." [...] All of the vocals were filmed live by each of the singing cast members, as mentioned by director Graff. One of the requirements for the film was that all actors had to be able to provide their own vocals. Because Aly Michalka was on tour with her sister AJ Michalka and Miley Cyrus, she did not arrive in Austin until midway through rehearsals. Conveniently, the tour's last stop was in Austin, where rehearsal and filming for the movie took place. All of the instruments and singing in the movie were recorded by the actors, with the exception of the guitar parts of Vanessa Hudgens and Scott Porter, as well as Lisa Chung's piano parts. Although Hudgens and Porter learned how to play their songs, they were dubbed by guitarists Jason Mozersky and JW Wright.|$|E

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{acknowledged}} that obesity {{has emerged as}} <b>an</b> epidemic <b>in</b> developed countries during {{the last quarter of}} the 20 th century [1]. It is an issue of great concern, affecting adults and children of both wealthy and middle-income people in both middle-income countries as well as residents of countries previously considered to be poor [2]. The World Health Organisation has stated that the prevalence of obesity and overweight is increasing in both adult and childhood populations throughout the world, and has acknowledged management of obesity as a priority area of public health action [1]. This feasibility study "Games Galore" investigated the effect of a physical activity and nutrition education intervention for the development of ongoing self-motivated participation in physical activity and of healthy eating habits of both male and female 10 - 14 year old New Zealand overweight or obese children. Twenty-two students of an intermediate and a full primary school enrolled in the "Games Galore" feasibility study. The participants were all residents of West Auckland, New Zealand and participated twice weekly <b>in</b> <b>a</b> games programme and <b>once</b> <b>every</b> fortnight <b>in</b> <b>a</b> nutrition education programme. Anthropometric data was collected at baseline, 4 months, 6 months (end of the intervention), 10 months (4 months post intervention), and 16 months (10 months post intervention). A qualitative dietary habit questionnaire, a diet and activity questionnaire, a food frequency questionnaire, a 3 day diet and physical activity diary, and a three 24 -hour recalls were administered to assess nutrient intake and physical activity.
