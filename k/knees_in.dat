40|$|AbstractThis article {{describes}} a simple surgical skin preparation technique for total knee arthroplasty that permits {{the application of}} skin prep agent with the <b>knee</b> <b>in</b> maximal flexion. While most surgeons prep the <b>knee</b> <b>in</b> extension, {{it is believed that}} prep of the <b>knee</b> <b>in</b> flexion will provide superior coverage of the skin surface and reduce the potential for surgical-site infection, particularly in obese patients with large soft-tissue layers anterior to the knee...|$|R

In women, the Q angle should be less than 22 degrees with the <b>knee</b> <b>in</b> extension and less than 9 degrees with the <b>knee</b> <b>in</b> 90 degrees of flexion. In men, the Q angle should be less than 18 degrees with the <b>knee</b> <b>in</b> extension and less than 8 degrees with the <b>knee</b> <b>in</b> 90 degrees of flexion. A typical Q angle is 12 degrees for men and 17 degrees for women.|$|R
5|$|On July 12, 2008, Cheney {{underwent}} a cardiological exam; doctors reported that his heartbeat was normal for a 67-year-old {{man with a}} history of heart problems. As part of his annual checkup, he was administered an electrocardiogram and radiological imaging of the stents placed in the arteries behind his <b>knees</b> <b>in</b> 2005. Doctors said that Cheney had not experienced any recurrence of atrial fibrillation and that his special pacemaker had neither detected nor treated any arrhythmia. On October 15, 2008, Cheney returned to the hospital briefly to treat a minor irregularity.|$|E
5|$|He re-invented the {{practice}} of stiff-arming his tacklers, which {{had gone out of}} favor among running backs in the 1970s. At times, he used his high school experience as a long jumper to leap over his opponents, landing on his head in the end zone to gain a touchdown in a game against the Buffalo Bills. His running gait was somewhat unusual, as his knees were minimally bent, and the motion was largely powered from the hip. This may have given his knees, a football player's most vulnerable joints, some protection, although he underwent arthroscopic surgery on both <b>knees</b> <b>in</b> 1983. He referred to this procedure as an 11,000-yard checkup.|$|E
5|$|Gaga, with {{shoulder}} and facial protrusions (prosthetic makeup mimicking subdermal implants) walks in {{a seemingly endless}} black space, where people are {{on their hands and}} <b>knees</b> <b>in</b> an organized pattern. She raises her hand and crouches down to join them. When the first verse begins, everyone dances to choreography. The scenes alternate between the dance, and Gaga singing on her throne in space. In the second verse, Gaga and Rico are in tuxedos, with her face painted to mirror his. Alternating clips show Gaga caressing and attempting to dance with him while he stays expressionless and motionless for the most part. When the chorus plays for the second time, Gaga sings in a room of mirrors, with her head displayed in a glass box among oddly distorted mannequin heads. In the succeeding shots, she is once again shown on her throne giving birth to more members of the new race. After choreographed routines by Gaga and her dancers, they all gather in a circle and embrace in a hug.|$|E

40|$|Patellar tendon {{width and}} length are {{commonly}} used for preoperative planning for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). In the study reported here, we assessed the accuracy of preoperative measurements made by palpation through the skin, and correlated these measurements with the actual dimensions of the tendons at surgery. Before making incisions in 53 patients undergoing ACLR with patellar tendon autograft, we measured patellar tendon length with the <b>knee</b> <b>in</b> full extension and in 90 ° of flexion, and tendon width with the <b>knee</b> <b>in</b> 90 ° of flexion. The tendon was then exposed, and its width was measured with the <b>knee</b> <b>in</b> 90 ° of flexion. The length of the central third of the tendon was measured after the graft was prepared. Mean patellar tendon length and width with the <b>knee</b> <b>in</b> 90 ° of flexion were 39 mm and 32 mm, respectively. No clinical difference {{was found between the}} estimated pre-incision and surgical widths. However, the estimated pre-incision length with the <b>knee</b> <b>in</b> full extension and in 90 ° of flexion was significantly shorter than the surgical length. Skin measurements can be used to accurately determine patellar tendon width before surgery, but measurements of length are not as reliable...|$|R

In 1275, he decreed the Pamalayu expedition to overrun Sumatra. By 1288, Singhasari naval expeditionary forces successfully sacked Jambi and Palembang and brought Malayu Dharmasraya—the successor state of Srivijaya, to its <b>knees.</b> <b>In</b> 1293 Singhasari was successed by Majapahit ruling the region.|$|E

25|$|The Gelflings were {{designed}} and sculpted by Wendy Midener. They {{were difficult to}} perform, as {{they were meant to}} be the most human creatures in the film, and thus their movements, particularly their gait, had to be as realistic as possible. During scenes when the Gelflings' legs were off-camera, the performers walked on their <b>knees</b> <b>in</b> order to make the character's movements more lifelike. According to Odell, the character Jen was Henson's way of projecting himself into the film. Jen was originally meant to be blue, in homage to the Hindu deity Rama, but this idea was scrapped early on.|$|E

Ruddock regained his feet, but Morrison drove him to the ropes and showered him with an extended flurry of blows. Just as the bell was about to sound, the referee stepped in and declared Morrison the winner by TKO.|$|E
