By contrast, Record Collector described the storytelling as [...] "seamless". In their write-up, RTÉ.ie advised, [...] "park the snootiness before pressing the play button because while The Astonishing makes Iron Maiden's recent 92-minute double The Book of Souls look like a Ramones record, it's great fun ...

She had been expected to take a temporary break following the birth of her first child. Of her exit, Herbison commented [...] "The Neighbours audience fell in love with Naomi instantly and we have certainly left the door wide open for her to rejoin the Cannings in the future – Sheila wouldn't have <b>it</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> way." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to recording at I.D. Sound, Rundgren took an 8-track recorder and some studio equipment, installing {{it at his}} rented home on Astral Drive, Nichols Canyon. 'Intro' and 'Breathless' were recorded here, along with various guitar and keyboard overdubs. A version of 'Torch Song' was also recorded, but was scrapped due to excessive background noise. Rundgren recalled that recording at home meant he could spend time working on pieces of technology or production, such as programming a VCS3 synthesizer, at his leisure without wasting anyone else's time. The artwork on the original gatefold sleeve was also shot in this apartment. Despite working long hours each day in both I.D and at home, with minimum breaks for sleeping and eating, Rundgren said he enjoyed the recording experience, and [...] "wouldn't have had <b>it</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> way." ...|$|E

It was given the IGN Editors' Choice Award, calling it [...] "a AAA experience that is an adrenaline rush for online fans." [...] Game Informer described Warhawk as [...] "better than they'd hoped for". GamePro stated that although Warhawk offers an intense online combat experience, being dropped immediately into the action leaves you [...] "somewhat bewildered" [...] and doesn't give you that [...] "feeling of connection" [...] to the game. GameTrailers described Warhawk as [...] "simply fun, easy to compete, but challenging to shine."

Adams said that donations remain stable except during a new version update, {{where there is a}} sudden increase. Their expenses being low, he has maintained that he is happy as long as the game is self-sustaining and will not charge for it. In 2011, Adams refused a job offer from an unspecified major game developer and a $300,000 deal to license the name Dwarf Fortress from another company. Adams felt that this amount would not equate to long-term donations and that he prefers working on his own—not being part of the gaming industry. Adams said, [...] "Barely in the black one month, a little in the red another month. ... It's a risk I'm willing to take, and really I couldn't have <b>it</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> way." [...] He has spent no money on advertising and was happy when bloggers, reviewers like former game journalist Kieron Gillen from PC Gamer and Games for Windows, wrote about his game. In 2015, Bay 12 Games set up a Patreon account to help fund it.|$|E

[...] Lewis Corner of Digital Spy gave the album four stars out of five, saying that the band's trademark sound was present on the album [...] "and truth be told, we wouldn't want <b>it</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> way." [...] Mark Lepage of the Montreal Gazette praised the album, calling it [...] "one rolling, chugging, plangent epic." [...] According to Chad Grischow of IGN, Evanescence is a [...] "great album that delivers the familiar while {{keeping an eye on the}} future." [...] Rob Williams of the Winnipeg Free Press described the album as gothic nu metal and hard rock, with dramatic orchestration which makes everything sound [...] "big and alive": [...] "With so many extra bells and whistles, despair has never sounded so epic."

500|$|In 2002, Rick and Laura Brown, two sculptors from Massachusetts, {{along with}} Massachusetts College of Art and Design {{students}} and faculty, constructed another replica. The Browns {{set out to}} gain a better understanding of human ingenuity while keeping Bushnell’s design, materials, and technique authentic. “With it, Yankee ingenuity was born,” observed Rick Brown, referring to the latest in a long line of commemoration that perceived the Turtle as something authentically American. Of the temptation to use synthetic and ahistorical materials, Rob Duarte, a MassArts student observed, “It was always a temptation to use silicone to seal the thing," [...] says Rob Duarte, a MassArt student. [...] "Then you realized that someone else had to figure this out with the same limited resources that we were using. That's just an interesting way to learn. You can't do <b>it</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> way than by actually doing it.” The outer shell of the replica was hallowed, using controlled fire, from a twelve-foot Sitka Spruce. The log was seven feet in diameter and shipped from British Columbia. This replica took twelve days to build and was successfully submerged in water. In 2003, it was tested in an indoor test tank at the United States Naval Academy. Lew Nuckols, a professor of Ocean Engineering at USNA, made ten dives, noting “you feel very isolated from the outside world. If you had any sense of claustrophobia it would not be a very good experience.” ...|$|E
500|$|During early previews of the song, Corner spoke most on Gambino's guest appearance, {{describing}} the collaboration as [...] "unlikely on paper" [...] {{but then in}} reality [...] "it results in one of Leona's most natural collaborations to date". Commenting on the song as a whole, Corner said [...] "Trouble" [...] was a powerful comeback, [...] "It's big, it's emotional and it's what we've come to expect from the Hackney belle – but we wouldn't want <b>it</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> way." [...] Gordon Smart, showbiz editor for The Sun added that although [...] "it {{was a long time}} coming, [...] 'Trouble' will definitely make people interested in a full album" [...] mainly down the new sound, image and Gambino's guest rap which will [...] "help shake off Lewis' safe image." [...] Lewis Corner from Digital Spy also picked up on the change of direction and commented that people would be [...] "shocked," [...] but then added that [...] "when [...] "it results in an emotive anthem like this, we hope she unleashes it more often." [...] The Guardians Michael Cragg called [...] "Trouble" [...] a return to the [...] "safer" [...] templates of her first two albums, but praised the song's production calling it [...] "a vaguely trip-hop beat buffeted by soaring strings and a troubled lyric in the chorus." [...] Like previous reviews, Cragg also praised Gambino stating that he [...] "manages to stamp his own personality on the song" [...] despite appearing {{near the end of the}} song and that perhaps it was Lewis' best chance at [...] "regaining her footing in America".|$|E
500|$|Erin Mullally {{was cast}} in the role and began filming {{immediately}} after Sorensen's departure from the production. In {{a statement from the}} press office at Five, they stated: [...] "As the character of Declan is extremely popular, and with some sensational storylines planned, it was decided that the character would be recast" [...] Sorensen expressed his delight that his character would continue {{as a part of the}} series saying: [...] "I'm really happy the character's going to continue because the producers and writers have given Declan some fantastic storylines. I'm really proud he's become as popular as he has." [...] At the time it was noted that recasts have occurred repeatedly throughout the history of the programme, creator of Neighbours, Reg Watson previously explained why he thought recasts were quintessential in the show saying: [...] "I always believed it was a pity, when actors chose to leave a serial that the character should go as well. A lot of time and money is invested in the character so we decided to recast if the character was important to the future of the storyline and the show itself." [...] It was this explanation that backed up Declan's recast. Sorensen also explained that the hand-over process would be simple adding: [...] "It'll be nothing over the top. I'm Declan one day and the next day it's Erin. Pretty simple. That's how it works, I can't continue, so Erin comes in and picks up the baton. I think it's easier for the viewers to accept when it's a simple change-over." [...] The recast had also upset fans of the character under the portrayal of Sorensen, in response to this he said: [...] "Erin will come in and play his version of Declan, he can't play it exactly as I do and I and the producers would never expect him to do <b>it</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> way. All I can say to the Declan supporters is that Erin will be terrific, give him a go, you'll be surprised." ...|$|E
