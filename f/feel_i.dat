I told him the <b>feel</b> <b>I</b> wanted and Manuel {{put his hands on}} the keyboards and I started singing the melody. We went back and forth with the bridge and the B-section. I had the outline of the lyrics and started singing 'Always be my baby' {{off the top of my}} head.|$|E

I wish the club and everyone concerned with it all the best for the future.|$|E
25|$|White {{decided not}} to accept any more prizes for his work, and he {{declined}} both the $10,000 Britannia Award and another Miles Franklin Award. White was approached by Harry M. Miller {{to work on a}} screenplay for Voss but nothing came of it. He became an active opponent of literary censorship and joined a number of other public figures in signing a statement of defiance against Australia’s decision to participate in the Vietnam War. His name had sometimes been mentioned as a contender for the Nobel Prize in Literature, but in 1971, after losing to Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, he wrote to a friend: That Nobel Prize! I hope I never hear it mentioned again. I certainly don't want it; the machinery behind it seems a bit dirty, when we thought that only applied to Australian awards. In my case to win the prize would upset my life far too much, and it would embarrass me to be held up to the world as an Australian writer when, apart from the accident of blood, I <b>feel</b> <b>I</b> am temperamentally a cosmopolitan Londoner.|$|E

500|$|Dixon has {{described}} herself and other celebrities {{as having a}} [...] "moral responsibility" [...] to do good works, when asked by The Observers Elizabeth Day. Speaking in August 2010 to Blues & Soul Dixon said: [...] "Being {{in the entertainment industry}} I do <b>feel</b> <b>I</b> have a responsibility that comes with my fame".|$|E
500|$|The same profile quoted Morell's catholic {{approach}} to stage assignments: [...] "If a part {{is a good}} part and I <b>feel</b> <b>I</b> can enjoy playing it, it doesn't matter whether it's Shakespeare or modern farce … I'd hate to be bogged down in Shakespeare or classic theatre all my life. It's {{a good thing for}} an actor to do many different kinds of theatre, because it keeps his imagination stimulated." ...|$|E

500|$|West's all-round {{game and}} {{attitude}} is maybe best expressed in his statistically most spectacular game: {{he once was}} credited with 44points (16 of 17 shots from the field, 12 of 12 free throw attempts) with 12rebounds, 12assists, and (unofficially counted) 10 blocked shots, thus scoring a non-official ultra-rare quadruple double. Instead of being proud, West merely commented: [...] "Defensively, from a team standpoint, I didn't <b>feel</b> <b>I</b> played very well. Very rarely was I satisfied with how I played." ...|$|E
500|$|Coolidge died {{suddenly}} from coronary thrombosis at [...] "The Beeches," [...] at 12:45p.m., January 5, 1933. Shortly before his death, Coolidge confided {{to an old}} friend: [...] "I <b>feel</b> <b>I</b> no longer fit in with these times." [...] Coolidge is buried in Plymouth Notch Cemetery, Plymouth Notch, Vermont. The nearby family home is maintained {{as one of the}} original buildings on the Calvin Coolidge Homestead District site. The State of Vermont dedicated a new visitors' center nearby to mark Coolidge's 100th birthday on July 4, 1972.|$|E
500|$|His hobbies {{included}} gardening, pottery, astronomy, {{listening to}} classical music and cooking. He supported {{a number of}} charities and other causes, including Greenpeace, the Woodland Trust, Oxfam and Sightsavers International. He liked to live a private, hermit-like life, and once commented that [...] "For {{some of the time}} I <b>feel</b> <b>I</b> could be a monk" [...] but that he [...] "couldn't cope with the celibacy." [...] A self-described [...] "solitary person", he found it somewhat annoying being a television celebrity and being recognised by members of the public.|$|E

500|$|Shackleton's February 1907 {{announcement}} {{that he intended}} to base his expedition at the old Discovery headquarters was noted by Scott, whose own future Antarctic plans were at that stage unannounced. In a letter to Shackleton, Scott claimed priority rights to McMurdo Sound. [...] "I <b>feel</b> <b>I</b> have a sort of right to my own field of work," [...] he wrote, adding: [...] "anyone who has had to do with exploration will regard this region primarily as mine". He concluded by reminding Shackleton of his duty of loyalty towards his former commander.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} week (9 November 2009), {{during an interview}} with Mary Hanafin, Alan O'Brien (who has a conviction from 2006 for incitement to hatred), {{a member of the}} audience, spent three minutes accusing Kenny of [...] "pontificating and moralising" [...] people on social welfare, despite being in receipt of a €600,000 salary. Then referring to a previous court case involving Kenny, he concluded by saying, [...] "Now I am going to sue an old woman for a field because I <b>feel</b> <b>I</b> might make a million or more." [...] After being removed by security, the programme continued.|$|E
500|$|In April 2008 {{a picture}} of Song was used in an ad for an escort agency in the LA Weekly. A rep from Disney told TMZ: [...] "This is an {{unauthorized}} use of Brenda Song's image and her personal attorney has issued a cease and desist to the advertiser." [...] Song filed a libel suit seeking $100,000 in damages. Song said: [...] "As a role model to millions of young people, I <b>feel</b> <b>I</b> {{have to take a}} stand against this company in regard to its exploitation of my image."

According to Lopez, it is about when you are at a bad bad {{point in your life}} and {{somebody}} comes in and makes you believe in love again. She cited her then-husband Marc Anthony as being that person for her. Monica Herrera of Billboard picked up on this, with the lyrics: [...] "I feel the beat again, stronger than before". Scott Shetler of PopCrush pointed out the song's optimistic viewpoint, with the lyrics: [...] "I'm alive, I can breathe, I can <b>feel,</b> <b>I</b> believe." ...|$|E
500|$|Because McClellan {{failed to}} pursue Lee aggressively after Antietam, Lincoln ordered {{that he be}} removed from command on November 5, 1862. Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside assumed command of the Army of the Potomac on November 9, 1862. McClellan wrote to his wife, [...] "Those in whose {{judgment}} I rely tell me that I fought the battle splendidly {{and that it was}} a masterpiece of art. ... I <b>feel</b> <b>I</b> have done all that can be asked in twice saving the country. ... I feel some little pride in having, with a beaten & demoralized army, defeated Lee so utterly. ... Well, one of these days history will I trust do me justice." ...|$|E
500|$|In February 1912, Mackintosh married Gladys Campbell, {{and settled}} into an office job as {{assistant}} secretary to the Imperial Merchant Service Guild in Liverpool. The safe, routine work did not satisfy him: [...] "I am still existing at this job, stuck in a dirty office," [...] he wrote to a former Nimrod shipmate. [...] "I always <b>feel</b> <b>I</b> never completed my first initiation—so {{would like to have}} one final wallow, for good or bad!" [...] He was therefore delighted, early in 1914, to receive an invitation from Shackleton to join the latter's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, which was to attempt the first crossing of the Antarctic continent.|$|E

500|$|Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi: An old A-list horror film actor whom Ed {{brings back}} into the spotlight. Rick Baker created the {{prosthetic}} makeup designs. Baker did not use extensive make-up applications, only enough to resemble Lugosi and allow Landau to use his face to act and express emotion. For research, Landau watched 25 of Lugosi's films and seven interviews between the years of 1931 and 1956. Landau {{did not want to}} deliver an over-the-top performance. [...] "Lugosi was theatrical, but I never wanted the audience to <b>feel</b> <b>I</b> was an actor chewing the scenery... I felt it had to be Lugosi's theatricality, not mine." ...|$|E
500|$|With {{no return}} address, Balzac {{was left to}} reply in the Gazette de France, {{with the hope that}} she would see the notice. She did not, but wrote again in November: [...] "Your soul embraces centuries, monsieur; its {{philosophical}} concepts appear to be the fruit of long study matured by time; yet I am told you are still young. I would like to know you, but <b>feel</b> <b>I</b> have no need to do so. I know you through my own spiritual instinct; I picture you in my own way, and feel that if I were to actually set eyes upon you, I should instantly exclaim, 'That is he!'" ...|$|E
500|$|Feelings: {{emotions}} or sensations, free {{of thought}} and story. These are to be distinguished from thoughts (e.g., [...] "I <b>feel</b> <b>I</b> didn't get a fair deal") and from words colloquially used as feelings but which convey what {{we think we are}} (e.g., [...] "inadequate"), how we think others are evaluating us (e.g., [...] "unimportant"), or what we think others are doing to us (e.g., [...] "misunderstood", [...] "ignored"). Feelings are said to reflect whether we are experiencing our needs as met or unmet. Identifying feelings is said to allow us to more easily connect with one another, and [...] "Allowing ourselves to be vulnerable by expressing our feelings can help resolve conflicts." ...|$|E
