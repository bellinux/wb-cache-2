40|$|The {{hybridization}} of oligothymine templates with oligomeric adenine and naphthalene diaminotriazine <b>guests</b> <b>has</b> {{been studied}} by UV-vis and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. First, {{the length of}} the oligothymine template and the oligoadenine <b>guest</b> <b>has</b> been systematically varied. The studies reveal that increasing the length of multivalent guests results in a stabilization of the templated assemblies. Hybridization studies also show that guest–guest interactions between the multivalent guests additionally enhance the stability. Based on these results, a bivalent naphthalene diaminotriazine <b>guest</b> <b>has</b> been synthesized, showing a higher stability than the monovalent naphthalene diaminotriazine guest; the host–guest interaction energy is higher while the guest–guest interaction remains the same...|$|R
