40|$|A {{method and}} {{apparatus}} for generating an enhanced image is provided. The method includes receiving (101) an image to be enhanced. A set of sub images is generated (103) from the image where the different sub images correspond to different spatial frequency bands for the image. A pixel value variation is determined (107) {{in a neighborhood}} region of the first <b>pixel</b> <b>region</b> {{for at least a}} first <b>pixel</b> <b>region</b> of the image. An enhanced <b>pixel</b> <b>region</b> is then generated (109) for the enhanced image by combining the first <b>pixel</b> <b>region</b> and corresponding <b>pixel</b> <b>regions</b> of sub images in response to the pixel value variation. Specifically, a weighted summation of the input image and sub images may be generated with the weights being determined in response to the luminance variance in the neighborhood region. The invention may e. g. provide improved contrast enhancement with reduced artifacts and/or noise...|$|R

40|$|Recent work in object {{localization}} {{has shown}} that the use of contextual cues can greatly improve accuracy over models that use appearance features alone. Although many of these models have successfully explored different types of contextual sources, they only consider one type of contextual interaction (e. g., <b>pixel,</b> <b>region</b> or object level interactions), leaving open questions about the true potential contribution of context. Furthermore, contributions across object classes and over appearance features still remain unknown. In this work, we introduce a novel model for multiclass object localization that incorporates different levels of contextual interactions. We study contextual interactions at <b>pixel,</b> <b>region</b> and object level by using three different sources of context: semantic, boundary support and contextual neighborhoods. Our framework learns a single similarity metric from multiple kernels, combining <b>pixel</b> and <b>region</b> interactions with appearance features, and then uses a conditional random field to incorporate object level interactions. We perform experiments on two challenging image databases: MSRC and PASCAL VOC 2007. Experimental results show that our model outperforms current state-ofthe-art contextual frameworks and reveals individual contributions for each contextual interaction level, as well as the importance of each type of feature in object localization. 1...|$|R

40|$|Charge sharing {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the performance of single-photon counting microstrip detectors, since the comparator threshold defines the <b>effective</b> <b>pixel</b> width. In this contribution, the PICASSO (Phase Imaging for Clinical Application with Silicon detector and Synchrotron radiatiOn) single-photon counting microstrip detector oriented in edge-on configuration has been used to study its spatial resolution as a function of the comparator threshold. The experiment was carried out with monochromatic x-rays at the SYRMEP beamline of the Elettra synchrotron radiation facility in Trieste (Italy). The Edge Spread Function (i. e. the integral of the Line spread Function, LSF) was measured by horizontally translating vertical slits from a bar-pattern test-object in front of the detector, at four different photon energies (19, 20, 22, and 25 keV) and for several different values of the comparator threshold. The effect of charge sharing between strips on the spatial resolution has been quantified by calculating the horizontal Modulation Transfer Function (MTF). Moreover, the composite LSF from neighboring pixels was obtained: this allowed estimating the optimal threshold for each photon energy by selecting the threshold at which the composite LSF would approach unity along the entire width of the pixel. The results show that at thresholds lower than half of the photon energy, charge sharing increases the <b>effective</b> <b>pixel</b> width, causing a drop of the MTF, and it is responsible for the appearance of peaks in the composite LSF. Conversely, at thresholds higher than half of the photon energy, the <b>effective</b> <b>pixel</b> width is reduced and the spatial resolution is increased, but the collection efficiency is compromised, as demonstrated by the presence of valleys in the composite LSF...|$|R

Flat-field images are {{a rich source of}} data on sensor anomalies, although such effects are typically dwarfed by shot noise in a single flat field. After combining many (∼ 500) such images into `ultraflats' to reduce the impact of shot noise, we perform photon transfer analysis on a pixel-by-pixel basis and observe no spatial structure in pixel linearity or gain at light levels of 100 ke^- and below. At 125 ke^-, a columnar structure is observed in the gain map [...] we attribute this to a flux-dependent charge transfer inefficiency.
