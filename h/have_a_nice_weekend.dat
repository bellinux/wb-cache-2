50|$|By 1974, {{exploitation}} {{films were}} losing popularity. The Single Girls (1974) attempted unsuccessfully to spoof horror genre conventions, and the ultra low-budget <b>Have</b> <b>a</b> <b>Nice</b> <b>Weekend</b> (1975) did not exploit the sex, nudity, drugs, or violence that audiences expected. The Love Butcher (1975), released {{at the beginning}} of the punk movement failed to attract an audience with its lack of political correctness. In The Redeemer: Son of Satan (1976), ex-students at a school reunion are stalked by a vengeful maniac because of the sins they've committed, including one woman for being a lesbian. The use of masks was a central gimmick in the poorly received Savage Weekend (1976), which was shelved for several years before a small re-release in 1981.|$|E

The latter, produced by Willie Lindo, began to break Hammond into the international market. He scored another hit in 1986 with [...] "Settling Down" [...] on his eponymous release. He left his fame in Jamaica for New York City in 1987, after being tied up as thieves ransacked his house during a home invasion. There he recorded the <b>Have</b> <b>a</b> <b>Nice</b> <b>Weekend</b> album and the duet single [...] "How Can We Ease the Pain" [...] with Maxi Priest.|$|E

Gessle eventually demoed 29 songs for Room Service, excluding songs written by Marie Fredriksson or songs originally demoed for <b>Have</b> <b>a</b> <b>Nice</b> Day but left off that album, such as [...] "The Centre of the Heart", which was first demoed in October 1997.
