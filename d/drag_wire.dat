But about it the country {{on both sides of}} the gorge might have been swept by a colossal broom. Everything that could possibly give cover to an attack upon the German position at Niagara had been levelled as ruthlessly as machinery and explosives could contrive; houses blown up and burnt, woods burnt, fences and crops destroyed. The mono-rails had been torn up, and the roads in particular cleared of all possibility of concealment or shelter. Seen from above, the effect of this wreckage was grotesque. Young woods had been destroyed whole-sale by <b>dragging</b> <b>wires,</b> and the spoilt saplings, smashed or uprooted, lay in swathes like corn after the sickle.

The top of the mountain, above the atmosphere, is therefore just a hole in the Ringworld floor. Louis drives the police station over the edge, dragging the Lying Bastard along with it.

40|$|Electron {{interactions}} in and between wires become increasingly complex and important as circuits are scaled to nanometre sizes, or employ reduced-dimensional conductors like carbon nanotubes, nanowires and gated high mobility 2 D electron systems. This {{is because the}} screening of the long-range Coulomb potential of individual carriers is weakened in these systems, {{which can lead to}} phenomenon such as Coulomb drag: a current in one wire induces a voltage in a second wire through Coulomb interactions alone. Previous experiments have observed electron <b>drag</b> in <b>wires</b> separated by a soft electrostatic barrier ≳ 80 nm. Here, we measure both positive and negative drag between adjacent vertical quantum wires that are separated by ∼ 15 nm and have independent contacts, which allows their electron densities to be tuned independently.

40|$|Electric Fishing {{is done by}} <b>dragging</b> <b>wires</b> on the sea bottom (the ‘pulse fishing’), {{allowing}} the fish to be startled from the bottom by electric stimulation. Many Dutch fishermen see pulse fishing as their future because of reduced fuel costs and good catches. At the same time, it is a heavily debated fishing method. Currently, 5 % of the Dutch fleet (42 ships) uses the method on a temporary license. Whether they can continue using the method depends on politics {{but also on the}} availability of information and knowledge. To extend the amount of licenses for pulse fishing or to change the temporary license into a permanent one, more information was and is needed on the catch composition in pulse fishing. The Dutch government asked the fishing industry to provide these data. Therefore, in 2011 the fishing industry started a catch monitoring program together in kilograms in the sample of the quantities of plaice, sole, cod and other fish species (commercial and noncommercial), benthic species, stones, peat and shells. When registering fish species, a distinction is made in landing size and undersized fish. Halfway through the program, a quality check of the data was carried out. Based on the outcome, some changes were made in the program. Also, extra attention was given to fishermen that had problems filling in the forms in the correct way. The monitoring program will run until December 2012. The data are analysed and reported by scientists from IMARES. The data collected in the independent observer trips will be used as an extra control mechanism. Results of the monitoring program will be used in the discussion on whether pulse fishing can continue. At the same time, the industry also wants to use the data for certification needs (MSC certification). with research institute IMARES. 24 vessels participate in a self-sampling scheme and in addition ten independent observer trips are conducted. The fishermen were trained by IMARES to collect and sort samples from their catch. The participating fishermen take weekly at a fixed time a sample from the catch from one haul and sort this sample.

The formalism {{can be applied to}} both ballistic and disordered systems and the consequences can be studied either by numerical simulations or analytic means such as perturbation theory or random matrix theory. The physics of Coulomb drag in the mesoscopic regime is very different from Coulomb drag between extended electron systems. In the mesoscopic regime we in general find fluctuations of the drag comparable to the mean value.

40|$|In a one {{dimensional}} electron gas at low enough density, the magnetic (spin) exchange energy J between neighboring electrons is exponentially suppressed {{relative to the}} characteristic charge energy, the Fermi energy E_F. At non-zero temperature T, the energy hierarchy J ≪ T ≪ E_F can be reached, and we refer to this as the spin incoherent Lutinger liquid state. We discuss the Coulomb drag between two parallel quantum wires in the spin incoherent regime, {{as well as the}} crossover to this state from the low temperature regime by using a model of a fluctuating Wigner solid. As the temperature increases from zero to above J for a fixed electron density, the 2 k_F oscillations in the density-density correlations are lost. As a result, the temperature dependence of the Coulomb drag is dramatically altered and non-monotonic dependence may result. <b>Drag</b> between <b>wires</b> of equal and unequal density are discussed, as well as the effects of weak disorder in the wires.
