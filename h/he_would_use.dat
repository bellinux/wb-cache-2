5|$|After {{being hurt}} {{in a fall}} in his bathtub after {{slipping}} on a bar of soap, Miller was expected to withdraw and the Republican leadership hoped for a deal as late as May 15, the day Miller was to hold a press conference Ohio political observers thought <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>use</b> to announce his withdrawal. However, Miller stayed in the race and the two incumbents faced {{each other in the}} Republican primary on June 2, 1992.|$|E
5|$|At {{his home}} in Much Hadham, Moore built up a {{collection}} of natural objects; skulls, driftwood, pebbles, rocks and shells, which <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>use</b> to provide inspiration for organic forms. For his largest works, he usually produced a half-scale, working model before scaling up for the final moulding and casting at a bronze foundry. Moore often refined the final full plaster shape and added surface marks before casting.|$|E
25|$|He {{attacked}} {{a large number}} of women, and while <b>he</b> <b>would</b> often <b>use</b> his bare hand, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> occasionally <b>use</b> a rod. Some of his victims were left badly injured by the attacks. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> appear, carry out his attacks and vanish with such speed that some people attributed him with supernatural powers.|$|R

5|$|He next {{turned to}} the subject of wartime female factory workers in The Most Beautiful, a {{propaganda}} film which he shot in a semi-documentary style in early 1944. In order to coax realistic performances from his actresses, the director had them live in a real factory during the shoot, eat the factory food and call each other by their character names. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>use</b> similar methods with his performers throughout his career.|$|E
5|$|In the {{off-season}} Shero {{decided that the}} team would be more successful if he coached them like he had coached his minor league teams. Upon being elevated to the NHL, he {{had decided not to}} employ systems like he did in the minors, stating that he had too much respect for NHL players. However, he decided that since he had the same kind of players on the Flyers as he did in the minors, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>use</b> the same systems, becoming the first coach to employ systems.|$|E
5|$|Jon Horford {{announced}} on April 10 that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>use</b> his year of redshirt eligibility by transferring to a graduate program at another school. By graduating, he became immediately eligible to join another {{team for the}} 2014–15 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. On April 26, Horford {{announced that he would}} play for the Florida Gators men's basketball team. Jordan Morgan graduated after using all his eligibility, signing as an undrafted free agent to play with the Minnesota Timberwolves in the July 2014 NBA Summer League.|$|E

5|$|Kurosawa {{nevertheless}} {{continued to}} work. He wrote the original screenplays The Sea is Watching in 1993 and After the Rain in 1995. While putting {{finishing touches on}} the latter work in 1995, Kurosawa slipped and broke {{the base of his}} spine. Following the accident, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>use</b> a wheelchair {{for the rest of his}} life, putting an end to any hopes of him directing another film. His longtime wish—to die on the set while shooting a movie—was never to be fulfilled.|$|E
5|$|A {{different}} {{version of}} Lex Luthor's history {{is presented in}} Adventure Comics #6 (March 2010), in which Lionel is an abusive alcoholic single parent who terrorizes Lex and his sister Lena. He dies of a heart-attack, leaving Lena {{in the care of}} an aunt and causes Lex to leave Smallville. It is later revealed that Lex had caused his father's heart attack to cash in a sizable life insurance policy, which <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>use</b> as the basis for his fortune. In Blackest Night #6, Lionel Luthor is revived {{as a member of the}} Black Lantern Corps. Lionel Luthor appears with Lex Luthor in the Flashpoint reality where they tour General Sam Lane's facility of aliens.|$|E
5|$|Charles, however, decreed on 22 September {{that all}} reformers must {{reconcile}} with the Catholic faith, or <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>use</b> {{military force to}} suppress them. This prompted Melanchthon to call a meeting with Bucer and after lengthy discussions they agreed on nine theses, which they sent to Luther and to Strasbourg. The Strasbourg magistrates forwarded them to Basel and Zürich. Bucer met Luther in Coburg on 26–28 September. Luther still rejected Bucer's theses, but he encouraged him to continue the search for unity. Bucer then traveled to several southern German cities, including Ulm, Isny, Konstanz, Memmingen, and Lindau, and to the Swiss cities of Basel and Zürich. In Zurich on 12 October, he presented the articles to Zwingli, who neither opposed him nor agreed with him.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the season}} on March 28, both Andrew Dakich and Mark Donnal {{announced}} that they would graduate and transfer to other programs as 5th-year graduate transfers. On April 10, both D. J. Wilson and Moe Wagner declared for the 2017 NBA draft, but did not hire agents, which gave them until May 24 to withdraw their names and retain their athletic eligibility to return to Michigan. 57 of the 78 players who declared for the 2016 NBA draft without hiring an agent withdrew their names. On May 1, Donnal announced that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>use</b> his final year of eligibility {{to play with the}} 2017–18 Clemson Tigers. On May 24, Wagner withdrew his name from the NBA draft and Wilson did not.|$|E
5|$|Jonathan Swift, then Dean of St Patrick's Cathedral in Dublin, {{was already}} {{known for his}} concern for the Irish people and for writing several {{political}} pamphlets. One of these, Proposal for the Universal use of Irish Manufacture (1720), had so inflamed the British authorities that the printer, John Harding, was prosecuted, although the pamphlet had done little more than recommend that the Irish use the materials they produce rather than export them to England. It was also known by the Irish authorities that Swift's political pamphleteering had been employed by the Tory government of Queen Anne, and that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>use</b> his abilities to undermine the Whig government of Walpole.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} at Sacrifice was a Three Way {{match for the}} TNA World Heavyweight Championship between then-champion Samoa Joe and challengers Kurt Angle and Scott Steiner. At TNA's {{previous}} PPV event Lockdown on April13, Joe defeated Angle in a Six Sides of Steel Cage match to win the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. Prior to Lockdown on the April3 episode of Impact!, Steiner announced that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>use</b> his Feast or Fired TNA World Heavyweight Title shot at Sacrifice. Staying true to his word, on the April17 episode of Impact!, Steiner challenged Joe to a title defense at Sacrifice. Angle and Joe fought in a rematch for the title on the April24 episode of Impact!; Joe won after Steiner interfered. In response to Steiner's interference, Management Director Jim Cornette scheduled a Three Way match between Angle, Joe, and Steiner for the title at Sacrifice.|$|E

5|$|Two {{years after}} his draft, Bertuzzi and the Islanders {{had not yet been}} agreed to a contract. With Bertuzzi {{eligible}} to re-enter the draft if the Islanders did not sign him by July 7, 1995, general manager Don Maloney made it apparent that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>use</b> the team's second overall pick in the 1995 NHL Entry Draft to select him again if a contract could not be agreed upon by the required date. Moments before the midnight deadline, the Islanders were able to sign Bertuzzi to a four-year, US$4.6 million contract. His agent, Pat Morris, had reportedly wanted a similar deal to that of fellow Islanders prospect Brett Lindros – a five-year, $6.7 million contract signed the previous summer.|$|E
5|$|Barkley was a {{prolific}} scorer who averaged 22.1 points-per-game {{during the regular}} season for his career and 23.0 points-per-game in the playoffs for his career. Barkley was an incredibly efficient offensive force, leading the NBA in 2-point field goal percentage every season from the 1986–87 season to the 1990–91 season. He led the league in effective field goal percentage in both the 1986–87 and 1987–88 seasons as well, and also led the league in offensive rating in both the 1988–89 and 1989–90 seasons. He was one of the NBA's most versatile players and accurate scorers capable of scoring from anywhere on the court and established himself as one of the NBA's premier clutch players. During his NBA career, Barkley was a constant mismatch because he possessed a set of very uncommon skills and could play in a variety of positions. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>use</b> all facets of his game in a single play; as a scorer, he had the ability to score from the perimeter and the post, using an array of spin moves and fadeaways, or finishing a fast break with a powerful dunk. He {{was one of the most}} efficient scorers of all-time, scoring at 54.13% total field goal percentage for his season career and 51.34% total field goal shooting for his playoff career (including a career-high season average of 60% during the 1989–90 NBA season).|$|E
5|$|By 1823 Cofresí was {{probably}} on {{the crew of the}} corsair barquentine El Scipión, captained by José Ramón Torres and managed by his cousin (the first mayor of Mayagüez, José María Ramírez de Arellano). Historians agree, since several of his friends and family members benefited from the sale of stolen goods. Cofresí may have joined to evade the authorities, honing skills <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>use</b> later in life. El Scipión employed questionable tactics later associated with the pirate, such as flying the flag of Gran Colombia so other ships would lower their guard (as she did in capturing the British frigate Aurora and the American brigantine Otter). The capture of Otter led to a court order requiring restitution, affecting the crew. At this time, Cofresí turned to piracy. Although the reasons behind his decision are unclear, several theories have been proposed by researchers. In Orígenes portorriqueños Ramírez Brau speculates that Cofresí's time aboard El Scipión, or seeing a family member become a privateer, may have influenced his decision to become a pirate after the crew's pay was threatened by the lawsuit. According to Ursula Acosta, a lack of work for privateers ultimately pushed Cofresí into piracy.|$|E

50|$|Molodkin later {{served in}} the Russian Army, where he worked in Siberia {{delivering}} oil. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> also <b>use</b> his army-issue ballpoint pens to draw and, whilst in the Army, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> eat bread smeared in oil and dried on a radiator instead of taking drugs.|$|R
5|$|By March, Clarke's {{deception}} operations {{had grown}} {{and it was}} decided to create a formal department. He chose the name Advanced Headquarters 'A' Force - the 'A' being a subtle reference to airborne - in the hope that it would help support the existence of paratroopers in the area (as well as hide the true purpose of the department). Clarke continued actively promoting the existence of 1st SAS until around June 1941, and it appears that Axis commanders accepted the brigade as real. Clarke had created the unit with no specific aims, although it did mean that the enemy command had to factor the existence of airborne troops into any battle plan. However, Abeam and the 1st SAS represented his first attempt at inflating the apparent strength of Allied forces, a tactic <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>use</b> significantly over the rest of the war. The brigade occasionally featured in Clarke's tactical deceptions; such as a March 1941 threat to Axis supply lines near Tripoli.|$|E
5|$|On December 11, 2015, Albrecht {{announced}} he would sit {{out the rest of}} the season for the 2015–16 Wolverines team due to injuries. He will concentrate on his continued recovery and the rehabilitation process following bilateral hip surgery this past summer. During his career at Michigan, Albrecht played in 115 career games, and was named Michigan's co-MVP during the 2014–15 season, after starting 18 of 31 games and posting a career-best 7.5 points per game, while battling hip problems. On March 29, Albrecht announced that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>use</b> the graduate transfer option to play a fifth year at another school. On April 1, head coach John Beilein decided not to restrict Albrecht or teammate Ricky Doyle from transferring to schools within the Big Ten if they desired to do so. By April 18, Albrecht was considering interest from home state Big Ten programs Purdue and Indiana as well as Wichita State, Texas A, Syracuse, USC, and Milwaukee (where Michigan assistant coach LaVall Jordan had just taken over as head coach).|$|E
5|$|Shortly before Golden Abyss, Guerro {{had enough}} money to equip his army with guns, turrets, {{vehicles}} and explosives, but still needed more. He was approached by an archaeologist, Vincent Perez, and his partner Jason Dante, who wished to investigate ruins within Guerro's territory on a potential lead to Quivira, one of the Seven Cities of Gold. Guerro agreed, presumably planning to kill both Perez and Dante {{when he had the}} gold, which <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>use</b> to fund the revolution. After Perez's disappearance, he allowed Dante to take over the excavation only if he complied with orders. Guerro interrogates both Chase and Dante after he captures Drake. Chase manages to escape with Drake and her amulet. Guerro captures Chase and steals the sword of Stephen from Drake. Drake and Sully find the Serpent Temple where Dante's mercenaries and Guerro's thugs are fighting.Guerro wounds Chase badly before being thrown off a bridge by Nate.|$|E
