40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} 3 D body scanning technologies with applications to the fashion and apparel industry. Complete systems for the digitization {{of the human body}} exist since more than fifteen years. One of the main users of this technology with application in the textile field was the military industry. In fact, body scanning technology is being successfully employed since many years in military bases for a fast selection of the correct size of uniforms for the entire staff. Complete solutions were especially developed for this field of application. Many different research projects were issued for the exploitation of the same technology in the commercial field. Experiments were performed and start-up projects are to time running {{in different parts of the}} world by installing full body scanning systems in various locations such as shopping malls, boutiques or dedicated scanning centers. Everything is actually ready to be exploited and all the required hardware, software and solutions are available: full body scanning systems, software for the automatic and reliable extraction of body measurements, <b>e-kiosk</b> and web solutions for the presentation of garments, high-end and low-end virtual-try-on systems. However, complete solutions in this area have still not yet found the expected commercial success. Today, with the on-going large cost reduction given by the appearance of new competitors, methods for digitization of the human body becomes more interesting for the fashion and apparel industry. Therefore, a large expansion of these technologies is expected in the near future...|$|E
40|$|Foreword: On {{behalf of}} the Organizing Committee, it is my {{pleasure}} to welcome you to Hohenheim, Stuttgart for the 2 nd International eHealth Symposium which is themed 'Process of change in organisations through eHealth'. Starting with the inaugural event in 2009, {{which took place in}} Turku, Finland, we want to implement a tradition of international eHealth symposia. The presentations and associated papers in this proceedings give a current and representative outline of technical options, application potentials, usability, acceptance and potential for optimization in health care by ICT. We are pleased to present a high-quality program. This year we convey a unique opportunity for academic researchers and industry practitioners to report their state-of-the-art research findings in the domain of eHealth. The symposium aims to foster the international community by gathering experts from various countries such as Australia, Great Britain, Finland and Germany. A first step is done by this symposium which considers this interaction and delivers an insight into current advances made and open research questions. The organizers would like to take the opportunity to thank all the people which made the Symposium possible. We are pleased if both attendance to the 2 nd International eHealth Symposium 2010 and reading of this proceedings give you answers to urging questions, a basis for critical discussions, references on interesting tasks and stimulations for new approaches.

40|$|The e-health {{sector in}} Germany is {{currently}} {{focused on the}} e-health card concept. This e-health card will totally change the current system, since it will allow several new functions. Because enrollees have concerns about their data, the health insurance companies have to ensure that enrollees have the possibility to check and manage their data. Therefore, electronic kiosk systems (<b>e-kiosks)</b> are being developed and must be useable by all citizens. Hence, this paper serves to identify possibilities pertaining to how these terminals {{can be adapted to}} ensure that all people can use these <b>e-kiosks</b> effectively and efficientl...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis era {{is called}} as ICT era which {{comprises}} the ICT Mediated Agriculture Extension in Rural {{as well as}} Urban areas to disseminate the ethics of information by Decision Support System (DSS), Management Information System(MIS) and Expert System(ES) by impregnating the User Interface and Knowledge Management System. So, E-Agriculture, therefore describes an emerging field focused on the enhancement of agricultural and rural development through improved information and communication process. The main Objective is to provide an Interface to farmers and consumers and to facilitate linking up of agriculture produce marketing cooperative.
