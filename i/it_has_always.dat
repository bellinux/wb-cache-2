5|$|<b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> been {{important}} for the Space Telescope to capture the public's imagination, given the considerable contribution of taxpayers to its construction and operational costs. After the difficult early years when the faulty mirror severely dented Hubble's reputation with the public, the first servicing mission allowed its rehabilitation as the corrected optics produced numerous remarkable images.|$|E
5|$|They {{believe it}} is a Christianity {{that is in the}} New Testament; that <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> been there, that in the drift of ages it was lost through disuse and neglect, and that this benefactor has found it and given it back to men, turning the night of life into day, its terrors into myths, its lamentations into songs of {{emancipation}} and rejoicing.|$|E
5|$|Children, ages 11â€“17, {{volunteer}} to become altar servers {{not only to}} serve the church but also because <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> been looked upon as an honor. It {{is a chance for}} children to serve their priest and become closer to Jesus by being on the altar. In addition, it is an opportunity for them to try to make themselves more holy and therefore more worthy of the position.|$|E

5|$|Historically, {{only those}} wishing to use {{specialised}} material unavailable in other public or academic libraries {{would be given}} a Reader Pass. The Library has been criticised for admitting numbers of undergraduate students, {{who have access to}} their own university libraries, to the reading rooms. The Library replied that <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> admitted undergraduates {{as long as they have}} a legitimate personal, work-related or academic research purpose.|$|E
5|$|Obligatory {{psychological}} {{testing for}} gun owners {{is a common}} subject of discussion, but <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> been rejected. Gun advocates {{point out that the}} nature of the tests and the parties responsible for them are not clear. It is also pointed out that it is unlikely that any psychological testing would reveal a potentially dangerous individual, because some famous killers in the past were members of the military or the law enforcement and passed very difficult psychological testing successfully.|$|E

5|$|Railways {{have been}} the primary way of linking {{countries}} in the Eurasian Economic Union since the 19th century. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> been the main way of transport in the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union up until today. The union ranks 2nd {{in the world in}} terms of railway trackage (about 7.8% of the world's share). However it is still looking to improve cross-border trade within the union.|$|E
5|$|After impressing {{with the}} {{reserves}} in 2001, Hall {{was drafted by}} Essendon with the 46th selection in the 2002 AFL Rookie Draft, thereby placing him on the Bombers' rookie list. Speaking to The Mercury, Hall described the opportunity as exciting said that <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> been his dream {{to play in the}} AFL. In the lead-up to the 2002 season Hall played in all three of Essendon's pre-season matches, of which the Bombers lost every game. Rookie listed players must be promoted to the senior list before they play a senior AFL match, so Hall began the 2002 season playing in the VFL for Essendon's reserves team.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, Felix's {{party is}} able to achieve {{entrance}} into Piers' home, a legendary, secluded Atlantis-like society named Lemuria far out in the ocean. When they convene with Lemuria's ancient king, Hydros, they learn about Alchemy's true nature; <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> been the sustenance of Weyard's very life force, and its absence over the past ages has caused the world's continents to decrease in size {{and parts of the}} world to collapse into the abyss. Knowing that restoring Alchemy is what must be done to actually save the world, Felix crosses the sea in order to activate Jupiter Lighthouse. But when Isaac's pursuing party enters the lighthouse, they are trapped and ambushed by Karst and Agatio. Felix rescues Isaac, but Karst and Agatio escape with the Mars Star formerly in Isaac's possession.|$|E

5|$|Texas Tech's other mascot, Raider Red, is a {{more recent}} creation. Beginning with the 1971 {{football}} season, the Southwest Conference forbade the inclusion of live animal mascots to away games unless the host school consented. For situations where the host school {{did not want to}} allow the Masked Rider's horse, an alternate mascot was needed. Jim Gaspard, a member of the Saddle Tramps student spirit organization, created the original design for the Raider Red costume, basing it on a character created by cartoonist Dirk West, a Texas Tech alumnus and former Lubbock mayor. Though the Masked Rider's identity is public knowledge, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> been tradition that Raider Red's student alter ego is kept secret until the end of his or her tenure. The student serving as Raider Red {{is a member of the}} Saddle Tramps or High Riders.|$|E
5|$|York's {{location}} on the River Ouse and in {{the centre of the}} Vale of York means that <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> had a significant position in the nation's transport system. The city grew up as a river port at the confluence of the River Ouse and the River Foss. The Ouse was originally a tidal river, accessible to seagoing ships of the time. Today both of these rivers remain navigable, although the Foss is only navigable for a short distance above the confluence. A lock at Naburn on the Ouse to the south of York means that the river in York is no longer tidal.|$|E

50|$|On January 1, 2002, the station's city of licence became Montreal (<b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> officially been Verdun until then), as {{a result}} of forced {{municipal}} mergers which made Verdun a Montreal borough.|$|R

50|$|Though not {{successful}} {{in building a}} town, the colony prospered. A post office was secured, and a postal route established from Leavenworth via Hyatt, in Anderson County, Carlyle and Cofachique to Humboldt, in 1858. A church and schoolhouse was afterward built, a high school kept up, {{and part of the}} time there has been a store, while <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> retained the post office. Carlyle was well known and <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> been a prosperous and progressive neighborhood. When the Leavenworth, Lawrence and Galveston railroad (later the K.C., L. & S.K. R.R.) was built, Carlyle was made a station.|$|R
