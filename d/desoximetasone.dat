50|$|When using <b>desoximetasone,</b> {{some of the}} {{medication}} may be absorbed through the skin and into the bloodstream. Too much absorption can lead to unwanted side effects elsewhere in the body. Large amounts of <b>desoximetasone</b> should be avoided over large areas. It {{should not be used}} for extended periods of time. Treated areas should not be covered with airtight dressings such as plastic wrap or adhesive bandages. Children may absorb more medication than adults do. <b>Desoximetasone</b> is for use only on the skin and should be kept out of the eyes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Desoximetasone</b> is a {{medication}} {{belonging to the}} family of medications known as topical corticosteroids. It is used for the relief of various skin conditions, including rashes. It helps to reduce redness, itching, and irritation. <b>Desoximetasone</b> is a synthetic corticosteroid, a class of primarily synthetic steroids used as anti-inflammatory and anti-pruritic agents.|$|E
50|$|<b>Desoximetasone</b> {{can also}} be used to treat some types of psoriasis.|$|E
50|$|Examples of methasones include alclometasone, amelometasone, beclometasone, betamethasone, cormetasone, <b>desoximetasone,</b> dexamethasone, flumetasone, halometasone, icometasone, mometasone, and paramethasone, among others.|$|E
5000|$|Moisturizers and emollients such as mineral oil, {{petroleum}} jelly, calcipotriol, and decubal (an oil-in-water emollient) {{were found}} to increase the clearance of psoriatic plaques. Emollients {{have been shown to}} be even more effective at clearing psoriatic plaques when combined with phototherapy. However, certain emollients have no impact on psoriasis plaque clearance or may even decrease the clearance achieved with phototherapy. The emollient salicylic acid is structurally similar to para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), commonly found in sunscreen, and is known to interfere with phototherapy in psoriasis. Coconut oil, when used as an emollient in psoriasis, has been found to decrease plaque clearance with phototherapy. [...] Medicated creams and ointments applied directly to psoriatic plaques can help reduce inflammation, remove built-up scale, reduce skin turnover, and clear affected skin of plaques. Ointment and creams containing coal tar, dithranol, corticosteroids (i.e. <b>desoximetasone),</b> fluocinonide, vitamin D3 analogs (for example, calcipotriol), and retinoids are routinely used. The use of the finger tip unit may be helpful in guiding how much topical treatment to use.|$|E
40|$|We have {{presented}} here our {{results of a}} comparative double-blind study with <b>desoximetasone,</b> a new topical corticosteroid and beta-methasone valerate, in 55 patients followed up for a period of 14 days, <b>Desoximetasone</b> had significantly earlier onset of action and greater effect on various signs and symptoms associated with dermatoses suitable for treatment with topical steroids. Both the treatments were well tolerated...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. This {{prospective}} study {{was aimed at}} examining the modification of ultrasound characteristics of psoriatic plaques during <b>desoximetasone</b> and dithranol treatment. Material and Methods. The examination included 50 patients with chronic plaque-type psoriasis to whom 0. 25 % <b>desoximetasone</b> and dithranol was applied on the psoriatic lesions {{in the period of}} 21 days. The changes were measured before and every 7 days after the beginning of therapy by the combined application of Aand B-mode echosonography. Results. At the beginning of the examination, the average values of the enter echo were 0. 67 ± 0. 53 mm; hypoehogen shadow 0. 30 ± 0. 11 mm, and dermis thickness 3. 03 ± 1. 05 mm. On the first check up, the average values of the enter echo were 0. 45 ± 0. 29 mm; hypoechogen shadow 0. 23 ± 0. 08 mm and dermis thickness 2. 65 ± 0. 97 mm. On the second check up, the average values of the enter echo were 0. 30 ± 0. 18 mm; hypoechogen shadow 0. 21 ± 0. 18 mm, dermis thickness 2. 18 ± 0. 82 mm. On the third check up, the average values of the enter echo were 0. 24 ± 0. 17 mm; hypoechogen shadow 0. 18 ± 0. 17 mm, and dermis thickness 1. 8 ± 0. 69 mm. Discussion. The evaluation of the ultrasonographic characteristics revealed a significant reduction in the values {{in the course of the}} examination. Statistically significant differences were found before, during, and at the end of the examination by recording the ultrasound parameters of the epidermis and dermis and by following their modification. Conclusion. Precise determination of ultrasound parameters of epidermis and dermis and the possibility of recording their modification in a shorter or longer time interval can be used for monitoring and assessment of therapy effect of a medication...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: We {{report on}} a double-blind, vehicle-controlled, single-center confirmatory study with random assignment. The {{purpose of the study}} was to {{investigate}} the topical bioavailability of different topical corticosteroid formulations in healthy human beings focussing on <b>desoximetasone</b> (DM). Materials and Methods: Two DM 0. 25 % formulations {[}ointment (DM-o) and fatty ointment (DM-fo, water-free); class III corticosteroids], the corresponding active ingredient-free vehicles and three comparators of different strength {[}clobetasol propionate 0. 05 % (CP 0. 05 %), fatty ointment, class IV; hydrocortisone (HC) 1 %, fatty ointment, class I, and betamethasone (BM) 0. 05 %, fatty ointment, class III] were tested using the vasoconstriction assay. The degree of vasoconstriction (blanching) in the treatment field was compared to the one found in untreated control fields using chromametric measurements and clinical assessment. Results/Conclusion: DM-o 0. 25 %, DM-fo 0. 25 % and BM 0. 05 % showed similar vasoconstrictive potential, i. e., clear blanching. In fact, both DM preparations were proven to be non-inferior to BM 0. 05 %, while CP 0. 05 % was found a little less active. HC 1. 0 % and the DM vehicles showed no clear-cut vasoconstrictive effect. No adverse events related to the study medications were observed. Good topical bioavailability of both DM formulations was detected by chromametric measurement and clinical assessment.
