And then the paper shows the distribution of the residual stress in different depths of rolled crankshaft fillet through numerical simulation. It is found that the fatigue strength can greatly be produced by the method of the engine crankshaft <b>fillet</b> <b>rolling</b> in most of fillet areas; Simultaneously, two strips of tensile stress which is related to reduce the crankshaft fatigue strength will be generated in the peripheries. The tensile stress strips only emerge in the surface layer of the fillet, and then mainly disappear in the depths of 0. 4 mm below the surface layer.
