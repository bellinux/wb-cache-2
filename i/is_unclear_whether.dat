5|$|A. v. gracilipes {{inhabited}} Culebra Island {{and is now}} extinct. It <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> it was {{substantially different}} from the nominate subspecies.|$|E
5|$|Austin Hobart Clark {{reported}} that juvenile Cuban macaws were green, {{though he did}} not provide any source for this claim. It <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> green birds spotted on the island were in fact juvenile Cuban macaws or if they were instead feral military macaws (Ara militaris).|$|E
5|$|Bales' lawyer, John Henry Browne, later {{stated that}} his client was upset because a fellow soldier had lost a leg in an {{explosion}} on 9 March. It <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> the bombing cited by Browne {{was the same as}} the one described by the villagers.|$|E

5|$|In his 1995 revision, Nelson {{refers to}} {{putative}} hybrids with A.dobsonii and A.apiculatus, citing the 1978 paper {{in which he}} published putative hybrids with A.dobsonii and A.forrestii. It <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> the reference to A.apiculatus is an error or a fourth putative hybrid.|$|E
5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> the {{operations}} were successful, {{due to the}} complexity of their execution, poor weather, and lack of response from German forces. It is possible that they contributed to the overall confusion of D-Day as part of the wider Bodyguard plan.|$|E
5|$|It {{is widely}} {{suspected}} that the anaerobic bacterial species Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) contributes {{to the development of}} acne, but its exact role is not well understood. There are specific sub-strains of P. acnes associated with normal skin, and moderate or severe inflammatory acne. It <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> these undesirable strains evolve on-site or are acquired, or possibly both depending on the person. These strains have the capability of changing, perpetuating, or adapting to the abnormal cycle of inflammation, oil production, and inadequate sloughing of dead skin cells from acne pores. Infection with the parasitic mite Demodex is associated with the development of acne. It <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> eradication of the mite improves acne.|$|E
50|$|For decades it <b>was</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> Schmidt {{had ever}} {{actually}} {{been a real}} person, or whether the experiments had succeeded as Taylor recalled.|$|R
5000|$|In 1919, German stamps were handstamped [...] "LIBAU", but it <b>was</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> they <b>were</b> officially issued; {{all used}} copies are {{cancelled}} to order.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of the population (60%) continued to support legalising brothels, but it <b>was</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> they preferred the ALP or Coalition version of this.|$|R
5|$|Many major {{web sites}} patched the bug or {{disabled}} the Heartbeat Extension {{within days of}} its announcement, but it <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> potential attackers were aware of it earlier {{and to what extent}} it was exploited.|$|E
5|$|Paxillus involutus also {{contains}} agents which appear to damage chromosomes; it <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> these have carcinogenic or mutagenic potential. Two compounds {{that have been}} identified are the phenols involutone and involutin; the latter {{is responsible for the}} brownish discolouration upon bruising.|$|E
5|$|Screenings of Subway Sadie {{occurred}} {{as late as}} January 12, 1928. As of November 2007, it <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> a print of the film exists; it has likely become a lost film. A poster of the film {{can be seen at}} the New York Transit Museum.|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} Persian troops present at Thermopylae is {{therefore}} as uncertain {{as the number}} for the total invasion force. For instance, it <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> the whole Persian army marched as far as Thermopylae, or whether Xerxes left garrisons in Macedon and Thessaly.|$|E
5|$|The opening {{theme is}} {{repeated}} throughout. The song lacks a traditional chorus, and the melody and lyrics are ambiguous about the opening stanza's {{position in the}} song; it <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> the song has just begun, is in the verse, or is in the bridge.|$|E
5|$|Currently, it <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> {{waves are}} an {{efficient}} heating mechanism. All waves except Alfvén waves {{have been found}} to dissipate or refract before reaching the corona. In addition, Alfvén waves do not easily dissipate in the corona. Current research focus has therefore shifted towards flare heating mechanisms.|$|E
50|$|Malaysia also {{planned to}} {{evacuate}} its 879 citizens from Yemen, {{according to its}} Foreign Minister, Anifah Aman, but it <b>was</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> they would <b>be</b> moved out by air or land.|$|R

5|$|Dozens of {{communities}} across America have suffered thefts of Baby Jesus figurines, and, in some instances, entire nativity scenes, Washington, D.C. journalist Daniel Nasaw reports for the British newspaper The Guardian. He observes that it <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> such theft {{is on the}} rise, as it is not tracked by federal law enforcement.|$|E
5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> John Doukas married once or twice. The name of {{only one}} wife, Zoe Doukaina, is known. She was the {{daughter}} of Constantine Doukas and Anna Doukaina, whose exact identity is unclear. If he married twice, then his first marriage took place c. 1150, and his unknown first wife must have died c. 1165. If Zoe Doukaina was indeed his second wife, this marriage took place c. 1170.|$|E
5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> Sheshi is {{mentioned}} in the Aegyptiaca, a history of Egypt written in the 3rd century BC {{during the reign of}} Ptolemy II (283–246 BC) by the Egyptian priest Manetho. Indeed, the Aegyptiaca only reports Hellenized names for Egyptian pharaohs and the identification of Sheshi with any particular name remains controversial.|$|E
50|$|Government {{websites}} {{that experienced}} problems on 7 April 2013 included {{those of the}} Israeli Ministry of Education and Central Bureau of Statistics, but it <b>was</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> these problems <b>were</b> caused by #OpIsrael.|$|R

5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> {{the story}} of the Tree That Owns Itself began with the Weekly Banner article, or if it had been an element of local {{folklore}} prior to that time. The article's author writes that, in 1890, there were few people still living who knew the story.|$|E
5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> triple-alpha helium fusion {{has started}} {{at the core of}} Eta Carinae A. The {{elemental}} abundances at the surface cannot be accurately measured, but ejecta within the Homunculus are around 60% hydrogen and 40% helium, with nitrogen enhanced to ten times solar levels. This is indicative of ongoing CNO cycle hydrogen fusion.|$|E
5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>whether,</b> as Bede understood, Sigebert and Eorpwald were brothers, {{or whether}} they shared the same mother but not the same father, as was stated by the 12th century chronicler William of Malmesbury. According to the {{historian}} Barbara Yorke, Sigebert {{may have been a}} member of a different line of Wuffings who as his rival was forced into exile, {{in order to ensure that}} Eorpwald became king.|$|E
