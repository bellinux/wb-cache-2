25|$|The International Commission of Jurists {{have stated}} that though the attacks had not been proven beyond a <b>doubt,</b> <b>there</b> was {{credible}} evidence that it had happened. In 2011, the State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) asked for the reopening of the case.|$|E
25|$|By August 1968, the NL {{owners had}} grown {{increasingly}} {{concerned about the}} unresolved stadium question, putting the franchise's future in <b>doubt.</b> <b>There</b> were rumours of awarding the franchise to Buffalo, New York instead, whose War Memorial Stadium was ready to host a team. League president Warren Giles was reassured of Montreal's viability when shown a 3,000-seat community field in the centrally located Jarry Park that Drapeau proposed expanding to 30,000 seats as a temporary home for the Expos, {{at a cost of}} over C$1 million.|$|E
25|$|It is {{a matter}} of some dispute how much credit Dirichlet deserves for the modern {{definition}} of a function, in part because he restricted his definition to continuous functions....I believe Dirichlet defined the notion of continuous function {{to make it clear that}} no rule or law is required even in the case of continuous functions, not just in general. This would have deserved special emphasis because of Euler's definition of a continuous function as one given by single expression-or law. But I also <b>doubt</b> <b>there</b> is sufficient evidence to settle the dispute.|$|E

25|$|Vale Royal was {{purchased}} by ICI in 1947. The chemical company initially used the abbey as staff accommodation and then, from 1954 to 1961, as the headquarters for its Alkali Division. ICI moved out in 1961 and for some years the future of Vale Royal was in <b>doubt.</b> <b>There</b> were abortive schemes to use the abbey as a health centre, a country club, a school and even a prison (this latter proposal was resisted by local inhabitants as strongly, though less violently, as the original foundation of the abbey had been, and did not occur). In 1977, the abbey {{was made into a}} residential care home for people with learning difficulties. Since 1998, Vale Royal has been home to a private golf club. In addition to use by the members, the house is available for weddings and corporate and private events.|$|E
500|$|Nigel Rumfitt QC, {{defending}} Awan, summarised {{the crime}} by stating: [...] "These {{people were not}} taking the night air. Every {{member of the group}} knew what was going on. These weapons had been selected before they set off. The knife was far too big to be hidden from the others. There is no <b>doubt</b> <b>there</b> was a hunting party looking for a victim." ...|$|E
500|$|These {{conclusions}} on the 16th Dynasty {{have been}} accepted by many scholars, including Ben-Tor, James Peter Allen, Susan Allen, Baker and Redford. Yet, for both Redford and Bietak [...] "without <b>doubt,</b> <b>there</b> were, {{under the umbrella of}} the fifteenth dynasty rulers, a series of vassals in southern and coastal Palestine, in Middle Egypt, and in Thebes.... Such was the political system of the Hyksos, and typical of the Amorite kingdoms in Syria and the city-states in Palestine".|$|E

500|$|Nicolas Giffard summarises {{the modern}} {{assessment}} of the Budapest Gambit: an old opening, seldom used by champions without having fallen in disgrace. While White has several methods to get a small advantage, this defence is strategically sound. Black gets a good pawn structure and possibilities of attack on the kingside. His problems generally come from the white pressure on the d-column {{and a lack of}} space to manoeuvre his pieces. Boris Avrukh writes, [...] "The Budapest Gambit is almost a respectable opening; I <b>doubt</b> <b>there</b> is a refutation. Even in the lines where White manages to keep an extra pawn, Black always has a lot of play for it." ...|$|E
500|$|Other early {{documented}} uses of {{the phrase}} are from reviews by critic Mike Saunders. In the November 12, 1970 issue of Rolling Stone, he commented on an album put out the previous year by the British band Humble Pie: [...] "Safe as Yesterday Is, their first American release, proved that Humble Pie could be boring in lots of different ways. Here they were a noisy, unmelodic, heavy metal-leaden shit-rock band with the loud and noisy parts beyond <b>doubt.</b> <b>There</b> {{were a couple of}} nice songs...and one monumental pile of refuse". He described the band's latest, self-titled release as [...] "more of the same 27th-rate heavy metal crap".|$|E
500|$|Nagle {{credited}} {{herself with}} [...] "dragging the Jockey Club {{into the twentieth}} century". She said: [...] "This {{was a matter of}} principle. I am a feminist. I believe in equal rights for women. Things should be decided by ability, not sex". [...] At odds with Nagle's view, in her court case Lord Justice Salmon commented that [...] "No <b>doubt</b> <b>there</b> are occupations, such as boxing, which may be reasonably regarded inherently unsuitable for women", and Lord Denning had gone on to say that [...] "It is not as if the training of horses could be regarded as an unsuitable occupation for a woman, like that of a jockey or speedway-rider"; it was another eight years before Jockey Club rules permitted women jockeys in 1972. When asked by a journalist in the late 1970s if she thought women could ever match men on the racecourse, Nagle replied: [...] "My dear man, it used to be said women couldn't stand up to three-day-eventing. Now they're beating the men regularly– and the same will happen in racing. Give them time." [...] Her endeavours led to her being described as [...] "the Mrs Pankhurst of British horse racing" [...] in Stud & Stable Magazine and [...] "Racing's Emily Pankhurst".|$|E

5000|$|The Bears {{could not}} score until the fourth quarter, and head coach Dick Jauron offered no excuses. During a postgame interview, he said, [...] "That {{certainly}} wasn't pretty in any area. It's frustrating, no <b>doubt.</b> <b>There's</b> nobody who's happy right now." ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{beginnings}} of the Court {{have been described as}} slow and tentative. No <b>doubt</b> <b>there</b> were many reasons for this, including the unfamiliarity of lawyers and litigants with the new Court, the speedy recall [...] to England of successive Lord Deputies, the wish of many [...] English-born judges to return home as quickly as possible, and the disruption caused by the Desmond Rebellions in the early 1580s.|$|E
2500|$|Norman Stone in The Times guest comment article though {{admitting that}} [...] "No <b>doubt</b> <b>there</b> are {{elements}} {{of truth in}} [...] ", wrote [...] "President Putin is popular, and from a Russian perspective, you can easily see why. Indeed, the outcome of his recent election more than slightly resembles General de Gaulle's success in 1958". He concluded on Putin: [...] "if Russians see him as the best hope, they should be understood." ...|$|E

2500|$|A further {{memorandum}} dated 9 June 1961 {{admitted that}} [...] "no <b>doubt</b> <b>there</b> {{will be a}} comeback from Mr Kirk MP who clearly has views {{on the merits of}} the proposal as well as the procedure adopted by the Consultative Committees" [...] but stated that [...] "the sooner the passenger service is closed, the greater the economy will be for the Railways who must already have lost a substantial amount during the last six months of argument." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{short story}} by Adams, [...] "Young Zaphod Plays It Safe", first {{appeared}} in The Utterly Utterly Merry Comic Relief Christmas Book, a special large-print compilation of different stories and pictures that raised money for the then-new Comic Relief charity in the UK.

30|$|In {{the case}} studies and expert interviews, an {{influence}} of the minimum wage on employment has been <b>doubted.</b> <b>There</b> {{is a shortage of}} skilled workers in the sector.

And I have seen for myself the very difficult and dangerous circumstances in which we ask our soldiers to serve. But the conclusions of this report are absolutely clear. There is no <b>doubt,</b> <b>there</b> is nothing equivocal, there are no ambiguities. What happened on Bloody Sunday was both unjustified and unjustifiable. It was wrong." ...|$|E
2500|$|Screamers {{occurs on}} the planet Sirius 6B, one of many colonies, and the only planet where the screamers were launched.

2500|$|In Howard's last election, he was {{defeated}} in the Seat of Bennelong by Labor candidate Maxine McKew, who had hosted Lateline during the Howard era. Peter Mares reported for Radio National that [...] "some wags described it as an 'internal promotion', while others said she'd simply moved from the 'media wing' to the 'political wing' of the ALP". Mares consulted ABC journalist turned NSW Liberal MLA Pru Goward who said: [...] " [...] I have no <b>doubt</b> <b>there</b> was left-wing bias, I certainly thought it when I was there", while McKew {{said there was no}} left wing bias, though [...] "what I detected years ago in the ABC, much more of a collectivist philosophy".|$|E
