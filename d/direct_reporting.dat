5|$|Born in a {{small town}} in the state of Veracruz, Martínez Pérez left her {{hometown}} to study journalism at Universidad Veracruzana. After graduating from university, she went to work at a state-owned television company in Chiapas in the early 1980s, but she encountered various forms of censorship that convinced her to pursue a career in print media. After five years in Chiapas, Martínez Pérez relocated to Veracruz and worked for several local newspapers. In Veracruz, Martínez Pérez faced several challenges of censorship by the political establishment for her <b>direct</b> <b>reporting,</b> and particularly for being an outspoken critic of human rights violations, government corruption, abuse of authority, and for her in-depth coverage of the drug trafficking organizations that operate in Veracruz.|$|E
5|$|His {{investigations}} angered many in Mexico's {{political elite}} {{and made him}} a frequent target of death threats. Buendía took the death threats he received very seriously and thereby carried a pistol, either on his belt or in a leather pocket. Prior to his death, Buendía wrote extensively on the alleged corruption within Mexico's Petroleum Workers Union; the allegations of wrongdoings of Jorge Díaz Serrano, former leader of Pemex, the national oil company; and Arturo Durazo Moreno, {{the former head of}} Mexico City's police force. Buendía also criticized the role of the U.S. government and the CIA in Mexico, and often published names of American officials involved in secret operations. Although he was quick to publish controversial reports, Buendía's <b>direct</b> <b>reporting</b> was respected and generally considered reliable given his access to top Mexican officials. He was the most-read journalist in Mexico's print media, and is often cited by newspapers and journalists as the most influential political columnist in Mexico of {{the second half of the}} 20th century.|$|E

40|$|Senior {{leadership}} positions in Jordanian Ministry of Education are held predominantly by men. Women are teachers and/or school principals. This under-representation {{of women is}} primarily due to culturally derived stereotypes that see women as teachers or school principals, but not as superintendents. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate, in practice, the difference between Jordanian men and women in their effectiveness as leaders as rated by themselves and their <b>direct</b> <b>reports</b> in Jordanian educational institutions. In other words, this study came to examine empirically the stereotypical assumption that women are rated by themselves and others to be less effective leaders than their male counterparts. This quantitative investigation employed the survey method as its research design. A variety of statistical techniques were utilized in this research. One-way analysis of variance, t-test, means, and standard deviations were used as the main sta-tistical techniques. Results of the study revealed that female leaders in Jordanian educational institutions, their female <b>direct</b> <b>reports,</b> and their male <b>direct</b> <b>reports</b> underrated their leadership effectiveness compared to male leaders, their male <b>direct</b> <b>reports,</b> and their female <b>direct</b> <b>reports.</b> However, this difference in rating is very slight and not statistically significant...|$|R
40|$|The happy {{productive}} worker (HPW) theory {{states that}} happy employees perform {{at higher levels}} than unhappy employees do. Despite the explanatory power of the HPW theory, it was unknown if a happy middle-level manager {{would be associated with}} productive <b>direct</b> <b>reports.</b> The purpose of this phenomenological study was to address that gap by exploring the impact of middle-level managers 2 ̆ 7 well-being and happiness on the performance of their <b>direct</b> <b>reports.</b> Key research questions examined how middle-level managers 2 ̆ 7 well-being and happiness influenced the performance of their <b>direct</b> <b>reports</b> and how middle-level managers 2 ̆ 7 application of the HPW theory influenced social change. Twenty middle-level managers from varied organizations participated in semistructured interviews to generate data. Data were subjected to content analysis to identify emergent categories and themes. Findings showed that middle-level managers 2 ̆ 7 well-being and happiness had both positive and negative influences on <b>direct</b> <b>reports</b> 2 ̆ 7 performance in that reports tended to mirror their middle-level manager 2 ̆ 7 s level of well-being and happiness. Whenever the middle level manager was happy, their reports 2 ̆ 7 productivity increased, and whenever the middle level manager was unhappy, reports 2 ̆ 7 productivity decreased. The overall conclusion was that middle-level managers 2 ̆ 7 well-being and happiness in the workplace are important and offer opportunities to help <b>direct</b> <b>reports</b> to grow and to flourish in their department of the organization. Recommendations include further study of the strategies middle-level managers use to influence <b>direct</b> <b>reports</b> 2 ̆ 7 advancement toward their potential. Organizational leaders may apply these findings through professional development training to enhance the growth and improve the productivity of their <b>direct</b> <b>reports...</b>|$|R

500|$|Martínez Pérez {{worked for}} several {{newspapers}} in Chiapas, like El Sol de Chiapas and Número Uno, {{for five years}} before {{she returned to her}} home state of Veracruz, where she became the editorial assistant of the news channel Cuatro Más. The journalist then left to work for the daily Política, where she covered topics on security and social justice. Martínez Pérez was also a journalist and investigative crime reporter [...] for the Diario de Xalapa newspaper. Her journalistic career in Veracruz, however, faced several challenges from the political elite; governors and government secretaries wanted to censor Martínez Pérez for criticizing their administration. Instead of self-censoring like other media outlets in the state, she became known for her <b>direct</b> <b>reporting</b> style, which frequently angered the authorities. She wrote over 63 reports covering political assassinations, natural disasters, authority abuses, human right violations, corruption, and government mismanagement.|$|E

A pilot study, testing a developed measure of ethics of virtue, sampling 188 students and collecting 557 iterations of the ethic of virtue measure and subsequent reliability and confirmatory factor analysis yielded strong support for a six factor model: courage, trustworthiness, loyalty, justice, caring and honor.
