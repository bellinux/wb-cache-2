We first deal with the problem of finding and representing the sin-gular points, together with their basic invariants, of an algebraic curve. Then we show <b>how</b> <b>to</b> efficiently <b>recognize</b> curves having only Eggers singularities. For such curves we give an algorithm to compute a nonsingular model.

It is at least a significant coincidence that in these the death penalty for murder is fairly well enforced by judges who do not derive any part of their authority from those for whose restraint and punishment they hold it.
