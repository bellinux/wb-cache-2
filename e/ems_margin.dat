40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} spatial {{focusing}} {{performance of the}} Time Reversal (TR) method in a multiple input single output (MISO) situation with experimental data. For the target user, the received signal {{is related to the}} channel link from the transmitter to the target receiver. The received power increases as we enlarge the array size, and it increases by 15. 6 dB with 16 transmit antennas, compared to the single link. For the eavesdropper, the received signal is determined by both the channel link from the transmitter to the target user and the channel link from the transmitter to the eavesdropper. In terms of unbalanced branch power, the minimum average Eavesdropping <b>Margin</b> (<b>EM)</b> and Peak Eavesdropping Margin (EMPeak) are 14 dB and 13 dB from 16 transmit elements.

40|$|This study empirically {{examines}} {{a connection}} between non-tariff measures (NTMs) and trade response at a micro level. It investigates the mechanism, drivers and speed of adjustment to a battery of {{sanitary and phytosanitary measures}} and technical barriers to trade. It uses an administrative dataset of Pakistan's mango-exporting firms at an eight-digit level of disaggregation and exploits a natural experiment in the identification strategy. The research finds the NTMs appear to have increased the volume of exports but through one specific channel and after some time lag. The intensive margins (IM) of trade have improved whereas the extensive <b>margins</b> (<b>EM)</b> have contracted. The increase in IM is, however, registered after a gap of four years and appears to be driven by larger quantities as well as higher prices. The contraction in the EM seems to operate mainly through a {{reduction in the number of}} customers in export markets...|$|R

40|$|Medical {{residency}} {{is a time}} of high stress, long hours, {{high case}} loads, fatigue, and lack of free time. Burnout rates among residents have been reported to be between 25 - 76 %. Scant literature exists in regard to resident stress and its impact on learning and attrition during residency. The theory of margin posits that a healthy margin is necessary for adults to learn. Healthy margin exists when a person’s ratio of burdens over resources creates a surplus of energy. This study sought to determine if there was a difference between emergency medicine (<b>EM)</b> residents’ <b>margin</b> in life scores and remediation, at risk for remediation, and those considering leaving their emergency medicine residency training. Volunteer EM residents (n = 279) completed the Margin in Life Scale for Emergency Medicine (MILS EM) questionnaire, which measures six life areas: Health/Body, Religion/Spirituality, Self-Confidence, Interdependence, Parenting, and EM Work. Residents self-reported if they were considering leaving EM training and program directors provided remediation, at risk for remediation, and attrition rates. The mean MILS EM score among the 273 included EM residents was. 64, which is within the recommended healthy range of. 30 to. 80. Additionally, all mean subscale scores fell within the healthy range. Only 13 % of residents were reported as being on remediation, MILS EM (M=. 63) with no statistically significant differences between those on remediation versus those not. Only 6 % of residents were reported as being in jeopardy of remediation, MILS EM (M=. 63) versus those not at risk (M=. 64). Finally, only 5 % of EM residents self-reported considering leaving EM training and no residents left their training program. Women scored lower on the MILS EM, and the life areas Health/Body (p Results {{of this study suggest that}} EM residents appear to have sufficient margin overall and in each of the life areas. Few were on or at risk for remediation and even fewer reported they were considering leaving EM residency training.

40|$|Com o objetivo de estudar os achados epidemiológicos, clínicos e hematológicos associados com ehrlichiose, e comparar técnicas citológicas para detecção de mórulas de Ehrlichia canis a partir de um método de leuconcentração (LC) e pela citologia de sangue periférico da veia jugular (SP) e de margem de orelha (MO), foram obtidas amostras de 60 cães naturalmente infectados, utilizando-se outros 35 como controle. Para validação das técnicas, adotou-se a PCR como técnica padrão-ouro. Verificou-se que a doença foi mais comum nos meses frios e secos, nos cães com idade {{inferior}} a um ano e com definição racial, que habitavam locais com presença de terra e outros cães e tinham histórico de infestação por carrapatos. Os sinais clínicos mais comuns foram apatia, anorexia, linfadenomegalia, febre e palidez de mucosas. Melena e hemorragias na pele foram os principais sinais hemorrágicos. Anemia e trombocitopenia constituíram-se nas alterações hematológicas mais freqüentes, e tiveram sua sensibilidade aumentada quando foram associadas. A leuconcentração mostrou-se a melhor técnica, especialmente para animais em fase aguda. A sensibilidade e especificidade foram, respectivamente, de 13, 33 % e 100 % em SP, 26, 67 % e 97, 14 % na PO, e de 73, 33 % e 100 % para a LC. Os valores preditivos positivo e negativo corresponderam a 100 % e 40, 23 % em SP; 94, 12 % e 43, 59 % em MO; e a 100 % e 68, 63 % na LC. Palavras-chave: achados clínico-laboratoriais; canino; diagnóstico; ehrlichiose; epidemiologia. The {{subject of}} this work was to correlate the epidemiological, clinical and hematological findings with ehrlichiosis, and to compare the citological diagnostic based on the detection of Ehrlichia canis morulae using a leukoconcentration technique (LT) with the blood smear of pheripheral vein (PV) and ear <b>margin</b> (<b>EM).</b> Sixty animals with natural infection entered {{in the study and}} others 35 were used as control. The methods were compared to the PCR gold standard. The disease was most frequent in the coldest and driest months. The prevalence was higher in purebred. The maiority were one to twelve months old, they lived in contact with earth and dogs, and the tick infestation was related by their owners. Apathy, anorexia, lymphadenopathy, fever and pale mucous membranes were the most consistent clinical signs. The most strikking hemorragic signals were melena e disturbes in the skin. Thrombocytopenia and anemia were the most common hematological findings, and their sensibilities were highest when they were used in combination. The LT presented the best results for the detection of morulae, specially in the acute phase of the disease. Sensibility and specificity were, respectivelly, of 13, 33 % and 100 % for PV; 26, 67 % and 97, 14 % for EM; and 73, 33 % and 100 % for LT. The preditive positive and negative values were 100 % and 40, 23 % for PV; 94, 12 % and 43, 59 % for EM; 100 % and 68, 63 % for LT.

40|$|New Zealand sheep fanning {{has changed}} {{dramatically}} over the past 20 years as it has adjusted to a market-led and unsubsidised economy. Despite this, new technology and management practices such as cross breeding offer exciting opportunities for improving sheep industry profitability. The introduction of new genetic material into the sheep flock can provide benefits through improved productivity and product attributes {{but it may also}} have negative consequences for industry growth if used incorrectly. The advantages of introducing a new sheep breed to a farm are usually widely published but not necessarily well researched. The East Friesian (EF) was made available to farmers in autumn 1996. It has a reputation for being highly fertile, a good milk producer and heavy-weight-lamb producer. However, no research has been published on how to develop a profitable management strategy for adopting EF's onto a hill country property. The {{purpose of this study was}} to test the hypothesis that the EF would improve the productivity and profitability of a lower North Island hill country farm. A case farm analysis using the STOCKPOL farm simulation model was used to compare the productivity and profitability of the current Romney (Rn x Rn) flock with either an East Friesian (EF) x Rn crossbred flock or a purebred EF x EF flock. The STOCKPOL model was calibrated to simulate the existing sheep and beef cattle policy for the 324 ha hill country farm, Tuapaka. Pasture growth rate data were adjusted to sustain the reordered levels of animal production and establish a basis against which the EF x Rn and EF x EF flocks could be compared. The cattle policy was fixed for all options. Ewe numbers, with a 20 % replacement rate, were adjusted for the live weight profiles and production levels of the EF x Rn (67 kg at mating; 148 lambs born: 100 ewes mated) and EF x EF (80 kg at mating; 230 lambs born: 100 ewes mated) breeds until the farm system was just biologically feasible. This indicated 1315 EF x Rn sheep or 909 EF x EF could be farmed compared to 1930 Romneys (52 kg; 117 lambs born: 100 ewes mated). In stock unit terms (SU) the EF x Rn was 1. 25 and the EF x EF 1. 54 compared to the Rn x Rn ewe (1. 00) which consumed 526 kgDM per year. The STOCKPOL outputs were copied into an enterprise <b>margin</b> (<b>EM)</b> format and the profitability of the sheep breeds calculated after adjusting for the cost of capital (CoC) of sheep wintered. The EM's (per ha) were $ 324, $ 340 and $ 351 for the Rn x Rn, EF x Rn and EF x EF breeds, respectively. The EF x EF was the preferred option for all risk preferences. A sheep age structure model was developed to simulated the transition to an EF x Rn crossbred flock. This took six years. The additional net present value (NPV) in 1998 dollars of the EF x Rn vs. the Rn x Rn was $ 92, 133. The transition to a purebred EF flock would take 24 years if a grading up strategy were adopted. An important finding was the breed x pasture production interaction. Annual pasture consumption was 869 t DM for the Rn x Rn flock, 780 t DM for the EF x Rn policy and 647 t DM for the EF x EF flock. Reduced pasture production occurred because of the higher lamb:ewe ratio of the EF sheep contributed to increased pasture senescence and decay in the summer and autumn. Ways to prevent this occurring need to be explored through further modelling studies using STOCKPOL and by evaluating the experience of famers who have adopted EF's. The study confirmed the hypothesis: EF sheep would improve production and profit on the hill country case farm. Recent farmer experience with the East Friesian should now be evaluated against this result.
