While a prisoner <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was ungenerously treated by the harsh criticisms {{of the press and}} individuals not only in regard to my want of loyalty to the southern caus(sic) but also with regard to my supposed want of courage. I therefore resolved if God would grant me deliverance I would at once enter the Federal Army.|$|E
5|$|Pokiri success {{elevated}} Mahesh to super-stardom {{and brought}} recognition to Jagannadh {{as a writer}} and director. The sequences featuring Brahmanandam as a software engineer, the comedy track of Ali and Brahmanandam, Mahesh asking D'Cruz to give him upma at the railway station were acclaimed. The fashion trend of wearing doctor sleeves increased in Andhra Pradesh after Mahesh sported them and they continue to influence fashion even today. After the film's release, many films were released subsequently that had titles bordering on cuss words including Jagannadh's next film Desamuduru (2006). Mahesh revealed that he became confused after the film's success:It was such a huge hit, that if someone came to me with a script, I would approach the result of the film before approaching the character. I only wanted to act in movies that were like Pokiri, I think that was a mistake. It all got to me and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> needed a break from films itself. Initially, I wanted just a seven-month break. I signed Khaleja after nine months, but it just kept getting delayed and the break ended up becoming a two-year-long holiday. But I didn't freak out... I relaxed {{for the first time in}} life.|$|E
500|$|Chekhov {{witnessed}} much on Sakhalin {{that shocked}} and angered him, including floggings, embezzlement of supplies, and forced prostitution of women. He wrote, [...] "There were times <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> saw before me the extreme limits of man's degradation." [...] He was particularly {{moved by the}} plight of the children living in the penal colony with their parents. For example: ...|$|E

500|$|Considering what to write, Carrier {{thought of}} his own childhood. He stated in an {{interview}} that he began thinking of [...] "when was it that I felt I was really myself? And I remember it was when I put on my skates and my Eaton catalogues on my legs, and I stood up, and I was taller than my mom, and I had a stick in my hands, so I was stronger than my brother, and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was little me. So I started to write about that and it turned into the Hockey Sweater story." ...|$|E
500|$|The puzzles, {{according}} to Broady, were of uneven quality. He called some [...] "hopelessly difficult" [...] and others extremely derivative. By contrast, he viewed the Albert Einstein and Isaac Newton dialogue puzzle as [...] "brilliant", but said, [...] "Ideas as original as Horse's call for puzzles to match, not rehashes of things we've seen {{far too many}} times already." [...] Ramsey thought the puzzles were challenging but not overly difficult, arguing [...] "on almost every occasion <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was making progress, and I never felt bogged down and hopelessly lost." [...] He felt the puzzles were mostly well-integrated, and found those that were not did not detract from his enjoyment. Ivey remarked, [...] "For puzzle lovers, Drowned God is a treasure trove. ... This collection of tricky puzzlers are challenging and frequently innovative." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1964 Terry-Thomas started {{filming the}} role of Charles Furbank in How to Murder Your Wife, a part which brought him £100,000, his largest fee up to that point. He {{said that it was}} his {{favourite}} to make, [...] "because <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> did a very good job". He enjoyed working with Jack Lemmon, the film's star, partly because Lemmon would play jazz and sing while the scenes were being lit: the two became friends and Terry-Thomas was invited to Lemmon's wedding. Throughout {{the rest of the year}} Terry-Thomas continued to appear on US television, again in Burke's Law, but also on What's My Line? and An Hour with Robert Goulet, both on CBS; he also released another record, Terry-Thomas Discovers America, a collection of songs and sketches, described by Billboard as [...] "a funny, funny comedy masterpiece". His earlier record Strictly T-T was also released in the US.|$|E

500|$|In May 1994, Jackson married Lisa Marie Presley, the {{daughter}} of Elvis and Priscilla Presley. They had met in 1975, when a seven-year-old Presley attended one of Jackson's family engagements at the MGM Grand Hotel and Casino, and reconnected through a mutual friend. According {{to a friend of}} Presley's, [...] "their adult friendship began in November 1992 in L.A." [...] They stayed in contact every day over the telephone. As the child molestation accusations became public, Jackson became dependent on Presley for emotional support; she was concerned about his faltering health and addiction to drugs. Presley said: [...] "I believed he didn't do anything wrong and that he was wrongly accused and yes I started falling for him. I wanted to save him. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could do it." [...] She eventually persuaded him to settle the civil case out of court and go into rehabilitation to recover.|$|E
500|$|Following her accession, John Owen Dominis {{was given}} the title Prince Consort and {{restored}} to the Governorship of Oʻahu, which had been abolished following the Bayonet Constitution of 1887. Dominis' death on August 27, seven months into her reign, greatly affected the new Queen. Liliʻuokalani later wrote: [...] "His death occurred {{at a time when}} his long experience in public life, his amiable qualities, and his universal popularity, would have made him an adviser to me for whom no substitute could possibly be found. I have often said that it pleased the Almighty Ruler of nations to take him away from me at precisely the time when <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> most needed his counsel and companionship." [...] Cleghorn, her sister's widower, was appointed to succeed Dominis as Governor of Oʻahu. In 1892, Liliʻuokalani would also restore the positions of governor for the other three main islands for her friends and supporters.|$|E
500|$|The least {{expensive}} route for Kanae to Japan was through Russia. [...] He set off from Paris on 30 June 1916 via England, Norway, and Sweden. [...] In Moscow {{he met the}} Japanese consul and the social critic Noburu Katagami; the latter introduced him to proletarian art and encouraged him to visit Yasnaya Polyana, Leo Tolstoy's home which he had made into a farmers' school. [...] The experienced moved Kanae, who later was to write, [...] "While I was staying in Moscow {{in the summer of}} 1916, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had two important missions. [...] One was promotion of children's free painting and the other was establishment of farmers' art." [...] Kanae visited the Moscow Kustar' Museum, which had exhibited peasant arts and crafts since 1885. [...] He praised its sturdy quality and ethnic design, and lamented that industrialization had brought about a degradation in its perceived value and was threatening its survival. [...] An exhibition of children's art impressed Kanae with its free expressiveness.|$|E

500|$|Some modern authors {{suggest that}} Druitt was {{dismissed}} {{because he was}} a homosexual or pederast and that may have driven him to suicide. One speculation is that the money found on his body was going to be used for payment to a blackmailer. Others, however, think that {{there is no evidence of}} homosexuality and that his suicide was instead precipitated by an hereditary psychiatric illness. His mother suffered from depression and was institutionalised from July 1888. She died in an asylum in Chiswick in 1890. His maternal grandmother committed suicide while insane, his aunt attempted suicide., and his eldest sister committed suicide in old age. A note written by Druitt and addressed to his brother William, who was a solicitor in Bournemouth, was found in Druitt's room in Blackheath. It read, [...] "Since Friday <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was going to be like mother, and the best thing for me was to die." ...|$|E
500|$|Jackson {{first met}} Lisa Marie Presley (and Elvis Presley) in 1974, during a Jackson 5 {{engagement}} at the MGM Grand. In November 1992, Jackson was reconnected with Presley through a mutual friend, staying in contact {{almost every day}} by telephone. As the child sexual abuse accusations became public, he became dependent on Presley for emotional support; she was concerned about his faltering health and his addiction to drugs. She explained, [...] "I believed he didn't do anything wrong {{and that he was}} wrongly accused and yes I started falling for him. I wanted to save him. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could do it." [...] In one phone call he made to her, she described him as high, incoherent and delusional. He proposed to her over the phone towards the fall of 1993, saying, [...] "If I asked you to marry me, would you do it?". The marriage was, in her words, [...] "a married couple's life ... that was sexually active". They divorced fewer than two years later, remaining friendly.|$|E
500|$|On 20 November, Chamakh {{scored a}} goal in a 3–2 defeat by Tottenham Hotspur in the North London derby. A week later, he {{converted}} another goal, {{this time in}} a 4–2 win over Aston Villa. Following the goal against Villa, Chamakh went scoreless in the winter months, often appearing as a substitute in {{a majority of the}} matches. In matches he did start, he was often substituted on early in the second half. On 15 February 2011, he admitted that he felt burnt-out, stating, [...] "By the start of January <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had completely lost my edge." [...] The striker also admitted he needed some rest and wouldn't return to full form until March. On 20 February, Chamakh played the entire match in Arsenal's 1–1 draw with Leyton Orient in the FA Cup. It {{was the first time in}} nearly two months he had played the full 90 minutes in a match. On 2 March, in the replay against Leyton Orient, Chamakh scored his first goal since November in a 5–0 win.|$|E
60|$|Her {{words were}} so {{unexpected}} {{that for a}} moment or two I was speechless. On the whole, <b>I</b> scarcely <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> deserved the cold contempt of her voice or the angry flash in her eyes.|$|R
60|$|Yet {{upon that}} afternoon, {{whether it was}} the Beaune which I had taken with my lunch, or the {{additional}} exasperation produced by the extreme deliberation of his manner, <b>I</b> suddenly <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could hold out no longer.|$|R

500|$|On June 6, 1990, {{recording}} for Off the Deep End officially {{began at}} Santa Monica Sound Records, in Santa Monica, California. The first recording session started with [...] "Airline Amy". These recording sessions {{marked the first}} time Yankovic self-produced his songs, after six albums with Rick Derringer. [...] The producer and musician had parted ways because Derringer found that Yankovic would not listen to his input, and Yankovic came to realize that he could do most of the production work himself. Subsequent studio albums would be produced by Yankovic. In regards to this split, Yankovic said: [...] "We [...] had a great run with Rick, he’s a terrific guybut I had become more and more of a control freak over the years, and I’d finally gotten to the point in my recording career where <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could capably hold the reins all by myself." [...] By late 1990 five originals—"Airline Amy," [...] "Trigger Happy", [...] "When I Was Your Age", [...] "You Don't Love Me Anymore," [...] and [...] "Waffle King"—were recorded.|$|E
500|$|In 1891, {{after many}} failed {{attempts}} at reconciliation by the pair, Tom Chappell, the music publisher responsible for printing the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, {{stepped in to}} mediate between two of his most profitable artists, and within two weeks had succeeded. [...] Two more operas resulted: Utopia, Limited (1893) and The Grand Duke (1896). Gilbert also offered a third libretto to Sullivan (His Excellency, 1894), but Gilbert's insistence on casting Nancy McIntosh, his protegée from Utopia, led to Sullivan's refusal. Utopia, concerning an attempt to [...] "anglicise" [...] a south Pacific island kingdom, was only a modest success, and The Grand Duke, in which a theatrical troupe, {{by means of a}} [...] "statutory duel" [...] and a conspiracy, takes political control of a grand duchy, was an outright failure. After that, the partnership ended for good. Sullivan continued to compose comic opera with other librettists but died four years later. In 1904, Gilbert would write, [...] "...Savoy opera was snuffed out by the deplorable death of my distinguished collaborator, Sir Arthur Sullivan. When that event occurred, I saw no one with whom <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could work with satisfaction and success, and so I discontinued to write libretti." ...|$|E
500|$|Williamson {{provided}} {{the covers and}} additional artwork for Dark Horse Comics' 20-issue Classic Star Wars (Aug. 1992 – June 1994), which reprinted his Star Wars daily strips. He later inked the [...] and A New Hope film adaptations for the company. [...] Through 2003, he was active as inker on several Marvel Comics titles, including Daredevil (#248–300), Spider-Man 2099 (#1–25), and Spider-Girl (#1–61), and such non-superhero projects as the four-issue Marvel / Epic Comics miniseries Atomic Age (Nov. 1990 – Feb. 1991), by writer Frank Lovece and penciler Mike Okamoto, for which Williamson won a 1991 Eisner Award for Best Inker. Daredevil penciler John Romita Jr. recalled that, [...] "Working with Al Williamson was much like working with my father [...] in that <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was protected from mistakes. ... If my art wasn’t correct, then Al would repair it. Oddly enough, Al said he never had to fix anything, claiming he just 'traced' over my pencils." [...] In a 1988 interview Williamson indeed stated that [...] "I'm just tracing [...] pencils" [...] and claimed that the only changes he made were occasionally leaving out an unnecessary background {{if he was in}} a rush.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode is}} one of the few in the series that has no paranormal {{elements}} to it. Carter said of the episode's conception, [...] "My first chance to work with David Nutter in a long time, and I wanted to give him something he could sink his teeth into. It's a little bit different for us. It doesn't really have a paranormal aspect, except for Scully's perceptions of her deepest fears. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had to figure out what she is most afraid of, and she is most afraid of those things that most of us are afraid of. [...] The idea of dying at the hands of someone—creature or not—and she is helpless to do anything about it. I thought it was a very good way to explore Scully's character." [...] The scene where Dana Scully imagines Pfaster appearing as a devil was influenced by real-life accounts, as described by Carter: [...] "There are reports of people who had been under the spell of Jeffrey Dahmer, who actually claimed that he shape-shifted during those hours when they were held hostage; that his image actually changed." [...] Nutter said [...] "In many ways, Chris wanted to sell the idea that, as established in Mulder's closing dialogue in the show, not all terror comes from the paranormal. It could come from the person next door." ...|$|E
2500|$|Miller {{later said}} of his peak period in the mid-1970s: [...] "When I won at Tucson by nine shots in 1975, I would say the average iron shot I hit that week {{was no more than}} two feet off line. It was unbelievable. When I was at my peak, I would go into streaks where <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could knock down the pin from {{anywhere}} with my irons. I played some golf that I think is unequaled." ...|$|E
2500|$|Vittorini's {{death in}} 1966 greatly {{affected}} Calvino. [...] He went through {{what he called}} an [...] "intellectual depression", which the writer himself described as an important passage in his life: [...] "...I ceased to be young. Perhaps it's a metabolic process, something that comes with age, I'd been young for a long time, perhaps too long, suddenly <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had to begin my old age, yes, old age, perhaps {{with the hope of}} prolonging it by beginning it early." ...|$|E
60|$|Presently he turned, and perceiving <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{was sitting}} up {{advanced}} to me, and with the utmost courtesy said <b>that</b> he trusted <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> better. <b>I</b> answered <b>that</b> at present <b>I</b> scarcely knew how <b>I</b> <b>felt,</b> except <b>that</b> <b>I</b> ached all over.|$|R
