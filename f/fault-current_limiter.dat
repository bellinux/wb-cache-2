A prototype <b>fault-current</b> <b>limiter,</b> a 200 -hp motor, and a 50 -m-long transmission cable have already been demonstrated using Ag-clad Bi- 2223 superconductor tapes. We have recently enhanced the transport current properties of long lengths of multifilament Ag-clad Bi- 2223 tapes through increased packing density of precursor powder, improved mechanical deformation, optimization of conductor design, and adjusted cooling rate. These improved processing parameters had a pronounced effect on the transport critical current of the super-conducting tapes. Our improvements are briefly discussed and their implications are assessed in this paper...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{discovery}} of high-temperature superconductivity, it has been studied for the applications and the developments in various fields. The superconducting <b>fault-current</b> <b>limiter</b> (FCL) {{is one of the}} superconducting applications, witch reduces the current to the level that the circuit breaker can easily work. The temperature becomes high caused by a Joule heat when fault electric current is restrained. We need high cooling efficiency to restore the accidental status to the normal one immediately. We took note of cavities in the bulk and measured magnetic levitation effect as the basics. I fabricated the bulks that have many cavities by varying the sintering temperature and the pressure. As the result, I understood that cooling effect was increased and levitation time improved by lowering the cavity density...|$|E
40|$|A {{resistive}} superconducting <b>fault-current</b> <b>limiter</b> (SFCL) {{has been}} developed using round magnesium diboride (MgB 2) wire. The SFCL coil was wound using an interleaved coil arrangement to minimize the total coil inductance. The SFCL coil demonstrated reliable and repeatable current-limiting properties during testing. However, the wire temperature of the SFCL coil increases quickly during quench tests, and several minutes are required for temperature recovery after the fault is cleared. The SFCL coil therefore was fully integrated with a vacuum interrupter to quickly remove the SFCL coil from the circuit once a fault occurred. This allowed the SFCL coil to recover quickly while a bypass resistor acted as the current limiting resistance. A fast-acting actuator and its control circuit were designed and built to provide automatic control for {{the operation of the}} vacuum interrupter. The SFCL with the prototype vacuum interrupter was successfully tested. The energy dissipated in the SFCL coil was significantly reduced by integrating the vacuum interrupter. The fault tests with different potential fault currents also proved that the operation of the vacuum interrupter is independent of the fault current level. This prototype demonstrated the potential of a cost-effective and compact integrated SFCL and vacuum interrupter for power system applications...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT- Superconducting <b>fault-current</b> <b>limiters</b> (SFCLs) {{have been}} the subject of {{research}} and development for many years and offer an attractive solution to the problem of rising fault levels in electrical distribution systems. SFCLs can greatly reduce fault currents and the damage at the point of fault, and help improve the stability of a power system. The resistance of an SFCL should be chosen to limit fault currents as much as possible. Not only does this benefit an electrical system through reduction in the potentially damaging effects of high fault currents, which is the primary purpose of the SFCL, but increasing the limitation of fault currents also has a consequence of shortening the recovery time of the SFCL by reducing the energy dissipated in the resistance of the SFCL. Superconducting <b>fault-current</b> <b>limiters</b> (SFCL) provide a new efficient approach to the reliable handling of such faults. (SCFLs) can be used for various nominal voltages and currents, and can be adapted to particular limiting characteristics in case of short circuits. Electrical equipment that controls high fault currents can increase the security of the network and allow power equipment to be designed more cost effectively. SFCL allows electrical interconnections of existing systems, which would not be possible without limiters. Finally, the SFCL is introduced in the higher capacity system. Thus, it is revealed that the outstanding current limiting performance of SFCL can be used to limit the fault to the level of the existing switchgear...|$|R

40|$|Fault {{levels in}} {{electrical}} distribution systems are rising {{due to the}} increasing presence of distributed generation, and this rising trend {{is expected to continue}} in the future. Superconducting <b>fault-current</b> <b>limiters</b> (SFCLs) are a promising solution to this problem. This paper describes the factors that govern the selection of optimal SFCL resistance. The total energy dissipated in an SFCL during a fault is particularly important for estimating the recovery time of the SFCL; the recovery time affects the design, planning, and operation of electrical systems using SFCLs to manage fault levels. Generic equations for energy dissipation are established in terms of fault duration, SFCL resistance, source impedance, source voltage, and fault inception angles. Furthermore, using an analysis that is independent of superconductor material, it is shown that the minimum required volume of superconductors linearly varies with SFCL resistance but, for a given level of fault-current limitation and power rating, is independent of system voltage and superconductor resistivity. Hence, there is a compromise between a shorter recovery time, which is desirable, and the cost of the volume of superconducting material needed for the resistance required to achieve the shorter recovery time...|$|R
40|$|Superconducting <b>fault-current</b> <b>limiters</b> (SFCLs) offer several {{benefits}} for electrical distribution systems, especially with increasing distributed generation and {{the requirements for}} better network reliability and efficiency. This paper examines {{the use of multiple}} SFCLs in a protection scheme to locate faulted circuits, using an approach which is radically different from typical proposed applications of fault current limitation, and also which does not require communications. The technique, referred to as “current division discrimination” (CDD), is based upon the intrinsic inverse current-time characteristics of resistive SFCLs, which ensures that only the SFCLs closest to a fault operate. CDD is especially suited to meshed networks and particularly when the network topology may change over time. Meshed networks are expensive and complex to protect using conventional methods. Simulation results with multiple SFCLs, using a thermal-electric superconductor model, confirm that CDD operates as expected. Nevertheless, CDD has limitations, which are examined in this paper. The SFCLs must be appropriately rated for the maximum system fault level, although some variation in actual fault level can be tolerated. For correct coordination between SFCLs, each bus must have at least three circuits that can supply fault current, and the SFCLs should have identical current-time characteristics...|$|R
40|$|Increase in {{the demand}} and {{consumption}} of electrical energy has led to increase in the system fault levels. Superconducting <b>Fault-current</b> <b>limiters</b> (SFCL) offer ideal performance in electrical power system. Superconducting Fault Current Limiters (SFCLs) are used in power system network to mitigate the overcurrent and its prominent effects. Nowadays, Coated Conductors (CCs) are widely used for novel design of SFCL for such applications. The thermal and electrical behaviors of different configurations of SFCL {{in the presence of}} over-critical current are studied in detail to master its performance in a power grid. An algorithm to solve the differential equations characterizing the superconductingmaterial is developed using the Runge-Kutta method. In this report, comparative study on the operational characteristics of Resistive-SFCL based on BSSCO and YBCO Coated Conductors under fault condition is analyzed for an 110 KV/ 9 KA power system. Also Electro-thermal Model of Coated Conductor is implemented in MATLAB software. The developed models accurately predicted the current-time waveforms achievable with the limiters for an improved current limiting behavior during fault condition and even the restraining the conditions upsetting the thermal stability of the SFCLs. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed Resistive-SFCL, several case studies of Coated Conductors have been carried out in MATLAB. The results show the choice of optimal configuration of CCs as SFCL which effectively improves the thermal stability and current limiting characteristics under fault condition in the network...|$|R
40|$|For {{describing}} the E-J relation of high-Tc superconductors (HTS) in power applications, where the applied current I is generally limited by Ic, the critical state model, a piecewise linear generalization, or a simple power-law {{of the type}} E=Ec(J/Jc) ^n are most often used. The power-law cannot be used for modelling the E-J relation with I>>I_c due to the unbound exponential increase of the electric field for currents above Ic, while in reality the non-linear HTS resistivity is limited by its normal state value. This paper presents a modified E-J model for {{describing the}} V-I characteristic of HTS tapes with applied currents largely exceeding Ic. This model {{is based on the}} power-law in combination with a parallel metallic branch and has a limited resistivity - the HTS one in the normal state. It can be used for black-box modelling of superconductors in a unlimited current range, as well as for numerical modelling of superconducting devices, which can be operated at currents far exceeding Ic; for example <b>fault-current</b> <b>limiters</b> or cables with over-critical current excursions. The model has been tested in a simple numerical implementation and the modified power-law has been implemented in finite element method simulations. It is shown that for bulk material with currents above 1. 3 - 2 Ic$ (depending on the n-value), the usual power-law results in excessive AC loss estimation...|$|R

The electrical distribution system is cryogenic {{in order to}} maximize its efficiency and increase the power density of all associated components, while the motors, generators, and transmission lines are superconducting. The protection of a superconducting DC network poses unique electrical and thermal challenges due to the low impedance of the superconductor and operation in the superconducting or quenched states. For a given TeDP electrical system architecture with fixed power ratings, conventional and solid-state circuit breakers combined with superconducting <b>fault-current</b> <b>limiters</b> are examined with both voltage and current source control to limit and interrupt the fault current. To estimate the protection system weight and losses, scalable models of cryogenic bidirectional current-source converters, cryogenic bidirectional IGBT solid-state circuit breakers, and resistive-type superconducting fault current limiters are developed to assess how the weight and losses of these components vary as a function of nominal voltage and current and fault current ratings. The scalable models are used to assess the protection system weight for several trade-offs. System studies include the trade-off in fault-current limiting capability of SFCL on CB mass, alongside the fault-current limiting capability of the converter and its impact on CB fault-current interruption ratings and weight...|$|R
