5|$|A funk {{and dance}} album, Rhythm Killers has a dense sound that {{incorporates}} contrasting musical elements and disparate styles, including reggae, hip hop, hard rock, worldbeat, and downtown music. Arranged in two side-long <b>gapless</b> suites, the album's songs {{are characterized by}} electronic grooves, striking beats, improvisational rhythms, string synthesizers, and cross-rhythms produced by turntable scratches, African and Latin-influenced percussion, and percussive raps. The album has been noted by music writers for its electronic rhythms, treatment of African-American music elements, and Laswell's densely layered production.|$|E
25|$|Boxee {{features}} are on-the-fly audio frequency resampling, <b>gapless</b> playback, crossfading, ReplayGain, cue sheet and Ogg Chapter support.|$|E
25|$|The Sansa Clip+ proved {{popular with}} audio enthusiasts and programmers {{because of its}} very low cost, {{excellent}} DAC, and relatively mature Rockbox port. Rockbox substantially improves battery life and adds features such as parametric EQ, completely <b>gapless</b> playback and AAC audio playback.|$|E
25|$|A <b>gapless</b> album soundtrack for Loose Change: 2nd Edition was {{released}} in December 2006 by now-defunct company Third i Records and features hip-hop music by various artists. The Beats of Loose Change featured music by DJ Skooly, who was Dylan Avery's roommate Dustin Marshall along with Marshall's friends' work: Josue Guadalupe (Swae Da Ricanstrukta) and Nick Hernandez (Nick Tha 1da). The Beats of Loose Change also included vocals from the film.|$|E
25|$|FAAC or Freeware Advanced Audio Coder is a {{software}} project {{which includes the}} AAC encoder FAAC and decoder FAAD2. It supports MPEG-2 AAC as well as MPEG-4 AAC. It supports several MPEG-4 Audio object types (LC, Main, LTP for encoding and SBR, PS, ER, LD for decoding), file formats (ADTS AAC, raw AAC, MP4), multichannel and <b>gapless</b> encoding/decoding and MP4 metadata tags. The encoder and decoder is compatible with standard-compliant audio applications using {{one or more of}} these object types and facilities. It also supports Digital Radio Mondiale.|$|E
500|$|The iPad {{supports}} <b>gapless</b> playback. Like the fifth-generation iPods {{introduced in}} 2005, the iPad can play digital video, allowing users to watch TV shows and movies in widescreen. Double-tapping switches between widescreen and [...] video playback.|$|E
500|$|The album's {{songs are}} {{arranged}} into a <b>gapless</b> suite on each side, {{both of which}} begin with covers of early 1970s R songs. Stereo Review writes that each side is stylistically [...] "derived" [...] from its respective opening track and distinguishes the two side-opening tracks as [...] "anchoring songs [...] serve as starting points for uninterrupted improvisations in rhythm that build to multiple climaxes while drawing from wildly disparate musical styles." [...] "Fire", a cover of the Ohio Players' 1974 song of the same name, was reworked as an extended vamp with an uncredited sample of Liquid Liquid's 1983 song [...] "Cavern", and lyrics proclaiming [...] "bass" [...] to be [...] "the final frontier". It features vocals by Shinehead, whose rap begins with a Howard Cosell impersonation, and Bootsy Collins, who advises listeners that [...] "you have one desire and that's to dance until you drop." [...] "Boop" [...] is a Jamaican Patois slang term {{for a man who}} spends money for the benefit of a younger woman. Both [...] "Fire" [...] and [...] "Boops (Here to Go)" [...] touch on popular dancehall topics.|$|E
2500|$|Features of RealPlayer {{include a}} video {{download}} utility, a web browser, [...] "visualizations" [...] (graphical animations or [...] "light shows" [...] that {{appear on the}} screen when playing music), equalizer and video controls (including Crossfade and <b>Gapless</b> playback in RealPlayer Plus), recording audio, CD ripping, and a media converter which allows converting files {{to a variety of}} common audio and video formats.|$|E
2500|$|The Favorit has a {{high wing}} with a 6-series NACA laminar flow airfoil, {{straight}} tapered in plan. [...] This was built in two pieces around a single spar at 40% chord with pine and honeycomb supported plywood skin, linked by a central section integral with the fuselage. There are Schempp-Hirth airbrakes mounted further aft than usual, at 70% chord. The ailerons are <b>gapless</b> and split into pairs on either side.|$|E
2500|$|On September 25, 2006, Apple updated the Nano line. The second-generation Nano {{featured}} scratch-resistant, anodized aluminum casing {{like the}} earlier Mini's design; the multiple color choices mirrored {{those of the}} Mini as well. However, unlike the second-generation Mini, the button labels were grey instead of matching the Nano's casing (except for the black Nano, which had a black click wheel). The second-generation Nano featured a 40% brighter, [...] "more vibrant" [...] display, a battery life upgrade (from 14 to 24 hours), and storage sizes doubled to 2, 4, and 8 GB models. The second generation also introduced <b>gapless</b> playback of audio files, along with a new search option.|$|E
2500|$|Decoding, on {{the other}} hand, is {{carefully}} defined in the standard. Most decoders are [...] "bitstream compliant", {{which means that the}} decompressed output that they produce from a given MP3 file will be the same, within a specified degree of rounding tolerance, as the output specified mathematically in the ISO/IEC high standard document (ISO/IEC 11172-3). Therefore, comparison of decoders is usually based on how computationally efficient they are (i.e., how much memory or CPU time they use in the decoding process). Over time this concern has become less of an issue as CPU speeds transitioned from MHz to GHz. Encoder/decoder overall delay is not defined, which means there is no official provision for <b>gapless</b> playback. However, some encoders such as LAME can attach additional metadata that will allow players that can handle it to deliver seamless playback.|$|E
2500|$|Playback formats: Winamp {{supports}} music playback using MP3, MIDI, MOD, MPEG-1 audio layers 1 and 2, AAC, M4A, FLAC, WAV, and WMA. Winamp {{was one of}} {{the first}} widely used music players on Windows to support playback of Ogg Vorbis by default. It supports <b>gapless</b> playback for MP3 and AAC and ReplayGain for volume leveling across tracks. CD support includes playing and importing music from audio CDs, optionally with CD-Text, and burning music to CDs. The standard version limits maximum burn speed and datarate; the [...] "Pro" [...] version removes these limitations. [...] Winamp supports playback of Windows Media Video and Nullsoft Streaming Video. For MPEG Video, AVI, and other unsupported video types, Winamp uses Microsoft's DirectShow API for playback, allowing playback of most of the video formats supported by Windows Media Player. 5.1 Surround sound is supported where formats and decoders allow.|$|E
2500|$|On August 31, 2009, SanDisk {{released}} a redesign of the Sansa Clip called the Sansa Clip+, cosmetically {{similar to the}} Clip and maintaining its basic design, audio hardware, compatibility, and 4-line OLED screen, but with a few significant differences. There are 2GB (black), 4GB (black, red, blue, white or indigo) and 8GB (black) models. The case has been redesigned to look more square (including the navigation pad, which is also no longer backlit) and is constructed of higher-quality plastic, the clip is no longer removable, and the player now supports folder browsing and ReplayGain support. Transition times between tracks was reduced, but Sandisk officially declined to support <b>gapless</b> playback. A microSDHC card slot has been added, allowing the storage capacity of the device to be expanded by up to an additional 32GB. The Clip+ also has added features when playing slotMusic and slotRadio. To {{make room for the}} microSDHC slot there have been some changes from the old Clip, including moving the volume switch to {{the left side of the}} device and changing the power/hold switch to a simple power button. Hold mode is now activated by holding the [...] "Home" [...] button on the device. Like previous Clip and Fuze products, the Clip+ retained a directly coupled headphone amplifier, allowing for highly accurate reproduction of bass frequencies and very low distortion on difficult to drive headphones.|$|E
2500|$|Originally a Mac OS 9-only application, iTunes {{began to}} support Mac OS X when version 2.0 was {{released}} nine months later, which also added {{support for the}} original iPod. Version 3 dropped Mac OS 9 support but added smart playlists and a ratings system. In April 2003, version 4.0 introduced the iTunes Store (then the iTunes Music Store); in October, version 4.1 added support for Windows 2000 and Windows XP. Introduced at Macworld 2005 with the new iPod Shuffle, Version 4.7.1 introduced the ability to automatically convert higher-bitrate songs to 128kbit/s AAC as these devices did not natively support audio encoded in AIFF or Apple Lossless formats, also improving the value proposition of the Shuffle's limited flash-only storage. Version 7.0 introduced <b>gapless</b> playback and Cover Flow in September 2006. In March 2007, iTunes 7.1 added support for Windows Vista, and 7.3.2 was the last Windows 2000 version. iTunes lacked support for 64-bit versions of Windows until the 7.6 update on January 16, 2008. iTunes is supported under any 64-bit version of Windows Vista, although the iTunes executable is still 32-bit. The 64-bit versions of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 are not supported by Apple, but a workaround has been devised for both operating systems. Version 8.0 added Genius playlists, grid view, and a new default visualizer. iTunes 9 added [...] "Homeshare", enabling automatic updating of purchased items across other computers on the same subnet and offers a new iTunes Store [...] Genius Mixes were added, as well as improved app synchronization abilities, extending the iPod Shuffle 128 kbit/s down-convert feature to all of Apple's AAC-capable devices. It also adds iTunes LPs to the store, which provides additional media with an album. Apple added iTunes Extras as well to the store, which adds content usually reserved for films on DVD and Blu-ray discs. Both iTunes LPs and Extras use web-standards HTML, JavaScript and CSS.|$|E
50|$|While <b>gapless</b> {{playback}} {{was relatively}} simple to achieve on traditional media formats, an early issue with computer-based formats such as MP3 {{was the lack}} of support for <b>gapless</b> playback, causing <b>gapless</b> albums to have short pauses in between each track. Beginning with the iTunes release of Madonna's Confessions on a Dance Floor, Apple attempted to fix this for their music players by releasing a version of the album where some tracks were merged into a single track to create the effect of <b>gapless</b> playback. Apple adopted <b>gapless</b> playback and <b>gapless</b> album support wholesale with the release of iTunes 7.0 in late 2006, the latter to work with its cross-fade feature. In 2007, Microsoft added <b>gapless</b> album support to its Zune client software.|$|E

50|$|SPT {{states are}} {{short-range}} entangled while topologically ordered states are long-range entangled.Both intrinsic topological order, and also SPT order, can sometimes have protected <b>gapless</b> boundary excitations. The difference is subtle: the <b>gapless</b> boundary excitations in intrinsic topological order can be robust against any local perturbations, while the <b>gapless</b> boundary excitations in SPT order are robust only against local perturbations {{that do not}} break the symmetry. So the <b>gapless</b> boundary excitations in intrinsic topological order are topologically protected, while the <b>gapless</b> boundary excitations in SPT order are symmetry protected.|$|E
50|$|Many older audio {{players on}} {{personal}} computers do not implement the required buffering to play <b>gapless</b> audio. Some of these rely on third-party <b>gapless</b> audio plug-ins to buffer output. Most recent players and newer versions of old players now support <b>gapless</b> playback directly.|$|E
