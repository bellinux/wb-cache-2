Unlike bank lending from Europe or Japan, U. <b>S.</b> <b>bank</b> lending to emerging economies exhibited increasing volatility over time. Using U. <b>S.</b> cross-border <b>bank</b> exposure data, this study identifies a temporal association between important deregulation initiatives and the volatility of U. <b>S.</b> <b>bank</b> emerging market lending. This association is explained by the linkages between an important outcome of bank deregulation－earnings volatility from diversified bank activities－and the rising volatility.

40|$|We {{investigate}} how the lending activities of a multinational <b>bank</b> <b>s</b> affiliates located abroad {{are affected by}} funding difficulties {{in view of the}} financial crisis. For this, we consider transaction-induced changes in long-term lending to the private sector of 40 countries by the affiliates of the 68 largest German banks. We find that affiliates local deposits and profitability have been stabilizing loan supply. By contrast, relying on short-term wholesale funding has increasingly proven to be a disadvantage in the crisis, as inter-bank and capital markets froze. Besides, the more an affiliate abroad takes recourse to intra-bank funding in the crisis, the more it becomes dependent on a stable deposit and long-term wholesale funding position of its parent bank. We furthermore detect competition for intra-bank funding across the affiliates abroad as well as an increasing focus on the parent <b>bank</b> <b>s</b> home market <b>activities...</b>|$|R
40|$|Despite {{there being}} {{a vast array of}} {{literature}} available on operational risk management, literature on industry collaboration and communication to support the implementation and embedment of operational risk management practices is negligible. The <b>banking</b> industry <b>s</b> <b>activities</b> and risk profiles are becoming more diverse and complex due to deregulation and globalisation and banks therefore need to manage the change by continually evaluating their operational risk management practices to ensure that it remains relevant and aligned to evolving practices. This can be achieved through industry collaboration. Purpose The purpose of this research is to determine whether collaboration and communication within the South African banking industry can support the implementation and embedment of evolving operational risk management practices which include the Sound Practices principles. Method Exploratory research using quantitative techniques, a questionnaire, to collect data from a sample consisting of sixteen banks and analsyed using computer-aided quantitative data analysis software (CAQDAS); IBM SPSS Statistics version 23. The sample size was small and not sufficient to perform any statistical analysis but instead SPSS s descriptive statistics tool was used to determine frequency. Finding The literature reviewed and the quantitative study findings provided adequate evidence and answers to the four research questions confirming that collaboration can support the implementation and embedment of evolving operational risk management practices.

40|$|The author {{constructs}} {{a measure}} of foreign activity {{that takes into account}} the composition of foreign demand for Canadian exports. It has a number of interesting features. First, the foreign activity measure captures both the composition of demand in the United States (by including components of U.

Second, its coefficients have been estimated over the sample period 1981 - 2009 controlling for the effect of changes in relative prices. Third, compared with the <b>Bank's</b> previous U. <b>S.</b> <b>activity</b> index (introduced in the July 2009 Monetary Policy Report), the foreign activity measure provides some improvements for forecasting Canadian exports, especially at longer horizons. For instance, at eight quarters ahead, the gain in terms of forecast accuracy is as much as 22 per cent. Finally, the foreign activity measure helps to explain why Canadian exports dropped by 20 per cent during the global recession of 2008 - 09 and have only partially recovered since that time...|$|R

40|$|Using U. <b>S.</b> {{cross-border}} <b>bank</b> exposure data, {{this study}} establishes {{a line of}} arguments and findings, which together constitute the following observation: "Deregulation of U. <b>S.</b> <b>banks,</b> via consolidation and a volatile earnings stream, increased volatility in bank lending to emerging economies, and, in due course, worsened the financial crises in emerging economies. " The volatility of U. <b>S.</b> <b>bank</b> lending to emerging economies has increased during the past twenty years. To explain the across-the-board, increasing volatility of U. <b>S.</b> <b>bank</b> emerging market claims, this study turns to the supply side of the equation: the deregulation in the U. <b>S.</b> <b>banking</b> sector that imparted this commonality to their banks' investment patterns to emerging economies. In so doing, it unveils the linkages through which U. <b>S.</b> <b>banking</b> deregulation ratcheted up the volatility of U. <b>S.</b> <b>bank</b> lending into emerging economies. It starts with the detection of a particular feature of U. <b>S.</b> <b>bank</b> emerging market lending that warrants further attention [...] increasing volatility over time. Unlike bank lending from Europe or Japan, U. <b>S.</b> <b>bank</b> lending exhibited the unique feature of increasing volatility over time, regardless of its destination. By looking into domestic push factors that could have contributed to this characteristic, this study identified a temporal association between important deregulation initiatives in the U. <b>S.</b> <b>banking</b> industry and the volatility of emerging market lending by U. <b>S.</b> <b>banks</b> during the same period. This association was then explained by the linkages between the major outcomes of deregulation [...] consolidation of the banking industry and diversification of banking activities [...] and the increased volatility of lending into emerging economies. Together, it argues that the U. <b>S.</b> <b>banking</b> deregulation had the unintended and unanticipated side effect of increasing the volatility of U. <b>S.</b> <b>bank</b> lending into emerging economies...|$|R

Within this general equilibrium model, it will be shown that central bank interventions may promote an inefficient international allocation of real capital.
