The {{function}} real-time of {{substation automation}} system based on IEC 61850 depends on the distribution mode of logical nodes, the processing speed of logical nodes and the communication delay between logical nodes. The realization principles of functions ’ free distribution are introduced based on IEC 61850, take bus protection function and distributed <b>interlock</b> <b>function</b> examples, the functions are deposed into the connection diagram of logical nodes and their communication events are introduced in great detail. The simulation models of D 2 substation which has unified network or two-tier network are established with OPNET. The communication events of bus bar protection function and distributed <b>interlock</b> <b>function</b> are simulated and analyzed based on this mode. The rationality of distribution mode of system’s functions is quantitative analyzed which provide guidance to improve the real-time performance of system’s functions and network structure...|$|E
40|$|When {{islanding}} occurs, {{power supply}} {{from the main}} grid is interrupted which causes a problem when distributed generators continue to provide power into distributed networks. An islanding situation should be detected accurately soon after the island is formed. Because failure to trip the islanded distributed resource {{can lead to a}} number of problems for the resource and the connected load. Although ROCOF islanding detection method is the most commonly employed anti-islanding protection technique, it provides fast detection and easily implementation. It is sensitive to the system disturbance. Therefore, the application of the ROCOF relay to detect system islanding has been limited. This thesis proposes a solution to enhance the performance of the ROCOF relay by cooperation with rate of change of power or v 2 /p <b>interlock</b> <b>function.</b> During system load variation, the false operation of ROCOF relay can be blocked effectively. It is validated by applied in grid-connected synchronous generator, Doubly-fed Induction generator (both simulation and experiment) and microgrid. The principle of rate of change of power or v 2 /p <b>interlock</b> <b>function</b> are presented in this thesis. The new <b>interlock</b> <b>function</b> v 2 /p with ROCOF relays works well for different types of DGs within a short detection time without introducing perturbation into the system, which are the advantages over other active and hybrid islanding detection methods. The performances characteristics of ROCOF relays for DGs islanding detection (i. e. frequency measuring methods, measuring windows, generator inertia constant, relay settings and load power factor) are investigated. In addition, two other islanding detection methods (impedance measurement (active method) and the Total Harmonic Method) are applied to the grid-connected DFIG distributed system, the comparison and effectiveness of these two methods utilized in islanding and load changing conditions are also discussed.

Frequency relays {{are one of the most}} commonly used loss of mains detection method. However, distribution utilities may be faced by concern related to false operation of these frequency relays. The commercially available frequency relays reported considering standard tight setting. This paper investigates some factors related to relays internal algorithm that contribute to their different operating responses. The factors that will be investigated are frequency measuring techniques, measuring windows, time delays and under voltage <b>interlock</b> <b>function.</b> With the increasing penetration of DG into the network, it is becoming common to have multiple DG units connected at the same network location. Two generators connected at the same location and employing frequency relays with the same setting but different characteristics were simulated. When subjected to the same network disturbances the possible interference between the two relays is analyzed...|$|E

40|$|A {{research}} {{investigation has}} been undertaken {{to establish a}} generic software interlocking solution for electronic railway systems. The system {{is intended to be}} independent of the physical station layout and easily adaptable in any country of application. Railway signalling principles and regulated safety standards are incorporated into the system design. A literature review has been performed to investigate existing interlocking methods and to identify common aspects amongst these methods. Existing methods for the development of electronic interlocking systems are evaluated. The application of software engineering techniques to interlocking systems is also considered. Thereafter a model of the generic solution is provided. The solution is designed following an agile life cycle development process. The structure of the interlocking is based on an MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture which provides a modular foundation upon which the system is developed. The interlocking system is modelled using Boolean <b>interlocking</b> <b>functions</b> and UML (Unified Modelling Language) statecharts. Statecharts are used to graphically represent the procedures of interlocking operations. The Boolean <b>interlocking</b> <b>functions</b> and statechart models collectively represent a proof of concept for a generic interlocking software solution. The theoretical system models are used to simulate the interlocking software in TIA (Totally Integrated Automation) Portal. The behaviour of the interlocking during element faults and safety–critical events is validated through graphical software simulations. Test cases are derived based on software engineering test techniques to validate the behaviour and completeness of the software. The software simulations indicate that the general algorithms defined for the system model can easily be determined for a specific station layout. The model is not dependent on the physical signalling elements. The generic algorithms defined for determining the availability of the signalling element types and the standard <b>interlocking</b> <b>functions</b> are easily adaptable to a physical layout. The generic solution encompasses interlocking principles and rail safety standards which enables the interlocking to respond in a fail-safe manner during hazardous events. The incorporation of formal software engineering methods assists in guaranteeing the safety of the system as safety components are built into the system at various stages. The use of development life cycle models and design patterns supports the development of a modular and flexible system architecture. This allows new additions or amendments to easily be incorporated into the system. The application of software engineering techniques assists in developing a generic maintainable interlocking solution for railways...|$|R
30|$|Over {{the last}} few decades, {{scholars}} have discussed several motives {{for the creation of}} interlocking directorate ties resulting from directors’ memberships on more than one company’s board (for a review see Mizruchi 1996; for a more recent overview, see David and Westerhuis 2014). By now, researchers by and large agree that board interlock ties should be seen as inter-organizational “pipes” (Podolny 2001) or channels for communication (e.g., Hillman and Dalziel 2003; Mintz and Schwartz 1985) used to exert influence and transfer resources among firms.

50|$|The beamline {{elements}} {{are located in}} radiation shielding enclosures, called hutches, which are {{the size of a}} small room (cabin). A typical beamline consists of two hutches, an optical hutch for the beam conditioning elements and an experimental hutch, which houses the experiment. Between hutches, the beam travels in a transport tube. Entrance to the hutches is forbidden when the beam shutter is open and radiation can enter the hutch. This is enforced by the use of elaborate safety systems with redundant <b>interlocking</b> <b>functions,</b> which make sure that no one is inside the hutch when the radiation is turned on. The safety system will also shut down the radiation beam if the door to the hutch is accidentally opened when the beam is on. In this case, the beam is dumped, meaning the stored beam is diverted into a target designed to absorb and contain its energy.|$|R

Electron micrographs showed parallels in the organization of their intracellular vesicle transport machinery and between lens fiber cell lateral protrusions and dendritic spines. Consistent with those observations, a number of gene products first characterized as highly neuron-preferred in their expression were also demonstrated in lens fiber cells. Going further, a fundamental network of regulatory factors with critical roles in determining the neuronal phenotype were also identified in lenses, and showed a corresponding mutually exclusive distribution of neural and non-neural factor isoforms in mitotic lens epithelial cells and post-mitotic fiber cells consistent with their <b>interlocking</b> <b>functions</b> in neural cells. These included REST/NRSF transcription factors, members of major RNA binding protein families, and “brain-specific” miRNAs that were each shown to have global roles in governing neural and non-neural gene expression and alternative transcript splicing in vertebrates.

40|$|In {{corporate}} governance systems boards perform three functions: the <b>interlocking</b> <b>function</b> (from a resource-dependency and network perspective), a monitoring function (from an agency perspective), and a strategic function (from a strategic choice perspective). In a one-tier board {{the board of}} directors incorporates non-executive directors (outsiders, they sometimes represent the interests of key-stakeholders) and executive directors (top management) of the firm. In a two-tier board there is a clear distinction between the directors as members of a supervisory board and the top management team. The board serves in this respect as a supervisory board vis à vis the management board. In the Netherlands a two-tier board is prevalent. Firms who act under the structural regime have boards that are characterized by the co-option principle. This means that board members have to act {{in the best interest of}} the firm and ultimately choose each other (and are not chosen by the shareholders or other stakeholders). Co-option has some advantages, but also some clear drawbacks, such as the potentiality of groupthink.

40|$|Railway {{interlocking}} {{is designed}} to prevent trains from colliding. Generally speaking current systems are safe due to the processes that signalling systems have to follow as well as implementation procedures that interlockings are compliant with. Even the processes and procedures are very advanced; there are still train crashes that are triggered by interlocking faults. However, the interlocking faults are mainly related to poor maintenance of the systems or/and changes to the original designs without correct authorisation. While those areas are worth exploring to search some improvements {{it is also important}} that interlocking will progress its development toward intelligent transport system reinforcing maintenance functions. Rail signalling systems went toward eliminating human factor by introducing machine based decision making on whether to proceed or stop. Development of electrical and electronic systems found interlocking moving toward relay solutions that became very common and are still used on railways. Finally computer based interlocking was introduced and successfully implemented in 90 's. Interlocking logic of those solutions has not been formalised {{so that it can be}} progressed toward intelligent transport systems. <b>Interlocking</b> <b>functions</b> are limited to ensure train operations are safe.

40|$|There are {{in excess}} of 200, 000 small to medium {{enterprises}} (SMEs) operating in Ireland. The Irish government has hailed them as the ‘drivers’ of the Irish economy, whilst the Irish Times described them as ‘the spine’ of our economic success. Now, Irish SMEs are feeling {{the brunt of the}} economic crisis. Both the success and failure of SMEs are linked to both managerial and entrepreneurial competencies. Entrepreneurship education and management skills are vital to SME development. For this reason, this study analyses an entrepreneur’s education and management skills as key determinants in the development of Irish SMEs. Entrepreneurship is a composite skill, the resultant of a mix of many qualities and traits which are enhanced by entrepreneurship education. Therefore, education is a fundamental variable in the ability of entrepreneurs to develop and start-up an enterprise. Equally vital is an entrepreneurs management skills Management consists of the <b>interlocking</b> <b>functions</b> of formulating corporate policy, organising, planning, controlling and directing business resources Management {{is one of the main}} distinguishing features of SME development. This study uses a quantitative method of research surveying Irish entrepreneurs in the ICT sector. In addition to the quantitative closed questions, open-ended questions are used to add value to the study and enhance reasoning of the causal connections between entrepreneurship education and management skills. The findings show a positive correlation between entrepreneurship education and business start up. Despite operating within the ICT sector, the majority of entrepreneurs state that their education is more relative to business than technology. The results also uncover a deficit in managerial skills in some areas of the SMEs, due to a lack of management training, as a result of time and cost restraints Finally, among the SMEs surveyed, those which were founded pre-recession and had successfully expanded remain unaffected by the economic downturn. These, together with the SMEs founded during the recession, find their mam issues to be access to finance and the inability to expand...|$|R
40|$|Whether it's Web 2. 0 or {{literacy}} 2. 0, it's a {{whole new}} way of thinking. To understand what the term literacy 2. 0 means, it's necessary {{to think of it as}} a new mind-set—or a new ethos—as well as a new practice. To begin, however, it's useful to look at the concept of Web 2. 0 as opposed to Web 1. 0. Web 2. 0 describes a business model whereby Internet companies actually provide a service rather than sell products or promote ready-made, static artifacts. For example, Ofoto—Web 1. 0 —was designed to sell digital-to-paper photo processing to users. This venture did not have staying power. In contrast, Web 2. 0 's Flickr is a user-generated content management system designed simply as a host for photo sharing. It accrues its revenue through site-based advertising. Web 2. 0 businesses use enabling services—such as the Google suite of services, YouTube, Wikipedia, and the like—that live on the Web rather than on individual computers; that is, they are part of our "Webtops " and not our desktops. The shift to Web 2. 0 is not simply the development of new ways of doing things, as in an upgrade. Rather, it's an entirely new worldview (Lankshear & Knobel, 2006).

30|$|In {{spite of}} American {{dominance}} {{and the associated}} peddling of its liberal democratic cum capitalist development model, the emergent South Korean ruling class opted for the authoritarian developmental state model. The model combined two contradictory features: authoritarianism and development (Jensen, 2008). In {{the case of the}} former, the state, among other things, asphyxiated political rights and civil liberties. On the other hand (the latter), the state sought to improve the material conditions of its citizens. The authoritarian developmental state was hoisted on several pillars. At the core was an ideology that prioritized socio-economic development as the national project. One of the major strategies that was pursued in this vein was the undertaking of land reforms. The overarching purpose was to redistribute land so that the agricultural sector could become a central pillar of national development. Accordingly, the landed class, which had monopolized the land, was abolished (You, 2011). Thereafter, the vision was embodied in a development plan that served as the roadmap. In order to implement the plan, various public institutions were established. In order to make these institutions efficient and effective, the recruitment of personnel was based on merit as the pathway to mobilizing the requisite administrative, managerial and technical skills that were germane to the developmental process. Also, public servants were given excellent compensation packages, secured tenure and autonomy in decision-making. Collectively, these public institutions had several <b>interlocking</b> <b>functions,</b> including the formulation and implementation of development policies, and providing oversight of the private businesses in the various sectors of the economy. Another major element was the development of an industrial base. This created the conditions for the production of manufactured goods. In turn, this helped foster trade competitiveness. Also, the state established its suzerainty over the “market”, to ensure that the mechanism was aligned with the national development agenda. As for the financing of development, the state used an assortment of strategies, including public investment in various industries, and the development of stabilization policies, such as currency control, to help insulate the local economy from external shocks. Overall, the state was then well positioned to provide various “public goods” to the citizens, including health care and education.|$|R

Correct targeting of the transgene was confirmed by Southern blot and PCR analyses. Histochemical X-gal (5 -bromo- 4 -chloro- 3 -indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside) staining demonstrated expression of β-galactosidase in maturation stage ameloblasts. No X-gal staining was observed in secretory stage ameloblasts or in odontoblasts. Retained enamel proteins were observed in the maturation stage enamel of the Klk 4 null mouse, but not in the Klk 4 heterozygous or wild-type mice. The enamel layer in the Klk 4 null mouse was normal in thickness and contained decussating enamel rods but was rapidly abraded following weaning, despite the mice being maintained on soft chow. In function the enamel readily fractured within the initial rod and interrod enamel above the parallel enamel covering the dentino-enamel junction. Despite the lack of Klk 4 and the retention of enamel proteins, significant levels of crystal maturation occurred (although delayed), and the enamel achieved a mineral density in some places greater than that detected in bone and dentin.

The square (14 m 14 m) tank {{is able to}} generate and absorb waves from 0. 5 Hz to 2. 0 Hz, by means of 148 active hinged flap wave makers. An independent mechanical system drives each flap {{by means of a}} 1 HP servo-motor and a ball-screw based transmission system. A customized ultrasonic wave probe is installed in each flap, and is responsible for measuring wave elevation in the flap. A complex automation architecture was implemented, with three Programmable Logic Computers (PLCs), and a low-level software is responsible for all the <b>interlocks</b> and maintenance <b>functions</b> of the tank. Furthermore, all the control algorithms for the generation and absorption are implemented using higher level software (MATLAB /Simulink block diagrams). These algorithms calculate the motions of the wave makers both to generate and absorb the required wave field by taking into account the layout of the flaps and the limits of wave generation. The experimental transfer function that relates the flap amplitude to the wave elevation amplitude is used for the calculation of the motion of each flap. This paper describes the main features of the tank, followed by a detailed presentation of the whole automation system. It includes the measuring devices, signal conditioning, PLC and network architecture, real-time and synchronizing software and motor control loop. Finally, a validation of the whole automation system is presented, by means of the experimental analysis of the transfer function of the waves generated and the calculation of all the delays introduced by the automation system.

The NMCS includes in a highly integrated suite of hardware and software all components required to: 2 ̆ 022 Acquire real-time data from multiple analog and digital instruments 2 ̆ 022 Store this data on digital media, 2 ̆ 022 Use the real-time data as inputs to real-time control functions, such as autopilots and Dynamic positioning components, 2 ̆ 022 Provide drive signals for multiple steering and propulsion elements, {{as well as other}} synchronized commands to devices such as winches, ballast systems, and roll compensation systems The NMCS is based almost entirely 011 Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) components. These include; 2 ̆ 022 Power sub-system components, power sources including batteries for free-running models and remote systems, 2 ̆ 022 Charging Systems, 2 ̆ 022 Power Safety <b>interlock</b> systems, E-Stop <b>functions,</b> 2 ̆ 022 Computers, 2 ̆ 022 Computer networking equipment all communications is handled via standard Ethernet devices. 2 ̆ 022 Motor Controllers and support components, 2 ̆ 022 Data Acquisition, 2 ̆ 022 Synchronization system, that coordinates, synchronizes all elements of acquisition and control, 2 ̆ 022 NRC written custom software provides integration for all of the various hardware functions. The underlying principle of the design was to integrate complex functions into a very flexible system that can be applied to any of NRC's model testing requirements, field trials with models or full scale trials systems. The modularity of the system includes hardware and software aspects, that allow the experiment designer to tailor component content to their exact requirements, and makes it efficient to implement. The core system design allows for the continuous addition of new functions, ongoing improvement of functions, as new requirements are defined or new technologies become available.
