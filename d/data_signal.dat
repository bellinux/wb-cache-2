The patent, issued in 2009, primarily describes how the game maintains the roughly spherical nature of the katamari when objects are picked up, though extends to concepts such as tracking objects collected based on temperature or weight values, which were modes included with later games of the series.|$|E

[...] The terminal multiplexer {{contains a}} wavelength-converting transponder for each <b>data</b> <b>signal,</b> an optical multiplexer and where necessary an optical amplifier (EDFA). Each wavelength-converting transponder receives an optical <b>data</b> <b>signal</b> from the client-layer, such as Synchronous optical networking [...] or {{another type of}} <b>data</b> <b>signal,</b> converts this signal into the electrical domain and re-transmits the signal at a specific wavelength using a 1,550nm band laser.

The terminal multiplexer {{may or may not}} also include a local transmit EDFA for power amplification of the multi-wavelength optical signal. In the mid-1990s DWDM systems contained 4 or 8 wavelength-converting transponders; by 2000 or so, commercial systems capable of carrying 128 signals were available.|$|E

[...] The time of off-peak charging is usually seven hours between midnight and 7:00am GMT/BST, and this is designed to power storage heaters and immersion heaters. In the UK, such tariffs are typically branded Economy 7, White Meter or Dual-Rate. The popularity of such tariffs has declined in recent years, {{at least in the}} domestic market, because of the (perceived or real) deficiencies of storage heaters and the comparatively much low cost of natural gas per kWh (typically a factor of 3-5 times lower). Nevertheless, a sizeable number of properties do not have the option of gas, with many in rural areas being outside the gas supply network, and others being expensive upfront to upgrade to a radiator system.|$|E

40|$|This work {{analyses}} {{the potential}} of compressed sensing (CS) for compressing shock <b>data</b> <b>signals</b> of space launch vehicles. Multiple shock <b>data</b> <b>signals</b> were compressed using compressed sensing by exploiting the sparsity of the shock <b>data</b> <b>signals</b> in the time domain. Since shock <b>data</b> <b>signals</b> are sparse in wavelet domain also, thresholding based DWT compression was performed to compare the performance of compressed sensing. Three performance metrics, viz. Peak Root mean-square Difference (PRD), Compression Ratio (CR) and execution time were used. It is also evaluated how compression of the shock data reflects in the Shock Response Spectrum (SRS). The results clearly show that CS surpasses the DWT based compression in terms of execution time for a given CR but has slightly inferior results in terms of PRD for higher values of CR. With lower computation power requirements and dimensionality reduction, CS becomes an ideal choice for compressing shock <b>data</b> <b>signals</b> in a mobile signal processing system with constraints on processing power and for transmission over a power-hungry wireless network...|$|R
