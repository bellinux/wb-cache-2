500|$|Within {{the medical}} and {{scientific}} communities, there is a broad consensus regarding alcoholism as a disease state. For example, the American Medical Association considers alcohol a drug and states that [...] "drug addiction is a chronic, relapsing brain disease characterized by compulsive drug seeking and use despite often devastating consequences. It results from a complex interplay of biological vulnerability, <b>environmental</b> <b>exposure,</b> and developmental factors (e.g., stage of brain maturity)." [...] Alcoholism has a higher prevalence among men, though, in recent decades, the proportion of female alcoholics has increased. Current evidence indicates that in both men and women, alcoholism is 50–60 percent genetically determined, leaving 40–50 percent for environmental influences. Most alcoholics develop alcoholism during adolescence or young adulthood. 31 percent of college students show signs of alcohol abuse, while six percent are dependent on alcohol. Under the DSM's new definition of alcoholics, that means about 37 percent of college students may meet the criteria.|$|E

Further, comparing GPS and GIS measures of <b>environmental</b> <b>exposures</b> along routes to and from school, we tested for evidence of selective daily mobility bias when using GPS data. METHODS: This study is a cross-sectional analysis, using objective assessments of body weight in relation to multiple <b>environmental</b> <b>exposures.</b> Data presented are from a sample of 94 school-aged children, aged 5 - 11 years. Children's heights and weights were measured by trained researchers, and used to calculate BMI z-scores. Participants wore a GPS device for one full week. <b>Environmental</b> <b>exposures</b> were estimated within home and school neighbourhoods, and along GIS (modelled) and GPS (actual) routes from home to school. We directly compared associations between BMI and GIS-modelled versus GPS-derived <b>environmental</b> <b>exposures.</b> The {{study was conducted in}} Mebane and Mount Airy, North Carolina, USA, in 2011. RESULTS: In adjusted regression models, greater school walkability was associated with significantly lower mean BMI. Greater home walkability was associated with increased BMI, as was greater school access to green space. Adjusted associations between BMI and route exposure characteristics were null. The use of GPS-actual route exposures did not appear to confound associations between <b>environmental</b> <b>exposures</b> and BMI in this sample. CONCLUSIONS: This study found few associations between <b>environmental</b> <b>exposures</b> in home, school and commuting domains and body weight in children. However, walkability of the school neighbourhood may be important. Of the other significant associations observed, some were in unexpected directions. Importantly, we found no evidence of selective daily mobility bias in this sample, although our study design is in need of replication in a free-living adult sample...|$|R

The exposome has been proposed to complement the genome and be the totality of all <b>environmental</b> <b>exposures</b> of an individual over his or her lifetime. However, if measurements of the exposome in biological samples are the sole tool for exposure assessment {{there are a number}} of limitations. First, it has limited utility for fully capturing the impact of complex mixtures such environmental tobacco smoke or particulate matter air pollution. Second, a number of relevant <b>environmental</b> <b>exposures</b> such as noise, heat or electromagnetic fields do not have direct correlates as metabolites or protein adducts, but there is important evidence linking them with health effects. Third, functional genomic changes are likely in many instances to be both a susceptibility factor and a marker of internal doses in response to <b>environmental</b> <b>exposures.</b> Fourth, internal dose measurements of <b>environmental</b> <b>exposures</b> might have lost the distinct signature of the relevant sources. This paper emphasises the obligation of environmental epidemiology to provide robust evidence to assist timely and sufficient protection of vulnerable subgroups of populations from environmental hazards.
