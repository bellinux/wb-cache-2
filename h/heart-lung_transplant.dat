25|$|It was {{the advent}} of {{cyclosporine}} that altered transplants from research surgery to life-saving treatment. In 1968 surgical pioneer Denton Cooley performed 17 transplants, including the first <b>heart-lung</b> <b>transplant.</b> Fourteen of his patients were dead within six months. By 1984 two-thirds of all heart transplant patients survived for five years or more. With organ transplants becoming commonplace, limited only by donors, surgeons moved on to riskier fields, including multiple-organ transplants on humans and whole-body transplant research on animals. On 9 March 1981, the first successful <b>heart-lung</b> <b>transplant</b> took place at Stanford University Hospital. The head surgeon, Bruce Reitz, credited the patient's recovery to cyclosporine-A.|$|E
40|$|The {{operation}} of combined heart-lung transplantation results in acute denervation of the heart, lungs, and airways {{below the level}} of the trachea. The bronchoconstrictor response to inhaled methacholine of 12 recipients of <b>heart-lung</b> <b>transplants</b> was compared with that of 12 recipients of heart transplants having similar medication and 12 normal subjects. The median dose of methacholine that produced a reduction of at least 20 % in the FEV 1 (PC 20) for the recipients of <b>heart-lung</b> <b>transplants</b> (8 mg/ml) was significantly lower than that for the recipients of heart transplants (64 mg/ml) and normal subjects (greater than 64 mg/ml). The increased airway reactivity {{may be related to the}} effects of chronic pulmonary denervation or subclinical inflammation in the airways. The effect of denervation on the response to full inspiration during bronchoconstriction was studied in six patients with <b>heart-lung</b> <b>transplants</b> by means of partial and maximal forced expiratory manoeuvres. Four showed bronchodilation after a deep breath, indicating that this response can occur after extrinsic pulmonary denervation in man. The patients with <b>heart-lung</b> <b>transplants</b> described a "tight" sensation in the anterior chest during bronchoconstriction, indicating that this sensation is not dependent on pulmonary innervation...|$|R

2500|$|In {{people with}} cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF), where both lungs {{need to be}} replaced, it is a technically easier operation with {{a higher rate of}} success to replace both the heart and lungs of the recipient with those of the donor. As the recipient's original heart is usually healthy, it can then be transplanted into a second recipient in need of a heart transplant, thus making the person with CF a living heart donor. [...] In a 2016 case at Stanford Medical Center, a woman who was needing a <b>heart-lung</b> <b>transplant</b> had cystic fibrosis which had led to one lung expanding and the other shrinking thereby displacing her heart. [...] The second patient who in turn received her heart was a woman with right ventricular dysplasia which had led to a dangerously abnormal rhythm. [...] The dual operations actually required three surgical teams including one to remove the heart and lungs from a recently deceased initial donor. [...] The two living recipients did well and in fact had an opportunity to meet six weeks after their simultaneous operations.|$|E
40|$|Reported {{clinical}} and experimental observations indicate that heart grafts in combined heart-lung transplantation are less frequently rejected than heart grafts transplanted alone. In order to elucidate {{the mechanism of}} this difference, twenty-eight inbred male Lewis rats receiving heterotopic allografts from inbred male Fisher rats were evaluated for surface markers of graft infiltrating lymphocytes (GIL) and peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) using flowcytometry. Monoclonal antibodies investigated {{in this study were}} W 3 / 25 (anti-helper T lymphocyte), OX 8 (anti-suppressor/cytotoxic T lymphocyte), OX 39 (anti-interleukin 2 receptor), and OX 6 (anti-MHC class II antigen). In the acute study, a heart transplanted group (n = 7) and a <b>heart-lung</b> <b>transplanted</b> group (n = 7) without immunosuppression were studied. In the chronic study, cyclosporine (10 mg/kg/day i. m.) were administered in the heart transplanted group (n = 7) and the <b>heart-lung</b> <b>transplanted</b> group (n = 7). Both in the acute and chronic studies, the proportion of W 3 / 25 positive cells in GIL of heart grafts of the heart transplanted group was significantly higher than that of heart grafts and lung grafts of the <b>heart-lung</b> <b>transplanted</b> group. OX 8 positive cell proportion in GIL of heart grafts and lung grafts of the <b>heart-lung</b> <b>transplanted</b> group were significantly higher than that of heart grafts of the heart transplanted group. These results lead us to speculate that suppressor T lymphocytes are an important distinguishing factor in the rejection processes of heart allografts and heart-lung allografts as observed in clinical experience. </p...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjective: Mechanical {{cardiorespiratory}} {{support is}} occasionally required {{before or after}} pediatric thoracic organ transplantation. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is {{the most commonly used}} mechanical support technique in children. The goal {{of this study was to}} examine the indications for initiation and outcomes after peritransplant use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted of 65 patients who received peritransplant extracorporeal membrane oxygenation between November 1994 and June 2000. The pretransplant group included 45 patients (average age, 38 months) supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and listed for transplantation (31 heart, 8 lung, and 6 heart-lung), and the post-transplant group included 20 patients (average age, 83 months) who required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation after thoracic organ transplantation (12 heart, 6 lung, and 2 <b>heart-lung</b> <b>transplants).</b> Hospital course and outcomes were evaluated. Results: With regard to pretransplant extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, patients listed for heart transplants were more likely to survive to transplantation than were those listed for lung or <b>heart-lung</b> <b>transplants</b> (12 / 31 [39 %] vs 1 / 14 [7 %], P =. 03). There was no difference in long-term survival between heart transplant patients after extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and those without extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (12 -month actuarial survival, 83 % vs 73 %; P =. 68). Patients who survived for prolonged periods on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (> 250 hours) typically received heart transplants (7 / 8 [88 %]). With regard to post-transplant extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, patients receiving lung or <b>heart-lung</b> <b>transplants</b> had better short-term outcomes than those receiving heart transplants (63 % survived to discharge vs 33 %). All 3 patients with early graft dysfunction receiving lung transplants survived to discharge. Conclusions: Long-term outcomes among those undergoing heart transplantation after support with an extracorporeal membrane oxygenator are comparable with those of patients not receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation can be a useful post-transplant support device, particularly in patients undergoing lung transplants...|$|R

40|$|At present {{there is}} no {{satisfactory}} technique for repeated lung biopsy in recipients of <b>heart-lung</b> <b>transplants.</b> A new technique for lung biopsy, which might be adopted for this purpose, has been developed. A Teflon sheath is inserted through the jugular vein into the pulmonary artery {{with the aid of}} a balloon catheter. A flexible biopsy forceps is then introduced through the sheath into the pulmonary arterial tree and advanced into the periphery of the lung, where biopsy samples are taken. The procedure was attempted in 14 pigs. Initially crocodile jaw (two pigs) and fenestrated cups forceps (five pigs), which are currently in use for transbronchial lung biopsy, were used. Subsequently the biopsy forceps was modified and the jaws were replaced by a cutting needle mechanism (six pigs). Out of the 13 animals in which the procedure was technically possible, lung parenchyma was obtained from nine and pulmonary arterial wall from 11. One animal died shortly after the procedure. The cause of death could not be determined with certainty at postmortem examination. There was, however, a small tear on the surface of the lung, which could have produced a tension pneumothorax. The other 12 animals recovered from the procedure. They were killed 24 hours later and postmortem examination was carried out. One animal in which the crocodile jaw forceps had been used had a haematoma in the lower lobe (3 X 3 X 4 cm) and 100 ml of blood in the pleural cavity. In the other 11 animals, in which the fenestrated cups or the cutting needle forceps had been used, the intrapulmonary haematomas were 1 - 2 cm in diameter and the pleural surface was intact. It is concluded therefore that transvenous lung biopsy is feasible and that this procedure might find an application in monitoring rejection in recipients of <b>heart-lung</b> <b>transplants...</b>|$|R
