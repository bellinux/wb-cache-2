The two initial tiers also include sub levels, and professors are promoted between them for merit. Monthly starting salary for a full-time assistant professorship is around R$ 10 thousand, and for a tenured position around R$15 thousand. Uniquely among public universities in Brazil, Unicamp has a career focused on full-time research. Currently there are approximately 100 full-time researchers at the university.|$|E

Maria would later <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> conversion, at around the same age, albeit involuntarily. Moreover, both were eventually married to Dutch soldiers.|$|E

25|$|As in the novels, Saruman later {{joined forces}} with Sauron, though he {{retained}} his white robes and was not shown to be seeking the One Ring for his own use. He and Gandalf are the only wizards featured or mentioned in the Lord of the Rings films, {{and for the most}} part <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> experiences as in the novels. However, as seen in the extended edition of The Return of the King, Saruman is killed by Wormtongue atop Orthanc rather than in The Shire. The films place a greater emphasis on the connection between the Wizards' powers being manifested through their staffs: Gandalf and Saruman are visibly seen employing their staffs in their battle inside Orthanc, and Gandalf is rendered helpless when Saruman takes his staff from him. In a departure from the books, Gandalf's staff is shattered during his confrontation with the Witch-king.|$|E
25|$|A Japanese school {{opened in}} Hawaii in 1893 and other Japanese schools for {{temporary}} settlers in North America followed. In the {{years prior to}} World War II, many second generation Japanese American attended the American school by day and the Japanese school in the evening to keep up their Japanese skill as well as English. Other first generation Japanese American parents were worried that their child might <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> discrimination when going to school so they gave them the choice to either go back to Japan to be educated, or to stay in America with their parents and study both languages. Anti-Japanese sentiment during World War I resulted in public efforts to close Japanese-language schools. The 1927 Supreme Court case Farrington v. Tokushige protected the Japanese American community's right to have Japanese language private institutions. During the internment of Japanese Americans in World War II many Japanese schools were closed. After the war many Japanese schools reopened.|$|E
25|$|The custom in Québec {{was similar}} to the one in France until 1981. Women would {{traditionally}} go by their husbands' surname in daily life, but their maiden name remained their legal name. Since the passage of a 1981 provincial law intended to promote gender equality as outlined in the Québec Charter of Rights, no change may be made to a person's name without the authorization of the registrar of civil status or the authorization of the court. Newlyweds who wish to change their names upon marriage must therefore <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> procedure as those changing their names for other reasons. The registrar of civil status may authorize a name change if: 1) the name the person generally uses does not correspond to the name on their birth certificate, 2) the name is of foreign origin or too difficult to pronounce or write in its original form, or 3) the name invites ridicule or has become infamous. This law does not make it legal for a woman to immediately change her name upon marriage, as marriage is not listed among the reasons for a name change.|$|E

25|$|Mia visits Peyton, and Peyton is {{concerned}} that Mia is not focused on her work. She suggests to Mia that she listen to a CD of songs she could possibly sing. They clash because Mia writes all of her own songs. Eventually, Peyton gives up on Mia and asks her to leave the label. Meanwhile, Peyton deals with stomach pains. She sees a doctor about it, and tells the doctor about Ellie's cancer. Her tearful face after the phone call predicts trouble ahead. Peyton later finds out {{that she does not}} have cancer, but is actually pregnant. She tells Lucas first, and Haley finds out in her own time, but Peyton seems hesitant to share her news with Brooke because she knows how much Brooke has wanted a family. Peyton eventually tells Brooke, and Brooke is happy for her. Peyton has her first ultrasound, but is upset because she thinks that Lucas is too busy to come and has forgotten. Lucas surprises her by coming, and the two get to hear their baby's heartbeat for the first time. Later, Lucas and Peyton learn that Peyton has placenta praevia and that having this baby could mean the end of Peyton's life. Lucas, afraid of losing her and raising a child that has to <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> motherless state Peyton did, tries to guilt her into an abortion. They get past this and decide to have the baby. Lucas tells her that he wants to get married to her sooner, not because she might die beforehand, but because he loves her, and wants her to be his wife. Lucas and Peyton get married at the lake where they met. Haley is the minister. After the reception, Lucas and Peyton go home and Peyton collapses on the floor while waiting for Lucas's surprise. Lucas walks in the house and finds Peyton unconscious on the floor in a pool of blood. Peyton is rushed to the hospital by a blood-covered Lucas, who begs her not to leave him. Peyton goes through an emergency caesarean section, and falls into a coma. The caesarean section is successful and she has a daughter named Sawyer Brooke Scott. She later awakes with Lucas and Brooke by her side. Karen brings in Sawyer, and Nathan, Haley, Jamie and Julian join them. Dan visits Peyton and she, after some hesitation, allows Dan to hold Sawyer. She and Lucas then leave Tree Hill.|$|E

500|$|In July 1906 {{grazing land}} on Vatersay was raided by landless cottars from Barra and its isles, {{including}} three families from Mingulay. They were followed in 1907 by eight more raiders from Mingulay led by Micheal Neill Eachainn. Lady Gordon Cathcart took legal action but the visiting judge took {{the view that}} she had neglected her duties as a landowner and that [...] "long indifference to the necessities of the cottars had gone far to drive them to exasperation". Vatersay has sheltered anchorages and was only 300 metres (330yd) from Barra (until {{the construction of a}} causeway in 1990) and Neil MacPhee wrote [...] "it is better a thousand times to die here than to <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> hardships which were our lot" [...] on Mingulay.|$|E

500|$|The double {{burden is}} usually {{view as a}} primary problem for single women or married women. However, it is often less {{recognized}} that men can and often do <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> trials and hard times as a parent trying to balance work and the family. Within the book The Canadian Family in Crisis, Conway addresses this issue with an argument from Eichler. Eichler says, [...] "Social science fails to understand men" [...] by tending [...] "to downplay or ignore a potential conflict between work and home for men." [...] Married men can avoid {{the full impact of}} the double burden, but single fathers are totally incapable of avoiding the double burden of family and work. Though single fathers face the same number of problems that single mothers face, they have two advantages that play in their favor. Men usually have a higher income and have a shorter time of being single than women. However, until they are remarried or have a woman to help them out around the house, men still must deal with the sexual and emotional frustration as a woman does. They must deal with the balancing of work, childcare, and domestic responsibilities. Single fathers are usually doubtful about their ability be a parent, and they are challenged psychologically. [...] "The problems faced by the working single father are more than merely the logistical problems shared by all working parents. He has to change the way he feels about himself as man." [...] A man being a single parent and feelings the effects of the double burden can and will interfere with his career just as it does with a single mother that has a career. A study showed that five percent of single fathers were fired form their jobs due to the double burden and another eight percent quit because the double burden became too much of a burden for them to balance both work and the family. With that being said, single fathers feel the same, if not more, of the effect of the double burden as women do.|$|E

The system was overbuilt and too expensive for the small amount of freight traffic it carried. [...] Christensen (1996), who looked at colonial purpose, local needs, capital, service, and private-versus-public interests, concluded that making the railways a creature of the state hindered success because railway expenses had to <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time-consuming and political budgeting process as did all other state expenses.

2500|$|Experiencing a {{miscarriage}} [...] "is a major loss for all pregnant women." [...] A miscarriage {{can result in}} anxiety, depression or stress for those involved. The impact on a woman life can be underestimated. It can have an affect on the whole family. Almost all those experiencing {{a miscarriage}} go through a grieving process. Serious emotional impact is usually experienced immediately after the miscarriage. Some may <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> loss when an ectopic pregnancy is terminated. In some, {{the realization of the}} loss can take weeks. Providing family support to those experiencing the loss can be challenging because some find comfort in talking about the miscarriage while others may find the event painful to discuss. The father can have the same sense of loss. Expressing feelings of grief and loss can sometimes be harder for men. Some women are able to begin planning their next pregnancy after a few weeks of having the miscarriage. For others, planning another pregnancy can be difficult.|$|E
2500|$|DIA and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) are {{distinct}} organizations with different functions. DIA focuses on national level defense-military topics, while CIA is concentrated on broader, more general intelligence {{needs of the}} President and his Cabinet. Additionally, due to DIA's designation as a combat support agency, it has special responsibilities in meeting intelligence requirements specifically for the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Combatant Commanders, both in peace and at war. Although there are misconceptions {{in the media and}} public about the DIA–CIA rivalry, the two agencies have a mutually beneficial relationship and division of labor.

Using the machine, Kurisu leaps back to the night of August 3, where she observes Rintarō disappearing and reappearing from existence, with everyone's memories of him changing accordingly. She is then contacted by the visitor from before, revealed to be Suzuha Amane, who came from the future using a time machine Kurisu built. She explains to both Kurisu and Rintarō that all the memories of World Lines Rintarō had visited is overloading his Reading Steiner, causing him to fluctuate between the current world line and the [...] "R" [...] world line, the only other world line where neither Mayuri nor Kurisu die. Suzuha states {{the only way to}} save him from vanishing completely is to use a time machine to travel to the past, but Rintarō ostensibly refuses, as he feels neither time machines nor time leap machines should exist and doesn't want Kurisu to <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> suffering he went through, saying he would rather disappear to allow her and Mayuri to live in peace.

2500|$|In February 2004, NBC {{executive}} Marc Graboff informed Ross of the conversations, and he in turn ran {{the idea}} of waiting four more years to O'Brien, who was immediately receptive. Zucker, along with top late-night executive Rick Ludwin, met with Leno in March at his Burbank studio to discuss the contract extension, and explained the network's stance on handing over the show to O'Brien. While Leno quietly felt both disappointed and befuddled, he noted {{he did not want}} to see himself and O'Brien <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> dilemma he and Letterman faced twelve years earlier, and agreed to the plans. His only request was that NBC wait to announce O'Brien's installment as host well after the extension, to which the executives agreed. While Leno handled the news professionally (to Zucker's relief), he soon headed to Tonight Show producer Debbie Vickers' office to let her know he felt as if he had just been fired. NBC's announcement of the renewal inevitably led to press speculation on O'Brien's fate; to that end, O'Brien and his team went with the charade, peppering interviews with unclear, vague statements on his future. On September 27, 2004, O'Brien officially signed on to become the next host of The Tonight Show; NBC allowed the first comment aside from the press release to come from Leno on that night's show. [...] "'Cause this, you know, this show is like a dynasty,” Leno said. “You hold it, and then you hand it off to the next person.
