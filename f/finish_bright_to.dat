50|$|May Hill {{remained}} in {{training as a}} four-year-old, and was campaigned mainly in staying races, but failed to win in five attempts. On her seasonal debut she finished third to Marco Ricci and Major Green in the Paradise Stakes over two miles at Ascot in May and then ran second on her next appearance. She then sustained a serious injury when running third behind Mr Bigmore in the Lymm Stakes at Haydock. She was then off the racecourse until autumn, when the best of her two runs came when she <b>finished</b> third <b>to</b> <b>Bright</b> <b>Finish</b> and Shangamuzo in the Jockey Club Cup.|$|R
50|$|The opening {{theme is}} a {{powerful}} chorale, originally given over a march, in which the rhythmic thundering of the timpani recalls certain passages in the opening movement. The second subject, a song-theme, is remarkable in that it recollects not only its counterpart in the first movement but also the Adagio. The third subject is a march-theme, which is a direct reworking of {{the introduction to the}} third subject group of the opening movement. In the recapitulation, this third theme is presented as a fugue which leads to the solemn coda and the splendid, <b>bright</b> <b>finish</b> <b>to</b> the symphony.|$|R
5000|$|Shangamuzo {{emerged as}} a {{successful}} handicapper {{in the first half}} of his three-year-old season, in which he was trained by Gavin Hunter. On his first appearance of the season he won a maiden race over eleven furlongs at Kempton and then finished second to Lighter in a handicap over on and a half miles at Haydock in June, but was awarded the race after the [...] "winner" [...] was disqualified for causing interference. Later that month he was sent to Royal Ascot and recorded his first major success in the King George V Stakes and was then stepped up in distance to win a minor event over two miles at Newcastle Racecourse. Shangamuzo's winning run came to an end when he finished fifth in a race at Newbury and he then finished third to Sir Montagu and the future Cheltenham Gold Cup winner Alverton in the Ebor Handicap at York in August. On his next appearance, Shangamuzo defeated Alverton by one and a half lengths in the Top Rank Club Handicap at Newcastle to win his fifth race of the season. In October, the colt was moved up in class and <b>finished</b> second <b>to</b> <b>Bright</b> <b>Finish</b> in the Group Three Jockey Club Cup over two miles at Newmarket.|$|R

2500|$|Polishing and buffing are {{finishing}} {{processes for}} smoothing a workpiece's surface using an abrasive and a work wheel or a leather [...] strop. Technically polishing refers to processes that use an abrasive that is {{glued to the}} work wheel, while buffing uses a loose abrasive applied to the work wheel. Polishing is a more aggressive process while buffing is less harsh, which leads <b>to</b> a smoother, <b>brighter</b> <b>finish.</b> A common misconception is that a polished surface has a mirror <b>bright</b> <b>finish,</b> however most mirror <b>bright</b> <b>finishes</b> are actually buffed.|$|R
