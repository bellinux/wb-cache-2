The conduit wall along the stream has collapsed, revealing the longitudinal section and cross section of the structure as well as the longitudinal section of a rectangular shaft rising from the vault of the conduit. ** Construction: The vault is made of a single layer of fieldstones with rubble packing on the exterior, all bonded with a beige lime mortar with small stone inclusions. On the interior surface of the conduit wall, a very hard mortar with a reddish orange color covers not the stones of the wall but their interstices. ** Description: The external dimensions of the conduit are 2. 5 m high by 1. 2 m wide. In cross section, the interior of the conduit is 0. 50 m wide with a 0. 30 m wide channel centered in the floor. The channel is 0. 90 m in height, {{and the rest of the}} conduit rises another 0. 90 m above the channel. The conduit side walls are 0. 40 – 0. 50 m thick. An opening in the roof of the vault leads to an <b>inspection</b> <b>shaft</b> that rises vertically from the conduit and is preserved to a height of 0. 3 m above the vault.

Only the north wall, along with a portion of the vault, are built into the hillside and are therefore well preserved. The aqueduct conduit and horizontal access conduit have been incorporated into a modern pumping system, so they too are well preserved. Most of the barrel-vaulted structure attached to {{the southern end of the}} access conduit has been destroyed, so that only a little more than 1 m of it stands. Only the highest voussoirs of the vault of the aqueduct conduit are visible, because the conduit is full of water, mud, and debris. ** Construction: The vertical shaft is built of roughly worked, mortared field stones and is topped by a barrel vault. The stones of the shaft are 0. 20 – 0. 30 m long, 0. 10 – 0. 15 m high, 0. 20 – 0. 30 m deep. The horizontal access conduit is barrel vaulted and built of mortared masonry, with regularly shaped, rectangular blocks 0. 20 – 0. 30 m on a side. ** Description: The vertical shaft is 1. 45 m by 1. 45 m internally, and the vertical walls are 0. 90 – 1 m thick. The depth of the shaft, from the vault to the top of the conduit below, is approximately 6. 3 m. It is topped by a barrel vault oriented perpendicular to the stream bed and to the aqueduct conduit under ground. The bottom of the shaft at its point of intersection with the conduit is accessible via a horizontal access conduit, which emerges from the north (left) bank of the stream.

40|$|Path {{planning}} {{is an essential}} capability for autonomous robots, and many applications impose challenging constraints alongside the standard requirement of obstacle avoidance. Coverage {{planning is}} one such task, in which a single robot must sweep its end effector over the entirety of a known workspace. For two-dimensional environments, optimal algorithms are documented and well-understood. For threedimensional structures, however, few of the available heuristics succeed over occluded regions and low-clearance areas. This thesis makes several contributions to sampling-based coverage path planning, for use on complex three-dimensional structures. First, we introduce a new algorithm for planning feasible coverage paths. It is more computationally efficient in problems of complex geometry than the well-known dual sampling method, especially when high-quality solutions are desired. Second, we present an improvement procedure that iteratively shortens and smooths a feasible coverage path; robot configurations are adjusted without violating any coverage constraints. Third, we propose a modular algorithm that allows the simple components of a structure to be covered using planar, back-and-forth sweep paths. An analysis of probabilistic completeness, {{the first of its}} kind applied to coverage planning, accompanies each of these algorithms, as well as ensemble computational results. The motivating application throughout this work has been autonomous, in-water ship hull <b>inspection.</b> <b>Shafts,</b> propellers, and control surfaces protrude from a ship hull and pose a challenging coverage problem at the stern. Deployment of a sonar-equipped underwater robot on six large vessels has led to robust operations that yield triangle mesh models of these structures; these models form the basis for planning inspections at close range. We give results from a coverage plan executed at the stern of a US Coast Guard Cutter, and results are also presented from an indoor experiment using a precision scanning laser and gantry positioning system. by Brendan J.

40|$|In {{recent years}} drilled shafts {{have become the}} {{preferred}} foundation method for marine bridges. Typically, the drilled shaft is selected over traditional driven piles due to soil strata encountered, construction economy, increased lateral stiffness requirements, and/or vibration control considerations. The most critical component in drilled shaft construction is borehole stabilization. Wall sloughing or groundwater inclusion can have devastating effects {{on the strength of}} the finished shaft however recent research has shown that the materials, more specifically the slurry, used to accomplish stabilization may be having a negative impact on the durability of the finished product. This thesis investigates the durability of drilled shaft specimens {{as it relates to the}} slurry type and viscosity. Electrochemical corrosion potential test results from 23 lab cast specimens showed that the shafts cast using bentonite slurry were 54 % more likely to exhibit corrosion potential crossing the ASTM threshold of - 350 mV. The laboratory setting allowed for visual <b>inspection</b> of each <b>shaft.</b> This <b>inspection</b> showed reflective quilting on all bentonite cast shafts, this quilting was visible to a lesser degree on select polymer cast shafts and not present on shafts cast in water.

40|$|Substantial {{submarine}} procurement {{and maintenance}} costs {{could be saved}} by extending the submarine propulsion <b>shaft</b> <b>inspection</b> interval from 6 to 12 years {{as part of the}} design of the next class of vessels. On existing classes, corrosion fatigue limits this interval, but data on corrosion fatigue life is sparse and incomplete. An existing model from previous research has been updated and stands ready to provide predictions, given more relevant data. Techniques and devices are developed to obtain this data. First, traditional fatigue machines and samples are adapted to provide information on corrosion fatigue on pre-pitted and unpitted samples. Artificial seawater is used for comparative consistency; tests with enzymatic or actual seawater are recommended. Next, direct-current potential drop is proven as a means to detect transitions in the corrosion fatigue failure chain on a bending fatigue specimen exposed to artificial seawater. This method can be used to detect transition of pits to cracks in situ, and it is believed that {{it can be used to}} detect ingress of water through protective coatings, which has not previously been measured or credited in a review of predictive models and design life analyses. This technique should be verified and expanded to detect additional transitions and to apply to the devices developed as part of this research. Second, test devices are developed to more accurately reflect the operational submarine propulsion shaft, in terms of loading, environment, and number of test cycles. The benchtop prototype intended to prove the concept has been identified by the Navy as an improvement over existing machines, and is subsequently redesigned as an inexpensive and rapidly deployable test stand for uncoated shaft specimens. The originally envisioned device is also designed and assembled. It leverages non-contact air bearings and motors, as well as flexural pivots, to enable very high cycle fatigue testing while minimizing the parasitic loads imparted on the sample by the test machine. The next recommended step is deployment of this device as a tool for verification testing of fully coated samples, necessary based on the large scope of the desired increase in shaft life. by Douglas E.

40|$|Drilled shafts are {{cylindrical}} deep foundations {{constructed by}} casting fluid concrete into an excavated hole. These elements rely largely on side shear resistance generated by their substantial diameters and lengths to effectively transfer loads. Therefore, an exceptional concrete to soil interface {{is essential for}} proper performance of these structures. The FDOT preferred stabilization fluid, bentonite slurry, has been proven to degrade this interface with increased exposure time due to filter cake formation. For this reason, slurry exposure time has been limited to 36 hours by FDOT. Alternately, polymer slurries do not form a filter cake but rather stabilize excavations through continuous soil infiltration and the associated cohesion that accompanies the slurry presence. As polymer slurry use is relatively new {{to the state of}} Florida, FDOT does not presently have clear specifications regarding polymer exposure time limits. Hence, this thesis presents the results of pullout tests performed on 1 / 10 th scale drilled shafts constructed with both polymer and bentonite slurries and with varying exposure times. To explore the effect of exposure time on side shear resistance, 24 - 4 in diameter 8 ft long shafts were constructed: 6 with bentonite and 18 with three different polymer products (6 each). After being exposed to the respective slurry for 0, 1, 2, 4, 8 or 24 hours, each excavated hole was concreted and tested after 7 days of curing. Pullout tests served as a direct measure of side shear resistance due to the absence of base resistance associated with compression testing. After testing, shafts were exhumed and sectioned for filter cake measurement. As expected, shafts constructed using bentonite slurries immediately exhibited a decrease in capacity with increased exposure time. Between 0 and 24 hours a 34 % reduction in capacity was witnessed. These reductions were attributed to filter cake thickness which increased with exposure time along with the reduction in effective shaft. After 4 hours of exposure, side shear resistance for the bentonite shafts approached an asymptote, likely defined by the strength of the filter cake formed. The side shear resistance of all polymer shafts exceeded that of the 24 hr bentonite control shaft by 20 - 50 percent depending on the polymer product used. For a given polymer product no capacity reduction was noted with respect to time. <b>Inspection</b> of exhumed <b>shafts</b> revealed the formation of a soil cake (region of stabilized soil stuck to the shaft) {{around the perimeter of the}} polymer shafts. Therefore, the side shear resistance of the polymer shafts was defined by the soil-to-soil interface surrounding the shaft and not by an intermediate filter cake. The study resulted in the following findings: (1) open excavations using polymer slurry stabilization are not adversely affected by extended exposure time, (2) the effect of filter cake formation in bentonite supported excavations slows with time whereby no significant degradation in capacity was noted after 8 hours, (3) shafts constructed with polymer slurry performed better than those constructed with bentonite, and (4) as polymer slurry flow into the surrounding soil does not slow with time, more slurry volume is required (compared with bentonite) and slurry level must be continuously maintained...|$|R
40|$|There {{are over}} 602, 000 bridges in the United States, of which 12. 5 % are {{classified}} as functionally obsolete and 11. 2 % are structurally deficient. The functionally obsolete bridges will require expansion or replacement to increase the service capacity of the bridge. The structurally deficient bridges will either need remediation of the load carrying elements which are damaged or deteriorated or {{will need to be}} replaced completely. Replacement of the bridges means new construction; new construction means better design and quality assurance to meet the 100 + year service life requirement in place now. Rehabilitation of bridges will require better design and quality assurance to increase the current service life of the structure. This dissertation presents new design, testing, and repair methods developed to extend the life of new and existing bridges through pressure grouting, thermal integrity testing of drilled shafts, and the bond enhancement of fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) repair materials bonded to concrete with vacuum bagging and pressure bagging, respectively. Pressure grouting of drilled shaft tips has been used for over five decades to improve the end bearing capacity, but no rational design procedure had ever been published until this study. The research outlined in this dissertation analyzed nine grouted shafts and compared them to standard design procedures to determine the improvement in end bearing. Improvements ranged from 60 % to 709 % increase in end bearing capacity. From these improvements, a design procedure was developed for pressure grouted drilled <b>shafts.</b> Post construction <b>inspection</b> of drilled <b>shafts</b> relies largely on non-visual techniques dealing with measured concrete quantities, acoustic wave speed or frequency, gamma radiation attenuation and now the internal temperature of the curing concrete. Thermal Integrity Profiling (TIP), developed at USF, utilizes the heat of hydration of curing concrete to evaluate the concrete cover, foundation shape, cage alignment, and concrete mix design performance. This research developed standard test equipment and procedures for thermal integrity testing. Comparing the results of the different types of integrity tests is difficult due to the varied nature of the different tests. The dissertation looked at various shafts constructed across the nation which were tested with thermal and at least one other integrity test method. When compared to acoustic and gamma radiation test results, TIP agreed with 4 of 6 cases for acoustic and 2 of 5 cases using gamma radiation. In the one case were both sonic caliper and inclination data were available, TIP showed good agreement. Vacuum bagging and pressure bagging are techniques for improving the FRP-concrete bond in the repair of partially submerged piles. Prototype vacuum bagging and pressure bagging systems were developed and bond improvement assessed from results of pullout tests on full size piles repaired under simulated tidal exposures in the laboratory. Pressure bagging gave better bond and was found to be simpler because it did not require an airtight seal. A field demonstration project was conducted in which pressure bagging was used in combination with two different glass FRP systems to repair two corroding piles supporting the Friendship Trails Bridge across Tampa Bay.
