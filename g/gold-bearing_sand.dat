50|$|Gold mining {{occurs on}} the {{south-eastern}} {{flank of the}} plateau, and was pioneered in the Roman period {{as soon as the}} area had been conquered ca 75 AD. The remains are visible at Dolaucothi and traces of the Roman aqueducts can be seen on the neighbouring parts of the mountain. They tap both the River Cothi and Afon Twrch, Carmarthenshire. The earlier earthen aqueduct shows several channels above the minehead, and tapped local springs. The channels led to water tanks above a single opencast near to Pumpsaint on the south western flank of the plateau. A larger one tapped the Twrch higher up the valley. The Cothi aqueduct tapped the larger river about 7 miles upstream, and fed a large reservoir at the minehead. Such tanks were used in hushing, a method of removing surface debris to find gold veins in the bedrock. They were also used for washing <b>gold-bearing</b> <b>sand</b> or other deposits, a form of placer mining or hydraulic mining, as well washing crushed ore on special gold washing tables. From dating evidence at Melin-y-Milwyr, a small reservoir above the minehead and the large Roman fort under Pumpsaint village, mining tailed off after 150 AD although some presence continued till circa 350 AD.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Gold {{and silver}} {{deposits}} at the Southern {{slopes of the}} Vitosha and Verila Mountains, as well as gold bearing placers at the upper stream of the Struma River have been exploited since most ancient times, and especially intensively in certain historical periods. Traces of this remarkable ancient gold production can be found today {{in the area of}} the villages Chuipetlovo, Bosnek, Gorna Dikanya, Dolna Dikanya, Lisets and others. The volume of the washed <b>gold-bearing</b> <b>sand</b> and gravels along the rivers Struma, Klisura, Martinova and others is several millions m 3. Enormous are also the mines for gold production from the eluvial-delivial placers and from the in situ gold-silver ore occurrences. For example, the ancient quarry below the Kupena Peak in the Smilio area is with remarkable dimensions of 550 x 50 x 10 m. Similar is the scale of ore production {{in the area of the}} villages Gorna Dikanya and Dolna Dikanya. The existing data suggests that the main ore production took place during the Roman domination on the Balkans and mostly during the ІІІ-ІV century, as well as later during the Ottoman Period from the ХV to the ХVІІ century. The Struma River and most of its tributaries in the Sofia, Radomir and Pernik Districts are gold bearing. This fact has been known to people since most ancient times. So far there is no data for the most ancient gold production in the region, but there is no doubt, that it has started in prehistoric times, when a lot of the ore deposits on the Balkan Peninsula have become object of exploitation. In later historical times, when the or...|$|E

5000|$|The California gold rush, as {{with most}} gold rushes, started with the {{discovery}} of placer gold in sands and gravels of streambeds, where the gold had eroded from the hard-rock vein deposits.

This source was the [...] "mother" [...] of the gold in the river and so was dubbed the [...] "mother lode".|$|R

50|$|Gunnar E. Kaasen {{was born}} the son of Hans and Anna Kaasen in Burfjorddalen, in Troms county, Norway. He went to the United States to mine for gold in 1903, {{in the wake of}} the {{discovery}} of <b>gold-bearing</b> <b>sands</b> on Cape Nome in 1898, which triggered one of several gold rushes in the state between 1891 and 1898. Kaasen became an experienced musher and a resident of Nome. While the boom was spent by 1905, the port of Nome sits on Norton Sound, which is usually ice locked and inaccessible by ship between October and June. Dog sledding remained the primary transportation and communication link to the outside world during the winter months.|$|R
