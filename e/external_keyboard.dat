5|$|The Rhodes piano (also {{known as}} the Fender Rhodes piano or simply Fender Rhodes or Rhodes) is an {{electric}} piano invented by Harold Rhodes, which became particularly popular throughout the 1970s. Like a piano, it generates sound using keys and hammers, but instead of strings, the hammers strike thin metal tines, which are then amplified via an electromagnetic pickup which is plugged into an <b>external</b> <b>keyboard</b> amplifier and speaker.|$|E
5|$|The Nord Stage is multitimbral – {{each of the}} Piano, Organ, and Synth {{sections}} {{can sound}} independently. There are two Panels – A and B – each of which provides a separate configuration of the three sections within a single Program. Panels can be played independently, {{with one of the}} panels being controlled via an external MIDI keyboard controller, or they can be layered together, allowing for a maximum of 6 part multitimbral. Most of the buttons and knobs on the Stage, such as volume, instrument selection, drawbar levels (for organ) or filter controls (for synthesizer) can also be adjusted by the <b>external</b> <b>keyboard.</b>|$|E
25|$|Split point: The {{point on}} a {{keyboard}} where {{the choice of}} instrument can be split to allow two instruments to be played at once. In the late 1980s it was common to use a MIDI controller to control more than one keyboard from a single device. The MIDI controller had no sound of its own, but was designed {{for the sole purpose}} of allowing access to more sound controls for performance purposes. MIDI controllers allowed one to split the keyboard into two or more sections and assign each section to a MIDI channel, to send note data to an <b>external</b> <b>keyboard.</b> Many consumer keyboards offer at least one split to separate bass or auto-accompaniment chording instruments from the melody instrument.|$|E
25|$|Keyboard is a {{functionally}} {{separate unit}} {{which could be}} connected by non-multiplexed and multiplexed interfaces. Multiplexed keyboard units feature additional data direction line, allowing sending scan line number to the keyboard using same data lines used for return scan code, decreasing overall number of wires between keyboard and machine. Non-multiplexed interface is usually used for internal <b>keyboards</b> (and some <b>external</b> <b>keyboards,</b> like Panasonic CF-3300); multiplexed interface is used for <b>external</b> <b>keyboards</b> (e.g. in Yamaha YIS805 model).|$|R

500|$|Players {{have the}} option of using any {{combination}} of a keyboard, mouse, and controller to play Final Fantasy XI. While by default, a player using a PlayStation 2 or an Xbox 360 uses a virtual/in-game keyboard option, the player is able to use an <b>external</b> <b>keyboard</b> that is USB compatible for communication within the game. The heads-up display in Final Fantasy XI consists of a log window, menus, and several game information elements. The log window {{at the bottom of the}} screen displays system messages, battle messages, and text input by other players. Players may choose to filter what appears in the log window. [...] "Menus" [...] allow the player to access different commands, status windows, and configuration options. The [...] "action command menu" [...] appears just above the log window and gives the player several options to interact with the game world. Several menu options are available through the use of keyboard shortcuts, as well.|$|E

50|$|UMPCs with Windows XP {{installed}} {{are able}} to run any software that has been written for the Windows XP platform, though the small form factor often mandates some changes to the interface. The standard Windows XP interface is the default, though a choice of having an interface more suited for the small form factor is available with the Touch Pack Interface. As the units are so small, many UMPCs do not feature a physical keyboard, but an on-screen virtual keyboard provided in the Touch Pack Interface (such as the DialKeys, below). Also, since the device has standard USB 2.0 connectivity, <b>external</b> <b>keyboards</b> and mice can be attached.|$|R
50|$|With its pattern-based {{sequencing}} system, it {{is particularly}} suited for use as an accompaniment device. Unlike other sequencers in the QY series, however, the QY10 cannot auto-harmonize its backing tracks to chords played on an <b>external</b> MIDI <b>keyboard.</b>|$|R

There is also a slot for a microSD card to add up to 200 gigabytes.|$|E
50|$|The US-International {{keyboard}} {{may also}} used {{for the same reason}} (notably by programmers as it allows easier input of ASCII characters, provided that they are trained to a QWERTY layout rather than the most common AZERTY layouts available in most computer shops, including online). An alternative (extremely rarely found) to AZERTY is the Bépo layout : it's not available on any notebook, but may be used by adding an <b>external</b> <b>keyboard,</b> bought separately from some specialized shops.|$|E
50|$|The RIM BlackBerry lines {{offer only}} QWERTY and its {{localized}} variants AZERTY and QWERTZ. Apple's iOS 8.0 and later has {{the option to}} install onscreen keyboards from the App Store, which includes several free and paid Dvorak layouts. iOS 4.0 and later supports <b>external</b> Dvorak <b>keyboards.</b> Google's Android OS touchscreen keyboard can use Dvorak and other nonstandard layouts natively as of version 4.1.|$|R
50|$|Prolonged use of laptops {{can cause}} {{repetitive}} strain injury because of their small, flat keyboard and trackpad pointing devices,. Usage of separate, <b>external</b> ergonomic <b>keyboards</b> and pointing devices is recommended to prevent injury when working {{for long periods of}} time; they can be connected to a laptop easily by USB or via a docking station. Some health standards require ergonomic keyboards at workplaces.|$|R
50|$|Hauptwerk {{produces}} an audio signal {{in response to}} input received via MIDI. This input may originate from an <b>external</b> MIDI <b>keyboard</b> or from a MIDI sequencing program. An organ is constructed using a set of recorded sample files in conjunction with an XML configuration file that defines organ parameters such as ranks, stops, manuals, coupling and organ images for display in Hauptwerk's user interface.|$|R
50|$|The Apple II series had a {{keyboard}} {{built into the}} motherboard shell, {{with the exception of}} the Apple IIGS which featured an <b>external</b> <b>keyboard.</b> An upgrade kit was sold later to house the motherboard of an Apple IIGS in an Apple IIe case. The Apple II case was durable enough, according to a 1981 Apple ad, to protect an Apple II from a fire started when a cat belonging to one early user knocked over a lamp.|$|E
50|$|The enTourage eDGe is {{equipped}} with a camera above the LCD screen, as well as two USB ports which can take two flash memory drives, an <b>external</b> <b>keyboard,</b> and other compatible devices.

Both sides of the device may be folded closed like a book but they can also be fully folded open so that the screens are back-to-back.|$|E
50|$|The DCS 100 {{retained}} many of {{the characteristics}} of the prototype, including a separate shoulder carried Digital Storage Unit (DSU) to store and to visualize the images, and to house the batteries. The DSU contained a 200 megabyte hard disk drive that could store up to 156 images without compression, or up to 600 images using a JPEG compatible compression board that was offered later as an optional extra. An <b>external</b> <b>keyboard</b> allowed entry of captions and other image information.|$|E
50|$|Three {{versions}} of the CX5M were released. The first contained as its FM module the SFG-01, which could not receive external MIDI note information; it required a proprietary keyboard and only used its MIDI port was an output to send data to Yamaha's then-flagship DX7. The second version, the CX5M II (or CX7M/128 in Japan), upgraded the FM system to the SFG-05, which supported MIDI input and thus allowed the internal FM synth to be played by any <b>external</b> MIDI <b>keyboard.</b> There was also a later CX5M II with some smaller differences.|$|R
50|$|The Ion's {{keyboard}} has velocity sensitivity, but not aftertouch. However, {{the sound}} engine {{is capable of}} responding to both channel and polyphonic aftertouch messages received via MIDI. This feature means that with an <b>external</b> polyphonic aftertouch <b>keyboard</b> controller, the Ion {{can be made to}} modulate notes individually with finger pressure.|$|R
