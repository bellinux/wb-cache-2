6000|$|... "No, not {{a horrible}} one, since <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{making an appeal}} to your generosity. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>pretty</b> sure you cannot imagine {{yourself}} marrying my friend." ...|$|R
6000|$|Kit {{looked up}} with an apologetic smile. [...] "You imply I'm dull? Perhaps <b>I</b> <b>am</b> dull. You see, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> strenuously {{occupied}} not long since." ...|$|R
5000|$|On the {{instruments}} used in Transistor, Korb {{has stated that}} [...] "there {{is a lot of}} heavily delayed electric guitar and sampled drums, but I also tried to include a number of 'old-world' instruments: accordion, harp, mandolin, etc.". Korb worked with Barrett once again on Transistor, as she voiced the game's protagonist, Red. On their collaboration, Korb stated, [...] "after working with Ashley on a couple projects now, I feel like I've gotten a better sense of how to write for her voice. For me, that's the main consideration that affects my writing process. Our sessions <b>are</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>laid</b> back. If a melody line doesn't feel quite right in her voice we will change it on the fly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{maybe he}} didn't really pull the leg. You see, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> sound asleep. But he, or it, jumped {{over me and}} back again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, not Dora, though <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>pretty</b> much of Mrs. Woodbourne's opinion {{respecting}} her,' said Anne; 'I meant one who {{is always}} overlooked, Miss Lucy Hazleby.' ...|$|R
5000|$|After {{the race}} Rainey commentated: “... <b>I</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> lucky that we beat Doohan {{there when he}} had a problem. That’s who <b>I</b> <b>was</b> racing for the championship.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>pretty</b> sure Ritter hit you, Jack," [...] {{came from}} Andy. [...] "Anyway, I saw him aiming for you {{just before you}} {{staggered}} and fell." ...|$|R
60|$|It was {{the more}} easy to be put off, because Alan and <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>pretty</b> weary with our day's ride, and sat not very late after Catriona.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{am happy}} to say, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>pretty</b> well, Sir,' said the man, {{speaking}} with great deliberation, and closing the book. 'I hope you are the same, Sir?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{he knows}} me. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>pretty</b> {{well-known}} {{to most people}} in these regions. This is the tiger-hunter of whom I have spoken. His dwelling is not far-off." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The heat {{seems to}} suit me better, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>pretty</b> well here. Indeed <b>I</b> <b>am</b> better than <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> {{for more than}} a year, though I have a good deal of discomfort.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{think that}} it is, for from what I saw last night <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>pretty</b> well {{convinced}} {{that he did not}} play fair. I mean to go again tonight." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Harold, [...] "I {{suppose that}} <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>pretty</b> fair, that <b>is</b> at rough shooting; I {{never had much}} {{practice}} at driven birds {{and that kind of}} sport." ...|$|R
6000|$|A little stateliness was {{mingled with}} Miss Tox's sweetest friend's demeanour, but she kissed Miss Tox, and said, 'Lucretia, thank you, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>pretty</b> well. <b>I</b> hope you <b>are</b> the same. Hem!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't think so. Of {{course he}} had on a slouch hat, drawn down over his eyes, and an unusual suit of clothing, but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>pretty</b> certain it <b>was</b> Merwell." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Still, <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>pretty</b> safe. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{glad they}} have come now, for next Wednesday is the {{international}} football match. Garraway and <b>I</b> <b>are</b> the two Scotch half-backs. You must all come down and see it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{found myself}} {{now to be}} the very centre of the awful conflict. While not stating that the whole {{bombardment}} was directed at me personally, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>pretty</b> sure that it was." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, 'm; {{it was so}} lonesome in the rain, {{and this}} place seemed kinder like home, and I could hear 'em talkin' outside, and Sanch he found vittles, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> comfortable." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I think so, uncle; <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> shamming ill, {{and they}} thought I could not walk; but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>pretty</b> strong, and if I can't ride by myself <b>I</b> must <b>be</b> tied on to some one else." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] said Wyndham, [...] "I wondered--didn't think you'd {{carelessly}} stop too long. In fact, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> anxious until <b>I</b> {{heard the}} gun. But do you reckon somebody did push off the dinghy?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{one would}} be the best. It was our counting-house. There is some {{furniture}} in it yet. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>pretty</b> certain that you'll find a couple of camp bedsteads {{in one of the}} rooms." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> mad by this time, {{as you can}} guess. It {{is funny}} {{when you come to}} think of it afterwards, but the wonder then <b>was</b> that <b>I</b> didn't punch his head.|$|R
6000|$|... "She said, 'Tell Daren I {{must see}} him.' I promised {{and set out}} to find you. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> lucky to run into you.... And now, old sport, let me get personal, will you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{must make}} tracks {{for the water}} first, Harry, the young un and <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>pretty</b> near choking; and I expect the Indians are as bad, though it ain't their natur to talk about it." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I read it for {{the first}} time in about 20 years this year—recently. It <b>was</b> so great. <b>I</b> get it. I get fan mail now from people who weren't really born yet when the book came out. I don't think it's a perfect book by any means, but it's valid. I get where it comes from. I get what it <b>is.</b> <b>I</b> know that sounds so ambiguous. It's sort of out of my hands and it has its reputation, so what can you do about it? There's a lot of it that <b>I</b> wish <b>was</b> {{slightly}} more elegantly written. Overall, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> shocked. It <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> good writing for someone who <b>was</b> 19. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> surprised by the level of writing." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{story behind}} this from my Dad's (Stan Levey) {{point of view}} is that {{everything}} was done in one take no 2nd takes no over dubbing. He had spent the whole day recording for TV, Mission Impossible Mannix etc. So he thought a date with Stan Getz this should <b>be</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>laid</b> back.Well {{nothing could be further from}} the truth he said [...] "The count offs were breath taking but once they got thru BeBop everything settled down" [...] his favorite was Wee Allen's Alley. It was virtually a live real Bebop session, nothing worked out, just play by the seat of your pants or get off the bandstand. Like it or not that was the way it was with Bird and those cats, the real thing no pretense.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Jamie Dornan commented of his character's exit, [...] "It's pretty gruesome, but you know, it's {{a little}} bit cool. Not many people get to die like that... As TV deaths go, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> happy." ...|$|R
60|$|By {{this time}} I {{had succeeded in}} raising myself on my elbow, and, by {{the dim light of}} a hanging lamp somewhere down the passage, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> well able to take stock of my surroundings.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{remains to}} be seen. Of one thing <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>pretty</b> certain--if the {{houseboat}} went anywhere it went down the stream. Only a powerful tug or steamboat could pull such a boat up this mighty river." ...|$|R
60|$|I did so, and {{a moment}} later we <b>were</b> off. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> {{confident}} that Mr. Allen Price had not witnessed my departure, and I hoped he would not find it out for some hours to come.|$|R
6000|$|... "Weel, I did {{not pass}} quite close to them, as I ran up here for my horse on hearin' the news," [...] replied Duncan; [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>pretty</b> sure that <b>I</b> saw her sittin' beside Louise." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{the spring}} I trust <b>I</b> shall <b>be</b> able {{to report to}} you that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> ready to take my Farewells in London. Of this <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>pretty</b> certain: that <b>I</b> never will take them at all, unless with you on your own conditions.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{thought you}} would know the name {{if you were a}} pal of Gates's. I expect he's always talking about me. You see, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> well known in this old place before I had to leave it.' ...|$|R
