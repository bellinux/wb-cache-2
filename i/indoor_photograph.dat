40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} fully {{automated}} 3 D reconstruction and visualization system for architectural scenes (interiors and exteriors). The reconstruction of <b>indoor</b> environments from <b>photographs</b> is particularly challenging due to texture-poor planar surfaces such as uniformly-painted walls. Our system first uses structure-from-motion, multiview stereo, and a stereo algorithm {{specifically designed for}} Manhattan-world scenes (scenes consisting predominantly of piece-wise planar surfaces with dominant directions) to calibrate the cameras and to recover initial 3 D geometry {{in the form of}} oriented points and depth maps. Next, the initial geometry is fused into a 3 D model with a novel depth-map integration algorithm that, again, makes use of Manhattanworld assumptions and produces simplified 3 D models. Finally, the system enables the exploration of reconstructed environments with an interactive, image-based 3 D viewer. We demonstrate results on several challenging datasets, including a 3 D reconstruction and image-based walk-through of an entire floor of a house, the first result of this kind from an automated computer vision system. 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} system similar to Debevec’s Facade [DTM 96] that {{improves}} {{the reconstruction of}} <b>indoor</b> scenes from <b>photographs.</b> With confined spaces it is often impractical to use regular photos as {{the base of the}} reconstruction. Combining pinhole cameras with fisheye shoots or photographs of any kind of reflective, parametrisable body such as light probes eases this problem. We call the later camera setup an omni-camera, because it enables us to acquire as much information as possible from a given viewpoint. Omni-cameras make it possible to reconstruct the geometry of an entire room from just one view. Removing the pinhole camera constraint invalidates some key assumptions made in Facade. This paper shows how to work around the problems arising from this approach by adding scene specific knowledge as well as a genetic component to the solver. When using omni-cameras we can no longer take advantage of a simple texture projection to obtain the materials for the scene. Instead we propose a method for texture generation that is transparent to the camera setup used...|$|R

40|$|The need of {{integrating}} aesthetic aspects into forest management has been stressed both {{in research and}} in practice. The current study aims at finding possible explanations for the public preferences on forest landscapes with special regard to young forests. The study consists of two parts. The first part is a literature review, which is dedicated to systematizing the existing information regarding {{the nature of human}} perception of forest landscapes. The second part presents the results of the survey. Two different methods of surveying public preferences were used. The psychological method was used while surveying people in the field, and the psychophysical method – for the <b>indoor</b> survey using <b>photographs.</b> The statistical treatment of the data was based on correlation analysis, and to some extent on principal component analysis. The study resulted in a set of findings, {{and most of them are}} reliable on the chosen level of significance (p= 0, 05). The results showed that the image of recreational forest differed to a great extent from the image of forest in general. Attractiveness of young forest, i. e. perceived aesthetic beauty, was mostly correlated with sense of easy access and safety. Thus, presence of deadwood, understory and high stand density were the most important factors towards negative attitude about the forest. Single tree characteristics (height, diameter) showed a small but significant positive correlation with aesthetic quality, which contradicts with previous studies, where those variables were the main predictors of the forest scenic beauty. Standing and total volumes had a very small negative relationship with scenic beauty. The results also indicated a correlation between aesthetic and ecological values within the group of respondents, who were not educated in forest ecology. This finding suggests about the influence of good-looking appearance of forest on the overall public attitude towards sustainability of forest management practices...|$|R
