5|$|The lightest {{isotopes}} were synthesized {{by direct}} fusion between two lighter nuclei and as decay products. The heaviest isotope produced by direct fusion is 262Rf; heavier isotopes {{have only been}} observed as decay products of elements with larger atomic numbers, of which only 267Rf has been confirmed. The heavy isotopes 266Rf and 268Rf have also been observed as electron capture daughters of the dubnium isotopes 266Db and 268Db, but have short half-lives to spontaneous fission: <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{same is true of}} 270Rf, a likely daughter of 270Db. While the isotope 264Rf has yet to be observed, it is predicted to have a short half-life of 5s.|$|E
5|$|The unique {{political}} structures of late Middle Ages Italy have led some to theorize that its unusual social climate allowed {{the emergence of}} a rare cultural efflorescence. Italy did not exist as a political entity in the early modern period. Instead, it was divided into smaller city states and territories: the Kingdom of Naples controlled the south, the Republic of Florence and the Papal States at the center, the Milanese and the Genoese to the north and west respectively, and the Venetians to the east. Fifteenth-century Italy {{was one of the most}} urbanised areas in Europe. Many of its cities stood among the ruins of ancient Roman buildings; <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> classical nature of the Renaissance was linked to its origin in the Roman Empire's heartland.|$|E
5|$|It seems {{relatively}} {{certain that}} the Persian fleet was sent out to block the exit from the Straits the evening before the battle. Herodotus clearly believed that the Persian fleet actually entered the Straits at nightfall, planning to catch the Allies as they fled. However, modern historians have greatly debated this point, with some pointing out the difficulties of maneuvering in this confined space by night, and others accepting Herodotus's version. There are thus two possibilities; that during the night the Persians simply blocked the exit to the Straits, and then entered the straits in daylight; or that they entered the straits and positioned themselves for battle during the night. Regardless of when they attempted it, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Persians pivoted their fleet off the tip of Cape Vavari, so that from an initial east-west alignment (blocking the exit), they came round to a north-south alignment (see diagram). The Persian fleet {{seems to have been}} formed into three ranks of ships (according to Aeschylus); with the powerful Phoenician fleet on the right flank next to Mount Aigaleo, the Ionian contingent on the left flank and the other contingents in the centre.|$|E

25|$|An 1882 history {{suggests}} that the Martin house was built as early as 1730. But records show that all four of Hendrick Martin's children were baptized in Kaatsbaan, the last by 1743, suggesting the family had not moved across the river before that year. In 1751 the deed for the property which includes the house was recorded. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> house was built near the latter end of that period.|$|E
25|$|Ancient authors {{seemed to}} believe, incorrectly, that sling-bullets could {{penetrate}} armour, and that lead projectiles, heated by their {{passage through the}} air, would melt in flight.

In the latter case we may imagine that they were impressed by the degree of deformation suffered by lead sling-bullet after hitting a hard target.|$|E

25|$|Geographically, the {{traditional}} {{distribution of the}} djembe {{is associated with the}} Mali Empire, which dates back to 1230 AD and included parts of the modern-day countries of Guinea, Mali, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Gambia, and Senegal.

25|$|Hanam Sunim {{was in the}} Diamond Mountains, at Jangan Temple by 1922, {{and later}} just outside Seoul at Bongeun Temple in 1926.

25|$|In retrospect, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{electrical}} discharges {{reported by}} Winkler in 1744 were started by CFE from his wire electrode.

Thomson's identification of the electron in 1897, and until after it was understood – from thermal emission and photo-emission work – that electrons could be emitted from inside metals (rather than from surface-adsorbed gas molecules), and that – in the absence of applied fields – electrons escaping from metals had to overcome a work function barrier.|$|E

25|$|Several Bactrian kings {{followed}} after Demetrius' death, and <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{civil wars}} between them {{made it possible}} for Apollodotus I (from c. 180/175 BC) to make himself independent as the first proper Indo-Greek king (who did not rule from Bactria). Large numbers of his coins have been found in India, and he seems to have reigned in Gandhara as well as western Punjab. Apollodotus I was succeeded by or ruled alongside Antimachus II, likely the son of the Bactrian king Antimachus I.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the male}} and female are in the 'T position', the {{pressing}} of the female against the male's body stimulates his release of sperm. Though the exact mechanism of fertilisation has yet to be scientifically documented, from the observations of aquarists who have been successful in breeding Corydoras catfishes, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> female takes the male's sperm through her mouthparts, and directs them through the gills, in a current that carries the sperm to her pelvic fins. At this point, the female releases a single egg (occasionally two), and purses her pelvic fins in order to provide a receptacle for the freshly extruded egg, which is then fertilised.|$|E
25|$|The next {{important}} Indo-Greek {{king was}} Menander (from c. 165/155 BC) {{who has been}} described as the greatest of the Indo-Greek Kings; his coins are found as far as eastern Punjab. Menander seems to have begun a second wave of conquests, and since he already ruled in India, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> easternmost conquests were made by him. Thus from 161 B.C. onwards Menander was the ruler of Punjab until his death in 130 B.C. Menander made Sagala his capital, and after conquering the Punjab region he subsequently made an expedition across northern India and reached the Mauryan capital of Patna. Soon after, Eucratides I king of the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom began warring with the Indo-Greeks in the north western frontier.|$|E
