5|$|Strength-stones {{are used}} in modern times for {{strength}} training, particularly in the martial arts where such practices are known as hojo undō. Special stones are manufactured for this purpose, usually with a wooden <b>handle</b> <b>to</b> aid their manipulation; such stones are also known as chi ishi. It is a common practice in karate, used in solo training to improve stances and upper body strength.|$|E
5|$|The fan crest {{was later}} {{developed}} by cutting out the figure displayed on it, {{to form a}} metal outline; this evolved in the late 13th and early 14th centuries into a three-dimensional sculpture. These were usually made of cloth, leather or paper over a wooden or wire framework, and were typically {{in the form of}} an animal; also popular were wings, horns, human figures, and panaches of feathers. These were probably worn only in tournaments, not battle: not only did they add to the already considerable weight of the helm, they could also have been used by opponents as a <b>handle</b> <b>to</b> pull the wearer's head down.|$|E

25|$|Handle: The handle is {{long enough}} for a two-handed grip and is far enough from the socket to give enough {{leverage}} to wind the paddle up or down. There may be a freely rotating sleeve around the <b>handle</b> <b>to</b> protect the hands from the friction of rough iron against skin.|$|E
25|$|A bolt hold-open device {{locks the}} bolt carrier {{assembly}} open after expending the last cartridge from {{the magazine and}} is released by lifting the bolt catch lever located {{on the left side}} of the receiver. Alternatively, a left-handed shooter may release the bolt by pulling the rubber-coated charging <b>handle</b> <b>to</b> rear a short distance.|$|E
25|$|A circularly {{linked list}} {{may be a}} natural option to {{represent}} arrays that are naturally circular, e.g. the corners of a polygon, a pool of buffers that are used and released in FIFO ("first in, first out") order, or a set of processes that should be time-shared in round-robin order. In these applications, a pointer to any node serves as a <b>handle</b> <b>to</b> the whole list.|$|E

25|$|A {{flushometer}}, or royal flushometer is a {{water pressure}} system that uses an inline <b>handle</b> <b>to</b> flush toilets and urinals. By using pressurized water {{directly from the}} supply line, there is a faster recycle time between flushes. The flushometer is still in use today in homes and public restrooms around the world. The flushometer was invented in 1906 by American businessman and inventor William Elvis Sloan.|$|E
25|$|A {{folding knife}} connects the blade to the handle through a pivot, {{allowing}} the blade to fold into the <b>handle.</b> <b>To</b> prevent {{injury to the}} knife user through the blade accidentally closing on the user's hand, folding knives typically have a locking mechanism. Different locking mechanisms are favored by various individuals for reasons such as perceived strength (lock safety), legality, and ease of use.|$|E
25|$|Frame Lock – Also {{known as}} the {{integral}} lock or monolock, this locking mechanism was invented by custom knifemaker Chris Reeve for the Sebenza as an update to the liner lock. The frame lock works {{in a manner similar}} to the liner lock but uses a partial cutout of the actual knife handle, rather than a separate liner inside the <b>handle</b> <b>to</b> hold the blade in place.|$|E

25|$|Standard compound-action snips are {{designed}} for cutting steel or softer materials, although the occasional use on stainless steel is not detrimental. For cutting through tougher materials, such as inconel and titanium, special hard snips are available. They are similar in design to standard or offset aviation snips but have specially heat treated blades. These snips will have a different color <b>handle</b> <b>to</b> differentiate them from the other standard types.|$|E
25|$|A {{powerhead}} or bang stick is {{a device}} which fires a firearms cartridge or blank cartridge {{in contact with}} the target, and relies primarily on the muzzle blast to kill the target. Powerheads are often attached to spears used for spear fishing, or attached to a <b>handle</b> <b>to</b> make a bang stick, which is thrust (while still held) at the target. Bang sticks are often carried for defense against shark attack, but are legally required for alligator hunting in some areas.|$|E
25|$|Originally, in Windows 9x, DirectShow {{used the}} Video Renderer filter. This drew the images using DirectDraw 3, but could also fall back to GDI or overlay drawing modes in some {{circumstances}} (depending upon the visibility of the video window and the video card's capabilities). It had limited access to the video window. Video for Windows had been plagued with deadlocks caused by applications' incorrect handling of the video windows, so in early DirectShow releases, the <b>handle</b> <b>to</b> the playback window was hidden from applications. There was also no reliable way to draw caption text or graphics {{on top of the}} video.|$|E

25|$|Rock Band 3 {{introduced}} keyboard {{parts for}} songs {{for the first}} time in a rhythm game. MadCatz produced the new keyboard controller for the official release which resembles a keytar with a <b>handle</b> <b>to</b> one side; this allows it to be either worn using a guitar strap or placed on a horizontal surface. The keyboard features 25 full-sized velocity-sensitive keys, and is MIDI compatible, allowing it to be used outside the game. For instance, Freezepop, a band which has close ties to members of Harmonix, has used the keyboard controller as a keytar for their stage shows.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the 1980s, {{question}} marks formed a constant motif, usually on the shirt collars or, {{in the case}} of the Seventh Doctor, on his sleeveless jumper and the <b>handle</b> <b>to</b> his umbrella. The idea was grounded in branding considerations, as was the movement starting in Tom Baker's final season toward an unchanging costume for each Doctor, rather than the variants on a theme employed over the first seventeen years of the programme. When the Eighth Doctor regenerated, he clad himself in a 19th-century frock coat and shirt based on a Wild Bill Hickok costume, reminiscent of the out-of-time quality of earlier Doctors and emphasising the Eighth Doctor's more Romantic persona.|$|E
25|$|Class B trains {{were built}} between 1981 and 1994 {{to provide more}} stock to service the growing network in the 1980s. As with the class A trains, six prototypes were ordered. However, it took six years until the series {{production}} started and the prototypes had to be modified to match the series-production units. B units have {{the same size as}} A units but differ in the design (especially of the front window) and use three-phase current instead of direct current motors. The other difference is the door opening mechanism. On B units, the passengers only need to pull just one <b>handle</b> <b>to</b> open both doors rather than both handles as on A units. Of a total of 63 units, 57 are still in service (including one prototype), and six have been scrapped.|$|E

25|$|A reverse sweep is a crossbatted sweep shot {{played in}} the {{opposite}} direction to the standard sweep, thus instead of sweeping the ball to the leg side, it is swept to the off side, towards backward point or third man. The batsman may also swap his hands on the bat <b>handle</b> <b>to</b> make the stroke easier to execute. The batsman may also bring his back foot to the front therefore making it more like a traditional sweep. The advantage of a reverse sweep is that it effectively reverses the fielding positions and thus is very difficult to set a field to. It is also a risky shot for the batsman as it increases the chance of LBW and also is quite easy to top edge to a fielder.|$|E
25|$|The MacAdam shield-shovel {{resembled the}} {{standard}} portable infantry spade of its day in both size and shape. In {{order to stop}} or deflect enemy fire, thicker steel {{was used in the}} construction of the blade; it measured at three-sixteenths of an inch thick. Heavy steel was also used to make the shovel's detachable handle which measured four feet in length. Unique to the shield-shovel was the inclusion of a 3.5 by 2 inch sight-hole in the blade. The shovel was intended to be used as a shield by folding the <b>handle</b> <b>to</b> ~90° toward the concave side of the blade, exposing the spike that ran along the handle opposite the blade. The spike would then be driven into the ground, resulting in the blade standing vertically and the handle resting on the ground behind it as a brace.|$|E
25|$|The fourth {{match was}} a Double Dog Collar match between The Nasty Boys (Brian Knobs and Jerry Sags) and Public Enemy (Rocco Rock and Johnny Grunge). Rock was {{connected}} to Sags, and Grunge {{was connected to}} Knobs. All four fought to the outside, and used several weapons on each other. Grunge performed a bulldog on Knobs on a steel chair. Rock performed a somersault legdrop on Sags and performed an axe <b>handle</b> <b>to</b> him through a table. All four eventually return to the ring, where The Public Enemy had the advantage. Rock went to the top turnbuckle, but Sags pulled the chain, and Rock fell onto the table. Knobs repeatedly attacked Grunge with the chain. Sags then hit an axe handle with the chain on Rock, who was on a table. Knobs hanged Grunge with the chain over the top rope as The Nasty Boys delivered a clothesline to Rock with the chain. Sags hit Rock with the chain, and pinned him for The Nasty Boys to win.|$|E
