50|$|Linseed oil, {{also known}} as {{flaxseed}} oil or flax oil, is a colourless to yellowish oil obtained from the dried, ripened seeds of the flax plant (Linum usitatissimum). The oil is obtained by pressing, sometimes followed by solvent extraction. Linseed oil is a drying oil, meaning it can polymerize into a solid form. Due to its polymer-forming properties, linseed oil {{can be used on}} its own or blended with combinations of other oils, resins or solvents as an <b>impregnator,</b> drying oil finish or varnish in wood finishing, as a pigment binder in oil paints, as a plasticizer and hardener in putty, and in the manufacture of linoleum. Linseed oil use has declined {{over the past several decades}} with increased availability of synthetic alkyd resins—which function similarly but resist yellowing.|$|E

The 50  vol% C 2 H 5 OH in H 2 O solution {{was used as an}} <b>impregnator</b> to overcome the hydrophobic properties of powdery coal. The moisture capacitance of the dried coal samples (in mL/g) was determined prior to the impregnation procedure.|$|E
40|$|The primary aim of {{the work}} {{reported}} in this thesis was to develop an environmentally friendly pultrusion technique {{for the production of}} the fibre reinforced composites. The resin bath used in the conventional pultrusion was replaced with two custom-designed resin <b>impregnators</b> (prototypes-I and prototypes-II). The primary aspect of the resin <b>impregnators</b> was to reduce the time for through-thickness impregnation by spreading the fibre bundles. Two rigs were designed and evaluated to spread the rovings: an automated fibre spreading rig and a serpentine fibre spreading unit. The serpentine fibre spreading unit was seen to give the best results. In a separate set of experiments it was shown that the through-thickness impregnation of the fibre bundles was improved by spreading. The composites were produced using the resin <b>impregnators</b> (prototypes-I and prototypes-II) at three pultrusion speeds. Reference samples were also obtained from dip-type resin bath. The physical and mechanical properties of the pultruded composites were compared. It was shown that the properties of the composites were enhanced whilst using “Clean” pultrusion as compared to the conventional resin-bath system. In conclusion it was shown that the “Clean” pultrusion could be used {{as an alternative to the}} conventional resin bath pultrusion. ...|$|R
5000|$|Natural {{stone is}} one of the most {{commonly}} used materials in countertops. Natural stone or dimension stone slabs (e.g. granite) are shaped using cutting and finishing equipment in the shop of the fabricator. The edges are commonly put on by hand-held routers, grinders, or CNC equipment. If the stone has a highly variegated pattern, the stone may be laid out in final position in the shop for the customer's inspection, or the stone slabs may be selected by experienced inspectors. Emerging technology allows for virtual stone placement on a computer. Exact photographs can now be taken which allow for the integration of a dxf file to lay on top of a stone image. Multiple slabs of material may be used in this layout process. Then the countertop assembly is installed on the job site by professionals.Commonly, initial countertop fabrication takes place at or near the quarry of origin, with blocks being sawn to thickness and then machined into standard widths (600mm and upwards), before being surface polished and edged.This method removes the need to ship waste material, and reduces the time needed to prepare client orders. This practice is called [...] "cut to size"A wide range of details may be pre-machined by the fabricator, allowing for installation of different sinks and cooker designs. A common drawback to natural stone is the need for sealing to prevent harboring of bacteria and/or fluids that may cause staining. In recent years oleophobic <b>impregnators</b> have been introduced as an alternative to surface sealers. With the advent of <b>impregnators</b> the frequency of sealing has been cut down to once every five to ten years on most materials.|$|R

40|$|A {{pultrusion}} machine {{employing a}} corrugated <b>impregnator</b> vessel to immerse multiple, continuous strand, fiber tow in an impregnating material, and an adjustable metered exit orifice for the <b>impregnator</b> vessel {{to control the}} quantity of impregnating material retained by the impregnated fibers, is provided. An adjustable height insert retains transverse rod elements within each depression of the corrugated vessel to maintain the individual fiber tows spread and {{in contact with the}} vessel bottom. A series of elongated heating dies, transversely disposed on the pultrusion machine and having flat heating surfaces with radiused edges, ensure adequate temperature exposed dwell time and exert adequate pressure on the impregnated fiber tows, to provide the desired thickness and fiber/resin ratio in the prepreg formed. The prepreg passing through the pulling mechanism is wound on a suitable take-up spool for subsequent use. A formula is derived for determining the cross sectional area opening of the metering device. A modification in the heating die system employs a heated nip roller in lieu of one of the pressure applying flat dies...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} an environmentally-friendly {{pultrusion}} technique {{for the production}} of fibre-reinforced composites, termed as “clean pultrusion”. In this new manufacturing technique, the resin bath used in the conventional pultrusion was replaced with a custom-built resin <b>impregnator.</b> The resin <b>impregnator</b> was designed and built to impregnate the rovings using a combination of pin, injection and capillary-based impregnation. An integral aspect of the clean pultrusion process was spreading of the filaments in the rovings, via mechanical means, prior to impregnation. An automated fibre spreading rig was designed and built based on “tension-release” process. The rig-design was optimised using Taguchi method. The physical, mechanical and thermo-mechanical properties of the composites pultruded using the clean and conventional techniques were compared. It was found that the composites manufactured using the clean pultrusion exhibited lower void and better mechanical properties. A life cycle assessment (LCA) was also performed to compare the environmental impact of the clean and conventional pultrusion processes. The LCA demonstrated conclusively that the clean pultrusion technique offers several environmental advantages over the conventional resin-bath pultrusion. The new pultrusion technique was demonstrated as being a viable method to pultrude composites without using a resin bath. ...|$|E
40|$|The best-known {{silvering}} {{methods are}} less successful with invertebrate than with vertebrate central nervous tissue. They {{fall into two}} classes with conflicting merits. In the first, metallic impregnation is assisted by accessory chemical agents, and sub-sequent development deposits only limited silver derived from the impregnating bath; in the second, impregnation is in a simple silver nitrate solution, and the development is physical, the silver deriving from the developer. The {{most important part of}} the first process is impregnation, development adding relatively little; impregnation is comparatively slight in the second process, which relies much more on development. If an impregnation of the first type is followed by physical development, the results have the advantages of both methods. The final picture is as good as that produced by the classic methods, and the reliability of the result greatly increased; the method is successful with a variety of difficult invertebrate material. A method is described, using Blest's modification of Holmes's <b>impregnator</b> (class I) and Samuel's physical developer (class II). The effects of temperature, pH, and duration of impregnation are described and related to the needs of different tissues. Increases in both tempera-ture over the range 300 to 700 C and pH from 7 - 0 to 9 - 0 have similar and summating effects: increase in intensity of axon staining, increase in background staining, and decrease in fibre specificity...|$|E
40|$|Legislation in the {{automotive}} industry currently focusses on tailpipe CO 2 emissions, with no consideration for the CO 2 footprint of the materials used {{in the manufacture of}} vehicles. This has led OEMs to adopt lower density materials, to contribute to weight reduction and fuel economy, in the expectation that the weight reduction will provide a net CO 2 benefit to society. This paper will present the results of a full assessment of the energy and CO 2 impact during the manufacture of diesel and petrol engine blocks. The research is based on inputs from over 100 world experts from across {{the automotive}} supply chain, including raw material mining and smelting companies, alloy recyclers, iron and aluminium foundries, OEM engineers, independent manufacturing specialists, design consultants, heat treaters and <b>impregnators.</b> Despite current perceived wisdom, the use of lower density materials frequently results in net energy and CO 2 penalties, when considering the complete life cycle of manufacture and use. For the 1. 6 litre engine block investigated in this study, more than 200, 000 km of on-the-road driving is required to compensate for the up-front energy consumption and CO 2 emissions associated with the production of aluminium engine blocks. The paper also comments on other environmental impacts from the iron and aluminium manufacturing routes. These results provide new insights for OEM decision-makers, and a new perspective for legislators to define regulations that truly contribute to the environment and to society...|$|R
40|$|High water {{absorption}} of recycled brick aggregate (RBA) {{is one of}} the most discussed parameters in terms of its application in the production of concrete—its influence on the amount of mixing water and, hence, the quality of the concrete, is usually considered negative. In this paper, different methods of decreasing the absorption of RBA and, consequently, the impact on the properties of concrete, are described. The RBA has been treated to decrease the {{water absorption}} capacity by impregnation approach using specific <b>impregnators.</b> Afterwards, the RBA samples have been dried at two different temperatures in the laboratory oven— 20 and 90 °C. Concretes using 4 / 8 fraction of the treated RBA instead of natural aggregate (NA) have been mixed and tested. The effectiveness of the RBA treatments have been evaluated on the basis of their influence on the properties of the hardened concrete; by means of the following tests: flexural strength, compressive strength, capillarity, total water absorption capacity, depth of water penetration under pressure, and frost resistance. The method of ranking by ordinal scale has been used as it is suitable for the comparison of a large set of results, while results have been analyzed in terms of the most important technological parameter that influences the quality of the concrete-effective water content. Out of all the tested surface-treatments of RBA, treatment by sodium water glass has the best potential for reduction of the water/cement (w/c) ratio. When the effective w/c ratio is kept within standard limits, concretes containing treated RBA are possible to be specified for various exposure classes and manufacturing in practice. The experiment confirms that at a constant amount of mixing water, with decreasing water absorption of RBA, the effective amount of water in the concrete increases and, hence, the final properties of the concrete decrease (get worse). As the water absorption of the RBA declines, there is a potential for the reduction of the w/c ratio and improvement in the quality of the concrete...|$|R
40|$|The first {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to find out reliable laboratory methods to predict the effect of enzymes on specific energy consumption and fiber properties of TMP pulp. The second one was to find with interactive software called “Knowledge discovery in databases” enzymes or other additives that can be used in finding a solution to reduce energy consumption of TMP pulp. The chemical composition of wood and enzymes, which have activity on main wood components were presented in the literature part of the work. The results of previous research in energy reduction of TMP process with enzymes were also highlighted. The main principles of knowledge discovery have been included in literature part too. The experimental part of the work contains the methods description in which the standard size chip, crushed chip and fiberized spruce chip (fiberized pulp) were used. Different types of enzymatic treatment with different dosages and time were tested during the experiments and showed. Pectinase, endoglucanase and mixture of enzymes were used for evaluation of method reliability. The fines content and fiber length of pulp was measured and used as evidence of enzymes' effect. The refining method with “Bauer” laboratory disc refiner was evaluated as not highly reliable. It was not able to provide high repeatability of results, because of uncontrolled feeding capacity and refining consistency. The refining method with Valley refiner did not have a lot of variables and showed stable and repeatable results in energy saving. The results of experiments showed that efficient enzymes impregnation is probably the main target with enzymes application for energy saving. During the work the fiberized pulp showed high accessibility to enzymatic treatment and liquid penetration without special impregnating equipment. The reason was that fiberized pulp has larger wood surface area and thereby the contact area between the enzymatic solution and wood is also larger. Standard size chip and crushed chip treatment without special <b>impregnator</b> of enzymatic solution was evaluated as not efficient and did not show visible, repeatable results in energy consumption decrease. Thereby it was concluded that using of fiberized pulp and Valley refiner for measurements of enzymes' effectiveness in SEC decrease is more suitable than normal size chip and crushed chip with “Bauer” refiner. Endoglucanase with 5 kg/t dosage showed about 20 % energy consumption decrease. Mixture of enzymes with 1. 5 kg/t dosage showed about 15 % decrease of energy consumption during the refining. Pectinase at different dosages and treatment times did not show significant effect on energy consumption. Results of knowledge discovery in databases showed the xylanase, cellulase and pectinase blend as most promising for energy reduction in TMP process. Surfactants were determined as effective additives for energy saving with enzymes...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanical}} pulping {{industry has}} been developing throughout the years, due to competitive prices in the electricity market and good accessibility of wood. This {{has made it possible}} for such and “expensive” process to further develop. Today, with increasing electricity prizes, it is of great interest to reduce electrical consumption in mechanical pulping industry, since the process consumes large amounts of electricity. Braviken paper mill is starting up a new thermomechanical pulping line, scheduled for start-up in August 2008, which aims to reduce electrical consumption. The new line will include chip pre-treatment equipment such as an <b>impregnator,</b> an Andrtiz Impressafiner (Screw press), a high intensity primary stage refines double disc (DD), and a new low consistency refiner (LC), significantly bigger than those earlier available on the market. This master´s thesis is one out of three Master´s thesis made at Braviken paper mill during spring 2008. They all are connected, and are investigating the possibility to reduce electric energy consumption within TMP production. Master´s thesis concerning high consistency refining was done by Dino Muhic, “High consistency refining of mechanical pulps during varying refining conditions”, and low consistency refining written by Fredrik Johansson “Increased energy efficiency in low consistency refining”. Chip pre-treatment is to be used to reduce electrical consumption. Mechanical pre-treatment, such as using an Andrtiz Impressafiner demolishes the chips while also making it possible to impregnate the chips with chemicals, the later giving additional possibilities to reduce electricity consumption. Chemical chip pre-treatment decreases the lignin softening temperature, which benefits the refining process, yielding longer and less damaged fibers that will create a fibrous pulp with reduced electrical energy input. The goal for {{this study was to investigate}} the effect of alkaline-peroxide on chip pre-treatment by using a design of experiment method, in terms of electric energy consumption for the process, strength properties, opacity and ISO-brightness within the pulp/sheets. The trials were built up as a factorial experiment, with two factors, alkaline and peroxide, with two levels each (high and low). The high level for alkaline was 15 kg/t and 10 kg/t for the low level, and the high level for peroxide was 10 kg/t and 5 kg/t for the low level. This resulted in four trials with two zero-points, and two reference pulps, one normal TMP, thermomechanical pulp, and the other TMP with pressafiner and water. The trials showed that adding alkaline-peroxide clearly had an impact on pulp properties, such as increased strength properties, fiber length improvements and less shives could be found in the alkaline-peroxide treated pulps. The yield was highest for the normal TMP, about 99 % and it decreased with increasing alkaline addition, the lowest value was achieved for the pulps containing the highest dose of alkaline, about 95 %. The optical properties were more or less as expected. Opacity had the highest value for the pulps that had been made from chips with the highest total alkaline level. The ISO brightness was highest for pulps containing low level of alkaline. It could not be decided if the electricity demand had been reduced for the chemically treated pulps; it actually had the opposite effect as expected. The chemically treated pulps demanded a higher SEC, specific energy consumption, compared to the reference pulps. This result could have depended on the small pilot plant high consistency refiners at CTP, Centre technique du papier, Grenoble, France, due to the plate size and what kind of plats that were used. To do trials like this and to be able to draw correct conclusions relevant for a full scale plant, bigger refiners might give a more comparable result. It was clear that the fiber properties had improved, which could be the key to reduce electricity when LE- (low-energy) plates are used in the HC-refiner. A higher intensity could be used and electricity energy could be saved...|$|E
40|$|Specifics of {{technology}} of prepregs obtaining, namely, semi-finished composite materials which contain a predetermined amount of fibrous filler and a polymer matrix are analyzed. It was studied {{that they are}} obtained from impregnation {{in such a way}} that the most of the physical-chemical properties of the reinforcing material are realized, and to provide specified physical and mechanical performance properties. The main fields of the prepregs application, including aviation, space, nuclear industry, pipeline transportation, construction, wind energy, medicine, sports industry etc. are described. It is shown that provision of certain content of the polymer matrix in the impregnated filler is not less important than its uniform distribution over the cross section and length of the filler. This can be achieved by precise wringing of filler that is saturated with impregnating solution. However, the achieved effect of wringing is limited by forcing node capabilities on the one hand, and on the other ? by saturation of filler. It is shown that the required content of the polymer binder in the fibrous fillers can also be provided by precise control of the viscosity (by varying of solvent content) of impregnating solution in combination with a certain speed of passage of the filler through the <b>impregnator</b> (by varying a speed of drawing through). It is ascertained that in the technological processes of impregnation and drying of the fabric viscosity and amount of applied polymeric binder, the strength of the fabric tension, the temperature and duration of drying, the amount of volatiles and other parameters are tightly controlled. It is noted that in the technology of production of prepregs a key part is impregnation-drying lines. In this case, vertical type of impregnation and drying equipment, in contrast to the impregnation and drying equipment of horizontal type, allows to save production area considerably, which is an important factor. It is shown that not less important is the achievement of power saving of basic prepregs preparation process, namely, impregnation, for example by integrated using of ultrasonic. Constructive and technological features of modern impregnation-drying equipment designed to obtain prepregs by domestic, Russian, European and Chinese manufacturers are analyzed. It is established that the modern drying and impregnating lines are large and technically complex engineering systems, which are provided with modern means of automatic control, safety, etc. Therefore, these lines require entirely different technological approach to impregnation and subsequent drying of impregnated glass cloth. It is stated that the basic requirements for the operation of these lines come to the need for provision of a continuous impregnation line operation when changing a roll, to the significant reduction in the amount of volatile solvents in the impregnation composition and the continuous monitoring of the content up to explosive concentrations of solvent vapor-air mixtures in the drying cell, and to the use of polymeric binders ensuring efficient drying modes at high speeds of impregnated filler movement in the drying chamber. Based on the analysis of available information it is shown that the aerodynamic heating method and coolant circulation in the drying zones distinguishes domestic impregnation machine MPT- 3 advantageously from a number of foreign counterparts, where in a similar role synthetic oil is used, providing it with a high efficiency. Besides that, the drying chamber of impregnation machine MPT- 3 M consist of two rotary heat generators which provide independent heating and maintaining of the desired temperature of the coolant in each of the drying zones. Thus the two drying zones are used to dry the impregnated fabric, and the third (middle) zone is used for pre-drying of the fabric prior to its impregnation, thereby it is conducive for the better impregnation. The spheres of integrated using of ultrasonic for achieving energy-saving by basic technological process of prepregs producing, namely impregnation, were proposed. The developed results of ultrasonic technological bases can be used for determination of energy efficient modes and structural and technological parameters of produced in the present impregnation-drying machines. Along with that, according to the developed principles the energy savings is achieved through the actions of cumulative factors. Among them are improvement of the homogenization of the polymer matrix by ultrasonic, ultrasonic activation of the surface of the fibrous fillers for improvement of their wettability by the polymer binder, degassing of structure of fibrous filler right before impregnation, increase of the productivity of the process of impregnation and dosed application of the polymer binder by increasing the speed of a fiber-fill drawing, and a significant reduction of total time of preparation of prepregs along with improvement of properties of the final cured resin composite material...|$|E
