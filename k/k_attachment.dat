40|$|Using {{a series}} of fusion {{proteins}} that span {{almost all of the}} thrombospondin- 1 (TSP- 1) molecule, we observed in this study that Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) K 1 cells strongly attached to the N-terminus but not to the other domains of TSP- 1 (e. g. the C-terminus, and type 1, type 2 and type 3 repeats). In addition, attachment to the N-terminus of CHO S 745 cells defective in cell-surface glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) was decreased by 47 % compared with that observed with CHO K 1 cells, indicating the presence of GAG-dependent cell adhesive sites. With the aim of identifying these cell adhesive sites, {{a series of}} synthetic peptides, overlapping heparin-binding sequences ARKGSGRR (residues 22 - 29), MKKTRG (residues 79 - 84) and TRDLASIARLRIAKGVNDNF (residues 170 - 189), were synthesized and tested for their ability to support CHO cell attachment. Using both centrifugation and cell-attachment assays, MKKTRG-containing peptides promoted CHO K 1 cell adhesion, while ARKGSGRR-containing peptides and peptide TRDLASIARLRIAKGVNDNF did not. CHO S 745 cell attachment to MKKTRG-containing peptides was partially decreased. A 36 % decrease in CHO <b>K</b> 1 cell <b>attachment</b> to the N-terminus was also observed when the heparin-binding consensus sequence KKTR was mutated to QNTR. In addition, peptide MKKTRG partially inhibited (25 % inhibition) CHO <b>K</b> 1 cell <b>attachment</b> to the N-terminus. However, peptide MKKTRG was not sufficient to fully promote cell attachment to the N-terminus of TSP- 1. Peptides VDAVRTEKGFLLLASLRQ and TLLALERKDHS also supported CHO <b>K</b> 1 cell <b>attachment</b> in a GAG-dependent and -independent manner respectively. Moreover, CHO <b>K</b> 1 cell <b>attachment</b> to MKKTRG was found to be markedly enhanced when flanked with the sequences VDAVRTEKGFLLLASLRQ and TLLALERKDHS. Peptide VDAVRTEKGFLLLASLRQMKKTRG nearly abolished (98 % inhibition) CHO <b>K</b> 1 cell <b>attachment</b> to the N-terminus, while peptides MKKTRG, MKKTRGTLLALERKDHS and VDAVRTEKGFLLLASLRQ had only a moderate inhibitory effect (25, 27 and 53 % inhibition respectively). These data indicate that the sequence VDAVRTEKGFLLLASLRQMKKTRGTLLALERKDHS (residues 60 - 94) constitutes a GAG-dependent cell adhesive site in the N-terminus of TSP- 1. Moreover, a GAG-independent site, encompassing residues 189 - 200 (FQGVLQNVRFVF), has been identified. These two adhesive sites supported the attachment {{of a wide variety of}} cells (human breast carcinoma, melanoma and osteosarcoma cells), and a high degree of sequence homology was found between TSP- 1 and TSP- 2 between residues 60 and 94 (48 % identity) and 189 - 200 (67 % identity), further suggesting the functional importance of these two cell adhesive sites in the N-terminus of TSP- 1...|$|R

40|$|We have {{examined}} the interactions between various radiolabeled membrane fractions obtained from an enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli strain and brush borders isolated from porcine intestinal epithelial cells. Outer membrane fragments containing the <b>K</b> 88 <b>attachment</b> factor bound tightly to brush borders, whereas cytoplasmic membrane vesicles did not. Three different types of outer membrane preparations were tested: (i) cellular outer membranes isolated from lysozyme spheroplasts, (ii) medium vesicles or outer membrane fragments released into the medium during growth, and (iii) periplasmic vesicles, or outer membrane fragments which were released from the cells during spheroplast formation and were therefore isolated in the periplasmic fraction. Of these fractions, which were heterogeneous, {{it was always the}} outer membrane subfraction which bound tightly to brush borders. This binding, which was K 88 dependent, may have some physiological significance in view of the association between outer membrane fragments and enterotoxin. Thus, released outer membrane fragments equipped with attachment factors may function as enterotoxin carriers which increase the efficiency with which enterotoxin can be delivered to intestinal epithelial cells...|$|R
40|$|The {{organizational}} {{development of}} growing random networks is investigated. These growing networks are built by adding nodes successively and linking each {{to an earlier}} node of degree <b>k</b> with <b>attachment</b> probability A_k. When A_k grows slower than linearly with k, the number of nodes with k links, N_k(t), decays faster than a power-law in k, while for A_k growing faster than linearly in k, a single node emerges which connects to nearly all other nodes. When A_k is asymptotically linear, N_k(t) tk^{-nu}, with nu dependent on details of the attachment probability, but in the range 2 <nu<infty. The combined age and degree distribution of nodes shows that old nodes typically have a large degree. There is also a significant correlation in the degrees of neighboring nodes, so that nodes of similar degree {{are more likely to}} be connected. The size distributions of the in-components and out-components of the network with respect to a given node [...] namely, its "descendants" and "ancestors" [...] are also determined. The in-component exhibits a robust s^{- 2 } power-law tail, where s is the component size. The out component has a typical size of order ln t and it provides basic insights about the genealogy of the network.

However, Mps 1 ’s error correction-relevant substrates are unknown. Using a chemically tuned kinetochore-targeting assay, we show that Mps 1 destabilizes microtubule <b>attachments</b> (<b>K</b> fibers) epistatically to Aurora B, the other major error-correcting kinase. Through quantitative proteomics, we identify multiple sites of Mps 1 -regulated phosphorylation at the outer kinetochore. Substrate modification was microtubule sensitive and opposed by PP 2 A-B 56 phosphatases that stabilize chromosome-spindle attachment. Consistently, Mps 1 inhibition rescued K-fiber stability after depleting PP 2 A-B 56. We also identify the Ska complex as a key effector of Mps 1 at the kinetochore-microtubule interface, as mutations that mimic constitutive phosphorylation destabilized K fibers in vivo and reduced the efficiency of the Ska complex’s conversion from lattice diffusion to end-coupled microtubule binding in vitro. Our results reveal how Mps 1 dynamically modifies kinetochores to correct improper attachments and ensure faithful chromosome segregation...|$|R
40|$|Klebsiella pneumoniae is an {{important}} cause of nosocomial infections, primarily through the formation of surface-associated biofilms to promote microbial colonization on host tissues. Expression of type 3 fimbriae by K. pneumoniae facilitates surface adherence, a process strongly activated by the cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP) -dependent transcriptional activator MrkH. In this study, we demonstrated the critical importance of MrkH in facilitating <b>K.</b> pneumoniae <b>attachment</b> {{on a variety of}} medically rele-vant materials and demonstrated the mechanism by which bacteria activate expression of type 3 fimbriae to colonize these mate-rials. Sequence analysis revealed a putative MrkH recognition DNA sequence (“MrkH box”; TATCAA) located in the regulatory region of themrkHI operon. Mutational analysis, electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and quantitative PCR experiments dem-onstrated that MrkH binds to the cognate DNA sequence to autoregulatemrkHI expression in a c-di-GMP-dependent manner. A half-turn deletion, but not a full-turn deletion, between theMrkH box and the 35 promoter element renderedMrkH ineffec-tive in activatingmrkHI expression, implying that a direct interaction betweenMrkH and RNA polymerase exists. In vivo analy-ses showed that residues L 260, R 265, N 268, C 269, E 273, and I 275 in the C-terminal domain of the RNA polymerase subunit are involved in the positive control ofmrkHI expression byMrkH and revealed the regions of MrkH required for DNA binding and transcriptional activation. Taken together, the data suggest a model whereby c-di-GMP-dependent MrkH recruits RNA polymer-ase to themrkHI promoter to autoactivatemrkH expression. IncreasedMrkH production subsequently drivesmrkABCDF ex-pression when activated by c-di-GMP, leading to biosynthesis of type 3 fimbriae and biofilm formation...|$|R
30|$|In situ {{chemical}} polymerization {{is another}} well-studied choice to synthesize PANI/CNT composites [218, 219]. Choi et al. [220] chemically synthesize PANI/MWCNT composite {{in which the}} surface of MWCNT had been thickly decorated by PANI forming covalent <b>attachment.</b> <b>King</b> et al. [221] investigated the influence of carbon nanotube characteristic on the morphology and properties of the chemically synthesized nanohybrids. It was found that despite aniline monomers themselves could result in nanofibrous structures, CNTs were the dominant templates in the polymerization. However, a less ordered and thinner polyaniline coating was observed at the unoxidized CNTs due to the worse water solubility and weaker hydrogen bonding effects with aniline monomers. By comparing the effects of SWCNT and MWCNT, they found that MWCNT-containing composites was less conducting that the SWCNT-based series and composites based on oxidized CNTs were less conducting than that containing unoxidized ones. More recently, Fan et al. [222] reported chemically synthesized carpenterworm-like PANI/CNT nanocomposites in which MWCNTs were covered by interlace PANI nanoprotuberances.

The piliated phase demonstrated {{a significant increase in}} adherence when compared to the nonpiliated phase. Incubation of the bacteria and epithelial cell mixture at 4 and 37 degrees C resulted in no differences in adherence; optimal adherence occurred at pH 5. Pretreatment of the bacteria with enzymes to destroy the pili resulted in a decrease in adherence, as did killing the bacteria by various means before adherence testing. Pretreatment of the epithelial cells with certain saccharides inhibited bacterial adherence. Finally, a 96 % decrease in adherence was observed after coincubation of bacteria and epithelial cells with papain-treated antipili antibodies. Thus, it appears that pili on the surface of <b>K.</b> pneumoniae mediate <b>attachment</b> of the bacteria to rat bladder epithelial cells...|$|R

STUDY DESIGN: Thirty root slices of freshly extracted human teeth of 4 mm thickness as well as six 5 x 5 mm glass slides used as a control were used in this study. The dentin surface of the root slices was not treated with any chemicals to remove the smear layer. The root slices and the glass slides were placed in tissue culture clusters and an amount of 1 ml of HPDL fibroblast cell suspension was placed over the dentin surface of the root slices and the glass slides. They were then placed into an incubator at 37 degrees C and 100 % humidity for 4, 24, and 72 hours. At the end of the incubation, the cells were fixed with glutaraldehyde and examined microscopically. RESULTS: Different shapes of fully spread cells were seen. The cells were attached firmly to the dentin surface by the cytoplasmic extension of the lamellipodia and microvilli which were seen extending inside the opening of the dentinal tubules. CONCLUSION: It was concluded that the human dentin surface provided an excellent surface for attachment of periodontal ligament fibroblasts.

Attachment to CF 3 Br proceeds exclusively by the dissociative channel yielding Br-, with a rate constant increasing from 1. 1 x 10 (- 8) cm(3) s(- 1) at 300 K to 5. 3 x 10 (- 8) cm(3) s(- 1) at 890 K, somewhat lower than previous data at temperatures up to 777 <b>K.</b> CF 3 <b>attachment</b> proceeds through competition between associative attachment yielding CF 3 - and dissociative attachment yielding F-.

The ecological impacts and fate of microplastic debris are only beginning to be revealed, with previous research into these topics having primarily focused on higher organisms and/or pelagic environments. Despite recent research into plastic-associated microorganisms in seawater, the microbial colonization of microplastics in benthic habitats has not been studied. Therefore, we employed a 14 -day microcosm experiment to investigate bacterial colonization of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) microplastics within three types of coastal marine sediment from Spurn Point, Humber Estuary, U. <b>K.</b> RESULTS: Bacterial <b>attachment</b> onto LDPE within sediments was demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy and catalyzed reporter deposition fluorescence in situ hybridisation (CARD-FISH). Log-fold increases in the abundance of 16 S rRNA genes from LDPE-associated bacteria occurred within 7 days with 16 S rRNA gene numbers on LDPE surfaces differing significantly across sediment types, as shown by quantitative PCR. Terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis demonstrated rapid selection of LDPE-associated bacterial assemblages whose structure and composition differed significantly from those in surrounding sediments. Additionally, T-RFLP analysis revealed successional convergence of the LDPE-associated communities from the different sediments over the 14 -day experiment. Sequencing of cloned 16 S rRNA genes demonstrated that these communities were dominated after 14 days by the genera Arcobacter and Colwellia (totalling 84 - 93 % of sequences).

Taken together, the data suggest a model whereby c-di-GMP-dependent MrkH recruits RNA polymerase to the mrkHI promoter to autoactivate mrkH expression. Increased MrkH production subsequently drives mrkABCDF expression when activated by c-di-GMP, leading to biosynthesis of type 3 fimbriae and biofilm formation. IMPORTANCE: Bacterial biofilms can cause persistent infections that are refractory to antimicrobial treatments. This study investigated how a commonly encountered hospital-acquired pathogen, Klebsiella pneumoniae, controls the expression of MrkH, the principal regulator of type 3 fimbriae and biofilm formation. We discovered a regulatory circuit whereby MrkH acts as a c-di-GMP-dependent transcriptional activator of both the gene cluster of type 3 fimbriae and the mrkHI operon. In this positive-feedback loop, whereby MrkH activates its own production, K. pneumoniae has evolved a mechanism to ensure rapid MrkH production, expression of type 3 fimbriae, and subsequent biofilm formation under favorable conditions. Deciphering the molecular mechanisms of biofilm formation by bacterial pathogens is important for the development of innovative treatment strategies for biofilm infections.

The pairs (X,x) are made into the category Ek of spaces with k-fold end structure. Attachments and expansions in Ek are defined by induction on <b>k,</b> where elementary <b>attachments</b> and expansions in E 0 have their usual meaning. The category Ek/Z consists of objects (X, i) where i: Z → X is an inclusion in Ek with an attachment of i(Z) to X, and the category Ek‖Z consists of pairs (X,i) of Ek/Z that admit retractions X → Z. An infinite complex over Z is a sequence X = {X 1 ⊂ X 2 ⊂ … ⊂ Xn …} of inclusions in Ek‖Z. The abelian grou p S 0 (Z) is then defined as the set of equivalence classes of infinite complexes dominated by finite ones, where the equivalence relation is generated by homotopy equivalence and finite attachment; and the abelian group S 1 (Z) {{is defined as the}} set of equivalence classes of X 1, where X ∈ Ek/Z deformation retracts to Z.
