5|$|Robson was {{selected}} {{for the first time}} in her career to be a member of the GB Fed Cup Team to play in the Europe/Africa Group 1 match at Eilat, Israel, on 1–4 February 2012. In the group stages she played doubles with Heather Watson, defeating pairs from Portugal, Netherlands and Israel in the group stages. Robson and Watson did not need to play the play-off match against Austria as Anne Keothavong and Elena Baltacha won their singles rubbers, and the 2–0 lead qualified the team for a place in the World <b>Group</b> <b>II</b> promotion play-off in April 2012.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the year, Robson had reached the top 50 {{for the first time in}} her career. She {{followed}} this with her first victory at the Australian Open with a convincing straight sets victory over Melanie Oudin. In the second round she played former Wimbledon champion, and fellow left-hander, Petra Kvitová. Robson came back after losing the first set to beat Kvitová in a three-hour match, to set up a third-round meeting with Sloane Stephens. After stopping for several shoulder treatments, Robson was eventually beaten in two sets. After the Australian Open, Robson played six matches in Fed Cup competition that saw Great Britain earn a World <b>Group</b> <b>II</b> Play-off spot against Argentina. Following this success she went on to lose two successive matches, losing to Daniela Hantuchová in Doha and to wildcard Yulia Putintseva in Dubai.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Adding novel {{drugs like}} {{pregabalin}} to analgesic regimens might reduce postoperative pain, total opioid consumption and side effects, this study compares multiple doses of pregabalin for postoperative analgesia following radical cystectomy. Methods: This study is registered at www. clinicaltrials. gov at no. : NCT 02724293. Sixty patients were randomized into 4 groups: Group I: control (placebo) group, Group II: received pregabalin 300  mg 2  h preoperatively, Group III: received pregabalin 300  mg 2  h preoperatively and 12  h thereafter, Group IV: received pregabalin 600  mg 2  h preoperatively. Postoperative pain, time to first request of analgesia, and total morphine consumption were recorded. Results: VAS was significantly reduced in <b>groups</b> <b>II,</b> III, IV {{in comparison with}} group I immediately postoperative, and after 2  h (P <  0. 05). Sedation score was significantly higher in <b>groups</b> <b>II,</b> III, IV compared to group I immediately postoperative (P <  0. 05). First request of analgesia was significantly delayed in <b>groups</b> <b>II,</b> III, IV compared to control group (P =  0. 000). Total analgesic consumption was significantly reduced in <b>groups</b> <b>II,</b> III, IV compared to group I (P =  0. 000). Group IV showed a significantly higher incidence of dizziness compared to group I. Conclusion: Peri-operative pregabalin at doses of 300  mg and 600  mg reduced postoperative opioid consumption and prolonged time to first request of analgesia in patients who underwent radical cystectomy, and a single preoperative dose of 600  mg is superior in analgesia to others, without serious side effects...|$|R
