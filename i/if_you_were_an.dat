He said: [...] "It’s kind of funny that the first time I ever really had any sense of the game’s success was about 10 years following the original release of Blaster Master, when a young staff member from the U.S. office said something to me like, 'You’d definitely have become a super famous game designer <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>an</b> American.'" [...] Alex Neuse, creator of the Bit.Trip series, reminisced his memories of playing Blaster Master as a child. He acknowledged that the game was a clone of Metroid that featured a tank that could jump and a corny storyline, but he said it was all [...] "presented {{in a way that it}} felt meaningful". He added that the game's music convinced him [...] "that video game music could be high-quality, memorable, and evocative". 1UP.com listed the game as the 11th best NES game of all time in its [...] "Top 25 NES Games" [...] list; the 1UP.com staff said the game was [...] "an action game that worked like a mishmash of every NES game before it", noting the expansive map like in Metroid. Paste magazine ranked Blaster Master as the 2nd greatest NES game of all time, behind The Legend of Zelda; they cited the tank's additional abilities as a main reason behind its ranking.|$|E

2500|$|Meanwhile, Shermer, who {{considers}} himself {{an admirer of}} Rand, has tempered his judgment. Contrasting Leonard Peikoff's [...] "heavy-hammer approach" [...] with the [...] "big-tent approach" [...] of The Atlas Society, Shermer told Ed Hudgins: [...] "If we're close enough {{on the same page}} about many things, I think it's more useful to cut people some slack, rather than going after them on some smaller points. I don't see the advantage of saying, 'You shouldn't have liked that movie because ultimately, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>an</b> Objectivist, you wouldn't have.' I guess it was those sorts of judgments made by some Objectiv that I objected to." ...|$|E

[...] Wilson has said: [...] "I felt that ... however abominable the decision might be, it was rational that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>an</b> administration and did not want people talking about the intelligence or talking about what underpinned the decision to go to war, you would discourage them by destroying the credibility of the messenger who brought you the message.
