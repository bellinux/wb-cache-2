This study proposed a new method to increase the performance of NDDCT under crosswind conditions by optimizing the hot water mass flow rate in the air-cooled heat exchangers. The 20 m UQ Gatton NDDCT was selected as a case study to test and validate this method. The cooling performance of this cooling tower under crosswind condition was evaluated by the 3 -D CFD model.

Flow through the tubes is normally turbulent, ensuring low concentration polarisation but also increasing energy costs. The tubes can either be self-supporting or supported by insertion into perforated metal tubes. This module design is limited for nanofiltration by the pressure they can withstand before bursting, limiting the maximum flux possible. Due to both the high energy operating costs of turbulent flow and the limiting burst pressure, tubular modules are more suited to ‘dirty’ applications where feeds have particulates such as filtering raw water to gain potable water in the Fyne process.

Mixed convection, i. e. a heat transfer, when the contribution of free and forced convection is comparable, was created {{with the help of}} the exhaust shaft mounted above the <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> <b>bundle</b> and forced air movement was created by the difference in density of the air in the shaft and the environment. The experimental dependence of the heat transfer of finned single row of bundles in the selected ranges of Grashof and Reynolds numbers has been determined. It is demonstrated that heat transfer in the mixed convection is 2. 5 − 3 times higher than in free one and the growth rate of heat transfer with increasing Reynolds number is more than in the forced convection. Different forms of representation of results of experiments were analyzed and it was determined that the Nusselt number has a single power dependence on the Reynolds number at any height of the exhaust shafts. A linear dependence of the Reynolds number on the square root of the Grashof number was determined as well as the proportionality factors for different shaft heights. It is noted that the characteristics of the motion of air particles in the bundle in free convection is identical to the motion of particles in forced convection at small Reynolds numbers, i. e. a free convection flow smoothly flows into a forced convection one without the typical failures or surges if additional driving forces arise. </p...|$|R
40|$|A {{framework}} for {{a method to}} predict fluid-elastic instability in <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> tube <b>bundles</b> is presented. The method relies on a three-dimensional, cylindrical coordinate, thermal-hydraulic analysis code to obtain {{a representation of the}} three-dimensional flow distribution within the <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger.</b> With this information, local cross-flow velocities corresponding to each tube in the exchanger are obtained by interpolation and resultant cross-flow velocity distributions are computed. With a knowledge of the vibration mode shapes and frequencies, reduced effective cross-flow velocities are then computed for each tube. A comparison with experimental results shows excellent agreement: the tubes with high values of predicted reduced effective cross-flow velocity are the same tubes that first experience fluid-elastic instability in the flow tests and vibrate most violently; also, the simulation correctly predicts that the tubes directly exposed to the flow from the inlet nozzle have a low potential for fluid-elastic instability. Very good agreement is also shown in the comparison of the predicted reduced effective cross-flow velocities with the critical value obtained from a design guide. In summary, the feasibility of developing a <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> tube vibration prediction method, based on a computer simulation of flow distribution, is demonstrated.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Coal fired {{power plants}} that {{were built in}} the past four decades are aging. The main aging {{mechanisms}} are creep and thermal fatigue. Creep results from the high temperatures at which the components operate. Thermal fatigue is due to thermal stresses and these stresses result from temperature gradients within the material. Cycling of these thermal stresses accelerate the creep in a process called creep- fatigue aging. The boiler and its final <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> and headers are the main components that are affected by these mechanisms. The aging of these components results in high maintenance costs, reduction of the plant reliability and availability, and contribute to increased safety risks for the plant and personnel. Therefore, {{there is a need to}} understand the steady state and dynamic behaviour of the components of these plants in order to predict the stresses that the material experience. This report discusses an investigation to the possibility of modelling the thermal dynamic behaviour of typical boiler <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> components which have to withstand the highest temperature of a Pulverised Fuel Rankine cycle power plant. Thus, illuminating the issues that need to be addressed in modelling such <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers.</b> Modelling approaches of <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> are systematically presented, starting with the use of exact analytical solutions. This is followed by the application of finite volume numerical method. Finishing off with the use of the Flownex software. The exact analytical solutions are used to characterise the transient temperature distribution in solid materials with simplified heat transfer, highlighting the dependence of the solutions on the Fourier number and Biot number. These solutions are further used to calculate thermal stresses generated in the material, illustrating the relationship between thermal stresses and temperature gradients. Furthermore, a finite volume solution is applied to modelling an infinitely long tube. I t is illustrated that for transient conduction heat transfer problems, the solution depends on both physical space discretisation and time- wise discretisation. The numerical solution is verified against the exact analytical solution. Finally, the Flownex software is used to illustrate the issues that need to be addressed when modelling the transient behaviour of a <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger.</b> For this purpose only the average area discretisation scheme is used since it allows for any generic solid structure to be modelled, provided that the appropriate level of discretization is applied. The Flownex modelling starts by modelling transient conduction heat transfer within an infinitely long tube. The Flownex solution is verified against the finite volume numerical solution. The Flownex solution depends on thickness discretisation, especially for thick cylindrical components. Finite tubes are also modelled on Flownex including axial discretisation and layout simplification of the tubes. Flownex is also used to model a <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> <b>bundle</b> using two methods; a tube by tube method and a method that involves the combination of all ii the tubes into one tube.

The numerical results reproduce the amplitude-limiting and non-linear (lock-in) characteristics of flow-induced vibration. The maximum vibration amplitude {{as well as its}} corresponding lock-in frequency is in good agreement with experimental results. The amplitude of vibration can be as high as 0. 88 D for the case investigated. As vibration amplitude increases, the amplitude of the lift force also increases. With enhancement of vibration amplitude, the vortex pattern in the near wake changes significantly. This fluid-structure interaction model is further applied to simulate flow-induced vibration of two tandem cylinders and two side-by-side cylinders at similar Reynolds number. Promising and reasonable results and predictions are obtained.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an investigation on the effects of wavy cylindrical tubes in a staggered <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> tube <b>bundle.</b> Experimental measurements and large eddy simulation (LES) technique were used to study the turbulent flow characteristics in a staggered tube bundle arrangement at a sub-critical Reynolds number of Re = 7500. The aim of this investigation is to compare the flow characteristics of a new configuration of cylindrical tubes with that of a similar arrangement which comprises purely circular cylinders. The first row of circular tubes is replaced by a row of wavy cylindrical tubes. The result of the experiment shows that the mean velocity distributions and turbulence intensity, obtained by the present LES method, are in good agreement with the Laser Doppler Anemometer (LDA) measurements. The wake patterns around the second row of cylinders become more well organized upon the introduction of wavy cylinders of optimal wavelength (λ/Dm = 6). The turbulent kinetic energy behind the first row of tubes is also reduced. The power density spectra of the vortex shedding in the tube bundle are evidently suppressed. As a result, the fluctuating forces of the tube bundles are weakened. However, the drag is not noticeably reduced by such modification. Department of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|R

The experiments are conducted {{for a range}} of Reynolds numbers from 2000 to 8000, based on the outer cylinders diameter and the air velocity upstream of the cylinder. The analysis of the PIV data shows the important effects of the foam cover and the inlet velocity on the separated structures. The results show a considerable increase in the wake size behind a foam-covered cylinder compared to that of a bare cylinder. Furthermore, the turbulence intensity is found to be around 10 % higher {{in the case of the}} foam-covered cylinder where the wake size is approximately doubled for the former case compared to the latter. The turbulence kinetic energy, however, is found to be less Reynolds dependent in the case of the foam-covered cylinder. In addition, small scale structures contribute to the formation of the flow structures in the foam-covered cylinder making them a more efficient turbulent generator for the next rows when used in a <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> tube <b>bundle.</b> On the other hand, a higher energy level in such separated structures will translate into increased pressure drop compared to bare cylinders.

Calculation models of the construction units in 08 Cr 2 AlMo steel with or without hydrogen were established based on the empirical electronic theory in solid (EET) and valence electron structure of the construction units in this steel was calculated. The results show that hydrogen bond is formed between the hydrogen solved in the steel and other atoms in the steel. The cleavage energy of crystal plane with hydrogen bond is increased and that without hydrogen bond is decreased. Hydrogen results in the remarkable difference of the cleavage energy of different crystal planes and changes the bond distribution in the structure units. The mechanical property of the units has directional properties. In these units, the microcracks propagate along the cleavage plane with small binding energy and so the brittle fracture of the crystal occurs. The elements of Cr, Al, Mo are able to strengthen the basal body without carbon, and have little effect on the plastic nature. In the structure unit with carbon, carbon increases the anisotropy of mechanical property and alloying agents decrease the plastics of the steel further. The alloying agents of Cr and Mo decrease plastic nature loss of the steel due to decrement of the anisotropy of mechanical property in the unit with hydrogen.

The challenge of overcoming the low thermal conductivity of polymers may be met by using many small-diameter, thin-walled polymer tubes and this route is being pursued by industry. We propose the use of unique shaped tubes that are easily extruded using polymeric materials. The shaped tubes are streamlined to reduce form drag yet the inside flow passage is kept circular to maintain the pressure capability of the tube. Special treatment is required to predict convective heat transfer rates because the temperature distribution along the outer surface of the shaped tubes is non-uniform. The average forced convection Nusselt number correlations developed for these non-circular tubes {{can not be used}} directly to determine heat transfer rate. In this paper, heat transfer rates of shaped tubes are characterized by treating the tubes as a base circular tube to which longitudinal fin(s) are added. Numerical solution of an energy balance on the fin provides the surface temperature distribution and a shaped tube efficiency, which can be used {{in the same manner as}} a fin efficiency to determine the outside convective resistance. The approach is illustrated for three streamlined shapes with fins of lenticular and oval profile.

The plate fin <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> are mostly used for the nitrogen liquefiers, so they need to be highly efficient because no liquid nitrogen is produced, if the effectiveness of <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> is less than 87 %. So it becomes necessary to test the effectiveness of these <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> before putting them in to operation...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} a quasi 1 -D code {{that can be}} used for the design and evaluation of <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> operating with ideal fluid, ideal gases and real gases. For a given <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> defined by <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> type, a range of variables defining the geometry of the <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers,</b> selected <b>heat</b> transfer correlations and selected pressure drop correlation the exchanger performance is evaluated. Employing a fixed <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> geometry allows the performance of a given <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> to be evaluated as fluid boundary conditions (massflow, inlet temperature, inlet pressure) change in both heat transfer channels. In the first instance this allows change in <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> performance for a given <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> to be evaluated across a range of operating conditions. Furthermore this can be used to appropriately size a <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> that is required to operate at a number of conditions...|$|R

40|$|Disclosed is an {{interdigitated}} plate-type <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> interface. The interface {{includes a}} modular interconnect to thermally connect a pair or pairs of plate-type <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> {{to a second}} single or multiple plate-type <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger.</b> The modular interconnect comprises a series of parallel, plate-type <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> arranged in pairs to form a slot therebetween. The plate-type <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> of the second <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> insert into the slots of the modular interconnect. Bellows are provided between the pairs of fins of the modular interconnect {{so that when the}} bellows are pressurized, they drive the plate-type <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> of the modular interconnect toward one another, thus closing upon the second <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> plates. Each end of the bellows has a part thereof a thin, membrane diaphragm which readily conforms to the contours of the <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> plates of the modular interconnect when the bellows is pressurized. This ensures an even distribution of pressure on the <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> of the modular interconnect thus creating substantially planar contact between the two <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers.</b> The effect of the interface of the present invention is to provide a dry connection between two <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> whereby the rate of heat transfer can be varied by varying the pressure within the bellows...|$|R
