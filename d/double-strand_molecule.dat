40|$|Identification of the immunogens {{responsible}} {{for the production of}} pathogenic autoantibodies is a major problem in the field of autoimmunity. In the principal diseases that are thought to involve autoimmunization, rheumatoid arthritis, type I diabetes, and multiple sclerosis are examples, the instigating stimulus is unknown. Another example of the gap in our knowledge of disease-causing immunogens can be found in SLE. The characteristic autoantibody of lupus binds to double-strand (ds) DNA yet this nucleic acid antigen is barely immunogenic, even in lupus-prone MRL-lpr/lpr mice (1). Certain bacterial DNAs can elicit anti-dsDNA antibodies in normal mice, but those antibodies and the spontaneously produced anti-DNA antibodies of SLE have different serological specificities (2). By contrast with the poor immunogenicity of mammalian dsDNA, other forms of DNA, such as Z-DNA (a <b>double-strand</b> <b>molecule</b> with a leftward spiraling helix instead of the right-handed helical structure of dsDNA), elicit brisk immune responses in MLR-lpr/lpr mice as well as in normal mice and rabbits (1, 3). The lack of immunogenicity of exogenous dsDNA does not disprove the participation of endogenous DNA in the origins o...|$|E
40|$|Here we use {{classical}} applied mathematical modeling {{to determine}} surface binding energies between both single-strand and double-strand DNA molecules interacting with a graphene sheet. We adopt basic mechanical principles {{to exploit the}} 6 – 12 Lennard-Jones potential function and the continuum approximation, which assumes that intermolecular interactions can be approximated by average atomic line or surface densities. The minimum binding energy occurs when the single-strand DNA molecule is centred 20. 2 Å {{from the surface of}} the graphene and the double-strand DNA molecule is centred 20. 3 Å from the surface, noting that these close values apply for the case when the axis of the helix is perpendicular to the surface of graphene. For the case when the axis of the helix is parallel to the surface, the minimum binding energy occurs when the axis of the single-strand molecule is 8. 3 Å from the surface, and the <b>double-strand</b> <b>molecule</b> has axis 13. 3 Å from the surface. For arbitrary tilted axis, we determine the optimal angles Ω of the axis of the helix, which give the minimum values of the binding energies, and we observe that the optimal angles tend to occur in the intervals Ω ∈ (π / 4,π/ 2) and Ω ∈ (π / 7,π/ 5) for the single and double-strand DNA molecules, respectively.

40|$|In cultured pea roots {{there is}} {{extrachromosomal}} DNA associated with cells that differentiate from the G 2 {{phase of the}} cell cycle that is absent from those that differentiate from the G 1 phase. We examined this extrachromosomal DNA by electron microscopy {{and found that it}} consisted of three types: (i) <b>double-stranded</b> linear <b>molecules</b> with single-stranded branches (74 %), (ii) <b>double-stranded</b> <b>molecules</b> without branches (26 %), and (iii) free single-stranded <b>molecules.</b> The <b>double-stranded</b> <b>molecules</b> with or without branches were similar in length, having a modal length of 10 - 15 μm. The free single-stranded molecules were shorter and had a mean length of 3. 8 μm. The length of the branches attached to the duplex molecules was only slightly less than that of the free form. The duplex molecules with branches were interpreted as configurations reflecting an ongoing strand-displacement process that results in free single-stranded molecules. Finally, measurements on duplex molecules with multiple branches suggested that the extrachromosomal DNA may exist in the form of tandemly repeated sequences...|$|R

40|$|DNA is a {{material}} {{that has the}} potential to be used in nanoelectronic devices as an active component. However, the electron transfer through DNA molecules responsible for its conducting behaviour remains controversial. Here we use a self-consistent quantum molecular dynamics method to study the effect of an applied electric field on electron transfer along single and <b>double-stranded</b> DNA <b>molecules</b> with both A- and B-form. Our results have shown that electron transfer through two isolated single-stranded molecules of poly(C) and poly(G) or poly(A) and poly(T), induced by the applied electric field along the molecular axis, is slightly larger than the corresponding <b>double-stranded</b> <b>molecules,</b> the effect being more evident for the B-form...|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} DNA strand {{exchange}} during general genetic recombination is initiated within protein-stabilized synaptic filaments containing homologous regions of interacting DNA molecules. The RecA protein in bacteria and its analogs in eukaryotic organisms start this process by forming helical filamentous complexes on single-stranded or partially single-stranded DNA molecules. These complexes then progressively bind homologous <b>double-stranded</b> DNA <b>molecules</b> so that homologous regions of single- and <b>double-stranded</b> DNA <b>molecules</b> become aligned in register while presumably winding around common axis. The topological assay presented herein {{allows us to}} conclude that in synaptic complexes containing homologous single- and <b>double-stranded</b> DNA <b>molecules,</b> all three DNA strands have a helicity of approximately 19 nt per turn...|$|R

40|$|This is a mini-review on the {{techniques}} to measure proliferation of cells by estimation of DNA synthesis. This {{is not an}} exhaustive review of literature, but a bird’s eye view of a few selected articles which may provide the technical details to the readers. The nucleus of a cell occupies about 10 - 30 % of the cells space, depends {{on the type of}} genetic material (DNA -DeoxyriboNucleic Acid). DNA is a long, <b>double-stranded,</b> helical <b>molecule</b> which carries the genetic information. Duplication of the DNA takes place by the phenomena of replication. One copy of <b>double-stranded</b> DNA <b>molecule</b> forms two <b>double-stranded</b> DNA <b>molecules.</b> DNA replication is the fundamental process used in all living organisms as it is the basis for biological inheritance. This process is known also as Mitosis in somatic cells. In Mitosis, the duplication process results in two genetically identical "daughter" cells from a single "parent" cell. The resulting <b>double-stranded</b> DNA <b>molecules</b> are identical; proof reading and error-checking mechanisms exist to ensure near perfect pair. Mitosis is divided into six phases: prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase, and cytokinesis...|$|R

50|$|Retroviruses (Group VI) have a {{single-stranded}} RNA genome but, in general, are {{not considered}} RNA viruses because they use DNA intermediates to replicate. Reverse transcriptase, a viral enzyme {{that comes from the}} virus itself after it is uncoated, converts the viral RNA into a complementary strand of DNA, which is copied to produce a <b>double-stranded</b> <b>molecule</b> of viral DNA. After this DNA is integrated into the host genome using the viral enzyme integrase, expression of the encoded genes may lead to the formation of new virions.|$|R

50|$|DNA {{normally}} {{exists as}} a <b>double-stranded</b> <b>molecule,</b> coiled {{into the shape}} of a double helix. Each nucleotide in DNA preferentially pairs with its partner nucleotide on the opposite strand: A pairs with T, and C pairs with G. Thus, in its two-stranded form, each strand effectively contains all necessary information, redundant with its partner strand. This structure of DNA is the physical basis for inheritance: DNA replication duplicates the genetic information by splitting the strands and using each strand as a template for synthesis of a new partner strand.|$|R

However, inter-feron-treated cells exhibited no enhanced susceptibility to several other toxic materials or to vaccinia virus that was unable to replicate; These findings suggest that interferon-treated cells exhibit a specific enhanced susceptibility to the toxicity of <b>double-stranded</b> RNA <b>molecules.</b> Since neither RNA nor protein syn-thesis was required for toxicity to occur in interferon-treated ceils exposed to polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid,it appears that the double-stranded RNA configuration is directly lytic for interferon-treated cells...|$|R
