With contact now seeming unlikely to the Australians, Healy was instructed to move to a rendezvous from which the battalion would be extracted back to Bien Hoa the following day. A Company subsequently set out on a compass bearing which would take them across the northern edge of the Gang Toi plateau. By 10:30 the Australians moved out in single file but had not <b>gone</b> <b>far</b> before a lone Viet Cong scout was observed shadowing them; he was subsequently shot and killed by the rear section. Crossing a creek line the Australians uncovered a company-sized camp of dugouts and trenches, before being fired upon at 15:40 by a single Viet Cong soldier who then fled. A Company halted briefly, and at this time two Viet Cong approached their position, before being killed by 1 Platoon.|$|E
5|$|Since the Turtle’s {{emergence}} {{over two}} centuries ago, the international playing field has leveled. The monopoly over submersible technology once {{held by the}} United States was lost over time as other navies around the world modernized and adopted submarine warfare. From the innovations of John Holland {{in the early twentieth}} century to the German U-boat campaigns of the World Wars, and the nuclear-powered ICBM submarines of the Cold War, modern navies embraced the submarine, first, for missions of reconnaissance and commerce-raiding, but, increasingly, in offensive, attack roles. In the postwar era, the submarine has become a central component of modern navies. Submarine usage has <b>gone</b> <b>far</b> beyond Bushnell’s conception of lifting naval blockades designed to bleed a country dry of their imports to become an essential arm of offensive naval warfare and power projection.|$|E
25|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} {{the introduction of the}} mandates different countries implemented it to different extents and at different paces. By 2004, some countries such as the United Kingdom had <b>gone</b> <b>far</b> beyond the original remit privatising the railway system in Great Britain (but not Northern Ireland), others such as Finland and France had created fully separate infrastructure and railway companies from the state-run enterprises; still others, such as Germany, had created separate subsidiaries for different service providers and a subsidiaries for infrastructure and track (DB Netz). Yet others merely separated accounting between the two organisational sections. Most countries in the EU still have a state owned infrastructure company, but many have privatised part or all of their service providers, or are working towards privatisation.|$|E

25|$|While {{waiting for}} their turn in the {{electric}} chair, Makley and Pierpont carved a pair of revolvers from large bars of soap, and blackened them with shoe polish. On September 22, 1934, the two used these props to attempt an escape. They assaulted a guard and freed Clark from his cell nearby. Before they had <b>gone</b> <b>far,</b> Clark, who was not looking at an imminent death sentence, lost his nerve and retreated to his cell. Moments later, armed guards arrived and shot Makley and Pierpont. Makley, hit in the thorax and abdomen, died on the scene. Pierpont was seriously wounded, but survived and was later executed. Makley's death certificate states that internal hemorrhaging from these wounds caused his death. He is buried in the Sugar Ridge Cemetery in Leipsic, Ohio.|$|E

Quinby ordered Ross to go back down the river to renew the attack, and he persuaded Foster (whom he could not order) to accompany him. A few desultory probes were launched in the next several days, but Quinby found what Ross already knew, that the land was unsuitable for an infantry assault. Quinby received orders from Grant to return to the Mississippi, where he and Ross were needed for the next assault on Vicksburg.

They were followed in 1907 by eight more raiders from Mingulay led by Micheal Neill Eachainn. Lady Gordon Cathcart took legal action but the visiting judge took {{the view that}} she had neglected her duties as a landowner and that [...] "long indifference to the necessities of the cottars had <b>gone</b> <b>far</b> to drive them to exasperation".

Millennia of continuous occupation notwithstanding, many of the remoter islands were abandoned — Mingulay in 1912, Hirta in 1930, and [...] in 1942 among them.

[...] Bernard DeVoto wrote a mixed review, but he praised the biography as [...] "the best book about the Mormons so far published." [...] DeVoto, who believed Joseph Smith was [...] "paranoid," [...] said that Brodie had not provided adequate psychological explanations for Smith's behavior.

500|$|Further {{work was}} carried out to {{the east side of}} the college, {{fronting}} onto Turl Street, in 1756 under Thomas Pardo (principal from 1727 to 1763). A new doorway replaced the previous Elizabethan one, and the front of the college was remodelled in the Palladian style– oblong sash windows were inserted at all levels and the original gables on the Turl Street side of the building were removed. Pardo himself gave £157 10s towards this work, although this only met the mason's bill of £156 18s 11d and not the other large bills for the work. In the opinion of Ernest Hardy, a college fellow who wrote a history of the college in 1899 and who served as principal from 1921 to 1925, this [...] "complete transformation" [...] gave the college a [...] "somewhat incongruous appearance". The result was also said to resemble a [...] "prison". One writer at the time, however, thought that the changes had not <b>gone</b> <b>far</b> enough.

500|$|The council, however, {{generated}} significant {{controversy in}} implementing its reforms: {{proponents of the}} [...] "Spirit of Vatican II" [...] such as Swiss theologian Hans Küng said that Vatican II had [...] "not <b>gone</b> <b>far</b> enough" [...] to change church policies. Traditionalist Catholics, such as Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre, however, strongly criticised the council, arguing that its liturgical reforms led [...] "to {{the destruction of the}} Holy Sacrifice of the Mass and the sacraments", among other issues. Several teachings of the Catholic Church came under increased scrutiny both concurrent with and following the council; among those teachings was the church's teaching regarding the immorality of contraception. The recent introduction of hormonal contraception (including [...] "the pill"), which were believed by some to be morally different than previous methods, prompted John XXIII to form a committee to advise him of the moral and theological issues with the new method. Paul VI later expanded the committee's scope to freely examine all methods, and the committee's unreleased final report was rumoured to suggest permitting at least some methods of contraception. Paul did not agree with the arguments presented, and eventually issued Humanae vitae, saying it upheld the constant teaching of the church against contraception, expressly including hormonal methods as prohibited. A large negative response to this document followed its release.|$|E
500|$|Marbury matriculated at Christ's College, Cambridge in 1571, but is {{not known}} to have graduated. [...] From Cambridge he went to Northamptonshire where he was ordained deacon by Edmund Scambler, Bishop of Peterborough, on 7 January 1578. [...] Though he was young {{when he became a}} deacon, he was not ordained as priest until decades later, in 1605. [...] While Marbury was of the Anglican Church, he had decidedly Puritan views. [...] Not all English {{subjects}} thought that the queen had <b>gone</b> <b>far</b> enough to cleanse the Anglican Church of Catholic rites and governance, or to ensure that its ministers were capable of saving souls through powerful preaching. [...] The most vocal of these critics were the Puritans, and Marbury was among the most radical of the non-conforming Puritans, the Presbyterians. [...] These more extreme non-conformists wanted to [...] "abolish all the pomp and ceremony of the Church of England and remodel its government according to what they thought was the Bible's simple, consensual pattern." [...] To do this, they would eliminate bishops appointed by the monarchs, and introduce sincere Christians to choose the church's elders (or governors). [...] The church leadership would then consist of two ministers, one a teacher in charge of doctrine, and the other a pastor in charge of people's souls, and also include a ruling lay leader.|$|E

500|$|In 1976 the {{government}} of South Africa decided to implement the use of Afrikaans as the medium of instruction in all schools instead of English. In response, high school students {{began a series of}} protests that {{came to be known as}} the Soweto Uprising. 15,000–20,000 students took part; the police, caught unprepared, opened fire on the protesting children. 700 people were estimated to have been killed, and over a thousand injured. The killings sparked off several months of rioting in the Soweto townships, and the protests became an important moment for the anti-Apartheid movement. Hugh Masekela wrote Soweto Blues in response to the massacre, and the song was performed by Miriam Makeba, becoming a standard part of Makeba's live performances for many years. [...] "Soweto Blues" [...] was one of many melancholic songs composed by Masekela during this period that expressed his support of the anti-apartheid struggle, along with [...] "Been <b>Gone</b> <b>Far</b> Too Long," [...] "Mama," [...] and [...] "The Coal Train." [...] Songs written after the Soweto uprising were generally political in nature, but used hidden meaning to avoid suppression, especially as the movement against apartheid gained momentum. A song by the band Juluka used a metaphor of fighting bulls to suggest the fall of apartheid. Many songs of this period became so widely known that their lyrics were frequently altered and adapted depending on the circumstances, making their authorship collective. Pianist Abdullah Ibrahim used purely musical techniques to convey subversive messages, by incorporating melodies from freedom songs into his improvisations. Ibrahim also composed [...] "Mannenberg", described as the [...] "most powerful anthem of the struggle in the 1980s", which had no lyrics but drew on a number of aspects of black South African culture, including church music, jazz, marabi, and blues, to create a piece that conveyed a sense of freedom and cultural identity.|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} half of the 1880s, Stanford collaborated with the author Gilbert à Beckett on two operas, Savonarola, and The Canterbury Pilgrims. The former was well {{received}} at its premiere in Hamburg in April 1884, but received a critical savaging when staged at Covent Garden in July of the same year. Parry commented privately, [...] "It seems very badly constructed for the stage, poorly conceived and the music, though clean and well-managed, is not striking or dramatic." [...] The most severe public criticism was in The Theatre, whose reviewer wrote, [...] "The book of Savonarola is dull, stilted, and, from a dramatic point of view, weak. It is not, however, so crushingly tiresome as the music fitted to it. Savonarola has <b>gone</b> <b>far</b> to convince me that opera is quite out of [...] line and that the sooner he abandons the stage for the cathedral, the better for his musical reputation." [...] The Canterbury Pilgrims had been premiered in London in April 1884, three months before Savonarola was presented at Covent Garden. It had a better reception than the latter, though reviews pointed out Stanford's debt to Die Meistersinger, and complained of a lack of emotion in the love music. George Grove agreed with the critics, writing to Parry, [...] "Charlie's music contains everything but sentiment. Love not at all – that I heard not a grain of. ... And I do think that there might be more tune. Melody is not a thing to be avoided surely." [...] In 1896 a critic wrote that the opera had [...] "just such a 'book' as would have suited the late Alfred Cellier. He would probably have made of it a charming light English opera. But Dr. Stanford has chosen to use it for the exemplification of those advanced theories which we know him to hold, and he has given us music which would incline us to think that Die Meistersinger had been his model. The effect of the combination is not happy." ...|$|E
