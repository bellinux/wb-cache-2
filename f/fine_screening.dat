40|$|Screening is a {{well-known}} classification process in the minerals processing industry. The process involves separation of fine particles from coarse particles based on size and is applicable to both dry and <b>fine</b> <b>screening.</b> <b>Fine</b> <b>screening</b> is normally carried out wet. Until recently, fine wet screening had been limited to relatively low throughput applications. Developments {{in the recent past}} have seen the evolution of <b>fine</b> <b>screening</b> to high capacity applications. It has found application in operations such as closed circuits with a mill in place of hydrocyclones. However, even though developments are increasing, there has been a process model developmental lag. A fine wet screen model {{that can be used for}} unit simulation purposes to predict screen performance outcomes or integration into other models to simulate and predict process performance is necessary. Most existing screen models are for dry and coarse screening applications. This thesis is aimed at developing a fine wet screen process model for predicting wet screening performance in the 45 - 150 μm range. Pilot plant testwork was conducted using a UG 2 -Chrome ore blend as feed. The tests were conducted at feed rates that ranged from 9 - 35 1 ̆d 4611 ̆d 45 dℎ and solids concentrations in the range 30 - 60 1 ̆d 4641 ̆d 461...|$|E
40|$|Potato is an {{indispensable}} {{part of human}} food. Many wild and cultivated potato relatives have been screened {{to find the best}} germplasm to improve productivity and quality, but only a small sample of the available biodiversity has been exploited. Most wild relatives are self-incompatible diploids. Genetic variability exists within and among populations, even within a species. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out <b>fine</b> <b>screening</b> to identify individuals carrying traits of interest. This study was carried out to quantify phenotypic variability for resistance to cold-induced sweetening, an important processing trait. Five families were evaluated for potato chip (crisp) color following cold storage of tubers harvested from four greenhouse trials and one field trial. The families were generated by crossing a single diploid clone to five plants from one accession of the wild potato relative Solanum raphanifolium. Analysis of variance revealed that resistance against cold-induced sweetening was dependent on family and trial.

40|$|Wastewater {{contains}} large solids {{and grit}} that {{can interfere with}} treatment processes or cause undue mechanical wear and increased maintenance on wastewater treatment equipment. To minimize potential problems, these materials require separate handling. Preliminary treatment removes these constituents from the influent wastewater. Preliminary treatment consists of screening, grit removal, septage handling, odor control, and flow equalization. This fact sheet discusses screening and grit removal. Screening Screening is the first unit operation used at wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Screening removes objects such as rags, paper, plastics, and metals to prevent damage and clogging of downstream equipment, piping, and appurtenances. Some modern wastewater treatment plants use both coarse <b>screens</b> and <b>fine</b> <b>screens.</b> Figure 1 depicts a typical bar screen (a type of coarse screen). Coarse Screens Coarse screens remove large solids, rags, and debris from wastewater, and typically have openings of 6 mm (0. 25 in) or larger. Types of coarse screens include mechanically and manually cleaned bar screens, including trash racks. Table 1 describes {{the various types of}} coarse <b>screens.</b> <b>Fine</b> <b>Screens</b> <b>Fine</b> <b>screens</b> are typically used to remove material that may create operation and maintenance problems in downstream processes, particularly in systems that lack primary treatment. Typical opening sizes for <b>fine</b> <b>screens</b> are 1. 5 to 6 mm (0. 06 to 0. 25 in). Very <b>fine</b> <b>screens</b> with openings of 0. 2 to 1. 5 mm (0. 01 to 0. 06 in) placed after coarse or <b>fine</b> <b>screens</b> can reduce suspended solids to levels near those achieved by primary clarification. Comminutors and Grinders Processing coarse solids reduces their size so they can be removed during downstream treatment operations, such as primary clarification, where both floating and settleable solids are removed. Comminuting and grinding devices are installed in the wastewater flow channel to grind and shred material up to 6 to 19 mm (0. 25 to 0. 75 in) in size. Comminutors consist of a rotating slotted cylinder through which wastewater flow passes. Solids that are too large to pass through the slots are cut by blades as the cylinder rotates, reducing their size until they pass through the slot openings...|$|R
40|$|Mineral {{processing}} is {{the process}} that involves liberation and beneficiation of valuable constituents of an ore. Several physical beneficiation processes exist and one such process is classification. Screens are classification devices sometimes used in the classification stage of closed grinding circuits to separate mill product into different size classes. Poor classification of particles results in reduced throughput, high power consumption and over - grinding. Most {{of the research on}} screening has been done in scalping applications or classification at relatively large cut sizes. There is limited work done on screening at feed sizes of minus 150 μm and there are no robust models for wet <b>fine</b> <b>screening</b> application for use in circuit simulation studies. The effect of feed flow rate, solids concentration and aperture size on wet <b>fine</b> <b>screening</b> performance was evaluated in this study. The range of values of the factors investigated were the feed rate (9, 13, 19, 25, 30 and 35 t/h), screen aperture size (45, 75, 106 and 150 μm) and solids content (30, 40, 50 and 60 %). A pilot Derrick screen plant at Mintek in Johannesburg was used for the experiments on a UG 2 and chromite ore blend. Screen undersize and oversize samples were collected for particle size distribution analysis and mass balance calculations. The samples collected were filtered, de - lumped and split down to masses ranging between 200 and 300 grams for wet screening using the Malvern MasterSizer particle analyser. The results were used to analyse the effect of the investigated factors on the wet <b>fine</b> <b>screening</b> performance. These results were used to develop a wet <b>fine</b> <b>screening</b> model. Results indicate that increased feed flow rate and solids concentration lead to finer cut sizes, reduced sharpness of separation and higher water recoveries to the oversize. An increase in aperture size increased the sharpness of separation and decreased the water recoveries to the oversize. The solids concentration appeared to have a higher effect on cut size than the feed flow rate. The highest cut size and sharpness of separation and lowest water recovery to oversize were attained at the lowest feed rate. The lowest solids concentration produced the best performance with regards to all partition curve properties. The cut size approached the aperture size at the lowest throughput and solids concentration for all aperture sizes. All the efficiency curves exhibited fish hooks at fine particle sizes with the fish hooks becoming more pronounced at higher feed flow rates and solids concentration and smaller aperture sizes. A wet fine screen model that includes multi component ores as well as changes in operating conditions was developed using the 2 - parameter Whiten screen model as a basis. The dimensional analysis approach was applied in developing the sub - models that relate the operating and design parameters to the Whiten model parameters. The dimensional analysis approach was further applied to develop the model that describes the fish hook effect for subsequent incorporation into the overall modified fine screen model. Generally, the modified model is capable of predicting the performance of the wet fine screen reasonably well with minor errors and accommodates for the data that exhibits the fish hook. The model also reduces the fitting process required in the original Whiten model...|$|E

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this thesis has been {{to contribute to the}} understanding of the total process of water and sludge handling of small wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) within the framework of sustainable performance and optimum processing costs. This was done by conducting a case study on a WWTP in Poland. Substantial growth in the field of wastewater management is expected in the East and Central Europe. This is in particular true for the countries that recently became part of the EU and therefore are obligated to follow the many Directives that exists, including those concerning wastewater treatment. Consequently, Poland is expected to invest substantial amounts of money into their wastew- ater sector in the upcoming years. With over 15 million people living in the rural areas and majority of them still lacking access to proper wastewater infrastructure, the importance of small-scale WWTPs be- comes transparent. Four different configurations of technological solutions were evaluated for an existing small-scale plant in Poland. The benefits and disadvantages of combined treatment of raw influent and surplus sludge using <b>fine</b> <b>screening</b> and different solutions for end-of-line sludge treatment were assessed using Material Flow Analysis and Life Cycle Costing. The end use of the sludge was integrated into the Life Cy- cle Costing and tested for the alternatives of landfilling and incineration. The entire evaluation was done within the constrains set by laws and regulations. Combined treatment of raw influent and surplus sludge result in significantly larger concentrations of total suspended solids in the effluent and is not complying with the requirements set by the authority. Analysis of the economic feasibility show that composting as end-of-line sludge treatment is not benefi- cial for small-scale WWTPs. On the contrary, a significant cost reduction is achieved by direct utilisation of dried or dewatered sludge. Landfilling is not a preferred method from an environmental point of view, nor the best solution from an economic point of view for sludge management. Incineration of sludge to produce energy is both sustainable and economically feasible for small-scale WWTPs. The analysis shows the importance of choosing the right combination of technologies to comply with the requirements in effluent and to utilise the potential of saving notable amounts of money. A holistic approach taking into account the economic, technical, environmental and socials aspects is necessary to find the most sustainable solution. </p...|$|E
