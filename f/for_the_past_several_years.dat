It was during this period that two new (and still existing) club records were set: fifteen consecutive home League wins in {{what turned out to}} be a 24-game unbeaten run at Bloomfield Road. The run stretched from November of the 1990–91 season to November of the following campaign.

25|$|Riot grrrl is an {{underground}} feminist punk movement that {{originated in the}} early 1990s in Washington state (particularly Olympia) and the greater Pacific Northwest. It also had origins in Washington, D.C. It is a subcultural movement that combines feminist consciousness and punk style and politics. It {{is often associated with}} third-wave feminism, which is sometimes seen as its starting point. It has also been described as a musical genre that came out of indie rock, with the punk scene serving as an inspiration for a musical movement in which women could express themselves in the same way men had been doing <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>several</b> <b>years.</b>|$|E

25|$|The School of Cinematic Arts, {{the oldest}} and largest film school in the country, confers degrees in six {{different}} programs. As the university administration considered cinematic skills too valuable to be kept to film industry professionals, the school opened its classes to the university at large in 1998. In 2001, the film school added an Interactive Media & Games Division studying stereoscopic cinema, panoramic cinema, immersive cinema, interactive cinema, video games, virtual reality, and mobile media. In September 2006, George Lucas donated $175 million to expand the film school, {{which at the time}} was the largest single donation to USC (and its fifth over $100 million).

25|$|Visitors with a {{passport}} stamp from Israel {{are not allowed}} to enter a number of countries because of the Arab League boycott of Israel. Some countries, e.g. Austria, Canada, Germany, Russia, UK and the USA allow their citizens to hold two or more passports of their country to circumvent such travel restrictions, but some countries (including Austria and Germany) also restrict or forbid the holding of two passports of two different countries, i.e. dual citizenship. However <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>several</b> <b>years,</b> stamps are no longer used at Ben Gurion airport (since January 15, 2013) and also land border crossings with Jordan.

25|$|Jamie Bell's {{audition}} {{for the role}} of Smike in a London hotel room left McGrath and the producers in tears, and they cast him on the spot. While considering Mrs. Crummles, a smug, opinionated, but lovable dowager, McGrath realized all her traits and characteristics were embodied by Dame Edna Everage, alter ego of actor Barry Humphries, but was hesitant to suggest casting a male in the role. The producers, however, agreed Humphries was an ideal choice. Nicholas {{was one of the last}} roles to be cast. Charlie Hunnam had been sent the script, but several months passed before he had an opportunity to read it. He met with McGrath, and based on a couple of hours of conversation with the actor, the director felt he finally had found the right man for the part. Ironically, the British Hunnam had to work with a dialect coach; having lived and worked in the US <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>several</b> <b>years,</b> he had perfected an American accent in order to ensure regular employment.|$|E
