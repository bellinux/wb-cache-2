50|$|The mud in the {{wellbore}} must exert enough {{hydrostatic pressure}} to equal the formation pore pressure. If the fluid’s hydrostatic pressure {{is less than}} formation pressure the well can flow.The most common reason for insufficient fluid density is drilling into unexpected abnormally pressured formations. This situation usually arises when unpredicted geological conditions are encountered. Such as drilling across a fault that abruptly changes the formation being drilled.Mishandling mud at the surface accounts for many instances of insufficient <b>fluid</b> <b>weight.</b> Such as opening wrong valve on the pump suction manifold and allowing a tank of light <b>weight</b> <b>fluid</b> to be pumped; bumping the water valve so more is added than intended; washing off shale shakers; or clean-up operations.

40|$|Excessive fluid {{accumulation}} {{is associated}} with increased morbidity and prolonged convalescence after cardiopulmonary bypass. However, water fluctuations are difficult to assess {{solely on the basis}} of changes in body <b>weight</b> and <b>fluid</b> balance. Bioelectric impedance analysis is a simple, rapid, noninvasive bedside technique that measures the resistance of the body to a weak alternating current (50 kHz). The change in resistance is inversely proportional to the change in total body water. To investigate the relationship between body <b>weight,</b> <b>fluid</b> balance, and resistance, 18 patients who had cardiopulmonary bypass (9 men, 9 women, aged 61 ± 3 years, weighing 80 ± 4 kg, with ejection fraction 54 % ± 3 % and bypass time 113 ± 8 minutes [mean plus or minus standard error of the mean]) were followed up for 7 postoperative days. Body <b>weight,</b> <b>fluid</b> balance, and whole body and regional resistance were determined at 24 -hour intervals. In the immediate postoperative period, fluid retention was accurately detected by simultaneous measurements of weight gain and decreased resistance (p 0. 05), and body weight returned to baseline on day 4 (p> 0. 05). Change in weight and change in whole body resistance were highly correlated with cumulative fluid balance (r= 0. 84, p< 0. 001, and r=− 0. 81, p< 0. 001, respectively), and these two measures were also related to each other throughout the study (r=− 0. 89, p< 0. 001). The initial change in resistance was the best measurement associated with postoperative outcome (p≤ 0. 01). The data suggest that the measurement of electric resistance across the body can accurately detect acute changes in total body water and in fluid redistribution through the body. However, determining the relative day-to-day change in whole body resistance seems more appropriate than calculating absolute fluid changes over time. Bioelectric impedance offers a simple, rapid, noninvasive method to monitor serial changes in total body water. This technique can be useful in situations in which rapid alterations in water compartments occur, and it may be useful in predicting outcome after cardiopulmonary bypass...|$|R

The reliability of measuring fluid input/output is uncertain. Moreover, this measurement is redundant, complex, labour-intensive and represents an occupational hazard for nurses and other health-care workers handling fluids or body excreta. In a prospective cohort study, we determined the concordance between body <b>weight</b> and <b>fluid</b> intake/output. We also examined the clinical consequences {{with respect to the}} safety of selecting only body weight measurement as a parameter for fluid overload. A total of 591 combined observations of fluid balances and body weights were collected. We observed a higher increase in body <b>weight</b> than in <b>fluid</b> balance. The Pearson correlation between fluid balance and body weight was relatively low (r = 0. 28).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} fluid retention, glomerular filtration rate, {{and urine}} output in dogs anesthetized for a surgical orthopedic procedure. ANIMALS: 23 dogs {{treated with a}} tibial plateau leveling osteotomy. PROCEDURES: 12 dogs were used as a control group. Cardiac output was measured in 5 dogs, and 6 dogs received carprofen for at least 14 days. Dogs received oxymorphone, atropine, propofol, and isoflurane for anesthesia (duration, 4 hours). Urine and blood samples were obtained for analysis every 30 minutes. Lactated Ringer's solution was administered at 10 mL/kg/h. Urine output was measured and glomerular filtration rate was estimated. Fluid retention was measured by use of body <b>weight,</b> <b>fluid</b> balance, and bioimpedance spectroscopy. RESULTS: No difference was found among control, cardiac output, or carprofen groups, so data were combined. Median urine output and glomerular filtration rate were 0. 46 mL/kg/h and 1. 84 mL/kg/min. Dogs retained {{a large amount of}} fluids during anesthesia, as indicated by increased body <b>weight,</b> positive <b>fluid</b> balance, increased total body water volume, and increased extracellular fluid volume. The PCV, total protein concentration, and esophageal temperature decreased in a linear manner. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Dogs anesthetized for a tibial plateau leveling osteotomy retained a large amount of fluids, had low urinary output, and had decreased PCV, total protein concentration, and esophageal temperature.

If g=id_M (where M∈ Obj C) and C is Karoubian, then g <b>kills</b> <b>weights</b> m, [...] .,n whenever {{there exists a}} weight decomposition of M that "avoids" these weights (in the sense earlier defined by Wildeshaus). We prove the equivalence of several definitions for killing weights. In particular, we describe a family of cohomological functors that "detects" this notion. We also prove that M is without weights m, [...] ., n (i. e., a decomposition of M avoiding these weights exists) {{if and only if}} the corresponding condition is fulfilled for its weight complex t(M). These results allow us to get new (stronger) results on the conservativity of the weight complex functor t. We study in detail the case C=SH (endowed with the spherical weight structure whose heart consists of coproducts of sphere spectra); the corresponding weight complex functor is just the one calculating the HZ-homology (whose terms are free abelian groups). In this case g <b>kills</b> <b>weights</b> m, [...] ., n if and only if H(g) = 0 for all H represented by elements of SH[m,n] (so, these morphisms form an injective class of morphisms in the sense defined by Christensen; yet this class is not stable with respect to shifts). Moreover, for any spectrum M there exists a "weakly universal decomposition" P→ M→ I_ 0 for I_ 0 ∈ SH[m,n] and P being without weights m, [...] .,n (so, we obtain a torsion pair). We also prove a certain converse to the stable Hurewicz theorem.

The same is true for vessels in air: a dirigible that weighs 100 tons needs to displace 100 tons of air. If it displaces more, it rises; if it displaces less, it falls. If the dirigible displaces exactly its weight, it hovers at a constant altitude.|$|R

50|$|A well kill {{procedure}} is an oil well control method. Once the well has been shut-in on a kick, proper kill procedures {{must be done}} immediately. The general idea in well kill {{procedure is}} to circulate out any formation fluid already in the wellbore during kick, and then circulate a satisfactory <b>weight</b> of <b>kill</b> mud called <b>Kill</b> <b>Weight</b> Mud (KWM) into the well without allowing further fluid into the hole. If this can be done, then once the kill mud has been fully circulated around the well, {{it is possible to}} open up the well and restart normal operations. Generally, a kill mud (KWM) mix, which provides just hydrostatic balance for formation pressure, is circulated. This allows approximately constant bottom hole pressure, which is slightly greater than formation pressure to be maintained, as the kill circulation proceeds because of the additional small circulating friction pressure loss. After circulation, the well is opened up again.|$|R
