5000|$|Gokai Sabre (Gōkai Sāberu): The Gokai Sabre is the Gokaigers' primary sword sidearm, {{resembling}} a cutlass {{with a built-in}} <b>extendable</b> <b>wire,</b> allowing it to be wielded yo-yo-like (which is one of Gokai Yellow's specialty techniques). It is able to utilize the Ranger Keys to activate the Gokai Slash (Gōkai Surasshu) and Gokai Scramble (Gōkai Sukuranburu) Final Wave attacks. Gokai Blue and Gokai Yellow will typically trade their Gokai Guns with the other Gokaigers for dual Gokai Sabres. In addition, Gokai Yellow can join two Gokai Sabres to form a double-bladed weapon, while Gokai Blue can combine up to three blades in one handle {{as part of his}} Five-Blade Style Blue Slash Final Wave attack. With Gokai Silver Gold Mode and the Hurricanegers, the Gokaigers can perform the Gokai Super Ninpou Hurricane Scramble (Gōkai Chō Ninpō Hariken Sukuranburu) Final Wave attack. As Gokai Christmas, Gokai Silver can perform the Gokai Christmas Slash (Gōkai Kurisumasu Surasshu) Final Wave attack with the Gokai Gun. With Gavan, Gokai Red can perform the Gavan Marvelous Dynamic (Gaban Māberasu Dainamikku) Final Wave attack. With Gokai Silver Gold Mode, the Gokaigers can perform the Gokai Shooting Slash (Gōkai Shūtingu Surasshu) Final Wave attack.|$|E
