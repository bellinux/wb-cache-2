25|$|The Pakistani Ministry of Water and Power {{reported}} in 2002 that only 1% {{of the domestic}} and <b>industrial</b> <b>wastewater</b> receives treatment. According to the Pakistan Water Situational Analysis, there are three wastewater treatment plants in Islamabad, of which only one is functional. Karachi has two trickling filters, where effluents generally receive screening and sedimentation. Lahore has some screening and grit removal systems, but they are hardly functional. In Faisalabad, there is a wastewater treatment plant, in which wastewater receives primary treatment, but it treats only 7 percent of the collected wastewater in the city. Multan, Rawalpindi and Gujranwala have no wastewater treatment plants at all. In rural areas, wastewater treatment is nonexistent, leading to pollution of surface and groundwater.|$|E
30|$|As we know, <b>industrial</b> <b>wastewaters</b> {{contain a}} large amount of nitrates and salt (Glass and Silverstein, 1997; Hirata et al., 2001; Labbe et al., 2003). van der Hoek et al.

However, the denitrification rate of saline wastewaters decreased under highly saline conditions (Yang et al., 1995). Therefore, nitrogen removal from saline wastewater has been considered to be difficult (Yoshie et al., 2004).

Well and spring water in the basin is bacteriologically contaminated because of sewage discharge. The concentrations of nitrates in some wells in the Ghouta near Damascus exceeded the limits set by the drinking water standards. Because of discharges by tanneries concentrations of Chromium III reach 10mg/liter in Al Daiyani River and exceed the allowable limits ten-fold in the wells of Al Zablatini area, all located in the Barada basin.|$|E
25|$|The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defined {{secondary}} treatment {{based on the}} performance observed at late 20th-century bioreactors treating typical United States municipal sewage. Secondary treated sewage is expected to produce effluent with a monthly average of less than 30mg/l BOD and less than 30mg/l suspended solids. Weekly averages may be up to 50 percent higher. A sewage treatment plant providing both primary and {{secondary treatment}} is expected to remove at least 85 percent of the BOD and suspended solids from domestic sewage. The EPA regulations describe stabilization ponds as providing treatment equivalent to secondary treatment removing 65 percent of the BOD and suspended solids from incoming sewage and discharging approximately 50 percent higher effluent concentrations than modern bioreactors. The regulations also recognize the difficulty of meeting the specified removal percentages from combined sewers, dilute <b>industrial</b> <b>wastewater,</b> or Infiltration/Inflow.|$|E
25|$|Sewage {{treatment}} {{may also be}} referred to as wastewater treatment, although the latter is a broader term which can also be applied to purely <b>industrial</b> <b>wastewater.</b> For most cities, the sewer system will also carry a proportion of industrial effluent to the sewage treatment plant which has usually received pretreatment at the factories themselves to reduce the pollutant load. If the sewer system is a combined sewer then it will also carry urban runoff (stormwater) to the sewage treatment plant. Sewage water can travel towards treatment plants via piping and in a flow aided by gravity and pumps. The first part of filtration of sewage typically includes a bar screen to filter solids and large objects which are then collected in dumpsters and disposed of in landfills. Fat and grease is also removed before the primary treatment of sewage.|$|E
