40|$|Both risk-based and {{deterministic}} {{methods are}} used for regulating the nuclear industry {{to protect the public}} safety and health from undue risk. The deterministic method is one where performance standards are specified for each kind of nuclear system or facility. The deterministic performance standards address normal operations and <b>design</b> <b>basis</b> <b>events</b> which include transient and accident conditions. The risk-based method uses probabilistic risk assessment methods to supplement the deterministic one by (1) addressing all possible events (including those beyond the <b>design</b> <b>basis</b> <b>events),</b> (2) using a systematic, logical process for identifying and evaluating accidents, and (3) considering alternative means to reduce accident frequency and/or consequences. Although both deterministic and risk-based methods have been successfully applied, there is need for a better understanding of their applications and supportive roles. This paper describes {{the relationship between the two}} methods and how they are used to develop and assess regulations in the nuclear industry.

It reproduces the primary, secondary and containment systems of the reactor with 1 : 100 volume scale, full elevation, prototypical fluid and thermal-hydraulic conditions.

These featured additions of DOW Corning Q 2 - 3183 A anti-foam agent. Results {{indicated that this}} anti-foam agent (AFA) increased gas holdup in the waste simulant by about a factor of four and, counter-intuitively, that the holdup increased as the non-newtonian simulant shear strength decreased (apparent viscosity decreased). Such results raised the potential of increased flammable gas retention in Hanford Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant (WTP) vessels mixed by air sparging and pulse-jet mixers (PJMs) during a <b>Design</b> <b>Basis</b> <b>Event</b> (DBE). Additional testing was performed {{to determine the effects}} of simulant properties, composition of alternate AFAs, and presence of trace noble metals. Key results are that: (1) Increased gas holdup resulting from addition of Q 2 - 3183 A is due to a decrease in surface tension that supports small bubbles which have low rise velocities. (2) Dow Corning 1520 -US AFA shows it to be a viable replacement to Dow Corning Q 2 - 3183 A AFA. This alternative AFA, however, requires significantly higher dosage for the same anti-foam function.

The current concept for the Plutonium Can-in-Canister waste form is provided in Attachment III. A typical <b>design</b> <b>basis</b> <b>event</b> (DBE) defines a scenario that generally includes an initiating event and the sequences of events that follow.

In addition to the dose calculation, a plutonium respirable particle size for dose calculation use is derived. The current concept for this waste form is plutonium disks enclosed in cans immobilized in canisters of vitrified HLW (i. e., glass). The plutonium inventory at risk used for this calculation is selected from Plutonium Immobilization Project Input for Yucca Mountain Total Systems Performance Assessment (Shaw 1999). The BDBE examined in this calculation is a nonmechanistic initiating event and the sequence of events that follow to cause a radiological release. This analysis will provide the radiological releases and dose consequences for a postulated BDBE. Results may be considered in other analyses to determine or modify the safety classification and quality assurance level of repository structures, systems, and components. This calculation uses best available technical information because the BDBE frequency is very low (i. e., less than 1. 0 E- 6 events/year) and is not required for License Application for the Monitored Geologic Repository.

In particular it is intended to furnish a post-test evaluation of the structural effects caused by the interaction between water and lead-bismuth (during a SGTR accident event) with reference to the experimental tests carried out at the ENEA Brasimone Research Centre. The interacting fluids are Lead Bismuth Eutectic (LBE) at 0. 1 MPa and 400 °C and water at 4 MPa and 200 °C. After a briefly description of Test A 1. 3 and A 1. 4, executed at the ENEA Brasimone Research Centre in the LIFUS 5 /Mod 2 facility, the result of the numerical FEM analyses are presented and discussed. The propagation of the pressure wave was simulated by 3 -dimensional Finite Element Method (FEM) models implemented in suitable FEM structural codes. The obtained results, validated by a comparison with the experimental data results, indicate that no significant dangerous effects on the LIFUS test vessel occur - as stress levels are below the allowable limit value - with the assumed geometry and in the testing conditions.

One way to defend against such accidents is to include a highly reliable reactor protection system. The perceived undesirability of the consequences arising from an unprotected transient has led some sodium fast reactor designers to consider incorporating several design modifications to the reactor protection system, including: self-actuated shutdown systems, articulated control rods, and seismic anticipatory scram systems.
