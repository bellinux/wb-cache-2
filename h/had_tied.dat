5|$|In the 12 {{previous}} matches {{between the}} two sides – four Test matches and eight ODIs – England had a 100% winning record against Bangladesh, the only international team able to boast such a record. The previous year, Bangladesh had claimed their first Test series victory against a senior Test nation, though it came against a West Indies side that was heavily weakened because of an industrial dispute. England came into the tour {{on the back of a}} two-and-a-half-month series against South Africa in which they <b>had</b> <b>tied</b> the Test and Twenty20 International series, and secured a 2–1 ODI series win.|$|E
5|$|On April 3, 1921, {{while visiting}} friends in Greenwich Village, Hepburn {{discovered}} {{the body of}} her adored older brother, Tom, dead from an apparent suicide. He <b>had</b> <b>tied</b> a sheet around a beam and hanged himself. The Hepburn family denied it was suicide and maintained that Tom's death {{must have been an}} experiment that had gone wrong. The incident made the teenage Hepburn nervous, moody, and suspicious of people. She shied away from other children, dropped out of Oxford School, and began receiving private tutoring. For many years she used Tom's birthday (November 8) as her own. It was not until her 1991 autobiography, Me: Stories of My Life, that Hepburn revealed her true birth date.|$|E
5|$|On February 26, 2010, Butler {{traveled}} to Valparaiso for their regular season finale. Leading scorer Gordon Hayward was sidelined with lower back pain, {{but the team}} still won 74–69. In so doing, Stevens broke the coaching record he <b>had</b> <b>tied</b> the prior week and Butler completed an 18–0 undefeated conference schedule. It was Butler's first undefeated conference record since joining the Horizon League, and first since Joe Sexson led the 1978 team to a 6–0 record in the now defunct Indiana Collegiate Conference. Stevens earned his third straight regular-season conference championship.|$|E

5|$|The 13 {{teams were}} drawn into four groups, with Group 1 {{containing}} four teams, {{and the others}} containing only three. Each group played a round-robin format, with two points awarded for a win and one point for a draw. If two teams <b>had</b> <b>tied</b> on points to win a group, a play-off would {{have been used to}} decide the group winner; however, this was not necessary. The four group winners progressed to the knockout semi-final stage. Extra time was available in the knockout matches if the two teams were level after ninety minutes, but it was not required.|$|E
5|$|His father Goronwy ab Ednyfed (d. 1268) was seneschal to Llywelyn ap Gruffudd (also {{known as}} Llywelyn the Last), the King of Gwynedd by 1258, {{continuing}} {{in the role}} until his death on 12 October 1268. In that role, Goronwy had followed {{in the footsteps of}} his father, Ednyfed Fychan, and by doing so <b>had</b> <b>tied</b> the fortunes of the early House of Tudor to those of Llywelyn. Goronwy led Llywelyn's military forces, and in February 1263 he took them as far south as Gwent in action against the Marcher Lords. Tudur ap Goronwy was one of three sons of Goronwy ab Ednyfed, alongside Goronwy ap Goronwy (also known as Goronwy the Younger or Goronwy Fychan) and Hywel ap Goronwy. Tudur Hen was not the first member of the family to be named Tudur: he was preceded by his uncle, Tudur ab Ednyfed, {{who had been in the}} service of the previous Prince of Wales, Dafydd ap Llywelyn.|$|E
5|$|The Florida State touchback allowed Vick {{to start}} at his 20-yard line for Virginia Tech's second {{possession}} of the game. The possession began {{no better than the}} first one, as Virginia Tech committed a 10-yard holding penalty on the first play. On subsequent plays, however, the Hokie offense began to move the ball with success. Vick completed a 12-yard pass to wide receiver Eddie Royal, and the offense was aided by a 15-yard Florida State penalty, which gave the Hokies an automatic first down. Following the first down, Vick completed the first big Virginia Tech play of the game, throwing the ball 35yards downfield to Justin Harper, who caught it in Florida State territory. Two more plays pushed Virginia Tech {{to the edge of the}} Florida State red zone, but a penalty and another sack prevented the Hokies from advancing the ball further. Virginia Tech was forced to send in kicker Brandon Pace to attempt a 45-yard field goal. The kick was good, and Virginia Tech <b>had</b> <b>tied</b> the game 33 with 1:00 remaining in the quarter.|$|E

5|$|A third ship, the Manantico also {{crashed into}} shore {{due to a}} {{combination}} of the storm and human error in which the captain confused Cape Henry with Cape Charles after spotting another schooner. The Manantico was also where the two deaths associated with the storm occurred. The first was when a cook on the ship was crushed to death by the cargo of lumber being hauled by the ship. The ship was then pushed towards a sand bar. The captain, who had stayed high on the starboard side for safety, began climbing down to slip the ship cables, but the ship made a sudden stop. This flung the captain into the water, and he drowned. Both bodies were found after the storm and were very disfigured. The captain was sent to Middletown, Connecticut for interment while the body of the cook was buried on the beach. The final ship was the Harriet Thomas, which was the schooner spotted by the Manantico. After beaching, the crew managed to get a rope to shore where fishermen <b>had</b> <b>tied</b> the other end. The crew were able to climb ashore, although the captain had to be rescued via alternate means due to being too heavy for this method. The ship was written off as a $7000 (1887 USD) loss. Although all four ships were beached, due to the loss of communications, only one wreck – that of the Mary D. Cranmer – was reported in the Norfolk Virginian newspaper. As a result, news of the two deaths from the Manantico were initially unreported.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{freshman}} college season, McKee {{qualified for the}} 1972 U.S. Olympic team despite recovering from a bout of mononucleosis. At the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Germany, he represented the United States in three different events. Most memorably, McKee won a silver medal in the men's 400-meter individual medley in the closest swimming decision in Olympic history, losing {{by a margin of}} two one-thousandths (0.002) of a second to Sweden's Gunnar Larsson. Initially, the scoreboard showed that Larsson and McKee <b>had</b> <b>tied</b> with an official time of 4:31.98, but in a controversial decision, the event judges named Larsson the eventual gold medal-winner ten minutes after the race was over—Larsson's electronic clock time was 4:31.981, McKee's 4:31.983. The time difference was variously calculated as one-tenth of the time of a typical blink of a human eye, and the distance as the thickness of a coat of paint, a sheet of paper, or the minor imperfections in the individual lanes of the Olympic pool. As a result of the controversy, the international swimming federation, FINA, subsequently clarified the timing rules for competition swimming; international races are now required to be timed to the hundredth of a second, and timing to the thousandth of a second is prohibited for tie-breakers. It was the first and only Olympic swimming event ever decided on the basis of thousandths of a second. Afterward, McKee attributed his second-place finish to a tactical mistake: he looked over his shoulder to see where Larsson was in the final leg of the race.|$|E
5|$|Free agent pitcher Mike Mussina {{signed with}} the Yankees before their 2001 season began, and the club {{pulled away from the}} Red Sox as the year progressed to claim another divisional championship, as Clemens won 20 games. The September 11 attacks {{interrupted}} the season, and the resumption of baseball in New York became a symbol of how the city recovered from the destruction of the Twin Towers. After falling behind 2–0 in the ALDS against the Athletics, the Yankees won three straight contests to advance to the ALCS. They prevailed in five games against the Seattle Mariners, who <b>had</b> <b>tied</b> a single-season MLB record with 116 regular season wins, for the team's fourth straight AL pennant. The Arizona Diamondbacks gained a two-game lead in the 2001 World Series before the Yankees won three consecutive ballgames; New York home runs with two outs in the ninth inning of Games 4 and 5 led to extra inning wins in both games, with Game 4 ended by a Jeter home run. The Yankees' championship streak ended, though, as the Diamondbacks won the Series in seven games with a late rally in the final inning of Game 7.|$|E

5|$|The Browns won the AAFC's Western Division {{with their}} perfect record {{and faced the}} Buffalo Bills, {{the winners of the}} Eastern Division, in the AAFC {{championship}} game. The Bills <b>had</b> <b>tied</b> with the Colts for the lead in the Eastern, forcing a playoff that the Buffalo won on December 12 in Baltimore. The championship game took place in Cleveland in 35-degree weather and was sparsely attended. The Browns were expected to win the game, having beaten the Bills twice in the regular season and possessing a significantly better record than the 7–7 Bills. The scoring began with a late-first-quarter Edgar Jones touchdown run, followed by a fumble return for a touchdown by George Young in the second period that put the Browns ahead 14–0 at halftime. Cleveland scored two more touchdowns in the third quarter on runs by Jones and Motley before Buffalo scored its first points. Aided by a roughing the kicker penalty on the Browns, the Bills capped an 80-yard drive with a short touchdown pass from Jim Still to Al Baldwin. Motley scored two more touchdowns in the fourth quarter, however, and Lou Saban ran back an interception for a third to make the final score 49–7. Motley and Edgar Jones led the Browns offense in the game, accounting for a large share of the team's offensive production. Graham had an uncharacteristically quiet day, passing for just 118 yards on 11 completions. The victory made the Browns the first professional team to win three league championships in a row, following AAFC titles they won in 1946 and 1947. It was also the first time a professional football team finished a full season unbeaten and untied since a championship game was instituted in the NFL in 1933. The Chicago Bears had finished with perfect records in 1934 and 1942, but lost the NFL championship both times. The Browns had won 18 consecutive games stretching to the 1947 season, a professional record that stood until 2004.|$|E
25|$|Protagoras {{was born}} in Abdera, Thrace, {{opposite}} the island of Thasos (today part of the Xanthi regional unit). According to Aulus Gellius, he originally made his living as a porter, but one day he was seen by the philosopher Democritus carrying a load of small pieces of wood he <b>had</b> <b>tied</b> with a short cord. Democritus realized that Protagoras <b>had</b> <b>tied</b> the load together with such perfect geometric accuracy {{that he must be}} a mathematical prodigy. Democritus promptly took him into his own household and taught him philosophy. Protagoras became well known in Athens and even became a friend of Pericles.|$|E
