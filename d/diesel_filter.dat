The higher the soot content was, the easier the initiation of combustion was.

40|$|This paper {{involves}} an experimental {{investigation of the}} role of the volatile organic fraction (VOF) adsorbed on the diesel particulate, in the initiation of regeneration of a SiC <b>diesel</b> <b>filter</b> installed on a modern diesel engine, run on catalytic additive-doped fuel. VOF adsorption-desorption and oxidation behaviour is mainly determined by performing a thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of samples collected directly from a SiC filter installed on the engine running under low- and medium-speed and low- and medium-load conditions, as more representative of city driving. Based on the TGA analysis results, the percentage VOF content in soot was calculated and mapped as a function of engine speed and load in the range of investigation. The effect of adsorbed hydrocarbons on the regeneration behaviour was assessed by comparing regeneration experiments with the stepwise load increase for a filter loaded with soot at different VOF concentration levels. The appearance of a number of incidents of stochastic regeneration behaviour during loading at low exhaust temperatures with a relative high VOF content was observed and discussed. An effort was made to correlate regeneration rate with the VOF content in soot and the prevailing engine operation point during loading. This work aims at better understanding of <b>diesel</b> <b>filter</b> behaviour with modern diesel engines and also aims to support improved modelling of fuel-additive assisted regeneration by use of fuel additives at low temperatures (150 - 400 degreesC) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} {{catalytic}} regeneration characteristics of porous ceramic diesel particulate filters (DPFs) is of growing interest to industry as diesel soot emissions {{are limited by}} legislation to levels below 0. 01 g/km (for passenger cars). More specifically, pressure drop computations and correlations are important factors employed {{in the design and}} control of <b>diesel</b> <b>filter</b> systems. However, in numerous cases, computations and models fail to match the experimentally observed evolution of soot combustion in the filter. In this paper, the role of flow maldistribution in this issue is investigated, by means of full-scale tests of the loading and regeneration behaviour of a particulate filter installed on a modern diesel engine run on catalyst-doped fuel. Loading tests were performed at three characteristic engine operation points with markedly different levels of engine exhaust gas mass flowrate. In these tests, it becomes apparent that complex flow maldistribution phenomena exist during the loading phase, which are not directly reflected by the behaviour of the pressure drop versus time curve. However, these phenomena are shown to affect the distribution of collected soot mass in the different channels of the filter and, consequently, the regeneration behaviour. The evolution of flow maldistribution was also studied in a number of regeneration experiments. It was confirmed that the variation of the volatile organic fraction in the filter and the associated partial catalytic regenerations at low temperatures interact with flow and soot maldistribution in a complex way. The conclusions from this study set the scene for future, more detailed investigations that are expected to improve understanding and modelling of <b>diesel</b> <b>filter</b> pressure drop and regeneration characteristics...|$|E

40|$|This is an {{experimental}} and computational {{study of the}} effect of a low-percentage biodiesel blend on the operation, <b>diesel</b> <b>filter</b> loading, and fuel additive-assisted regeneration behavior on a conventional, direct injection (DI), single-cylinder diesel engine. The evolution of regeneration was studied by means of infrared thermography on the unit filter. The results of two sets of regeneration experiments, one for each fuel blend, with high-space velocity levels are discussed. The test fuels were conventional diesel (denoted as B 0) and B 20 biodiesel blend. The objective was to investigate the differences in catalytic soot ignition and regeneration propagation when the engine is fueled by biodiesel blend. The investigation is assisted by the application of an in-house diesel particulate filter (DPF) regeneration modeling tool. The results indicate a faster evolution of the regeneration with B 20 fuel, with lower overall filter wall temperatures prevailing, more favorable on filter durability grounds.

40|$|In this work, {{the effect}} of using a Whale filter on the overall vehicle exhaust {{emissions}} was evaluated. A Whale filter is a South African patented diesel particulate filter designed to operate as a secondary <b>diesel</b> <b>filter</b> {{for the removal of}} particulate contaminants up to 0. 5 microns in size in the fuel prior to injection. It is believed that removal of contaminants prior to injection may improve the fuel injection efficiency, thereby promoting efficient combustion, and thus resulting in reduced emissions and fuel consumption. Emissions tests were conducted on four different vehicle categories to validate this. All vehicles underwent pre-emissions testing prior to installation of the Whale filter. Each test was conducted for a period of approximately 20 minutes by varying the engine speed. The Applus + Autologic Vehicle Emissions Analyser was used to measure the emissions at each stage, and a similar procedure was followed to measure the emissions after installation of the Whale filter. The results showed a significant average reduction in carbon monoxide CO (35. 3 %), nitrogen oxides NOx (26. 1 %) and hydrocarbons HC (34. 3 %) emissions after the Whale filter was installed in the four vehicles...|$|E
40|$|Understanding the {{mechanisms}} that affect catalytic activity in porous ceramic diesel particulate filters (DPF) at the temperature range 200 to 400 degreesC {{is important for}} the successful modeling of the initiation and evolution of catalytic regeneration by use of fuel additives. This refers not only to the dry carbon particulate, but also to the volatile hydrocarbons adsorbed on it. In this paper, a detailed analysis of the hydrocarbon adsorption-desorption and oxidation behavior of diesel particulate emitted by a modern diesel engine and collected on a SiC <b>diesel</b> <b>filter</b> is performed by use of thermogravimetric and differential scanning calorimetry analysis (TGA-DSC). Non-isothermal tests were performed with samples collected directly from a ceramic filter connected to the exhaust system of the diesel engine running under low and medium speed and load operating conditions with and without fuel additive. Fuel additive concentration was varied to investigate its effect on the soot oxidation behavior. Based on the TGA data, the kinetic parameters of the soot oxidation reaction were calculated. The effect of volatile adsorbed hydrocarbons on the soot oxidation reaction was evaluated by comparing the calculated activation energies for samples collected from the center and the periphery of the filter at various exhaust temperatures prevailing at filter loading phase. In particular it was seen that the catalytic activity of the fuel additive is enhanced by the presence of the volatile organic components. (C) 2003 The Combustion Institute.

40|$|The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health {{conducted}} a study {{to determine the effects}} of selected, state-of-the-art emission control technologies on the ambient concentrations of particulate matter and gases emitted by underground diesel-powered mining equipment. Tests were conducted in an isolated zone of an underground mine to evaluate the effectiveness of alternative fuel formulations, namely, water-fuel emulsions, blended biodiesel fuels, ultralow sulfur diesel fuel, and # 1 diesel; and selected exhaust after treatment devices, namely, diesel oxidation catalysts (DOCs), diesel particulate filter (DPF) systems, and filtration systems designed around high-temperature disposable filter elements. The results showed that using a cold-weather and warm-weather water-fuel emulsion formulation reduced mass concentrations of elemental carbon (EC) by about 70 % and 85 %, respectively. The 20 % and 50 % soy biodiesel blends reduced EC by 49 % and 66 %, respectively. The reductions were slightly less pronounced for the 20 % and 50 % yellow grease biodiesel blends- 33 % and 56 %, respectively. EC concentrations were unaffected by using ultralow sulfur diesel in place of # 1 diesel. Use of the reformulated fuels did not substantially alter the concentrations of nitric oxide and carbon monoxide. However, a measurable increase in the nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) peak concentration was observed during the biodiesel tests. The ArvinMeritor (AM) fuel-burner DPF system with a palladium-catalyzed DOC reduced EC concentrations by 92 %. The <b>diesel</b> <b>filter</b> elements from Donaldson Co., Inc., and Filter Service & Testing Corp. reduced the EC concentration of the mine air by 92 % and 70 %, respectively. When the palladium-based DOC was used with the AM DPF, it raised the average and peak downstream NO 2 concentrations by a factor of three. Tests of the AM DPF system with a platinum-catalyzed DOC and CAP/ETG catalytic particulate oxidizer system had to be terminated because the elevated NO 2 concentrations threatened to overexpose the operator. The tests with only a selected DOC also resulted in increased NO 2 concentrations in mine air. " - NIOSHTIC- 2 by Aleksandar D. Bugarski, George H. Schnakenberg, Jr., Steven E. Mischler, James D.

In this paper the results from an experimental study of flow distribution in wall-flow <b>diesel</b> <b>filters</b> are presented. The experiments were performed on a specially designed cold flow test rig, under steady state flow conditions. The flow distribution at the exit of cordierite and SIC filters were measured with a hot film velocity sensor under low and medium mass flowrate conditions. The system configuration was varied to incorporate tests with and without the installation of an oxidation catalyst before the filter in order to investigate the effect of the catalyst honeycomb structure to the measured flow distribution. Flow distribution in filters loaded with various levels of particulate mass was also measured using the same device. The filters were loaded in a modern diesel engine run on catalyst-doped fuel up to different backpressure levels. A flow uniformity index was adopted in order to quantify the measured flow maldistribution by a single number for each case. The velocity distribution at the exit of the filters is found to be significantly affected by certain design and operating parameters of the system: diffuser-catalyst-filter. The results of this work aim to give a better assessment of the magnitude of flow maldistribution in <b>diesel</b> <b>filters,</b> which severely distort their pressure drop characteristics and affect the distribution of collected soot mass.
