5|$|As a result, Azamat {{abandons}} Borat, {{taking his}} passport, {{all of their}} money, and their bear (whose head is later seen inside Azamat's motel refrigerator). Borat's truck runs out of gas, and he begins to hitchhike to California. He is soon picked up by drunken fraternity brothers from the University of South Carolina. On learning {{the reason for his}} trip, they show him the Pam and Tommy sex tape, revealing that she is not the virgin <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was.</b> After leaving the three students, Borat becomes despondent, burning the Baywatch booklet and, by mistake, his return ticket to Kazakhstan. He is also about to slaughter his pet hen, but then changes his mind and lets it go.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Jennifer Crittenden, and {{directed}} by Swinton O. Scott III. This was the first episode Scott directed for the show. Crittenden also made her debut as a writer for The Simpsons in this episode. Crittenden was taking a beginners' writing program at 20th Century Fox when former The Simpsons showrunner David Mirkin hired her on the show. Crittenden's only writing experience before that had been as an intern on the Late Show with David Letterman. 20th Century Fox introduced Crittenden to Mirkin, and Mirkin read a script of hers that he liked. When Mirkin first talked to Crittenden, <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> a really nice woman who was very mature. Crittenden was only 23 {{years old at the}} time, but Mirkin liked her and he hired her.|$|E

Shocked, Cristina agrees, but later finds out that the {{potential}} conflict of interest regarding the plane crash lawsuit was a key motive behind Owen's request and confronts him.

After buying the hospital, Yang realizes that she was made for the O.R. and breaks things off with Owen because he still wants kids and she still doesn't.|$|E

500|$|Charlene's first {{scenes were}} with Scott Robinson (played by Jason Donovan). <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{trying to break}} into the Ramsay house and confronted her, which {{resulted}} in Charlene punching him. Minogue ended up punching Donovan for real during the take. Producers soon created a story arc for the characters that saw them enter into a romantic relationship. Scott and Charlene's relationship helped boost ratings for Neighbours and the show's publicist, Brian Walsh, capitalised on Minogue and Donovan's increasing popularity with viewers and rumoured off-screen romance. Of Scott and Charlene, Minogue commented [...] "People like Scott and Charlene being a couple. It's probably the most normal relationship in the show." [...] Kelly Bourne from TV Week observed that Scott and Charlene struck a chord with fans, who could identify with them.|$|E
500|$|In {{her first}} appearance, Laura San Giacomo plays Harmony Chase, {{a woman who}} hires Keith to {{investigate}} her cheating husband. The two were both series regulars on the NBC sitcom Just Shoot Me!. The two actors had maintained a close friendship after their sitcom was cancelled, and when Rob Thomas brought up a romantic storyline for Keith to Colantoni, he suggested Giacomo for the role. Giacomo accepted the role, later stating, [...] "It {{was kind of a}} no-brainer situation for me. I love Rico, love working with him, and it was just as much fun as I thought it would be." [...] In addition to sharing in-jokes about Just Shoot Me! while on set, Colantoni also remembered what a good actress <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> in their earlier days. After the first appearance, both Colantoni and Giacomo lobbied for more storylines together. Thomas was open to the possibility, saying, [...] "I wouldn't hesitate to go back to this, because I was really happy with how it played out." [...] Giacomo would go on to appear on three episodes of the show.|$|E

500|$|Harris was {{followed}} into the witness-box by {{a succession of}} landladies, waitresses and other women, all of whom confirmed Davidson's habitual pestering without making any serious accusation of misconduct. [...] When Davidson himself took to the stand, on 25 May, his light-hearted, even flippant, manner created, says Tucker, [...] "the flavour of a comedy routine with the rector's counsel as straight man". Davidson's disastrous finances were aired—he took great offence when his association with Gordon was presented as a [...] "partnership in crime". [...] He caused disbelief and amusement in the court when, questioned about the boil-lancing incident with Rose Ellis, he professed not to know what a [...] "buttock" [...] was, claiming: [...] "It is a phrase I have honestly never heard. So far as I remember {{it is a little}} below the waist." [...] At this stage, only Harris's largely uncorroborated testimony had provided specific allegations of immorality; the rest of the evidence was inconclusive and it seemed that the prosecution might fail. Davidson's cause was severely damaged, however, when Oliver produced a photograph of him, taken on 28 March 1932, with a nearly naked girl. She was Estelle Douglas, the 15-year-old daughter of one of Davidson' oldest friends. Davidson explained that the picture had been intended as a publicity shot to help the girl find work as an actress. He protested that he had been set up, and did not know she was naked under her shawl; <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> wearing a bathing suit, as she had been in an earlier photograph. [...] On 6 June, after closing speeches from both sides, the court adjourned until 8 July to allow the chancellor, who alone would determine the outcome, to consider the evidence.|$|E
500|$|About {{the songs}} to be {{included}} on the album, De Vita revealed that his idea was to include well-known songs that were {{more than three years}} old and refresh them with new arrangements. [...] "The first challenge was to choose the songs, and the second to make that sound different... but not too much", De Vita said. Sixteen previous songs by the singer are included: [...] "Un Buen Perdedor", from his debut album of 1984; and [...] "Aquí Estás Otra Vez", from Fantasía (1986); [...] "Louis" [...] and [...] "Te Amo", from Al Norte del Sur (1989); [...] "No Basta", the lead single from Extranjero (1990); [...] "Y Te Pienso" [...] and [...] "Cálido y Frío", from Voces a mi Alrededor (1993); [...] "Si Quieres Decir Adios" [...] and the title track from the 1993 album Fuera de Este Mundo; and [...] "Si Tú No Estás" [...] and [...] "Te Veo Venir Soledad", selected from Nada es Igual (1999). The most represented album on the setlist is Stop (2005) with four songs: [...] "Si La Ves", [...] "Dónde Está el Amor", [...] "No Me Lástimes", and [...] "Tú de Qué Vas". [...] "No Se Olvida" [...] is the only song selected from the 2008 album Simplemente La Verdad. Two songs were previously unreleased. De Vita chose Mexican singer Alejandra Guzmán to record the lead single [...] "Tan Sólo Tú", since <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> [...] "perfect" [...] for the song. [...] "Mira Más Allá" [...] is the other new song included. De Vita also stated his intention to record a sequel to Primera Fila; since many songs in his repertoire were left out, [...] "I would like to include Shakira on a ballad... Ricky Martin was considered for this album too, but could not make it in time." [...] Two years later, Vuelve en Primera Fila was announced to be the follow-up album which was released on November 12, 2013 in Latin America.|$|E
2500|$|There {{were many}} [...] "sightings" [...] of Mrs. Luetgert {{after the trial}} began. She was sighted in 12 {{different}} states but never found. One {{of the most famous}} myths was that she was seen boarding a ship in New York bound for Europe. When Adolph heard this he said that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> definitely fleeing the country. The sightings of Louisa Luetgert however, never became global.|$|E
60|$|Philip went to awake Mrs. Foster, but it {{was later}} than <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> and <b>she</b> <b>was</b> up already. He told her to send the {{gardener}} with a message, and {{he went back to}} his uncle's room.|$|R
6000|$|What the deuce did she {{run away}} for, when I came in? <b>he</b> <b>thought.</b> If <b>she</b> <b>is</b> amusing, <b>she</b> must make herself useful; for it's {{intensely}} dull, I own, here, {{in spite of}} Lucia. Hey, what's that? ...|$|R

2500|$|In March 2016, a {{security}} guard at the library was observed by multiple patrons harassing a Muslim patron for wearing a hijab. Protests were held outside the library & the security guard admitted to harassing the woman although he claimed <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> wearing a hoodie. [...] The security guard, who had been previously terminated by Metropolitan Police for destruction of private property, was not fired despite there being no policy against wearing hoodies in the library.|$|E
2500|$|Tina T (Neridah Waters) is {{introduced}} in episode five, {{as a replacement}} for the missing-in-action Mephisto. [...] She appears to be smarter {{than the rest of the}} team, but truthfully this is not saying much. [...] She and Rod had a brief romance, which ended when Rod tried to grope her while <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> dead. After slicing Rod's spine open in the next episode, Tina seems to satisfied with her revenge and has not been seen or heard from since.|$|E
60|$|Then was Keawe more wroth than ever. With her, because <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{brooding}} {{over the}} case of the old man; and with himself, because <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> right, and was ashamed to be so happy.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{were both}} jealous," [...] said Pen. [...] "Dear Laura, let us both forgive"--and he seized her band {{and would have}} drawn her towards him. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> relenting, and already assumed the airs of a victor.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> must <b>be</b> {{beginning}} {{to care for}} him. Three months before the thought of an evening spent in conversation would have bored her to death. It was a fine day, and the spring added to Philip's high spirits. He was content with very little now.|$|R
60|$|It {{had come}} to her as an {{inspiration}} that if <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> knew, or <b>were</b> on the edge of knowledge, he would tell her.|$|R
60|$|The lawyer {{regarded}} her with amazement. Then his brow darkened, for <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{playing with the}} girl, and was not sincere.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{going to}} cry; but, getting up quickly, she half {{turned her back}} on them, and stood regaining control of herself.|$|E
6000|$|She was confoundedly bizarre, <b>he</b> <b>thought.</b> <b>She</b> <b>was</b> {{beginning}} to inspire {{him with an}} indefinite uneasiness. He said surlily, for he was busy with important thoughts: ...|$|E
50|$|When {{he first}} chatted her up, <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> either a prostitute or just another good time girl; whilst {{on the other}} hand Lahlum <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> worked for the Germans, or was in fact a German - albeit one with an odd accent.|$|R
60|$|She stirred {{her coffee}} absently. At first <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> might <b>be</b> offended, for <b>she</b> {{did not look}} up for several moments.|$|R
60|$|Her final {{examination}} <b>was</b> at midsummer. <b>She</b> insisted on sitting for it, {{although she had}} neglected her work during the past months. He also wanted her to go in for the degree. Then, <b>he</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>she</b> would <b>be</b> satisfied. Secretly he hoped she would fail, so that <b>she</b> would <b>be</b> more glad of him.|$|R
60|$|The {{sergeant}} was {{a friend}} of Kate's, but he looked at her as if <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> crazy when she told him where we were going.|$|E
60|$|He hesitated. He {{felt that}} she was {{creeping}} back again into his life when <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> gone out of it for ever. She watched him with sickening anxiety.|$|E
60|$|Oh, I see! The Roo mistook her; <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{somebody}} that he knew! And she wasn't! I catch on! It gets {{easy to understand}} these pictures once you're on.|$|E
6000|$|For {{a moment}} {{she looked at him}} in a puzzled way, then moved past him, and as he stood, stiffly erect, {{watching}} her graceful figure, <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> about to leave him, and was glad of it. But ere she had taken half a dozen steps: ...|$|R
5000|$|On 18 June 1810, Moselle {{fired on}} the sloop [...] off Barbados. Boys {{apologized to the}} Americans, {{reporting}} {{that he had been}} unable to make out her colours and that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> might <b>be</b> a French privateer that he was seeking. The Americans suffered one casualty, a man wounded in the mouth by a splinter.|$|R
6000|$|... "The Squire {{told me so}} himself," [...] he went on, {{keeping his}} eyes remorselessly fixed upon her face. She leaned forward and <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> going to faint, but she did not. By a supreme effort she {{recovered}} herself and drank a glass of sherry which was standing by her side.|$|R
