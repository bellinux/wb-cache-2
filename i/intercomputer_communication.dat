40|$|In safety {{critical}} I/O and <b>intercomputer</b> <b>communication</b> networks, reliable message transmission {{is an important}} concern. Difficulties of communication and fault identification in networks arise primarily because the sender of a transmission cannot be identified with certainty, an intermediate node can corrupt a message without certainty of detection, and a babbling node cannot be identified and silenced without lengthy diagnosis and reconfiguration. Authentication protocols use digital signature techniques to verify the authenticity of messages with high probability. Such protocols appear to provide an efficient solution to many of these problems. The objective of this program is to develop, demonstrate, and evaluate <b>intercomputer</b> <b>communication</b> architectures which employ authentication. As a context for the evaluation, the authentication protocol-based communication concept was demonstrated under this program by hosting a real-time flight critical guidance, navigation and control algorithm on a distributed, heterogeneous, mixed redundancy system of workstations and embedded fault-tolerant computers...|$|E

The Charles Stark Draper Laboratory has developed and implemented a number of reconfig-urable circuit-switched networks for input/output and <b>intercomputer</b> <b>communication.</b> Such networks currently are considered fundamental building blocks for Draper designed dis-tributed fault tolerant systems such as the Advanced Information Processing System (AIPS). They appear as various YO networks and as the Intercomputer (IC) network for the AlPS system. The design of a network for this type of mixed redundancy distributed system poses nu-merous challenges. The following are the principal attributes desired in such an inter-com-pu ter network...|$|E

Keywords: Asynchronous communication, parallel computing, numerical solutions, uid dynamics. 1 Introduction In a perfect parallelizable world all computational problems would be divided in tasks of approximately equal diculty, achieving perfect load balancing. At the same time, communication times between processors of a MIMD machine would be negligible. The same would [...] ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractEmploying Abelson's {{multistage}} model of distributed computation, we study {{the amount of}} <b>intercomputer</b> <b>communication</b> required for a differentiable function to be computed in a multicomputer network, {{under the assumption that}} each computer in the network has only partial information about the input data. We formulate a general approach for obtaining a lower bound on the amount of required information exchange among the computers in the network. Unlike other studies in this setting, where the lower bound results are obtained only for the special two-computer case and often for a certain particular class of functions, our approach makes it possible to obtain a lower bound result for a general multicomputer network and for any differentiable function. The lower bound obtained here is given in terms of a certain differential-geometric property of the function to be computed and is not merely asymptotic, in contrast to most lower bound results in the literature. Furthermore, the lower bound is fully constructive and computable...|$|E
