5|$|Dysregulation of the {{ubiquitin}} proteasome {{system may}} contribute to several neural diseases. It may lead to brain tumors such as astrocytomas. In some of the late-onset neurodegenerative diseases that share aggregation of misfolded proteins as a common feature, such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, large insoluble aggregates of misfolded proteins can form and then result in neurotoxicity, through mechanisms that are not yet well understood. Decreased proteasome activity has been suggested {{as a cause of}} aggregation and Lewy body formation in Parkinson's. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that yeast models of Parkinson's are more susceptible to toxicity from α-synuclein, the major protein component of Lewy bodies, under conditions of low proteasome activity. Impaired proteasomal activity may underlie cognitive disorders such as the autism spectrum disorders, and muscle and nerve diseases such as <b>inclusion</b> <b>body</b> myopathy.|$|E

HLA typing has led to some improvement and acceleration in the diagnosis of celiac disease and type 1 diabetes; however, for DQ2 typing to be useful, it requires either high-resolution B1*typing (resolving *02:01 from *02:02), DQA1*typing, or DR serotyping. Current serotyping can resolve, in one step, DQ8. HLA typing in autoimmunity is being increasingly used as a tool in diagnosis. In celiac disease, it is the only effective means of discriminating between first-degree relatives that are at risk from those that are not at risk, prior to the appearance of sometimes-irreversible symptoms such as allergies and secondary autoimmune disease.|$|E

40|$|Protein {{aggregation}} is {{a widely}} observed phenomenon in human diseases, biopharmaceutical production, and biological research. Protein aggregates are generally classified as highly ordered, such as amyloid fibrils, or amorphous, such as bacterial <b>inclusion</b> <b>bodies.</b> Amyloid fibrils are elongated filaments with diameters of 6 – 12 nm, they are comprised of residue-specific cross-β structure, and display characteristic properties, such as binding with amyloid-specific dyes. Amyloid fibrils are associated with dozens of human pathological conditions, including Alzheimer disease and prion diseases. Distinguished from amyloid fibrils, bacterial <b>inclusion</b> <b>bodies</b> display apparent amorphous morphology. <b>Inclusion</b> <b>bodies</b> are formed during high-level recombinant protein production, and formation of <b>inclusion</b> <b>bodies</b> {{is a major concern}} in biotechnology.

40|$|Abstract Background When {{heterologous}} recombinant proteins {{are produced}} in Escherichia coli, they often precipitate to form insoluble aggregates of unfolded polypeptides called <b>inclusion</b> <b>bodies.</b> These structures {{are associated with}} chaperones like IbpA. However, there are reported cases of "non-classical" <b>inclusion</b> <b>bodies</b> in which proteins are soluble, folded and active. Results We report that the Brucella abortus PdhS histidine kinase fused to the mCherry fluorescent protein forms intermediate aggregates resembling "non-classical" <b>inclusion</b> <b>bodies</b> when overproduced in E. coli, before forming "classical" <b>inclusion</b> <b>bodies.</b> The intermediate aggregates of PdhS-mCherry are characterized by the solubility of PdhS-mCherry, its ability to specifically recruit known partners fused to YFP, suggesting that PdhS is folded in these conditions, and the quick elimination (in less than 10 min) of these structures when bacterial cells are placed on fresh rich medium. Moreover, soluble PdhS-mCherry foci do not systematically colocalize with IpbA-YFP, a marker of <b>inclusion</b> <b>bodies.</b> Instead, time-lapse experiments show that IbpA-YFP exhibits rapid pole-to-pole shuttling, until it partially colocalizes with PdhS-mCherry aggregates. Conclusion The data reported here suggest that, in E. coli, recombinant proteins like PdhS-mCherry may transit through a soluble and folded state, resembling previously reported "non-classical" <b>inclusion</b> <b>bodies,</b> before forming "classical" <b>inclusion</b> <b>bodies.</b> The dynamic localization of IbpA-YFP foci suggests that the IbpA chaperone could scan the E. coli cell to find its substrates. </p...|$|R
