5|$|Bradford City were {{struggling}} in the Second Division {{at the time}} of Cowan's signing, having won <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> their first ten games of the 1935–36 season. Cowan made his debut for them on 19 October 1935 in a 2–2 draw with Swindon Town, {{but it was not until}} Cowan's third game that Bradford won for the second time that season. Cowan missed just three of the club's remaining fixtures that season, playing 29 times in the league and three in the FA Cup as City finished 12th. The following season, City again struggled. Cowan missed <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the first 23 games, but after Christmas, he was restricted to just six; and without Cowan, Bradford finished 21st and were relegated to the Third Division (North).|$|E

5|$|As for tournaments {{where only}} one of the Big Four has competed, this is the only {{category}} where {{the rest of the field}} has a positive ratio, winning 186 of the 262 tournaments (71%) played overall. However, it must be noted that this includes many tournaments played early on in each of the Big Four's careers when they were still unseeded or seeded in double digits. Since their debut as the Top 4 seeds in late 2008, the Big Four have won 31 of the 60 tournaments (52%) where <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> them has competed.|$|E

5|$|Following Ruisdael's trip to Germany, his landscapes {{took on a}} more heroic character, with forms {{becoming}} {{larger and}} more prominent. A view of Bentheim Castle, dated 1653, is <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> a dozen of Ruisdael's depictions of a particular castle in Germany, almost all of which pronounce its position on a hilltop. Significantly, Ruisdael made numerous changes to the castle's setting (it is actually on an unimposing low hill) culminating in a 1653 version which shows it on a wooded mountain. These variations are considered by art historians to be evidence of Ruisdael's compositional skills.|$|E

They had two further children: Becky, and Tom (born 1978). Smith released his autobiography, <b>Just</b> <b>One</b> <b>Of</b> Seven, in November 2008. He writes a weekly column for The Sentinel and is occasionally a commentator on Stoke matches for BBC Radio Stoke. In July 2011, he re-joined Stoke on a part-time basis as a mentor for young Academy players needing guidance off the pitch.|$|E

In 2013, the further revision of the Planned Birth Policy allowed couples in which either parent had no siblings to have two children. In 2015, China allowed all couples to have two children, abolishing its decades-long one-child policy for urban families.|$|E

5|$|The Picidae are <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> eight living {{families}} in the order Piciformes, the others being barbets, toucans, and honeyguides in the clade Pici, and the jacamars and puffbirds in the clade Galbuli. DNA sequencing has confirmed the sister relationships of these two groups. The family Picidae includes about 240 species arranged in 35 genera. Almost 20 species are threatened with extinction due to loss of habitat or habitat fragmentation, with one, the Bermuda flicker, being extinct and a further two probably being so.|$|E

5|$|The {{decision}} to form two groups, Belle Amie and One Direction, from soloists {{at the end}} of the bootcamp stage was branded unfair by some of the other groups, as neither had entered the competition as groups.
