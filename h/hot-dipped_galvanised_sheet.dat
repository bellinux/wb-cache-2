40|$|In {{this study}} a new {{approach}} to the online monitoring of the Al depth profile of <b>hot-dip</b> <b>galvanised</b> <b>sheet</b> steel is presented, based on laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS). The coating composition is measured by irradiating the traversing sheet steel with a series of single laser bursts, each at a different sheet steel position. An ablation depth in the same range as the coating thickness (about 10 µm) is achieved by applying a Nd:YAG laser at 1064 nm in collinear double-pulse and triple-pulse mode. The ablation depth is controlled by adjusting the burst energy with an external electro-optical attenuator. A fingerprint of the depth profile is gained by measuring the LIBS signals from zinc, aluminium and iron {{as a function of the}} burst energy, and by post-processing the data obtained. Up to three depths can be sampled simultaneously with a single laser burst by measuring the LIBS signals after each pulse within the laser burst. A concept for continuously monitoring the Al depth profile during the galvanising process is presented and applied to different <b>hot-dip</b> <b>galvanised</b> coatings. The method was tested on rotating sheet steel disks moving at a speed of up to 1 m/s. The potential and limitations of the new method are discussed...|$|R

40|$|It was {{the aim of}} {{the joint}} project to {{investigate}} the development of highly efficient processes for depositing new coating systems on steel sheet based on high-rate electron beam evaporation in combination with plasma processes. Project work was performed in three application areas (I) additional coating of galvanished steel sheet; (II) new environmental friendly functional coatings; (III) coatings with very high corrosion protection. Within its partial project TKS was involved in performing the coating trials; basical investigations with regard on the concentration profiles, corrosion behaviour in unpainted and painted state, paint adhesion as well as spot welding and adhesive bonding behaviour of the coating systems were performed. Furtheron, the requirements on the coatings were formulated and the obtained results were evaluated in particular with regard on an industrial application in the future. Application area I: The coating system which evolves through PVD-coating of <b>hot-dip</b> <b>galvanised</b> steel <b>sheet</b> with Mg followed by a thermal diffusion treatment seems to be a promising approach for the development of new metallic alloy coatings for steel sheet. However, open questions remain in particular with regard on the basic mechanisms of the alloy formation, the principal microstructure of the coatings and the resulting corrosion behaviour. Application area II: It can be concluded that the requirements on the coatings were principally met by means of evaporation of Si without inlet of oxygene. However many questions remain open in particular with regard on the influence of the parameters of the plasma pre-cleaning in vacuum and of the PVD-deposition on the structure of the coatings and hence on their application-related properties. Further studies are therefore necessary for further optimising and eventual industrial application of both coating systems. Regarding application area III only very few investigations were performed {{within the framework of the}} TKS work; on the base of only these results no final conclusions regarding the properties of the investigated coatings were possible.

40|$|During the {{production}} of <b>galvanised</b> <b>sheet</b> steel, key monitoring parameters are the thickness and chemical composition of the zinc coating. For this purpose a new method was developed for the online characterisation of <b>galvanised</b> <b>sheet</b> steel based on laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) and a transportable measuring unit was set up. Concepts for {{the determination of the}} coating thickness and the aluminium depth profile of <b>hot-dip</b> <b>galvanised</b> coatings were developed. To simulate the steel sheet velocity in the plant of up to 2 m/s LIBS measurements are performed on rotating sheet steel discs mounted on a rotary stage. The depth resolution is determined by using well characterised industrially coated sheet steels with different coating thicknesses (4. 1 to 11. 2 µm) and aluminium depth profiles as reference samples. A thickness resolution of better than 150 nm is achieved. For a measuring system designed for an online application the measurement time for an aluminium depth profile will be 10 seconds and for the determination of the coating thickness 200 ms. The impact of the LIBS craters on the sheet steel quality is minimised by using burst energies below 3 mJ. The influence of LIBS craters on the steel sheet quality was investigated by corrosion tests.

The numeric analysis of beam models with various testing anchorage lengths (the analysis input data comprised the results of previous bond strength tests carried out in a laboratory) unambiguously confirmed that when the bond strength between concrete and <b>hot-dip</b> <b>galvanised</b> reinforcement with a sufficient test anchorage length is tested in a beam test, {{the negative impact of}} the coating corrosion on bond strength with concrete may be biased.

40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} work studying the factors influencing {{on the service}} life of <b>hot-dip</b> <b>galvanised</b> reinforcement bars. The experimental {{part of the study}} consisted of accelerated corrosion tests among others. The comparison of the measured crack width of concrete with the rate of corrosion values, and also with other measured values such as the corrosion potential, the resistivity of concrete, and the mechanical properties of the steel indicated no correlation irrespective of the duration of the exposure or type of aggressive liquid. The rate of corrosion decreased as a function of exposure time. This was not dependent on the water-to-cement ratio of concrete. Three probable corrosion mechanisms are determined for <b>hot-dip</b> <b>galvanised</b> reinforcement bars in cracked concrete, based on long-term durability tests and other studies. The first mechanism consists of a local dissolution of the eta (η) and zeta (ζ) phases of the zinc layer. In the second mechanism, {{as a result of the}} non-uniformity of the zinc coating, local dissolution of the eta (η) and zeta (ζ) phases, together with longitudinal and perpendicular cracking in the zinc layer, may lead to the local separation of the zinc layer. In the third mechanism, as a result of the non-uniformity of the zinc coating, full dissolution of eta (η) phase and partial dissolution of the zeta (ζ) phase, together with longitudinal and perpendicular cracking in the ferrite, may lead to the local separation of the zinc layer and the ferrite. The effects of different reinforcing steels on the service life of outdoor concrete structures were estimated through calculations. A stochastic method based on the probability of damage, Monte Carlo simulation, and reliability and sensitivity analyses were also used. In carbonated intact and cracked concrete the use of <b>hot-dip</b> <b>galvanised</b> reinforcement bars could double the service life compared with the use of ordinary steel reinforcement bars. In chloride-contaminated intact concrete the service life as a result of using <b>hot-dip</b> <b>galvanised</b> reinforcement bars is 3 - 5 times longer compared with ordinary steel reinforcement bars. The conclusion is based on the results received with the critical water-soluble chloride content, 1. 0 - 1. 5 wt%CEM, which is substantially higher than the critical water-soluble chloride content, 0. 3 - 0. 4 wt%CEM, for ordinary steel reinforcement bars...|$|R
40|$|The {{corrosion}} and {{oxidation behaviour}} of many metallic materials {{can be modified}} by ion beam bombardment of their top surface layers. Mechanical and chemical mechanisms co-operate to prevent the progress of corrosion. Rare earth ions have already been employed to avoid high-temperature oxidation of stainless steels and other technological alloys. This paper extends the use of lanthanides to improve the corrosion resistance properties of galvanic layers. By using a mass-analysed ion implanter, different doses of La+ and Ce+ have been implanted at 150 keV in two kinds of galvanic layers: <b>hot-dip</b> <b>galvanised</b> steel samples and galvannealed steel samples. Morphological changes were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and these are different depending on the substrate, the kind of ion and implanted dose. The study of polarisation curves in NaCI solutions shows that ion implantation clearly improves the corrosion behaviour of ion-implanted layers for the <b>hot-dip</b> <b>galvanised</b> layers, but not as clearly for the galvannealed, La+ implantation being the most effective means. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.

To determine the mentioned quantities two different non-destructive methods have been developed and tested in a <b>hot-dip</b> <b>galvanising</b> line. An electromagnetic method which allows the measurement of the incremental permeability and futher derived quantities has been used to determine the yield strength.

Beside the multiple regression method also a neutral network has been tested. An ulrasonic methods also working on an electromagnetic basis has been used to determine the deep drowing properties represented by the para meters of the plastic anisotropy. The method is based on the direction dependence of the velocity of a SH-wave, (Shear Horizontal) which is strongly correlated to the texture of the material.
