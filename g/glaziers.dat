5|$|Many Scottish {{painters}} {{of the early}} part of the eighteenth century remained largely artisans. Roderick Chalmers' (fl. 1709–30) painting The Edinburgh Trades (1720) shows the artist himself, perhaps ironically, among the <b>glaziers,</b> wrights and masons of the burgh. Thomas Warrender (fl. 1673–1713) produced the Allegorical Still Life (after 1708), of a letter board that seems to be a commentary on the union of 1707, but he made his living as a house decorator, working closely with architects, including William Adam. He may have trained James Norie (1684–1757), who with his sons James (1711–36) and Robert (d. 1766), painted the houses of the peerage with Scottish landscapes that were pastiches of Italian and Dutch landscapes. They tutored many artists and have been credited with the inception of the tradition of Scottish landscape painting that would come to fruition from the late eighteenth century. The painters Allan Ramsay (1713–84), Gavin Hamilton (1723–98), the brothers John (1744–68/9) and Alexander Runciman (1736–85), Jacob More (1740–93) and David Allan (1744–96), mostly began in the tradition of the Nories, but were artists of European significance, spending considerable portions of their careers outside Scotland. Henry Raeburn (1756–1823) was the most significant artist of the period to pursue his entire career in Scotland, born in Edinburgh and returning there after a trip to Italy in 1786.|$|E
25|$|Recorded {{settlements}} at {{the mouth}} of the Wear date to 674, when an Anglo-Saxon nobleman, Benedict Biscop, granted land by King Ecgfrith of Northumbria, founded the Wearmouth–Jarrow (St. Peter's) monastery on the north bank of the river – an area that became known as Monkwearmouth. Biscop's monastery was the first built of stone in Northumbria. He employed <b>glaziers</b> from France and in doing so he re-established glass making in Britain.|$|E
25|$|Ecgfrith of Northumbria granted Benedict land in 674 for {{the purpose}} of {{building}} a monastery. He went to the Continent to bring back masons who could build a monastery in the Pre-Romanesque style. Benedict made his fifth and final trip to Rome in 679 to bring back books for a library, saintly relics, stonemasons, <b>glaziers,</b> and a grant from Pope Agatho granting his monastery certain privileges. Benedict made five overseas voyages in all to stock the library.|$|E
40|$|A {{poet and}} <b>glazier,</b> Jan Vos (1610 - 1667) ran his own small <b>glazier</b> {{business}} in the Kalverstraat in Amsterdam. His careers as both poet and <b>glazier</b> converged in several ways. This article shows how Vos the poet portrayed himself as a <b>glazier</b> in his poems, while Vos the <b>glazier</b> profited from his reputation as (city) poet, as he used his poetry to obtain orders from the Amsterdam city government to install/replace window panes...|$|R

25|$|God, who {{according}} to Genesis, made the Heaven and the Earth, also created {{man in his}} own likeness and gave to humankind also the gift of creativity. It is a lesser theme that consistently runs through religious art. There are, in particular, and understandably, many depictions of stonemasons, woodcarvers, painters and <b>glaziers</b> at work. There are also countless depictions of monks, musicians and scribes. As well as these are shown spinners and weavers, merchants, cooks, carters, butchers, apothecaries, furriers, bullock drivers, fishermen and shepherds.|$|E
25|$|With the {{introduction}} of Christianity in the early 7th century and the building of ecclesiastical structures the amount of window glass also increased. Window glass, some of which was also coloured, has been identified at more than 17 sites, of which 12 are ecclesiastical. Hundreds of window glass fragments have been found at Jarrow, Wearmouth, Brandon, Whithorn and Winchester. This evidence supports the historical records, such as Bede’s account of Benedict Biscop’s importation of <b>glaziers</b> from Gaul to glaze {{the windows in the}} monastery at Wearmouth in AD 675.|$|E
50|$|Moreover, Hadamar is a centre for <b>glazier</b> training. The Federal {{vocational}} {{school of the}} <b>glazier’s</b> craft and the Erwin-Stein-Schule (state glass {{vocational school}}) are located here.

25|$|The {{last major}} {{components}} {{to be put}} into place were the sixteen semi-circular ribs of the vaulted transept, which were also the only major structural parts that were made of wood. These were raised into position as eight pairs, and all were fixed into place within a week. Thanks to the simplicity of Paxton's design and the combined efficiency of the building contractor and their suppliers, the entire structure was assembled with extraordinary speed—the team of 80 <b>glaziers</b> could fix more than 18,000 panes of sheet glass in a week—and the building was complete and ready to receive exhibits in just five months.|$|E

A frame bell cote topped with cast iron cross rises from the west end. The {{roofline}} is further pierced by a stone chimney on the north transept and several English Decorated Gothic stone crosses at junctions on the east end. All windows are either lancet or round-arched, with some having additional trefoils. The stained glass was done by Louis Comfort Tiffany's firm and the British <b>glaziers</b> Bell & Almond. Above the main entrance is a bronze lamp with a stone medallion of a bull, the symbol of St. Luke.|$|E

Suppose it was discovered that the little boy was actually hired by the <b>glazier,</b> and paid a franc for every window he broke. Suddenly the same act would be regarded as theft: the <b>glazier</b> was breaking windows in order to force people to hire his services. Yet the facts observed by the onlookers remain true: the <b>glazier</b> benefits from the business {{at the expense of the}} baker, the tailor, and so on.|$|R

2500|$|With {{the growth}} of {{industry}} in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, and in particular {{the growth of}} those industries associated with commercial glass production, metal trades, metallurgy and the associated technical advancements, the scene was set for the revival of stained glass manufacture and the development of that industry on an unprecedented scale. Thomas Willement, a plumber and glazier, produced his first armourial window in 1811, and is known as the father of the 19th-century stained glass industry. Because of the prevalence of leadlight windows, many <b>glaziers</b> had the required skills for making windows in geometric patterns using coloured glass for chapels and churches. [...] Between 1820 and 1840 some 40 different glass painters appear in the London trades directories.|$|E

The <b>glazier</b> thinks Michel is a dolt, and things often have to be repeated. Victor's family keeps arriving to interrupt the <b>glazier's</b> work, and Mme. Karl, the landlady, keeps inquiring as to whether Victor is staying or going. The Kraps want Victor to attend his father's funeral, but he is not interested in leaving his apartment. Mme.

Little of the original medieval glass, designed by Thomas Glazier, survives. A firm of <b>glaziers</b> in Shrewsbury was tasked with cleaning the glass in the 1820s. At that time there was no known process for cleaning the badly deteriorated glass and so it was copied, while most of the original glass was scattered or destroyed. Some pieces have been recovered.

2500|$|Paxton's roofing system {{incorporated}} his elegant {{solution to}} the problem of draining the building's vast roof area. Like the Chatsworth Lily House (but unlike its later incarnation at Sydnenham) most of the roof of the original Hyde Park structure had a horizontal profile, so heavy rain posed a potentially serious safety hazard. Because normal cast glass is brittle and has low tensile strength, there was a risk that the weight of any excess water build-up on the roof might have caused panes to shatter, showering shards of glass onto the patrons, ruining the valuable exhibits beneath, and weakening the structure. However, Paxton's ridge-and-furrow roof was designed to shed water very efficiently. Rain ran off the angled glass roof panes into U-shaped cast-iron channels which ran the length of each roof section at the bottom of the 'furrow'. These channels were ingeniously multifunctional - during construction, they served as the rails that supported and guided the trolleys on which the <b>glaziers</b> sat as they installed the roofing. Once completed, the channels acted both as the joists that supported the roof sections, and as guttering - a patented design now widely known as a [...] "Paxton gutter". These gutters conducted the rainwater to the ends of each furrow, where they emptied into the larger main gutters, which were set at right angles to the smaller gutters, along the top of the main horizontal roof bearers. These main gutters drained at either end into the cast iron pillars, which also had an ingenious dual function - each was cast with a hollow core, allowing it to double as a concealed down-pipe that carried the storm-water down into the drains beneath the building.|$|E
