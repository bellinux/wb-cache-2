25|$|Jamaican waters contain {{considerable}} {{resources of}} fresh-and saltwater fish. The chief varieties of saltwater fish are kingfish, jack, mackerel, whiting, bonito, and tuna. Fish that occasionally enter freshwater and estuarine environments include snook, jewfish, mangrove snapper, and mullets. Fish that spend {{the majority of}} their lives in Jamaica's fresh waters include many species of livebearers, killifish, <b>freshwater</b> <b>gobies,</b> the mountain mullet, and the American eel. Tilapia have been introduced from Africa for aquaculture, and are very common.|$|R
50|$|Over 3000 {{different}} types of fish have been recorded in Japan. Important freshwater fish include the ayu (Plecoglossus altivelis), crucian carp (Carassius carassius) and common carp (Cyprinus carpio). The common carp is the ancestor of the well-known domestic koi carp. Small freshwater fish include the pale chub, Japanese chub (Nipponocypris sieboldii) and several species of bitterling including the endangered rosy bitterling. The southern Ryukyu Islands are home to endemic species of colourful <b>freshwater</b> <b>gobies</b> in the genus Stiphodon.|$|R
40|$|Threats {{of water}} pollution, {{unregulated}} extraction of resources, and sprawling urbanization {{are some of}} the common issues of Mandulog River, a home for indigenous <b>freshwater</b> <b>gobies.</b> This study was conducted to assess the status of <b>freshwater</b> <b>gobies</b> and how the resident communities exert conservation efforts to the river and the inhabiting gobies. Standard method of collection of gobies was done. Interviews with semi-structured questionnaires were used to know the conservation measures of the residents. Ten goby species belonging to three families namely, Family Eleotridae (Belobranchus belobranchus), Giuris margaritacea, and Oxyeleotris lineolata, Family Gobiidae (Awaous melanocephalus), Awaous ocellaris, Glossogobius celebius, Glossogobius giuris, Periophthalmus barbarus and Sicyopterus lagocephalus, and Family Rhyacichthyidae (Rhyacichthys aspro), can be an alternative source of food and livelihood. They were caught by-catch, while employing some destructive fishing methods like cyanide fishing, electric fishing, and use of fine mesh nets. The awareness of the residents to the adverse impacts of water pollution, unregulated human activities, and destructive fishing had strengthened their conservation measures. A multi-stakeholder management approach is created through concerted proactive conservation measures like protection of the goby population, the river-riparian ecosystems, enhanced scientific information, and the legal intervention of the local government...|$|R
40|$|A {{new species}} of Sicyopterus, <b>freshwater</b> <b>goby,</b> is {{described}} from Sumatra and Java, Indonesia. It differs from other species belonging to the genus {{by a combination of}} characters including two lateral clefts on the crenulated upper lip, a second dorsal fin with one spine and 10 segmented rays, second and third rays of the first dorsal fin filamentous, more lateral, predorsal and transverse back scales, and a reddish caudal fin in male with a slight blue line on the upper and lower parts...|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} {{important}} to the native people as a food fish. In Ancient Hawaiʻi, this species, and others such as mullet and Kuhlia sandvicensis, were cultivated in a form of freshwater aquaponics or aquatic polyculture. In this system of farming, the taro in the upland paddies (taro being the primary staple in Ancient Hawaiʻi) was aided by the fish such as the Hawaiʻian <b>freshwater</b> <b>goby,</b> through these fish pruning the leaves and eating the pests, thus leading to a symbiotic system of food production.|$|R
40|$|The Hawaiian <b>freshwater</b> <b>goby</b> genus Lentipes is {{presently}} represented by two endemic species, L. concolor (Gill) and L. seminudus Gunther. The two species were investigated {{to define and}} compare their respective external and internal morphology. Ninety-eight specimens of Lentipes were gathered {{over a period of}} 11 years from 7 stream sites. Electrofishing was employed to capture these specimens. Examination of these two closely related species showed dissimilarities in scalation, dentition, coloration, head shape and dorsal fin spacing. The results from determination of sex showed all L. concolor to be male and all L. seminudus to be female. This evidence led to the hypothesis that the genus Lentipes is actually represented by only one species, L. concolor. This was substantiated by the findings of the investigation on the internal morphology. Employing an alizarin staining technique using trypsin and 2 % KOH, the fin ray arrangement, the vertebrae, the caudal skeleton, the suspensorium, the pectoral and pelvic girdles, the hyoid bar and the gill arches and gill rakers were found invariable within the species but comparatively different when contrasted against Sicydium stimpsoni, another endemic <b>freshwater</b> <b>goby</b> that coinhabits the streams with Lentipes. In addition, certain anatomical features were found manifest in the Lentipes food habits. Its omnivorous food habits are also influenced by size (age) and environment...|$|R
50|$|Mogurnda is a genus of <b>freshwater</b> sleeper <b>gobies</b> {{native to}} eastern and {{northern}} Australia and New Guinea. Several species are endemic to Lake Kutubu in Papua New Guinea.|$|R
25|$|Gobies are {{primarily}} fish of shallow marine habitats, including tide pools, coral reefs, and seagrass meadows; {{they are also}} very numerous in brackish water and estuarine habitats, including the lower reaches of rivers, mangrove swamps, and salt marshes. A small number of goby species (unknown exactly, but in the low hundreds) are also fully adapted to freshwater environments. These include the Asian river gobies (Rhinogobius spp.), the Australian desert goby (Chlamydogobius eremius), and the European <b>freshwater</b> <b>goby</b> Padogobius bonelli. Most gobies feed on small invertebrates, {{although some of the}} larger species eat other fish, and a few eat planktonic algae.|$|R
