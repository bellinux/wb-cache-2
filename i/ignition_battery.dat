40|$|The {{specifications}} for the Stand Alone Pressure Measurement Device (SAPMD) are as follows: the SAPMD shall measure ambient pressure {{at the surface}} of the Orbiter TPS in the range of 0 to 15 pounds per square inch absolute (PSIA). Measurement will begin at solid rocket booster (SRB) ignition as sensed by appropriate vibration sensing elements in the SAPMD. Pressure and corresponding real-time data are to be recorded every one tenth second for 140 seconds {{and at the end of}} the recording period, the operation will be discontinued with the data preserved for interrogation subsequent to Orbiter re-entry and landing. The type and size of the battery shall be such as to allow the vibration sensing elements and a real-time clock to be initialized a minimum of 30 day prior to launch and still provide power as necessary to perform the 140 second data recording period after SRB <b>ignition.</b> <b>Battery</b> installation shall be in such a manner as to allow battery replacement without removing the SAPMD from its position or removing more than one TPS tile. The SAPMD must be mounted in specific locations under tile of the TPS. To accommodate such mounting, the absolute maximum physical dimensions much not exceed 6. 0 inches in length, 1. 5 inches in width, and 0. 4 inches in height, and the device shall be of such configuration that it can be bonded to the Orbiter skin at the joint line of two TPS tiles with the pressure sensing port at {{the surface of the}} tile. The SAPMD must remain operational in the temperature range of - 40 to + 85 C and survive storage temperature of - 55 to + 125 C. The pressure port must withstand 934 C without causing damage to the TPS during entry and must remain functional at 262 C during ascent. The accuracy of the pressure measurement must be plus or minus one-half PSIA over a temperature range of 0 to + 36 C.

5000|$|Sparks {{to ignite}} the fuel mixture {{are created by}} either a spark plug or a device called an ignitor. When a spark plug is used, the spark was {{generated}} by either a magneto or else a trembler (or 'buzz') coil. A buzz coil uses battery power to generate a continuous series of high voltage pulses that are fed to the spark plug. For igniter <b>ignition,</b> either a <b>battery</b> and coil is used or a [...] "low tension" [...] magneto is used. With <b>battery</b> and coil <b>ignition,</b> a <b>battery</b> is wired in series with a wire coil and the igniter contacts. When the contacts of the ignitor are closed (the contacts reside inside the combustion chamber), electricity flows through the circuit. When the contacts are opened by the timing mechanism, a spark is generated across the contacts, which ignite the mixture. When a low tension magneto (really a low-voltage high-current generator) is used, {{the output of the}} magneto is fed directly to the igniter points and the spark is generated as with a battery and coil.|$|R
50|$|In time, the {{trembler}} coil {{system was}} seen as obsolete and was replaced, first by the ignition magneto and later by Kettering's <b>battery</b> <b>ignition</b> system, using <b>battery,</b> coil and contact breaker. These systems used a single ignition coil for the engine, supplying the spark to each cylinder in turn. A device called the distributor (previously used with magnetos) was used to switch the high-voltage current to each plug in turn. The high voltage distributor evolved from the timer and it too was a rotary switch driven at camshaft speed. The first high voltage distributors likewise used a wiping-contact, but as the current was at such a high voltage, these gave trouble with arcing and erosion of the contacts leading to a poor connection. It was realised that a jump-spark distributor would work equally well at high voltages and would be less susceptible to problems from erosion.|$|R
50|$|Company {{executives}} {{quickly realized}} that great profit could be made supplying electrical gear for the growing automobile market. Vesta expanded into the production of generators, <b>ignition</b> <b>batteries,</b> headlights, lamps, and lighting. By 1902, the company needed a larger space to manufacture its products. Vesta relocated to 266 State Street, but only remained for three years until they decided to split office and manufacturing into separate facilities. In 1905, the company built a general office opened at 1336 Michigan Boulevard while they leased factory space at 1521 Wabash Avenue. These buildings {{were part of the}} emerging Motor Row District, a stretch of buildings from Wabash to Indiana Avenues from 12th Street to 26th Street.When the company again needed additional space, Vesta purchased the Mt. Sinai Temple on the southwest corner of 21st Street and Indiana Avenue. The temple was demolished, and in its place, Vesta built a four-story factory, the first built to the company's specifications. Chicago architect Carl M. Almquist was commissioned to design the building. All operations were again consolidated into the $80,000 building; offices were on the first floor while factory operations were in the basement and upper two stories. Vesta moved in in 1913. The rear of the building featured a service station where customers could bring their automobiles to have the batteries serviced. Vesta became a regional leader in battery production and produced the first battery-supplied electrical lighting for commercial trucks.|$|R
