5|$|Although he {{was never}} a {{vigorous}} apologist for that tradition, he always maintained the standards of clarity and rigour which it prizes, and <b>his</b> <b>work</b> <b>is</b> a model {{of all that is}} best in the tradition.

5|$|The major {{substantive}} {{criticisms of}} Satin's work have remained constant over time.

His ideas have also occasionally been seen as not politically serious, or as non-political {{in the sense of}} not being capable of challenging existing power structures. <b>His</b> <b>work</b> <b>is</b> sometimes said to be largely borrowed from others, a charge that first surfaced with regard to his draft dodger manual, and was repeated to varying degree by critics of his books on New Age politics and radical centrism.|$|E
5|$|The {{philosophy}} {{and principles of}} Tulsidas are found across his works, and are especially outlined in the dialogue between Kakbhushundi and Garuda in the Uttar Kand of the Ramcharitmanas.

5|$|Wong {{stated that}} most people take for granted what they possess, and may be without {{identity}} or culture.

A thread that runs through much of <b>his</b> <b>work</b> <b>is</b> therefore the notion of home, homelessness and wandering. Since 2011, his repertoire {{has taken on a}} political dimension.|$|E
