She told NPR that when an ivory dealer wants to obtain ivory, the most sensible way {{to do so is}} not to go hunting, which carries many risks, but to [...] "raid a stockpile by bribing the <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> the key".

500|$|Within a {{few weeks}} Killen sent a rough draft of the script to his agent, Marc Korman. Korman phoned Salke, calling the script [...] "remarkable" [...] and praising Killen: [...] "...for a <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> never written a {{procedural}} show in his life", he was [...] "making two cases work." [...] Initially, Salke and Korman hoped to sell acquisition rights to other networks (including Fox). Although it successfully made {{its way into the}} lower executive branches of the company, the script was ultimately declined by Fox entertainment president Kevin Reilly. Gary Newman, chairman of 20th Century Fox Television, opted not to develop a deal with cable-television networks. Believing it should be a broadcast-network show, he did not accept the idea that the difference between cable and network dramas was their degree of intelligence.|$|E

NBC had encouraged Killen to conceive a concept for a future television series after Lone Star cancellation. Within a few weeks, Killen sent a rough draft of the script to his agent Marc Korman. [...] "It was 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning, and I remember I was so freaked out by the script that I went upstairs to our guest bedroom where my wife was sick with the flu and I got into bed with her," [...] recalled Korman. [...] "I called Jen and said: 'I'm telling you, this script is remarkable. I've never read a pilot like this, and for a <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> never written a procedural show in his life, he's actually making two cases work". Initially, Salke and Korman looked to sell acquisition rights to Fox.|$|E

Luna, Jansen, Whitehead, and Birdsell reprise their roles from {{earlier in the}} series. When asked whether the series still wanted to pursue stories about Inhumans such as James, Whedon said they are [...] "still in our world, so we still have {{some of these people}} in the mix ... but right now we’re on the Ghost Rider kick." [...] On having Johnson and Reyes join up with S.H.I.E.L.D., Whedon called it uneasy [...] "for everyone involved. Daisy has {{made it very clear that}} she doesn’t want to be with our team. There’s all that history and pain there. For Robbie, this is a <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> never had a team, and probably doesn’t function well within one. We’ll see pretty quickly that it’s an uneasy alliance and it’s going to cause a lot of drama." ...|$|E

500|$|Many {{aspects of}} Guevara's {{personality}} and beliefs affected the filming process. For instance, close-ups of Del Toro were avoided due to Guevara's belief in collectivism, with Soderbergh remarking, [...] "You can't {{make a movie}} about a <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> these hard-core sort of egalitarian socialist principles and then isolate him with close-ups." [...] According to Edgar Ramirez, who portrays Ciro Redondo, the cast [...] "were improvising a lot" [...] while making The Argentine, and he describes the project as a [...] "very contemplative movie", shot chronologically. While filming outdoors, Soderbergh used natural light as much as possible. Del Toro, who speaks Puerto Rican Spanish, tried to speak the best Argentinean Spanish (Rioplatense Spanish) he could without sounding [...] "stiff". Prior to shooting the film's final scenes that depict Guevara's time in Bolivia {{at the end of}} his life, Del Toro shed 35 pounds to show how ill Guevara had become. The actor shaved the top of his head rather than wear a bald cap for the scenes depicting Guevara's arrival in Bolivia in disguise.|$|E
500|$|To help refresh the show, {{several new}} writers were hired, {{including}} Greenstein, Joe Keenan, who {{also served as}} an executive producer, and Bob Daily, {{who was also a}} producer. Daily commented, [...] "When we came on in season three, the mandate was to bring the show back to its roots. That meant having plotlines spring from relatable experiences, no matter how operatic or convoluted." [...] For the season's main mystery, Cherry and the writers wanted to incorporate more of the series' regular characters rather than bringing in various new ones, like they had done in the second season with Betty Applewhite (Alfre Woodard) and her family. They developed the Orson plot line around the [...] "idea that one of our women marries a <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> dark secrets and possibly a violent streak." [...] Cherry opined: [...] "I thought there was something exciting about that, but real and relatable." [...] Greenstein commented that the writers worked backwards from the second season's cliffhangers to develop the Orson storyline, forsaking the original material that had been developed earlier. The cast responded positively to the new material for the season.|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} of FutureSex/LoveSounds, Ben Williams of New York cited the album's first five tracks, {{including}} [...] "FutureSex/LoveSound", as updating the early 1980s Minneapolis sound: [...] "tense drum machines, high-pitched synth squiggles and staccato funk bass lines". While reviewing the album, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic noted that the first three songs of the album include the word [...] "sex" [...] in their titles, [...] "as if mere repetition of the word will magically conjure a sex vibe, when in truth it has the opposite effect: it makes it seem that Justin is singing about it because he's not getting it." [...] Lucy Davies of BBC Music stated that it is initially [...] "difficult {{to listen to the}} lyrics of the opening tracks and give an objective opinion". She wrote that it is like Timberlake is [...] "trying to find redeemable qualities about some <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> zero social skills and stares at women on his own from the corner of a bar. Only he seems to have found some similarly unreconstructed creepy friends shouting words of encouragement to his clunky chat-up lines, like Timbaland".|$|E

Within a few weeks, Killen sent a rough draft of the script to his agent Marc Korman. Korman was so impressed by the script that, though it was after midnight, he went into the room where his sick wife was sleeping, and got into bed with her.

The following month, {{it was announced that}} Sebastian Gregory had joined the cast of Neighbours as [...] "maths genius" [...] Ed Lee, Natasha's new love interest. Shortly after she drops out of her arts course at university, Natasha meets Ed in Charlie's. She initially believes he is trying to ask her out on a date, but is embarrassed when she realises that she has misread the signals. Natasha apologises and offers to help him out with a difficult maths equation he has been trying to solve. A writer for All About Soap explained [...] "judgemental Ed dismisses her, assuming the waitress hasn't got much in the brains department!". Natasha solves Ed's equation, proving him wrong and forcing him to apologise to her. Ed then invites Natasha to attend a university maths club, but she leaves at the last minute [...] "refusing to be labelled a nerd." [...] Natasha, Andrew and Ed make an anti-gambling phone app using a maths probability theory and Natasha develops feelings for Ed. While they are celebrating the completion of the phone app, Natasha and Ed embrace and almost share a kiss. However, the moment is ruined when Andrew calls Natasha.

Comic Book <b>Guy,</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> styled himself as a villain called [...] "The Collector", kidnaps her using a magnet to attract her metal breast plate. Lawless tries to remove the breastplate but stops after she notices that her horny nerd fans have cameras ready. The Collector takes her to his lair, where he puts her in an aluminized PET film bag for [...] "safekeeping" [...] and imprisons her in a room of other similarly-captured celebrities. Stretch Dude and Clobber Girl then enter the fray {{in an attempt to}} free Xena, but they are soon captured as well. The Collector suspends the duo over a vat of [...] "Lucite". After feigning interest in the villain, Lawless starts clobbering him. The Collector grabs his limited edition double edged lightsaber from [...] (which was released a few months before the episode) and ignites the blades, but when Lawless reminds him that he has removed it from its original packaging, he panics and ends up falling into the Lucite. Lawless then flies the children home (Lisa points out that Xena cannot fly, but Lawless reminds her she's not Xena, she's Lucy Lawless).|$|E

500|$|With {{the idea}} of Star Treks genesis in mind, the central story became Cochrane's warp drive test and humanity's first contact. Drawing on clues from {{previous}} Star Trek episodes, Cochrane was placed in mid-21st century Montana, where humans recover from a devastating world war. In the first script with this setting, the Borg attack Cochrane's lab, leaving the scientist comatose; Picard assumes Cochrane's place to continue the warp test and restore history. In this draft Picard has a love interest in the local photographer Ruby, while Riker leads {{the fight against the}} Borg on the Enterprise. Another draft included John de Lancie's omnipotent character Q. Looking at the early scripts, the trio knew that serious work was needed. [...] "It just didn't make sense [...] that Picard, the one <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> a history with the Borg, never meets them," [...] Braga recalled. Riker and Picard's roles were swapped, and the planetside story was shortened and told differently. Braga and Moore focused the new arc on Cochrane himself, making the ideal future of Star Trek come from a flawed man. The idea of Borg fighting among period costumes coalesced into a [...] "Dixon Hill" [...] holographic novel sequence on the holodeck. The second draft, titled Star Trek: Resurrection, was judged complete enough that the production team used it to plan expenses. The film was given a budget of $45million, [...] "considerably more" [...] than Generations $35million price tag; this allowed the production to plan a larger amount of action and special effects.|$|E
