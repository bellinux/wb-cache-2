5|$|Placement {{of dental}} {{implants}} is a surgical procedure and carries the normal risks of surgery including infection, excessive bleeding and necrosis of the flap of tissue around the <b>implant.</b> Nearby anatomic structures, {{such as the}} inferior alveolar nerve, the maxillary sinus and blood vessels, can also be injured when the osteotomy is created or the <b>implant</b> placed. Even when {{the lining of the}} maxillary sinus is perforated by an <b>implant,</b> long term sinusitis is rare. An inability to place the <b>implant</b> in bone to provide stability of the <b>implant</b> (referred to as primary stability of the <b>implant)</b> increases the risk of failure to osseointegration.|$|E
5|$|Primary <b>implant</b> {{stability}} {{refers to}} the stability of a dental <b>implant</b> immediately after implantation. The stability of the titanium screw <b>implant</b> in the patient's bone tissue post surgery may be non-invasively assessed using resonance frequency analysis. Sufficient initial stability may allow immediate loading with prosthetic reconstruction, though early loading poses {{a higher risk of}} <b>implant</b> failure than conventional loading.|$|E
5|$|An <b>implant</b> {{is tested}} between 8 and 24 weeks to {{determine}} if it is integrated. There is significant variation in the criteria used to determine <b>implant</b> success, the most commonly cited criteria at the <b>implant</b> level are the absence of pain, mobility, infection, gingival bleeding, radiographic lucency or peri-implant bone loss greater than 1.5mm.|$|E

30|$|The {{proportion}} of patients {{found to have}} uterine <b>implants</b> was overwhelming, occurring in 93 % of subjects. The women who {{were found to have}} uterine <b>implants</b> also had adhesions that affected other pelvic organs. It was found that 39 % of patients had posterior uterine <b>implants</b> only, 2 % had anterior <b>implants</b> only, 20 % had both anterior and posterior uterine <b>implants,</b> and 32 % had uterine <b>implants</b> that were not designated as anterior or posterior. Thus, a total of 93 % had uterine endometriotic <b>implants.</b> Additionally, there were 62 % of patients with ovarian <b>implants,</b> 51 % with posterior cul-de-sac disease <b>implants,</b> and 44 % with fallopian tube involvement. Forty-five percent had abdominal wall spread, 8 % with large bowel <b>implants,</b> and 13 % with small bowel involvement. Fifty percent had uterosacral <b>implants,</b> 2 % with bladder involvement, 2 % with perihepatic involvement, and 4 % with omental <b>implants.</b> There was one patient with a prior history of endometriosis that had no endometriotic lesions identified {{at the time of her}} laparoscopy.|$|R
5|$|An <b>implant</b> {{supported}} bridge (or fixed denture) is a {{group of}} teeth secured to dental implants so the prosthetic cannot be removed by the user. Bridges typically connect to more than one <b>implant</b> and may also connect to teeth as anchor points. Typically the number of teeth will outnumber the anchor points with the teeth that are directly over the implants referred to as abutments and those between abutments referred to as pontics. <b>Implant</b> supported bridges attach to <b>implant</b> abutments {{in the same way as}} a single tooth <b>implant</b> replacement. A fixed bridge may replace as few as two teeth (also known as a fixed partial denture) and may extend to replace an entire arch of teeth (also known as a fixed full denture). In both cases, the prosthesis is said to be fixed because it cannot be removed by the denture wearer.|$|E
5|$|For an <b>implant</b> {{to become}} {{permanently}} stable, the body must grow bone {{to the surface}} of the <b>implant</b> (osseointegration). Based on this biologic process, it was thought that loading an <b>implant</b> during the osseointegration period would result in movement that would prevent osseointegration, and thus increase <b>implant</b> failure rates. As a result, three to six months of integrating time (depending on various factors) was allowed before placing the teeth on implants (restoring them).|$|E
5|$|However, later {{research}} suggests that the initial stability of the <b>implant</b> in bone is a more important determinant of success of <b>implant</b> integration, rather than a certain period of healing time. As a result, the time allowed to heal is typically based on the density of bone the <b>implant</b> is placed in and the number of implants splinted together, rather than a uniform amount of time. When implants can withstand high torque (35 Ncm) and are splinted to other implants, there are no meaningful differences in long-term <b>implant</b> survival or bone loss between implants loaded immediately, at three months, or at six months. The corollary is that single implants, even in solid bone, require a period of no-load to minimize the risk of initial failure.|$|E
30|$|Dental <b>implants</b> {{have become}} {{increasingly}} popular, and {{a considerable number of}} people have undergone dental restorations using dental <b>implants.</b> Therefore, there will be an increasing probability of patients with dental <b>implants</b> receiving irradiation around their <b>implants.</b> Further studies are required to analyze whether dental <b>implants</b> located in the radiation field cause adverse effects in the long term.|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{the present}} study was to explore the effects of {{long-term}} hormone deprivation on the ability of subsequent estrogen replacement to affect cognition. Female rats, 12 months of age, underwent ovariectomies (n � 30) or sham surgeries (n � 10). Intact rats and 20 ovariectomized rats received cholesterol <b>implants.</b> Ten ovariectomized rats received <b>implants</b> containing 25 % estradiol. Five months later, <b>implants</b> were replaced.

40|$|Dental <b>implants</b> {{provide a}} {{restorative}} tool to support crowns, bridge abutments, and removable dentures. Osseointegrated <b>implants</b> are titanium posts that are surgically <b>implanted</b> in alveolar bone. A tight immobile bond (osseointegration) forms between bone and titanium, and prosthetic and restorative fixtures {{are attached to}} the <b>implants.</b> Titanium <b>implants</b> differ from natural teeth, which may make them more susceptible to mechanical stress. A small proportion of <b>implants</b> are not successful and may fail due to infection. The microbiota of <b>implants</b> {{is similar to that of}} teeth in similar clinical states. <b>Implants</b> that fail because of mechanical stress are colonized by species associated with healthy teeth. Infected <b>implants</b> are colonized by subgingival species, including Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroides forsythus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Campylobacter gracilis, Streptococcus intermedius, and Peptostreptococcus micros. Different patients may be colonized by different microbial complexes, indicating that optimal treatment should be directed to the specific infection. Osseointegrated dental <b>implants</b> are a major tool in prosthetic a support for a prosthesis. <b>Implants</b> are surgically placed in bone, which, for one-stage <b>implants,</b> leaves part of the implantdentistry and are used to support many different configurations of tooth replacements ranging from single teeth to full dentures in direct contact with the oral cavity. For two-stage <b>implants...</b>|$|R
5|$|Immediate post-extraction <b>implant</b> placement.|$|E
5|$|Placement of the implant: The <b>implant</b> screw {{is placed}} {{and can be}} self-tapping, {{otherwise}} the prepared site is tapped with an <b>implant</b> analog. It is then screwed into place with a torque controlled wrench at a precise torque {{so as not to}} overload the surrounding bone (overloaded bone can die, a condition called osteonecrosis, which may lead to failure of the <b>implant</b> to fully integrate or bond with the jawbone).|$|E
5|$|Root form implants; {{the most}} common type of <b>implant</b> {{indicated}} for all uses. Within the root form type of <b>implant,</b> there are roughly 18 variants, all made of titanium but with different shapes and surface textures. There is limited evidence showing that implants with relatively smooth surfaces are less prone to peri-implantitis than implants with rougher surfaces and no evidence showing that any particular type of dental <b>implant</b> has superior long-term success.|$|E
50|$|Cortical <b>implants</b> have a {{wide variety}} of {{potential}} uses, ranging from restoring vision to blind patients or helping patients suffering from dementia. With the complexity of the brain, the possibilities for these brain <b>implants</b> to expand their usefulness are nearly endless. Some early work in cortical <b>implants</b> involved stimulation of the visual cortex, using <b>implants</b> made from silicone rubber. Since then, <b>implants</b> have developed into more complex devices using new polymers, such as polyimide. There are two ways that cortical <b>implants</b> can interface with the brain, either intracortically (direct) or epicortically (indirect). Intracortical <b>implants</b> have electrodes that penetrate into the brain, while epicortical <b>implants</b> have electrodes that stimulate along the surface. Epicortical <b>implants</b> mainly record field potentials around them and are generally more flexible compared to their intracortical counterparts. Since the intracortical <b>implants</b> go deeper into the brain, they require a stiffer electrode. However, due to micromotion in the brain, some flexibility is necessary in order to prevent injury to the brain tissue.|$|R
50|$|Cochlear <b>implants</b> (CIs), {{auditory}} {{brain stem}} <b>implants</b> (ABIs), and auditory midbrain <b>implants</b> (AMIs) {{are the three}} main categories for auditory prostheses. CI electrode arrays are <b>implanted</b> in the cochlea, ABI electrode arrays stimulate the cochlear nucleus complex in the lower brain stem, and AMIs stimulates auditory neurons in the inferior colliculus. Cochlear <b>implants</b> have been very successful among these three categories. Today the Advanced Bionics Corporation, the Cochlear Corporation and the Med-El Corporation are the major commercial providers of cochlea <b>implants.</b>|$|R
40|$|Over a 3 -year period (1976 - 1978), heifer calves either {{were not}} <b>implanted</b> or were <b>implanted</b> between 2 and 5 months of age. In 1977, {{the study also}} {{included}} heifers <b>implanted</b> at birth. <b>Implanting</b> at birth increased the percentage of heifers open as yearlings. More <b>implanted</b> heifers tended to be open as 2 - to 5 -year-olds than control heifers, but the differences were not statistically significant. <b>Implanting</b> of the heifers {{had no effect on}} weight gains of their calves...|$|R
5|$|Soft tissue reflection: An {{incision}} is {{made over}} the crest of bone, splitting the thicker attached gingiva roughly in half so that the final <b>implant</b> will have a thick band of tissue around it. The edges of tissue, each {{referred to as a}} flap are pushed back to expose the bone. Flapless surgery is an alternate technique, where a small punch of tissue (the diameter of the <b>implant)</b> is removed for <b>implant</b> placement rather than raising flaps.|$|E
5|$|The gingiva {{surrounding}} a tooth has a 2–3mm band of bright pink, very strong attached mucosa, then a darker, larger area of unattached mucosa that folds into the cheeks. When replacing a tooth with an <b>implant,</b> {{a band of}} strong, attached gingiva is {{needed to keep the}} <b>implant</b> healthy in the long-term. This is especially important with implants because the blood supply is more precarious in the gingiva {{surrounding a}}n <b>implant,</b> and is theoretically more susceptible to injury because of a longer attachment to the <b>implant</b> than on a tooth (a longer biologic width).|$|E
5|$|The {{platform}} {{between the}} <b>implant</b> and the abutment can be flat (buttress) or conical fit. In conical fit abutments, {{the collar of}} the abutment sits inside the <b>implant</b> which allows a stronger junction between <b>implant</b> and abutment and a better seal against bacteria into the <b>implant</b> body. To improve the gingival seal around the abutment collar, a narrowed collar on the abutment is used, referred to as platform switching. The combination of conical fits and platform switching gives marginally better long term periodontal conditions compared to flat-top abutments.|$|E

50|$|In 2016 Norman Sharp, a 91 {{year old}} British man, was {{recognised}} {{as having the}} world's oldest hip replacement <b>implants.</b> The two vitallium <b>implants</b> were <b>implanted</b> in November 1948 at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, under the newly formed NHS. The 67 year old <b>implants</b> had such an unusually long life, partly because they had not required the typical replacement of such <b>implants,</b> {{but also because of}} Mr Sharp's young age of 23 when they were <b>implanted,</b> owing to a childhood case of septic arthritis.|$|R
40|$|It is {{generally}} believed that longer <b>implants</b> (length > 13 mm) have higher success rates than standard <b>implants</b> (length= 13 mm). Few reports focus on long <b>implants</b> and none specifically address the clinical outcome of immediate loading (IL) of longer <b>implants.</b> This retrospective study {{was performed to}} compare the clinical outcomes of long and standard length <b>implants.</b> A total of 244 standard and 536 long <b>implants</b> were inserted and immediately loaded. The mean follow-up was 3 years. Only 4 of 780 <b>implants</b> (99. 5 %) were lost, and these 4 were all 13 mm long. No or reduced marginal bone loss was taken as an additional indicator of success to evaluate the effect of several factors on clinical outcome. Only 4 of the 244 13 -mm-long <b>implants</b> were lost (98 %), but this was statistically different from the survival rate of longer <b>implants.</b> Poor quality bone was related to increased marginal bone loss and thus a worse outcome in both groups. IL standard length <b>implants</b> have a high survival rate, but it is statistically worse than that of IL longer <b>implants.</b> Standard or longer <b>implants</b> are reliable devices for insertion in poor quality bone, although slightly higher bone resorption is to be expected...|$|R
5|$|The {{relevance}} of primary <b>implant</b> stability decreases gradually with regrowth of bone tissue around the <b>implant</b> {{in the first}} weeks after surgery, leading to secondary stability. Secondary stability {{is different from the}} initial stabilization, because it results from the ongoing process of bone regrowth into the <b>implant</b> (osseointegration). When this healing process is complete, the initial mechanical stability becomes biological stability. Primary stability is critical to implantation success until bone regrowth maximizes mechanical and biological support of the <b>implant.</b> Regrowth usually occurs during the 3–4 weeks after implantation. Insufficient primary stability, or high initial <b>implant</b> mobility, can lead to failure.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, for an <b>implant</b> to look esthetic, {{a band of}} full, plump gingiva {{is needed}} {{to fill in the}} space on either side of <b>implant.</b> The most common soft tissue {{complication}} is called a black-triangle, where the papilla (the small triangular piece of tissue between two teeth) shrinks back and leaves a triangular void between the <b>implant</b> and the adjacent teeth. Dentists can only expect 2–4mm of papilla height over the underlying bone. A black triangle can be expected if the distance between where the teeth touch and bone is any greater.|$|E
5|$|After an <b>implant</b> is placed, the {{internal}} components {{are covered with}} either a healing abutment, or a cover screw. A healing abutment passes through the mucosa, and the surrounding mucosa is adapted around it. A cover screw is {{flush with the surface}} of the dental <b>implant,</b> and is designed to be completely covered by mucosa. After an integration period, a second surgery is required to reflect the mucosa and place a healing abutment.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} course of {{patients}} treated with tilted <b>implants</b> versus those treated conventionally with axial <b>implants,</b> analyzing the success rate and marginal bone loss. Material and M ethods: A PubMed search was made using the key words ?tilted <b>implants?,</b> ?angled <b>implants?,</b> ?angulated <b>implants?,</b> ?inclined <b>implants?</b> and ?maxillary atrophy. ? A review {{was made of the}} articles published between 1999 - 2010. The inclusion criteria were the use of tilted <b>implants,</b> clinical series involving at least 10 patients, and a minimum follow-up of 12 months after prosthetic loading. The exclusion criteria were isolated clinical cases, studies with missing data, and publications in languages other than English or Spanish. The metaanalysis finally included 13 articles: 7 retrospective studies and 6 prospective studies. Results: On analyzing the success rate in the retrospective studies, two reported a higher success rate with tilted implants; one a higher success rate with axial implants; and two reported similar success rates with both <b>implants.</b> On analyzing the success rate in the prospective studies, two reported a higher success rate with tilted implants; two a higher success rate with axial implants; and two reported similar success rates with both <b>implants.</b> On examining marginal bone loss, three studies reported greater bone loss with axial <b>implants</b> and one with tilted <b>implants.</b> Conclusions: There was no evidence of differences in success rate between tilted and axial <b>implants</b> in either the prospective or retrospective studies subjected to review. The marginal bone loss observed with the tilted and axial <b>implants</b> likewise proved very similar. It thus can be deduced that tilted <b>implants</b> exhibit the same evolutive behavior as axial <b>implants...</b>|$|R

5|$|For an <b>implant</b> to osseointegrate, {{it needs}} to be {{surrounded}} by a healthy quantity of bone.

5|$|In {{compound}} implants (two stage implants), {{between the}} actual <b>implant</b> and the superstructure (abutment) are gaps and cavities into which bacteria can penetrate from the oral cavity. Later these bacteria will return into the adjacent tissue {{and can cause}} periimplantitis. As prophylaxis these <b>implant</b> interior spaces should be sealed.|$|E
30|$|Effects of the inter-implant {{distance}} between platform-switched <b>implants</b> have been reported.
