Several board members of Everton {{were members of the}} Liberal Party who were associated with the National Temperance Federation whilst <b>Houlding</b> <b>was</b> a Conservative Party member and a brewer whose business interests were diametrically opposed to the temperance movement. Politics and disputes over money meant that <b>Houlding</b> <b>was</b> increasingly at odds {{with other members of the}} Everton board. The result was that in 1892 the Everton directors vacated Anfield and purchased a new ground at Goodison Park on the other side of Stanley Park.

40|$|Abstract: Genetic {{diversity}} {{is one of}} three levels of biological diversity requiring conservation. Genetic theory predicts that levels of genetic variation should increase with effective population size. Sould (19 76) compiled the first convincing evidence that levels of genetic variation in wildlife were related to population size, but this issue remains controversial. The hypothesis that genetic variation is related to population size leads to the following predictions: (1) genetic variation within species <b>hould</b> <b>be</b> related to population size; (2) genetic variation within species <b>hould</b> <b>be</b> related to island size; (3) genetic variation should be related to population size within taxonomic groups; (4) widespread species hould have more genetic variation than restricted spe-cies; (5) genetic variation in animals should be negatively correlated with body size; (6) genetic variation should be negatively correlated with rate of chromosome volution; (7) genetic variation across species should be related to population size; (8) vertebrates should have less genetic variation than invertebrates or plants; (9) island populations hould have less genetic variation than mainland populations; and (10) en-dangered species hould have less genetic variation than nonendangered species. Empirical observations sup-port all these hypotheses. There {{can be no doubt that}} genetic variation is related to population size, as Sould proposed. Small population size reduces the evolutionary potential of wildlife species. La Relaci 6 n Entre la Variacion Gen~tica y el Tamafio Poblacional en Vida Silvestr...|$|R
