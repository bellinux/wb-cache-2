40|$|MBA 2013 ABSTRACT Historically, a main theme {{behind the}} roles of <b>engineering</b> <b>consultants</b> has been the {{constant}} adaptation to the progressive requirements of their clients. It therefore stands that {{the roles of}} <b>engineering</b> <b>consultants</b> require constant reevaluation {{to ensure that they}} are up to date with clients’ needs today. This study, based in the context of southern African power systems, aims to identify and evaluate the key roles required from <b>engineering</b> <b>consultants.</b> An online and paper survey was presented to clients, of <b>engineering</b> <b>consultants,</b> to evaluate {{the extent to which they}} have; currently, and intend to use, the services of <b>engineering</b> <b>consultants</b> in key roles. The study statistically compared the current and intended uses of 22 roles using the technique of depended t-tests and non-parametric related tests. These tests revealed statistically significant positive differences between the current and intended uses of consultants in all roles, each of which indicated greater intended future use. The study found that while the traditional roles, like specialist ability and accountability, were not being threatened, roles which were considered new to the field were growing at a higher rate. In addition, while clients indicated higher overall use of consultants in future, public sector clients revealed higher use than private clients. In summary, advisory and technical roles remain key for clients in the short term, however, staff issues such as retention and training are growing concerns for clients which need to be addressed by consultants. The trend reveals <b>engineering</b> <b>consultants</b> requiring the establishment of a more holistic, customer oriented approach to serving client needs...|$|R

25|$|Larocque {{spent the}} long winter {{in a nearby}} workshop, {{carefully}} supervising the assembly of the arches that were to form the domed roof. The 12 main arches were supplemented by 24 secondary ones and 72 smaller arches. His work also aroused some interest from Ottawa since the blueprints had failed to earn a permit, and more generally {{because he was not}} a registered architect. When they heard construction had begun nonetheless, they tried to have the work stopped. Bishop Paul Piché hired an <b>engineering</b> <b>consultant</b> to visit the building, who told him it was sturdy enough to last another 200 years.|$|E

Then, he proceeded to do by writing a series of articles for the Engineering News Record, which were published in winter 1925, then as a small book in 1926. He found the facilities at MIT abominable and had to deal with obstruction from the administration. Brushing the obstacles aside, he once more set up a new laboratory geared towards making measurements on soils with instruments of his own devising. He entered a new phase of prolific publication and a rapidly growing and lucrative involvement as an <b>engineering</b> <b>consultant</b> on many large-scale projects.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{his newfound}} enthusiasm for {{hovercraft}} Maddock remained {{connected to the}} auto racing world long after his departure from Cooper. Initially, on leaving Cooper Maddock was co-opted as a freelance <b>engineering</b> <b>consultant</b> by Bruce McLaren and Teddy Mayer's new Bruce McLaren Motor Racing team. In addition to providing detailing for McLaren's 1964 Tasman Series Cooper T70 cars, Maddock was heavily involved {{in the design of}} the first true McLaren racing car: the McLaren M1A sports car of 1964. He worked on many aspect of the car's design, but perhaps his most lasting contribution to the future success of McLaren in sports car racing was his design for the McLaren four-spoke cast racing wheel. This wheel was exceptionally stiff, the best available at the time, and would go on to become something of a hallmark of McLaren racing cars in many different series over the following decade.|$|E

In 1904, {{as a result of}} experiments conducted on Edison effect bulbs imported from the United States, he developed a device he called an [...] "oscillation valve" [...] (because it passes current in only one direction). The heated filament, or cathode, was capable of thermionic emission of electrons that would flow to the plate (or anode) when it was at a positive voltage with respect to the cathode. Electrons, however, could not pass in the reverse direction because the plate was not heated and thus not capable of thermionic emission of electrons.|$|E
2500|$|In his {{professional}} {{role as a}} freelance <b>engineering</b> <b>consultant</b> Maddock was also involved in hovercraft design. In 1967 he was commissioned by the John Player & Sons cigarette company to design and build a prototype racing hovercraft. The craft appeared {{later in the year}} as the Player's No. 6 Prototype, driven by young female driver Sarah Mayhew, [...] "hover girl". The No.6 Prototype was designed to be simple and cheap to construct, intended to encourage amateur home-builders to attempt to construct their own hovercraft using its design. Maddock lightly modified and productionised the Player's No. 6 design for CanaHover Ltd. of Ottawa, Canada. They sold two versions of their Hoverover: a tandem two-seat recreational model, and a single-seat freight carrying model.|$|E
