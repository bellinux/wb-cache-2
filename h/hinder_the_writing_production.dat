40|$|Towards a {{linguistic}} modeling of writing models {{of high school}} learners writers Abstract Focusing on writing from a didactic aspect is to present it as a complex activity that requires the mobilization of much knowledge and a multitude of procedures. Writing represents a language phenomenon, it becomes a language in the fullest sense and a new order of language practices is established that some call it scriptural (Peytard 1970 Dabène 1987). Our purpose is to analyze the final product, {{the result of the}} editorial process (SC Thomas, 2000). In fact, we present the study and analysis of a corpus which presents <b>the</b> <b>written</b> <b>productions</b> of High school learners that reflect their actual skills. It is a question of observing the linguistic modeling required for <b>the</b> learners' <b>written</b> <b>productions</b> that rely on relevant parameters of semantics, cognitive psychology (Fayol, 1996) and the socio-cultural dimension (Dabène 1996). Do these processes, practiced by learners writers, provide a guarantee of success valuing a <b>written</b> <b>production?</b> We then examine the transposition of models mentioned in <b>the</b> <b>written</b> <b>productions</b> and configurations of writers with regard to their scripts. Finally, we conclude with the clarification of editorial measures offering insight into writing as a recursive activity evolving through the support models that require recurrences depending on the nature of <b>the</b> <b>written</b> <b>production.</b> Educational recommendations, based on all observations are advanced to locate the practical framework of learners/writers writing activities.

Il s'agit d'observer les modélisations linguistiques requises pour les productions écrites par des apprenants scripteurs. Nous examinerons ensuite la transposition des modélisations évoquées dans les productions écrites et les configurations des scripteurs à l'égard de leur écrit.

As análises mostram que a escrita do gênero Histórias de Família oferece uma riqueza de dados importantes para se pensar em uma metodologia de ensino voltada para a produção de conhecimentos significativos e uma educação humana mais ampla. Promove a interação com a família e desperta a responsabilidade com as atividades de linguagem, uma vez que a palavra escrita é vista como um trabalho e socializada com interlocutores reais: a família e os leitores das narrativas.

40|$|Writing is a {{skill that}} helps English as Foreign Language (EFL) {{learners}} improve their English and also helps them to be exposed more to use English in their day-to-day basis. Unfortunately, writing has been considered as one difficult and boring subject since the learners are merely instructed to write about certain topics or write their daily experiences and past events without clear context and clear directions. Teaching writing has been a challenge since the method of teaching cannot be as various as teaching other competence like speaking or listening. In order to make writing interesting, an English teacher should relate learners 2 ̆ 7 <b>writing</b> <b>production</b> to their experience. The exposure of experiential learning into some <b>writing</b> <b>production</b> like a weekly reflection or journal would encourage the learners to express more in the composition.

40|$|In recent years, {{a growing}} number of studies have been {{conducted}} to investigate the cognitive processes and mechanisms underlying language production. However, some fundamental issues still remain unsolved or even untouched, both in <b>written</b> and spoken <b>production.</b> <b>The</b> work reported in this thesis investigated a range of fundamental issues, in both the spoken and <b>the</b> <b>written</b> modalities, using both chronometric and electrophysiological techniques. To be specific, Chapter 1 provided relevant theory background. Chapter 2 focused on whether phonology constrains <b>written</b> word <b>production.</b> Results from a picture-word interference task showed that phonologically related distractor words (orthographically unrelated) facilitated <b>the</b> <b>written</b> naming of pictures. Results from a Stroop-like task showed that homophones of colour characters facilitated <b>the</b> <b>written</b> naming of colours. These findings constitute clear evidence that phonological codes constrain <b>written</b> word <b>production.</b> Chapter 3 compared the role of phonology in <b>the</b> <b>written</b> <b>production</b> of single and multiple words within a picture-word interference task. Results showed that the involvement of phonology was indeed more pronounced in <b>the</b> <b>written</b> <b>production</b> of multiple than of single words, as might be theoretically predicted due to greater demand on short-term memory for the production of multiple words. Chapter 4 investigated how activation flows between lexical selection and orthographic encoding in <b>written</b> word <b>production</b> using <b>the</b> <b>written</b> picture-colour priming task. Results showed that the task-irrelevant object name influenced written responses of colour naming, suggesting that orthographic encoding was not restricted to the selected target node but also extended to other co-activated nontarget nodes. This indicates that activation from lexical selection to orthographic encoding flows in a cascaded manner. Chapter 5 and Chapter 6 focused on the properties of orthographic representations underlying <b>written</b> <b>production.</b> Chapter 5 aimed to explore whether logo grapheme is a representational unit in <b>the</b> <b>written</b> <b>production</b> of Chinese. <b>The</b> results from the implicit priming paradigm showed that the logographeme-based preparation effect was not reliably replicated across a series of experiments. We propose that due to its specific characteristics, the [p paradigm might not be appropriate for exploring the psychological reality of logo graphemes. Chapter 6 investigated whether syllable is a representational unit in <b>the</b> <b>written</b> <b>production</b> of English. In constrast to previous findings in languages with clear syllable boundaries, results of the copying task showed that the temporal features of <b>the</b> <b>written</b> execution of English was not modulated by syllabic structure, suggesting that syllables may not {{play an important role in}} English writing, at least not as important as in languages with clear syllable boundaries. All studies above concerned <b>written</b> <b>production</b> while Chapter 7 and 8 focused on spoken production. Chapter 7 explored whether Mandarin Chinese speakers process phonemes when they produce words using ERPs. Whereas naming latencies were unaffected by phoneme overlap in the production of adjective-noun phrases, ERP responses were modulated from 200 ms after picture onset. The ERP findings therefore provided support for the claim that phonemic segments constitute processing units of phonological encoding even for speakers of languages that do not encode such units orthographically. Chapter 8 explored the universality of the principle of cascaded processing by testing Chinese spoken production. [n contrast to most previous findings in alphabetic languages, no picture-picture priming effect was observed for Chinese speakers, which raises a possibility that the principle of cascaded processing may be not applied to Chinese spoken production. Finally, Chapter 9 provides a general summary of this thesis and future directions. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
