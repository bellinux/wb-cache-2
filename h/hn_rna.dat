Npy hnRNA levels were also increased significantly in response to hypoglycemia in rats in which the hypothalamus was deafferentated, although the absolute levels were significantly lower than in sham-operated rats. Direct effects of lowering glucose levels on Npy gene expression were also confirmed in hypothalamic organotypic cultures. Thus, Npy gene transcription in the arcuate nucleus increases rapidly in response to hypoglycemia, and both direct and indirect inputs {{are involved in the}} rapid upregulation...|$|E
40|$|Chromosome {{specific}} c-DNA libraries greatly {{facilitate the}} isolation of disease associated genes which have been previously linked to particular chromosomes. Recently, several methods have been developed and employed for {{the isolation of}} transcribed sequences from specific human chromosomes and chromosome regions. Heteronuclear (<b>hn)</b> <b>RNA</b> from somatic human/rodent cell hybrids {{has been used as}} starting material to selectively prime the synthesis of human specific c-DNAs. A drawback of this method is the high number of rodent clones found in these chromosome specific c-DNA libraries. Here, we provide direct evidence that unspecific priming events account for the majority of these rodent clones. Using an Alu consensus primer hn-RNA human specific c-DNA libraries have been established and the specificity of Alu-priming has been evaluated. Using a variety of purification schemes for isolating hn-RNA we have significantly reduced the percentage of unspecific priming events. We also included a comparison of the hn-RNA yield from different somatic hybrids prior and after purification...|$|E
40|$|DsrA is an 87 -nt untranslated RNA {{that regulates}} both the global {{transcriptional}} silencer and nucleoid protein H-NS and the stationary phase and stress response sigma factor RpoS (σs). We demonstrate that DsrA acts via specific RNA:RNA base pairing interactions at the hns locus to antagonize H-NS translation. We also give evidence that supports {{a role for}} RNA:RNA interactions at the rpoS locus to enhance RpoS translation. Negative regulation of hns by DsrA is achieved by the RNA:RNA interaction blocking translation of <b>hns</b> <b>RNA.</b> In contrast, results suggest that positive regulation of rpoS by DsrA occurs by formation of an RNA structure that activates a cis-acting translational operator. Sequences within DsrA complementary to three additional genes, argR, ilvIH, and rbsD, suggest that DsrA is a riboregulator of gene expression that acts coordinately via RNA:RNA interactions at multiple loci...|$|R
40|$|The {{polypeptide}} coding assignments for {{the five}} messengers of the 18 S size class of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) RNA have been determined by cell-free translation of individual RNAs separated by gel electrophoresis. Listed in order of their decreasing electrophoretic mobilities in acid agarose-urea gels, the coding assignments of the RNAs were as follows: RNA 1, M protein; RNA 2, P protein; RNA 3, NP; RNA 4, F glycoprotein; and <b>RNA</b> 5, <b>HN</b> glycoprotein. <b>RNA</b> 2 also directed the synthesis of 33 - and 36 -kilodalton proteins, which were tentatively identified as being overlapping segments of the P protein. The 33 - and 36 -kilodalton polypeptides could be detected in infected cells, but not in purified virions of NDV.

We have now employed the PCR combined with reverse transcription to determine semiquantitatively ODC gene dosage and {{the amounts of}} heterogeneous nuclear (<b>hn)</b> <b>RNA</b> and of mature mRNA of the enzyme in parental and alpha-difluoromethylornithine-resistant human myeloma cells. Experiments with dilution series revealed that the ODC gene copy number {{and the amount of}} both hnRNA and mRNA were increased to the same extent (about 100 -fold) in the resistant cells. Similar dot-blot analyses of ODC-specific genomic DNA and total RNA indicated that the ODC gene copy number was increased by a factor of 380 and the amount of ODC mRNA by a factor of 700. Our results indicate that the PCR combined with reverse transcription is at least as useful as blot analyses to give semiquantitative assessment of the amounts of specific DNA or RNA sequences.

The {{inclusion in the}} gels of six common protein standards of carefully selected molecular weight and isoelectric point allowed us to clearly follow the distribution of specific proteins during nuclear extraction. In the nuclear washes and chromatin, we observed five classes of proteins: (a) Exclusively cytoplasmic proteins, present in the first saline-EDTA wash but rapidly disappearing from subsequent washes; (b) ubiquitous proteins of 75, 000, 68, 000, 57, 000, and 43, 000 mol wt, the latter being actin, found in the cytoplasm, all nuclear washes and the final chromatin pellet; (c) proteins of 94, 000, 25, 000, 22, 500, and 20, 500 mol wt specific to the nuclear washes; (d) proteins present in the nuclear washes and final chromatin, represented by species at 62, 000, 55, 000, 54, 000, and 48, 000 mol wt, primarily derived from the nuclear matrix; and (e) two proteins of 68, 000 mol wt present only in the final chromatin.

40|$|An arrayed {{library of}} human {{heterogeneous}} nuclear complementary (hnc) DNA was constructed from a somatic cell hybrid (M 28) containing an i(12 p) marker {{as the sole}} human chromosome. Heterogeneous nuclear (<b>hn)</b> <b>RNA</b> of M 28 was used to synthesize first-strand hncDNA with a primer (RT) containing a random hexanucleotide at its 3 ' end. Specific amplification of human sequences from this hncDNA was performed using Alu primers {{in combination with the}} RT primer. The products were directionally cloned and an arrayed library was constructed. Experiments indicated that all clones were derived from transcribed sequences. A number of randomly isolated clones were evaluated by Southern and Northern experiments, sequence analysis, and PCR. At least 80 % of these clones were of human 12 p origin. The number of independent clones in the library was estimated to be approximately 550. Using 60 hncDNA clones as probes, 6 showed positive signals on Northern blots. For 3 of these, the corresponding cDNAs were isolated: clone CD 60 A 1 codes for the cation-dependent mannose 6 -phosphate receptor, clone CC 6 is a human homologue of the bovine 39 -kDa nuclear-encoded NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit, and CD 18 belongs to the family of tumor necrosis factor receptor proteins. Southern experiments showed the 3 cDNAs to map to human chromosome 12 p as expected. Taken together these results show that the generation of a hncDNA library is a useful tool for the isolation of unknown genes located on a human chromosome (fragment) present in a somatic cell hybrid. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract To {{understand}} the hormonal coordination of the antagonism between molting and reproduction in crustaceans, the terminally anecdysial mature female Callinectes sapidus {{was used as}} a model. The regulatory roles of crustacean hyperglycemic hormone (CHH) and molt-inhibiting hormone (MIH) in vitellogenesis were examined. A competitive specific RIA was used to measure the levels of MIH and CHH in the hemolymphs of mature females at pre- and mid- vitellogenic stages, and their effects on vitellogenesis at early (early 2, E 2) and mid vitellogenesis (3) stages were determined in vitro. A hepatopancreas fragments incubation system was developed and the levels of vitellogenin (VtG), as well as VtG mRNA and heterogeneous nuclear (<b>hn)</b> VtG <b>RNA</b> were determined using RIA or QPCR, respectively. MIH titers were four times higher at mid-vitellogenesis than at pre-vitellogenesis, while CHH levels in the hemolymph were constant. In the in vitro incubation experiments, MIH increased both VtG mRNA levels and secretion at ovarian stage 3. At stage E 2, however, MIH resulted in a mixed response: downregulation of VtG mRNA and upregulation of hnVtG RNA. CHH had no effect on any of the parameters. Actinomycin D blocked the stimulatory effects of MIH in stage 3 animals on VtG mRNA and VtG, while cycloheximide attenuated only VtG levels, confirming the MIH stimulatory effect at this stage. MIH is a key endocrine regulator in the coordination of molting and reproduction in the mature female C. sapidus, which simultaneously inhibits molt and stimulates vitellogenesis. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{finding that}} molt-inhibiting hormone (MIH) regulates vitellogenesis in the {{hepatopancreas}} of mature Callinectes sapidus females, raised {{the need for}} the characterization of its mode of action. Using classical radioligand binding assays, we located specific, saturable, and non-cooperative binding sites for MIH in the Y-organs of juveniles (J-YO) and in the hepatopancreas of vitellogenic adult females. MIH binding to the hepatopancreas membranes had an affinity 77 times lower than that of juvenile YO membranes (K D values: 3. 22 × 10 - 8 and 4. 19 × 10 - 10 M/mg protein, respectively). The number of maximum binding sites (B MAX) was approximately two times higher in the hepatopancreas than in the YO (B MAX values: 9. 24 × 10 - 9 and 4. 8 × 10 - 9 M/mg protein, respectively). Furthermore, MIH binding site number in the hepatopancreas was dependent on ovarian stage and was twice as high at stage 3 than at stages 2 and 1. SDS-PAGE separation of [125 I] MIH or [125 I] crustacean hyperglycemic hormone (CHH) crosslinked to the specific binding sites in the membranes of the J-YO and hepatopancreas suggests a molecular weight of ~ 51 kDa for a MIH receptor in both tissues and a molecular weight of ~ 61 kDa for a CHH receptor in the hepatopancreas. The use of an in vitro incubation of hepatopancreas fragments suggests that MIH probably utilizes cAMP as a second messenger in this tissue, as cAMP levels increased in response to MIH. Additionally, 8 -Bromo-cAMP mimicked the effects of MIH on vitellogenin (VtG) mRNA and heterogeneous nuclear (<b>hn)</b> VtG <b>RNA</b> levels. The results imply that the functions of MIH in the regulation of molt and vitellogenesis are mediated through tissue specific receptors with different kinetics and signal transduction. MIH ability to regulate vitellogenesis is associated with the appearance of MIH specific membrane binding sites in the hepatopancreas upon pubertal/final molt. </p...|$|R

40|$|Vasopressin {{secreted}} by magnocellular neurones of the hypothalamic supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei {{is essential}} for water balance. In this study, we examined magnocellular neurone responses to osmotic stimulation in vehicle-injected controls or rats receiving an intraperitoneal (i. p.) injection of 250 microg/ 100 g of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), 3 h or 6 h earlier. LPS injection {{had no effect on}} plasma vasopressin concentrations in control rats but it caused marked and transient potentiation of the responses to a single i. p. injection of hypertonic saline (five- and two-fold, 3 and 6 h after LPS, respectively). The enhancement of plasma vasopressin responses was independent of plasma sodium concentrations or changes in blood pressure. Basal vasopressin mRNA expression in the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei decreased slightly 6 h after LPS injection, without changes in vasopressin transcription as indicated by vasopressin heteronuclear (<b>hn)</b> <b>RNA</b> levels. Parvocellular neurones showed expected increases in vasopressin hnRNA expression following LPS injection and a further increase after i. p. hypertonic saline injection (due to the painful component). In contrast to magnocellular vasopressin mRNA expression, the effects of LPS and hypertonic saline injections in parvocellular neurones were additive and not synergistic. Light microscopic immunohistochemical examination revealed an increase in size of vasopressin but not oxytocin axonal terminals in the neural lobe 3 h after LPS injection. Osmotic stimulation caused marked depletion of vasopressin immunoreactivity in axonal terminals of the neural lobe in both control and LPS-pretreated rats. The changes in vasopressin axon terminals were accompanied by induction of interleukin (IL) - 1 beta and IL- 6 in the posterior pituitary. The data show that endotoxemia causes morphological and functional alterations of the hypothalamic neurohypophyseal system, resulting in facilitation rather than inhibition of vasopressin synthesis, and secretion in response to osmotic stimulation...|$|E

In Chapter 2, we explore the feeding behavior, and levels of CRH hnRNA in the PVH and CRH mRNA in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CEA) in response to 6 hours of daytime restricted feeding. We show that feeding responses are different among feeding groups but there is no change in 24 -hour body weight. Also, the significant daily rhythm in Crh gene transcription is lost in animals fed only one meal during the daytime. Remarkably, there is a daily rhythm in CRH mRNA in the CEA of ad lib fed animals that is shifted 180 º when food accessibility is daytime restricted.; In Chapters 3 and 4, we determine how the time of day influences the magnitude of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and corticosterone responses to hypoglycemia. Little is known about the mechanisms that impart time-of-day differences on neuroendocrine CRH neurons in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVH). Rats received 0 - 3 U/kg of insulin (or 0. 9 % saline) to achieve a range of glucose nadir concentrations. Brains were processed to identify phosphorylated extracellular regulated 1 / 2 kinases (phospho-ERK 1 / 2) -immunoreactive cells in the PVH and hindbrain and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) heteronuclear (<b>hn)</b> <b>RNA</b> in the PVH. Hypoglycemia did not stimulate ACTH and corticosterone responses in animals unless a glucose concentration of approximately 3. 15 mM or below was reached. Critically, the glycemic thresholds required to stimulate ACTH and corticosterone release in the morning and night were indistinguishable. Yet, glucose concentrations below the estimated glycemic threshold correlated with a greater increase in corticosterone, ACTH, and phospho-ERK 1 / 2 -immunoreactive neurons in the PVH at night compared to morning. In these same animals, the number of phospho-ERK 1 / 2 -immunoreactive neurons in the medial part of the nucleus of the solitary tract was unchanged at both times of day. These data collectively support a model whereby changes in forebrain mechanisms alter the sensitivity of neuroendocrine CRH to the hypoglycemia-related information conveyed by ascending catecholaminergic afferents. Circadian clock driven processes in the forebrain would seem to be strong contenders for mediating these effects...|$|E
