50|$|Convulsions <b>are</b> often <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> {{some sort}} of {{electrical}} activity mishap in the brain. Oftentimes, the <b>cause</b> <b>is</b> not able to be pinpointed. Convulsions can <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> chemicals in the blood, as well as infections like meningitis or encephalitis. A very common <b>cause</b> of convulsions <b>is</b> fevers. Other possibilities include head trauma, stroke or lack of oxygen to the brain. Sometimes the convulsion can <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> genetic defects or brain tumors. Convulsions can also <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> any type-1 diabetic, whose blood sugar is too low. Hypoglycemia can cause very bad convulsions until the person's blood sugar is raised to normal level. Convulsions can also <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> deficiency of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine).|$|R

5|$|Hypothyroidism <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> {{inadequate}} {{function of}} the gland itself (primary hypothyroidism), inadequate stimulation by thyroid-stimulating hormone from the pituitary gland (secondary hypothyroidism), or inadequate release of thyrotropin-releasing hormone from the brain's hypothalamus (tertiary hypothyroidism). Primary hypothyroidism is about a thousandfold more common than central hypothyroidism.|$|E

5|$|In Newton's {{description}} of gravity, the gravitational force <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> matter. More precisely, it <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> a specific property of material objects: their mass. In Einstein's theory and related theories of gravitation, curvature at every point in spacetime is also caused by whatever matter is present. Here, too, mass {{is a key}} property in determining the gravitational influence of matter. But in a relativistic theory of gravity, mass cannot be {{the only source of}} gravity. Relativity links mass with energy, and energy with momentum.|$|E

40|$|Bomb blast cause injury {{on large}} groups of people by {{multiple}} mechanisms. Bomb blast injuries differ from the conventional description of trauma complexity. Primary injuries <b>are</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> blast wave and over pressure. Secondary injuries <b>are</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> flyin g debris and cause shrapnel wounds. Tertiary injuries <b>are</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> blast wind due to forceful impact and quaternary injuries <b>are</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> other vectors like heat, radiation etc. Combined injuries, especially blast and burn injury or blast and crush injur y, are common during an explosive event. Knowledge about nature of injuries is essential for medicolegal and postmortem reports...|$|R
50|$|Athlete's foot {{is a form}} of {{dermatophytosis}} (fungal {{infection of}} the skin), <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> dermatophytes, fungi (most of which are mold) which inhabit dead layers of skin and digests keratin. Dermatophytes are anthropophilic, meaning these parasitic fungi prefer human hosts. Athlete's foot <b>is</b> most commonly <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> the molds known as Trichophyton rubrum and T. mentagrophytes, but may also <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> Epidermophyton floccosum. Most cases of athlete's foot in the general population <b>are</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> T. rubrum; however, the majority of athlete's foot cases in athletes <b>are</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> T. mentagrophytes.|$|R
