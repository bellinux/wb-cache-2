5|$|In October 1932, Sargent {{suffered}} a near-fatal attack of tuberculosis. For {{almost two years}} {{he was unable to}} work, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>later</b> in the 1930s that he returned to the concert scene. In 1936, he conducted his first opera at Covent Garden, Gustave Charpentier's Louise. He did not conduct opera there again until 1954, with Walton's Troilus and Cressida, although he did conduct the incidental music for a dramatisation of The Pilgrim's Progress given at the Royal Opera House in 1948.|$|E
5|$|Nielsen {{maintained}} {{the reputation of}} an outsider during his lifetime, both {{in his own country}} and internationally. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>later</b> that his works firmly entered the international repertoire, accelerating in popularity from the 1960s through Leonard Bernstein and others. In Denmark, Nielsen's reputation was sealed in 2006 when three of his compositions were listed by the Ministry of Culture amongst the twelve greatest pieces of Danish music. For many years, he appeared on the Danish hundred-kroner banknote. The Carl Nielsen Museum in Odense documents his life and that of his wife. Between 1994 and 2009 the Royal Danish Library, sponsored by the Danish government, completed the Carl Nielsen Edition, freely available online, containing background information and sheet music for all Nielsen's works, many of which had not been previously published.|$|E
5|$|When {{the crisis}} abated, Arizona {{was ordered to}} Constantinople (now Istanbul) before she sailed for home on 15 June. She put into the New York Navy Yard on 30 June for an overhaul, where six 5-inch guns were removed and the fire control system was modernized. Work was {{completed}} in January 1920 and the battleship sailed south to Guantanamo Bay for crew training. During this time, Arizona was fitted with a flying-off platform {{similar to the one}} given to Texas in March 1919. In April, Arizona lost the Battenberg Cup to Nevada, and in June she was present for the Naval Academy's graduation ceremonies. In August she became the flagship of Battleship Division Seven, although <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>later</b> in 1920 that the battleship was refitted to be an admiral's flagship.|$|E

25|$|Originally it {{was thought}} that glycophorin C and D were the result of a gene {{duplication}} event but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>later</b> realised that they were encoded by the same gene. Glycophorin D (GPD) is generated from the glycophorin C messenger RNA by leaky translation at an in frame AUG at codon 30: glycophorin D = glycophorin C residues 30 to 128. This leaky translation appears to be a uniquely human trait.|$|E
25|$|From {{his studies}} into child development, Jean Piaget {{suggested}} that {{children were born}} with an innate animist worldview in which they anthropomorphized inanimate objects, and that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>later</b> that they grew out of this belief. Conversely, from her ethnographic research, Margaret Mead argued the opposite, believing that children were not born with an animist worldview but that they became acculturated to such beliefs as they were educated by their society.|$|E
25|$|The {{rebels were}} disorganized {{and without a}} common purpose. Some Han Chinese rebelled against the Qing state during the rebellion, and rebel bands fought each other.

25|$|Many Muslims {{were not}} {{satisfied}} with the terms of the treaty. However, the Qur'anic sura Al-Fath (The Victory) assured the Muslims that the expedition from which they were now returning must be considered a victorious one. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>later</b> that Muhammad's followers would realise the benefit behind this treaty. These benefits, according to Welch, included the inducing of the Meccans to recognise Muhammad as an equal; a cessation of military activity posing well for the future; and gaining the admiration of Meccans who were impressed by the incorporation of the pilgrimage rituals.|$|E
25|$|By 1991-92, {{preliminary}} tank units (apparently {{from the}} abandoned Jastrebarsko garrison in Croatia) were stationed near Zvornik. By February or March 1992 (at {{the time of}} the referendum on independence), additional units of the former JNA-tank units and artillery and anti-aircraft positions were stationed in the Zvornik region. Initially, the tanks still carried the JNA emblems. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>later</b> that they were replaced by the Serbian flag and the coat-of-arms emblem. On the Serb side of the Drina river bank, various tank positions could be identified as well. Additional forces, including artillery, anti-aircraft weaponry, and tanks were being positioned there.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of October 27, a U-2F (the third CIA U-2A, {{modified}} for air-to-air refueling) piloted by USAF Major Rudolf Anderson, departed its forward operating location at McCoy AFB, Florida. At approximately 12:00pm EDT, the aircraft {{was struck by a}} S-75 Dvina (NATO designation SA-2 Guideline) surface-to-air missile launched from Cuba. The aircraft was shot down, and Anderson was killed. The stress in negotiations between the Soviets and the US intensified; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>later</b> believed that the decision to fire the missile was made locally by an undetermined Soviet commander, acting on his own authority. Later that day, at about 3:41pm EDT, several US Navy RF-8A Crusader aircraft, on low-level photoreconnaissance missions, were fired upon.|$|E
50|$|In the ravian exodus which {{followed}} the great war, Kirin {{was turned into}} stone and left behind as he could not pass through the ravian portal due to his mixed half-rakshas nature. When Kirin is discovered and woken up by Spikes, he considers himself human and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>later</b> that he starts suspecting his ravian origins. Later on, when Dahn Gem tells him of his true nature as half-rakshas and half-ravian, he realises {{that he has to}} come to terms with himself and his responsibilities.

25|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>later</b> that Phan {{realized}} that obtaining independence for Vietnam {{would be much}} more difficult than expected. He became familiar with the works of famed European thinkers, such as Voltaire, Rousseau and Darwin. Phan was also influenced by the writings of such Chinese Confucianists as Liang Qichao and Kang Youwei. The European and Chinese works, which had only entered Vietnamese circles a few years later, opened Phan's mind to more expansive thought regarding the struggle for freedom of his people. Liang's Hsin-min ts'ung-pao ("The Renovation of the People") influenced Phan's revolutionary ideas and beliefs, as it criticized the Chinese government and proclaimed that the Chinese people's consciousness needed to be awakened to further the country into the modern era.|$|E
25|$|Many of the viewers, already deeply {{upset at}} the murder of such a brave, honest, courageous, and well-loved man {{apparently}} killed in defence of his family, were further affected by the mournful manner in which Dyer, who deeply respected and admired Swift, spoke. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>later</b> revealed {{that the reason for}} Dyer's initial refusal to speak on air, and his actual refusal to look into the camera whilst speaking – having been forced against his will, by Casey, to deliver the eulogy – was solely due to his having left his false teeth at home (a fact that he refused to reveal to Casey or anyone else at the time), and {{had nothing to do with}} any reluctance to acknowledge his own personal sense of great loss at Swift's murder.|$|E
25|$|Mitchell {{made his}} {{first-class}} debut for Transvaal, against Border, {{at the age}} of 17. He took 11 wickets with his legbreaks and googlies. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>later</b> in the following season that he started to develop his batting. In 1927–28 the MCC toured South Africa and Mitchell, batting at 3, struck 40 runs. He showcased his all-round abilities against Natal in the 1928–29 trial matches and later in a game against Griqualand West he showed his fighting spirit by rescuing his side after the top six batsmen scored no more than 11 runs between them. His maiden first-class century came in England, against the successful Yorkshire side at Sheffield. For most of the games {{in the rest of the}} tour he opened the batting and it would be a position that he would stay in for most of his career.|$|E

Lennox later spots him hitting a girl outside of a ballroom and saves her by grabbing hold of Pete, and after a brief argument, beating him out of self-defence. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>later</b> in the novel that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> revealed {{that he was a}} long-wanted serial rapist and murderer named Peter Manuel, whose crimes lead him to be hanged in 1958.|$|R
25|$|Since 1632, France had {{regularly}} occupied Lorraine in {{periods of}} war, without annexing it. The duke, Charles IV, who was {{allied with the}} houses of Austria and Bavaria, adopted a policy hostile towards France. He and afterwards, his nephew, Charles V of Lorraine had been officers in the Imperial Austrian Army. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>later</b> that France was presented with both motive and a favourable occasion to annex the duchy. This was the marriage, in 1736, of Francis de Lorraine to the heiress of the Austrian imperial house, Archduchess Maria Theresa, {{at a moment when}} Austria was weakened. The Treaty of Vienna (1738) awarded Lorraine to Louis XV of France, who gave it for life, to his father-in-law, Stanisław Leszczyński. The duchy of Lorraine would be formally annexed to France in 1766, when Stanisław died. In recompense, Duke Francis III was given the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, which was vacant.|$|E
25|$|California (along with Oregon and Kansas) was not {{included}} in the initial callup of 75,000 militia due to its vast distance from the rest of the country. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>later,</b> as he was recalling Federal troops to the east, on July 24, 1861, the Secretary of War called on Governor John G. Downey to furnish one regiment of infantry and five companies of cavalry to guard the overland mail route from Carson City to Salt Lake City. Three weeks later four more regiments of infantry and a regiment of cavalry were requested. All of these were volunteer units recruited and organized in the counties of the northern part of the state, especially around San Francisco Bay region and the mining camps in counties in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada Mountains; few recruits came from the counties of Southern California. These volunteers replaced the regular troops transferred to the east before the end of 1861.|$|E
25|$|Their 1951 {{victory was}} {{followed}} by lacklustre performances in the following seasons. The team {{finished third in the}} 1951–52 season, and were eventually swept by the Red Wings in the semi-finals. With the conclusion of the 1952–53 regular season, the Leafs failed {{to make it to the}} post-season for the first time since the 1945–46 playoffs. The Leafs' poor performance may be attributed partly to a decline in their sponsored junior system (including the Toronto St. Michael's Majors and the Toronto Marlboros). The junior system was managed by Frank J. Selke until his departure to the Canadiens in 1946. In his absence, the quality of players it produced declined. Many who were called up to the Leafs in the early 1950s were found to be seriously lacking in ability. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>later</b> in the decade that the Leafs' feeder clubs turned out enough impressive prospects to enable the team to be competitive again.|$|E
