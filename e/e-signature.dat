40|$|<b>E-signatures</b> {{are one of}} {{the fastest}} growing global {{practices}} because of their convenience. Much less is known, however, about whether people perceive <b>e-signatures</b> to be symbolically equivalent to traditional hand signatures. Results of four studies demonstrate that although functionally the same, <b>e-signatures</b> evoked markedly different psychological reactions than hand signatures. Namely, <b>e-signatures</b> evoked a weaker sense of the signer’s presence and involvement. This weaker sense of social presence, in turn, induced negativity: People were more likely to discount the validity of an e-signed application than that of an identical application signed by hand. They also anticipated that e-signed contracts would lead to greater likelihood of contract breaches. This negativity toward <b>e-signatures</b> persisted across five different types of <b>e-signatures,</b> regardless of an individual’s level of comfort with technology. Taken together, the studies reveal deeply rooted psychological reactions to a practice that is now prevalent worldwide...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. European, {{international}} and Internet standards {{are available to}} support electronic signatures. The most common signature formats are defined via the ASN. 1 syntax with DER encoding, or the XML language. Furthermore PDF is a widespread document format with support for <b>e-signatures.</b> Application of signatures to e-documents must consider several aspects: long term signature validity, non-repudiation, qualified certificates, and many others. This paper focuses on the relationships among multiple documents and multiple signatures and analyses the support provided by current formats to this problem. Where lack of standardization or standard profiling is found, a proposal is made towards better application of <b>e-signatures.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|This paper explores {{avenues for}} the {{creation}} of a legal framework for electronic identification, specifically by tying this into the future development of the European eSignatures Directive. It builds on the observation that the eSignature Directive has largely been unable to support an internal market for certification service providers, partially because it insufficiently considers the essential link between <b>e-signatures</b> and ancillary services. Electronic identification is one of these ancillary services. The current review of the Directive is an opportunity to remedy this issue. Â Based on this idea, this paper examines the possibility of creating a comprehensive framework for trust services, that would also include electronic identification services. Â...|$|R

40|$|In 2002, Belgium {{has adopted}} an {{electronic}} identity card {{as one of the}} first countries in Europe. By the end of 2009, the roll-out of the eID card will be completed. This means that each Belgian citizen will possess an eID card. The card enables her to digitally prove her identity and to legally sign electronic documents. The Belgian eID card opens up new opportunities for the government, its citizens, service providers and application developers. The Belgian eID technology originally aimed at facilitating transactions between Belgian citizens and the government. Although many eID applications have been developed, the success of the Belgian eID technology has not been what was expected. Therefore, the Belgian government encourages developers to build commercial applications that use the eID card (for authentication or <b>e-signatures).</b> However, extending the scope of the Belgian eID technology from e-government to the commercial sector is no sinecure and not without risks. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The {{healthcare}} {{industry is}} moving from paper-based documentation into the digital era. Electronic health records (EHR) {{are playing a}} major role in this development. Electronic health records will not only to be shared among a growing number of healthcare providers but they have also to be archived over long periods of time. The required life cycle depends of national regulations, but typically the preservation time of patient data varies between 20 and 100 years. Availability, integrity, confidentiality and non-repudiation of stored data over these lengthy preservation periods needs to be fully proven, both to preclude loss and also ensure the ability to read and understand content is maintained. This document describes a co-operative trusted notary archive (TNA) which receives granular health data from different EHR-systems, stores data together with associated meta-information for long periods and distributes granular EHR-data objects. TNA communicates with EHR-systems and external users via archive request and distribution messages.

40|$|International and {{regional}} organizations and governments are increasingly interested in regulation of information technology. Laws {{are needed for}} e-transactions to combat electronic crimes and address issues related to cyberspace and Internet users. There has been an acceleration in the issuance of legislation governing this area. The laws are aimed at dealing with legal issues, removal of barriers, and increasing consumer confidence in such technology. This research is primarily designed to evaluate Law No. 20 of 2014 Concerning E-transactions in Kuwait. The aim is to study how effective the law has been in achieving its objectives. The analysis is conducted through an exploration of e-commerce and transactions as addressed in Kuwaiti law. This law and its executive by-law were the first laws regulating e-transactions which emerged after an absence of any special laws regulating such matters. The main objective of this research defines the concept of e-commerce, its importance, {{its relationship to the}} law and the obstacles it confronts. The analysis also covers several legal issues arising from the emergence of e-commerce. There are legal issues for e-transactions listed in Law No. 20 of 2014, which includes e-contracts, <b>e-signatures,</b> privacy and data protection. Thus, it is important to identify shortcomings in the law affecting its required role. Finally, recommendations are put forward {{for the development of a}} legal framework. This research utilizes a comparative study approach to evaluate Law No. 20 of 2014. A comparison is done with relevant laws in the United Kingdom, which is more established in this area. Other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) laws are also considered whenever necessary. There are several laws in the UK that cover similar relevant issues to those addressed by Law No. 20 of 2014. Given the novelty of the law, judicial consideration cannot be assessed until a reasonable period has passed after application of its articles. The recent issue of laws related to e-transactions, including related technical terms, need be given attention at all levels of the judiciary. This must be done to ensure proper application of the law, public awareness, and knowledge in academic and educational circles. ...|$|R
