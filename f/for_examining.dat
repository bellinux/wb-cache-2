5|$|By the 11th century, the I Ching {{was being}} {{read as a}} work of {{intricate}} philosophy, as a jumping-off point <b>for</b> <b>examining</b> great metaphysical questions and ethical issues. Cheng Yi, patriarch of the Neo-Confucian Cheng–Zhu school, read the I Ching as a guide to moral perfection. He described the text as a way to for ministers to form honest political factions, root out corruption, and solve problems in government.|$|E

5|$|Local {{churches were}} further {{organized}} into geographically defined presbyteries. A presbytery was {{a convention of}} all ministers within its jurisdiction and one ruling elder chosen by each session. Collegiate churches were entitled to be represented by two or more ruling elders {{in proportion to the}} number of its pastors. Presbyteries were responsible <b>for</b> <b>examining,</b> licensing and ordaining candidates to the ministry, as well as judging and removing ministers. They were also responsible for resolving doctrinal or disciplinary questions and also functioned as courts of appeal from sessions. An executive commission was appointed to more efficiently manage the presbytery's work, and judicial cases were referred to a judicial commission.|$|E
5|$|The Antarctic scallop {{was first}} {{described}} by the British zoologist Edgar Albert Smith in 1902 as Pecten colbecki. He worked at the British Museum and was responsible <b>for</b> <b>examining</b> and describing shells from collections made {{over the years that}} had been deposited there. The German malacologist Johannes Thiele determined in 1934 that the characteristics of the Antarctic scallop were sufficiently different from those of other members of the genus Pecten to warrant its inclusion in a separate genus, Adamussium. More recently, examinations of the chromosome structure and of the mitochondrial DNA of A. colbecki have been undertaken, but the exact phylogenetic relationship it has with other pectinids is still unclear.|$|E

5|$|As {{investigation}} and planning work continued, the Corps of Engineers {{reached an agreement}} with the Department of the Interior, the parent agency of the Bureau of Reclamation, in March 1962. The agreement stated the Corps would have responsibility for design and construction of the project, while the Interior Department would be responsible for running and maintaining the dam after completion. In the planning stages, the Interior Department also would be responsible <b>for</b> <b>examining</b> the economic feasibility of the project and its effect upon natural resources. This agreement negated much of the work of the REAB to that point, as the Interior Department promptly began its own three-year study of the dam's economic feasibility and environmental impact. The DRC report, though trumped by the Interior Department's new precedence in such matters, nevertheless released a report in April 1962, stating that the project was economically feasible and would attract new industries to Alaska. Meanwhile, the Corps of Engineers continued engineering studies.|$|E
5|$|Despite these {{biological}} possibilities, {{there are}} formidable obstacles {{to life on}} Titan, and any analogy to Earth is inexact. At a vast distance from the Sun, Titan is frigid, and its atmosphere lacks CO2. At Titan's surface, water exists only in solid form. Because of these difficulties, scientists such as Jonathan Lunine have viewed Titan less as a likely habitat for life, than as an experiment <b>for</b> <b>examining</b> theories on the conditions that prevailed prior to the appearance of life on Earth. Although life itself may not exist, the prebiotic conditions on Titan and the associated organic chemistry remain of great interest in understanding {{the early history of}} the terrestrial biosphere. Using Titan as a prebiotic experiment involves not only observation through spacecraft, but laboratory experiments, and chemical and photochemical modeling on Earth.|$|E
5|$|Phenomenology is {{a method}} of inquiry that {{attempts}} to examine the structure of consciousness in its own right, putting aside problems regarding the relationship of consciousness to the physical world. This approach was first proposed by the philosopher Edmund Husserl, and later elaborated by other philosophers and scientists. Husserl's original concept gave rise to two distinct lines of inquiry, in philosophy and psychology. In philosophy, phenomenology has largely been devoted to fundamental metaphysical questions, such as the nature of intentionality ("aboutness"). In psychology, phenomenology largely has meant attempting to investigate consciousness using the method of introspection, which means looking into one's own mind and reporting what one observes. This method fell into disrepute {{in the early twentieth}} century because of grave doubts about its reliability, but has been rehabilitated to some degree, especially when used in combination with techniques <b>for</b> <b>examining</b> brain activity.|$|E

Cows included in the study were from five large dairies in California, were presented for pregnancy examination from December of 1982 to April of 1983, and had a calving interval of from 290 to 530 days. All palpations were done by one of two experienced veterinarians. Calving intervals were significantly lower <b>for</b> cows pregnancy <b>examined</b> from 51 - 56 days postbreeding than <b>for</b> cows <b>examined</b> earlier or later...|$|R

5|$|The book {{discusses}} related legal {{practices of}} countries including the United States, the United Kingdom, Israel, Switzerland and Germany. Israel {{was the first}} country to publicly acknowledge the practice—in November 2000. The author connects this policy initiative with Israel's ongoing conflict with Palestinian militants. Melzer argues that this policy was controversial—the issue came before the Israeli Supreme Court, where the matter was not decided for almost five years. The court's judgment was issued on 14 December 2006, but neither forbade nor endorsed the practice. Melzer asserts that it left multiple important legal conundra unresolved. Its significance was that it dealt not with a single incident, but rather {{with the nature of}} the policy itself and set forth conditions <b>for</b> <b>examining</b> the legality of future episodes.|$|E
5|$|Transvaginal {{ultrasound}} {{to examine}} the endometrial thickness in women with postmenopausal bleeding is increasingly being used {{to aid in the}} diagnosis of endometrial cancer in the United States. In the United Kingdom, both an endometrial biopsy and a transvaginal ultrasound used in conjunction are the standard of care for diagnosing endometrial cancer. The homogeneity of the tissue visible on transvaginal ultrasound can help to indicate whether the thickness is cancerous. Ultrasound findings alone are not conclusive in cases of endometrial cancer, so another screening method (for example endometrial biopsy) must be used in conjunction. Other imaging studies are of limited use. CT scans are used for preoperative imaging of tumors that appear advanced on physical exam or have a high-risk subtype (at high risk of metastasis). They {{can also be used to}} investigate extrapelvic disease. An MRI can be of some use in determining if the cancer has spread to the cervix or if it is an endocervical adenocarcinoma. MRI is also useful <b>for</b> <b>examining</b> the nearby lymph nodes.|$|E
