The phase differences {{of the electromagnetic}} wave signals received by two receiver coils increased when the R 1 –R 2 spacing of the antenna system increased. When the R 1 –R 2 spacing increased between 0.2 and 1.2  m, the polarization angles which emerged in the formation interface of the amplitude ratios and phase difference curves were not clear enough. That is to say, by using amplitude ratios and phase differences curve, we cannot indicate the formation interface accurately and timely.

The analysis of borehole eccentricity effects on LWD sensor response in full 3 × 3 anisotropic Earth formations is important for correct data interpretation in deviated or horizontal wells. In this paper, we present a cylindrical-grid finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) model to tackle this problem. The grid is aligned to the sensor axis to avoid staircasing error in the sensor geometry, but in general misaligned to the (eccentered) borehole/formation interface. A locally-conformal discretization is used to compute effective conductivity tensors of partially-filled grid cells at those interfaces, involving an isotropic medium (borehole) and a full 3 × 3 anisotropic medium in general (dipped Earth formation).

Numerical simulation results show that the change of T–R 1 spacing has obvious influence on the investigation depth and detecting precision of the resistivity LWD tool, and the change of R 1 –R 2 spacing may affect the resolution of the thin-layer distinguish. The change of signal source transmitting frequency can influence the judgment of the formation interface, and high transmitting frequency can improve the instrument resolution of high-resistivity thin layer.

40|$|In {{drilling}} for oil, we occasionally encounter overpressured shale zones {{which can be}} disastrous to drilling. The overpressured zones usually exhibit lower electrical resistivity. Electromagnetic methods are therefore proposed to predict the location and intensity of the overpressured zones at tens of meters ahead of a drill-bit. The existing methods in petroleum well logging {{are sensitive to the}} formation volume up to 3 meters lateral to the borehole. To predict the formation ahead of drill-bit, it is essential to use a time-domain or a wide-band frequency domain approach. In a conductive medium, the high frequency fields are more confined to the volume around the source while the low frequency components reach larger volume of formation. In the time-domain situation, early time response is closely related to the formation property near the sensor while later time measurement is more sensitive to the property of the far away formation. It is found that the presence of an overpressured zone at 10 's of meters ahead of a drill-bit can be detected. Besides the prediction of overpressured zone, the method can also provide better <b>geosteering</b> to guide the drilling trajectory and to improve formation evaluation. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
30|$|It {{is shown}} in Fig.  9 that tilts of the two {{receiver}} coils can affect the judgment of low-resistivity formation and high-resistivity formation. In the condition of tilted receiver coils, when the dip angle of the formation increases, the resolution of instrument measurement results in the low-resistivity formation and high-resistivity formation gradually increasing. According to the polarization angles in amplitude ratios and phase difference curves, we can indicate the interface between the two formations clearly. However, as shown in Fig.  9, {{with the increase of}} dip angle of the formation, the variations of amplitude ratios and phase differences received by two receiver coils all present an upward trend. But in amplitude ratios and phase difference curves, we can find that with the increase of dip angle of the formation, the polarization angles corresponding to the interface from low-resistivity formation to high-resistivity formation gradually disappear. Conversely, the polarization angles corresponding to the interface from high-resistivity formation to low-resistivity formation become more and more obvious. Based on that, the drilling direction can be determined in time according to the polarization angles whether appear on the amplitude ratios and the phase difference curves corresponding to the interface between two formations, then the <b>geosteering</b> drilling information can be accurately provided by resistivity LWD tool.|$|E

40|$|Horizontal {{drilling}} is {{an important}} development in the petroleum industry and it relies heavily on guiding the drill bit {{with the aid of}} sonic logging, i. e. <b>geosteering.</b> The quality of sonic imaging depends heavily on the effective suppression of borehole waves and enhancement of weak reflection signal. To this end, we propose an approach to image the near-borehole structure using acoustic logging data. We model the borehole wave propagation using log-derived velocities. The modeled borehole waves are removed from the raw data, leaving reflected signals for imaging interfaces. We tested this method with three sets of data. First we calculated synthetic waveforms for a horizontal well with an interface parallel to the borehole using the 3 D finite difference method. The processing result with our method clearly shows the parallel reflecting interface. Next, we conducted an ultrasonic laboratory measurement in a borehole with a parallel Lucite-water boundary. In this case, the interface was also visible in the final image. Finally, we applied this method to a field dataset. In the field dataset, the acoustic logging data were continuously recorded along the well, which enabled us to reject the borehole modes in both common shot gather and common offset gather. The large amount of common offset gather data also allowed us to apply migration to the data.

This work involved the development of radar navigation and radio data transmission systems for integration with microhole coiled tubing bottom hole assemblies. Under this contract, Stolar designed, fabricated, and laboratory and field tested two advanced technologies of importance to the future growth of the U.

The operating specifications for these technologies are compatible with 3. 5 -inch boreholes drilled to a true vertical depth (TVD) of 5, 000 feet, which is typical of coiled tubing drilling applications. These two technologies (i. e., the Stolar Data Transmission System and Drill String Radar) were developed into pre-commercial prototypes and tested successfully in simulated coiled tubing drilling conditions. Integration of these two technologies provides a real-time <b>geosteering</b> capability with extremely quick response times.

Results show that the Klein Aub Formation is dominated by magnetite, mica, quartz, and titanites. The Aubures Formation is dominated by magnetite, ulvospinel, and quartz. The Blaubeker Formation is dominated by quartz, magnetite, carbonates and chamosite. Quartz, mica, rutile, and magnetite dominate the Numees Formation. Quartz, carbonates, and rutile dominate the Holgat Formation. The Kuibis Formation is dominated by quartz, rutile, and apatite. The EMPA results for tourmalines and garnets were plotted in ternary diagrams to evaluate potential source areas, in combination with XRD results that showed evidence of minerals associated with the Pilanesberg Complex in NW South Africa, Northern Kalahari Manganese Field, Irumide belt in Zambia, and Limpopo belt.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The Heather {{oil field}} {{is located in}} the Northern North Sea and is {{operated}} by DNO Heather Limited. Oil is produced from sandstones of the Middle Jurassic Brent Group. Although approaching non-commercial flow rates, infill projects are under way which target unswept oil. At this late stage in field life, projects are typified by extracting as much new oil from the field as possible with minimal expenditure. These result in incomplete or degraded log data. This paper describes how the application of innovative techniques can replace data shortfalls, providing quality data without compromising budgetary constraints. Four infill wells were drilled during 2000 and 2001. Innovative petrophysical techniques have been used to enhance the electric log data gathered. Fuzzy logic techniques have been applied to predict reservoir permeability and choose perforat-ing intervals. Some sections of the highly deviated wells were necessarily logged in sliding mode and fuzzy logic was also used to repair the resulting degraded log curve data. Following the infill well programme, field production has increased from 5000 BBL oil per day (BOPD) to 7000 BOPD. This success was partly due to the better location of wells, particularly 2 / 5 -H 62 Y, because of the improved reservoir model resulting from these petrophysical techniques. The height above free-water level (HAFWL) was estimated across the Heather Field using the so-called FOIL function (bulk volume of water plotted as a function of HAFWL) (Cuddy 1993). The FOIL function has given valuable insights into free-water level variation across the Heather Field and has improved water saturation modelling.

40|$|The Valhall field started {{production}} in 1982 {{and has been}} producing since. A vast amount of data has been gathered and interpreted since then. Because of its complexity, {{there are still many}} questions left unanswered. Some are questions related to the water flooding system; in-fill wells are drilled, and logging data detects unexpected water. Where does the water come from and why? Others are related to the confidence in estimated target parameters such as water saturation, porosity and permeability. Can this data contribute to increase the confidence in them? Valhall is a brown chalk field. It is a complex, mature field and consists of tight, fractured chalk. Successful reservoir management requires good understanding of the reservoir and the data. The Nuclear Magnetic Resonance is a fairly old technology and is well understood. It has a great potential of providing useful information along the wellbore. Data have been acquired from the reservoir but the applications in the Valhall reservoir management has not been exploited to its full potential. It {{has been used as a}} secondary source of porosity and saturation and used if no other source of such information has been available. The objective of the present study is to optimize the utilization of NMR data on Valhall through investigation of the current applications and possible additional applications. Investigations are done on the data quality, porosity, fluid saturations, permeability and the possibility of improving the understanding of water flooding. Moreover parameters are optimized to better fit conventional logs. Its applicability for well placement and <b>Geosteering</b> are discussed.

40|$|The {{oil and gas}} {{industry}} routinely uses borehole tools for measuring or logging rock and fluid properties of geologic formations to locate hydrocarbons and maximize their production. Pore fluids in formations of interest are usually hydrocarbons or water. Resistivity logging is {{based on the fact that}} oil and gas have a substantially higher resistivity than water. The first resistivity log was acquired in 1927, and resistivity logging is still the foremost measurement used for drilling and evaluation. However, the acquisition and interpretation of resistivity logging data has grown in complexity over the years. Resistivity logging tools operate in a wide range of frequencies (from DC to GHz) and encounter extremely high (several orders of magnitude) conductivity contrast between the metal mandrel of the tool and the geologic formation. Typical challenges include arbitrary angles of tool inclination, full tensor electric and magnetic field measurements, and interpretation of complicated anisotropic formation properties. These challenges combine to form some of the most intractable computational electromagnetic problems in the world. Reliable, fast, and convenient numerical modeling of logging tool responses is critical for tool design, sensor optimization, virtual prototyping, and log data inversion. This spectrum of applications necessitates both depth and breadth of modeling software—from blazing fast one-dimensional (1 -D) modeling codes to advanced threedimensional (3 -D) modeling software, and from in-house developed codes to commercial modeling packages. In this paper, with the help of several examples, we demonstrate our approach for using different modeling software to address different drilling and evaluation applications. In one example, fast 1 -D modeling provides proactive <b>geosteering</b> information from a deep-reading azimuthal propagation resistivity measurement. In the second example, a 3 -D model with multiple vertical resistive fractures successfully explains the unusual curve separations of an array laterolog tool in a shale-gas formation.

40|$|After nearly 60 {{years of}} {{development}}, many old gas {{fields in the}} Sichuan Basin have come to middle–late development stages with low pressure and low yield, and some are even {{on the verge of}} abandonment, but there are plenty remaining gas resources still undeveloped. Analysis shows that gas fields which have the conditions for the secondary development are faced with many difficulties. For example, it is difficult to produce low permeable reserves and to unset the hydraulic seal which is formed by active formation water. In this paper, therefore, the technical route and selection conditions of old gas fields for the secondary development were comprehensively elaborated with its definition as the beginning. Firstly, geological model forward modeling and production performance inversion characteristic curve diagnosis are performed by using the pressure normalization curve and the identification and quantitative description method for multiple sets of storage–seepage body of complex karst fracture–cavity systems is put forward, after the multiple storage–seepage body mode of fracture–cavity systems is established. Combined with the new occurrence mode of gas and water in U-shape pipes, a new calculation technology for natural gas reserves of multiple fracture–cavity systems with strong water invasion is developed. Secondly, a numerical model of pore–cavity–fracture triple media is built, and simulation and result evaluation technology for the production pattern of “drainage by horizontal wells + gas production by vertical wells” in bottom-water fracture and cavity gas reservoirs with strong water invasion is developed. Thirdly, the geological model of gas reservoirs is reconstructed {{with the support of the}} integration technologies which are formed based on fine gas reservoir description. Low permeable reserves of gas reservoirs are evaluated based on each classification.

40|$|This {{project was}} {{undertaken}} {{to demonstrate that}} oil and gas can be drilled and produced safely and economically from a fractured Monterey reservoir in the Santa Maria Basin of California by employing horizontal wellbores and underbalanced drilling technologies. Two vertical wells were previously drilled in this area by Temblor Petroleum with heavy mud and conventional completions; neither was commercially productive. A new well was drilled by the project team in 2004 {{with the objective of}} accessing an extended length of oil-bearing, high-resistivity Monterey shale via a horizontal wellbore, while implementing managed-pressure drilling (MPD) techniques to avoid formation damage. Initial project meetings were conducted in October 2003. The team confirmed that the demonstration well would be completed open-hole to minimize productivity impairment. Following an overview of the geologic setting and local field experience, critical aspects of the application were identified. At the pre-spud meeting in January 2004, the final well design was confirmed and the well programming/service company requirements assigned. Various design elements were reduced in scope due to significant budgetary constraints. Major alterations to the original plan included: (1) a VSP seismic survey was delayed to a later phase; (2) a new (larger) surface hole would be drilled rather than re-enter an existing well; (3) a 7 -in. liner would be placed into the top of the Monterey target as quickly as possible to avoid problems with hole stability; (4) evaluation activities were reduced in scope; (5) <b>geosteering</b> observations for fracture access would be deduced from penetration rate, cuttings description and hydrocarbon in-flow; and (6) rather than use nitrogen, a novel air-injection MPD system was to be implemented. Drilling operations, delayed from the original schedule by capital constraints and lack of rig availability, were conducted from September 12 to November 11, 2004. The vertical and upper curved sections were drilled and lined through the problematic shale member without major stability problems. The top of the targeted Monterey was thought to be seen at the expected TVD of 10, 000 ft where the 7 -in. liner was set at a 60 {sup o} hole angle. Significant oil and gas shows suggested the fractured interval anticipated at the heel location had been penetrated. A total of 2572 ft of 6. -in. near-horizontal interval was placed in the shale section, extending planned well length by approximately 470 ft. Very little hydrocarbon in-flow was observed from fractures along the productive interval. This may be a result of the well trajectory falling underneath the Monterey fractured zone. Hydrocarbon observations, cuttings analysis and gamma-ray response indicated additional fractured intervals were accessed along the last {+-} 900 ft of well length. The well was completed with a 2 7 / 8 -in. tubing string set in a production packer in preparation for flow and swab tests to be conducted later by a service rig. The planned well time was estimated as 39 days and overall cost as $ 2. 4 million. The actual results are 66 days at a total cost of $ 3. 4 million. Well productivity responses during subsequent flow and swabbing tests were negative. The well failed to inflow and only minor amounts (a few barrels) of light oil were recovered. The lack of production may suggest that actual sustainable reservoir pressure is far less than anticipated. Temblor is currently investigating the costs and operational viability of re-entering the well and conducting an FMI (fracture detection) log and/or an acid stimulation.

40|$|A {{breakthrough}} {{has been}} discovered for controlling seismic sources to generate selectable low frequencies. Conventional seismic sources, including sparkers, rotary mechanical, hydraulic, air guns, and explosives, {{by their very nature}} produce high-frequencies. This is counter to the need for long signal transmission through rock. The patent pending SeismicPULSER{trademark} methodology has been developed for controlling otherwise high-frequency seismic sources to generate selectable low-frequency peak spectra applicable to many seismic applications. Specifically, we have demonstrated the application of a low-frequency sparker source which can be incorporated into a drill bit for Drill Bit Seismic While Drilling (SWD). To create the methodology of a controllable low-frequency sparker seismic source, it was necessary to learn how to maximize sparker efficiencies to couple to, and transmit through, rock with the study of sparker designs and mechanisms for (a) coupling the sparker-generated gas bubble expansion and contraction to the rock, (b) the effects of fluid properties and dynamics, (c) linear and non-linear acoustics, and (d) imparted force directionality. After extensive seismic modeling, the design of high-efficiency sparkers, laboratory high frequency sparker testing, and field tests were performed at the University of Texas Devine seismic test site. The conclusion of the field test was that extremely high power levels would be required to have the range required for deep, 15, 000 + ft, high-temperature, high-pressure (HTHP) wells. Thereafter, more modeling and laboratory testing led to the discovery of a method to control a sparker that could generate low frequencies required for deep wells. The low frequency sparker was successfully tested at the Department of Energy Rocky Mountain Oilfield Test Center (DOE RMOTC) field test site in Casper, Wyoming. An 8 -in diameter by 26 -ft long SeismicPULSER{trademark} drill string tool was designed and manufactured by TII. An APS Turbine Alternator powered the SeismicPULSER{trademark} to produce two Hz frequency peak signals repeated every 20 seconds. Since the ION Geophysical, Inc. (ION) seismic survey surface recording system was designed to detect a minimum downhole signal of three Hz, successful performance was confirmed with a 5. 3 Hz recording with the pumps running. The two Hz signal generated by the sparker was modulated with the 3. 3 Hz signal produced by the mud pumps to create an intense 5. 3 Hz peak frequency signal. The low frequency sparker source is ultimately capable of generating selectable peak frequencies of 1 to 40 Hz with high-frequency spectra content to 10 kHz. The lower frequencies and, perhaps, low-frequency sweeps, are needed to achieve sufficient range and resolution for realtime imaging in deep (15, 000 ft+), high-temperature (150 C) wells for (a) <b>geosteering,</b> (b) accurate seismic hole depth, (c) accurate pore pressure determinations ahead of the bit, (d) near wellbore diagnostics with a downhole receiver and wired drill pipe, and (e) reservoir model verification. Furthermore, the pressure of the sparker bubble will disintegrate rock resulting in an increased overall rates of penetration. Other applications for the SeismicPULSER{trademark} technology are to deploy a low-frequency source for greater range on a wireline for Reverse Vertical Seismic Profiling (RVSP) and Cross-Well Tomography. Commercialization of the technology is being undertaken by first contacting stakeholders to define the value proposition for rig site services utilizing SeismicPULSER{trademark} technologies. Stakeholders include national oil companies, independent oil companies, independents, service companies, and commercial investors. Service companies will introduce a new Drill Bit SWD service for deep HTHP wells. Collaboration will be encouraged between stakeholders in the form of joint industry projects to develop prototype tools and initial field trials. No barriers have been identified for developing, utilizing, and exploiting the low-frequency SeismicPULSER{trademark} source in a variety of applications. Risks will be minimized since Drill Bit SWD will not interfere with the drilling operation, and can be performed in a relatively quiet environment when the pumps are turned off. The new source must be integrated with other Measurement While Drilling (MWD) tools. To date, each of the oil companies and service companies contacted have shown interest in participating in the commercialization of the low-frequency SeismicPULSER{trademark} source. A technical paper has been accepted for presentation at the 2009 Offshore Technology Conference (OTC) in a Society of Exploration Geologists/American Association of Petroleum Geophysicists (SEG/AAPG) technical session...|$|E
