25|$|This {{evidence}} {{was enough to}} lead police to Dyer, but they still had no strong evidence to connect her directly with a serious crime. Additional evidence they gleaned from witnesses, and information obtained from Bristol police, only served to increase their concerns, and D.C. Anderson, with Sgt.

This may have been designed to help the detectives to positively link Dyer to her business activities, or it may have simply given them a reliable opportunity to arrest her.|$|E

500|$|Perennially [...] "unlucky in love", Donna {{fits the}} tart {{with a heart}} stereotype. Her {{numerous}} romances during her tenure earned her the nickname [...] "Nurse 'Action' Jackson". In 2004, she had a lesbian liaison with Mickie. The scene in which they kissed was edited to half its original length after being deemed too explicit for pre-watershed broadcast. Later that year, Jacobs stated that her ideal storyline would be for Donna {{to find a good}} man and gain a promotion, <b>hoping</b> <b>she</b> would find someone who would treat her well and help her give up her recreational drug habit.

He treated her badly, to the point that he would only have sex with her in a toilet stall; nonetheless Jacobs assessed that Donna was in love with him, believing him to be [...] "the one" [...] and different from her previous lovers, branding her deluded in this respect.|$|E
