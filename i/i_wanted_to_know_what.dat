500|$|I {{left this}} church at age 18.... <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> was happening, {{why so many}} {{seemingly}} good people didn't believe in any organized religion yet cared passionately about their behavior and value of their lives.... I broke with the church.... I wrote many novels that without my being aware that they reflected my quest for meaning in a world without God." ...|$|E
500|$|Guillory {{explained}} that she [...] "became an actor because <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> {{it was like to}} be other people. Because possibly I don't like myself", and later said [...] "I hate acting, really hate it. I kind of fell into it sideways ... I started acting because I got offered a job when I was 16, and they wanted to pay me Â£8,000, and we'd always lived on Family Support". She went on to say that her frustration with later film roles left her bitter, but after seeing Helen Mirren onstage she was inspired again.|$|E
60|$|And I've {{read his}} letters, too--because <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> he was doing. I steamed one open, {{and he saw}} it, and he never said a word.|$|E
6000|$|... "Never {{you mind}} what I've heard. Who is she? IS IT MRS. M.

6000|$|... "What <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know,</b> George," [...] the old gentleman said, after slowly smacking {{his first}} bumper--"what <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> is, how you and--ah--that little thing upstairs, are {{carrying}} on?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It's not a {{question}} of my right over you--though I HAVE some right, remember. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know,</b> <b>I</b> only <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what it is that subjugates you to that little scum of a sculptor downstairs, what it is that brings you down like a humble maggot, in worship of him. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what you creep after.' ...|$|R
60|$|I {{told him}} <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> {{was in that}} letter. My sternness of tone and {{behaviour}} was only half assumed. Curiosity {{can be a very}} fierce sentiment--at times.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{did like}} him," [...] Rachel mused, as if {{speaking}} to herself. [...] "I {{wanted to talk}} to him; <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> he'd done. The women in Lancashire--" ...|$|E
60|$|And {{he struck}} me {{lightly on the}} chest for emphasis. Disregarding his peculiarities of manner, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> all this {{had to do with}} the man being an anarchist.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Link. You didn't expect I'd {{follow you}} so soon, did you?" [...] cried Roger. [...] "Now, I've {{got a nice}} account to settle with you. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what you did with my suit-case, and <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> {{what you mean by}} impersonating me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{was only}} goin' to say. You was! You was only goin' to say--what was you goin' to say? That's it!

6000|$|... "Stop!" [...] said I, {{almost in}} a frenzy of fear and dislike, [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> speak <b>to</b> you. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what is <b>to</b> be done. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> how you are to be kept out of danger, how long you are going to stay, what {{projects}} you have." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{happened}} to you?" [...] said I again, for <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> {{she thought about}} my sudden appearance. It took some little {{time for her to}} get ready to answer, and then she said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I don't {{want to buy}} anything," [...] Saxon said. [...] "I make {{nice things}} like you have here, and <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> you pay for them--for that breakfast cap in the window, for instance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sh-sh-sh..." [...] whispered Candeille eagerly, as she {{approached}} quite close to Marguerite and drew her hood still lower over her eyes. [...] "I am all alone ...

6000|$|... "At last I {{got down}} into the hold, and there I found {{a great number of}} big hogsheads, that were packed in so well under the deck that they had never moved in all these years.

6000|$|He {{might have}} said more, if Mr. Kendal, with Maurice on his knee, had not {{looked as if he}} {{expected}} it; and that look sealed Albinia's lips against expressing regret for the provocation; but Maurice exclaimed, 'Never mind, Algernon, it was all fair, and it doesn't hurt now. I wouldn't have touched your image, but that <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> you would do to me. Shake hands; people always do when they've had a good mill.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I will admit," [...] Phineas Duge said coldly, [...] "that {{personally}} I have {{no interest}} or any concern in you. But nevertheless there are two matters which must bring us together {{so far as the}} holding of a few minutes' conversation can count. In the first place, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> whether you are going {{to make use of the}} paper which my daughter stole, and which you feloniously received? In the second place, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> how much or what you will accept for the return of that paper?

60|$|Curiosity got {{the better}} of me. If the men were hired by Buell <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> they were quarrelling about. I stole stealthily from tree to tree, and another hollow opened beneath me. It was so wide and the pines so overshadowed it that I could not tell how close the {{opposite}} side might be to the campfire. I slipped down {{along the edge of the}} trail. The blaze disappeared. Only a faint arc of light showed through the gloom.|$|E
60|$|I {{let them}} know, that by my {{direction}} {{the ship had}} been seized, that she lay now in the road, and they might see by and by, that their new captain had received the reward of his villany; for that they might see him hanging at the yard-arm: that as to them, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> they had to say, why I should not execute them as pirates taken in the fact, as by my commission they could not doubt I had authority to do.|$|E
6000|$|... "When I became {{conscious}} {{again the}} chief thing present {{in my mind}} was that all those fellows round were young soldiers who wouldn't at all understand bad behaviour. My arm was--orchestral, but still far from being real suffering IN me. Also <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> Challoner had got.

When I sent my servant on to you, I strolled in {{here because the}} place was new to me; and I had a natural curiosity in {{everything}} new and old, in these old scenes; and it was outside the town. I wanted to communicate with you, first, before appearing there. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> people would say to me. I see by your manner that you can tell me.

6000|$|... "What {{big eyes}} she has," [...] {{he said to}} himself amazed. No wonder. She was staring at him with all the might of her soul {{awakening}} slowly from a poisoned sleep, in which it could only quiver with pain but could neither expand nor move. He plunged into them breathless and tense, deep, deep, like a mad sailor taking a desperate dive from the masthead into the blue unfathomable sea so many men have execrated and loved at the same time. And his vanity was immense. It had been touched to the quick by that muscular little feminist, Fyne. [...] "I! I! Take advantage of her helplessness. I! Unfair to that creature--that wisp of mist, that white shadow homeless in an ugly dirty world. I could blow her away with a breath," [...] he was saying to himself with horror. [...] "Never!" [...] All the supremely refined delicacy of tenderness, expressed in so many fine lines of verse by Carleon Anthony, grew {{to the size of a}} passion filling with inward sobs the big frame of the man who had never in his life read a single one of those famous sonnets singing of the most highly civilised, chivalrous love, of those sonnets which ... You know there's a volume of them. My edition has the portrait of the author at thirty, and when I showed it to Mr Powell the other day he exclaimed: [...] "Wonderful! One would think this the portrait of Captain Anthony himself if..." [...] <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> that if was. But Powell could not say. There was something--a difference. No doubt there was--in fineness perhaps. The father, fastidious, cerebral, morbidly shrinking from all contacts, could only sing in harmonious numbers of what the son felt with a dumb and reckless sincerity.|$|E
6000|$|After these ceremonies were past, {{and after}} all his good things were brought into my little apartment, we began to consult {{what was to be}} done with the prisoners we had; for it was worth {{considering}} whether we might venture to take them away with us or no, especially two of them, whom he knew to be incorrigible and refractory to the last degree; and the captain said he knew they were such rogues, that there was no obliging them; and if he did carry them away, it must be in irons, as malefactors, to be delivered over to justice at the first English colony he could come at; and I found that the captain himself was very anxious about it. Upon this I told him, that if he desired it, I would undertake to bring the two men he spoke of to make it their own request that he should leave them upon the island. [...] "I should be very glad of that," [...] says the captain, [...] "with all my heart."--"Well," [...] says I, [...] "I will send for them up, and talk with them for you," [...] So I caused Friday and the two hostages, for they were now discharged, their comrades having performed their promise; I say, I caused them to go to the cave, and bring up the five men, pinioned as they were, to the bower, and keep them there till I came. After some time, I came thither dressed in my new habit; and now I was called governor again. Being all met, and the captain with me, I caused the men to be brought before me, and I told them I had got a full account of their villanous behaviour to the captain, and how they had run away with the ship, and were, preparing to commit farther robberies, but that Providence had ensnared them in their own ways, and that they were fallen into the pit which they had dug for others. I let them know that by my direction the ship had been seized; that she lay now in the road; and they might see, by and by, that their new captain had received the reward of his villany, and that they would see him hanging at the yard-arm: that as to them, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> they had to say why I should not execute them as pirates, taken in the fact, as by my commission they could not doubt but I had authority so to do.|$|E
