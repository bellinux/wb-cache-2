5|$|Bush had {{originally}} outlined an ambitious <b>domestic</b> <b>agenda,</b> but his priorities were significantly altered following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Wars were waged in Afghanistan and Iraq, {{and there were}} significant domestic debates regarding immigration, healthcare, Social Security, economic policy, and treatment of terrorist detainees. Over an eight-year period, Bush's once-high approval ratings steadily declined, while his disapproval numbers increased significantly. In 2007, the United States entered the longest post-World War II recession.|$|E
5|$|When World War II focused President Franklin D. Roosevelt's {{attention}} on foreign affairs, Barkley gained {{influence over the}} administration's <b>domestic</b> <b>agenda.</b> He resigned as floor leader after Roosevelt ignored his advice and vetoed the Revenue Act of 1943. The veto was overridden and the Democratic caucus supported and unanimously re-elected Barkley {{to the position of}} Majority Leader. Barkley had a good working relationship with Harry S. Truman, who ascended to the presidency after Roosevelt's death in 1945. With Truman's popularity waning entering the 1948 Democratic National Convention, Barkley gave a keynote address that energized the delegates. Truman selected him as his running mate for the upcoming election and the Democratic ticket scored an upset victory. Barkley took {{an active role in the}} Truman administration, acting as its primary spokesman, especially after the Korean War necessitated the majority of Truman's attention. When Truman announced that he would not seek re-election in 1952, Barkley began organizing a presidential campaign, but labor leaders refused to endorse his candidacy because of his age, and he withdrew from the race. He retired but was coaxed back into public life, defeating incumbent Republican Senator John Sherman Cooper in 1954. Barkley died of a heart attack while giving a speech at the Washington and Lee Mock Convention on April 30, 1956.|$|E

25|$|Abstract: While their {{different}} public personas, political interests, and institutional duties led to occasional disagreement, President Richard Nixon and Senate Minority Leader Scott {{were not always}} unhappily tethered as evidenced by their stances on domestic and foreign issues throughout Nixon's presidency, during 1968–74. While he jousted with Nixon over racial policies and his Supreme Court nominations, including his choice of Judge Clement F. Haynsworth, Jr., of South Carolina, Scott supported much of Nixon's <b>domestic</b> <b>agenda,</b> applauded the president's conduct of foreign affairs, backed his Vietnam policy, praised his invasion of Cambodia, publicly proclaimed Nixon's innocence during the Watergate scandal, and endorsed President Gerald Ford's pardon of his predecessor. The Nixon-Scott relationship is notable because it confirms scholars' assumptions about Nixon's hot-and-cold association with Congress and indicates that sparring between moderate Republicans like Nixon and Scott {{was on its way}} out.|$|E

500|$|Bush {{began his}} second term by {{outlining}} a major initiative to [...] "reform" [...] Social Security, which was facing record deficit projections beginning in 2005. Bush made it the centerpiece of his <b>domestic</b> <b>agenda</b> despite opposition from some in the U.S. Congress. In his 2005 State of the Union Address, Bush discussed the potential impending bankruptcy {{of the program and}} outlined his new program, which included partial privatization of the system, personal Social Security accounts, and options to permit Americans to divert a portion of their Social Security tax (FICA) into secured investments. Democrats opposed the proposal to partially privatize the system.|$|E
500|$|Various {{development}} attempts {{dominated the}} <b>domestic</b> <b>agenda</b> during Maga's administration. [...] Unlike {{many other countries}} in Africa at the time, this did not involve nationalizing many of the industries in the country. Instead the country sought to expand its foreign tourism sector and oil exploration along the coast. The country, using French and German investment, {{began a series of}} projects to create resorts and tourist potential along the coast of the country. Union Oil had begun oil exploration off the coast of the country in the 1960s but had withdrawn in the chaos of 1970. Maga was able to secure a new contract with Shell Oil to begin a 9-year exploration deal in 1971. The agreement with the unions and other investments within the country were largely financed through a significant loan from the French government. However, at the same time, the three members of the council were provided significant personal wealth through the arrangement. Each was provided significant funds to spend on their presidential residences, payment for many members of a personal staff, and given identical Mercedes-Benz W108s. Trade from the country increased by 14% during the Presidential Council although large trade and budget deficits remained.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{other studies}} on the {{influence}} to Colombian <b>domestic</b> <b>agenda</b> from US military aid have demonstrated controversial results. Different from the stereotypical belief that foreign aid is supposed to strengthen a weak state’s governing capacity or to lower violence, US’s military assistance in actuality worsens Colombian’s domestic violence by introducing higher level of paramilitary attacks as well as decreasing anti narcotics operations. Also, evidence also shows that US aid does not help lower violence related {{to the production of}} drug crops such as coca.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{some changes}} in the economic 'landscape' (policy cultures, institutions, infrastructures, regulations, and economic processes) within which the European Framework Programmes are formed and implemented. The main changes are: the <b>domestic</b> reform <b>agenda</b> of liberalisation, privatisation and deregulation; and the changed globalisation environment. The paper argues that these reforms have transformed the infrastructural conditions underlying technological change in ways that require attention from policymakers. In particular, the <b>domestic</b> reform <b>agendas</b> have had an unintended side-effect - the diminution or closure of large-scale technological and engineering capabilities in formerly publicly-owned industries. Changing concepts of, and approaches to, R&D and innovation necessitate shifts in policy approaches and instruments towards a greater focus on knowledge infrastructures: this is a major challenge facing the Framework Programmes...|$|R
40|$|The {{restructuring}} in the Chinese telecom {{sector in}} 2008 has prompted heated discussion among telecom analysts and experts. Past research tends {{to take an}} optimistic view that China {{has embarked on a}} liberalizing route, resulting in utopian projections that domestic competition and foreign liberalizing forces would lead to the emergence of a telecom market operated primarily under the principles of free market economics in the near term. This paper, instead, argues that current telecom restructuring was largely driven by <b>domestic</b> <b>agendas.</b> Drawing from the bargaining perspective, this paper finds that, {{while it is true that}} market mechanisms play a significant role in the telecom industry, the impact of competition and privatization on the telecom market ultimately depends on the political endowments of Chinese society.

40|$|The {{dominant}} {{explanation for}} limited rule transfer under the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) is its weak incentive structure, {{in particular the}} absence of a membership perspective. However, a certain rule transfer has occurred, albeit in a strikingly selective and uneven way. This article formulates an alternative model for explaining the variance in rule transfer under the ENP. Refuting conditionality and asymmetrical interdependence as having insufficient explanatory value, rule transfer is explained on the basis of three interrelated factors. First, the usefulness of ENP provisions for <b>domestic</b> <b>agendas.</b> Secondly, the process of active legitimacy-seeking with the EU, driven by the subjective perception of accession prospects. Thirdly, the institutional design of the ENP itself, in particular its differentiated approach and lack of finality, which give the policy a strong political character...|$|R
40|$|With several rising powers {{emerging}} as new actors on the humanitarian scene, viewing all ‘emerging donors’ as a homogenous group inevitably undermines efforts to constructively engage with them. With Turkey’s widely recognized engagement in Somalia and Syria, the country merits a nuanced analysis. How does it conceptualize humanitarian assistance? What norms and interests shape its humanitarian engagement? How {{is such an}} engagement financed and organized? Thoroughly evaluating how foreign and <b>domestic</b> <b>agendas</b> shape Turkey’s humanitarian engagement, the paper details how Ankara designs and implements its humanitarian assistance. The collaborative relationship between the government, faith-based businesses, and the religious segment of a generally deeply divided civil society emerges as a unique feature of Turkey’s humanitarian assistance. This set-up calls for an informed approach towards working with specific Turkish actors. It also questions the sustainability and scalability of current aid levels...|$|R

The far left (comprising Communist Party members and fellow travelers) wanted to continue détente with Russia, and followed FDR's vice president Henry Wallace in a quixotic crusade in 1948 that failed to win broad support and, indeed, largely destroyed the far left in the Democratic party.

I argue that kin-states undergoing transition are more prone to intervene in external conflicts than states that are not, regardless of the salience of minority demands in the host-state. The transition weakens the institutions of the kin-state. Experiencing limited institutional constraints, self-seeking state officials create alliances with secessionist and autonomist movements across borders alongside their own ideological, clan-based and particularistic interests. Such alliances are often utilized to advance radical <b>domestic</b> <b>agendas.</b> Unlike in Albania's transition environment, in Turkey there were no emerging elites that could potentially form alliances and use external movements to legitimize their own domestic existence or claims.

40|$|Current, admittedly {{incomplete}} evidence, {{suggests a}} deteriorating working {{environment in the}} new Member States {{of central and eastern}} Europe. Moreover, support for occupational health and safety regulation concerning the working environment appears to be limited among business and political elites in the new Member States.

The European Commission has also currently adopted 'deregulationary' assumptions concerning the need to 'simplify' the "acquis", as well as advocating 'soft law' as an alternative to traditional regulatory instruments such as directives. However, the lack of contextual industrial relations supports, in particular, the power imbalance in industrial relations due to the weakness of trade unions and social dialogue at workplace level, make uncertain prospects for 'soft law' as a strategy for working environment improvements in the new Member States.
