There {{are many}} {{factors that affect}} the safety and {{reliability}} of large winding hoist’s cylinder shell structure，and {{most of them are}} of more or less randomness，But,in the reliability analysis of tube shell structure, For factors on the tube shell vary from degrees of structural failure. Therefore, It is of great significance to study the size of the various factors that affect the reliability of the tube shell structure. In this paper, the large winding <b>hoist</b> <b>cylinder</b> shell reliability sensitivity were calculated and analyzed using the latest achievements of reliability sensitivity calculation. The results show that，the mean square deviation of strength (r) and stress (s) are larger, the tube shell structure becomes more insecure, and the strength (r) to tube failure rate of the shell structure is getting much larger than the stress (s). The intensity (r) on the tube shell is greater than stress (s) on the impact of structural failure ， respective proportion is 82. 24 % and 17. 76 %. we will strictly control the intensity’s change in designing, manufacturing and using of large winding <b>hoist</b> <b>cylinder</b> shell structure, and As far as possible to the direction of the large fluctuations; For the stress (s), will as far as possible so that the direction to small fluctuations. This theoretical research and practical calculation of the structure have a larger theoretical significance and practical value in studying <b>hoist</b> <b>cylinder</b> shell structure on design, manufacture and use...|$|E

40|$|Telemetry is the {{technology}} that allows data measurement at a distance. It uses data loggers which record data over time or in relation to location, either with built-in instruments or through instruments and sensors. The system discussed in the paper {{is based on a}} Peripheral Interface Controller (PIC 18 F 4550), a series of sensors, a Radio Frequency (RF) link and a Graphical User Interface (GUI) developed using Visual Basic (VB). The system was designed to monitor mining vehicles by measuring engine temperature, transmission temperature, hydraulic oil temperature and hydraulic pressure in pumps and <b>hoist</b> <b>cylinders.</b> The data measured by the sensors in the mining vehicles (the plant) is transmitted to the Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition System (SCADA) through the RF link. The RF link uses a transmission frequency of 433. 95 Mega Hertz (MHz) to enable flawless communication between the plant and the SCADA. The developed prototype was simulated using small pressurized containers and heating systems and the results were displayed on the GUI. The whole system development process was a multi-discipline project and it showed that RF communications are very reliable in data transmission...|$|R

50|$|It {{was decided}} to install new large smelters, with 200 tons daily {{capacity}} and powerful mining machinery, and to dam Return Creek to provide adequate water for the treatment plant. Also, multi-tubular boilers, a powerful double <b>cylinder</b> <b>hoisting</b> engine, stone crushers, air compressors, a sawmill and water pumping station were established {{in association with the}} mining of the Mount Garnet lode. A railway to serve the mine was also planned.|$|R
5000|$|A typical {{alternating}} current furnace {{is powered by}} a three-phase electrical supply and therefore has three electrodes. Electrodes are round in section, and typically in segments with threaded couplings, so that as the electrodes wear, new segments can be added. The arc forms between the charged material and the electrode, the charge is heated both by current passing through the charge and by the radiant energy evolved by the arc. The electric arc temperature reaches around 3000 °C (5000 °F), thus causing the lower sections of the electrodes glow incandescently when in operation. The electrodes are automatically raised and lowered by a positioning system, which may use either electric winch <b>hoists</b> or hydraulic <b>cylinders.</b> The regulating system maintains approximately constant current and power input during the melting of the charge, even though scrap may move under the electrodes as it melts. The mast arms holding the electrodes can either carry heavy busbars (which may be hollow water-cooled copper pipes carrying current to the electrode clamps) or be [...] "hot arms", where the whole arm carries the current, increasing efficiency. Hot arms can be made from copper-clad steel or aluminium. Large water-cooled cables connect the bus tubes or arms with the transformer located adjacent to the furnace. The transformer is installed in a vault and is water-cooled.|$|R
