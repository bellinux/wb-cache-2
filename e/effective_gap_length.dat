40|$|AbstractIn hot {{and humid}} country, {{ventilation}} and thermal performance could be improved by effective natural ventilation strategies. However, the climatic conditions of the tropical countries are mainly distinguished by high air temperature and relative humidity as well as low wind velocity which are the main factors that reduce the comfort level of occupants, especially in the terrace house. The use of solar chimney in terrace house is one of alternatives to increase the thermal and ventilation performance of the indoor environment. This study initiated with field measurement in a selected case study house located in Kuching, Sarawak, Malaysia for software validation. Validation study of CFD in DesignBuilder software was done by compared with field measurement data, with the deviation ranges from 7. 2 % to 18 %. The optimizations of solar chimney cross section were carried out. The results of CFD were observed in order to study the optimized <b>length</b> and width <b>gap</b> of solar chimney that could induce optimum air velocity and thermal performance in the indoor environment. The {{results show that the}} <b>effective</b> width <b>gap</b> for 36 m 3 room ranged from 0. 6 m to 1. 0 m while the length from 1. 5 m to 2. 0 m, whereby the induced air speed ranged from 0. 04 m/s to 0. 223 m/s. Based on the findings, the study has shown that the <b>effective</b> <b>gap</b> and <b>length</b> of solar chimney could increase the air velocity of indoor environment that creates a cooling effect on human body, especially for terrace house in Malaysia climate...|$|R

Materials and Methods: All consecutive cases of EA-TEF were included and different patient parameters were recorded. Plain radiographs with a nasogastric tube in the upper esophagus were taken. Patients were grouped into T 1 -T 2; T 2 -T 3; T 3 -T 4; and T 4 depending on the thoracic vertebral level of the arrest of the tube.

Birth weight was found to be significantly lower in Group A (mean = 2. 14 kg) as compared to Group B (mean = 2. 38 kg) and Group C patients (mean = 2. 49 kg) (P = 0. 016).

It is well established that ablation lines can be discontinuous and that conduction through the gaps in ablation lines can be affected by tissue heating. In this study, {{we looked at the}} effect of tissue conductivity and propagation of electric wave fronts across ablation lines with gaps, using both simulations and an animal model. Methods and Results—For the simulations, we implemented a 2 -dimensional bidomain model of the cardiac syncytium, simulating ablation lines with <b>gaps</b> of varying <b>lengths,</b> conductivity, and orientation. For the animal model, transmural ablation lines with a gap were created in 7 mongrel dogs. The <b>gap</b> <b>length</b> was progressively decreased until there was conduction block. The ablation line with a gap was then imaged using MRI and was correlated with histology. With normal conductivity in the gap and the ablation line oriented parallel to the fiber direction, the simulation predicted that the maximum <b>gap</b> <b>length</b> that exhibited conduction block was 1. 4 mm. As the conductivity was decreased, the maximum <b>gap</b> <b>length</b> with conduction block increased substantially, that is, with a conductivity of 67 % of normal, the maximum <b>gap</b> <b>length</b> with conduction block increased to 4 mm. In the canine studies, the maximum <b>gap</b> <b>length</b> that displayed conduction block acutely as measured by gross pathology correlated well (R 2 of 0. 81) with that measured by MRI.

In the relentless progress to make computer chips faster, smaller, and cheaper, the CMP process plays a prominent role. One of its limitations, however, is non-uniform polishing rate at the die and wafer scales. In this thesis, an innovative CMP machine configuration is proposed to minimize wafer-scale non-uniformity. The new face-up machine lowers wafer-scale non-uniformity by minimizing over-polishing of any particular area. The thesis discusses the kinematics and design considerations of this machine. Additionally, this thesis develops an analytical model for slurry flow in CMP in two steps. First, a simple but useful method of estimating the <b>effective</b> <b>gap</b> between the wafer and the pad during polishing is developed. The method uses pressurized fluid flow and an analytical model to estimate the <b>effective</b> <b>gap</b> between the wafer and the pad. Second, this <b>effective</b> <b>gap</b> is used in the Couette model that describes the slurry behavior in CMP. The Couette model shows that rotational speeds of the wafer and pad, the <b>effective</b> <b>gap,</b> and the sizes of the wafer and pad dictate the slurry flow rate and flow pattern in both conventional CMP and the new face-up CMP. The Couette model can be used to estimate the slurry flow rate whenever the process parameters are changed. by Krzysztof D. Kopanski. Thesis (S. M.)
