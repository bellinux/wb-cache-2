5|$|An {{aneurysm}} may {{be detected}} incidentally on brain imaging; this presents a conundrum, as all treatments for cerebral aneurysms {{are associated with}} potential complications. The International Study of Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysms (ISUIA) provided prognostic data both in people having previously had a subarachnoid hemorrhage and people who had aneurysms detected by other means. Those having previously had a SAH {{were more likely to}} bleed from other aneurysms. In contrast, those having never bled and had small aneurysms (smaller than 10mm) were very unlikely to have a SAH and were likely to sustain harm from attempts to repair these aneurysms. On the basis of the ISUIA and other studies, it is now recommended that people are considered for preventive treatment only if they have a reasonable life expectancy and have aneurysms that are highly likely to rupture. At the same time, there is only limited evidence that <b>endovascular</b> treatment of unruptured aneurysms is actually beneficial.|$|E
5|$|The first {{surgical}} {{intervention was}} performed by Norman Dott, who was a pupil of Harvey Cushing then working in Edinburgh. He introduced the wrapping of aneurysms in the 1930s, and was an early pioneer {{in the use of}} angiograms. American neurosurgeon Dr Walter Dandy, working in Baltimore, was the first to introduce clips in 1938. Microsurgery was applied to aneurysm treatment in 1972 in order to further improve outcomes. The 1980s saw the introduction of triple H therapy as a treatment for delayed ischemia due to vasospasm, and trials with nimodipine in an attempt to prevent this complication. In 1983, the Russian neurosurgeon Zubkov and colleagues reported the first use of transluminal balloon angioplasty for vasospasm after aneurysmal SAH. The Italian neurosurgeon Dr. Guido Guglielmi introduced his <b>endovascular</b> coil treatment in 1991.|$|E
25|$|<b>Endovascular</b> {{treatment}} {{can be an}} effective and safe alternative to open surgery, with less postoperative complications, faster recovery time, and reduced need for intensive care, while offering patency rates and procedural success rates comparable with those of surgery. This notwithstanding, long‐term results of <b>endovascular</b> treatment in BD are still to be determined.|$|E
25|$|Emergency {{treatment}} {{for individuals with}} a ruptured cerebral aneurysm generally includes restoring deteriorating respiration and reducing intracranial pressure. Currently there are two treatment options for securing intracranial aneurysms: surgical clipping or <b>endovascular</b> coiling. If possible, either surgical clipping or <b>endovascular</b> coiling is usually performed within the first 24 hours after bleeding to occlude the ruptured aneurysm and {{reduce the risk of}} rebleeding.|$|E
25|$|<b>Endovascular</b> repair {{first became}} {{practical}} in the 1990s {{and although it}} is now an established alternative to open repair, its role {{is yet to be}} clearly defined. It is generally indicated in older, high-risk patients or patients unfit for open repair. However, <b>endovascular</b> repair is feasible for only a proportion of AAAs, depending on the morphology of the aneurysm. The main advantages over open repair are that there is less peri-operative mortality, less time in intensive care, less time in hospital overall and earlier return to normal activity. Disadvantages of <b>endovascular</b> repair include a requirement for more frequent ongoing hospital reviews, and a higher chance of further procedures being required. According to the latest studies, the EVAR procedure does not offer any benefit for overall survival or health-related quality of life compared to open surgery, although aneurysm-related mortality is lower. In patients unfit for open repair, EVAR plus conservative management was associated with no benefit, more complications, subsequent procedures and higher costs compared to conservative management alone. <b>Endovascular</b> treatment for paraanastomotic aneurysms after aortobiiliac reconstruction is also a possibility. A 2017 Cochrane review found tentative evidence of no difference in outcomes between <b>endovascular</b> and open repair of ruptured AAA in the first month.|$|E

25|$|Stone {{was hospitalized}} on September 29, 2001, for a subarachnoid hemorrhage, which was {{diagnosed}} as a vertebral artery dissection rather than the more common ruptured aneurysm, and treated with an <b>endovascular</b> coil embolization.|$|E
25|$|While a large {{meta-analysis}} {{found the}} outcomes and risks of surgical clipping and <b>endovascular</b> coiling to be statistically similar, no consensus has been reached. In particular, the large randomised control trial International Subarachnoid Aneurysm Trial appears {{to indicate a}} higher rate of recurrence when intracerebral aneurysms are treated using <b>endovascular</b> coiling. Analysis of data from this trial has indicated a 7% lower eight-year mortality rate with coiling, a high rate of aneurysm recurrence in aneurysms treated with coiling—from 28.6-33.6% within a year, a 6.9 times greater rate of late retreatment for coiled aneurysms, and a rate of rebleeding 8 times higher than surgically-clipped aneurysms.|$|E
25|$|Also, {{the shift}} towards <b>endovascular</b> {{treatment}} of abdominal aortic aneurysms pushed {{the spread of}} angiographic systems in vascular OR environments. Particularly for complex endografts, a hybrid operating theater should be a basic requirement. Also, it is well-suited for emergency treatment.|$|E
25|$|Aneurysms {{can also}} be {{classified}} by their macroscopic shape and size, and are described as either saccular or fusiform. The shape of an aneurysm is not specific for a specific disease. The size of the base or neck is useful in determining the chance of for example <b>endovascular</b> coiling.|$|E
25|$|Historically, the {{treatment}} of arterial aneurysms has been limited to either surgical intervention, or watchful waiting in combination with control of blood pressure. In recent years, <b>endovascular</b> or minimally invasive techniques {{have been developed for}} many types of aneurysms. Aneurysm Clips are used for surgical procedure i.e. clipping of aneurysms.|$|E
25|$|Surgery for aortic {{dissection}} {{was first}} introduced and developed by Michael E. DeBakey, Denton Cooley, and Oscar Creech, cardiac surgeons associated with the Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, in 1954. DeBakey developed aortic dissection himself at age 97 in 2005, and underwent surgery in 2006. <b>Endovascular</b> treatment of aortic dissection {{was developed in the}} 1990s.|$|E
25|$|Surgical {{treatment}} of arterial manifestations of BD bears many pitfalls, since the obliterative endarteritis of vasa vasorum causes thickening of the medial layer and splitting of elastin fibers. Therefore, anastomotic pseudoaneurysms {{are likely to}} form, as well as pseudoaneurysms {{at the site of}} puncture in case of angiography or <b>endovascular</b> treatment; furthermore, early graft occlusion may occur.|$|E
25|$|Renal aneurysms {{are very}} rare {{consisting}} of only 0.1–0.09% while rupture {{is even more}} rare. Conservative treatment with control of concomitant hypertension being the primary option with aneurysms smaller than 3cm. If symptoms occur, or enlargement of the aneurysm, then <b>endovascular</b> or open repair should be considered. Pregnant women (due to high rupture risk of up to 80%) should be treated surgically.|$|E
25|$|If lesions are present, {{they are}} watched closely {{for changes in}} size. Prognosis is best when lesions are less than 3cm in length. Most {{complications}} occur when the lesions are greater than 6cm in size. Surgical intervention for intracranial lesions has been done successfully. Nonsurgical treatments include embolization, radiation therapy, and continued observation. Arterial vascular malformations may be treated with the cyberknife treatment. Possible treatment for cerebral arterial vascular malformations include stereotactic radiosurgery, <b>endovascular</b> embolization, and microsurgical resection.|$|E
25|$|Prevention is {{by blood}} {{pressure}} control and not smoking. The treatment of aortic dissection {{depends on the}} part of the aorta involved. Surgery is usually required for dissections that involve the first part of the aorta, while those that do not can typically be treated with blood pressure and heart-rate lowering unless complications result. Surgery may be done either by an opening in the chest or by <b>endovascular</b> aneurysm repair (carried out from inside the blood vessels).|$|E
25|$|Reperfusion {{therapy is}} a medical {{treatment}} to restore blood flow, either through or around, blocked arteries, typically {{after a heart attack}} (myocardial infarction) (MI). Reperfusion therapy includes drugs and surgery. The drugs are thrombolytics and fibrinolytics used in a process called thrombolysis. Surgeries performed may be minimally-invasive <b>endovascular</b> procedures such as a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), followed by a coronary angioplasty. The angioplasty uses the insertion of a balloon to open up the artery, with the possible additional use of one or more stents. Other surgeries performed are the more invasive bypass surgeries that graft arteries around blockages.|$|E
25|$|<b>Endovascular</b> coiling {{refers to}} the {{insertion}} of platinum coils into the aneurysm. A catheter is inserted into a blood vessel, typically the femoral artery, and passed through blood vessels into the cerebral circulation and the aneurysm. Coils are pushed into the aneurysm, or released into the blood stream ahead of the aneurysm. Upon depositing within the aneurysm, the coils expand and initiate a thrombotic reaction within the aneurysm. If successful, this prevents further bleeding from the aneurysm. In the case of broad-based aneurysms, a stent may be passed first into the parent artery {{to serve as a}} scaffold for the coils.|$|E
25|$|For the {{treatment}} of trauma patients every minute counts. Patients with severe bleedings after car accidents, explosions, gunshot wounds or aortic dissections, etc. need immediate care due to the life-threatening blood loss. In a hybrid operating room both open and <b>endovascular</b> treatment of the patient can be performed. For example, {{the tension in the}} brain due to a severe haemorrhage can be relieved and the aneurysm can be coiled. The concept of placing the emergency patient on an operating table as soon as he/she enters the hospital, if stable perform a trauma scan in the CT or if instable immediate procedure in the hybrid operating room without having to reposition the patient can save valuable time and reduce risk of further injury.|$|E
25|$|An {{abdominal}} {{aortic aneurysm}} is usually diagnosed by physical exam, ultrasound, or CT. Plain abdominal radiographs may show {{the outline of}} an aneurysm when its walls are calcified. However, {{this is the case}} in less than half of all aneurysms. Ultrasonography is used to screen for aneurysms and to determine the size of any present. Additionally, free peritoneal fluid can be detected. It is noninvasive and sensitive, but the presence of bowel gas or obesity may limit its usefulness. CT scan has a nearly 100% sensitivity for an aneurysm and is also useful in preoperative planning, detailing the anatomy and possibility for <b>endovascular</b> repair. In the case of suspected rupture, it can also reliably detect retroperitoneal fluid. Alternative less often used methods for visualization of an aneurysm include MRI and angiography.|$|E
25|$|Not {{smoking is}} the single best way to prevent the disease. Other methods of {{prevention}} include treating high blood pressure, treating high blood cholesterol and not being overweight. Surgery is usually recommended when an AAA's diameter grows to >5.5cm in males and >5.0cm in females. Other reasons for repair include the presence of symptoms and a rapid increase in size (more than one centimeter per year). Repair may be either by open surgery or <b>endovascular</b> aneurysm repair (EVAR). As compared to open surgery, EVAR has a lower risk {{of death in the}} short term and a shorter hospital stay, but may not always be an option. There {{does not appear to be}} a difference in longer term outcomes between the two. With EVAR there is a higher need for repeat procedures.|$|E
25|$|For aneurysms in the aorta, arms, legs, or head, the {{weakened}} {{section of}} the vessel may {{be replaced by a}} bypass graft that is sutured at the vascular stumps. Instead of sewing, the graft tube ends, made rigid and expandable by nitinol wireframe, can be easily inserted in its reduced diameter into the vascular stumps and then expanded up to the most appropriate diameter and permanently fixed there by external ligature. New devices were recently developed to substitute the external ligature by expandable ring allowing use in acute ascending aorta dissection, providing airtight (i.e. not dependent on the coagulation integrity), easy and quick anastomosis extended to the arch concavity Less invasive <b>endovascular</b> techniques allow covered metallic stent grafts to be inserted through the arteries of the leg and deployed across the aneurysm.|$|E
25|$|There is as of 2012 {{insufficient}} evidence to determine effectiveness or safety. Further trials {{are required to}} determine if the benefits, if any, of the procedure outweigh its risks. Most experts, and medical and patients organizations, including the National Multiple Sclerosis Society of the USA or the Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiological Society of Europe (CIRSE), recommend not using the proposed treatment outside clinical trials until its effectiveness is confirmed by controlled studies. Moreover, the CIRSE has stated that treatment research should begin by a small, placebo-controlled, prospective randomised trial which should be monitored by an independent organization. An exception has been the Society of Interventional Radiology in the USA and Canada. Its members consider published literature on the effectiveness of CCSVI intervention to be inconclusive but supports decisions made by patients, families and physicians to perform angioplasty. In March 2013 a press release indicated that the first prospective, placebo-controlled study of ballon angioplasty for MS had not shown any benefit of the therapy. The study, a phase II clinical trial designed to evaluate safety and efficacy of <b>endovascular</b> treatment, enrolled initially 10 patients that received the treatment and 20 more afterwards that were either allocated to receive angioplasty or a placebo intervention.|$|E
25|$|The Universidad de El Salvador (University of El Salvador) has {{a program}} of 8 years for {{students}} who want to study medicine. The first six years are organized in a two semesters fashion, the seventh year is used for a rotating internship through the mayor specialty areas in a 10-week periods fashion (psychiatry and public health share a period) and the eighth year is designated for Social service in locations approved by the Ministry of Health (usually as attending physician in Community Health Centers or non-profit organizations). The graduates receive the degree of MD and must register in the Public Health Superior Council(CSSP) to get the medical license and a registered national number {{that allows them to}} prescribe barbiturates and other controlled drugs. In order to attend further studies (Surgery, Internal medicine, G/OB, Pediatrics, Psychiatry), the students in the year of Social service or graduates of any Salvadorian university must apply independently for the residency to the hospital of choice; the preliminary selection process is {{based on the results of}} clinical knowledge tests, followed by psychiatric evaluations and interviews with the hospital medical and administrative staff. The basic residencies mentioned above commonly last 3 years; at the last trimester of the third year, the residents can apply to the position of Chief of residents (1 year) or follow further studies as resident (3 years) of a specialty (for example:orthopedic surgery, urology, neurology, endocrinology...). No further studies are offered to the date; therefore, specialist looking for training or practice in a specific area (For example: a neurosurgeon looking for specialty in <b>endovascular</b> neurosurgery, spine surgery or pediatric neurosurgery) must attend studies in other countries and apply for such positions independently.|$|E

500|$|In general, the {{decision}} between clipping and coiling is {{made on the}} basis of the location of the aneurysm, its size and the condition of the person. Aneurysms of the middle cerebral artery and its related vessels are hard to reach with angiography and tend to be amenable to clipping. Those of the basilar artery and posterior cerebral artery are hard to reach surgically and are more accessible for <b>endovascular</b> management. These approaches are based on general experience, and the only randomized controlled trial directly comparing the different modalities was performed in relatively well people with small (less than 10mm) aneurysms of the anterior cerebral artery and anterior communicating artery (together the [...] "anterior circulation"), who constitute about 20 percent of all people with aneurysmal SAH. This trial, the International Subarachnoid Aneurysm Trial (ISAT), showed that in this group the likelihood of death or being dependent on others for activities of daily living was reduced (7.4 percent absolute risk reduction, 23.5 percent relative risk reduction) if <b>endovascular</b> coiling was used as opposed to surgery. The main drawback of coiling is the possibility that the aneurysm will recur; this risk is extremely small in the surgical approach. In ISAT, 8.3 percent needed further treatment in the longer term. Hence, people who have undergone coiling are typically followed up for many years afterwards with angiography or other measures to ensure recurrence of aneurysms is identified early. Other trials have also found a higher rate of recurrence necessitating further treatments.|$|E
500|$|Various {{diagnostic}} modalities {{exist to}} demonstrate blood flow or absence thereof in the vertebral arteries. The gold standard is cerebral angiography (with or without digital subtraction angiography). This involves puncture {{of a large}} artery (usually the femoral artery) and advancing an intravascular catheter through the aorta towards the vertebral arteries. At that point, radiocontrast is injected and its downstream flow captured on fluoroscopy (continuous X-ray imaging). The vessel may appear stenotic (narrowed, 41–75%), occluded (blocked, 18–49%), or as an aneurysm (area of dilation, 5–13%). The narrowing may be described as [...] "rat's tail" [...] or [...] "string sign". Cerebral angiography is an invasive procedure, and it requires large volumes of radiocontrast that can cause complications such as kidney damage. Angiography also does not directly demonstrate the blood in the vessel wall, as opposed to more modern modalities. The only remaining use of angiography is when <b>endovascular</b> treatment is contemplated (see below).|$|E

2500|$|There are {{currently}} two treatment options for brain aneurysms: surgical clipping or <b>endovascular</b> coiling. There is currently {{debate in the}} medical literature about which treatment is most appropriate given particular situations.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{attempts}} {{to treat the}} AAA surgically were unsuccessful until 1923. In that year, Rudolph Matas (who also proposed the concept of endoaneurysmorrhaphy), performed the first successful aortic ligation on a human. Other methods that were successful in treating the AAA included wrapping the aorta with polyethene cellophane, which induced fibrosis and restricted {{the growth of the}} aneurysm. Albert Einstein was operated on by Rudolph Nissen with use of this technique in 1949, and survived five years after the operation, though he eventually died when the aneurysm ruptured. <b>Endovascular</b> aneurysm repair was first performed in the late 1980s and has been widely adopted in the subsequent decades. <b>Endovascular</b> repair was first used for treating a ruptured aneurysm in Nottingham in 1994 ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{treatment}} options for asymptomatic AAA are [...] management, surveillance {{with a view}} to eventual repair, and immediate repair. Two modes of repair are available for an AAA: open aneurysm repair, and <b>endovascular</b> aneurysm repair (EVAR). An intervention is often recommended if the aneurysm grows more than 1cm per year or it is bigger than 5.5cm. Repair is also indicated for symptomatic aneurysms.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Endovascular</b> coiling was {{introduced}} by Guido Guglielmi at UCLA in 1991. It consists of passing a catheter into the femoral artery in the groin, through the aorta, into the brain arteries, and finally into the aneurysm itself. Platinum coils initiate a clotting reaction within the aneurysm that, if successful fill the aneurysm dome and prevent its rupture. [...] Flow diverter can be used but not without complications sometimes.|$|E
2500|$|In early September 2006, Melrose-Wakefield Hospital began {{offering}} elective angioplasty after being {{selected by the}} Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH) {{to participate in an}} elective angioplasty trial. The hospital was one of only seven throughout the state to participate in the [...] "MASS COMM Trial" [...] that studied the benefits of elective (non-emergency) angioplasty without on-site cardiac surgery back-up. The procedure, which is commonly performed in larger teaching hospitals in Boston offers patients the same care without requiring them to travel to a far distance.

2500|$|Experimental {{models can}} now be {{manufactured}} using a novel technique involving the injection-moulding lost-wax manufacturing process to create patient-specific anatomically correct AAA replicas. Work has also focused on developing more realistic material analogues to those in vivo, and recently a novel range of silicone-rubbers was created allowing the varying material properties of the AAA to be more accurately represented. These rubber models {{can also be used}} in a variety of experimental testing from stress analysis using the photoelastic method to deterimining whether the locations of rupture experimentally correlate with those predicted numerically.
