40|$|Salmonella spp. {{is a major}} food-borne {{pathogen}} {{around the}} world. The ability of Salmonella to produce biofilm {{is one of the}} main obstacles in reducing the prevalence of these bacteria in the food chain. Most of Salmonella biofilm studies found in the literature used laboratory growth media. However, in the <b>food</b> chain, <b>food</b> <b>residues</b> are the principal source of nutrients of Salmonella. In this study, the biofilm formation, morphotype, and motility of 13 Salmonella strains belonging to three different subspecies and isolated from poultry houses was evaluated. To simulate food chain conditions, four different growth media (Tryptic Soy Broth at 1 / 20 dilution, milk at 1 / 20 dilution, tomato juice, and chicken meat juice), two different surfaces (stainless steel and polystyrene) and two temperatures (6 °C and 22 °C) were used to evaluate the biofilm formation. The morphotype, motility, and biofilm formation of Salmonella was temperature-dependent. Biofilm formation was significantly higher with 1 / 20 Tryptic Soy Broth in all the surfaces and temperatures tested, in comparison with the other growth media. The laboratory growth medium 1 / 20 Tryptic Soy Broth enhanced biofilm formation in Salmonella. This could explain the great differences in biofilm formation found between this growth medium and <b>food</b> <b>residues.</b> However, Salmonella strains were able to produce biofilm on the presence of <b>food</b> <b>residues</b> in all the conditions tested. Therefore, the Salmonella strain can use <b>food</b> <b>residues</b> to produce biofilm on common surfaces of the food chain.

A 6. 2 log MPN/ml of MNV- 1 infectivity was completely lost at day 30 in residue-free coupons, whereas only a 1. 4 log MPN/ml reduction was observed in coupons with residues.

40|$|This {{research}} {{explores the}} extent to which <b>food</b> <b>residues</b> from ceramics can contribute to archaeological understanding of the fourth millennium BC. Known archaeologically as the Early and Middle Neolithic, this prehistoric period is disputed among archaeologists and food-related evidence is especially contested. This research explores food-related evidence from new angles in that traditional approaches to diet are abandoned in favour of smaller-scale study of cookery practices. <b>Food</b> <b>residues</b> from Early and Middle Neolithic ceramic vessels were analysed by GC/MS and GC/C/IRMS. The techniques target the lipid (fats, oils, and waxes) component of foods that were cooked in the ceramic vessels in prehistory. The scientific datasets thus obtained were integrated with contextual information from the ceramic assemblages and the sites at which they were recovered. The sampled ceramic assemblages were recovered from archaeological sites made up primarily of pit features, which contain important evidence of life beyond the conspicuous monuments of the Neolithic. Several pit sites have come to light in the Upper and Middle Thames Valley during developer-funded excavation {{in the last couple of}} decades, and a new picture of everyday lives in the fourth millennium BC is emerging. This research contributes to this emerging picture in that it reveals local variation and regional consistency in foodways and pottery use. It demonstrates that pottery and food were closely connected during this period and that potters actively responded to the requirements of food preparation. This interplay between pottery and food has implications for more traditional typological studies of the ceramic record. It is argued that <b>food</b> <b>residues</b> from ceramics can be a source of information for material culture studies as well as for dietary reconstruction...|$|R

Methods: A cohort of 708 patients who under-went distal gastrectomy for gastric cancer was re-viewed prospectively.
