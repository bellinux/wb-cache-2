Genuine ‘dragon’s blood’ resin (Dracaena spp.) as found on Socotra Island was the probable source in antiquity.

The genetic diversity in five populations of Daemonorops draco(Willd.) Blume (Jernang: in Bahasa Indonesia) was analyzed using Inter Simple Sequence Repeat (ISSR) markers. The screening results from using 15 ISSR primers showed that only 5 of ISSR primers had clear and reproducible bands. Based {{on the data}} from the matrix binary analyzed using POPGENE version 3. 2, the highest genetic diversity was found in the Sepintun population at 0. 0969 average heterozygosis (H) and 0. 146 average Shannon Index (I). The heterozygosis calculation of the total population (HT) was 0. 2571. The heterozygosis value within a population (HS= 0. 0704) was smaller than that between populations (DST= 0. 1867). Using the clustering analysis program Past version 32 on 43 individuals of D. draco, we found that there were three groups of D. draco. Group A consisted of 8 individuals in the Bengayoan population, group B consisted of 9 units in the Nunusan population and group C consisted of three populations; Tebo, Sepintun and Mandiangin consisted of 10, 8 and 8 individuals. The genetic similarity varied among all populations withthe values between 0. 07 - 0. 93. Key words: <b>Daemonorops</b> <b>draco,</b> genetic diversity, ISSR marker...|$|R

Management of Rattan Jernang (<b>Daemonorops</b> <b>draco</b> Willd.) in Jebak Forest, Batanghari, Jambi {{is not well}} documented. It is noted that fruits of D. draco is the best income source for Anak Dalam Jambi people since 1624. They harvest fruits of D. draco as many as they need. The management of Jebak forest is an open access, so {{all the people of}} Anak Dalam Jambi Tribe have the same right and responsibility on the forest. However, almost 60 % of Jebak Forest area have been severed because of illegal logging for palm oil plantation. This is the reason why people of Suku Anak Dalam such as Sudirman and Suin, try to cultivate D. draco by growing 40 clumps of this species at their latex field. The aim of their activity is to conserve D. draco at their forest. Based on the recent situation, research study of rattan jernang’s management in Jebak Forest is conducted. This research method is semi structural interview. All data are analyzed by description. As a result is the management and cultivation of D. draco in Jebak Forest is very difficult because the availability of seeds are not enough for root stocks...|$|R

40|$|Research of Rattan Jernang (<b>Daemonorops</b> <b>draco</b> Willd.) {{population}} in Jebak Village, Batanghari District, Jambi {{had never been}} done before. <b>Daemonorops</b> <b>draco</b> is a plant that produces sap called dragon blood. Dragon blood is very useful for the {{the lives of people}} of Anak Dalam Tribe in Jambi. This research used purposive random sampling method. All of data wer analyzed descriptively. The results showed that beside D. draco, there were other six species of rattan in Jebak forest. The population of D. draco in Jebak forest was only 8 clumps, consisting of 82 individuals. D. draco had the smallest population among all rattan species. Calamus javensis had the highest population, namely 11 clumps, consisting of 197 individuals. The research location had air temperature of 20. 20 C- 28. 90 C, realtive humidity of 58 %- 68 %, and pH of 4. 60 - 4. 81. In this location, there were 35 tree species (73 individuals) as supporting trees for D. draco to climb. The number of D. draco’s supporting trees and D. draco was not balanced, causing the death of D. draco in Jebak forest. Vegetation analyses showed that there were 51 tree species with diameter > 10 cm, consisting of 69 individuals. Pithecolobium saman had the highest importance value index (11) among all trees. There were also 33 tree species with diameter < 10 cm, consisting of 60 individuals. Pithecolobium saman also had the highest importance value index (20) in this group. Based on the interview, it is showed that the population of D. draco in Jebak forest declined because of illegal logging and forest encroachment...|$|R
40|$|Jernang (<b>Daemonorops</b> <b>draco</b> (Willd.) Blume) is a {{dioecious}} rattan {{species that}} produces resin on female individuals. The sex of jernang {{can only be}} identified from its inflorescences morphology. Sex survey was conducted in 5 populations of jernang, 3 populations of which in the Bukit Tigapuluh National Park (BTNP), 1 population in the secondary forest in Jambi province and 1 population {{in the area of}} rubber plantation in Jambi province. Chi-Squared test on the sex ratio of jernang showed that the ratio of the male to female in their natural habitat (Bengayoan and Tebo, 2 parts of the BTNP ecosystem and the Sepintun secondary forest) was distorted from the normal ratio of 1 : 1, while the cultivated jernang in Nunusan population (BTNPT) and Mandiangin were not significantly different from the normal sex ratio of 1 : 1. Female individuals from the cultivated population in the Mandiangin (planted in 1997) has an average number of stems per clump more on individual males (27. 12) than females (26. 92). The result of this study indicated that the D. draco has a good reproductive strategy and thus suitable for cultivation...|$|R
40|$|Dragon's {{blood is}} a deep red resin which {{has been used for}} centuries by many {{cultures}} and much prized for it's rarity, depth of colour and alchemical associations. The original source of dragon's blood resin is believed to be Dracaena cinnabari from Socotra in Africa, but since mediaeval times there have been several alternatives from different geographical locations from the Canary Islands to the East Indies. Here, the Raman spectra of dragon's blood resins from Dracaena draco Liliacae trees growing in several different locations bordering the Mediterranean and Middle East are compared with the resins from alternative botanical sources such as <b>Daemonorops</b> <b>draco,</b> Dracaena cinnabari and Eucalyptus terminalis, which all generically come under the description of dragon's blood. Key vibrational spectroscopic marker bands are identified in the Raman spectra of the resins, which are suggested for adoption as a protocol for the identification of the botanical and possible geographical sources of modern dragon's blood resins. The Raman spectra of materials, which are falsely attributed to dragon's blood resin are also shown for comparison and identification purposes. Changes in the Raman spectra of genuine dragon's blood resin specimens arising from simple processing treatment during the preparation of the resins for sale are also identified, which suggests a possible attribution characteristic for unknown samples...|$|R
40|$|Hyperglycaemia, a {{characteristic}} feature of diabetes mellitus, induces endothelial dysfunction and vascular complications {{by limiting the}} proliferative potential of these cells. Here we aimed to investigate the effect of an ethanolic extract of Sanguis draconis (SD), a kind of dragon’s blood resin that is obtained from <b>Daemonorops</b> <b>draco</b> (Palmae), on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) under high-glucose (HG) stimulation and its underlying mechanism. Concentration-dependent (0 – 50 [*]μg/mL) assessment of cell viability showed that SD does not affect cell viability with a similar trend up to 48 [*]h. Remarkably, SD (10 – 50 [*]μg/mL) significantly attenuated the high-glucose (25 and 50 [*]mM) induced cell toxicity in a concentration-dependent manner. SD inhibited high glucose-induced nitrite (NO) and lipid peroxidation (MDA) production and reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation in HUVEC. Western blot analysis revealed that SD treatments abolished HG-induced phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 / 2 (ERK 1 / 2), nuclear transcription factor, κB (NF-κB), VCAM- 1, and E-selectin, and it also blocked the breakdown of PARP- 116 kDa protein in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, we found that SD increased the expression of Bcl- 2 and decreased Bax protein expression in HG-stimulated HUVEC. Thus, these {{results of this study}} demonstrate {{for the first time that}} SD inhibits glucose induced oxidative stress and vascular inflammation in HUVEC by inhibiting the ERK/NF-κB/PARP- 1 /Bax signaling cascade followed by suppressing the activation of VCAM- 1 and E-selectin. These data suggest that SD may have a therapeutic potential in vascular inflammation due to the decreased levels of oxidative stress, apoptosis, and PARP- 1 activation...|$|R
