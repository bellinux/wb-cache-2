40|$|The first {{synoptic}} global-scale {{images of}} total column ozone are {{obtained in the}} sunlit hemisphere using the imaging instrumentation on board the spacecraft Dynamics Explorer 1 (DE- 1). The total column ozone is determined using the backscatter ultraviolet technique. The high apogee altitude of the eccentric, polar orbit allows global-scale images of the terrestrial ozone field to be obtained in 12 minutes with good spatial resolution. Previous ozone-monitoring spacecraft have required much longer time periods for comparable spatial coverage because of their lower altitudes. The much higher altitude of DE- 1 also provides hours of continuous imaging of features, as compared to minutes or seconds with previous spacecraft. Substantial short-term (less than 1 day) variations in the synoptic ozone field have been detected. This paper provides {{a brief description of}} this unique observation platform and shows the validity of the measured fields using comparisons with the <b>Dobson</b> <b>network</b> and with various meteorological measurements...|$|E
40|$|International audienceOver {{the last}} 3 decades, {{satellite}} data {{have been used}} to monitor long-term global changes in stratospheric ozone. The TOMS series (1978 [...] present) and GOME (1995 [...] present) are two very important instruments in this context. In this paper, TOMS total ozone and three approaches to derive total ozone from GOME measurements are validated with ground-based <b>Dobson</b> <b>network</b> data. Beyond the operational products of both instruments, e. g. TOMS Version 7 and GOME Data Processor Version 2. 7, total ozone is calculated by integrating FURM ozone profiles and by applying the TOMS algorithm to the GOME spectra. All algorithms show in general good agreement with ground-based measurements. The operational GOME total ozone shows seasonal variations, most likely introduced by difficulties in the derivation of airmass factors, which convert measured slant columns into vertical columns. The TOMS algorithm estimates on average 2 % higher total ozone in the southern hemisphere than in the northern for both instruments as compared to the ground-based data, indicating that the source of the observed hemispheric differences is in the TOMS algorithm. Both instruments show aging effects in 2000, leading to enhanced variability in the ozone column differences with respect to Dobson data. In addition, the integrated GOME ozone profiles and the TOMS algorithm applied to GOME data show larger mean deviations in 2000...|$|E
40|$|Comparison of Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) data to {{the network}} of {{ground-based}} Dobson/Brewer measurements reveals difference in the time dependence of the calibration of the two systems. We have been searching for a method to determine the time dependence of the TOMS calibrations that is independent of the Dobson/Brewer network. In a separate paper by DeLand et al., calibrations of the Solar Backscatter UV Spectrometer (SBUV) instruments have been rederived using the D-pair (306 / 313 nm wavelengths) data at the equator. These calibrations have been applied to {{the data from the}} Nimbus 7 SBUV and the NOAA 9 and 11 SBUV/ 2 data to derive a new version 7 data set for each instrument. We have used these data to do a detailed comparison to the Nimbus 7 and Earth Probe TOMS data. Assuming that the D-pair establishes the correct calibration, these comparisons reveal some small calibration drifts (approximately 1 %) in the TOMS data. They also reveal an offset in the D-pair calibration with respect to the <b>Dobson</b> <b>network</b> of approximately 8 Dobson units with the Dobson being lower than the D-pair. The D-pair calibration offsets have been used to create a merged ozone data set from TOMS with a calibration that has been determined independent of the Dobson/Brewer network. Trend analyses of these data will be presented and compared to trend analyses using the ground-based data...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAn assimilated {{data base}} of total column ozone {{measurements}} from satellites {{has been used}} to generate a set of indicators describing attributes of the Antarctic ozone hole for the period 1979 to 2003, including (i) daily measures of the area over Antarctica where ozone levels are below 150 DU, below 220 DU, more than 30 % below 1979 to 1981 norms, and more than 50 % below 1979 to 1981 norms, (ii) the date of disappearance of 150 DU ozone values, 220 DU ozone values, values 30 % below 1979 to 1981 norms, and values 50 % below 1979 to 1981 norms, for each year, (iii) daily minimum total column ozone values over Antarctica, and (iv) daily values of the ozone mass deficit based on a O 3 < 220 DU threshold. The assimilated data base combines satellite-based ozone measurements from 4 Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) instruments, 3 different retrievals from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME), and data from 4 Solar Backscatter Ultra-Violet (SBUV) instruments. Comparisons with the global ground-based <b>Dobson</b> spectrophotometer <b>network</b> are used to remove offsets and drifts between the different data sets to produce a global homogeneous data set that combines the advantages of good spatial coverage of satellite data with good long-term stability of ground-based measurements. One potential use of the derived indices is detection of the expected recovery of the Antarctic ozone hole. The suitability of the derived indicators to this task is discussed {{in the context of their}} variability and their susceptibility to saturation effects which makes them less responsive to decreasing stratospheric halogen loading. It is also shown that if the corrections required to match recent Earth Probe TOMS measurements to Dobson measurements are not applied, some of the indictors are affected so as to obscure detection of the recovery of the Antarctic ozone hole...|$|R
40|$|Global {{total ozone}} has been mapped with the Nimbus 7 Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) {{instrument}} since November 1978. Very detailed daily maps are produced with this instrument {{which has a}} spatial resolution at nadir of 50 km. The data accuracy is better than 2 % under all weather conditions as evaluated by comparison with <b>Dobson</b> spectrophotometer <b>network</b> stations. Coverage is complete at all sunlit latitudes including the poles during non-polar night months. The general structure of southern hemisphere total ozone is a polar minimum surrounded by a circumpolar maximum. Over {{much of the year}} the gradients are quite small except for local midlatitude storms. However, during the spring months the difference between the minimum and the maximum grows with time. The boundary of the polar minimum is generally very sharp with a gradient of 10 Dobson units/ 100 km not uncommon, thus justifying the term "ozone hole" to describe this feature. A station in the boundary region will undergo very large changes in ozone as the position of the hole drifts and fluctuates. Finally, the ozone hole is destroyed as the polar vortex breaks down in November. These characteristics were illustrated during the Symposium in a motion picture of daily ozone maps for a complete year. A second motion picture shows the striking decrease of Antarctic ozone during each of the October months since 1979 to values near 140 Dobson units, far below the lowest (180 Dobson units) ever observed previously at any location. It is this decrease which is the subject of the current controversy over possible fluorocarbon effects on ozone. The data from TOMS show that dynamics are critical {{in the formation of the}} ozone hole. Total ozone in the Antarctic region is found to be highly correlated with air temperature in the lower stratosphere...|$|R

We compare IASI total ozone columns to Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment- 2 (GOME- 2) observations and ground-based measurements from the <b>Dobson</b> and Brewer <b>network</b> for one full year of observations (2008). The IASI total ozone columns are shown {{to be in good}} agreement with both GOME- 2 and ground-based data, with correlation coefficients of about 0. 9 and 0. 85, respectively. On average, IASI ozone retrievals exhibit a positive bias of about 9 DU (3. 3 %) compared to both GOME- 2 and ground-based measurements. In addition to total ozone columns, the good spectral resolution of IASI enables the retrieval of tropospheric ozone concentrations. Comparisons of IASI tropospheric columns to 490 collocated ozone soundings available from several stations around the globe have been performed for the period of June 2007 –August 2008. IASI tropospheric ozone columns compare well with sonde observations, with correlation coefficients of 0. 95 and 0. 77 for the [surface– 6 km] and [surface– 12 km] partial columns, respectively. IASI retrievals tend to overestimate the tropospheric ozone columns in comparison with ozonesonde measurements.

40|$|The {{currently}} archived (1989) {{total ozone}} mapping spectrometer (TOMS) and {{solar backscattered ultraviolet}} (SBUV) total ozone data (version 5) show a global average decrease of about 9. 0 percent from November 1978 to November 1988. This large decrease disagrees with an approximate 3. 5 -percent decrease estimated from the ground-based <b>Dobson</b> <b>network.</b> The primary source of disagreement was found to arise from an overestimate of reflectivity change and its incorrect wavelengths dependence for the diffuse plate used when measuring solar irradiance. Both of these factors have led to an overestimate of the rate of atmospheric ozone depletion by SBUV and TOMS. For total ozone measured by TOMS, a means has been found to use the measured radiance-irradiance ratio from several wavelengths pairs to construct an internally self-consistent calibration. The method uses the wavelength dependence of the sensitivity to calibration errors and the requirement that albedo ratios for each wavelength pair yield the same total ozone amounts. Smaller errors in determining spacecraft attitude, synchronization problems with the photon counting electronics, and sea-glint contamination of boundary reflectivity data have been corrected or minimized. New climatological low-ozone profiles have been incorporated into the TOMS algorithm that are appropriate for Antarctic ozone hole conditions and other low ozone cases. The combined corrections have led to a new determination of the global average total ozone trend (version 6) as a 2. 9 + or - 1. 3 percent decrease over 11 years (October 1978 to November 1989) ...|$|E
40|$|Comparisons {{of total}} column ozone {{measurements}} from Dobson, Brewer and SAOZ instruments are presented {{for the period}} 1990 to 1995 at seven stations covering the mid- and the high northern latitudes, {{as well as the}} Antarctic region. The main purpose of these comparisons is to assess, by reference to the well established <b>Dobson</b> <b>network,</b> the accuracy of the zenith-sky visible spectroscopy for the measurement of total ozone. The strengths and present limitations of this latter technique are investigated. As a general result, the different instruments are found to agree within a few percent at all stations, the best agreement being obtained at mid-latitudes. On average, for the mid-latitudes, SAOZ O 3 measurements are approximately 2 % higher than Dobson ones, with a scatter of about 5 %. At higher latitudes, both scatter and systematic deviation tend to increase. In all cases, the relative differences between SAOZ and Dobson or Brewer column ozone are characterised by a significant seasonal signal, the amplitude of which increases from about 2. 5 % at mid-latitude to a maximum of 7. 5 % at Faraday, Antarctica. Although it introduces a significant contribution to the seasonality at high latitude, the temperature sensitivity of the O 3 absorption coefficients of the Dobson and Brewer instruments is shown to be too small to account for the observed SAOZ/Dobson differences. Except for Faraday, these differences can however be largely reduced if SAOZ AMFs are calculated with realistic climatological profiles of ozone, pressure and temperature. Other sources of uncertainties that might affect the comparison are investigated. Evidence is found that the differences in the air masses sampled by the SAOZ and the other instruments contribute significantly to the scatter, and the impact of the tropospheric clouds on SAOZ measurements is displaye...|$|E
