In this paper, the concept of mentalization is explained and relevant theory and research concerning mentalization, reflective functioning, neuropsychology, and attachment is addressed. The purpose of this paper was to identify and describe mentalization-based <b>intervention</b> <b>programs</b> for families and to clarify the research foundation for these programs. Two electronic searches were carried out. The first search identified 5 different mentalization-based <b>intervention</b> <b>programs</b> for families. The second search identified existing research related to these <b>intervention</b> <b>programs.</b> This paper also includes a discussion of whether mentalization-based <b>intervention</b> <b>programs</b> for families represent an important contribution to family-based treatment. It is concluded that mentalization-based <b>intervention</b> <b>programs</b> for families incorporate important theory regarding the caregiver - child relationship, but that the empirical foundation for the mentalization-based treatment of families is limited and that this is obviously still a young field. Despite the fact that several studies showed promising results, mentalization-based programs for families still need a wider research base in order to be classified as evidence-based treatment interventions...|$|R
25|$|The 1921 Convention set new {{goals for}} {{international}} efforts to stem human trafficking, primarily by giving the anti-trafficking movement further official recognition, {{as well as a}} bureaucratic apparatus to research and fight the problem. The Advisory Committee on the Traffic of Women and Children was a permanent advisory committee of the League. Its members were nine countries, and several non-governmental organizations. An important development was the implementation of a system of annual reports of member countries. Member countries formed their own centralized offices to track and report on trafficking of women and children. The advisory committee also worked to expand its research and <b>intervention</b> <b>program</b> beyond the United States and Europe. In 1929, a need to expand into the Near East (Asia Minor), the Middle East and Asia was acknowledged. An international conference of central authorities in Asia was planned for 1937, but no further action was taken during the late 1930s.|$|E
25|$|Therapy for Expressive Aphasia (nonfluent) is beneficial, {{even for}} {{patients}} with severe nonfluent aphasia. A study conducted by Marangolo and co-workers (2013) administered conversational therapy to patients with severe nonfluent aphasia. The {{results of the study}} demonstrated {{a significant increase in the}} patient’s expressive language. The authors suggested that an intensive conversational therapy program should be considered {{for patients with}} moderately severe nonfluent aphasia in order to enhance the patient's quality of life and improve their language expression. In addition, although Anomic Aphasia is seen to be less severe than other aphasias, therapy is still imperative to help decrease the patient’s word finding deficits. A research study conducted by Harnish and co-workers (2014), provided intense treatment to patients with anomic aphasia. Results of the study concluded significant increases in the participant’s expressive language. These results suggest that an intensive <b>intervention</b> <b>program</b> for patients with anomic aphasia provides a surprisingly quick expressive language increase. Specifically, these patients relearned to correctly produce the problematic words after one to three hours of speech-language therapy.|$|E

Early <b>intervention</b> <b>programs</b> like Head Start and preschool help parents who lack the finances to prepare their children for elementary school (U. S.
