500|$|One of {{the most}} {{critical}} reviews was by Francesca Dinglasan of Boxoffice Magazine. Dinglasan, who gave Drum 2.5 out of 5 stars, was unimpressed by the [...] "unoriginal plotting techniques to convey the story of an investigative journalist attempting to expose racial injustices in a society coming to grips with the newly introduced edicts of apartheid." [...] Although Diggs's acting was [...] "engaging", according to her the film [...] "depends on just a <b>few</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> big-screen cliches and predictable plot turns." [...] The [...] "richly designed sets and costumes" [...] were not able to overcome the less-than-satisfactory" [...] Drum.|$|E
500|$|Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their}} book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three-a-half stars out of five, and wrote that, while the episode [...] "stumbles around a lot", it gives the viewer [...] "the {{impression}} there's nothing else on TV quite like it". The two felt that the idea that Mulder and Scully were friends throughout their various lives was [...] "one {{of the best things}} about the story". They also wrote that the fact that Melissa and Mulder were somehow soul mates also prevented the story from being [...] "obvious and pat". However, Shearman and Pearson felt that Morgan and Wong added [...] "a <b>few</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> ingredients" [...] which yielded an uneven episode. Entertainment Weekly, on the other hand, was negative, giving the episode an [...] "F" [...] and describing it as [...] "stultifyingly awful".|$|E
500|$|Abeel praised how, by [...] "voiding the docu-style {{string of}} anecdotes of many fact-based films, {{it offers the}} {{shapeliness}} and irony of classic drama". Hammond commended Madsen as the film [...] "achieves a sense of psychological complexity– and a pervasive atmosphere of fear and confusion– without sacrificing the rhythm and dramatic tension necessary to a war film". Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly praised its combination of [...] "sharp scenes of moral inquiry with a <b>few</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> functional, oldfangled espionage twists". Fuchs applauded the interpolation of emotional relations as they [...] "help to make Flame & Citrons taut action even more effective. Beautifully choreographed and filmed in deep shadows that cut the violence into shadowy, brutal fragments, Flame and Citron's jobs are at once thrilling and disconcerting". Kate Taylor from The Globe and Mail, however, said the romantic relationship, [...] "predictable in a James Bond kind of way, is the weakest link in the script".|$|E

500|$|Both {{the concert}} and the U2 Live at Red Rocks video {{received}} positive reviews from critics. In {{a review of}} the show, G. Brown of The Denver Post wrote, [...] "A lot of things had to go so wrong for U2's show at Red Rocks Amphitheater...to come off so right." [...] Jon Pareles of The New York Times praised the film, saying, [...] "The setting lent even more urgency to U2's hypercharged songs about apocalypse, pacifism and existential terror". Pareles said, [...] "Although there are a <b>few</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> exaggerated camera angles, the tape captures U2's earnest intensity." [...] A review in the Philadelphia Daily News described the camerawork as [...] "artful" [...] and praised the visuals of the concert and the natural surroundings. Perry Seibert of Allmovie gave the film four-and-a-half stars, praising the band's performance and the venue's role in the concert, saying, [...] "the historic Red Rocks venue provides a stirring backdrop for the band's sweeping sound".|$|E
500|$|After {{its release}} on DVD in 2012, the season {{received}} positive critical attention, although many reviewers initially expressed their unhappiness that the set was not initially released as a Blu-ray edition. Wired wrote positively of the set, and applauded the release's bonus features. R.L. Shaffer of IGN awarded the set a 7 out of 10, denoting a [...] "good" [...] release. He called the show a [...] "rare treat", but {{was critical of}} the release's packaging, noting that [...] "a <b>few</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> episodes are crammed onto the discs, leaving little room for these transfers to breathe" [...] and that the video compression left something to be desired. Tyler Foster of DVD Talk [...] "highly recommended" [...] the set, and wrote that the series is [...] "bursting with imagination, sweetness, and a ridiculous sense of humor". Foster was particularly pleased with the characters, citing Ricardio and Marceline as highlights of the season. Furthermore, he wrote that [...] "even the worst episode in this —and I'm hard-pressed to pick one—is beautifully designed and packs at least one or two killer gags." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to the film's detractors, The New York Times's Nathan Lee said Friday the 13th managed to [...] "reboot the concept" [...] of the original films with style. Lee said the film takes pleasure in killing off each of its characters, {{that there is a}} desire among cinemagoers for this type of material, and that Friday the 13th satisfies that desire. Adam Graham from The Detroit News said the film is the most effective and scary film in the Friday the 13th series; he praised its choice of allowing Jason to run after his victimsas opposed to slowly walking behind them, as became prominent in later sequelsbecause it made him more menacing. Graham also said the film does not [...] "soften" [...] Jason's scariness by providing a sympathetic backstory. Entertainment Weeklys Clark Collis said director Nispel made a competent film that performs better as a whole than the previously released remakes of Prom Night (2008) and My Bloody Valentine 3D (2009), although it does provide a <b>few</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> unbelievable character moments.|$|E

500|$|A melancholy love song, its lyrics {{depict a}} woman torn between love and ambition. [...] "West Coast" [...] {{also serves as}} a {{dedication}} to Del Rey's California hometown, and elicits imagery from its titular location. In the song, she sings about leaving a lover for the Californian promise of fame, and emphasizes on a gulf between a sweetly uncomplicated romance and a boozily dysfunctional relationship. Similarly to her previous works, the lyrics are both specific and vague, and complement the track's [...] "dreamlike" [...] sonics. [...] "West Coast" [...] sets up a disunity between form and content, and though a love song, its sound is more reminiscent to that of a breakup song. It was also noted that the lyrics depict a vivid picture of teenage summer memories and forgotten romance. Comparing the track's lyrical content to that of Sonic Youth's [...] "Superstar" [...] (1994), Grantland's Molly Lambert analyzed: [...] "While Born to Die–era Lana often displayed a preening 'please notice me, Mr. Producer!' energy, the Lana of 'West Coast' sounds like a starlet struggling not to become disaffected with show business after feeling her way through a <b>few</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> casting-couch sessions, still hoping that big break might be on the horizon." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviewing [...] "The Long Game" [...] for The A.V. Club in 2013, Alasdair Wilkins {{gave it a}} {{grade of}} [...] "B-". He found it [...] "inessential" [...] and commented {{that it was not}} very clear on the motives of the Editor and Jagrafess, but Pegg's {{performance}} was almost enough to make up for it. Overall he felt that the story [...] "presents a <b>few</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> simple ideas, with the cumulative effect that this is a story that feels slight at best, underdeveloped at worst. The episode is hardly a failure, {{but it could have been}} so much more." [...] In Who Is the Doctor, a guide to the revived series, Graeme Burk described the episode as [...] "entertaining, if unspectacular." [...] He called Pegg the best guest star so far, and stated that Langley did a [...] "superb job" [...] at conveying Adam, but he felt that the episode did not have much else beside the failed companion storyline. Burk criticised the satire for not being subtle enough and borrowing from other stories such as Nineteen Eighty-Four. He also remarked that it was a shame Adam's motives were cut, as well as development between Rose and Adam. Burk's coauthor Robert [...] was more positive, opining that a satire did not have to be subtle to be effective, and that viewers could still relate it to the news media today. He also praised the way [...] "The Long Game" [...] showed the Ninth Doctor as an [...] "inspirational figure." [...] The two also questioned the decision to leave Adam in the 21st century with future technology.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} market {{provision}} {{of a specific}} type of public good: radio and television broadcasts. Its main focus is to explore the ability of the market to provide broadcasting efficiently {{in a world in which}} broadcasters earn revenues by selling time to advertisers and advertisements provide information to consumers about new products. The paper shows that market provided broadcasts may feature <b>too</b> <b>few</b> or <b>too</b> <b>many</b> commercials, depending on the relative sizes of their social benefit and their nuisance cost to viewers. In addition, the market may provide <b>too</b> <b>few</b> or <b>too</b> <b>many</b> types of programs, depending on the relative size of viewing benefits and the benefits to advertisers from contacting viewers. The possibility of both under and over-provision of advertisements and programming, means that there are ranges of the parameters for which the market provides broadcasting close to efficiently. The paper also considers whether the market performs better under monopoly or competition and studies how the ability to charge viewers subscription prices impacts market performance. ...|$|R

2500|$|David Chapman, {{reviewing}} {{the book for}} the Newsquest Media Group Newspapers, concluded, [...] "This is a decidedly funny memoir that includes the scrapes and japes of nob culture." [...] Lorne Jackson of the Sunday Mercury was totally dismissive {{of what he called}} [...] "a dull memoir", stating: [...] "This could have all been explained in one page, possibly two if the type was particularly large." [...] The Sunday Times commented that, [...] "Annabel comes across as a decent woman ... but her writing is flat, with a <b>few</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> clumsy constructions, and her story lacks drama, even when terrible things happen to her." [...] Biographer Selena Hastings called it [...] "a well-ordered, decently written book," [...] while the Evening Standard wrote, [...] "Goldsmith herself comes across as fun and warm, a good sport, if sometimes strangely submissive and a little overfond of her own breasts." [...] Annabel became a No.1 London best-seller for non-fiction. Nationally, the memoirs reached the top ten non-fiction best-sellers in England, fluctuating from No. 7 to No. 4 and then No. 6.|$|E

2500|$|In 1927, {{along with}} other {{prominent}} Pathé and Perfect vocal artists (Willard Robison, Annette Hanshaw, Cliff Edwards), Morse moved to the Columbia label. From 1927 to 1932, {{she was one of}} the label's most popular female performers, second only to Ruth Etting. Morse continued to do vaudeville and other stage work during this time, landing a role in Ziegfeld's Simple Simon that may have made her an even bigger star. Unfortunately, Morse's drinking problem left her unable to perform on the show's February 18, 1930 debut. According to Lorenz Hart biographer Gary Marmorstein: [...] ", Wynn, the bicycle-piano and Lee Morse made their entrance and were greeted with applause. Everything would have been fine except that Miss Morse had had a <b>few</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> and couldn't remember the words or the music." [...] Minus their star, the producers asked Ruth Etting to step up in the eleventh hour to fill Morse's shoes. As a result, the show's memorable [...] "Ten Cents a Dance" [...] became Etting's signature while Morse's once promising Broadway career abruptly ended.|$|E
2500|$|GameSpy's Thierry Nguyen {{scored the}} PC version 2.5 out of 5, calling it [...] "well-meaning but {{ultimately}} flawed." [...] He too disliked Billy's levels, especially the platforming sections. He concluded [...] "Call of Juarez {{is a game}} we wanted to like, as it has most of the requisite elements that we {{look for in a}} Western. It's just that the really sloppy platforming and box-moving, which take up a good chunk of the game, puts a big damper on any joy that we might find in shooting up bandits and cowboys." [...] Sterling McGarvey also scored the Xbox 360 version 2.5 out of 5, calling it [...] "yet another Tex-Mex shooter that seems to have been made by a bunch of guys who've watched a <b>few</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> Westerns but haven't figured out how to get the ambience and authenticity of the historical period down." [...] He praised the shooting mechanics, but concluded [...] "For the most part, Call of Juarez has taken two core ideas and melded them into a game. [...] There will be inevitable comparisons to Neversoft's GUN, but CoJ feels much more a next-gen version of the lackluster Dead Man's Hand than anything else." ...|$|E
