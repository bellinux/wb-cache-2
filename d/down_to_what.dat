500|$|Khan {{returns in}} the 1982 feature film [...] Captain Clark Terrell (Paul Winfield) and First Officer Pavel Chekov (Walter Koenig) of USS Reliant {{are searching for}} an {{uninhabited}} world to test the Genesis device, a powerful terraforming tool. They beam <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> they believe is Ceti Alpha VI. Khan's followers capture Terrell and Chekov, and Khan explains that the barren world is Ceti Alpha V; the sixth planet of the system exploded shortly after Khan and his followers were marooned. The cataclysm caused massive climate disturbances, rendering the planet into a desert, {{and many of the}} survivors—including Khan's wife—were killed by the only surviving species of animal, the Ceti eel. Only twenty of Khan's followers survive. Swearing vengeance on Kirk, Khan implants Ceti eels in Terrell and Chekov's brains, rendering them vulnerable to suggestion. Khan then seizes control of Reliant, intent on capturing the Genesis device.|$|E
500|$|Motolla {{selected}} Cory Rooney as {{the executive}} producer of Irresistible. Most of the recording and mixing works were done at Sony Music Studios, New York City and was completed over a time span of eight months. Rooney also coordinated the recording process while Robert Williams miked the vocals. Sony's C-800G Tube Condenser Microphone, equipped with a dual large diaphragm and electronically selectable pick-up pattern, was used to record the vocals. In an interview with Sony's SoundByte magazine in 2002, Williams said of his choice: [...] "In the studio, it comes <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> you hear. [...] She has such a big range, from a whisper to really belting it out, and you need a microphone that can handle the range without distortion." [...] He had used the microphone for Simpson's first album and felt that it suited her well. He also noted that on ballads, [...] "the S's and wet sounds of lips" [...] are important to the texture of the song. According to him, as Simpson's vocals tended to be [...] "bright", he edited the lower ends of her voice to equalize the track.|$|E
500|$|Crosby {{returned}} to the ice May 5 for the Penguins' second game against their first-round playoff opponents, the New York Islanders—ironically the very team Pittsburgh had been playing when Crosby was injured. Despite two Crosby goals, Pittsburgh lost the game 3–2, tying the series at one game a piece. The Penguins would ultimately prevail 4–2 in the series over the Isles with Crosby scoring 9 points (3 goals, 6 assists) in the five games in which he played. Crosby and the Penguins moved on to face the Ottawa Senators {{in the second round}} with [...] "Sid the Kid" [...] registering a hat-trick in Game 2 of the series. Pittsburgh quickly defeated Ottawa 4 games to 1 in the series with a still-hot Crosby finishing the series with four goals and two assists. The Eastern Conference Finals came <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> many felt were the two best teams in the conference: Pittsburgh and Boston. Boston Bruins goaltender Tuukka Rask put on an outstanding performance, shutting down Pittsburgh's potent offence {{with the help of a}} stifling defensive effort from his teammates. The Penguins were held to just two goals in the series, with Rask stopping 134 of 136 shots on goal (.985%). Crosby, who had been strong for the Penguins in the regular season and through the first two rounds of the playoffs was held off the score sheet entirely, finishing the series with 0 goals and 0 assists on 13 shots. The Bruins swept the Penguins in four straight games, ending Crosby's bid for a second Stanley Cup Championship. In the off-season, Crosby was awarded his second Ted Lindsay Award and finished as runner-up to the Hart Memorial Trophy and Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy.|$|E

500|$|When {{the novel}} was first published, NASA invited Weir {{to tour the}} Johnson Space Center and Jet Propulsion Laboratory. When Scott began {{preparing}} the film, Weir contacted NASA to collaborate on the film. When Scott and producer Mark Huffam had their first production meeting, they called NASA and spoke with its film and television liaison Bert Ulrich. NASA decided to assist the filmmakers with depicting the science and technology in The Martian since it saw potential in promoting space exploration. Key NASA staff members that joined the partnership were James L. Green, the Director of the Planetary Science Division, and Dave Lavery, the Program Executive for Solar System Exploration. Scott conversed with Green twice before filming started. Over {{a period of a}} month, NASA answered hundreds of questions—on a weekly basis—on everything from radioisotope systems to the look of potential [...] "habs"—the residences for future Mars astronauts. The questions were answered by Green or passed on to the right expert, and then came back to Scott's team to make their way into the production. The space agency also sent hundreds of files of real images of Mars and images of control centers, <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> the computer screens look like, to the production team. Green arranged a tour of the Johnson Space Center in Houston for production designer Arthur Max, who met with individual specialists, taking hundreds of photos as he went for eight hours. The production designers created a futuristic, heavily modernized Mission Control as a studio set; Ars Technica described its depiction as [...] "the space agency that we all dream of" [...] and the opposite of the real Johnson Center's appearance as [...] "a run down college campus".|$|E
500|$|Goddard {{compared}} the romance between Lily and Cane to Lady Chatterley's Lover since both characters grew and {{learned from the}} relationship. Cane developed an attraction to Heather Stevens (portrayed by Vail Bloom) while with Lily; Goddard noted it would [...] "come <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> Cane needs" [...] when choosing between the two women. The storylines written for the lovers included a controversy with the characters' age gap, a miscarriage, and a love rectangle with Chloe Mitchell (Elizabeth Hendrickson) and Billy Abbott (Billy Miller). Within the love rectangle story, Chloe tricks Cane into thinking they conceived a child together. To make the storyline work, the writers scripted Cane as less intelligent, a strategy they used previously during his storyline with Amber. To keep the character from looking bad, Goddard said he made acting choices to justify Cane's actions. Despite the lessening of the character's intelligence, Goddard said he liked the story because of the originality of the plot. Love triangles and questioned paternity happen regularly in soap operas, but he felt that former head writer Maria Arena Bell managed to make those conventions fresh and new. Khalil stated that she [...] "loved" [...] the storyline, also saying she loved the actors involved in it. Khalil said she thought it [...] "was a possibility" [...] for Lily and Cane to have a happy ending, and that Lily [...] "can see the hope, and they can adapt and love {{each other in a}} more mature and honest way". Cane married Lily in 2009, and the following year, Global BC called Lily the love of Cane's life. In 2011, Lily divorced Cane after he continued to lie to her about his faked death. However, she eventually discovered Cane was trying to protect her, and they were remarried. Goddard commented that their relationship [...] "had come full circle" [...] and [...] "was being done well". Of Cane and Lily's second wedding, Goddard stated that Cane and Lily have [...] "certainly had a lot of ups and downs", but he thought through all of that their fans [...] "stayed true and they have expressed their desire for what they want to see". Goddard also thought their wedding of [...] "this caliber" [...] would make their fans [...] "very, very happy and that is what this is about".|$|E
500|$|Guitar Hero 5 {{was well}} {{received}} upon release. Seth Schiesel of The New York Times called Guitar Hero 5 [...] "the most enjoyable Guitar Hero game in several years" [...] and [...] "generally well-tuned, often exhilarating rock ’n’ roll experience". [...] Keza MacDonald of Eurogamer commented {{that there is}} [...] "just nothing wrong" [...] with Guitar Hero 5, given the various stumbling blocks the developers had made from previous iterations of the game, {{and the way the}} developers have continued to find new additions to the game. Reviewers greatly appreciated the new features in the game {{to make it easier to}} jump in and play music, from the simplification of the menu system to the availability of every song in all the game modes from the start. Erik Brudvig of IGN considers the menu change to be [...] "one of the best things that Neversoft has done", although the menus are a minor part of the game, it removes much of the frustration with the World Tour and other previous Guitar Hero games' menu systems. Arthur Gies of GameSpy noted that by simplification of the interface, [...] "Neversoft stripped Guitar Hero <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> works and built up from there". Reviewers appreciated the immediate launch of the game's Party Mode once the player put the disk in the system and the ability to jump right into that song through the new menus, and considered this to help make the game enjoyable for social gatherings. Chris Watters of GameSpot considered this mode to be [...] "accessible, welcoming, and delightfully low key". The changes in Career mode, in which the players need not stick to the same instrument or difficulty throughout, was well appreciated. Brudvig appreciated how this allows the player to complete the Career mode without getting stuck on a song, having to go back to replay the Career mode on other instruments, and that with the addition of song Challenges, provides enough incentive to return to the songs to improve one's performance. The new multiplayer modes in Rockfest, which replaced more [...] "arcadey" [...] competitive modes, were considered a welcome replacement, as it allowed players of various skill levels to compete fairly against each other, making the game more friendly to the multiplayer experience. However, Matt Helgeson of Game Informer noted that despite the various RockFest modes, it [...] "all comes down to hitting the notes correctly".|$|E

2500|$|This is at {{the heart}} of the tetralogy's achievement. Updike once said of the Rabbit books that they were an {{exercise}} in point of view. This was typically self-deprecating, but contains an important grain of truth. Harry's education extends no further than high school, and his view is further limited by a range of prejudices and a stubborn, combative spirit, yet he is the vehicle for a half-million-word meditation on postwar American anxiety, failure and prosperity. A mode had to be devised to make this possible, and that involved pushing beyond the bounds of realism. In a novel like this, Updike insisted, you have to be generous and allow your characters eloquence, [...] "and not chop them <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> you think is the right size." ...|$|E

2500|$|During {{his time}} in Geneva, Chamberlain, who always despised Benjamin Disraeli, came to hate his country more and more, accusing Disraeli of taking British life <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> Chamberlain {{considered}} to be his extremely low level. During the early 1880s, Chamberlain was still a Liberal, [...] "a man who approached issues from a firmly Gladstonian perspective and showed a marked antipathy to the philosophy and policies of British Conservatism". Chamberlain often expressed his disgust with Disraeli, [...] "the man whom he blamed in large measure for the injection of selfish class interest and jingoism into British public life in the next decades". In 1881, {{he wrote to his}} family in Britain, praising William Ewart Gladstone for introducing the Land Bill to bring in [...] "fair rents" [...] in Ireland and withdrawing from the Transvaal. An early sign of his anti-Semitism came in 1881 when he described the landlords in Ireland affected by the Land Bill as [...] "blood-sucking Jews (sic)", though at this stage of his life his anti-Semitic remarks were few and far between.|$|E
2500|$|Turner {{compared}} the Metallica project with a campaign {{they did for}} Coca-Cola, as both approaches went down to [...] "stripping things back <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> the brand was originally and the other part was adding a fresh new approach." [...] The original Metallica logo was brought back to demonstrate how the band was trying to restore their old identity, while the cover was primarily white to contrast how the color is hardly used in the metal genre. Given the band wanted the physical release to be memorable to ensure it still had valuable in an age where audiences were purchasing more digital music, the original digipak featuring a layered die cut, where each page of the booklet resembled a layer of dirt being thrown on the coffin. Death Magnetic was issued on vinyl in a special box set, and also had a deluxe edition shaped like a coffin, bundled along with an additional disc full of demos, a making-of DVD, an exclusive T-shirt, guitar picks, a flag and a fold-out poster.|$|E

[...] However, shortly afterwards, Rose told MTV News [...] "You'll see , but I don't know if 'soon' is the word". Dizzy Reed mentioned in November 2002 that the album [...] "should be in stores by June (2003)" [...] and stating there were only [...] "a few odds and ends left to do, a couple of finishing touches, a couple of vocals – {{and we need to}} mix it." [...] Rose also confirmed the plans for multiple albums and stated that a part of the delay was due to lack of support from the label to older bands, saying, [...] "I've had to do way more jobs in it than I'm supposed to. I've had to be manager, A man, producer, sole lyric writer, {{and a lot of other}} things." [...] An editor from antiMUSIC claimed Rose told him in an informal chat in June 2003 that [...] "he wants to make sure it is a perfect as possible before it is released". In mid-2003, the band reportedly started the process of re-recording the album again. Shortly after Buckethead left the band in March 2004, Rose {{released a}} statement saying, [...] "Guns will be moving forward, we hope to announce a release date within the next few months."
