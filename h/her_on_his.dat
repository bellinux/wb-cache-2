[...] In fact it was four years later, in the summer of 1899, that he finally created the large painting Summer Evening at Skagen Beach – The Artist and his Wife. The result nevertheless has a rather melancholic tone. Despite the beautiful surroundings, Marie appears distant, disappearing into the blue moonlight. Even Krøyer's own weak figure seems to be experiencing difficulty in supporting <b>her</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> arm while the closest figure of all is Rap the dog. The painting again presents the blue half-light. Krøyer particularly appreciated [...] "l'heure bleue": [...] "Skagen can look so terribly dull in the bright sunlight ... but when the sun goes down, when the moon rises up out of the sea ... in recent years this has been the time I like most of all." ...|$|E
