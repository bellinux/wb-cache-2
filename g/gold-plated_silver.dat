5|$|When {{the title}} was created, a {{suggested}} medal was drafted and designed by the government. The major difference between this medal and the current medal is {{the design of the}} suspension and the star medallion at the bottom: the top suspension is longer than the bottom, and the bottom star is outlined differently and is adorned with rubies. The suspension was made from <b>gold-plated</b> <b>silver,</b> while the suspension of the current medal is made from gold, as the medal. The design of the star evokes the Marshal's Star, which Soviet Marshals wore around their necks. This medal was adopted by Presidential Decree Number 26 on May 15, 1996.|$|E
5|$|The athletes or teams who place first, second, {{or third}} in each event receive medals. The winners receive gold medals, which were solid gold until 1912, then made of gilded silver and now <b>gold-plated</b> <b>silver.</b> Every gold medal however must contain {{at least six}} grams of pure gold. The runners-up receive silver medals and the third-place athletes are awarded bronze medals. In events contested by a single-elimination tournament (most notably boxing), third place might not be {{determined}} and both semifinal losers receive bronze medals. At the 1896 Olympics only the first two received a medal; silver for first and bronze for second. The current three-medal format was introduced at the 1904 Olympics. From 1948 onward athletes placing fourth, fifth, and sixth have received certificates, which became officially known as victory diplomas; in 1984 victory diplomas for seventh- and eighth-place finishers were added. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, the gold, silver, and bronze medal winners were also given olive wreaths. The IOC does not keep statistics of medals won, but National Olympic Committees and the media record medal statistics {{as a measure of}} success.|$|E
25|$|The Olympic medals {{awarded to}} winners are another symbol {{associated}} with the Olympic games. The medals are made of <b>gold-plated</b> <b>silver</b> (commonly described as gold medals), silver, or bronze, and awarded to the top 3 finishers in a particular event. Each medal for an Olympiad has a common design, decided upon by the organizers for the particular games. From 1928 until 2000, the obverse side of the medals contained an image of Nike, the traditional goddess of victory, holding a palm in her left hand and a winner's crown in her right. This design was created by Giuseppe Cassioli. For each Olympic games, the reverse side {{as well as the}} labels for each Olympiad changed, reflecting the host of the games.|$|E

The body of the Cup {{is in the form}} of a shuttlecock and is surmounted by a replica of the Borobudur Temple. The handles are in the shape of stamens, symbolising the seeds of badminton.|$|R
50|$|The Jewel and Chain of Office is {{worn by the}} {{university}} president at ceremonial occasions. The Jewel of Office is handcrafted of <b>gold-plated</b> sterling <b>silver</b> and precious jewels. Each part of the design has a symbolic meaning that reflects IU's historic origin and educational mission, noting {{such things as the}} number of states in the Union when {{the university}} was founded in 1820 (22 states), the year Indiana became a state (1816), and the years that mark IU's evolution from a seminary to a university (1820, 1828 and 1838). The jewels in the item include emeralds, sapphires, topaz, rubies and diamonds. The Jewel of Office was presented to the university in 1946 by the Pi chapter of Beta Theta Pi. The Chain of Office was donated to the university in 1958 by the Lambda chapter of Sigma Chi. The chain is handcrafted of <b>gold-plated</b> sterling <b>silver</b> and contains 44 linked panels, eight of which are engraved with the names of the presidents who have served the university since the Jewel of Office was first worn as the symbol of the presidency.|$|R
5000|$|Glühwein (roughly {{translated}} as [...] "glow-wine", {{from the hot}} irons once used for mulling) is popular in German-speaking countries and {{in the region of}} Alsace in France. It is a traditional beverage that is offered during the Christmas holidays. The oldest documented Glühwein tankard is attributed to Count John IV of Katzenelnbogen, a German nobleman who was the first grower of Riesling grapes. This <b>gold-plated</b> lockable <b>silver</b> tankard is dated to c. 1420.|$|R
25|$|The Mass at Bolsena, {{depicted}} {{in a famous}} fresco by Raphael at the Vatican in Rome, was an incident said {{to have taken place}} in 1263. A Bohemian priest who doubted the doctrine of transubstantiation, celebrated mass at Bolsena, a town north of Rome. During the mass the bread of the eucharist began to bleed. The blood from the host fell onto the altar linen {{in the shape of the}} face of Jesus as traditionally represented, and the priest came to believe. The following year, in 1264, Pope Urban IV instituted the Feast of Corpus Christi to celebrate this miraculous event. A <b>gold-plated</b> <b>silver</b> and enamel reliquary was made in 1337-1338 by Sienese goldsmith Ugolino di Vieri to house the relic. The blood-stained Corporal of Bolsena is still venerated as a major relic in Orvieto Cathedral.|$|E

The Gemini 3 The Molly Brown emblem was designed and minted on <b>gold-plated,</b> sterling <b>silver,</b> 1-inch (25-mm) medallions. The crew carried {{a number of these}} medallions into space to give to their families and friends.

John Young was seen wearing the emblem as a patch, produced post-flight, on his flightsuit as late as 1981.|$|R
5000|$|The medal was a <b>gold-plated</b> {{sterling}} <b>silver</b> cross, enamelled in Oxford blue, {{bearing a}} roundel in the centre struck {{with the gold}} [...] "wounded lion" [...] device of the BSAP on a white field. The cross was suspended from an Oxford blue ribbon with two narrow stripes of scarlet, edged with silver, {{very similar to that}} of the British Queen's Police Medal, which it replaced. The medal was impressed in small capitals with the recipient's name on the reverse, and was awarded with a case of issue, miniature medal for wear, and an illuminated certificate.|$|R

5000|$|Abel Lafleur (4 November 1875 [...] - [...] 27 January 1953) was a French {{sculptor}} {{who designed}} {{and made the}} FIFA World Cup trophy, first simply called 'Coupe du Monde', later renamed the Jules Rimet Trophy. The trophy was 35 cm in height, weighed 3.8 kg and was made of <b>gold-plated</b> sterling <b>silver,</b> with a blue base of semi-precious stone (lapis lazuli). On the four sides of the base there were four gold plates, onto which would be written {{the names of the}} winners of the trophy. The sculpture, although based on the incomplete Nike of Samothrace ("The Goddess of Victory"), which remains on display at the Louvre, was designed to include the shallow, octagonal cup supported by upraised arms and a garland surrounding the model's head. Lafleur knowingly dispensed with the faithful, dynamic design (as used by Rolls-Royce to adorn their vehicles) but decided on a static representation that would assist in how the trophy was held.|$|R
500|$|The Jules Rimet Trophy was the {{original}} prize for winning the Football World Cup. Originally called [...] "Victory", but generally known simply as the World Cup or Coupe du Monde, it was renamed in 1946 to honour the FIFA President Jules Rimet who in 1929 passed a vote to initiate the competition. It was designed by Abel Lafleur and made of <b>gold-plated</b> sterling <b>silver</b> on a white/yellow marble base. In 1954 this base was replaced with a high base made of lapis lazuli. It stood 35centimetres (14in) high and weighed 3.8kilograms (8.4lb). It comprised a decagonal cup, supported by a winged figure representing Nike, the ancient Greek goddess of victory. The Jules Rimet Trophy was taken to Uruguay for the first FIFA World Cup aboard the Conte Verde, which set sail from Villefranche-sur-Mer, just southeast of Nice, on 21 June 1930. This was the same ship that carried Jules Rimet and the footballers representing France, Romania and Belgium who were participating in the tournament that year. The first team to be awarded the trophy was Uruguay, {{the winners of the}} 1930 World Cup.|$|R

Men {{typically}} wore chokhas and covered their head with papakhas, many variations {{of which could}} symbolize the men's social status. Wealthier men's dress was adorned with many pieces of jewelry, including silver and gold-decorated weaponry, pins, chains, belts, or kisets (small purse used to hold tobacco or coins). Women's dress was typically of simpler design in dark tones, made from silk, brocade, velvet, satin and later wool. They decorated the fabric with beads, gold pins or buttons, and <b>silver</b> <b>gold-plated</b> belts. Outside the house, both single and married women covered their hair with headscarves.|$|R

50|$|Father Gloyd's tenure was {{relatively}} short, {{compared to the}} 22-year term of Father McNally. Father McNally's advanced age left him somewhat unable {{to attend to the}} church's finances as well as he might have, and St. Stephe Martyr had incurred a significant amount of debt. Father Gloyd worked diligently to improve the church's income, and paid off the debt. During this time, he also conducted a campaign to collect old gold and silver jewelry from parishioners, which was then melted down and turned into a solid gold chalice and a solid <b>silver</b> <b>gold-plated</b> chalice. He also undertook repairs and made general improvements to the church and rectory. In April 1894, Father Jacob Walter at nearby St. Patrick's Catholic Church died, and James Gibbons, Archbishop of Baltimore, assigned Father Gloyd as his successor. The Rev. John J. Dougherty of St. Edward's Catholic Church in Calverton, Maryland, succeeded Gloyd on May 14, 1894.|$|R
2500|$|As the {{building}} was designed to echo the Washington Monument, the sides of {{the building}} slope slightly inward, and each floor of the Foshay Tower is slightly smaller than the one below it. It is also unusual in that the tower is set back from the street, with a two-story structure surrounding it on the Marquette Avenue and 9th Street sides. The other two sides of the building, facing 8th Street and 2nd Avenue, are now surrounded by the TCF Tower, which rises to seventeen stories on the 2nd Avenue side and entirely obscures the views from the windows of the first seven stories of the Foshay Tower on the 2nd Avenue and 8th Street sides. Internally the building uses steel and reinforced concrete. The exterior is faced with Indiana limestone, while the interior features African Mahogany, Italian marble, terrazzo, <b>gold-plated</b> doorknobs, a <b>silver</b> and gold plated ceiling, ornamental bronze, hand wrought iron and three commissioned busts of George Washington. It cost US$3.75 million to build.
