5|$|The KLA's {{popularity}} skyrocketed {{after the}} VJ and MUP attacked the compound of KLA leader Adem Jashari in March 1998, killing him, his closest associates {{and most of}} his family.

5|$|In 1969, the <b>Kosovar</b> Albanian {{population}} {{was able to}} use the Albanian flag as its national flag. However, the flag had to be charged with a red star, since this was a common symbol of the Yugoslav nation. Even without this requirement, the flag of the People's Socialist Republic of Albania at the time had a red star, outlined in gold, above the double headed eagle. Later on, different nationalities in Kosovo could use their own national flags in accordance with legislation.|$|E
5|$|In April 1917, Pećanac re-emerged {{with his}} guerrillas, attacking a railway station, {{destroying}} a bridge and raiding a Bulgarian {{village on the}} border. Pećanac avoided a further offensive by the occupation forces in July by disappearing into the mountains once again. After emerging for a short time, in September–October 1917 Pećanac again dispersed his guerrillas and infiltrated the Austro-Hungarian occupied zone, where he remained in hiding until mid-1918. During his period in hiding, {{he met with the}} <b>Kosovar</b> Albanian leader Azem Galica to discuss joint actions against the occupation forces.|$|E
50|$|Negotiations stopped. The <b>Kosovars</b> {{unilaterally}} {{proclaimed the}} Republic of Kosovo, and obligating themselves {{to follow the}} Ahtisaari plan's provisions in full. Border demarcation talks with Macedonia were delayed because the <b>Kosovars</b> insisted on the pre-condition of official recognition but eventually withdrew the opposition. The 2008 Kosovo declaration of independence elicited mixed international reaction and was domestically continuously polarizing between the Kosovo Serbs and the Kosovo Albanians.|$|R
50|$|The largest {{numbers of}} Kosovan emigrants {{are found in}} Germany (300,000), Switzerland (350,000), the U.S. and Scandinavia, making almost 800,000 <b>Kosovars</b> living abroad.|$|R
30|$|In {{quantitative}} {{studies on}} migrants, {{the need for}} sufficient observations often induces researchers to conflate <b>Kosovars</b> with other groups from South Western Balkans, rendering them invisible. <b>Kosovars</b> were already a regional sub-category of Yugoslavians in Tito’s time, but when the political and later armed conflict within successor states of Yugoslavia lead to the constitution of a separate country in the Balkans, it also revitalised a distinctive sense of belonging as Kosovo Albanians, mostly culturally Muslims, facing an unfavourable and sometimes hostile immigrant-receiving context.|$|R
5|$|When Kosovo {{was under}} the {{administration}} of the United Nations, the UN flag was flown in Kosovo. However, the flag used by the <b>Kosovar</b> Albanian population was the Albanian flag. The Albanian flag was also used on public buildings, even though it was against UN regulations. Regulations stated only the UN flag and other authorised flags, like those of cities, could fly on public buildings. If the Albanian flag did have to go up, then the Serbian flag must go up too, according to UN regulations. However, this was never done in practice and the flag of Albania was ever-present in Kosovo during the UNMIK period.|$|E

5000|$|In a {{statement}} issued 19 February 2008 the U.S. State Department argued every territorial conflict is unique. It said Kosovo's unilateral independence cannot be used by other states to resolve disputes. When asked about the Kosovo's independence in reference to recognition of South Ossetia, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice dismissed it and said, [...] "we've been very clear that Kosovo is sui generis and that that {{is because of the}} special circumstances out of which the breakup of Yugoslavia came. The special circumstances of the aggression of the Milosevic forces against <b>Kosovars,</b> particularly Albanian <b>Kosovars,</b> and it’s a special circumstance." ...|$|R

25|$|Despite {{official}} UN and Russian disapproval, the US, UK, and France appeared {{likely to}} recognize <b>Kosovar</b> independence {{if it had}} been declared on 28 November 2007 or on 10 December 2007, the deadline for an agreement between Kosovo and Serbia set by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon.

25|$|Due to Serbian {{claims that}} Kosovo {{is part of}} its {{sovereign}} territory, its initial reactions included recalling ambassadors from countries that recognised Kosovo for several months, indicting <b>Kosovar</b> leaders on charges of high treason, and litigating the case at the International Court of Justice (ICJ). Serbia also expelled ambassadors from countries that recognised Kosovo after the UNGA vote adopting Serbia's initiative to seek an ICJ advisory opinion.|$|E

25|$|Soon {{after the}} killing, some {{commentators}} identified {{the possibility of}} a Yugoslav or Serb connection.

Sixteen station staff had died in the bombing. Mansfield suggested that Dando's earlier presentation of an appeal for aid for <b>Kosovar</b> Albanian refugees may have attracted the attention of Bosnian-Serb hardliners.|$|E
