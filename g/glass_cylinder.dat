25|$|The {{classification}} of fine-grained soils, i.e., soils that are finer than sand, is determined primarily by their Atterberg limits, not by their grain size. If {{it is important}} to determine the grain size distribution of fine-grained soils, the hydrometer test may be performed. In the hydrometer tests, the soil particles are mixed with water and shaken to produce a dilute suspension in a <b>glass</b> <b>cylinder,</b> and then the cylinder is left to sit. A hydrometer is used to measure the density of the suspension as a function of time. Clay particles may take several hours to settle past the depth of measurement of the hydrometer. Sand particles may take less than a second. Stoke's law provides the theoretical basis to calculate the relationship between sedimentation velocity and particle size. ASTM provides the detailed procedures for performing the Hydrometer test.|$|E

We can not have a magnet with one pole: if we break a natural loadstone into a thousand pieces, each piece will have its two oppositely electrified poles complete within itself.

6000|$|... 1180. Electrometer.--The {{measuring}} instrument I have employed {{has been the}} torsion balance electrometer of Coulomb, constructed, generally, according to his directions[A], but with certain variations and additions, which I will briefly describe. The lower part was a <b>glass</b> <b>cylinder</b> eight inches in height and eight inches in diameter; the tube for the torsion thread was seventeen inches in length. The torsion thread itself was not of metal, but glass, according to the excellent suggestion of the late Dr. Ritchie[B]. It was twenty inches in length, and of such tenuity that when the shell-lac lever and attached ball, &c. were connected with it, they made about ten vibrations in a minute. It would bear torsion through four revolutions or 1440°, and yet, when released, return accurately to its position; probably it would have borne considerably more than this without injury. The repelled ball was of pith, gilt, and was 0.3 of an inch in diameter. The horizontal stem or lever supporting it was of shell-lac, according to Coulomb's direction, the arm carrying the ball being 2.4 inches long, and the other only 1.2 inches: to this was attached the vane, also described by Coulomb, which I found to answer admirably its purpose of quickly destroying vibrations. That the inductive action within the electrometer might be uniform in all positions of the repelled ball and in all states of the apparatus, two bands of tin foil, about an inch wide each, were attached to the inner surface of the <b>glass</b> <b>cylinder,</b> going entirely round it, at the distance of 0.4 of an inch from each other, and at such a height that the intermediate clear surface {{was in the same}} horizontal plane with the lever and ball. These bands were connected {{with each other and with}} the earth, and, being perfect conductors, always exerted a uniform influence on the electrified balls within, which the glass surface, from its irregularity of condition at different times, I found, did not. For the purpose of keeping the air within the electrometer in a constant state as to dryness, a glass dish, of such size as to enter easily within the cylinder, had a layer of fused potash placed within it, and this being covered with a disc of fine wire-gauze to render its inductive action uniform at all parts, was placed within the instrument at the bottom and left there.|$|E

On a circle or ring of paper {{on the outside of the}} <b>glass</b> <b>cylinder,</b> fixed so as to cover the internal lower ring of tinfoil, were marked four points corresponding to angles of 90°; four other points exactly corresponding to these points being marked on the upper ring of tinfoil within. By these and the adjusting screws on which the whole instrument stands, the glass torsion thread could be brought accurately into the centre of the instrument and of the graduations on it. From one of the four points on the exterior of the cylinder a graduation of 90° was set off, and a corresponding graduation was placed upon the upper tinfoil on the opposite side of the cylinder within; and a dot being marked on that point of the surface of the repelled ball nearest to the side of the electrometer, it was easy, by observing the line which this dot made with the lines of the two graduations just referred to, to ascertain accurately the position of the ball. The upper end of the glass thread was attached, as in Coulomb's original electrometer, to an index, which had its appropriate graduated circle, upon which the degree of torsion was ultimately to be read off.|$|E

Materials and Methods: Artificial gaps were created in 160 borosilicate <b>glass</b> <b>cylinders.</b> One-half of the internal surface of each cylinder was blocked out with wax and the other half was sandblasted. The bonding surface was further treated with 4 % hydrofluoric acid, rinsed, and then coated with silane. After removal of the wax, one coat of dentin adhesive was applied to the silane-treated surface of the cylinder, briefly air dried and light cured. Eight light-cured restorative materials were placed incrementally: Vitremer (V), Fuji II LC (FJ), Beautifil (B), Reactmer Paste (R), Compoglass F (C), F 2000 (F), Filtek Z 250 (Z), and Tetric-Ceram (T). For each material, ten specimens were stored in deionized water (W), and ten (control) in nonaqueous silicone fluid (0) at 37 °C. The dimension of the same maximum gap created in each specimen was repeatedly measured at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 weeks. Results: R-W exhibited extensive hygroscopic expansion that resulted in cracking of 40 % of <b>glass</b> <b>cylinders</b> after the 2 nd week and 70 % after the 4 th week. One-way ANOVA of the other seven water groups showed significant differences (p 0. 05). Conclusion: Marginal gap reduction that results from water sorption is more extensive and rapid in RMG-ICs, followed by compomers, whereas composites are relatively stable. Reactmer Paste exhibits rapid and extensive expansion and should probably be avoided in tooth preparations that involve thin unsupported enamel. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
