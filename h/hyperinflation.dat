5|$|Narrowing of the airways occurs due to {{inflammation}} and scarring within them. This {{contributes to the}} inability to breathe out fully. The greatest reduction in air flow occurs when breathing out, as the pressure in the chest is compressing the airways at this time. This can result in more air from the previous breath remaining within the lungs when the next breath is started, resulting {{in an increase in}} the total volume of air in the lungs at any given time, a process called <b>hyperinflation</b> or air trapping. <b>Hyperinflation</b> from exercise is linked to shortness of breath in COPD, as it is less comfortable to breathe in when the lungs are already partly full. <b>Hyperinflation</b> may also worsen during an exacerbation.|$|E

5|$|Congress sanctioned the {{economic}} emergency {{law and the}} state reform law. The first allowed the president to reduce or remove subsidies, and the latter to privatize state enterprises – the first being telephones and airlines. These privatizations were beneficial to foreign creditors, who replaced their bonds with company shares. Despite increased tax revenue, and the money from privatizations, the economy was still unstable. The Bunge and Born businessmen left the government in late 1989, amid {{a second round of}} <b>hyperinflation.</b> The first measure of the new minister of economy, Érman González, was a mandatory conversion of time deposits into government bonds: the Bonex plan. It generated more recession, but <b>hyperinflation</b> was reduced. He also reduces social spending, including those for people with disabilities.|$|E

40|$|Prolonged {{artificial}} ventilation {{may result in}} worsening gas exchange and pulmonary compliance in patients with otherwise normal lungs. Prolonged <b>hyperinflations</b> to 40 cm H 2 O can completely reverse deterioration of gas exchange and compliance in such patients. Similar efforts have effectively recruited atelectatic lung regions in critically ill patients. Less aggressive <b>hyperinflations</b> have not improved lung function in patients with abnormal lungs with hypoxemia. However, sustained exaggerated <b>hyperinflations</b> may successfully open collapsed lung units in these patients when standard recruitment techniques fail. We compared periodic <b>hyperinflations</b> of 40 cm H 2 O lasting 15 to 30 sec associated with body positioning (directed recruitment [DR]) to standard bag-sigh-suctioning (BSS) for their effects on gas exchange and pulmonary compliance in 16 stable surgical ICU patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure of 24 -h duration or longer. Patients were sequentially alternated between DR and BSS (group 1, BSS followed by DR; group 2, DR followed by BSS). Neither technique, alone or in sequence, resulted in a sustained (≥ 5 min) improvement or deterioration in either gas exchange or pulmonary compliance. We conclude that neither BSS nor DR reliably affects gas exchange or compliance in patients with establish ed hypoxemic respiratory failure...|$|R

5|$|Low oxygen levels and, eventually, {{high carbon}} dioxide {{levels in the}} blood can occur from poor gas {{exchange}} due to decreased ventilation from airway obstruction, <b>hyperinflation</b> and a reduced desire to breathe. During exacerbations, airway inflammation is also increased, resulting in increased <b>hyperinflation,</b> reduced expiratory airflow and worsening of gas transfer. This {{can also lead to}} insufficient ventilation and, eventually, low blood oxygen levels. Low oxygen levels, if present for a prolonged period, can result in narrowing of the arteries in the lungs, while emphysema leads to breakdown of capillaries in the lungs. Both these changes result in increased blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries, which may cause cor pulmonale.|$|E

40|$|High and {{persistent}} inflation {{has been one}} of the distinguishing macroeconomic characteristics of many developing countries - particularly in Latin America - since the end of World War II. Pazos (1972) coined the term "chronic inflation" to refer the this phenomenon. In his view, chronic inflation is quite a different creature from the much more spectacular <b>hyperinflations</b> studied by Cagan (1956). First, unlike <b>hyperinflations</b> whose duration is measured in terms of months, chronic inflation may last for decades. Second, countries learn how to live with high {{and persistent}} inflation by creating various indexation mechanisms which, in turn, tend to perpetuate the inflationary process. As a result, inflation does not have an inherent propensity to accelerate and, if it does, soon reaches a new plateau...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} effect on {{respiratory}} function of different continuous positive airway pressure systems and periodic <b>hyperinflations</b> in patients with respiratory failure. DESIGN: Prospective SETTING: Hospital intensive care unit. PATIENTS: Sixteen intubated patients (eight men and eight women, age 54 +/- 18 yrs, PaO 2 /FiO 2 277 +/- 58 torr, positive end-expiratory pressure 6. 2 +/- 2. 0 cm H 2 O). INTERVENTIONS: We evaluated continuous flow positive airway pressure systems with high or low flow plus a reservoir bag equipped with spring-loaded mechanical or underwater seal positive end-expiratory pressure valve and a continuous positive airway pressure by a Servo 300 C ventilator with or without periodic <b>hyperinflations</b> (three assisted breaths per minute with constant inspiratory pressure of 30 cm H 2 O over positive end-expiratory pressure). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We measured the respiratory pattern, work of breathing, dyspnea sensation, end-expiratory lung volume, and gas exchange. We found the following: a) Work of breathing and gas exchange were comparable between continuous flow systems; b) the ventilator continuous positive airway pressure was not different compared with continuous flow systems; and c) continuous positive airway pressure with periodic <b>hyperinflations</b> reduced work of breathing (10. 7 +/- 9. 5 vs. 6. 3 +/- 5. 7 J/min, p <. 05) and dyspnea sensation (1. 6 +/- 1. 2 vs. 1. 1 +/- 0. 8 cm, p <. 05) increased end-expiratory lung volume (1. 6 +/- 0. 8 vs. 2. 0 +/- 0. 9 L, p <. 05) and PaO 2 (100 +/- 21 vs. 120 +/- 25 torr, p <. 05) compared with ventilator continuous positive airway pressure. CONCLUSIONS: The continuous flow positive airway pressure systems tested are equally efficient; a ventilator can provide satisfactory continuous positive airway pressure; {{and the use of}} periodic <b>hyperinflations</b> during continuous positive airway pressure can improve respiratory function and reduce the work of breathing...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a multi-period {{extension of the}} Lucas (1972) overlapping generations "island" model with endogenous monetary policy (based on the minimization of a loss function over inflation and output deviations) and stochastic realization of the "allocation" {{of the young people}} across the two islands. These allocation realizations are interpreted as output shocks (since only the young people produce). The paper examines two cases: the certainty case when the exact monetary policy is known to the young, and uncertainty case where the young receive only a mixed signal of the output shock and the monetary policy weights through the price (the signal extraction problem). In the certainty case, the neutrality result holds. In the uncertainty case, even monetary shocks have real effects {{as a result of the}} signal extraction problem. After characterizing the resulting price function by its constant elasticity to the signal, we derive values of this elasticity and the monetary policy weights such that <b>hyperinflations</b> will develop. We find that for certain weights, <b>hyperinflations</b> can develop even when the price function is concave in the signal. Finally, we formulate a particular convex case of the price function (making distributional assumptions) to analyze the price and monetary policy examples and statics as functions of the weights on the inflation and output deviation terms.
