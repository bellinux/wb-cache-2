25|$|Dhanteras (celebrated in Northern and Western part of India) {{starts off}} the five day festival. Starting days before and through Dhanteras, houses and {{business}} premises are cleaned, renovated and decorated. Women and children decorate entrances with Rangoli – creative colourful floor designs {{both inside and}} in the walkways of their homes or offices. Boys and men <b>get</b> <b>busy</b> with external lighting arrangements and completing all renovation work in progress. For some, the day celebrates the churning of cosmic ocean of milk between the forces of good and forces of evil; this day marks the birthday of Lakshmi – the Goddess of Wealth and Prosperity, and the birthday of Dhanvantari – the God of Health and Healing. On the night of Dhanteras, diyas (lamps) are ritually kept burning all through the nights in honor of Lakshmi and Dhanvantari.|$|E

Schonberg, {{music critic}} at The New York Times, having {{just heard the}} Rifkin album, wrote a {{featured}} Sunday edition article entitled [...] "Scholars, <b>Get</b> <b>Busy</b> on Scott Joplin!" [...] Schonberg's call to action {{has been described as}} the catalyst for classical music scholars, the sort of people Joplin had battled all his life, to conclude that Joplin was a genius.

2500|$|On May 7, 2011, Nick Dellasega {{collapsed}} at a <b>Get</b> <b>Busy</b> Living 5K race in Pittsburg, Kansas (honoring {{the memory}} of Dylan Meier).

His childhood friend, EMT Micah Ehling, is quoted by The Wichita Eagle as saying [...] "I know what a face looks like when the soul leaves the body. And that's what Nick looked like". Some bystanders attribute Dellasega's survival to the devotion of his cousin, Jonah Dellasega, who fell to his knees at the scene and prayed to Kapaun. In a strange coincidence not reported by The Eagle, Dylan Meier, in whose memory the 5K was being held, was slated to teach English in Korea {{at the time of his}} death.|$|E

2500|$|GameSpot's Josh Smith {{scored the}} PlayStation version 7 out of 10, writing [...] "With {{innovative}} graphics, great level design, and awesome special weapons, everything looks great on paper. A number of flaws limit the game's life span, though, and {{raise questions about}} what's really important in games - style, mood, and vibe or solid gameplay, consistent graphics, and a continual challenge." [...] He was critical of the graphics, saying [...] "you may wish they'd traded {{a little of the}} game's visual inventiveness for some consistent graphical clarity. There's a ton of polygon dropout. And when things <b>get</b> <b>busy,</b> with dozens of onscreen enemies, projectiles, and explosions (which is in almost every scene), things slow way, way down, or animation frames disappear." [...] He also felt the game was too short, concluding [...] "MDK is something of a mixed bag. Amazing graphics style, but little graphical consistency. Awesome combat action, but little combat challenge. Great puzzles, but they're really pretty simple, and the whole game can be solved without using too many brain cells." ...|$|E
