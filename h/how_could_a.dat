25|$|Traditionally, France {{refused to}} accept the idea that courts could quash {{legislation}} enacted by Parliament (though administrative courts could quash regulations produced by the executive). This goes back to the French revolutionary era: pre-revolutionary courts had often used their power not to register laws and thus prevent their application for political purposes, and had blocked reforms. French courts were then prohibited from making rulings of a general nature. Also, it seemed that if courts could quash legislation after it had been enacted and taken into account by citizens, it would introduce legal uncertainties: <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>a</b> citizen plan his or her actions according to what is legal or not if laws could a posteriori be found not to hold? Yet, in the late 20th century, courts, especially administrative courts, began applying the consequences of international treaties, including law of the European Union, as superior to national law.|$|E

Its aim is to enable a physician and a computer agent to establish {{the presence or absence of}} a dementia condition or diagnoses for a specific patient. The participants take turn in making the moves in a dialogue, every move consists of an argument or a critical question (a challenge) and during the process of arguments and counterarguments an argumentation-tree, in which a winner may be declared, is constructed. The following four particular problems are formulated and solved: 1. <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>an</b> appropriate argumentation graph be designed enabling a dementia debate; 2. <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>an</b> algorithm automatically select attacks in the argumentation graph on behalf of the computer agent using ACKTUS, a semantic web-application for modeling knowledge (1); 3 <b>a.</b> <b>how</b> <b>could</b> the reasoning in an argumentation graph be improved by using inquiry dialogues introduced by Black & Hunter (2) to ensure a correct winner election; 3 b <b>how</b> <b>could</b> it handle the mutual attack problem, and 4. <b>how</b> <b>could</b> the solutions for these issues be implemented?

500|$|The Raft of the Medusa {{was first}} {{shown at the}} 1819 Paris Salon, under the title Scène de Naufrage (Shipwreck Scene), {{although}} its real subject would have been unmistakable for contemporary viewers. The exhibition was sponsored by Louis XVIII and featured nearly 1,300 paintings, 208 sculptures and numerous other engravings and architectural designs. Géricault's canvas was the star at the exhibition: [...] "It strikes and attracts all eyes" [...] (Le Journal de Paris). Louis XVIII visited {{three days before the}} opening and said: [...] "", or [...] "Monsieur Géricault, you've painted a shipwreck, but it's not one for you". The critics were divided: the horror and [...] "terribilità" [...] of the subject exercised fascination, but devotees of classicism expressed their distaste for what they described as a [...] "pile of corpses", whose realism they considered {{a far cry from the}} [...] "ideal beauty" [...] represented by Girodet's Pygmalion and Galatea, which triumphed the same year. Géricault's work expressed a paradox: <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>a</b> hideous subject be translated into a powerful painting, how could the painter reconcile art and reality? Marie-Philippe Coupin de la Couperie, a French painter and contemporary of Géricault, provided one answer: [...] "Monsieur Géricault seems mistaken. The goal of painting is to speak to the soul and the eyes, not to repel." [...] The painting had fervent admirers too, including French writer and art critic Auguste Jal, who praised its political theme, its liberal position–its advancement of the negro and critique of ultra-royalism–and its modernity. The historian Jules Michelet approved: [...] "our whole society is aboard the raft of the Medusa".|$|E

Baugh asserted this as evidence against scientifically known ways that rocks form. However, laboratory tests discounted his claim about the hammer's being formed in the rock. J.R. Cole wrote, [...] "The stone concretion is real, and it looks impressive to someone unfamiliar with geological processes. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>a</b> modern artifact be stuck in Ordovician rock?

Schopenhauer declares that concepts a priori [...] " [...] have not sprung from perception, but come to it from within, first to receive a content from it.

2500|$|The Encomium {{opens with}} Gorgias {{explaining}} that [...] "a man, woman, speech, deed, city or action that {{is worthy of}} praise should be honored with acclaim, but the unworthy should be branded with blame" [...] (Gorgias 30). [...] In the speech Gorgias discusses the possible reasons for Helen’s journey to Troy. He explains that Helen could have been persuaded in one of four ways: by the gods, by physical force, by love, or by speech (logos). If it were indeed the plan of the gods that caused Helen to depart for Troy, Gorgias argues that those who blame her should face blame themselves, [...] "for a human’s anticipation cannot restrain a god’s inclination" [...] (Gorgias 31). [...] Gorgias explains that, by nature, the weak are ruled by the strong, and, since the gods are stronger than humans in all respects, Helen should be freed from her undesirable reputation. [...] If, however, Helen was abducted by force, {{it is clear that}} the aggressor committed a crime. [...] Thus, it should be he, not Helen, who should be blamed. [...] And if Helen was persuaded by love, she should also be rid of ill repute because [...] "if love is a god, with the divine power of the gods, <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>a</b> weaker person refuse and reject him? [...] But if love is a human sickness and a mental weakness, it must not be blamed as mistake, but claimed as misfortune" [...] (Gorgias 32). [...] Finally, if speech persuaded Helen, Gorgias claims he can easily clear her of blame. [...] Gorgias explains: [...] "Speech is a powerful master and achieves the most divine feats with the smallest and least evident body. [...] It can stop fear, relieve pain, create joy, and increase pity" [...] (Gorgias 31). It is here that Gorgias compares the effect of speech on the mind with the effect of drugs on the body. He states that Helen has the power to [...] "lead" [...] many bodies in competition by using her body as a weapon (Gumpert, 74). This image of [...] "bodies led and misled, brought together and led apart, is of paramount importance in Gorgias' speech," [...] (Gumpert, 74).|$|E
