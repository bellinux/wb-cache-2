40|$|Introduction: resent {{studies have}} been shown that normobaric hyperoxia (HO) can induce {{excitotoxicity}} and stress oxidative tolerance (ETT) in variety of organs such as brain. In this study, we examined the intermittent dose of normobaric hyperoxia (HO) on neurologic deficit, and superoxide dismutase activity in brain tissue of Huntington animal model. Method: The rats were divided to three groups. First group were exposed with HO intermittently (4 h× 6 days HO) and second two main group acted as controls, and were exposed to 21 % oxygen in the same chamber (room air, RA) discontinuously (4 h× 6 days InRA). Immediately, HO and RA groups were subjected to Huntington animal model (20 mg/kg of 3 -nitropropionic acid for 6 days), Because Huntington disease is a neurodegenerative disorder. Then, ETT induced by HO were measured by neurologic deficits such as string, limb withdrawal, <b>inclined</b> plane, beam <b>balance</b> test, and assessment of superoxide dismutase activity. Result: Our findings indicated that HO {{is involved in the}} induction of ETT. Pretreatment with HO improved neurologic deficits including string, limb withdrawal, <b>inclined</b> plane, beam <b>balance</b> test significantly. Preconditioning with HO increased superoxide dismutase activity significantly. Conclusion: Although further studies are needed to clarify the mechanisms of excitotoxicity tolerance, pretreatment with HO seem to partly exert their effects via increase cell viability and superoxide dismutase activity...|$|R

40|$|The article {{deals with}} the {{evolution}} of the jurisprudence of the Italian Constitutional Court concerning the legal status of the European Convention on Human Rights within the Italian legal order. Indeed, the Court has always tried to come through the gap between the formal value of ordinary law recognized in Italy to the Convention and its substantive content. After the constitutional reform of 2001, in its well-known judgments Nos. 348 and 349 of 2007, the Constitutional Court provided for a solution to the issue concerning the Convention’s value, recognizing its sub-constitutional status, as an “interposed source of law”. Nevertheless, the legal value of the European Convention on Human Rights as interposed source of law was reconsidered in the following constitutional case-law and it is still an open problem, because in some most recent judgments the Constitutional Court is <b>inclined</b> to <b>balance</b> the demands of the general interest of the community with the requirements of the protection of the individual’s fundamental rights and declares that a wide margin of appreciation exists with regard to the enforcement of ECHR also for the domestic judges...|$|R

In turn, Smbat recognized Adarnase’s royal status and personally crowned him in 899. The two men collaborated in defeating, in 904, the Abasgian king Constantine III, their common relative, who competed with Adarnase for hegemony in Inner Iberia (Shida Kartli) and with Smbat in Gogarene. Adarnase captured Constantine and turned him over to Smbat. But the latter, <b>inclined</b> to <b>balance</b> Adarnase’s growing power and extend Armenian influence to west Georgia, freed his captive. This move turned Adarnase against Smbat and the ensuing break and enmity weakened the both monarchs: Adarnase was dispossessed by Constantine of Inner Iberia (Shida Kartli) in 904, while Smbat was defeated and tortured to death by Yusuf, a Sajid ruler of Azerbaijan in 914.

40|$|Abstract Citizens, {{especially}} those who are knowledgeable and care the most about politics, are motivated to defend their beliefs and attitudes {{in the face of}} discrepant information. These motivated biases strongly influence the way people think about health care policies and the politicians and parties that propose or attack these conten-tious policies. Three cognitive mechanisms are identified: a prior belief effect, confir-mation bias, and disconfirmation bias. Together, these information processes conspire to produce persistence and polarization of opinion on health care policies. Citizens, {{especially those}} who know and care the most about public poli-cies, are not open- minded. They are not <b>inclined</b> toward <b>balance</b> or even-handedness when thinking about and discussing politics. Rather, they are motivated reasoners who seek out congenial sources of information and defend their attitudes and beliefs when challenged, and as a consequence they tend to polarize in the face of both confirming and disconfirming information. This article reviews motivated reasoning research and con-siders the implications of motivated reasoning for rational public opinion. As we illustrate our theory of motivated reasoning, we provide examples of how cognitive biases influence a wide range of health- related attitudes, from broad, national decisions about health reform to individual decisions about caffeine consumption and smoking.

50|$|In {{order to}} access the {{underground}} workings, five adits were constructed. Two were above {{the level of the}} main mill, and were connected to it by a <b>balanced</b> <b>incline.</b> A third adit was constructed at mill level. As the quarry developed, a further two adits were excavated {{to the north of the}} mill, and as these were below the mill level, an uphaulage incline was necessary to raise the slates for processing. This was constructed beside the original exit incline to Cwm Orthin. In the final days of operation, a rope haulage system was used to move the rock from the underground chambers to the foot of the incline. Wrysgan, like most of the slate quarries in the Blaenau Ffestiniog region, was excavated as a series of chambers, will pillars of rock left between them to support the mountain above them. While the chambers in many quarries were 50 ft wide, with pillars of 30 ft, some of the chambers at Wrysgan were exceptionally wide, at 130 ft, with only 50 ft of rock left to support the overburden.|$|R
60|$|One of {{the great}} {{newspapers}} the other day invited the prominent American authors to speak their minds upon {{a point in the}} theory and practice of fiction which had already vexed some of them. It was the question of how much or how little the American novel ought to deal with certain facts of life which are not usually talked of before young people, and especially young ladies. Of course the question was not decided, and I forget just how far the <b>balance</b> <b>inclined</b> in favor of a larger freedom in the matter. But it certainly inclined that way; one or two writers of the sex which is somehow supposed to have purity in its keeping (as if purity were a thing that did not practically concern the other sex, preoccupied with serious affairs) gave it a rather vigorous tilt to that side. In view of this fact it would not be the part of prudence to make an effort to dress the balance; and indeed I do not know that I was going to make any such effort. But there are some things to say, around and about the subject, which I should like to have some one else say, and which I may myself possibly be safe in suggesting.|$|R
6000|$|And yet, on the whole, my <b>balance</b> <b>inclines</b> towards Richardson, though I {{dare say}} I am {{one in a}} hundred in {{thinking}} so. First of all, beyond anything I may have already urged, he had the supreme credit of having been the first. Surely the originator should have a higher place than the imitator, even if in imitating he should also improve and amplify. It is Richardson and not Fielding who {{is the father of}} the English novel, the man who first saw that without romantic gallantry, and without bizarre imaginings, enthralling stories may be made from everyday life, told in everyday language. This was his great new departure. So entirely was Fielding his imitator, or rather perhaps his parodist, that with supreme audacity (some would say brazen impudence) he used poor Richardson's own characters, taken from [...] "Pamela," [...] in his own first novel, [...] "Joseph Andrews," [...] and used them too for the unkind purpose of ridiculing them. As a matter of literary ethics, it is as if Thackeray wrote a novel bringing in Pickwick and Sam Weller in order to show what faulty characters these were. It is no wonder that even the gentle little printer grew wroth, and alluded to his rival as a somewhat unscrupulous man.|$|R
50|$|Around 1850, a new company, the Wrysgan Slate and Slab Quarries Co Ltd was incorporated, and {{completed}} an incline soon afterwards. Boyd {{suggests that this}} was the incline that connects to the Ffestiniog Railway, and was built at a cost of £5,000. Richards suggests that it was down into Cwm Orthin, and that it was a <b>balanced</b> <b>incline,</b> with a pack horse track running from the bottom, for which there is clear archaeological evidence. A mill for the processing of the rock was constructed in 1854, and in 1865 a second mill was built at a lower level. It was equipped with 18 saws, 20 dressers and 2 planers. The feature for which the quarry is best known, a spectacular incline which descended 600 ft down to the Ffestiniog Railway, and which passed through a tunnel towards the top, was completed in 1872. The shape of the incline was a catenary, the same shape as a rope suspended between the end points would take, as was the main incline at the nearby Rhosydd Quarry, but the foot of the incline was too shallow to allow it to be fully self-acting, and a stationary steam engine was installed to raise the empty wagons up to the quarry.|$|R
60|$|We {{dismounted}} at the station, {{walked a}} few rods eastward through a little cotton-field, and found ourselves {{at the door}} of Hotel Diomed, where we took breakfast for a number of sesterces which I am sure it would have made an ancient Pompeian stir in his urn to think of paying. But in Italy one learns the chief Italian virtue, patience, and we paid our account with the utmost good nature. There was compensation in store for us, and the guide whom we found at the gate leading up the little hill to Pompeii <b>inclined</b> the disturbed <b>balance</b> in favor of our happiness. He was a Roman, spoke Italian that Beatrice might have addressed to Dante, and was numbered Twenty-six. I suppose it is known that the present Italian Government forbids people to be pillaged in any way on its premises, and that the property of the State is no longer the traffic of custodians and their pitiless race. At Pompeii each person pays two francs for admission, and is rigorously forbidden by recurrent sign-boards to offer money to the guides. Ventisei (as we shall call him) himself pointed out one of these notices in English, and did his duty faithfully without asking or receiving fees in money. He was a soldier, like all the other guides, and was a most intelligent, obliging fellow, with a self-respect and dignity worthy of one of our own volunteer soldiers.|$|R
5000|$|Pettigrew had to {{overcome}} a number of obstacles {{in the construction of}} the tramway extension. Blocking the planned route were 2 ridges to the east of the original inland terminus and a third ridge which led into [...] "the hollow" [...] (or Broutha Scrub). To overcome the first 2 ridges, Pettigrew cut 2 steep-sided passes through them and filled the gully between them with the sand removed from the cuts, to ensure a gentle gradient. This formation was the only substantial earthworks carried out by Pettigrew on the route of the railway. The third ridge rose steeply over 200 ft to a height of 484 ft, followed by a descent of 182 ft into Thannae Scrub. After persistent survey work, Pettigrew decided on 20 November 1876 to abandon the attempt to survey a conventional line down into the Broutha Scrub and opted for a <b>balanced</b> <b>incline</b> tramway. This entailed positioning a stationary winding engine on the top of the ridge. The tramway track came up the ridge on a side cut, crossed it and ran down into the Broutha Scrub on an embankment. A loaded wagon was kept on top of the ridge at all times so that [...] "the effort of raising the loaded wagons, one at a time, was counter-balanced by the weight of the descending wagon", creating 2 isolated systems for locomotive purposes. The [...] "Mary Ann" [...] was used within Broutha Scrub to haul loaded wagons to the foot of the ridge, and the [...] "Dundathu" [...] took them from the other side of the ridge to the coast. The railway line was completed to its final inland terminus past Broutha Scrub in 1878.|$|R
