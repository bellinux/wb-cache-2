25|$|The {{details of}} what {{followed}} during the students' clash with the police vary. According to police reports, the police chased the students because they had hijacked three buses and attempted to drive them off {{to carry out the}} protests and then return to their college. Members of the student union, however, stated that they had been protesting and were hitchhiking when they clashed with the police. As the buses sped away and the chase ensued, the police opened fire on the vehicles. Two students were killed in one of the buses, while some fled into the surrounding hills. Roughly three hours later, escaped students returned to the scene to speak with reporters. In a related incident, unidentified gunmen fired at a bus carrying players from a local soccer team, which they had presumably mistaken for one of the buses that picked up the student protestors. Bullets struck the bus and hit two taxis. The bus driver, a football player, and a woman inside one of the taxis were killed. The next morning, the authorities discovered the corpse of a student, Julio César Mondragón, who had attempted to run away during the gunfire. <b>His</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>had</b> been gouged out and the skin of his face flayed to a bare skull. In total, 6 people were killed and 25 wounded.|$|E
500|$|Hubbard's war {{service has}} great {{significance}} in the history and mythology of the Church of Scientology, as {{he is said to}} have cured himself through techniques that would later underpin Scientology and Dianetics. According to Moulton, Hubbard told him that he had been machine-gunned in the back near the Dutch East Indies. Hubbard asserted that <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>had</b> been damaged as well, either [...] "by the flash of a large-caliber gun" [...] or when he had [...] "a bomb go off in my face". Scientology texts say that he returned from the war [...] "linded with injured optic nerves, and lame with physical injuries to hip and back" [...] and was twice pronounced dead.|$|E
500|$|Thomas Moulton, Hubbard's {{executive}} {{officer on the}} USS PC-815, testified in 1984 that Hubbard had {{said that he had}} been shot in the Dutch East Indies, and that on another occasion Hubbard had told him that <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>had</b> been damaged by the flash of a large-caliber gun. Hubbard himself told Scientologists in a taped lecture that he had suffered eye injuries after having had [...] "a bomb go off in my face." [...] He told Robert Heinlein, the science fiction writer, that [...] "both of his feet had been broken (drumhead-type injury) when his last ship was bombed." [...] According to Heinlein, Hubbard said that he [...] "had had a busy war – sunk four times and wounded again and again". Hubbard was said to have been [...] "twice been pronounced dead" [...] and to have spent a year in a naval hospital which he [...] "utilized in the study of endocrine substances and protein". The techniques that he developed [...] "made possible not only his own recovery from injury, but helped other servicemen to regain their health". On another occasion, Hubbard said that he had been hospitalized because [...] "I was utterly exhausted. I'd just been in combat theater after combat theater, you see, with no rest, no nothing between." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{second of}} the miracles {{attributed}} to her involves Phil McCord of Terre Haute, Indiana, and occurred in January 2001. McCord, who had worked in facilities management for the Sisters of Providence, stopped by the Church of the Immaculate Conception on the grounds and was drawn in by music from the pipe organ there. [...] While in the church he felt compelled to pray to Guérin, asking for strength to undergo a medical operation for his failing eyesight, as <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>had</b> deteriorated to legally blind status: 20-800 in one eye and 20-1000 in the other. After praying, he went home. When he awoke the next morning, his vision had returned to 20-20, and his eye now needed only laser treatment to remove old tissue.|$|E
