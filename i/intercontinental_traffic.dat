40|$|Nuclear {{power systems}} will be {{required}} to provide much greater power levels for both civilian and defense space activities in the future than an currently needed. Limitations on the amount of usable power from radioisotope thermal generators and the limited availability of radioisotope heat source materials lead directly to the conclusion that nuclear power reactors will be needed to enhance the exploration of the solar system as well as to provide for an adequate defense. Lunar bases and travel to the Martian surface will be greatly enhanced by the use of high levels of nuclear power. Space based radar systems requiring many kilowatts of electrical power can provide <b>intercontinental</b> airline <b>traffic</b> control and defense early warning systems. Since the, figure of merit used in defining any space power system is the specific power, the decrease in die mass of any reactor system component will yield a tremendous benefit to the overall system performance.

Composite materials which combine the high strength, flexibility, and low mass characteristics of Si% based fibers with the attractive compatibility and heat transfer features of metallic foils, have been proposed for use m a number of space radiator applications. Thus, the weave of the fabric and the high strength capability of the individual fibers are combined with the high conductivity and chemical stability of a metallic liner to provide a light weight, flexible alternative to heavy, rigid, metallic radiator structural containers. The primary focus of this investigation revolves around two applications of the fabric composite materials, notably a fabric heat pipe radiator design and the Bubble Membrane Radiator concept...|$|R

40|$|This paper aims to {{estimate}} the impact that the London Heathrow development constraints have on the other airports in the area. Our hypothesis is that lower traffic in London Heathrow due to its limitations induces higher than expected growth in the other airports, and vice versa. To that purpose, this paper introduces a two-stage innovative methodology {{to estimate}} this phenomenon that we called "spillover effect". We test this methodology on passenger traffic from 1990 to 2007, separating <b>intercontinental</b> from European <b>traffic,</b> the latter being also influenced by low-cost expansions. In the intercontinental case, preliminary {{results show that the}} highest spillover effect is that between London Heathrow and Gatwick, as one would expect. Interestingly, we also find a significant spillover effect between Heathrow and Manchester, proving that the impact of the Heathrow development constraints could be felt even further away from the London area. In the case of European traffic, after controlling for the low-cost growth at the other airports of the London area, we do not find any significant spillover effect. The main reason is that since low-cost carriers do not operate at Heathrow, its limitations could not affect their development in other airports...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, {{with the}} {{development}} of the modern Telecom systems, the structure of World interaction has become more interconnected and complex. The extraordinary revolution brought by the Internet era deeply modified the socio-economic interactions. The understanding of those changes requires new methods and approaches. In particular, transfers of information, that does not require face-to-face interaction, could be considered as flows carried by the global telecommunication network. Therefore, our aim is to disentangle the structural characteristics of these flows among countries, with particular regard to features of the Internet backbone. In order to disentangle the structural characteristics of the Internet infrastructure, we examine the Submarine Cable System. Our analysis represents a step forward in the understanding of this particular infrastructure. Therefore, we study the network structure among countries that proxies the information flows carried by those cables. Indeed, the Submarine Cable System is the biggest component of the Internet backbone. This infrastructure is made of a massive network of fiber optic cables that lies deep under the seas. Nowadays modern cables use optical fiber technology to carry digital data, which include telephone, Internet and private data traffic. The Submarine Cable System is part of an integrated network of different infrastructures that connect the world. For example, the other relevant components of this integrated network are satellites and radio frequency connections. Submarine cables are faster and cheaper than satellites: modern fiber optic can transmit information at 99. 7 % the speed of light, and do not have problems of latency and bit loss that characterise satellite transmissions. For these reasons, Submarine Cable System represents the biggest component of long distance information flows. Moreover, the Submarine Cable System carries over 97 % of <b>intercontinental</b> data <b>traffic.</b> Indeed the capacity used in the Submarine Cable System accounts for the 72 % to Internet data, for the 27 % to private networks owned by companies, and for only 1 % to telephone calls. In our view, given these characteristics we consider cables capacity as a measure of information flows among countries, with particular regard to the Internet traffic. In our analysis we use a dataset in gravity form, re-constructed from Google Tables. The data represent the network of Submarine Cable System, in which nodes are countries and links are cables with their specific capacity (Tb/s). The work can be decomposed in three phases: an econometric analysis on four different representation of the Submarine Cable System, multi-layer comparison between Submarine Cable System and Cargo Ship movements (year 2007), and a layer comparison between the Cables and Air Flows (year 2012). In the phase devoted to the econometric analysis, we study the existence of higher-order properties, unrelated to network characteristics, as country size, income, bilateral relationships, etc. The first econometric analysis uses data on cable routing from 1989 to 2012. Each observation represents at least one cable construction (with its capacity) in a year between two countries. The second investigation considers all the possible combinations of countries in cable routing from 1989 to 2012. Moreover, to offer a complete picture of the infrastructure evolution, the employed configuration of the data accounts also for the possibility of not having a cable routing in a year. In this perspective we can estimate the probability of a cable routing to appear. The last two econometric investigations, take into account the two different layers (2007 and 2012). Therefore each layer represents two different states of the system. Indeed in every layer, the observations represent the existence, or not, of cable connections (with cumulative capacity) between two countries. This allows to estimate the probability to have connections in the particular year. In the other two phases, we perform the multi-layer network analysis. Therefore we compare the network of Submarine Cables database with two other networks. The first comparison, for layer 2007, is done with respect to the network of cargo ship movements that, here, can be considered as a proxy of international trade. Indeed cargo-ship network accounts for up to 90 % of the international exchange of goods (Woolley-Meza et al., 2011). This comparison aims to understand if trade relations between two countries are linked to the need of more communication channels. Are trade flows able to influence the development of Telecom infrastructure? Indeed, since cargo movements may have geographical constraint similar to submarine cables, this may evidence which country has a strategic position. The second comparison on layer 2012, instead, employs the air transportation database. The worldwide air transportation network supports the traffic of over three billion passengers travelling between more than 4000 airports on more than 50 million flights in a year (Woolley-Meza et al., 2011). Because, in principle, the air network does not have the geographical constraints of submarine cables and cargo-ships, this network is used to measure those constraints. Indeed, Notwithstanding the wide use of Submarine cables, this characteristic may jeopardize the possibility for some countries to have good and cheap access to the Internet. On the other side, people movements could be correlated with the relative information flows among countries. Therefore this comparison aims to disentangle this two features of the infrastructure. The choice of this two layer years arise from data availability for cargo ship (year 2007) and air transportation (year 2012). Despite the problem of data availability, this two layers are able to capture the maturity of the Submarine Cable System. In conclusion the network of Submarine Cables among countries is characterized by a large heterogeneity and by the presence of persistent inequalities in countries connectivity. These observed characteristics are, therefore, difficult to disentangle using standard econometrics techniques. Our study of the network structure of long distance information flows, carried by the submarine fiber optic cables, offers a first picture about the complexity of global communication flows. The market structure and the infrastructural design, in our view, play a fundamental role in communication patterns. On the other hand, the empirical analysis of its structure among countries may figure out some stylised facts on the global economy. In conclusion, this empirical work points out the need of more attention for what concerns countries accessibility to modern telecommunication systems. Since a reliable and fast access to the internet telecommunication system is necessary for the development of low income countries, their peripheral position in the network may constitute a serious constraint to their chances of a better future...|$|R

Since these flights sometimes carried Norwegian and Danish refugees the airport became of interest for German spies, and two Swedish Douglas DC-3 that had taken off from Bromma were shot down by the Germans during the war. After the war the airport flourished, two noted airlines that operated from the airport were Aktiebolaget Aerotransport (ABA) which subsequently became the Swedish partner in Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) and Linjeflyg (the Swedish main domestic airline which was later acquired by SAS).

40|$|Background: The {{prevalence}} of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax malaria was {{very high in}} Corsica just before the Second World War. The last outbreak was in 1972 {{and the most recent}} indigenous case was in 2006. Results: Analysis of historical data shows that anopheline vectors were abundant. Recent surveys demonstrated that potential vectors are still present in Corsica, despite the likely disappearance of Anopheles sacharovi. Moreover, P. falciparum can develop experimentally into these mosquitoes, notably Anopheles labranchiae, which is locally abundant, and parasites are regularly introduced into the island. Discussion, Conclusions: The presence of vectors, the introduction of parasites and the conducive climate raise questions about the possibility of malaria re-emerging and becoming re-established in Corsica. Analysis of historic and current parasitological and entomological data shows that the current theoretical risk of indigenous cases or malaria foci is negligible, particularly since there is very little contact between humans and Anopheles mosquitoes, Plasmodium carriers are reliably treated and there is a widespread vector control on the island.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to reveal and analyse the recent network extension activities of Low Cost Carriers (LCCs) in European countries. The first wave of introducing new routes in Europe took place from about 2002 to 2008 when LCCs had entered the market and created new services on routes, often bypassing established routes. While the years from 2008 to 2013 showed little growth in LCC networks, more new routes have been introduced since then. Quite in contrast to the first wave the second wave is characterized by new routes from major airports, often in direct competition with other carriers, and by both European and inter-continental routes. In addition, new LCC routes are introduced on short-haul routes by replacing Full Service Network Carrier (FSNC) routes. The analysis, which is based on data of OAG (e. g. routes, flights) and Sabre ADI (passenger demand), shows the network changes by market and airline type over the last years and the demand growth in general and on selected routes, and thus reveals that passengers prefer LCC services in European markets more than FSNC services. LCCs have opened in Europe many more new routes in 2016 than FSNCs did. Ryanair and EasyJet, the two biggest LCCs of Europe, have added over 300 new routes, and most of the new routes opened in Europe are LCC routes. The number of intercontinental LCC routes alone has almost doubled from 20 to 38 routes. The paper is supposed to contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the current trend in air transport in Europe: LCCs continue to develop their networks with a new effort to directly compete with FSNCs, both in European and <b>intercontinental</b> <b>traffic,</b> while FSNCs adapt their business model and participate in the LCC business by setting up their own LCC subsidiaries...|$|E
