5|$|A {{more radical}} {{development}} was the synthesis in 2006 of bis(diisopropylamino)cyclopropenylidene by Bertrand's group. In this compound, which is stable at room temperature, the carbene atom {{is connected to}} two carbon atoms, in a three-member ring that retains the aromaticity and geometry of the cyclopropenylidene ring. This example demonstrated {{that the presence of}} heteroatoms next to the carbene <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessary</b> for stability, either.|$|E
5|$|Alastair Hudson {{has also}} argued that the fraud {{argument}} is significantly flawed.

5|$|BLEU’s {{output is}} always a number between 0 and 1. This value {{indicates}} how similar the candidate text is to the reference texts, with values closer to 1 representing more similar texts.

For this reason, it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessary</b> to attain a score of 1.

5|$|In most cases, {{medication}} for tics <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessary.</b> Education {{is an important}} part of any treatment plan, and explanation and reassurance alone are often sufficient treatment. Many individuals with Tourette's go undiagnosed or never seek medical care. Among those who are seen in specialty clinics, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) are present at higher rates. These co-occurring diagnoses often cause more impairment to the individual than the tics; hence, it is important to correctly identify associated conditions and treat them.|$|E
5|$|Nearly {{every action}} (or lack thereof) affects how the player is judged by their followers: the player {{may be seen}} as a good god, an evil one, or {{in-between}} the two. The land, interface (including the hand), and music change according to that alignment. A good god's temple is brightly coloured, while an evil god's is designed to look intimidating. It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessary</b> to consistently perform acts of either alignment and a mixture of the two can be used to stay neutral. The player has two advisors, one good and the other evil, who try to persuade the player to do things their according to their alignment.|$|E
5|$|Males’ {{differential}} {{recognition of}} local and nonlocal songs has been studied in two populations: one in the northern United States (New Hampshire) {{and the other in}} the southern United States (North Carolina). An asymmetry of response has been found between the two populations. The northern black-throated blue warbler responds strongly to local songs but relatively weakly to the song of southern warblers. In contrast, a warbler from the south responds equally to songs from both the north and the south. A potential explanation of this asymmetry is the difference in female preference between the northern and southern black-throated blue warblers. Females from the north are less likely to mate with a “heterospecific” male from the south; therefore it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessary</b> for a northern male to respond strongly to the song of a southern challenger. It is possible that a barrier to gene flow from south to north exists while a barrier to the reverse does not. Therefore, female choice of male songs is likely {{to play a role in}} gene flow and reproductive isolation, which may eventually lead to diversification.|$|E

5|$|Reformed Christians {{believe that}} {{immersion}} <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessary</b> for baptism to be properly performed, but that pouring or sprinkling are acceptable. Sprinkling {{is said to}} symbolize the sprinkling of the blood of Christ {{for the removal of}} the guilt of sin. Only ordained ministers are permitted to administer baptism in Reformed churches, contrary to the allowance for emergency baptism by midwives in Roman Catholic churches, though baptisms performed by non-ministers are generally considered valid. Reformed churches, while rejecting the baptismal ceremonies of the Roman Catholic church (such as the use of chrism, salt, and insufflation), accept the validity of baptisms performed with them on the basis that the substance of baptism remains. They do not rebaptize someone who has been baptized using these ceremonies because baptism is never to be repeated.|$|E
5|$|Regardless of the {{political}} relationship between Æthelberht and the Franks, there is abundant evidence of strong connections across the English Channel. There was a luxury trade between Kent and the Franks, and burial artefacts found include clothing, drink, and weapons that reflect Frankish cultural influence. The Kentish burials have a greater range of imported goods {{than those of the}} neighbouring Anglo-Saxon regions, which is not surprising given Kent's easier access to trade across the English Channel. In addition, the grave goods are both richer and more numerous in Kentish graves, implying that material wealth was derived from that trade. Frankish influences also may be detected in the social and agrarian organization of Kent. Other cultural influences may be seen in the burials as well, so it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessary</b> to presume that there was direct settlement by the Franks in Kent.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} {{of sexual activity}} between women as necessary to define a lesbian or a relationship continues to be debated. According to feminist writer Naomi McCormick, women's sexuality is constructed by men, whose primary indicator of lesbian sexual orientation is sexual experience with other women. The same indicator <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessary</b> to identify a woman as heterosexual, however. McCormick states that emotional, mental, and ideological connections between women are as important or {{more so than the}} genital. Nonetheless, in the 1980s, a significant movement rejected the desexualization of lesbianism by cultural feminists, causing a heated controversy called the feminist sex wars. Butch and femme roles returned, although not as strictly followed {{as they were in the}} 1950s. They became a mode of chosen sexual self-expression for some women in the 1990s. Once again, women felt safer claiming to be more sexually adventurous, and sexual flexibility became more accepted.|$|E

5|$|Three main {{modalities}} of RRT are available: hemodialysis, continuous hemofiltration and peritoneal dialysis. The former two require {{access to}} the bloodstream (a dialysis catheter), while peritoneal dialysis is achieved by instilling fluid into the abdominal cavity and later draining it. Hemodialysis, which is normally done {{several times a week}} in chronic kidney disease, is often required on a daily basis in rhabdomyolysis. Its advantage over continuous hemofiltration is that one machine can be used multiple times a day, and that continuous administration of anticoagulant drugs <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessary.</b> Hemofiltration is more effective at removing large molecules from the bloodstream, such as myoglobin, but this does not seem to confer any particular benefit. Peritoneal dialysis may be difficult to administer in someone with severe abdominal injury, and it may be less effective than the other modalities.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{the filing}} of the application, the Court may either make an order immediately, or direct that a summons for the order for review of {{detention}} be issued to enable all the parties involved to present arguments to the Court.

Unless the Court directs otherwise, it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessary</b> for the person under restraint to be brought before the Court for the hearing of the application. In addition, the Court may order that the person be released while the application is being heard. Once the Court decides to make an order for review of detention, it will direct when the person under restraint is to be brought before the court.|$|E
