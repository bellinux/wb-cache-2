5|$|Jack Roosevelt Robinson (January 31, 1919– October 24, 1972) was an American {{professional}} baseball second baseman {{who became the}} first African American to play in Major League Baseball (MLB) in the modern era. Robinson broke the baseball color line when the Brooklyn Dodgers started <b>him</b> <b>at</b> <b>first</b> base on April 15, 1947. When the Dodgers signed Robinson, they heralded the end of racial segregation in {{professional baseball}} that had relegated black players to the Negro leagues since the 1880s. Robinson {{was inducted into the}} Baseball Hall of Fame in 1962.|$|E
5|$|We made it {{very clear}} we were not doing another record for TVT. But they made it pretty clear they weren't ready to sell. So I felt like, well, I've finally got this thing going but it's dead. Flood and I had to record Broken under a {{different}} band name, because if TVT found out we were recording, they could confiscate all our shit and release it. Jimmy Iovine got involved with Interscope, and we kind of got slave-traded. It wasn't my doing. I didn't know anything about Interscope. And I was real pissed off at <b>him</b> <b>at</b> <b>first</b> because it was going from one bad situation to potentially another one. But Interscope went into it like they really wanted to know what I wanted. It was good, after I put my raving lunatic act on.|$|E

25|$|After a {{long period}} of no news, Kiyoaki is summoned to the billiard-room by his father. Tadeshina has {{attempted}} suicide, leaving a confidential note to the Marquis revealing the affair to <b>him.</b> <b>At</b> <b>first,</b> the Marquis talks calmly, but when Kiyoaki is unapologetic he beats his son with his billiard-cue. Kiyoaki is rescued by his grandmother; the household immediately starts to focus on limiting the damage.|$|E
25|$|Emelianenko started {{martial arts}} {{training}} {{at a very}} early age: his older brother, Fedor, often had to babysit him, and since Fedor did not want to miss his Sambo practice, he took young Alexander with <b>him.</b> <b>At</b> <b>first,</b> Emelianenko only observed the older kids, but soon he started mimicking their movements. He started his formal Sambo training when he joined elementary school, training with Vladimir Mihailovich Voronov.|$|E
25|$|On April 30, 2013, the {{trustees}} {{in a special}} meeting called regarding the future of President Aguillard voted to retain him as president and laid spiritual hands over <b>him.</b> <b>At</b> <b>first</b> it was not disclosed {{how many of the}} thirty-four trustees were present for the special meeting or the breakdown of the vote, but the majority declared the matter closed for further consideration. Subsequently, it was reported that board split sixteen-to-thirteen in Aguillard's favor, with five trustees absent or not voting.|$|E

25|$|Everett {{claims that}} the absence of recursion, if real, falsifies the basic {{assumption}} of modern Chomskyan linguistics. This claim is contested by many linguists, who claim that recursion has been observed in Pirahã by Everett himself, while Everett argues that those utterances that superficially seemed recursive to <b>him</b> <b>at</b> <b>first</b> were misinterpretations caused by his earlier lack of familiarity with the language. Furthermore, some linguists, including Chomsky himself, argue that even if Pirahã lacked recursion, that would have no implications for Chomskyan linguistics.|$|E
25|$|Welles {{saw that}} Du Pont was correct in stating that Charleston {{could not be}} taken by naval forces alone, but the breach {{between the two men}} was irreparable. Welles {{recalled}} the admiral on June 3, replacing <b>him</b> <b>at</b> <b>first</b> with Rear Admiral Andrew H. Foote. Foote, however, had never fully recovered from a wound he had received during the Battle of Fort Donelson, and he died before he could report to his new station. Welles therefore somewhat reluctantly turned responsibility for the naval portion of the campaign to Rear Admiral John A. Dahlgren.|$|E
25|$|In January 1878, Kipling was {{admitted}} to the United Services College at Westward Ho!, Devon, a school founded a few years earlier to prepare boys for the army. The school proved rough going for <b>him</b> <b>at</b> <b>first,</b> but later led to firm friendships and provided the setting for his schoolboy stories Stalky & Co. (1899). During his time there, Kipling also met {{and fell in love with}} Florence Garrard, who was boarding with Trix at Southsea (to which Trix had returned). Florence became the model for Maisie in Kipling's first novel The Light that Failed (1891).|$|E

25|$|Leptines {{selected}} 30 of {{his best}} ships and charged headlong into the Carthaginian line, {{while the rest of}} his fleet struggled to catch up with <b>him.</b> <b>At</b> <b>first</b> Leptines carried all before him in his sudden sally, disabling/sinking many Punic ships in a wild melee. The Carthaginians began to use their advantage in numbers, grappling the Greek ships so they could not maneuver, then boarding them. The battle turned against Leptines, and left without any reinforcements, he had to break combat and escape to the open sea with the survivors of his contingent, leaving the Greek fleet leaderless in the coming battle.|$|E
25|$|In her mid-twenties, widowed for two years, {{then left}} with a rich dower, {{she was one of}} the richest heiresses in England, and a much-sought-after wife for several {{powerful}} and ambitious men. In 1264, Simon de Montfort (second son of Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester) acquired the very valuable rights to her remarriage, but she refused to marry him and hid from <b>him,</b> <b>at</b> <b>first</b> in Breamore Priory in Hampshire, and later in Wales. Four years later, in November 1268, her marriage was granted to Edmund Crouchback, son of Henry III of England, but she did not marry him either. However her daughter Aveline (1259–1274) did marry Edmund in 1269, but she died childless four years later, aged 15.|$|E
25|$|After {{graduating from}} high school, he {{was taken by the}} Seibu Lions with the first pick of the 1998 draft, {{although}} both the Colorado Rockies and Arizona Diamondbacks of the North American Major Leagues also recruited <b>him.</b> <b>At</b> <b>first,</b> Matsuzaka stated that he wanted to play for the Yokohama BayStars, and, if he could not, he would then go to work for a company and after which choose the team of his choice through the reverse-draft (gyaku-shimei) system. That changed however, when the manager of the Lions, Osamu Higashio, an accomplished pitcher in his own right, met with Matsuzaka for dinner. At the dinner, Higashio gave Matsuzaka his winning ball for career win number 200. Matsuzaka accepted it and allowed himself to be drafted by the Lions.|$|E

25|$|Prof John James Rickard Macleod, FRS FRSE LLD (6 September 1876– 16 March 1935) was a Scottish {{biochemist}} and physiologist. He {{devoted his}} career to diverse topics in physiology and biochemistry, but was chiefly interested in carbohydrate metabolism. He is noted {{for his role in}} the discovery and isolation of insulin during his tenure as a lecturer at the University of Toronto, for which he and Frederick Banting received the 1923 Nobel prize in Physiology or Medicine. Awarding the prize to Macleod was controversial at the time, because according to Banting's version of events, Macleod's role in the discovery was negligible. It was not until decades after the events that an independent review acknowledged a far greater role than was attributed to <b>him</b> <b>at</b> <b>first.</b>|$|E
25|$|One of Boros' first {{managerial}} decisions {{resulted from}} stiff {{competition for the}} starting first baseman job. Steve Garvey began the season as the team's starting first baseman, but Boros saw the potential of rookie John Kruk. By late July, Boros concluded that Kruk deserved {{to be in the}} lineup and began alternating <b>him</b> <b>at</b> <b>first</b> base and in the outfield. Another widely publicized incident during Boros' tenure with the Padres occurred in early June 1986 when he was ejected before the first pitch in a game against the Atlanta Braves. During the exchange of lineup cards, Boros tried to hand a videotape to the umpire who had made a disputed call the previous night resulting in a triple play. Boros was ejected {{for the first time in}} 259 games as a major league manager.|$|E
25|$|In 1315, the infante Ferdinand of Majorca {{invaded the}} Morea {{and tried to}} seize the vacant princely throne in right of his wife, Isabella of Sabran. Like most of the barons and vassals of Achaea, John {{supported}} <b>him</b> <b>at</b> <b>first</b> but switched back to the legitimate heir, Princess Matilda of Hainaut, and her husband Louis of Burgundy, when they arrived in the Morea in early 1316. In the decisive Battle of Manolada on 5 July 1316, John led {{the first line of}} the loyalist army. Driven by rage over John's betrayal as well as his past mistreatment of Margaret of Villehardouin—Ferdinand's mother-in-law—the infante launched a furious assault that broke through John's line, but was held by the second line under Louis. In the resulting mêlée, Ferdinand was killed and his supporters routed. Barely a month later, Louis of Burgundy {{died at the age of}} 18, apparently of a disease. However, a pro-Catalan source asserts that Louis was poisoned by John.|$|E
50|$|Adoptionists, {{such as the}} Ebionites, {{considered}} <b>him</b> as <b>at</b> <b>first</b> {{an ordinary}} man, born to Joseph and Mary, who later became the Son of God at his baptism, his transfiguration, or his resurrection.|$|R

25|$|Thomas Scally {{stated that}} {{he was sitting in}} Alley Pond Park on Winchester Boulevard, in the borough of Queens, at dusk with a female friend when a yellow Volkswagen Beetle {{approached}} his car door to door and only three inches apart from his vehicle, which did not have its engine running. Scally kept an air gun under his seat and, as the VW approached his car, the VW driver was met with the gun pointed straight at <b>him.</b> <b>At</b> <b>first,</b> he appeared to be a light-skinned black male, but he also appeared to be wearing a stocking over his face. The driver of the VW quickly started his car and gunned it in reverse out of the parking lot. Scally chased the car to a point in Glen Oaks, Queens, where the driver jumped out and ran. He did not want to leave his female passenger to give chase, so he telephoned the Son of Sam Hot Line. Detective Richard Carroll from the Son of Sam Task Force (and Scally's former baseball coach) later told Scally that he had indeed seen the Son of Sam. Glen Oaks was later revealed to be the home of Berkowitz's sister and was close {{to the site of the}} Donna DiMaise and Joanne LoMino shootings.|$|E
25|$|The French army {{arrives at}} the {{barricade}} and demands that the students surrender ("At the Barricade—Upon These Stones"). Though Javert tells the students {{that the government will}} not attack that night ("Javert's Arrival"), Gavroche recognises him and quickly exposes him as a spy, and the students detain Javert ("Little People"). Their plan is to spark a general uprising with their act of defiance, hoping that all the people of Paris will side with them and overwhelm the army. Éponine returns to find Marius but is shot by the soldiers crossing the barricade. As Marius holds her, she assures him that she feels no pain and reveals her love for him before dying in his arms ("A Little Fall of Rain"). The students mourn this first loss of life at the barricades and resolve to fight in her name, and they carry her body away while Enjolras attempts to comfort Marius, who is heartbroken over Éponine's death. Valjean {{arrives at the}} barricade, crossing the government lines, disguised as a soldier ("Night of Anguish"), hoping that he might somehow protect Marius in the coming battle for Cosette's sake. The rebels are suspicious of <b>him</b> <b>at</b> <b>first,</b> but when the army attacks, Valjean saves Enjolras by shooting at a sniper and scaring him off, and they accept him as one of them. In return, he asks Enjolras {{to be the one to}} execute the imprisoned Javert, which Enjolras grants. But as soon as Valjean and Javert are alone, Valjean frees Javert. Javert warns Valjean that he will not give up his pursuit and rejects what he perceives as a bargain for Valjean's freedom. Valjean says there are no conditions to his release, and holds no ill-will toward Javert for doing his duty. ("The First Attack").|$|E
