5|$|Some anti-bathhouse activists {{argue that}} these {{measures}} are not enough, especially given that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>virtually</b> impossible to monitor sexual activity in a bathhouse; however, while they acknowledge that closing gay bathhouses may force some men into unsafe or illegal situations in public parks and lavatories, {{they point out that}} they may be less likely to engage in anal or multipartner sexboth of which put participants at risk for contracting STDsin such situations.|$|E
5|$|Ammianus {{is silent}} about archers on the Alamanni side. The Germans almost {{certainly}} did not have mounted archers, as this was an arm that evolved in the East and in any case, their longbows are unsuitable for use on horseback. As for the infantry, the archery capability of the Rhine Germans has traditionally been seen as negligible, due to the 6th-century writer Agathias's comment that the Franks {{did not know how}} to use bows. But this is contradicted by the archaeological record and by Ammianus himself in other parts of his account. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>virtually</b> certain that there were a significant number of Alamanni foot archers at Strasbourg.|$|E
50|$|The CZ-5000 {{synthesizer}} {{was almost}} identical to the CZ-3000, but had a built in 8 track sequencer. In most other regards, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>virtually</b> identical to the other CZ series synthesizers.|$|R

50|$|Although <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>virtually</b> ignored, <b>it</b> {{gained a}} large fanbase between 13- to 20-year-olds. It had many story lines which related well to this target market, {{including}} drinking, drugs, money, sex and virginity.|$|R
5|$|Niobium is {{slightly}} less electropositive and more compact {{than its predecessor}} in the periodic table, zirconium, whereas <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>virtually</b> identical in size to the heavier tantalum atoms, {{as a result of}} the lanthanide contraction. As a result, niobium's chemical properties are very similar to those for tantalum, which appears directly below niobium in the periodic table. Although its corrosion resistance is not as outstanding as that of tantalum, the lower price and greater availability make niobium attractive for less demanding applications, such as vat linings in chemical plants.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the two new cups, {{it is also possible}} to create custom cups. The disk can save up to a hundred tracks and up to three ghost racers per course. IGN singled out the track creator as the F-Zero X Expansion Kits strongest feature since <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>virtually</b> the same tool the designers of F-Zero X used for themselves to create the original circuits. The Car Editor offers a variety of options when creating a vehicle. Using a set of pre-existing parts, the player must balance their creations' settings and performance abilities before the machine is finished and named. The Track Editor is a detailed track creator that allows the player to design their own racing circuits. Using a cursor, the player can determine the basic layout of the track and also add points to it to create track elements such as curves and hills. Furthermore, numerous different properties like half pipes and cylinders, as well as numerous road surfaces, such as slip zones, can be added. The player can test the creation at any time and run practice laps.|$|E
5|$|In the 20th century, feminist critics {{opened up}} new {{approaches}} to Gertrude and Ophelia. New Historicist and cultural materialist critics examined the play in its historical context, attempting to piece together its original cultural environment. They focused on the gender system of early modern England, pointing to the common trinity of maid, wife, or widow, with whores outside of that stereotype. In this analysis, the essence of Hamlet is the central character's changed perception of his mother as a whore because of her failure to remain faithful to Old Hamlet. In consequence, Hamlet loses his faith in all women, treating Ophelia as if she too were a whore and dishonest with Hamlet. Ophelia, by some critics, {{can be seen as}} honest and fair; however, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>virtually</b> impossible to link these two traits, since 'fairness' is an outward trait, while 'honesty' is an inward trait.|$|E

50|$|For {{the first}} few years, MSC had no {{independent}} life; its fate was tied {{to the success of}} Meralco. Because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> primarily focused on acquiring Meralco, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>virtually</b> unknown. But after 1966, MSC's time to shine came.|$|R
5000|$|The Seventh Amendment is {{generally}} {{considered one of the}} more straightforward amendments of the Bill of Rights. Scholar Charles W. Wolfram states that it has usually [...] "been interpreted as if <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>virtually</b> a self-explanatory provision".|$|R
5|$|The {{earliest}} tree-like organisms were tree ferns, horsetails and lycophytes, {{which grew}} in {{forests in the}} Carboniferous period. The first tree may have been Wattieza, fossils {{of which have been}} found in New York State in 2007 dating back to the Middle Devonian (about 385 million years ago). Prior to this discovery, Archaeopteris was the earliest known tree. Both of these reproduced by spores rather than seeds and are considered to be links between ferns and the gymnosperms which evolved in the Triassic period. The gymnosperms include conifers, cycads, gnetales and ginkgos and these may have appeared {{as a result of a}} whole genome duplication event which took place about 319 million years ago. Ginkgophyta was once a widespread diverse group of which the only survivor is the maidenhair tree Ginkgo biloba. This is considered to be a living fossil because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>virtually</b> unchanged from the fossilised specimens found in Triassic deposits.|$|E
5|$|To {{achieve that}} result, Varrick takes care {{to prevent the}} case from going to Florida, Alisandros' {{favorite}} battleground. It is much better for them to let jurisdiction be claimed by Chicago federal judge Harry Seawright, with whom Rogan Rothberg has some ties. A bonus from Varrick's {{point of view is}} the fact that the Chicago tort lawsuit was filed by such a minor and inexperienced firm as Finley & Figg; it is confidently assumed that Karros would make short work of them in court. The case is soon expedited on Seawright's docket with Finley & Figg's claim singled out of the tort claimants and Karros takes action to have Finley & Figg's eight death cases heard separately. The specific case singled out to serve as the test case is one in which Finley & Figg represents the widow of a man who died after taking Krayoxx but he was also taking prior to his death a mixture of some ten other drugs, so that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>virtually</b> impossible to pinpoint the effect of Krayoxx.|$|E
5|$|As regards cavalry, Ammianus {{mentions}} only cataphracti in {{his account}} of the battle. But <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>virtually</b> certain that they were only part of his force. In the late army as a whole, only 15% of cavalry regiments were heavily armoured cataphracti. These were suitable for the shock charge. Two tribuni (regimental commanders) of cataphracts were reported killed at Strasbourg. There were thus at least two vexillationes of cataphracts (1,000 horse) engaged. Elsewhere in Ammianus and Zosimus it is stated that Julian had a regiment of Gentiles and a regiment of scutarii under his command. Both these were normal (semi-armoured) units that represented the majority (61%) of the late army's cavalry and were best suited to mêlée combat. There is also mention of light (unarmoured) units of equites Dalmatae (javelineers) and equites sagittarii (mounted archers). Light cavalry was used for harassment and pursuit. The likeliest scenario is that all these were present at Strasbourg, with two vexillationes each of heavy, normal and light cavalry engaged. It is thus likely that cataphracts were about a third of Julian's cavalry at Strasbourg, an unusually high proportion. In addition, Julian had his personal escort of 200 picked cavalry. These were probably a detachment from one of Constantius' scholae (elite cavalry squadrons, believed 500-strong, that served as the imperial horse guard).|$|E

50|$|The British Raj was {{dominant}} in Asia after the Battle of Assaye; following the Battle of Waterloo, the British Empire became more influential. <b>Its</b> prestige <b>was</b> only briefly dented by setbacks in India, Afghanistan and South Africa. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>virtually</b> unchallenged until 1914.|$|R
5|$|Planets {{also have}} {{varying degrees of}} axial tilt; they lie {{at an angle to}} the plane of their stars' equators. This causes the amount of light {{received}} by each hemisphere to vary over the course of its year; when the northern hemisphere points away from its star, the southern hemisphere points towards it, and vice versa. Each planet therefore has seasons, changes to the climate over the course of its year. The time at which each hemisphere points farthest or nearest from its star is known as its solstice. Each planet has two in the course of its orbit; when one hemisphere has its summer solstice, when its day is longest, the other has its winter solstice, when its day is shortest. The varying amount of light and heat received by each hemisphere creates annual changes in weather patterns for each half of the planet. Jupiter's axial tilt is very small, so its seasonal variation is minimal; Uranus, on the other hand, has an axial tilt so extreme <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>virtually</b> on its side, which means that its hemispheres are either perpetually in sunlight or perpetually in darkness around the time of its solstices. Among extrasolar planets, axial tilts are not known for certain, though most hot Jupiters are believed to have negligible to no axial tilt {{as a result of their}} proximity to their stars.|$|E

50|$|February 7, 1887, the O’Neill {{bill was}} passed which amended the Contract Labor Law of 1885. It added three major {{sections}} {{to the original}} act.

50|$|In 1880, the Natal Government Railways {{placed a}} single 0-6-0 saddle-tank {{locomotive}} in service. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>virtually</b> {{identical to the}} Harbour Board of Natal's locomotive John Milne of 1879 and was built by the same manufacturer.

25|$|For hard (Ixodid) ticks <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>virtually</b> {{impossible}} for mechanical transmission to occur {{on its own}} (i.e. without some replication), as they tend to not take multiple blood meals from different hosts in the one stage. Passing an organism between tick stages (trans-stadial transmission) seemingly requires that an organism can also replicate within the tick.|$|E
25|$|PXE {{acceptance}} since v2.1 {{has been}} ubiquitous; today <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>virtually</b> {{impossible to find}} a network card without PXE firmware on it. The availability of inexpensive Gigabit Ethernet hardware (NICs, switches, routers, etc.) has made PXE the fastest method available for installing an operating system on a client when competing against the classic CD, DVD, and USB flash drive alternatives.|$|E
25|$|Charcoal, or Makala, is inefficient {{to produce}} {{but is a}} {{preferred}} source {{of energy in the}} DRC. While <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>virtually</b> free to use fuelwood as a source of energy, charcoal increases in popularity as an energy source due to several advantages over fuelwood. Charcoal has higher calorific value per unit weight (31.8 MJ per kg) compared to fuelwood (16 MJ per kg); and charcoal is smaller and easier to store.|$|E
50|$|The {{evacuation}} of industrial enterprises started before the Germans {{had a chance}} to attack. By 20 October 1941 <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>virtually</b> completed.

25|$|A {{low-pressure}} compressor {{is often}} the air supply of choice for surface-supplied diving, as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>virtually</b> unlimited {{in the amount of}} air it can supply, provided the delivery volume and pressure are adequate for the application. A low-pressure compressor can run for tens of hours, needing only refueling, periodical filter drainage and occasional running checks, and is therefore more convenient than high-pressure storage cylinders for primary air supply.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>virtually</b> {{impossible}} to train {{a child for}} a WISC test or other gifted test. Some websites are known for publishing test questions and answers, although using these is considered illegal since it is highly confidential information.

Reviewing actual test questions can confuse children and stifles their natural thinking process, however reviewing similar style questions is a possibility.|$|E
25|$|Since a clear {{archetype}} {{for determining}} guilt does not exist, {{the criminal justice}} system must rely on rulings handed down by juries. Even after a decision has been made, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>virtually</b> impossible to know whether a jury has been correct or incorrect in freeing or accusing a defendant of a crime. Although establishing the effectiveness of juries is an arduous task, contemporary research has provided partial support for the proficiency of juries as decision makers.|$|E
