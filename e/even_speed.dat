It is a tactic often used by Kane Williamson when he bowls occasionally in limited overs format because his bowling style tends to be flatter and faster.|$|E
60|$|In all drama {{which would}} give direct {{expression}} to reverie, to the speech of the soul with itself, there is some device that checks the rapidity of dialogue. When Oedipus speaks out of the most vehement passions, he is conscious {{of the presence of}} the chorus, men before whom he must keep up appearances 'children latest born of Cadmus' line' who do not share his passion. Nobody is hurried or breathless. We listen to reports and discuss them, taking part as it were in a council of state. Nothing happens before our eyes. The dignity of Greek drama, and in a lesser degree of that of Corneille and Racine depends, as contrasted with the troubled life of Shakespearean drama, on an almost <b>even</b> <b>speed</b> of dialogue, and on a so continuous exclusion of the animation of common life, that thought remains lofty and language rich. Shakespeare, upon whose stage everything may happen, even the blinding of Gloster, and who has no formal check except what is implied in the slow, elaborate structure of blank verse, obtains time for reverie by an often encumbering Euphuism, and by such a loosening of his plot as will give his characters the leisure to look at life from without. Maeterlinck, to name the first modern of the old way who comes to mind--reaches the same end, by choosing instead of human beings persons who are as faint as a breath upon a looking-glass, symbols who can speak a language slow and heavy with dreams because their own life is but a dream. Modern drama, on the other hand, which accepts the tightness of the classic plot, while expressing life directly, has been driven to make indirect its expression of the mind, which it leaves to be inferred from some common-place sentence or gesture as we infer it in ordinary life; and this is, I believe, the cause of the perpetual disappointment of the hope imagined this hundred years that France or Spain or Germany or Scandinavia will at last produce the master we await.|$|E

50|$|This {{arrangement}} is also sometimes {{known as a}} direct shift gearbox or powershift gearbox.

50|$|Ratings systems {{rely upon}} some formulaic {{analysis}} of usually very specific yacht-design parameters such as length, sail area, displacement, and hull shape. During the 1920s {{and through the}} 1970s the Cruising Club of America established a formula by which most racing/cruising boats were designed during that period. After its descendant, the mathematically complex International Offshore Rule (IOR) of the 1970s, contributed to much decreased seaworthiness (and <b>even</b> <b>speed),</b> the simpler Performance Handicap Racing Fleet (PHRF) system was adopted. The PHRF uses only proven performance characteristics, especially theoretical sailing speed, {{as a means to}} allow dissimilar yachts—typically crewed by friends and families at clubs rather than by professional crews—to race together. Most popular family-oriented cruising sailboats will have a rating filed with a local chapter of the PHRF.|$|E
50|$|Generally, a {{dedicated}} left-turn signal is illuminated {{at the beginning}} of the green phase of the green-yellow-red-green cycle. This is called a leading turn. This allows left-turn traffic, which often consists of just a few cars, to vacate the intersection quickly before giving priority to vehicles traveling straight. This increases the throughput of left-turn traffic while reducing the number of drivers, perhaps frustrated by long waits in heavy traffic for opposing traffic to clear, attempting to make an illegal left turn on red. A dedicated left-turn signal that appears at the end of the green phase is called a lagging turn. If there is no left-turn signal, the law requires one to yield to oncoming traffic and turn when the intersection is clear and it is safe to do so. In the U.S., many older inner-city and rural areas do not have dedicated left-turn lights, while most newer suburban areas have them. Such lights tend to decrease the overall efficiency of the intersection as it becomes congested, although it makes intersections safer by reducing the risk of head-on collisions and may <b>even</b> <b>speed</b> up through traffic, but if a significant amount of traffic is turning, {{a dedicated}} turn signal helps eliminate congestion.|$|E

40|$|There is a {{well-documented}} {{relationship between}} motorists speed and the number, respectively severity, of accidents in urban streets. Also, {{studies have shown}} that vehicle emissions can increase on streets where speed reducing measures are installed, if the driving pattern of the motorists becomes more jerky. Hence, to decrease vehicle emissions and improve traffic safety in built up areas, it is important to motivate or even enforce motorists to drive with a low and <b>even</b> <b>speed.</b> Since most motorists do not always follow the speed limits, different kinds of forcing measures, such as road humps, chicanes and chokers, are used to force motorists to drive slower. The most common of these measures is the road hump. To this date, not many studies, concerning how road humps affect the driving pattern of motorists, have been done. To be able to study the driving pattern of motorists, a method to measure speed continuously over segments of streets has been developed. With this method, speed profiles showing how mean and 85 th percentile speed vary along streets, before and after the streets were re-designed, have been produced. The analyses of these speed profiles reveal that previous studies in this area of interest, have underestimated how much motorists increase their speed between road humps. The analyses also show that motorists always increase their speed between road humps, even if the distance between the humps is only 20 metres. This leads to the conclusion that it is impossible, only using road humps, to make motorists drive with both low and <b>even</b> <b>speed...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{first goal}} of this thesis {{is to develop a}} non-intrusive in-situ {{efficiency}} estimation technique, which is capable of dealing with unbalanced supplies and under- or overvoltage conditions. For the purpose of this thesis, non-intrusiveness refers to electrical measurements at terminals only, with no mechanical measurements, not <b>even</b> <b>speed.</b> This requirement imposes limitations on the available data, which brings challenges to the efficiency estimation problem. To have the lowest possible intrusion level, only two line voltages and currents are allowed to be measured, and all the required information, such as input and output power, speed, temperature, and the motor parameters, must be calculated or estimated solely based on these measurements. The second {{goal of this}} thesis is to develop a simple method for full load efficiency estimation from no-load uncoupled testing, which can be used in refurbishment centers to estimate the efficiency of induction machines without performing expensive dynamometer testing. ...|$|E
