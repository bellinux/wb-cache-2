5|$|Within a {{short time}} after the 1888 Act, Worcestershire's {{northern}} external boundaries began to alter (See Fig 3). The district of Balsall Heath, which had originally constituted the most northerly part of the Parish of King's Norton, was the first area of the county {{to be added to}} the newly designated City of Birmingham on 1 October 1891. This was followed by the small island of Edvin Loach near Bromyard, which was transferred to Herefordshire in 1893. Two years following the loss of Edvin Loach, the county gained the parish of Upper Arley, which was a Staffordshire parish nearly surrounded by Worcestershire and Shropshire (See <b>Fig</b> <b>2).</b> Oldberrow parish, which was situated in the north east Worcestershire border area was transferred to Warwickshire County Council jurisdiction during 1896.|$|E

25|$|The {{necessary}} {{distribution of}} voltage along {{the series of}} dynodes is created by a voltage divider chain, as illustrated in <b>Fig.</b> <b>2.</b> In the example, the photocathode is held at a negative high voltage of order 1000V, while the anode {{is very close to}} ground potential. The capacitors across the final few dynodes act as local reservoirs of charge to help maintain the voltage on the dynodes while electron avalanches propagate through the tube. Many variations of design are used in practice; the design shown is merely illustrative.|$|E
25|$|No truly smooth {{surfaces}} really exist, {{and surface}} imperfections are visible under a microscope. As a result, when two bodies are pressed together, contact is only {{performed in a}} finite number of points, separated by relatively large gaps, as can be shown in <b>Fig.</b> <b>2.</b> Since the actual contact area is reduced, another resistance for heat flow exists. The gases/fluids filling these gaps may largely influence the total heat flow across the interface. The thermal conductivity of the interstitial material and its pressure are the two properties governing its influence on contact conductance.|$|E
25|$|A notable {{example of}} {{applying}} π-π interactions in supramolecular assembly is {{the synthesis of}} catenane. The major challenge for the synthesis of catenane is to interlock molecules in a controlled fashion. Stoddart and co-workers developed a series of systems utilizing the strong π-π interactions between electron-rich benzene derivatives and electron-poor pyridinium rings. Catanene was synthesized by reacting bis(pyridinium) (A), bisparaphenylene-34-crown-10 (B), and 1, 4-bis(bromomethyl)benzene C (<b>Fig.</b> <b>2).</b> The π-π interaction between A and B directed {{the formation of an}} interlocked template intermediate that was further cyclized by substitution reaction with compound C to generate the catenane product.|$|E

If both execute the same swerving maneuver they will manage to pass each other, but if they choose differing maneuvers they will collide. In the payoff matrix in <b>Fig.</b> <b>2,</b> successful passing is represented by a payoff of 10, and a collision by a payoff of 0.|$|E
25|$|A fractal {{dimension}} is an index for characterizing fractal patterns or sets by quantifying their complexity as {{a ratio of}} the change in detail to the change in scale. Several types of {{fractal dimension}} can be measured theoretically and empirically (see <b>Fig.</b> <b>2).</b> Fractal dimensions are used to characterize a broad spectrum of objects ranging from the abstract to practical phenomena, including turbulence, river networks, urban growth, human physiology, medicine, and market trends. The essential idea of fractional or fractal dimensions has a long history in mathematics that {{can be traced back to}} the 1600s, but the terms fractal and fractal dimension were coined by mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot in 1975.|$|E
25|$|The Architectural {{gear ratio}} is {{explained}} through the segmented muscle model 3 proposed by Emanuel Azizi, where a muscle segment is shown {{as a single}} muscle fiber attached to the myosepta of a Siren lacertina an aquatic salamander at a certain acute, pennation angle. The model allows segments to bulge out differently in the horizontal, and vertical direction and was {{used to calculate the}} Architectural gear ratio of each segment. Preliminary models results show that with muscle bulging, the Architectural gear ratio will increase. Different bulging conditions were studied, and shown in <b>Fig.</b> <b>2</b> The model results show the more a muscle bulges in dorsoventral height, the further the muscle fibers shorten, therefore providing a higher Architectural gear ratio.|$|E

25|$|Unlike topological dimensions, the fractal index {{can take}} non-integer values, {{indicating}} that a set fills its space qualitatively and quantitatively differently from how an ordinary geometrical set does. For instance, a curve with fractal dimension very near to 1, say 1.10, behaves quite {{like an ordinary}} line, but a curve with fractal dimension 1.9 winds convolutedly through space very nearly like a surface. Similarly, a surface with fractal dimension of 2.1 fills space very much like an ordinary surface, but one with a fractal dimension of 2.9 folds and flows to fill space rather nearly like a volume. This general relationship {{can be seen in}} the two images of fractal curves in Fig.2 and Fig. 3 – the 32-segment contour in <b>Fig.</b> <b>2,</b> convoluted and space filling, has a fractal dimension of 1.67, compared to the perceptibly less complex Koch curve in Fig. 3, which has a fractal dimension of 1.26.|$|E
25|$|The {{enlargement}} of the thoracic cavity's vertical dimension by the contraction of the diaphragm, and its two horizontal dimensions by {{the lifting of the}} front and sides of the ribs, causes the intrathoracic pressure to fall. The lungs' interiors are open to the outside air, and being elastic, therefore expand to fill the increased space. The inflow of air into the lungs occurs via the respiratory airways (<b>Fig.</b> <b>2).</b> In health these airways (starting at the nose or mouth, and ending in the microscopic dead-end sacs called alveoli) are always open, though the diameters of the various sections can be changed by the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. The alveolar air pressure is therefore always close to atmospheric air pressure (about 100kPa at sea level) at rest, with the pressure gradients that cause air to move {{in and out of the}} lungs during breathing rarely exceeding 2–3kPa.|$|E
25|$|Anthrax toxin protein {{components}} must assemble into holotoxin complexes to function. In {{order for}} LF and EF to function inside a target cell, they must localize {{to the cell}} and enter its cytoplasm. Through a series of steps, PA can translocate EF and LF into the cell (<b>Fig.</b> <b>2).</b> This process starts when the 83-kDa form of PA, called PA83, binds to an anthrax toxin receptor. There are two known homologous receptors, which bind to PA83, called tumor endothelium marker-8 (TEM8) and capillary morphogenesis protein 2 (CMG2). Then a 20 kDa fragment (PA20) is cleaved off PA83's amino terminus by membrane endoproteases from the furin family. When PA20 dissociates, the remaining receptor-bound portion of PA, called PA63, may assemble into either a heptameric or octameric ring-shaped oligomer. This ring-shaped oligomer {{is often referred to}} as the pre-pore (or pre-channel) form of PA, since later in the pathway it will become a translocase pore (or channel). The surface of the pre-pore oligomer, which was exposed upon release of the PA20 moiety, can then bind to LF and EF. The heptameric and octameric forms of the PA oligomer may then bind with up to three or four molecules of EF and/or LF, respectively. The cell then endocytoses these assembled complexes and carries them to an acidic compartment in the cell. The low pH encountered in the endosome causes the PA63 pre-channel to convert into a cation-selective channel. EF and LF are driven through the channel by a pH gradient, allowing the enzyme factors to enter the cytosol.|$|E
