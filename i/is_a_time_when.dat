5|$|In {{the early}} summer, the Jewish harvest festival of Shavuot is celebrated. Shavuot marks {{the peak of}} the new grain harvest and the {{ripening}} of the first fruits, and <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> milk was historically most abundant. To celebrate this holiday, many types of dairy foods are eaten. These include cheeses and yogurts, cheese-based pies and quiches called pashtidot, cheese blintzes, and cheesecake prepared with soft white cheese (gvina levana) or cream cheese.|$|E
5|$|Afternoon <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> {{the sun is}} {{descending}} {{from its}} daytime peak. During the afternoon, the sun moves from roughly {{the center of the}} sky to deep in the west. In late afternoon, sunlight is particularly bright and glaring, because the sun is at a low angle in the sky. The standard working time in most industrialized countries goes from the morning to the late afternoon or evening—archetypally, 9 am to 5 pm—so the latter part of this time takes place in the afternoon. Schools usually let out during the afternoon as well.|$|E
5|$|The wet, or rainy, {{season is}} the time of year, {{covering}} one or more months, when most of the average annual rainfall in a region falls. The term green season is also sometimes used as a euphemism by tourist authorities. Areas with wet seasons are dispersed across portions of the tropics and subtropics. Savanna climates and areas with monsoon regimes have wet summers and dry winters. Tropical rainforests technically do not have dry or wet seasons, since their rainfall is equally distributed through the year. Some areas with pronounced rainy seasons will see a break in rainfall mid-season when the intertropical convergence zone or monsoon trough move poleward of their location {{during the middle of the}} warm season. When the wet season occurs during the warm season, or summer, rain falls mainly during the late afternoon and early evening hours. The wet season <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> air quality improves, freshwater quality improves, and vegetation grows significantly.|$|E

25|$|Celtic Reconstructionist Pagans (or CRs) often {{celebrate}} Samhain on {{the date}} of first frost, or when {{the last of the}} harvest is in and the ground is dry enough to have a bonfire. Some follow the old tradition of building two bonfires, which celebrants and livestock then walk or dance between as a ritual of purification. For CRs, it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> the dead are especially honoured. Though CRs make offerings at all times of the year, Samhain <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> more elaborate offerings are made to specific ancestors. This may involve making a small shrine. Often there will be a meal, where a place for the dead is set at the table and they are invited to join. Traditional tales may be told and traditional songs, poems and dances performed. A western-facing door or window may be opened and a candle left burning on the windowsill to guide the dead home. Divination for the coming year is often done, whether in all solemnity or as games for the children. The more mystically inclined may also see this as a time for deeply communing with their deities, especially those seen as being particularly linked with this festival.|$|E
25|$|One major {{critique}} of youth empowerment {{is that most}} programs take a risk-focused approach. There {{has been a major}} emphasis on what is going wrong for youth in their lives rather than what goes right. This portrays young people as a problem that need to be fixed, and displays the process of development as a process of overcoming risk. This may deter youth from joining youth development programs. The risked-based model can obscure the fact that adolescence <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> young people master skills and concepts.|$|E
25|$|The admissions process usually begins {{during a}} student's {{eleventh}} grade {{when a student}} meets with a guidance counselor, selects some colleges, and perhaps visits a few campuses. The summer before twelfth grade <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> many students finalize application plans and perhaps begin writing essays. Further, they decide whether to apply by early or regular decision. International students may need to take tests showing English-language proficiency such as the TOEFL, IELTS, or PTE Academic. The twelfth grade is when applications are submitted. The CSS can be submitted by October first of the student's twelfth grade, while the FAFSA becomes available on the web after January first.|$|E

25|$|The décimas are sung {{to stock}} melodies, with {{standardized}} cuatro accompaniment patterns. About twenty such song-types are in common use. These are grouped into two broad categories, viz., seis (e.g., seis fajardeño, seis chorreao) and aguinaldo (e.g., aguinaldo orocoveño, aguinaldo cayeyano). Traditionally, the seis could accompany dancing, but this tradition has largely died out except in tourist shows and festivals. The aguinaldo is most characteristically sung during the Christmas season, when groups of revelers (parrandas) go {{from house to}} house, singing jíbaro songs and partying. The aguinaldo texts are generally not about Christmas, and also unlike Anglo-American Christmas carols, they are generally sung by a solo with the other revelers singing chorus. In general, Christmas season <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> traditional music—both seis and aguinaldo—is {{most likely to be}} heard. Fortunately, many groups of Puerto Ricans are dedicated to preserving traditional music by continued practice.|$|E

500|$|On March 13, 2006, Hayes {{announced}} that he was quitting the show because of the series' treatment of religion, saying, [...] "There is a place in this world for satire, but there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs of others begins. Religious beliefs are sacred to people, and at all times should be respected and honored. As a civil rights activist of the past 40 years, I cannot support a show that disrespects those beliefs and practices." [...] The Guardian observed that Hayes did not specifically mention Scientology in his statement. Later in an interview on CNN's Showbiz Tonight, Hayes added he did not see the episode itself, but was told about it. In a separate interview, he reportedly said regarding Parker and Stone, [...] "Guys, you have it all wrong. We're not like that. I know that's your thing, but get your information correct, because somebody might believe that shit, you know? But I understand what they're doing. I told them to take a couple of Scientology courses, and understand what we do." ...|$|E

500|$|Fire {{from the}} {{domestic}} hearth was {{under no circumstances}} given {{out of the house}} on Christmas Eve, not even to a neighbor whose fire had gone out. The reason for this prohibition, according to Čajkanović, was the belief that the Eve <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> the ancestral spirits, guardians of the family's happiness and prosperity, are especially active in this world. Christmas Eve dinner is a feast prepared in their honor, and they join the family at it. They gather on the straw spread over the floor, and on the hearth. These spirits could be removed from the family if any piece of their fire were taken away by an outsider. In people's words, fire should not be given lest the luck be taken away from the house, or for better crops, or because of bees. Referring to the latter explanation, Čajkanović argues that, in the old religion of the Serbs, the bees were regarded as pure and sacred insects, in whom ancestral spirits could dwell. The same explanation, [...] "because of bees", is also given for the aforementioned custom of putting a piece of the badnjak's first splinter in the dough for the česnica.|$|E

2500|$|The Restoration is {{an unusual}} {{historical}} period, as its literature is bounded by a specific political event: {{the restoration of the}} Stuart monarchy. It is unusual in another way, as well, for it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> the influence of that king's presence and personality permeated literary society to such an extent that, almost uniquely, literature reflects the court. The adversaries of the restoration, the Puritans and democrats and republicans, similarly respond to the peculiarities of the king and the king's personality. Therefore, a top-down view of the literary history of the Restoration has more validity than that of most literary epochs. [...] "The Restoration" [...] as a critical concept covers the duration of the effect of Charles and Charles's manner. This effect extended beyond his death, in some instances, and not as long as his life, in others.|$|E
2500|$|In November 1911, a {{group of}} Ohio Republicans {{endorsed}} Roosevelt for the party's nomination for president; the endorsers included James R. Garfield and Dan Hanna. This was notable, as the endorsement was made by leaders of President Taft's home state. Roosevelt conspicuously declined {{to make a statement}} requested by Garfield—that he flatly refuse a nomination. Soon thereafter, Roosevelt said, [...] "I am really sorry for Taft... I am sure he means well, but he means well feebly, and he does not know how! He is utterly unfit for leadership and this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> we need leadership." [...] In January 1912, Roosevelt declared [...] "if the people make a draft on me I shall not decline to serve". Later that year, Roosevelt spoke before the Constitutional Convention in Ohio, openly identifying as a progressive and endorsing progressive reforms—even endorsing popular review of state judicial decisions. In reaction to Roosevelt's proposals for popular overrule of court decisions, Taft said, [...] "Such extremists are not progressives—they are political emotionalists or neurotics".|$|E
2500|$|On March 13, 2006, a {{statement}} was issued in Hayes's name, indicating {{that he was}} asking {{to be released from}} his contract with Comedy Central, citing recent episodes which satirized religious beliefs as being intolerant.

However, the statement did not directly mention Scientology. A response from Matt Stone said that Hayes' complaints stemmed from the show's criticism of Scientology and that he [...] "has no problem – and he's cashed plenty of checks – with our show making fun of Christians, Muslims, Mormons or Jews." [...] Stone adds, [...] " [...] never heard a peep out of Isaac in any way until we did Scientology. He wants a different standard for religions other than his own, and to me, that is where intolerance and bigotry begin." [...] Stone and Parker agreed to release Hayes from his contract by his request. In 2007, Hayes said he had quit because [...] "they [...] didn't pay me enough... They weren't that nice." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 18 June Pitt heard Fitzwilliam's {{objection}} {{from the}} Duke of Portland. Pitt assured [...] "that the re-establishment of the Crown of France in such {{person of the}} family of Bourbon as shall be naturally entitled to it was the first and determined aim of the present Ministry". Pitt wished to discuss this with Fitzwilliam in person. On 23 June Fitzwilliam wrote to the Duke of Portland that he believed the government had moved to the Whig position and that [...] "for my own part I am now ready, not only to adopt the opinion that a junction should take place, as your sentiment, but to advise it as the genuine offspring of my own judgement... as much weight and sway should be given to us as possible. ... In my humble opinion, this junction will not produce half its effect if it is not opened to the world by such marks of real substantial favour and confidence {{on the part of the}} Crown towards us as will mark beyond dispute the return of weight, power and consideration to the Old Whigs...after thirty years' exclusion from patronage in the line of peerage" [...] new Whig peers should be created. He also rejected office except of [...] "going to Ireland, but...it is impossible". However the Duke of Portland and Lord Mansfield implored Fitzwilliam to accept office and when Lord Mansfield saw Fitzwilliam when he came down to London on 28 June he got Fitzwilliam [...] "to admit that if ever he was to take office this was the time". The next day Fitzwilliam met the Duke of Portland and reported that: [...] "I see little prospect of escaping office...the duke...seems so intent upon my accepting, as almost to say that he will not, if I do not—I left him last night my reasons for thinking that I should be more serviceable out of office, than in...if I find I have not persuaded him, I must submit". When Pitt met the Duke of Portland on 1 July he offered the Lord Lieutenancy of Ireland to Fitzwilliam as soon as Lord Westmoreland could be compensated for the loss of it. Therefore, on 3 July Fitzwilliam agreed to join the coalition government as Lord President of the Council for the time being, writing that day to Lady Rockingham: [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> private affection must give way to public exigency".|$|E
