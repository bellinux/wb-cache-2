5|$|Herodius– Featured in God of War comic #4, Herodius was {{a warrior}} {{from the village}} of Thera. Poseidon chose Herodius as his {{champion}} in Ares' wager. His village was stricken with a plague, cast by Poseidon so that Herodius would search for the Ambrosia. Herodius was killed by Kratos, which did not <b>go</b> <b>well</b> for Poseidon.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the revolt}} was also fuelled by a general feeling of discontent and humiliation at the {{failures}} of the Angeloi, especially in terms of foreign policy. This much is evident from the— albeit embellished— account of the eyewitness Nicholas Mesarites, whereby John Komnenos's supporters proclaimed that henceforth everything would <b>go</b> <b>well</b> for Romania, that her enemies would be vanquished, and that the kings of all the earth would come to pay homage to Constantinople.|$|E

5|$|Andrew's sketch {{leads to}} the {{identification}} of the kidnapper as Joanne Ostler (Gillian Jacobs), a MIT neurologist who was previously believed deceased. Joanne tricks Ben into helping her complete an unfinished equation by using the image of his mother, who died in the car accident.

5|$|Ethicist Tom Regan {{rejected}} Kant's {{assessment of}} the moral worth of animals on three main points: First, he rejected Kant's claim that animals are not self-conscious. He then challenged Kant's claim that animals have no intrinsic moral worth because they cannot make a moral judgment. Regan argued that, if a being's moral worth is determined by its ability to make a moral judgment, then we must regard humans who are incapable of moral thought as being equally undue moral consideration. Regan finally argued that Kant's assertion that animals exist merely {{as a means to}} an end is unsupported; the fact that animals have a life that can <b>go</b> <b>well</b> or badly suggests that, like humans, they have their own ends.|$|E

5|$|On 6 June 1930, Carol {{arrived in}} Bucharest {{and made his}} way into Parliament, where the Act of Succession 1927 was duly {{declared}} null. Thus, Carol usurped the throne from his son, becoming King Carol II. Upon hearing of Carol's return, Marie, who was abroad, was relieved. She had been growing anxious with the direction in which the country was heading and viewed Carol's return as the return of the Prodigal Son. However, as soon as she arrived in Bucharest, she became aware that things would not <b>go</b> <b>well.</b> Carol refused to accept his mother's advice to take Helen back and never sought Marie's counsel during his reign, thus making the already existing breach between mother and son complete.|$|E

5|$|Their debut studio album, Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M., was {{recorded}} over three daytime sessions in March 1964 and released in October. The album contains four original Simon compositions, {{with the remainder}} consisting of three traditional folk songs and five folk-influenced singer-songwriter numbers. Simon was adamant that they would no longer use stage names, and they adopted the name Simon & Garfunkel. Columbia set up a promotional showcase at Folk City on March 31, 1964, the duo's first public concert as Simon & Garfunkel.

5|$|After {{the very}} warm {{practice}} sessions, qualifying on Saturday was run under difficult weather conditions. Qualifying one (Q1) {{started on a}} damp track and therefore on intermediate tyres, while by Q2 the track was almost dry and slick tyres were used. In Q1 Romain Grosjean collided with the slower running HRT of Pedro de la Rosa and lost his front wing. While he succeeded in nursing the car back into the pit lane, {{he was unable to}} change his tyres and was therefore left in a disappointing 18th position on the grid. Michael Schumacher's last ever qualifying did not <b>go</b> <b>well</b> either. He took 14th position, almost half a second down on his teammate, admitting he had perhaps compromised his setup too much for an expected wet race. The McLarens were fastest all weekend and easily took the front row, with Lewis Hamilton securing his last pole position with the team. Title contenders Vettel and Alonso both struggled, taking 4th and 8th position on the grid respectively. Pastor Maldonado was handed a 10-place grid penalty for missing the weighbridge {{in the second part of}} qualifying. He dropped from sixth to 16th, moving Alonso one place up to seventh.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the race, all drivers {{at the front of the}} grid got away without {{incident}} and with no changes in position. On the outside of turn three, Nico Hülkenberg was able to get around Pastor Maldonado for sixth position. Sebastian Vettel and Felipe Massa, who both started from the rear end of the grid, made up places early in the race, running in twelfth and thirteenth by lap 9, when Vettel came into the pit lane for his first stop. The pit stop did not <b>go</b> <b>well,</b> as his car was stationary for about six seconds. Massa in turn went past Marcus Ericsson for eleventh two laps later in a wheel-to-wheel manoeuvre through turns one and two. Meanwhile, at the front, Lewis Hamilton had built a sufficient gap to second-placed Rosberg to deny Rosberg the chance to use DRS and try to overtake.|$|E
5|$|In her spare time, Veronica trails Madison out of envy. After ascertaining Tim’s password, Veronica {{finds out}} that Tim is also {{investigating}} the Dean’s suicide {{and that he was}} browsing a site named “Neptune Women’s Clinic”. Veronica visits the ministry of Bonnie’s father, Ted (Chris Ellis) as well as the clinic, although neither really help in the case. She also questions Anthony, one of the witnesses of the Dean’s death (he heard the gunshot). Returning home, Veronica is greeted by Keith, who has received a letter with images of Veronica exiting the clinic. For revenge, they visit the publisher of the photos, but it doesn’t <b>go</b> <b>well.</b> Nevertheless, she does see a picture of one of Dick’s paramours, although she was not as intimate with him as Veronica thought. In the middle of the night, Mindy O’Dell (Jaime Ray Newman) contact Keith, telling him to hurry. It turns out that Steve Botando (Richard Grieco) was trying to break in, and while he is there, Keith {{finds out that}} Cyrus was planning on sending the O’Dell son to a disciplinary school and that Mindy was at the scene of Dean O’Dell’s death.|$|E

5|$|Louis's {{campaign}} against Egypt did not <b>go</b> <b>well.</b> He successfully captured Damietta, but lost his entire army at the Battle of Al Mansurah, and was himself {{captured by the}} Egyptians. His release was eventually negotiated {{in return for a}} ransom (some of which was a loan from the Templars) and the surrender of the city of Damietta. A few years later, in 1252, Louis tried unsuccessfully to ally with the Egyptians, and then in 1253 he sought allies among both the Ismaili Assassins and the Mongols. When he saw a letter from Hethum's brother, the Armenian noble Sempad, which spoke well of the Mongols, Louis dispatched the Franciscan William of Rubruck to the Mongol court. But the Mongol leader Möngke replied with only a letter via William in 1254, asking for the King's submission to Mongol authority.|$|E
5|$|Ted (Josh Radnor) is at {{the clinic}} to remove his lower-back {{butterfly}} tattoo, where he is attracted to his doctor, Stella (Sarah Chalke). They agree {{to go to a}} movie, Plan 9 from Outer Space, but Ted does not realize Stella had brought her friends along with her, and it was not a date. At the next session, Ted suggests waiting till his ten sessions are over before asking her out, but Stella tells him she will still say no. Ted still feels that over ten weeks, she will start to like him, so decides to keep trying. Even though the first five sessions <b>go</b> <b>well,</b> Stella confirms her answer is still no. Ted decides that being nice to the receptionist, Abby (Britney Spears), would {{be a good way to}} let Stella see his good side, but instead, Abby starts to show interest in him. Upset that this didn't work, Ted tries using a self-help book he saw in Stella's clinic. When he tries talking to her about this, she reveals it isn't her book, and she detests it, while Abby confirms that Ted was reading the book in the reception.|$|E
5|$|The Senators {{first season}} in the NHL, 1917–18, did not <b>go</b> <b>well.</b> Salary squabbles delayed the home opener (on the league's first night, December 19, 1917) as players protested that their {{contracts}} were for twenty games, while the season schedule was for twenty four. Enough players were appeased that the game started, 15 minutes late, while two players Hamby Shore and Jack Darragh, stayed {{in the dressing room}} while negotiations went on. The Senators lost their home opener 7–4. The Senators lost their previous top rival, the Wanderers, after five games. The team struggled and finished in third place after {{the first half of the}} season. The club made player changes in the second half, getting Horace Merrill out of retirement and releasing Dave Ritchie. It was Shore's last season as he would die of pneumonia in October 1918. Shore's last career game was in the third-last game of the season and he was sat out for the last two games. In the end, the team placed second in the second half and missed the playoffs. Cy Denneny led the team, coming second overall in scoring in the league with 36 goals in 20 games.|$|E
