5000|$|One of {{the first}} {{successful}} mercury probe applications was the characterization of epitaxial layers grown on silicon. [...] It is critical to device performance to monitor the doping level and thickness of an <b>epitaxial</b> <b>layer.</b> Prior to the mercury probe, a sample had to undergo a metallization process, which could take hours. A mercury probe connected to capacitance-voltage doping profile instrumentation could measure an <b>epitaxial</b> <b>layer</b> {{as soon as it}} came out of the epitaxial reactor. The mercury probe formed a Schottky barrier of well-defined area that could be measured as easily as a conventional metallized contact.|$|E

The intensity of band edge emission from Si-doped <b>epitaxial</b> <b>layers</b> was approximately one order of magnitude stronger than that from undoped <b>epitaxial</b> <b>layers</b> at 300 K. It was found that nonradiative recombination in GaN <b>epitaxial</b> <b>layers</b> was suppressed by Si-doping.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of polarity control in {{molecular beam epitaxy}} (MBE) growth of GaN <b>epitaxial</b> <b>layers</b> has been investigated using N-face of bulk GaN crystal. The (6 × 6) reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) reconstruction patterns were observed from GaN <b>epitaxial</b> <b>layers</b> on high-temperature-grown buffer layers over N-face bulk GaN after cooling. On the other hand, the (2 × 2) RHEED reconstruction patterns were observed from GaN <b>epitaxial</b> <b>layers</b> on In-doped GaN <b>epitaxial</b> <b>layers</b> over N-face bulk GaN after cooling. These results suggest that N-polarity can be reversed to Ga-polarity by In doping but not by the deposition of high-temperature-grown buffer layers...|$|R
50|$|An <b>epitaxial</b> <b>layer</b> can be doped during {{deposition}} {{by adding}} impurities {{to the source}} gas, such as arsine, phosphine or diborane. The concentration of impurity in the gas phase determines its concentration in the deposited film. As in chemical vapor deposition (CVD), impurities change the deposition rate.Additionally, the high temperatures at which CVD is performed may allow dopants to diffuse into the growing layer from other layers in the wafer («out-diffusion»). Also, dopants in the source gas, liberated by evaporation or wet etching of the surface, may diffuse into the <b>epitaxial</b> <b>layer</b> («autodoping»). The dopant profiles of underlying layers change as well, however not as significantly.|$|E
50|$|Especially for {{voltages}} beyond 500 V some manufacturers, including Infineon Technologies {{with its}} CoolMOS products, {{have begun to}} use a charge compensation principle. With this technology, the resistance in the <b>epitaxial</b> <b>layer</b> as biggest contributor in high voltage MOSFETs can be reduced {{by a factor of}} greater than 5.|$|E
50|$|This {{reaction}} {{does not}} inadvertently etch the wafer, and {{takes place at}} lower temperatures than deposition from silicon tetrachloride. However, it will form a polycrystalline film unless tightly controlled, and it allows oxidizing species that leak into the reactor to contaminate the <b>epitaxial</b> <b>layer</b> with unwanted compounds such as silicon dioxide.|$|E

50|$|Micropipes {{and screw}} dislocations in <b>epitaxial</b> <b>layers</b> are {{normally}} {{derived from the}} substrates on which the epitaxy is performed. Micropipes {{are considered to be}} empty-core screw dislocations with large strain energy (i.e. they have large Burgers vector); they follow the growth direction (c-axis) in silicon carbide boules and substrates propagating into the deposited <b>epitaxial</b> <b>layers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{clocking}} of the gates, alternately {{high and}} low, will forward and reverse bias the diode that {{is provided by}} the buried channel (n-doped) and the <b>epitaxial</b> <b>layer</b> (p-doped). This will cause the CCD to deplete, near the p-n junction and will collect and move the charge packets beneath the gates—and within the channels—of the device.|$|E
50|$|The photoactive {{region of}} a CCD is, generally, an <b>epitaxial</b> <b>layer</b> of silicon. It is lightly p doped (usually with boron) and is grown upon a {{substrate}} material, often p++. In buried-channel devices, {{the type of}} design utilized in most modern CCDs, {{certain areas of the}} surface of the silicon are ion implanted with phosphorus, giving them an n-doped designation. This region defines the channel in which the photogenerated charge packets will travel. Simon Sze details the advantages of a buried-channel device:This thin layer (= 0.2-0.3 micron) is fully depleted and the accumulated photogenerated charge is kept away from the surface. This structure has the advantages of higher transfer efficiency and lower dark current, from reduced surface recombination. The penalty is smaller charge capacity, by a factor of 2-3 compared to the surface-channel CCD. The gate oxide, i.e. the capacitor dielectric, is grown on top of the <b>epitaxial</b> <b>layer</b> and substrate.|$|E
50|$|When in the OFF-state, {{the power}} MOSFET is {{equivalent}} to a PIN diode (constituted by the P+ diffusion, the N− <b>epitaxial</b> <b>layer</b> and the N+ substrate). When this highly non-symmetrical structure is reverse-biased, the space-charge region extends principally on the light-doped side, i.e. over the N− layer. This means that this layer has to withstand most of the MOSFET's OFF-state drain-to-source voltage.|$|E

50|$|For power Schottky diodes, the {{parasitic}} resistances of {{the buried}} n+ layer and the epitaxial n-type layer become important. The {{resistance of the}} <b>epitaxial</b> <b>layer</b> {{is more important than}} it is for a transistor, as the current must cross its entire thickness. However, it serves as a distributed ballasting resistor over the entire area of the junction and, under usual conditions, prevents localized thermal runaway.|$|E
5000|$|The overlayer {{is called}} an {{epitaxial}} film or <b>epitaxial</b> <b>layer.</b> The term epitaxy {{comes from the}} Greek roots epi (ἐπί), meaning [...] "above", and taxis (τάξις), meaning [...] "an ordered manner". It can be translated as [...] "arranging upon". For most technological applications, it is desired that the deposited material form a crystalline overlayer that has one well-defined orientation {{with respect to the}} substrate crystal structure (single-domain epitaxy).|$|E
5000|$|Rn is the {{resistance}} of the <b>epitaxial</b> <b>layer.</b> As the role of this layer is to sustain the blocking voltage, Rn {{is directly related to the}} voltage rating of the device. A high voltage MOSFET requires a thick, low-doped layer (i.e. highly resistive), whereas a low-voltage transistor only requires a thin layer with a higher doping level (i.e. less resistive). As a result, Rn is the main factor responsible for {{the resistance}} of high-voltage MOSFETs; ...|$|E
40|$|It is {{generally}} considered that methane is not a suitable carbon precursor for growth of silicon carbide (SiC) <b>epitaxial</b> <b>layers</b> by Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) since its use renders <b>epitaxial</b> <b>layers</b> with very high surface roughness. In this work we demonstrate that in fact SiC <b>epitaxial</b> <b>layers</b> with high-quality morphology can be grown using methane. It is shown that {{a key factor in}} obtaining high-quality material is tuning the C/Si ratio of the process gas mixture to a region where the growth is limited neither by carbon nor by silicon supplies. From the growth characteristics presented here, we argue that the reactivity of methane with the SiC surface is much higher than generally assumed in SiC CVD modeling today...|$|R

50|$|For example, indium {{phosphide}} could be grown in a reactor on a heated substrate by introducing trimethylindium ((CH3)3In) and phosphine (PH3) {{in a first}} step. The heated organic precursor molecules decompose {{in the absence of}} oxygen - pyrolysis. Pyrolysis leaves the atoms on the substrate surface in the second step. The atoms bond to the substrate surface and a new crystalline layer is grown in the last step. Formation of this <b>epitaxial</b> <b>layer</b> occurs at the substrate surface.|$|E
5000|$|The CGD {{capacitance}} {{can be seen}} as {{the connection}} in series of two elementary capacitances. The first one is the oxide capacitance (CoxD), constituted by the gate electrode, the silicon dioxide and the top of the N <b>epitaxial</b> <b>layer.</b> It has a constant value. The second capacitance (CGDj) is caused by the extension of the space-charge zone when the MOSFET is in off-state. Therefore, it is dependent upon the drain to source voltage. From this, the value of CGD is: ...|$|E
5000|$|Silicon {{epi wafers}} were first {{developed}} around 1966, and achieved commercial acceptance {{by the early}} 1980s. Methods for growing the <b>epitaxial</b> <b>layer</b> on monocrystalline silicon or other wafers include: various types of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) classified as Atmospheric pressure CVD (APCVD) or metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), as well as molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Two [...] "kerfless" [...] methods (without abrasive sawing) for separating the <b>epitaxial</b> <b>layer</b> from the substrate are called [...] "implant-cleave" [...] and [...] "stress liftoff". A method applicable when the epi-layer and substrate are the same material employs ion implantation to deposit {{a thin layer of}} crystal impurity atoms and resulting mechanical stress at the precise depth of the intended epi layer thickness. The induced localized stress provide a controlled path for crack propagation in the following cleavage step. In the dry stress lift-off process applicable when the epi-layer and substrate are suitably different materials, a controlled crack is driven by a temperature change at the epi/wafer interface purely by the thermal stresses due to the mismatch in thermal expansion between the epi layer and substrate, without the necessity for any external mechanical force or tool to aid crack propagation. It was reported that this process yields single atomic plane cleavage, reducing the need for post lift-off polishing, and allowing multiple reuses of the substrate up to 10 times.|$|E
40|$|Although it is {{well known}} that the {{interface}} relaxation plays the crucial role for the electronic properties in semiconductor <b>epitaxial</b> <b>layers,</b> there is lack of a clear definition of relationship between interfacial bond-energy variation and interface bond-nature-factor (IBNF) in <b>epitaxial</b> <b>layers</b> before and after relaxation. Here we establish an analytical method to shed light on the relationship between the IBNF and the bond-energy change, as well as the relation with band offset in <b>epitaxial</b> <b>layers</b> from the perspective of atomic-bond-relaxation consideration and continuum mechanics.

5000|$|Two main {{parameters}} govern {{both the}} breakdown voltage and the RDSon of the transistor: the doping {{level and the}} thickness of the N− <b>epitaxial</b> <b>layer.</b> The thicker the layer and the lower its doping level, the higher the breakdown voltage. On the contrary, the thinner the layer and the higher the doping level, the lower the RDSon (and therefore the lower the conduction losses of the MOSFET).

5000|$|Power MOSFETs have a {{different}} structure from the lateral MOSFET: as with most power devices, their structure is vertical and not planar. In a planar structure, the current and breakdown voltage ratings are both functions of the channel dimensions (respectively width and length of the channel), resulting in inefficient use of the [...] "silicon estate". With a vertical structure, the voltage rating of the transistor {{is a function of}} the doping and thickness of the N <b>epitaxial</b> <b>layer</b> (see cross section), while the current rating {{is a function of the}} channel width.
