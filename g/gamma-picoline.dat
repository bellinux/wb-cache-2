40|$|The complex [PdMe(SMe 2) (mu-I) ] 2 is a {{suitable}} reagent for {{the synthesis of}} methylpalladium(II) cationic complexes. Addition of 2, 2 ’: 6 ’, 2 ”-terpyridyl or 2, 2 ’-bipyridyl to [PdMe(SMe 2) (mu-I) ] 2 gives [PdMe(terpy) ]I or PdIMe(bpy), respectively, and the latter complex reacts with AgBF 4 in acetonitrile to give [PdMe(bpy) (NCMe) ]BF 4. Addition of bpy and AgBF 4 to [PdMe(SMe 2) (mu-I) ] 2 in acetone, followed by filtration and addition of <b>gamma-picoline</b> or acctonitrile to the filtrate, gives]PdMe(bpy) (gamma-pic) ]BF 4 or [PdMe(bpy) (SMe 2) ]BF 4, respectively. The crystal structure of [PdMe(bpy) (gamma-pic) ]BF 4 has been determined and shows that the cation [PdMe(bpy) (gamma-pic) ]+ has square planar coordination at palladium(II) and the <b>gamma-picoline</b> plane forms an angle of 62. 1 ° with the ‘PdCN 3 ’ coordination plane...|$|E
40|$|The first {{protocol}} for a direct Heck olefination of aromatic carboxylic acids has been developed. By treatment with commercially available di-tert-butyl dicarbonate, the carboxylic acids are converted in situ into the mixed anhydrides, {{which in the}} presence of a palladium catalyst react with olefins to give styrene derivatives. As by-products, only volatile CO and CO 2, along with tert-butanol are formed, making the work-up of the reaction products particuarly easy. A mixture of PdCl 2, LiCl and <b>gamma-picoline</b> was identified to be the most effective catalyst system...|$|E
40|$|Reaction of [(eta- 6 -p-cymene) RuCl(L star) ] with AgClO 4 in Me 2 CO gives a {{perchlorate}} complex {{which on}} subsequent treatment with PPh 3, <b>gamma-picoline</b> or Cl- yields adducts showing {{that there can}} be retention as well as inversion of configuration at the metal centre. The (R) Ru,(S) C absolute configurations of the chiral centres in the triphenylphosphine adduct have been established by an X-ray diffraction study [HL star, (S) -alpha-methylbenzylsalicylaldimine]. The CD spectral study reveals that there is an inversion of configuration during formation of the PPh 3 adduct...|$|E
40|$|The {{pyridazine}} complex [Me 2 Pd(pyd) ]n, stable as a solid on storage at ca. - 20 °C {{and obtained}} on reaction of trans-PdCl 2 (SMe 2) 2 with methyllithium and pyridazine at low temperature, {{is an excellent}} precursor for the synthesis of Me 2 Pd(II) and Me 3 Pd(IV) complexes under mild conditions, in particular for ligands sensitive to MeLi. Similarly, [MePd(SMe 2) (mu-I) ] 2 is a suitable precursor for the synthesis of neutral and cationic MePd(II) complexes, including [MePd(2, 2 ’-bipyridyl) (<b>gamma-picoline)</b> ]BF 4, which has been characterized by X-ray crystallography...|$|E

The molecular structure of the vinylpyridine adduct has been determined by X-ray crystallography. The crystal belongs to the monoclinic space group P 2 (1) with the following cell dimensions for the C 31 H 33 CIN 2 O 5 Ru(M = 650. 11) : a = 10. 890 (2) Angstrom, b = 22. 295 (9) Angstrom, c = 12. 930 (2) Angstrom, beta = 109. 30 (2) degrees(3), V = 2964 (l) Angstrom 3, Z = 4; D-c = 1. 457 g cm(- 3), lambda(Mo-K alpha) = 0. 7107 Angstrom; mu(Mo-K alpha) = 6. 61 cm(- 1); T = 293 K; R = 0. 0359 (wR(2) = 0. 0981) for 4819 reflections with I > 2 sigma(I). The structure shows the non-bonding nature of the double bond of the 4 -vinylpyridine ligand in the complex in which the metal is bonded to the eta(6) -p-cymene, the N, O-bidentate chelating schiff-base and the unidentate N-donor pyridine ligands...|$|E
40|$|Reaction of {{hydrated}} copper(II) 2 -chloro-benzoate with beta-/gamma-picoline in methanol: water mixture (4 : 1 v/v) yielded polymeric [cu(2 -chlorobenzoate) (2) (beta-picoline) (2) (mu-H 2 O) ](n); 1 and monomeric [Cu(2 -chlorobenzoate) (2) (<b>gamma-picoline)</b> (2) (H 2 O) ]; 2. The newly synthesized complexes {{have been}} characterized by elemental analyses, FT-IR spectroscopy, UV-Visible spectroscopy, TGA and single crystal X-ray structure determination. X-ray crystallographic analysis revealed that both complexes crystallize in the monoclinic crystal system with space group and unit cell dimensions: (C 2 /c; a = 51. 71 angstrom, b = 10. 58 angstrom, c = 10. 02 angstrom and beta = 100. 5 degrees for 1 and P 2 (1) /c; a = 11. 81 angstrom, b = 16. 33 angstrom, c = 13. 79 angstrom and beta = 90. 77 degrees for 2. Whereas in 1 the presence of constituent and mediating water molecules running along a-axis gives rise to 1 -dimensional zig-zag polymer chains, in complex 2, the presence of square pyramidal arrangement of ligands around copper(II) center results in monomeric structure. Various non-covalent interactions like O-H [...] . O, C-H [...] . O and C-H [...] . pi have been observed to play a decisive role in the stabilization of crystal lattices in both complexes...|$|E

The substrate binding capacity of 1 has been demonstrated by the formation of one mononuclear mixed-ligand dioxidomolybdenum complex MoO 2 L 1 (Q) ] (where Q= <b>gamma-picoline</b> (la)). Molecular structure of all the complexes (I, la, 2, 3 and 4) is determined by X-ray crystallography, demonstrating the dibasic tridentate behavior of ligands. All the complexes show two irreversible reductive responses within the potential window - 0. 73 to - 1. 08 V, due to Movl/Mov and Mov/Mow processes. Catalytic potential of these complexes was tested for the oxidation of benzoin using 30 % aqueous H 2 O 2 as an oxidant in methanol. At least four reaction products, benzoic acid, benzaldehydedimethylacetal, methyl benzoate and benzil were obtained with the 95 - 99 % conversion under optimized reaction conditions. Oxidative bromination of salicylaldehyde, a functional mimic of haloperoxidases, in aqueous 1 - 1202 /KEr {{in the presence of}} HC 1 O 4 at room temperature has also been carried out successfully.

40|$|The quantum {{motion of}} guest {{molecules}} {{has been studied}} {{in a variety of}} calixarene host-guest complexes, and in a endohedral fullerene complex. The guest molecules of the calixarene complexes studied each comprise weakly hindered methyl groups, which undergo rotation via quantum tunnelling, even at cryogenic temperatures. The rotational motion of the guest methyl-groups has been studied by making temperature and frequency-dependent measurements of proton T 1, using field-cycling NMR, thus revealing the spectral density functions of the magnetic dipole-dipole interaction. Crystallographically inequivalent methyl-group environments have been identified and characterised in p-tert-butylcalix[4]arene(1 : 1) toluene, p-tert-butylcalix[4]arene(1 : 1) <b>gamma-picoline</b> and p-isopropylcalix[4]arene(2 : 1) p-xylene. In many of the calixarene complexes the proton spin-lattice relaxation has been observed to be strongly dependent on the thermal history of the sample. Temperature-dependent measurements of proton T 1 in samples of p-tert-butylcalix[4]arene(1 : 1) toluene with partially deuterated guest molecules reveal a systematic reduction in T 1 at low temperatures with increased degree of deuteration. Calixarene and fullerene host-guest complexes have been identified as having a potential application in cryogenic MAS-NMR as cryorelaxor complexes, capable of being attached to a large biomolecule and encouraging proton spin-lattice relaxation. The suitability of the calixarene complexes for use in this capacity has been investigated by measuring the temperature-dependence of proton T 1 at low temperatures. The quantised rotational and translational motion of dihydrogen confined within an open-cage fullerene—namely, aza-thio-open-cage-fullerene (ATOCF) —has been revealed by inelastic neutron scattering (INS) measurements. The splitting of excited rotational and translational states, due to the low symmetry of the ellipsoidal fullerene cavity, has been directly measured. Assignment of the peaks observed in the INS spectrum has been aided by analysis of the Q-dependence of excitation bands. The thermodynamics of ortho- and parahydryogen have been investigated via temperature dependence measurements. INS measurements have allowed the anistropic rotational potential experienced by the H 2 rotor to be determined...|$|E
