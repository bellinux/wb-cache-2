Potassium-argon dates of 750,000 and 400,000 years on rhyolitic lava domes above the basal breccia are consistent with the high rates of uplift and erosion recorded elsewhere in the Coast Mountains.|$|E

5|$|The {{recognition}} of pneumatic foramina in Majungasaurus, besides providing {{an understanding of}} its respiratory biology, also has larger-scale implications for evolutionary biology. The split between the ceratosaur line, which led to Majungasaurus, and the tetanuran line, to which birds belong, occurred {{very early in the}} history of theropods. The avian respiratory system, present in both lines, must therefore have evolved before the split, and well before the evolution of birds themselves.

5|$|In 1854, John Rae, while {{surveying}} the Boothia Peninsula for the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC), discovered <b>further</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> expedition's fate. Rae met an Inuk near Pelly Bay (now Kugaaruk, Nunavut) on 21 April 1854, {{who told him}} of a party of 35 to 40white men who had died of starvation {{near the mouth of}} the Back River. Other Inuit confirmed this story, which included reports of cannibalism among the dying sailors. The Inuit showed Rae many objects that were identified as having belonged to Franklin and his men. In particular, Rae brought from the Inuit several silver forks and spoons later identified as belonging to Franklin, Fitzjames, Crozier, and Robert Osmer Sargent, a shipmate aboard Erebus. Rae's report was sent to the Admiralty, which in October 1854 urged the HBC to send an expedition down the Back River to search for other signs of Franklin and his men.|$|E
5|$|Only {{a single}} Tyrannosaurus rex {{specimen}} has been conclusively shown {{to belong to}} a specific sex. Examination of B-rex demonstrated the preservation of soft tissue within several bones. Some of this tissue has been identified as a medullary tissue, a specialized tissue grown only in modern birds as a source of calcium for the production of eggshell during ovulation. As only female birds lay eggs, medullary tissue is only found naturally in females, although males are capable of producing it when injected with female reproductive hormones like estrogen. This strongly suggests that B-rex was female, and that she died during ovulation. Recent research has shown that medullary tissue is never found in crocodiles, which are thought to be the closest living relatives of dinosaurs, aside from birds. The shared presence of medullary tissue in birds and theropod dinosaurs is <b>further</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> close evolutionary relationship between the two.|$|E
5|$|The {{hospital}} {{registered the}} cause of death as senile dementia. However, Smetana's family believed that his physical and mental decline was due to syphilis. An analysis of the autopsy report, published by the German neurologist Dr Ernst Levin in 1972, came to the same conclusion. Tests carried out by Prof. Emanuel Vlček in the late 20th century on samples of muscular tissue from Smetana's exhumed body provided <b>further</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disease. However, this research has been challenged by Czech physician Dr Jiří Ramba, who has argued that Vlček's tests do not provide a basis for a reliable conclusion, citing the age and state of the tissues and highlighting reported symptoms of Smetana's that were incompatible with syphilis.|$|E
40|$|Quasi-coherent (QC) modes {{have been}} {{reported}} for more than 10 years in reflectometry fluctuations spectra in <b>the</b> core region <b>of</b> fusion plasmas. They have characteristics in-between coherent and broadband fluctuations as they oscillate at a marked frequency but have a wide spectrum. This work presents <b>further</b> <b>evidences</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> link recently established between QC modes and the trapped electron modes (TEM) instabilities (Arnichand et al 2014 Nucl. Fusion 54 123017). In electron cyclotron resonance heated discharges of Tore Supra, an enhancement of QC modes amplitude is observed {{in a region where}} TEM cause impurity transport and turbulence. In JET Ohmic plasmas, QC modes disappear during density ramp-up and current ramp-down. This is reminiscent of Tore Supra and TEXTOR observations during transitions from the linear Ohmic confinement (LOC) to the saturated Ohmic confinement (SOC) regimes. Evidencing TEM activity then becomes experimentally possible via analysis of fluctuation spectra...|$|R

5|$|In 1624, a {{fatality}} occurred {{following a}} match on Saturday, 28 August, at Horsted Keynes, now in East Sussex. A fielder called Jasper Vinall was struck {{on the head}} by the batsman, Edward Tye, {{who was trying to}} hit the ball a second time to avoid being caught. Vinall, who died thirteen days later at home in West Hoathly, is thus the earliest recorded cricketing fatality. The matter was recorded in a coroner's court, which returned a verdict of death by misadventure. The tragedy was repeated in 1647 when another fatality was recorded at Selsey, now in West Sussex, a player called Henry Brand being hit on the head by a batsman trying to hit the ball a second time. When the first Laws of Cricket were encoded in 1744, it was illegal to hit the ball twice and a batsman breaking the rule was to be given out. The record of the 1624 case confirms that two villages, Horsted Keynes and West Hoathly, were involved in the match and provides <b>further</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> growth of village cricket.|$|E
5|$|The Georgian {{court was}} {{primarily}} concerned with {{the protection of the}} Georgian monastic centers in the Holy Land. By the 12th century, eight Georgian monasteries were listed in Jerusalem. Saladin's biographer, Bahā' ad-Dīn ibn Šaddād, reports that after the Ayyubid conquest of Jerusalem in 1187, Tamar sent envoys to the sultan to request that the confiscated possessions of the Georgian monasteries in Jerusalem be returned. Saladin's response is not recorded, but the queen's efforts seem to have been successful: Jacques de Vitry, who attained to the bishopric of Acre shortly after Tamar's death, gives <b>further</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Georgians’ presence in Jerusalem. He writes that the Georgians were – in contrast to the other Christian pilgrims – allowed a free passage into the city, with their banners unfurled. Ibn Šaddād furthermore claims that Tamar outbid the Byzantine emperor in her efforts to obtain the relics of the True Cross, offering 200,000 gold pieces to Saladin who had taken the relics as booty at the Battle of Hattin – to no avail, however.|$|E

40|$|During {{the last}} years air {{transport}} stakeholder’s behaviors have witnessed deep modifications. Airlines competition has been exacerbated by economic downturns, while airport competition emerged as a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> less governmental intervention in airport investments. <b>The</b> first result <b>of</b> this process is a mix-model adopted by EU airlines in the domestic market, which implies that network airlines have adopted few <b>of</b> <b>the</b> strategies that have guaranteed <b>the</b> establishment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> low fares carriers, while low cost carriers have been continuously increasing <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> major airport served. <b>The</b> volatility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> air transport deregulated market has been analysed in the scientific literature and these aspects can be perceived as <b>further</b> <b>evidences</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> increased volatility.

5|$|The {{earliest}} surviving {{works of}} art that exhibit traces {{of the influence of}} the Parthenon frieze belong to the media of vase painting and grave stelae where we may find some echo not just of motifs, themes, poses, but tenor, as well. Direct imitation, and indeed quotation, of the frieze begins to be pronounced around 430 BC. One example, an explicit copy, is a pelike attributed to the Wedding Painter of a youth “parking up” a horse exactly in the manner of figure W25 on the frieze. While those vase paintings that resemble the frieze cluster around 430, the vases that quote the pediments are datable nearer {{to the end of the}} century, giving <b>further</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> priority of the sculptural program. More accomplished painters also found inspiration in the sculpture, namely Polygnotos I and his group, especially the Peleus Painter, the Kleophon Painter and the late work of the Achilles Painter. Later painters of talent also managed to capture the mood of eusebeia, or thoughtful piety of the procession, as, for example, on the volute krater of the Kleophon Painter of a sacrifice to Apollo, which shares the quiet dignity of the best of High Classical sculpture.|$|E
