25|$|An <b>important</b> <b>street</b> {{running through}} Newcastle {{at the time}} was Pilgrim Street, running northwards inside the walls and leading to the Pilgrim Gate on the north wall. The street still exists today and there are {{different}} explanations for its name. One is that pilgrims passed through Newcastle on the way to visit St Mary's Chapel in Jesmond. The other is that the friary of Greyfriars, next to Pilgrim Street, had holy relics of St Francis, the founder of the order, and pilgrims passed up Pilgrim Street to visit them.|$|E
2500|$|Eventually, he {{traveled}} back into Romania in October 1909, {{only to be}} arrested upon his transit through Brăila County. According to his recollections, he was for long left stranded {{on the border with}} Austria-Hungary, as officials in the latter country refused to let him pass; the situation had to be settled by negotiations between the two countries. Also according to Rakovsky, the arrest was hidden by the Ion I. C. Brătianu cabinet until it leaked to the press—this, coupled with rumors {{that he was about to}} be killed, and Brătianu's statement that he would [...] "rather destroy [...] than let [...] back into Rumania", caused a series of <b>important</b> <b>street</b> clashes between his supporters and government forces. On December 9, 1909, a Romanian Railways employee named Stoenescu attempted to assassinate Brătianu. The event, which was attributed by Rakovsky to support for his return and by other sources to government manipulation, caused a clampdown on România Muncitoare (among those socialists arrested and interrogated were Gheorghe Cristescu, I. C. Frimu, and Dumitru Marinescu).|$|E
