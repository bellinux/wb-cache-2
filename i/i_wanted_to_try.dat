5|$|We {{shot the}} clip in mid-October {{on a cold}} day in New York City. The vibe and feeling was great... It was the first video for the album, so {{obviously}} everyone was excited and focused on setting the tone for what's to come. Rihanna and I spoke in depth about creating a piece that was gritty, raw {{and more of a}} street video then a classic beauty piece... We loved the energy and bravado of early hip-hop videos that were made without a lot of resources, working more with the textures and shapes of the surroundings, then trying to build and manipulate environments as we {{have done in the past}}... <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> and take everything we have done in the past and put it to the side.|$|E
500|$|... "To Her Door" [...] and [...] "Treaty" [...] were voted {{into the}} APRA Top 30 Australian songs {{of all time}} in 2001. Paul Kelly and the Messengers gave their last {{performance}} in August 1991, with Kelly set to pursue a solo career. He justified his decision: [...] "We forged a style together. But I felt if we had kept going it would have got formulaic and that's why I broke it up. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> and start moving into other areas, start mixing things up". Paul Kelly and the Messengers' final album, Hidden Things, was a collection of previously released B-sides, stray non-LP tracks, radio sessions, and other rarities. It was released in May 1992, and reached No.29. One track, [...] "Rally Around the Drum", written with Archie Roach, was about an indigenous tent boxing man.|$|E
500|$|Tyler next {{appeared}} in Armageddon (1998), where {{she played the}} daughter of Bruce Willis' character and love interest of Ben Affleck's character. The film generated mixed reviews, {{but it was a}} box office success, earning $553million worldwide. The movie included the songs [...] "I Don't Want to Miss a Thing" [...] and [...] "What Kind of Love Are You On" [...] by Aerosmith. In a 2001 interview with The Guardian, she said that she initially turned down the role in Armageddon; [...] "I really didn't want to do it at first and I turned it down a couple of times, but the biggest reason I changed my mind was because I was scared of it. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> it for that very reason. I mean, I'm not really in this to do amazing things in my career – I just want it to be special when I make a movie." ...|$|E

500|$|On August 5, 2011, Guillermo del Toro {{stated that}} the remake would reflect his {{original}} vision for the film, {{and that it had}} been planned even when the first version was in production. [...] "Even when we produced the Spanish movie, I had intended to remake it because we had a very different screenplay that, because of money and time, got turned into the movie you saw – which is great, but there was this other structure for the original script that <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>try.</b> So even before we shot the first film it was an economic decision, a pre-existing creative decision, to change it." [...] Del Toro also praised the new film's director. [...] "We have Mark Pellington attached as director – I'm a big fan of his The Mothman Prophecies and his video work – and we are out to actors, so we're hoping to get things going soon." [...] On August 30, 2011, it was reported that American actress Amy Adams was in talks to star as Laura, the main character, who was played by Belén Rueda in the original film. It was also {{stated that the}} current incarnation of the remake screenplay had been written by Larry Fessenden and Sergio G. Sánchez, the sole writer of the original film.|$|E
500|$|The French {{electronic}} group Daft Punk {{composed the}} film score of Tron: Legacy, which features over 30 tracks. The score was arranged and orchestrated by Joseph Trapanese. Jason Bentley {{served as the}} film's music supervisor. An electronic music fan, Kosinski stated that to replicate the innovative electronic Tron score by Wendy Carlos [...] "rather than going with a traditional film composer, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> something fresh and different", adding that [...] "there {{was a lot of}} interest from different electronic bands that I follow to work on the film" [...] but he eventually picked Daft Punk. Kosinski added that he knew the band was [...] "more than just dance music guys" [...] for side projects such as [...] their film Electroma. The duo were first contacted by producers in 2007, when Tron: Legacy was still {{in the early stages of}} production. Since they were touring at the time, producers were unsuccessful in contacting the group. They were again approached by Kosinski, eventually agreeing to take part in the film a year later. Kosinski added that Daft Punk were huge Tron fans, and that his meeting with them [...] "was almost like they were interviewing me to make sure that I was going to hold up to the Tron legacy".|$|E
500|$|Away from acting, Hawke {{directed}} the music video for the 1994 song [...] "Stay (I Missed You)," [...] by singer-songwriter Lisa Loeb, {{who was a}} member of Hawke's theater company at the time. In a 2012 interview, Hawke said that the song, which was included in Reality Bites, is the only number-one popular song by an unsigned artist in the history of music. He published his first novel in 1996, The Hottest State, about a love affair between a young actor and a singer. Hawke said of the novel, [...] "Writing the book had to do with dropping out of college, and with being an actor. I didn't want my whole life to go by and not do anything but recite lines. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> making something else. It was definitely the scariest thing I ever did. And it was just one of the best things I ever did." [...] The book met with a mixed reception. Entertainment Weekly said that Hawke [...] "opens himself to rough literary scrutiny in The Hottest State. If Hawke is serious... he'd do well to work awhile in less exposed venues." [...] The New York Times thought Hawke did [...] "a fine job of showing what it's like to be young and full of confusion", concluding that The Hottest State was ultimately [...] "a sweet love story".|$|E
5000|$|Rey {{has been}} quoted {{describing}} his sound as [...] "...more {{of the experimental}} type; I don't like to tie myself down to just one genre. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> everything. I'm actually just now starting to listen to some country music so I can cater {{to that kind of}} artist. It may not end up being my thing, but <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> it first and see how it goes. I tend to favor pop, only because I like to mash hip hop drums with pop sounds." [...] His production is based around an alternative keyboard.|$|R

2500|$|Paul Kelly's {{first solo}} studio album after {{disbanding}} Paul Kelly & The Messengers was Wanted Man. The group had given their last performance in August 1991, and Kelly resumed his solo career. He justified his decision: [...] "We forged a style together. But I felt {{if we had}} kept going it would have got formulaic and that's why I broke it up. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> and start moving into other areas, start mixing things up". Kelly's first post-Messengers solo release was the live double CD Live, May 1992, released in November 1992. Kelly had already relocated to Los Angeles and signed with Vanguard Records to tour the US as a solo artist. While in Los Angeles he produced fellow Australian Renée Geyer's album Difficult Woman (1994).|$|E
2500|$|Four demos for {{the album}} were {{recorded}} on August 13, 1990; [...] "Enter Sandman", [...] "The Unforgiven", [...] "Nothing Else Matters" [...] and [...] "Wherever I May Roam." [...] The lead single [...] "Enter Sandman" [...] {{was the first}} song to be written and the last to receive lyrics. On October 4, 1990, a demo of [...] "Sad but True" [...] was recorded. In October 1990, Metallica began recording at One on One Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California, to record the album, and also at Little Mountain Sound Studios in Vancouver, British Columbia for about a week. On June 2, 1991, a demo of [...] "Holier Than Thou" [...] was recorded. Hetfield stated about the recording: [...] "What we really wanted was a live feel. In the past, Lars and I constructed the rhythm parts without Kirk and Jason. This time <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> playing as a band unit in the studio. It lightens things up and you get more of a vibe." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hawkeye was {{introduced}} as a reluctant villain in Tales of Suspense #57 (September 1964). After two more appearances as a villain in Tales of Suspense #60 and #64 (December 1964 and April 1965), Hawkeye joins {{the ranks of}} the Avengers in Avengers #16 (May 1965). He became a perennial member of the team and has made numerous appearances in all five volumes (Vol. 1 (1963–1996), Vol. 2 (1997), Vol. 3 (1999–2004), Vol. 4 (2010–2013), Vol. 5 (2013–present), including specials and annuals, as well as in The Ultimates. However, Hawkeye would be absent from the Avengers - both the team and the series - for nearly a decade starting in early 1973. Steve Englehart, the Avengers writer at the time of Hawkeye's departure, explained, [...] "When I had Hawkeye quit the Avengers, I liked him, but <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> a different approach, so his leaving fit in with what I was trying to do." ...|$|E
2500|$|Welsh {{classical}} singer Katherine Jenkins {{recorded a}} cover version of [...] "Bring Me to Life" [...] on her 2009 album Believe. Jenkins said: [...] "I'd mentioned that <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> Evanescence's Bring Me to Life and David [...] said 'you can't sing that'. I came out there questioning my vocal abilities. I'm just {{not used to}} being told that. I went home that night and I just thought to myself 'you have to pull yourself together, he's worked with so many incredible artists you {{have to step up}} the plate.' I did talk myself round and I went in there the next day on a mission. It's good to be pushed sometimes – and I proved him wrong!" [...] Jenkins decided to change the [...] guitar-led and percussive original version and instead, [...] "make it more orchestral with the percussion coming from the strings." [...] Alfred Hickling of The Guardian gave a mixed review of Jenkins' cover, calling it [...] "histrionic." [...] However, a writer of BBC Online chose her version of the song as a highlight on the album. On October 23, 2009, the song was available for digital download as the second single from Believe. On November 23, 2011, Jenkins sang the song live at the Leicester Square station in London.|$|E
2500|$|The show {{features}} Ullman {{playing an}} array of real-life people aside from a hearty helping of original characters. Impersonations include Judi Dench, Maggie Smith, {{and members of the}} British Royal Family, Camilla Parker-Bowles and Carole Middleton. Ullman received considerable international attention for her portrayal of German Chancellor Angela Merkel. [...] "I'm fascinated by Angela Merkel, so I wanted to be Angela Merkel. I think they're like Trojan horses, these impersonations. I can dress up like them and make them whatever I want them to be, like putting a personality within them. I didn't want to just do a straight impersonation. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> and show their lives. I always imagine that Angela Merkel is someone that has to be with men all the time, in these rooms having meetings... And I thought, 'I wonder what she's like when she's with her best friend and they just talk about hair and make-up?'" [...] BBC Director-General Tony Hall paid a visit to the set show and caught Ullman playing Merkel singing jazz and scatting about the state of European affairs. [...] "Tony Hall came down to the set the day I was singing as Merkel. He said: 'Would you please do this on Newsnight with me?'" [...] On 23 June 2017, BBC One's The One Show reached out to Angela Merkel's office for a statement regarding Ullman's impersonation of her: ...|$|E

5000|$|Genderbending may be political, {{stemming}} from the early identity politics movements of the 1960s and 1970s, a guiding principle {{of which is the}} idea that the personal is political.

I wanted to think that out; and moreover I wanted to think out some way to reform this evil and persuade the people to let the foolish fashion die out; but thinking {{was out of the question}} in the circumstances.

Worse even than that, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> how completely I could impose on her--how easily I might marry her, if I could only deceive you all, and take her away somewhere by herself. The devil was in possession of me. I don't know how it might have ended, if Oscar had not come in, and if Lucilla had not burst out as she did. She distressed me--she frightened me--she gave me back again to my better self. I rushed, without stopping to prepare her, into the question of her restoration to sight--as the only way of diverting her mind from the vile advantage that I had taken of her blindness. That night, Madame Pratolungo, I suffered pangs of self-reproach and remorse which would even have satisfied you. At the very next opportunity that offered, I made my atonement to Oscar. I supported his interests; I even put the words he was to say to Lucilla into his lips.|$|E

[...] He was dressed in a bright Italian dressing-gown or woollen paletot,--Italian, as having been bought in Italy, though, doubtless, it had come from France,--and on his feet he had green worked slippers, and on his head a brocaded cap. He had made but little other preparation for his friend in the way of dressing. His long dishevelled hair came down over his neck, and his beard covered his face. Beneath his dressing-gown he had on a night-shirt and drawers, and was as dirty in appearance as he was gaudy in colours. [...] "Sit down and let us two moralise," [...] he said.
