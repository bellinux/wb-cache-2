2500|$|In the Gospel of [...] Jesus is {{reported}} as giving this response {{to those who}} criticized him for healing on Sabbath: [...] "If {{a man on the}} sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> man every whit whole on the sabbath day?" ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{two years}} of study I have succeeded in {{establishing}} {{the basis of this}} new perspective I have talked about so much. It is not the materialist perspective of Gris, nor the romantic perspective of Picasso. It is rather a metaphysical perspectiveâ€”I take full responsibility for the word. You can't begin to imagine what I've found out {{since the beginning of the}} war, working outside painting but for painting. The geometry of the fourth space has no more secret for me. Previously I had only intuitions, now I have certainty. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> whole series of theorems on the laws of displacement , of reversal [...] etc. I have read Schoute, Rieman (sic), Argand, Schlegel etc.|$|E
2500|$|On 26 February 2012 {{a meeting}} with Goshi Hosono, {{minister}} of Environment, and Tatsuo Hirano, minister in charge of reconstruction, and the mayors of eight cities and villages near the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant was cancelled. Three mayors boycotted the meeting in a protest, because the government had already informed the media about the meeting's agenda prior to informing them. Katsutaka Idogawa, the mayor of Futaba, told a press conference, [...] "I strongly mistrust the government... So <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> momentous decision not to attend the meeting" [...] The mayors of the towns of Hirono and Namie also refused to go. This meeting was intended to discuss how {{to get rid of}} the radioactive material emitted by the plant and find a place for temporary facilities to store contaminated soil. The meeting was cancelled, instead Hosono and Hirano had an informal discussion with the five remaining municipal leaders.|$|E
60|$|Wild. You must excuse me, Frank; <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>an</b> {{appointment}} at the gaming-house.|$|R
60|$|The man's deportment was magnificent. But for {{the fact}} that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> long ago lost all faith in him <b>I</b> should <b>have</b> felt, without the shadow of <b>a</b> doubt, that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> supreme fool of myself. But as it was, my faith was only shaken. The hideous {{possibility}} that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> mistake was there like a shadow, but I could not accept it as a certainty.|$|R
60|$|The {{young man}} smiled faintly. The {{policeman}} answered me civilly, but I knew {{at once that}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> mistake.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well,' said Mr. Dick, in answer, 'my {{compliments}} to her, and I--I believe <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> start. I think <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> start,' said Mr. Dick, passing {{his hand}} among his grey hair, and casting {{anything but a}} confident look at his manuscript. 'You have been to school?' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> mistake. Please forgive me, and go away.--ANTONIA.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> speech, a copy {{of which}} I will send you by next mail.|$|E
60|$|But {{he grinned}} and shook his head, and though <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> good bargain, <b>I</b> was unpleasantly aware that he <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> better one.|$|R
60|$|I was fool {{enough to}} smile at this, and wise enough {{afterwards}} to see in her face that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> mistake.|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> {{pledge to}} the people of Pakistanto {{implement}} industrial reforms.... I am now beginning to redeem the pledge....! Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, 1971 ...|$|R
60|$|I {{do believe}} that under God's {{providence}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> discovery. I shall get the maps and look over them.|$|E
60|$|Ant. [Aside.] If Morayma comes, {{and takes}} {{me in the}} arbour with her, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> fine {{exchange}} of that diamond for this pebble.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> slight note or two {{here and}} there, {{with a soft}} pencil, so that a touch of indiarubber will make all blank again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wrong, {{completely}} wrong. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> mistake--I <b>had</b> {{been too}} clever, and I got my reward accordingly. You know how I advised Mrs. Linley?" ...|$|R
60|$|Then I too {{rose from}} my seat, for <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> vow {{not to allow}} a wasp to be killed {{unnecessarily}} in my presence.|$|R
6000|$|... 'And {{there is}} not another word to tell, Agnes,' said <b>I,</b> when <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>an</b> end of my confidence. 'Now, my {{reliance}} is on you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay! not a tragedy, Your Majesty. Better {{men than}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> failure of their lives. So I pray you, think {{no more of}} me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Be gracious for a little, {{and listen}} to my plan. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> plan. Listen, Iris. I can no longer endure this life. It drives me mad." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I was. But {{this is my}} jurisdiction, partly, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> fool {{of myself}} in it completely. I shall remain and help get things {{straight}} again." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{saw that}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>an</b> {{impression}} on her, from those very words. 'If she lets {{me into the}} house to-morrow,' said I, 'she is mine.' ...|$|R
60|$|ASHER. I {{was ready}} to {{recognize}} that. Before they came to me this morning <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> plan to reorganize the shops, to grant many privileges.|$|R
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>an</b> experiment. Two {{days ago}} I pinched from an enemy a mauser rifle. Its heavy, {{unwieldy}} shape swamped {{me with a}} powerful image of brutality.|$|R
6000|$|... "It matters not. I leave {{not this}} region until <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> more {{thorough}} search for {{and found the}} lad Cormac, or at least ascertained his fate." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then a new, big {{voice said}} slowly and thickly, {{as though the}} owner had just waked up: [...] "It's my {{conviction}} that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> fool of myself" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And now good-bye. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> vow {{to myself}} {{not to think}} into [...] things too much. Your affectionate friend (as much of her as there [...] is)-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There," [...] said Mary, as {{the door}} closed behind the {{rustling}} muslins of the ladies. [...] "There, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>an</b> enemy for ever, perhaps two; that's satisfactory." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now {{you will}} indeed hate me," [...] I said. [...] "It is useless {{to attempt to}} conciliate you: <b>I</b> see <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>an</b> eternal enemy of you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>an</b> {{arrangement}} which <b>I</b> did not anticipate; and so I posted {{after you}} at once. Whom {{do you think}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> brought with me?" ...|$|R
60|$|I come to {{the most}} evasive and {{difficult}} part of my story, which is to tell how Isabel and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> common wreck of our joint lives.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes; I {{have come}} round to your opinion. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> {{plan for the}} Greek court you were anxious to build.' And he {{elevated}} the drawing-board against the wall.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come! come!" [...] said Arnold, seriously. [...] "Neither she nor I {{deserve to}} be sneered at, in that way. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> {{sacrifice}} to your interests, Geoffrey--and so has she." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Entirely unnecessary. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>an</b> examination. There is {{practically}} nothing {{the matter with}} the man. Put him to bed, and let him sponge his knee with warm water." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I was {{determined}} to tell her;--so that she should not turn round upon me afterwards and say that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> deceived her. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> promise to my father." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And leave Simon Kenton in {{the hands}} of the savage brutes?" [...] I asked angrily, grown unreasoning in my nervous fears and the {{knowledge}} that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> fool of myself.|$|R
