25|$|The Galil {{series of}} rifles are {{selective}} fire weapons {{operated by a}} Kalashnikov-pattern gas-driven piston system with no regulator. The weapon is locked with a rotary bolt with two locking lugs that lock into recesses milled <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>receiver.</b>|$|E
25|$|Bolt-action {{weapons are}} rugged, reliable, and {{typically}} the most accurate, {{due to the}} strong camming action that locks the bolt <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>receiver.</b> The disadvantage is that bolt actions require removing the firing hand from the trigger to operate the bolt, which requires more time between shots than other repeating actions.|$|E
25|$|Sterling Armaments of Dagenham, Essex {{produced}} a conversion kit comprising a new 7.62mm barrel, magazine, extractor and ejector for commercial sale. The main {{difference between the}} two conversions was in the cartridge ejection arrangement; the Enfield magazine carried a hardened steel projection that struck the rim of the extracted case to eject it, the Sterling system employed a spring-loaded plunger inserted <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> wall.|$|E
50|$|Before {{the match}} a coin is flipped to {{determine}} the first server. One of the players will serve to start {{the game and the}} serve is hit <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>receivers</b> inner serve area without touching <b>the</b> net/plank. <b>The</b> <b>receiver</b> will hit <b>the</b> ball back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> servers court side.|$|R

50|$|Proper jamming {{technique}} {{requires the}} cornerback {{to use their}} legs, shoulder width apart. At the same time, the cornerback thrusts their arms forward <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>receiver's</b> chest to maximize power. When properly executed, a jam can knock a receiver off his feet. Jamming is only legal within five yards from the line of scrimmage.|$|R
25|$|To {{complete}} an aerial refueling, the tanker and receiver aircraft rendezvous, flying in formation. The receiver {{moves to a}} position behind the tanker, within safe limits of travel for the boom, aided by director lights or directions radioed by the boom operator. Once in position, the operator extends the boom {{to make contact with}} the receiver aircraft. Once in contact, fuel is pumped through the boom <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> aircraft.|$|E
25|$|It is also {{possible}} to simulate the sense antenna by tapping a feed off the loop {{it would have been}} associated with. This is normally accomplished by placing a center tap in the tuning inductor, and then feeding that signal into the circuit as if it were from another antenna. Since the center-tap causes the signal from both vertical sections to be balanced, it creates a signal similar to a single vertical mast. When used with aperiodic windings, the sense circuit has to be wired <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> side, along with the tuning capacitor.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the GL/EL display, the Mk. II used {{a single}} {{receiver}} for {{each pair of}} antennas. The switch rapidly alternated {{one or the other}} signal <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>receiver.</b> It also sent one of the signals through a short delay line. It did not, however, move the Y-axis baseline. The result was a single trace along the center of the display, with two slightly separated blips, one from each antenna. By comparing the relative lengths of the two blips, the operator could determine which antenna was more closely aligned with the target, and continue to rotate it until the blips were equal length.|$|E

50|$|In radio astronomy, {{heterodyne}} receivers {{are widely}} used in detection of the electromagnetic signals from celestial objects. The separations among various components of a hyperfine structure are usually {{small enough to fit}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>receiver's</b> IF band. Because optical depth varies with frequency, strength ratios among the hyperfine components differ from that of their intrinsic intensities. From this we can derive the object's physical parameters.|$|R
50|$|If the inaudible radio {{frequency}} (RF) transmitter signal is inadvertently coupled <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>receiver's</b> audio signal path, it can trigger the AGC or squelch circuit {{to reduce the}} gain. Then, after a delay time set by the circuit's time constant, the circuit increases the gain again until the amplitude of the radio signal triggers another gain reduction. This repetitive cycle is heard as motorboating.|$|R
25|$|A cucurbit {{was filled}} half {{full of the}} liquor from which brandy was to be drawn and then raised with a little fire until about one sixth part was {{distilled}}, or until that which falls <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> was entirely flammable. This liquor, distilled only once, was called spirit of wine or brandy. Purified by another distillation (or several more), this was then called spirit of wine rectified. The second distillation was made in balneo mariae and in a glass cucurbit, and the liquor was distilled to about one half the quantity. This was further rectified—as long as the operator thought necessary—to produce brandy.|$|E
2500|$|A mid-life {{upgrade to}} the Glock pistols {{involved}} {{the addition of}} checkering on the front strap and serrations to the back strap. These versions, introduced in 1988, were informally referred to as [...] "second-generation" [...] models. To meet American ATF regulations, a steel plate with a stamped serial number was embedded <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> {{in front of the}} trigger guard.|$|E
2500|$|The heavy, cold hammer-forged barrel is screwed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> and is {{equipped}} with a slotted [...] "bird cage" [...] type flash suppressor that is also used to launch rifle grenades (using standard, live ammunition) or attach a knife bayonet (the bayonet is supported by a lug located {{at the base of the}} gas block). The rifled barrel has 6 right-hand grooves and the Swiss Army specification 254mm (1:10 in) rifling twist rate is optimized for Swiss military GP 90 ammunition. An export-oriented barrel with a 178mm (1:7 in) twist rate is also available, designed to stabilize 5.56×45mm NATO rounds with the heavier SS109 and tracer projectiles.|$|E
50|$|This is {{the major}} {{difference}} between squash tennis and squash racquets. In the latter sport the ball must go beyond the floor service line <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>receiver's</b> box. But it is similar to lawn tennis, as the ball is served diagonally and lands {{in front of the}} service line. In squash racquets the server also stands in toward the side wall, rather than {{in the center of the}} court.|$|R

30|$|For clarity, we {{depict the}} {{structure}} of our proposed PSDFR protocol in Fig.  2 b. Let ρ be the power splitting factor matrix, which denotes the portion of power split to <b>the</b> EH <b>receiver.</b> <b>The</b> received signals are first processed at R by its receiver filter W_R,k, and then split into two flows. Specifically, the (1 -ρ) part is input <b>into</b> <b>the</b> information <b>receiver</b> for <b>the</b> information decoding, whereas the remaining part ρ is input <b>into</b> <b>the</b> EH <b>receiver</b> for energy harvesting, and all the harvested energy is then allocated to R’s forwarding matrix F_R,m. The detailed transmission process of PSDFR is as follows.|$|R
2500|$|Several {{characteristics}} of the magnetron's output make radar use of the device somewhat problematic. The first of these factors is the magnetron's inherent instability in its transmitter frequency. This instability results not only in frequency shifts from one pulse to the next, but also a frequency shift within an individual transmitted pulse. The second factor is that {{the energy of the}} transmitted pulse is spread over a relatively wide frequency spectrum, which requires the receiver to have a correspondingly wide bandwidth. This wide bandwidth allows ambient electrical noise to be accepted <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>receiver,</b> thus obscuring somewhat the weak radar echoes, thereby reducing overall receiver signal-to-noise ratio and thus performance. [...] The third factor, depending on application, is the radiation hazard caused by the use of high power electromagnetic radiation. In some applications, for example a marine radar mounted on a recreational vessel, a radar with a magnetron output of 2 to 4 kilowatts is often found mounted very near an area occupied by crew or passengers. In practical use these factors have been overcome, or merely accepted, and there are today thousands of magnetron aviation and marine radar units in service. [...] Recent advances in aviation weather avoidance radar and in marine radar have successfully replaced the magnetron with semiconductor microwave oscillators, which have a narrower output frequency range. [...] These allow a narrower receiver bandwidth to be used, and the higher signal to noise ratio in turn allows a lower transmitter power, reducing exposure to EMR.|$|E
2500|$|Rocko's Modern Life {{has been}} noted for its racy humor. Adults made up more than one-fifth of the {{audience}} for the show during its run. The series contained numerous adult innuendos, such as Rocko's brief stint as a telephone operator in the episode [...] "Canned": the instructions {{on the wall behind}} him helpfully remind all employees to [...] "Be Hot, Be Naughty, and Be Courteous" [...] while he flatly repeats [...] "Oh baby" [...] <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>receiver.</b> Joe Murray noted that the season one segment [...] "Leap Frogs" [...] received [...] "some complaints from some parents" [...] due to its sexual humor, leading to Nickelodeon removing the episode from air {{for the remainder of the}} show's run, although it later aired on the cable channel Nicktoons, and was made available on DVD and video streaming sites such as Netflix. In [...] "The Good, the Bad and the Wallaby", Heffer encounters a milking machine and finds pleasure, although only his reactions are shown onscreen. According to writer/director Jeff [...] "Swampy" [...] Marsh, the scene was originally supposed to have hearts appearing in Heffer's eyes at the climactic moment. Although it clearly wasn't going to be included, they described the scene to Nickelodeon censors anyway: [...] "We described the scene, and then waited for the axe to fall, but all they said was 'can you change the hearts to stars?', we said sure, and it went in." [...] The scene, as well as a scene showing Heffer's break-up with the machine, were later removed. They are intact in the Canadian broadcasts of the episode, however. In addition, the uncut version can still be found on the VHS [...] "Rocko's Modern Life: With Friends Like These".|$|E

I jammed a shell <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>receiver.</b> My last chance had fled! But Copple's big, brown, swift hands fed shells to his magazine as ears of corn go to a grinder. He had a way of poking the base of a shell straight down <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> and making it snap forward and down. Then he fired five more shots as swiftly as he had reloaded. Some of these hit close to our quarry. The old grizzly slowed up, and looked across, and wagged his huge head.|$|E

Moreover, their advertisement can be seen along with many others--all, I am sure, just as honourable and just as trustworthy--in the columns of any daily newspaper. As everybody knows, many methods are employed. The tapping of a table, the movement of a ouija board, or the voice of a trance medium, are only a few among the many devices by which the spirits now enter into communication with us. But in my own case the method used was not only simplicity itself, but was so framed as to carry with it the proof of its own genuineness.
