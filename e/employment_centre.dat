25|$|The airport's {{location}} between Melbourne and Geelong {{makes it}} both a capital city airport and a regional airport, servicing a large regional catchment in western Victoria and providing connections to tourism destinations {{such as the}} Great Ocean Road. Since Linfox Group's purchase of the airport in 1997, Avalon Airport's aviation operations have grown significantly as it has established itself as a second gateway to the Melbourne and Geelong regions. Today, the airport contains land and facilities that are surplus to current and projected aviation requirements. This provides the opportunity to pursue property development projects for {{a wider range of}} activities, which support Avalon Airport's growth as an airport and as a major <b>employment</b> <b>centre</b> for the region.|$|E

40|$|Metropolitan areas {{vary widely}} in {{employment}} distribution and labour accessibility. Comparing four US metropolitan areas-Atlanta, Boston, Phoenix and Washington, DC—it is found that Atlanta and Washington, DC suffer from low labour accessibility compared with Boston and Phoenix. Moreover, large suburban <b>employment</b> <b>centres</b> in Atlanta and Washington, DC suffer from even lower accessibility than other <b>employment</b> <b>centres</b> {{within the same}} metropolitan areas or their counterparts in Boston and Phoenix. Their low labour accessibility is mainly explained by slower commuting speeds. Even though their residential and employment densities are modest, congestion in these <b>employment</b> <b>centres</b> is severe enough to undermine accessibility. The results {{raise questions about the}} effectiveness of creating large sub-centres in metropolitan areas, particularly creating auto-oriented edge-city-style <b>employment</b> <b>centres</b> at highway nodes. ...|$|R

2500|$|Mrs Ada Summers {{was elected}} first woman mayor of Stalybridge in November 1919. At that time mayors of boroughs were justices, {{as well as}} chairmen of borough benches, by right of office. However, {{it was not until}} the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919 came into force on 23 December 1919 that women could become {{magistrate}}s. Sitting ex-officio Ada Summers became the first woman magistrate in the country and was sworn in on 31 December. Ada Summers was, probably, the first woman to officially adjudicate in court. Ada Summers photo appeared in the weekly journal Great Thoughts, 5 June 1920, alongside an interview on [...] "The First Woman JP" [...] on her work. Ada Summers was the widow of a local ironmaster. She was an active suffragist and Liberal and used her wealth and position to support a number of schemes designed to improve conditions in the town. These included a maternity and child welfare clinic, clinics for the sick and poor and an unofficial <b>employment</b> <b>centre.</b> She later became an alderman and was appointed MBE. On 31 May 1939 she was awarded the Honorary Freedom of the Borough.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} {{emerging}} pattern of {{journey to work}} traffic that characterises the <b>employment</b> <b>centres</b> of a fast growing African city {{with reference to the}} case of Benin region, Nigeria. This is achieved by identifying and extracting the significant <b>employment</b> <b>centres</b> of the region. On the one hand, factor analysis and Getis-Ord statistic were systematically used to identify the spatial configuration of the region’s employment. Regression models on the other hand, were used to estimate the relationship that exists between job decentralisation and travel behaviour. Factor analysis and Getis-Ord statistic identified four significant employment clusters in the region. Multivariate and bivariate regression models were further used to explore the dynamics of commuting behaviour in response to decentralisation of <b>employment</b> <b>centres.</b> It is found that employment spatial structure exerts significant influence on all dimensions of commuting pattern of the region. The result shows that decentralisation of jobs in the metropolis has led to a reduction in commuting times, travel distance and significantly influence the modal choice of commuters. </p...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{investigates the}} spatial {{distribution}} of employment {{in the region of}} Ile-de-France in 1978 and 1997. Exploratory spatial data analysis is used to identify <b>employment</b> <b>centres</b> and a sectoral analysis of the central business district (CBD) and sub-centres is performed. The results highlight a process of suburbanisation of employment in Ile-de-France between 1978 and 1997. A more polarised space emerges in 1997 than in 1978, with several <b>employment</b> <b>centres</b> specialised in different activities. Moreover, even if the spatial influence of the CBD declines over the study period, the CBD maintains its economic leadership by concentrating a large variety of high-order producer services...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} impact of accessibility on the growth of employment cen-tres in the Los Angeles region between 1990 and 2000. There is extensive empirical documentation of polycentricity—the presence of multiple concentrations of employment—in large metropolitan areas. However, there is limited understanding of the determinants of growth of <b>employment</b> <b>centres.</b> It has long been held that transport investments influence urban structure, particularly freeways and airports. Using data on 48 <b>employment</b> <b>centres,</b> the effects are tested of various measures of accessibility on <b>centre</b> <b>employment</b> growth: highway accessibility, network accessibil-ity and two measures of labour force accessibility. Access to airports is also tested. It is found that, after controlling for centre size, density, industry mix, location within the region and spatial amenities, labour force accessibility and network accessibility are significantly related to centre growth. It is concluded that accessibility continues {{to play an important}} role in urban spatial structure...|$|R

40|$|The {{assumption}} thaturban workers economize on commuting {{is implicit}} in urban economic theory. Yet it has been challenged by some recent studies. This study estimates commute flows implied by three urban density functions: monocentric, polycentric, and dispersive. A polycentric density function generalizes the standard monocentric model by assuming that employment and worker residences are distributed in a pattern consistent with several <b>employment</b> <b>centres,</b> not just one. A dispersive density function further generalizes the polycentric model by assuming that urban residents not only value access to <b>employment</b> <b>centres</b> but also value access to the overall job opportunities in their location choices. It is found that an urban density function better predicting the actual spatial patterns also better explains the actual commuting behaviour. This finding helps to preserve the assumption that urban workers make attempts to economize on commuting in their location choices. ...|$|R
