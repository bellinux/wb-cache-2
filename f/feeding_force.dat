40|$|Objectives: Prolonged {{exposure}} to severe chipping hammer vibration may cause hand–arm vibration syndrome. A reliable test method {{is required to}} select appropriate tools and assist {{in the development of}} better chipping hammers. In the present study, the ISO standardized test method (ISO 8662 - 2, 1992) was examined through an investigation of the vibration character-istics of chipping hammers operating on the energy absorber specified in the standard. Methods: The energy absorber and test setup were designed and constructed based on those specified in the standard. The experiment employed six subjects and used two pneumatic chip-ping hammers and three different <b>feed</b> <b>forces</b> (50, 100 and 200 N). The subject posture was the same as that specified in the standard. Results: The vibration emission at the tool dominant frequency (or air blow rate) generally declined with an increase in <b>feed</b> <b>force,</b> thus decreasing the frequency-weighted accelerations. The increase in <b>feed</b> <b>force,</b> however, resulted in an increase in the unweighted vibration emis-sion at high frequencies. The chipping hammer vibration emission operating on the energy absorber at the high <b>feed</b> <b>force</b> (200 N) was inconsistent. Conclusions: The measurement method has a good repeatability except at a high <b>feed</b> <b>force.</b> The <b>feed</b> <b>force</b> has a significant effect on the vibration emission. The single <b>feed</b> <b>force</b> specified in the standard may not be sufficient to test the tool behaviors.

40|$|Drilling with {{twist drills}} is an often used {{manufacturing}} method {{for the production}} of drillings, for which a result transmission of conventional tool diameters (e. g. D = 10 mm) to microdrills (D < 2 mm) has not yet been possible. Reasons for this are to be seen on the one hand in the macro and micro geometry of the tools, which for technical reasons can not be transfered linearly from the conventional diameter range to the range of microdrills. On the other hand process variables may affect the drilling process such as the cutting temperatures at the major cutting edges, these temperatures not having been quantified for a tool diameter variation of the conventional range to the range of microdrills. Employment of FEM simulation has proved not to be an adequate means for extending process understanding nor for reducing development and process design costs, since no verified three-dimensional drilling model has been available yet. This treatise essentially deals with three core topics. To begin with, there is the first determination of the cutting temperatures at the major cutting edges of the drills in a diameter range from 1 to 10 mm {{with the help of the}} two color pyrometry and the effect of these temperatures on the cutting process. Secondly the application of the "drag grinding process” is proven {{for the production of}} defined and reproducible edge roundnesses with radii of 4 µm < = rn < = 40 µm on drilling tools. The effects of an edge roundness of microdrills on tool life and construction unit behavior are examined in detail on macro- and microscopic level and the advantages of the tools rounded by drag grinding are pointed out. On basis of the in step one and two employed tools, the third step develops, optimises and verifies three-dimensional drilling simulations.

Today such cable winding is performed manually, which is very repetitive, time-consuming and therefore also expensive. This paper presents the design, function and control system of a developed cable feeder tool for robotized stator cable winding.

These alloys {{are considered to be}} difficult to machine due to their rigidity and poor thermal conductivity. High-pressure jet-assisted machining of titanium alloys is beneficial. It not only increases production efficiency, by increasing the cutting speed and lowering temperature both in cutting zone and the cutting tool, but also improves chip control, and increases tool life. It also produces better surface integrity and compress residual stress, which improves the properties of work metals such as fatigue. In order to compare the effect of high-pressure jet-assisted machining on the work pieces of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy, the depth profile of residual stress was measured using xray diffraction. As comparison, the depth profile of residual stress was also measured for the conventional machined work pieces. It was found that the residual stress was a function of machining parameters, such as cutting speed, <b>feeding</b> <b>force</b> and depth of cut and particularly the high-pressure jet increases the amount of residual compressional stresses in both cutting and feed direction. In the present paper, Ti 6 A 14 V rod was machined by turning in two different manners, finishing and roughing.

To illustrate the effect of high-pressure jet assisted machining on the properties of the work piece of Ti- 6 -Al- 4 V and the depth profile of its residual stress, X -ray defractometer was used.

40|$|The {{demand for}} weight {{reduction}} in automobiles {{to reduce fuel consumption}} pushed the spring manufacturer to choose higher-strength martensitic steels {{to reduce the}} resisting section of the wire, and for this reason the weight of the spring. The traditional approach in forming such materials is based on the hot coiling of the wire at high temperature to increase material formability and to reduce the required forming forces. Another approach is the cold forming process wherein the wire is heat treated before the spring is formed to improve its formability. In both cases the coiled spring has to be hardened and tempered to reach the target strength. Energy and time consumption due to the final heat treatment slow production and increase the manufacturing cost of the spring. The two-fold target of shortening the process cycle and reducing the weight of the spring was met successfully in cold forming the material in its final condition (hardened and tempered). In this case the coiling process becomes more critical because the formability of these high-strength martensitic steels is not very high. The trend of using high-strength steels (between 1800 and 2100 MPa) increases the difficulties in the cold forming of such wires and can lead to the failure of the coiled wire caused by the breakage of the spring. 1 - 3 The forming forces required in the coiling of the wire increase with the high strength of the material causing the <b>feeding</b> <b>force</b> to also increase. The feeding rolls should provide enough force to avoid the slip of the wire between the rolls. For this reason the friction between the wire and the feeding rolls should be at a high level to provide enough tangential force to avoid any slip of the wire. On the other hand, high friction increases the required forming force due to the higher contribution of friction forces developing in the stationary dies where the wire slides as in the guiding plate, in the bending die and in the bar controlling the axial pitch of the spring. The contribution made by the bending die can be reduced using two bending rolls where the sliding friction is substituted by a prevalent rolling friction. This solution has been successfully used by spring manufacturers, who still face the problem of friction in the remaining components of the coiling machine: in the feeding system the friction should be high and elsewhere should be low. The insertion of a lubricating station between feeding and forming can solve the problem, but can be difficult in the industrial application, generating a dirty area of the press and requiring a cleaning step after coiling to remove residual lubricant from the spring’s external surface. For these reasons, the spring manufacturer asks for a wire with an external oxide, which should act as a thin solid lubricant layer. If this layer is too thin, it can be broken when the wire is passing between the feeding rolls, causing a possible slip of the wire and an increase of friction in the forming section of the press. Slipping in the feeding rolls can be eliminated by increasing the radial pressure of the rolls on the wire, but this action can introduce damage to the wire and eventually can lead to failure in the coiling of the spring. The investigation has been focused on the effect of friction {{as well as on the}} set-up of the coiling machine, and it is based on a preliminary experimental analysis of different wires. Different samples of the same steel with different Fe-oxide layers have been tested in the coiling machine. Most of them allow the correct manufacture of the spring, but some result in the breakage of the spring during coiling. The samples have been characterized in the laboratory relative to mechanical properties, microstructure, thickness of the oxide layer and its morphology and type of oxide and its adherence to the steel underneath. Afterwards, a numerical model of the spring coiling process has been developed introducing the description of the Lemaitre damage model in the material properties. Relative damage has been used as the index to estimate the risk of failure when different friction and process parameters are used...|$|E

40|$|Tool wear {{condition}} monitoring {{has the potential}} to {{play a critical role in}} ensuring the dimensional accuracy of the workpiece and prevention of damage to cutting equipment. It could also help in automating cutting processes. In this paper, the <b>feed</b> cutting <b>force</b> estimated with the aid of an inexpensive current sensor installed on the ac servomotor of a computerized numerical control turning center is used to monitor tool {{wear condition}}. To achieve this, the feed drive system is modeled, using neuro-fuzzy techniques, to provide the framework for estimating the <b>feed</b> cutting <b>force</b> based on the feed motor current measured. Functional dependence of the <b>feed</b> cutting <b>force</b> on tool wear and cutting parameters are then expressed in the form of a difference equation relating variation in the <b>feed</b> cutting <b>force</b> to tool wear rate. The computerized system automatically compares successive <b>feed</b> cutting <b>force</b> estimates and determines the onset of accelerated tool wear in order to issue a request for tool replacement. Experimental results show that the tool wear condition monitoring is effective and industrially applicable...|$|R
40|$|In rotary drilling, {{specific}} energy {{is considered to}} be an important parameter for defining mechanical efficiency of the rock destruction process. Specific Energy is defined as the energy required to remove one unit of rock. Specific energy is the function {{of the size of the}} borehole and various operational parameters including <b>feed</b> <b>force,</b> rotation speed, rotation torque and penetration rate. The harder the material, the higher the {{specific energy}}. The traditional method to calculate the specific energy is based on the parameters penetration rate, <b>feed</b> <b>force,</b> torque and rotation speed, that can be provided by Measurement While Drilling (MWD) data from the drill process. In this study, MWD data from an open pit mine in Sweden are used to evaluate data trends among logged parameters and calculated average specific energy. The results show that there is a significant hole length dependency for penetration rate and <b>feed</b> <b>force</b> that affects the predicted specific energy. This may be explained by that the hole cleaning efficiency is reduced with increasing hole length. The analysis shows that the specific energy is over-estimated by 45 % in the bottom of an 18 m hole compared to the collaring point. The suggested solution is to use hole average or complement the specific energy calculation with a hole length related component.

40|$|Carbon Fiber-Reinforced by Plastic (CFRP) is now {{commonly}} used in the aircraft industry. The main challenge is to manufacture this difficult-to-cut work material, considering its quality criteria and economical aspects. Drilling is the main machining operation required for the assembly of the aircraft structure. In this paper, results are presented and discussed regarding exit delamination studied at a local scale. Because of the anisotropic properties of CFRP, the fiber cutting modes change with the composite sequence combined with the drill revolution parameters. The local <b>feed</b> <b>forces</b> generated by the cutting edge on the hole bottom may be correlated with delaminating aspects. A posttreatment method is proposed to analyze precisely these <b>feed</b> <b>force</b> and cutting torque distributions. Appropriate ply sequences are identified in order to limit the mechanical load concentration {{and the risk of}} delamination or uncut fiber...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Two-Axle Bending Technique with Elastic Roller (TABTER) {{is a kind}} of {{advanced}} manufacturing method for bending tubular parts, specially suiting for the difficult-to-work metal materials with high specific strength, and it can obtain a finer forming accuracy. Now the technique has been applied to bend split-sleeve and missile body cylinder successfully. In existed theories, the forming precision of the parts is controlled by adjusting the feed distance between the two axles. But because of the aging problem of the elastic roller and other uncertain factors, the <b>feed</b> <b>force</b> may be different even using the same feed, thus the forming precision cannot be ensured. To solve this problem, the forming theory by controlling the <b>feed</b> <b>force</b> between the two axles is proposed. Then the NC model of forming the non-circular cross-section tubular parts based on the theory is built. At last, the NC prototype machine is developed and some experiments are carried out on the machine...|$|R
