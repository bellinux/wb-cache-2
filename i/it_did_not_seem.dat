5|$|Smoke was not {{the only}} thing emitted from the power station. In July 1956, the {{discharge}} of cooling water from the stations was noted to have increased the water temperature of the river by 1.5°C between Ryton and Scotswood. However, this was found to not be too deleterious, as <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> to affect the passage of migratory fish. In fact, because of the stations' introduction of warm water into the river, basking sharks were known to be attracted to the area.|$|E

However, Gundolf was no longer performing teaching duties, so he directed Goebbels to associate professor Max Freiherr von Waldberg. Waldberg was also Jewish.

5|$|Oryzomys {{is rare in}} Panama. Panamanian Oryzomys {{were first}} {{described}} by Goldman in 1912, who introduced the name Oryzomys gatunensis for a specimen from Gatún in the Canal Zone. In 1918, Goldman kept the animal as a separate species, remarking that it was similar to richmondi, but distinctive in the well-developed ridges along {{the margins of the}} interorbital region, the short interparietal bone (part of the roof of the braincase), and the long nasal bones. In 1937, Bole described another species of Panamanian Oryzomys, Oryzomys azuerensis from Paracoté, Veraguas Province. It is a brown form, lacking the reddish tones of nearby populations, and has a broad skull with a short rostrum (front part) and ridges on the interorbital region like those of gatunensis. Although Goldman recommended to him that gatunensis and azuerensis both be treated as subspecies of couesi, Bole described azuerensis as a species because <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> intermediate between the geographically closest forms, gatunensis and couesi, and was separated by a large gap from the nearest known populations of O.couesi in northwestern Costa Rica and southeastern Nicaragua. In a 1966 review of Panamanian mammals, Charles Handley reduced both gatunensis and azuerensis to subspecies of the marsh rice rat (in which O.couesi was included at the time), and when O.couesi was reinstated as a separate species these forms went with it. Specimens from near the type locality of azuerensis differ by about 7% in their Cytb sequences from other O.couesi, which suggests that they may represent a separate species. However, Hanson and colleagues did not reinstate azuerensis as a species, because they could not examine samples of gatunensis.|$|E

25|$|The {{main issue}} {{turned out to}} be political, with War Plans {{concerned}} that reconstruction of the Tennessees might disrupt the building of new cruisers and with doubts about whether they would compare to more modern ships, even with their superior tonnage. Costs had escalated to $17 million and <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> profitable to modernize ships that would be between 25 and 28 years old once modernization was complete. Also, the Bureau of Ordnance did not consider replacing their guns practical. This meant that, if these ships were kept in service 15 years after modernization, they might eventually face weapons over 40 years more advanced than their own. Despite these developments, detailed studies continued.|$|E

25|$|It {{caused him}} to reflect. But there was no result. The {{justice of the peace}} was a stern man. On the trial he found fault with the scheme and {{required}} us to explain upon what we based our strange conduct—as he called it. The understudy said:“On the custom of the niggers. They all do it.” The justice forgot his dignity and descended to sarcasm. “Custom of the niggers! Are our morals so inadequate that we have to borrow of niggers?” Then he said to the jury: “Three melons were owing; they were collected from persons not proven to owe them: this is theft; they were collected by compulsion: this is extortion. A melon was added for the widows and orphans. It was owed by no one. It is another theft, another extortion. Return it whence it came, with the others. It is not permissible here to apply to any purpose goods dishonestly obtained; not even to the feeding of widows and orphans, for this would be to put a shame upon charity and dishonor it.” He said it in open court, before everybody, and to me <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> very kind.|$|E

500|$|Among other {{theories}} about the case, early speculation was that the girl could have been murdered {{by a member of}} her family. A criminologist stated that <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> likely that she would have been [...] "murdered by a stranger," [...] according to statistics of [...] similar cases. The fact that she had been disposed of along with personal items reinforced this theory. The fact that there were not yet any tips from relatives with information about the child supported the idea that family members were involved with the disposal of the body—and possibly with her death. Investigators feared for other children who may have been in the care of those that disposed of the body, as they could be in danger. A different theory held that the child's family members might also be deceased, having faced a similar demise.|$|E
500|$|Writing for Slant magazine, Keith Uhlich {{gave the}} season an overall rating of four stars out of five.

Uhlich felt that the episodes in the season were [...] "challenging" [...] and celebrated the abilities {{of the individual to}} forge a life for themselves.

500|$|Potocki {{attempted}} to offer another deal to Prussia, namely, to support Prince Louis Charles of Prussia candidature for the Polish throne, but Frederick William II of Prussia, advised by Ewald Friedrich von Hertzbergm refused this offer, as <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> profitable enough to Prussia, which was interested more in territorial gains {{than in a}} potentially strengthened Commonwealth, which could ask {{for the return of}} the territories lost in the First Partition. The passing of the Constitution of 3 May, 1791, although officially applauded by Frederick Wilhem II, who sent a congratulatory note to Warsaw, caused further worry in Prussia. Prussian statesman Ewald von Hertzberg expressed the fears of European conservatives: [...] "The Poles have given the coup de grâce to the Prussian monarchy by voting a constitution", elaborating that strong Commonwealth would likely demand the return of the lands Prussia acquired in the First Partition. Finally, the Prussian-Russian relations stabilized {{with the end of the}} Triple Alliance, which was cemented by the British-Netherlands-Prussian-Russian treaty of 26 July 1791, in which the Triple Alliance de facto capitulated to all Russian demands.
