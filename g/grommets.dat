25|$|During {{the post-war}} period, Lionel {{produced}} a construction set, utilizing a unique component set. While competitive sets used {{nut and bolt}} fasteners, the Lionel set employed round-head aircraft rivets retained with rubber <b>grommets,</b> {{eliminating the need for}} tools. The structural elements were hollow beams of square cross section made from folded and quite thin sheet aluminum, as a consequence subject to destruction if stepped upon. A more substantial folded aluminum base plate was used to form the foundation of most constructions, and additional circular plates could be used to construct larger wheels or pivots. Pulleys, gussets, and splices were also included. The deluxe kits included an electric AC motor with a worm drive and reduction gearset that was powered from household power. While innovative, the lack of general purpose beam members with lots of holes limited the adaptability of the set to complex constructions. Finished assemblies also lacked the robust durability of its principal competition at the time, the Erector Set.|$|E
2500|$|The large tent, {{probably}} {{a revision of}} the SO-22 awning model, has also been called the [...] "privy tent" [...] because most models seen today have a bathroom in the rear side wall. This is a zippered, metre-square room that sticks out toward the back, and is held up by telescoping poles and guy ropes. Open <b>grommets</b> are placed near the top for ventilation.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a typical}} {{civilian}} sport parachute system, the pilot-chute {{is connected to}} a line known as the [...] "bridle", {{which in turn is}} attached to a small deployment bag that contains the folded parachute and the canopy suspension lines, which are stowed with rubber bands. At the bottom of the container that holds the deployment bag is a closing loop which, during packing, is fed through the <b>grommets</b> of the four flaps that are used to close the container. At that point, a curved pin that is attached to the bridle is inserted through the closing loop. The next step involves folding the pilot-chute and placing it in a pouch (e.g., B.O.C pouch).|$|E

50|$|The <b>grommet</b> iron, {{a form of}} toggle harpoon with an iron head, {{was used}} in some European boats at least by 1772. The {{pivoting}} head and the shaft of this harpoon were held parallel {{by means of a}} <b>grommet</b> banded around them. The <b>grommet</b> slid off when the iron penetrated the whale (or fish), allowing the head to toggle open as the barb caught in the tissue.|$|R
2500|$|Activation {{begins when}} the pilot-chute is thrown out. It inflates and creates drag, pulling the pin {{out of the}} closing loop and {{allowing}} the pilot-chute to pull the deployment bag from the container. The parachute lines are pulled loose from the rubber bands and extend as the canopy starts to open. A rectangular piece of fabric called the [...] "slider" [...] (which separates the parachute lines into four main groups fed through <b>grommets</b> in the four respective corners of the slider) slows {{the opening of the}} parachute and works its way down until the canopy is fully open and the slider is just above the head of the skydiver. The slider slows and controls the deployment of the parachute. Without a slider, the parachute would inflate fast, potentially damaging the parachute fabric and/or suspension lines, as well as causing discomfort, injury or even death of the jumper. During a normal deployment, a skydiver will generally experience a few seconds of intense deceleration, in the realm of 3 to 4 g, while the parachute slows the descent from [...] to approximately 28km/h (17mph).|$|E
2500|$|In 1969, {{the family}} {{returned}} to the United Kingdom, settling into Stanley's family farm at Nethercote, near Winsford in Exmoor. At Nethercote, Johnson gained his first experiences with fox hunting. Stanley was regularly absent from Nethercote, leaving Johnson to be raised largely by his mother and au pairs. As a child, Johnson was quiet and studious, although he suffered from severe deafness, resulting in several operations to insert <b>grommets</b> into his ears. He and his siblings were encouraged to engage in high-brow activities from a young age, with high achievement being greatly valued; Johnson's earliest recorded ambition was to be [...] "world king". Having few or no friends other than their siblings, the children became very close. In late 1969 the family relocated to Maida Vale, North London, where Stanley began post-doctoral research at the London School of Economics. In 1970, Charlotte and the children briefly returned to Nethercote, where Johnson was schooled at the Winsford Village School, before returning to London to settle in Primrose Hill, there being educated at Primrose Hill Primary School. In late 1971 another son, Jo Johnson, was born to the family.|$|E
2500|$|The stripes {{are about}} four inches wide. The tent itself is {{about four feet}} wide by three feet deep, and inside {{headroom}} is well over six feet. A long white zipper runs up {{the middle of the}} front, while the back is open and contoured to fit the bus. The frame consists of four metal poles which fit into pockets inside the top of the tent and lock together to form a square. Legs on two of the poles fit into brackets which were bolted to the camper's roof. Two additional poles dogleg into the top frame and have small chain-hooks to hold the doors open. The lower ends of these poles fit into holes in the jack supports. Rubber <b>grommets</b> help protect the paint on the doors and the jack points. The lower edge of the tent is secured to the ground with about a dozen metal stakes. Each stake is about six inches long and is formed from hardened 1/4" [...] rods with a loop at one end. Two storage bags made of (usually matching) canvas with leather straps are supplied for the tent and poles.|$|E
40|$|Otitis {{media with}} {{effusion}} {{is one of}} the most common childhood infections, and <b>grommet</b> insertions are done for chronic otitis media which have failed medical therapy. The aims of this study were 1) to determine the patient profile of children needing <b>grommet</b> insertion and 2) to determine if <b>grommet</b> insertion is safe and effective. A retrospective review of 105 children with myringotomy and <b>grommet</b> insertions for chronic otitis media with effusion between 2006 and 2008 was performed. Seventy two percent of patients were younger than 6 years old. Male to female ratio was 4 : 3. Twelve percent of patients were syndromic. In children with otitis media with effusion, hearing and academic performance improved after <b>grommet</b> insertion.

2500|$|The {{pressurised}} {{cabin was}} used to counter the physiological problems encountered by pilots at high altitudes. The cabin was not like the fully pressurised cabin of a modern airliner; the pressure differential provided by the modified cockpit of the VI was only two {{pounds per square inch}} (which was double the Air Ministry requirement). To achieve this, the forward and rear cockpit bulkheads were completely enclosed, with all control and electrical cables exiting though special rubber sealing <b>grommets.</b> In addition, the side cockpit door was replaced with alloy skin and the canopy was no longer a sliding unit: externally there were no slide rails. Once the pilot was in, the canopy was locked in place with four toggles and sealed with an inflatable rubber tube. It could be jettisoned by the pilot in an emergency. The windscreen of production Mk VIs was the same as the type fitted to the Mark III and some Mk Vs although it was fitted with an inward opening clear-view panel on the port quarter pane. The effect was to make [...] seem like [...] to the pilot, who would still have to wear an oxygen mask. Pressurisation was achieved by a Marshall-manufactured compressor located on the starboard side of the engine, fed by a long intake below the starboard exhaust stubs. Mk VIs were built with the Coffman cartridge starter, with a small teardrop fairing just ahead of the compressor intake.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{see whether}} there is a {{relation}} between <b>grommet</b> insertion operation and tonsillectomy rates, otolaryngology services, and deprivation scores in Scotland. DESIGN [...] Analysis of routine 1990 NHS data on <b>grommet</b> insertions and tonsillectomies in Scottish children aged 0 - 15 years compared with data on general practitioner and otolaryngology services and Carstairs deprivation scores. SETTING [...] All 15 Scottish health boards. SUBJECTS [...] All children aged 0 - 15 (1, 021, 933). RESULTS [...] Tonsillectomy was more common than <b>grommet</b> insertion operations in Scotland (6182 : 4850). Health boards with high <b>grommet</b> insertion rates {{were more likely to have}} low tonsillectomy rates (Spearman's rank correlation - 0. 59; 95 % confidence interval - 0. 87 to - 0. 03). <b>Grommet</b> insertion rates varied fourfold (from 2. 4 / 1000 to 9. 2 / 1000) and tonsillectomy rates twofold (from 3. 6 / 1000 to 8. 0 / 1000) across Scottish health boards. Variation between health boards had changed over the 15 years 1975 - 90. Variation in <b>grommet</b> insertion rates did not reflect variation in the supply of otolaryngology consultants (Spearman's rank correlation - 0. 25). There was a non-significant tendency for high general practitioner referral rates to be associated with high <b>grommet</b> insertion rates, low tonsillectomy rates, and less deprived areas (Spearman's rank correlation coefficients 0. 50, - 0. 53, and - 0. 43). Deprivation (measured by Carstairs scoring for each health board) was associated with higher tonsillectomy rates (Spearman's rank correlation 0. 41; 95 % confidence interval - 0. 22 to 0. 80) and significantly lower <b>grommet</b> insertion rates (- 0. 73; - 0. 92 to - 0. 28). CONCLUSION [...] Social factors as well as differences in disease prevalence and medical practice need to be considered when studying variation in childhood <b>grommet</b> insertion and tonsillectomy rates...|$|R
