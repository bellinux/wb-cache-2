A Russian <b>establishment</b> analyst <b>commented</b> that NATO needed Montenegro for launching a hybrid war and destabilising Europe. Tensions between the countries increased dramatically thereafter, with Montenegro accusing Russia of meddling in its internal affairs and banning entry to specified Russian nationals, including such top Russian officials as Dmitry Rogozin, Nikolai Patrushev, and Ramzan Kadyrov.|$|R
40|$|In Spring 2012 an {{exhibition}} celebrating the thirtieth {{anniversary of the}} Welsh band Datblygu opened in a small coffee shop in Cardiff. Formed in Cardigan, west Wales, by poet David R. Edwards, Datblygu cultivated throughout their career a willfully contrary relationship with the Welsh-language <b>establishment,</b> while <b>commenting</b> from the margins of Wales on the reality {{of life in the}} Thatcher era. Stylistically more aligned with The Fall than with any of their Welsh contemporaries, Datblygu were intellectually concerned with nothing less than an honest commentary on Welsh life: abrasive, splenetic and in some ways prophetic. Datblygu were championed by BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel, but {{it was only in the}} past decade that their influence has been properly charted, with many younger bands and musicians registering the effect of Datblygu’s dark insights. In this paper I consider the importance of a reassessment of Datblygu’s output from this temporal remove – what Karl Mannheim called ‘the sociological problem of generations’ – and the phenomenon of the Datblygu anniversary celebration itself – a shift from the radical margins to a central geographical place...|$|R
5000|$|Hand {{received}} {{national attention}} when he ruled {{for the plaintiffs}} in a case against the Alabama school board claiming that textbooks used in Alabama promoted secular humanism, and as such were {{in violation of the}} Establishment clause. In his 172-page ruling, he ordered the removal of forty-four texts across the state in subjects such as history and social studies. [...] The case was brought in Hand's district after his opinions regarding an 1982 school prayer ruling in Alabama. The Eleventh Circuit Court unanimously reversed him, with Judge Frank stating that Hand held a [...] "misconception of the relationship between church and state mandated by the <b>establishment</b> clause," [...] <b>commenting</b> also that the textbooks did not show [...] "an attitude antagonistic to theistic belief. The message conveyed by these textbooks is one of neutrality: the textbooks neither endorse theistic religion as a system of belief, nor discredit it." ...|$|R
2500|$|In the 1987 case of Smith v. Board of School Commissioners of Mobile County a {{group of}} plaintiffs brought a case alleging that the school system was {{teaching}} the tenets of an anti-religious religion called [...] "secular humanism" [...] {{in violation of the}} Establishment Clause. The complainants asked that 44 different elementary through high school level textbooks (including books on home economics, social science and literature) be removed from the curriculum. Federal judge William Brevard Hand ruled for the plaintiffs agreeing that the books promoted secular humanism, which he ruled to be a religion.

2500|$|Before {{they perform}} their project {{on a grand}} scale, they decide to get some {{experience}} by dressing a small business of all-female driving instructors in uniform. A uniform had been optional, {{but all of the}} instructors were keen on the idea. The duo's next step is re-designing the uniform of the catering department at the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend. To get a feel of what it is like working in these uniforms, Trinny and Susannah spend a few hours working at the <b>establishment.</b> One worker <b>commented</b> [...] "We were surprised. Although they are quite posh, they did have a go. They weren't too worried about slops. Although Susannah did say it was making her ill." [...] Before the renewal of the uniform, it consisted of old-fashioned mismatched items, until it was replaced by matching pink gingham outfits. Then came the task of designing a practical outfit for the Somerfield workers. When the items are made, selected members of Somerfield model the catwalk in the fruit & veg section.|$|R
40|$|This study {{addresses}} the taxation issues arising from a cross-border pipeline. The first element that is addressed is the different possible classifications of a pipeline for tax purposes. The {{fact that the}} Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) {{does not provide a}} universal classification for a cross-border pipeline, leaves tax authorities in the various jurisdictions to interpret and classify the pipeline as they see fit. This lack of consistent classification may give rise to double taxation or even double non-taxation. The study explores the definition of a permanent establishment (“PE”) and analyses the elements of the definition in terms of the OECD Model Tax Convention (“MTC”) and the OECD Commentary on Article 5. In this study the assumption is made that the classification of a cross-border pipeline is that it falls within the ambit of Article 5 and should therefore be treated as a PE. If the cross-border pipeline is classified as a PE for taxation purposes the attribution of profits arising from the PE will be attributed in terms of Article 7 of the OECD MTC. In the study the attribution of profits relating to the PE created by the presence of a cross-border pipeline in various jurisdictions is analysed. The attribution of such profits can result in difficulties in determining the exact amount attributable to each of the jurisdictions which the pipeline spans. The author considers the OECD Reports (2008 and 2010 Reports) on the Attribution of Profits to Permanent <b>Establishments</b> to <b>comment</b> on whether the reports provide adequate guidance for attributing profits to such a unique situation as that of a cross-border pipeline. It is also addressed whether the attribution of profits to a cross-border pipeline can be dealt with under the general principles of attribution. Case law is also considered, in particular, the German Pipeline Decision which determined whether an underground pipeline can constitute a PE under German domestic law and under the DTA between the Netherlands and Germany. In the conclusion research indicates that there is room for development and further guidance from the OECD in its MTC and Commentary as this is a unique and potentially complex situation that cannot be placed under general provisions or left unaddressed. The current lack of guidance can result in different classifications of the cross-border pipeline which effectively results in adverse tax consequences in different jurisdictions and uncertainty to the taxpayer.

40|$|Aquênios (sementes) recém coletados, de treze espécies nativas de Asteraceae comuns nos ambientes abertos da região sul do Brasil foram testados quanto à germinação em temperaturas alternadas (20 / 10; 25 / 15; 30 / 20; 35 / 25 °C) e sob temperaturas constantes (20; 25 e 30 °C) com ou sem luz. A temperatura ótima para germinação varia entre as espécies, sendo que as espécies Elephantopus mobilis; Eupatorium laevigatum; Mikania cordifolia; Senecio oxyphyllus; Trixis prastens germinam de forma semelhante em todas temperaturas testadas. Eclipta alba tem sua germinação promovida a 30 °C. Tagetes minuta tem a germinação das sementes promovida a 20 °C. Em Senecio heterotrichius; S. selloi; Stenachaenium campestre; Symphyopappus casarettoi e Vernonia nudiflora as sementes germinam igualmente a 20 ou 25 °C [...] A luz promoveu a germinação de todas espécies exceto para Stenachaenium campestre e Tagetes minuta, sendo esta última espécie fotoblástica negativa. Quanto ao tempo médio de germinação, as espécies podem ser divididas em; rápidas- menos de 5 dias (Baccharis trimera; Eclipta alba; Elephantopus mollis; Stenachaenium campestre e Vernonia nudiflora); intermediárias: entre 5 e 10 dias (Eupatorium laevigatum; Mikania cordifolia e Tagetes minuta); lentas: mais de 10 dias (Senecio heterotrichius; S. oxyphyllus; S. selloi; Symphyopappus casarettoi e Trixis praestans). Os resultados mostram que a germinação de sementes de Asteraceas variam com a temperatura e o regime de luz; podendo prover uma base inicial para interpretação de efeitos sazonais sobre a germinação e estabelecimento a campo. Em adição, comentários sobre o substrato ágar ou areia são feitos. Achenes of {{thirteen}} native Asteraceae species {{common to the}} natural grassland or weeds of the southern region of Brazil were tested for germination over a range of alternating temperatures (20 / 10; 25 / 15; 30 / 20 and 35 / 25 °C), and under constant temperatures (20; 25 and 30 °C) with light or not. Only fresh collected achenes (herein = seeds) were used. The optimum temperature for germination differed among the species, with Elephantopus mobillis; Eupatorium laevigatum; Mikania cordifolia; Senecio oxyphyllus; Trixis praestans germinating the most over all temperatures tested. Eclipta alba seeds germination was promoted at 30 °C. Colder treatments promoted germination in Tagetes minuta, and in Senecio heterotrichius; S. selloi; Stenachaenium campestre; Symphyopappus casarettoi and Vernonia nudiflora germination was equivalent at 20 or 25 °C. Light promoted germination for all species except in Stenachaenium campestre and Tagetes minuta, the latter being a negative photoblastic species. According to the mean time for germination, the species could be ranked in: fast -less than 5 days- (Baccharis trimera; Eclipta alba; Elephantopus mollis; Stenachaenium campestre and Vernonia nudiflora); intermediate: between 5 and 10 days- (Eupatorium laevigatum; Mikania cordifolia and Tagetes minuta); slow: more than 10 days-(Senecio heterotrichius; S. oxyphyllus; S. selloi; Symphyopappus casarettoi; Trixis praestans). The results show that germination of seeds {{of a range of}} Asteraceae species varies with temperature and light regime; they provide an initial basis on which to test and interpret the effects of seasonal factors on germination and field <b>establishment.</b> In addition, <b>comments</b> on the agar and sand substrates were made...|$|R
