5|$|Rotaviruses infect {{the young}} of {{many species of}} animals {{and they are a}} major cause of {{diarrhoea}} in wild and reared animals worldwide. As a pathogen of livestock, notably in young calves and piglets, rotaviruses cause economic loss to farmers because of costs of treatment associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. These rotaviruses are a potential reservoir for <b>genetic</b> <b>exchange</b> with human rotaviruses. There is evidence that animal rotaviruses can infect humans, either by direct transmission of the virus or by contributing one or several RNA segments to reassortants with human strains.|$|E
5|$|Fire {{response}} {{may also}} furnish {{an explanation for}} the evolution of this species. The differences in fire regime between dune crests and swales would have created different evolutionary pressures, with plants on crests adapting to frequent hot fires by becoming strongly serotinous, and plants in swales adapting to patchier, cooler fires with weaker serotiny. Speciation would be made possible by the much reduced <b>genetic</b> <b>exchange</b> between crest plants and swale plants, although evidence suggests that there was some introgression at first. Eventually, however, the need for weakly serotinous plants to produce ripe seed by the bushfire season would have brought forward its flowering season until the flowering seasons no longer overlapped; thus a phenological barrier to exchange was erected, allowing the two populations to drift independently of each other.|$|E
5|$|In The American Species of Crepis, Babcock and Stebbins {{described}} {{the concept of}} the polyploid complex, and its role in plant evolution. Some genera, such as Crepis, have a complex of reproductive forms that center on sexually diploid populations that have also given rise to polyploid ones. Babcock and Stebbins also observed that allopolyploid types formed from the hybridization of two different species always have a wider distribution than diploid or autotetraploid species, and proposed that polyploids formed through hybridization have a greater potential to exploit varied environments, because they inherit all traits from both parents. They also showed that hybridization in the polyploid complex could provide a mechanism for <b>genetic</b> <b>exchange</b> between diploid species that were otherwise unable to breed. Their observations offered insight into species formation and knowledge of how all these complex processes could provide information on the history of a genus. This monograph was described by Swedish botanist Åke Gustafsson as the most important work on the formation of species during that period.|$|E

For pearl millet, the pattern of varietal and genetic diversity strongly suggests that <b>genetic</b> <b>exchanges</b> between landraces grown by the different socio-linguistic groups along the Lake Chad Basin are surprisingly limited. Bambara groundnut displays an opposite pattern, despite the limited dispersal of its genes by pollen flow.

25|$|Interracial {{marriage}} and interracial sex and, more generally, {{the process of}} racial admixture, has its origins in prehistory. Racial mixing became widespread during European colonialism in the Age of Discovery. <b>Genetic</b> <b>exchange</b> between two populations reduces the genetic distance between the populations and is measurable in DNA patterns. During the Age of Discovery, {{beginning in the late}} 15th century, European explorers sailed the oceans, eventually reaching all the major continents. During this time Europeans contacted many populations, some of which had been relatively isolated for millennia. The genetic demographic composition of the Eastern Hemisphere has not changed significantly since the Age of Discovery. However, genetic demographics in the Western Hemisphere were radically altered by events following the voyages of Christopher Columbus. The European colonization of the Americas brought contact between peoples of Europe, Africa and Asia and the Amerindian populations. As a result, the Americas today have significant and complex multiracial populations. Many individuals who self-identify as one race exhibit genetic evidence of a multiracial ancestry.|$|E
25|$|Speciation is the lineage-splitting {{event that}} results in two {{separate}} species forming from a single common ancestral population. A widely accepted method of speciation is called allopatric speciation. Allopatric speciation begins when a population becomes geographically separated. Geological processes, such as the emergence of mountain ranges, the formation of canyons, or the flooding of land bridges by changes in sea level may result in separate populations. For speciation to occur, separation must be substantial, so that <b>genetic</b> <b>exchange</b> between the two populations is completely disrupted. In their separate environments, the genetically isolated groups follow their own unique evolutionary pathways. Each group will accumulate different mutations as well as be subjected to different selective pressures. The accumulated genetic changes may result in separated populations that can no longer interbreed if they are reunited. Barriers that prevent interbreeding are either prezygotic (prevent mating or fertilisation) or postzygotic (barriers that occur after fertilisation). If interbreeding is no longer possible, then they will be considered different species. The result of four billion years of evolution is the diversity of life around us, with an estimated 1.75million different species in existence today.|$|E
25|$|According to the X-Chromosome SNP analyses, {{the authors}} {{reported}} a high genetic homogeneity between berbers and Arabs in NW Africa, so {{they suggested that}} the Arabisation of this area was a cultural phenomenon, which did not imply a replacement of the ancestry population. Our results give support the hypothesis of an early settlement of northwest Africa. The original berber population seem to have received a low genetic influx from the surrounding areas. Different hypothesis have been suggested to explain the genetic differentiation of the Moroccan population. An initial genetic drift could have caused differences in allele frequency distribution {{that have not been}} re-established due to a certain level of geographic isolation. The Strait of Gibraltar has been described by several authors as an important genetic barrier. Even a certain level of <b>genetic</b> <b>exchange</b> probably occurred between NW Africa and the South of the Iberian Peninsula, sharp frequency changes have been described in this area. Also the Sahara desert has been suggested as responsible of the genetic isolation of NW African populations from Sub-Saharan populations. There is no consensus {{about the impact of the}} Neolithic demic diffusion in the Mediterranean area. According to our results, a low impact of the Neolithic expansions and/or later migration events on NW African populations would have occurred.|$|E
40|$|Although strict asexuality is {{supposed}} to be an evolutionary dead end, morphological, cytogenetic, and genomic data suggest that bdelloid rotifers, a clade of microscopic animals, have persisted and diversified for more than 60 Myr in an ameiotic fashion. Moreover, the genome of bdelloids of the genus Adineta comprises 8 %- 10 % of genes of putative non-metazoan origin, indicating that horizontal gene transfers are frequent within this group and suggesting that this mechanism may also promote <b>genetic</b> <b>exchanges</b> among bdelloids as well. To test this hypothesis, we used five independent sequence markers to study the genetic diversity of 576 Adineta vaga individuals from a park in Belgium. Haplowebs and GMYC analyses revealed the existence of six species among our sampled A. vaga individuals, with strong evidence of both intra- and interspecific recombination. Comparison of genomic regions of three allele-sharing individuals further revealed signatures of <b>genetic</b> <b>exchanges</b> scattered among regions evolving asexually. Our findings suggest that bdelloids evolve asexually but exchange DNA horizontally both within and between species. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|Based on Darwin’s {{concept of}} the tree of life, {{vertical}} inheritance {{was thought to be}} dominant, and mutations, deletions and duplication were streaming the genomes of living organisms. In the current genomic era, increasing data indicated that both vertical and lateral gene inheritance interact in space and time to trigger genome evolution, particularly among microorganisms sharing a given ecological niche. As a paradigm to their diversity and their survival in a variety of cell types, intracellular microorganisms, and notably intracellular bacteria, were considered as less prone to lateral <b>genetic</b> <b>exchanges.</b> Such specialized microorganisms generally have a smaller gene repertoire because they do rely on their host’s factors for some basic regulatory and metabolic functions.

The role of <b>genetic</b> <b>exchanges</b> has been questioned for over twenty years and their recent experimental demonstration along with the identification of interspecific hybrids in natura has revived this debate. After arguing that <b>genetic</b> <b>exchanges</b> were exceptional and did not contribute to Leishmania evolution, it is currently proposed that interspecific exchanges could be a major driving force for rapid adaptation to new reservoirs and vectors, expansion into new parasitic cycles and adaptation to new life conditions. To assess the existence of gene flows between species during evolution we used MLSA-based (MultiLocus Sequence Analysis) approach to analyze 222 Leishmania strains from Africa and Eurasia to accurately represent the genetic diversity of this genus. We observed a remarkable congruence of the phylogenetic signal and identified seven genetic clusters that include mainly independent lineages which are accumulating divergences without any sign of recent interspecific recombination. From a taxonomic point of view, the strong genetic structuration of the different species does not question the current classification, except for species that cause visceral forms of leishmaniasis (L. donovani, L. infantum and L. archibaldi).

40|$|We {{have found}} that human and ape ribosomal genes undergo concerted {{evolution}} involving <b>genetic</b> <b>exchanges</b> among nucleolus organizers on nonhomologous chromosomes. This conclusion is based upon restriction enzyme analysis of the ribosomal gene families in man and five ape species. Certain structural features were found to differ among (but not within) species even though the ribosomal genes have a multichromosomal distribution. <b>Genetic</b> <b>exchanges</b> among nucleolus organizer regions {{may be related to}} the well-known phenomenon of acrocentric chromosome associations observed in man and apes. Length variation in a region of the nontranscribed spacer was found in both chimpanzee species we examined. The nature of this length variation was found to be identical to that previously described in man. The origin of the length variation and its polymorphism within these three species might be explained by unequal alignment and unequal cross-over among the ribosomal genes. An especially surprising finding was a nucleotide sequence polymorphism present in each individual human and ape we examined. Some ribosomal genes of each individual have a HindII site in the 28 S gene about 800 base pairs from the EcoRI site in this gene. The remaining 28 S genes lack this HindII site.
