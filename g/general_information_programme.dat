40|$|Unesco, {{which has}} been {{concerned}} with information matters since its foundation in 1946, created the <b>General</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Programme,</b> PGI, ten years ago. The occasion deserves {{a few moments of}} reflection. Let us briefly look back into history &mdash; and into the future. The nineteenth session of the General Conference of Unesco, held in Nairobi from 26 October to 30 November 1976, approved the creation of the <b>General</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Programme</b> (officially abbreviated as ’PGI ’ from its name in French, ’Programme g 6 n 6 ral d’information’) covering Unesco’s activities in the fields of scientific and technological information, {{as well as those of}} documentation, libraries and archives. The Conference also established the Intergovernmental Council for the <b>General</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Programme</b> and entrusted it with responsibility for guiding the conception and planning of the programme, in particular by making recommendations on the content of the biennial programmes and budgets and the Medium-Term Plans, reviewing the results achieved, recommending priorities and encouraging the participation of Member States in the implementation of the programme. The five main themes of the <b>General</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Programme</b> were identified by the General Conference as: 1. Promotion of the formulation of information policies and plans (national, regional and international); 2. Promotion and dissemination of methods, norms and standards for information-handling; 3. Contribution to the development of information infrastructures; 4. Contribution to the development of specialized information systems in the fields of education, culture and communication, and the natural and social sciences; 5. Promotion of the training and education of specialists in and users of information. (2...|$|E

40|$|To {{talk about}} {{information}} work and libraries {{in developing countries}} is perhaps presumptuous. Conditions are so different in different countries of the world. One talks of 2 ̆ 7 Africa 2 ̆ 7, {{but it is difficult}} to generalise - is one thinking of West Africa or East Africa. Even within regions, there are considerable differences: compare Francophone and Anglophone West Africa, for instance. Even within countries, of course there are differences: in Nigeria there are nineteen states, created because of local distinctions and differences. Division by religion is another factor but then a religion can be different in different ways: Christianity differs from place to place, as does Mohammedism or Buddhism. Yet it is possible to make some generalisations. The development of an infrastructure is an econornical necessity for all developing countries. It must be based on a realistic appraisal of what exists. In most countries of this type, there is a hierarchy of libraries from special libraries (frequently of a good standard) to public or school libraries (frequently non-existant). Communications amongst them will depend on the communication standards of the country. A major problem is that attraction of appropriate and qualified personnel, and education and training varies, and can also be a problem. The Unesco programmes - Unisist and Natis - now unified into the <b>General</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Programme</b> have influenced development. In a recent Loughborough PhD thesis, Choi Jung Sin of Korea, examined information and library systems in advanced developing countries. He found that in many countries there are national committees, but that their role (and effectiveness) varies. Information centres and services are found in most countries, starting from the general service and developing into specialised services. The concentration is on science and technology (especially agriculture and medicine). The standard of archive repositories is also variable. The mechanisation of work in National Information Centres is in its infancy. Obstacles to development are shortage of qualified staff, lack of a national policy, insufficient funding, lack of coordination and lack of user education. Improvement of education and manpower planning is essential, as are clearer concepts of professional service. Much data needs to be collected by research workers, but the most effective work must be done by the nationals of the countries themselves...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{follow up on}} a earlier one (Mendes, 1998) where I {{proposed}} a series of models for forest owners associations represented as organisation made up of two groups of strategically interacting players: the forest owners {{who are members of}} the association and the board of directors they have elected. The directors decide on the amount of services provided by the association which can be public goods (collective representation of the members, promotion of their common interests, diffusion of <b>general</b> <b>information</b> about forest <b>programmes</b> and best forest management practices, etc.) and private goods and services (silvicultural works preventive of forest fires, technical advice, etc.). The models were set up as games in strategic form with complete information and no payoff uncertainty. Here I pick up the second of, what is called in that previous paper, the "Portuguese" models and extend it in the following directions: - there is payoff risk for the forest owners due to exogenous hazards (forest fires or others); - forest owners can buy private services from the owners which contribute to reduce the losses resulting from those hazards. The main focus in this paper is to derive the comparative static results about the demand of these private services by the forest owners. forest owners’ associations, public and private goods joint supply, game theory...|$|R

40|$|The JTI/SLU’s Farm Machinery Cost Estimator is a {{user-friendly}} {{computer program}} developed in Excel 2000 for Personal Computers in Swedish language. The program {{is able to}} estimate the cost for a single machine or/and total machinery costs (specific machinery + labour + timeliness costs) for a set. The program is composed of seven sheets of which two are hidden: o Start sheet: with <b>general</b> <b>information</b> on the <b>programme.</b> o Condition sheet: with basic data on the farm and other general parameters for the calculation. o Calculation sheet for estimating costs for one machine at a time. o Summary sheet where {{the results from the}} calculation sheet can be saved. o Timeliness sheet for timeliness cost estimation for the sowing and harvesting operations. o Machinery data sheet (hidden sheet) : a database with basic information for the calculation on individual machines and machinery type. o A hidden sheet (PInfo) for temporary data saving during the programme running. The Estimator has nine different pop-up windows for helping estimating field machinery capacity and fuel consumption more accuracy according to the farm conditions. In addition, there is an optimisation module for estimating optimal width for some implement types and grain harvesters. In all visible sheets, there are information buttons and Comments on the most important data to be entered and the calculation methods used. The Estimator has been tested by researchers and farmers. In a series of tests, where labour and machinery costs were estimated for more than 30 farms, it showed to be easy to use and sound cost estimations were obtained.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{introduction}} of electronic patient records that are accessible by multiple providers raises security issues and requires informed consent - {{or at the}} very least, an opportunity to opt out. Introduction of the Summary Care Record (SCR) (a centrally stored electronic summary of a patient's medical record) in pilot sites in the UK was associated with low awareness, despite an intensive public <b>information</b> <b>programme</b> that included letters, posters, leaflets, and road shows. AIM: To understand why the public <b>information</b> <b>programme</b> had limited impact and to learn lessons for future programmes. METHODS: Linguistic and communications analysis of components of the programme, contextualized within a wider mixed-method case study of the {{introduction of}} the SCR in pilot sites. Theoretical insights from linguistics and communication studies were applied. RESULTS: The context of the SCR pilots and the linked <b>information</b> <b>programme</b> created inherent challenges which were partially but not fully overcome by the efforts of campaigners. Much effort was put into designing the content of a mail merge letter, but less attention was given to its novelty, linguistic style, and rhetorical appeal. Many recipients viewed this letter as junk mail or propaganda and discarded it unread. Other components of the <b>information</b> <b>programme</b> were characterized by low visibility, partly because only restricted areas were participating in the pilot. Relatively little use was made of interpersonal communication channels. CONCLUSION: Despite ethical and legal imperatives, informed consent for the introduction of shared electronic records may be difficult to achieve through public information campaigns. Success may be more likely if established principles of effective mass and interpersonal communication are applied...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{experiences of}} conducting an <b>information</b> <b>programme</b> for milk {{farmers in the}} Maskeliya plantation area, Sri Lanka by the Public Library Maskeliya, with the primary objective of facilitating grass-root level communities to access information. Information and data for the paper was collected from a mini survey of feed back of the participants and also from secondary sources. The broad objective of the <b>information</b> <b>programme</b> was to create an information platform for the milk farmers to obtain vital information needed for their livelihood. Specific objectives were to educate milk farmers on cattle diseases and how to control them; to make them aware of obtaining accurate and reliable information and the available mass media sources for information and {{to provide information about}} livestock training programmes conducted by the Dept. of Animal Production and Health. The performances and the constraints of the livestock sector is discussed. The need for public libraries intervention with the grass-root level communities for expansion of their capacities is emphasised. The Maskeliya Public Library was chosen for the <b>information</b> <b>programme</b> {{because of the presence of}} dairy farmers in the area. The <b>information</b> <b>programme</b> was organized with the collaboration of the AGRINET librarians, the Ambagamuwa Pradeshiya Sabhawa, the government veterinary surgeon, estate managers of the tea plantains and Maskeliya Public Library Readers Club. The <b>information</b> <b>programme</b> consisted of two presentations, a CD-ROM demonstration, a display of farmer focused publications and free distribution of an information package. The challenges of the programme were the linguistic problem and the literacy level. An interpreter was used to communicate the presentations in Tamil language. One hundred milk farmers, which was 10 % of total milk farmers in the area attended the programme. Written feedback was collected from 55 farmers who could write. The major problem faced by milk farmers were cattle shed problems, low milk prices, lack of medical facilities, cattle feed problems, low incomes etc. The public librarians were required to build up partnership with influential people and institutes in the area through professional lobbying. Language skills of the public librarians were a requirement to reach out to grass-root level...|$|R
