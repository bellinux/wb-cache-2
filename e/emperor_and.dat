5|$|As a {{constitutional}} monarch, his education was {{followed closely by}} the National Assembly, which demanded from Itanhaém progress reports concerning his studies. During this time, Pedro II was kept unaware of events occurring outside the palace, including political matters. News which did intrude upon the <b>emperor</b> <b>and</b> his sisters concerned deaths within their family. In December 1834, they learned of the early and unanticipated death of their father. A few months later their grandfather Francis II, who had shown great interest in his grandchildren, died (June 1835). These losses drew the <b>emperor</b> <b>and</b> his sisters closer together and strengthened their sense of family, {{despite the absence of}} their parents.|$|E

5|$|For two {{or three}} days, Rome {{remained}} without an emperor. By April 11, Macrinus had proclaimed himself <b>emperor</b> <b>and</b> assumed all of the imperial titles and powers, without waiting for the Senate. The army backed his claim as <b>emperor</b> <b>and</b> the Senate, so far away, was powerless to intervene. Macrinus never returned to Rome as <b>emperor</b> <b>and</b> remained based in Antioch {{for the duration of}} his reign. Macrinus was the first emperor to hail from the equestrian class, rather than the senatorial and also the first emperor of Mauretanian descent. He adopted the name of Severus, in honor of the Severan dynasty, and conferred the imperial title of Augusta to his wife Nonia Celsa and the title of Caesar and name of Antoninus to his son Diadumenianus in honor of the Antonine dynasty, thus making him second in command. At the time of Diadumenian's accession he was eight years old.|$|E

MacArthur confirmed that the emperor's abdication would not be necessary.
