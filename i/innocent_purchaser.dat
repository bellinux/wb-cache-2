This instrument reinforces the provisions of the 1970 Convention, supplementing them by formulating minimal legal rules on the restitution and return of cultural objects. It finds a solution to some of the problems of private law which were interfering with the implementation of the provisions of the 1970 Convention (notably problems linked to the bona fide acquisition (cf article 7 (b) (ii) referring to an <b>innocent</b> <b>purchaser)).</b> As a consequence, the two Conventions are both compatible and complementary to one another.|$|E

5000|$|In the United States, a {{life estate}} is {{typically}} {{used as a}} tool of an estate planning. A life estate can avoid probate and ensure that an intended heir will receive title to real property. For example, Al owns a home and desires that Bill inherit it after Al's death. Al can effectuate that desire by transferring title to the home to Bill and retaining a life estate in the home. Al keeps a life estate and Bill receives a vested fee simple remainder. As soon as Al dies, the life estate interest merges with Bill's remainder, and Bill has a fee simple title. Such a transfer risks the small risk of a fraud on the part of beneficiary Bill if he could easily show in a particular jurisdiction an unfettered fee simple, selling the estate prematurely to an <b>innocent</b> <b>purchaser</b> such as when Al is on vacation but makes the use of a will unnecessary and eliminates the need to probate the asset. A second disadvantage to the grantor is that provision for any remainderman (or men) (party C) is irrevocable without the remainderman's consent. [...] "Beneficiary deeds" [...] have been statutorily created in some states to address this issue.|$|E
5000|$|The harsh {{effect of}} this rule, {{and its effect on}} <b>innocent</b> <b>purchasers,</b> led many jurisdictions to enact lis pendens {{statutes}} requiring a written notice, usually recorded in the land records where the real estate is located, for the notice provisions of the rule to be effective. Typically, a separate recorded instrument is required by statute if the lawsuit in question affects title to real property. If the statutory requirements are met, the world is put on [...] "constructive notice" [...] of the existence of the suit, and any person acquiring an interest later does so subject to the outcome of the suit.|$|R
40|$|It is {{not unusual}} for a Delaware corporation’s stock records to have {{omissions}} or procedural defects raising questions as to the valid authorization of some of the outstanding stock. Confronted with such irregularities, most corporate lawyers would likely attempt to cure the defect through board and, if necessary, stockholder ratification. However, in a number of leading cases, the Delaware Supreme Court has treated the statutory formalities for the issuance of stock as substantive prerequisites to the validity of the stock being issued, and the court has determined that failure to comply with such formalities renders the stock in question void, i. e., not curable by ratification. Unfortunately, the decisions issued by the Delaware courts have not afforded the necessary certainty to allow practitioners to decide whether a particular defect in stock issuance is a substantive defect that renders stock void or a mere technical defect that renders stock voidable. This Article analyzes the cases giving rise to this lack of clarity and proposes that the Delaware courts apply the policy underlying Article 8 of the Delaware Uniform Commercial Code to validate stock in the hands of <b>innocent</b> <b>purchasers</b> for value in determining whether stock is void or voidable...|$|R
40|$|Under what {{circumstances}} can a {{sale of goods}} by a person, who is not {{the owner of the}} goods, nonetheless confer good title on the purchaser? The common law rule “nemo dat quod non habet” embodies the principle that the transferee of goods cannot get better title than that of the transferor. In other words, if goods are sold by a person who does not have title to the goods (for example, because he had obtained the goods by theft), then he would be unable to pass title to a subsequent purchaser since he did not have title to begin with. The nemo dat rule thus protects the true or original owner of goods. One of the exceptions to this rule under the Hong Kong Sale of Goods Ordinance is the market overt exception, which seeks to protect <b>innocent</b> <b>purchasers.</b> This article first considers the meanings of and rationales behind the nemo dat rule and the market overt exception respectively. Problems with the existing market overt exception will next be discussed. A suggestion will then be made that the market overt exception be replaced with a rule that protects innocent buyers who deal as consumers and who have purchased goods from shops or markets in Hong Kong...|$|R
5000|$|Asbestos is {{not part}} of an ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) E 1527-05 Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA). A {{building}} survey for asbestos is considered an out-of-scope consideration under the industry standard ASTM 1527-05 Phase I ESA (see ASTM E 1527-05). ASTM Standard E 2356-04 should be consulted by the owner or owner's agent to determine which type of asbestos building survey is appropriate, typically either a baseline survey or a design survey of functional areas. Both types of surveys are explained in detail under ASTM Standard E 2356-04. Typically, a baseline survey is performed by an EPA (or state) licensed asbestos inspector. The baseline survey provides the buyer with sufficient information on presumed asbestos at the facility, often which leads to reduction in the assessed value of the building (due primarily to forthcoming abatement costs). Note: EPA NESHAP (National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants) and OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) Regulations must be consulted in addition to ASTM Standard E 2356-04 to ensure all statutory requirements are satisfied, ex. notification requirements for renovation/demolition. Asbestos is not a material covered under CERCLA (Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act [...] ) <b>innocent</b> <b>purchaser</b> defense. In some instances, the U.S. EPA includes asbestos contaminated facilities on the NPL (Superfund). Buyers should be careful not to purchase facilities, even with an ASTM E 1527-05 Phase I ESA completed, without a full understanding of all the hazards in a building or at a property, without evaluating non-scope ASTM E 1527-05 materials, such as asbestos, lead, PCBs, mercury, radon, et al. A standard ASTM E 1527-05 does not include asbestos surveys as standard practice.|$|E
40|$|Bulk sales {{legislation}} arose out of {{an attempt}} to protect the creditors of merchants who would sell their stock in trade and either squander or secrete the proceeds. Under the normal rules relating to fraudulent conveyances, the creditor could pursue the property transfixed if he could show that the transfer was made with the intent to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors, and that the transferee had knowledge of the transferor 2 ̆ 7 s design. However, since a creditor would not be entitled to relief if the transferee was an <b>innocent</b> <b>purchaser</b> for an adequate consideration, and it generally would be difficult to prove that the transferee was aware of any fraudulent intent which the transferor might have had, the protection afforded by the ordinary doctrines concerning fraudulent conveyances or transfers was inadequate. Under bulk sales legislation, the creditor is normally allowed to treat certain transfers in bulk as void if the parties do not comply with the statutory requirements regardless of their intent or the fairness of the transaction. The statutory requirements, though varying from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, ordinarily include the preparation of an inventory of the assets to be transferred, the preparation of a list of creditors, and a requirement that notice of the intended transfer be sent to the creditors of the transferor prior to the completion of the transaction. Article 6 of the Nebraska version of the Uniform Commercial Code, which will become operative at midnight on September 1, 1965, replaces the present Nebraska bulk sales law, and will govern the area of bulk transfers...|$|E
6000|$|In later years, {{when the}} state became more populous, and land values increased, this {{careless}} work entailed incalculable trouble, endless litigation, a period of riotous land-grabbing, and no little bloodshed. The land-sharks voraciously attacked these excesses in the old surveys, and filed upon such portions with new scrip as unappropriated public domain. Wherever the identifications of the old tracts were vague, and the corners {{were not to be}} clearly established, the Land Office would recognize the newer locations as valid, and issue title to the locators. Here was the greatest hardship to be found. These old surveys, taken from the pick of the land, were already nearly all occupied by unsuspecting and peaceful settlers, and thus their titles were demolished, and the choice was placed before them either to buy their land over at a double price or to vacate it, with their families and personal belongings, immediately. Land locators sprang up by hundreds. The country was held up and searched for [...] "vacancies" [...] at the point of a compass. Hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of splendid acres were wrested from their <b>innocent</b> <b>purchasers</b> and holders. There began a vast hegira of evicted settlers in tattered wagons; going nowhere, cursing injustice, stunned, purposeless, homeless, hopeless. Their children began to look up to them for bread, and cry.|$|R
40|$|It is {{not unusual}} for {{practitioners}} reviewing a Delaware corporation's stock records to find omissions or procedural defects raising questions as to the valid authorization of some of the outstanding stock. Examples of such omissions and defects are limitless, but not infrequently found examples include the absence of board resolutions authorizing the issuance of stock shown by the transfer books as having been issued, the absence of evidence that issuances were properly authorized by the requisite votes of the board or, if required, by the stockholders, the absence of evidence that the consideration to have been received by the corporation in exchange for the stock was in fact received, the issuance of more shares than were authorized by the certificate of incorporation at the time, the issuance of stock prior to the filing of the charter amendment or certificate of designations authorizing or creating the stock, and similar procedural and substantive irregularities. Not infrequently, these defects occurred some time ago, and the stock in question may have changed hands multiple times since issuance. Confronted with such irregularities, most corporate lawyers' first instinct would be to attempt to correct the defect through board and, if necessary, stockholder, ratification of the defective issuance, with the intent of putting the parties in the positions they thought they were in prior to discovering the irregularity. However, Delaware courts have not always viewed defects in stock issuances as being curable by ratification. In a number of leading cases, the Delaware Supreme Court has treated the statutory formalities for the issuance of stock as substantive prerequisites to the validity of the stock being issued, and has determined that failure to comply with such formalities renders the stock in question void. A finding that stock is void means that defects in it cannot be cured, whether by ratification or otherwise. Thus, practitioners finding defects in stock issuances are put in the uncomfortable position of having to make a judgment whether the defect is one that renders the stock void, in which case ratification is not an option, or voidable, in which case ratification is an option. Unfortunately, the decisions issued by the Delaware courts have not afforded certainty in this critical area. Indeed, a recent decision of the Court of Chancery acknowledges that although "Delaware law is replete with cases" discussing the void-voidable distinction, the law as to when and whether a defective stock issuance can be cured "is not as clear as it could be. " This article analyzes the reasons for this lack of clarity, and proposes some solutions which would benefit buyers and sellers of corporate stock. We begin by examining the legal requirements applicable to stock issuances. Next, we discuss the foundation of the doctrinal distinction between void and voidable stock. We then discuss the cases where courts have found stock to have not been issued in accordance with these legal requirements, and whether such finding has resulted in the stock being found void or voidable. We also consider the purposes, principles and policies of certain provisions of Article 8 of the Uniform Commercial Code, designed to validate, in most circumstances, certain defects in stock in the hands of <b>innocent</b> <b>purchasers</b> for value. Interestingly, these provisions of the UCC have not been frequently discussed in the court cases that have considered whether stock is void or voidable, and the cases that have discussed them refer to them as setting forth an equitable rather than a legal principle - which is ultimately not helpful to corporate lawyers who opine on legal, not equitable, matters. In conclusion, we suggest that the policy underlying Article 8 of the Uniform Commercial Code to validate stock in the hands of <b>innocent</b> <b>purchasers</b> for value, notwithstanding technical defects in its issuance, should be recognized as a principle of law, not solely as a principle of equity, and should be applied by the Delaware courts as such. As a result, technical defects relating to statutory formalities should not lead to a finding of void stock, but at worst to voidable stock. Cure or ratification should be permitted except in cases where the issuance violates the directors' duty of loyalty or otherwise would be inequitable. Such a rule would allow practitioners to opine as to the validity of a corporation's outstanding stock where the stock was issued defectively but the defect cured, subject to a standard exception for fiduciary duties and other equitable matters, and would eliminate the risk that stock held in the trading markets or otherwise held by <b>innocent</b> <b>purchasers</b> for value might be deemed void...|$|R
500|$|The series {{garnered}} more {{controversy in}} 2005 {{with the release}} of the sixth book, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, when a Real Canadian Superstore grocery store accidentally sold several copies before the authorised release date. The Canadian publisher, Raincoast Books, obtained an injunction from the Supreme Court of British Columbia prohibiting the purchasers from reading the books in their possession. A comment by a media lawyer that [...] "there is no human right to read" [...] led to a debate in the public sphere about whether free access to information was a human right. Michael Geist, the Canada Research Chair of Internet and E-commerce Law at the University of Ottawa, said in response, [...] "The copyright law claim was particularly puzzling. While copyright law does provide copyright owners with a basket of exclusive rights, the right to prohibit reading is not among them. In fact, copyright law has very little to say about what people can do with a book once they have purchased it." [...] Free-speech activist Richard Stallman posted a statement on his blog calling for a boycott until the publisher issued an apology. Solicitors Fraser Milner and Casgrain, who represented Raincoast and formulated the legal argument for the embargo, have rebutted this, saying that the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms applies only to the government, not to private litigation, and does not offer any protection of the right to read in any case, and the <b>innocent</b> <b>purchasers</b> of the Harry Potter book had no more right to read it than if they had come into possession of someone's secret diary.|$|R
50|$|Even an {{exhaustive}} title {{search of the}} chain of title would not give the purchaser complete security, {{largely because of the}} principle, nemo dat quod non habet ("no one gives what he does not have") and the ever-present possibility of undetected outstanding interests. For example, in the UK Court of Chancery case Pilcher v Rawlins (1872), the vendor conveyed the fee-simple estate to P1, but retained the title deeds and fraudulently purported to convey the fee-simple estate to P2. The latter could receive only the title retained by the vendor—in short, nothing. However, the case was ultimately decided in favor of P2, over P1. The courts of equity could not bring themselves to decide against a totally <b>innocent</b> (without notice) <b>purchaser.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{narrative}} of rapid urbanisation {{in relation to}} inadequate planning, governance and management regimes in Nigeria is well-rehearsed. The combination of customary and colonial practices, outdated policies and plans and entrenched attitudes is typically regarded as a problem without clear or universal solutions. The aim of this report is to elucidate the urban land administration and planning debate in the country by examining the issues based on literature review and views of key urban sector stakeholders from six cities obtained through interviews. The historical development of land administration, planning and governance regimes in Nigeria is seen {{to contribute to the}} failure of the current development system because of an evolution from two distinct paradigms. This leads to confusion and a lack of engagement with formal systems thereby limiting the potential for well-conceived national and state urban development goals from being realised within cities that are not observing the planning frameworks. Colonial segregational policies have been superseded by a succession of policies that increasingly recognise, but cannot enforce, participation, equity, sustainability and climate change adaptation. Simultaneously, massively-scaled urban development continues under a variety of guises to meet the demand for space for urban accommodation, business and services from a diverse population with huge division between the wealthy and the urban poor. There is a growing need to categorise and understand this diversity of development in order to develop policies that adopt the positive aspects of informal development while pursuing national and state development goals and providing healthy and economically viable urban environments for all. It is shown that new development forms such as new towns, developer-built estates and owner built housing are large factors in the foregoing regard as they are in other sub-Saharan African urban areas. In addition, large scale infrastructural development has also led to ribbon and satellite development that takes advantage of the massive investment in national assets. These development forms are far superior to the slum conditions traditionally associated with the term “informal” and they may benefit from some of the “legal” attributes of formal planned developments such as ownership rights and even locally-prepared plans. The advantages of such developments in the vacuum created by the inadequacies of the formal planning system seem self-evident. However, it is apparent that these developments suffer from deficiencies in the provision of infrastructure and services and may also put an intolerable strain on nearby infrastructure and services designed to cope with the much smaller population anticipated by formal planning. Equally, the increasing commodification of lands especially those delivered through the informal system in the face of rapid urbanisation and rising demand are driving land and rental prices to unsustainable levels and {{out of the reach of}} essential key workers and the urban poor. This, coupled with the 2 tendency for the governance arrangements under the informal system to crumble in the face of urbanisation, could potentially displace people that would be considered entitled under the urban land administration and planning system in Nigeria. Furthermore, lack of formal governance and management of housing developments can place people at risk from unhealthy and overcrowded living conditions. This could also empower unscrupulous land owners and developers to prescribe their own governance and management framework, which may result in exploitation of <b>innocent</b> <b>purchasers.</b> The report also examines recent initiatives at national, state and local levels. It concludes that some initiatives have been met with a measure of success and that these are typified by a flexibility that applies global principles at a local level and that canvas the needs and observes the contexts of local populations...|$|R
