5|$|With A Christmas Carol, Dickens {{captured}} the zeitgeist of the mid-Victorian {{revival of the}} Christmas holiday.

5|$|Monteverdi {{recorded}} {{no apparent}} {{interest in the}} performance of Andromeda after the 1620 Carnival; the long letter that he wrote to Striggio on 13 March 1620 makes no reference to the event and is chiefly concerned with financial matters. The letter implies that the Gonzaga court was trying to persuade Monteverdi to return to Mantua; in courtly language Monteverdi evades the issue, while comparing the relative <b>generosity</b> <b>of</b> his Venetian employers with the parsimony of the Gonzaga court.|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I argue that {{foundational}} to attaining Cartesian generosity, {{both as a}} passion and as a virtue are the clear and distinct perceptions of mind, God, and body. I challenge Lisa Shapiro???s account <b>of</b> <b>generosity,</b> and her suggestion that generosity regulates the passions expressed in the meditations. Unlike Shapiro I attend closely to {{the distinction between the}} passion <b>of</b> <b>generosity</b> and the virtue <b>of</b> <b>generosity,</b> and how to acquire these different states of the soul. I propose that the passion <b>of</b> <b>generosity</b> cannot be aroused in the soul until after the meditations have been completed and the full inventory of clear and distinct perceptions attained. 1 interpret the meditations as orienting the meditator towards attaining virtue; by putting her in a position to attend frequently to the nature of free will after the six meditations have been completed. I interpret this frequent attendance to the will as a ???Seventh Meditation,??? which arouses the passion <b>of</b> <b>generosity.</b> After the passion has been attained, the virtue <b>of</b> <b>generosity</b> can then be acquired through self-cultivation, which instills generosity as a habit of the soul. The virtue <b>of</b> <b>generosity</b> is what allows one to gain mastery of the passions, and I provide an account of how this can be done through a process of reconditioning the passions...|$|R
5|$|Pain gave {{lands to}} Llanthony Priory, helping to {{establish}} the endowment of that monastic house, although {{it is difficult to}} distinguish his gifts from those of Hugh de Lacy, as the monks of Llanthony grouped the gifts of both men together in their records. In addition Pain granted lands to Gloucester Abbey, which had benefited from the <b>generosity</b> <b>of</b> his father and brother, as did his wife Sybil, together with other grants to her uncle the abbot. She also gave to two churches in Hereford: St Peter and St Guthlac.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} part of {{the south}} nave, the oldest section of the present structure, dates from medieval times; the north doorway and tracery (patterns of stonework in the windows) point to the 14th century. In about 1500, the church was enlarged {{by the addition of}} a south porch and a second nave to the north. An arcade (row of arches) was constructed between the two naves. Enlargement by adding a second nave was not as common in Anglesey as elsewhere in Wales. Llanidan is one of three examples on the island; the others are St Beuno's, Aberffraw and St Cwyfan's, Llangwyfan). It is uncertain whether St Nidan's was enlarged because of a growth in the numbers attending the church or because of the <b>generosity</b> <b>of</b> a benefactor.|$|E
5|$|Until 1996, the {{domestic}} situation during Unas' reign {{was thought to}} have been disastrous, based on reliefs from the causeway of his pyramid complex showing emaciated people and thus suggesting times of famine. This changed when excavations at Abusir in 1996 yielded similar reliefs in the mortuary complex of Sahure, who reigned at a prosperous time in the early Fifth Dynasty. In addition, research showed that the starving people are likely to be desert dwellers, nomads distinguished by their specific hair-style, rather than Egyptians. Thus, these reliefs are now understood to be standard representations of the <b>generosity</b> <b>of</b> the king towards the destitute and of the hardships of life in the desert regions bordering Egypt rather than referring to actual events.|$|E

40|$|For all {{the vast}} {{literature}} on “the gift,” {{the concept is}} surprisingly under-theorized. This is because everyone assumes {{that there is something}} called “the gift”, that all transactions not involving payment or the promise of payment are the same thing. Whether seen as a matter <b>of</b> <b>generosity,</b> lack <b>of</b> calculation, creating social relations or a refusal to distinguish between generosity and self-interest, the possibility that “gifts” operate according to different transactional logics is often overlooked...|$|R
5|$|The {{church has}} a nave with a north aisle and vestry, a Perpendicular Gothic west tower, a chancel and a south porch. The nave was rebuilt {{in the late}} 15th or early 16th century to meet a tower of {{approximately}} the same age; it is often dated to 1521, but appears to be built on older foundations. The southern side of the nave contains what are probably thirteenth-century buttresses {{and a pair of}} Perpendicular Gothic windows. The north aisle was originally built in the 13th century, and rebuilt by H.J. Underwood in 1890; the vestry was built in the 17th century and rebuilt in 1846 to designs by Chamberlain, through the <b>generosity</b> <b>of</b> the curate, Alexander Penrose Forbes. The church has been reroofed at least twice, in 1825 and 1897.|$|E
5|$|For 1924–25, the Midland League was reorganised because eight Football League clubs withdrew their reserve {{teams from}} the competition. York {{finished}} sixth in the Principal Competition that concluded in February 1925 and were runners-up to Denaby United in the North Subsidiary Competition. The club struggled financially in this period, and was only kept going by the enthusiasm and <b>generosity</b> <b>of</b> the directors. John Fisher, one of these benefactors, was elected chairman in 1925. The Midland League was restored to its previous size for 1925–26 and York finished in 16th place after a poor start to the season, from which they never recovered. York enjoyed their most successful Midland League season in 1926–27, when they finished in sixth place and scored 96 goals in 38 league matches. They surpassed the FA Cup's qualifying rounds {{for the first time}} this season, being beaten 2–1 by Second Division team Grimsby Town at Blundell Park in the second round. In 1927, the club made its first serious attempt for election to the Football League, but Barrow and Accrington Stanley were re-elected instead. Fisher resigned as chairman in August 1927 and Brown took the position for the second time. After ranking seventh in the Midland League in 1927–28, York appointed their first official manager in July 1928, with Jock Collier named as player-manager. York finished ninth in 1928–29, and Jimmy Cowie was the divisional top scorer with 49 goals. This was York's last season in the Midland League as the club won election to the Football League on 3 June 1929, taking the place of Ashington in the Third Division North.|$|E

40|$|Many {{studies have}} pointed out that {{generosity}} depends on different things like gender, age and nationality. We wanted to see if predetermined factors like genetics also had an effect on the intention <b>of</b> <b>generosity.</b> There is a ratio between the index finger (2 D) and ring finger (4 D) that is determined by the levels of testosterone in the amniotic fluid and that have had some significant effect on personality attributes like musical and leadership skills.
