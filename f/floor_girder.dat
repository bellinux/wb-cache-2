Mild steel is used extensively as a structural member. This material has the property of supporting loads beyond its elastic limit until it reaches its ultimate load through plastic deformation. Therefore plastic design provides a rational method of designing structural members. Plastic design is easier (or at least not more difficult) to follow compared to the conventional design method. As this method saves the material by weight, it is more economical. In this example, the <b>floor</b> <b>girders</b> designed by the plastic method save 43. 4 percent by weight {{when compared with the}} working load design...|$|R

Some of the common functions studied with influence lines include reactions (the forces that the structure’s supports must apply {{in order for the}} structure to remain static), shear, moment, and deflection. Influence lines are important in designing beams and trusses used in bridges, crane rails, conveyor belts, <b>floor</b> <b>girders,</b> and other structures where loads will move along their span.

This paper discusses the initiation of a long-term collaborative research program between Tufts University and LeMessurier Consultants to investigate the vibration characteristics of a variety of floor systems. Examples include new concrete-steel composite floor systems, concrete floor systems, and irregular floor systems, and floor systems that have required remediation.

The precast concrete parts are transported using flatbed semi-trailers to the sites. The structural floor modules may need to be laid tilted during the transportation in order to cover as large floor area as possible while they can be easily transported on the roadways. The modules are lifted using precast concrete lifting anchor systems at the sites for assembly. Decorations may include using of covers to close the holes in the precast concrete that contains the lifting anchors, and installing facades to the exterior of the structures.|$|R

This is to the authors' knowledge the first building of its kind developed in Greece and Europe. The development is based on analysis using a space frame model, subjected to EC 3 and EC 8 specified loads, followed by a design based on the EM requirements. The study also discusses difficulties in developing the system and presents solutions to cope with code specified wind and seismic loads. In order to account for seismic loads that in most cases govern the design of the columns, 3 -D and 2 -D finite element analyses have been performed accounting for nonlinear material behavior of critical column-bay locations. Several alternative column profiles are proposed depending on the intensity of the seismic loads. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{deals with}} the {{problems}} of analysis and the design of perforated thin-walled steel Sigma beams with respect to lateral torsional buckling (further LTB). The application of Sigma profiles is in the storage systems and expedient flooring structures as <b>floor</b> <b>girders.</b> In some cases, the beams are not laterally restraint and therefore the effect of lateral torsional buckling may occur. First the theoretical calculations according to the design procedure listed in European standard EN 1993 - 1 - 1 and Czech national annex NB. 3 are being performed. These calculations are valid for the beams with the uniform cross-section only without any rules for the beams weakened by holes. Therefore the substitute cross-section is being established and the cross-section characteristics are defined as the weighted average of the characteristics for the full section and for the section weakened by holes. The calculated elastic critical moments for the substitute cross-section properties are verified by the FEM calculations on the beam with variable cross-section. This theoretical approach is verified by testing in laboratory conditions. The experiments are being carried out on the specimens of three different beam lengths. The test results are statistically evaluated according to EN 1090 and the characteristics bending resistances obtained from tests are compared with the values calculated according to EN 1993 - 1 - 1 and Czech national annex NB. 3 using the cross-section characteristics of substitute cross-section...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{a method for}} improving the performance of reinforced concrete frame buildings during seismic events. The criteria used to assess performance were the location of plastic hinges and the controlling mechanisms, the displacement characteristics of the frames including the inters tory distortion, and the deformation of the structural elements. The goal for improved performance was to reduce hinging in columns and force the yielding into the girders, resulting {{in the formation of}} the structural mechanism. A limit analysis was used to develop the method for a strength based relationship to ensure that the structural mechanism would be the controlling mechanism for any set of frame parameters. The relationship to improve performance reduces the flexural strength of upper <b>floor</b> level <b>girders</b> in the frames a prescribed amount. Non-linear static and dynamic analyses were used to test the method on several regular reinforced concrete frames. The results indicate that the performance of the frames improved when using the method discussed in this thesis. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Fu Feng highway {{prestressed}} concrete bridge {{is located in}} Changchun City which is the capital and largest city of Jilin province and it located in the northeast of China. The strengthening of the bridge structural members can be attempted by replacing poor quality or defective materials by better quality materials, attaching additional load-bearing materials, and re-distribution of the loading actions through imposed deformation on the structure system. The objectives {{of this study are}} to explain the strengthening process of damaged structural members of Fu Feng bridge, and to evaluate the performance of the bridge structure by adopting static load test. The strengthening process of damaged structural members includes three stages. These stages include the strengthening of box <b>girders</b> <b>floor</b> by casting of 10 cm of reinforced concrete in the <b>floor</b> of box <b>girder</b> within the location of positive bending moment in the mid-span and edge span, the strengthening of box girders web by pasting steel plates in the inside of the right and left of box girders, and the strengthening of the transverse beam of piers No. 18 and No. 19 by using carbon fiber sheet. The results of static load test show that the values of testing coefficient (λ) of stress range from 0. 83 to 0. 92 are less than allowable value 1. 05. Therefore, these values satisfy the allowable value of standard, indicating that the structural member has a certain strength reserve and the working state of the bridge structure i...|$|R

40|$|At {{preliminary}} design stage, the global mechanical behavior of large marine vessels such as container ships {{has previously been}} analyzed idealizing them as a classical beam. These structures are complex and a classical beam idealization significantly compromises important structural behavior associated with cross section warping or in-plane displacements. On the other hand, 3 D Finite Element (FE) models have been utilized which are accurate in capturing these details but pose high computational cost. In present work, structural analyses of marine vessels with realistic boundary conditions have been presented using well-known Carrera Unified Formulation (CUF). Using CUF, higher order theories can be implemented without the need of ad-hoc formulations. The finite element arrays are written in terms of fundamental nuclei for 1 D beam elements that are independent of problem characteristics and the approximation order. Thus, refined models can be developed in an automatic manner. In the present work, the beam cross sections are discretized using elements with Lagrange polynomials and the FE model is regarded as Component-Wise (CW), allowing one to model complex 3 D features, such as inclined hull walls, <b>floors</b> and <b>girders</b> {{in the form of}} components. The work is mainly divided in two parts: Hull in vacuo (in absence of water) and Hull with Hydrostatic Stiffness (in presence of water). The former involves static and dynamic structural analyses of hulls with realistic geometries without the effect of water. The later involves static and dynamic analyses of realistic hull geometries that are supported by buoyancy springs. The stiffness of buoyancy springs is made part of the fundamental nuclei and the corresponding FEM matrices for hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads are obtained. The hydrodynamic loads have been considered in the form of Radiation Wave loads which include damping and added mass effects. Utilization of Component-Wise (CW) model under hydrodynamic loads has afforded an ease in modelling the complex geometrical configurations such as realistic boat shapes and the dynamic response analyses of aircraft carrier due to moving aircraft. All the analyses have been validated with published literature and their computational efficacy is established through their comparison with the results from commercial code...|$|R

In civil engineering, mostly timber-concrete {{composite structures}} are used, particularly in reconstruction of old timber <b>girder</b> <b>floor</b> structures or manufacture of new ones at {{the reconstruction of}} old buildings in areas exposed to frequent earthquakes. In new buildings it is mainly glued laminated timber or lumber, while in reconstruction square timber is used. A timber beam is coupled with a concrete slab made either of conventional or a lightweight concrete. Best results are achieved by coupling timber with lightweight aggregate concrete that has all the properties similar to the timber except for its strength that is much higher and {{comparable to that of}} conventional concrete. This paper analyzes a composite timber-lightweight aggregate concrete structure. The basic girder is a T-cross section, with the web made of glulam, and flange made of lightweight concrete with expanded clay aggregate (Liapor). The two materials are coupled by means of mechanical fasteners, allowing joint action of the composite section. Quality of coupling has been determined by experimental tests carried out at the Laboratory of the Technical Mechanics Institute, Faculty of Civil Engineering in Zagreb.

A comprehensive review of various existing theories and finite element models in analyzing shear connection {{in this type of}} beams in general, has been conducted and a summary is presented in this thesis. An effort has been made to achieve a proper shear connection under axial effects, by using a standard linear frame type finite element. In addition, the conventional method of using linear spring elements to model the shear connection in steel and concrete structural elements has also been considered. SAP 90 finite element software has been used for developing all the finite element models presented in this thesis. The finite element models developed have been verified against experimental work conducted by others on a composite stub <b>girder</b> <b>floor</b> system where concrete slab is subjected to bending, shear and axial forces at certain locations. From the work carried out by this study, it had been concluded that the linear frame type finite element has its limitations in modeling the shear connection under axial effects. However, acceptable shear force values could be predicted in the shear connectors by using this type of finite elements. It has also been found that the conventional linear spring elements developed to model the shear connection, may not be valid in the presence of axial effects.

Similar to the old Lemmings games, the puzzle-based gameplay in Mini-Land Mayhem is built upon that of earlier 3 Mario vs. Donkey Kong titles, where players do not control Mario, but instead are tasked with guiding wind-up miniatures to level exits, in this case mechanical Mini-Mario toys. The game requires players to [...] "build and rebuild levels on the fly," [...] to allow the small miniature Marios to get from point A to point B. As the mini-Marios cannot be directly controlled, the player instead uses a stylus to manipulate their movements. Each level has one to three minis that must be moved, and {{it is necessary to}} rescue all the minis to win a level, and each exit closes several second after a mini enters. The level is lost if any minis are left stranded, or fall into dangerous spikes, enemies, traps, or pitfalls. [...] Once a single mini has escaped a level, a timer comes on, and everyone else must be through the door within seconds or the level is failed. Unlike previous installments of the series, {{it is not possible to}} stop the miniatures or change their direction once they are activated. [...] There are eight themed [...] "worlds" [...] in the theme park, with eight levels each leading to boss battles. A zoomed-out map view on the upper screen helps players navigate worlds. Each world has a different type of object to interact with. The first world involves building walls and <b>floors,</b> using red <b>girders</b> to serve as bridges, walls, and ramps. Later players gain access to magnets, conveyor belts, and springs, as well as other building blocks for directing the robot army such as trampolines and repositioned platforms. Each world requires the player to use that world's specific tool to defeat Donkey Kong in the boss battle. For example, in one level, platforms can be built so the Mario minis can get to Donkey Kong to electrocute him or drop bombs on him. There are also items like hammers, which can hit Circus Kong and other gorilla robots out of the way.|$|R

The beauty of the existing structure will stand out best in the area of ??integrity. But as for teaching and teachers are even separate rooms, I decided to preserve as much unity in the ground - that is accessible to the public, and then on the fourth floor, which in itself is beautiful and will inspire students here who will form his studio work. There is a facility serving the public - library, exhibition details. On the second floor, then follow the stairs in respirium hall with cloakroom, conference room, administration, classrooms and offices. On the third floor, only the classrooms and offices, pattern shop and computer lab. The top floor of the studios are split only low walls and toilets and kitchens in addition to repeating in each floor there are even showers...|$|R
