Tired and harassed after the burdensome task being given to them, the children have to make do in subhuman conditions in the Muro Ami boat, The Aurora. They sleep in rat-infested bunks and are fed only twice a day. Life above the water in the boat is much worse than the suffering the children encounter beneath the sea.

Market liberalization and competition as well as various regulatory and technical solutions are believed to be useful in closing the digital divide and ensuring the universal access to ICTs. The general perception is that people who have access to ICT will benefit from it, and those who don't would not. Benefits include boundless information sharing, connectivity, participation in the global economy. The use of mobile phones as part of ICT4D initiatives shows some positive effects in improving access to information and services. For example, the arrival of mobiles brought reduction in the variability of price and the amount of waste in the <b>fishing</b> <b>system</b> along the Kerala coast, India. A study in Kenya identified innovation in mobile technologies for development, in particular the success of M-PESA mobile banking through the partnerships between private and public sectors. Another analysis of mobile phone use in developing countries shows that the use of mobile phones improves access to information, helps to address market inefficiencies, and can be used in disaster relief.|$|E

The application was made on the southern complex multispecies groundfish fishery, where operate various scales of production under a right-based <b>fishing</b> <b>system.</b> A multimethological approach (Mingers, 1977) was used and a key question was formulated to relevant actors. Stakeholders were previously submitted to a personality test to achieve successful interaction during workshops. These were planned following different approaches (Ackerman and Eden, 2001), (Delbecq and Van De Ven, 1986), (Jung, 1976), (Sieler, 2007), (Bandler and Grinder, 1975; 1982). This approach built a communication mode (Trujillo, et. al, 2008) allowing confidence and consensus among stakeholders to bring forth a world (Maturana, 1988) to establish nine relevant critical points out of about 500 problems obtained from individual interviews. These were defined as: institutional weaknesses, policy development gaps, fisheries management operational difficulty, weak supervision system, lack of incentives for small-scale fishery efficiency, small-scale fishermen disunity, rights-based <b>fishing</b> <b>system</b> poor designed, lack of a co-management model and fails to incorporate fishery knowledge into the management process. Critical-problems perceived by stakeholders reveal weak governance in the interface science-policy-fishery decision making. Stakeholders questioned fishery viability in the long run.

40|$|My {{goal was}} to {{describe}} how biological and ecological factors give shape to fishing practices that {{can contribute to the}} successful self-governance of a small-scale <b>fishing</b> <b>system</b> in the Gulf of California, Mexico. The analysis was based on a comparison of the main ecological and biological indicators that fishers claim to use to govern their day-to-day decision making about fishing and data collected in situ. I found that certain indicators allow fishers to learn about differences and characteristics of the resource system and its units. Fishers use such information to guide their day-to-day fishing decisions. More importantly, these decisions appear unable to shape the reproductive viability of the fishery because no indicators were correlated to the reproductive cycle of the target species. As a result, the fishing practices constitute a number of mechanisms that might provide short-term buffering capacity against perturbations or stress factors that otherwise would threaten the overall sustainability and self-governance of the system. The particular biological circumstances that shape the harvesting practices might also act as a precursor of self-governance because they provide fishers with enough incentives to meet the costs of organizing the necessary rule structure that underlies a successful self-governance system...|$|E

These threats are more severe in the Black Sea owing to its semi-enclosed nature, high human density, and human activities being carried out especially in coastal zones. Each year, incidental cetacean catches are registered on the Romanian littoral and, consequently, mortalities occur among individuals which strand on the beaches. These mortalities affect in particular the species Phocoena phocoena, considered the most vulnerable one to gillnet fishing. The greatest hazard for Black Sea marine mammals is turbot gillnets, taking into account their number and distribution area.

40|$|Standard {{fisheries}} models used {{in economics}} and for management purposes almost always assume parameter {{values of the}} <b>fishing</b> <b>system</b> are stable. In this paper, we put forth models where {{the parameters of the}} biological growth model systematically change over time.

We consider models where the time series component is deterministic (and known) and where there is a true stochastic component. In cases with time-varying underlying biology, we get very different results from the conventional wisdom. In particular, the concept of maximum sustainable yield (MSY) which drives much of fishing policy is no longer well defined {{in the sense of a}} single number although we show that the concept of maximizing economic rent is.

It also comprises a structural analysis of the system aiming to identify any key issues and then propose research and development programs for multiple fisheries that will contribute to their sustainable development. The methodology is divided into four stages: i) identification of issues with stakeholder (fishers, government workers and expert scientists) participation, ii) analysis of a structural matrix consisting of a direct causality study of the symmetric, structural and binary matrix based on socio-ecological issues allowing the calculation {{of the level of}} influence and dependence of each issue, iii) identification of key issues with an influence/dependency diagram, and iv) proposal of research and development programs according to the needs and opportunities identified in the previous stages.

The basic information carne from fishing log-book recorded by scientific observers between January 2001 and December 2005. The generalized additives models included five physical variables (latitude, longitude, date, lunar Índex and sea surface temperature (SST)), which affect the availability and vulnerability of swordfish, and two operational variables (length of the vessel and type of longline), which are directly associated with {{the effectiveness of the}} <b>fishing</b> <b>system.</b> The non-linear effects were established significantly (p < 0. 01) for each of the independent variables. There was a typical annual cycle in the catch rates, with high values from March to July/August, and displacement of the fishing operation northward from the 38 ° to 32 °S, in a SST range of 17 ° to 19 °C. Subsequently, catch rates decrease in a northerly direction from 32 °S in SST higher than 20 °C. This spatial-temporal pattern was determinates with a high square coherency (79 %) in the time series of nominal catch rates and latitudinal component analyzed in the Fourier spectral analysis. It also established for the time series of swordfish nominal catch rates, low-frequency fluctuations with periods of 28, 38 and 59 days.

40|$|The massive {{destruction}} of fish stocks during the last 100 years has created an enormous environmental problem with consequences that are poorly understood, both for the fish and for the human populations that depend upon them. Many think of the oceans as the ultimate commons, and believe that fish stocks collapsed because individual fishermen did not restrain their behavior. However, the collapse of world fisheries was not caused by individual fishermen rushing to harvest but {{was the result of}} conscious policies adopted by the distant water fishing nations in general, and the U. S., in particular, to promote and expand global fisheries, not only for the fish, but for territorial reasons that were bound with foreign policy concerns during the Cold War. The distant water nations pushed for a policy of taking fish without restrictions, until critical biological points were estimated, then applying measures to slow or restrict the catch. The practical effect of this policy, known as Maximum Sustained Yield (MSY) was that distant water nations fished unhindered until countries began expanding their territorial limits to 200 miles during the 1970 s. The policy greatly facilitated the rise of an industrial, global <b>fishing</b> <b>system,</b> creating fishing capacity that far exceeded the ability of stocks to reproduce. MSY was promoted as being grounded in conservation and sound science, but its adoption was greatly influenced by American foreign policy during this period. MSY also focused fisheries science on the narrow objective of determining harvest points, thus allowing the world’s distant water nations, including the U. S., to forestall attempts by smaller and poorer nations to enclose their fishing stocks to protect them from foreign exploitation...|$|E
40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the {{economic}} valuation of alternative clam management practices in the Venice Lagoon. The proposed valuation method {{is characterized by the}} design of a survey questionnaire applied to the fishermen population. In each questionnaire, two fishing alternatives are described. The respondent is asked to choose one of them. This valuation method, referred in the article as conjoint valuation, gives sufficient flexibility to set, alter, and combine the valuation of different clam management practices. Furthermore, this approach presents an important advantage to the well-known contingent valuation method since it makes the monetary valuation of each management attribute possible. Estimation results show that all three attributes used in the questionnaire to describe and value different clam management practices—price of the annual permit and fishing technological system—are statistically robust, indicating that fishermen bear a utility change whenever these attributes change. In particular, fishermen’s willingness to pay for a larger clam fishing area ranges between 568 and 811 o per year. In addition, an individual’s willingness to pay for a fishing practice exclusively based on the vibrant rake system ranges between 1005 and 2456 euro. Finally, the adoption of a clam fish management practice in the Venice Lagoon that is exclusively based on the use of manual rakes, which is associated with the lowest damage to the lagoon ecosystem, will represent a welfare loss of 5904 euro per fisherman per year. Combining such a value estimate with the total number of fishermen currently operating in the Lagoon of Venice, the welfare loss associated with the adoption of this type of clam management policy amounts to 11. 8 million euro per year. This figure can be regarded as an upper bound to the cost of implementation of a clam <b>fishing</b> <b>system</b> anchored in the use of manual, ecosystem friendly rakes...|$|E
