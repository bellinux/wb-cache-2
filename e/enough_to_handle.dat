5|$|After Leonard I. Schiff {{calculated}} that an initiator could theoretically improve {{the efficiency of}} a gun-type fission weapon, Oppenheimer gave approval on 15 March 1945 for initiators {{to be included in}} the Little Boy design. Testing was carried out to ensure that the initiators were rugged <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> being transported in an airplane and being accidentally dropped. Eventually, about forty initiators were despatched to Tinian, where four were inserted into the bomb that was used in the bombing of Hiroshima.|$|E
5|$|The Court's {{caseload}} {{continued to}} grow over time. In 1881 the general assembly approved {{the creation of a}} five-member panel of commissioners to assist the justices in administrative tasks. Even this was not <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> the load. In 1891 the Appellate Court of Indiana was created to handle cases of lower importance. At first the appellate court only took {{a small portion of the}} Supreme Court's caseload, but its responsibility gradually increased.|$|E
5|$|Evolve was {{developed}} by Turtle Rock Studios. Evolves creative director, Phil Robb, and lead designer, Chris Ashton, are the co-founders of Turtle Rock Studios alongside Michael Booth. The team had a heritage of developing competitive multiplayer games, such as Valve Corporation's Counter-Strike series and the Left 4 Dead series. According to Robb, the team {{wanted to build a}} co-operative, multiplayer game because it gave the team a chance to play with their family and friends together, instead of against each other, and found it offered a more enjoyable experience than competitive multiplayer games. The concept for Evolve was completed in 2005, before the development of the first Left 4 Dead game. However, the Evolve project was put on hold, as Turtle Rock thought that the technology at that time was not advanced <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> the game's design.|$|E

5|$|To further {{interest}} the case, House manipulates the team, Cameron (Jennifer Morrison), and Chase (Jesse Spencer), by swapping {{his own blood}} sample, leading them to believe he too has syphilis, perhaps the cause for his misanthropic personality and unfriendliness. He then pretends to get a nicer personality, but gets less able as a doctor as he pretends to take the penicillin they prescribe him, and everyone falls for House's trick (which he has confided to Wilson). Meanwhile, Foreman believes he isn't getting the respect he deserves from Kutner, Taub (Peter Jacobson) and Thirteen (Olivia Wilde), {{when he tries to}} do their performance reviews, which he believes is due to House frequently humiliating him. House replies that if he did not humiliate and taunt Foreman, he would not be strong and able <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> the rest of the team.|$|E
5|$|According to game creator Steven Howse, he was {{inspired}} to create the game while he was experiencing financial problems. As {{a result of these}} financial issues, he had to move from Minneapolis to Michigan, where he realized the popularity of Agar.io. He had long wanted to create an online multiplayer game, but the only option for the development at the time was in Adobe Flash, and not wanting to use this method, he gave up the idea for a while. Howse finally created the game when he realized that WebSocket, a low-latency protocol supported by most major browsers, was sufficient and stable enough to run an HTML game similar to other games such as Agar.io. The most difficult part of the development was in making each server stable <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> 600 players at a time. Howse struggled to find space on servers with enough space in regions where there was more demand and tried to avoid cloud services like Amazon Web Services, owing to the high cost that these services would incur based on the amount of bandwidth used.|$|E
5|$|Difficulties {{with the}} {{diffusers}} and pumps paled into insignificance besides {{those with the}} porous barrier. In order to work, the gaseous diffusion process required a barrier with microscopic holes, but not subject to plugging. It had to be extremely porous, but strong <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> the high pressures. And, like everything else, it had to resist corrosion from uranium hexafluoride. The latter criterion suggested a nickel barrier. Foster C. Nix at the Bell Telephone Laboratories experimented with nickel powder, while Edward O. Norris at the C. O. Jelliff Manufacturing Corporation and Edward Adler at the City College of New York worked on a design with electroplated metallic nickel. Norris was an English interior decorator, who had developed a very fine metal mesh for use with a spray gun. Their design appeared too brittle and fragile for the proposed use, particularly on the higher stages of enrichment, but there was hope {{that this could be}} overcome.|$|E
50|$|The {{specifications}} for the bike, developed {{in discussions with}} local farmers, were the ability to go at walking pace without slipping the clutch, have <b>enough</b> power <b>to</b> climb the steep hills, be rugged <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> withstand the rough farm tracks, and light <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> carry. The wheels needed to be discs because spoked wheels got caught in sticks and branches and the back tyre had <b>to</b> have <b>enough</b> traction <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> mud and grip hillsides.|$|R

This is most frequently used by Severn Beach Line trains but is long <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> any four-car Diesel Multiple Unit (DMU). Behind Platform 1 is a brick wall that forms part of the signal box and on this are some metal artworks created by artists with learning difficulties to celebrate Brunel's 200th anniversary in 2006; an interpretation panel is nearby. The High Level Siding beyond Platform 1 is the rump of the Bristol Harbour Railway, and Barton Hill traction maintenance depot {{can be seen in the}} distance alongside Bristol East Junction (formerly South Wales Junction) where the lines to Bristol Parkway and Bath diverge.|$|E

25|$|It {{became clear}} during the Civil War that Cleveland's lone {{railroad}} station—a small wooden structure built in 1853 {{at the base}} of Bath Street (now Front Avenue) on the Cleveland Flats—was not large <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> the city's growing rail needs.

25|$|Yellowknife did {{not have}} an all-season road access to the rest of Canada's highway network until the {{completion}} of Deh Cho Bridge in 2012. Prior to that, traffic relied on ferry service in summer and ice road in winter to cross the Mackenzie River.

25|$|The {{duration}} of the visible blistering caused by varicella zoster virus varies in children usually from 4 to 7 days, {{and the appearance of}} new blisters begins to subside after the fifth day. Chickenpox infection is milder in young children, and symptomatic treatment, with sodium bicarbonate baths or antihistamine medication may ease itching. It is recommended to keep new infants from birth up to age 6 months away from an infected person for 10 to 21 days because their immune systems are not developed <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> the stress it can bring on. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is widely used to reduce fever. Aspirin, or products containing aspirin, should not be given to children with chickenpox, as it can cause Reye's Syndrome.|$|E
25|$|At the CFA's {{meeting on}} September 13, 1948, the {{commission}} again discussed {{how to win}} an appropriation to complete the statue groups.

Furthermore, only one foundry was large <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> the work, and it demanded an escalator clause in its contract. The park service expressed its opinion that an escalator clause would not be approved by federal budget officials. Members of Congress suggested, however, that a European nation be asked to cast the statues {{as part of the}} Marshall Plan. There was widespread agreement among CFA members and the sculptors that this should be pursued.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} {{of the end of the}} war in Europe, Juin was in the United States, where he {{represented}} France at the San Francisco Conference. In the immediate post-war period he continued with his task of rebuilding France's armed forces. This was made difficult by the ending of American Lend-Lease aid, and the military commitments to the Allied occupation of Germany, and in North Africa, Syria and Italy, where the 1947 Paris Peace Treaties made some adjustments to the border. The major looming crisis, though, was the Indochina War. Juin lost his direct access to the President when de Gaulle left office in 1946, and his plans for an Army large <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> France's commitments had to be scaled back.|$|E
