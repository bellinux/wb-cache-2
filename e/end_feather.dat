50|$|The dinosaur's tail is {{long and}} <b>feathered,</b> with <b>end</b> <b>feathers</b> up to 30 cm long, equalling {{approximately}} 30% {{of the length of}} the animal's skeleton. This length exceeds the previous record length of 7 in for feathers from non-avian dinosaurs. The elongated tail feathers are thought to have helped provide softer and safer landings. They could have controlled pitch, a feature useful for a heavier animal, that would have attained a faster gliding speed.|$|R

Nonbreeding males and females look similar and are grayish brown with white stripes.|$|R
50|$|Bows and Arrows {{were used}} by most {{cultures}} around the world at some point or another and are at least 8,000 years old. The arrow is created, similarly to a spear, from a small blade (arrow tip) attached to the {{one end of a}} wooden shaft. Attached to the other <b>end</b> are <b>feathers</b> that help stabilize the arrow's flight. Overall, an arrow is much smaller and lighter than a spear. The bow is made from an arced piece of flexible material (such as wood, bone, or horn) with the two ends attached by a tautly spun cord. The arrow is drawn back with the cord, and when the cord is released it acts as a spring and shoots the arrow forward.|$|R
5000|$|The {{impressions}} {{of a series}} of wide and unbranched feathers were discovered with the fossils. Only the distal <b>ends</b> of the <b>feather</b> impressions are visible. Based on their morphology the feathers are considered primitive and bear resemblance to those found along the neck of Beipiaosaurus, which were collected in the same formation. The authors noted that the [...] "presence of elongated broad filamentous feathers (EBFF) suggests that they might have been used for visual display".|$|R

She then jumped on the bed and started a pillow fight therefore <b>ending</b> Beovizija with <b>feathers</b> and confetti flying everywhere.|$|R
50|$|SF violet skyblues have a {{body colour}} ranging from dark skyblue to medium cobalt. Most look rather like pale cobalts. The colour of the tail and flight {{feathers}} are the most reliable distinguishing features. Cobalts have navy blue tails throughout their length, while Violet Skyblues have tails, which shade to turquoise at the quill <b>end.</b> The flight <b>feathers</b> of Cobalts are dark blue, those of violet skyblues have a glossy turquoise iridescence rather like those of skyblues but slightly darker.|$|R
5000|$|Most birds' tails <b>end</b> in long <b>{{feathers}}</b> called rectrices. These feathers {{are used}} as a rudder, helping the bird steer and maneuver in flight; they also help the bird to balance while it is perched. [...] In some species - such as birds of paradise, lyrebirds, and most notably peafowl - modified tail feathers {{play an important role}} in courtship displays. [...] The extra-stiff tail feathers of other species, including woodpeckers and woodcreepers, allow them to brace themselves firmly against tree trunks.|$|R
25|$|After {{the autumn}} moult {{the tips of}} the new {{feathers}} have a buff fringe that adds a brown cast to the coloured plumage. The <b>ends</b> of the <b>feathers</b> wear away over the winter so that by the spring breeding season the underlying brighter colours are displayed. The eyes have dark brown irises and the legs are grey-brown. In winter the bill is a pale grey and slightly darker along the upper ridge or culmen, but in spring the bill becomes bluish-grey with a small black tip.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 24-26 mm. The head is whitish {{above and}} the face and neck are brownish. The antennae are whitish ochreous, with the basal joint brown. The forewings are cream white, with a few scattered brown scales. There is a brown spot before {{the base of the}} fissure and another between that and the costa. The fringes are cream white, tinged with brown on the outer margin. The hindwings are very pale cinereous and the fringes are slightly darker about the <b>ends</b> of the <b>feathers.</b>|$|R

Indeed, so imminent did my doom appear and so unavoidable, that {{later in the day}} I asked for pen and paper that I might make an attempt at setting my earthly affairs to rights. Yet when the writing materials were brought me, I wrote not. I sat instead with the <b>feathered</b> <b>end</b> of my quill between my teeth, and thus pondered the matter of the disposal of my Picardy estates.|$|R

50|$|Scarlet (red) is a color {{traditionally}} {{associated with}} Artillery units. The cross, a heraldic device, and utilized by the Indians in Oklahoma, is {{symbolic of the}} morning star and {{is representative of the}} dawn of the 14th Field Artillery. The fourteen drops of water correspond to the numerical designation of the regiment. The irregular placement of the drops is to represent a dried peyote, a species of small cactus, one of the sacred emblems of the Comanche and Kiowa Indians. The war bonnet pierced by the arrow of Satanta, a noted Kiowa chief of the mid-19th century, is really a spear with a <b>feathered</b> <b>end</b> and leather grip.

50|$|The arrow-like {{projectiles}} of a crossbow {{are called}} bolts. These are much shorter than arrows, {{but can be}} several times heavier. There is an optimum weight for bolts to achieve maximum kinetic energy, which varies depending on the strength and characteristics of the crossbow, but most could pass through common mail. In ancient times, the bolts of a strong crossbow were usually several times heavier than arrows. Modern bolts are stamped with a proof mark to ensure their consistent weight {{and do not have}} fletching, i.e. <b>feathered</b> <b>ends</b> like those commonly seen on arrows. Crossbow bolts can be fitted with a variety of heads, some with sickle-shaped heads to cut rope or rigging; but the most common today is a four-sided point called a quarrel. A highly specialized type of bolt is employed to collect blubber biopsy samples used in biology research.|$|R
50|$|The quill {{replaced}} the reed pen across Europe by the Early Middle Ages and remained the main writing {{tool of the}} West for nearly a thousand years until the 17th century. Quills are fashioned by cutting a nib into the <b>end</b> of a <b>feather</b> obtained from a fairly large bird, such as a goose, traditionally from its left wing. A quill {{has the advantage of}} being more durable and more flexible than a reed pen, and it can also retain ink in the hollow shaft of the feather, known as the calamus, allowing more writing time between ink dippings. The quill was in common use until the early 19th century and the advent of the metal nib. For business purposes, the quill was fairly quickly overtaken; however, it remains popular for personal use and for artistic work.|$|R

60|$|Old Marrow-Bone was {{the first}} to be smoked out. A light fan of air drifted the smoke away at the time so that I saw clearly. He broke out through the smoke, {{stepping}} on a burning coal and screaming with the sudden hurt of it, and essayed to climb up the cliff. The arrows showered about him. He came to a pause on a ledge, clutching a knob of rock for support, gasping and sneezing and shaking his head. He swayed back and forth. The <b>feathered</b> <b>ends</b> of a dozen arrows were sticking out of him. He was an old man, and {{he did not want to}} die. He swayed wider and wider, his knees giving under him, and as he swayed he wailed most plaintively. His hand released its grip and he lurched outward to the fall. His old bones must have been sadly broken. He groaned and strove feebly to rise, but a Fire-Man rushed in upon him and brained him with a club.|$|R
