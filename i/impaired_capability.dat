50|$|Children {{with autism}} have an <b>impaired</b> <b>capability</b> to solve problems, engage in {{thoughtful}} and appropriate behaviours, sustain relevant tasks and self-monitor. They lack mentalization or Theory of Mind (ToM) and have sensory, perceptual, cognitive, and intellectual deficits. This suggests {{that children with}} autism have general deficits in the high-order planning and regulatory systems, known as executive functions. Autistic individuals have an enlarged cortex characterized by irregular neuronal growth, a reduced volume of corpus callosum (impairing communication between hemispheres), abnormal structure and function of the frontal lobe, cerebellum, medial temporal lobe, related limbic systems (amygdala and hippocampus), and elevated levels of serotonin. These brain and molecular abnormalities {{could account for the}} characteristic impairment of executive functioning in autistic patients. The SAS is disrupted at some level and intensity in all five of the Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDD), which include Autism, Asperger syndrome (AS), Rett syndrome, Childhood disintegrative disorder (CDD), and Pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS).|$|E

In {{order to get a}} better insight into the mechanism(s) underlying the FALS phenotype, we have investigated the activity and the copper binding properties of the single mutant H 46 R, which is associated with a Japanese form of FALS.

40|$|International audienceGenetic {{studies have}} implicated the {{evolutionary}} novel, anthropoid primate-specific gene locus G 72 /G 30 in psychiatric diseases.

We recently generated "humanized" BAC transgenic mice (G 72 Tg) expressing G 72 transcripts in cells throughout the brain. These mice exhibit several behavioral phenotypes related to psychiatric diseases. Here we show that G 72 Tg mice have a reduced activity of mitochondrial complex I, with a concomitantly increased production of reactive oxygen species. Affected neurons display deficits in short-term plasticity and an <b>impaired</b> <b>capability</b> to sustain synaptic activity. These deficits lead to an impairment in spatial memory, which can be rescued by pharmacological treatment with the glutathione precursor N-acetyl cysteine (NAC). Our results implicate LG 72 -induced mitochondrial and synaptic defects as a possible pathomechanism of psychiatric disorders...|$|E

The important characteristics of these methods are noted and two are selected for further consideration. These two methods, the failure detection filter and generalized parity relations, are described. Results of experiments are then given of detection and isolation of sensor failures using data taken on the Mini-Mast facility at the NASA Langley Research Center. The effects of certain design options are illustrated. The paper concludes with some observations about the general problem of monitoring the health of control systems...|$|E
40|$|Presenilin 1 (PS 1) {{interacts with}} telencephalin (TLN) and the amyloid {{precursor}} protein via their transmembrane domain (Annaert, W. G., C. Esselens, V. Baert, C. Boeve, G. Snellings, P. Cupers, K. Craessaerts, and B. De Strooper. 2001. Neuron. 32 : 579 - 589). Here, we demonstrate that TLN is not a substrate for gamma-secretase cleavage, but displays a prolonged half-life in PS 1 (-/-) hippocampal neurons. TLN accumulates in intracellular structures bearing characteristics of autophagic vacuoles including the presence of Apg 12 p and LC 3. Importantly, the TLN accumulations are suppressed by adenoviral expression of wild-type, FAD-linked and D 257 A mutant PS 1, indicating that this phenotype is independent from gamma-secretase activity. Cathepsin D deficiency also results in the localization of TLN to autophagic vacuoles. TLN mediates the uptake of microbeads concomitant with actin and PIP 2 recruitment, indicating a phagocytic origin of TLN accumulations. Absence of endosomal/lysosomal proteins suggests that the TLN-positive vacuoles fail to fuse with endosomes/lysosomes, preventing their acidification and further degradation. Collectively, PS 1 deficiency affects in a gamma-secretase-independent fashion the turnover of TLN through autophagic vacuoles, most likely by an <b>impaired</b> <b>capability</b> to fuse with lysosomes. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we have {{investigated}} the insulin secretory response to glucose and other secretagogues (2 -ketoisocaproate, 3 -isobutyl- 1 -methyl-xanthine and arginine) of pancreatic islets isolated from Sprague-Dawley rats of various ages (from 2 to 28 months). Our results showed a significant decline in the glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, starting at 12 months of age. On the other hand, the response to non-glucose secretagogues (and mainly to 2 -ketoisocaproate) was less impaired with advancing age than that to glucose. We also observed a progressive age-related decline of protein levels of the glucose transporter GLUT- 2 in pancreatic islets, which was temporally concomitant and quantitatively comparable with the beta-cell alteration in glucose responsiveness (- 40 / 50 %). Finally, we observed a significant increase of the islets insulin content in older rats with respect to younger animals. We conclude that in the islet of older rats the <b>impaired</b> <b>capability</b> to respond to glucose could be dependent, at least in part, on the age-dependent reduction in GLUT- 2 and could be compensated by mechanisms including a preserved responsiveness to non-glucose secretagogues and/or the development of islet hypertrophy...|$|E

Monocytes show a diminished capability of both producing proinflammatory cytokines and antigen presentation after trauma. TLR 2, TLR 4, and TLR 9 recognize pathogens and subsequently activate monocytes. While there are conflictive data about TLR 2 and TLR 4 expression after trauma, no studies about {{the expression of}} TLR 2, TLR 4, TLR 9, and HLA-DR on monocytes from TP after their secondary ex vivo-in vitro “hit” have been reported. Methods/Results. Ex vivo-in vitro lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) stimulated blood from TP showed diminished interleukin- (IL-) 1 β-release in TP for five postinjury days compared to healthy volunteers (HV). The recovery was observed at day 5. In parallel, monocytes from TP showed an <b>impaired</b> <b>capability</b> of TLR 2, TLR 4, and TLR 9 expression after secondary stimulation compared to HV, while the measurement of unstimulated samples showed significant reduction of TLR 4 and TLR 9 at ED.

Psoriasis affects high-density lipoprotein (HDL) composition, generating dysfunctional HDL particles. However, data regarding the impact of anti-psoriatic therapy on HDL composition and function are not available. HDL was isolated from 15 psoriatic patients at baseline and after effective topical and/or systemic anti-psoriatic therapy and from 15 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. HDL from psoriatic patients showed a significantly <b>impaired</b> <b>capability</b> to mobilize cholesterol from macrophages (6. 4 vs. 8. 0 % [3 H]cholesterol efflux, P< 0. 001), low paraoxonase (217 vs. 350 [*]μM− 1 [*]minute− 1 [*]mg− 1 protein, P= 0. 011) and increased Lp-PLA 2 activities (19. 9 vs. 12. 1 [*]nM− 1 [*]minute− 1 [*]mg− 1 protein, P= 0. 028). Of particular interest, the anti-psoriatic therapy significantly improved serum lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase activity and decreased total serum lipolytic activity but did not affect serum levels of HDL-cholesterol. Most importantly, these changes were associated with a significantly improved HDL-cholesterol efflux capability. Our results provide evidence that effective anti-psoriatic therapy recovers HDL composition and function, independent of serum HDL-cholesterol levels, and support to the emerging concept that HDL function {{may be a better}} marker of cardiovascular risk than HDL-cholesterol levels...|$|E

40|$|Dendritic cells (DC) play a {{key role}} in linking innate and {{adaptive}} immunity. In inflamed tissues, where DC become activated, oxygen tensions are usually low. Although hypoxia is increasingly recognized as an important determinant of cellular functions, the consequences of hypoxia and the role of one of the key players in hypoxic gene regulation, the transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor 1 α (HIF- 1 α), are largely unknown. Thus, we investigated the effects of hypoxia and HIF- 1 alpha on murine DC activation and function in the presence or absence of an exogenous inflammatory stimulus. Hypoxia alone did not activate murine DC, but hypoxia combined with LPS led to marked increases in expression of costimulatory molecules, proinflammatory cytokine synthesis, and induction of allogeneic lymphocyte proliferation compared with LPS alone. This DC activation was accompanied by accumulation of HIF- 1 α protein levels, induction of glycolytic HIF target genes, and enhanced glycolytic activity. Using RNA interference techniques, knockdown of HIF- 1 alpha significantly reduced glucose use in DC, inhibited maturation, and led to an <b>impaired</b> <b>capability</b> to stimulate allogeneic T cells. Alltogether, our data indicate that HIF- 1 α and hypoxia play a crucial role for DC activation in inflammatory states, which is highly dependent on glycolysis even in the presence of oxygen...|$|E

Different factors are involved in these two processes. In recent years, members of the DnaJ-like zinc finger domain proteins {{have been found to}} take part in the biogenesis and/or the maintenance of plastids. One member of this family of proteins, PSA 2, was recently found to localize to the thylakoid lumen and regulate the accumulation of photosystem I. In this study, we report that the silencing of PSA 2 in Arabidopsis thaliana resulted in variegated leaves and retarded growth. Although both chlorophylls and total carotenoids decreased in the psa 2 mutant, violaxanthin and zeaxanthin accumulated in the mutant seedlings grown under growth condition. Lower levels of non-photochemical quenching and electron transport rate were also found in the psa 2 mutant seedlings under growth condition compared with those of the wild-type plants, indicating an <b>impaired</b> <b>capability</b> to acclimate to normal light irradiance when PSA 2 was silenced. Moreover, we also observed an abnormal assembly of grana thylakoids and poorly developed stroma thylakoids in psa 2 chloroplasts.

However, their precise role in the modification reaction remains undetermined. Here, we show that GidA is an FAD-binding protein and that mutagenesis of the N-terminal dinucleotide-binding motif of GidA, <b>impairs</b> <b>capability</b> of this protein to bind FAD and modify tRNA, resulting in defective cell growth. Thus, GidA may catalyse an FAD-dependent reac-tion that is required for production of cmnmU 34. We also show that GidA and MnmE have identical cell location and that both proteins physically interact. Gel filtration and native PAGE experiments indicate that GidA, like MnmE, dimerizes and that GidA and MnmE directly assemble in an a 2 b 2 heterotetrameric complex. Interestingly, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) anal-ysis shows that identical levels of the same undermodified form of U 34 are present in tRNA hydrolysates from loss-of-function gidA and mnmE mutants. Moreover, these mutants exhibit similar phenotypic traits. Altogether, these results do not support previous proposals that activity of MnmE precedes that of GidA; rather, our data suggest that MnmE and GidA form a functional complex in which both proteins are interdependent...|$|R
40|$|Until recently, {{scholars}} have customarily lumped multiple dimensions of environmental change into single constructs, and usually ascertained {{that the more}} the context changes, the more value firms derive from higher levels of exploration. In sync with more recent studies focusing on specific dimensions of change, {{in this paper we}} borrow theoretical elements from systems theory to examine the possibility that the reward to developing innovative product components may itself be eroded by implicit and yet burgeoning costs to fit the new component technology into existing architectures, thereby dampening system performance. Specifically, we theoretically assess how varying magnitudes of industry regulatory changes affect the optimum level of firm exploration, and propose—counterintuitively vis-à-vis past literature—that the more radical (i. e., competence destroying), as opposed to incremental (i. e., competence enhancing), these changes are, the more the optimum intensity of firm exploration recedes. Based on quantitative as well as qualitative empirical analyses from the Formula One racing industry, we precisely trace the observed performance outcomes back to the underlying logic of our theory, stressing that <b>impaired</b> <b>capabilities</b> to integrate the new component in the architecture redesign and time-based cognitive limitations both operate to inhibit the otherwise positive relationship between firm exploration and performance.

Here we investigated the {{mechanisms by which}} MKP- 2 modulates central nervous system (CNS) inflammation in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Our results show that MKP- 2 mRNA levels in the spinal cord and lymphoid organs of EAE mice were increased compared with naive controls, indicating an important role for MKP- 2 in EAE development. Indeed, MKP- 2 -/- mice developed reduced EAE severity, associated with diminished CNS immune cell infiltration, decreased proinflammatory cytokine production and reduced frequency of CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells in spleens and lymph nodes. In addition, MKP- 2 -/- CD 11 c+ dendritic cells (DCs) had reduced expression of MHC-II and CD 40 compared with MKP- 2 +/+ mice. Subsequent experiments revealed that CD 4 + T cells from naïve MKP- 2 -/- mice had decreased cell proliferation and IL- 2 and IL- 17 production relative to wild type controls. Furthermore, co-culture experiments showed that bone marrow derived DCs of MKP- 2 -/-mice had <b>impaired</b> <b>capability</b> in antigen presentation and T cell activation.

40|$|Background: Most {{previous}} neuroimaging {{studies have}} focused on the structural and functional abnormalities of local brain regions in major depressive disorder (MDD). Moreover, the exactly topological organization of networks underlying MDD remains unclear. This study examined the aberrant global and regional topological patterns of the brain white matter networks in MDD patients. Methods: The diffusion tensor imaging data were obtained from 27 patients with MDD and 40 healthy controls. The brain fractional anisotropy-weighted structural networks were constructed, and the global network and regional nodal metrics of the networks were explored by the complex network theory. Results: Compared with the healthy controls, the brain structural network of MDD patients showed an intact small-world topology, but significantly abnormal global network topological organization and regional nodal characteristic of the network in MDD were found. Our findings also indicated that the brain structural networks in MDD patients become a less strongly integrated network with a reduced central role of some key brain regions. Conclusions: All these resulted in a less optimal topological organization of networks underlying MDD patients, including an <b>impaired</b> <b>capability</b> of local information processing, reduced centrality of some brain regions and limited capacity to integrate information across different regions. Thus, these global network and regional node-level aberrations might contribute to understanding the pathogenesis of MDD from the view of the brain network...|$|E

The experimental session consisted of passive viewing of 75 affective pictures, divided in three emotional categories: pleasant, neutral and unpleasant. Slides were randomly presented for 6 seconds. During picture viewing, startle reflex, pre-pulse inhibition (PPI), and evoked potentials from three scalp sites (Pz, F 7, and F 8) were recorded. Results showed an impaired startle reflex habituation in BR subjects compared to controls. The PPI task, which reflects orienting of attention towards primary stimulus, showed in BR a reduced elaboration of unpleasant stimuli compared to pleasant stimuli. Furthermore, evoked potentials showed specific cortical inhibition to arousing emotional pictures in BR subjects compared to controls, this occurred at both, intermediate component (P 300) and late positive complex (SPW).

40|$|OBJECTIVES— To {{investigate}} {{capabilities of}} arm trajectory modification {{in patients with}} Parkinson's disease and elderly subjects using a double step target displacement paradigm.  METHODS—Nine patients with Parkinson's disease and seven age matched control subjects were instructed to move a stylus towards visual targets presented on a digitising table. Within each session, in some trials the target location was changed before initiation of movement and the subjects were to modify their movements towards the new target (switching trials). In other trials the target location was not changed (control trials). This procedure was repeated for four different target configurations, using interstimulus time intervals of six different durations. The subjects' hand trajectories were recorded and their kinematic characteristics were analysed.  RESULTS—In switching trials, about 40 % of the movements were aimed directly toward the final target location in both groups. When the trajectories were initially directed toward the first target and then modified toward the second, the reaction time (RT) to the second stimulus (RT 2) was longer than to the first stimulus (RT 1). The RT 2 /RT 1 ratio was significantly larger in patients with Parkinson's disease than in healthy elderly subjects.  CONCLUSIONS—Patients with Parkinson's disease and elderly subjects are substantially slower in responding to a required modification of their movement than {{in responding to the}} required movement initiation.

40|$|The {{development}} of the cerebral cortex requires coordinated regulation of proliferation, specification, migration and differentiation of cortical progenitors into functionally integrated neurons. The completion of the neurogenic program requires a dynamic interplay between cell intrinsic regulators and extrinsic cues, such as growth factor and neurotransmitters. We previously demonstrated a role for extrasynaptic glycine receptors (GlyRs) containing the α 2 subunit in cerebral cortical neurogenesis, revealing that endogenous GlyR activation promotes interneuron migration in the developing cortical wall. The proliferative compartment of the cortex comprises apical progenitors that give birth to neurons directly or indirectly through the generation of basal progenitors, which serve as amplification step to generate the bulk of cortical neurons. The present work shows that genetic inactivation of Glra 2, the gene coding the α 2 subunit of GlyRs, disrupts dorsal cortical progenitor homeostasis with an <b>impaired</b> <b>capability</b> of apical progenitors to generate basal progenitors. This defect results in an overall reduction of projection neurons that settle in upper or deep layers of the cerebral cortex. Overall, the depletion of cortical neurons observed in Glra 2 -knockout embryos leads to moderate microcephaly in newborn Glra 2 -knockout mice. Taken together, our findings support a contribution of GlyR α 2 to early processes in cerebral cortical neurogenesis that are required later for the proper {{development of}} cortical circuits...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that {{individual}} amino acid exchanges within elongation factor G (EF-G) cause fusidic acid resistance in Staphylococcus aureus. The data from the present study illustrate that the fusidic acid resistance-mediating amino acid substitutions P 406 L and H 457 Y are associated with a marked impairment of the biological fitness of S. aureus. In particular, strains producing EF-G derivatives with these mutations showed reduced growth, decreased plasma coagulase activity, and an <b>impaired</b> <b>capability</b> to compete with the isogenic wild-type strain. Second-site mutations within EF-G, such as A 67 T and S 416 F, that have been encountered in clinical fusidic acid-resistant isolates containing the amino acid exchanges P 406 L and H 457 Y, respectively, were shown not to contribute to resistance. Furthermore, the substitution A 67 T had no impact on the biological fitness in vitro. The exchange S 416 F, however, was found to function as a fitness-compensating mutation in S. aureus carrying the substitution H 457 Y in EF-G. In conclusion, the data presented in this report provide evidence at the molecular level that the deleterious effects of fusidic acid resistance-mediating exchanges within EF-G of S. aureus can be reduced considerably by specific compensating mutations in this target protein. This compensatory adaptation most likely plays {{a significant role in the}} stabilization of resistant bacteria within a given population...|$|E
40|$|A mutational {{and genetic}} {{analysis}} of the poliovirus protein 3 A {{has led to the}} identification of a single amino acid mutant virus with a restrictive phenotype to form plaques in Vero cells. This mutant (I 46 T 3 A) can be grown and amplified in HeLa cells, where virus replication takes place at wild-type levels. However, Vero cells infected with this virus cannot complete the growth cycle. I 46 T 3 A virus has a defect in the ability to kill Vero cells, as estimated by FACS analysis of propidium iodide uptake by dead cells. Since these defects are observed under conditions where no abnormalities in the rate of synthesis and processing of the mutant polyprotein occur, the inability to induce the cytopathic effect in infected Vero cells denotes the existence of a defect in the activity of 3 A, but not the level of expression of the viral genome. As a consequence of this <b>impaired</b> <b>capability</b> to generate the cytopathic effect, I 46 T 3 A mutant viruses cannot be titrated by plaque assay in Vero cells. Only revertant viruses with the wild-type sequence arise and form lysis plaques in Vero cells.

The proposed system outperforms conventional companding systems using the same nonlinear companding functions with respect to SER with-out <b>impairing</b> PAPR reduction <b>capability.</b> The proposed system estimates a few autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model parameters of the difference signal between the companded and uncompanded OFDM envelopes and passes these parameters to the receiver. Upon receiving the ARMA model parameters, the receiver regenerates the difference signal and then adds it to the received companded OFDM envelope to recover the uncompanded OFDM signal. The traditional schemes employ decompanding process instead to reconstruct the uncompanded OFDM signal. Mathematical proofs and simulation results for three typical nonlinear companding functions show that, under mild sufficient conditions, the proposed scheme outperforms the conventional schemes with respect to SER performance without <b>impairing</b> PAPR reduction <b>capability.</b> I...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the concept of}} the self- and metarepresentation capabilities of the organization, a constituent of what we call the organizational mind. Our claim is that these capabilities are responsible for the emergence of a collective self that is of central importance {{in the formation of the}} organizational identity. These capabilities are relevant to the information systems field, as Information Technology applications play a central role in the support of those representational capabilities. The paper presents a summary of a theoretical perspective that supports a research project aimed at developing a framework to guide managers diagnosing identity dysfunctions resulting from <b>impaired</b> representational <b>capabilities</b> of the organization.
