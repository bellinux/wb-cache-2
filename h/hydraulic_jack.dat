50|$|Two {{options were}} {{initially}} considered for moving the structure: <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jacks</b> {{to push the}} structure forward, or pulling the structure with large, multi-stranded steel cables. The first option would require the relocation of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jacks</b> after each push. This relocation process would necessitate more worker interaction with the system and a greater worker exposure to radiation. The second option was initially chosen because it would expose workers to a lower radiation dose, and would have moved the structure into its final position in less than 24 hours. However, the structure was moved using <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jacks</b> making the 327-meter move starting on 14 November 2016 and ending on 29 November.|$|R

500|$|Having {{mastered}} {{his trade}} repairing chimneys, Dibnah {{became aware of}} the demand for a cost-effective method of demolishing them. He offered to remove them without using explosives, by cutting an ingress {{at the base of the}} chimney—supporting the brickwork with wooden props—and then burning away the props so that the chimney fell, hopefully in the intended direction. Although this was a tried and tested method, it was not without its opponents. On one occasion he was contracted by the local council to fell two chimneys. The contract obliged him to dismantle each by hand, but he decided to fell them by cutting away the base. The first chimney collapsed as planned, but the council terminated his contract and refused to pay. Dibnah contacted the borough engineer and offered to fell the second chimney for no charge, to prove the effectiveness of his technique. He even offered to let the engineer light the fire, but the wind blew so hard that the chimney did not draw the flames and once the props had been burnt through, it remained standing. Dibnah resorted to using a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jack</b> to apply extra pressure to the intact side of the base and the chimney eventually fell. He later told the engineer that [...] "it was all about fine balancing and counteracting high wind forces." [...] He almost lost his life in 1997, when a concrete chimney he had been asked to fell on Canvey Island began to collapse before the felling team had finished preparing the base. As the team ran from the chimney, Dibnah tripped and fell and was greeted by the sight of 2,500 tonnes of concrete leaning toward him, but fortunately the chimney righted itself and then fell in the opposite direction. He felled his last chimney in Royton, in May 2004.|$|E
2500|$|As {{a student}} in Claremont, Griffin was {{initially}} interested in Eastern religions, particularly Vedanta. [...] However, he started to become a process theologian while attending John B. Cobb’s seminar on Whitehead’s philosophy. According to Griffin, process theology, as presented by Cobb, “provided a way between the old supernaturalism, according to which God miraculously interrupted the normal causal processes now and then, and a view according to which God is something like a cosmic <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jack,</b> exerting the same pressure always and everywhere (which described rather aptly the position to which I had come)" [...] (Primordial Truth and Postmodern Theology). Griffin applied Whitehead’s thought to the traditional theological subjects of christology and theodicy and argued that process theology also provided a sound basis for addressing contemporary social and ecological issues.|$|E

40|$|Pretensioned {{high-strength}} concrete (PHC) pipe piles {{have been}} widely used for geotechnical engineering such as foundation engineering, slope engineering, highway engineering. To study the performance of a PHC pipe pile under <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jacking,</b> the monitoring of the strain profile along the PHC pipe pile under <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jacking</b> was carried out using FBG sensing technology. In this study, a PHC pipe pile was instrumented with two series of fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors along pile axial direction and was then installed in the field using a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jacking</b> method. To monitor the variation of strains along a PHC pile, two series of eight FBG strain sensors with different peak wavelengths were mounted {{on opposite sides of the}} pile with one meter spacing. In addition, based on the pile theory, both the axial force of the pile and average shear stress on the pile surface are calculated using the measured axial strains. It is found that there were significant residual strains in the piles after installation when hydraulic force was removed. This study confirms that the fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors are suitable for monitoring strain distribution along a pile under <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jacking.</b> Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|R

2500|$|The Hurricane was {{furnished}} with a laterally-retracting undercarriage, the main undercarriage units {{being able to}} slide into recesses within the wing. Hinged telescopic Vickers-built legs {{are attached to the}} bottom boom of the wing's forward spar, but with a complex [...] "pintle" [...] angle setup within the wing {{at the top of the}} strut, to allow the strut to be angled forwards when extended, and rearwards when retracted to clear the forward spar. A <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jack</b> served to actuate the undercarriage, folding and pivoting the legs as to reposition the wheel unit rearwards well as inwards in order to clear the front spar when retracted. Two separate hydraulic systems, one being power-operated and the other hand operated, are present for the deployment and retraction of the undercarriage; in the event of both failing, pilots can release the retaining catches holding the undercarriage in place, deploying the wheels to the 'down' position using weight alone. A wide wheel-track was used to allow for considerable stability during ground movements and to enable tight turns to be performed.|$|E

40|$|<b>Hydraulic</b> <b>jacking</b> is a {{significant}} dilation of a fracture that occurs when the pore pressure within it exceeds {{the sum of the}} fracture's normal stress and tensile strength. This phenomenon may occur during a glacial period because of changes in hydraulic and mechanical boundary conditions. Since <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jacking</b> may alter flow patterns and the transport capacity of the rock mass, its possible effects on the long-term performance of a nuclear waste repository should be considered. We develop an approach to assess glacially induced <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jacking</b> in fractured crystalline rock and establish bounding estimates of the maximum jacking depth for the Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Management Company's (SKB) repository site at Forsmark. The pore pressure is estimated using mechanically uncoupled two-dimensional poroelastic continuum models with hydraulic and mechanical conditions based on SKB's reconstruction of the Weichselian glaciation at this site (120 - 0 kaB. P.). For warm-based conditions, the water pressure at the ice/bed interface is set at 98 % of the mechanical load, whereas for glacial conditions with extensive proglacial permafrost, the corresponding water pressure is set at a (lower) annual average value. We demonstrate that the pore pressure within the uppermost kilometer of rock is mainly governed by the water pressure at the ice/bed interface and that the mechanical impact of the ice load on the pore pressure is sufficiently small to be ignored. Given the current and estimated future stress conditions at Forsmark, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jacking</b> is mainly of concern for subhorizontal fractures, i. e., it is sufficient to consider situations when the pore pressure exceeds the vertical stress. We conclude that <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jacking</b> at Forsmark will be confined to the uppermost 200 m of the rock mass...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the problem of {{mountain}} river crossing in old towns whose urban morphology often prevents one from building a ramp to access the bridge. If this is the case, the proposed solution consists in designing a bridge which can be lifted when a flood occurs. Some bridges of this kind are actually on duty in the Italian Alps but all of them are moved by means of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jacks.</b> A table bridge moved by the buoyancy force of the river water is suggested. The design concept is here specified for a real case where a floating bridge is placed in the position where a bridge moved by <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jacks</b> was built. This choice enables one to compare the two solutions under the same conditions. The simplicity and robustness of the design, as well as the possibility of fully automatic functioning without any external support (i. e. electric energy) lead the authors to state that the floating bridge suggested is preferable to a bridge lifted by means of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jacks...</b>|$|R
