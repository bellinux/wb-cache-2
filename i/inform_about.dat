5|$|The first Castellania {{was built}} in 1572, during the magistracy of Grand Master Jean de la Cassière, and was likely {{designed}} by Girolamo Cassar, similar to other Valletta buildings of the late 16th century. The building had a military appearance, with the corners designed with massive quoins, typical of Cassar. The Castellania made use of bells to attract people and <b>inform</b> <b>about</b> an event, such as a guilty verdict. Similar to other prominent buildings, the Castellania was provided with water within its courtyard by connection to the Wignacourt Aqueduct.|$|E

25|$|The federal {{government}} had been subject to intense lobbying by the Railway Association of Canada and the Canadian Pacific Railway prior to the disaster, with railway association lobbyists meeting with multiple federal officials “to <b>inform</b> <b>about</b> the movement of dangerous goods, including voluntary and regulatory requirements, volumes, customers and safety measures to assure them that current regulations for dangerous goods transportation are sufficient.” A similar situation exists in the US, with nearly $47 million/year in lobbying to delay safety measures such as positive train control.|$|E

25|$|Not {{only the}} stations, {{but also the}} {{railways}} were patrolled. In Estonia, the patrols were attacked in three separate incidents. One of these incidents near Püssi resulted in the derailment of three railway cars on March 27. The patrols, among other things, picked up letters thrown out the train window by the deportees. The letters would usually <b>inform</b> <b>about</b> the deportation, send farewells to relatives and homeland, complain about conditions on the train, and express anti-Soviet feelings. On average, the train ride lasted about two weeks, but could take almost a month. For example, a train left Võru on March 29 and arrived to Makaryevo station in Svirsk on April 22. According to an MVD report from 30 May, from Estonian deportees, 45 people died en route and 62 {{were removed from the}} trains due to medical conditions.|$|E
25|$|According to Ziethaml et al., layout affects {{how easy}} or {{difficult}} it is to navigate through a system. Signs and symbols provide cues for directional navigation and also <b>inform</b> <b>about</b> appropriate behaviour within a store. Functionality refers to extent to which the equipment and layout meet the goals of the customer. For instance, in the case of supermarkets, the customer's goal may be to minimise {{the amount of time spent}} finding items and waiting at the check-out, while a customer in a retail mall may wish to spend more time exploring the range of stores and merchandise. With respect to functionality of layout, retail designers consider three key issues; circulation– design for traffic-flow and that encourages customers to traverse the entire store; coordination– design that combines goods and spaces in order to suggest customer needs and convenience– design that arranges items to create a degree of comfort and access for both customers and employees.|$|E

Apart from the 3,6 meters large, orange pillars, several signs <b>inform</b> <b>about</b> the wall victims. A planned stele for Lothar Hennig in Sacrow was not built for the time being, because Henning is viewed skeptically {{as a result of his}} actions for the MfS as a former IM [...]|$|E

2500|$|Even {{though the}} {{official}} mass-media did not <b>inform</b> <b>about</b> the strikes, events of Lublin became {{known in the}} area. Soon afterwards, strikes began in such towns, as Chełm, Kraśnik, Lubartów, Opole Lubelskie, Puławy, Tomaszów Lubelski, Zamość and in the crucial rail junction of Dęblin. [...] The strikes of the Lublin and Dęblin junctions paralyzed rail links between the Soviet Union and the Red Army garrisons in the German Democratic Republic. The direct reason for railway workers protesting was terrible working conditions. 'We repaired wagons in canals, completely smeared with mud', one of them recollected.|$|E
2500|$|In late 1815 {{and early}} 1816, the Lafitte {{brothers}} agreed {{to act as}} spies for Spain, which was embroiled in the Mexican War of Independence. Collectively they were known as [...] "Number thirteen". Pierre was to <b>inform</b> <b>about</b> the situation in New Orleans, and Jean was sent to Galveston Island, a part of Spanish Texas {{that served as the}} home base of Louis-Michel Aury, a French privateer who claimed to be a Mexican revolutionary. By early 1817, other revolutionaries had begun to congregate at Galveston, hoping to make it their base to wrest Mexico from Spanish control. Lafitte visited in March 1817. Two weeks into his stay, the two leaders of the revolutionaries left the island.|$|E
