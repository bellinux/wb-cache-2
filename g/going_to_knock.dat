They're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> you for six." [...] In early October 1960, Storm and the Hurricanes were free to travel to Hamburg, replacing Derry and the Seniors at the Kaiserkeller. They arrived in Hamburg on 1 October 1960, having negotiated to be paid more than the Seniors or the Beatles. They played five or six 90-minute sets every day, alternating with the Beatles. They were appalled at the living conditions the Beatles and other groups like Howie Casey and the Seniors (who were sleeping in one room {{at the back of the}} Kaiserkeller) had to put up with, so they booked into Hamburg's Seamens' Mission.|$|E
500|$|Cannon first {{played for}} the LSU varsity {{football}} team as a sophomore in 1957 under coach Paul Dietzel. He played in the halfback position and shared the backfield with Jim Taylor, who was selected as an All-American that year. He also played defensive back and was the team's primary punter. He quickly emerged as a star, scoring twice in early season victories over Alabama and Texas Tech. The Alabama game was the most prolific rushing game of Cannon's college career; he amassed 140 yards with eight carries. Against the Red Raiders, Cannon had five punts for a 40-yard average, completed two of four passes for 31 yards, caught a 59-yard pass for a touchdown, carried thirteen times for 36 yards, and returned a kickoff for a touchdown. Cannon recalled that Texas Tech's focus was solely on Taylor. [...] "They were just wearing Jimmy out", he said. [...] "Of course, they weren't looking for me. They just beat the devil out of Jimmy. With them focusing on Jimmy, I had a great game." [...] Over half a century later, former Red Raiders standout Jack Henry recalled of Cannon:"We kicked off. And that damn Billy Cannon. Jim Henderson and I were running down in our lanes and got down there, {{and we were going}} to hit him high and low. We were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> the hell out of him... We hit ourselves. Ran into each other. He made a 100-yard touchdown. You don't forget that." ...|$|E

2500|$|Newark {{burned in}} 1967, where {{six days of}} rioting left 26 dead, 1500 injured, and the inner city a burned out shell. In Detroit in 1967, Governor George Romney sent in 7400 {{national}} guard troops to quell fire bombings, looting, and attacks on businesses and on police. Johnson finally sent in federal troops with tanks and machine guns. Detroit continued to burn for three more days until finally 43 were dead, 2250 were injured, 4000 were arrested; property damage ranged into the hundreds of millions. The biggest wave of riots came in April 1968 in over a hundred cities after the assassination of Martin Luther King. Johnson called for even more billions to be spent in the cities and another federal civil rights law regarding housing, but this fell on deaf ears. Johnson's popularity plummeted as a massive white political backlash took shape, reinforcing the sense Johnson had {{lost control of the}} streets of major cities as well as his party. Johnson created the Kerner Commission to study the problem of urban riots, headed by Illinois Governor Otto Kerner. According to press secretary George Christian, Johnson was unsurprised by the riots, saying: [...] "What did you expect? I don't know why we're so surprised. When you put your foot on a man's neck and hold him down for three hundred years, and then you let him up, what's he going to do? He's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> your block off." ...|$|E

[...] The couple visit Matt Carter (Oliver Mellor) at the medical centre looking for an explanation. Doctor Carter reveals that a vasectomy is not always 100% effective.

García explained that Ríos was [...] "joking around", and that Brandon was also unaware that Roach suffers from Parkinson's disease.

[...] Tom Shone, reviewing for The Guardian, maintained a similar tone in his review, saying of Neeson, [...] "Hes at his best striding {{up and down the aisles}} of the aircraft with that big, rolling gait of his, carving out great wads of air with his hands, barking orders, his face in Rodin-ish profile, his destiny, like Mitchums, enlivened by a nobility far greater than the film he finds himself in - the true sign of a B-movie king.", and of Moore [...] "...Neeson enjoys a nice, relaxed rapport with Moore, whose looser, Keaton-esque side seems to come out when cast opposite noble hunks." ...|$|R
