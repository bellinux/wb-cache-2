5|$|Sometimes {{referred}} to as European radishes or spring radishes if they are planted in cooler weather, summer radishes are generally small and <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> short three- to four-week cultivation time.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} ratites, emus <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> low basal {{metabolic}} rate compared to other types of birds. At , the metabolic rate of an emu sitting down is about 60% of that when standing, partly because the lack of feathers under the stomach leads to {{a higher rate of}} heat loss when standing from the exposed underbelly.|$|E
5|$|Binary and multi-star systems {{consist of}} two or more stars that are gravitationally bound and {{generally}} move around each other in stable orbits. When two such stars <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> close orbit, their gravitational interaction can {{have a significant impact on}} their evolution. Stars can form part of a much larger gravitationally bound structure, such as a star cluster or a galaxy.|$|E

5|$|Breadth of {{definition}} of a good: The broader the {{definition of a}} good (or service), the lower the elasticity. For example, Company X's fish and chips would tend to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> high elasticity of demand if a significant number of substitutes are available, whereas food in general would have an extremely low elasticity of demand because no substitutes exist.|$|E
5|$|Pink-flowering populations <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> {{distinct}} genetic makeup, whereas red {{or white}} flowering populations have more evident sharing of genetic traits. Research based on DNA profiling has revealed substantial genetic diversity {{within and between}} flower colour races and site populations. This has implications for vegetation projects in that provenance material needs to be collected from a wide geographic area to maintain this diversity.|$|E
5|$|River {{dolphins}} <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> {{thin layer}} of blubber. Blubber can help with buoyancy, protection from predators (they {{would have a hard}} time getting through a thick layer of fat), energy for leaner times, and insulation from harsh climates. The habitats of river dolphins lack these needs.|$|E

50|$|The coaster was {{described}} by The Roller Coaster Lover's Companion as <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> mild ride experience (2 on a 5-point scale) and 3 out of 5 five stars for ride quality. The Philadelphia Inquirer similarly described the coaster as <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> mild ride experience upon its opening in 1999.|$|R
5|$|The only {{species that}} can {{potentially}} {{be confused with}} the Siberian accentor is the related black-throated accentor, since first-autumn birds of the latter species may <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> inconspicuous dark throat. The Siberian accentor is still distinguishable by its rustier back colour, yellow (not off-white) supercilium and the absence of a white line below the black face mask.|$|E
5|$|The pygmy {{blue whale}} formed from a founder group of Antarctic blue whales about 20,000 years ago, around the Last Glacial Maximum. This is likely because blue whales were driven north by {{expanding}} ice, {{and some have}} stayed there ever since. The pygmy blue whale's evolutionarily recent origins cause it to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> low genetic diversity.|$|E
5|$|When {{used as a}} tunable {{narrow band}} filter, Michelson interferometers exhibit a number of {{advantages}} and disadvantages when compared with competing technologies such as Fabry–Pérot interferometers or Lyot filters. Michelson interferometers have the largest field of view for a specified wavelength, and are relatively simple in operation, since tuning is via mechanical rotation of waveplates rather than via high voltage control of piezoelectric crystals or lithium niobate optical modulators as used in a Fabry–Pérot system. Compared with Lyot filters, which use birefringent elements, Michelson interferometers <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> low temperature sensitivity. On the negative side, Michelson interferometers <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> restricted wavelength range and require use of prefilters which restrict transmittance.|$|E

5|$|Wind shear is also {{a hazard}} for {{aircraft}} making steep turns near the ground. It is a particular problem for gliders which <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> long wingspan, which exposes them to a greater wind speed difference for a given bank angle. The different airspeed experienced by each wing tip can result in an aerodynamic stall on one wing, causing a loss of control accident.|$|E
5|$|Baleen whales <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> small brain {{compared}} to their body mass. Like other mammals, their brain has a large, folded cerebrum, {{the part of the}} brain responsible for memory and processing sensory information. Their cerebrum only makes up about 68% of their brain's weight, as opposed to human's 83%. The cerebellum, {{the part of the brain}} responsible for balance and coordination, makes up 18% of their brain's weight, {{compared to}} 10% in humans, which is probably due to the great degree of control necessary for constantly swimming. Necropsies on the brains of gray whales revealed iron oxide particles, which may allow them to find magnetic north like a compass.|$|E
5|$|Cockroaches are {{generalized}} insects, {{with few}} special adaptations, {{and may be}} among the most primitive living neopteran insects. They <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> small head and a broad, flattened body, and most species are reddish-brown to dark brown. They have large compound eyes, two ocelli, and long, flexible antennae. The mouthparts are {{on the underside of the}} head and include generalized chewing mandibles, salivary glands and various touch and taste receptors.|$|E

5|$|Each section, such as on {{reptiles}} at {{the start}} of Volume II (and the entire work) is introduced with an essay on distinguishing aspects of their zoology. In the case of the reptiles, the essay begins with the observation that their circulation is so arranged that only part of the blood pumped by the heart goes through the lungs; Cuvier discusses the implications of this arrangement, next observing that they <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> small brain compared to the mammals and birds, and that none of them incubate their eggs.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, {{the main}} {{industries}} of employment in Didsbury were 20% property and business services, 15% education, 15% {{health and social}} work, 10% retail and wholesale, 9% manufacturing, 6% transport and communications, 5% financial services, 4% hotels and restaurants, 4% construction, 4% public administration and defence, and 8% other. These figures {{were similar to those}} from surrounding areas, but Didsbury did <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> larger education sector than other nearby wards, perhaps explained by the high density of schools in the area. A significant number of people (12%) commute to areas outside Didsbury; at the 2001 census there were 6,555 jobs in Didsbury, compared with the 7,417 employed residents.|$|E
5|$|MS is {{more common}} in people who live farther from the equator, {{although}} exceptions exist. These exceptions include ethnic groups that are at low risk far from the equator such as the Samis, Amerindians, Canadian Hutterites, New Zealand Māori, and Canada's Inuit, as well as groups that <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> high risk close to the equator such as Sardinians, inland Sicilians, Palestinians and Parsis. The cause of this geographical pattern is not clear. While the north-south gradient of incidence is decreasing, as of 2010 it is still present.|$|E

5|$|Octopuses <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> {{short life}} expectancy; some species live {{for as little}} as six months. The giant Pacific octopus, one of the two largest species of octopus, may live for as much as five years. Octopus {{lifespan}} is limited by reproduction: males can live for only a few months after mating, and females die shortly after their eggs hatch. Octopus reproductive organs mature due to the hormonal influence of the optic gland but result in the inactivation of their digestive glands, typically causing the octopus to eventually die from starvation. Experimental removal of both optic glands after spawning was found to result in the cessation of broodiness, the resumption of feeding, increased growth, and greatly extended lifespans.|$|E
5|$|S-type (silicate-rich) asteroids {{are more}} common toward the inner region of the belt, within 2.5 AU of the Sun. The spectra of their {{surfaces}} reveal the presence of silicates and some metal, but no significant carbonaceous compounds. This indicates that their materials have been significantly modified from their primordial composition, probably through melting and reformation. They <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> high albedo, and form about 17% of the total asteroid population.|$|E
5|$|Yttrium {{is found}} in most rare-earth minerals, it {{is found in}} some uranium ores, but is never found in the Earth's crust as a free element. About 31ppm of the Earth's crust is yttrium, making it the 28th most {{abundant}} element, 400 times more common than silver. Yttrium is found in soil in concentrations between 10 and 150ppm (dry weight average of 23ppm) and in sea water at 9ppt. Lunar rock samples collected during the American Apollo Project <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> high content of yttrium.|$|E
