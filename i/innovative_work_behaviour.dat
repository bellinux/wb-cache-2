However, the question of how this <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> <b>behaviour</b> can be stimulated remains unanswered. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to test empirically the effect of perceptions of four high-commitment HR practices on three dimensions of <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> <b>behaviour</b> by production workers. Disentangling three dimensions of <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> <b>behaviour</b> makes it conceptually possible to determine how perceived HRM can stimulate three different behavioural types linked to idea generation, idea championing, and idea application. The results of a survey among 328 workers in a Dutch manufacturing company show that four perceived HR practices (supportive supervision, training and development, information sharing, and compensation) have an effect on all three dimensions of <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Overall, positively perceived supportive supervision was found to be the most beneficial practice for <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> <b>behaviour...</b>|$|E
40|$|Innovation is a {{major concern}} of most organisations in today’s fast {{changing}} and highly competitive business environment. In particular, the individual <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> <b>behaviour</b> of employees has recently attracted the notice of both scholars and practitioners. Small and mediumsized enterprises (SMEs) {{play a significant role in}} economies around the globe, and the <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> <b>behaviour</b> of their employees is crucial to gain competitive advantage and leverage their performance against their larger rivals. However, understanding the underlying drivers of <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> <b>behaviour</b> is a complex and multifaceted undertaking that all organisations have to manage. For almost 30 years, since the emergence of the Big-Five taxonomy, personality has been understood to affect organisational performance, thus creativity and innovation scholars moved their attention to personality characteristics. However, with the sound settlement and validation of these relationships, new models have to be examined to deepen the understanding of the individual drivers of <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> <b>behaviour.</b> A sample of 124 employees from Swiss SMEs completed self-reported questionnaires to assess personality and job satisfaction regarding <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> <b>behaviour.</b> The results indicated that job satisfaction moderates the relationship between openness to experience and <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> <b>behaviour,</b> and moreover, also has a direct effect on the latter. Consistent with previous studies, openness to experience has been found to have a positive influence on <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> <b>behaviour,</b> whereas conscientiousness, in contradiction with other research, has been found to have no direct effect on <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> <b>behaviour.</b> In conclusion, the findings of this study demonstrate the importance of job satisfaction and openness to experience in promoting <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> <b>behaviour</b> for organisations and scholars likewise...|$|E
40|$|Fostering <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> <b>behaviour</b> amongst {{employees}} {{has evolved}} {{as an important}} tool for organisations’ survival since it aids the consistent need for improvement and value creation amidst increasing competition. In an effort to understand how such behaviour comes about, this study sets out to examine high-involvement human resource practices as an antecedent to the <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> <b>behaviour</b> of financial industry employees and whether work engagement mediates this relationship. Based on a sample of 218 financial industry employees working in Malaysia, results showed that recognition, as a dimension of high-involvement human resource practices, {{was positively related to}} <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Furthermore, the relationship between competence development and <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> <b>behaviour</b> is partially mediated by work engagement.

However, investigations into the comparative experiences of men and women in KIFs remain sparse, and little is known about women’s participation in the processes of innovation and knowledge exchange and combination that are core features of KIFs. We report on the findings of a study in the UK and Ireland involving 498 male and female knowledge workers in KIFs. Despite equal levels of qualification and experience, women are more likely to be in lower status and more insecure jobs. They also predominantly occupy roles featuring less variety and autonomy than men and, despite comparable levels of knowledge exchange and combination, are less likely to be in a position to translate this into the <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> <b>behaviours</b> necessary for career advancement.

40|$|This study {{presents}} a micro-level investigation that provides {{new insights into}} how employees' knowledge sharing affects their own <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> <b>behaviours</b> (IWBs). Our study posited three mechanisms linking an individual's knowledge sharing behaviours {{to his or her}} own IWBs: (i) a direct effect whereby the act of sharing elicits a recombination and translation of knowledge that facilitates innovation; (ii) an indirect effect whereby knowledge sharing creates social conditions (i. e., reciprocation with new knowledge) for innovation; (iii) a distal effect whereby the antecedents of knowledge sharing also promote innovation. We tested these hypotheses on 155 employees in four palliative care organizations. Our results provide original evidence that employees who share knowledge also engage more in creating, promoting and implementing innovations. This study reveals a direct, unmediated link between knowledge sharing behaviours and IWBs. Our evidence suggests that it is the act of knowledge recombination and translation embedded in knowledge sharing that exerts the most positive effect on IWBs. We discuss how this result indicates that sharing knowledge ignites transformation and exploitation capabilities that help sharers innovate their own work practices...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} was to {{contribute}} {{to an understanding of}} the nature and facilitation of vocational teachers’ <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> <b>behaviour</b> as a key element for the development of innovations in vocational colleges. <b>Innovative</b> <b>work</b> <b>behaviour</b> encompasses all physical and cognitive work activities employees carry out in their work context, either solitarily or in a social setting, to accomplish a set of tasks required for the development of an innovation. Innovations are new and potentially useful products or processes that address the problems and challenges of a particular work context and help to maintain or improve the current state of this context. Five prerequisite tasks for innovation development, that is, opportunity exploration, idea generation, idea promotion, idea realization, and reflection are distinguished. In this thesis a theoretical conceptualization of <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> <b>behaviour</b> as a dynamic, context-bound construct is presented. This conceptualization advances previous work by taking into account the timely and socio-cultural interdependence of employees’ work activities, the fundamental relation of work activities to a particular work context, and the importance of reflective and social work activities for innovation and professional development. The thesis encompasses five empirical and theoretical contributions that complementarily investigate the measurement and facilitation of <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> <b>behaviour.</b> In particular, it is illustrated how <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> <b>behaviour</b> can be measured as a dynamic, context-bound construct by grounding measurement on work activities employees have carried out in their work context during an episode of innovation development and by integrating the social and reflective components of innovation development. Furthermore, the studies with vocational teachers showed that innovations and individual contributions to their development represent a practically relevant aspect in vocational colleges and in vocational teachers’ work context for tackling problems and challenges inside and outside the classroom and for providing adequate job preparation for students. Finally, insight is provided into possibilities to facilitate vocational teachers’ <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> <b>behaviour.</b> In this respect, it seemed that in vocational colleges the initiation of <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> <b>behaviour</b> is driven by an interaction of contextual problems and opportunities with vocational teachers’ personal goals and needs. In addition, findings indicated that the performance of <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> <b>behaviour</b> is determined by characteristics of professionalism as well as by vocational teachers’ intrinsic motivation, their self-directed individual perceptions, and the available social support...|$|E
40|$|Purpose - The aim of {{this paper}} is examine how a system of human {{resource}} management (HRM) practices, labelled high performance work systems (HPWS), influences organizational innovation in professional service firms (PSFs). In this study, innovation in PSFs is seen as an indicator of firm performance and is calculated as the revenue per person generated from new clients and new services respectively. Design/methodology/approach– Quantitative data was collected from 195 Managing Partners, HR Managers or experienced Partners in 120 Irish accounting firms. Hierarchical regression analysis was used to test the hypotheses. Findings - The analysis results indicate strong support for the mediating role of employees’ <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> <b>behaviours</b> in the relationship between HPWS and two types of PSFs’ innovation performance. Practical implications - Managers need to effectively adopt and implement innovation-based HRM practices to encourage and support employees’ creative thinking and innovation. Through the adoption and utilization of these practices managers can enhance the firm’s innovation and its performance. Originality/value - This study contributes {{to our understanding of the}} link between HRM and firm innovation by explicating a pathway between these variables. This study also generalizes consistent findings on the HRM-firm innovation relationship to a different context, i. e. professional service firms. ...|$|R
40|$|It is now {{consensus}} that engaging in <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> <b>behaviours</b> is {{not restricted to}} traditional innovation jobs (e. g., research and development), but {{that they can be}} performed on a discretionary basis in most of today’s jobs. To date, our knowledge on the role of workplace stressors for discretionary innovative behaviour, in particular for innovation implementation is limited. We draw on a cybernetic view as well as on a transactional, coping-based perspective with stress to propose differential effects of stressors on innovation implementation. We propose that work demands {{have a positive effect on}} innovation implementation, whereas role-based stressors - i. e., role conflict, role ambiguity, and professional compromise – have a negative effect. We conducted a time-lagged, survey-based study in the health care sector (Study 1, UK: N = 235 nurses). Innovation implementation was measured two years after the assessment of the stressors. Supporting our hypotheses, work demands were positively, role ambiguity and professional compromise negatively related to subsequent innovation implementation. We also tested organizational commitment as a mediator, but there was only partial support for the mediation. To test the generalizability of the findings, we replicated the study (Study 2, Germany: employees from various professions, N = 138, time lag 2 weeks). Again, work demands were positively, role ambiguity and professional compromise negatively related to subsequent innovation implementation. There was no support for strain as a mediator. Our results suggest differential effects of work demands and role stressors on innovation implementation, for which the underlying mechanism still needs to be uncovered...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} paper is to investigate the relationship between Transformational Leadership (TL) and <b>Innovative</b> <b>Working</b> <b>Behaviours</b> (IWB) by employees within Irish Technology Consulting Organisations (TCOs). To this end, the paper will examine the mediating influences on employee’s Creative Self-Efficacy (CSE) and the Organisation’s Climate for Innovation (OCI), in the TL and IWB causal relationship. Findings: The quantitative results indicated that TL {{did not have an}} associative relationship with IWB or employee CSE within the sample population. TL did have a significant positive relationship with OCI within the TCO context. Employee CSE was found to have the most significant relationship in promoting IWB. Further qualitative results indicated that the distributed leadership structure within TCOs reduces the positive influences of TL. Research Limitations and Implications: The research participants were from several different TCOs, each with their own and varying level of TL. The research methodology was limited to a cross-sectional study, supporting a time-specific result only. Future research should conduct a longitudinal quantitative analysis of the relationship between TL, CSE, OCI and IWB on a single TCO, to support a deeper understanding of how TCO leadership frameworks can leverage TL, and also to measure the transformative properties of TL on TCO employees over time. Practical Applications: By supporting an in-depth understanding of the associative relationship between leadership and IWB (in a knowledge-intensive services organisation) - this will allow TCOs to review their leadership and employee engagement frameworks to better promote innovative working behaviours, to maximise the potential for positive organisational outcomes. Originality and Value: To date, the main body of research on the relationship between TL and innovation has focused on product-centric and/or non-skilled services organisations. This research paper extends the relational research (between TL and IWB) into the growing knowledge-services and technology consulting sectors. The study expands on the existing research, by focusing on knowledge-services and consulting organisations subjects. The study brings academic and practitioner value by supporting {{a deeper understanding of the}} value of TL as a predictor positive of outcomes in ‘knowledge economy’ technology services organisations...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} a moderated mediation model of <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> <b>behaviour</b> enhancement. Perceived firm (organizational and market) performance was assumed to moderate the relationships between leader-member exchange (LMX) and organizational citizenship behaviour (OCB), on the one hand, and employability, on the other hand. In a preciously validated human resources management (HRM) model, employability appeared to be a full mediator in the relationship between LMX and OCB, and <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> <b>behaviour,</b> being the outcome measure. Design/methodology/approach – Data were collected from a sample of 487 pairs of employees and their immediate supervisors working in 151 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to confirm the factor structure of the baseline model variables, including LMX, OCB, employability, and <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> <b>behaviour.</b> The moderating effect of firm performance was tested using multi-group SEM. Findings – Results indicated that firm performance had a substantial influence on the baseline model’s relationships. More specifically, firm performance appeared to moderate partially a mediation model wherein LMX was assumed to be associated with <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> <b>behaviour,</b> through employability, being the mediator. Moreover, firm performance also appeared to moderate conclusively a model with employability as a mediator in the relationship between OCB and <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Originality/value – To the best of our knowledge, this is the very first study that investigates a mediation model of <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> <b>behaviour</b> enhancement moderated by firm performance. It appears that high- vs low-performance firms present very different organizational environments for an employee to work in. Obviously, these situational factors affect workers’ employability.

40|$|Affect is a {{hot topic}} in {{entrepreneurial}} research. However, extant literature is lagging behind in its use of affective theory and methodology, and furthermore, attention resides in isolated topics of inquiry, rendering the field stunted and disjointed. The purpose {{of this research is}} to adopt burgeoning affective theoretical perspectives to anticipate daily fluctuation in entrepreneurs’ innovative behaviour. The circumplex model of affect is utilised in this research to challenge the rhetoric that all spectrum of pleasant moods lead to beneficial work behaviour. Though multilevel modelling based on 3360 data points nested within 160 entrepreneurs (21 surveys per participant, completed over two weeks), support is found for the proposition that pleasant moods do not necessarily result in productive behaviour. Specifically, activation (the energising dimension of affect) has greater influence on propelling entrepreneurs’ innovative behaviour than valence (affect’s pleasant or unpleasant nature), such that high activation unpleasant and pleasant affect (worried, anxious, inspired, enthusiastic) predicts <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> <b>behaviour,</b> while low activation pleasant affect (calm, relaxed) does not. The affect-behaviour relationship is examined from several perspectives resulting in a feedback model between high activation moods and <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> <b>behaviour</b> engagement. Engagement in <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> <b>behaviour</b> positively correlated to entrepreneurs’ experience of high activation unpleasant affect, and negatively related to high and low activation pleasant affect. Thus although <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> <b>behaviour</b> benefits from high activation pleasant moods, engagement essentially decreases them. Affective dispositions correlated with daily affective experiences also, as such entrepreneurs with low levels of trait negative affect experienced more pleasant moods during the day and visa versa. Findings confirmed the hypothesis that the quality of previous night’s sleep both moderates the link between affect and <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> <b>behaviour,</b> plus predisposes entrepreneurs to pleasant or conversely unpleasant affective daily experiences – illustrating the importance of sleep in affective research. Additionally <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> <b>behaviour</b> was predicted via “the affective shift model”, which was adapted to include the influence of activation. The results further attest to the relevance of temporal dynamics of affect perspectives in entrepreneurial research. Specifically, the model demonstrated that <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> <b>behaviour</b> ensued when high activation unpleasant affect was followed by high activation pleasant affect, or simply with an increase in the level of high activation affect, of either valence between morning and afternoon. Empirical, theoretical, and practical implications of the findings are discussed...|$|E

40|$|Research {{has shown}} that <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> {{behavior}} of employees is important for competitive advantage of organizations. However, questions remain unanswered on how this <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> behavior is stimulated. This paper addresses the effect of human resource management on <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> behavior. Our concept of <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> behavior consists of four stages, {{taking into account the}} full innovation process. Prior research suggests that <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> behavior is found to be one-dimensional, even if it was theorized as multi-dimensional. This one-dimensionality makes its understanding more complex. Scoring high on <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> behavior says little about where the focus or strong points of employees in the innovation process lies. Disentangling <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> behavior in two phases makes it conceptually possible to find out how human resource management can stimulate two different types of behaviors, associated with either the creativity phase or the implementation phase. The {{purpose of this paper is}} therefore to take a closer look at how human resource management affects several stages within an <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> behavior as an innovation process. The results of the survey among 328 workers in a Dutch manufacturing company have shown that HR practices have an effect on three dimensions of <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> behavior (creativity, championing, and application) separately. The findings of our study support the overall argumentation and suggest that <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> behavior can be stimulated by certain HR practices, and by the absence of other HR practices...|$|R

40|$|This thesis aims to theorise {{and examine}} whether moods stimulate <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> <b>behaviour.</b> The latter {{comprises}} a construct denoting the generation, promotion and realisation of novel ideas, oriented to benefiting the effectiveness {{and well-being of}} an organisation. Over time, organisational behaviour scholars have described individual and contextual factors as relevant to understanding innovative behaviour. However, one topic that still requires more detailed attention is how affect is related to innovation. Several {{studies have found that}} moods are related to idea generation, but they have neglected to explore whether similar effects apply to idea promotion and idea realisation. Also, organisational behaviour research has been limited to moods differentiated by their valence (pleasure), even though psychological research has shown that moods necessarily involve both differences in valence and activation (energy). Furthermore, most theory of innovation assumes that affect mediates individual and contextual influences on innovative behaviour, but empirical research dealing with these issues is still rare. This thesis argues that the lack of research on idea promotion and realisation, in favour of idea generation, is a response to limited support for the multidimensionality of the <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> <b>behaviour</b> construct. In turn, the circumplex model of affect is adopted to define diverse moods described by valence and activation, whilst arguing influences of these moods on innovative behaviour. Moreover, from the perspective of cognitive appraisal theory, moods are argued to be a meditational function between climate of support for innovation, openness to experience and <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Five empirical studies supported the validity of <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> <b>behaviour</b> as a multidimensional construct. In turn, results supported a positive relationship between high-activated positive mood and dimensions of innovative behaviour. Finally, multilevel analysis showed high-activated positive mood as a core construct for transforming support for innovation and openness to experience into innovative behaviour...|$|E

Specifically, I investigated how the three basic psychological needs influence employees’ <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> behavior, taking cultural values measured {{at the individual level}} into consideration. The current study was conducted at two large Chinese medical equipment and supply companies using survey methodology. A sample of 284 employees was obtained from both R&D and functional departments.

In addition, my empirical research also provided evidence that autonomous motivation partially mediates the relationship between satisfaction of the three basic psychological needs and <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> behavior. In terms of the influences of individual cultural values, I found that power distance orientation negatively moderates the positive relationship between autonomous motivation and <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> behavior. More specifically, the indirect effects of satisfaction of the three basic psychological needs on <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> behavior through autonomous motivation are weakened when employees’ power distance orientation is high.

The previous findings on links between organizational climate and <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> behaviors are reported to be inconsistent with one another. Meanwhile, there are also critiques of the measurement of organizational climate and <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> behaviors are believed to be biased towards the Western culture. Hence, this study is timely to fill the existing research gap. 97 scientists were involved as respondents, comprising research officers, assistant research officers and research assistants who were working in seven public agencies in the agriculture sector. The findings reported that there is a significant relationship between organizational climate and <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> behaviors. This research has theoretical and practical implications. From the theoretical perspective, present research contributes a momentous proven theory to the existing body of knowledge in the field of predicting <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> behaviors...|$|R

First, this study {{contributes to}} the measurement of individual innovation by developing and empirically validating a multi-dimensional measure of <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Second and most important, the study aims to improve our understanding of the antecedents of individual innovation by investigating the impact of leadership. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{question}} {{of what constitutes a}} good job concerns employers, employees and policymakers alike. Given the multiple possible contingencies, this study applies a latent profile analysis (LPA) to employee data from the Belgian electricity sector to identify different job types based on the combinations of various job demands and resources. These job types are subsequently related to employee outcomes in terms of work engagement and <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> <b>behaviour,</b> for which threshold values are computed using relative operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The combination of both methods reveals that low-strain jobs with high resources and reasonable demands perform the best in terms of work engagement. For <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> <b>behaviour,</b> they perform equally well as active jobs which combine high demands with high resources. Employees in jobs with low resources and high demands (high-strain and very high-strain jobs) {{are less likely to be}} engaged and innovative. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Organisations must {{comprehend}} {{critical staff}} dynamics to harness employee’s potential and concretise customer satisfaction {{as a strategic}} imperative hegemony. As customer satisfaction, channelled through innovation, is pivotal to corporate performance, and employees are key resources underpinning innovation; prevailing correlations between these organisational forces could spawn significant managerial redirection. Research to determine the impact of consultant employee satisfaction (independent variable) on <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> <b>behaviour</b> (dependent variable) at the iDirect Contact Centre. The quantitative research evaluates the impact of one variable on another, and is causal comparative or ex-post facto by design. The research showed unequivocally that a strong direct relationship between employee satisfaction and <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> <b>behaviour</b> exists amongst front-line telephony consultants at the iDirect Contact Centre. This {{is supported by a}} high magnitude Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient of 0. 96, and simplistically interpolates to the apothegm that innovation at the iDirect Contact Centre will increase (rise) if employee satisfaction levels are elevated...|$|E
40|$|Building on role congruity theory, we {{predict that}} <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> {{behaviors}} are stereotypically ascribed to men {{more than to}} women. Because of this bias, women who innovate may not receive better performance evaluations {{than those who do}} not innovate, whereas engaging in <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> behaviors is beneficial for men. These predictions were supported across 3 complementary field and experimental studies. The results of an experiment (Study 1; N = 407) revealed that <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> behaviors are stereotypically associated with men more than women. In Studies 2 and 3, using multisource employee evaluation data (N = 153) and by experimentally manipulating <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> behaviors (N = 232), respectively, we found that favorable performance evaluations were associated with <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> behaviors for men but not for women. These studies highlight a previously unidentified form of sex bias and are particularly important for those wishing to increase innovative behaviors in the workplace: We need to address this phenomenon of “think innovation-think male. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the role of {{perceived}} fair interpersonal treatment, organization-based self-esteem, and some demographic characteristics in <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> behavior among employees of a Nigerian bank. Data were collected from a randomly selected sample of 185 employees through a structured questionnaire. Hierarchical multiple regression and One-Way Analysis of Variance were carried out to test hypotheses. The results reveal significant positive influence of perceived fair interpersonal treatment and organization-based self-esteem on <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> behavior. Lastly, the results show significant effect of level of education on <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> behavior. The findings suggest that perceived fair interpersonal treatment and organization-based self-esteem are important predictors of <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> behavior. Therefore, organizations should focus on improving the levels of organizational based self-esteem among employees who scored low on this trait by providing more recognition and importance. They should also strive to ensure fair interpersonal treatment among employees in order to promote motivation to engage in <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> behavior...|$|R
40|$|A current {{facilities}} management discourse seeks {{to discover how}} the built environment promotes or retards organisational change. However, whether or not significant change arises at all {{is yet to be}} definitively established. Hence, a contribution to the school of thought in this direction is considered important. This research investigated organisational performance relative to <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> settings. The aim {{of the study was to}} determine whether organisational performance and, hence, change are indeed brought about by <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> settings. A sample of 102 work settings was studied, and several null hypotheses on <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> settings and organisational performance were tested using the Kruskal-Wallis H test. Although subtle shifts were observed in the aspects of organisational performance that seem predicated on <b>innovative</b> <b>work</b> settings, to some extent the proposition that the physical properties and design of the workplace can influence organisational performance was validated...|$|R
