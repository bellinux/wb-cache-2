40|$|<b>Fronting</b> <b>of</b> {{the back}} vowels BOAT and BOOT is {{occurring}} across the U. S.

Thomas (2001, 2007) {{notes that in}} general, Whites tend to show more fronting than African Americans of these vowels, {{but this is not}} universally the case (Wolfram & Thomas, 2002; Anderson, 2008). The <b>fronting</b> <b>of</b> these back vowels has thus far proven to be an interesting area within the study of regional varieties of African American English, particularly in terms of ethnic, regional, and linguistic influences converging towards explanation (Fridland & Bartlett, 2006). Previous research in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania has shown that African Americans and Whites share some features of the local phonological system, but retain distinct ethnolinguistic boundaries for others (Eberhardt, 2008, 2009). The current paper uses data from sociolinguistic interviews conducted with African Americans (born 1926 - 1993) to examine {{the extent to which the}} <b>fronting</b> <b>of</b> BOAT and BOOT is found across ethnic lines in the city. Preliminary results indicate that <b>fronting</b> <b>of</b> BOAT parallels the local dominant dialect, particularly among younger women, but the (more recent) <b>fronting</b> <b>of</b> BOOT is less advanced.
