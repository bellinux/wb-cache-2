5|$|Despite the {{disparity}} with the Principate, Jones and Elton argue that 4th-century remuneration was attractive {{compared to the}} hard reality of existence at subsistence level that most recruits' peasant <b>families</b> <b>had</b> to endure. Against {{that has to be}} set the clear unpopularity of military service.|$|E
5|$|In 1900, {{only one}} in five American <b>families</b> <b>had</b> a Christmas tree. While America never lacked for real trees, the time and expense of {{retrieving}} them from the wild was significant. Early in the twentieth century, however, Christmas tree farms began supplying large metropolitan areas with real trees. In the 1920s, real trees became commonplace, supplanting artificial trees in American homes.|$|E
5|$|In March 2009, it was {{announced}} that Jim Knight, Minister of State for Schools and <b>Families,</b> <b>had</b> approved plans that would mean the closure of both Ladymead Community School and the nearby St Augustine of Canterbury RC/CoE School both in the Priorswood area of Taunton. The schools closed in August 2010, and were replaced in September 2010 by The Taunton Academy.|$|E
50|$|The {{number of}} caporegimes/crews {{depends on the}} size of a family. The Gambino crime <b>family</b> <b>has</b> had more than 20 capos whereas the St. Louis crime <b>family</b> <b>has</b> had fewer.|$|R
25|$|During the 1980s and 90s, the Gambino crime <b>family</b> <b>had</b> 24 active crews {{operating}} in New York City, New Jersey, Long Island, South Florida, and Connecticut. By 2000, the <b>family</b> <b>had</b> approximately 20 crews. However, {{according to a}} 2004 New Jersey Organized Crime Report, the Gambino <b>family</b> <b>had</b> only ten active crews.|$|R
50|$|The Petre <b>family</b> <b>have</b> been staunchly {{loyal to}} Roman Catholicism. It {{was the first}} Baron who {{publicly}} acknowledged his Catholicism. At least twelve members of the <b>family</b> <b>have</b> been Jesuits. The <b>family</b> <b>has</b> also produced two bishops, Francis (1692-1775) and Benjamin (1672-1758). These two were coadjutor bishops of, respectively, Bishop Dicconson and Bishop Challoner.|$|R
5|$|Litoral Gas {{proposed}} an out-of-court settlement to {{the relatives of}} the victims, offering about 1200 US dollars per square meter of collapsed building, in addition to compensation for loss of life. Vice Governor Jorge Henn rejected it as immoral, {{and most of the}} families also initially rejected the proposal. By May 2014, however, almost half of the <b>families</b> <b>had</b> accepted the settlement.|$|E
5|$|Not {{unlike other}} {{countries}} during {{the evolution of}} their economies, Architecture became a tool for and manifestation of social policy, with architects and politicians determining just what features were adequate for the intended residents of housing projects. As late as in 1922, there were many who felt that working-class <b>families</b> <b>had</b> no need for their own bath; apartments and small houses only included a small kitchen {{and one or two}} rooms.|$|E
5|$|Of the 22 {{families}} on Second Street, the two Sandoval <b>families</b> <b>had</b> {{a total of}} thirteen men {{who served in the}} armed forces. Three died in service during World War II. The Sandovals were two families of Mexican immigrants, with the same surname and lived on Second Street.|$|E
50|$|The Ulefoss-line of the <b>family</b> <b>has,</b> however, dropped Fortune {{and uses}} the two horns only. The various lines of the <b>family</b> <b>have</b> {{different}} heraldic colours (tinctures) in the arms.|$|R
50|$|Since 1874, two <b>families</b> <b>have</b> been {{involved}} with the Record. The Hoch family owned it for 124 years. The Meyer <b>family</b> <b>has</b> {{been involved}} for more than 60 years.|$|R
50|$|His father's {{side of the}} <b>family</b> <b>has</b> been {{traced back}} to France. His mother's side of the <b>family</b> <b>has</b> been traced to the island of Saint-Domingue (modern Haiti); in the Caribbean.|$|R
5|$|Once a non-Vedar {{married into}} a Vedar family, {{he or she}} was assimilated as part of the Vedar village. Almost all Vedar <b>families</b> <b>had</b> an {{ancestor}} who was Tamil or a family member who was married to a Tamil from a neighboring village.|$|E
5|$|The Hancock and Hoxworth <b>families</b> <b>had</b> {{lived in}} Montgomery County for several generations, and were of English, Scottish and Welsh descent. Benjamin Hancock was a schoolteacher when his sons were born. A {{few years after}} their birth, he moved the family to Norristown, the county seat, and began to {{practice}} law. Benjamin was also a deacon in the Baptist church and participated in municipal government (as an avowed Democrat).|$|E
5|$|All <b>families</b> <b>had</b> {{their own}} gardens {{in which they}} grew {{vegetables}} that lasted through the winter. Some raised cows, pigs and chickens; others had horses for carrying firewood. There was little refrigeration, and perishables were difficult to keep. Before the mercantile came to Elcor, residents went to the J. P. Ahlin store in McKinley, or to the Saari, Campbell and Kraker Mercantile in Gilbert. Deliveries were made daily, with orders taken for the following day. People bought on credit and paid monthly, on paydays.|$|E
50|$|Steve Gluzband {{was born}} in Roxbury, Massachusetts to Frank and Rita Gluzband. His father’s <b>family</b> <b>had</b> emigrated from Havana, Cuba whereas his mother’s <b>family</b> <b>had</b> been in Boston since the 1880s.|$|R
500|$|The nuclear <b>family</b> <b>has</b> been {{considered}} the [...] "traditional" [...] family since the communist scare {{in the cold}} war of the 1950s. The nuclear family consists of a mother, father, and the children. The two-parent nuclear <b>family</b> <b>has</b> become less prevalent, and pre-American and European <b>family</b> forms <b>have</b> become more common.|$|R
50|$|The {{district}} {{is sometimes called}} Stauferkreis, because the Staufen <b>family</b> <b>had</b> their roots in this area. However, when that <b>family</b> <b>had</b> no heir anymore, the land became part of Württemberg in the 14th century.|$|R
5|$|Although Christine had {{weakened}} to {{a tropical}} depression {{by the time}} it passed through the Leeward Islands, heavy rains from the storm, peaking at , caused flooding in Puerto Rico. Over 600 homes were flooded and dozens of <b>families</b> <b>had</b> to be evacuated from several towns. One person died from electrocution after stepping on a downed wire on a flooded street. Minor damage was recorded in the Virgin Islands, mainly downed power lines which left roughly 500 people without telephone service.|$|E
5|$|Around 1844, {{she married}} a free black man named John Tubman. Although {{little is known about}} him or their time together, the union was {{complicated}} because of her slave status. Since the mother's status dictated that of children, any children born to Harriet and John would be enslaved. Such blended marriages – free people of color marrying enslaved people – were not uncommon on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, where by this time, half the black population was free. Most African-American <b>families</b> <b>had</b> both free and enslaved members. Larson suggests that they might have planned to buy Tubman's freedom.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 29, Michael Johnson {{was engaged}} to be married to a local woman, Mary Neild, but she {{cancelled}} the engagement. Twenty years later, in 1706, he married Sarah Ford. She came from a middle-class milling and farming family and was twelve years his junior, daughter of Cornelius Ford. Although both <b>families</b> <b>had</b> money, Samuel Johnson often claimed that he grew up in poverty. It is uncertain what happened between the marriage of his parents and Samuel's birth three years later to provoke a decline in the family's fortunes, but Michael Johnson quickly became overwhelmed with debt from which he was never able to recover.|$|E
25|$|Lower class <b>families</b> <b>have</b> {{been heavily}} {{influenced}} by income as well. Lower-class <b>families</b> <b>have</b> {{a different set of}} work–family balancing issues, many of which are much more difficult to solve than those of middle-class families.|$|R
50|$|After Bronner's death, his <b>family</b> <b>has</b> {{continued}} {{to run the}} business. His grandson David Bronner is currently CEO. The <b>family</b> <b>has</b> said the labels he wrote will not change except when required by government regulations.|$|R

5|$|Before the {{deployment}} there was controversy about the government's non-resolution of repatriation entitlements and peacekeeper coverage under the Veterans' Entitlements Act, {{and it had}} not decided if {{the deployment}} would be considered operational service. The pay and allowance issues were resolved; many other conditions-of-service issues were identified, but not resolved. During the deployment few issues were brought to Parliament's attention, although the issue of mail censorship was raised. During the second contingent's rotation, the soldiers' <b>families</b> <b>had</b> a full-time welfare officer tasked with supporting them.|$|E
5|$|By 1990, 52,000 black <b>families</b> <b>had</b> {{been settled}} on 6.5 million acres. This was {{insufficient}} {{to deal with}} the country's overcrowding problem, which was being exacerbated by the growth in the black population. That year, Zimbabwe's parliament passed an amendment allowing the government to expropriate land at a fixed price while denying land-owners the right of appeal to the courts. The government hoped that by doing so it could settle 110,000 black families on 13 million acres, which would require the expropriation of approximately half of all white-owned land. Zimbabwe's Commercial Farmers Union argued that the proposed measures would wreck the country's economy, urging the government to instead settle landless blacks on the half-a-million acres of land that was either unproductive or state-owned.|$|E
5|$|By 2000 the {{percentage}} of nuclear <b>families</b> <b>had</b> decreased by 40%, {{while the number of}} other family types had increased by 51%. The percentage of single households has also steadily increased. In 1970, only 17% of households consisted of singles. In 2000 that figure had increased by 50% with singles constituting 25.5% of households. The most drastic increase was among {{the percentage}} of households made up of single males, which nearly doubled from 5.6% in 1970 to 10.7% in 2000.|$|E
50|$|Wang Subak, {{the eldest}} {{daughter}} of the Wang <b>family,</b> <b>had</b> married into a wealthy family, but after her husband Go Minjung goes bankrupt, she and her <b>family</b> <b>have</b> to move back into her parents' home.|$|R

5|$|Floyd's {{rainfall}} {{resulted in}} deadly and extensive flooding that killed {{two people in}} New York. Heavy flooding was reported along numerous creeks, including the Esopus, Catskill, and Schoharie. In the Albany area, the Normanskill rose to extremely high levels, and the resultant flood waters damaged nearby buildings. The Coeymans Creek in Selkirk overflowed and forced 20 families to leave their homes. The main rivers typically remained within their banks. Many roads, including U.S. Route 20 in Guilderland, were flooded or washed out, and seven <b>families</b> <b>had</b> to be evacuated along NY 32 in Menands. Further south, the Saw Mill and Bronx rivers both overflowed, and caused urban flooding. A dam on a mill pond broke near Lake Placid, leading to flooding along the Chubb River.|$|E
5|$|Historical {{large-scale}} immigration was {{facilitated by}} the introduction of steamships (from 1823). By 1840, up to 5,000 English people, mostly half-pay officers and their <b>families,</b> <b>had</b> settled in Jersey. In the aftermath of 1848, Polish, Russian, Hungarian, Italian and French political refugees came to Jersey. Following Louis Napoléon's coup of 1851, more French proscrits arrived. By the end of the 19th century, well-to-do British families, attracted by the lack of income tax, were settling in Jersey in increasing numbers, establishing St Helier as a predominantly English-speaking town.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Warren and David Himmelstein {{published}} {{a study on}} bankruptcy and medical bills, which found that half of all families filing for bankruptcy did so {{in the aftermath of}} a serious medical problem. They say that three-quarters of such <b>families</b> <b>had</b> medical insurance. This study was widely cited in policy debates, although some have challenged the study's methods and offered alternative interpretations of the data, suggesting that only seventeen percent of bankruptcies are directly attributable to medical expenses.|$|E

50|$|While Justus was {{studying}} in Boston, he met Miss Fannie Bishop Capen, {{who had been}} born in Stoughton, Massachusetts in 1852. Her father's <b>family</b> <b>had</b> roots in Holland and France, and her mother's <b>family</b> <b>had</b> early New England roots. His <b>family</b> <b>had</b> been in New York for five generations before his parents moved to Wisconsin. She was working as a matron in an orphans home. They married on April 13, 1880 in Stoughton, Massachusetts.|$|R
50|$|If a <b>family</b> <b>has</b> a {{positive}} net worth then it has more wealth than the combined net worth of over 30.6 million American families. This is because the bottom 25% of American <b>families</b> <b>have</b> a negative combined net worth.|$|R
