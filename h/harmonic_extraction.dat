40|$|An {{enhanced}} <b>harmonics</b> <b>extraction</b> algorithm {{based on}} Instantaneous Power (PQ) Theory is proposed for indirect current controlled (ICC) three-level neutral point diode clamped (NPC) inverter-based shunt active power filter (SAPF). SAPF is famous in current harmonics mitigation for its flexibility {{in dealing with}} dynamic state conditions. As for its controller, PQ Theory has served the major role in <b>harmonics</b> <b>extraction</b> algorithm due to its simple implementation features. However, it suffers from serious time delay due to its dependency on sluggish numerical filters. Furthermore, the algorithm is mostly designed to suit the operation of direct current controlled (DCC) SAPF which requires the knowledge of actual SAPF current (injection current). This leads to inaccurate mitigation as the injection current does not possess the exact information on actual source current which suffers from switching ripples problems. Therefore, two major modifications are introduced involving the development of mathematical average algorithm to replace numerical filter for fundamental real power computation {{and the formation of}} mathematical current relationship to change DCC to ICC based operation.

40|$|In this work, phase-based {{methods for}} {{emerging}} applications implemented with advanced CMOS technology are proposed. We use phase-based methods {{to solve problems}} in high- speed chip-chip/chip-memory data link interconnect, and in terahertz system. With increasing demand for bandwidth between chip-chip and chip-memory communication, high-speed data link interconnect becomes a key block in modern computer systems. In or- der to serve portable devices, energy efficiency is a critical metric for data link interconnect. Multiband RF Interconnect, which transmits data by upconverts data streams into multiple frequency bands, can fully exploit the bandwidth of interconnect wire with excellent energy efficiency. In order to demodulate data stream, a correct carrier phase in receiver end is necessary. The conventional way for carrier phase synchronization requires high-speed, high- resolution analog-to-digital converter, which consumes large amount of power and silicon area. In the proposed phase-based method, a pilot signal is sent by transmit side, and in receiver end a simple comparator is sufficient to identify correct phase. This greatly enhances energy efficiency of data link and reduces cost. In addition, optimal demodulation phase for dispersive channel is derived. The other proposed application for phase-based method is terahertz systems. CMOS tera- hertz source suffer from low device cut-off frequency, and fundamental frequency is limited. Conventional time-domain <b>harmonic</b> <b>extraction</b> can selectively enhance certain harmonic of fundamental tone at output radiation and suppress other harmonics, and therefore increase effective radiation frequency. In terahertz band, time-domain <b>harmonic</b> <b>extraction</b> cannot achieve sufficient low-order harmonic suppression.

40|$|We present {{methods for}} {{automatic}} speaker identification in noisy environments. To improve noise robustness of speaker identification, we developed two methods, the <b>harmonic</b> structure <b>extraction</b> method and the reliable frame weighting method. The <b>harmonic</b> structure <b>extraction</b> method enables {{the speaker of}} input speech signals to be identified after environmental noise has been reduced. This method first extracts harmonic components of the speech from the sound mixtures and then resynthesizes a clean speech signal by using a sinusoidal model driven by harmonic components. The reliable frame weighting method then determines how each frame of the resynthesized speech is reliable (i. e. little influenced by environmental noises) by using two Gaussian mixture models for the speech and noise. The speaker can be robustly identified by attaching importance to reliable frames. Experimental results with thirty speakers showed that our method was able to reduce the influences of environmental noise and achieved an error rate of 10. 7 %, while the error rate for a conventional method was 18. 9 %.
