This has happened because of the advent of television. Burrakatha is a long-format art form. The point we are making is that if we don't protect these folk arts, they will be on their way out.|$|E

Human Rights First, Human Rights Watch and nineteen members of the United States Congress called for Rajab's release. Four Bahraini rights group issued a joint statement condemning the sentence and five political parties held a sit-in in solidarity with Rajab. Yousif al-Mahafdha of BCHR said [...] "hey arrested him {{to send a message}} to all activists that you will get arrested like him <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> the media".|$|E

500|$|Leto {{personally}} {{interviewed the}} band's fans, termed as the Echelon, who shared {{stories about the}} importance of music in their lives, some personal struggles and their own dreams. In an interview with MTV News, the frontman explained that he was inspired by the will to document the personal changes experienced by the band and its audience. [...] "Most of the interviews", Leto explained, [...] "I did myself, so they're really intimate. It's me, it's them, and it's the camera. What I've found is, that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> everybody long enough, you find an incredible story. Every single person has a moment in their life, something that they've found a solution for, a story to tell. Some are funny, some are really intriguing, and if you ask the right questions, you get interesting answers." ...|$|E

Pianist Ethan Iverson, a contemporary of Mehldau's, stated that Mehldau was the principal influence on his peers, {{beginning in the late}} 1990s. Pianist Gerald Clayton (born 1984) summarized Mehldau's importance in a 2013 interview: [...] "He brought in a new feel and sound in jazz. I don't know a single modern pianist who hasn't taken something from Brad. I told him that I should be arrested for all the stuff I've stolen from him." [...] Redman said in 2010 that Largo had been particularly important to musicians: [...] "Brad has had a lot of influential records, [...] <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> musicians, especially younger musicians, so many of them will name that as a defining record." [...] Marco Benevento and Aaron Parks are among the improvisers who have been affected by the 2002 album.|$|E

6000|$|... "Why don't {{you come}} in?" [...] the latter asked. [...] "Mrs. Weber--that's {{the name of}} the lady who owns the house--is mighty nice, even <b>if</b> <b>you</b> can't <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll tell <b>you</b> what, Staveley, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> can <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me seriously {{for five}} minutes, I shall {{be obliged to}} <b>you.</b> <b>If</b> that is {{impossible}} to you, say so, and I will drop the matter." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I had {{rather not}} hear, Sydney; and I desire {{you will not}} repeat them to any one. Be careful, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> Jock to-night. To repeat words spoken in her present mood might do {{exceeding}} mischief." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, I think he'll {{pull through}} all right," [...] said the doctor. [...] "But as I have told your uncle and your aunt, {{he must be}} kept quiet. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> {{business}} <b>to</b> him, or excite him in any way, it is bound to make matters worse." ...|$|R
6000|$|Halleck set {{his lips}} and shook his head, with a mocking smile. [...] "I'm {{surprised}} at you, Atherton, with your knowledge of human nature. I've come to stay; you must know that. You must know that I had gone through everything before I gave up, and that I haven't the strength to begin the struggle over again. I tell you I'm beaten, and I'm glad of it; for there is rest in it. You would waste your breath, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> me in the old way; there's nothing in me to appeal to, any more.

6000|$|... "I don't {{think that}} Jantje likes you, Meinheer Muller," [...] said Bessie, spitefully, [...] "and I do not wonder at it <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him like that.

6000|$|Clementina did not relent so easily. [...] "Mrs. Landa, whateva you do I don't ca'e to know it; and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> {{me again}} about this I shall go home.

6000|$|... "Well," [...] he retorted, [...] "what do you expect, Percy, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> {{them like}} that?

6000|$|... "Come, come, Mr. Arabin, don't let love {{interfere}} with your appetite. It never does with mine. Give me half a glass more champagne {{and then go}} to the table. Mrs. Bold will do me an injury <b>if</b> <b>you</b> stay <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> me any longer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he {{said after}} a while, [...] "I'm sure I'm very much obliged to you for the manner in which you have taken what I said to you. Nobody knows about it yet, I suppose; and perhaps, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> the governor--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>you</b> might <b>talk</b> with her, Miss Trotter," [...] he said, now {{completely}} subdued.

6000|$|... 'Exactly,' {{returned}} Jonas; 'if anything can. Now, supposing I did it here, I {{should do}} it cheap, I know, and easy, without bothering her about it; which I'd much rather not do, for it's just in a woman's way to take it into her head, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her about such things, that she's going to die directly.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No; I am sure we {{had better}} not," [...] George said. [...] "I should toss and fidget about there horridly. The best thing will be for us to sit here, and then we shall be all together. And <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> us, and perhaps read to us, we shan't feel it half so much. What {{are you going to}} do, mother?" [...] he asked five minutes afterwards, as Mrs. Andrews came down with her bonnet on.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps I did," [...] he said. [...] "You see I'm not {{a fashionable}} young spark like you. Why the devil don't {{you go and}} call on her? It's only a civil thing to do. You are {{supposed}} to be one of her uncle's greatest friends, and he's supposed to be dangerously ill. Go and call on her this afternoon. Put on your best clothes and your Paris manners. You {{ought to be able to}} get something out of a child from the backwoods. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her cleverly you can at least find out whether Phineas is playing the game or not." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Won't {{you wait}} till your mother comes, or {{put it off}} till tomorrow?' said Mrs. Pettifer, alarmed. 'You'll hardly be back in time for dinner, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> get <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> Mrs. Crewe.

6000|$|... "Exactly. The {{village was}} a little startled. The cottager who had let the rooms came to me privately. Teddy is rather touchy {{on the point of}} his {{personal}} independence, he considers any demand for explanations as an insult, and probably all he had said to the old lady was, 'This is Letty--come to share my rooms.' I put the matter to him very gently. 'Oh, yes,' he said, rather in the manner of some one who has overlooked a trifle. 'I got married to her in the Christmas holidays. May I bring her along to see Mrs. Britling?' We induced him to go into a little cottage I rent. The wife was the daughter of a Colchester journalist and printer. I don't know <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> her." ...|$|R

He wants to see you because he doesnt know how bad he is. We'll allow you to wait a few minutes to humor him; but <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him, out you go.

6000|$|... "Now, William Brisket," [...] she said, [...] "just {{listen to}} me. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me again about seeing your way, {{you may go}} and see it by yourself. I'm not so badly off that I'm going to have myself twitted at in that way. If you don't like me, {{you can do the}} other thing. And this I will say, when a gentleman has spoken his mind free to a lady, and a lady has given her answer free back to him, it's a very mean thing for a gentleman to be saying so much about money after that. Of course, a girl has got herself to look to; and if I take up with you, why, of course, I have to say, 'Stand off,' to any other young man as may wish to keep me company. Now, there's one as shall be nameless that wouldn't demean himself to say a word about money." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Seventy pounds! <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me {{any more}} of seventy pounds, I will fly at your face." [...] As she spoke this she jumped across at him {{as though she were}} really on the point of attacking him with her nails, and he, in dismay, retreated to the door. [...] "You, and your seventy pounds! Oh, you English! What mean mens you are! Oh! a Frenchman would despise to do it. Yes; or a Russian or a Pole. But you--you want it all down in black and white like a butcher's heel. You know nothing, and {{understand}} nothing, and can never speak, and can never hold your tongues. You have no head, but the head of a bull. A bull can break all the china in a shop--dash, smash, crash--all the pretty things gone in a minute! So can an Englishman. Your seventy pounds! You will come again to me for seventy pounds, I think." [...] In her energy she had acted the bull, and had exhibited her idea of the dashing, the smashing and the crashing, by the motion of her head and the waving of her hands.|$|E

60|$|Mr Pickering was convinced. His spirits soared. Marriage! What was marriage? Slavery, {{not to be}} endured by {{your man}} of spirit. Look at all the unhappy marriages you saw everywhere. Besides, you had only to recall some of the novels and plays of recent years {{to get the right}} angle on marriage. According to the novelists and playwrights, shrewd fellows who knew what was what, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> your wife about your {{business}} she said you had no soul; <b>if</b> <b>you</b> didn't, she said you didn't think enough of her to let her share your life. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> gave her expensive presents and an unlimited credit account, she complained that you looked on her as a mere doll; and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> didn't, she called you a screw. That was marriage. If it didn't get you with the left jab, it landed on you with the right upper-cut. None of that sort of thing for Dudley Pickering.|$|R
