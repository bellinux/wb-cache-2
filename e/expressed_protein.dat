A total of 1528 protein groups were identified, among which 1159 protein groups were quantified and 249 protein groups were observed as differentially <b>expressed</b> <b>proteins</b> (86 proteins up-regulated and 163 down-regulated).

40|$|Wheat {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} crops in the world, and osmotic stress has become one of the main factors affecting wheat production. Understanding the mechanism of the response of wheat to osmotic stress would be greatly significant. In the present study, isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) was used to analyze the changes of protein expression in the wheat roots exposed to different osmotic stresses. A total of 2, 228 <b>expressed</b> <b>proteins,</b> including 81 differentially <b>expressed</b> <b>proteins,</b> between osmotic stress and control, were found. The comprehensive analysis of these differentially <b>expressed</b> <b>proteins</b> revealed that osmotic stress increased the variety of <b>expressed</b> <b>proteins</b> and suppressed the quantity of <b>expressed</b> <b>proteins</b> in wheat roots. Furthermore, the proteins for detoxifying and reactive oxygen species scavenging, especially the glutathione system, played important roles in maintaining organism balance in response to osmotic stress in wheat roots. Thus, the present study comprehensively describes the protein expression changes in wheat roots in response to osmotic stress, providing firmer foundation to further study the mechanism of osmotic resistance in wheat...|$|R

Some of these tags may also allow for increased solubility of the target protein. The target protein is fused to the protein tag, but a protease cleavage site positioned in the polypeptide linker region between the protein and the tag allows the tag to be removed later.|$|E
25|$|The {{activity}} of DBT on PER is {{aided by the}} {{activity of}} the proteins CKII and SGG, and it is antagonized by a rhythmically <b>expressed</b> <b>protein</b> phosphatase. It is possible, but currently unknown, if DBT regulates other functions of PER or of other circadian proteins. There has been no evidence that suggests that DBT binds directly to TIM. Rather, the only kinase known to directly phosphorylate TIM is the SHAGGY (SGG) kinase protein, but this does not majorly affect TIM stability, suggesting the presence of a different kinase or phosphatase. DBT does play a role in recruiting other kinases into PER repression complexes. These kinases phosphorylate the transcription factor CLK, which releases the CLK-CYC complex from the E-Box and represses transcription.|$|E

While high throughput DNA microarrays lack the quantitative accuracy of qPCR, it takes {{about the same time}} to measure the gene expression of a few dozen genes via qPCR as it would to measure an entire genome using DNA microarrays. So it often makes sense to perform semi-quantitative DNA microarray analysis experiments to identify candidate genes, then perform qPCR on some of the most interesting candidate genes to validate the microarray results. Other experiments, such as a Western blot of some of the protein products of differentially expressed genes, make conclusions based on the expression profile more persuasive, since the mRNA levels do not necessarily correlate to the amount of <b>expressed</b> <b>protein.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The protein {{ubiquitin}} is a universal, [...] "" [...] <b>expressed</b> <b>protein</b> {{common to}} eukaryotic organisms. Ubiquitin {{plays a role}} in the regulation of other proteins by tagging them for eventual degradation by proteasomes. This process begins when ubiquitin ligase covalently attaches a ubiquitin molecule to the lysine side chain of the target protein substrate (the misfolded, damaged, malfunctioning or unneeded protein that needs to be degraded). This is repeated a number of times in succession forming a chain of ubiquitin molecules, which is a process referred to as polyubiquitination. The polyubiquitination of the target protein signals the proteasome to break it down, which it does via proteolysis. The ubiquitin-proteasome system plays {{a crucial role in the}} non-lysosomal degradation of intracellular proteins, and ubiquitin can also participate in modifying proteins to perform certain tasks. Both degradation and modification of proteins within the cell are part of a broader regulatory scheme, necessary for cellular processes such as cell division, cell signalling, cell surface receptor function, apoptosis, DNA maintenance, inflammatory response and [...] developmental quality control associated with the cell cycle and homeostasis in general.|$|E
