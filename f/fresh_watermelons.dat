5000|$|In a {{contemporary}} review, Robert Christgau deemed the recordings on Circle in the Round [...] "damaged goods", even though [...] "Miles tastes better {{out of the}} can than <b>fresh</b> <b>watermelon</b> or even V.S.O.P." [...] Lester Bangs voted {{it as one of}} 1979's ten best records in his ballot for The Village Voices annual Pazz & Jop poll. [...] "Although seemingly hodgepodge in arrangement, Circle in the Round is a brilliant examination of the depth of scope and range possessed by Miles Davis", Lindsay Planer later wrote in AllMusic.|$|R
5000|$|A visiting Catholic priest {{found the}} resort “like all watering-places,” largely “patronized {{by those in}} quest of {{pleasure}} or matrimonial alliances.” [...] A reporter in 1854 noted “the whole house busy” with “five or six tables of whist parties below the piazzas, two or three card tables employed in the drawing room, two pianos accompanied by sweet voices, one billiard table, at which the balls were constantly cracking, a nine-pin alley, and a great many outsiders and lookers on busily engaged in smoking their cigars. Some were walking to the spring, and at the spring house some were pitching quoits for exercise after drinking the sulphur and chalybeate water.” The reporter further noted the dissection of a <b>fresh</b> <b>watermelon</b> and evening dances that often lasted until midnight.|$|R

30|$|Pyrolysis {{processes}} {{leading to}} the carbonization of precursors under high temperature have been widely reported for the preparation of CDs. Generally, the CD precursor undergoes several processes, including dehydration, polymerization, carbonization, and subsequent formation of CDs. Niu et al. [44] reported the simple one-step thermal conversion of l-glutamic acid into fluorescent CDs. In a typical reaction, the precursors were heated to 200  °C using a heating mantle for 5  min. The precursors were liquefied {{and the color of}} the solution changed from clear to brown, indicating the formation of CDs. Chandra et al. [45] developed a solid-phase pyrolysis route to prepare nitrogen and phosphorus co-doped CDs. Citric acid (the carbon source) was ground with diammonium hydrogen phosphate (nitrogen and phosphate source) at a molar ratio of 1 : 4 (citric acid/diammonium hydrogen phosphate). The ground salts were then placed in a silica crucible and heated at 180  °C for 1  h in an oven. Subsequently, the carbonized precursors were dissolved with deionized water and purified for use in Fe 3 + ion sensing. Green precursors, such as watermelon peel, have also been used to synthesize CDs in a similar manner. Briefly, <b>fresh</b> <b>watermelon</b> peels were subjected to heat treatment at 220  °C for 2  h in air for the carbonization process. The obtained product was dispersed in water and sonicated for 30  min before purification via filtration and dialysis. The as-synthesized CDs exhibited excellent water solubility and emitted blue PL with a QY of 7.1 %.|$|R

Production Regions The largest amount of watermelon acreage, slightly less than 1, 000 acres in 2002, is located in Southampton County. Other watermelon-producing areas include the Eastern Shore, Northern Neck, and Richmond/Hanover County. Each of these areas accounts for a few hundred acres annually. Cultural Practices Both seeded and seedless varieties are recommended for growth in Virginia. Variety selection depends on several factors such as market acceptability, yield, and horticultural characteristics. Standard seeded varieties recommended i...|$|R
40|$|Total farm-gate {{receipts}} {{for major}} vegetable crops {{grown in the}} United States were about $ 10. 4 billion in 2008. Florida-grown <b>fresh</b> vegetables and <b>watermelons</b> provide significant revenues {{to the state and}} were valued at $ 1. 55 billion that year, a 6 % increase over 2007 and ranking our state second in the country (USDA/NASS, 2009).

Organic fruits and vegetables accounted for 39 % of this amount, or $ 5. 4 billion. The leading organic fruits and vegetables in the U. S. are: tomato, carrot, peach, squash, leafy vegetables, apple, potato and banana. Prices for organically grown produce were higher than those for conventionally grown produce. For example, in 2003, the wholesale price for organic carrot was 153 % higher tha...|$|R
