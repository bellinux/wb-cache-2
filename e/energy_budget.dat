5|$|There {{are several}} causes {{of an urban}} heat island (UHI); for example, dark {{surfaces}} absorb significantly more solar radiation, which causes urban concentrations of roads and buildings to heat more than suburban and rural areas during the day; materials commonly used in urban areas for pavement and roofs, such as concrete and asphalt, have significantly different thermal bulk properties (including heat capacity and thermal conductivity) and surface radiative properties (albedo and emissivity) than the surrounding rural areas. This causes {{a change in the}} <b>energy</b> <b>budget</b> of the urban area, often leading to higher temperatures than surrounding rural areas. Another major reason is the lack of evapotranspiration (for example, through lack of vegetation) in urban areas. With a decreased amount of vegetation, cities also lose the shade and cooling effect of trees, and the removal of carbon dioxide.|$|E

25|$|The {{ocean and}} {{atmosphere}} {{can work together}} to spontaneously generate internal climate variability that can persist for years to decades at a time. Examples {{of this type of}} variability include the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, the Pacific decadal oscillation, and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation. These variations can affect global average surface temperature by redistributing heat between the deep ocean and the atmopshere and/or by altering the cloud/water vapor/sea ice distribution which can affect the total <b>energy</b> <b>budget</b> of the earth.|$|E

China accounted for 32.6% of that (increasingly from coal as part of urea synthesis), followed by Russia at 8.1%, India at 7.6%, and the United States at 6.4%. About 88% of the ammonia produced was used for fertilizing agricultural crops.|$|E
40|$|Herbivores of {{different}} body size vary in food selection {{because of their}} different metabolic requirements and abilities to harvest and digest food. Compared with smaller grazers, larger ones require higher food quantity but can tolerate poorer quality.

By estimating daily energy expenditure (based on observed activity <b>budgets)</b> and <b>energy</b> intake (using the indigestible marker method in food and faeces), we compared the field <b>energy</b> <b>budgets</b> of three wintering herbivorous goose species differing in body size feeding on the same Carex meadows.

40|$|Migratory {{fish are}} known to {{seasonally}} enter coastal stream systems but {{the magnitude of the}} effects these migrations have on stream <b>energy</b> <b>budgets</b> is not fully understood. The Laurentian Great Lakes have several introduced and native adfluvial fish, where only a few studies have investigated the impacts of their migration on <b>energy</b> <b>budgets</b> in Michigan coastal streams. We quantified the contribution of energy from Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) muscle and eggs, steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) eggs, and larval white suckers (Catostomus commersonii) to coastal stream <b>energy</b> <b>budgets.</b> <b>Energy</b> densities and energy delivered to streams were estimated using bomb calorimetry and annual return data from the Little Manistee River Weir and other recent studies. In addition, we compared the energy contribution of these adfluvial fish tissues and aquatic insects to resident stream fish diets in two rivers in western Michigan. Specifically, we examined the energy contribution of Chinook eggs to steelhead parr diets in Bigelow Creek, MI and the contribution of energy by larval white suckers to brown trout (Salmo trutta) and non-migratory rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) diets in the Big Manistee River, MI. Our measured energy density values differed markedly from values typically used in the literature, and indicate that some invertebrate groups (Trichoptera) have energy densities that do not significantly differ from salmon eggs which are typically perceived to be energy dense. Our results suggest that steelhead parr in Bigelow Creek consume more energy during the fall when salmon eggs are present. In contrast, large numbers of drifting larval white suckers in the Big Manistee River does not result in an increase in energy intake for trout during spring, but may satisfy base energy needs. Our results suggest that adfluvial fish are an important component of energy transfer between systems and contribute substantial energy to coastal stream <b>energy</b> <b>budgets</b> in Michigan...|$|R
25|$|Ocean {{currents}} greatly affect Earth's climate by transferring {{heat from}} the tropics to the polar regions. Transferring warm or cold air and precipitation to coastal regions, winds may carry them inland. Surface heat and freshwater fluxes create global density gradients that drive the thermohaline circulation part of large-scale ocean circulation. It {{plays an important role}} in supplying heat to the polar regions, and thus in sea ice regulation. Changes in the thermohaline circulation are thought to have significant impacts on Earth's <b>energy</b> <b>budget.</b> In so far as the thermohaline circulation governs the rate at which deep waters reach the surface, it may also significantly influence atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations.|$|E
25|$|There are {{arguments}} against the disposable soma theory. The theory clearly predicts that {{a shortage of}} food should make the compromise more severe all around; but in many experiments, ongoing since 1930, it has been demonstrated that animals live longer when fed substantially less than controls. This is the caloric restriction (CR) effect, and it cannot be easily reconciled with the Disposable Soma theory. Though by decreasing energy expenditure the damage generated (by free radicals, for instance) {{is expected to be}} reduced and the total <b>energy</b> <b>budget</b> might indeed be reduced, but the investment in repair function might still be relatively the same. But dietary restriction has not been shown to increase lifetime reproductive success (fitness), because when food availability is lower, reproductive output is also lower. So CR does thus not completely dismiss disposable soma theory.|$|E
25|$|The use {{of silicon}} by diatoms is {{believed}} by many researchers {{to be the}} key to their ecological success. In a now classic study, Egge and Aksnes (1992) found that diatom dominance of mesocosm communities was directly related to the availability of silicic acid — when concentrations were greater than 2 µmol m−3, they found that diatoms typically represented more than 70% of the phytoplankton community. Raven (1983) noted that, relative to organic cell walls, silica frustules require less energy to synthesize (approximately 8% of a comparable organic wall), potentially a significant saving on the overall cell <b>energy</b> <b>budget.</b> Other researchers have suggested that the biogenic silica in diatom cell walls acts as an effective pH buffering agent, facilitating the conversion of bicarbonate to dissolved CO2 (which is more readily assimilated). Notwithstanding the possible advantages conferred by silicon, diatoms typically have higher growth rates than other algae of a corresponding size.|$|E

25|$|Gaseous water {{represents}} {{a small but}} environmentally significant constituent of the atmosphere. The percentage water vapor in surface air varies from 0.01% at -42°C (-44°F) to 4.24% when the dew point is 30°C (86°F). Approximately 99.13% of it is contained in the troposphere. The condensation of water vapor to the liquid or ice phase is responsible for clouds, rain, snow, and other precipitation, all of which count among the most significant elements of what we experience as weather. Less obviously, the latent heat of vaporization, which is released to the atmosphere whenever condensation occurs, {{is one of the}} most important terms in the atmospheric <b>energy</b> <b>budget</b> on both local and global scales. For example, latent heat release in atmospheric convection is directly responsible for powering destructive storms such as tropical cyclones and severe thunderstorms.
