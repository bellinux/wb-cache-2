A group of {{conservative}} Republicans {{in both houses of}} Congress, including Newt Gingrich, <b>Dick</b> <b>Armey,</b> Henry Hyde and Rick Santorum, and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children both argued for affirming the conviction, pointing to the invaluable nature of undercover investigations in fighting child pornography, worrying that requiring reasonable suspicion beforehand could make such operations impossible. Americans for Effective Law Enforcement said there had been no entrapment and that reasonable suspicion was not required before starting investigations such as Looking Glass. The American Civil Liberties Union, its Nebraska chapter and the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers weighed in on Jacobson's behalf.|$|E

2500|$|Former UCLA {{professor}} of information studies, Philip E. Agre and journalist Eric Boehlert argued that three articles in Wired News {{led to the}} creation of the widely spread urban legend that Gore claimed to have [...] "invented the Internet," [...] which followed this interview. Jim Wilkinson, who at the time was working as congressman <b>Dick</b> <b>Armey's</b> spokesman, also helped sell the idea that Gore claimed to have [...] "invented the internet." [...] Computer professionals and congressional colleagues argued against this characterization. Internet pioneers Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn stated that [...] "we don't think, as some people have argued, that Gore intended to claim he 'invented' the Internet. Moreover, there is no question in our minds that while serving as Senator, Gore's initiatives had a significant and beneficial effect on the still-evolving Internet." [...] Cerf would also later state: [...] "Al Gore had seen what happened with the National Interstate and Defense Highways Act of 1956, which his father introduced as a military bill. It was very powerful. Housing went up, suburban boom happened, everybody became mobile. Al was attuned to the power of networking much more than any of his elective colleagues. His initiatives led directly to the commercialization of the Internet. So he really does deserve credit." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{allocation}} of financial resources at local, {{but also at}} central level, is an issue especially since in times of crisis, finding the optimum way to spend public funds concerns all authorities. This paper aims to identify the ways in which, by leaving from the division of powers based on the {{allocation of}} resources and tools available, the local authorities can identify an optimal level of public expenditure so as to achieve a maximum level of using them. Also, the paper seeks to identify the impact that the local public expenditure can have {{on the development of}} local gross domestic product as an expression of social welfare. Starting from the scientific acquisitions of <b>Dick</b> and Richard <b>Armey,</b> the "Armey Curve" was revised, thus identifying two components of the public sector: a central one and a local one. Following that, a chart relationship was established between the allocation of local public funds and the social welfare expressed by the local gross domestic product. By analyzing the shape of this chart, two econometric models have been developed: one regarding the impact of local resource allocation, and another one setting the optimal level of allocation of local public funds. public expenditure, local authorities, Armey, optimum, welfare...|$|R
5000|$|In 2006, Michael Isikoff's book Hubris {{included}} Armey as an on-the-record source, {{who said}} he was initially reluctant to support the Bush administration's call for war with Iraq, and that he had warned President George W. Bush that such a war might be a [...] "quagmire". Armey said that the intelligence presented to him in support of the war appeared questionable, but he gave Bush the benefit of the doubt. According to Barton Gellman, former Vice President <b>Dick</b> Cheney told <b>Armey</b> that Saddam Hussein's family had direct ties to Al-Qaeda and that Saddam was developing miniature nuclear weapons. Armey then voted for the Iraq War, but after it became clear this was not true, stated that he [...] "deserved better from Cheney than to be bullshitted by him." [...] Robert Draper's Dead Certain: The Presidency of George W. Bush recounts a conversation in late summer 2002 between Armey and Cheney. Armey insisted that American forces would get [...] "mired down" [...] in Iraq if they invaded, but Cheney offered this assurance: [...] "They're going to welcome us. It'll be like the American army going through the streets of Paris. They're sitting there ready to form a new government.

25|$|After {{serving as}} his party's Whip for eight years, DeLay was elected Majority Leader upon the {{retirement}} of <b>Dick</b> <b>Armey</b> in 2003. His tenure as Majority Leader was marked by strong Republican party discipline and by parliamentary and redistricting efforts to preserve Republican control of the House. After his indictment on September 28, 2005, DeLay stepped down from his position as Majority Leader. He was the first congressional leader ever to be indicted. Rep. Roy Blunt of Missouri took over as acting leader.|$|E
25|$|Unlike in Westminster style legislatures or as {{with the}} Senate Majority Leader, the House Majority Leader's duties and {{prominence}} vary depending upon the style {{and power of the}} Speaker of the House. Typically, the Speaker does not participate in debate and rarely votes on the floor. In some cases, Majority Leaders have been more influential than the Speaker; notably Tom DeLay who was more prominent than Speaker Dennis Hastert. In addition, Speaker Newt Gingrich delegated to <b>Dick</b> <b>Armey</b> an unprecedented level of authority over scheduling legislation on the House floor.|$|E
25|$|The 1984 United States House of Representatives {{elections}} was {{an election}} for the United States House of Representatives in 1984 which {{coincided with the}} re-election of President Ronald Reagan in a landslide.

Release of the movie was also covered and promoted by Fox News TV personalities John Stossel and Sean Hannity.|$|E
25|$|Starting with Republican Nicholas Longworth in 1925, and {{continued}} through the Democrats' control of the House from 1931 to 1995, save for Republican majorities in 1947–49 and 1953–55, all majority leaders have directly ascended to the Speakership brought upon by the retirement of the incumbent. The only exceptions during this period were Charles A. Halleck who became Republican House leader and Minority Leader from 1959 to 1965, Hale Boggs {{who died in a}} plane crash, and Dick Gephardt who became the Democrats' House leader but as Minority Leader since his party lost control in the 1994 midterm elections. Since 1995, the only Majority Leader to become Speaker is John Boehner, though indirectly as his party lost control in the 2006 midterms elections. He subsequently served as Republican House leader and Minority Leader from 2007 to 2011 and then was elected Speaker when the House reconvened in 2011. In 1998, with Speaker Newt Gingrich announcing his resignation, both Majority Leader <b>Dick</b> <b>Armey</b> and Majority Whip Tom DeLay did not contest the Speakership which eventually went to Chief Deputy Whip Dennis Hastert.|$|E
500|$|Although he {{reportedly}} had no warning of Livingston's decision to step aside, Hastert [...] "began lobbying on the House floor within moments" [...] of [...] Livingston's announcement, {{and by the}} afternoon of that day had secured the public backing of the House Republican leadership, including Gingrich, DeLay (who was [...] "viewed as too partisan {{to step into the}} role of Speaker") and <b>Dick</b> <b>Armey</b> (who was [...] "viewed as too weak" [...] and was damaged by party infighting). [...] On that day, Hastert was endorsed by about a hundred Republican representatives, ranging from conservatives such as Steve Largent to moderates such as Mike Castle, for the speakership. Representative Christopher Cox of California, viewed as a potential rival, decided by evening not to challenge Hastert for the speakership. Hastert became known as [...] "the Accidental Speaker." ...|$|E
500|$|Jackson {{acknowledges}} {{that he has had}} the benefits of privilege and opportunity and says that his hobbies include fencing, hunting and fishing, especially salmon fishing. [...] He often enjoys these hobbies in bipartisan friendships that include <b>Dick</b> <b>Armey</b> and regarded the late Republican Rep. Henry Hyde as one of his closest friends. [...] In fact, Armey points to Jackson as an example of his ability to work with politicians at all ends of the political spectrum. [...] Jackson also has a very good relationship with Republican United States President George W. Bush despite their sharp ideological differences. [...] The relationship traces back to when Jackson Sr. and United States President-Elect George H. W.

[...] He also developed a relationship with Bill and Hillary Clinton that enabled him to watch Super Bowl XXXIII at Camp David with them.|$|E

In 1990, Frank was instrumental in crafting the 1990 Immigration Act, which restated the reasons for which a person could be denied entry into the country. [...] The act did not include [...] "sexual preference exclusion", reforming earlier immigration law which allowed persons to be excluded for a sexual deviance [...] "afflict". He said in a 1996 interview: [...] "I'm used to being in the minority. I'm a left-handed gay Jew. I've never felt, automatically, a member of any majority."

500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1997, several House Republicans {{attempted}} to replace him as Speaker, claiming Gingrich's public image was a liability. The attempted [...] "coup" [...] began July 9 with a meeting of Republican conference chairman John Boehner of Ohio and Republican leadership chairman Bill Paxon of New York. According to their plan, House Majority Leader <b>Dick</b> <b>Armey,</b> House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, Boehner and Paxon were to present Gingrich with an ultimatum: resign, or be voted out. However, Armey balked at the proposal to make Paxon the new Speaker, and told {{his chief of staff}} to warn Gingrich. On July 11, Gingrich met with senior Republican leadership to assess the situation. He explained that under no circumstance would he step down. If he was voted out, there would be a new election for Speaker. This would allow for the possibility that Democrats, along with dissenting Republicans, would vote in Democrat Dick Gephardt as Speaker. On July 16, Paxon offered to resign his post, feeling that he had not handled the situation correctly, as {{the only member of the}} leadership who had been appointed to his position—by Gingrich—instead of elected.|$|E
2500|$|DeLay was {{not always}} on good terms with Gingrich or <b>Dick</b> <b>Armey,</b> the House Majority Leader from 1995 to 2003, and he {{reportedly}} considered them uncommitted to Christian values.
