40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to explore multiplatform storytelling <b>in</b> brand <b>social</b> <b>media</b> practices, based on the case of the brand NikeWomen. The study aimed to answer one main research question: How do brands engage <b>in</b> multiplatform <b>social</b> <b>media</b> storytelling?, and three sub-questions: (1) How is NikeWomen engaging <b>in</b> multiplatform <b>social</b> <b>media</b> use? (2) How does NikeWomen use storytelling on <b>social</b> <b>media?</b> (3) What are the characteristics of multiplatform storytelling <b>in</b> NikeWomen <b>social</b> <b>media</b> practices? <b>In</b> the absence of an existing theoretical framework on multiplatform <b>social</b> <b>media</b> use, this study constructed the multiplatform <b>social</b> <b>media</b> storytelling framework, using transmedia storytelling as a reference, and translating its elements into the <b>social</b> <b>media</b> context. The study used qualitative and quantitative content analysis. Qualitative content analysis was used to categorize NikeWomen <b>social</b> <b>media</b> content and to make inferences about the meaning of its content in terms of storytelling. Quantitative analysis was used to calculate frequencies and volumes of <b>social</b> <b>media</b> posts, as well audience interactions, necessary to understand the brand’s multiplatform <b>social</b> <b>media</b> use. Qualitative and quantitative findings were then combined for an analysis of the characteristics NikeWomen multiplatform <b>social</b> <b>media</b> storytelling. The study resulted in three main findings: (1) NikeWomen engages <b>in</b> multiplatform <b>social</b> <b>media</b> use and cross promotes content in various ways; (2) NikeWomen engages <b>in</b> storytelling on <b>social</b> <b>media</b> by using elements of the Hero’s Journey narrative formula in its greater brand narrative, which sets the context for a diversity of content marketing; and (3) the combined elements of NikeWomen multiplatform <b>social</b> <b>media</b> storytelling follow to varying degrees the theoretical framework set forth in this study. These findings suggest that brands can use storytelling elements <b>in</b> their multiplatform <b>social</b> <b>media</b> use to present a unified and cohesive narrative across multiple channels...|$|R

5|$|In December 2013, Burger King {{returned}} to Finland after {{three decades of}} absence. The first restaurant, located on Mannerheimintie in central Helsinki, instantly proved so popular that for every day since its opening, people have had to queue {{in front of the}} restaurant to get in, sometimes for over half an hour. The only exception so far has been Christmas time, when the restaurant was closed. According to Mikko Molberg, the leader of the Finnish Burger King franchise, the restaurant has attracted over 2000 customers on every single day, which has surprised the restaurant employees and the franchise owners. The long queues have been extensively covered and ridiculed <b>in</b> <b>social</b> <b>media,</b> comparing them to people queuing in front of a McDonald's restaurant in Moscow, Russia in the early 1990s, and contrasting them with the nearly nonexistent queues to Burger King restaurants in Stockholm, Sweden.|$|E
40|$|Background <b>Social</b> <b>media</b> is {{constantly}} growing {{and has also}} started to be a platform for dissatisfied customers to express their complaints. This give companies an opportunity {{to respond to the}} complaints by solving the problems and prevent customers from switching to competitors or spread negative word of mouth. Therefore, it is important to handle complaints in a proper way. There are six response dimensions that are of importance when handling complaints and that impacts customer satisfaction. These dimensions will be used in this research and are named timeliness, redress, apology, credibility, attentiveness and facilitation. Purpose To explain how companies’ complaint handling positively impact customer satisfaction <b>in</b> the <b>social</b> <b>media</b> context. Method This research utilizes a quantitative approach and consist of six hypotheses: H 1 Timeliness has a positive impact on customer satisfaction <b>in</b> the <b>social</b> <b>media</b> context. H 2 Redress has a positive impact on customer satisfaction <b>in</b> the <b>social</b> <b>media</b> context. H 3 Apology has a positive impact on customer satisfaction <b>in</b> the <b>social</b> <b>media</b> context. H 4 Credibility has a positive impact on customer satisfaction <b>in</b> the <b>social</b> <b>media</b> context. H 5 Attentiveness has a positive impact on customer satisfaction <b>in</b> the <b>social</b> <b>media</b> context. H 6 Facilitation has a positive impact on customer satisfaction <b>in</b> the <b>social</b> <b>media</b> context. The sample is users of <b>social</b> <b>media</b> that are 18 years old or older. The sampling was done by using convenience sampling and the snowball effect. The data were collected using an online questionnaire which was sent out via Facebook. Conclusion It can be concluded that complaint handling positively impact customer satisfaction <b>in</b> the <b>social</b> <b>media</b> context by the use of facilitation. Timeliness, redress, apology, credibility and attentiveness have no significant positive impact on customer satisfaction. Since facilitation is about procedures and events that happens before the actual response to the complaint, it could be concluded that complaint handling is something that companies needs to work with proactive in order to affect customer satisfaction positiv...|$|R

5|$|According to Andrew Hampp of Billboard, the pre-order for Rebel Heart {{received}} a strong commercial response after its release to iTunes Stores around the world. Pre-orders were estimated at around 50,000 to 60,000 copies, {{according to industry}} prognosticators. Rebel Heart debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 chart with 121,000 album equivalent units, behind the soundtrack of the TV series Empire. While it was the best-selling album of the week—ranking number one on Billboards Top Album Sales chart with pure album sales of 116,000 copies (96% of overall units)—it fell behind the soundtrack {{when it came to}} streaming and track equivalent album units, with just over 1,000 and 4,000 units respectively. It became Madonna's 21st top-ten album, but was her first studio release not to debut atop the chart since 1998's Ray of Light. Rebel Hearts concert tour bundle amounted to less than 10,000 copies compared to the 180,000 copies sold for her previous album, MDNA. The release also prompted Madonna to debut at number seven on the Billboard Artist 100 chart, moving up by 2,919% in overall Artist 100 points and gaining 31% <b>in</b> <b>social</b> <b>media</b> activity. In Canada, Rebel Heart debuted at number one on the Canadian Albums Chart with 18,000 copies sold in the first week, making it her seventh number-one there during the SoundScan era. The next week, the album dropped 19 places on the Billboard 200, while in Canada it dropped only one position. Billboard reported that the sales dropped by 78% to 26,000 units, a reflection of the high pre-orders during first week. The album was present for a total of 11 weeks on the chart, and ranked at number 151 on the Billboard 200 year end chart for 2015. As of December 2016, the album has sold 238,000 copies in the US according to Nielsen SoundScan.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Automatic {{understanding}} of noisy <b>social</b> <b>media</b> text {{is one of}} the prime present-day research areas. Most research has so far concentrated on English texts; however, {{more than half of the}} users are writing in other languages, making language identification a pre-requisite for comprehensive processing of <b>social</b> <b>media</b> text. Though language identification has been considered an almost solved problem in other applications, language detectors fail <b>in</b> the <b>social</b> <b>media</b> context due to phenomena such as code-mixing, code-switching, lexical borrowings, Anglicisms, and phonetic typing. This paper reports an initial study to understand the characteristics of code-mixing <b>in</b> the <b>social</b> <b>media</b> context and presents a system developed to automatically detect language boundaries <b>in</b> code-mixed <b>social</b> <b>media</b> text, here exemplified by Facebook messages in mixed English-Bengali and English-Hindi...|$|R
