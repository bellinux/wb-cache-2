Chalmers, he began studying radioactive isotopes for medical purposes. It was known that bombarding elements with neutrons could produce either heavier isotopes of an element, or a heavier element, a phenomenon known as the Fermi Effect after its discoverer, the Italian physicist Enrico Fermi. When they bombarded <b>ethyl</b> <b>iodide</b> with neutrons produced by a radon-beryllium source, {{they found that the}} heavier radioactive isotopes of iodine separated from the compound. Thus, they had discovered a means of isotope separation. This method became known as the Szilard–Chalmers effect, and was widely used in the preparation of medical isotopes. He also attempted unsuccessfully to create a nuclear chain reaction using beryllium by bombarding it with X-rays. In 1936, Szilard assigned his chain-reaction patent to the British Admiralty to ensure its secrecy.|$|E

40|$|Photodissociation {{dynamics}} {{of a series}} of α-branched alkyl iodides at excitation wavelengths of 222, 266, and ∼ 305 nm has been investigated by measuring the quantum yield (ϕ^*) of I^*(^ 2 P_ 1 / 2) production. I^* is found to be the major product at 222 nm and 266 nm from methyl and <b>ethyl</b> <b>iodides</b> but not from the higher α-branched homologs. On the contrary, I(2 ^P_ 3 / 2) is the major product at 305 nm for all the iodides. Assuming that I^* originates from the ^ 3 Q_ 0 state over the entire A-band, production of both I and I^* in methyl and <b>ethyl</b> <b>iodides</b> at 222 and 266 nm is explained by invoking the curve-crossing mechanism in the upper state. The crossing probability (P) between the ^ 3 Q_ 0 and ^ 1 Q_ 1 surfaces for these two molecules has been estimated. At 305 nm, simultaneous excitation to the ^ 3 Q_ 0 and ^ 3 Q_ 1 states remains a distinct possibility. For higher branched (i. e., i-propyl and t-butyl) alkyl iodides, the mechanism for I^* production is qualitatively different from that of unbranched iodides. Coupling of a-carbon bending vibrational modes with the C–I bond excitation as well as the actual time spent in the excited state surfaces in i-propyl and t-butyl iodides seem to be the reasons for altering the {{dynamics of}} dissociation drastically in comparison with that of methyl iodide...|$|R

The synthesis of triblock compounds {{was performed in}} two different ways {{according to the length}} of the hydrogenated moiety.

The synthesis of compounds with larger hydrogenated part is accomplished in two steps by the addition of perfluoro-n-alkyl iodide F(CF 2) (n) l to 1, 5 -hexadiene and 1, 7 -octadiene, respectively to give the diiodo-adducts which are subsequently deiodinated to the final triblock products F(CF 2) (6) (CH 2) (6) (CF 2) (6) F, F(CF 2) (6) (CH 2) (8) (CF 2) (6) F, F(CF 2) (8) (CH 2) (6) (CF 2) (8) F and F(CF) (8) (CH 2) (8) (CF 2) (8) F.

40|$|International audienceA tunable strategy, {{based on}} the {{combination}} of Surface-Initiated Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization (SI-ATRP) and the Layer by Layer (LbL) deposition of polyelectrolytes, was exploited to design tailor-made polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEM) with unusual nanometric features. The cornerstone of the approach is to use polyelectrolytes grafted onto a planar inorganic substrate with different chain conformations as a template for depositing PEM. More particularly, tethered poly(trimethylammonium <b>ethyl</b> methacrylate <b>iodide)</b> (PTMAEMAI) grafts provide various 3 D distributions of charge due to a conformation transition of the precursor quaternizable poly(N, N-dimethylamino) ethyl methacrylate (PDMAEMA) chains from 'pancake' to brush-like regime. The change of regime was ensured through the controlled variation of the graft molecular weight using SI-ATRP. The regions made of attached-polycations may serve as preferential positively charged anchoring sites and act as structure-directing agents for the subsequent LbL self-assembly of poly(sodium 4 -styrenesulfonate) (PSS) /poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDADMAC) multilayers. We have revealed the possibility to fine manipulate (i) the interaction abilities and (ii) the topology of (PSS/PDADMAC) films through the spatial organization exhibited by the PTMAEMAI grafts. This appears as a well-suited and straightforward tool to create an adjustable nanoscale patterning of the resulting multilayers...|$|R

The isomerization/decomposition of isoprene was looked at in detail with special attention to the formation of soot precursor, most notably the "first ring" benzene. Cyclopentadiene and methylcyclopentadiene are known to be highly sooting fuels and were pyrolyzed to study the initial steps in aromatization.

40|$|The {{effects of}} four organophosphorous compounds, three oximes and {{atropine}} sulphate, injected through an indwelling cannula {{into the third}} ventricle of unanaesthetized dogs were examined. The effects of 200 μg of dyflos were involuntary micturition, defaecation, akinesia of hind limbs and pronounced disturbances of awareness; those of 100 μg of ethyl pyrophosphate were tremor, restlessness and signs of fear; 500 μg to 5 mg of dyflos and 250 μg to 500 μg of ethyl pyrophosphate caused vomiting, salivation, twitches of facial muscles and recurrent epileptiform seizures. The injection of 40 to 80 mg of dimefox and of 50 mg of schradan elicited involuntary micturition, vomiting, salivation and defaecation. These effects occur probably after these substances have passed into the blood stream and have been converted in the liver to potent anticholinesterases.

At a dose level of 12. 5 mg, 1, 1 '-trimethylenebis(4 -hydroxyiminomethylpyridinium bromide) produced strong convulsions.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{previously}} validated NK 1 -receptor ligand [O - methyl - 11 C]GR 205171 binds {{with a high}} affinity to the NK 1 -receptor {{and displays}} a slow dissociation from the receptor. Hence, it cannot be used in vivo for detecting concentration changes in substance P, the endogenous ligand for the NK 1 -receptor. A radioligand used for monitoring these changes has to enable displacement by the endogenous ligand and thus bind reversibly to the receptor. Small changes {{in the structure of}} a receptor ligand can lead to changes in binding characteristics and also in the ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier. The aim {{of this study was to}} use carbon- 11 labelled <b>ethyl</b> and propyl <b>iodide</b> with high specific radioactivity in the synthesis of two new and potentially reversible NK 1 -receptor ligands with chemical structures based on [O - methyl - 11 C]GR 205171. Methods [1 - 11 C]Ethyl and [1 - 11 C]propyl iodide with specific radioactivities of 90 GBq/μmol and 270 GBq/μmol, respectively, were used in the synthesis of [O - methyl - 11 C]GR 205171 analogues by alkylation of O -desmethyl GR 205171.

Results All ligands had similar uptake distribution in the guinea pig brain. The PET-studies in rhesus monkeys showed that (II) had no specific binding in striatum. Ligand (I) had moderate specific binding compared to the [O - methyl - 11 C]GR 205171. The ethyl analogue (I) displayed reversible binding characteristics contrary to the slow dissociation rate shown by [O - methyl - 11 C]GR 205171. Conclusion The propyl-analogue (II) cannot be used for detecting changes in NK 1 -ligand levels, while further studies should be performed with the ethyl-analogue (I). </p...|$|R
