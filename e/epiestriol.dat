In addition to its estrogenic actions, <b>epiestriol</b> has been found to possess significant anti-inflammatory properties without glycogenic activity or immunosuppressive effects, an interesting finding that is in contrast to conventional anti-inflammatory steroids like hydrocortisone (a glucocorticoid).|$|E
