25|$|The Ultrasonic Cardiac Output Monitor (USCOM) uses {{continuous}} wave Doppler {{to measure the}} Doppler flow profile VTI. It uses anthropometry to calculate aortic and pulmonary valve diameters and CSAs, allowing right-sided and left-sided Q measurements. In comparison to the echocardiographic method, USCOM significantly improves reproducibility and increases sensitivity of the detection of changes in flow. Real-time, automatic tracing of the Doppler flow profile allows beat-to-beat right-sided and left-sided Q measurements, simplifying operation and reducing the time of acquisition compared to conventional echocardiography. USCOM has been validated from 0.12 l/min to 18.7 l/min in new-born babies, children and adults. The method can be applied with equal accuracy to patients of all ages {{for the development of}} physiologically rational haemodynamic protocols. USCOM is the only method of cardiac output measurement to have achieved equivalent accuracy to the implantable <b>flow</b> <b>probe.</b> This accuracy has ensured high levels of clinical use in conditions including sepsis, heart failure and hypertension.|$|E

40|$|Arterial {{blood flow}} was {{measured}} in dogs simultaneously with electromagnetic <b>flow</b> <b>probes</b> and with ultrasonic "flow probes. " The ultrasonic probes {{were used to determine}} transcutaneously the mean velocity of arterial flow and the cross-sectional area of the blood vessel. A 10 MHz probe was used for blood vessels 1 cm deep or less, while a 5 MHz probe was used for vessels between 1. 0 and 2. 5 cm deep. The correlation coefficient between the flow calculated with the ultrasound method and the flow measured with the electromagnetic <b>flow</b> <b>probes</b> was 0. 966, p less than 0. 01. Blood flow was also measured intraoperatively in five patients. There was a correlation coefficient of 0. 999, p less than 0. 01, between the flow obtained with the ultrasound method and that determined simultaneously by the electromagnetic <b>flow</b> <b>probes.</b> The coefficient of determination for the regression of electromagnetic-determined flow on ultrasound-determined flow was 0. 99.

50|$|As InSight science {{goals are}} not related to any {{particular}} surface feature of Mars, potential landing sites were chosen on the basis of practicality. Candidate sites needed to be near the equator of Mars to provide sufficient sunlight for the solar panels year round, have a low elevation to allow for sufficient atmospheric braking during EDL, flat, relatively rock-free to reduce the probability of complications during landing, and soft enough terrain to allow the heat <b>flow</b> <b>probe</b> to penetrate well into the ground. An optimal area that meets all these requirements is Elysium Planitia, so all 22 initial potential landing sites were located in this area. The only two other areas on the equator and at low elevation, Isidis Planitia and Valles Marineris, are too rocky. In addition, Valles Marineris has too steep a gradient to allow safe landing.|$|E

40|$|Continuous {{recording}} of {{blood flow to}} the coronary, renal and hindlimb vascular beds of sheep has been carried out using <b>flow</b> <b>probes</b> implanted around the major vessels supplying these regions. Blood flow has been recorded at rest, with the sheep running at speeds of 1 - 16 kmh- 1 on a treadmill, and during the recovery period. A Doppler flowmeter has been developed to facilitate compatibility with existing equipment, to enable reliable reproduction of the unit and to keep costs to a minimum. To minimize interference accompanying the violent movements of exercise great care must be taken with the electrical connections and <b>flow</b> <b>probes</b> require streamlining to facilitate implantation. Blood flow to both hindlimb and coronary vascular beds increased during exercise while that to the renal vascular bed did not change.

40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESThis {{study was}} {{performed}} to validate the accuracy of color flow vena contracta (VC) measurements of aortic regurgitation (AR) severity by comparing them to simultaneous intraoperative <b>flow</b> <b>probe</b> measurements of regurgitant fraction (RgF) and regurgitant volume (RgV). BACKGROUNDColor Doppler imaging of the vena contracta {{has emerged as a}} simple and reliable measure of the severity of valvular regurgitation. This study evaluated the accuracy of VC imaging of AR by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). METHODSA transit-time <b>flow</b> <b>probe</b> was placed on the ascending aorta during cardiac surgery in 24 patients with AR. The <b>flow</b> <b>probe</b> was used to measure RgF and RgV simultaneously during VC imaging by TEE. <b>Flow</b> <b>probe</b> and VC imaging were interpreted separately and in blinded fashion. RESULTSA good correlation was found between VC width and RgF (r = 0. 85) and RgV (r = 0. 79). All six patients with VC width > 6 mm had a RgF > 0. 50. All 18 patients with VC width 7. 5 mm 2 had a RgF > 0. 50, and all 18 patients with a VC area < 7. 5 mm 2 had a RgF < 0. 50. In a subset of nine patients who underwent afterload manipulation to increase diastolic blood pressure, RgV increased significantly (34 ± 26 ml to 41 ± 27 ml, p = 0. 042) while VC width remained unchanged (5. 4 ± 2. 8 mm to 5. 4 ± 2. 8 mm, p = 0. 41). CONCLUSIONSVena contracta imaging by TEE color flow mapping is an accurate marker of AR severity. Vena contracta width and VC area correlate well with RgF and RgV obtained by intraoperative <b>flow</b> <b>probe.</b> Vena contracta width appears to be less afterload-dependent than RgV...|$|E
40|$|ObjectivesThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} whether cardiac output (CO) could be accurately computed from live three-dimensional (3 -D) Doppler echocardiographic data in an acute open-chested animal preparation. BackgroundThe accurate measurement of CO is important in both patient management and research. Current methods use invasive pulmonary artery catheters or two-dimensional (2 -D) echocardiography or esophageal aortic Doppler measures, with the inherent risks and inaccuracies of these techniques. MethodsSeventeen juvenile, open-chested pigs were studied before undergoing a separate cardiopulmonary bypass procedure. Live 3 -D Doppler echocardiography images of the left ventricular outflow tract and aortic valve were obtained by epicardial scanning, using a Philips Medical Systems (Andover, Massachusetts) Sonos 7500 Live 3 -D Echo system with a 2. 5 -MHz probe. Simultaneous CO measurements were obtained from an ultrasonic <b>flow</b> <b>probe</b> placed around the aortic root. Subsequent offline processing using custom software computed the CO from the digital 3 -D Doppler DICOM data, and this was compared to the gold standard of the aortic <b>flow</b> <b>probe</b> measurements. ResultsOne hundred forty-three individual CO measurements were taken from 16 pigs, one being excluded because of severe aortic regurgitation. There was good correlation between the 3 -D Doppler and <b>flow</b> <b>probe</b> methods of CO measurement (y = 1. 1 x − 9. 82, R 2 = 0. 93). ConclusionsIn this acute animal preparation, live 3 -D Doppler echocardiographic data allowed for accurate assessment of CO as compared to the ultrasonic <b>flow</b> <b>probe</b> measurement...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: We {{investigated}} {{the accuracy of}} left-to-right shunt detection using transpulmonary ultrasound dilution (TPUD) and compared the agreement between pulmonary over systemic blood flow (Qp/Qs) ratio measured by TPUD [Qp/Qs(tpud) ] and ultrasonic <b>flow</b> <b>probes</b> [Qp/Qs(ufp) ]. METHODS: Seven newborn lambs under general anesthesia were connected to the TPUD monitor (COstatus) after insertion of arterial and central venous catheters. A Gore-Tex(R) shunt, inserted between the descending aorta and left pulmonary artery, was intermittently opened and closed while cardiac output was varied by blood withdrawals. <b>Flow</b> <b>probes</b> were placed around the main pulmonary artery (Qufp) and the descending aorta proximal (Qpre) and distal (Qpost) to the shunt insertion. Qp/Qs(ufp) was calculated as (Qufp+Qpre-Qpost) /Qufp. RESULTS: Seventy-two paired measurement sessions were analyzed. Shunts were detected by TPUD with a positive predictive value of 86 %, a negative predictive value of 100 %, a sensitivity of 100 % and a specificity of 83 %. The Bland-Altman analysis comparing Qp/Qs(tpud) and Qp/Qs(ufp) showed an overall mean bias (SD) of 0. 1 (0. 3), limits of agreement (LOA) of +/- 0. 6 and a percentage error of 34. 8 %.

40|$|Heat flow is a {{fundamental}} property of a planet, and provides significant constraints on the abundance of radiogenic isotopes, the thermal evolution and differentiation history, and the mechanical properties of the lithosphere. Heat-flow measurements are also essential in achieving at least four of the goals set out by the National Research Council for future lunar exploration. The heat-flow probe therefore directly addresses {{the goal of the}} Lunar Geophysical Network, which is to understand the interior structure and composition of the Moon. A key challenge for heat flow measurement is to install thermal sensors to the depths approximately equal to 3 m that are not influenced by the diurnal, annual, and longer-term fluctuations of the surface thermal environment. In addition, once deployed, the heat <b>flow</b> <b>probe</b> should cause little disturbance to the thermal regime of the surrounding regolith. A heat-flow probe system was developed that has two novel features: (1) it utilizes a pneumatic (gas) approach, excavates a hole by lofting the lunar soil out of the hole, and (2) deploys the heat <b>flow</b> <b>probe,</b> which utilizes a coiled up tape as a thermal probe to reach greater than 3 -meter depth. The system is a game-changer for small lunar landers as it exhibits extremely low mass, volume, and simple deployment. The pneumatic system takes advantage of the helium gas used for pressurizing liquid propellant of the lander. Normally, helium is vented once the lander is on the surface, but it can be utilized for powering pneumatic systems. Should sufficient helium not be available, a simple gas delivery system may be taken specifically for the heat <b>flow</b> <b>probe.</b> Either way, the pneumatic heat <b>flow</b> <b>probe</b> system would be much lighter than other systems that entirely rely on the electrical power of the lander...|$|E

40|$|Depressed left {{ventricular}} function {{during the early}} part (first third) of both systole and diastole in the resting state {{have been reported to}} be sensitive indicators of coronary artery disease in patients with normal global function at rest. To evaluate the possible mechanisms of these findings, 11 dogs were chronically instrumented with segmental function sonomicrometers in the left circumflex and left anterior descending coronary artery distribution, circumflex coronary <b>flow</b> <b>probes</b> and cuff occluders, aortic <b>flow</b> <b>probes</b> and ventricular pressure transducers. Percent segmental function during the first third of systole and diastole was measured in the control state and with graded circumflex artery flow reductions. Significant decreases in early systolic function with ischemia in the circumflex artery distribution were partially offset by compensatory augmented shortening in the left anterior descending artery distribution. With ischemia in the circumflex distribution, there was prolonged contraction into diastole manifested as impaired relaxation. Simultaneously, in the left anterior descending artery distribution, there was minimal compensatory enhanced relaxation. These results suggest that early systolic dysfunction in ischemic segments may be offset by enhanced function in nonischemic segments, rendering minimal, if any, change in global systolic function. Early diastolic dysfunction in ischemic segments exceeds compensatory changes in nonischemic areas by two-to four-fold. Hence, early diastolic functional indexes may be more sensitive indicators of ischemia at rest than early systolic functional indexes...|$|R
