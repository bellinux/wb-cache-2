40|$|The {{objective}} of this project was to characterise resistance to sulfonylurea herbicides in UK biotypes of the grass-weed Alopecurus myosuroides. Investigations included field studies, glasshouse bioassays, biochemical and molecular analyses. Responses to the selective sulfonylureas mesosulfuron-methyl + iodosulfiiron-methyl sodium mixture and <b>flupyrsulfuron-methyl</b> were investigated, while extensive use {{was made of the}} non-selective sulfonylurea herbicide sulfometuron-methyl as a screen for possible ALS target site resistance in A. myosuroides.

40|$|For the {{analysis}} of metsulfuron-methyl in the crop soils with a sensitivity limit of 0. 3 mug kg(- 1) dry soil, in the soil extract metsulfuron-methyl was separated from its soil metabolites and the soil impurities by repeated thin-layer chromatographies (TLC). In the cleaned soil extract, diazomethane transformed metsulfuron-methyl 1 into N,N' -dimethyl metsulfuron-methyl 2 (methyl 2 -[[[[(4 -methoxy- 6 -methyl- 1, 3, 5 -triazin- 2 -yl) methylamino]carbonyl]methylamino]sulfonyl]benzoate). In the gas-liquid chromatograph with detection by electron capture (GC-EC) and in the combined gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC-MS), 2 was transformed into 1 -dioxy- 2 -N-methyl- 3 -keto- 1, 2 -benzisothiazole 3 which was measured by GC-EC with confirmation by GC-MS. The metsulfuron-methyl soil metabolites 2 -sulfonamido-methylbenzoate 6, 1 -dioxy- 3 -keto- 1, 2 -benzisothiazole (saccharin) 7 and 2 -sulfonamidobenzoic acid 8 were analyzed in the soil of winter wheat crops by a procedure {{similar to the one}} for metsulfuron-methyl. After their separation and purification in the soil extracts by TLC, 7 and 8 were methylated, and analyzed as 3 in the GC-EC and GC-MS apparatus where the generated 6 was quantitatively transformed into 3; 6 was analyzed as such with the GC and GC-MS apparatus wherein it was transformed into 3. The sensitivity limit for each metabolite was 0. 3 mug of equivalents of metsulfuron-methyl kg(- 1) dry soil. The syntheses of {{the analysis}} standards of the metsulfuron-methyl derivatives 2 and 3, and of the metsulfuron-methyl metabolites 6, 7 and 8 are described. The transformation pathways of metsulfuron-methyl and of its derivatives are {{different from those of the}} pyridine-pyrimidine sulfonylurea herbicides <b>flupyrsulfuron-methyl</b> and rimsulfuron. The soil analysis of a sulfonylurea -by means of one of its transformation product- needs a previous study of the chemical reactivity of the sulfonylurea. This leads to the analysis procedures for the main soil metabolites of the sulfonylurea...|$|E
