5|$|Another issue {{concerned}} {{the election of}} the president. Few agreed with Madison that the executive should be elected by the legislature. There was widespread concern with direct election, because information diffused so slowly in the late 18th century, and because of concerns that people would only vote for candidates from their state or region. A vocal minority wanted the national <b>executive</b> <b>to</b> be chosen by the governors of the states.|$|E

After graduation in June 1957, he served as <b>executive</b> <b>to</b> the Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force, General Thomas D. White.

5|$|In Thio Li-ann's view, {{it appears}} that the High Court allowed the matter to be decided {{according}} to the subjective discretion of the Minister. The only explanation given for deregistration was that the Jehovah's Witnesses' refusal to perform national service was contrary to the public interest. The Court did not require the <b>executive</b> <b>to</b> elaborate on exactly how a failure to perform national service would be contrary to public interest. It accepted the executive's discretion to derogate a fundamental right without a close scrutiny of the executive's rationale and explanations.|$|E

The by-law also clarifies that a builder {{does not need to}} have been a coach, manager or <b>executive</b> <b>to</b> be inducted. Although they remain separate categories, the builders and on-ice officials are considered on the same ballot and a combined maximum of two can be inducted each year. The Board of Directors will now meet at least once every five years to consider potential changes to the limits.|$|E

5|$|The Chief Justice of Singapore, Chan Sek Keong, {{suggested}} extrajudicially {{during a}} 2010 lecture that Singapore courts may not apply the sufficient interest test {{with the same}} rigour as the UK courts. A more stringent application of the sufficient interest test would be {{in line with the}} green-light approach that the courts adopt in administrative law. Under this approach, the Government commits itself to good administrative practices while the courts play a supporting role by articulating clear rules for the <b>executive</b> <b>to</b> adhere to. Accordingly, the courts may adopt a more discriminating standing test to discourage litigation that will unnecessarily curtail the executive's ability to carry out good governance.|$|E

When raising a flag to be flown at half-mast, it should first be raised {{to the top of}} the pole and then lowered to a point where the distance between the top of the flag and the top of the pole is one third of the length of the pole. When lowering the flag from half-mast, it should first be raised to the peak of the pole before it is lowered.|$|E
5|$|The {{subjective}} test was rejected {{for several reasons}} by the Court of Appeal. It held that applying the {{subjective test}} to sections 8 and 10 of the ISA would render the provisions unconstitutional. The word law in Article 12(1) of the Constitution was held in Ong Ah Chuan v. Public Prosecutor (1980) to encompass fundamental rules of natural justice. Hence, Parliament cannot pass legislation which authorizes the <b>executive</b> <b>to</b> exercise power in breach of these fundamental rules or to exercise power in an arbitrary manner. If the subjective test were to be adopted, it would in effect allow the <b>executive</b> <b>to</b> exercise arbitrary powers of detention, therefore rendering sections8 and 10 of the ISA inconsistent with Article12(1). When the case was decided, Article149(1) of the Constitution, which protects the validity of anti-subversion laws notwithstanding inconsistencies with specified fundamental liberties, did not cover inconsistencies with Article12. Also, the Court noted that adopting the objective test {{would be consistent with}} Article93 of the Constitution, which vests judicial power in the courts. It did not, however, directly address the argument by counsel that the subjective test, in conferring arbitrary powers of detention, would be inconsistent with Article93.|$|E
5|$|Following the Manchester United board's {{search for}} new investors, the Glazers {{purchased}} their first tranche of Manchester United shares on 2 March 2003, spending around £9million on a 2.9% stake, which they purchased through a holding company called Red Football. On 26 September 2003, {{it was reported that}} they had increased their share to 3.17%, taking their shareholding above the 3% threshold that required them to inform the club's management. There had already been considerable speculation {{about the possibility of a}} takeover of the club, either by the Glazers or by one of several other interested parties. By 20 October, they had increased their shareholding to 8.93%, and on 29 November it was reported that they owned around 15% of the club and had met David Gill, its chief <b>executive,</b> <b>to</b> discuss their intentions. On 12 February 2004, the Glazers increased their stake in the club to 16.31% and the following day's Financial Times reported that they had instructed Commerzbank to explore a takeover bid. The club's share price increased by 5% that day, valuing the club at a total of £741million. The Glazers increased their shareholding to over 19% the following June, although they were still not the largest shareholders. Their shareholding continued to increase, nearing 30% by October 2004. Upon reaching 30%, they would have to launch a formal takeover bid.|$|E

5|$|The pair's {{pumpkins}} {{growth is}} slow, and Seth and Emma often clash during their collaboration. They grow closer while watching old films together and discussing their pasts. Seth {{talks about his}} degree in engineering from Stanford University and his decision {{to move out of}} the city in favor of the country, and Emma reveals her childhood dream of hosting her own talk show. When they are interviewed by Emma as part of her show, the Pumpkin Widows share stories of their husbands' obsessions with growing pumpkins. Emma and Seth sneak onto the mayor's farm to find out his pumpkin growing secrets. Emma asks Seth on a date while they appear at a promotional photo shoot in Seattle. Their date is interrupted by Emma accepting an offer from a television <b>executive</b> <b>to</b> be an anchor on a New York City morning news program. The pair's pumpkin starts growing larger; Emma finds the real pumpkin growing journal and learns that the other book was actually Walt's poems to his wife. Emma and Seth win the contest, and beat the record. Rejecting the New York job offer, Emma starts her own talk show in Valleyville along with Seth. Emma pays off Walt's debt with the prize money, and Seth opens his own car repair shop. The film ends with the couple becoming engaged.|$|E
5|$|The studio had wasted $5 {{million and}} a year's worth of time with Abel and Associates, {{although}} Abel reportedly gained a new production studio filled with equipment using Paramount's money. Trumbull, meanwhile, had completed Close Encounters but his plan for a full feature had been cancelled by Paramount, a move some considered punishment for passing on Star Trek. With Trumbull now available, primary responsibility for The Motion Pictures optical effects passed on to him. In March the studio offered Trumbull virtual carte blanche {{if he could get}} the opticals work completed by December, the release date to which Paramount was financially committed (having accepted advances from exhibitors planning on a Christmas delivery). Trumbull was confident that he could get the work done without a loss of quality despite a reputation for missing deadlines because of his perfectionism. Paramount assigned a studio <b>executive</b> <b>to</b> Trumbull to make sure he would meet the release date, and together with Yuricich the effects team rushed to finish. The effects budget climbed to $10million.|$|E
5|$|The House of Lords' {{statement}} on parliamentary privilege {{was assessed by}} the Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege, which recommended that Parliament not counter the decision in Pepper v Hart, but cautioned that this should not lead to any further weakening of parliamentary privilege. However, academics widely condemned the decision and the thinking behind it. Academic Aileen Kavanagh questioned the logic used; the House of Lords was essentially saying that, where a minister has made a statement about an act's intent that was not questioned by Parliament, that statement {{can be used as}} evidence. However, there are many reasons why Members of Parliament might not question a statement, and this does not necessarily indicate that they approve of it; {{in the case of the}} Finance Act, for example, it could simply be that as the statement was not going to be added to the statute, they found no reason to actively oppose it. At the same time, different Members of Parliament may approve of a statutory provision for different reasons. The fact that a minister gives certain reasons for including a provision does not necessarily indicate that Parliament agrees; only that Parliament also feels, for whatever reason, that the provision should be included. The decision also raises questions about the separation of powers in the United Kingdom; it has been consistently maintained that it is Parliament, not the executive, which passes legislation. If one accepts that statements by the executive can allow them to specify the meaning of particular laws without formally including them in statutes where they can be approved by Parliament, it violates this separation of powers, allowing the <b>executive</b> <b>to</b> make law.|$|E
