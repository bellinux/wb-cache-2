40|$|Aluminum {{production}} {{contributes to}} global CO 2 emissions both {{due to the}} production process itself and due to the generation of electric power required for aluminum production. A concept is presented for increasing the CO 2 concentration in the aluminum exhaust from ∼ 1 % to ∼ 5 % through the feeding of aluminum plant exhaust gas to a natural gas combined cycle (NGCC). The specific energy demand for CO 2 capture is therewith reduced for both the aluminum plant and the NGCC. An evaluation {{was made of the}} impact the aluminum exhaust gas may have on the gas turbine and it is estimated that the most critical issues are corrosion due to SO 2 in the aluminum plant exhaust gas and gas turbine <b>inlet</b> <b>filter</b> saturation, since the exhaust gas is saturated with seawater after the wet scrubber.

40|$|Background: Recently, the {{accuracies}} of many {{commercially available}} immunoassays for Vitamin D have been questioned. Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC- MS/MS) {{has been shown}} to facilitate accurate separation and quantification of the major circulating metabolite 25 -hydroxyvitamin-D 3 (25 OHD 3) and 25 hydroxyvitamin-D 2 (25 OHD 2) collectively termed as 25 OHD. However, among other interferents, this method may be compromised by overlapping peaks and identical masses of epimers and isobars, resulting in inaccuracies in circulating 25 OHD measurements. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop a novel LC-MS/MS method that can accurately identify and quantitate 25 OHD 3 and 25 OHD 2 through chromatographic separation of 25 OHD from its epimers and isobars. Methods: A positive ion electrospray ionisation (ESI) LC-MS/MS method was used in the Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM) mode for quantification.

We developed a {{decision support system}} (DSS) for TMDL compliance at the city level to solve for a phased, least-cost strategy toward meeting four TMDLs using stormwater filtration. Based on a case-study city, we modeled wet weather flows and associated discharge of Total Suspended Sediment (TSS), cadmium, copper, and zinc to receiving waters by coupling U. S.

We linked a mixed integer linear programming algorithm to the watershed model for deriving cost-effective selection and placement of curb <b>inlet</b> <b>filters</b> to meet mass- and concentration-based TMDL requirements. The least cost solution for meeting the city's TMDL waste load allocations for TSS (73. 9 % reduction), Cd (50. 6 % reduction), Cu (30. 0 % reduction), and Zn (55. 7 % reduction) would require 1071 filter inserts {{at a cost of}} $ 1. 7 million.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Exposure to {{particulate}} matter (PM) air pollution especially derived from traffic {{is associated with}} increases in cardiorespiratory morbidity and mortality. In this study, we evaluated the ability of novel vehicle cabin air <b>inlet</b> <b>filters</b> to reduce diesel exhaust (DE) -induced symptoms and markers of inflammation in human subjects. METHODS: Thirty healthy subjects participated in a randomized double-blind controlled crossover study where they were exposed to filtered air, unfiltered DE and DE filtered through two selected particle filters, one with and one without active charcoal. Exposures lasted for one hour. Symptoms were assessed before and during exposures and lung function was measured before and after each exposure, with inflammation assessed in peripheral blood five hours after exposures. In parallel, PM were collected from unfiltered and filtered DE and assessed for their capacity to drive damaging oxidation reactions in a cell-free model, or promote inflammation in A 549 cells. RESULTS: The standard particle filter employed in this study reduced PM 10 mass concentrations within the exposure chamber by 46 %, further reduced to 74 % by the inclusion of an active charcoal component. In addition use of the active charcoal filter was associated by a 75 % and 50 % reduction in NO 2 and hydrocarbon concentrations, respectively. As expected, subjects reported more subjective symptoms after exposure to unfiltered DE compared to filtered air, which was significantly reduced by the filter with an active charcoal component. There were no significant changes in lung function after exposures. Similarly diesel exhaust did not elicit significant increases {{in any of the}} inflammatory markers examined in the peripheral blood samples 5  hour post-exposure. Whilst the filters reduced chamber particle concentrations, the oxidative activity of the particles themselves, did not change following filtration with either filter. In contrast, diesel exhaust PM passed through the active charcoal combination filter appeared less inflammatory to A 549 cells. CONCLUSIONS: A cabin air <b>inlet</b> particle <b>filter</b> including an active charcoal component was highly effective in reducing both DE particulate and gaseous components, with reduced exhaust-induced symptoms in healthy volunteers.

40|$|<b>Inlet</b> <b>filters</b> are {{a common}} method for {{enhancing}} water quality in rainwater harvesting systems. They range from cheap cloth or gravel filters to complex and expensive multi-stage systems. Field experience has shown, however that filters often suffer {{from a lack of}} maintenance so self-cleaning is an advantage. Filters can clean themselves by dividing the water stream into two components; the first and largest is the clean water passed to the tank, the second much smaller component can be used to carry away suspended particulates. This paper reports the results of a series of laboratory tests on the abilities of very simple filters to remove particulates from roof run-off water. The low-cost (<$ 5) filters tested were of stretched cloth: two cloth types were used. Self-cleaning and plain (debris-retaining) filter designs were compared. Each filter was tested with a standard (published) contaminant load based on sand and Polyethylene sheet “leaves ” under a variety of representative flowrates. Filter performance indicators are 1. hydraulic efficiency – the fraction of water transmitted 2. cleaning effectiveness – the fraction of particulates removed from the flow. The initial tests showed that self-cleaning by using a sloping surface works satisfactorily and that simple cloth filters have a comparable performance to sophisticated filters found in German rainwater harvesting systems. However the German test configuration used was found to poorly represent roof run-off water in tropical countries and will be changed for continuing tests to be performed on refinements to the crude filters reported here...|$|R

Speed: 8400 rpm. Rated mass flow: 21, 585 Kg/hr [793 lb/min]. Power: 2. 3 MW. Discharge pressure: 10. 6 bara. [152. 3 Psia]. The subject air compressor forms part of the utility and instrumentation air supply system to an oil refinery. Constant pressure at header that supplies air to instrumentation system is very important.

40|$|Conventional {{soil and}} {{groundwater}} sampling procedures present {{many opportunities for}} loss of volatile organic compounds (VOC) by exposing sample media to the atmosphere during transfers between sampling devices and containers, ultimately affecting {{the quality of the}} analytical results. Inaccurate characterization data often leads to improperly designed remedial systems that slow the clean-up process and increase the cost. For these reasons, in situ methods for sample extraction and real time analysis provide attractive alternatives to conventional sampling and analysis. Under funding from the U. S. Department of Energy's Federal Energy Technology Center (FETC), the investigators continued development of a system that combines High Speed Gas Chromatography techniques with Cone Penetration Testing to achieve near-real time analysis of soils and groundwater for chlorinated and aromatic hydrocarbon contamination (PCE, TCE, BTEX) during site characterization. The system combines three new CPT tools with an up-hole analyzer. The Dynamic Thermal Desorption (DTD) probe provides the up-hole analyzer with continuously sampled soil gas, enhancing detection limits by heating the soil matrix during penetration to thermally desorb volatile organic contaminants. The CPT In Situ Purge Probe (CISP) purges a water sample in situ, transferring the purge gas up-hole for analysis. Alternatively, soil gas or purge gas from the DTD probe or the CISP can be diverted to a Downhole Trap Module (DTM), which traps contaminants on conventional trap media for later analysis in a fixed laboratory.

40|$|Electronic {{identification}} is an increasingly pervasive technology that permits rapid data recovery from low-power transponders whenever they are placed within {{the vicinity of}} an interrogator device. Fundamental benefits include proximity detection not requiring line-of-sight, multiple transponder access and data security. In this document, electronic identification methods for asset management are devised for the new target application of electrical appliance testing. In this application mains-powered apparatus are periodically subjected a prescribed series of electrical tests performed by a Portable Appliance Tester (PAT). The intention is to enhance the process of appliance identification and management, and to automate the test process as far as possible. Three principal methods of electronic identification were designed and analysed for this application: proximity Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), cable RFID and power- line signalling. Each method relies on an inductively coupled mechanism that utilities a signalling technique called direct-load modulation. This is particularly suited to low- cost passive transponder designs. Physical limitations to proximity RFID are identified including coil size, orientation and susceptibility to nearby conducting surfaces. A novel inductive signalling method called cable RFID is then described that permits automatic appliance identification. This method uses the appliance power cable and <b>inlet</b> <b>filter</b> to establish a communication channel between interrogator and transponder. Prior to commencing the test phase, an appliance is plugged into the PAT and identified automatically via cable RFID. An attempt is made to extend the scope of cable RFID by developing a novel mains power-line signalling method that uses direct-load modulation and passive transponders. Finally, two different implementations of RFID interrogator are described. The first {{takes the form of}} an embeddable module intended for incorporation into electronic identification products such as RFID enabled PAT units. Software Defined Radio (SDR) principles are applied to the second interrogator design in an effort to render the device reconfigurable. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Eleven {{instruments}} for {{the measurement of}} ambient concentrations of atmospheric ammonia gas (NH 3), based on eight different measurement methods were intercompared above an intensively managed agricultural field in late summer 2008 in Southern Scotland. To test the instruments {{over a wide range}} of concentrations, the field was fertilised with urea midway through the experiment, leading to an increase in the average concentration from 10 to 100 ppbv. The instruments deployed included three wet chemistry systems, one with offline analysis (annular rotating batch denuder, RBD) and two with online-analysis (Annular Denuder sampling with online Analysis, AMANDA; AiRRmonia), two Quantum Cascade Laser Absorption Spectrometers (a large-cell dual system; DUAL-QCLAS, and a compact system; c-QCLAS), two photo-acoustic spectrometers (WaSul-Flux; Nitrolux- 100), a Cavity Ring Down Spectrosmeter (CRDS), a Chemical Ionisation Mass Spectrometer (CIMS), an ion mobility spectrometer (IMS) and an Open-Path Fourier Transform Infra-Red (OP-FTIR) Spectrometer. The instruments were compared {{with each other and with}} the average concentration of all instruments. An overall good agreement of hourly average concentrations between the instruments (R 2 > 0. 84), was observed for NH 3 concentrations at the field of up to 120 ppbv with the slopes against the average ranging from 0. 67 (DUAL-QCLAS) to 1. 13 (AiRRmonia) with intercepts of − 0. 74 ppbv (RBD) to + 2. 69 ppbv (CIMS). More variability was found for performance for lower concentrations (< 10 ppbv). Here the main factors affecting measurement precision are (a) the inlet design, (b) the state of <b>inlet</b> <b>filters</b> (where applicable), and (c) the quality of gas-phase standards (where applicable). By reference to the fast (1 Hz) instruments deployed during the study, it was possible to characterize the response times of the slower instruments...|$|R
40|$|The {{content of}} fecal pellets of the freshly {{collected}} warm water apprendicularian #Megalocercus huxleyi$ was studied by light and electron microscopy and by flow cytometry in the superfical 100 m {{of the water}} column at 2 °N, 165 °E, in September 1994, during the Flux dans l'Ouest du Pacifique Equatorial (Joint Global Ocean Flux Study-France) oceanographic cruise. Microscopic observations showed that the fecal pellet contents of #M. huxleyi$ reflected the natural composition of the nanophytoplankton and small microphytoplankton (less than 50 micrometers). Larger cells were excluded from entering the filtering system by the <b>inlet</b> <b>filters.</b> Coccolithophorids appeared as the main component found in the feces. Evidence for ingestion of "naked" cells by this appendicularian is given. Analysis of picoplankton in fecal pellets by flow cytometer confirmed that appendicularians efficiently collect small particles. Cyanobacteria, approximately 1 micrometer in diameter, were found in large quantities and showed high fluorescence in the fecal pellets. Most of these cyanobacteria in the pellets appeared to be intact, and thus may be good indicators of the appendicularian ingestion rate. The situation was different for the prochlorophyte #Prochlorococcus$ abundant in the seawater and for picoeucaryotes (less than 2 micrometers). These were found at very low quantities in the larvacean fecal pellets. The calculations showed that with an average concentration of 5 #M. huxleyi$/m 3, more than 7 % of the small particulate matter will be daily removed from the water. Some of this matter will be assimilated, some trapped in the houses, and the rest aggregated into rapidly sinking fecal pellets. Ingestion of large quantities of coccolithophorids indicates that appendicularians are important {{not only in the}} cycle of organic carbon but also of inorganic carbon [...] .

5000|$|The Super Cub {{has been}} {{compared}} to the Ford Model T, Volkswagen Beetle and the Jeep as an icon of 20th century industry and transport. The C100 used a pressed steel monocoque chassis, with the horizontal engine placed below the central spine, a configuration now called the 'step through' or 'underbone' motorcycle. By some criteria, the type of motorcycle the Super Cub falls into is difficult to classify, landing somewhere between a scooter and a motorcycle, and sometimes it was called a moped, [...] "", or scooterette. The plastic fairing ran from below the handlebars and under the footpegs, protecting the rider's legs from wind and road debris, as well as hiding the engine from view. This design was like the full enclosure of a scooter, but unlike a scooter the engine and gearbox unit was not fixed to the rear axle. This had several benefits. It moved the engine down and away from the seat, detaching the rear swingarm motion from the drivetrain for lower unsprung weight. It also made engine cooling air flow more direct, and made it possible to fit larger wheels. Placing the engine {{in the center of the}} frame, rather than close to the rear wheel, gave it proper front-rear balance. The fuel tank was located under the hinged seat, which opened to reveal the fuel <b>filler</b> <b>inlet.</b> The 17 inch wheels, in comparison to the typical 10 inch wheels of a scooter, were more stable, particularly on rough roads, and psychologically made the motorcycle more familiar, having an appearance closer to a bicycle than a small-wheel scooter.The pushrod overhead valve (OHV) air-cooled four stroke single cylinder engine had a 40 × 39 mm bore × stroke, displacing , and could produce [...] at 9,500 rpm, for maximum speed of 43 mph, under favorable conditions. The low compression ratio meant the engine could consume inexpensive and commonly available low octane fuel, as well as minimizing the effort to kick start the engine, making the extra weight and expense of an electric starter an unnecessary creature comfort. Though some of the many Super Cub variations came with both kick and electric start, the majority sold well without it. Even the latest 2011 model year Japanese domestic market (JDM) Super Cub 50 and Super Cub 110 versions, with modern technology and conveniences like fuel injection and a fuel gauge, were not offered with an electric start option.|$|R
