5|$|Raptors, songbirds, {{and ground}} birds {{are found in}} the park's grassland, while the Puerco River's {{riparian}} corridor is a good place for year-round residents as well as migrants such as warblers, vireos, avocets, and <b>killdeer.</b> Developed areas around the visitor center and museum attract western tanagers, hermit warblers, house finches, and others. Occasional shorebirds and eastern birds also visit the park.|$|E
5|$|Waterfowl at {{the refuge}} include Canada Geese, Wood Ducks, swans, Northern Pintails, Green Herons, teal, mergansers, Belted Kingfishers, and American Wigeon among others. Birds that spend time there include, Great Blue Herons, Sandhill Cranes, Oregon Juncos, wrens, European Starlings, blackbirds, nuthatches, Pacific-slope Flycatchers, Red-tailed Hawks, American Goldfinches, Peregrine Falcons, Yellow Warblers, Western Flycatchers, <b>Killdeer,</b> Northern Harriers, Ospreys, egrets, quail, pheasants, Golden-crowned Kinglets, owls, and Black-headed Grosbeaks {{to name a}} few. There is also a pair of Bald Eagles. The year it was created {{officials}} counted 24 different bird species. By 2008 there were 185 birds species represented at the refuge.|$|E
5|$|Located in the Northern Rockies, Missoula has {{a typical}} Rocky Mountain ecology. Local {{wildlife}} includes populations of white-tailed deer, black bears, osprey, and bald eagles. During the winter, rapid snowmelt on Mount Jumbo {{due to its}} steep slope leaves grass available for grazing elk and mule deer. The rivers around Missoula provide nesting habitats for bank swallows, northern rough-winged swallows and belted kingfishers. <b>Killdeer</b> and spotted sandpipers can be seen foraging for insects along the gravel bars. Other species include song sparrows, catbirds, several species of warblers, and the pileated woodpecker. The rivers also provide cold, clean water for native fish such as westslope cutthroat trout and bull trout. The meandering streams also attract beaver and wood ducks. The parks also host a variety of snakes such as racers, garter snakes, and rubber boa.|$|E
25|$|<b>Killdeer</b> Mountain Battlefield State Historic Site marks {{part of the}} {{battlefield}} site and is protected by the State Historical Society of North Dakota. This features a sandstone slab monument, flagpole, and two headstones that honor soldiers killed in the conflict, Sergeant George Northrup, Company C, and Private Horace Austin, Company D, Brackett’s Battalion, Minnesota Cavalry. The site is located 8.5 miles northwest of <b>Killdeer,</b> North Dakota.|$|E
25|$|Shorebirds, unlike seabirds, do {{not have}} webbed feet and spend {{their lives on the}} shore {{foraging}} for food, eating worms, insect larvae, amphipods, copepods, crustaceans, and mollusks. Among the types of shorebirds on the Coast are the western and least sandpiper, dunlin, whimbrel, the semipalmated and western snowy plover, and <b>killdeer.</b>|$|E
25|$|Nearly 2,000,000 waterbirds, {{including}} 35 {{species of}} shorebirds, use Mono Lake {{to rest and}} eat for {{at least part of}} the year. Some shorebirds that depend on the resources of Mono Lake include American avocets, <b>killdeer</b> and sandpipers. Over 1.5 million eared grebes and phalaropes use Mono Lake during their long migrations.|$|E
25|$|Birds which {{prefer the}} wetland habitat include kingfishers and bank swallows. Finally {{there is an}} {{abundance}} of bird life around the wetland marshes. Many species of ducks make their summer homes in these waters and Canada geese nest in the more remote marshes. Blackbirds, marsh wrens and black terns nest in the reeds. Franklin gulls nest in the marsh vegetation, but range over agricultural fields for grasshoppers, crickets, and mice. Shore birds include: avocet, piping plover, spotted sandpiper, willet, common snipe and <b>killdeer.</b>|$|E
25|$|If {{the male}} becomes alarmed {{enough to leave}} the nest, he will attempt a {{distraction}} display. This usually involves a fake injury display, {{similar to that of}} the <b>killdeer.</b> To do this, he will hop on one leg and attempt to fly, always falling down. He will perform this display if the eggs have not hatched or the chicks are still too young to fly. It is generally believed that tinamous are not as effective at distraction displays as other birds.|$|E
25|$|The {{unofficial}} {{symbol of}} Haliburton and Muskoka is the loon, also honoured as Ontario's provincial bird. In addition to loons, other water birds {{on the lake}} include the great blue heron, the great egret, the sandhill crane, and the hooded merganser. Other water birds include {{a wide variety of}} ducks, grebes, bitterns, herons, terns, and mergansers as well as the Canada goose, the double-crested cormorant, the ring-billed and herring gull, the common sandpiper, the <b>killdeer,</b> the common snipe, the Virginia rail, the sora, the American coot, and the common moorhen.|$|E
25|$|The {{capacity}} to lie {{has also been}} claimed to be possessed by non-humans in language studies with great apes. In one instance, gorilla Koko, when asked who tore a sink from the wall, pointed {{to one of her}} handlers and then laughed. Deceptive body language, such as feints that mislead as to the intended direction of attack or flight, is observed in many species including wolves. A mother bird deceives when it pretends to have a broken wing to divert the attention of a perceived predator– including unwitting humans– from the eggs in its nest to itself, most notably the <b>killdeer.</b>|$|E
25|$|After the {{expulsion}} of the Dakota, some refugees and warriors {{made their way to}} Lakota lands. Battles between the forces of the Department of the Northwest and combined Lakota and Dakota forces continued through 1864. In the Sibley Expedition of 1863, Colonel Sibley, with 2,000 men, pursued the Sioux into Dakota Territory. Sibley's army defeated the Lakota and Dakota in four major battles: the Battle of Big Mound on July 24, 1863; the Battle of Dead Buffalo Lake on July 26, 1863; the Battle of Stony Lake on July 28, 1863; and the Battle of Whitestone Hill on September 3, 1863. The Sioux retreated further, but faced Sully's Northwest Indian Expedition in 1864. General Alfred Sully led a force from near Fort Pierre, South Dakota, and decisively defeated the Sioux at the Battle of <b>Killdeer</b> Mountain on July 28, 1864 and at the Battle of the Badlands on August 9, 1864. The following year Sully's Northwest Indian Expedition of 1865 operated against the Sioux in Dakota Territory.|$|E

2500|$|Most of the Sioux {{scattered}} {{through the}} Dakota Badlands {{to the west}} of [...] <b>Killdeer</b> Mountain, but some remained near Sully.

2500|$|<b>Killdeer</b> Mountain was at {{the edge}} of the Dakota badlands, cut up by “deep, impassable ravines” and “high rugged hills." [...] Realizing that a cavalry charge would be {{difficult}} in the broken terrain Sully dismounted his soldiers and formed them in a hollow square, one mile and a quarter (2km.) per side. [...] His horses and artillery were sheltered inside the square. He advanced on foot, as the Sioux on horseback formed up in groups on Sully’s flanks and on hilltops.|$|E
