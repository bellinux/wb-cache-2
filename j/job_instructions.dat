50|$|Nuclear {{criticality}} {{safety is}} a field of nuclear engineering dedicated to the prevention of nuclear and radiation accidents resulting from an inadvertent, self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction. Additionally, nuclear criticality safety is concerned with mitigating {{the consequences of a}} nuclear criticality accident. A nuclear criticality accident occurs from operations that involve fissile material and results in a sudden and potentially lethal release of radiation. Nuclear criticality safety practitioners attempt to prevent nuclear criticality accidents by analyzing normal and credible abnormal conditions in fissile material operations and designing safe arrangements for the processing of fissile materials. A common practice is to apply a double contingency analysis to the operation in which two or more independent, concurrent and unlikely changes in process conditions must occur before a nuclear criticality accident can occur. For example, the first change in conditions may be complete or partial flooding and the second change a re-arrangement of the fissile material. Controls (requirements) on process parameters (e.g., fissile material mass, equipment) result from this analysis. These controls, either passive (physical), active (mechanical), or administrative (human), are implemented by inherently safe or fault-tolerant plant designs, or, if such designs are not practicable, by administrative controls such as operating procedures, <b>job</b> <b>instructions</b> and other means to minimize the potential for significant process changes {{that could lead to a}} nuclear criticality accident.|$|E

A pilot study utilizing 248 subjects was conducted to examine the reliability and content validity of the instruments. The pilot study indicated that all instruments had acceptable reliability and validity estimates. ^ Two hundred and forty-seven (247) subordinates from various for-profit organizations participated in the research study by completing questionnaires evaluating their superiors. Reliability and validity checks were completed for all instruments. Multiple regression analysis indicated that the predictor variables Communicator Image, <b>Job</b> <b>Instructions</b> and Performance Feedback best predicted Perceived Supervisory Performance. The predictor variables Performance Feedback, Communicator Image, Dominance, Organizational Procedures and Practices and Dramatic best predicted Satisfaction with One 2 ̆ 7 s Supervisor.

30|$|Similarly, role {{ambiguity}} or {{a lack of}} role clarity (Shepherd and Fine 1994) means a lack {{of understanding}} about job responsibilities and knowing what is expected in terms of one’s job performance. Employees who are experiencing role ambiguity tend to have lower performance (Bhuian et al. 2005) than employees who have a complete understanding of <b>job</b> <b>instructions</b> and what are expected of them (Babin and Boles 1998; Karimi et al. 2014). Customer-oriented behaviour and, ultimately, profitability can be constrained if experiencing role ambiguity (Flaherty et al. 1999). Wetzels et al. (2000) found that role ambiguity and a commitment to delivering service quality are negatively related in a study of retail salespeople. Ambiguity is especially serious in those functional areas where managerial positions inclined to be less concrete in nature and need more abstract thinking and decision making. Such uncertainties may emerge because the anticipations describing the role are themselves ill-defined and not consistent.|$|E

To minimise quality errors and save time computerbased training virtual training {{can be used to}} practice on product knowledge, variants and sequences. Currently in traditional training in automotive industries, the operators practice on psychical products. The purpose of this bachelor thesis is to obtain knowledge of the effects of virtual training with cycle times longer than five minutes by evaluate the virtual training methods at Scania in Södertälje, Sweden. To achieve the purpose of the thesis the objective is to create a basis of the advantages and disadvantages. Scania is part of the Volkswagen Group and is a world leading supplier in the automotive industry which develops custom made and high-quality products with short lead times. Scania’s core products are heavy trucks, buses and engines for marine and industrial applications. Scania has 46 000 employees in 100 countries. Today Scania use standardised work and <b>Job</b> <b>Instructions</b> Training tools for learning the assembling processes which could be time consuming, ineffective and resource-intensive. Therefore, Scania’s vision with virtual training is to shorten the learning time on-line by implementing virtual training to practice off-line. The main objectives are to reduce the time for training simultaneously as the product quality increases. To obtain reliable information to reach the purpose a qualitative approach has been used in the study. To obtain primary data the methods have been semi-structured interviews, observation and questionnaires that have been performed and literature studies have been used to collect secondary data to obtain a broad knowledge of the subject. Through this the bachelor thesis resulted in recommendations that will contribute to Scania’s decision of future work with virtual training. The recommendations have been based on the previous accomplished studies, results and obtained comments which together were connected in the discussion and by the recommendations the authors believe that Scania can use virtual training with success. ...|$|E

40|$|A study {{conducted}} in 1995 reveals farmworkers are generally content with their jobs. Seasonal and year-round workers in orchard, vineyard, vegetable, agronomic, dairy and livestock {{operations in the}} Northern San Joaquin Valley were interviewed. Workers were generally complimentary to both supervisors and farm employers. One worker summed it up best, when {{he explained that he}} loved the job but it would be perfect if it paid better. An important implica-tion is that workers may not nec-essarily be looking for work out-side of agriculture. The 265 survey participants did, however, suggest numerous changes that supervisors and farm employers can make to improve the working conditions of agricultural labor-ers. Their suggestions included treating workers with more re-spect, constructive criticism of job performance, reasonable work pace and complete <b>job</b> <b>instructions.</b> Traditionally, agricultural work has not been held in high regard by the general population. It has been viewed as unpleasant, and an undesirable way to earn a living. Farm workers, how-ever, do not generally share this nega-tive view of farm work. For the most part, they appreciate the work and re-spect their employers. But their work-ing environment could be improved in ways that would benefit both employ-ees and employers. Many people view farm work as hard, unrewarding work; necessary, but unsatisfactory. This opinion is supported by the popular press, which often seems to speak disparagingly of farm work, such as in the award-win-ning series, ”Fields of Pain ” (Wagner and Breton 1991) that appeared in The Sacramento Bee newspaper. In addition, some think farmworkers share that opinion. However, this study con-ducted in 1995 in the Northern San Joaquin Valley reveals a more accurate picture of how farmworkers feel about their work. We interviewed 265 sea-sonal and year-round workers in or-chard, vineyard, vegetable, agronomic, dairy and livestock operations, and asked a number of questions to deter-mine their true feelings and percep-tions about their work.

40|$|The Surabaya Glory Motor {{company was}} one of {{retailers}} in sales of spare parts and agriculture engines. The consumers it targeted as end users ranged from the middle to the lower classes, who were very sensitive to price fluctuations. To win the sale competition, the company was applying a strategy of cost leadership enabling it to set prices lower than those offered by its competitors. To secure profits despite the lower prices, it had to keep the principal costs of production down as low as possible. The research used a descriptive method to describe the problems the Surabaya Glory Motor company {{had to deal with}} in the application of a manufacturing information system. The data were gathered thought interviews, study documents, and observations. The results of the analysis indicated that the system preferred so far had led to failure to keep the confirmation of delivery time agreed with buyers. Delays in obtaining confirmation of consignment dates was attributed to the lack of employees able to ensure rapid procurement of goods. Difficulty in identifying correct names of products for the compilation of a purchase order, inconsistent quality of products, frequent overstock and stockout, dualism in job descriptions lowered job satisfication among employees. Discussions {{in the course of this}} research had produced an improved design of a model of manufacturing information system suitable to support the application of the cost leadership strategy. The newly designed model was meant to help the company solve the problems it was facing. By this arrangement, data fed to the database were then queried and normalized by several stages generating a subsystem of output useful to users. The data passed into the database comprised accounting information system, industrial engineering subsystem, and manufacture Intelligence subsystem. The resultant data output consisted of subsystems of production, inventory, quality, and costs. The accounting information system consisted of letters of requests for goods, requests for purchases, purchase orders, list of purchase order numbers, and letters of return. The industrial engineering subsystem consisted of standard operational procedures, letter of <b>job</b> <b>instructions,</b> details of warehouse capacity, standards of hours per man per unit, diagram of process paces, bills of materials, coding scheme, standard criteria of evaluation, quality check sheets, and layout of production floors, Manufacturing intelligence subsystem passed into the database was made up of collections of intelligence concerning supplies, trade unions, and market surveys. Output of production subsystem comprised master production schedules, material requirement planning, letters ofjob orders, report on work results, receipts of incoming goods, and delivery schedules. The output subsystem of supplies constituted a stock card. The quality subsystem comprised packaging inspection results, quality product examination results, and quality check sheets. The cost subsystem output came out of the principal production expenses. Output of data produced by the database would reduce elements of work movement by users so that the lime needed to complete a particular task could be minimized (theory about motion and time study) and the number of employees could be reduced in addition, there would he no longer need for a large supply of essential materials (theory about just in time) as the arrival schedules of those necessities had been adjusted to the lead lime of suppliers and to the production capacity ol the company, Thus the newly designed model of manufacturing information system would prove supportive for the application by the Surabaya Glory Motor company of an improved strategy of cost leadership...|$|E
