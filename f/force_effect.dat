In {{the progress}} of this impeachment, you have seen the condition in which Mr. Hastings received Benares; you have seen the condition in which Mr. Hastings received the country of the Rohillas; you have seen the condition in which he received the country of Oude; you have seen the condition in which he received the provinces of Bengal; you have seen {{the condition of the}} country when the native government was succeeded by that of Mr. Hastings; you have seen the happiness and prosperity of all its inhabitants, from those of the highest to those of the lowest rank. My Lords, you have seen the very reverse of all this under the government of Mr. Hastings,--the country itself, all its beauty and glory, ending in a jungle for wild beasts. You have seen flourishing families reduced to implore that pity which the poorest man and the meanest situation might very well call for. You have seen whole nations in the mass reduced to a condition of the same distress. These things in his government at home. Abroad, scorn, contempt, and derision cast upon and covering the British name, war stirred up, and dishonorable treaties of peace made, by the total prostitution of British faith. Now take, my Lords, together, all the multiplied delinquencies which we have proved, from the highest degree of tyranny to the lowest degree of sharping and cheating, and then judge, my Lords, whether the House of Commons could rest for one moment, without bringing these matters, which have baffled all legislation at various times, before you, to try at last what judgment will do. Judgment is what gives <b>force,</b> <b>effect,</b> and vigor to laws; laws without judgment are contemptible and ridiculous; we had better have no laws than laws not enforced by judgments and suitable penalties upon delinquents. Revert, my Lords, to all the sentences which have heretofore been passed by this high court; look at the sentence passed upon Lord Bacon, look at the sentence passed upon Lord Macclesfield; and then compare the sentences which your ancestors have given with the delinquencies which were then before them, and you have the measure to be taken in your sentence upon the delinquent now before you. Your sentence, I say, will be measured according to that rule which ought to direct the judgment of all courts in like cases, lessening it for a lesser offence, and aggravating it for a greater, until the measure of justice is completely full.|$|E

50|$|In {{the first}} step of the mechanism, an α-proton is removed by a strong base, {{resulting}} in the formation of an enolate anion, which is made relatively stable by the delocalization of electrons. Next, the carbonyl carbon of the (other) ester is nucleophilically attacked by the enolate anion. The alkoxy group is then eliminated (resulting in (re)generation of the alkoxide), and the alkoxide removes the newly formed doubly α-proton to form a new, highly resonance-stabilized enolate anion. Aqueous acid (e.g. sulfuric acid or phosphoric acid) is added in the final step to neutralize the enolate and any base still present. The newly formed β-keto ester or β-diketone is then isolated. Note that the reaction requires a stoichiometric amount of base as the removal of the doubly α-proton thermodynamically drives the otherwise endergonic reaction. That is, Claisen condensation does not work with substrates having only one α-hydrogen because of the driving <b>force</b> <b>effect</b> of deprotonation of the β-keto ester in the last step.|$|E

40|$|This Master {{thesis is}} based on {{problems}} of <b>force</b> <b>effects</b> of the magnetic field of short-circuit current. Firstly, I analysed the force action of the three phase busbars during the three-pole short circuit. The analysis was performed in the Ansys Maxwell program and I verified the correctness of the analysis by numerical calculation. The second practical part was executed for ABB company. The main task was to analyse the <b>force</b> <b>effects</b> of the short-circuit current in the HV switchgear with focusing on the arms and contact system of the circuit breaker. The simulations of the following configurations were performed in more details: three configurations of the simplified VD 4 circuit breaker, two types of VD 4 circuit-breaker contact systems and a linear circuit breaker configuration model. The objective was to calculate the forces acting on the current path of the arms and contact system of the VD 4 circuit breaker during the three-phase short-circuit and to simulate the <b>effects</b> of <b>forces</b> on these current parts. For modelling of individual assemblies, calculations and simulations I used: SolidWorks 2014, Ansys Maxwell 16. 0 and Ansys Workbench 14. 5 programs.

These systems were imported into the Ansys Maxwell software, where the <b>force</b> <b>effects</b> of the magnetic field of the short-circuit current were calculated.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{upgraded}} review of our microscopic investigation on the single-particle properties and the EOS of isospin asymmetric nuclear matter {{within the framework}} of the Brueckner theory extended to include a microscopic three-body force. We pay special attention to the discussion of the three-body <b>force</b> <b>effect</b> and the comparison of our results with the predictions by other ab initio approaches. Three-body force is shown to be necessary for reproducing the empirical saturation properties of symmetric nuclear matter within nonrelativistic microscopic frameworks, and also for extending the hole-line expansion to a wide density range. The three-body <b>force</b> <b>effect</b> on nuclear symmetry energy is repulsive, and it leads to a significant stiffening of the density dependence of symmetry energy at supra-saturation densities. Within the Brueckner approach, the three-body force affects the nucleon s. p. potentials primarily via its rearrangement contribution which is strongly repulsive and momentum-dependent at high densities and high momenta. Both the rearrangement contribution induced by the three-body force and the effect of ground-state correlations are crucial for predicting reliably the single-particle properties within the Brueckner framework...|$|E
