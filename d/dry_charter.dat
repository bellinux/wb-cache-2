40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to address the benefits and barriers in using operations research (OR) based decision support software (DSS) {{in the evaluation of}} cargo and vessel fixtures within <b>dry</b> bulk <b>chartering.</b> The motivation for doing this research is the tramp ship routing and scheduling models and solution algorithms presented in courses at NTNU, combined with the impression that use of OR based DSS within <b>dry</b> bulk <b>chartering</b> is currently non-existing. The scope of this thesis is to describe the decisions processes in a <b>dry</b> bulk <b>chartering</b> department, to develop a set of prescriptive mathematical models of some of the decisions and apply the models on the scenarios through implementation in a commercially available optimization software. The scenarios are also implemented in the non-commercially available decision support software Turborouter. The final part of the thesis is a comparison of the mathematical models, Turborouter and the conventional decision support tools used in Torvald Klaness today. The main barrier identified in this thesis is that the existing OR based DSS is not adapted to the dynamic and uncertain nature of <b>dry</b> bulk <b>chartering.</b> The main benefit identified in this thesis, is the increased calculation capacity by applying knapsack and assignment models decision process of fixing cargo and vessels. The models need further improvement in terms of data input and output, but the scenario testing in this thesis strongly implies that it exists benefits from using OR based decision support models in the fixture process in <b>dry</b> bulk <b>chartering.</b> </p...|$|R

40|$|This paper revisits the {{hypothesis}} of a quality segmented <b>charter</b> market using <b>dry</b> bulk-Panamax time-charter rates from the shipping boom period of 2003 - 2007. Through generalized additive models (GAMs) the authors assess whether increasing awareness and regulation over time has brought about a change in charterers' perceptions. The results suggest that freight differentiation has become visible in booming markets with high freight rates. Controlling for contract specific effects such as place of delivery, charter length and number of days forward to delivery, {{as well as for}} vessel size and consumption, the paper quantifies quality related differences in physical <b>dry</b> bulk <b>charter</b> rates.

50|$|The Dry Tortugas are 70 mi west of Key West, Florida. Visiting {{the park}} by private boat is {{difficult}} because of its distance, so most visitors come by ferry, catamaran, or seaplane from Key West. Other methods of visiting the <b>Dry</b> Tortugas include <b>chartering</b> of authorized and approved private vessels. Only certain companies have access to fish or dive near the Dry Tortugas. Official ferry and transportation services to the Dry Tortugas includes the Yankee Freedom III catamaran, private vessel chartering and seaplane services.|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to explore {{shipbroker}} selection criteria of charterers in <b>dry</b> bulk voyage <b>chartering.</b> Other supportive objectives of the study were to understand the role of shipbrokers in <b>dry</b> bulk voyage <b>chartering,</b> expectations and complaints of charterers, reasons behind why charterers work via shipbrokers and to make recommendations to shipbrokers for future. Interviews were done with three shipbrokers from two dry cargo shipbroking companies and two chartering manager, one is from iron and steel while the other is from a coal trading company. Nine criteria were found out that charterers assess when selecting a broker to charter a vessel. “Trustworthiness and reputation” is the most important criterion and if the broker has a bad reputation charterers do not even consider other criteria. It was found out that “ability to find lower freight rates”, “ability to find suitable vessel in due time”, “negotiation skills“ and “service quality during post-fixture” are very important. However, lower freight rates and suitable vessel in due time were prioritized than other two. “Information and advisory services” and “cargo expertise” are regarded important criteria but not as important as preceding criteria. Finally “geographical expertise” of a broker and “communication availability” may be considered as well should previous criteria are satisfied by more than one broker. It was observed that expectation of charterers from brokers and reasons why they work with brokers depend on whether they have a professional chartering department or not. Shipbrokers offer more comprehensive services today with comparison to twenty years ago. It was also figured out that some traders with expert chartering department skip brokers and make direct business with owners. Most common complaints of charterers are deceptive brokers and brokers which do not follow-up the chartering operation and do not pay sufficient attention. Shipbrokers should understand and consider needs, expectation and dissatisfaction of charterers for surviving in the market. They must develop their network for competitive freight rates and focus on advisory services more for investment decision of charterers...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{paper is}} the first to the {{knowledge}} of the authors to apply copula models to reconstructing joint distribution of time <b>charter</b> rates for <b>dry</b> bulk ship. Based on the Clarksons dataset for the last 20 years it is claimed that Gumbel copula is enough to perform the mentioned objective. To arrive at the conclusion the homogenous dataset in terms of copula structural shifts’ absence is used; a system of criteria for copula selection based on goodness -of-forecast criteria is implemented. The evidence suggests <b>dry</b> bulk time <b>charter</b> rates weekly returns exhibit symmetric distribution. As an auxiliary output stands for the result of copula fit accounting for time dynamics and not. For the purpose of conservative analysis (i. e. risk-management) approach disregarding time-dynamics should be preferred as yielding the least number of value-at-risk breaches. From the risk budgeting perspective non-conservative approach (accounting for time dynamics) might be preferred as reflecting the rapidly changing value-at-risk...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} three {{current issues}} in maritime economics by {{the application of}} semi-parametric estimations within a generalized additive model framework. First, this thesis shows that there are vessel and contract specific differences in time <b>charter</b> rates for <b>dry</b> bulk vessels. The literature on microeconomic factors of time charter rates could show {{the emergence of a}} two-tier tanker market during the post-OPA 90 period. However, previous results do not allow for any safe conclusions about the existence of a two-tier dry bulk market. This thesis extends the results of previous research by showing that {{a good part of the}} variation in physical time charter rates is due to microeconomic factors. It empirically proves the existence of a two-tier dry-bulk market. Controlling for a variety of contract specific effects as well as vessel specific factors the presented model quantifies quality induced differences in physical <b>dry</b> bulk <b>charter</b> rates. Second, the literature on the formation of ship prices focuses exclusively on rather homogeneous shipping segments, such as tankers and dry bulk carriers. Due to the comparatively low number of sales and the complexity of the ships, vessel valuation in highly specialised and small sectors, such as chemical tankers, is a much more challenging task. The empirical results of this thesis confirm the findings in recent literature that ship valuation is a non-linear function of size, age and market conditions, whilst other parameters that are particular to the chemicals market also play a significant role. The third topic addresses the recent increase in operational expenses of merchant vessels (opex). The available literature cannot explain the development nor provides information on vessel individual level. This thesis considers a quantitative model of opex that is particularly successful in explaining the variation in opex across vessels of different type, size, age and specification. The results confirm that differences in opex are due to the behaviour of a vessel's operator and to regulatory requirements. Furthermore, it shows that there are significant differences in opex due to earnings and employment status of a vessel. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Ocean {{shipping}} of {{dry bulk}} commodities interacts {{in a market}} {{with a high degree}} of instability. According to Stopford (1997) : "Forecasting has a poor reputation in maritime circles; it is never right. " Some of the experts within the shipping theory state that <b>dry</b> bulk shipping <b>charter</b> rates are more or less unpredictable, and because of that it is extremely difficult to know when to make large investments, such as buying new ships. Are they right, or can ARIMA or ARIMAX models be able to do good forecasts of the Baltic Supramax Index (BSI) ? The BSI is a weighted average of quotations by leading broking companies around the world of trip charter rates on a number of widely traded benchmark routes. ARIMA modelling is a well-known and much-used tool for forecasting time series. In this thesis, I compare forecasts of the log of the Baltic Supramax Index using a univariate model, ARIMA(1, 1, 1); and a multivariate model, ARIMAX(1, 1, 1), with the log of the McCloskey World Steam Coal Price Index as the explanatory variable. The accuracy of the forecast of these two models did not differ significantly. The one-step ahead forecasts were quite good, but the dynamic forecast did not result in so good short-term predictions as hoped. The Baltic Supramax Index is a time series with a significant trend, especially after the dry bulk boom in 2003, and that makes the series really hard to predict. This paper can be divided into four main parts. The first part of the paper gives an introduction of the shipping market in general, Western Bulk, the dry bulk market in particular, the time series and the dry bulk boom. The second part explains the Box-Jenkins methodology and the modelling with ARIMA and ARIMAX models. The third part present the process of the model selection. The last part explains the forecasting process, followed by a comparison of the forecasts that were made from the chosen models...|$|R
