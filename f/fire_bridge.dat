5000|$|A {{number of}} {{processes}} for making wrought iron without charcoal were devised as the Industrial Revolution began {{during the latter}} half of the 18th century. The most successful of those was puddling, using a puddling furnace (a variety of the reverberatory furnace), which was invented by Henry Cort in 1784. It was later improved by others including Joseph Hall, who was the first to add iron oxide to the charge. In that type of furnace, the metal does not come into contact with the fuel, and so is not contaminated by its impurities [...] The heat of the combustion products pass over the surface of the puddle and the roof of the furnace reverberates (reflects) the heat onto the metal puddle on the <b>fire</b> <b>bridge</b> of the furnace.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. During {{lifetime}} of a bridge, {{it may be}} subjected to many hazards, in {{which one of the}} most severe hazards is fire. In recent years, due to rapid development of transportation systems, as well as increasing transport of hazardous materials, <b>bridge</b> <b>fires</b> have become a concern. <b>Bridge</b> <b>fires</b> caused by crashing of vehicles and burning of gasoline are much more severe than building fires and are characterized by a fast heating rate and a higher peak temperature which could lead to bridge collapse. Bridge failures during a fire can result in the disruption of commerce and services, and most importantly the loss of human life. This paper presents an overview of <b>bridge</b> <b>fire</b> incidents, provides a state-of–the-art review of studies on <b>bridges</b> in <b>fire,</b> and identifies the research needs in the future for protecting critical bridge structures...|$|R
