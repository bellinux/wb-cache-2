5|$|Stepbrothers Phineas and Ferb, {{along with}} their father Lawrence and sister Candace, go to an Egyptian-themed movie theater where they see a movie about two archeologists who {{discover}} an undead mummy. Phineas and Ferb are inspired {{to find their own}} mummy and go out to the basement of the theater, where there is rumored to be a mummy. Candace sees them going off to do this and follows them, hoping to <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> trouble with their father. However, as Phineas and Ferb go searching for the mummy through the basement hallways wearing archeologist hats, they run into what they believe are booby traps; they avoid the traps but Candace ends up getting hit by them all. Eventually, she becomes caught up in raggy toilet paper and cannot talk properly (due to eating stale bubble gum), which leads to the boys mistaking her for the mummy and capturing her.|$|E
25|$|During {{the end of}} the 1980s, {{with the}} decline in {{interest}} in arcade games, Funspot started deaccessioning its games. Once the museum was founded, Funspot began looking to regain those games they lost. One such lost game was the first video game to appear in Funspot, Tank II. It was installed around 1977 and sold off in the late 1980s. Another copy was acquired by the museum, {{but it is not the}} original game that used to be housed at Funspot. To reaccession games, the museum purchases some on eBay and has many donated. Often, nonworking or partial games are donated, and restoration work, sometimes years' worth, must be done to <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> working order.|$|E

At the beginning of every episode, after the titles had aired, a prerecorded segment was played in which the presenters emerged from the lift in the studio in a costume (e.g. Aeroplanes) whilst a song relating to the costume was played. Dick and Dom then {{walked back into the}} lift. The doors closed and the show then switched to live broadcast, with Dick and Dom reemerging from the lift in casual clothes and quickly starting the show.|$|E

25|$|Three {{films were}} based on the {{original}} Broadway play. The first, a silent film also called The Bat, was produced and directed by Roland West, who co-wrote the screenplay with Julien Josephson and George Marion Jr. Cornelia was played by Emily Fitzroy, and Eddie Gribbon was the Bat. West's wife, Jewel Carmen, played Dale Ogden as her last film role. West made the actors work at night to <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> the mood for the thriller. The film was released by United Artists on March 14, 1926. The year before, West had directed an adaptation of one of The Bat imitators, The Monster. Critics considered The Bat to be an improvement over that previous film; it received positive reviews and did well at the box office. The film was considered lost for decades, but a print was discovered in the 1980s.|$|E
25|$|The {{advent of}} the Second World War brought extreme {{hardship}} for the Horiuchis. They lived far enough inland {{that they were not}} subject to forced relocation, but all Japanese were immediately fired by Union Pacific and evicted from company housing. People of Japanese ancestry were often physically threatened, and denied decent work and housing. The Horiuchis were forced to live in a homemade trailer much of the time, while Paul worked various temporary, menial jobs. Unable to carry it with them, and fearing it would <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> trouble with the authorities, Horiuchi burned his collection of old Japanese books and prints; a collection of twenty-five of his best paintings, left with a friend, was destroyed in a flood. At one point, the family applied for placement in a relocation camp (a not uncommon occurrence for desperate Japanese-Americans seeking shelter and food), but were denied.|$|E
25|$|Bubble sort is {{a simple}} sorting {{algorithm}}. The algorithm starts {{at the beginning of}} the data set. It compares the first two elements, and if the first is greater than the second, it swaps them. It continues doing this for each pair of adjacent elements to the end of the data set. It then starts again with the first two elements, repeating until no swaps have occurred on the last pass. This algorithm's average time and worst-case performance is O(n2), so it is rarely used to sort large, unordered data sets. Bubble sort can be used to sort a small number of items (where its asymptotic inefficiency is not a high penalty). Bubble sort can also be used efficiently on a list of any length that is nearly sorted (that is, the elements are not significantly out of place). For example, if any number of elements are out of place by only one position (e.g. 0123546789 and 1032547698), bubble sort's exchange will <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> order on the first pass, the second pass will find all elements in order, so the sort will take only 2n time.|$|E

500|$|Clouzot {{was very}} {{demanding}} with his actors and would often quarrel {{with them to}} <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> the mood he desired. Suzy Delair recalled that Clouzot slapped her, but said of it, [...] "So what? He slapped others as well...He was tough but I'm not about to complain". Pierre Fresnay recalled that Clouzot [...] "worked relentlessly, which made for a juicy spectacle...That's to say nothing for his taste of violence, which he never tried with me". When working with Bardot, one scene required Bardot's character to drool and sleep. Clouzot offered her powerful sleeping pills, saying they were aspirin, and this led to Bardot's stomach being pumped. Although Clouzot was harsh on his actors, he did not treat them fiercely off set. Delair recalled that off set there was an [...] "innocence about him" [...] that was not seen.|$|E

Wilmore, a former writer on the television comedy The PJ's, had been asked by Scully to participate in a practical joke, in which he would play the mayor of East St. Louis and confront Selman about his controversial statement. According to Selman, Wilmore gave an [...] "Oscar-worthy performance". [...] "I was terrified", he stated in the DVD commentary for the episode, [...] " [...] a twenty-minute discussion in which [...] said that [...] children were teased at school , and that the Fox affiliate were gonna be thrown off the air..." [...] According to Wilmore, Selman immediately blamed the other writers. Said Selman, [...] "Well, everyone participates, you know [...] Have you never heard of the word 'collaboration'?" [...] Selman realized the joke when he turned around and saw [...] "all the other writers laughing". [...] "I was so relieved", he said, [...] "I was soaked with sweat [...] I had betrayed my fellow writers, tried to <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> trouble, and they all knew me for the turn-coat that I was." ...|$|E

2500|$|As an {{international}} cast was employed, actors performed {{in their native}} languages. Eastwood, Van Cleef and Wallach spoke English, and were dubbed into Italian for the debut release in Rome. For the American version, the lead acting voices were used, but supporting cast members were dubbed into English. The result is noticeable in the bad synchronization of voices to lip movements on screen; none of the dialogue is completely in sync because Leone rarely shot his scenes with synchronized sound. Various reasons have been cited for this: Leone often liked to play Morricone's music over a scene and possibly shout things at the actors to <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> the mood. Leone cared more for visuals than dialogue (his English was limited, at best). Given the technical limitations of the time, {{it would have been}} difficult to record the sound cleanly in most of the extremely wide shots Leone frequently used. Also, it was standard practice in Italian films at this time to shoot silently and post-dub. Whatever the actual reason, all dialogue in the film was recorded in post-production.|$|E
2500|$|With 76 {{still needed}} {{and only three}} wickets remaining, the odds seemed once more to have shifted against England. Lockwood scored only two, but he helped Hirst add another 27 before being dismissed: 214/8. Lilley helped Hirst to add a further 34 before he was Trumble's fourth victim of the innings and twelfth of the match: 248/9. (Darling had {{entrusted}} almost all the bowling to Saunders and Trumble; they sent down all but nine overs of the 66.5 that the innings lasted.) So Rhodes joined Hirst with 15 still needed. Legend has it that Hirst said to Rhodes, [...] "We'll <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> singles, Wilfred." [...] However Rhodes denied the story, Hirst {{said he could not}} recall what his words had been, and not every run was a single. But get the runs they did, Hirst finishing with 58 not out. He had top-scored with 43 in just 45 minutes in the first innings, as well as taking 5 wickets in Australia's first innings, so this was his match almost as much as it was Jessop's.|$|E
2500|$|After {{watching}} Michigan's 12–11 {{victory over}} Chicago in 1898, Louis Elbel, {{who was at}} the time a student in the University of Michigan School of Music, was inspired to write [...] "The Victors," [...] which was later adopted as Michigan's fight song. [...] He reportedly began composing the song at his sister's house in the Englewood section of Chicago and continued the effort on the return train ride from Chicago to Ann Arbor. [...] Elbel's lyric, [...] "Champions of the West," [...] refers to Michigan's having won the Western Conference championship {{for the first time in}} the school's history. [...] Elbel later recalled:"We were crazed with joy. [...] We paraded in the dark. We yelled and followed our U-M Band, singing to the tune of 'Hot Time in the Old Town.' It struck me quite suddenly that such an epic should be dignified by something more elevating, for this was not ordinary victory. [...] My spirits were so uplifted that I was clear off the earth, and that is when 'The Victors' was inspired. I put in a lot of 'hails' and I knew the fellows would <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> with the proper emphasis. Through them, the title suggested itself, and I dedicated it to the Michigan team of 1898." ...|$|E

2500|$|... in 1999, Bright {{received}} a tip about a bluegrass act who was performing {{at a bar}} called [...] "The Fiddle and Steel Guitar Bar" [...] in Nashville's Printer's Alley. The group consisted of Gary Vernon (stage name [...] "Gary LeVox"), Joe Don Rooney and Jay DeMarcus. After hearing them perform, Bright was impressed by their vocal blend and invited {{them to come to}} his office where they sang for him a cappella. [...] Bright signed them to a recording, publishing, and management contract, and promptly took them into the studio to record three songs. At that time the band did not have a name; so, during a performance they asked their bar patrons to suggest one. A man came up at their intermission and suggested [...] "Rascal Flatts", saying that he once had a band by that name in high school. They liked the name, and bought the rights to it on the spot for five thousand dollars using funds from their signing bonus. The agreement was written on a napkin. Bright auditioned the group for executives of Disney's Lyric Street Records who agreed on a recording contract, but Bright retained total creative control. It was a risky proposition at first, because all of the band's salaries, expenses, equipment, and pre-existing tour obligations had to be paid by Bright and his new company. [...] Bright's employees took the band members to the gym regularly to <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> better physical shape. Bright worked incredible hours and told his wife, [...] "If this flops, we'll have to sell the house". [...] The band, Rascal Flatts, became an enormous success, their first seven albums were all certified platinum or higher in record sales by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). As of 2009, [...] they had sold 18.6 million albums. When the band learned that the Fiddle and Steel Guitar Bar would be closing to make room for a new hotel, they returned to the honky tonk for a final concert in November of 2014. Band member Gary LeVox said, [...] "This stage got us on stages around the world. We're forever indebted." ...|$|E
