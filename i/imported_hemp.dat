Hemp food manufacturers such as French Meadow Bakery, Hempzels, Living Harvest, Nature's Path and Nutiva now make their products from Canadian hemp.

50|$|Irvine's harbour at Fullarton {{functioned as}} the chief port for Glasgow until the early 18th century when Port Glasgow developed, then a century later the River Clyde was deepened to take ships {{directly}} to Glasgow. Exports from Fullarton included coal, tar, lime, and chemicals, whilst <b>imports</b> included <b>hemp,</b> iron, wood from Finland and Russia, soda ash from Belgium and a special sand for the Portland Glass Factory. Industries included shipbuilding, engineering, foundries, sawmills and chemicals.Fullarton was originally a village lying outwith the Royal Burgh of Irvine, latterly it became a burgh {{in its own right}} in the Parish of Dundonald until the Irvine Burgh Act of 1881 expanded Irvine's boundaries to engulf it.|$|R
2500|$|George Washington also <b>imported</b> the Indian <b>Hemp</b> plant from Asia, {{which was}} used for fiber and, by some growers, for intoxicating resin production. In a letter to William Pearce who managed the plants for him Washington says, [...] "What {{was done with the}} Indian Hemp plant from last summer? It ought, all of it, to be sown again; that not only a stock of seed {{sufficient}} for my own purposes might have been raised, but to have disseminated seed to others; as it is more valuable than common hemp." ...|$|R

Stanford secured initial capital financing and received bank letters of credit for the import and export of shipments of hemp products to and from Asia, Europe and North America. Tree Free Eco Paper, <b>imported</b> <b>hemp</b> paper and marketed to businesses and the public via mail order.

50|$|The Free Silver {{movement}} {{arose from}} a synergy of farming and mining interests. Farmers sought to invigorate {{the economy and}} thereby end deflation, which was forcing them to repay loans with increasingly valuable dollars. Mining interests sought the right to turn silver directly into money without a central minting institution. The Sherman Silver Purchase Act of 1890, while falling short of the Free Silver movement's goals, required the U.S. government to buy millions of ounces of silver above what was required by the 1878 Bland-Allison Act (driving {{up the price of}} silver and pleasing silver miners). People attempted to redeem silver notes for gold. Ultimately, the statutory limit for the minimum amount of gold in federal reserves was reached and U.S. notes could no longer be successfully redeemed for gold. Investments {{during the time of the}} panic were heavily financed through bond issues with high interest payments. Rumors regarding the National Cordage Company's financial distress (NCC was the most actively traded stock at the time) caused its lenders to call in their loans immediately, and NCC went into bankruptcy receivership as a result. The company, a rope manufacturer, had tried to corner the market for <b>imported</b> <b>hemp.</b> As demand for silver and silver notes fell, the price and value of silver dropped. Holders worried about a loss of face value of bonds, and many became worthless.|$|E
50|$|After launching, work {{continued}} on finishing the upper deck, the sterncastle, the beakhead and the rigging. Sweden had still not developed a sizeable sailcloth industry, and material {{had to be}} ordered from abroad. In the contract {{for the maintenance of}} rigging, French sailcloth was specified, but the cloth for the sails of Vasa most likely came from Holland. The sails were made mostly of hemp and partly of flax. The rigging was made entirely of <b>hemp</b> <b>imported</b> from Latvia through Riga. The king visited the shipyard in January 1628 and made what was probably his only visit aboard the ship.|$|R
50|$|By {{the turn}} of the century, the St Helena {{establishment}} had grown to accommodate over 300 prisoners in a maze of buildings surrounded by a high stockade wall. It operated as a self-sufficient settlement, and even exported some of its produce to the mainland, including bricks for many of Brisbane's buildings, clothes to be sold in Brisbane, and white rope for ships, which was made from <b>imported</b> Sisal <b>Hemp</b> plants. In the island workshops the prisoners were taught such trades as carpentry, boot making, tailoring, tinsmith, saddle making, bread baking and butchery. The island boasted a prize dairy herd which won many awards at the Brisbane Exhibitions. The island was extensively farmed, particularly in the later years as a prison. Maize, potatoes, lucerne and other vegetables thrived in the rich volcanic soil and the sugar mill crushed over 75 tons of locally grown sugar annually by 1880. In many ways, St Helena was regarded as a model prison for the times, and held in high regard by visiting interstate and overseas penologists.|$|R
5000|$|Memel {{became part}} of the {{province}} of East Prussia within the Kingdom of Prussia in 1773. In {{the second half of the}} 18th century Memel's lax customs and Riga's high duties enticed English traders, who established the first industrial sawmills in the town. In 1784, 996 ships arrived in Memel, 500 of which were English. (In 1900 there was still an active English church in Memel, as well as a [...] "British Hotel"). The specialisation in wood manufacturing guaranteed Memel's merchants income and stability for more than a hundred years. During this era it also normalised its trade relations with Königsberg; regional instability had degraded relations since the 16th century.Memel prospered during the second half of the 18th century by exporting timber to Great Britain for use by the Royal Navy. In 1792, 756 British ships visited the town to transport lumber from the Lithuanian forests near Memel. In 1800 its imports consisted chiefly of salt, iron and herrings; the exports, which greatly exceeded the <b>imports,</b> were corn, <b>hemp,</b> flax, and, particularly, timber. The 1815 Encyclopædia Britannica stated that Memel was [...] "provided with the finest harbour in the Baltic".|$|R
40|$|The Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s {{decisions}} delineating {{the constitutional}} limitations on state tax power have often defied rational analysis. The Court read the commerce clause as forbidding a state {{tax on the}} privilege of doing interstate business {{but not on the}} privilege of doing interstate business in corporate form. It construed the import-export clause as prohibiting a state tax on bales of <b>imported</b> <b>hemp</b> awaiting use in manufacturing but not on piles of imported ore and plywood awaiting such use. It interpreted the supremacy clause as barring a state tax upon the sale of goods to one government contractor but not to another because the second was not deemed to be a purchasing agent for the federal government, even though in both instances the federal government bore the economic burden of the tax and ultimately took title to the goods. Indeed, the Court itself came to recognize that consistency was not the hallmark of its pronouncements in this field, that form occasionally prevailed over substance, and that 2 ̆ 2 [t]o attempt to harmonize all that has been said in the past would neither clarify what has gone before nor guide the future. 2 ̆ 2 In light of the difficulties in generalizing about the Court 2 ̆ 7 s precedents regarding particular constitutional limitations on state tax power, generalizations embracing decisions directed to several separate limitations are especially suspect since they aggravate the danger of oversimplifying problems that have been resolved for years on the basis of razor-thin factual distinctions and ephemeral doctrinal nuances. Nevertheless, with due regard for the hazards of speculation in this area, there are grounds for suggesting that the Court is moving toward a more systematic approach to interpretation of those constitutional inhibitions on state taxation that, broadly speaking, bear on the allocation of powers between state and national governments in our federal system. The evidence for this hypothesis - several recent decisions handed down by the Court over a relatively brief period-is admittedly fragmentary, but it is sufficient to warrant a preliminary inquiry and some tentative conclusions. The first section of this Article examines three recent cases, each addressed to a different constitutional limitation on the scope of state tax power, that may be read as signifying a new approach: Michelin Tire Corp. v. Wages, which concerned the import-export clause; United States v. County of Fresno, which concerned the supremacy clause; and Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, which concerned the commerce clause. Section II considers the implications of these decisions and explores the possibility that they share an underlying doctrinal unity...|$|E
