5|$|Elisabeth and her Spanish entourage {{had arrived}} at the Bidasoa river on the Spanish border with a huge escort of French Catholic nobles on 14 June 1565. She then rode into Saint-Jean de Luz, where Catherine <b>greeted</b> <b>her</b> tearfully with embraces and kisses. During the {{reception}} ceremonies, ten of Catherine’s soldiers dropped dead from standing too long in the heat in their armour. The next day, Elisabeth made a dazzling entry into Bayonne on a horse whose harness was studded with gems worth 400,000 ducats.|$|E
5|$|The saloon keepers, who {{received}} word that Hobbs {{was accompanied by}} law enforcement officers only shortly before her arrival, <b>greeted</b> <b>her</b> by dressing up the town with bunting, blue and pink ribbons, and flowers. A town meeting was arranged at 2:30 p.m. on January 3. Hobbs renewed the call for the resignation of city officials, but the request was refused. Hobbs' escorts then arrested the city leaders and ordered Lawson to declare martial law. It {{was the first time}} in Oregon since the Civil War that martial law was put into effect.|$|E
5|$|Louise {{spent her}} last years at Kensington Palace, occupying rooms {{next to her}} sister Princess Beatrice. She made {{occasional}} public appearances with the royal family, such as at the Cenotaph at Whitehall on 11 November 1925. However, her health deteriorated. In 1935, she <b>greeted</b> <b>her</b> nephew, King George V, and his wife, Queen Mary, at Kensington Town Hall during their Silver Jubilee celebrations, and was made an Honorary Freeman of the Borough of Kensington. Her last public appearance occurred in 1937, at the Home Arts and Industries Exhibition. Between these occasions, her great nephew, King Edward VIII, abdicated on 11 December 1936. In December 1936, Louise wrote to the British prime minister, Stanley Baldwin, sympathising with him about the crisis.|$|E

Urrea and her father applied for United States citizenship soon afterward, although no record exists that either of them were granted it. Urrea spent the next three years living in a small community near Nogales where she resumed her folk healing.|$|E
25|$|As the {{hurricane}} lessened and the seas became a little calmer, {{the crew was}} able to get a sail under Centaur, and use her hawsers to lash it to her, much reducing the leaks and bracing her shattered frame. To help keep Centaur afloat, the crew also threw all but a dozen or so guns overboard. The 74-gun third rate HMS Eagle was then able to tow Centaur into Halifax. There Commissioner John Inglefield, who had been captain of the previous Centaur when she foundered after the Atlantic hurricane of 16–17 September 1782, <b>greeted</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
25|$|Now {{that the}} summer is over, the Türr Family has left {{and are not}} {{expected}} back until next spring. They carry with them the esteem and affection of the townspeople, {{who have come to}} appreciate their rare qualities. Before her departure, Mrs. Adelina Türr insisted upon visiting the orphanages, where the children <b>greeted</b> <b>her</b> with a most abundant dose of confetti. It was wonderful to see this scion of one of the greatest and most powerful families of Europe caress and kiss the sons of our labourers, and make the effort of conversing with them in their Pallanzese dialect.|$|E

500|$|There {{are three}} {{witnesses}} who provide direct evidence supporting {{the idea that}} Park was innocent. The first, a neighbour, claims that they saw Carol {{at the bottom of}} her driveway. A second, another neighbour, claims that they saw an unidentified man in a Volkswagen Beetle in the Parks' drive for twenty minutes. The presence of the unidentified car has never been accounted for. Around 6pm that night, another witness, a woman who knew Carol, saw her at Charnock Richard services. She had mentioned to her husband the fact that Carol had not <b>greeted</b> <b>her,</b> describing her as [...] "snobby".|$|E
500|$|Despite this {{positive}} publicity, {{the jury}} was persuaded by Jacobs' testimony and frightened by Goldman's politics. The assistant District Attorney questioned Goldman about her anarchism, {{as well as her}} atheism; the judge spoke of her as [...] "a dangerous woman". She was sentenced to one year in the Blackwell's Island Penitentiary. Once inside she suffered an attack of rheumatism and was sent to the infirmary; there she befriended a visiting doctor and began studying medicine. She also read dozens of books, including works by the American activist-writers Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau; novelist Nathaniel Hawthorne; poet Walt Whitman, and philosopher John Stuart Mill. When Goldman was released after ten months, a raucous crowd of nearly 3,000 people <b>greeted</b> <b>her</b> at the Thalia Theater in New York City. She soon became swamped with requests for interviews and lectures.|$|E
500|$|Shannon, {{commanded}} by Lieutenant Provo Wallis, escorted her prize into Halifax, arriving there on 6 June. On {{the entry of}} the two frigates into the harbour, the naval ships already at anchor manned their yards, bands played martial music and each ship Shannon passed <b>greeted</b> <b>her</b> with cheers. The 320 American survivors of the battle were interned on Melville Island in 1813, and their ship, taken into British service and renamed HMS Chesapeake, was used to ferry prisoners from Melville Island to England's Dartmoor Prison. Many officers were paroled to Halifax, but some began a riot at a performance of a patriotic song about Chesapeakes defeat. Parole restrictions were tightened: beginning in 1814, paroled officers were required to attend a monthly muster on Melville Island, and those who violated their parole were confined to the prison.|$|E

She is never going to be friends with her {{assistant}}." [...] A former assistant said, [...] "You definitely did not ride the elevator with her." [...] Unwritten rules imposed by Wintour at the Vogue offices forbid junior staff from initiating conversation with her; an editor who <b>greeted</b> <b>her</b> on the elevator was reprimanded by one of Wintour's assistants. (She calls that an exaggeration.) A visiting reporter saw a junior staff member appear visibly panicked when she realised she would have to be in the elevator with Wintour. Once a junior editor saw her trip in the hallway, walked past without offering assistance, and was later told she [...] "did absolutely the right thing." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1527, the Medici were overthrown in Florence by a faction {{opposed to}} the regime of Clement's representative, Cardinal Silvio Passerini, and Catherine was taken hostage {{and placed in a}} series of convents. The final one, the Santissima Annuziata delle Murate was her home for three years. Mark Strage {{described}} these years as [...] "the happiest of her entire life". Clement {{had no choice but to}} crown Charles Holy Roman Emperor in return for his help in retaking the city. In October 1529, Charles's troops laid siege to Florence. As the siege dragged on, voices called for Catherine to be killed and exposed naked and chained to the city walls. Some even suggested that she be handed over to the troops to be used for their sexual gratification. The city finally surrendered on 12 August 1530. Clement summoned Catherine from her beloved convent to join him in Rome where he <b>greeted</b> <b>her</b> with open arms and tears in his eyes. Then he set about the business of finding her a husband.|$|E
500|$|Maria Amélia and her mother, who had {{accompanied}} her, disembarked on 31 August in Funchal, {{the capital of}} Madeira. The entire town <b>greeted</b> <b>her</b> joyfully, and a crowd followed the princess to her new home. She adored the island and told her mother: [...] "If I one day recover my previous robust health, isn't that so mommy, we will stay {{a long time in}} this island. We will make long excursions in the mountains, we will find new paths, just as we did in Stein!" [...] But her health worsened, {{and by the end of}} November, all hope was gone. By the beginning of 1853, the princess was bedridden, and she knew death was approaching: [...] "My strength diminishes from day to day; I can feel it... we are reaching the beginning of the end." [...] A little after midnight in the early hours of 4 February, a priest administered the last rites. Maria Amélia tried to comfort her mother: [...] "Do not cry... let God's will be done; may He come to my aid in my last hour; may He console my poor mother!" [...] She died later that morning at around 04:00.|$|E

500|$|DreamWorks {{announced}} Burton's {{appointment in}} August 2006, and Johnny Depp was cast as Todd. Christopher Lee, Peter Bowles, Anthony Head, {{and five other}} actors were set to play the ghost narrators, but their roles were cut (Head does appear in an uncredited cameo as a gentleman who congratulates Depp after the shaving contest). According to Lee, these deletions were due to time constraints caused by a break in filming during March 2007, while Depp's daughter recovered from an illness. Burton's domestic partner Helena Bonham Carter was cast in October 2006, as well as Sacha Baron Cohen. In December 2006, Alan Rickman was cast. In January 2007, Laura Michelle Kelly was cast as Lucy Barker. Timothy Spall {{was added to the}} cast, and said he was urged to audition by his daughter, who wanted him to work with Depp. He recalled, [...] "I really wanted this one – I knew Tim was directing and that Johnny Depp {{was going to be in}} it. My daughter, my youngest daughter, really wanted me to do it for that reason – Johnny Depp was in it. (She came on set to meet Depp) and he was really delightful to her, she had a great time. Then, I took her to the junket – and (Depp) <b>greeted</b> <b>her</b> like an old pal when he saw her. I've got plenty of brownie points at the moment." ...|$|E
500|$|Uncle Tom's Cabin {{was clearly}} Stowe's magnum opus (although she {{considered}} Old Town Folks, {{which was written}} {{while she was in}} Mandarin, to have that designation), as Stowe family history recalls that Abraham Lincoln entertained the author during a visit to the White House, and <b>greeted</b> <b>her</b> by saying [...] "So this is the little lady who made this big war?" [...] Compared to it, Palmetto Leaves is considered a minor work and is rarely included in the canon of criticism about Stowe's writings. The Cambridge Introduction to Literature series on Stowe addresses it briefly, however, noting that the mixed essay and letter format make it [...] "uneven in quality and unstable in stance". More assertive criticism was directed toward Stowe's portrayals of the local Mandarin blacks. Cambridge Introduction to Literature author Sarah Robbins called it [...] "downright offensive" [...] and declared that Stowe negated her own attempts to persuade her readers that emancipated slaves were industrious and could assist in rebuilding the South of their own volition by including unflattering descriptions of their physical features—comparing Old Cudjo to a baboon, for example—and writing that supervising and taking care of them was necessary. Susan Eacker agrees, writing that Stowe's views were representative of the majority of white Americans' ideas of where blacks should be in the social scheme of the New South.|$|E
500|$|On January 31, 2010, Pink {{performed}} the song at the 52nd Grammy Awards {{in a similar}} fashion. She began the performance walking out in a white silk robe, {{standing in front of}} a backdrop of electric blue screens. She descenced into the aisle and took off the robe to reveal the bodysuit. After being lifted from the tank of water, Pink kept twirling and spreading water into all directions, before finally descending to the main stage. The audience <b>greeted</b> <b>her</b> with a standing ovation. The performance was deemed by various media outlets as the best of the ceremony. Glenn Gamboa of Newsday commented, [...] "With her stunning Grammy performance of 'Glitter in the Air,' Pink proved that you don’t have to be shocking or over-the-top to be the best or the most-talked-about. You just have to be amazing." [...] It was also voted on a readers' poll in MTV.com as the best performance of the night. Staff reporter Kyle Anderson said [...] "It's easy to see why, as her acrobatic performance of 'Glitter in the Air' was not only visually gorgeous, but also technically impressive — she was able to keep singing even as she was spinning around in the air". Pink later explained she had almost fallen during the song, saying, [...] "When I do it on tour, I don't have lights above me. There were lights above me, so it almost went into a strobe thing, and I actually did get a little turned around. I thought... I was going to fall on my nude butt. But I worked it out." [...] In 2013, Brad Wete for Billboard ranked the performance as the best performance at the Grammy Awards from 2000 to 2012, commenting it [...] "graceful, show-stopping performance of aerial, acrobatic and vocal brilliance." ...|$|E

She was the first Iranian and the first Muslim woman to receive the prize, and thousands <b>greeted</b> <b>her</b> at the airport when she returned from Paris after receiving the news that she had won the prize.
