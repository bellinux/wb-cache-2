5000|$|While {{there is}} {{a vast array of}} bird feeders, feeders are {{typically}} placed into three categories: tube, hopper, and platform. [...] Tube feeders are long and slender and are typically constructed of plastic. <b>Hopper</b> <b>feeders</b> resemble small houses, and are made of a combination of metal, wood, and plastic. Platform feeders are large trays that are often covered and are typically made of wood or plastic.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The work aims at the {{optimization}} of {{the output}} feed rate of a Stationary Hook <b>Hopper</b> <b>Feeder</b> {{so that the}} best possible set of parameters affecting it can be selected to get the desired output. For this purpose the effect of various parameters on the feeder output is studied. To facilitate the study and detailed analysis, a statistical model is constructed {{which is used to}} predict and optimize the performance of the system. Efficient feed rate optimization determines the input variable settings to adjust the feed rate of the feeder according to the consumption of the parts in the next phase of production. The Stationary Hook <b>Hopper</b> <b>Feeder,</b> whose performance is to be studied, consists of a rotating circular plate and a guiding hook fixed at the centre and running up to the periphery of the plate. As the plate rotates, the parts follow the trajectory of the hook, orient themselves and then eventually are delivered through the delivery chute, tangentially to the plate. The factors influencing the feeder’s performance include the speed of rotation of the disc, the population of the parts in the hopper and the size of parts to be fed. A series of experiments is performed on the three process parameters to investigate their effect on the feed rate. To study the interaction among the factors a full 23 factorial experiment approach has been adopted using the two basic principles of experimental design- replication and randomization. The process model was formulated based on Analysis of variance (ANOVA) using Minitab ® statistical package. The outcome is represented graphically and in the form of empirical model which defines the performance characteristics of the Stationary Hook <b>Hopper</b> <b>Feeder...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Choosing a bird feeder {{is just as}} {{important}} as choosing the bird seed to offer. For those wanting to attract large amounts of small songbirds, a tube feeder is best. [...] <b>Hopper</b> <b>feeders</b> attract a wide variety of species, and allow for large quantities of bird seed to be stored. Platform feeders attract the greatest number of bird species, but the bird seed is more prone to getting wet or blown off the feeder from the wind.|$|R
40|$|A wedged plane-flow hopper and {{horizontal}} belt feeder is employed {{to investigate the}} flow patterns and stress field redistribution at the <b>hopper</b> and <b>feeder</b> interface. The flow patterns are recorded by a high speed camera in conjunction with coloured material layers. The three-dimensional stress field in the feed zone and its influence on the feeder operation are discussed. The vertical stresses acting on the feeder for initial filling and flow conditions are measured along with longitudinal shear feeder loads. The experimental results are compared with theoretical values derived using relevant feeder load theories. The influences of different filling heights and clearance between the <b>hopper</b> bottom and <b>feeder</b> surface on feeder loads are presented. Numerical simulations using the Discrete Element Method (DEM) are carried out additionally to analyse <b>feeder</b> loads at <b>hopper</b> and <b>feeder</b> interface, the results being compared with those obtained experimentally...|$|R

Therefore, the phonon confinement can be detected by electron transport measurements. ...|$|R
