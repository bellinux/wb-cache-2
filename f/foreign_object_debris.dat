25|$|On November 9, 2010, Boeing 787, ZA002 made an {{emergency}} landing at Laredo International Airport, Texas, after smoke and flames were detected in the main cabin during a test flight. The electrical fire caused some systems to fail before landing. Following this incident, Boeing suspended flight testing on November 10, 2010, ground testing continued. After investigation, the in-flight fire was primarily attributed to <b>foreign</b> <b>object</b> <b>debris</b> (FOD) that was present in the electrical bay. After electrical system and software changes, the 787 resumed flight testing on December 23, 2010.|$|E
25|$|The two 117 engines {{incorporate}} thrust vectoring (TVC) nozzles whose rotational axes {{are each}} canted at an angle, {{similar to the}} nozzle arrangement of the Su-35S. This configuration allows the aircraft to produce thrust vectoring moments about all three rotational axes, pitch, yaw and roll. Thrust vectoring nozzles themselves operate in only one plane; the canting allows the aircraft to produce both roll and yaw by vectoring each engine nozzle differently. The engine inlet incorporates variable intake ramps for increased supersonic efficiency and retractable mesh screens to prevent <b>foreign</b> <b>object</b> <b>debris</b> being ingested that would cause engine damage. The 117 engine is to also incorporate infrared and RCS reduction measures. In 2014, the Indian Air Force openly expressed concerns over the reliability and performance of the 117 engines; during the 2011 Moscow Air Show, a T-50 suffered a compressor stall that forced the aircraft to abort takeoff.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Time-varying land clutter is primary {{interference}} for <b>Foreign</b> <b>Objects</b> <b>Debris</b> (FOD) detection on airport runways. Traditional clutter-map CFAR (CM-CFAR) algorithms were ineffect-ive {{to detect}} targets in non-Gaussian clutter. In this paper, a Bi-parametric CM-CFAR (Bi-CM-CFAR) algorithm based on bi-parameters estimation is proposed. Clutter-level estimation is obtained with video integrator, parameters estimator and recursive filter; and updated in each scanning period. Moreover, simulations verify {{effectiveness of this}} method for FOD detection. ...|$|R

FOD refers to any type of <b>foreign</b> <b>object,</b> particle, <b>debris</b> or agent in the manufacturing environment, which could contaminate/damage the product or otherwise undermine quality standards. Nowadays, FOD is currently addressed with prevention programs, elimination techniques, and designation of FOD areas, controlled access to FOD areas, restrictions of personal items entering designated areas, tool accountability, etc. All of the efforts mentioned before, have not shown {{a significant reduction in}} FOD occurrence in the manufacturing processes. This research presents a Decision Making Model approach based on a logistic regression predictive model that was previously made by other researchers.

40|$|<b>Foreign</b> <b>Object</b> Debris/Damage (FOD) is {{a costly}} and high-risk problem that {{aeronautics}} {{industries such as}} Boeing, Lockheed Martin, among others are facing at their production lines every day. They {{spend an average of}} 350 thousand dollars per year fixing FOD problems. FOD can put pilots, passengers and other crews 2 ̆ 7 lives into high-risk. FOD refers to any type of <b>foreign</b> <b>object,</b> particle, <b>debris</b> or agent in the manufacturing environment, which could contaminate/damage the product or otherwise undermine quality control standards. FOD can be in the form of any of the following categories: panstock, manufacturing debris, tools/shop aids, consumables and trash. Although aeronautics industries have put many prevention plans in place such as housekeeping and 2 ̆ 2 clean as you go 2 ̆ 2 philosophies, trainings, use of RFID for tooling control, etc. none of them has been able to completely eradicate the problem. This research presents a logistic regression statistical model approach to predict probability of FOD type under given specific circumstances such as workstation, month and aircraft/jet being built. FOD Quality Assurance Reports of the last three years were provided by an aeronautical industry for this study. By predicting type of FOD, custom reduction/elimination plans can be put in place and by such means being able to diminish the problem. Different aircrafts were analyzed and so different models developed through same methodology. Results of the study presented are predictions of FOD type for each aircraft and workstation throughout the year, which were obtained by applying proposed logistic regression models. This research would help aeronautic industries to address the FOD problem correctly, to be able to identify root causes and establish actual reduction/elimination plans. ...|$|R
40|$|For many years, {{the safety}} {{community}} {{has focused on}} a limited subset of materials and processes requirements as key to safety: Materials flammability, Toxic offgassing, Propellant compatibility, Oxygen compatibility, and Stress-corrosion cracking. All these items are important, but the exclusive focus on these items neglects many other items that are equally important to materials safety. Examples include (but are not limited to) : 1. Materials process control [...] proper qualification and execution of manufacturing processes such as structural adhesive bonding, welding, and forging are crucial to materials safety. Limitation of discussions on materials process control to an arbitrary subset of processes, known as "critical processes" is a mistake, because any process where {{the quality of the}} product cannot be verified by inspection can potentially result in unsafe hardware 2 Materials structural design allowables [...] development of valid design allowables when none exist in the literature requires extensive testing of multiple lots of materials and is extremely expensive. But, without valid allowables, structural analysis cannot verify structural safety 3. Corrosion control [...] All forms of corrosion, not just stress corrosion, can affect structural integrity of hardware 4. Contamination control during ground processing [...] contamination control is critical to manufacturing processes such as adhesive bonding and also to elimination <b>foreign</b> <b>objects</b> and <b>debris</b> (FOD) that are hazardous to the crew of manned spacecraft in microgravity environments. 5. Fasteners [...] Fastener design, the use of verifiable secondary locking features, and proper verification of fastener torque are essential for proper structural performance This presentation discusses some of these key factors and the importance of considering them in ensuring the safety of space hardware...|$|R

40|$|The sub-terahertz (THz) {{frequency}} band {{has proved to}} be a noteworthy option for nondestructive testing (NDT) of nonmetal aeronautics materials. Composite structures or laminates can be inspected for <b>foreign</b> <b>objects</b> (water or <b>debris),</b> delaminations, debonds, etc., using sub-THz sensors during the manufacturing process or maintenance. Given the harmless radiation to the human body of this {{frequency band}}, no special security measures are needed for operation. Moreover, the frequency-modulated continuous-wave sensor used in this study offers a very light, compact, inexpensive, and high-performing solution. An automated two-dimensional scanner carrying three sensors partially covering the 70 - to 320 -GHz band is operated, using two complementary measurement approaches: conventional focused imaging, where focusing lenses are used; and synthetic aperture (SA) or unfocused wide-beam imaging, for which lenses are no longer needed. Conventional focused imagery offers finer spatial resolutions but imagery is depth-limited due to the beam waist effect, whereas SA measurements allow imaging of thicker samples with depth-independent but coarser spatial resolutions. The present work is a compendium of a much larger study and describes the key technical aspects of the proposed imaging techniques and reports on results obtained from human-made samples (A-sandwich, C-sandwich, solid laminates) which include diverse defects and damages typically encountered in aeronautics multilayered structures. We conclude with a grading of the achieved results in comparison with measurements performed by other NDT techniques on the same samples...|$|R
40|$|The {{greening}} {{of transport}} has been highlighted in the Paris Agreement {{in order to}} participate to a durable development of our society. One of the main ways to fulfil environmental requirements is to reduce of the total energy consumption throughout the whole life of vehicles: that is during their manufacturing, during their utilisation, and during their end-of-life management. A new generation of engines named counter-rotating open rotor (CROR) {{is one of the}} technical candidates that are currently investigated, since they could lead to a significant reduction of the energy consumption of civil aircrafts. With the exception of two rows of larger unducted blades, the components of CROR-engines {{are similar to those of}} conventional engines. Aircraft configurations with CROR-engines are extremely challenging, since the unducted blades can be hit by <b>foreign</b> <b>objects</b> (hail, <b>debris)</b> or wild life (large bird) at high impact velocities. A further threat is the release of a large unducted blade that could impact the aircraft primary structures like the fuselage, the wings, or the vertical tail. The Institute of Structures and Design of the German Aerospace Centre is therefore contributing to the development of a validated simulation methodology to assess the behaviour of a fuselage under the impact of a composite CROR-blade. In order to investigate this topic, different tasks were successfully performed: determination of a low readiness level high velocity impact test matrix, manufacturing of coupons, quasi-static material characterisation, material card developments, connection of different commercial software to build a simulation process chain (from computer assisted design over pre-processing up to numerical simulations and analysis of results), validation of selected low readiness level impact test simulations, and utilisation of the tool chain to demonstrate the feasibility of damage assessment in composite structures after high velocity impact. The present contribution is part of the Clean Sky 2 project (LPA) and aims to show the state of the investigations conducted at the Institute of Structures and Design.
