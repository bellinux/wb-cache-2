5|$|It {{originally}} {{started as}} a massive loop around the Chicago area, however it has retained its current, much shorter route ever since 1937. During the 1990s, it {{became the subject of}} much concern for local residents regarding expansion which slowed down any progress for capacity improvement. By the late 2000s, the delays <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>gone</b> and it has emerged as a state route that has been largely modernized to deal with heavy traffic.|$|E
5|$|Aang {{proposes a}} beach party {{in lieu of}} training, {{explaining}} that he has decided to challenge Fire Lord Ozai only after Sozin's Comet and its enhancement of firebending <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>gone,</b> due to his self-perceived inability to fight the Fire Lord on equal footing. When Zuko tells the group that Ozai {{plans to use the}} comet's power to burn down the Earth Kingdom and Water Tribes, Aang resolves to face him before the comet arrives. Sokka decides to have a simulation fight against a scarecrow, but Aang refuses to kill it due to his pacifistic nature and non-violent upbringing, and even berates his friends after they tell pointedly him that he {{has no choice but to}} kill Ozai.|$|E

25|$|A deep slump {{followed}} the successful international period of 2002–03.

25|$|A {{number of}} the {{earliest}} streets in Dorchester have changed names several times through the centuries, meaning that some names <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>gone.</b> Leavitt Place, for instance, named for one of Dorchester's earliest settlers, eventually became Brook Court and then Brook Avenue Place. Gallivan Boulevard was once Codman Street and Brookvale Street was once Brook Street. Morrissey Boulevard was once Old Colony Parkway.|$|E

25|$|The {{seeds of}} AMM were planted in 1965. They {{initially}} had no name, {{and were not}} really a group in the conventional sense, simply a weekend experimental workshop session at the Royal College of Art in London, centred on Gare, Rowe, and Prévost. Members of the group <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>gone</b> over the years, but Rowe and Prévost have been present for most recordings and performances; the latter {{has been the only}} constant in the nearly four decades of AMM music.|$|E
25|$|Millions {{of dollars}} were spent {{replacing}} the old terminal, which hosted a half-dozen airlines before its demolition. In the mid 1980s and early 1990s, major carriers, such as Piedmont, Northwest Airlines, Continental, and USAir all flew mainline jets into Worcester. In addition, smaller carriers, like New York Air and Presidential Airways also had jet service. The small terminal had two ground level jetways built {{to accommodate the}} growth. But one by one, those carriers left. A succession of second-tier air carriers <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>gone</b> over the last decade.|$|E
25|$|The city of Allentown, Pennsylvania was {{established}} in 1762 {{and is one of}} the oldest major cities in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the United States. It has deep roots in the history of the nation, being the hiding place of the Liberty Bell during the American Revolution, and its oldest city cemetery has graves of soldiers who served in the Continental Army. Over its 250-year history of the city numerous buildings, bridges, parks and other locations in the city <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>gone,</b> but many remain, with no less than thirteen of them being on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E

25|$|Some schools <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>gone,</b> {{and some}} have offshoots (such as the Mei'an school, a Zhucheng school offshoot). Often, the school is {{originated}} from a single person, such as the Wu school which is named after the late Wu Zhaoji. The style can vary considerably between schools; some are very similar, yet others are very distinct. The differences are often in interpretation of the music. Northern schools {{tend to be more}} vigorous in technique than Southern schools. But in modern terms, the distinction between schools and styles is often blurred because a single player may learn from many different players from different schools and absorb each of their styles. This is especially so for conservatory trained players. People from the same school trained under the same master may have different individual styles (such as Zhang Ziqian and Liu Shaochun of the Guangling school).|$|E
25|$|Often, {{archaeology}} {{provides the}} only means to learn of the existence and behaviors of people of the past. Across the millennia many thousands of cultures and societies and billions of people <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>gone</b> of which {{there is little or}} no written record or existing records are misrepresentative or incomplete. Writing as it is known today did not exist in human civilization until the 4th millennium BC, in a relatively small number of technologically advanced civilizations. In contrast, Homo sapiens has existed for at least 200,000 years, and other species of Homo for millions of years (see Human evolution). These civilizations are, not coincidentally, the best-known; they are open to the inquiry of historians for centuries, while the study of pre-historic cultures has arisen only recently. Even within a literate civilization many events and important human practices are not officially recorded. Any knowledge of the early years of human civilization – the development of agriculture, cult practices of folk religion, the rise of the first cities – must come from archaeology.|$|E

Current annual cultural events in Lincoln include the Lincoln National Guard Marathon and Half-Marathon in May, Celebrate Lincoln in early June, the Uncle Sam Jam around July 3, and Boo at the Zoo in October. A locally popular event is the Haymarket Farmers' Market, running from May to October in the Historic Haymarket, {{one of several}} farmers markets throughout the city.|$|E
500|$|The novel {{begins by}} recounting {{the time that}} has passed since the First World War: generations <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>gone,</b> and {{technology}} continues to advance and spread from Europe and America {{over the rest of}} the world. Overpopulation has become a problem, and the leaders of industry have seized state power. Pacified by the improvement in material conditions, the masses of the cities raise no objection. At {{the same time that it}} sees radical technological innovations, Europe suffers declining birth rates and experiences waves of mass migration from Africa. In an effort to maintain their rule, the ruling Senates of Europe agree to restrict the public's access to science and technology. London is the leading power in the west, and [...] "India-Japan-China" [...] is the other world power.|$|E
500|$|On the season's {{potential}} for crossover {{with the rest}} of the MCU, Bell said in May 2015 that [...] "I think [...] year worked really well—we got to be our own show and tell our own stories in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and do a nice hand off or a tie-in, but neither are incumbent upon the other to be a follow, and I think that's a great model for us. Ant-Man comes out this summer and will <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>gone</b> before we air again in September, so whether there's anything vestigial from that or for [...] next season is to be determined. But we're in contact with the movie people and them with us, and any time we can put little easter eggs in, it's a lot of fun for die-hard fans." [...] Bell also stated that there was a possibility of Hayley Atwell once again reprising her role as Peggy Carter in the season for an Agent Carter crossover, and after the series acknowledged the character's death in Civil War, added, [...] "Any time we can make a connection to her, whether in a flashback or dealing with what’s happening now, it makes the universe smaller." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{reviewer}} from The Honolulu Advertiser {{called it}} [...] "A smart script," [...] with [...] "slick production values {{and maybe a}} splash of nostalgia got the remake of Hawaii Five-O placed on the CBS prime-time lineup this fall, {{but it will take}} more than beefcake and a remixed theme song to keep the show on the air." [...] The piece also pointed out that times have changed since the original series left the air, citing other shows that were set in Hawaii which <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>gone.</b> It expressed a hope that the producers will succeed in bringing a new life to the title with this remake. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly graded the episode B+, calling it an [...] "unexpected pleasure," [...] and praised Caan for being [...] "terrific as the moody but excellent" [...] Danno. Tucker also believed that Kim and Park [...] "play off each other nicely." [...] Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times felt that the script was [...] "neatly balanced between action, clever banter and serious issues," [...] adding that it [...] "seems poised to hold its own in the modern age." [...] McNamara also liked O'Loughlin's performance, stating that his [...] "limpid-eye woodenness" [...] worked well for the role. Hanh Nguyen of Zap2it stated that it was [...] "damn entertaining" [...] and [...] "visually stimulating," [...] and enjoyed the chemistry between McGarrett and Danny.|$|E
500|$|In 2009, IGN {{named the}} Dreamcast the 8th {{greatest}} video game console of all time, giving {{credit to the}} innovations and software for the system. [...] According to IGN, [...] "The Dreamcast was the first console to incorporate a built-in modem for online play, and while the networking lacked the polish and refinement of its successors, {{it was the first}} time users could seamlessly power on and play with users around the globe." [...] In 2010, PC Magazines Jeffrey L. Wilson named the Dreamcast the greatest video game console, emphasizing that the system was [...] "gone too soon". In 2013, Edge named the Dreamcast the 10th best console of the last 20 years, highlighting innovations that it added to console video gaming, including in-game voice chat, downloadable content, and second screen technology through the use of VMUs. Edge explained the system's poor performance by stating, [...] "Sega's console was undoubtedly ahead of its time, and it suffered at retail for that reason... ut its influence can still be felt today." [...] Writing in 1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die, Duncan Harris noted [...] "One of the reasons that older gamers mourned the loss of the Dreamcast was that it signaled the demise of arcade gaming culture... Sega's console gave hope that things were not about to change for the worse and that the tenets of fast fun and bright, attractive graphics were not about to sink into a brown and green bog of realistic war games." [...] Parish, writing for USgamer, contrasted the Dreamcast's diverse library with the [...] "suffocating sense of conservatism" [...] that pervaded the gaming industry in the following decade. Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer, discussing the Dreamcast's portrayal [...] "as a small, square, white plastic JFK", commented that the system's short lifespan [...] "may have sealed its reputation as one of the greatest consoles ever": [...] "Nothing builds a cult like a tragic demise". According to IGN's Travis Fahs, [...] "Many hardware manufacturers <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>gone,</b> but it's unlikely any will go out with half as much class as Sega." ...|$|E
