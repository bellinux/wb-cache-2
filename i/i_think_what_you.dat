2500|$|On June 17, 2013, Shady Records {{producer}} The Alchemist {{appeared on}} RapFix Live, and tweeted to shadygodz (One of the Stan fans aka Sanket Kale Mathers) about Eminem's upcoming album: [...] "That's my boss. I DJ {{for him and}} I'm {{not at liberty to}} speak on much, but you know his caliber and what he does. Clearly going to further territories. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> would expect, especially after the last go-round. He was just getting his feet back on Relapse and then Recovery just came with the smash hits and everything and I think now — he's Eminem." [...] Prior to the announcement of the album's name, it was named to multiple [...] "Most Anticipated Albums of 2013" [...] lists; including MTV, Complex where it was listed in sixth position (and later on in second); and XXL, where it was listed in fifth.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> know <b>what</b> <b>you</b> mean!" [...] cried Ned Lowe. [...] "Isn't {{it the way}} {{in which}} he was talking to some of those Columbus players?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{she ought}} to take {{medicines}} that would reduce--reduce the disease, you know, if you are right, my dear. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> say is reasonable." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She has {{put down}} you." [...] said Milly, {{attached}} to the subject still; [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> mean is that, on the counter, she still keeps hold of you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't see {{how that}} would do any good. I may want to borrow money of you, and you can't ask a loan from a man you've kicked. Besides, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> said may do her good." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I am sorry—and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> know <b>what</b> <b>you</b> mean,” {{she said}} as she handed it him. “If my father is in Cuba now—and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> he is—he will tell <b>you</b> just <b>what</b> to do.” ...|$|R
60|$|L. <b>I</b> couldn't <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> were about. <b>I</b> {{saw your}} French grammar {{lying on the}} grass behind you, and thought perhaps you had gone to ask the ants to hear you a French verb.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mmmyes, I believe so.... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> he's <b>what</b> <b>you</b> call a black sheep. We haven't many of them, thank God! {{but we have}} a few.... He's {{an unfortunate}} man of some kind...." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{winced at}} it as at the very voice of prophecy, and it kept him a moment quiet. He {{detained}} her, however, on her appearing about to leave him alone in the rather cold clearance their talk had made. [...] "There positively isn't {{a sign of a}} hero to-night; the hero's dodging and shirking, the hero's ashamed. Therefore, you know, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> must all REALLY be occupied with is the heroine." ...|$|E
6000|$|Herminia's throat flushed a rosy red, and an unwonted {{sense of}} {{pleasure}} stole over that hard-worked frame {{as she listened}} to his words; for indeed she was fond of him. But she answered him at once without a moment's hesitation. [...] "Harvey, I'm glad you ask me, for I like and admire you. But I feel sure beforehand my answer must be NO. For <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> mean is to ask, will I marry you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Heaven knows!" [...] she declared. [...] "My husband he has, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> {{call the}} wander fever. For myself, I {{am tired of}} it. In Rome we settle down, we stay five days, all seems pleasant, and {{suddenly}} my husband's whim carries us away without an hour's notice. The same thing at Monte Carlo, the same in Paris. Who can tell what will happen here? To tell you the truth, Monsieur," [...] she added, a little archly, [...] "I think {{that if he were}} to come back at this moment, we should probably leave England to-night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Strive {{not to let}} {{yourself}} be soured, Mr. Douglas. I shudder when <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have undergone {{at the hands of}} one woman. There! I will not allude to it again." ...|$|R
6000|$|The little lady's {{eyes grew}} gentle, {{but there was}} a faint smile in them. [...] "My dear, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> know <b>what</b> <b>you</b> are feeling, but, after all, you deserve it, and I'm not so very sorry for you. I'm going to make your husband stop and speak to me." ...|$|R

6000|$|Maggie {{shook her}} head. [...] "It {{has been very}} sweet, I know,--all the talking together, and the books, and the feeling that I had the walk to look forward to, when I could tell you the {{thoughts}} that had come into my head while I was away from you. But it has made me restless; it has made me think {{a great deal about}} the world; and I have impatient thoughts again,--I get weary of my home; and then it cuts me to the heart afterward, that I should ever have felt weary of my father and mother. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> call being benumbed was better--better for me--for then my selfish desires were benumbed." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Certain {{things that}} {{are listed in the}} drawing are in red. These {{represent}} court judgments, actual dollar amounts. That is verifiable information. And I think that Lombardi himself realized that not everything could be verified. So <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have instead is names. We know about connections of names. Exactly what is that connection is hard to characterize. So that is a line with an arrow in one direction, or an arrow in two directions. So it's really the abstract component of the work of art. It's what can be represented, and--really--what cannot be represented." ...|$|E

6000|$|Westover fancied this a fit mood in Mrs. Durgin for her further instruction, and he said: [...] "And if you'll excuse me, Mrs. Durgin, <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> did {{was quite}} {{the way to}} keep a hotel." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing to you, Miss Affleck? If {{money had}} been left to your mother, it would, I imagine, be {{something}} to you, she being dead.

6000|$|... "He has {{peculiar}} ideas," [...] {{his wife}} answered.

5000|$|In December 2014, the British {{parliamentary}} Public Accounts Committee interviewed Kevin Nicholson (head of {{tax division}} in PwC UK) {{for the second}} time in two years. Margaret Hodge, the chairwoman of the committee, accused Nicholson of having lied in the first hearing before LuxLeaks. She said: [...] "It's very hard for me to understand that this is anything other than a mass-marketed tax avoidance scheme," [...] and [...] "I think there are three ways in which you lied and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> are doing is selling tax avoidance on an industrial scale."Nicholson denied that PwC mass-marketed tax avoidance schemes.|$|E
5000|$|Once twenty-eight had {{recorded}} songs, My Chemical Romance admitted their displeasure with the album they were doing; as declared, {{proved to be}} [...] "a boring album that added nothing to the genre." [...] Frank Iero commented: [...] "I think we were totally frightened by the situation..., touring for two years straight, being misinterpreted and misunderstood. We had [...] "Desolation Row" [...] and thought maybe the key was to make hard and fast songs, and make a stripped rock album. So <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> hear in Save Yourself is a band making an album they believe they want to do, but not sure why." ...|$|E
5000|$|It 1980s {{was a very}} {{experimental}} time in {{pop music}} ... People realized songs didn't have to be this standard drums-guitar-bass-whatever. We can make a song with synths and a drum pad. We can do group vocals the entire song. We can do so many different things. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> saw happening with music was also happening in our culture, where people were just wearing whatever crazy colors they wanted to, because why not? There just seemed to be this energy about endless opportunities, endless possibilities, endless ways you could live your life. And so with this record, I thought, [...] "There are no rules to this. I don't {{need to use the}} same musicians I've used, or the same band, or the same producers, or the same formula. I can make whatever record I want." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One's {{generally}} forced," [...] Charnock replied. [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> see <b>what</b> <b>you</b> mean. We undertook {{this contract}} and must {{carry it out}} if possible. Sadie would agree. She's like her father, {{and the old man}} often said: 'It's safe to deal with Keller's. When you put up the money, we put up the goods.' But let's get the powder." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "On the contrary, I took a great {{interest}} in it. I told you so; and when you told me that you counted on me--that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> was <b>what</b> <b>you</b> said--I accepted the obligation. I was a fool to do so, but I did it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, young Halkett writes jolly well, <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> <b>What?</b> Didn't <b>you</b> know Halkett wrote Burke's {{book for}} him? Burke can't use {{anything}} except a gun; and you can't write with that. Oh, he's genuine enough in his way, you know, as brave as a lion, {{or a good}} deal braver by all accounts." ...|$|R
5000|$|On June 17, 2013, Shady Records {{producer}} The Alchemist {{appeared on}} RapFix Live, and tweeted to shadygodz (One of the Stan fans aka Sanket Kale Mathers) about Eminem's upcoming album: [...] "That's my boss.

5000|$|The book {{contains}} 75 pages {{worth of}} {{comments from the}} YouTube music video. The majority of these comments are instances of people relating to the song lyrics. Many comments are memories of commenters, such as this one: “Love this song…I remember this song and dancing around singing it, stereo as loud as it would go…” A few times a series of comments appear as a conversation between two listeners, {{more often than not}} arguing about music. For example, one commenter wrote, “You claim this song is boring but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> are missing {{is that it is a}} “Mood” song. It might not have interesting melodies and chord changes but to Add these you would Subtract from the “Mood.” Some of the best songs are the simplest and this you do not understand.” [...] Another disagreement ensues when one commenter states that they are a rapper and other commenters attack the original commenter’s career, claiming that being a rapper is a sad excuse for a career.|$|E
5000|$|Eichinger then {{informed}} Sassone {{that the}} film would not be released. Speculation arose {{that the film}} had never been intended for release, but had gone into production solely {{as a way for}} Eichinger to retain rights to the characters; Stan Lee said in 2005 that this was indeed the case, insisting, [...] "The movie was never supposed to be shown to anybody," [...] and adding that the cast and crew had been left unaware. Corman and Eichinger dismissed Lee's claims, with the former stating in the same article, [...] "We had a contract to release it, and I had to be bought out of that contract" [...] by Eichinger. Eichinger, also in that article, calls Lee's version of events [...] "definitely not true. It was not our original intention to make a B movie, that's for sure, but when the movie was there, we wanted to release it." [...] He said future Marvel film impresario Avi Arad, at this point, in 1993, a Marvel executive, ...calls me up and says, 'Listen, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> did was great, it shows your enthusiasm for the movie and the property, and ... I understand that you have invested so-and-much, and Roger has invested so-and-much. Let's do a deal.' Because he really didn't like the idea that a small movie was coming out and maybe ruining the franchise.... So he says to me that he wants to give me back the money that we spent on the movie and that we should not release it.|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{there are}} the young ones back again. <b>I</b> will <b>think</b> over <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have been telling me, and we can discuss it again tomorrow." ...|$|R
6000|$|Desmond made {{a little}} {{restraining}} gesture. [...] "Well," [...] he said, [...] "it's not my business, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> understand <b>what</b> <b>you</b> are referring to--and, perhaps, it's scarcely wise to be too sure. With all deference to Mrs. Ratcliffe I can't help fancying you are well out of the other matter. After all, to mention no other reason, it would require {{a certain amount of}} courage to recognize that lady as one's mother-in-law." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Deronda, {{looking at}} her coolly; [...] "I think that is quite excusable sometimes. But <b>I</b> did not <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> were last saying was {{altogether}} artificial." ...|$|R
