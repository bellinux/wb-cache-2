40|$|The Closer Economic Relationship with Australia {{agreement}} (CER) {{was brought}} Into effect on 1 January 1983. The CER {{provided for the}} liberalisation of trade between New Zealand and Australia. This liberalisation is to be effected through the gradual elimination of barriers to trade following an established formula. Some departures from the formula are provided for where specific products would be treated in an inappropriate manner if the formula were followed. The objective of the liberalisation procedure is complete removal of barriers to trade by 1995. The granting {{of access to the}} New Zealand market for Australian tomatoes is included in the agreement. The level of access provided caused New Zealand growers of <b>hothouse</b> <b>tomatoes</b> to express concern over the possible impact of imports on the New Zealand industry. This Discussion Paper provides a report on an investigation of the likely impact of Australian tomato supplies on the New Zealand market. It is established that the most probable source of exports to New Zealand is Queensland. A review of Queensland tomato production costs indicates that a price of $A 5. 00 / 10 kg carton would be required by Queensland growers to cover their variable production costs. Additional costs involved in exporting to New Zealand result in a New Zealand market price of $NZ 17. 00 / 10 kg carton ($NZ 1. 70 /kg) being required by Queensland growers. This price can be achieved on the New Zealand market between June and November. Exporting to New Zealand would therefore only be attractive to Queensland growers during that period. The New Zealand <b>hothouse</b> <b>tomato</b> growing industry supplies approximately two thirds of the tomatoes for the freshmarket. These supplies are predominantly during autumn, winter and spring when higher prices are available. During summer, prices are lower as outdoor grown- tomatoes become available. The <b>hothouse</b> <b>tomato</b> growing industry considers that the high winter prices are essential to their profitability. It is probable that some price reductions will occur as a result of imports from Australia being available during winter. However, the quality of the Australian product is likely to be inferior to that available in New Zealand and therefore the price impact will be less. In addition, up to 1988 the quantity of tomatoes able to be imported from Australia is limited to a level equivalent to between 0. 57 per cent and 1. 01 per cent of average New Zealand annual <b>hothouse</b> <b>tomato</b> production. The average variation in New Zealand <b>hothouse</b> <b>tomato</b> production from year to year (over 1975 to 1981) exceeded the total allowable Australian supply by between 14 and 25 times. Therefore the impact of New Zealand supply variations on the market price is likely to be greater than the impact of supplies from Australia. Over the longer term, increased supplies from Australia can be expected to have a greater impact on the New Zealand market. The establishment of appropriate premiums for higher quality New Zealand tomatoes through the use of an effective marketing system would reduce this price lowering effect of imports from Australia. Some reduction in New Zealand <b>hothouse</b> <b>tomato</b> production could be expected as less efficient growers fail to achieve adequate returns. There is likely to be increased total demand for tomatoes during the winter period when lower priced Australian tomatoes are available. Increased outdoor tomato production during the summer months could also be expected to offset reduced <b>hothouse</b> <b>tomato</b> supplies during summer. Overall, prices are likely to be reduced (with premiums available for high quality product) and tomato consumption could be expected to increase...|$|R

40|$|Summary. The name tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) {{has been}} given to several white¯y-transmitted geminiviruses {{affecting}} <b>tomato</b> <b>cultures</b> in many tropical and subtropical regions. Hybridization tests with two DNA probes derived from a cloned isolate of TYLCV from Israel (TYLCV-ISR) were used to assess the af®nities of viruses in naturally infected tomato plants with yellow leaf curl or leaf curl symptoms from 25 countries. Probe A which included most of the intergenic region was expected to detect only isolates closely related to TYLCV-ISR, especially after high stringency washes. In contrast probe B, which included the full-length genome, was expected to detect a wide range of white¯y-transmitted geminiviruses. Tomato samples from six countries in the Middle East, from Cuba or the Dominican Republic proved to be closely related to TYLCV-ISR and probably were infected by strains of the same virus. Samples from Senegal and Cape Verde Islands were also related to the Middle Eastern virus.

40|$|Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) is {{the name}} given to a complex of geminiviruses infecting <b>tomato</b> <b>cultures</b> worldwide. TYLCV is {{transmitted}} by a single insect species, the whitefly Bemisia tabaci. Herein we show that a TYLCV isolate from Israel (TYLCV-Is) can be transmitted among whiteflies in a sex-dependent manner, {{in the absence of}} any other source of virus. TYLCV was transmitted from viruliferous males to females and from viruliferous females to males but not among insects of the same sex. Transmission took place when insects were caged in groups or in couples, in a feeding chamber or on cotton plants, a TYLCV nonhost. The recipient insects were able to efficiently inoculate tomato test plants. Insect-to-insect virus transmission was instrumental in increasing the number of whiteflies capable of infecting tomato test plants in a whitefly population. TYLCV was present in the hemolymph of whiteflies caged with viruliferous insects of the other sex; therefore, the virus follows, at least in part, the circulative pathway associated with acquisition from infected plants. Taken as a whole, these results imply that a plant virus can be sexually transmitted from insect to insect...|$|R

40|$|We {{isolated}} from a tomato cDNA library the tomPRO 1 locus, which encodes γ-glutamyl kinase (GK) and γ-glutamyl phosphate reductase (GPR). This locus is unusual among eukaryotic genetic elements {{because it contains}} two open reading frames, and thus resembles prokaryotic polycistronic operons. The first open reading frame, specifying GK, is terminated by a TAA codon, which is followed by five nucleotides, an ATG translation initiation codon, and the second open reading frame, encoding GPR. DNA sequence analysis of fragments obtained by PCR amplification confirmed that the internal TAA and neighboring sequences {{are present in the}} endogenous tomPRO 1 sequence in tomato. We demonstrated with RNase protection assays that the tomPRO 1 locus is transcribed in <b>tomato</b> tissue <b>culture</b> cells, into a product that contains the internal stop codon. In Escherichia coli, tomPRO 1 directed the synthesis of two proteins, a 33 -kDa GK and a 44 -kDa GPR.

These results suggest that extracellular- and intracellular- polysaccharides produced are important bioactive compounds with medicinal potential...|$|R
40|$|The {{activity}} of 1 -aminocyclopropane carboxylate (ACC) synthase increased rapidly in tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) leaf discs after vacuum infiltration, reached a maximum after about 30 minutes, and subsequently decayed with an apparent half-life of about 20 minutes. Aminoethoxyvinylglycine, a known inhibitor of ACC synthase, did {{not alter the}} apparent turnover of ACC synthase in vivo although it efficiently blocked inactivation of the enzyme by its substrate S-adenosylmethionine in vitro. Similar results were obtained, using a novel assay with permeabilized cells, for ACC synthase in <b>tomato</b> cell <b>cultures</b> treated with a fungal elicitor. The results indicate that inactivation of ACC synthase in vivo differs from substrate-dependent inactivation in vitro...|$|R

40|$|The tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) acid phosphatase- 1 (Apase- 11, EC 3. 1. 3. 2) isozyme variant, genetically {{linked to}} the root-knot {{nematode}} resistance locus (Mi) on chromosome 6, has been purified by a rapid procedure from <b>tomato</b> cell suspension <b>cultures.</b> Peptide fragments of the purified enzyme were generated from trypsin and Lys-C endoprotease digests and separated by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Amino acid sequences derived from the purified peptide fragments represented > 50 % of the total amino acid content of the protein and enabled the construction of degenerate oligonucleotide probes {{that were used to}} screen a <b>tomato</b> cell <b>culture</b> complementary DNA library. Clones corresponding to full-length coding sequences for Apase- 1 have been isolated and sequenced. Southern blot analysis of DNA isolated from a number of tomato cultivars shows that the Apase- 11 gene (aps 1) is present at one copy per genome and that genotypes containing the aps 11 allele have restriction fragment length polymorphisms that distinguish them from cultivars having the aps 1 + allele. Segregation analysis demonstrates that the restriction fragment length polymorphisms are associated with the aps 1 locus. Tomato Apase- 11 is also found to have significant homology at the amino acid sequence level to a class of vegetative storage proteins characterized in soybean...|$|R
