This caused him to be arrested and exiled in 1922. After his return he became a very influential priest in Moscow and formed parish brotherhoods for moral rebirth. In 1927 he broke with Sergii, and in 1928 he was exiled to Siberia, where he died in 1931. Before his death he repented of breaking with Sergii and asked to be reaccepted into the Orthodox Church, claiming that schism was the worst of all sins and that it separated one from the true Church; he also wrote a passionate appeal to his Moscow parishioners to return to Sergii and asked for them to <b>forgive</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> having led them in the wrong direction.|$|E

Duerr noted that of all the translators he had worked with, Goodman showed the greatest dedication to her work. For the English-language translation, Duerr included a new preface, in which he noted that he had refused to make changes to the original text despite the insistence of the publisher. Explaining his reasoning, he remarked that [...] "a book is not a dishwasher, where it is advisable to change malfunctioning parts." [...] He accepted that the book had faults, and expressed his hope that the reader would <b>forgive</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> leaving them intact in the English translation.

[...] Johnson was less sanguine: [...] "We had a great chance to make up some points and got crashed by a teammate... I was real patient until the white flag was up. I got a good run inside the 8 and got a lot of help from behind — too much help... Knowing the situation we're all in, I would hope someone would be a little more patient."

500|$|His {{plans to}} become a soldier died after a legal battle {{concerning}} his estate, in which he consulted John Glanville. Glanville successfully persuaded Hale {{to become a}} lawyer, and, after leaving Oxford {{at the age of}} 20 before obtaining a degree, he joined Lincoln's Inn on 8 November 1628. Fearing that the theatre might dissuade him from his legal studies as it had at Oxford, he swore [...] "never to see a stage-play again". At around this time he was drinking with a group of friends when one of them became so drunk he fainted; Hale prayed to God to forgive and save his friend, and <b>forgive</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> his previous excesses. His friend recovered, and Hale was restored to his Puritan faith, never drinking to someone's health again (not even drinking to the King) and going to church every Sunday for 36 years. He instead settled into his studies, working for up to 16 hours a day during his first two years at Lincoln's Inn before reducing it to eight hours due to health concerns. As well as reading the law reports and statutes, Hale also studied the Roman civil law and jurisprudence. Outside of the law, Hale studied anatomy, history, philosophy and mathematics. He refused to read the news or attend social events, and occupied himself entirely with his studies and visits to church.|$|E

500|$|Homer takes Bart's sons to a {{cryonics}} {{facility where}} Grampa has been frozen alive {{to prevent a}} disease from killing him. Although a cure has now been discovered, he is kept frozen by Homer because it is cheaper than paying for a nursing home and because Grampa has constantly been rude to him.

500|$|Van Chester Thompkins was {{considered}} a suspect in a fatal shooting on January 10, 2000 in Southfield, Michigan. After advising Thompkins of his Miranda rights, police officers interrogated him. Thompkins did not state at any time {{that he wanted to}} rely on his right to remain silent, nor {{that he did not want}} to talk to the police, nor that he wanted an attorney. The court record suggested that he had been almost completely silent during the three-hour interrogation and the few sporadic comments he made had no bearing on the case (police described it as [...] "nearly a monologue"), but near the end, detectives changed their approach and [...] "tried a spiritual tac" [...] and an [...] "appeal to his conscience and religious beliefs". Thompkins was asked in sequence—did he believe in God, did he pray to God, and did he pray to God to <b>forgive</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> shooting the victim. He answered [...] "yes" [...] to each of these. Thompkins made a motion to suppress his statements, claiming that he had invoked his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent, that he had not waived that right, and that his inculpatory statements were involuntary. The trial court denied his motion and Thompkins was found guilty by a jury and sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Of note, there had been significant other evidence of guilt corroborating the conviction.|$|E

500|$|Since its release, Mulholland Drive has, {{according}} to film scholars Jay R. Letzner and Donald R. Ross, [...] "garnered both {{some of the}} harshest epithets {{and some of the}} most lavish praise in recent cinematic history". It received acclaim from many critics; even Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times, who had up til that point been primarily dismissive of Lynch's work, awarded the film four stars and commented, [...] "David Lynch has been working toward Mulholland Drive all of his career, and now that he's arrived there I <b>forgive</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> Wild at Heart (1990) and even Lost Highway (1997). At last his experiment doesn't shatter the test tubes. The movie is a surrealist dreamscape {{in the form of a}} Hollywood film noir, and the less sense it makes, the more we can't stop watching it." [...] Ebert subsequently added Mulholland Drive to his [...] "Great Films" [...] list in November 2012. In The New York Times, Stephen Holden wrote that the film [...] "ranks alongside Fellini's 8½ and other auteurist fantasias as a monumental self-reflection" [...] and added, [...] "Looked at lightly, it is the grandest and silliest cinematic carnival to come along in quite some time: a lurching journey through one filmmaker's personal fun house. On a more serious level, its investigation into the power of movies pierces a void from which you can hear the screams of a ravenous demon whose appetites can never be slaked." [...] Edward Guthmann of the San Francisco Chronicle called it [...] "exhilarating... for its dreamlike images and fierce, frequently reckless imagination" [...] and added, [...] "there's a mesmerizing quality to its languid pace, its sense of foreboding and its lost-in-time atmosphere... it holds us, spellbound and amused, for all of its loony and luscious, exasperating 146minutes [...] proves that Lynch is in solid form—and still an expert at pricking our nerves." ...|$|E
