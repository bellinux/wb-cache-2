Findings and Results: Analyses provide strong support for the impacts of organizational commitment on organizational citizenship behavior. The most antecedent of organizational citizenship behavior is normative commitment. Second is emotional commitment and lastly contiunace commitment. Proposals: In order to increase the level of organizational citizenship behavior organizational commitment of employees must be improved. For this reason one of the most important responsibilities of management [...] must be establishing a vision which is shared inside the organization.

40|$|Graduation date: 1995 Summer Youth Employment Programs (SYEPs) provide {{disadvantaged}} youth {{jobs and}} employment experiences. These federally funded programs meet a practical {{need to help}} adolescents earn money and have positive summer activities. In addition, federal administrators have implemented program requirements designed to give youth relevant training for future employment. One federal requirement for SYEPs is that all youth are to be screened to determine their basic reading and math skills. In addition to a job, local programs are to provide remedial instruction to youth who fail to meet minimum standards for reading and math. In 1994, SYEPs were also mandated to provide "educational enrichment" for {{at least half of}} all participating youth. This study was an evaluation of a SYEP in a Northwestern State and its implementation of different models of employment, remediation, and educational enrichment. Each model was operated in conjunction with a job. For youth who qualified for academic remediation, the two programs were a remedial class or on-the-job remedial enrichment. For youth who did not require remediation, the two models were a job alone or a <b>job</b> with educational <b>enrichment.</b> Outcomes evaluated included self-esteem using the Rosenberg Self Esteem Scale (Rosenberg, 1965), self-mastery with the Mastery Scale (Pearlin & Schooler, 1978), and intellectual responsibility using the Intellectual Achievement Responsibility Scale (Crandall & Crandall, 1965). Job-related reading and math skills were screened at program intake with the Comprehensive Adult Student Assessment System (CASAS) (1988) and as a post-test for youth receiving remediation. For remedial youth, all significant findings favored youth in enrichment projects rather than in remedial classes. For non-remedial youth, those in a job alone, rather than in a <b>job</b> with <b>enrichment,</b> had the most positive outcomes. The study suggests research to change the motivational patterns of adolescents in local programs is needed before additional program interventions are mandated.

This study investigated the application of the functional approach to attitudes to the domain of job satisfaction. It was posited that the effects of job characteristics, social context, and pay on job satisfaction would be moderated by the function that the person's job attitude (i. e., value-expressive, social-adjustive, or utilitarian) serves. Additionally, it was posited that these attitude functions would moderate relationships between job satisfaction and performance (both task and contextual). In measuring people's attitude functions, it became apparent that the function of their attitude (i. e., the function of holding a positive or negative attitude toward their job) was different than the function of the attitude object (i. e., the function of the job itself for that person). After testing the hypotheses with both participants' attitude function and their attitude object function, it was determined that attitude object function was a more important moderator when predicting job satisfaction and its effects. When the antecedents of job satisfaction "matched" the function the job was serving (i. e., pay and utilitarian attitude object function; <b>job</b> characteristics <b>enrichment</b> and value-expressive attitude object function), the effect of the antecedent on job satisfaction was generally more positive. In turn, some attitude object functions served as moderators between job satisfaction and task performance (i. e., utilitarian and social-adjustive). These results suggest that a person's reason for being satisfied with their job (i. e., his/her attitude object function) is an important variable to consider both when examining why people are satisfied with their jobs and when examining the conditions when more satisfied employees are in fact better performers...|$|R

The replicated findings were that the situational elements relating to the importance of clarity for how to derive social value and meet the expectations of the work environment were most predictive of psychological distress, life and job satisfaction. While the availability of money was also predictive of life satisfaction, situational elements relating to Job Scope were important to the prediction of job satisfaction.

The paper seeks to determine the factors that influence bank staff motivation in the Cape Coast Metropolis. In specific terms, this paper aimed at analysing the variance explained by variables in staff motivation as well as determining whether there are statistically significant differences in the levels of the factors that affect staff motivation. The census sampling method was employed for the study. The responses of 81 staff members were gathered through questionnaires from seven banks in the Cape Coast Metropolis. Descriptive statistics was used for mean levels of the factors whilst a dependent (sample) t-test was used to determine the differences between the levels of the factors. Multiple regression technique was used to identify the factors (determinants) that best explain variance in staff motivation. It was explained from the study that there were statistically significant differences between the levels of the factors that affect staff motivation except between staff supervision and staff perceived competence and staff recognition and job satisfaction.

40|$|Employees {{discretion}} {{over the}} scheduling {{of their work}} hours, {{often referred to as}} schedule flexibility, has been repeatedly linked to increases in both job satisfaction and family satisfaction. Despite the international research, evidence on these relationships has not been empirically tested in the South African context. There is also a gap in understanding the role of perceived work-to-family enrichment on the relationship between schedule flexibility and domain-specific satisfaction. To address these gaps in our knowledge, this study investigated the relationship between schedule flexibility and domain-specific satisfaction amongst South African employees, and assessed the role of work-to-family enrichment as a mediator of this relationship. Work-to-family enrichment occurs when a resource gain in the work domain promotes gains in the family domain. The propositions were tested among working parents that used schedule flexibility (N= 121) across multiple organisations in South Africa. Working parents responded to a self-report online survey. The questionnaire contained, inter alia, measures of schedule flexibility use, schedule flexibility availability, work-to-family <b>enrichment,</b> <b>job</b> satisfaction, family satisfaction and personal demographics. Correlation and regression analysis were used to test the propositions. Preacher and Hayes' (2004) PROCESS script was used to test mediation effects. The results of the analyses indicated that there is a significant positive and proportional relationship between the use of schedule flexibility and domain-specific satisfaction. The use of schedule flexibility was more strongly correlated to job satisfaction than employee knowledge regarding the availability of schedule flexibility in the organisation. Further analysis showed that work-to-family enrichment mediated the relationship between schedule flexibility use and domain-specific satisfaction...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{introduce}} a multidimensional work preference research instrument, and to relate scores on these dimensions with subjects 2 ̆ 7 real world work choices. Design/methodology/approach: Repeated samples of 1, 002 and 975 adult subjects were used to identify 17 empirically derived constructs, using both EFA and CFA statistical applications. The CFA revealed measurement invariance among the predicted and measured constructs. The 17 validated constructs were culled from career development-related psychology that has variously been identified with learning styles, work interests, work values, and temperament. Using a third sample of 590 subjects, MANOVA analyses of work preference scores were conducted with working adults, representing ten different types of work. When the scores on the 17 measures were compared with occupational choices made by the subjects, significant differences in outcomes were identified, indicating commonality within specific work types. Research limitations/implications: Because the work preference construct is relatively new and fluid, continuous research is needed to gain greater understanding of the construct and its characteristics. Additional sampling and tests for measurement invariance are indicated using cross-national samples, as well as non-English-speaking languages. Samples from younger, pre-career subjects in secondary schools and representing a wide array of demographic characteristics are also needed as the research progresses. In addition, more studies are needed to test for predictive validity, using other unobtrusive performance measures taken at different points in time. Practical implications: Multiple measures embedded in one tool may prove useful aids to people when making career choice decisions that are associated with the selection of short-term work placement, long-term career occupations, and academic fields of study. The development of this tool will enable career development researchers to examine the relationships of psychological constructs identified with different fields of psychological measurement, and examine these constructs as they relate to classroom, organizational and cross-national contexts. Originality/value: The creation of a tool consisting of measures from multiple psychological fields for use in short-term career planning, <b>job</b> placement, and <b>enrichment</b> is novel. When combined, the multiple constructs used in this instrument have been found to provide a constellation of useful indicators that are related to career choice and work placement decisions. The measures are also likely to be useful in cross-national research contexts...|$|R
