5|$|In 2008, an {{estimated}} 140,000 married fathers {{worked in the}} home as their children's primary caregivers while their wives worked outside the home {{to provide for the}} family. This number is less than the previous two years according to the US Census Bureau. In 2007, stay-at-home dads made up approximately 2.7% of the nation's stay-at-home parents. This is triple the percentage from 1997, and has been consistently higher each year since 2005. In 2006, stay-at-home dads were caring for approximately 245,000 children; 63% of stay-at-home dads had two or more children. These statistics only account for married stay-at-home dads; there are other children being cared for by single fathers or <b>gay</b> <b>couples.</b> Also, it is difficult to ascertain how many of these stay-at-home dads have accepted the role voluntarily, and how many have been forced into it by the economic crisis of the late 2000s and early 2010s during which a great number of mostly-male blue-collar industries suffered significant losses and many previously employed men entered periods of prolonged unemployment.|$|E

25|$|On November 18, 2003, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) {{decided that}} the Commonwealth could not deny {{marriage}} rights to <b>gay</b> <b>couples</b> under the state constitution.

On May 17, 2004, the ruling took effect and thousands of gay and lesbian couples across the Commonwealth entered into marriage. Opponents of gay marriage subsequently pushed for an amendment to the state constitution that would allow the state to deny marriage rights to <b>gay</b> <b>couples.</b> It was necessary for the amendment to be approved by at least 1/4 of the members present in two consecutive legislative sessions of the Massachusetts legislature, and to receive majority support in a popular referendum.
