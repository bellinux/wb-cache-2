5|$|Adult common loons {{have few}} predators, {{although}} bald eagles will attack incubating birds. Attacks by sharks in winter {{have also been}} recorded. When a predator approaches (either the loon's nest or the loon itself), the common loon sometimes attacks the predator by rushing at it and trying to stab it with its dagger-like bill, aiming its attacks <b>either</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> predator's abdomen or the back of its head or neck.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 20th century, {{plans were}} floated to {{recreate}} the 500 Club <b>either</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Trump Marina Hotel Casino or at the Sands Hotel and Casino, but neither materialized. D'Amato's daughter Paulajane, who grew up in an apartment over the 500 Club, is now a member of the 500 Club Committee, which sponsors benefit concerts. In September 2015 the Philly Pops recreated the 500 Club in a Philadelphia restaurant, featuring performances by Deana Martin and Michael Andrew.|$|E

5|$|The {{canonical}} five murders were perpetrated at night, on {{or close}} to a weekend, <b>either</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of a month or a week (or so) after. The mutilations became increasingly severe as the series of murders proceeded, except for that of Stride, whose attacker may have been interrupted. Nichols was not missing any organs; Chapman's uterus was taken; Eddowes had her uterus and a kidney removed and her face mutilated; and Kelly's body was eviscerated and her face hacked away, though only her heart was missing from the crime scene.|$|E
5|$|The opera {{was given}} its premiere at the London Coliseum by ENO on June 15, 1998 in a {{production}} by Atom Egoyan.

Doctor Ox received four further performances during that run, one of which was broadcast on BBC Radio 3.|$|E
5|$|The {{practice}} of manumission is confirmed to have existed in Chios from the 6th century BC. It probably {{dates back to}} an earlier period, as it was an oral procedure. Informal emancipations are also confirmed in the classical period. It was sufficient to have witnesses, who would escort the citizen to a public emancipation of his slave, <b>either</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> theatre or before a public tribunal. This practice was outlawed in Athens {{in the middle of}} the 6th century BC to avoid public disorder.|$|E

5|$|After {{a protein}} has been ubiquitinated, it is {{recognized}} by the 19S regulatory particle in an ATP-dependent binding step. The substrate protein must then enter {{the interior of the}} 20S particle to come in contact with the proteolytic active sites. Because the 20S particle's central channel is narrow and gated by the N-terminal tails of the α ring subunits, the substrates must be at least partially unfolded before they enter the core. The passage of the unfolded substrate into the core is called translocation and necessarily occurs after deubiquitination. However, the order in which substrates are deubiquitinated and unfolded is not yet clear. Which of these processes is the rate-limiting step in the overall proteolysis reaction depends on the specific substrate; for some proteins, the unfolding process is rate-limiting, while deubiquitination is the slowest step for other proteins. The extent to which substrates must be unfolded before translocation is not known, but substantial tertiary structure, and in particular nonlocal interactions such as disulfide bonds, are sufficient to inhibit degradation. The presence of intrinsically disordered protein segments of sufficient size, <b>either</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> protein terminus or internally, has also been proposed to facilitate efficient initiation of degradation.|$|E
5|$|Anne {{became a}} general {{favourite}} {{with the people}} she met <b>either</b> <b>at</b> <b>The</b> Hague or at the Princess of Orange's country house at Teylingen. She was very attractive and stylish, and attracted many men. One of the first men {{to fall in love}} with Anne was Spencer Compton, a son of the Earl of Northampton. However, Anne quickly fell in love with Henry Jermyn, who returned her feelings. Anne dismissed Jermyn just as quickly when she met James, Duke of York, the son of the deposed king. On 24 November 1659, two or three years after she first met him, James promised he would marry Anne. Charles, James' brother, forced him reluctantly into this, saying that her strong character would be a positive influence on his weak-willed brother.|$|E
5|$|By {{the second}} {{decade of the}} 21st century, the overall {{consensus}} supported the position {{that there was only}} a single author who was writing <b>either</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of the 4th century or the beginning of the 5th century, and who was interested in blending contemporary issues (political, religious and social) into the lives of the 3rd century emperors. Further, that the author used the fictitious elements in the work to highlight references to other published works, such as to Cicero and Ammianus Marcellinus in a complex allegorical game. Despite these conundrums, it is the only continuous account in Latin for much of its period and is thus continually being re-evaluated, since modern historians are unwilling to abandon it as a unique source of possible information, despite its obvious untrustworthiness on many levels.|$|E

5|$|The {{mouthpiece}} {{and reed}} {{are surrounded by}} the player's lips, which put light, even pressure on the reed and form an airtight seal. Air is blown past the reed and down the instrument. In {{the same way a}} flag flaps in the breeze, the air rushing past the reed causes it to vibrate. As air pressure from the mouth increases, the amount the reed vibrates increases until the reed hits the mouthpiece. At this point the reed stays pressed against the mouthpiece until either the springiness of the reed forces it to open or a returning pressure wave 'bumps' into the reed and opens it. Each time the reed opens, a puff of air goes through the gap, after which the reed swings shut again. When played loudly, the reed can spend up to 50% of the time shut. The 'puff of air' or compression wave (around 3% greater pressure than the surrounding air) travels down the cylindrical tube and escapes {{at the point where the}} tube opens out. This is <b>either</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> closest open hole or at the end of the tube (see diagram: image 1).|$|E
5|$|While the {{executive}} branch of the Brazilian government plotted to retake or sink the rebelling warships, they were hampered by personnel distrust and equipment problems; historians have since cast doubt on their chances of successfully accomplishing <b>either.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> same time, Congress—led by Rui Barbosa, a senator—pursued a route of amnesty, appointing a former navy captain as their liaison to the rebels. This latter route was successful, and a bill granting amnesty to all involved and ending the use of corporal punishment passed the lower house by a veto-proof margin. However, many of the sailors were quickly discharged from the navy, and after an unrelated second rebellion took place a few weeks later, many of the original mutineers were rounded up and thrown into jail or sent to work camps on the rubber plantations to the north.|$|E
5|$|The state {{constitution}} has provided since 1777 {{for the election}} of a lieutenant governor, who is also ex officio president of the state senate, to the same term (keeping the same term lengths as the governor throughout all the constitutional revisions). Originally, in the event of the death, resignation or impeachment of the governor, the lieutenant governor would become acting governor {{until the end of the}} yearly legislative term, the office being filled in a special election, if there was a remainder of the term. Since the 1821 constitution, the lieutenant governor explicitly becomes governor upon such vacancy in the office and serves for the entire remainder of the term. Should the office of lieutenant governor become vacant, the president pro tempore of the state senate performs all the duties of the lieutenant governor until the vacancy is filled <b>either</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> next gubernatorial election or by appointment. Likewise, should both offices become vacant at the same time, the president pro tempore acts as governor, with the office of lieutenant governor remaining vacant. Should the presidency pro tempore be vacant too, or the incumbent unable to fulfill the duties, the speaker of the assembly is next in the line of succession. The lieutenant governor is elected on the same ticket as the governor, since 1954 with a single joint vote cast for both offices, but is nominated separately.|$|E
