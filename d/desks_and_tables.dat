A dozen gentlemen and ladies occupy a tank together, and amuse themselves with rompings and various games. They have floating <b>desks</b> <b>and</b> <b>tables,</b> and they read or lunch or play chess in water that is breast-deep. The tourist can step in and view this novel spectacle if he chooses. There's a poor-box, and he will have to contribute. There are several of these big bathing-houses, and you can always tell when you are near one of them by the romping noises and shouts of laughter that proceed from it. The water is running water, and changes all the time, else a patient with a ringworm might take the bath with only a partial success, since, while he was ridding himself of the ringworm, he might catch the itch.|$|E
60|$|After {{this picture}} of an inclement night, behold us seated by a great blazing fire, which looked so {{comfortable}} and delicious that I felt inclined to lie down and roll among the hot coals. The usual furniture of a lawyer's office was around us,--rows of volumes in sheepskin, and a multitude of writs, summonses, and other legal papers, scattered over the <b>desks</b> <b>and</b> <b>tables.</b> But there were certain objects which seemed to intimate that we had little dread of the intrusion of clients, or of the learned counsellor himself, who, indeed, was attending court in a distant town. A tall, decanter-shaped bottle stood on the table, between two tumblers, and beside a pile of blotted manuscripts, altogether dissimilar to any law documents recognized in our courts. My friend, whom I shall call Oberon,--it was a name of fancy and friendship between him and me,--my friend Oberon looked at these papers with a peculiar expression of disquietude.|$|E

50|$|Earlier wood {{versions}} of cup holders for tops of desks {{have been around}} decades such as one featured in a U.S. Airline catalog in the late 1980s. The industry for cup holders for <b>desks</b> <b>and</b> <b>tables</b> really picked up steam in the U.S. around 2006. The industry was advertised for instance by being mentioned in U.S. cartoon shows such as Scooby Doo in the 2000s.

The accommodations on the fifth would later be known as the [...] "President's Suite". Designed by Guilbert and Betelle in a Renaissance Revival style, the exterior features granite and cast stone at the base, with brick and terra cotta trim covering the upper stories. The hotel was intended to make use of every luxury and technology available at the time in the hotel industry and would be the very first {{of its kind in the}} city. Perhaps the most impressive structure of the original hotel was the lobby, where huge columns combined with intricate lighting features over a white marble steps, tile floors, and lavish rugs. There were plentiful lounge space, large palms and potted plants, and writing <b>desks</b> <b>and</b> <b>tables</b> on a balcony for afternoon tea.

"This {{suggested}} work {{seems to}} have been done, as in the following year we read: 'The ceiling has been raised eighteen inches; the windows have been enlarged; and the old uncomfortable <b>desks</b> <b>and</b> <b>tables</b> have been replaced by some which were formerly used in the schools in the Town Hall.' I think the school, as I remember it, was about as these changes left it. We entered through a short, narrow hallway {{at the back of the}} school. This hall had hooks for clothes on one side and a shelf on the other, on one end of which was kept a large bucket of fresh water for drinking purposes. This was brought over from the high service pumping station next door each morning, Mr. Webber, engineer there, being the janitor for the little school. He was in league with Miss Hyde, I am sure, to make our days in that school some of the happiest and most worthwhile of any of our school days. Rudimentary sanitation was attempted. Each pupil was required to have an individual drinking cup. Wood for the huge stove was kept outside in a sort of closet in the hall, west of the entrance. If the day's supply which was left in the morning beside the stove gave out, the older boys could renew it. Then, still further along at the end of the hall, was our one out-of-door facility. Another was added during the years I was there." ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{his later}} years, Judd {{also worked with}} furniture, design, and architecture. He was careful to {{distinguish}} his design practice from his artwork, writing in 1993: The configuration and the scale of art cannot be transposed into furniture and architecture. The intent of art {{is different from that}} of the latter, which must be functional. If a chair or a building is not functional, if it appears to be only art, it is ridiculous. The art of a chair is not its resemblance to art, but is partly its reasonableness, usefulness and scale as a chair...A work of art exists as itself; a chair exists as a chair itself.The first furniture was designed in 1973, when he moved from New York to Marfa. His designs included chairs, beds, shelves, <b>desks</b> <b>and</b> <b>tables.</b> Judd was initially prompted to design furniture by his own dissatisfaction with what was commercially available in Marfa. Early furniture was made by Judd of rough, lumberyard-cut pine but he continually refined the construction of the wooden pieces, employing craftspeople using a variety of techniques and materials around the world. In 1984, Judd commissioned Lehni AG, in Dübendorf, Switzerland to produce his furniture designs in sheet metal, in finishes of monochrome colored powdercoat based on the RAL colour standard, clear anodized aluminium, or solid copper. These designs are still produced by Lehni AG and sold through the Judd Foundation. In 1984, Judd drew upon his experience with this metal furniture by creating a series of colored artworks using the same techniques of powdercoating and bending. [...] At the time of his death, he was working on designs for a fountain commissioned by the city of Winterthur in 1991, Switzerland, and a new glass facade for a railroad station in Basel, Switzerland.|$|E

40|$|The use of {{computers}} in schools has grown rapidly over the past 10 years. This growth {{is likely to continue}} since it is a widely held belief that computers enhance children’s ability to learn. Many school districts have spent large sums of money to purchase computers and set up labs and individual workstations in classrooms. Some districts have also purchased computer workstation furniture while others have converted <b>desks</b> <b>and</b> <b>tables</b> into workstations. As adult office workers ’ use {{of computers}} has increased, the incidence of computer-related musculoskeletal complaints and injuries has also increased. Although the {{use of computers}} in the classroom is increasing, little attention has been paid by educators, furniture manufacturers, or researchers to the ergonomic design issues of educational furniture for computer use. A recent study by Cornell researchers looked at the ergonomic appropriateness of computer workstations in school facilities for children grades 3 - 5 in six New York and Michigan elementary schools. Using the Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA) (McAtamney & Corlett, 1993) as a measuring tool, the study revealed that all six schools had computer-equipped classrooms in which students assumed postures associated with high risk for the development of musculoskeletal disorders (Oates, et al., in press).
