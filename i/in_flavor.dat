5|$|Iceberg/Crisphead - {{the most}} popular type in the US, it is very {{heat-sensitive}} and was originally adapted for growth in the northern US. It ships well, but is low <b>in</b> <b>flavor</b> and nutritional content, being composed of even more water than other lettuce types.|$|E
5|$|In Australia, {{particularly}} the Margaret River region, the grape is often blended with Sémillon. Varietal styles, made from only the Sauvignon blanc grape, from Adelaide Hills and Padthaway have a style distinctive from their New Zealand neighbors {{that tend to}} be more ripe <b>in</b> <b>flavor</b> with white peach and lime notes and slightly higher acidity.|$|E
5|$|The Norman Cob is {{also used}} for riding, and {{may be used for}} most equestrian disciplines. It is {{particularly}} well suited for vaulting. Elderly and nervous riders often appreciate the breed's calm temperament. Lighter Cobs can be used for mounted hunts. Crosses between the Norman Cob and Thoroughbred continue to be made to create saddle horses, generally with 25 to 50 percent Cob blood. Some Norman Cobs are bred for the meat market. The breed is sometimes preferred by butchers because of the lighter carcass weight and increased profitability over the Thoroughbred, {{while at the same time}} retaining meat similar <b>in</b> <b>flavor</b> and appearance to that of the Thoroughbred.|$|E

5|$|The parsnip (Pastinaca sativa) is a root {{vegetable}} {{closely related to}} the carrot and parsley. It is a biennial plant usually grown as an annual. Its long, tuberous root has cream-colored skin and flesh; and left in the ground to mature, it becomes sweeter <b>in</b> <b>flavor</b> after winter frosts. In its first growing season, the plant has a rosette of pinnate, mid-green leaves. If unharvested, it produces its flowering stem, topped by an umbel of small yellow flowers, in its second growing season. By this time, the stem is woody and the tuber is inedible. The seeds are pale brown, flat, and winged.|$|E
5|$|Green tea: This tea has {{undergone}} {{the least amount}} of oxidation. The oxidation process is halted by the quick application of heat after tea picking, either with steam, the method preferred in Japan, or by dry roasting and cooking in hot pans, preferred in Chinese tea processing. Tea leaves may be left to dry as separate leaves or they may be rolled into small pellets to make gunpowder tea. This process is time consuming and is typically done with pekoes of higher quality. The tea is processed within one to two days of harvesting, and if done correctly retains most of the chemical composition of the fresh leaves from which it was produced. Variation in steaming time for fixation or processing from additional stages of rolling and drying are sometimes used to improve or altering the flavour for types of green tea. Green tea leaves undergo fixation by either roasting (panning) or steaming. Generally, roasted varieties are richer <b>in</b> <b>flavor,</b> while steamed varieties are more vivid in color.|$|E

25|$|Heritage turkeys {{have been}} praised by chefs and food critics alike as being richer <b>in</b> <b>flavor</b> than {{industrial}} birds, though {{the lack of}} a large amount of breast meat means cooking times and methods may differ substantially from non-heritage birds. Heritage turkeys are closer in taste to wild turkeys, but are several pounds larger. Part of this stated increase <b>in</b> <b>flavor</b> is due to a difference in the maturity between industrial turkeys and heritage ones - if birds are slaughtered at less than four months old, they fail to ever accrue fat layers.|$|E

25|$|Beans from {{different}} countries or regions {{can usually be}} distinguished by differences <b>in</b> <b>flavor,</b> aroma, body, and acidity. These taste characteristics are dependent {{not only on the}} coffee's growing region, but also on genetic subspecies (varietals) and processing. Varietals are generally known by the region in which they are grown, such as Colombian, Java and Kona.|$|E
25|$|Treating with alkali {{produces}} Dutch-process cocoa powder, {{which is}} less acidic, darker, and more mellow <b>in</b> <b>flavor</b> than what is generally available {{in most of the}} world. Regular (nonalkalized) cocoa is acidic, so when cocoa is treated with an alkaline ingredient, generally potassium carbonate, the pH increases. This process can be done at various stages during manufacturing, including during nib treatment, liquor treatment, or press cake treatment.|$|E

25|$|The {{number of}} flowers on a peach tree are {{typically}} thinned out, {{because if the}} full number of peaches mature on a branch, they are undersized and lacking <b>in</b> <b>flavor.</b> Fruits are thinned midway in the season by commercial growers. Fresh peaches are easily bruised, and do not store well. They are most flavorful when they ripen on the tree and are eaten the day of harvest.|$|E
25|$|Catfish have widely {{been caught}} and farmed for food for {{hundreds}} of years in Africa, Asia, Europe, and North America. Judgments as to the quality and flavor vary, with some food critics considering catfish excellent to eat, while others dismiss them as watery and lacking <b>in</b> <b>flavor.</b> Catfish is high in vitamin D. Farm-raised catfish contains low levels of omega-3 fatty acids and a much higher proportion of omega-6 fatty acids.|$|E
25|$|Prior to Heinz (and {{his fellow}} innovators), {{commercial}} tomato ketchups {{of that time}} were watery and thin, {{in part due to}} the use of unripe tomatoes, which were low in pectin. They had less vinegar than modern ketchups; by pickling ripe tomatoes, the need for benzoate was eliminated without spoilage or degradation <b>in</b> <b>flavor.</b> But the changes driven by the desire to eliminate benzoate also produced changes that some experts (such as Andrew F. Smith) believe were key to the establishment of tomato ketchup as the dominant American condiment.|$|E

25|$|Vintage {{wines are}} {{generally}} bottled {{in a single}} batch so that each bottle will have a similar taste. Climate's impact {{on the character of}} a wine can be significant enough to cause different vintages from the same vineyard to vary dramatically <b>in</b> <b>flavor</b> and quality. Thus, vintage wines are produced to be individually characteristic of the particular vintage and to serve as the flagship wines of the producer. Superior vintages from reputable producers and regions will often command much higher prices than their average ones. Some vintage wines (e.g. Brunello), are only made in better-than-average years.|$|E
25|$|Mexican manchego cheese was {{introduced}} to Mexico from the Spanish region of La Mancha, but it tastes quite different, as it is made {{with a mixture of}} cows’ and goats’ milk in Mexico rather than sheep’s milk. It has a buttery taste and melts well. This cheese is made in available in all parts of Mexico and {{can be found in the}} United States, as well. Normally, manchego is not aged, but the aged version is called queso manchego viejo. This version is more firm and intense <b>in</b> <b>flavor.</b> It is often served grated over dishes. In northern Mexico, this cheese can be called asadero, as well.|$|E
25|$|Malbec is very {{susceptible}} to various grape diseases and viticultural hazards—most notably frost, coulure, downey mildew and rot but {{the development of}} new clones and vineyard management techniques have helped control some of these potential problems. When it is not afflicted with these various ailments, particularly coulure, it does have the potential to produce high yields. Too high a yield, as was the circumstance in Argentina until recently with their heavy use of flood irrigation, the wines become more simplistic and lacking <b>in</b> <b>flavor.</b> Malbec seems to be able to produce well in a variety of soil types but in the limestone based soils of Cahors it seems to produce its most dark and tannic manifestation. There are distinct ampelographical differences in the clones of Malbec found in France and in Argentina, with Argentine Malbec tending to have smaller berries.|$|E
