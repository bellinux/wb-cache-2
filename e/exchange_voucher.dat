Library AA ask by E-mail to library BB a document XXX. Library BB answer : “Yes the document is available as Photocopy for 1 voucher,or 1. 5 voucher if you will it by fax”. Library AA enter the web site ASFORD using his username and password, move 1. 5 of his voucher from his pot to the account of the library BB, send a second mail to library BB ordering the document by fax. Library BB receive the order, control on the web site that 1, 5 voucher have been added to his account and send the document.

Warrants could be redeemed by the army paymasters, but most often they were used like cash by the recipient. Warrants, like bills of <b>exchange</b> and <b>vouchers,</b> were often heavily discounted and depreciated in value.

Those who submitted the questionnaire were rewarded with points which can be <b>exchanged</b> for <b>vouchers</b> once they accumulated a certain amount. Six hundred seventeen questionnaires were returned within two weeks. Since the online system recorded respondents’ starting and completion time, we were able to identify those questionnaires completed in a short time. We deleted those completed in less than three minutes, as we estimate that it should have taken longer. We also deleted the ones in which there were too many missing values. From the remaining questionnaires we further excluded those in which the participants reported that they have no work experience (N[*]=[*] 39), since our aim is to examine the leadership preferences of employees. The final sample included 423 participants.|$|R

Two hundred eighty five pistols, revolvers and shotguns were voluntarily turned in by citizens for destruction in <b>exchange</b> for <b>vouchers</b> for foodstuffs and tickets to football games with values ranging from US 50 to 100. Participants were able to make contact with the programme organisers through a toll-free telephone line. Prior to the firearm turn-in component a public education effort was coordinated in the school system that culminated in a violent toy turn-in and destruction drive that brought in thousands of toy guns and video games for public destruction and incorporation into displays of art. The overwhelmingly positive response to {{the first phase of}} the programme inspired organisers to launch a second phase of weapons collection on 10 April 2001 including sectors of the province outside the Greater Mendoza area. Although the second phase was scheduled to end on 24 April 2001 it had to be extended on two separate occasions in response to enthusiastic requests from several localities that were not originally scheduled to host the Arms Exchange Programme. The second phase, which lasted six weeks, collected a total of 2, 281 weapons and 6, 547 rounds of ammunition, bringing in a total of 2, 566 weapons and 8, 262 rounds of ammunition for both phases combined.

40|$|Complaint {{handling}} encounters represent useful {{opportunities for}} retailers to rectify problems, salvage {{the relationship between}} the retailer and the customer, and increase customer satisfaction and customer loyalty. Service recovery (complaint handling) therefore becomes critical “moments of truth” for organisations in their efforts to satisfy and retain customers. The purpose of the research was to explore and describe complainants’ evaluations of appliance retailers’ complaint handling procedures in terms of their perceptions of justice. In addition, the relationships between perceived justice and emotions and perceive justice and post-complaint behavioural intentions were explored. The unit of analysis was consumers who had encountered an appliance failure and had sought redress from the appliance retailer where the appliance was originally purchased (within a oneyear recall period). This study used a cross-sectional survey approach to capture real perceptions of justice, emotions and behavioural intentions. Convenience sampling was employed in Tshwane, a major metropolitan area of South Africa. Data was collected via a self-administered questionnaire. A total of 198 usable questionnaires were collected. The results of the exploratory factor analysis showed that respondents had specific expectations about retailers’ complaint handling. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated that the respondents indeed judged complaint handling in terms of procedural, interactional and distributive justice. They experienced procedural justice when complaint handling personnel followed company policy and the correct procedures in handling their complaints, when the employees were competent, when they resolved complaints in a timely manner and made it easy for the dissatisfied consumers to voice their complaints. The respondents experienced interactional justice when complaint handling personnel treated them with respect (were polite), made it easy for them to determine where to lodge their complaints (i. e. to whom they should complain in the company), communicated clearly (with adequate use of language), were appropriately concerned about the problem, took great effort in resolving the complaint, and provided them with an appropriate explanation as to why the appliance has failed. Verbal communication about where to complain forms part of respondents’ perception of the fairness of the interpersonal communications used in settling complaints factor, rather than the procedural justice factor. The respondents experienced distributive justice when they perceived that the redress (i. e. compensation: free repairs, product <b>exchange,</b> refund, <b>voucher</b> etc.) offered by the retailers was more they expected, was fair, was what they deserved or was what they needed. Respondents perceived that retailers’ were fair concerning procedural justice and distributive justice, but unfair concerning interactional justice. The strongest positive emotions that respondents experienced were gratitude, happiness, being valued and joyfulness, while lower levels of warm feelings and pride were experienced. The strongest negative emotions that respondents experienced were anger, annoyance, being upset and being in a bad mood, while lower levels of guilt and sadness were experienced. Relationships exist between respondents’ perceptions of justice and their emotions, and between their emotions and post-complaint behavioural intentions (repurchase intentions, word-of-mouth intentions and third-party complaint intentions).

40|$|A presente pesquisa investigou o efeito do fornecimento ou não de instruções com diferentes formulações (1) na obtenção de um {{responder}} sensível ao esquema e (2) na resistência à mudança do responder frente a alterações na contingência. Os participantes foram submetidos a três condições experimentais. O estudo foi realizado com 15 participantes e utilizou um delineamento de reversão com sujeito único (ABCA). Nas sessões experimentais, os participantes eram expostos a esquemas de reforçamento concorrente VI VI que corriam simultaneamente em dois retângulos (vermelho e azul) apresentados na tela. Apenas um dos retângulo estava ativo por vez e um botão de mudança permitia alternar o retângulo ativo. Um clique no retângulo ativo dava acesso a operações matemáticas que o participante deveria resolver. Garantiu-se por meio de uma sessão de avaliação que os participantes soubessem resolver as operações com precisão. Nas sessões experimentais, uma resposta correta à operação matemática era consequenciada com um ponto de acordo com o esquema de reforçamento VI em vigor no retângulo selecionado. Na condição Sem Instrução (SI), nenhuma instrução que descresse como distribuir o responder entre as alternativas era apresentada. Na condição Instrução Estratégica (IE) era fornecida uma instrução que descrevia uma estratégia para que o participante determinasse a melhor forma de distribuir o seu responder, identificando ele próprio o padrão de respostas mais vantajoso. Na condição Instrução Tática era fornecida uma instrução que especificava um padrão de resposta exato a ser seguido (IT 1) ou o padrão exato de entrega de pontos (IT 2) para que o participante ganhasse a maior quantidade de pontos. Analisou-se o comportamento de escolha dos participantes, mensurado a partir do parâmetro a da lei generalizada da igualação, e a variabilidade do comportamento, mensurada a partir dos cliques no botão de mudança. As sessões experimentais eram compostas de duas etapas: (1) Contingencia de Aprendizagem (CA), na qual era possível testar as taxas de entrega de pontos; (2) Contingência de Teste (CT), em que os pontos ganhos eram trocados por um voucher. Os esquemas de reforçamento eram subsequentemente invertidos entre os retângulos. Os resultados indicaram que a instrução estratégica consistentemente produziu um responder de acordo com o esquema em vigor e não resistente à mudança quando as contingências eram alteradas. Já a instrução tática não produziu um responder consistentemente de acordo com o esquema, de forma que não foi possível investigar a presença de resistência à mudança quando os esquemas eram invertidos. A condição sem instrução produziu um responder marcadamente indiferenciado entre as duas alternativas. Verificou-se uma influência da história experimental no desempenho das diferentes condições experimentais. Apesar de os participantes primeiro expostos à instrução estratégica terem apresentado alto número de cliques no botão de mudança, os resultados indicam que, não apenas variar entre as alternativas, mas mudar o responder de outras formas, pode ser importante para obter um responder de acordo com o esquema. Discute-se como as características do esquema de intervalo variável, a metodologia utilizada e a formulação da regra podem ter influenciado nos resultados obtidos com as instruções táticasThe {{present research}} has investigated {{the effect of}} the supply of instructions or the lack of it with different formulations (1) in the obtention of a response sensitive to the schedule and (2) in the resistance to the response’s change when faced with alterations in the contingency. The participants were submitted to three experimental conditions. The study was accomplished with 15 participants and it used a reversal single subject design (ABCA). During the experimental sessions, the participants were exposed to concurrent reinforcement schedules VI VI that occurred simultaneously in two rectangles (red and blue) presented on the screen. Only one of the rectangles was active at a time and a change button allowed the alternation of the active rectangle. A click on the active rectangle gave access to mathematical operations that the participant should solve. During an evaluation session it was assured that the participants were able to solve the operations with precision. On the experimental sessions, a correct answer to the mathematical operation was followed by a point according to the reinforcement schedule VI in force on the selected rectangle. In the condition No Instruction (SI), no instruction that described how to distribute the response between alternatives was presented. In the Strategic Instruction (IE) condition, an instruction that described a strategy was provided to the participants so that they could determine the best way to distribute the response, allowing them to identify for themselves the pattern of answers that was more advantageous. In the Tactical Instruction condition, an instruction that specified an exact response pattern to be followed (IT 1) or the exact pattern for the point delivery was provided to allow the participant to earn the biggest quantity of points. The participants’ behavior choice was analyzed, measured by the parameters a of the generalized matching law and the behavior variability, measured by the clicks on the change button. The experimental sessions were composed by two stages: (1) Learning Contingency (LC), in which it was possible to test the point delivery rate; (2) Test Contingency (TC), where the earned points were <b>exchanged</b> by a <b>voucher.</b> The schedules of reinforcement were subsequently reversed between the rectangles. The results indicated that the strategic instruction consistently produced a response according to the schedule in force and not resistant to change when the contingencies were altered. On the other hand, the tactical instruction didn’t produce a consistent response according to the schedule, so it wasn’t possible to investigate the presence of resistance to change when the schedules were reversed. The condition without instruction produced a response markedly indifferentiated between the two alternatives. An influence of the experimental history was verified in the performance of the different experimental conditions. Even though the participants that were first exposed to strategic instruction presented a high number of clicks on the change button, the results indicate that not only varying between alternatives but changing the response in other ways can be important in obtaining a response according to the schedule. It is discussed how the characteristics of the VI schedule, the methodology used and the formulation of the rule could have influenced the results obtained with tactical instruction...|$|R
