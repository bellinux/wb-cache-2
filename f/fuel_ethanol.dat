5|$|Flexible-fuel {{vehicles}} (FFVs) {{are based}} on dual-fuel systems that supply both fuels into the combustion chamber {{at the same time}} in various calibrated proportions. The most common fuels used by FFVs today are unleaded gasoline and ethanol <b>fuel.</b> <b>Ethanol</b> FFVs can run on pure gasoline, pure ethanol (E100) or any combination of both. Methanol has also been blended with gasoline in flex-fuel vehicles known as M85 FFVs, but their use has been limited mainly to demonstration projects and small government fleets, particularly in California.|$|E
25|$|Biofuels {{produced}} from food crops have become controversial as food prices increased significantly in mid-2008, leading to increased concerns about food vs <b>fuel.</b> <b>Ethanol</b> fuel in Australia can be {{produced from}} sugarcane or grains and there are currently three commercial producers of <b>fuel</b> <b>ethanol</b> in Australia, all on the east coast. Legislation imposes a 10% cap on the concentration of <b>fuel</b> <b>ethanol</b> blends. Blends of 90% unleaded petrol and 10% <b>fuel</b> <b>ethanol</b> are {{commonly referred to as}} E10, which is mainly available through service stations operating under the BP, Caltex, Shell, and United brands. In partnership with the Queensland Government, the Canegrowers organisation launched a regional billboard campaign in March 2007 to promote the renewable fuels industry. Over 100million litres of the new BP Unleaded with renewable ethanol has now been sold to Queensland motorists. Biodiesel produced from oilseed crops or recycled cooking oil may be a better prospect than ethanol, given the nation's heavy reliance on road transport, and the growing popularity of fuel-efficient diesel cars. Australian cities {{are some of the most}} car-dependent cities in the world, and legislations involving vehicle pollution within the country are considered relatively lax.|$|E

25|$|There are {{basically}} three dehydration processes {{to remove the}} water from an azeotropic ethanol/water mixture. The first process, used in many early <b>fuel</b> <b>ethanol</b> plants, is called azeotropic distillation and consists of adding benzene or cyclohexane to the mixture.

25|$|Most of {{the retail}} {{gasoline}} now sold in the United States contains about 10% <b>fuel</b> <b>ethanol</b> (or E10) by volume. Burning a gallon of E10 produces about 17.68 pounds of CO2 that is emitted from the fossil fuel content. If the CO2 emissions from ethanol combustion are considered, then about 18.95 pounds of CO2 are produced when a gallon of E10 is combusted. About 12.73 pounds of CO2 are produced when a gallon of pure ethanol is combusted.|$|E

25|$|With {{increasing}} attention {{being paid}} to saving energy, many methods have been proposed that avoid distillation altogether for dehydration. Of these methods, a third method has emerged and has been adopted {{by the majority of}} modern ethanol plants. This new process uses molecular sieves to remove water from <b>fuel</b> <b>ethanol.</b> In this process, ethanol vapor under pressure passes through a bed of molecular sieve beads. The bead's pores are sized to allow adsorption of water while excluding ethanol. After a period of time, the bed is regenerated under vacuum or in the flow of inert atmosphere (e.g. N2) to remove the adsorbed water. Two beds are often used so that one is available to adsorb water while the other is being regenerated. This dehydration technology can account for energy saving of 3,000 btus/gallon (840 kJ/L) compared to earlier azeotropic distillation.|$|E
25|$|In 2014 global {{wind power}} {{capacity}} expanded 16% to 369,553 MW. Yearly {{wind energy production}} is also growing rapidly and has reached around 4% of worldwide electricity usage, 11.4% in the EU, and it is widely used in Asia, and the United States. In 2014, worldwide installed photovoltaics capacity increased to 177 gigawatts (GW), sufficient to supply 1 percent of global electricity demands.

25|$|Biomass can be {{converted}} to other usable forms of energy like methane gas or transportation fuels like ethanol and biodiesel. Rotting garbage, and agricultural and human waste, all release methane gasalso called landfill gas or biogas. Crops, such as corn and sugarcane, can be fermented to produce the transportation <b>fuel,</b> <b>ethanol.</b> Biodiesel, another transportation fuel, can be produced from left-over food products like vegetable oils and animal fats. Also, biomass to liquids (BTLs) and cellulosic ethanol are still under research. There {{is a great deal of}} research involving algal fuel or algae-derived biomass due to the fact that it's a non-food resource and can be produced at rates 5 to 10 times those of other types of land-based agriculture, such as corn and soy. Once harvested, it can be fermented to produce biofuels such as ethanol, butanol, and methane, as well as biodiesel and hydrogen. The biomass used for electricity generation varies by region. Forest by-products, such as wood residues, are common in the United States. Agricultural waste is common in Mauritius (sugar cane residue) and Southeast Asia (rice husks). Animal husbandry residues, such as poultry litter, are common in the United Kingdom.|$|E

25|$|A 2004 MIT {{study and}} an earlier paper {{published}} by the Society of Automotive Engineers identified a method to exploit the characteristics of <b>fuel</b> <b>ethanol</b> substantially more efficiently than mixing it with gasoline. The method presents the possibility of leveraging the use of alcohol to achieve definite improvement over the cost-effectiveness of hybrid electric. The improvement consists of using dual-fuel direct-injection of pure alcohol (or the azeotrope or E85) and gasoline, in any ratio up to 100% of either, in a turbocharged, high compression-ratio, small-displacement engine having performance similar to an engine having twice the displacement. Each fuel is carried separately, with a much smaller tank for alcohol. The high-compression (for higher efficiency) engine runs on ordinary gasoline under low-power cruise conditions. Alcohol is directly injected into the cylinders (and the gasoline injection simultaneously reduced) only when necessary to suppress â€˜knockâ€™ such as when significantly accelerating. Direct cylinder injection raises the already high octane rating of ethanol up to an effective 130. The calculated over-all reduction of gasoline use and CO2 emission is 30%. The consumer cost payback time shows a 4:1 improvement over turbo-diesel and a 5:1 improvement over hybrid. The problems of water absorption into pre-mixed gasoline (causing phase separation), supply issues of multiple mix ratios and cold-weather starting are also avoided.|$|E

2500|$|The {{experiments}} {{show that}} water in <b>fuel</b> <b>ethanol</b> inhibits dry corrosion. At 10,000 ppm {{water in the}} E50 experiments by JARI and 3,500 ppm water in the E20 experiments by TU Darmstadt [...] the alcoholate/alkoxide corrosion stopped. In the <b>fuel</b> <b>ethanol</b> this resembles 20,000 ppm or 2 volume% {{in the case of}} JARI and 5 x 3500 = 17,500 ppm of 1.75 volume% in the case of TU Darmstadt. The observations are in line with the fact that hydrous ethanol is known for being less corrosive than anhydrous ethanol. The reaction mechanism will be the same at lower-mid blends. When enough water is present in the fuel, the aluminum will react preferably with water to produce aluminum oxide, repairing the protective aluminum oxide layer, which is why the corrosion stops. The aluminum alcoholate/alkoxide does not make a tight oxide layer, which is why the corrosion continues. In other words, water is essential to repair the holes in the oxide layer. Based on the Japanese/German results, a minimum of 2 vol.% or 2.52% m/m water is currently proposed in the revision of the hydrous ethanol specification for blending in petrol at E10+ levels. Water injection has additional positive effects on the engine performance (thermodynamic efficiency) and reduces overall CO2 emissions.|$|E
